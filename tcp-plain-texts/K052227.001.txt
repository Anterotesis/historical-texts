 bust of Homer  ΟΜΗΡΟΣ  THE ILIAD OF HOMER  Translated by Mr  POPE  Te sequor O Graiae gentis Decus inque tuis nunc  Fixa pedum pono pressis vestigia signis  Non ita certandi cupidus quàm propter Amorem  Quòd Te imitari aveo  LUCRET  LONDON  Printed by W BOWYER for BERNARD LINTOTT between the  TempleGates    PREFACE  HOMER is universally allow'd to have had the greatest Invention of any Writer whatever The Praise of Judgment  Virgil  has justly contested with him and others may have their Pretensions as to particular Excellencies but his Invention remains yet unrival'd Nor is it a Wonder if he has ever been acknowledg'd the greatest of Poets who most excell'd in That which is the very Foundation of Poetry It is the Invention that in different degrees distinguishes all great Genius's The utmost Stretch of human Study Learning and Industry which masters every thing besides can never attain to this It furnishes Art with all her Materials and without it Judgment itself can at best but  steal wisely  For Art is only like a prudent Steward that lives on managing the Riches of Nature Whatever Praises may be given to Works of Judgment there is not even a single Beauty in them but is owing to the Invention As in the most regular Gardens however Art may carry the greatest Appearance there is not  a Plant or Flower but is the Gift of Nature The first can only reduce the Beauties of the latter into a more obvious Figure which the common Eye may better take in and is therefore more entertain'd with And perhaps the reason why most Criticks are inclin'd to prefer a judicious and methodical Genius to a great and fruitful one is because they find it easier for themselves to pursue their Observations through an uniform and bounded Walk of Art than to comprehend the vast and various Extent of Nature  Our Author's Work is a wild Paradise where if we cannot see all the Beauties so distinctly as in an order'd Garden it is only because the Number of them is infinitely greater 'Tis like a copious Nursery which contains the Seeds and first Productions of every kind out of which those who follow'd him have but selected some particular Plants each according to his Fancy to cultivate and beautify If some things are too luxuriant it is owing to the Richness of the Soil and if others are not arriv'd to Perfection or Maturity it is only because they are overrun and opprest by those of a stronger Nature  It is to the Strength of this amazing Invention we are to attribute that unequal'd Fire and Rapture which is so forcible in  Homer  that no Man of a true Poetical Spirit is Master of himself while he reads him What he writes is of the most animated Nature imaginable every thing moves every thing lives and is put in  Action If a Council be call'd or a Battel fought you are not coldly inform'd of what was said or done as from a third Person the Reader is hurry'd out of himself by the Force of the Poet's Imagination and turns in one place to a Hearer in another to a Spectator The Course of his Verses resembles that of the Army he describes  They pour along like a Fire that sweeps the whole Earth before it  'Tis however remarkable that his Fancy which is every where vigorous is not discover'd immediately at the beginning of his Poem in its fullest Splendor It grows in the Progress both upon himself and others and becomes on Fire like a ChariotWheel by its own Rapidity Exact Disposition just Thought correct Elocution polish'd Numbers may have been found in a thousand but this Poetical  Fire  this  Vivida vis animi  in a very few Even in Works where all those are imperfect or neglected this can overpower Criticism and make us admire even while we disapprove Nay where this appears tho' attended with Absurdities it brightens all the Rubbish about it 'till we see nothing but its own Splendor This  Fire  is discern'd in  Virgil  but discern'd as through a Glass reflected and more shining than warm but every where equal and constant In  Lucan  and  Statius  it bursts out in sudden short and interrupted Flashes In  Milton  it glows like a Furnace kept  up to an uncommon Fierceness by the Force of Art In  Shakespear  it strikes before we are aware like an accidental Fire from Heaven But in  Homer  and in him only it burns every where clearly and every where irresistibly  I shall here endeavour to show how this vast  Invention  exerts itself in a manner superior to that of any Poet thro' all the main constituent Parts of his Work as it is the great and peculiar Characteristick which distinguishes him from all other Authors  This strong and ruling Faculty was like a powerful Planet which in the Violence of its Course drew all things within its  Vortex  It seem'd not enough to have taken in the whole Circle of Arts and the whole Compass of Nature all the inward Passions and Affections of Mankind to supply this Characters and all the outward Forms and Images of Things for his Descriptions but wanting yet an ampler Sphere to expatiate in he open'd a new and boundless Walk for his Imagination and created a World for himself in the Invention of  Fable  That which  Aristotle  calls the  Soul of Poetry  was first breath'd into it by  Homer  I shall begin with considering him in this Part as it is naturally the first and I speak of it both as it means the Design of a Poem and as it is taken for Fiction  Fable may be divided into the  Probable  the  Allegorical  and the  Marvelous  The  Probable  Fable  is the Recital of such Actions as tho' they did not happen yet might in the common course of Nature Or of such as tho' they did become Fables by the additional Episodes and manner of telling them Of this sort is the main Story of an Epic Poem  the Return of  Ulysses  the Settlement of the  Trojans  in  Italy or the like That of the  Iliad  is  the Anger of  Achilles the most short and single Subject that ever was chosen by any Poet Yet this he has supplied with a vaster Variety of Incidents and Events and crouded with a greater Number of Councils Speeches Battles and Episodes of all kinds than are to be found even in those Poems whose Schemes are of the utmost Latitude and Irregularity The Action is hurry'd on with the most vehement Spirit and its whole Duration employs not so much as fifty Days  Virgil  for want of so warm a Genius aided himself by taking in a more extensive Subject as well as a greater Length of Time and contracting the Design of both  Homer  's Poems into one which is yet but a fourth part as large as his The other Epic Poets have us'd the same Practice but generally carry'd it so far as to superinduce a Multiplicity of Fables destroy the Unity of Action and lose their Readers in an unreasonable Length of Time Nor is it only in the main Design that they have been unable to add to his Invention but they have follow'd him in every Episode and Part of Story If he has  given a regular  Catalogue  of an  Army  they all draw up their Forces in the same Order If he has funeral Games for  Patroclus Virgil  has the same for  Anchises  and  Statius  rather than omit them destroys the Unity of his Action for those of  Archemorus  If  Ulysses  visit the Shades the  Aeneas  of  Virgil  and  Scipio  of  Silius  are sent after him If he be detain'd from his Return by the Allurements of  Calypso  so is  Aeneas  by  Dido  and  Rinaldo  by  Armida  If  Achilles  be absent from the Army on the Score of a Quarrel thro' half the Poem  Rinaldo  must absent himself just as long on the like account If he gives his Heroe a Suit of celestial Armour  Virgil  and  Tasso  make the same Present to theirs  Virgil  has not only observ'd this close Imitation of  Homer  but where he had not led the way supply'd the Want from other  Greek  Authors Thus the Story of  Sinon  and the  Taking of Troy  was copied says  Macrobius  almost word for word from  Pisander  as the Loves of  Dido  and  Aeneas  are taken from those of  Medaea  and  Jason  in  Apollonius  and several others in the same manner  To proceed to the  Allegorical Fable  If we reflect upon those innumerable Knowledges those Secrets of Nature and Physical Philosophy which  Homer  is generally suppos'd to have wrapt up in his  Allegories  what a new and ample Scene of Wonder may this Consideration afford us How fertile will that Imagination appear which was  able to cloath all the Properties of Elements the Qualifications of the Mind the Virtues and Vices in Forms and Persons and to introduce them into Actions agreeable to the Nature of the Things they shadow'd This is a Field in which no succeeding Poets could dispute with  Homer  and whatever Commendations have been allow'd them on this Head are by no means for their Invention in having enlarg'd his Circle but for their Judgment in having contracted it For when the Mode of Learning chang'd in following Ages and Science was deliver'd in a plainer manner it then became as reasonable in the more modern Poets to lay it aside as it was in  Homer  to make use of it And perhaps it was no unhappy Circumstance for  Virgil  that there was not in his Time that Demand upon him of so great an Invention as might be capable of furnishing all those Allegorical Parts of a Poem  The  Marvelous Fable  includes whatever is supernatural and especially the Machines of the Gods If  Homer  was not the first who introduc'd the Deities as  Herodotus  imagines into the Religion of  Greece  he seems the first who brought them into a System of  Machinery  for Poetry and such an one as makes its greatest Importance and Dignity For we find those Authors who have been offended at the literal Notion of the Gods constantly laying their Accusation against  Homer  as the undoubted Inventor of them But whatever cause there might be to blame his  Machines  in a Philosophical or Religious View they are so perfect in the Poetick that Mankind have been ever since contented to follow them None have been able to enlarge the Sphere of Poetry beyond the Limits he has set Every Attempt of this Nature has prov'd unsuccessful and after all the various Changes of Times and Religions his Gods continue to this Day the Gods of Poetry  We come now to the  Characters  of his Persons and here we shall find no Author has ever drawn so many with so visible and surprizing a Variety or given us such lively and affecting Impressions of them Every one has something so singularly his own that no Painter could have distinguish'd them more by their Features than the Poet has by their Manners Nothing can be more exact than the Distinctions he has observ'd in the different degrees of Virtues and Vices The single Quality of  Courage  is wonderfully diversify'd in the several Characters of the  Iliad  That of  Achilles  is furious and intractable that of  Diomede  forward yet listening to Advice and subject to Command We see in  Ajax  an heavy and selfconsidering Valour in  Hector  an active and vigilant one The Courage of  Agamemnon  is inspirited by Love of Empire and Ambition that of  Menelaus  mix'd with Softness and Tenderness for his People We find in  Idomeneus  a plain direct Soldier in  Sarpedon  a gallant and generous one Nor is this judicious and astonishing Diversity to  be found only in the principal Quality which constitutes the Main of each Character but even in the Underparts of it to which he takes care to give a Tincture of that principal one For Example the main Characters of  Ulysses  and  Nestor  consist in  Wisdom  and they are distinct in this the Wisdom of one is  artificial  and  various  of the other  natural open  and  regular  But they have besides Characters of  Courage  and this Quality also takes a different Turn in each from the difference of his Prudence For one in the War depends still upon  Caution  the other upon  Experience  It would be endless to produce Instances of these Kinds The Characters of  Virgil  are far from striking us in this open manner they lie in a great degree hidden and undistinguish'd and where they are mark'd most evidently affect us not in proportion to those of  Homer  His Characters of Valour are much alike even that of  Turnus  seems no way peculiar but as it is in a superior degree and we see nothing that differences the Courage of  Mnestheus  from that of  Sergesthus Cloanthus  or the rest In like manner it may be remark'd of  Statius  's Heroes that an Air of Impetuosity runs thro' them all the same horrid and savage Courage appears in his  Capaneus Tydeus Hippomedon  c They have a Parity of Character which makes them seem Brothers of one Family I believe when the Reader is led into this Track of Reflection if he will pursue it through the  Epic  and  Tragic  Writers he will be convinced  how infinitely superior in this Point the Invention of  Homer  was to that of all others  The  Speeches  are to be consider'd as they slow from the Characters being perfect or defective as they agree or disagree with the Manners of those who utter them As there is more variety of Characters in the  Iliad  so there is of Speeches than in any other Poem  Every thing in it has Manners  as  Aristotle  expresses it that is every thing is acted or spoken It is hardly credible in a Work of such length how small a Number of Lines are employ'd in Narration In  Virgil  the Dramatic Part is less in proportion to the Narrative and the Speeches often consist of general Reflections or Thoughts which might be equally just in any Person's Mouth upon the same Occasion As many of his Persons have no apparent Characters so many of his Speeches escape being apply'd and judg'd by the Rule of Propriety We oftner think of the Author himself when we read  Virgil  than when we are engag'd in  Homer  All which are the Effects of a colder Invention that interests us less in the Action describ'd  Homer  makes us Hearers and  Virgil  leaves us Readers  If in the next place we take a View of the  Sentiments  the same presiding Faculty is eminent in the Sublimity and Spirit of his Thoughts  Longinus  has given his Opinion that it was in this Part  Homer  principally excell'd What were alone sufficient to prove the Grandeur and Excellence of his Sentiments in general is that  they have so remarkable a Parity with those of the Scripture  Duport  in his  Gnomologia Homerica  has collected innumerable Instances of this sort And it is with Justice an excellent modern Writer allows that if  Virgil  has not so many Thoughts that are low and vulgar he has not so many that are sublime and noble and that the  Roman  Author seldom rises into very astonishing Sentiments where he is not fired by the  Iliad  If we observe his  Descriptions Images  and  Similes  we shall find the Invention still predominant To what else can we ascribe that vast Comprehension of Images of every sort where we see each Circumstance and Individual of Nature summon'd together by the Extent and Fecundity of his Imagination to which all things in their various Views presented themselves in an Instant and had their Impressions taken off to Perfection at a Heat Nay he not only gives us the full Prospects of Things but several unexpected Peculiarities and SideViews unobserv'd by any Painter but  Homer  Nothing is so surprizing as the Descriptions of his Battels which take up no less than half the  Iliad  and are supply'd with so vast a Variety of Incidents that no one bears a Likeness to another such different Kinds of Deaths that no two Heroes are wounded in the same manner and such a Profusion of noble Ideas that every Battel rises above the last in Greatness Horror and Confusion It is certain there is not near that Number of Images and  Descriptions in any Epic Poet tho' every one has assisted himself with a great Quantity out of him And it is evident of  Virgil  especially that he has scarce any Comparisons which are not drawn from his Master  If we descend from hence to the  Expression  we see the bright Imagination of  Homer  shining out in the most enliven'd Forms of it We acknowledge him the Father of Poetical Diction the first who taught that  Language of the Gods  to Men His Expression is like the colouring of some great Masters which discovers itself to be laid on boldly and executed with Rapidity It is indeed the strongest and most glowing imaginable and touch'd with the greatest Spirit  Aristotle  had reason to say He was the only Poet who had found out  Living Words  there are in him more daring Figures and Metaphors than in any good Author whatever An Arrow is  impatient  to be on the Wing a Weapon  thirsts  to drink the Blood of an Enemy and the like Yet his Expression is never too big for the Sense but justly great in proportion to it 'Tis the Sentiment that swells and fills out the Diction which rises with it and forms itself about it For in the same degree that a  Thought  is warmer an  Expression  will be brighter and as That is more strong This will become more perspicuous Like Glass in the Furnace which grows to a greater Magnitude and refines to a greater Clearness only as the  Breath  within is more powerful and the  Heat  more intense  To throw his Language more out of Prose  Homer  seems to have affected the  CompoundEpithets  This was a sort of Composition peculiarly proper to Poetry not only as it heighten'd the  Diction  but as it assisted and fill'd the  Numbers  with greater Sound and Pomp and likewise conduced in some measure to thicken the  Images  On this last Consideration I cannot but attribute these to the Fruitfulness of his Invention since as he has manag'd them they are a sort of supernumerary Pictures of the Persons or Things they are join'd to We see the Motion of  Hector  's Plumes in the Epithet  the Landscape of Mount  Neritus  in that of  and so of others which particular Images could not have been insisted upon so long as to express them in a Description tho' but of a single Line without diverting the Reader too much from the principal Action or Figure As a Metaphor is a short Simile one of these Epithets is a short Description  Lastly if we consider his  Versification  we shall be sensible what a Share of Praise is due to his Invention in that also He was not satisfy'd with his Language as he found it settled in any one Part of  Greece  but search'd thro' its differing  Dialects  with this particular View to beautify and perfect his Numbers He consider'd these as they had a greater Mixture of Vowels or Consonants and accordingly employ'd them as the Verse requir'd either a greater Smoothness  or Strength What he most affected was the  Ionic  which has a peculiar Sweetness from its never using Contractions and from its Custom of resolving the Diphthongs into two Syllables so as to make the Words open themselves with a more spreading and sonorous Fluency With this he mingled the  Attic  Contractions the broader  Doric  and the feebler  Aeolic  which often rejects its Aspirate or takes off its Accent and compleated this Variety by altering some Letters with the License of Poetry Thus his Measures instead of being Fetters to his Sense were always in readiness to run along with the Warmth of his Rapture and even to give a farther Representation of his Notions in the Correspondence of their Sounds to what they signify'd Out of all these he has deriv'd that Harmony which makes us confess he had not only the richest Head but the finest Ear in the World This is so great a Truth that whoever will but consult the Tune of his Verses even without understanding them with the same sort of Diligence as we daily see practis'd in the Case of  Italian Opera's  will find more Sweetness Variety and Majesty of Sound than in any other Language or Poetry The Beauty of his Numbers is allow'd by the Criticks to be copied but faintly by  Virgil  himself tho' they are so just to ascribe it to the Nature of the  Latine  Tongue Indeed the  Greek  has some Advantages both from the natural  Sound  of its  Words  and the Turn and  Cadence  of its  Verse  which agree  with the Genius of no other Language  Virgil  was very sensible of this and used the utmost Diligence in working up a more intractable Language to whatsoever Graces it was capable of and in particular never fail'd to bring the Sound of his Line to a beautiful Agreement with its Sense If the  Grecian  Poet has not been so frequently celebrated on this Account as the  Roman  the only reason is that fewer Criticks have understood one Language than the other  Dionysius  of  Halicarnassus  has pointed out many of our Author's Beauties in this kind in his Treatise of the  Composition of Words  and others will be taken notice of in the Course of the Notes It suffices at present to observe of his Numbers that they flow with so much ease as to make one imagine  Homer  had no other care than to transcribe as fast as the  Muses  dictated and at the same time with so much Force and inspiriting Vigour that they awaken and raise us like the Sound of a Trumpet They roll along as a plentiful River always in motion and always full while we are born away by a Tide of Verse the most rapid and yet the most smooth imaginable  Thus on whatever side we contemplate  Homer  what principally strikes us is his  Invention  It is that which forms the Character of each Part of his Work and accordingly we find it to have made his Fable more  extensive  and  copious  than any other his Manners more  lively  and  strongly marked  his Speeches more  affecting  and  transported  his Sentiments more  warm  and  sublime  his Images and Descriptions more  full  and  animated  his Expression more  rais'd  and  daring  and his Numbers more  rapid  and  various  I hope in what has been said of  Virgil  with regard to any of these Heads I have no way derogated from his Character Nothing is more absurd or endless than the common Method of comparing eminent Writers by an Opposition of particular Passages in them and forming a Judgment from thence of their Merit upon the whole We ought to have a certain Knowledge of the principal Character and distinguishing Excellence of each It is in  that  we are to consider him and in proportion to his Degree in  that  we are to admire him No Author or Man ever excell'd all the World in more than one Faculty and as  Homer  has done this in Invention  Virgil  has in Judgment Not that we are to think  Homer  wanted Judgment because  Virgil  had it in a more eminent degree or that  Virgil  wanted Invention because  Homer  possest a larger share of it Each of these great Authors had more of both than perhaps any Man besides and are only said to have less in Comparison with one another  Homer  was the greater Genius  Virgil  the better Artist In one we most admire the  Man  in the other the  Work Homer  hurries and transports us with a commanding Impetuosity  Virgil  leads us with an attractive Majesty  Homer  scatters with a generous Profusion  Virgil  bestows  with a careful Magnificence  Homer  like the  Nile  pours out his Riches with a sudden Overflow  Virgil  like a River in its Banks with a gentle and constant Stream When we behold their Battels methinks the two Poets resemble the Heroes they celebrate  Homer  boundless and irresistible as  Achilles  bears all before him and shines more and more as the Tumult increases  Virgil  calmly daring like  Aeneas  appears undisturb'd in the midst of the Action disposes all about him and conquers with Tranquillity And when we look upon their Machines  Homer  seems like his own  Jupiter  in his Terrors shaking  Olympus  scattering the Lightnings and firing the Heavens  Virgil  like the same Power in his Benevolence counselling with the Gods laying Plans for Empires and regularly ordering his whole Creation  But after all it is with great Parts as with great Virtues they naturally border on some Imperfection and it is often hard to distinguish exactly where the Virtue ends or the Fault begins As Prudence may sometimes sink to Suspicion so may a great Judgment decline to Coldness and as Magnanimity may run up to Profusion or Extravagance so may a great Invention to Redundancy or Wildness If we look upon  Homer  in this View we shall perceive the chief  Objections  against him to proceed from so noble a Cause as the Excess of this Faculty  Among these we may reckon some of his  Marvellous Fictions  upon which so much Criticism  has been spent as surpassing all the Bounds of Probability Perhaps it may be with great and superior Souls as with gigantick Bodies which exerting themselves with unusual Strength exceed what is commonly thought the due Proportion of Parts to become Miracles in the whole and like the old Heroes of that Make commit something near Extravagance amidst a Series of glorious and inimitable Performances Thus  Homer  has his  speaking Horses  and  Virgil  his  Myrtles distilling Blood  without so much as contriving the easy Intervention of a Deity to save the Probability  It is owing to the same vast Invention that his  Similes  have been thought too exuberant and full of Circumstances The Force of this Faculty is seen in nothing more than its Inability to confine itself to that single Circumstance upon which the Comparison is grounded It runs out into Embellishments of additional Images which however are so manag'd as not to overpower the main one His Similes are like Pictures where the principal Figure has not only its proportion given agreeable to the Original but is also set off with occasional Ornaments and Prospects The same will account for his manner of heaping a Number of Comparisons together in one Breath when his Fancy suggested to him at once so many various and correspondent Images The Reader will easily extend this Observation to more Objections of the same kind  If there are others which seem rather to charge him with a Defect or Narrowness of Genius than an Excess of it those seeming Defects will be found upon Examination to proceed wholly from the Nature of the Times he liv'd in Such are his  grosser Representations  of the  Gods  and the vicious and  imperfect Manners  of his  Heroes  which will be treated of in the following  See the Articles of  Theology  and  Morality  in the third Part of the  Essay  Essay  But I must here speak a word of the latter as it is a Point generally carry'd into Extreams both by the Censurers and Defenders of  Homer  It must be a strange Partiality to Antiquity to think with Madam  Dacier  "that  Preface to her  Homer  those Times and Manners are so much the more excellent as they are more contrary to ours"  Who can be so prejudiced in their Favour as to magnify the Felicity of those Ages when a Spirit of Revenge and Cruelty reign'd thro' the World when no Mercy was shown but for the sake of Lucre when the greatest Princes were put to the Sword and their Wives and Daughters made Slaves and Concubines On the other side I would not be so delicate as those modern Criticks who are shock'd at the  servile Offices  and  mean Employments  in which we sometimes see the Heroes of  Homer  engag'd There is a Pleasure in taking a view of that Simplicity in Opposition to the Luxury of succeeding Ages in beholding Monarchs without their Guards Princes tending their Flocks and  Princesses drawing Water from the Springs When we read  Homer  we ought to reflect that we are reading the most ancient Author in the Heathen World and those who consider him in this Light will double their Pleasure in the Perusal of him Let them think they are growing acquainted with Nations and People that are now no more that they are stepping almost three thousand Years backward into the remotest Antiquity and entertaining themselves with a clear and surprizing Vision of Things no where else to be found and the only authentick Picture of that ancient World By this means alone their greatest Obstacles will vanish and what usually creates their Dislike will become a Satisfaction  This Consideration may farther serve to answer for the constant Use of the same  Epithets  to his Gods and Heroes such as the  fardarting Phoebus  the  blueey'd Pallas  the  swiftfooted Achilles  c which some have censured as impertinent and tediously repeated Those of the Gods depended upon the Powers and Offices then believ'd to belong to them and had contracted a Weight and Veneration from the Rites and solemn Devotions in which they were us'd They were a sort of Attributes that it was a Matter of Religion to salute them with on all Occasions and an Irreverence to omit As for the Epithets of great Men Mons  Boileau  is of Opinion that they were in the Nature of  Surnames  and repeated  as such for the  Greeks  having no Names deriv'd from their Fathers were oblig'd when they mention'd any one to add some other Distinction either naming his Parents expressly or his Place of Birth Profession or the like As  Alexander  Son of  Philip Herodotus  of  Halicarnassus Diogenes  the  Cynic c Homer  therefore complying with the Custom of his Countrey us'd such distinctive Additions as better agreed with Poetry And indeed we have something parallel to these in modern Times such as the Names of  Harold Harefoot Edmund Ironside Edward Longshanks Edward  the  black Prince c  If yet this be thought to account better for the Propriety than for the Repetition I shall add a farther Conjecture  Hesiod  dividing the World into its Ages has plac'd a fourth Age between the Brazen and the Iron one of  Heroes distinct from other Men a divine Race who fought at  Thebes  and  Troy  are called DemiGods and live by the Care of  Jupiter  in the Islands of the Blessed  Hesiod  lib  ℣ c  Now among the divine Honours which were paid them they might have this also in common with the Gods not to be mention'd without the Solemnity of an Epithet and such as might be acceptable to them by its celebrating their Families Actions or Qualities  What other Cavils have been rais'd against  Homer  are such as hardly deserve a Reply but  will yet be taken notice of as they occur in the Course of the Work Many have been occasion'd by an injudicious Endeavour to exalt  Virgil  which is much the same as if one should think to praise the Superstructure by undermining the Foundation One would imagine by the whole Course of their Parallels that these Criticks never so much as heard of  Homer  's having written first a Consideration which whoever compares these two Poets ought to have always in his Eye Some accuse him for the same things which they overlook or praise in the other as when they prefer the Fable and Moral of the  Aeneis  to those of the  Iliad  for the same Reasons which might set the  Odysses  above the  Aeneis  as that the Heroe is a wiser Man and the Action of the one more beneficial to his Countrey than that of the other Or else they blame him for not doing what he never design'd as because  Achilles  is not as good and perfect a Prince as  Aeneas  when the very Moral of his Poem requir'd a contrary Character It is thus that  Rapin  judges in his Comparison of  Homer  and  Virgil  Others select those particular Passages of  Homer  which are not so labour'd as some that  Virgil  drew out of them This is the whole Management of  Scaliger  in his  Poetices  Others quarrel with what they take for low and mean Expressions sometimes thro' a false Delicacy and Refinement oftner from an Ignorance of the Graces of the Original and then triumph in the Aukwardness of their own Translations  This is the Conduct of  Perault  in his  Parallels  Lastly there are others who pretending to a fairer Proceeding distinguish between the personal Merit of  Homer  and that of his  Work  but when they come to assign the Causes of the great Reputation of the  Iliad  they found it upon the Ignorance of his Times and the Prejudice of those that followed And in pursuance of this Principle they make those Accidents such as the Contention of the Cities  c  to be the Causes of his Fame which were in Reality the Consequences of his Merit The same might as well be said of  Virgil  or any great Author whose general Character will infallibly raise many casual Additions to their Reputation This is the Method of Mons  de la Motte  who yet confesses upon the whole that in whatever Age  Homer  had liv'd he must have been the greatest Poet of his Nation and that he may be said in this Sense to be the Master even of those who surpass'd him  In all these Objections we see nothing that contradicts his Title to the Honour of the chief  Invention  and as long as this which is indeed the Characteristic of Poetry itself remains unequal'd by his Followers he still continues superior to them A cooler Judgment may commit fewer Faults and be more approv'd in the Eves of  One Sort  of Criticks but that Warmth of Fancy will carry the loudest and most universal Applauses which holds the Heart of a Reader under the strongest Enchantment  Homer  not only appears  the Inventor of Poetry but excells all the Inventors of other Arts in this that he has swallow'd up the Honour of those who succeeded him What he has done admitted no Encrease it only lest room for Contraction or Regulation He shew'd all the Stretch of Fancy at once and if he has fail'd in some of his Flights it was but because he attempted every thing A Work of this kind seems like a mighty Tree which rises from the most vigorous Seed is improv'd with Industry flourishes and produces the finest Fruit Nature and Art have conspir'd to raise it Pleasure and Profit join'd to make it valuable and they who find the justest Faults have only said that a few Branches which run luxuriant thro' a Richness of Nature might be lopp'd into Form to give it a more regular Appearance  Having now spoken of the Beauties and Defects of the Original it remains to treat of the Translation with the same View to the chief Characteristic As far as that is seen in the main Parts of the Poem such as the  Fable Manners  and  Sentiments  no Translator can prejudice it but by wilful Omissions or Contractions As it also breaks out in every particular  Image Description  and  Simile  whoever lessens or too much softens those takes off from this chief Character It is the first grand Duty of an Interpreter to give his Author entire and unmaim'd and for the rest the  Diction  and  Versification  only are his  proper Province since these must be his own but the others he is to take as he finds them  It should then be consider'd what Methods may afford some Equivalent in our Language for the Graces of these in the  Greek  It is certain no literal Translation can be just to an excellent Original in a superior Language but it is a great Mistake to imagine as many have done that a rash Paraphrase can make amends for this general Defect which is no less in danger to lose the Spirit of an Ancient by deviating into the modern Manners of Expression If there be sometimes a  Darkness  there is often a  Light  in Antiquity which nothing better preserves than a Version almost literal I know no Liberties one ought to take but those which are necessary for transfusing the Spirit of the Original and supporting the Poetical Style of the Translation and I will venture to say there have not been more Men misled in former times by a servile dull Adherence to the Letter than have been deluded in ours by a chimerical insolent Hope of raising and improving their Author It is not to be doubted that the  Fire  of the Poem is what a Translator should principally regard as it is most likely to expire in his managing However it is his safest way to be content with preserving this to his utmost in the Whole without endeavouring to be more than he finds his Author is in any particular Place 'Tis a great Secret in Writing to know when to be plain and when poetical  and figurative and it is what  Homer  will teach us if we will but follow modestly in his Footsteps Where his Diction is bold and lofty let us raise ours as high as we can but where his is plain and humble we ought not to be deterr'd from imitating him by the fear of incurring the Censure of a meer  English  Critick Nothing that belongs to  Homer  seems to have been more commonly mistaken than the just Pitch of his Style Some of his Translators having swell'd into Fustian in a proud Confidence of the  Sublime  others sunk into Flatness in a cold and timorous Notion of  Simplicity  Methinks I see these different Followers of  Homer  some sweating and straining after him by violent Leaps and Bounds the certain Signs of false Mettle others slowly and servilely creeping in his Train while the Poet himself is all the time proceeding with an unaffected and equal Majesty before them However of the two Extreams one could sooner pardon Frenzy than Frigidity No Author is to be envy'd for such Commendations as he may gain by that Character of Style which his Friends must agree together to call  Simplicity  and the rest of the World will call  Dulness  There is a  graceful  and  dignify'd  Simplicity as well as a  bald  and  sordid  one which differ as much from each other as the Air of a  plain  Man from that of a  Sloven  'Tis one thing to be tricked up and another not to be dress'd at all Simplicity is the Mean between Ostentation and Rusticity  This pure and noble Simplicity is no where in such Perfection as in the  Scripture  and our Author One may affirm with all respect to the inspired Writings that the  Divine Spirit  made use of no other Words but what were intelligible and common to Men at that Time and in that Part of the World and as  Homer  is the Author nearest to those his Style must of course bear a greater Resemblance to the sacred Books than that of any other Writer This Consideration together with what has been observ'd of the Parity of some of his Thoughts may methinks induce a Translator on the one hand to give into several of those general Phrases and Manners of Expression which have attain'd a Veneration even in our Language from their use in the  Old Testament  as on the other to avoid those which have been appropriated to the Divinity and in a manner consign'd to Mystery and Religion  For a farther Preservation of this Air of Simplicity a particular Care should be taken to express with all Plainness those  Moral Sentences  and  Proverbial Speeches  which are so numerous in this Poet They have something Venerable and as I may say  Oracular  in that unadorn'd Gravity and Shortness with which they are deliver'd a Grace which would be utterly lost by endeavouring to give them what we call a more ingenious that is a more modern Turn in the Paraphrase  Perhaps the Mixture of some  Graecisms  and old Words after the manner of  Milton  if done without too much Affectation might not have an ill Effect in a Version of this particular Work which most of any other seems to require a venerable  Antique  Cast But certainly the use of  modern Terms  of  War  and  Government  such as  Platoon Campagne Junto  or the like which some of his Translators have fallen into cannot be allowable those only excepted without which it is impossible to treat the Subjects in any living Language  There are two Peculiarities in  Homer  's Diction that are a sort of  Marks  or  Moles  by which every common Eye distinguishes him at first sight Those who are not his greatest Admirers look upon them as Defects and those who are seem pleased with them as Beauties I speak of his  CompoundEpithets  and of his  Repetitions  Many of the former cannot be done literally into  English  without destroying the Purity of our Language I believe such should be retain'd as slide easily of themselves into an  EnglishCompound  without Violence to the Ear or to the receiv'd Rules of Composition as well as those which have receiv'd a Sanction from the Authority of our best Poets and are become familiar thro' their use of them such as the  Cloudcompelling Jove c  As for the rest whenever any can be as fully and significantly exprest in a single word as in a compounded one the Course to be taken is obvious  Some that cannot be so turn'd as to preserve their full Image by one or two Words may have Justice done them by Circumlocution as the Epithet  to a Mountain would appear little or ridiculous translated literally  Leafshaking  but affords a majestic Idea in the  Periphrasis The lofty Mountains shakes his waving Woods  Others that admit of differing Significations may receive an Advantage by a judicious Variation according to the Occasions on which they are introduc'd For Example the Epithet of  Apollo  or  farshooting  is capable of two Explications one literal in respect of the Darts and Bow the Ensigns of that God the other allegorical with regard to the Rays of the Sun Therefore in such Places where  Apollo  is represented as a God in Person I would use the former Interpretation and where the Effects of the Sun are describ'd I would make choice of the latter Upon the whole it will be necessary to avoid that perpetual Repetition of the same Epithets which we find in  Homer  and which tho' it might be accommodated as has been already shewn to the Ear of those Times is by no means so to ours But one may wait for Opportunities of placing them where they derive an additional Beauty from the Occasions on which they are employed and in doing this properly a Translator may at once shew his Fancy and his Judgment  As for  Homer  's  Repetitions  we may divide them into three sorts of whole Narrations and  Speeches of single Sentences and of one Verse or Hemistich I hope it is not impossible to have such a Regard to these as neither to lose so known a Mark of the Author on the one hand nor to offend the Reader too much on the other The Repetition is not ungraceful in those Speeches where the Dignity of the Speaker renders it a sort of Insolence to alter his Words as in the Messages from Gods to Men or from higher Powers to Inferiors in Concerns of State or where the Ceremonial of Religion seems to require it in the solemn Forms of Prayers Oaths or the like In other Cases I believe the best Rule is to be guided by the Nearness or Distance at which the Repetitions are plac'd in the Original When they follow too close one may vary the Expression but it is a Question whether a profess'd Translator be authorized to omit any If they be tedious the Author is to answer for it  It only remains to speak of the  Versification Homer  as has been said is perpetually applying the Sound to the Sense and varying it on every new Subject This is indeed one of the most exquisite Beauties of Poetry and attainable by very few I know only of  Homer  eminent for it in the  Greek  and  Virgil  in  Latine  I am sensible it is what may sometimes happen by Chance when a Writer is warm and fully possest of his Image however it may be reasonably believed they design'd this in whose Verse it so manifestly appears in a superior degree to all others Few  Readers have the Ear to be Judges of it but those who have will see I have endeavour'd at this Beauty  Upon the whole I must confess my self utterly incapable of doing Justice to  Homer  I attempt him in no other Hope but that which one may entertain without much Vanity of giving a more tolerable Copy of him than any entire Translation in Verse has yet done We have only those of  Chapman Hobbes  and  Ogilby Chapman  has taken the Advantage of an immeasurable Length of Verse notwithstanding which there is scarce any Paraphrase more loose and rambling than his He has frequent Interpolations of four or six Lines and I remember one in the thirteenth Book of the  Odysses ver  where he has spun twenty Verses out of two He is often mistaken in so bold a manner that one might think he deviated on purpose if he did not in other Places of his Notes insist so much upon Verbal Trifles He appears to have had a strong Affectation of extracting new Meanings out of his Author insomuch as to promise in his Rhyming Preface a Poem of the Mysteries he had revealed in  Homer  and perhaps he endeavoured to strain the obvious Sense to this End His Expression is involved in Fustian a Fault for which he was remarkable in his Original Writings as in the Tragedy of  Bussyd' Amboise  c In a word the Nature of the Man may account for his whole Performance for he appears from his Preface and Remarks to have been of an arrogant  Turn and an Enthusiast in Poetry His own Boast of having finish'd half the  Iliad  in less than fifteen Weeks shews with what Negligence his Version was performed But that which is to be allowed him and which very much contributed to cover his Defects is a daring fiery Spirit that animates his Translation which is something like what one might imagine  Homer  himself would have writ before he arriv'd to Years of Discretion  Hobbes  has given us a correct Explanation of the Sense in general but for Particulars and Circumstances he continually lopps them and often omits the most beautiful As for its being esteem'd a close Translation I doubt not many have been led into that Error by the Shortness of it which proceeds not from his following the Original Line by Line but from the Contractions abovementioned He sometimes omits whole Similes and Sentences and is now and then guilty of Mistakes which no Writer of his Learning could have fallen into but thro' Carelesness His Poetry as well as  Ogilby  's is too mean for Criticism  It is a great Loss to the Poetical World that Mr  Dryden  did not live to translate the  Iliad  He has left us only the first Book and a small Part of the sixth in which if he has in some Places not truly interpreted the Sense or preserved the Antiquities it ought to be excused on account of the Haste he was obliged to write in He seems to have had too much Regard to  Chapman  whose Words he sometimes copies and has unhappily  follow'd him in Passages where he wanders from the Original However had he translated the whole Work I would no more have attempted  Homer  after him than  Virgil  his Version of whom notwithstanding some human Errors is the most noble and spirited Translation I know in any Language But the Fate of great Genius's is like that of great Ministers tho' they are confessedly the first in the Commonwealth of Letters they must be envy'd and calumniated only for being at the Head of it  That which in my Opinion ought to be the Endeavour of any one who translates  Homer  is above all things to keep alive that Spirit and Fire which makes his chief Character In particular Places where the Sense can bear any Doubt to follow the strongest and most Poetical as most agreeing with that Character To copy him in all the Variations of his Style and the different Modulations of his Numbers To preserve in the more active or descriptive Parts a Warmth and Elevation in the more sedate or narrative a Plainness and Solemnity in the Speeches a Fulness and Perspicuity in the Sentences a Shortness and Gravity Not to neglect even the little Figures and Turns on the Words nor sometimes the very Cast of the Periods Neither to omit or confound any Rites or Customs of Antiquity Perhaps too he ought to include the whole in a shorter Compass than has hitherto been done by any Translator who has tolerably  preserved either the Sense or Poetry What I would farther recommend to him is to study his Author rather from his own Text than from any Commentaries how learned soever or whatever Figure they make in the Estimation of the World To consider him attentively in Comparison with  Virgil  above all the Ancients and with  Milton  above all the Moderns Next these the Archbishop of  Cambray  's  Telemachus  may give him the truest Idea of the Spirit and Turn of our Author and  Bossu  's admirable Treatise of the Epic Poem the justest Notion of his Design and Conduct But after all with whatever Judgment and Study a Man may proceed or with whatever Happiness he may perform such a Work he must hope to please but a few those only who have at once a Taste of Poetry and competent Learning For to satisfy such as want either is not in the Nature of this Undertaking since a meer Modern Wit can like nothing that is not  Modern  and a Pedant nothing that is not  Greek  What I have done is submitted to the Publick from whose Opinions I am prepared to learn tho' I fear no Judges so little as our best Poets who are most sensible of the Weight of this Task As for the worst whatever they shall please to say they may give me some Concern as they are unhappy Men but none as they are malignant Writers I was guided in this Translation by Judgments very different from theirs and by Persons for whom they can have no Kindness if an  old Observation be true that the strongest Antipathy in the World is that of Fools to Men of Wit Mr  Addison  was the first whose Advice determin'd me to undertake this Task who was pleas'd to write to me upon that Occasion in such Terms as I cannot repeat without Vanity I was obliged to Sir  Richard Steele  for a very early Recommendation of my Undertaking to the Publick Dr  Swift  promoted my Interest with that Warmth with which he always serves his Friend The Humanity and Frankness of Sir  Samuel Garth  are what I never knew wanting on any Occasion I must also acknowledge with infinite Pleasure the many friendly Offices as well as sincere Criticisms of Mr  Congreve  who had led me the way in translating some Parts of  Homer  as I wish for the sake of the World he had prevented me in the rest I must add the Names of Mr  Rowe  and Dr  Parnell  tho' I shall take a farther Opportunity of doing Justice to the last whose Goodnature to give it a great Panegyrick is no less extensive than his Learning The Favour of these Gentlemen is not entirely undeserved by one who bears them so true an Affection But what can I say of the Honour so many of the  Great  have done me while the  First Names  of the Age appear as my Subscribers and the most distinguish'd Patrons and Ornaments of Learning as my chief Encouragers Among these it is a particular Pleasure to me to find that my highest Obligations are to such who have done most Honour  to the Name of Poet That his Grace the  Duke  of  Buckingham  was not displeas'd I should undertake the Author to whom he has given in his excellent  Essay  the finest Praise he ever yet receiv'd  Read  Homer once  and you can read no more  For all things else appear so mean and poor  Verse will seem Prose yet  often  on him look  And you will hardly need another Book  That the Earl of  Halifax  was one of the first to favour me of whom it is hard to say whether the Advancement of the Polite Arts is more owing to his Generosity or his Example That such a Genius as my Lord  Bolingbroke  not more distinguished in the great Scenes of Business than in all the useful and entertaining Parts of Learning has not refus'd to be the Critick of these Sheets and the Patron of their Writer And that so excellent an Imitator of  Homer  as the noble Author of the Tragedy of  Heroic Love  has continu'd his Partiality to me from my writing Pastorals to my attempting the  Iliad  I cannot deny my self the Pride of confessing that I have had the Advantage not only of their Advice for the Conduct in general but their Correction of several Particulars of this Translation  I could say a great deal of the Pleasure of being distinguish'd by the  Earl  of  Carnarvon  but it is almost absurd to particularize any one generous  Action in a Person whose whole Life is a continued Series of them The Right Honourable Mr  Stanhope  the present Secretary of State will pardon my Desire of having it known that he was pleas'd to promote this Affair The particular Zeal of Mr  Harcourt  the Son of the late Lord Chancellor gave me a Proof how much I am honour'd in a Share of his Friendship I must attribute to the same Motive that of several others of my Friends to whom all Acknowledgments are render'd unnecessary by the Privileges of a familiar Correspondence And I am satisfy'd I can no way better oblige Men of their Turn than by my Silence  In short I have found more Patrons than ever  Homer  wanted He would have thought himself happy to have met the same Favour at  Athens  that has been shewn me by its learned Rival the University of  Oxford  If my Author had the  Wits  of AfterAges for his Defenders his Translator has had the  Beauties  of the present for his Advocates a Pleasure too great to be changed for any Fame in Reversion And I can hardly envy him those pompous Honours he receiv'd after Death when I reflect on the Enjoyment of so many agreeable Obligations and easy Friendships which make the Satisfaction of Life This Distinction is the more to be acknowledg'd as it is shewn to one whose Pen has never gratify'd the Prejudices of particular  Parties  or the Vanities of particular  Men  Whatever the Success may  prove I shall never repent of an Undertaking in which I have experienc'd the Candour and Friendship of so many Persons of Merit and in which I hope to pass some of those Years of Youth that are generally lost in a Circle of Follies after a manner neither wholly unuseful to others nor disagreeable to my self  ΟΜΗΡΟʗ ΑΜΑʗΤΡΙʗ  ΟΜΗΡΟʗ ΝΩΙΞ  ΚΟΥΜΕΝΕ ΚΡΟΝΟΣ ΙΑΙΑΣ ΟΔΥΣΣΕΙΑ

HOMERICA  PHRYGIA cum Oris Maritimus  AN ESSAY ON THE LIFE WRITINGS and LEARNING OF HOMER  THERE is something in the Mind of Man which goes beyond bare Curiosity and even carries us on to a Shadow of Friendship with those great Genius's whom we have known to excel in former Ages Nor will it appear less to any one who considers how much it partakes of the Nature of Friendship how it compounds itself of an Admiration rais'd by what we meet with concerning them a Tendency to be farther acquainted with them by gathering every Circumstance of their Lives a kind of Complacency in their Company when we retire to enjoy what they have left an Union with them in those Sentiments they approve and an Endeavour to defend them when we think they are injuriously attack'd or even sometimes with too partial an Affection  There is also in Mankind a Spirit of Envy or Opposition which makes them uneasy to see others of the same Species  seated far above them in a sort of Perfection And this at least so far as we speak of the Fame of Writers has not always been known to dye with a Man entirely but to pursue his Remains with idle Traditions and weak Conjectures so that his Name which is not to be forgotten shall be preserv'd only to be stain'd and blotted The Controversy which was carry'd on between the Author and his Enemies while he yet was living shall still be kept on foot not entirely upon his own account but on theirs who live after him some being fond to praise extravagantly and others as rashly eager to contradict his Admirers This Proceeding on both sides gives us an Image of the first Descriptions of War such as the  Iliad  affords where a Heroe disputes the Field with an Army 'til it is his time to dye and then the Battel which we expected to fall of course is renew'd about the Body his Friends contending that they may embalm and honour it his Enemies that they may cast it to the Dogs and Vultures  There are yet others of a low kind of Taste who without any Malignity to the Character of a great Author lessen the Dignity of their Subject by insisting too meanly upon little Particularities They imagine it the Part of an Historian to omit nothing they meet concerning him whom they write upon and gather every thing wherein he is nam'd without any distinction to the Prejudice or Neglect of the more noble Parts of his Character Like those trifling Painters or Sculptors who bestow infinite Pains and Patience upon the most insignificant Parts of a Figure 'till they sink the Grandeur of the Whole by finishing every thing with the neatest Want of Judgment  Besides these there is a fourth sort of Men who pretend to divest themselves of impetuous Emotions on both sides and to get above that imperfect Idea of their Subject which little Writers fall into who propose to themselves a calm Search after Truth and a rational Adherence to Probability in their historical Collections Who neither wish to be led into the Fables of Poetry nor are willing to support the Falsehoods of a malignant Criticism but endeavouring to steer in a middle way have obtain'd a Character of failing least in the Choice of Materials for History even from the darkest Ages  Being therefore to write something concerning a Life which there is little Prospect of our knowing after it has been the fruitless Enquiry of so many Ages and which has however been thus differently treated by Historians I shall endeavour to speak of it not as a Certainty but as the Tradition Opinion or Collection of Authors who have been suppos'd to write of  Homer  in these four preceding Methods to which we shall also add some farther Conjectures of our own After his Life has been thus rather spoken of than discover'd I shall consider him historically as an Author with regard to those Works which he has left behind him In doing which we may trace the degrees of Esteem they have obtain'd in different Periods of Time and regulate our present Opinion of them by a View of that Age in which they were written  I  Stories of  Homer  which are the Effects of  extravagant Admiration  I If we take a View of  Homer  in those fabulous Traditions which the Admiration of the ancient Heathens has occasion'd we find them running to Superstition and multiply'd and independent on one another in the different Accounts which are given with respect to  Aegypt  and  Greece  the two native Countreys of Fable  We have one in  Eustathius  in Od    Eustathius  most strangely fram'd which  Alexander Paphius  has reported concerning  Homer  's Birth and Infancy That  "He was born in  Aegypt  of  Dmasagoras  and  Aethra  and brought up by a Daughter of  Orus  the Priest of  Isis  who was herself a Prophetess and from whose Breasts Drops of Honey would frequently distil into the Mouth of the Infant In the Nighttime the first Sounds he utter'd were the Notes of nine several Birds In the Morning he was found playing with nine Doves in the Bed The  Sybil  who attended him us'd to be seiz'd with a poetical Fury and utter Verses in which she commanded  Dmasagoras  to build a Temple to the Muses This he perform'd in Obedience to her Inspiration and related all these things to the Child when he was grown up who in Memory of the Doves which play'd with him during his Infancy has in his Works prefer'd this Bird to the Honour of bringing  Ambrosia  to  Jupiter  "  One would think a Story of this Nature so fit for Age to talk of and Infancy to hear were incapable of being handed down to us But we find the Tradition again taken up to be heighten'd in one part and carry'd forward in another  Heliod Aethiop  l    Heliodorus  who had heard of this Claim which  Aegypt  put in for  Homer  endeavours to strengthen it by naming  Thebes  for the particular place of his Birth He allows too that a Priest was his reputed Father but that his real Father according to the Opinion of  Aegypt  was  Mercury  He says  "That when the Priest was celebrating the Rites of his Countrey and therefore slept with his Wife in the Temple the God had knowledge of her and begot  Homer  That he was born with Tufts of Hair on his  Femur  Thigh as a Sign of unlawful Generation from whence he was called  Homer  by the Nations through which he wander'd That he himself was the occasion why this Story of his divine Extraction is unknown because he neither told his Name Race nor Countrey being asham'd of his Exile to which his reputed Father drove him from among the consecrated Youths on account of that Mark which their Priests esteem'd a Testimony of an incestuous Birth"  These are the extravagant Stories by which Men who have not been able to express how much they admire him transcend the Bounds of Probability to say something extraordinary The Mind that becomes dazled with the Sight of his Performances loses the common Idea of a Man in the fansy'd Splendor of Perfection It sees nothing less than a God worthy to be his Father nothing less than a Prophetess deserving to be his Nurse and growing unwilling that he should be spoken of in a Language beneath its Imaginations delivers Fables in the place of History  But whatever has thus been offer'd to support the Claim of  Aegypt  they who plead for  Greece  are not to be accus'd for coming short of it Their Fansie rose with a Refinement above what we are suppos'd to have of their Masters and frequently the Veil of Fiction is wrought fine enough to be seen through so that it hardly hides the Meaning it is made to cover from the first Glance of the Imagination For a Proof of this we may  mention that Poetical Genealogy which is deliver'd for  Homer  's in the  Greek  Treatise of the Contention between him and  Hesiod  and but little vary'd by the Relation of it in  Suidas  "The Poet  Linus  say they was born of  Apollo  and  Thoose  the Daughter of  Neptune Pierus  of  Linus Oeagrus  of King  Pierus  and the Nymph  Methone Orpheus  of  Oeagrus  and the Muse  Calliope  From  Orpheus  came  Othrys  from him  Harmonides  from him  Philoterpus  from him  Euphemus  from him  Epiphrades  who begot  Menalops  the Father of  Dius Dius  had  Hesiod  the Poet and  Perses  by  Pucamede  the Daughter of  Apollo  Then  Perses  had  Maeon  on whose Daughter  Crytheis  the River  Meles  begot  Homer  "  Here we behold a wonderful Genealogy contriv'd industriously to raise our Idea to the highest where Gods Goddesses Muses Kings and Poets link in a descent nay where Poets are made to depend as it were in Clusters upon the same Stalk beneath one another If we consider too that  Harmonides  is deriv'd from Harmony  Philoterpus  from love of Delight  Euphemus  from beautiful Diction  Epiphrades  from Intelligence and  Pucamede  from Prudence it may not be improbable but the Inventors meant by a Fiction of this Nature to turn such Qualifications into Persons as were agreeable to his Character for whom the Line was drawn So that every thing Divine or Great will thus come together by the extravagant Indulgence of Fancy while it turns itself sometimes to Admiration and sometimes to Allegory  After this fabulous Tree of his Pedigree we may regularly view him in one Passage concerning his Birth which though it differs in a Circumstance from what has been here deliver'd yet carries on the same Air and regards the same Traditions There is a short Life of  Homer  attributed to  Plutarch  wherein a third part of  Aristotle  on Poetry which is now lost is quoted for an account of his uncommon Birth in this manner  "At the time when  Neleus  the Son of  Codrus  led the Colony which was sent into  Ionia  there was in the Island of  Io  a young Girl compress'd by a  Genius  who delighted to associate with the  Muses  and share in their Consorts She finding  herself with Child and being touch'd with the Shame of what had happen'd to her remov'd from thence to a Place call'd  Aegina  There she was taken in an Excursion made by Robbers and being brought to  Smyrna  which was then under the  Lydians  they gave her to  Maeon  the King who marry'd her upon account of her Beauty But while she walk'd on the Bank of the River  Meles  she brought forth  Homer  and expir'd The Infant was taken by  Maeon  and bred up as his Son 'till the Death of that Prince"  And from this Point of the Story the Poet is let down into his traditional Poverty Here we see tho' he be taken out of the Lineage of  Meles  where we met him before he has still as wonderful a Rise invented for him he is still to spring from a  Demigod  one who was of a Poetical Disposition from whom he might inherit a Soul turn'd to Poetry and receive an Assistance of heavenly Inspiration  In his Life the most general Tradition concerning him is his  Blindness  yet there are some who will not allow even this to have happen'd after the manner in which it falls upon other Men Chance and Sickness are excluded nothing less than Gods and Heroes must be visibly concern'd about him Thus we find among the different Accounts which  Hermias  in Phaed Plat  Leo Allat  de Patr Hom C  Hermias  has collected concerning his Blindness that when  Homer  resolv'd to write of  Achilles  he had an exceeding Desire to fill his Mind with a just Idea of so glorious a Heroe Wherefore having paid all due Honours at his Tomb he intreats that he may obtain a sight of him The Heroe grants his Poet's Petition and rises in a glorious Suit of Armour which cast so unsufferable a Splendor that  Homer  lost his Eyes while he gaz'd for the Enlargement of his Notions  If this be any thing more than a meer Fable one would be apt to imagine it insinuated his contracting a Blindness by too intense an Application while he wrote his  Iliad  But it is a very pompous way of letting us into the Knowledge of so short a Truth It looks as if Men imagin'd the Lives of Poets should be Poetically written that to speak plainly of them were to speak contemptibly or that we debase them when they are  plac'd in less glorious Company than those exalted Spirits which they themselves have been fond to celebrate We may however in some measure be reconcil'd to this last idle Fable for having occasion'd so beautiful an  Episode  in the  Ambra  of  Politian  That which does not inform us in a History may please us in its proper Sphere of Poetry  II  Stories of  Homer  proceeding from  Envy  II Such Stories as these have been the Effects of a superstitious Fondness and of our Astonishment at what we consider in a View of Perfection But neither have all Men the same Taste nor do they equally submit to the Superiority of others nor bear that human Nature which they know to be imperfect should be prais'd in an Extream without opposition From some Principles of this kind have arisen a second sort of Stories which glance at  Homer  with malignant Suppositions and endeavour to throw a diminishing Air over his Life as a kind of Answer to those who sought to aggrandize him injudiciously  Under this Head we may reckon those ungrounded Conjectures with which his Adversaries asperse the very Design and Prosecution of his Travels when they insinuate that they were one continued Search after Authors who had written before him and particularly upon the same Subject in order to destroy them or to rob them of their Inventions  Thus we read in  Diod Sic  l    Diodorus Siculus  "That there was one  Daphne  the Daughter of  Tiresias  who from her Inspirations obtain'd the Title of a  Sybil  She had a very extraordinary Genius and being made Priestess at  Delphos  wrote Oracles with wonderful Elegance which  Homer  sought for and adorn'd his Poems with several of her Verses"  But she is plac'd so far in the fabulous Age of the World that nothing can be averr'd of her And as for the Verses now ascrib'd to the  Sybils  they are more modern than to be able to confirm the Story which as it is universally assented to discovers that whatever there is in them in common with  Homer  the Compilers have rather taken from him perhaps to strengthen the Authority of their Work by the Protection of this Tradition  The next Insinuation we hear is from  Suidas  that  Palamedes  who fought at  Troy  was famous for Poetry and wrote concerning that War in the  Dorick  Letter which he invented probably much against  Agamemnon  and  Ulysses  his mortal Enemies Upon this Account some have fancy'd his Works were suppress'd by  Agamemnon  's Posterity or that their entire Destruction was contriv'd and effected by  Homer  when he undertook the same Subject But surely the Works of so considerable a Man when they had been able to bear up so long a time as that which pass'd between the Siege of  Troy  and the flourishing of  Homer  must have been too much dispers'd for one of so mean a Condition as he is represented to have destroy'd in every place tho' he had been never so much assisted by the vigilant Temper of Envy And we may say too that what might have been capable of raising this Principle in him must be capable of being in some measure esteem'd and of having at least one Line of it preserv'd to us  After him in the order of time we meet with a whole Set of Names to whom the Maligners of  Homer  would have him oblig'd without being able to prove their Assertion  Suidas  mentions  Corinnus Iliensis  the Secretary of  Palamedes  who writ a Poem upon the same Subject but no one is produc'd as having seen it  Tzetzes  Chil    Hist    Tzetzes  mentions and from  Johannes Melala  only  Sisyphus  the  Coan  Secretary of  Teucer  but it is not so much as known if he writ Verse or Prose Besides these are  Dictys  the  Cretan  Secretary to  Idomeneus  and  Dares  the  Phrygian  an Attendant of  Hector  who have spurious Treatises passing under their Names From each of these is  Homer  said to have borrow'd his whole Argument so inconsistent are these Stories with one another  The next Names we find are  Demodocus  whom  Homer  might have met at  Corcyra  and  Phemius  whom he might have met at  Ithaca  the one as  Plutarch  on Musick  Plutarch  says having according to Tradition written the War at  Troy  the other the  Return  of the  Grecian  Captains But these are only two Names of Friends which he is pleas'd to honour with Eternity in his Poem or two different Pictures of himself as Author of the  Iliad  and  Odysses  or entirely the Children of his Imagination without any particular Allusion So that his Usage here puts me in mind of his own  Vulcan  in the  Iliad  Iliad  The God had cast two Statues which he endued with the Power of Motion and it is said presently after that he is scarce able to go unless they support him  It is reported by some says  Ptol Eph  Excerpt apud Photium l    Ptolomaeus Ephestio  "That there was before  Homer  a Woman of  Memphis  call'd  Phantasia  who writ of the Wars of  Troy  and the Wandrings of  Ulysses  Now  Homer  arriving at  Memphis  where she had laid up her Works and getting acquainted with  Phanitas  whose Business it was to copy the sacred Writings he obtain'd a sight of these and follow'd entirely the Scheme she had drawn"  But this is a wild Story which speaks of an  Aegyptian  Woman with a  Greek  Name and who never was heard of but upon this account It appears indeed from his Knowledge of the  Aegyptian  Learning that he was initiated into their Mysteries and for ought we know by one  Phanitas  But if we consider what the Name of the Woman signifies it seems only as if from being us'd in a figurative Expression it had been mistaken afterwards for a proper Name And then the Meaning will be that having gather'd as much Information concerning the  Grecian  and  Trojan  Story as he could be furnish'd with from the Accounts of  Aegypt  which were generally mix'd with Fancy and Fable he wrought out his Plans of the  Iliad  and the  Odysses  We pass all these Stories together with the  little Iliad  of  Siagrus  mention'd by  Aelian  l    c    Aelian  But one cannot leave this Subject without reflecting on the depreciating Humour and odd Industry of Man which shews itself in raising such a Number of Insinuations that clash with each other and in spiriting up such a Crowd of unwarranted Names to support them Nor can we but admire at the contradictory Nature of this Proceeding that Names of Works which either never were in Being or never worthy to live should be produc'd only to persuade us that the most lasting and beautiful Poem of the Ancients was taken out of them A Beggar might be content to patch up a Garment  with such Shreds as the World throws away but it is never to be imagin'd an Emperor would make his Robes of them  After  Homer  had spent a considerable time in Travel we find him towards his Age introduc'd to such an Action as tends to his Disparagement It is not enough to accuse him for spoiling the dead they raise a living Author by whom he must be baffled in that Qualification on which his Fame is founded  There is in  Hesiod  Op dicrum l    v  c  Hesiod  an Account of an ancient Poetical Contention at the Funeral of  Amphidamas  in which he says he obtain'd the Prize but does not mention from whom he carry'd it There is also among the  Hom  Hymn    ad Venerem  Hymns  ascribed to  Homer  a Prayer to  Venus  for Success in a Poetical Dispute but it neither mentions where nor against whom But though they have neglected to name their Antagonists others have since taken care to fill up the Stories by putting them together The making two such considerable Names in Poetry engage carries an amusing Pomp in it like making two Heroes of the first Rank enter the Lists of Combat And if  Homer  and  Hesiod  had their Parties among the  Grammarians  here was an excellent Opportunity for  Hesiod  's Favourers to make a Sacrifice of  Homer  Hence might a bare Conjecture spread into a  Tradition  then the Tradition give occasion to an  Epigram  which is yet extant and again the  Epigram  for want of knowing the Time it was writ in be alledg'd as a  Proof  of that Conjecture from whence it sprung After this a  whole Treatise was written upon it which appears not very ancient because it mentions  Adrian  The Story agrees in the main with the short Account we find in  Plut  Banquet of the seven wise Men  Plutarch  "That  Ganictor  the Son of  Amphidamas  King of  Euboea  being us'd to celebrate his Father's funeral Games invited from all Parts Men famous for Strength and Wisdom Among these  Homer  and  Hesiod  arriv'd at  Chalcis  The King  Panidas  presided over the Contest which being finish'd he decreed the  Tripos  to  Hesiod  with this Elogy in the Sentence That the Poet of Peace and Husbandry better deserv'd to be crown'd than he who stirs us up to War and Contention  Whereupon  Hesiod  dedicated the Prize to the Muses with this Inscription  "  "  "  Which are two Lines taken from that Place in  Hesiod  where he mentions no Antagonist and alter'd that the two Names might be brought in as is evident by comparing them with these  To answer this Story we take notice that  Hesiod  is generally plac'd after  Homer Graevius  his own Commentator sets him a hundred Years lower and whether he were so or no yet  Plut  Symp l  §  Plutarch  has slightly pass'd the whole Account as a Fable Nay we may draw an Argument against it from  Hesiod  himself He had a Love of Fame which caus'd him to engage at the Funeral Games and which went so far as to make him record his Conquest in his own Works Had he defeated  Homer  the same Principle would have made him mention a Name that could have secur'd his own to Immortality A Poet who records his Glory would not omit the noblest Circumstance and  Homer  like a Captive Prince had certainly grac'd the Triumph of his Adversary  Towards the latter end of his Life there is another Story invented which makes him conclude it in a manner altogether beneath the Greatness of a Genius We find in the Life said to be written by  Plutarch  a Tradition  "That he was warn'd by an Oracle to beware of the young Mens Riddle This remain'd long obscure to him 'til he arriv'd at the Island  Io  There as he sat to behold the Fishermen they propos'd to him a Riddle in Verse which he being unable to answer dy'd for Grief"  This Story refutes itself by carrying Superstition at one end and Folly at the other It seems conceiv'd with an Air of Derision to lay a great Man in the  Dust after a foolish Manner The same sort of Hand might have fram'd that Tale of  Aristotle  's drowning himself because he could not account for the  Euripus  The Design is the same the Turn the same and all the difference that the great Men are each to suffer in his Character the one by a  Poetical Riddle  the other by a  Philosophical Problem  But these are Actions which can only proceed from the Meanness of Pride or Extravagance of Madness A Soul enlarg'd with Knowledge so vastly as was that of  Homer  better knows the proper Stress which is to be laid upon every Incident and the Proportion of Concern or Carelesness with which it ought to be affected But it is the Fate of narrow Capacities to measure Mankind by a false Standard and imagine the Great like themselves capable of being disconcerted by little Occasions to frame their malignant Fables according to this Imagination and to stand detected by it as by an evident Mark of Ignorance  III  Stories of  Homer  proceeding from  trifling Curiosity  III The third Manner in which the Life of  Homer  has been written is but a heaping of all the Traditions and Hints which the Writers could meet with great or little in order to tell a Story of him to the World Perhaps the want of choice Materials might put them upon the Necessity or perhaps an injudicious Desire of saying all they could occasion'd the fault However it be a Life compos'd of trivial Circumstances which tho' it give a true account of several Passages has but little of that Appearance in which a Man was most famous and hardly any thing correspondent to the Idea we entertain of him Such a Life I say will never answer rightly the demand the World has upon an Historian Yet the most formal Account we have of  Homer  is of this Nature I mean that which is said to be collected by  Herodotus  It is in short an unsupported minute Treatise compos'd of Events which lie within the Compass of Probability and belong to the lowest Sphere of Life It seems through all its Frame to be entirely conducted by the Spirit of a  Grammarian  ever abounding with  extempore Verses  as if it were to prove a thing so unquestionable as our Author's Title to Rapture and at the same time the Occasions are so poorly invented that they misbecome the Warmth of a Poetical Imagination There is nothing in it above the Life which a  Grammarian  might lead  himself nay it is but such an one as they commonly do lead the highest Stage of which is to be  Master of a School  But because this is a Treatise to which Writers have had recourse for want of a better I shall give the following Abstract  Homer  was born at  Smyrna  about one hundred sixty eight Years after the Siege of  Troy  and six hundred twenty two Years before the  Expedition  of  Xerxes  His Mother's Name was  Crytheis  who proving unlawfully with Child was sent away from  Cumae  by her Uncle with  Ismenias  one of those who led the Colony to  Smyrna  then building A while after as she was celebrating a Festival with other Women on the Banks of the River  Meles  she was deliver'd of  Homer  whom she therefore nam'd  Melesigenes  Upon this she left  Ismenias  and supported herself by Working 'til  Phemius  who taught a School in  Smyrna  fell in love with her and marry'd her But both dying in process of Time the School fell to  Homer  who manag'd it with such Wisdom that he was universally admir'd both by Natives and Strangers Amongst these latter was  Mentes  a Master of a Ship from  Leucadia  by whose Persuasions and Promises he gave up his School and went to travel With him he visited  Spain  and  Italy  but was left behind at  Ithaca  upon account of a Defluxion in his Eyes During his Stay he was entertain'd by one  Mentor  a Man of Fortune Justice and Hospitality and learn'd the principal Incidents of  Ulysses  's Life But at the Return of  Mentes  he went from thence to  Colophon  where his Defluxion renewing he fell entirely blind Upon this he could think of no better Expedient than to go back to  Smyrna  where perhaps he might be supported by those who knew him and have the leisure to addict himself to Poetry But there he found his Poverty encrease and his hopes of Encouragement fail so that he remov'd for  Cumae  and by the way was entertain'd for some time at the House of one  Tychius  a LeatherDresser At  Cumae  his Poems were wonderfully admir'd but when he propos'd to eternize their Town if they would allow him a Sallary he was answer'd That there would be no end of maintaining all the  or  blind Men  and hence he got the Name of  Homer  From  Cumae  he went to  Phocaea  where one  Thestorides  a Schoolmaster also offer'd to maintain him if he would suffer him to transcribe his Verses This  Homer  complying with for meer Necessity the other had no sooner gotten them but he remov'd to  Chois  There the Poems gain'd him Wealth and Honour while the Author himself hardly earn'd his Bread by repeating them At last some who came from  Chios  having told the People that the same Verses were publish'd there by a Schoolmaster  Homer  resolv'd to find him out Having therefore landed near that Place he was receiv'd by one  Glaucus  a Shepherd at whose Door he had like to have been worried by Dogs and carry'd by him to his Master at  Bollissus  who admiring his Knowledge entrusted him with the Education of his Children Here his Praise began to spread and  Thestorides  who heard of his Neighbourhood fled before him He remov'd however some time afterwards to  Chois  where he set up a School of Poetry gain'd a competent Fortune marry'd a Wife and had two Daughters the one of which dy'd young the other was marry'd to his Patron at  Bollissus  Here he inserted in his Poems the Names of those to whom he had been most oblig'd as  Mentes Phemius Mentor  and  Tychius  and resolving for  Athens  he made honourable mention of that City to prepare the  Athenians  for a kind Reception But as he went the Ship put in at  Samos  where he continu'd the whole Winter singing at the Houses of great Men with a Train of Boys after him In Spring he went on board again in order to prosecute his Journey to  Athens  but landing by the way at  Ios  he fell sick dy'd and was bury'd on the SeaShore  This is the Life of  Homer  ascrib'd to  Herodotus  tho' it is wonderful it should be so since it evidently contradicts his own  History  by placing  Homer  six hundred twenty two Years before the Expedition of  Xerxes  whereas  Herodotus  himself who was alive at the time of that Expedition says  Homer  was only  Herod  l    four hundred Years before him However if we can imagin that there may be any thing of Truth in the main Parts of this Treatise we may gather these general Observations from it That he shew'd a great Thirst of Knowledge by undertaking such long and numerous Travels That he manifested an unexampled Vigor of Mind by being able to write with more Fire under the Disadvantages of Blindness and the utmost Poverty  than any Poet after him in better Circumstances And that he had an unlimited Sense of Fame the Attendant of noble Spirits which prompted him to engage in new Travels both under these Disadvantages and the additional Burthen of old Age  But it will not perhaps be either improper or difficult to make some Conjectures which seem to lay open the Foundation from whence the Traditions which frame the low Lives of  Homer  have arisen In the first place we may consider That there are no Historians of his Time or none handed down to us who have mention'd him and that he has never spoken plainly of himself in those Works which have been ascrib'd to him without Controversy However an eager Desire to know something concerning him has occasion'd Mankind to labour the Point under these Disadvantages and turn on all Hands to see if there were any thing left which might have the least Appearance of Information Upon the Search they find no Remains but his  Name  and  Works  and resolve to torture these upon the Rack of Invention in order to give some account of the Person they belong to  The first Thing therefore they settle is That what pass'd for his  Name  must be his  Name  no longer but an  additional Title  us'd instead of it The reason why it was given must be some Accident of his Life Having thus found an end of the Clue they proceed to consider every thing that the word may imply by its Derivation One finds that  signifies a  Thigh  whence arises the Tradition in  Hel  l    Heliodorus  that he was banish'd  Aegypt  for the Mark on that Part which shew'd a spurious Birth and this they imagine ground enough to give him the Life of a Wanderer A second finds that  signifies an  Hostage  and then he must be deliver'd as such in a War according to  Proc  vis  Hom  Proclus  between  Smyrna  and  Chios  A third can derive the Name    non videns  from whence he must be a  blind Man  as in the Piece ascrib'd to  Herod  vit  Hom  Herodotus  A fourth brings him from    speaking  in  Council  and then as it is in  Suidas  he must by a divine Inspiration declare to the  Smyrnaeans  that they should war against  Colophon  A fifth finds the word may be brought to signify  following others  or  joining himself  to them and then he must be call'd  Homer  for saying as it is quoted from  Plut  vit  Hom  Aristotle  in the Life ascrib'd to  Plutarch  that he would  or  follow  the  Lydians  from  Smyrna  Thus has the Name been turn'd and winded enough at least to give a Suspicion that he who got a  new Etymology  got a handle either for a  new Life  of him or something which he added to the old one  However the  Name  itself not affording enough to furnish out a whole Life his  Works  must be brought in for Assistance and it is taken for granted That where he has not spoken of himself he lies veil'd beneath the Persons or Actions of those whom he describes Because he calls a Poet by the Name of  Phemius  in his  Odysses  they conclude this  Herod  vit  Hom  Phemius  was his Master Because he speaks of  Demodocus  as another Poet who was blind and frequented Palaces he must be sent about  Ibid  blind to sing at the Doors of rich Men If  Ulysses  be set upon by Dogs at his Shepherd's Cottage because this is a low Adventure it is thought to be his own at  Bollissus  Ibid  And if he calls the Leatherdresser who made  Ajax  's Shield by the Name of  Tychius  he has been supported by such an one in his Wants Nay some have been so violently carry'd into this way of conjecturing that the bare  Vid M  Dacier  's Life of  Homer  Simile  of a Woman who works hard for her Livelihood is said to have been borrow'd from his Mother's Condition and brought as a Proof of it Thus he is still imagin'd to intend himself and the Fictions of Poetry converted into real Facts are deliver'd for his Life who has assign'd them to others All those Stories in his Works which suit with a mean Condition are suppos'd to have happen'd to him tho' the same way of Inference might as well prove him to have acted in a higher Sphere from the many Passages that shew his Skill in Government and his Knowledge of the great Parts of Life  There are some other scatter'd Stories of  Homer  which fall not under these Heads but are however of as trifling a Nature as much unfit for the Materials of History still more ungrounded if possible and arising merely from Chance or the Humours of Men Such is the Report we meet with from  Diogenes Lacrtius  ex  Heracl  in vita  Socratis  Heraclides  That  "  Homer  was fin'd at  Athens  for a Madman"  which seems invented by the Disciples of  Socrates  to cast an Odium upon the  Athenians  for their consenting to the Death of their Master and carries in it something like a declaiming Revenge of the Schools as if the World should imagine the  one  could be esteem'd  mad  where the  other  was put to Death for being  wicked  Such another Report is that in  Aelian  l    cap    Aelian  That  "  Homer  portion'd his Daughter with some of his Works for want of Money"  which looks but like a Whim deliver'd in the Gaiety of Fancy a Jest upon a poor Wit which at first might have had an Epigrammatist for its Father and been afterwards gravely understood by some painful Collector In short Mankind have labour'd heartily about him to no purpose they have caught up every thing greedily with that busy minute Curiosity and unsatisfactory Inquisitiveness which  Seneca  calls the  Disease of the  Greeks they have puzzled the Cause by their Attempts to find it out and like Travellers entirely destitute of a Road yet resolv'd to make it over unpassable Deserts they superinduce Error instead of removing Ignorance  IV  Probable Conjectures concerning  Homer  IV Whenever Men have set themselves to write a Life of  Homer  clear from Superstition Envy and Trifling they have grown asham'd of all these Traditions This however has not occasion'd every one to desist from the Undertaking but still the Difficulty which could not make them desist has necessitated them either to deliver the old Story with Excuses or else instead of a Life to compose a Treatise partly of  Criticism  and partly of  Character  rather descriptive than supported by Action and the Air of History  His  Time  They begin with letting us know that the  Time  in which he liv'd has never been fix'd beyond dispute and that the Opinions of Authors are various concerning it But the Controversy in its several Conjectures includes a Space of Years between the earliest and latest from twenty four to about five hundred after the Siege of  Troy  Whenever the Time was it seems not to have been near that Siege from his own    Iliad    Invocation  of the  Muses  to recount the Catalogue of the Ships  "For  we says he have only heard a Rumour and know nothing particularly"  It is remark'd by  Hic longe à temporibus belli quod composuit Troici quàm quidam rentur abfuit Nam fermè ante annos floruit intra mille natus est quo nomine non est mirandum quod saepe illud usurpat  Hôc enim ut  hominum  ita  saeculorum  notatur differentia  Vell Paterc  lib  Velleius Paterculus  That it must have been considerably later from his own Confession that Mankind was but half as strong in his Age as in that he writ of which as it is founded upon a Notion of a gradual Degeneracy in our Nature discovers the Interval to have been long between  Homer  and his Subject But not to trouble our selves with entring into all the dry Dispute we may here take notice that the World is inclin'd to stand by the  Vide  Dacier Du Pin  c concerning the  Arundelian Marble  Arundelian Marble  as the most certain Computation of those early Times and this by placing him at the time when  Diognetus  rul'd in  Athens  makes him flourish a little before the  Olympiads  were establish'd about three hundred Years after the taking of  Troy  and near a thousand before the  Christian Aera  For a farther Confirmation of this we have some great Names of Antiquity who give him a Cotemporary agreeing with the Computation  Cicero  Qu Tuscul l    Cicero  says There was a Tradition that  Homer  liv'd about the time of  Lycurgus  Strabo  l    Strabo  tells us It was reported that  Lycurgus  went to  Chios  for an Interview with him And even  Plut  vitâ  Lycurgi  Plutarch  when he says  Lycurgus  receiv'd  Homer  's Works from the Grandson of that  Creophilus  with whom he had liv'd does not put him so far backward but that possibly they might have been alive together  His  Country  The next Dispute regards his  Country  concerning which    of  Adrian  's Oracle  Adrian  enquir'd of the Gods as a Question not to be settled by Men and  Appion  according to  Plin  l    cap    Pliny  rais'd a Spirit for his Information That which has encreas'd the difficulty is the Number of contesting Places of which  Suidas  has reckon'd up nineteen in one Breath But his ancient Commentator  Seneca  Ep    concerning  Didymus  Didymus  found the Subject so fertile as to employ a great Part of his four thousand Volumes upon it There is a Prophecy of the  Sybils  that he should be born at  Salamis  in  Cyprus  and then to play an Argument of the same Nature against it there is the  Oracle  given to  Adrian  afterwards that says he was born in  Ithaca  There are  Customs  of  Aeolia  and  Aegypt  cited from his Works to make out by turns and with the same Probability that he belong'd to each of them There was a School shew'd for his at  Colophon  and a  Tomb  at  Io  both of equal Strength to prove he had his Birth in either As for the  Athenians  they challeng'd him as born where they had a  Colony  or else in behalf of  Greece  in general and as the  Metropolis  of its Learning they made his Name free of their City  qu Liciniâ Mutiâ lege  says  Politian  Pref in  Homerum  Politian  after the manner of that Law by which all  Italy  became free of  Rome  All these have their Authors to record their Titles but still the Weight of the Question seems to lie between  Smyrna  and  Chios  which we must therefore take a little more notice of That  Homer  then was born at  Smyrna  is endeavour'd to be prov'd by an  Epigram  on  Pisistratus  in the anonymous Life before  Homer  Epigram  recorded to have been under the Statue of  Pisistratus  at  Athens  by the Reports mention'd in  Cicero Strabo  and  A Gellius  and by the Greek Lives which are prefix'd to him with the Names of  Herodotus Plutarch  and  Proclus  as also the two that are anonymous For this the  Vitruvius Proem  l    Smyrnaeans  built him a Temple cast Medals of him and grew so possest of his having been theirs that it is said they burn'd  Zoilus  for affronting them in the Person of  Homer  On the other hand the  Chians  plead the ancient Authorities of  Simonides  Frag de brevitat Vitae quoting a Verse of  Homer  Simonides  and  Theocritus  in  Dioscuris      Theocritus  for his being born among them They mention a Race they had call'd the  Homeridae  whom they reckon'd his Posterity they cast Medals of him they shew to this Day an  Homaerium  or Temple of  Homer  near  Bollissus  and close their Arguments with a Quotation from the  Hymn  to  Apollo  which is acknowledg'd for  Homer  's by  Thucyd  lib    Thucydides  where he calls himself  "The blind Man that inhabits  Chios  "  The Reader has here the Sum of the large Treatise of  Leo Allatius  written particularly  on this Subject  Leo Allatius  de Patria  Homeri  in which after having separately weigh'd the Pretensions of all he concludes for  Chios  For my part I determine nothing in a Point of so much Uncertainty neither which of these was honour'd with his Birth nor whether any of them was nor again whether each may not have produc'd his own  Homer  since  Xenophon  de Aequivocis  Xenophon  says there were many of the Name But one cannot avoid being surpriz'd at the prodigious Veneration of his Character which could engage Mankind with such Eagerness in a Point so little essential that Kings should send to Oracles for the Enquiry of his Birthplace that Cities should be in Strife about it and whole Lives of learned Men employ'd upon it that some should write Treatises concerning it that others should call up Spirits unavailingly that thus in short Heaven Earth and Hell should be sought to for the Decision of a Question which terminates in Curiosity only  His  Parents  If we endeavour to find the  Parents  of  Homer  we immediately perceive the Search is fruitless  Plut  vitâ  Hom  ex  Ephoro  Ephorus  has made  Maeon  to be his Father by a Niece whom he deflour'd and this has so far obtain'd as to give him the derivative Name of  Maeonides  His Mother if we allow the Story of  Maeon  is call'd  Crytheis  But we are lost again in Uncertainty if we search farther for  Suidas  has mention'd  Eumetis  or  Polycaste  and  Pausanias  l    Pausanias Clymene  or  Themisto  which happens because the contesting Countrys find out Mothers of their own for him Tradition has in this case afforded us no more Light than what may serve to shew its Shadows in a Confusion they strike the Sight with so equal a Probability that we are in doubt which to chuse and must pass the Question undecided  His  Name  If we enquire concerning his own  Name  even that is doubted of He has been call'd  Melesigenes  from the River where he was born  Homer  has been reckon'd an ascititious Name from some Accident in his Life The  Certamen Homericum  calls him once  Auletes  perhaps from his musical Genius and  Lucian  's true History l    Lucian Tigranes  it may be from a Confusion with that  Tigranes  or  Suidas  de  Tigrete  Tigretes  who was Brother of Queen  Artemisia  and whose Name has been so far mingled with his as to make him be  esteem'd Author of some of the lesser Works which are ascrib'd to  Homer  It may not be amiss to close these Criticisms with that agreeable Derision wherewith  Lucian  treats the overbusy Humour of Grammarians in their Search after minute and impossible Enquiries when he feigns that he had talk'd over the Point with  Homer  in the  Island of the Blessed  "I ask'd him says he of what Country he was a Question hard to be resolv'd with Us to which he answer'd He could not certainly tell because some had inform'd him that he was of  Chios  some of  Smyrna  and others of  Colophon  but he took himself for a  Babylonian  called  Tigranes  while he liv'd among his Countrymen and  Homer  while he was an Hostage among the  Graecians  "  His  Blindness  At his Birth he appears not to have been  blind  whatever he might be afterwards The  The Medal is exhibited at the beginning of this Essay  Chian  Medal of him which is of great Antiquity according to  Leo Allatius  seats him with a Volume open and reading intently But there is no need of Proofs from Antiquity for that which every Line of his Works will demonstrate With what an Exactness agreeable to the natural Appearance of Things do his Cities stand his Mountains rise his Rivers wind and his Regions lie extended How beautifully are the Surfaces of all things drawn in their Figures and adorn'd with their Paintings What Address in Action what visible Characters of the Passions inspirit his Heroes It is not to be imagin'd that a Man could have been always blind who thus inimitably copies Nature who gives every where the proper Proportion Figure Colour and Life  "  Quem si quis caecum genitum putat  says  Paterculus  l    Paterculus    omnibus sensibus orbus est  "  He must certainly have beheld the Creation consider'd it with a long Attention and enrich'd his Fancy by the most sensible Knowledge of those Ideas which he makes the Reader see while he but describes them  His  Education  and  Master  As he grew forward in Years he was train'd up to Learning if we credit  Diod Sic  l    Diodorus  under one  "  Pronapides  a Man of excellent natural Endowments who taught the  Pelasgick  Letter invented by  Linus  "  From him might he learn to preserve  his Poetry by committing it to Writing which we mention because it is generally believ'd  Joseph  cont  Apion  l    no Poems before his were so preserv'd and he himself in the third Line of his  Batrochomuomachia  if that Piece be allow'd to be his expressly speaks of    Batroch  writing his Works in his  Tablets  His  Travels  When he was of riper Years for his farther Accomplishment and the Gratification of his Thirst of Knowledge he spent a considerable part of his time in travelling Upon which account  Procl  vita  Hom  Proclus  has taken notice that he must have abounded in Riches  "For long Travels says he occasion high Expences and especially at those times when Men could neither sail without imminent Danger and Inconveniences nor had a regulated manner of Commerce with one another"  This way of reasoning appears very probable and if it does not prove him to have been rich it shews him at least to have had Patrons of a generous Spirit who observing the Vastness of his Capacity believ'd themselves beneficent to Mankind while they supported one who seem'd born for something extraordinary  Aegypt  being at that time the Seat of Learning the greatest Wits and Genius's of  Greece  us'd to travel thither Among these  Diod Sic  l    Diodorus  reckons  Homer  and to strengthen his Opinion alledges that Multitude of their Notions which he has receiv'd into his Poetry and of their Customs to which he alludes in his Fictions Such as his  Gods  which are nam'd from the first  Aegyptian Kings  the Number of the  Muses  taken from the  nine Minstrels  which attended  Osyris  the  Feast  wherein they us'd to send their Statues of the Deities into  Aethiopia  and to return after twelve Days and the carrying their  dead Bodies  over the Lake to a pleasant Place call'd  Acherusia  near  Memphis  from whence arose the Stories of  Charon Styx  and  Elysium  These are Notions which so abound in him as to make  Herodot  l    Herodotus  say He had introduc'd from thence the  Religion  of  Greece  And if others have believ'd he was an  Aegyptian  from his Knowledge of their Rites and Traditions which were reveal'd but to few and of the Arts and Customs which were practis'd among them in general it may prove at least thus much that he was there in his Travels  As  Greece  was in all Probability his native Country and had then began to make an Effort for Learning we cannot doubt but he travel'd there also with a particular Observation He uses the different  Dialects  which were spoken in its different Parts as one who had been conversant with them all But the Argument which appears most irrefragable is to be taken from his  Catalogue  of the  Ships  He has there given us an exact  Geography  of  Greece  where its Cities Mountains and Plains are particularly mention'd where the Courses of its Rivers are trac'd out where the Countrys are laid in order their Bounds assign'd and the uses of their Soils specify'd which the Ancients who compar'd it with the Original have allow'd to be so true in all Points that it could never have been owing to a loose and casual Information Even  Strabo  's Account of  Greece  is but a kind of Commentary upon  Homer  's  We may carry this Argument farther to suppose his having been round  Asia Minor  from his exact Division of the  Regnum Priami vetus  as  Horace  calls it into its separate  Dynasties  and the Account he gives of the bordering Nations in Alliance with it Perhaps too in the Wandrings of  Ulysses  about  Sicily  whose Ports and neighbouring Islands are mention'd he might contrive to send his Heroe where he had made his own Voyage before Nor will the Fables he has intermingled be any Objection to his having travel'd in those Parts since they are not related as the History of the present time but the Tradition of the former His mention of  Thrace  his Description of the Beasts of  Lybia  and of the Climate in the  Fortunate Islands  may seem also to give us a view of him in the Extreams of the Earth where it was not barbarous or uninhabited It is hard to set limits to the Travels of a Man who has set none to that desire of Knowledge which made him undertake them Who can say what People he has not seen who appears to be vers'd in the Customs of all He takes the Globe for the Scene in which he introduces his Subjects he launches forward intrepidly  like one to whom no place is new and appears a Citizen of the World in general  When he return'd from his Travels he seems to have apply'd himself to the finishing his Poems however he might have either design'd begun or pursu'd them before In these he has treasur'd up his various Acquisitions of Knowledge where they have been preserv'd through Ages to be as well the Proofs of his own Industry as the Instructions of Posterity He might then describe his Sacrifices after the  Aeolian  manner or  Iliad  his Leagues with a Mixture of  Trojan  and  Spartan  Ceremonies  Il ℣  He could then compare the Confusion of a Multitude to that Tumult he had observ'd in the  Icarian  Sea dashing and breaking among its Crowd of Islands He could represent the Numbers of an Army by those Flocks of  Iliad ℣  Swans he had seen on the Banks of the  Cayster  or being to describe that Heat of Battel with which  Achilles  drove the  Trojans  into the River  Il ℣  he could illustrate it with an Allusion from  Cyrene  or  Cyprus  where when the Inhabitants burn'd their Fields the Grasshoppers fled before the Fire to perish in the Ocean His Fancy being fully replenish'd might supply him with every proper occasional Image and his Soul after having enlarg'd itself and taken in an extensive Variety of the Creation might be equal to the Task of an  Iliad  and an  Odysses  His  old Age  and  Death  In his  Age  we hear he fell blind and settled at  Chios  as he says in the  Hymn  to  Apollo  which as is before observ'd is acknowledg'd for his by  Thucydides  and might occasion both  Simonides  and  Theocritus  to call him a  Chian  Strabo  l    Strabo  relates That  Lycurgus  the great Legislator of  Sparta  was reported to have gone to  Chios  to have a Conference with  Homer  after he had study'd the Laws of  Crete  and  Aegypt  in order to form his Constitutions If this be true how much a nobler Representation does it give of him and indeed more agreeable to what we conceive of this mighty Genius than those spurious Accounts which keep him down among the meanest of Mankind What an Idea could we frame to our selves of a Conversation held between two Persons so considerable a Philosopher conscious of the Force of Poetry and a Poet knowing in the Depths of  Philosophy both their Souls improv'd with Learning both eminently rais'd above little Designs or the meaner kind of Interest and meeting together to consult the Good of Mankind But in this I have only indulg'd a Thought which is not to be insisted upon the Evidence of History rather tends to prove that  Lycurgus  brought his Works from  Asia  after his Death which  Procl  vitâ  Hom  Proclus  imagines to have happen'd at a great old Age on account of his Circumference of Learning for which a short Life could never suffice  His  Character  and  Manners  If we would now make a Conjecture concerning the Genius and Temper of this great Man perhaps his Works which would not furnish us with Facts for his Life will be more reasonably made use of to give us a Picture of his Mind To this end therefore we may suffer the very Name and Notion of a Book to vanish for a while and look upon what is left us as a Conversation in order to gain an Acquaintance with  Homer  Perhaps the general Air of his Works will become the general Character of his Genius and the particular Observations give some Light to the particular Turns of his Temper His comprehensive Knowledge shews that his Soul was not form'd like a narrow Chanel for a single Stream but as an Expanse which might receive an Ocean into its Bosom that he had the strongest Desire of Improvement and an unbounded Curiosity which made its Advantage of every transient Circumstance or obvious Accident His solid and sententious Manner may make us admire him for a Man of Judgment one who in the darkest Ages could enter far into a Disquisition of human Nature who notwithstanding all the Changes which Governments Manners Rites and even the Notions of Virtue have undergone could still abound with so many Maxims correspondent to Truth and Notions applicable to so many Sciences The Fire which is so observable in his Poem as to give every thing the most active Appearance may make us naturally conjecture him to have been of a warm Temper and lively Behaviour and the pleasurable Air which every where overspreads it may give us reason to think that Fire of Imagination was temper'd with Sweetness and Affability If we farther observe the Particulars he treats of and imagine that  he laid a Stress upon the Sentiments he delivers pursuant to his real Opinions we shall take him to be of a religious Spirit by his inculcating in almost every Page the worship of the Gods We shall imagine him to be a generous Lover of his Countrey from his care to extol it every where which is carry'd to such a heighth as to make  Plutarch  de Aud Poetis  Plutarch  observe That though many of the  Barbarians  are made Prisoners or Suppliants yet neither of these disgraceful Accidents which are common to all Nations in War ever happens to one  Greek  throughout his Works We shall take him to be a compassionate Lover of Mankind from his numberless Praises of Hospitality and Charity if indeed we are not to account for 'em as the common Writers of his Life imagine from his owing his Support to these Virtues It might seem from his Love of Stories with his manner of telling them sometimes that he gave his own Picture when he painted his  Nestor  and as wise as he was was no Enemy to Talking One would think from his Praises of Wine his copious Goblets and pleasing Descriptions of Banquets that he was addicted to a chearful sociable Life which  Horace  takes notice of as a kind of Tradition  "Laudibus arguitur vini vinosus  Homerus  "  Ep    l    And that he was not as may be guess'd of  Virgil  from his Works averse to the  Female Sex  will appear from his care to paint them amiably upon all occasions His  Andromache  and  Penelope  are in each of his Poems most shining Characters of conjugal Affection even his  Helena  herself is drawn with all the Softnings imaginable his Souldiers are exhorted to combat with the hopes of  Women  his Commanders are furnish'd with  fair Slaves  in their Tents nor is the venerable  Nestor  without a  Mistress  It is true that in this way of turning a  Book  into a  Man  this reasoning from his Works to himself we can at best but hit off a few Outstrokes of a Character Wherefore I shall decline the carrying it into more minute Points and conclude with one  Discovery  which we may make from his  Silence  a Discovery extreamly proper to be made in this manner which is that he was of a very modest Temper There is in all  other Poets a Custom of speaking of themselves and a Vanity of promising Eternity to their Writings In both which  Homer  who has the best Title to speak out is altogether silent As to the last of them the World has made him ample Recompence it has given him that Eternity he would not promise himself But whatever Endeavours have been offer'd in respect of the former we find our selves still under an irreparable Loss That which others have said of him has amounted to no more than Conjecture that which I have said is no farther to be insisted on I have us'd the liberty which is indulg'd me by Precedent to give in my Opinions among the Accounts of others and the World may be pleas'd to receive them as so many willing Endeavours to gratify its Curiosity  Catalogue of his Works  The only uncontestable Works which  Homer  has left behind him are the  Iliad  and  Odysses  The  Batrachomuomachia  or  Battle of the Frogs and Mice  has been disputed but is however allow'd for his by many great Authorities amongst whom  Statius  Pres ad Sylu    Statius  has reckon'd it like the  Culex  of  Virgil  a Trial of his Force before his larger Performances It is indeed a beautiful Piece of Raillery in which a great Writer may delight to unbend himself an Instance of that  agreeable Trifling  which has been at some time or other indulg'd by the  finest Genius  's and the Offspring of that amusing and chearful Humour which generally accompanies the Character of a rich Imagination like a Vein of  Mercury  running mingled with a Mine of  Gold  The  Hymns  have been doubted also and attributed by the Scholiasts to  Cynaethus  the  Rhapsodist  but notwithstanding the Tradition neither  Thucyd  l    Thucydides  Lucian  Phalarid    Lucian  nor  Pausan  Boeotic  Pausanias  have scrupled to cite them as genuine We have the Authority of the two former for that to  Apollo  tho' it be observ'd that the word  is found in it which the Book  de Poesi Homericâ  ascrib'd to  Plutarch  tells us was not in use in  Homer  's Time We have also an Authority of the last for a  Paus  Messen  Hymn  to  Ceres  of which he has given us a Fragment That to  Mars  is objected against for mentioning  and that which is the first to  Minerva  for using  both of them being according to the  Author of the Treatise before mention'd words of a later Invention The  Hymn  to  Venus  has many of its Lines copy'd by  Virgil  in the Enterview between  Aeneas  and that Goddess in the first  Aeneid  But whether these Hymns are  Homer  's or not they are always judg'd to be near as ancient if not of the same Age with him  The  Epigrams  are extracted out of the Life said to be written by  Herodotus  and we leave them as such to stand or fall with it except the Epitaph on  Midas  which is of very ancient Authority quoted without its Author both by  Plat  in  Phaed  Plato  and  Longin §  Edit  Tollii  Longinus  and according to  Laertius  in vita  Cleobuli  Laertius  ascrib'd by  Simonides  to  Cleobulus  the wise Man who living long after  Homer  answers better to the Age of  Midas  the Son of  Gordias  The  Margites  which is lost is said by  Arist  Poet cap    Aristotle  to have been a Poem of a comick Nature wherein  Homer  made use of  Iambick  Verses as proper for Raillery It was a Jest upon the Fair Sex and had its Name from one  Margites  a weak Man who was the Subject of it The Story is something loose as may be seen by the Account of it still preserv'd in  Eustath  in  Odyss  Eustathius  's Comment on the  Odysses  The  Cercopes  was a Satyrical Work which is also lost we may however imagine it was level'd against the Vices of Men if our Conjecture be right that it was founded upon the  Ovid  Metam l    de  Cercop  old Fable of the  Cercopes  a Nation who were turn'd into  Monkies  for their Frauds and Impostures  The  Destruction  of  Oechalia  was a Poem of which according to  Eustathius    Hercules  was the Heroe and the Subject his ravaging that Countrey because  Eurytus  the King had deny'd him his Daughter  Iole  The  Ilias Minor  was a Piece which included both the taking of  Troy  and the return of the  Graecians  In this was the Story of  Sinon  which  Virgil  has made use of  Arist  Poet cap    Aristotle  has judg'd it not to belong to  Homer  The  Cypriacks  if it was upon them that  Nevius  founded his  Ilias Cypria  as  Dac  on  Arist  Poet cap    Mr  Dacier  conjectures were the  LoveAdventures  of the  Ladies  at the Siege these are rejected by  Herod  l    Herodotus  for saying that  Paris  brought  Helen  to  Troy  in three Days whereas  Homer  asserts they were long driven from Place to Place  There are also other Things ascrib'd to him such as the  Heptapection Goat  the  Arachnomachia c  in the ludicrous Manner and the  Thebais Epigoni  or second Siege of  Thebes  the  Phocais Amazonia c  in the serious which if they were his are now to be reputed a real Loss to the learned World Time in some Things may have prevail'd over  Homer  himself and left only the Names of these Works as Memorials that such were in being but while the  Iliad  and  Odysses  remain he seems like a Leader who tho' he may have fail'd in a Skirmish has carry'd a Victory for which he passes in Triumph through all future Ages  Monuments Coins Marbles  remaining of him  THE Remains we have at present of those Monuments Antiquity had fram'd for him are but few It could not be thought that they who knew so little of the Life of  Homer  could have a right Knowledge of his  Person  yet had they Statues of him as of their Gods whose Forms they had never seen  "  Quinimò quae non sunt finguntur  says  Pliny  l    c    Pliny    pariuntque desideria non traditi vultûs sicut in  Homero  evenit  "  But tho' the ancient Portraits of him seem purely notional yet they agree as I think  Raph Fabret  Explicatio Veteris Tabellae Anaglyphae  Hom  Iliad  Fabretti  has observ'd in representing him with a short curl'd Beard and distinct Marks of Age in his Forehead That which is prefix'd to this Book is taken from an ancient Marble Bust in the Palace of  Farnese  at  Rome  In  Bollissus  near  Chios  there is a Ruin which was shown for the House of  Homer  which  Leo Allat  de patria  Hom  cap    Leo Allatius  went on Pilgrimage to visit and as he tells us found nothing but a few Stones crumbling away with Age over which he and his Companions wept for Satisfaction  They erected Temples to  Homer  in  Smyrna  as appears from  Cicero  pro Archia  Cicero  one of these is suppos'd to be yet extant and the same which they show for the Temple of  Janus  It agrees with  Strabo  l  Tò  c  de  Smyrna  Strabo  's Description a square Building of Stone near a River thought to be the  Meles  with two Doors opposite to each other North and South and a large Niche within the EastWall where the Image stood But M  Spon  denies this to be the true  Homaerium  Of the Medals struck for him there are some both of  Chios  and  Smyrna  still in being and exhibited at the beginning of this Essay The most valuable with respect to the Largeness of the Head is that of  Amastris  which is carefully copied from an Original belonging to the present Earl of  Pembroke  and is the same which  Gronovius Cuperus  and  Dacier  have Copies of but very incorrectly performed  But that which of all the Remains has been of late the chief Amusement of the Learned is the Marble call'd his  Apotheosis  the Work of  Archelaus  of  Priene  and now in the Palace of  Colonna  We see there a Temple hung with its Veil where  Homer  is plac'd on a Seat with a Footstool to it as he has describ'd the Seats of his Gods supported on each side with Figures known for the  Iliad  and the  Odysses  the one by the Sword the other by the Ornament of a Ship which denotes the Voyages of  Ulysses  On each side of his Footstool are  Mice  in Allusion to the  Batrachomuomachia  Behind is  Time  waiting upon him and a Figure with Turrets on its Head which signifies the  World  crowning him with the Laurel Before him is an Altar at which all the  Arts  are sacrificing to him as to their Deity On one side of the Altar stands a Boy representing  Mythology  on the other a Woman representing  History  after her is  Poetry  bringing the  Sacred Fire  and in a long following Train  Tragedy Comedy Nature Virtue Memory Rhetorick  and  Wisdom  in all their proper Attitudes  SECT II  HAVING now finish'd what was propos'd concerning the History of  Homer  's Life I shall proceed to that of his Works and considering him no longer as a  Man  but as an  Author  prosecute the Thread of his Story in this his second Life thro' the different Degrees of Esteem which those Writings have obtain'd in different Periods of Time  It has been the fortune of several great Genius's not to be known while they liv'd either for want of Historians the Meanness of Fortune or the Love of Retirement to which a Poetical Temper is peculiarly addicted Yet after Death their Works give themselves a Life in Fame without the help of an Historian and notwithstanding the Meanness of their Author or his Love of Retreat they go forth among Mankind the Glories of that Age which produc'd them and the Delight of those which follow it This is a Fate particularly verify'd in  Homer  than whom no considerable Author is less known as to himself or more highly valu'd as to his Productions  The first Publication of his Works by  Lycurgus  The earliest Account of these is said by  Plut  vit  Lycurgi  Plutarch  to be some time after his Death when  Lycurgus  sail'd to  Asia  "There he had the first sight of  Homer  's Works which were probably preserv'd by the Grandchildren of  Creophilus  and having observ'd that their pleasurable Air of Fiction did not hinder the Poets abounding in Maxims of State and Rules of Morality he transcrib'd and carry'd with him that entire Collection we have now among us For at that time continues this Author there was only an obscure Rumour in  Greece  to the Reputation of these Poems and but a few scatter'd Fragments handed about 'till  Lycurgus  publish'd them entire"  Thus they were in danger of being lost as soon as they were produced by the Misfortune of the Age a want of Taste in Learning or the manner  in which they were left to Posterity when they fell into the Hands of  Lycurgus  He was a Man of great Learning a Lawgiver to a People divided and untractable and one who had a Notion that Poetry influenc'd and civiliz'd the Minds of Men which made him smooth the way to his Constitution by the Songs of  Thales  the  Cretan  whom he engag'd to write upon Obedience and Concord As he propos'd to himself that the Constitution he would raise upon this their Union should be of a martial Nature these Poems were of an extraordinary Value to him for they came with a full Force into his Scheme the Moral they inspir'd was Unity the Air they breath'd was Martial and their Story had this particular Engagement for the  Lacedaemonians  that it shew'd  Greece  in War and  Asia  subdu'd under the Conduct of one of their own Monarchs who commanded all the  Graecian  Princes Thus the Poet both pleas'd the Lawgiver and the People from whence he had a double Influence when the Laws were settled For his Poem then became a Panegyrick on their Constitution as well as a Register of their Glory and confirm'd them in the Love of it by a gallant Description of those Qualities and Actions for which it was adapted This made  Plutarch  Apoptheg  Cleomenes  call him  The Poet of the  Lacedaemonians And therefore when we remember that  Homer  owed the Publication of his Works to  Lycurgus  we should grant too that  Lycurgus  owed in some degree the Enforcement of his Laws to the Works of  Homer  Their Reception in  Greece  At their first Appearance in  Greece  they were not digested into a regular Body but remain'd as they were brought over in several detach'd Pieces call'd according to  Aelian  l    cap    Aelian  from the Subject on which they treated as the  Battle at the Ships the Death of  Dolon  the Valour of  Agamemnon  the  Patroclea  the Grot of  Calypso  Slaughter of the Wooers  and the like Nor were these entitled  Books  but  Rhapsodies  from whence they who sung them had the Title of  Rhapsodists  It was in this manner they began to be disperst while their Poetry their History the Glory they ascrib'd to  Greece  in general the particular Description they gave of it and the  Compliment they paid to every little State by an honourable mention so influenc'd all that they were transcrib'd and sung with general Approbation But what seems to have most recommended them was that  Greece  which could not be great in its divided Condition looked upon the Fable of them as a likely Plan of future Grandeur They seem from thenceforward to have had an Eye upon the Conquest of  Asia  as a proper Undertaking which by its Importance might occasion Union enough to give a Diversion from Civil Wars and by its Prosecution bring in an Acquisition of Honour and Empire This is the meaning of  Isocrat  Paneg  Isocrates  when he tells us That  "  Homer  's Poetry was in the greater Esteem because it gave exceeding Praise to those who fought against the  Barbarians  Our Ancestors continues he honour'd it with a Place in Education and musical Contests that by often hearing it we should have a Notion of an original Enmity between us and those Nations and that admiring the Virtue of those who fought at  Troy  we should be induc'd to emulate their Glory"  And indeed they never quitted this thought 'till they had successfully carry'd their Arms whereever  Homer  might thus excite them  Digested into order at  Athens  But while his Works were suffer'd to lie in an unconnected manner the Chain of Story was not always perceiv'd so that they lost much of their Force and Beauty by being read disorderly Wherefore as  Lacedaemon  had the first Honour of their Publication by  Lycurgus  that of their Regulation fell to the share of  Athens  in the time of  Diog Laert  vit  Sol  Solon  who himself made a Law for their recital It was then that  Pisistratus  the Tyrant of  Athens  who was a Man of great Learning and Eloquence as  Quis doctior iisdem illis temporibus aut cujus cloquentia litteris instructior quam  Pisistrati  Qui primus  Homeri  libros confusos antea sic disposuisse dicitur ut nunc habemus Cic  de Orat l    Vide ctiam Ael l    cap  Liban  Panegyr in  Jul  Anonymam  Homeri  vitam Fusius vero in Commentatoribus  Dyon Thracis  Cicero  has it first put together the confus'd Parts of  Homer  according to that Regularity in which they are now  handed down to us He divided them into the two different Works entitled the  Iliad  and  Odysses  he digested each according to the Author's design to make their Plans become evident and distinguish'd each again into twenty four Books to which were afterwards prefix'd the twenty four Letters There is a Passage indeed in  Plato  in  Hypparcho  Plato  which takes this Work from  Pisistratus  by giving it to his Son  Hypparchus  with this addition that he commanded them to be sung at the Feast call'd  Panathenaea  Perhaps it may be as  Leo Allatius  de Patria  Hom  cap    Leo Allatius  has imagin'd because the Son publish'd the Copy more correctly This he offers to reconcile so great a Testimony as  Plato  's to the Cloud of Witnesses which are against him in it But be that as it will  Athens  still claims its proper Honour of rescuing the Father of Learning from the Injuries of Time of having restor'd  Homer  to himself and given the World a view of him in his Perfection So that if his Verses were before admir'd for their  Use  and  Beauty  as the  Stars  were before they were consider'd in a  System  of Science they are now admir'd much more for their graceful  Harmony  and that  Sphere  of  Order  in which they appear to move They became henceforward more the Pleasure of the Wits of  Greece  more the Subject of their Studies and the Employment of their Pens  About the time that this new Edition of  Homer  was publish'd in  Athens  there was one  Cynaethus  a learned  Rhapsodist  who as the  Schol Pind  in Nem Od    Scholiast  of  Pindar  informs us settled first at  Syracuse  in that Employment and if as  Leo Allatius  believes he had been before an Assistant in the Edition he may be suppos'd to have first carry'd it abroad But it was not long preserv'd correct among his Followers they committed Mistakes in their Transcriptions and Repetitions and had even the Presumption to alter some Lines and interpolate others Thus the Works of  Homer  ran the danger of being utterly defac'd which made it become the concern of Kings and Philosophers that they should be restor'd to their Primitive Beauty  The Edition in  Macedon  under  Alexander  In the Front of these is  Alexander the Great  for whom they will appear peculiarly calculated if we consider that no Books more enliven or flatter personal Valour which was great in him to what we call Romantick Neither has any Book more places applicable to his  Designs  on  Asia  or as it happen'd to his  Actions  there It was then no ill Compliment in  Plut  in vitâ  Alexandri  Aristotle  to purge the  Iliad  upon his account from those Errors and Additions which had crept into it And so far was  Alexander  himself from esteeming it a Matter of small Importance that he afterwards  Strabo  lib    assisted in a strict Review of it with  Anaxarchus  and  Calisthenes  whether it was meerly because he esteem'd it a Treasury of military Virtue and Knowledge or that according to a late ingenious Conjecture he had a farther Aim in promoting the Propagation of it when he was ambitious to be esteem'd a Son of  Jupiter  as a Book which treating of the Sons of the Gods might make the Intercourse between them and Mortals become a familiar Notion The Review being finish'd he laid it up in a Casket which was found among the Spoils of  Darius  as what best deserv'd so inestimable a Case and from this Circumstance it was nam'd The  Edition of the Casket  Editions in  Aegypt  The Place where the Works of  Homer  were next found in the greatest Regard is  Aegypt  under the Reign of the  Ptolomys  These Kings being descended from  Greece  retain'd always a Passion for their original Country The Men the Books the Qualifications of it were in esteem in their Court they preserv'd the Language in their Family they encourag'd a Concourse of learned Men erected the greatest Library in the World and train'd up their Princes under  Graecian  Tutors among whom the most considerable were appointed for Revisers of  Homer  The first of these was  Suidas  Zenodotus  LibraryKeeper to the first  Ptolomy  and qualify'd for this Undertaking by being both a Poet and a Grammarian a compounded Character in which there was Fancy for a Discovery  of Beauties and a minuter Judgment for a Detection of Faults But neither his Copy nor that which his Disciple  Aristophanes  had made satisfying  Aristarchus  whom  Ptolomy Philometor  had appointed over his Son  Euergetes  he set himself to another Correction with all the Wit and Learning he was Master of He restor'd some Verses to their former Readings rejected others which he mark'd with  Obelisks  as spurious and proceeded with such industrious Accuracy that notwithstanding there were some who wrote against his Performance Antiquity has generally acquiesc'd in it Nay so far have they carry'd their Opinion in his favour as to call a Man an  Argue ambiguè dictum mutanda notabit  Fiet  Aristarchus  Horat  Ars Poetica  Aristarchus  when they meant to say a candid judicious Critick in the same manner as they call the contrary a  Zoilus  from that  Zoilus  who about this time wrote an envious Criticism against  Homer  And now we mention these two together I fancy it will be no small Pleasure to the benevolent Part of Mankind to see how their Characters stand in Contrast to each other for Examples to future Ages at the head of the two contrary sorts of Criticism which proceed from good Nature or from ill Will The one was honour'd with the Offices and Countenance of the Court the other  Vitruv  l    in Prooem  when he apply'd to the same Place for an Encouragement amongst the Men of Learning had his Petition rejected The one had his Fame continu'd to Posterity the other is only remember'd with Infamy If the one had Antagonists they were oblig'd to pay him the deference of a formal Answer the other was never answer'd but in general with those opprobrious Names of  Thracian Slave  and  Rhetorical Dog  The one is suppos'd to have his Copy still remaining while the other's Remarks are perish'd as things that Men were asham'd to preserve the just Desert of whatever arises from the miserable Principles of ill Will or Envy  In  Syria  and other Parts of  Asia  It was not the Ambition of  Aegypt  only to have a correct Edition of  Homer  We find in the  Author vitae  Arati    Suidas  in  Arato  Life of the Poet  Aratus  that he having finish'd a Copy of the  Odysses  was sent for by  Antiochus  King of  Syria  and entertain'd by him while he finish'd one of the  Iliad  We read too of others which were publish'd with the Names of Countrys such as the  Eustathius  Initio Iliados  Massaliotick  and  Synopick  as if the World were agreed to make his Works in their Survival undergo the same Fate with himself and that as different Cities contended for his Birth so they might again contend for his true Edition But though these Reviews were not peculiar to  Aegypt  the greatest Honour was theirs in that universal Approbation which the Performance of  Aristarchus  receiv'd and if it be not his Edition which we have at present we know not to whom to ascribe it  In  India  and  Persia  But the World was not contented barely to have settled an Edition of his Works There were innumerable Comments in which they were open'd like a Treasury of Learning and Translations whereby other Languages became enrich'd by an Infusion of his Spirit of Poetry  Aelian  l    cap    Aelian  tells us that even the  Indians  had them in their Tongue and the  Persian  Kings sung them in theirs  Persius  Sat    Persius  mentions a Version into  Latin  by  Labeo  and in general the Passages and Imitations which are taken from him are so numerous that he may be said to have been translated by piecemeal into that and all other Languages Which affords us this Remark that there is hardly any thing in him which has not been pitch'd upon by some Author or other for a particular Beauty  The Extent and Height of their Reputation in the Heathen World  It is almost incredible to what an Height the Idea of that Veneration the Ancients paid to  Homer  will arise to one who reads particularly with this view through all these Periods He was no sooner come from his Obscurity but  Greece  receiv'd him with Delight and Profit There were then but few Books to divide their Attention and none which had a better Title to engross it all They made some daily Discoveries of his Beauties which were still promoted in their different Channels by the favourite Qualities of different Nations  Sparta  and  Macedon  consider'd him most in respect of his  warlike Spirit Athens  and  Aegypt  with regard to his  Poetry  and  Learning  and all their Endeavours united under  the Hands of the Learned to make him blaze forth into an universal Character His Works which from the beginning pass'd for excellent  Poetry  grew to be  History  and  Geography  they rose to be a  Magazine  of  Sciences  were exalted into a  Scheme  of  Religion  gave a Sanction to whatever Rites they mention'd were quoted in all Cases for the  Conduct of Life  and learned by Heart as the very Book of Belief and Practice From him the  Poets  drew their Inspirations the  Criticks  their Rules and the  Philosophers  a Defence of their Opinions Every Author was fond to use his Name and every Profession writ Books upon him 'till they swell'd to Libraries The Warriors form'd themselves by his Heroes and the Oracles deliver'd his Verses for Answers Nor was Mankind satisfy'd to have thus seated his Character at the top of human Wisdom but being overborn with an imagination that he transcended their Species they admitted him to share in those Honours they gave the Deities They instituted Games for him dedicated Statues erected Temples as at  Smyrna Chios  and  Alexandria  and  Aelian  l    cap    Aelian  tells us That when the  Argives  sacrific'd with their Guests they us'd to invoke the Presence of  Apollo  and  Homer  together  The Decline of their Character in the beginning of Christianity  Thus he was settled on a Foot of Adoration and continu'd highly venerated in the  Roman  Empire when  Christianity  began Heathenism was then to be destroy'd and  Homer  appear'd the Father of it whose Fictions were at once the Belief of the Pagan Religion and the Objections of Christianity against it He became therefore very deeply involv'd in the Question and not with that Honour which hitherto attended him but as a Criminal who had drawn the World into Folly He was on one hand accus'd for having fram'd  Justin Martyr  Admonit ad Gentes  Fables upon the Works of  Moses  as the Rebellion of the Giants from the building of  Babel  and the casting  Atè  or  Strife  out of Heaven from the Fall of  Lucifer  He was expos'd on the other hand for those which he is said to invent as when  Arnobius  adversus gentes l    Arnobius  crys out  "This is the Man who wounded your  Venus  imprison'd your  Mars  who free'd even your  Jupiter  by  Briareus  and who finds Authorities for  all your Vices"  c  Mankind was  Vid  Tertull  Apol cap    derided for whatever he had hitherto made them believe and  Arnobius  ibid  Eusebius  praep Evangel l    cap    Plato  who expell'd him his Commonwealth has of all the Philosophers found the best Quarter from the Fathers for passing that Sentence His finest Beauties began to take a new Appearance of pernicious Qualities and because they might be consider'd as Allurements to Fancy or Supports to those Errors with which they were mingled they were to be depreciated while the Contest of Faith was in being It was hence that the reading them was discourag'd that we hear  Ruffinus  accusing St  Jerome  for it and that  St  August  confess l    cap    St  Austin  rejects him as the grand Master of Fable tho' indeed the  dulcissimè vanus  which he applies to  Homer  looks but like a fondling manner of parting with him  This strong Attack against our Author oblig'd those Philosophers who could have acquiesc'd as his Admirers to appear as his Defenders who because they saw the Fables could not be literally supported endeavour'd to find a hidden Sense and to carry on every where that Vein of Allegory which was already broken open with Success in some Places But how miserably were they forc'd to Shifts when they made  Plutarch  on reading the Poets  Juno  's dressing in the  Cestos  for  Jupiter  to signify the purging of the  Air  as it approach'd the  Fire  Or the Story of  Mars  and  Venus  that Inclination they have to Incontinency who are born when these Planets are in Conjunction Wit and Learning had here a large Field to display themselves and to disagree in for sometimes  Jupiter  and sometimes  Vulcan  was made to signify the  Fire  or  Mars  and  Venus  were allow'd to give us a Lecture of  Morality  at one time and a Problem of  Astronomy  at another And these strange Discoveries which  Porphyrius  de Antro Nymph c  Porphyry  and the rest would have to pass for the genuine  Theology  of the  Greeks  prove but as  Eusebii  praepar Evangel l    cap    Eusebius  terms it the perverting of Fables into a mystick Sense They did indeed often defend  Homer  but then they allegorized away their  Gods  by doing so What the World took for substantial Objects of Adoration dissolv'd before its  Eyes into a figurative Meaning a moral Truth or a Piece of Learning which might equally correspond to any Religion and the Learned at last had left themselves nothing to worship when they came to find an Object in Christianity  Restoration of  Homer  's Works to their just Character  The Dispute of Faith being over ancient Learning reassumed its Dignity and  Homer  obtain'd his proper Place in the Esteem of Mankind His Books are now no longer the Scheme of a living Religion but become the Register of one of former Times They are not now receiv'd for a Rule of Life but valu'd for those just Observations which are dispers'd through them They are no longer pronounc'd from Oracles but quoted still by Authors for their Learning Those Remarks which the Philosophers made upon them have their Weight with us those Beauties which the Poets dwell'd upon their Admiration And even after the Abatement of what was extravagant in his Run of Praise he remains confessedly a mighty Genius not transcended by any which have since arisen a Prince as well as a Father of Poetry  SECT III  A View of the Learning of  Homer  's Time  IT remains in this Historical Essay to regulate our present Opinion of  Homer  by a view of his Learning compar'd with that of his Age For this end he may first be consider'd as a Poet that Character which was his professedly and secondly as one endow'd with other Sciences which must be spoken of not as in themselves but as in Subserviency to his main Design Thus he will be seen on his right Foot of Perfection in one view and with the just Allowances which should be made on the other While we pass through the several Heads of Science the State of those Times in which he writ will show us both the Impediments he rose under and the Reasons why several things in him which have been objected to either could not or should not be otherwise than they are  In  Poetry  As for the State of  Poetry  it was at a low Pitch in the Age of  Homer  There is mention of  Orpheus Linus  and  Musaeus  venerable Names in Antiquity and eminently celebrated in Fable for the wonderful Power of their Songs and Musick The learned  Fabricius  in his  Bibliotheca Graeca  has reckon'd about seventy who are said to have written before  Homer  but their Works were not preserv'd and can be only consider'd if they were really excellent as the Happiness of their own Generation What sort of Poets  Homer  saw in his own Time may be gather'd from his Description of  Od  st  and  Od  th    Demodocus  and  Phemius  whom he has introduc'd as Opportunities to celebrate his Profession The imperfect Risings of the Art lay then among the  Extempore  Singers of Stories at Banquets who were half Singers half Musicians Nor was the Name of  Poet  then in being or once us'd throughout  Homer  's Works From this poor State of Poetry he has taken a handle to usher it into the World with the boldest Stroke of Praise which has ever been given it It is in the eighth  Odyssey  where  Ulysses  puts  Demodocus  upon a trial of Skill  Demodocus  having diverted the Guests with some Actions of the  Trojan  War  "  Odyss  l  ℣  c  All this says  Ulysses  you have sung very elegantly as if you had either been present or heard it reported but pass now to a Subject I shall give you sing the Management of  Ulysses  in the wooden Horse just as it happen'd and I will acknowledge the Gods have taught you your Songs"  This the Singer being inspir'd from Heaven begins immediately and  Ulysses  by weeping at the recital confesses the Truth of it We see here a Narration which could only pass upon an Age extreamly ignorant in the Nature of Poetry where that Claim of Inspiration is given to it which it has never since laid down and which is more a Power of prophecying at pleasure ascrib'd to it Thus much therefore we gather from himself concerning the most ancient State of Poetry in  Greece  that no one was honour'd with the Name of Poet before Him whom it has especially belong'd to ever after And if we farther appeal to the consent of Authors we find he has other Titles for being call'd the first  Joseph  contra  Apion  l  r  Josephus  observes That the  Greeks  have not contested but he was the most  ancient whose Books they had in Writing  Arist  Poet cap    Aristotle  says He was the  "first who brought all the Parts of a Poem into one Piece"  to which he adds  "with true Judgment"  to give him a Praise including both the Invention and Perfection And  Horace  acquaints us that he invented the very  Measure  which is call'd  Heroick  from the Subjects on which he employ'd it  Res gestae regumque ducumque fortia bella  Quo scribi possint  numero  monstravit Homerus  Hor  Epist ad  Pisones ℣    Whatever was serious or magnificent made a part of his Subject War and Peace were the comprehensive Division in which he consider'd the World and the Plans of his Poems were founded on the most active Scenes of each the Adventures of a Siege and the Accidents of a Voyage For these his Spirit was equally active and various lofty in Expression clear in Narration natural in Description rapid in Action abundant in Figures If ever he appears less than himself it is from the Time he writ in and if he runs into Errors it is from an Excess rather than a Defect of Genius Thus he rose over the Poetical World shining out like a Sun all at once which if it sometimes make too  faint  an Appearance 'tis to be ascrib'd only to the necessity of the Season that keeps it at a distance and if he is sometimes too  violent  we confess at the same time that we owe all things to his Heat  Theology  As for his  Theology  we see the Heathen System entirely follow'd This was all he could then have to work upon and where he fails of Truth for want of Revelation he at least shows his Knowledge in his own Religion by the Traditions he delivers But we are now upon a Point to be farther handled because the greatest Controversy concerning the Merit of  Homer  depends upon it Let us consider then that there was an Age in  Greece  when natural Reason only discover'd there must be something superior to us and Tradition had affix'd the Notion to a Number of Deities At this time  Homer  rose with the finest Turn imaginable for Poetry who designing  to instruct Mankind in the manner for which he was most adapted writ Poems wherein he made use of the Ministry of the Gods to give the highest Air of Surprize and Veneration to his Writings He found the Religion of Mankind wrapt up in Fables it was thought then the easiest way to convey Morals to the People who were allur'd to Attention by Pleasure and aw'd with the Opinion of a hidden Mystery Nor was it his Business when he undertook the Province of a Poet not of a meer Philosopher to be the first who should discard That which furnishes Poetry with its most beautiful Appearance and especially since the Age he liv'd in by discovering its Taste had not only given him Authority but even put him under the necessity of preserving it Whatever therefore he might think of his Gods he took them as he found them he brought them into Action according to the Notions which were then entertain'd and in some Stories as they were then believ'd unless we imagine that he invented every thing he delivers Yet there are several Rays of Truth streaming through all this Darkness in those Sentiments he entertains concerning the Gods and several  Allegories  lightly veil'd over from whence the learned drew new Knowledges each according to his Power of Penetration and Fancy But that we may the better comprehend him in all the Parts of this general View let us extract from him a Scheme of his Religion  He has a  Jupiter  a  Father of Gods and Men  whom he makes supream and to whom he applies several Attributes as Wisdom Justice Knowledge Power  c  which are essentially inherent to the Idea of a God  Iliad ℣  He has given him two  Vessels  out of which he distributes natural  Good  or  Evil  for the Life of Man he places the Gods in Council round him he makes  Il ℣  Prayers  pass to and fro before him and Mankind adore him with Sacrifice But all this grand Appearance wherein Poetry paid a deference to Reason is dash'd and mingled with the Imperfection of our Nature not only with the applying our Passions to the supreme Being for Men have always been treated with this  Complyance to their Notions but that he is not even exempted from our common Appetites and Frailties For he is made to eat drink and sleep but this his Admirers would imagine to be only a grosser way of representing a general Notion of Happiness because he says in one place  Il ℣  that the Food of the Gods was not of the same Nature with ours But upon the whole while he endeavour'd to speak of a Deity without a right Information he was forc'd to take him from that Image he discover'd in  Man  and like one who being dazled with the Sun in the Heavens would view him as he is reflected in a River he has taken off the Impression not only ruffled with the Emotion of our Passions but obscur'd with the earthy Mixture of our Natures  The other Gods have all their Provinces assign'd 'em  "Every thing has its peculiar Deity says  Maxim Tyrius  Diss    Maximus Tyrius  by which  Homer  would insinuate that the Godhead was present to all things"  When they are consider'd farther we find he has turn'd the Virtues and Endowments of our Minds into  Persons  to make the Springs of Action become visible and because they are given by the Gods he represents them as Gods themselves descending from Heaven In the same strong Light he shows our Vices when they occasion Misfortunes like extraordinary Powers which inflict them upon us and even our natural Punishments are represented as Punishers themselves But when we come to see the manner they are introduc'd in they are found feasting fighting wounded by Men and shedding a sort of Blood in which his Machines play a little too grosly the Fable which was admitted to procure the Pleasure of Surprize violently oppresses the Allegory and it may be lost labour to search for it in every minute Circumstance if indeed it was intended to be there The main Design was however Philosophical the Dress the Poet's which is us'd for necessity and allow'd to be ornamental And there will be something still to be offer'd in his Defence if he has both preserved the grand Moral from being obscur'd and adorn'd the Parts of his Works with such Sentiments of the Gods as belong'd to the Age he liv'd  in which that he did appears from his having then had that Success for which Allegory was contriv'd  "It is the Madness of Man says  Maxim Tyr  Diss    Maximus Tyrius  to disesteem what is plain and admire what is hidden This the Poets discovering invented the Fable for a Remedy when they treated of holy Matters which being more obscure than Conversation and more clear than the Riddle is a Mean between Knowledge and Ignorance believ'd partly for being agreeable and partly for being wonderful Thus as Poets in Name and Philosophers in Effect they drew Mankind gradually to a search after Truth when the Name of Philosopher would have been harsh and displeasing"  When  Homer  proceeds to tell us our Duty to these superior Beings we find Prayer Sacrifice Lustration and all the Rites which were esteem'd religious constantly recommended under fear of their Displeasure We find too a Notion of the Soul's subsisting after this Life but for want of Revelation he knows not what to reckon the Happiness of a future State to any one who was not deify'd Which is plain from the Speech of  Odyss ℣  Achilles  to  Ulysses  in the Region of the dead where he tells him that  "he would rather serve the poorest Creature upon Earth than rule over all the departed"  It was chiefly for this Reason that  Plato  excluded him his CommonWealth he thought  Homer  spoke indecently of the Gods and dreadfully of a future State in which Sentence he has made no Allowance for the Times he writ in But if he can not be defended in every thing as a Theologist yet we may say in respect of his Poetry that he has enrich'd it from Theology with true Sentiments for Profit adorn'd it with Allegories for Pleasure and by using some Machines which have no farther Significancy or are so refin'd as to make it doubted if they have any he has however produc'd that Character in Poetry which we call the  Marvellous  and from which the  Agreeable  according to  Aristotle  is always inseparable  Politicks  If we take the State of  Greece  at his time in a  Political  View we find it a  See  Thucydides  lib    disunited Country made up of small  States and whatever was manag'd in War amounted to no more than intestine Skirmishes or Pyracies abroad which were easily reveng'd on account of their Disunion Thus one People stole  Europa  and another  Io  the  Graecians  took  Hesione  from  Troy  and the  Trojans  took  Helena  from  Greece  in Revenge But this last having greater Friends and Alliances than any upon whom the Rapes had hitherto fallen the Ruin of  Troy  was the Consequence and the Force of the  Asiatick  Coasts was so broken that this Accident put an end to the Age of Pyracies Then the intestine Broils of  Greece  which had been discontinued during the League were renew'd upon its Dissolution War and Sedition mov'd People from Place to Place during its want of Inhabitants Exiles from one Country were receiv'd for Kings in another and Leaders took Tracts of Ground to bestow them upon their Followers Commerce was neglected living at home unsafe and nothing of Moment tranfacted by any but against their Neighbours  Athens  only where the People were undisturb'd because it was a barren Soil which no Body coveted had begun to send Colonies abroad being overstock'd with Inhabitants  Now a Poem coming out at so seasonable a Time with a Moral capable of healing these Disorders by promoting  Union  we may reasonably think it was design'd for that End to which it is so peculiarly adapted If we imagine therefore that  Homer  was a Politician in this Affair we may suppose him to have look'd back into the Ages past to see if at any time the Disorder had been less and to have pitch'd upon that Story wherein it found a temporary Cure that by celebrating it with all possible Honour he might instil a Desire of the same sort of Union into the Hearts of his Countrymen This indeed was a Work which could belong to none but a Poet when Governors had Power only over small Territories and the numerous Governments were every way independent It was then that all the Charms of Poetry were call'd forth to insinuate the important Glory of an Alliance and the  Iliad  deliver'd from the  Muses  with all the Pomp of Words and artificial Influence Union among themselves was recommended Peace at home and Glory abroad And lest this should be render'd useless by Mismanagements  he lets us into farther Lessons concerning it How when his Kings quarrel their Subjects suffer when they act in Conjunction Victory attends them When they meet in Council Plans are drawn and Provisions made for future Action and when in the Field the Arts of War are describ'd with the greatest Exactness These were Lectures of general Concern to Mankind proper for the Poet to deliver and Kings to attend to such as made  Porphyry  write of the Profit that Princes might receive from  Homer  and  Stratocles Hermias  and  Frontinus  extract military Discipline out of him Thus tho'  Plato  has banish'd him from one imaginary Commonwealth he has still been serviceable to many real Kingdoms  Morality  The  Morality  of  Greece  could not be perfect while there was a Weakness in its Government Faults in Politicks are occasion'd by Faults in Ethicks and occasion them in their turn The Division into so many States was the rise of frequent Quarrels whereby Men were bred up in a kind of rough untractable Disposition Bodily Strength met with the greatest Honours because it was daily necessary to the Subsistence of little Governments and that headlong Courage which throws itself forward to Enterprize and Plunder was universally caress'd because it carry'd all things before it It is no wonder in an Age of such Education and Customs that as  Thucyd  lib    Thucydides  says  "Robbing was honour'd provided it were done with Gallantry and that the ancient Poets made People question one another as they sail'd by  if they were Thieves  as a thing for which no one ought either to be scorn'd or upbraided"  These were the sort of Actions which the Singers then recorded and it was out of such an Age that  Homer  was to take his Subjects For this reason not a want of Morality in him we see a boasting Temper and unmanag'd Roughness in the Spirit of his Heroes which ran out in Pride Anger or Cruelty It is not in him as in our modern  Romances  where Men are drawn in Perfection and we but read with a tender Weakness what we can neither apply nor emulate  Homer  writ for Men and therefore  he writ of them if the World had been better he would have shown it so as the Matter now stands we see his People with the turn of his Age insatiably thirsting after Glory and Plunder for which however he has found them a lawful Cause and taken care to retard their Success by those very Faults  In the Prosecution of the Story every Part of it has its Lessons of Morality There is brotherly Love in  Agamemnon  and  Menelaus  Friendship in  Achilles  and  Patroclus  and the Love of his Country in  Hector  But since we have spoken of the  Iliad  as more particular for its Politicks we may consider the  Odysses  as its Moral is more directly fram'd for Ethicks It carries the Heroe through a world of Trials both of the dangerous and pleasurable Nature It shows him first under most surprizing Weights of Adversity among Shipwrecks and Savages all these he is made to pass through in the Methods by which it becomes a Man to conquer a Patience in suffering and a Presence of Mind in every Accident It shows him again in another View tempted with the Baits of idle or unlawful Pleasures and then points out the Methods of being safe from them But if in general we consider the care our Author has taken to fix his Lessons of Morality by the Proverbs and Precepts he delivers we shall not wonder if  Greece  which afterwards gave the Appellation of  Wise  to Men who settled  single Sentences  of Truth should give him the Title of the  Father of Virtue  for introducing such a Number To be brief if we take the Opinion of  Qui quid sit pulchrum quid turpe quid utile quid non  Plenius melius Chrysippo Crantore dicit  Hor  Ep    lib    Horace  he has propos'd him to us as a Master of Morality he lays down the common Philosophical Division of  Good  into  pleasant profitable  and  honest  and then asserts that  Homer  has more fully and clearly instructed us in each of them than the most rigid Philosophers  Some indeed have thought notwithstanding all this that  Homer  had only a design to please in his Inventions and that others have since extracted Morals out of his Stories and indeed all Stories are capable of being us'd so But this is an  Opinion concerning Poetry which the World has rather degenerated into than begun with The Traditions of  Orpheus  's civilizing Mankind by Hymns on the Gods with others of the like Nature may show there was a better use of the Art both known and practis'd There is also a remarkable Passage of this kind in the third Book of the  Odysses  that  Agamemnon  left one of the  Odyss ℣  Poets of his Times in the Court when he sail'd for  Troy  and that his Queen was preserv'd virtuous by his Songs 'till  Aegysthus  was forc'd to expel him in order to debauch her Here he has hinted what a true Poetical Spirit can do when apply'd to the Promotion of Virtue and from this one may judge he could not but design That himself which he recommends as the Duty and Merit of his Profession Others since his Time may have seduc'd the Art to worse Intentions but they who are offended at the Liberties of some Poets should not judge all in the gross for trifling or Corruption especially when the Evidence runs so strongly for any One to the contrary  We may in general go on to observe that the time when  Homer  was born did not abound in Learning For whereever Politicks and Morality is weak it wants its peaceable Air to thrive in and that Opportunity which is not known in the Ages of unsettled Life He is himself the Man from whom we have the first Accounts of Antiquity either in its Actions or Learning from whom we hear what  Aegypt  or  Greece  could inform him in and whatever himself could discover by the Strength of Nature or Industry But however that we may not mistake the Elogies of those Ancients who call him the  Father of Arts and Sciences  and be surpriz'd to find so little of them as they are now in Perfection in his Works we should know that this Character is not to be understood at large as if he had included the full and regular Systems of every thing He is to be consider'd professedly only in Quality of a Poet this was his Business to which as whatever he knew was to be subservient so he has not fail'd to introduce those Strokes of Knowledge from the whole Circle of Arts and Sciences which the Subject demanded  either for Necessity or Ornament This will appear on a fair View of him in each of these Lights  History  Before his Time there were no  Historians  in  Greece  He treated Historically of past Transactions according as he could be inform'd by Tradition Song or whatever Method there was of preserving their Memory For this we have the Consent of Antiquity they have generally more appeal'd to his Authority and more insisted on it than on the Testimony of any other Writer when they treat of the Rites Customs and Manners of the first Times They have generally believ'd that the Acts of  Tydeus  at  Thebes  the second Siege of that City the Settlement of  Rhodes  the Battel between the  Curetes  and the  Aetolians  the Account of the Kings of  Mycenae  by the Sceptre of  Agamemnon  the Acts of the  Greeks  at  Troy  and many other such Accounts are some of them wholly preserv'd by him and the rest as faithfully related as by any Historian Nor perhaps was all of his Invention which seems to be feign'd but rather frequently the obscure Traces and Remains of real Persons and Actions which as  Strabo  l    Strabo  observes when History was transmitted by Oral Tradition might be mix'd with Fable before it came into the Hands of the Poet  "This happen'd says he to  Herodotus  the first professed Historian who is often as fabulous as  Homer  when he defers to the common Reports of Countreys and it is not to be reckon'd to either as a fault but as a necessity of the Times"  Nay the very Passages which cause us to tax them at this distance with being fabulous might be occasion'd by their Diligence and a fear of erring if they too hastily rejected those Reports which had pass'd current in the Nations they describ'd  Geography  Before his Time there was no such thing as  Geography  in  Greece  For this we have the Suffrage of  Strabo  ibid initio  Strabo  the best of Geographers who approves the Opinion of  Hipparchus  and other Ancients that  Homer  was the very Author of it and upon this Account begins his Treatise of the Science itself with an  Encomium  on him As to the general Part of it we find he had a Knowledge of the  Earth  's being surrounded with  the  Ocean  because he makes the  Sun  and  Stars  both to rise and set in it and that he knew the  Use  of the  Stars  is plain from his making  Odyss  l  ℣  Ulysses  sail by the Observation of them But the Instance oftnest alledg'd upon this Point is the  Iliad ℣  c  Shield  of  Achilles  where he places the  Earth  encompass'd with the  Sea  and gives the Stars the Names they are yet known by as the  Hyades Pleiades  the  Bear  and  Orion  By the three first of these he represents the Constellations of the Northern Region and in the last he gives a single Representative of the Southern to which as it were for a counterbalance he adds a Title of Greatness  Then he tells us that the  Bear  or  Stars  of the  Arctick Circle  never disappear as an Observation which agrees with no other And if to this we add what  Eratosthenes  thought he meant that the five Plates which were fastened on the Shield divided it by the Lines where they met into the five  Zones  it will appear an original design of  Globes  and  Spheres  In the particular Parts of  Geography  his Knowledge is intirely incontestable  Strabo  refers to him upon all occasions allowing that he knew the Extreams of the Earth some of which he names and others describes by Signs as the  Fortunate Islands  The same  Strabo  l    Author takes notice of his Accounts concerning the several Soils Plants Animals and Customs as  Aegypt  's being fertile of medicinal Herbs  Lybia  's Fruitfulness where the Sheep have Horns and yean thrice a Year  c  which are Knowledges that make  Geography  more various and profitable But what all have agreed to celebrate is his Description of  Greece  which has had Laws made for its Preservation and Contests between Governments decided by its Authority Which  Strab  l    Strabo  acknowledges to have no Epithet or ornamental Expression for any Place that is not drawn from its Nature Quality or Circumstances and professes after so long an Interval to deviate from it only where the Countrey had undergone Alterations that cast the Description into Obscurity  Rhetorick  In his time  Rhetorick  was not known that Art took its Rise out of Poetry which was not 'till then establish'd  "The  Oratorial Elocution says  Strabo  l    Strabo  is but an Imitation of the Poetical this appear'd first and was approv'd They who imitated it took off the Measures but still preserv'd all the other Parts of Poetry in their Writings Such as these were  Cadmus  the  Milesian Pherecydes  and  Hecataeus  Then their Followers took something more from what was left and at last Elocution descended into the Prose which is now among us"  But if  Rhetorick  is owing to Poetry the Obligation is still more due to  Homer  He as  Quintil  l    cap    Quintilian  tells us gave both the Pattern and Rise to all the Parts of it  "  Hic omnibus eloquentiae partibus exemplum ortum dedit hunc nemo in magnis rebus sublimitate in parvis proprietate superavit Idem laetus pressus jucundus gravis tùm copiâ tùm brevitate admirabilis nec Poeticâ modò sed oratoriâ virtute eminentissimus  "  From him therefore they who settled the Art found it proper to deduce the Rules which was easily done when they had divided their Observations into the  Kinds  and the  Ornaments  of Elocution For the  Kinds  the  "Ancients says  Aulus Gell  l    cap    A Gell  settled them according to the three which they observe in his principal Speakers his  Ulysses  who is magnificent and flowing his  Menelaus  who is short and close and his  Nestor  who is moderate and dispassion'd and has a kind of middle Eloquence participating of both the former"  And for the  Ornaments  Arist  Topic  Aristotle  the great Master of the Rhetoricians shows what deference is paid to  Homer  when he orders the Orator to lay down his Heads and express both the Manners and Affections of his Work with an Imitation of that Diction and those Figures which the  divine Homer  excel'd in This is the constant Language of those who succeeded him and the Opinion so far prevail'd as to make  Quintil  l    Quintilian  observe that they who have written concerning the Arts of Speaking take from  Homer  most of the Instances of their Similitudes Amplifications Examples Digressions and Arguments  Natural Philosophy  As to  Natural Philosophy  the Age was not arriv'd in which it flourish'd however some of its Notions may be trac'd in  him As when he says that the Fountains and Rivers come from the Ocean he holds a  Circulation of Fluids  in the Earth But as this is a Branch of Learning which does not lie much in the way of a Poet who speaks of Heroes and Wars the desire to prove his Knowledge this way has only run  Politian  Praesatio in Hom  Politian  and others into trifling Inferences as when they would have it that he understood Nature because he mentions Sun Rain Wind and Thunder The most probable way of making out his Knowledge in this kind is by supposing he couch'd it in  Allegories  and that he sometimes us'd the  Names of the Gods  as his  Terms  for the  Elements  as the  Chymists  now use them for  Metals  But in applying this to him we must tread very carefully not searching for Allegory too industriously where the Passage may instruct by Example and endeavouring rather to find the Fable an Ornament to what is easily known than to make it a Cover to curious and unknown Problems  Physick  As for  Medicine  something of it must have been understood in that Age though it was so far from Perfection that according to  Celsus  lib    Celsus  what concern'd Diet was invented long afterwards by  Hippocrates  The Accidents of Life make the Search after Remedies too indispensible a Duty to be neglected at any time Accordingly he  Odvss  l  ℣  tells us that the  Aegyptians  who had many medicinal Plants in their Countrey were all Physicians and perhaps he might have learnt his own Skill from his Acquaintance with that Nation The State of War which  Greece  had liv'd in requir'd a Knowledge in the healing of Wounds and this might make him breed his Princes  Achilles Patroclus Podalirius  and  Machaon  to the Science What  Homer  thus attributes to others he knew himself and he has given us reason to believe not slightly For if we consider his Insight into the Structure of the human Body it is so nice that he has been judg'd by some to have wounded his Heroes with too much Science Or if we observe his Cure of Wounds which are the Accidents proper to an Epic Poem we find him directing the Chirurgical Operation sometimes  infusing  Il ℣  and  Il  in fine  Lenitives and at other times bitter Powders when the Effusion of Blood requir'd astringent Qualities  Statuary  For  Statuary  it appears by the Accounts of  Aegypt  and the  Palladium  that there was enough of it very early in the World for those Images which were requir'd in the Worship of their Gods but there are none mention'd as valuable in  Greece  so early nor was the Art establish'd on its Rules before  Homer  He found it agreeable to the Worship in use and necessary for his Machinery that his Gods should be cloath'd in Bodies Wherefore he took care to give them such as carry'd the utmost Perfection of the human Form and distinguish'd them from each other even in this superior Beauty with such Marks as were agreeable to each of the Deities  "This says  Strabo  l    Strabo  awaken'd the Conceptions of the eminent Statuaries while they strove to keep up the Grandeur of that Idea which  Homer  had impress'd upon their Imagination as we read of  Phidias  concerning the Statue of  Jupiter  "  And because they copy'd their Gods from him in their best Performances his Descriptions became the  Characters  which were afterwards pursu'd in all Works of a good Taste Hence came the common Saying of the Ancients  "That either  Homer  was the only Man who had seen the Forms of the Gods or the only one who had shown them to Men"  a Passage which  Dacier  Preface to  Homer  Madam  Dacier  wrests to prove the Truth of his Theology different from  Strabo  's Acceptation of it  There are besides what we have spoken of other Sciences pretended to be found in him Thus  Macrobius  discovers that the  Chain  with which  Il ℣  Vid  Macrob  de somn Scip l    c    Jupiter  says he could lift the World is a metaphysical Notion that means a Connexion of all Things from the supream Being to the meanest Part of the Creation Others to prove him skilful in judicial Astrology bring a Quotation concerning the Births of  Il ℣  Hector  and  Polydamas  on the same Night who were nevertheless of different Qualifications one excelling in War  and the other in Eloquence Others again will have him to be vers'd in Magick from his Stories concerning  Ciree  These and many of the like Nature are Interpretations strain'd or trifling such as  Homer  does not want for a Proof of his Learning and by which we contribute nothing to raise his Character while we sacrifice our Judgment to him in the Eyes of others  It is sufficient to have gone thus far in shewing he was a Father of Learning a Soul capable of ranging over the whole Creation with an intellectual View shining alone in an Age of Obscurity and shining beyond those who have had the Opportunity of more learned Ages leaving behind him a Work adorn'd with the Knowledge of his own Time and in which he has beforehand broken up the Fountains of several Sciences which were brought nearer to Perfection by Posterity A Work which shall always stand at the top of the sublime Character to be gaz'd at by Readers with an Admiration of its Perfection and by Writers with a Despair that it should ever be emulated with Success  FINIS  ERRATA in the ESSAY  PAge line for  brings him  read  brings it  Pag in the References

Priest of  Apollo  comes to the  Grecian  Camp to ransome her with which the Action of the Poem opens in the Tenth Year of the Siege The Priest being refus'd and insolently dismiss'd by  Agamemnon  intreats for Vengeance from his God who inflicts a Pestilence on the  Greeks Achilles  calls a Council and encourages  Chalcas  to declare the Cause of it who attributes it to the Refusal of  Chruseis  The King being obliged to send back his Captive enters into a furious Contest with  Achilles  which  Nestor  pacifies however as he had the absolute Command of the Army he seizes on  Briseis  in revenge  Achilles  in discontent withdraws himself and his Forces from the rest of the  Greeks  and complaining to  Thetis  she supplicates  Jupiter  to render them sensible of the Wrong done to her Son by giving Victory to the  Trojans Jupiter  granting her Suit incenses  Juno  between whom the Debate runs high 'till they are reconciled by the Address of  Vulcan  The  Time  of two and twenty Days is taken up in this Book nine during the Plague one in the Council and Quarrel of the Princes and twelve for  Jupiter  's Stay with the  Aethiopians  at whose Return  Thetis  prefers her Petition The Scene lies in the  Grecian  Camp then changes to  Chrysa  and lastly to the Gods on  Olympus  THE FIRST BOOK OF THE ILIAD  THE Wrath of  Peleus'  Son the direful Spring  Of all the  Grecian  Woes O Goddess sing  That Wrath which hurl'd to  Pluto  's gloomy Reign  The Souls of mighty Chiefs untimely slain  Whose Limbs unbury'd on the naked Shore  Devouring Dogs and hungry Vultures tore  Since Great  Achilles  and  Atrides  strove  Such was the Sov'reign Doom and such the Will of  Jove  Declare O Muse in what illfated Hour  Sprung the fierce Strife from what offended Pow'r  Latona  's Son a dire Contagion spread  And heap'd the Camp with Mountains of the Dead  The King of Men his Rev'rend Priest defy'd  And for the King's Offence the People dy'd  For  Chryses  sought with costly Gifts to gain  His Captive Daughter from the Victor's Chain  Suppliant the Venerable Father stands  Apollo  's awful Ensigns grace his Hands  By these he begs and lowly bending down  Extends the Sceptre and the Laurel Crown  He su'd to All but chief implor'd for Grace  The BrotherKings of  Atreus'  Royal Race  Ye Kings and Warriors may your Vows be crown'd  And  Troy's  proud Walls lie level with the Ground  May  Jove  restore you when your Toils are o'er  Safe to the Pleasures of your native Shore  But oh relieve a wretched Parent's Pain  And give  Chruseis  to these Arms again  If Mercy fail yet let my Presents move  And dread avenging  Phoebus  Son of  Jove  The  Greeks  in Shouts their joint Assent declare  The Priest to rev'rence and release the Fair  Not so  Atrides  He with Kingly Pride  Repuls'd the sacred Sire and thus reply'd  Hence on thy Life and fly these hostile Plains  Nor ask Presumptuous what the King detains  Hence with thy Laurel Crown and Golden Rod  Nor trust too far those Ensigns of thy God  Mine is thy Daughter Priest and shall remain  And Pray'rs and Tears and Bribes shall plead in vain  'Till Time shall rifle ev'ry youthful Grace  And Age dismiss her from my cold Embrace  In daily Labours of the Loom employ'd  Or doom'd to deck the Bed she once enjoy'd  Hence then to  Argos  shall the Maid retire  Far from her native Soil and weeping Sire  The trembling Priest along the Shore return'd  And in the Anguish of a Father mourn'd  Disconsolate nor daring to complain  Silent he wander'd by the sounding Main  'Till safe at distance to his God he prays  The God who darts around the World his Rays  O  Smintheus  sprung from fair  Latona  's Line  Thou Guardian Pow'r of  Cilla  the Divine  Thou Source of Light whom  Tenedos  adores  And whose bright Presence gilds thy  Chrysa  's Shores  If e'er with Wreaths I hung thy sacred Fane  Or fed the Flames with Fat of Oxen slain  God of the Silver Bow thy Shafts employ  Avenge thy Servant and the  Greeks  destroy  Thus  Chryses  pray'd the fav'ring Pow'r attends  And from  Olympus'  lofty Tops descends  Bent was his Bow the  Grecian  Hearts to wound  Fierce as he mov'd his Silver Shafts resound  Breathing Revenge a sudden Night he spread  And gloomy Darkness roll'd around his Head  The Fleet in View he twang'd his deadly Bow  And hissing fly the feather'd Fates below  On Mules and Dogs th' Infection first began  And last the vengeful Arrows fix'd in Man  For nine long Nights thro' all the dusky Air  The Fires thickflaming shot a dismal Glare  But ere the tenth revolving Day was run  Inspir'd by  Juno Thetis'  Godlike Son  Conven'd to Council all the  Grecian  Train  For much the Goddess mourn'd her Heroes slain  Th' Assembly seated rising o'er the rest  Achilles  thus the King of Men addrest  Why leave we not the fatal  Trojan  Shore  And measure back the Seas we crost before  The Plague destroying whom the Sword would spare  'Tis time to save the few Remains of War  But let some Prophet or some sacred Sage  Explore the Cause of great  Apollo  's Rage  Or learn the wastful Vengeance to remove  By mystic Dreams for Dreams descend from  Jove  If broken Vows this heavy Curse have laid  Let Altars smoke and Hecatombs be paid  So Heav'n aton'd shall dying  Greece  restore  And  Phoebus  dart his burning Shafts no more  He said and sate when  Chalcas  thus reply'd  Chalcas  the wise the  Grecian  Priest and Guide  That sacred Seer whose comprehensive View  The past the present and the future knew  Uprising slow the venerable Sage  Thus spoke the Prudence and the Fears of Age  Belov'd of  Jove Achilles  wou'dst thou know  Why angry  Phoebus  bends his fatal Bow  First give thy Faith and plight a Prince's Word  Of sure Protection by thy Pow'r and Sword  For I must speak what Wisdom would conceal  And Truths invidious to the Great reveal  Bold is the Task when Subjects grown too wise  Instruct a Monarch where his Error lies  For tho' we deem the shortliv'd Fury past  'Tis sure the Mighty will revenge at last  To whom  Pelides  From thy inmost Soul  Speak what thou know'st and speak without controul  Ev'n by that God I swear who rules the Day  To whom thy Hands the Vows of  Greece  convey  And whose blest Oracles thy Lips declare  Long as  Achilles  breathes this vital Air  No daring  Greek  of all the num'rous Band  Against his Priest shall lift an impious Hand  Not ev'n the Chief by whom our Hosts are led  The King of Kings shall touch that sacred Head  Encourag'd thus the blameless Priest replies  Nor Vows unpaid nor slighted Sacrifice  But He our Chief provok'd the raging Pest  Appollo  's Vengeance for his injur'd Priest  Nor will the God's awaken'd Fury cease  But Plagues shall spread and Fun'ral Fires increase  'Till the great King without a Ransom paid  To her own  Chrysa  send the blackey'd Maid  Perhaps with added Sacrifice and Pray'r  The Priest may pardon and the God may spare  The Prophet spoke when with a gloomy Frown  The Monarch started from his shining Throne  Black Choler fill'd his Breast that boil'd with Ire  And from his Eyeballs flash'd the living Fire  Augur accurst denouncing Mischief still  Prophet of Plagues for ever boding Ill  Still must that Tongue some wounding Message bring  And still thy Priestly Pride provoke thy King  For this are  Phoebus'  Oracles explor'd  To teach the  Greeks  to murmur at their Lord  For this with Falshoods is my Honour stain'd  Is Heav'n offended and a Priest profan'd  Because my Prize my beauteous Maid I hold  And heav'nly Charms prefer to proffer'd Gold  A Maid unmatch'd in Manners as in Face  Skill'd in each Art and crown'd with ev'ry Grace  Not half so dear were  Clytemnestra  's Charms  When first her blooming Beauties blest my Arms  Yet if the Gods demand her let her sail  Our Cares are only for the Publick Weal  Let me be deem'd the hateful Cause of all  And suffer rather than my People fall  The Prize the beauteous Prize I will resign  So dearly valu'd and so justly mine  But since for common Good I yield the Fair  My private Loss let grateful  Greece  repair  Nor unrewarded let your Prince complain  That He alone has fought and bled in vain  Insatiate King  Achilles  thus replies  Fond of the Pow'r but fonder of the Prize  Would'st thou the  Greeks  their lawful Prey shou'd yield  The due Reward of many a wellfought Field  The Spoils of Cities raz'd and Warriors slain  We share with Justice as with Toil we gain  But to resume whate'er thy Av'rice craves  That Trick of Tyrants may be born by Slaves  Yet if our Chief for Plunder only fight  The Spoils of  Ilion  shall thy Loss requite  Whene'er by  Jove  's Decree our conqu'ring Pow'rs  Shall humble to the Dust her lofty Tow'rs  Then thus the King Shall I my Prize resign  With tame Content and Thou possest of thine  Great as thou art and like a God in Fight  Think not to rob me of a Soldier's Right  At thy Demand shall I restore the Maid  First let the just Equivalent be paid  Such as a King might ask and let it be  A Treasure worthy Her and worthy Me  Or grant me this or with a Monarch's Claim  This Hand shall seize some other Captive Dame  The mighty  Ajax  shall his Prize resign  Ulysses'  Spoils or ev'n thy own be mine  The Man who suffers loudly may complain  And rage he may but he shall rage in vain  But this when Time requiresIt now remains  We launch a Bark to plow the watry Plains  And waft the Sacrifice to  Chrysa  's Shores  With chosen Pilots and with lab'ring Oars  Soon shall the Fair the sable Ship ascend  And some deputed Prince the Charge attend  This  Creta  's King or  Ajax  shall fulfill  Or wise  Ulysses  see perform'd our Will  Or if our Royal Pleasure shall ordain  Achilles  self conduct her o'er the Main  Let fierce  Achilles  dreadful in his Rage  The God propitiate and the Pest asswage  At this  Pelides  frowning stern reply'd  O Tyrant arm'd with Insolence and Pride  Inglorious Slave to Int'rest ever join'd  With Fraud unworthy of a Royal Mind  What gen'rous  Greek  obedient to thy Word  Shall form an Ambush or shall lift the Sword  What Cause have I to war at thy Decree  The distant  Trojans  never injur'd me  To  Pthia  's Realms no hostile Troops they led  Safe in her Vales my warlike Coursers fed  Far hence remov'd the hoarseresounding Main  And Walls of Rocks secure my native Reign  Whose fruitful Soil luxuriant Harvests grace  Rich in her Fruits and in her martial Race  Hither we sail'd a voluntary Throng  T' avenge a private not a publick Wrong  What else to  Troy  th' assembled Nations draws  But thine Ungrateful and thy Brother's Cause  Is this the Pay our Blood and Toils deserve  Disgrac'd and injur'd by the Man we serve  And dar'st thou threat to snatch my Prize away  Due to the Deeds of many a dreadful Day  A Prize as small O Tyrant match'd with thine  As thy own Actions if compar'd to mine  Thine in each Conquest is the wealthy Prey  Tho' mine the Sweat and Danger of the Day  Some trivial Present to my Ships I bear  Or barren Praises pay the Wounds of War  But know proud Monarch I'm thy Slave no more  My Fleet shall waft me to  Thessalia  's Shore  Left by  Achilles  on the  Trojan  Plain  What Spoils what Conquests shall  Atrides  gain  To this the King Fly mighty Warriour fly  Thy Aid we need not and thy Threats defy  There want not Chiefs in such a Cause to fight  And  Jove  himself shall guard a Monarch's Right  Of all the Kings the Gods distinguish'd Care  To Pow'r superior none such Hatred bear  Strife and Debate thy restless Soul employ  And Wars and Horrors are thy savage Joy  If thou hast Strength 'twas Heav'n that Strength bestow'd  For know vain Man thy Valour is from God  Haste launch thy Vessels fly with Speed away  Rule thy own Realms with arbitrary Sway  I heed thee not but prize at equal rate  Thy shortliv'd Friendship and thy groundless Hate  Go threat thy Earthborn  Myrmidons  but here  'Tis mine to threaten Prince and thine to fear  Know if the God the beauteous Dame demand  My Bark shall waft her to her native Land  But then prepare Imperious Prince prepare  Fierce as thou art to yield thy captive Fair  Ev'n in thy Tent I'll seize the blooming Prize  Thy lov'd  Briseïs  with the radiant Eyes  Hence shalt thou prove my Might and curse the Hour  Thou stood'st a Rival of Imperial Pow'r  And hence to all our Host it shall be known  That Kings are subject to the Gods alone  Achilles  heard with Grief and Rage opprest  His Heart swell'd high and labour'd in his Breast  Distracting Thoughts by turns his Bosom rul'd  Now fir'd by Wrath and now by Reason cool'd  That prompts his Hand to draw the deadly Sword  Force thro' the  Greeks  and pierce their haughty Lord  This whispers soft his Vengeance to controul  And calm the rising Tempest of his Soul  Just as in Anguish of Suspence he stay'd  While half unsheath'd appear'd the glitt'ring Blade  Minerva  swift descended from above  Sent by the  Juno  Sister and the Wife of  Jove  For both the Princes claim'd her equal Care  Behind she stood and by the Golden Hair  Achilles  seiz'd to him alone confest  A sable Cloud conceal'd her from the rest  He saw and sudden to the Goddess cries  Known by the Flames that sparkled from her Eyes  Descends  Minerva  in her guardian Care  A heav'nly Witness of the Wrongs I bear  From  Atreus'  Son Then let those Eyes that view  The daring Crime behold the Vengeance too  Forbear the Progeny of  Jove  replies  To calm thy Fury I forsook the Skies  Let great  Achilles  to the Gods resign'd  To Reason yield the Empire o'er his Mind  By awful  Juno  this Command is giv'n  The King and You are both the Care of Heav'n  The Force of keen Reproaches let him feel  But sheath Obedient thy revenging Steel  For I pronounce and trust a heav'nly Pow'r  Thy injur'd Honour has its fated Hour  When the proud Monarch shall thy Arms implore  And bride thy Friendship with a boundless Store  Then let Revenge no longer bear the Sway  Command thy Passions and the Gods obey  To her  Pelides  With regardful Ear  'Tis just O Goddess I thy Dictates hear  Hard as it is my Vengeance I suppress  Those who revere the Gods the Gods will bless  He said observant of the blueey'd Maid  Then in the Sheath return'd the shining Blade  The Goddess swift to high  Olympus  flies  And joins the sacred Senate of the Skies  Nor yet the Rage his boiling Breast forsook  Which thus redoubling on the Monarch broke  O Monster mix'd of Insolence and Fear  Thou Dog in Forehead but in Heart a Deer  When wert thou known in ambush'd Fights to dare  Or nobly face the horrid Front of War  'Tis ours the Chance of fighting Fields to try  Thine to look on and bid the Valiant dye  So much 'tis safer thro' the Camp to go  And rob a Subject than despoil a Foe  Scourage of thy People violent and base  Sent in  Jove  's Anger on a slavish Race  Who lost to Sense of gen'rous Freedom past  Are tam'd to Wrongs or this had been thy last  Now by this sacred Sceptre hear me swear  Which never more shall Leaves or Blossoms bear  Which sever'd from the Trunk as I from thee  On the bare Mountains left its Parent Tree  This Sceptre form'd by temper'd Steel to prove  An Ensign of the Delegates of  Jove  From whom the Pow'r of Laws and Justice springs  Tremendous Oath inviolate to Kings  By this I swear when bleeding  Greece  again  Shall call  Achilles  she shall call in vain  When flush'd with Slaughter  Hector  comes to spread  The purpled Shore with Mountains of the Dead  Then shalt thou mourn th' Affront thy Madness gave  Forc'd to deplore when impotent to save  Then rage in Bitterness of Soul to know  This Act has made the bravest  Greek  thy Foe  He spoke and furious hurl'd against the Ground  His Sceptre starr'd with golden Studs around  Then sternly silent sate With like Disdain  The raging King return'd his Frowns again  To calm their Passion with the Words of Age  Slow from his Seat arose the  Pylian  Sage  Th' experienc'd  Nestor  in Persuasion skill'd  Words sweet as Honey from his Lips distill'd  Two Generations now had past away  Wise by his Rules and happy by his Sway  Two Ages o'er his native Realm he reign'd  And now th' Example of the third remain'd  All view'd with Awe the Venerable Man  Who thus with mild Benevolence began  What Shame what Woe is this to  Greece  what Joy  To  Troy  's proud Monarch and the Friends of  Troy  That adverse Gods commit to stern Debate  The best the bravest of the  Grecian  State  Young as you are this youthful Heat restrain  Nor think your  Nestor  's Years and Wisdom vain  A Godlike Race of Heroes once I knew  Such as no more these aged Eyes shall view  Lives there a Chief to match  Pirithous'  Fame  Dryas  the bold or  Ceneus'  deathless Name  Theseus  endu'd with more than mortal Might  Or  Polyphemus  like the Gods in Fight  With these of old to Toils of Battel bred  In early Youth my hardy Days I led  Fir'd with the Thirst which Virtuous Envy breeds  And smit with Love of Honourable Deeds  Strongest of Men they pierc'd the Mountain Boar  Rang'd the wild Desarts red with Monsters Gore  And from their Hills the shaggy  Centaurs  tore  Yet these with soft persuasive Arts I sway'd  When  Nestor  spoke they listen'd and obey'd  If in my Youth ev'n these esteem'd me wise  Do you young Warriors hear my Age advise  Atrides  seize not on the beauteous Slave  That Prize the  Greeks  by common Suffrage gave  Nor thou  Achilles  treat our Prince with Pride  Let Kings be just and Sov'reign Pow'r preside  Thee the first Honours of the War adorn  Like Gods in Strength and of a Goddess born  Him awful Majesty exalts above  The Pow'rs of Earth and sceptred Sons of  Jove  Let both unite with wellconsenting Mind  So shall Authority with Strength be join'd  Leave me O King to calm  Achilles'  Rage  Rule thou thy self as more advanc'd in Age  Forbid it Gods  Achilles  should be lost  The Pride of  Greece  and Bulwark of our Host  This said he ceas'd The King of Men replies  Thy Years are awful and thy Words are wise  But that imperious that unconquer'd Soul  No Laws can limit no Respect controul  Before his Pride must his Superiors fall  His Word the Law and He the Lord of all  Him must our Hosts our Chiefs our Self obey  What King can bear a Rival in his Sway  Grant that the Gods his matchless Force have giv'n  Has foul Reproach a Privilege from Heav'n  Here on the Monarch's Speech  Achilles  broke  And furious thus and interrupting spoke  Tyrant I well deserv'd thy galling Chain  To live thy Slave and still to serve in vain  Should I submit to each unjust Decree  Command thy Vassals but command not Me  Seize on  Briseïs  whom the  Grecians  doom'd  My Prize of War yet tamely see resum'd  And seize secure No more  Achilles  draws  His conqu'ring Sword in any Woman's Cause  The Gods command me to forgive the past  But let this first Invasion be the last  For know thy Blood when next thou dar'st invade  Shall stream in Vengeance on my reeking Blade  At this they ceas'd the stern Debate expir'd  The Chiefs in sullen Majesty retir'd  Achilles  with  Patroclus  took his Way  Where near his Tents his hollow Vessels lay  Mean time  Atrides  launch'd with num'rous Oars  A wellrigg'd Ship for  Chrysa  's sacred Shores  High on the Deck was fair  Chruseis  plac'd  And sage  Ulysses  with the Conduct grac'd  Safe in her Sides the Hecatomb they stow'd  Then swiftly sailing cut the liquid Road  The Host to expiate next the King prepares  With pure Lustrations and with solemn Pray'rs  Wash'd by the briny Wave the pious Train  Are cleans'd and cast th' Ablutions in the Main  Along the Shore whole Hecatombs were laid  And Bulls and Goats to  Phoebus'  Altars paid  The sable Fumes in curling Spires arise  And waft their grateful Odours to the Skies  The Army thus in sacred Rites engag'd  Atrides  still with deep Resentment rag'd  To wait his Will two sacred Heralds stood  Talthybius  and  Eurybates  the good  Haste to the fierce  Achilles'  Tent he cries  Thence bear  Briseïs  as our Royal Prize  Submit he must or if they will not part  Ourself in Arms shall tear her from his Heart  Th' unwilling Heralds act their Lord's Commands  Pensive they walk along the barren Sands  Arriv'd the Heroe in his Tent they find  With gloomy Aspect on his Arm reclin'd  At awful Distance long they silent stand  Loth to advance or speak their hard Command  Decent Confusion This the Godlike Man  Perceiv'd and thus with Accent mild began  With Leave and Honour enter our Abodes  Ye sacred Ministers of Men and Gods  I know your Message by Constraint you came  Not you but your Imperious Lord I blame  Patroclus  haste the fair  Briseïs  bring  Conduct my Captive to the haughty King  But witness Heralds and proclaim my Vow  Witness to Gods above and Men below  But first and loudest to your Prince declare  That lawless Tyrant whose Commands you bear  Unmov'd as Death  Achilles  shall remain  Tho' prostrate  Greece  should bleed at ev'ry Vein  The raging Chief in frantick Passion lost  Blind to himself and useless to his Host  Unskill'd to judge the Future by the Past  In Blood and Slaughter shall repent at last  Patroclus  now th' unwilling Beauty brought  She in soft Sorrows and in pensive Thought  Supported by the Chiefs on either Hand  In Silence past along the winding Strand  Not so his Loss the fierce  Achilles  bore  But sad retiring to the sounding Shore  O'er the wild Margin of the Deep he hung  That kindred Deep from whence his Mother sprung  There bath'd in Tears of Anger and Disdain  Thus loud lamented to the stormy Main  O Parent Goddess since in early Bloom  Thy Son must fall by too severe a Doom  Sure to so short a Race of Glory born  Great  Jove  in Justice should this Span adorn  Honour and Fame at least the Thund'rer ow'd  And ill he pays the Promise of a God  If yon proud Monarch thus thy Son defies  Obscures my Glories and resumes my Prize  Far in the deep Recesses of the Main  Where aged  Ocean  holds his wat'ry Reign  The GoddessMother heard The Waves divide  And like a Mist she rose above the Tide  Beheld him mourning on the naked Shores  And thus the Sorrows of his Soul explores  Why grieves my Son Thy Anguish let me share  Reveal the Cause and trust a Parent's Care  He deeply sighing said To tell my Woe  Is but to mention what too well you know  From  Thebe  sacred to  Apollo  's Name    Aetion  's Realm our conqu'ring Army came  With Treasure loaded and triumphant Spoils  Whose just Division crown'd the Soldier's Toils  But bright  Chruseïs  heav'nly Prize was led  By Vote selected to the Gen'ral's Bed  The Priest of  Phoebus  sought by Gifts to gain  His beauteous Daughter from the Victor's Chain  The Fleet he reach'd and lowly bending down  Held forth the Sceptre and the Laurel Crown  Entreating All but chief implor'd for Grace  The Brother Kings of  Atreus'  Royal Race  The gen'rous  Greeks  their joint Consent declare  The Priest to rev'rence and release the Fair  Not so  Atrides  He with wonted Pride  The Sire insulted and his Gifts deny'd  Th' insulted Sire his God's peculiar Care  To  Phoebus  pray'd and  Phoebus  heard the Pray'r  A dreadful Plague ensues Th' avenging Darts  Incessant fly and pierce the  Grecian  Hearts  A Prophet then inspir'd by Heav'n arose  And points the Crime and thence derives the Woes  My self the first th' assembl'd Chiefs incline  T'avert the Vengeance of the Pow'r Divine  Then rising in his Wrath the Monarch storm'd  Incens'd he threaten'd and his Threats perform'd  The fair  Chruseïs  to her Sire was sent  With offer'd Gifts to make the God relent  But now He seiz'd  Briseïs'  heav'nly Charms  And of my Valour's Prize defrauds my Arms  Defrauds the Votes of all the  Grecian  Train  And Service Faith and Justice plead in vain  But Goddess thou thy suppliant Son attend  To high  Olympus'  shining Court ascend  Urge all the Ties to former Service ow'd  And sue for Vengeance to the Thund'ring God  Oft hast thou triumph'd in the glorious Boast  That thou stood'st forth of all th'Aethereal Host  When bold Rebellion shook the Realms above  The undaunted Guard of Cloudcompelling  Jove  When the bright Partner of his awful Reign  The Warlike Maid and Monarch of the Main  The TraytorGods by mad Ambition driv'n  Durst threat with Chains th' Omnipotence of Heav'n  Then call'd by thee the Monster  Titan  came  Whom Gods  Briareus  Men  Aegeon  name  Thro' wondring Skies enormous stalk'd along  Not  Neptune  He that shakes the solid Earth so strong  With GiantPride at  Jove  's high Throne he stands  And brandish'd round him all his Hundred Hands  Th' affrighted Gods confess'd their awful Lord  They dropt the Fetters trembled and ador'd  This Goddess this to his Remembrance call  Embrace his Knees at his Tribunal fall  Conjure him far to drive the  Grecian  Train  To hurl them headlong to their Fleet and Main  To heap the Shores with copious Death and bring  The  Greeks  to know the Curse of such a King  Let  Agamemnon  lift his haughty Head  O'er all his wide Dominion of the Dead  And mourn in Blood that e'er he durst disgrace  The boldest Warrior of the  Grecian  Race  Unhappy Son fair  Thetis  thus replies  While Tears Celestial trickled from her Eyes  Why have I born thee with a Mother's Throes  To Fates averse and nurs'd for future Woes  So short a Space the Light of Heav'n to view  So short a Space and fill'd with Sorrow too  Oh might a Parent's careful Wish prevail  Far far from  Ilion  should thy Vessels sail  And thou from Camps remote the Danger shun  Which now alas too nearly threats my Son  Yet what I can to move thy Suit I'll go  To great  Olympus  crown'd with fleecy Snow  Mean time secure within thy Ships from far  Behold the Field nor mingle in the War  The Sire of Gods and all th' Etherial Train  On the warm Limits of the farthest Main  Now mix with Mortals nor disdain to grace  The Feasts of  Aethiopia  's blameless Race  Twelve Days the Pow'rs indulge the Genial Rite  Returning with the twelfth revolving Light  Then will I mount the Brazen Dome and move  The high Tribunal of Immortal  Jove  The Goddess spoke The rowling Waves unclose  Then down the Deep she plung'd from whence she rose  And left him sorrowing on the lonely Coast  In wild Resentment for the Fair he lost  In  Chrysa  's Port now sage  Ulysses  rode  Beneath the Deck the destin'd Victims stow'd  The Sails they furl'd they lash'd the Mast aside  And dropt their Anchors and the Pinnace ty'd  Next on the Shore their Hecatomb they land  Chruseïs  last descending on the Strand  Her thus returning from the furrow'd Main  Ulysses  led to  Phoebus  sacred Fane  Where at his solemn Altar as the Maid  He gave to  Chryses  thus the Heroe said  Hail Rev'rend Priest to  Phoebus'  awful Dome  A Suppliant I from great  Atrides  come  Unransom'd here receive the spotless Fair  Accept the Hecatomb the  Greeks  prepare  And may thy God who scatters Darts around  Aton'd by Sacrifice desist to wound  At this the Sire embrac'd the Maid again  So sadly lost so lately sought in vain  Then near the Altar of the darting King  Dispos'd in Rank their Hecatomb they bring  With Water purify their Hands and take  The sacred Off'ring of the salted Cake  While thus with Arms devoutly rais'd in Air  And solemn Voice the Priest directs his Pray'r  God of the Silver Bow thy Ear incline  Whose Power encircles  Cilla  the Divine  Whose sacred Eye thy  Tenedos  surveys  And gilds fair  Chrysa  with distinguish'd Rays  If fir'd to Vengeance at thy Priests request  Thy direful Darts inflict the raging Pest  Once more attend avert the wastful Woe  And smile propitious and unbend thy Bow  So  Chryses  pray'd  Apollo  heard his Pray'r  And now the  Greeks  their Hecatomb prepare  Between their Horns the salted Barley threw  And with their Heads to Heav'n the Victims slew  The Limbs they sever from th' inclosing Hide  The Thighs selected to the Gods divide  On these in double Cawls involv'd with Art  The choicest Morsels lay from ev'ry Part  The Priest himself before his Altar stands  And burns the Victims with his holy Hands  Pours the black Wine and sees the Flames aspire  The Youth with Instruments surround the Fire  The Thighs thus sacrific'd and Entrails drest  Th'Assistants part transfix and roast the rest  Then spread the Tables the Repast prepare  Each takes his Seat and each receives his Share  When now the Rage of Hunger was represt  With pure Libations they conclude the Feast  The Youths with Wine the copious Goblets crown'd  And pleas'd dispense the flowing Bowls around  With Hymns Divine the joyous Banquet ends  The  Paeans  lengthen'd 'till the Sun descends  The  Greeks  restor'd the grateful Notes prolong  Apollo  listens and approves the Song  'Twas Night the Chiefs beside their Vessel lie  'Till rosie Morn had purpled o'er the Sky  Then launch and hoise the Mast Indulgent Gales  Supply'd by  Phoebus  fill the swelling Sails  The milkwhite Canvas bellying as they blow  The parted Ocean foams and roars below  Above the bounding Billows swift they flew  'Till now the  Grecian  Camp appear'd in view  Far on the Beach they haul their Bark to Land  The crooked Keel divides the yellow Sand  Then part where stretch'd along the winding Bay  The Ships and Tents in mingled Prospect lay  But raging still amidst his Navy sate  The stern  Achilles  stedfast in his Hate  Nor mix'd in Combate nor in Council join'd  But wasting Cares lay heavy on his Mind  In his black Thoughts Revenge and Slaughter roll  And Scenes of Blood rise dreadful in his Soul  Twelve Days were past and now the dawning Light  The Gods had summon'd to th'  Olympian  Height  Jove  first ascending from the Wat'ry Bow'rs  Leads the long Order of Aetherial Pow'rs  When like a Morning Mist in early Day  Rose from the Flood the Daughter of the Sea  And to the Seats Divine her Flight addrest  There far apart and high above the rest  The Thund'rer sate where old  Olympus  shrouds  His hundred Heads in Heav'n and props the Clouds  Suppliant the Goddess stood One Hand she plac'd  Beneath his Beard and one his Knees embrac'd  If e'er O Father of the Gods she said  My Words cou'd please thee or my Actions aid  Some Marks of Honour on my Son bestow  And pay in Glory what in Life you owe  Fame is at least by Heav'nly Promise due  To Life so short and now dishonour'd too  Avenge this Wrong oh ever just and wise  Let  Greece  be humbled and the  Trojans  rise  'Till the proud King and all th'  Achaian  Race  Shall heap with Honours him they now disgrace  Thus  Thetis  spoke but  Jove  in Silence held  The facred Counsels of his Breast conceal'd  Not so repuls'd the Goddess closer prest  Still grasp'd his Knees and urg'd the dear Request  O Sire of Gods and Men thy Suppliant hear  Refuse or grant for what has  Jove  to fear  Or oh declare of all the Pow'rs above  Is wretched  Thetis  least the Care of  Jove  She said and sighing thus the God replies  Who rolls the Thunder o'er the vaulted Skies  What hast thou ask'd Ah why should  Jove  engage  In foreign Contests and domestic Rage  The Gods Complaints and  Juno  's fierce Alarms  While I too partial aid the  Trojan  Arms  Go lest the haughty Partner of my Sway  With jealous Eyes thy close Access survey  But part in Peace secure thy Pray'r is sped  Witness the sacred Honours of our Head  The Nod that ratifies the Will Divine  The faithful fix'd irrevocable Sign  This seals thy Suit and this fulfills thy Vows  He spoke and awful bends his sable Brows  Shakes his Ambrosial Curls and gives the Nod  The Stamp of Fate and Sanction of the God  High Heav'n with trembling the dread Signal took  And all  Olympus  to the Centre shook  Swift to the Seas profound the Goddess flies  Jove  to his starry Mansion in the Skies  The shining Synod of th' Immortals wait  The coming God and from their Thrones of State  Arising silent wrapt in Holy Fear  Before the Majesty of Heav'n appear  Trembling they stand while  Jove  assumes the Throne  All but the God's Imperious Queen alone  Late had she view'd the Silverfooted Dame  And all her Passions kindled into Flame  Say artful Manager of Heav'n she cries  Who now partakes the Secrets of the Skies  Thy  Juno  knows not the Decrees of Fate  In vain the Partner of Imperial State  What fav'rite Goddess then those Cares divides  Which  Jove  in Prudence from his Consort hides  To this the Thund'rer Seek not thou to find  The sacred Counsels of Almighty Mind  Involv'd in Darkness lies the great Decree  Nor can the Depths of Fate be pierc'd by thee  What fits thy Knowledge thou the first shalt know  The first of Gods above and Men below  But thou nor they shall search the Thoughts that roll  Deep in the close Recesses of my Soul  Full on the Sire the Goddess of the Skies  Roll'd the large Orbs of her majestic Eyes  And thus return'd Austere  Saturnius  say  From whence this Wrath or who controuls thy Sway  Thy boundless Will for me remains in Force  And all thy Counsels take the destin'd Course  But 'tis for  Greece  I fear For late was seen  In close Consult the Silverfooted Queen  Jove  to his  Thetis  nothing could deny  Nor was the Signal vain that shook the Sky  What fatal Favour has the Goddess won  To grace her fierce inexorable Son  Perhaps in  Grecian  Blood to drench the Plain  And glut his Vengeance with my People slain  Then thus the God Oh restless Fate of Pride  That strives to learn what Heav'n resolves to hide  Vain is the Search presumptuous and abhorr'd  Anxious to thee and odious to thy Lord  Let this suffice th' immutable Decree  No Force can shake What  is  that  ought  to be  Goddess submit nor dare our Will withstand  But dread the Pow'r of this avenging Hand  Th' united Strength of all the Gods above  In vain resists th' Omnipotence of  Jove  The Thund'rer spoke nor durst the Queen reply  A rev'rend Horror silenc'd all the Sky  The Feast disturb'd with Sorrow  Vulcan  saw  His Mother menac'd and the Gods in Awe  Peace at his Heart and Pleasure his Design  Thus interpos'd the Architect Divine  The wretched Quarrels of the mortal State  Are far unworthy Gods of your Debate  Let Men their Days in senseless Strife employ  We in eternal Peace and constant Joy  Thou GoddessMother with our Sire comply  Nor break the sacred Union of the Sky  Lest rouz'd to Rage he shake the blest Abodes  Launch the red Lightning and dethrone the Gods  If you submit the Thund'rer stands appeas'd  The gracious Pow'r is willing to be pleas'd  Thus  Vulcan  spoke and rising with a Bound  The double Bowl with sparkling  Nectar  crown'd  Which held to  Juno  in a chearful way  Goddess he cry'd be patient and obey  Dear as you are if  Jove  his Arm extend  I can but grieve unable to defend  What God so daring in your Aid to move  Or lift his Hand against the Force of  Jove  Once in your Cause I felt his matchless Might  Hurl'd headlong downward from th' Etherial Height  Tost all the Day in rapid Circles round  Nor 'till the Sun descended touch'd the Ground  Breathless I fell in giddy Motion lost  The  Sinthians  rais'd me on the  Lemnian  Coast  He said and to her Hands the Goblet heav'd  Which with a Smile the whitearm'd Queen receiv'd  Then to the rest he fill'd and in his Turn  Each to his Lips apply'd the nectar'd Urn  Vulcan  with awkward Grace his Office plies  And unextinguish'd Laughter shakes the Skies  Thus the blest Gods the Genial Day prolong  In Feasts Ambrosial and Celestial Song  Apollo  tun'd the Lyre the  Muses  round  With Voice alternate aid the silver Sound  Meantime the radiant Sun to mortal Sight  Descending swift roll'd down the rapid Light  Then to their starry Domes the Gods depart  The shining Monuments of  Vulcan  's Art  Jove  on his Couch reclin'd his awful Head  And  Juno  slumber'd on the golden Bed  OBSERVATIONS ON THE First Book  OBSERVATIONS ON THE FIRST BOOK  IT is something strange that of all the Commentators upon  Homer  there is hardly one whose principal Design is to illustrate the Poetical Beauties of the Author They are voluminous in explaining those Sciences which he made but subservient to his Poetry and sparing only upon that Art which constitutes his Character This has been occasion'd by the Ostentation of Men who had more Reading than Taste and were fonder of shewing their Variety of Learning in all Kinds than their single Understanding in Poetry Hence it comes to pass that their Remarks are rather Philosophical Historical Geographical Allegorical or in short rather any thing than Critical and Poetical Even the Grammarians tho' their whole Business and Use be only to render the Words of an Author intelligible are strangely touch'd with the Pride of doing something more than they ought The grand Ambition of one sort of Scholars is to encrease the Number of  Various Lections  which they have done to such a degree of obscure Diligence that we now begin to value the first Editions of Books as most correct because they have been least corrected The prevailing Passion of others is to discover  New Meanings  in an Author whom they will cause to appear mysterious purely for the Vanity of being thought to unravel him These account it a disgrace to be of the Opinion of those that preceded them and it is generally the Fate of  such People who will never say what was said before to say what will never be said after them If they can but find a Word that has once been strain'd by some dark Writer to signify any thing different from its usual Acceptation it is frequent with them to apply to constantly to that uncommon Meaning whenever they meet it in a clear Writer For Reading is so much dearer to them than Sense that they will discard it at any time to make way for a Criticism In other Places where they cannot contest the Truth of the common Interpretation they get themselves room for Dissertation by imaginary  Amphibologies  which they will have to be design'd by the Author This Disposition of finding out different Significations in one thing may be the Effect of either too much or too little Wit For Men of a right Understanding generally see at once all that an Author can reasonably mean but others are apt to fancy Two Meanings for want of knowing One Not to add that there is a vast deal of difference between the Learning of a Critick and the Puzzling of a Grammarian  It is no easy Task to make something out of a hundred Pedants that is not Pedantical yet this he must do who would give a tolerable Abstract of the former Expositors of  Homer  The Commentaries of  Eustathius  are indeed an immense Treasury of the  Greek  Learning but as he seems to have amassed the Substance of whatever others had written upon the Author so he is not free from some of the foregoing Censures There are those who have said that a judicious Abstract of Him alone might furnish out sufficient Illustrations upon  Homer  It was resolv'd to take the trouble of reading thro' that voluminous Work and the Reader may be assur'd those Remarks that any way concern the Poetry or Art of the Poet are much fewer than is imagin'd The greater Part of these is already plunder'd by succeeding Commentators who have very little but what they owe to him and I am oblig'd to say even of Madam  Dacier  that she is either more beholden to him than she has confessed or has read him less than she is willing to own She has made a farther Attempt than her Predecessors to discover the Beauties of the Poet tho' we have often only  her general Praises and Exclamations instead of Reasons But her Remarks all together are the most judicious Collection extant of the scatter'd Observations of the Ancients and Moderns as her Preface is excellent and her Translation equally careful and elegant  The chief Design of the following Notes is to comment upon  Homer  as a Poet whatever in them is extracted from others is constantly own'd the Remarks of the Ancients are generally set at length and the Places cited all those of  Eustathius  are collected which fall under this Scheme many which were not acknowledg'd by other Commentators are restor'd to the true Owner and the same Justice is shown to those who refus'd it to others  I  THE Plan of this Poem is form'd upon Anger and its ill Effects the Plan of  Virgil  's upon pious Resignation and its Rewards and thus every Passion or Virtue may be the Foundation of the Scheme of an Epic Poem This Distinction between two Authors who have been so successful seem'd necessary to be taken notice of that they who would imitate either may not stumble at the very Entrance or curb their Imaginations so as to deprive us of noble Morals told in a new Variety of Accidents Imitation does not hinder Invention We may observe the Rules of Nature and write in the Spirit of those who have best hit upon them without taking the same Track beginning in the same Manner and following the Main of their Story almost step by step as most of the modern Writers of Epic Poetry have done after one of these great Poets  II  VERSE  Quintilian  has told us that from the beginning of  Homer  's two Poems the Rules of all  Exordiums  were deriv'd  "  In paucissimis versibus utriusque operis ingressu legem Prooemiorum non dico servavit sed constituit  "  Yet  Rapin  has been very free with this Invocation in his  Comparison  between  Homer  and  Virgil which is by no means the most judicious of his Works He cavils first at the Poet's insisting so much upon the Effects of  Achilles  's Anger That it was  "the Cause of the Woes of the  Greeks  "  that it  "sent so many Heroes to the Shades"  that  "their Bodies were left a Prey to Birds and Beasts"  the first of which he thinks had been sufficient One may answer that the Woes of  Greece  might consist in several other things than in the Death of her Heroes which was therefore needful to be specify'd As to the Bodies he might have reflected how great a Curse the want of Burial was accounted by the Ancients and how prejudicial it was esteem'd even to the Souls of the deceas'd We have a most particular Example of the Strength of this Opinion from the Conduct of  Sophocles  in his  Ajax  who thought this very Point sufficient to make the Distress of the last Act of that Tragedy after the Death of his Heroe purely to satisfy the Audience that he obtain'd the Rites of Sepulture Next he objects it as preposterous in  Homer  to desire the Muse to tell him the whole Story and at the same time to inform her solemnly in his own Person that 'twas the  Will of Jove  which brought it about But is a Poet then to be imagin'd intirely ignorant of his Subject tho' he invokes the Muse to relate the Particulars May not  Homer  be allow'd the Knowledge of so plain a Truth as that the Will of God is fulfill'd in all things Nor does his Manner of saying this infer that he  informs  the Muse of it but only corresponds with the usual way of desiring Information from another concerning any thing and at the same time mentioning that little we know of it in general What is there more in this Passage  "Sing O Goddess that Wrath of  Achilles  which prov'd so pernicious to the  Greeks  We only know the Effects of it that it sent innumerable brave Men to the Shades and that it was  Jove  's Will it should be so But tell me O Muse what was the Source of this destructive Anger"  I can't apprehend what  Rapin  means by saying it is hard to know where this  Invocation  ends and that it is confounded with the  Narration  which so manifestly begins at  But upon the whole methinks the  French  Criticks play double with us when they sometimes  represent the Rules of Poetry to be form'd upon the Practice of  Homer  and at other times arraign their Master as if he transgress'd them  Horace  has said the  Exordium  of an Epic Poem ought to be plain and modest and instances  Homer  's as such and  Rapin  from this very Rule will be trying  Homer  and judging it otherwise for he criticises also upon the beginning of the  Odysses  But for a full Answer we may bring the Words of  Quintilian  whom  Rapin  himself allows to be the best of Criticks concerning these Propositions and Invocations of our Author  "  Benevolum Auditorem invocatione dearum quas praesidere vatibus creditum est intentum propositâ rerum magnitudine docilem summā celeriter comprehensâ facit  "  III  VERSE  Plutarch  observes there is a Defect in the Measure of this first Line I suppose he means in the  Eta  's of the Patronymick This he thinks the fiery Vein of  Homer  making haste to his Subject past over with a bold Neglect being conscious of his own Power and Perfection in the greater Parts as some says he who make Virtue their sole Aim pass by Censure in smaller Matters But perhaps we may find no occasion to suppose this a Neglect in him if we consider that the word  Pelides  had he made use of it without so many Alterations as he has put it to in  would still have been true to the Rules of Measure Make but a Diphthong of the second  Eta  and the  Iota  instead of their being two Syllables perhaps by the fault of Transcribers and the Objection is gone Or perhaps it might be design'd that the Verse in which he professes to sing of violent Anger should run off in the Rapidity of Dactyles This Art he is allow'd to have us'd in other Places and  Virgil  has been particularly celebrated for it  IV  VERSE  Will of Jove    Plutarch  in his Treatise of reading Poets interprets  in this Place to signify  Fate  not  imagining it consistent with the Goodness of the supreme Being or  Jupiter  to contrive or practise any Evil against Men  Eustathius  makes  Will  here to refer to the Promise which  Jupiter  gave to  Thetis  that he would honour her Son by siding with  Troy  while he should be absent But to reconcile these two Opinions perhaps the Meaning may be that when  Fate  had decreed the Destruction of  Troy Jupiter  having the Power of Incidents to bring it to pass fulfill'd that Decree by providing Means for it So that the Words may thus specify the Time of Action from the beginning of the Poem in which those Incidents work'd 'till the Promise to  Thetis  was fulfil'd and the Destruction of  Troy  ascertain'd to the  Greeks  by the Death of  Hector  However it is certain that this Poet was not an absolute  Fatalist  but still suppos'd the Power of  Jove  superior For in the sixteenth  Iliad  we see him designing to save  Sarpedon  tho' the Fates had decreed his Death if  Juno  had not interposed Neither does he exclude  Freewill  in Men for as he attributes the Destruction of the Heroes to the  Will  of  Jove  in the beginning of the  Iliad  so he attributes the Destruction of  Ulysses  's Friends to their  own Folly  in the beginning of the  Odysses  V  VERSE  Declare O Muse    It may be question'd whether the first Period ends at  and the Interrogation to the Muse begins with  Or whether the Period does not end 'till the words  with only a single Interrogation at  I should be inclin'd to favour the former and think it a double Interrogative as  Milton  seems to have done in his Imitation of this Place at the beginning of  Paradise Lost  Say first what Cause  Mov'd our grand Parents  c  And just after  Who first seduc'd them to that foul Revolt  Besides that I think the Proposition concludes more nobly  with the Sentence  Such was the Will of  Jove But the latter being follow'd by most Editions and by all the Translations I have seen in any Language the general Acceptation is here comply'd with only transposing the Line to keep the Sentence last And the next Verses are so turn'd as to include the double Interrogation and at the same time do justice to another Interpretation of the Words    Ex quo tempore  which marks the  Date  of the Quarrel from whence the Poem takes its Rise  Chapman  would have  Ex quo  understood of  Jupiter from whom  the Debate was suggested but this clashes with the Line immediately following where he asks What God inspir'd the Contention and answers It was  Apollo  VI  VERSE Latona  's Son    Here the Author who first invok'd the Muse as the Goddess of Memory vanishes from the Reader's view and leaves her to relate the whole Affair through the Poem whose Presence from this time diffuses an Air of Majesty over the Relation And lest this should be lost to our Thoughts by the Continuation of the Story he sometimes refreshes them with a new Invocation at proper Intervals  Eustathius  VII  VERSE  The Sceptre and the Laurel Crown    There is something exceedingly venerable in this Appearance of the Priest to command Attention He comes with the Ensigns of the God he belong'd to the Laurel Crown now carry'd in his Hand to show he was a Suppliant and a golden Sceptre which the Ancients gave in particular to  Apollo  as they did a silver one to the Moon and other sorts to other Planets  Eustathius  VIII  VERSE  Ye Kings and Warriors    The Art of this Speech is remarkable  Chryses  considers the Constitution of  the  Greeks  before  Troy  as made up of Troops partly from Kingdoms and partly from Democracies Wherefore he begins with a distinction which comprehends all After this as  Apollo  's Priest he prays that they may obtain the two Blessings they had most in view the Conquest of  Troy  and a safe Return Then as he names his Petition he offers an extraordinary Ransom and concludes with bidding them fear the God if they refuse it like one who from his Office seems to foresee their Misery and exhorts them to shun it Thus he endeavours to work by the Art of a general Application by Religion by Interest and the Insinuation of Danger This is the Substance of what  Eustathius  remarks on this Place and in pursuance to his last Observation the Epithet  Avenging  is added to this Version that it may appear the Priest foretells the Anger of his God  IX  VERSE  He with Pride repuls'd    It has been remark'd in Honour of  Homer  's Judgment and the Care he took of his Reader's Morals that where he speaks of evil Actions committed or hard Words given he generally characterises them as such by a previous Expression This Passage is given as one Instance of it where he says the Repulse of  Chryses  was a proud injurious Action in  Agamemnon  And it may be remark'd that before his Heroes fall on one another with hard Language in this Book he still takes care to let us know they were under a Distraction of Anger Plutarch  of reading Poets  X  VERSE  'Till Time shall rifle ev'ry youthful Grace  And Age dismiss her from my cold Embrace  In daily Labours of the Loom employ'd  Or doom'd to deck the Bed she once enjoy'd    The  Greek  is  which signifies either  making  the Bed or  partaking  it  Eustathius  and Madam  Dacier  insist very much upon its being taken in the former Sense only for fear  of presenting a loose Idea to the Reader and of offending against the Modesty of the  Muse  who is suppos'd to relate the Poem This Observation may very well become a Bishop and a Lady But that  Agamemnon  was not studying here for Civility of Expression appears from the whole Tenour of his Speech and that he design'd  Chryseis  for more than a ServantMaid may be seen from some other things he says of her as that he preferr'd her to his Queen  Clytemnestra c  The Impudence of which Confession Madam  Dacier  herself has elsewhere animadverted upon Mr  Dryden  in his Translation of this Book has been juster to the Royal Passion of  Agamemnon  tho' he has carry'd the Point so much on the other side as to make him promise a greater Fondness for her in her old Age than in her Youth which indeed is hardly credible  Mine she shall be 'till creeping Age and Time  Her Bloom have wither'd and destroy'd her Prime  'Till then  my nuptial Bed she shall attend  And having  first  adorn'd it  late  ascend  This for the Night by Day the Web and Loom  And homely HousholdTasks shall be her Doom  Nothing could have made Mr  Dryden  capable of this Mistake but extreme haste in Writing which never ought to be imputed as a Fault to him but to those who suffer'd so noble a Genius to lie under the necessity of it  XI  VERSE  The trembling Priest    We may take notice here once for all that  Homer  is frequently Eloquent in his very Silence  Chryses  says not a word in answer to the Insults of  Agamemnon  but walks pensive along the Shore and the melancholy Flowing of the Verse admirably expresses the Condition of the mournful and deserted Father  XII  VERSE  The fav'ring God attends    Upon this first Prayer in the Poem  Eustathius  takes occasion to observe that the Poet is careful throughout his whole Work to let no Prayer ever fall entirely which has Justice on its side but he who prays either kills his Enemy or has Signs given him that he has been heard or his Friends return or his Undertaking succeeds or some other visible Good happens So far instructive and useful to Life has  Homer  made his Fable  XIII  VERSE  He bent his deadly Bow    In the tenth Year of the Siege of  Troy  a Plague happen'd in the  Grecian  Camp occasion'd perhaps by immoderate Heats and gross Exhalations At the Introduction of this Accident  Homer  begins his Poem and takes occasion from it to open the Scene of Action with a most beautiful Allegory He supposes that such Afflictions are sent from Heaven for the Punishment of our evil Actions and because the Sun whom the Heathens worship'd was a principal Instrument of it he says it was sent to punish  Agamemnon  for despising that God and injuring his Priest  Eustathius  XIV  VERSE  Mules and Dogs    Hippocrates observes two things of Plagues that their Cause is in the Air and that different Animals are differently touch'd by them according to their Nature or Nourishment This Philosophy  Spondanus  refers to the Plague here mention'd First the Cause is in the Air by reason of the  Darts  or  Beams  of  Apollo  Secondly the Mules and Dogs are said to die sooner than the Men partly because they have by Nature a Quickness of Smell which makes the Infection sooner perceivable and partly by the Nourishment they take their feeding on the Earth with prone Heads making the Exhalation the more easy to be suck'd in with it Thus has  Hippocrates  so  long after  Homer  writ subscrib'd to his Knowledge in the Rise and Progress of this Distemper There have been some who have refer'd this Passage to a religious Sense making the Death of the Mules and Dogs before the Men to point out a kind Method of Providence in punishing whereby it sends some previous Afflictions to warn Mankind so as to make them shun the greater Evils by Repentance This Monsieur  Dacier  in his Notes on  Aristotles  's Art of Poetry calls a Remark perfectly fine and agreeable to God's Method of sending Plagues on the  Aegyptians  where first Horses Asses  c  were smitten and afterwards the Men themselves  XV  VERSE Thetis'  Godlike Son convenes a Council    On the tenth Day a Council is held to enquire why the Gods were angry We may observe with  Plutarch  how justly he applies the Characters of his Persons to the Incidents not making  Agamemnon  but  Achilles  call this Council who of all the Kings was most capable of making Observations upon the Plague and of foreseeing its Duration as having been bred by  Chiron  to the Study of Physick One may mention also a Remark of  Eustathius  in pursuance to this that  Juno  's advising him in this case might allude to his Knowledge of an evil Temperament in the  Air  of which she was Goddess  XVI  VERSE  Why leave we not the fatal  Trojan  Shore  c  The Artifice of this Speech according to  Dionysius  of  Halicarnassus  in his second Discourse  is admirably carry'd on to open an Accusation against  Agamemnon  whom  Achilles  suspects to be the Cause of all their Miseries He directs himself not to the Assembly but to  Agamemnon  he names not only the  Plague  but the  War  too as having exhausted them all which was evidently due to his Family He leads the  Augurs  he would consult by pointing at something lately done with respect to  Apollo  And while he continues within the guard of civil Expression scattering his  Insinuations he encourages those who may have more Knowledge to speak out boldly by letting them see there is a Party made for their Safety which has its Effect immediately in the following Speech of  Chalcas  whose demand of Protection shows upon whom the Offence is to be plac'd  XVII  VERSE  By mystic Dreams    It does not seem that by the word  an Interpreter of Dreams is meant for we have no hint of any preceding Dream which wants to be interpreted We may therefore more probably refer it to such who us'd after performing proper Rites to lie down at some sacred Place and expect a Dream from the Gods upon any particular Subject which they desir'd That this was a Practice amongst them appears from the Temples of  Amphiaraus  in  Boeotia  and  Podalirius  in  Apulia  where the Enquirer was oblig'd to sleep at the Altar upon the Skin of the Beast he had sacrific'd in order to obtain an Answer It is in this manner that  Latinus  in  Virgil  's seventh Book goes to dream in the Temple of  Faunus  where we have a particular Description of the whole Custom  Strabo Lib  has spoken concerning the Temple of  Jerusalem  as a Place of this Nature  "where says he the People either dream'd for themselves or procur'd some good Dreamer to do it"  By which it should seem he had read something concerning the Visions of their Prophets as that which  Samuel  had when he was order'd to sleep a third time before the Ark and upon doing so had an Account of the Destruction of  Eli  's House or that which happen'd to  Solomon  after having sacrific'd before the Ark at  Gibeon  The same Author also has mention'd the Temple of  Serapis  in his seventeenth Book as a Place for receiving Oracles by Dreams  XVIII  VERSE  Belov'd of Jove  Achilles  These Appellations of Praise and Honour with which the Heroes in  Homer  so  frequently salute each other were agreeable to the Style of the ancient Times as appears from several of the like Nature in the Scripture  Milton  has not been wanting to give his Poem this Cast of Antiquity throughout which our first Parents almost always accost each other with some Title that expresses a Respect to the Dignity of human Nature  Daughter of God and Man immortal  Eve  Adam  Earth's hallow'd Mould of God inspir'd  Offspring of Heav'n and Earth and all Earth's Lord  c  XIX  VERSE  Not even the Chief    After  Achilles  had brought in  Chalcas  by his dark Doubts concerning  Agamemnon Chalcas  who perceiv'd them and was unwilling to be the first that nam'd the King artfully demands a Protection in such a manner as confirms those Doubts and extorts from him that warm and particular Expression  "that he would protect him even against  Agamemnon  "  who as he says is  now  the greatest Man of  Greece  to hint that at the Expiration of the War he should be again reduc'd to be barely King of  Mycenae  This Place  Plutarch  takes notice of as the first in which  Achilles  shews his Contempt of Sovereign Authority  XX  VERSE  The Blameless Priest    The Epithet  or  blameless  is frequent in  Homer  but not always us'd with so much Propriety as here The Reader may observe that Care has not been wanting thro' this Translation to preserve those Epithets which are peculiar to the Author whenever they receive any Beauty from the Circumstances about them as this of  blameless  manifestly does in the present Passage It is not only apply'd to a Priest but to one who being conscious of the Truth prepares with an honest Boldness to discover it  XXI  VERSE  Augur accurst    This Expression is not meerly thrown out by chance but proves what  Chalcas  said of the King when he ask'd Protection that he harbour'd Anger in his Heart For it aims at the Prediction  Chalcas  had given at  Aulis  nine Years before for the sacrificing his Daughter  Iphigenia Spondanus  This and the two following Lines are in a manner Repetitions of the same thing thrice over It is left to the Reader to consider how far it may be allow'd or rather praised for a Beauty when we consider with  Eustathius  that it is a most natural Effect of Anger to be full of Words and insisting on that which galls us We may add that these reiterated Expressions might be suppos'd to be thrown out one after another according as  Agamemnon  is struck in the Confusion of his Passion first by the Remembrance of one Prophecy and then of another which the same Man had utter'd against him  XXII  VERSE  Not half so dear were  Clytemnestra  's Charms    Agamemnon having heard the Charge which  Chalcas  drew up against him in two Particulars that he had affronted the Priest and refus'd to restore his Daughter he offers one Answer which gives softening Colours to both that he lov'd her as well as his Queen  Clytemnestra  for her Perfections Thus he would seem to satisfy the Father by Kindness to his Daughter to excuse himself before the  Greeks  for what is past and to make a Merit of yielding her in the following Lines and sacrificing his Passion for their Safety  XXIII  VERSE  Insatiate King    Here where this Passion of Anger grows loud it seems proper to prepare the Reader and prevent his Mistake in the Character of  Achilles  which  might shock him in several Particulars following We should know that the Poet has rather study'd Nature than Perfection in the laying down his Characters He resolv'd to sing the Consequences of Anger he consider'd what Virtues and Vices would conduce most to bring his Moral out of the Fable and artfully dispos'd them in his chief Persons after the manner in which we generally find them making the Fault which most peculiarly attends any good Quality to reside with it Thus he has plac'd Pride with Magnanimity in  Agamemnon  and Craft with Prudence in  Ulysses  And thus we must take his  Achilles  not as a meer heroick dispassion'd Character but as one compounded of Courage and Anger one who finds himself almost invincible and assumes an uncontroul'd Carriage upon the Selfconsciousness of his Worth whose high Strain of Honour will not suffer him to betray his Friends or fight against them even when he thinks they have affronted him but whose inexorable Resentment will not let him hearken to any Terms of Accommodation These are the Lights and Shades of his Character which  Homer  has heighten'd and darkned in Extreams because on the one side Valour is the darling Quality of Epic Poetry and on the other Anger the particular Subject of his Poem When Characters thus mix'd are well conducted tho' they be not morally beautiful quite through they conduce more to the end and are still poetically perfect  Plutarch  takes occasion from the Observation of this Conduct in  Homer  to applaud his just Imitation of Nature and Truth in representing Virtues and Vices intermixed in his Heroes contrary to the Paradoxes and strange Positions of the Stoicks who held that no Vice could consist with Virtue nor the least Virtue with Vice Plut  de aud Poetis  XXIV  VERSE  Great as thou art and like a God in Fight    The Words in the Original are    Ulysses  is soon after call'd  and others in other Places The Phrase of  Divine  or  Godlike  is not used by the Poet to signify Perfection in Men but apply'd to considerable Persons upon account  of some particular Qualification or Advantage which they were possess'd of far above the common Standard of Mankind Thus it is ascrib'd to  Achilles  upon account of his great Valour to  Ulysses  for his Preheminence in Wisdom even to  Paris  for his exceeding Beauty and to  Clytemnestra  for several fair Endowments  XXV  VERSE  First let the just Equivalent    The Reasoning in point of Right between  Achilles  and  Agamemnon  seems to be this  Achilles  pleads that  Agamemnon  could not seize upon any other Man's Captive without a new Distribution it being an Invasion of private Property On the other hand as  Agamemnon  's Power was limited how came it that all the  Grecian  Captains would submit to an illegal and arbitrary Action I think the legal Pretence for his seizing  Briseis  must have been founded upon that Law whereby the Commander in Chief had the Power of taking what part of the Prey he pleas'd for his own Use And he being obliged to restore what he had taken it seem'd but just that he should have a second Choice  XXVI  VERSE  And dar'st thou threat to snatch my Prize away  Due to the Deeds of many a dreadful Day    The Anger of these two Princes was equally upon the account of Women but yet it is observable that there is a different Air with which they are conducted  Agamemnon  appears as a Lover  Achilles  as a Warriour The one speaks of  Chryseis  as a Beauty whom he valu'd equal to his Wife and whose Merit was too considerable to be easily resign'd the other treats  Briseis  as a Slave whom he is concern'd to preserve in point of Honour and as a Testimony of his Glory Hence it is that we never hear him mention her but as his  Spoil  the  Reward of War  the  Gift the  Graecians  gave him  or the like Expressions and accordingly he yields her up not in Grief for a Mistress whom he loses but in  Sullenness for an Injury that is done him This Observation is Madam  Dacier  's and will often appear just as we proceed farther Nothing is finer than the Moral exhibited to us in this Quarrel of the Blindness and Partiality of Mankind to their own Faults The  Graecians  make a War to recover a Woman that was ravish'd and are in danger to fail in the Attempt by a Dispute about another  Agamemnon  while he is revenging a Rape commits one and  Achilles  while he is in the utmost Fury himself reproaches  Agamemnon  for his passionate Temper  XXVII  VERSE  Fly mighty Warriour    Achilles having threaten'd to leave them in the former Speech and spoken of his Acts of War the Poet here puts an artful Piece of Spite in the Mouth of  Agamemnon  making him opprobriously brand his Retreat as a Flight and lessen the Appearance of his Courage by calling it the Love of Contention and Slaughter  XXVIII  VERSE  Kings the Gods distinguish'd Care    In the Original it is  or  nurst by Jove Homer  often uses to call his Kings by such Epithets as    born of the Gods  or    bred by the Gods  by which he points out to themselves the Offices they were ordain'd for and to their People the Reverence that should be pay'd them These Expressions of his are perfectly in the exalted Style of the Eastern Nations and correspondent to those Places of holy Scripture where they are call'd  Gods  and  the Sons of the most High  XXIX  VERSE Minerva  swift descended from above    Homer having by degrees rais'd  Achilles  to such a Pitch of Fury as to make him capable of attempting  Agamemnon  's Life in the Council  Pallas  the Goddess of Wisdom descends and being seen only by him pulls him back in the very Instant of Execution He parlies with her a while as imagining she  would advise him to proceed but upon the promise of a time wherein there should be a full Reparation of his Honour he sheaths his Sword in Obedience to her She ascends to Heaven and he being left to himself falls again upon his General with bitter Expressions The Allegory here may be allow'd by every Reader to be unforc'd The Prudence of  Achilles  checks him in the rashest Moment of his Anger it works upon him unseen to others but does not entirely prevail upon him to desist 'till he remembers his own Importance and depends upon it that there will be a necessity of their courting him at any Expence into the Alliance again Having persuaded himself by such Reflections he forbears to attack his General but thinking that he sacrifices enough to Prudence by this Forbearance lets the thought of it vanish from him and no sooner is Wisdom gone but he falls into more violent Reproaches for the Gratification of his Passion All this is a most beautiful Passage whose Moral is evident and generally agreed upon by the Commentators  XXX  VERSE  Known by the Flames that sparkled from her Eyes    They who carry on this Allegory after the most minute manner refer this to the Eyes of  Achilles  as indeed we must if we entirely destroy the bodily Appearance of  Minerva  But what Poet designing to have his Moral so open would take pains to form it into a Fable In the proper mythological Sense this Passage should be referr'd to  Minerva  according to an Opinion of the Ancients who suppos'd that the Gods had a peculiar Light in their Eyes That  Homer  was not ignorant of this Opinion appears from his use of it in other Places as when in the third  Iliad Helena  by this means discovers  Venus  and that he meant it here is particularly asserted by  Heliodorus  in the third Book of his  Aethiopick  History  "The Gods says he are known in their Apparitions to Men by the fix'd Glare of their Eyes or their gliding Passage through Air without moving the Feet these Marks  Homer  has us'd from his Knowledge of the  Aegyptian  Learning applying one to  Pallas  and  the other to  Neptune  "  Madam  Dacier  has gone into the contrary Opinion and blames  Eustathius  and others without overthrowing these Authorities or assigning any other Reason but that it was not proper for  Minerva  's Eyes to  sparkle  when her Speech was  mild  XXXI  VERSE  Thou Dog in Forehead    It has been one of the Objections against the Manners of  Homer  's Heroes that they are abusive Mons  de la Motte  affirms in his Discourse upon the  Iliad  that great Men differ from the vulgar in their manner of expressing their Passion but certainly in violent Passions such as those of  Achilles  and  Agamemnon  the Great are as subject as any others to these Sallies of which we have frequent Examples both from History and Experience  Plutarch  taking notice of this Line gives it as a particular Commendation of  Homer  that  "he constantly affords us a fine Lecture of Morality in his Reprehensions and Praises by referring them not to the Goods of Fortune or the Body but those of the Mind which are in our Power and for which we are blameable or praiseworthy Thus says he  Agamemnon  is reproach'd for Impudence and Fear  Ajax  for vainbragging  Idomeneus  for the Love of Contention and  Ulysses  does not reprove even  Thersites  but as a Babbler tho' he had so many personal Deformities to object to him In like manner also the Appellations and Epithets with which they accost one another are generally founded on some distinguishing Qualification of  Merit  as  Wise  Ulysses Hector  equal to  Jove  in Wisdom  Achilles  chief Glory of the  Greeks"  and the like Plutarch  of reading Poets  XXXII  VERSE  In ambush'd Fights to dare    Homer has magnify'd the Ambush as the boldest manner of Fight They went upon those Parties with a few Men only and generally the most daring of the Army on Occasions of the greatest  Hazard where they were therefore more expos'd than in a regular Battel Thus  Idomeneus  in the thirteenth Book expressly tells  Meriones  that the greatest Courage appears in this way of Service each Man being in a manner singled out to the Proof of it  Eustathius  XXXIII  VERSE  Now by this sacred Sceptre    Spondanus in this Place blames  Eustathius  for saying that  Homer  makes  Achilles  in his Passion swear by the first thing he meets with and then assigns as from himself two Causes which the other had mention'd so plainly before that it is a wonder they could be overlook'd The Substance of the whole Passage in  Eustathius  is that if we consider the Sceptre simply as Wood  Achilles  after the manner of the Ancients takes in his Transport the first thing to swear by but that  Homer  himself has in the Process of the Description assign'd Reasons why it is proper for the Occasion which may be seen by considering it Symbolically First That as the Wood being cut from the Tree will never reunite and flourish so neither should their Amity ever flourish again after they were divided by this Contention Secondly That a Sceptre being the mark of Power and Symbol of Justice to swear by it might in effect be construed swearing by the God of Power and by Justice itself and accordingly it is spoken of by  Aristotle    l Polit  as a usual solemn Oath of Kings  I cannot leave this Passage without showing in Opposition to some Moderns who have criticiz'd upon it as tedious that it has been esteem'd a Beauty of so fine a Nature by the Ancients as to engage them in its Imitation  Virgil  has almost transcrib'd it in his  Aen  for the Sceptre of  Latinus  Ut sceptrum hoc sceptrum dextrâ nam fortè gerebat  Nunquam fronde levi sundet virgulta nec umbras  Cùm semel in silvis imo de stirpe recisum  Matre caret posuitque comas brachia ferro  Olim arbos nunc artificis manus aere decoro  Inclusit Patribusque dedit gestare Latinis  But I cannot think this comes up to the Spirit or Propriety of  Homer  notwithstanding the Judgment of  Scaliger  who decides for  Virgil  upon a trivial comparison of the Wording in each  l    cap    Poet  It fails in a greater Point than any he has mention'd which is that being there us'd on occasion of a Peace it has no emblematical reference to Division and yet describes the cutting of the Wood and its Incapacity to bloom and branch again in as many Words as  Homer  It is borrow'd by  Valerius Flaccus  in his third Book where he makes  Jason  swear as a Warriour by his Spear  Hanc ego magnanimi spolium Didymaonis hastam  Ut semel est avulsa jugis à matre perempta  Quae neque jam frondes virides neque proferet umbras  Fida ministeria duras obit horrida pugnas  Testor  And indeed however he may here borrow some Expressions from  Virgil  or fall below him in others he has nevertheless kept to  Homer  in the Emblem by introducing the Oath upon  Jason  's Grief for sailing to  Colchis  without  Hercules  when he had separated himself from the Body of the  Argonauts  to search after  Hylas  To render the Beauty of this Passage more manifest the Allusion is inserted but with the fewest Words possible in this Translation  XXXIV  VERSE  Thy Rashness made the bravest  Greek  thy Foe    Tho' selfpraise had not been agreeable to the haughty Nature of  Achilles  yet  Plutarch  has mention'd a Case and with respect to him wherein it is allowable He says that  Achilles  has at other times ascrib'd his Success to  Jupiter  but it is permitted to a Man of Merit and Figure who is injuriously dealt with to speak frankly of himself to those who are forgetful and unthankful  XXXV  VERSE  Two Generations    The Commentators make not  Nestor  to have liv'd three hundred Years according to  Ovid  's Opinion they take the word  not to signify a Century or Age of the World but a Generation or compass of Time in which one Set of Men flourish which in the common Computation is thirty Years and accordingly it is here translated as much the more probable  From what  Nestor  says in this Speech Madam  Dacier  computes the Age he was of at the end of the  Trojan  War The Fight of the  Lapithae  and  Centaurs  fell out fifty five or sixty Years before the War of  Troy  The Quarrel of  Agamemnon  and  Achilles  happen'd in the tenth and last Year of that War It was then fifty five or sixty five Years since  Nestor  fought against the  Centaurs  he was capable at that time of giving Counsel so that one cannot imagine him to have been under twenty From whence it will appear that he was now almost arriv'd to the Conclusion of his third Age and about fourscore and five or fourscore and six Years of Age  XXXVI  VERSE  What Shame    The Quarrel having risen to its highest Extravagance  Nestor  the wisest and most aged  Greek  is raised to quiet the Princes whose Speech is therefore fram'd entirely with an opposite Air to all which has been hitherto said sedate and inoffensive He begins with a soft affectionate Complaint which he opposes to their Threats and haughty Language he reconciles their Attention in an awful manner by putting them in mind that they hear one whom their Fathers and the greatest Heroes have heard with deference He sides with neither that he might not anger any one while he advises them to the proper Methods of Reconciliation and he appears to side with both while he praises each that they may be induc'd by the Recollection of one another's Worth to return to that Amity which would bring Success to the Cause It was not however consistent  with the Plan of the Poem that this should entirely appease them for then the Anger would be at an end which was propos'd to be sung through the whole  Homer  has not therefore made this Speech to have its full Success and yet that the Eloquence of his  Nestor  might not be thrown out of Character by its proving unavailable he takes care that the Violence with which the Dispute was manag'd should abate immediately upon his speaking  Agamemnon  confesses that all he spoke was right  Achilles  promises not to fight for  Briseis  if she should be sent for and the Council dissolves  It is to be observ'd that this Character of Authority and Wisdom in  Nestor  is every where admirably used by  Homer  and made to exert itself thro' all the great Emergencies of the Poem As he quiets the Princes here he proposes that Expedient which reduces the Army into their Order after the Sedition in the second Book When the  Greeks  are in the utmost Distresses 'tis he who advises the building the Fortification before the Fleet which is the chief means of preserving them And it is by his Persuasion that  Patroclus  puts on the Armour of  Achilles  which occasions the Return of that Heroe and the Conquest of  Troy  XXXVII  VERSE  No more  Achilles  draws  His conqu'ring Sword in any Woman's Cause    When  Achilles  promises not to contest for  Briseis  he expresses it in a sharp despising Air  I will not fight for the sake of a Woman  by which he glances at  Helena  and casts an oblique Reflection upon those Commanders whom he is about to leave at the Siege for her Cause One may observe how well it is fancy'd of the Poet to make one Woman the ground of a Quarrel which breaks an Alliance that was only form'd upon account of another and how much the Circumstance thus consider'd contributes to keep up the Anger of  Achilles  for carrying on the Poem beyond this Dissolution of the Council For as he himself argues with  Ulysses  in the  th Iliad  it is as reasonable for him to retain his Anger upon the account of  Briseis  as for the Brothers with all  Greece  to carry on a  War upon the score of  Helena  I do not know that any Commentator has taken notice of this Sarcasm of  Achilles  which I think a very obvious one  XXXVIII  VERSE  The Ablutions    All our former  English  Translations seem to have err'd in the Sense of this Line the word  being differently render'd by them  Offals  or  Entrails  or  Purgaments  or  Ordures  a gross Set of Ideas of which  Homer  is not guilty The word comes from    eluo  the same Verb from whence  which precedes in the Line is deriv'd So that the Sense appears to be as it is render'd here  They  wash'd  and threw away their  Washings Perhaps this Lustration might be used as a Physical Remedy in cleansing them from the Infection of the Plague as  Pausanias  tells us it was by the  Arcadians  from whence he says the Plague was called  by the  Greeks  XXXIX  VERSEE  At awful distance silent    There was requir'd a very remarkable Management to preserve all the Characters which are concern'd in this nice Conjuncture wherein the Heralds were to obey at their Peril  Agamemnon  was to be gratify'd by an Insult on  Achilles  and  Achilles  was to suffer so as might become his Pride and not have his violent Temper provok'd From all this the Poet has found the Secret to extricate himself by only taking care to make his Heralds stand in sight and silent Thus they neither make  Agamemnon  's Majesty suffer by uttering their Message submissively nor occasion a rough Treatment from  Achilles  by demanding  Briseis  in the peremptory Air he order'd and at the same time  Achilles  is gratify'd with the Opportunity of giving her up as if he rather sent her than was forc'd to relinquish her The Art of this has been taken notice of by  Eustathius  XL  VERSE  She in soft Sorrows    The Behaviour of  Briseis  in her Departure is no less beautifully imagin'd than the former A  French  or  Italian  Poet had lavish'd all his Wit and Passion in two long Speeches on this Occasion which the  Heralds  must have wept to hear instead of which  Homer  gives us a fine Picture of Nature We see  Briseis  passing unwillingly along with a dejected Air melted in Tenderness and not able to utter a word And in the Lines immediately following we have a  Contraste  to this in the gloomy Resentment of  Achilles  who suddenly retires to the Shore and vents his Rage aloud to the Seas The Variation of the Numbers just in this Place adds a great Beauty to it which has been endeavour'd at in the Translation  XLI  VERSE  There bath'd in Tears    Eustathius observes on this Place that it is no Weakness in Heroes to weep but the very Effect of Humanity and Proof of a generous Temper for which he offers several Instances and takes notice that if  Sophocles  would not let  Ajax  weep it is because he is drawn rather as a Madman than a Heroe But this general Observation is not all we can offer in excuse for the Tears of  Achilles  His are Tears of Anger and Disdain as I have ventur'd to call them in the Translation of which a great and fiery Temper is more susceptible than any other and even in this case  Homer  has taken care to preserve the high Character by making him retire to vent his Tears out of sight And we may add to these an Observation of which Madam  Dacier  is fond which is the Reason why  Agamemnon  parts not in Tears from  Chryseis  and  Achilles  should from  Briseis  The one parts willingly from his Mistress and because he does it for his People's Safety it becomes an Honour to him the other is parted unwillingly and because his General takes her by force the Action reflects a Dishonour upon him  XLII  VERSE  The Thund'rer ow'd    This alludes to a Story which  Achilles  tells the Embassadors of  Agamemnon Il  That he had the Choice of two Fates one less glorious at home but blessed with a very long Life the other full of Glory at  Troy  but then he was never to return The Alternative being thus propos'd to him not from  Jupitcr  but  Thetis  who reveal'd the Decree he chose the latter which he looks upon as his due since he gives away length of Life for it and accordingly when he complains to his Mother of the Disgrace he lies under it is in this manner he makes a demand of Honour  Mons  de la Motte  very judiciously observes that but for this Foreknowledge of the Certainty of his Death at  Troy Achilles  's Character could have drawn but little Esteem from the Reader A Heroe of a vicious Mind blest only with a Superiority of Strength and invulnerable into the bargain was not very proper to excite Admiration but  Homer  by this exquisite Piece of Art has made him the greatest of Heroes who is still pursuing Glory in contempt of Death and even under that Certainty generously devoting himself in every Action  XLIII  VERSE  From  Thebae  Homer  who open'd his Poem with the Action which immediately brought on  Achilles  's Anger being now to give an Account of the same thing again takes his Rise more backward in the Story Thus the Reader is inform'd in what he should know without having been delay'd from entering upon the promis'd Subject This is the first Attempt which we see made towards the Poetical Method of Narration which differs from the Historical in that it does not proceed always directly in the Line of Time but sometimes relates things which have gone before when a more proper Opportunity demands it to make the Narration more informing or beautiful  The foregoing Remark is in regard only to the first six Lines of this Speech What follows is a Rehearsal of the preceding Action of the Poem almost in the same Words he had used in the opening it and is one of those Faults which has with most Justice been objected to our Author It is not to be deny'd but the Account must be tedious of what the Reader had been just before inform'd and especially when we are given to understand it was no way necessary by what  Achilles  says at the beginning that  Thetis knew the whole Story already  As to repeating the same Lines a Practice usual with  Homer  it is not so excusable in this Place as in those where Messages are deliver'd in the Words they were receiv'd or the like it being unnatural to imagine that the Person whom the Poet introduces as actually speaking should fall into the selfsame Words that are us'd in the Narration by the Poet himself Yet  Milton  was so great an Admirer and Imitator of our Author as not to have scrupled even this kind of Repetition The Passage is at the end of his tenth Book where  Adam  having declar'd he would prostrate himself before God in certain particular Acts of Humiliation those Acts are immediately after describ'd by the Poet in the same Words  XLIV  VERSE  Oft hast thou triumph'd    The Persuasive which  Achilles  is here made to put into the Mouth of  Thetis  is most artfully contriv'd to suit the present Exigency You says he must intreat  Jupiter  to bring Miseries on the  Greeks  who are protected by  Juno Neptune  and  Minerva  Put him therefore in mind that those Deities were once his Enemies and adjure him by that Service you did him when those very Powers would have bound him that he will now in his turn assist you against the Endeavours they will certainly oppose to my Wishes  Eustathius  As for the Story itself some have thought with whom is Madam  Dacier  that there was some imperfect Tradition of the Fall of the Angels for their Rebellion which the  Greeks  had receiv'd by Commerce with  Aegypt  and thus they account  the Rebellion of the Gods the Precipitation of  Vulcan  from Heaven and  Jove  's threatning the inferior Gods with  Tartarus  in  Il  but as so many Hints of Scripture faintly imitated But it seems not improbable that the Wars of the Gods described by the Poets allude to the Confusion of the Elements before they were brought into their natural Order It is almost generally agreed that by  Jupiter  is meant the  Aether  and by  Juno  the  Air  The ancient Philosophers suppos'd the  Aether  to be igneous and by its kind Influence upon the  Air  to be the Cause of all Vegetation Therefore  Homer  says in the  th Iliad  ℣ That upon  Jupiter  's embracing his Wife the Earth put forth its Plants Perhaps by  Thetis  's assisting  Jupiter  may be meant that the watry Element subsiding and taking its natural Place put an end to this Combat of the Elements  XLV  VERSE  Whom Gods  Briareus  Men  Aegeon  name    This manner of making the Gods speak a Language different from Men which is frequent in  Homer  is a Circumstance that as far as it widens the distinction between divine and human Natures so far might tend to heighten the Reverence paid the Gods But besides this as the difference is thus told in Poetry it is of use to the Poets themselves For it appears like a kind of Testimony of their Inspiration or their Converse with the Gods and thereby gives a Majesty to their Works  XLVI  VERSE  The Sire of Gods and all th' Etherial Train  On the warm Limits of the farthest Main  Now mix with Mortals nor disdain to grace  The Feasts of  Aethiopia  's blameless Race    The  Aethiopians  says  Diodorus l  are said to be the Inventors of Pomps Sacrifices solemn Meetings and other Honours paid to the Gods From hence arose their Character of Piety which is here celebrated by  Homer  Among these there was an annual Feast at  Diospolis  which  Eustathius  mentions wherein they carry'd about the Statues of  Jupiter  and the other Gods for twelve Days according to their Number to which if we add the ancient Custom of setting Meat before Statues it will appear a Rite from which this Fable might easily arise But it would be a great Mistake to imagine from this Place that  Homer  represents the Gods as eating and drinking upon Earth a gross Notion he was never guilty of as appears from these Verses in the fifth Book Line  Macrobius  would have it that by  Jupiter  here mention'd is meant the  Sun  and that the Number Twelve hints at the twelve Signs but whatever may be said in a critical Defence of this Opinion I believe the Reader will be satisfy'd that  Homer  consider'd as a Poet would have his Machinery understood upon that System of the Gods which is properly  Graecian  One may take notice here that it were to be wish'd some Passage were found in any authentic Author that might tell us the time of the Year when the  Aethiopians  kept this Festival at  Diospolis  For from thence one might determine the precise Season of the Year wherein the Actions of the  Iliad  are represented to have happen'd and perhaps by that means farther explain the Beauty and Propriety of many Passages in the Poem  XLVII  VERSE  The Sacrifice    If we consider this Passage it is not made to shine in Poetry All that can be done is to give it Numbers and endeavour to set the Particulars in a distinct View But if we take it in another Light and as a Piece of Learning it is valuable for being the most exact Account of the ancient Sacrifices any where left us There is first the Purification by washing of Hands Secondly the offering up of Prayers Thirdly the  Mola  or Barley Cakes thrown upon the Victim Fourthly the manner of killing it  with the Head turn'd upwards to the celestial Gods as they turn'd it downwards when they offer'd to the Infernals Fifthly their selecting the Thighs and Fat for their Gods as the best of the Sacrifice and the disposing about them pieces cut from every part for a Representation of the whole Hence the Thighs or  are frequently us'd in  Homer  and the  Greek  Poets for the whole Victim Sixthly the Libation of Wine Seventhly consuming the Thighs in the Fire of the Altar Eighthly the Sacrificers dressing and Feasting on the rest with Joy and Hymns to the Gods Thus punctually have the ancient Poets and in particular  Homer  written with a care and respect to Religion One may question whether any Country as much a Stranger to Christianity as we are to Heathenism might be so well inform'd by our Poets in the Worship belonging to any Profession of Religion at present  I am obliged to take notice how intirely Mr  Dryden  has mistaken the Sense of this Passage and the Custom of Antiquity for in his Translation the Cakes are thrown into the Fire instead of being cast on the Victim the Sacrificers are made to eat the Thighs and whatever belong'd to the Gods and no part of the Victim is consum'd for a Burntoffering so that in effect there is no Sacrifice at all Some of the Mistakes particularly that of  turning the Roastmeat on the Spits  which was not known in  Homer  's Days he was led into by  Chapman  's Translation  XLVIII  VERSE  The faithful fix'd irrevocable Sign    There are among Men three things by which the Efficacy of a Promise may be made void the Design not to perform it the want of Power to bring it to pass and the Instability of our Tempers from all which  Homer  saw that the Divinity must be exempted and therefore he describes the  Nod  or Ratification of  Jupiter  's word as  faithful  in Opposition to  Fraud sure  of being perform'd in Opposition to  Weakness  and  irrevocable  in Opposition to our  repenting  of a Promise  Eustathius  XLIX  VERSE  He spoke and awful bends    This Description of the Majesty of  Jupiter  has something exceedingly grand and venerable  Macrobius  reports that  Phidias  having made his  Olympian Jupiter  which past for one of the greatest Miracles of Art he was ask'd from what Pattern he fram'd so divine a Figure and answer'd it was from that Archetype which he found in these Lines of  Homer  The same Author has also taken notice of  Virgil  's imitating it  l    Dixerat idque ratum Stygii per flumina fratris  Per pice torrentes atraque voragine ripas  Annuit totum nutu tremefecit Olympum  Here indeed he has preserv'd the  Nod  with its stupendous Effect the making the Heavens tremble But he has neglected the Description of the Eyebrows and the Hair those chief Pieces of Imagery from whence the Artist took the Idea of a Countenance proper for the King of Gods and Men  Thus far  Macrobius  whom  Scaliger  answers in this manner  Aut ludunt Phidiam aut nos ludit Phidias Etiam sine  Homero  puto illum scisse Jovem non carere superciliis caesarie  L  VERSE Jove  assumes the Throne    As  Homer  makes the first Council of his Men to be one continued Scene of Anger whereby the  Graecian  Chiefs became divided so he makes the first Meeting of the Gods to be spent in the same Passion whereby  Jupiter  is more fix'd to assist the  Trojans  and  Juno  more incens'd against them Thus the Design of the Poem goes on the Anger which began the Book overspreads all existent Beings by the latter end of it Heaven and Earth become engag'd in the Subject by which it rises to a great Importance in the Reader's Eyes and is hasten'd forward into the briskest Scenes of Action that can be fram'd upon that violent Passion  LI  VERSE  Say artful Manager    The Gods and Goddesses being describ'd with all the Desires and Pleasures the Passions and Humours of Mankind the Commentators have taken a Licence from thence to draw not only moral Observations but also satyrical Reflections out of this part of the Poet These I am sorry to see fall so hard upon Womankind and all by  Juno  's means Sometimes she procures them a Lesson for their Curiosity and Unquietness and at other times for their loud and vexatious Tempers  Juno  deserves them on the one hand  Jupiter  thunders them out on the other and the learned Gentlemen are very particular in enlarging with Remarks on both sides In her first Speech they make the Poet describe the inquisitive Temper of Womankind in general and their Restlesness if they are not admitted into every Secret In his Answer to this they trace those Methods of grave Remonstrance by which it is proper for Husbands to calm them In her Reply they find it is the Nature of Women to be more obstinate for being yielded to and in his second Return to her they see the last Method to be used with them upon failure of the first which is the Exercise of Sovereign Authority  Mr  Dryden  has translated all this with the utmost Severity upon the Ladies and spirited the whole with satyrical Additions of his own But Madam  Dacier  who has elsewhere animadverted upon the good Bishop of  Thessalonica  for his sage Admonitions against the Fair Sex has not taken the least notice of this general Defection from Complaisance in all the Commentators She seems willing to give the whole Passage a more important Turn and incline us to think that  Homer  design'd to represent the Folly and Danger of prying into the Secrets of Providence 'Tis thrown into that Air in this Translation not only as it is more noble and instructive in general but as it is more respectful to the Ladies in particular nor should we any more than Madam  Dacier  have mention'd what those old Fellows have said but to desire their Protection against some modern Criticks their Disciples who may arraign this Proceeding  LII  VERSE  Roll'd the large Orbs    The  Greek  is  which is commonly translated  The venerable Oxey'd  Juno Madam  Dacier  very well observes that  is only an augmentative Particle and signifies no more than  valdè  It may be added that the Imagination of Oxen having larger Eyes than ordinary is ill grounded and has no Foundation in Truth their Eyes are no larger in proportion than those of Men or of most other Animals But be it as it will the design of the Poet which is only to express the Largeness of her Eyes is answer'd in this Paraphrase  LIII  VERSE  Thus interpos'd the Architect divine    This Quarrel of the Gods being come to its height the Poet makes  Vulcan  interpose who freely puts them in mind of Pleasure inoffensively advises  Juno  illustrates his Advice by an Example of his own Misfortune turning the Jest on himself to enliven the Banquet and concludes the Part he is to support with serving  Nectar  about  Homer  had here his  Minerva  or  Wisdom  to interpose again and every other Quality of the Mind resided in Heaven under the Appearance of some Deity So that his introducing  Vulcan  proceeded not from a want of Choice but an Insight into Nature He knew that a Friend to Mirth often diverts or stops Quarrels especially when he contrives to submit himself to the Laugh and prevails on the angry to part in good Humour or in a Disposition to Friendship when grave Representations are sometimes Reproaches sometimes lengthen the Debate by occasioning Defences and sometimes introduce new Parties into the Consequences of it  LIV  VERSE  Once in your Cause I felt his matchless Might    They who search another Vein of Allegory for hidden Knowledges in Natural Philosophy have consider'd  Jupiter  and  Juno  as  Heaven  and the  Air  whose Alliance is interrupted when the Air is troubled above but restor'd again when it is clear'd by  Heat  or  Vulcan  the God of Heat Him they call a divine Artificer from the Activity or general Use of Fire in working They suppose him to be born in Heaven where Philosophers say that Element has its proper Place and is thence deriv'd to the Earth which is signify'd by the Fall of  Vulcan  that he fell in  Lemnos  because that Island abounds with Subterranean Fires and that he contracted a Lameness or Imperfection by the Fall the Fire not being so pure and active below but mix'd and terrestrial  Eustathius  LVI  VERSE  Which with a Smile the whitearm'd Queen receiv'd    The Epithet  or  whitearm'd  is used by  Homer  several times before in this Book This was the first Passage where it could be introduced with any Ease or Grace because the Action she is here describ'd in of extending her Arm to the Cup gives it an occasion of displaying its Beauties and in a manner demands the Epithet  LVII  VERSE  Laughter shakes the Skies    Vulcan design'd to move Laughter by taking upon him the Office of  Hebe  and  Ganymede  with his aukward limping Carriage But tho' he prevail'd and  Homer  tells you the Gods did laugh yet he takes care not to mention a word of Lameness It would have been cruel in him and Wit out of Season to have enlarg'd with Derision upon an Imperfection which is out of one's Power to remedy  According to this goodnatur'd Opinion of  Eustathius  Mr  Dryden  has treated  Vulcan  a little barbarously He makes his Character perfectly comical he is the Jest of the Board and the Gods are very merry upon the Imperfections of his Figure  Chapman  led him into this Error in general as well as into some Indecencies of Expression in particular which will be seen upon comparing them  LVIII  VERSE  Then to their starry Domes    The Astrologers assign twelve Houses to the Planets wherein they are said to have Dominion Now because  Homer  tells us  Vulcan  built a Mansion for every God the Ancients write that he first gave occasion for this Doctrine  LIX  VERSE Jove  on his Couch reclin'd his awful Head    Eustathius makes a distinction between  and  the Words which are used at the end of this Book and the beginning of the next with regard to  Jupiter  's sleeping He says  only means Lying down in a Disposition to sleep which salves the Contradiction that else would follow in the next Book where it is said  Jupiter  did not sleep I only mention this to vindicate the Translation which differs from Mr  Dryden  's  It has been remark'd by the Scholiasts that this is the only Book of the twenty four without any  Simile  a Figure in which  Homer  abounds every where else The like Remark is made by Madam  Dacier  upon the first of the  Odysses  and because the Poet has observ'd the same Conduct in both Works it is concluded he thought a Simplicily of Style without the great Figures was proper during the first Information of the Reader This Observation may be true and admits of refin'd Reasonings but for my part I cannot think the Book had been the worse tho' he had thrown in as many  Similes  as  Virgil  has in the first  Aeneid  THE SECOND BOOK OF THE ILIAD  The ARGUMENT  The Tryal of the Army and Catalogue of the Forces  JUPITER in pursuance of the Request of  Thetis  sends a deceitful Vision to  Agamemnon  persuading him to lead the Army to Battel in order to make the  Greeks  sensible of their want of  Achilles  The General who is deluded with the hopes of taking  Troy  without his Assistance but fears the Army was discourag'd by his Absence and the late Plague as well as by length of Time contrives to make trial of their Disposition by a Stratagem He first communicates his Design to the Princes in Council that he would propose a Return to the Soldiers and that they should put a stop to them if the Proposal was embrac'd Then he assembles the whole Host and upon moving for a Return to  Greece  they unanimously agree to it and run to prepare the Ships They are detain'd by the Management of  Ulysses  who chastises the Insolence of  Thersites  The Assembly is recall'd several Speeches made on the occasion and at length the Advice of  Nestor  follow'd which was to make a general Muster of the Troops and to divide them into their several Nations before they proceeded to Battel This gives occasion to the Poet to ennumerate all the Forces of the  Greeks  and  Trojans  in a large Catalogue  The  Time  employ'd in this Book consists not intirely of one Day The  Scene  lies in the  Graecian Camp  and upon the  SeaShore  toward the end it removes to  Troy  THE SECOND BOOK OF THE ILIAD  NOW pleasing  Sleep  had seal'd each mortal Eye  Stretch'd in the Tents the  Grecian  Leaders lie  Th' Immortals slumber'd on their Thrones above  All but the everwakeful Eyes of  Jove  To honour  Thetis'  Son he bends his Care  And plunge the  Greeks  in all the Woes of War  Then bids an empty Phantome rise to sight  And thus commands the  Vision  of the Night  Fly hence deluding  Dream  and light as Air  To  Agamemnon  's ample Tent repair  Bid him in Arms draw forth th' embattel'd Train  Lead all his  Grecians  to the dusty Plain  Declare ev'n now 'tis giv'n him to destroy  The lofty Tow'rs of wideextended  Troy  For now no more the Gods with Fate contend  At  Juno  's Suit the Heav'nly Factions end  Destruction hangs o'er yon' devoted Wall  And nodding  Ilion  waits th' impending Fall  Swift as the Word the vain  Illusion  fled  Descends and hovers o'er  Atrides'  Head  Cloath'd in the Figure of the  Pylian  Sage  Renown'd for Wisdom and rever'd for Age  Around his Temples spreads his golden Wing  And thus the flatt'ring  Dream  deceives the King  Canst thou with all a Monarch's Cares opprest  Oh  Atreus'  Son canst thou indulge thy Rest  Ill fits a Chief who mighty Nations guides  Directs in Council and in War presides  To whom its Safety a whole People owes  To waste long Nights in indolent Repose  Monarch awake 'tis  Jove  's Command I bear  Thou and thy Glory claim his heav'nly Care  In just Array draw forth th' embattel'd Train  Lead all thy  Grecians  to the dusty Plain  Ev'n now O King 'tis giv'n thee to destroy  The lofty Tow'rs of wideextended  Troy  For now no more the Gods with Fate contend  At  Juno  's Suit the Heav'nly Factions end  Destruction hangs o'er yon' devoted Wall  And nodding  Ilion  waits th' impending Fall  Awake but waking this Advice approve  And trust the  Vision  that descends from  Jove  The  Phantome  said then vanish'd from his sight  Resolves to Air and mixes with the Night  A thousand Schemes the Monarch's Mind employ  Elate in Thought he sacks untaken  Troy  Vain as he was and to the Future blind  Nor saw what  Jove  and secret Fate design'd  What mighty Toils to either Host remain  What Scenes of Grief and Mountains of the Slain  Eager he rises and in Fancy hears  The Voice Celestial murm'ring in his Ears  First on his Limbs a slender Vest he drew  Around him next the Regal Mantle threw  Th' embroider'd Sandals on his Feet were ty'd  The starry Faulchion glitter'd at his side  And last his Arm the massy Sceptre loads  Unstain'd immortal and the Gift of Gods  Now rosie Morn ascends the Court of  Jove  Lifts up her Light and opens Day above  The King dispatch'd his Heralds with Commands  To range the Camp and summon all the Bands  The gath'ring Hosts the Monarch's Word obey  While to the Fleet  Atrides  bends his way  In his black Ship the  Pylian  Prince he found  There calls a Senate of the Peers around  Th' Assembly plac'd the King of Men exprest  The Counsels lab'ring in his artful Breast  Friends and Confed'rates with attentive Ear  Receive my Words and credit what you hear  Late as I slumber'd in the Shades of Night  A Dream Divine appear'd before my Sight  Whose Visionary Form like  Nestor  came  The same in Habit and in Mien the same  The heav'nly  Phantome  hover'd o'er my Head  And Dost thou sleep Oh  Atreus'  Son he said  Ill suits a Chief who mighty Nations guides  Directs in Council and in War presides  To whom its Safety a whole People owes  To waste long Nights in indolent Repose  Monarch awake 'tis  Jove  's Command I bear  Thou and thy Glory claim his heav'nly Care  In just Array draw forth th' embattel'd Train  And lead the  Grecians  to the dusty Plain  Ev'n now O King 'tis giv'n thee to destroy  The lofty Tow'rs of wideextended  Troy  For now no more the Gods with Fate contend  At  Juno  's Suit the Heav'nly Factions end  Destruction hangs o'er yon' devoted Wall  And nodding  Ilion  waits th' impending Fall  This hear observant and the Gods obey  The Vision spoke and past in Air away  Now valiant Chiefs since Heav'n itself alarms  Unite and rouze the Sons of  Greece  to Arms  But first with Caution try what yet they dare  Worn with nine Years of unsuccessful War  To move the Troops to measure back the Main  Be mine and yours the Province to detain  He spoke and sate when  Nestor  rising said    Nestor  whom  Pylos'  sandy Realms obey'd  Princes of  Greece  your faithful Ears incline  Nor doubt the Vision of the Pow'rs Divine  Sent by great  Jove  to him who rules the Host  Forbid it Heav'n this Warning should be lost  Then let us haste obey the Gods Alarms  And join to rouze the Sons of  Greece  to Arms  Thus spoke the Sage The Kings without Delay  Dissolve the Council and their Chief obey  The sceptred Rulers lead the following Host  Pour'd forth in Millions darkens all the Coast  As from some Rocky Cleft the Shepherd sees  Clust'ring in Heaps on Heaps the driving Bees  Rolling and black'ning Swarms succeeding Swarms  With deeper Murmurs and more hoarse Alarms  Dusky they spread a closeembody'd Crowd  And o'er the Vale descends the living Cloud  So from the Tents and Ships a length'ning Train  Spreads all the Beach and wide o'ershades the Plain  Along the Region runs a deaf'ning Sound  Beneath their Footsteps groans the trembling Ground  Fame  flies before the Messenger of  Jove  And shining soars and claps her Wings above  Nine sacred Heralds now proclaiming loud  The Monarch's Will suspend the list'ning Crowd  Soon as the Throngs in Order rang'd appear  And fainter Murmurs dy'd upon the Ear  The King of Kings his awful Figure rais'd  High in his Hand the Golden Sceptre blaz'd  The Golden Sceptre of Celestial Frame  By  Vulcan  form'd from  Jove  to  Hermes  came  To  Pelops  He th' immortal Gift resign'd  Th' immortal Gift great  Pelops  left behind  In  Atreus'  Hand which not with  Atreus  ends  To rich  Thyestes  next the Prize descends  And now the Mark of  Agamemnon  's Reign  Subjects all  Argos  and controuls the Main  On this bright Sceptre now the King reclin'd  And artful thus pronounc'd the Speech design'd  Ye Sons of  Mars  partake your Leader's Care  Heroes of  Greece  and Brothers of the War  Of partial  Jove  with Justice I complain  And Heav'nly Oracles believ'd in vain  A safe Return was promis'd to our Toils  Renown'd triumphant and enrich'd with Spoils  Our Now shameful Flight alone can save the Host  Blood our Treasure and our Glory lost  So  Jove  decrees resistless Lord of All  At whose Command whole Empires rise or fall  He shakes the feeble Props of human Trust  And Towns and Armies humbles to the Dust  What Shame to  Greece  a fruitless War to wage  Oh lasting Shame in ev'ry future Age  Once great in Arms the common Scorn we grow  Repuls'd and baffled by a feeble Foe  So small their Number that if Wars were ceas'd  And  Greece  triumphant held a gen'ral Feast  All rank'd by Tens whole Decads when they dine  Must want a  Trojan  Slave to pour the Wine  But other Forces have our Hopes o'erthrown  And  Troy  prevails by Armies not her own  Now nine long Years of mighty  Jove  are run  Since first the Labours of this War begun  Our Cordage torn decay'd our Vessels lie  And scarce ensure the wretched Pow'r to fly  Haste then for ever leave the  Trojan  Wall  Our weeping Wives our tender Children call  'Tis Love Duty Safety summon us away  Nature's Voice and Nature we obey  Our shatter'd Barks may yet transport us o'er  Safe and inglorious to our native Shore  Fly  Grecians  fly your Sails and Oars employ  And dream no more of Heav'ndefended  Troy  His deep Design unknown the Hosts approve  Atrides'  Speech The mighty Numbers move  So roll the Billows to th'  Icarian  Shore  From East and South when Winds begin to roar  Burst their dark Mansions in the Clouds and sweep  The whitening Surface of the ruffled Deep  And as on Corn when Western Gusts descend  Before the Blast the lofty Harvests bend  Thus o'er the Field the moving Host appears  With nodding Plumes and Groves of waving Spears  The gath'ring Murmur spreads their trampling Feet  Beat the loose Sands and thicken to the Fleet  With longresounding Cries they urge the Train  To fit the Ships and launch into the Main  They toil they sweat thick Clouds of Dust arise  The doubling Clamours eccho to the Skies  Ev'n then the  Greeks  had left the hostile Plain  And Fate decreed the Fall of  Troy  in vain  But  Jove  's Imperial Queen their Flight survey'd  And sighing thus bespoke the blueey'd Maid  Shall then the  Grecians  fly Oh dire Disgrace  And leave unpunish'd this perfidious Race  Shall  Troy  shall  Priam  and th'Adult'rous Spouse  In Peace enjoy the Fruits of broken Vows  And bravest Chiefs in  Helen  's Quarrel slain  Lie unreveng'd on yon' detested Plain  Nolet my  Greeks  unmov'd by vain Alarms  Once more refulgent shine in Brazen Arms  Haste Goddess haste the flying Host detain  Nor let one Sail be hoisted on the Main  Pallas  obeys and from  Olympus'  Height  Swift to the Ships precipitates her Flight  Ulysses  first in publick Cares she found  For prudent Counsel like the Gods renown'd  Oppress'd with gen'rous Grief the Heroe stood  Nor drew his sable Vessels to the Flood  And is it thus divine  Laertes'  Son  Thus fly the  Greeks  the Martial Maid begun  Thus to their Country bear their own Disgrace  Fame eternal leave to  Priam  's Race  Shall beauteous  Helen  still remain unfreed  Still unreveng'd a thousand Heroes bleed  Haste gen'rous  Ithacus  prevent the Shame  Recall your Armies and your Chiefs reclaim  Your own resistless Eloquence employ  And to th' Immortals trust the Fall of  Troy  The Voice Divine confess'd the Warlike Maid  Ulysses  heard nor uninspir'd obey'd  Then meeting first  Atrides  from his Hand  Receiv'd th' Imperial Sceptre of Command  Thus grac'd Attention and Respect to gain  He runs he flies thro' all the  Grecian  Train  Each Prince of Name or Chief in Arms approv'd  He fir'd with Praise or with Persuasion mov'd  Warriors like you with Strength and Wisdom blest  By brave Examples should confirm the rest  The Monarch's Will not yet reveal'd appears  He tries our Courage but resents our Fears  Th' unwary  Greeks  his Fury may provoke  Not thus the King in secret Council spoke  Jove  loves our Chief from  Jove  his Honour springs  Beware for dreadful is the Wrath of Kings  But if a clam'rous vile  Plebeian  rose  Him with Reproof he check'd or tam'd with Blows  Be still thou Slave and to thy Betters yield  Unknown alike in Council and in Field  Ye Gods what Dastards would our Host command  Swept to the War the Lumber of a Land  Be silent Wretch and think not here allow'd  That worst of Tyrants an usurping Crowd  To One sole Monarch  Jove  commits the Sway  His are the Laws and Him let all obey  With Words like these the Troops  Ulysses  rul'd  The loudest silenc'd and the fiercest cool'd  Back to th' Assembly roll the thronging Train  Desert the Ships and pour upon the Plain  Murm'ring they move as when old  Ocean  roars  And heaves huge Surges to the trembling Shores  The groaning Banks are burst with bellowing Sound  The Rocks remurmur and the Deeps rebound  At length the Tumult sinks the Noises cease  And a still Silence lulls the Camp to Peace  Thersites  only clamour'd in the Throng  Loquacious loud and turbulent of Tongue  Aw'd by no Shame by no Respect controul'd  In Scandal busie in Reproaches bold  With witty Malice studious to defame  Scorn all his Joy and Laughter all his Aim  But chief he glory'd with licentious Style  To lash the Great and Monarchs to revile  His Figure such as might his Soul proclaim  One Eye was blinking and one Leg was lame  His MountainShoulders half his Breast o'erspread  Thin Hairs bestrew'd his long misshapen Head  Spleen to Mankind his envious Heart possest  And much he hated All but most the Best  Ulysses  or  Achilles  still his Theme  But Royal Scandal his Delight supreme  Long had he liv'd the Scorn of ev'ry  Greek  Vext when he spoke yet still they heard him speak  Sharp was his Voice which in the shrillest Tone  Thus with injurious Taunts attack'd the Throne  Amidst the Glories of so bright a Reign  What moves the great  Atrides  to complain  'Tis thine whate'er the Warrior's Breast inflames  The golden Spoil and thine the lovely Dames  With all the Wealth our Wars and Blood bestow  Thy Tents are crowded and thy Chests o'erflow  Thus at full Ease in Heaps of Riches roll'd  What grieves the Monarch Is it Thirst of Gold  Say shall we march with our unconquer'd Pow'rs  The  Greeks  and I to  Ilion  's hostile Tow'rs  And bring the Race of Royal Bastards here  For  Troy  to ransom at a Price too dear  But safer Plunder thy own Host supplies  Say would'st thou seize some valiant Leader's Prize  Or if thy Heart to gen'rous Love be led  Some Captive Fair to bless thy Kingly Bed  Whate'er our Master craves submit we must  Plagu'd with his Pride or punish'd for his Lust  Oh Women of  Achaia  Men no more  Hence let us fly and let him waste his Store  In Loves and Pleasures on the  Phrygian  Shore  We may be wanted on some busie Day  When  Hector  comes So great  Achilles  may  From him he forc'd the Prize we jointly gave  From him the fierce the fearless and the brave  And durst he as he ought resent that Wrong  This mighty Tyrant were no Tyrant long  Fierce from his Seat at this  Ulysses  springs  In gen'rous Vengeance of the King of Kings  With Indignation sparkling in his Eyes  He views the Wretch and sternly thus replies  Peace factious Monster born to vex the State  With wrangling Talents form'd for foul Debate  Curb that impetuous Tongue nor rashly vain  And singly mad asperse the Sov'reign Reign  Have we not known thee Slave of all our Host  The Man who acts the least upbraids the most  Think not the  Greeks  to shameful Flight to bring  Nor let those Lips profane the Name of King  For our Return we trust the heav'nly Pow'rs  Be that their Care to fight like Men be ours  But grant the Host with Wealth the Gen'ral load  Except Detraction what hast thou bestow'd  Suppose some Hero should his Spoils resign  Art thou that Hero could those Spoils be thine  Gods let me perish on this hateful Shore  And let these Eyes behold my Son no more  If on thy next Offence this Hand forbear  To strip those Arms thou ill deserv'st to wear  Expell the Council where our Princes meet  And send thee scourg'd and howling thro' the Fleet  He said and cow'ring as the Dastard bends  The weighty Sceptre on his Back descends  On the round Bunch the bloody Tumors rise  The Tears spring starting from his haggard Eyes  Trembling he sate and shrunk in abject Fears  From his vile Visage wip'd the scalding Tears  While to his Neighbour each express'd his Thought  Ye Gods what Wonders has  Ulysses  wrought  What Fruits his Conduct and his Courage yield  Great in the Council glorious in the Field  Gen'rous he rises in the Crown's Defence  To curb the factious Tongue of Insolence  Such just Examples on Offenders shown  Sedition silence and assert the Throne  'Twas thus the gen'ral Voice the Heroe prais'd  Who rising high th' Imperial Sceptre rais'd  The blueey'd  Pallas  his Celestial Friend  In Form a Herald bade the Crowds attend  Th' expecting Crowds in still Attention hung  To hear the Wisdom of his heav'nly Tongue  Then deeply thoughtful pausing e're he spoke  His Silence thus the prudent Hero broke  Unhappy Monarch whom the  Grecian  Race  With Shame deserting heap with vile Disgrace  Not such at  Argos  was their gen'rous Vow  Once all their Voice but ah forgotten now  Ne'er to return was then the common Cry  'Till  Troy  's proud Structures shou'd in Ashes lie  Behold them weeping for their native Shore  What cou'd their Wives or helpless Children more  What Heart but melts to leave the tender Train  And one short Month endure the Wintry Main  Few Leagues remov'd we wish our peaceful Seat  When the Ship tosses and the Tempests beat  Then well may this long Stay provoke their Tears  The tedious Length of nine revolving Years  Not for their Grief the  Grecian  Host I blame  But vanquish'd baffled oh eternal Shame  Expect the Time to  Troy  's Destruction giv'n  And try the Faith of  Calchas  and of Heav'n  What past at  Aulis Greece  can witness bear  And all who live to breathe this  Phrygian  Air  Beside a Fountain's sacred Brink we rais'd  Our verdant Altars and the Victims blaz'd  'Twas where the Planetree spread its Shades around  The Altars heav'd and from the crumbling Ground  A mighty Dragon shot of dire Portent  From  Jove  himself the dreadful Sign was sent  Strait to the Tree his sanguine Spires he roll'd  And curl'd around in many a winding Fold  The topmost Branch a MotherBird possest  Eight callow Infants fill'd the mossie Nest  Herself the ninth The Serpent as he hung  Stretch'd his black Jaws and crash'd the crying Young  While hov'ring near with miserable Moan  The drooping Mother wail'd her Children gone  The Mother last as round the Nest she flew  Seiz'd by the beating Wing the Monster slew  Nor long surviv'd to Marble turn'd he stands  A lasting Prodigy on  Aulis'  Sands  Such was the Will of  Jove  and hence we dare  Trust in his Omen and support the War  For while around we gaz'd with wondring Eyes  And trembling sought the Pow'rs with Sacrifice  Full of his God the rev'rend  Calchas  cry'd  Ye  Grecian  Warriors lay your Fears aside  This wondrous Signal  Jove  himself displays  Of long long Labours but Eternal Praise  As many Birds as by the Snake were slain  So many Years the Toils of  Greece  remain  But wait the Tenth for  Ilion  's Fall decreed  Thus spoke the Prophet thus the Fates succeed  Obey ye  Grecians  with Submission wait  Nor let your Flight avert the  Trojan  Fate  He said the Shores with loud Applauses sound  The hollow Ships each deaf'ning Shout rebound  Then  Nestor  thusThese vain Debates forbear  Ye talk like Children not like Heroes dare  Where now are all your high Resolves at last  Your Leagues concluded your Engagements past  Vow'd with Libations and with Victims then  Now vanish'd like their Smoke The Faith of Men  While useless Words consume th' unactive Hours  No wonder  Troy  so long resists our Pow'rs  Rise great  Atrides  and with Courage sway  We march to War if thou direct the Way  But leave the few that dare resist thy Laws  The mean Deserters of the  Grecian  Cause  To grudge the Conquests mighty  Jove  prepares  And view with Envy our successful Wars  On that great Day when first the martial Train  Big with the Fate of  Ilion  plow'd the Main  Jove  on the Right a prosp'rous Signal sent  And Thunder rolling shook the Firmament  Encourag'd hence maintain the glorious Strife  'Till ev'ry Soldier grasp a  Phrygian  Wife  'Till  Helen  's Woes at full reveng'd appear  And  Troy  's proud Matrons render Tear for Tear  Before that Day if any  Greek  invite  His Country's Troops to base inglorious Flight  Stand forth that  Greek  and hoist his Sail to fly  And dye the Dastard first who dreads to dye  But now O Monarch all thy Chiefs advise  Nor what they offer thou thy self despise  Among those Counsels let not mine be vain  In Tribes and Nations to divide thy Train  His sep'rate Troops let ev'ry Leader call  Each strengthen each and all encourage all  What Chief or Soldier of the num'rous Band  Or bravely fights or ill obeys Command  When thus distinct they war shall soon be known  And what the Cause of  Ilion  not o'erthrown  If Fate resists or if our Arms are slow  If Gods above prevent or Men below  To him the King How much thy Years excell  In Arts of Council and in speaking well  Oh would the Gods in Love to  Greece  decree  But ten such Sages as they grant in thee  Such Wisdom soon should  Priam  's Force destroy  And soon should fall the haughty Tow'rs of  Troy  But  Jove  forbids who plunges those he hates  In fierce Contention and in vain Debates  Now great  Achilles  from our Aid withdraws  By me provok'd a Captive Maid the Cause  If e'er as Friends we join the  Trojan  Wall  Must shake and heavy will the Vengeance fall  But now ye Warriors take a short Repast  And well refresh'd to bloody Conflict haste  His sharpen'd Spear let ev'ry  Grecian  wield  And ev'ry  Grecian  fix his Brazen Shield  Let all excite the fiery Steeds of War  And all for Combate fit the ratling Car  This Day this dreadful Day let each contend  No Rest no Respite 'till the Shades descend  'Till Darkness or 'till Death shall cover all  Let the War bleed and let the Mighty fall  'Till bath'd in Sweat be ev'ry manly Breast  With the huge Shield each brawny Arm deprest  Each aking Nerve refuse the Lance to throw  And each spent Courser at the Chariot blow  Who dares inglorious in his Ships to stay  Who dares to tremble on this signal Day  That Wretch too mean to fall by martial Pow'r  The Birds shall mangle and the Dogs devour  The Monarch spoke and strait a Murmur rose  Loud as the Surges when the Tempest blows  That dash'd on broken Rocks tumultuous roar  And foam and thunder on the stony Shore  Strait to the Tents the Troops dispersing bend  The Fires are kindled and the Smokes ascend  With hasty Feasts they sacrifice and pray  T'avert the Dangers of the doubtful Day  A Steer of five Year's Age large limb'd and fed  To  Jove  's high Altars  Agamemnon  led  There bade the noblest of the  Grecian  Peers  And  Nestor  first as most advanc'd in Years  Next came  Idomeneus  and  Tydeus'  Son  Ajax  the less and  Ajax Telamon  Then wise  Ulysses  in his Rank was plac'd  And  Menelaus  came unbid the last  The Chiefs surround the destin'd Beast and take  The sacred Off'ring of the salted Cake  When thus the King prefers his solemn Pray'r  Oh Thou whose Thunder rends the clouded Air  Who in the Heav'n of Heav'ns hast fix'd thy Throne  Supreme of Gods unbounded and alone  Hear and before the burning Sun descends  Before the Night her gloomy Veil extends  Low in the Dust be laid yon' hostile Spires  Be  Priam  's Palace sunk in  Grecian  Fires  In  Hector  's Breast be plung'd this shining Sword  And slaughter'd Heroes groan around their Lord  Thus pray'd the Chief His unavailing Pray'r  Great  Jove  refus'd and tost in empty Air  The God averse while yet the Fumes arose  Prepar'd new Toils and doubled Woes on Woes  Their Pray'rs perform'd the Chiefs the Rite pursue  The Barley sprinkled and the Victim slew  The Limbs they sever from th' inclosing Hyde  The Thighs selected to the Gods divide  On these in double Cauls involv'd with Art  The choicest Morsels lie from ev'ry Part  From the cleft Wood the crackling Flames aspire  While the fat Victim feeds the sacred Fire  The Thighs thus sacrific'd and Entrails drest  Th'Assistants part transfix and roast the rest  Then spread the Tables the Repast prepare  Each takes his Seat and each receives his Share  Soon as the Rage of Hunger was supprest  The gen'rous  Nestor  thus the Prince addrest  Now bid thy Heralds sound the loud Alarms  And call the Squadrons sheath'd in Brazen Arms  Now seize th' Occasion now the Troops survey  And lead to War when Heav'n directs the Way  He said the Monarch issu'd his Commands  Strait the loud Heralds call the gath'ring Bands  The Chiefs inclose their King the Hosts divide  In Tribes and Nations rank'd on either side  High in the midst the blueey'd Virgin flies  From Rank to Rank she darts her ardent Eyes  The dreadful  Aegis Jove  's immortal Shield  Blaz'd on her Arm and lighten'd all the Field  Round the vast Orb an hundred Serpents roll'd  Form'd the bright Fringe and seem'd to burn in Gold  With this each  Grecian  's manly Breast she warms  Swells their bold Hearts and strings their nervous Arms  No more they sigh inglorious to return  But breathe Revenge and for the Combate burn  As on some Mountain thro' the lofty Grove  The crackling Flames ascend and blaze above  The Fires expanding as the Winds arise  Shoot their long Beams and kindle half the Skies  So from the polish'd Arms and brazen Shields  A gleamy Splendor flash'd along the Fields  Not less their Number than th' embody'd Cranes  Or milkwhite Swans in  Asius'  watry Plains  That o'er the Windings of  Cayster  's Springs  Stretch their long Necks and clap their rustling Wings  Now tow'r aloft and course in airy Rounds  Now light with Noise with Noise the Field resounds  Thus num'rous and confus'd extending wide  The Legions crowd  Scamander  's flow'ry Side  With rushing Troops the Plains are cover'd o'er  And thund'ring Footsteps shake the sounding Shore  Along the River's level Meads they stand  Thick as in Spring the Flow'rs adorn the Land  Or Leaves the Trees or thick as Insects play  The wandring Nation of a Summer's Day  That drawn by milky Steams at Ev'ning Hours  In gather'd Swarms surround the Rural Bow'rs  From Pail to Pail with busie Murmur run  The gilded Legions glitt'ring in the Sun  So throng'd so close the  Grecian  Squadrons stood  In radiant Arms and thirst for  Trojan  Blood  Each Leader now his scatter'd Force conjoins  In close Array and forms the deep'ning Lines  Not with more Ease the skilful Shepherd Swain  Collects his Flock from Millions on the Plain  The King of Kings majestically tall  Tow'rs o'er his Armies and outshines them all  Like some proud Bull that round the Pastures leads  His SubjectHerds the Monarch of the Meads  Great as the Gods th' exalted Chief was seen  His Strength like  Neptune  and like  Mars  his Mien  Jove  o'er his Eyes celestial Glories

tells us in the twenty sixth Chapter of his Art of Poetry that this Place had been objected to by some Criticks in those Times They thought it gave a very ill Idea of the military Discipline of the  Greeks  to represent a whole Army unguarded and all the Leaders asleep They also pretended it was ridiculous to describe all the Gods sleeping besides  Jupiter  To both these  Aristotle  answers that nothing is more usual or allowable than that Figure which puts  All  for the  greater Part  One may add with respect to the latter Criticism that nothing could give a better Image of the Superiority of  Jupiter  to the other Gods or of the supreme Being to all second Causes than the Vigilancy here ascrib'd to him over all Things Divine and Human  II  VERSE  Fly hence deluding Dream    It appears from  Aristotle Poet cap  that  Homer  was accus'd of Impiety for making  Jupiter  the Author of a Lye in this Passage It seems there were anciently these Words in his Speech to the Dream    Let us give him great Glory  Instead of which we have in the present Copies  but  Hippias  found a way to bring off  Homer  only by placing the Accent on the last Syllable but one  for  the Infinitive for the Imperative which amounts to no more than that he bade the Dream to  Promise  him great Glory But  Macrobius de somnio Scip l    c  takes off this Imputation entirely and will not allow there was any Lye in the Case  "  Agamemnon  says he was order'd by the Dream to lead out  All  the Forces of the  Greeks    is the word and promis'd the Victory on that Condition Now  Achilles  and his Forces not being summon'd to the Assembly with the rest that Neglect absolv'd  Jupiter  from his Promise"  This Remark Madam  Dacier  has inserted without mentioning its Author Mr  Dacier  takes notice of a Passage in the Scripture exactly parallel to this where God is represented making use of the Malignity of his Creatures to accomplish his Judgments 'Tis in  Chron  ch ℣  And the Lord said Who will persuade  Ahab  that he may go up and fall at  Ramoth Gilead  And there came forth a Spirit and stood before the Lord and said I will persuade him And the Lord said unto him Wherewith And he said I will go forth and I will be a lying Spirit in the Mouth of all his Prophets And he said Thou shalt persuade him and prevail also Go forth and do so  Vide  Dacier  upon  Aristotle  cap  III  VERSE  Descends and hovers o'er  Atrides'  Head    The whole Action of the  Dream  is beautifully natural and agreeable to Philosophy It perches on his Head to intimate that Part to be the Seat of the Soul It is circumfused about him to express that total Possession of the Senses which Fancy has during our Sleeps It takes the Figure of the Person who was dearest to  Agamemnon  as whatever we think of most when awake is the common Object of our Dreams And just at the Instant of its vanishing it leaves such an Impression that the Voice seems still to sound in his Ear No Description can be more exact or lively  Eustathius Dacier  IV  VERSE  Draw forth th' embattel'd Train  c  The Dream here repeats the Message of  Jupiter  in the same Terms that he receiv'd it It is no less than the Father of Gods and Men who gives the Order and to alter a word were Presumption  Homer  constantly makes his Envoys observe this Practice as a Mark of Decency and respect Madam  Dacier  and others have applauded this in general and ask'd by what Authority an Embassador could alter the Terms of his Commission since he is not greater or wiser than the Person who gave the Charge But this is not always the Case in our Author who not only makes use of this Conduct with respect to the Orders of a higher Power but in regard to Equals also as when one Goddess desires another to represent such an Affair and she immediately takes the Words from her Mouth and repeats them of which we have an Instance in this Book Some Objection too may be rais'd to this manner when Commissions are given in the utmost haste in a Battel or the like upon sudden Emergencies where it seems not very natural to suppose a Man has time to get so many Words by heart as he is made to repeat exactly In the present Instance the Repetition is certainly graceful tho'  Zenodotus  thought it not so the third time when  Agamemnon  tells his Dream to the Council I do not pretend to decide upon the Point For tho' the Reverence of the Repetition seem'd less needful in that Place than when it was deliver'd immediately from  Jupiter  yet as  Eustathius  observes it was necessary for the Assembly to know the Circumstances of this Dream that the Truth of the Relation might be unsuspected  V  VERSE  Now valiant Chiefs  c  The best Commentary extant upon the first Part of this Book is in  Dionysius  of  Halicarnassus  who has given us an admirable Explication of this whole Conduct of  Agamemnon  in his second Treatise  He says  "This Prince had nothing so much at Heart as to draw the  Greeks  to a Battel yet knew not how to proceed without  Achilles  who had just retir'd from the Army and was apprehensive that the  Greeks  who were displeas'd at the Departure of  Achilles  might refuse Obedience to his Orders should he absolutely command it In this Circumstance he proposes to the Princes in Council to make a Tryal of arming the  Graecians  and offers an Expedient himself which was that he should sound their Dispositions by exhorting him to set sail for  Greece  but that then the other Princes should be ready to dissuade and detain them If any object to this Stratagem that  Agamemnon  's whole Scheme would be ruin'd if the Army should take him at his word which was very probable it is to be answer'd that his Design lay deeper than they imagine nor did he depend upon his Speech only for detaining them He had some Cause to fear the  Greeks  had a Pique against him which they had conceal'd and whatever it was he judg'd it absolutely necessary to know it before he proceeded to a Battel He therefore furnishes them with an Occasion to manifest it and at the same time provides against any ill Effects it might have by his secret Orders to the Princes It succeeds accordingly and when the Troops are running to embark they are stop'd by  Ulysses  and  Nestor  "  One may farther observe that this whole Stratagem is concerted in  Nestor  's Ship as one whose Wisdom and Secrecy was most confided in The Story of the Vision's appearing in his Shape could not but engage him in some degree It look'd as if  Jupiter  himself added Weight to his Counsels by making use of that venerable Appearance and knew this to be the most powerful Method of recommending them to  Agamemnon  It was therefore but natural for  Nestor  to second the Motion of the King and by the help of his Authority it prevail'd on the other Princes  VI  VERSE  As from some rocky Cleft    This is the first Simile in  Homer  and we may observe in general that he excels  all Mankind in the Number Variety and Beauty of his Comparisons There are scarce any in  Virgil  which are not translated from him and therefore when he succeeds best in them he is to be commended but as an Improver  Scaliger  seems not to have thought of this when he compares the Similes of these two Authors as indeed they are the Places most obvious to Comparison The present Passage is an Instance of it to which he opposes the following Verses in the first  Aeneid  Qualis apes aestate novâ per florea rura  Exercet sub sole labor cum gentis adultos  Educunt foetus aut cum liquentia mella  Stipant dulci distendunt nectare cellas  Aut onera accipiunt venientum aut agmine facto  Ignavum fucos pecus à praesepibus arcent  Fervet opus redolentque thymo fragrantia mella  This he very much prefers to  Homer  's and in particular extols the Harmony and Sweetness of the Versification above that of our Author against which Censure we need only appeal to the Ears of the Reader  c  But  Scaliger  was unlucky in his Choice of this particular Comparison There is a very fine one in the sixth  Aeneid  ℣ that better agrees with  Homer  's And nothing is more evident than that the design of these two is very different  Homer  intended to describe the  Multitude  of  Greeks  pouring out of the Ships  Virgil  the  Diligence  and  Labour  of the Builders at  Carthage  And  Macrobius  who observes this difference  Sat l    c  should also have found that therefore the Similes ought not to be compar'd together The Beauty of  Homer  's is not inferior to  Virgil  's if we consider with what Exactness it answers to its end It consists of three Particulars  the vast Number of the Troops is exprest in the Swarms their tumultuous manner of issuing out of the Ships and the perpetual Egression which seem'd without end are imaged in the Bees pouring out of the Rock and lastly their Dispersion over all the Shore in their descending on the Flowers in the Vales  Spondanus  was therefore mistaken when he thought the whole Application of this Comparison lay in the single word    catervatim  as  Chapman  has justly observ'd  VII  VERSE  Fame flies before    This assembling of the Army is full of Beauties The lively Description of their overspreading the Field the noble Boldness of the Figure when Fame is represented in Person shining at their Head the universal Tumult succeeded by a solemn Silence and lastly the graceful rising of  Agamemnon  all contribute to cast a Majesty on this Part In the Passage of the  Sceptre Homer  has found an artful and poetical manner of acquainting us with the high Descent of  Agamemnon  and celebrating the hereditary Right of his Family as well as finely hinted the Original of his Power to be deriv'd from Heaven in saying the Sceptre was first the Gift of  Jupiter  It is with reference to this that in the Line where he first mentions it he calls it  and accordingly it is translated in that Place  VIII  VERSE  And artful thus pronounc'd the Speech design'd    The Remarks of  Dionysius  upon this Speech I shall give the Reader altogether tho' they lie scatter'd in his two Discourses  the second of which is in a great Degree but a Repetition of the Precepts and Examples of the first This happen'd I believe from his having compos'd them at distinct Times and upon different Occasions  "It is an exquisite Piece of Art when you seem to aim at persuading one thing and at the same time inforce the contrary This kind of Rhetorick is of great use in all  Occasions of Danger and is what  Homer  has afforded a most powerful Example of in the Oration of  Agamemnon  'Tis a Method perfectly wonderful and even carries in it an Appearance of Absurdity for all that we generally esteem the Faults of Oratory by this means become the Virtues of it Nothing is look'd upon as a greater Error in a Rhetorician than to alledge such Arguments as either are easily answer'd or may be retorted upon himself the former is a weak Part the latter a dangerous one and  Agamemnon  here designedly deals in both For it is plain that if a Man must not use weak Arguments or such as may make against him when he intends to persuade the Thing he says then on the other side when he does not intend it he must observe the contrary Proceeding and make what are the Faults of Oratory in general the Excellencies of that Oration in particular or otherwise he will contradict his own Intention and perssuade the contrary to what he means  Agamemnon  begins with an Argument easily answer'd by telling them that  Jupiter had promis'd to crown their Arms with Victory  For if  Jupiter  had promis'd this it was a reason for the Stay in the Camp  But now  says he  Jove has deceiv'd us and we must return with Ignominy  This is another of the same kind for it shews what a Disgrace it is to return What follows is of the second sort and may be turn'd against him  Jove will have it so  For which they have only  Agamemnon  's Word but  Jove  's own Promise for the contrary  That God has overthrown many Cities and will yet overturn many others  This was a strong Reafon to stay and put their Confidence in him  It is shameful to have it told to all Posterity that so many thousand  Greeks  after a War of so long Continuance at last return'd home baffled and unsuccessful  All this might have been said by a profest Adversary to the Cause he pleads and indeed is the same thing  Ulysses  says elsewhere in Reproach of their Flight The Conclusion evidently shews the Intent of the Speaker  Haste then let us fly  the Word which of all others was most likely to prevail upon them to stay the most open Term of Disgrace he could  possibly have us'd 'Tis the same which  Juno  makes use of to  Minerva Minerva  to  Ulysses  and  Ulysses  again to the Troops to dissuade their Return the same which  Agamemnon  himself had used to insult  Achilles  and which  Homer  never employs but with the Mark of Cowardice and Infamy"  The same Author farther observes  "That this whole Oration has the Air of being spoken in a Passion It begins with a Stroke of the greatest Rashness and Impatience Jupiter  has been unjust Heaven has deceiv'd us  This renders all he shall say of the less Authority at the same time that it conceals his own Artifice for his Anger seems to account for the Incongruities he utters"  I could not suppress so fine a Remark tho' it falls out of the Order of those which precede it  Before I leave this Article I must take notice that this Speech of  Agamemnon  is again put into his Mouth in the ninth  Iliad  and according to  Dionysius  for the same Purpose to detain the Army at the Siege after a Defeat tho' it seems unartful to put the same Trick twice upon the  Greeks  by the same Person and in the same Words too We may indeed suppose the first Feint to have remain'd undiscover'd but at best it is a Management in the Poet not very entertaining to the Readers  IX  VERSE  So small their Number  c  This Part has a low Air in Comparison with the rest of the Speech  Scaliger  calls it  Tabernariam Orationem  But it is well observ'd by Madam  Dacier  that the Image  Agamemnon  here gives of the  Trojans  does not only render their Numbers contemptible in Comparison of the  Greeks  but their Persons too For it makes them appear but as a few vile Slaves fit only to serve them with Wine To which we may add that it affords a Prospect to his Soldiers of their future State and Triumph after the Conquest of their Enemies  This Passage gives me occasion to animadvert upon a Computation of the Number of the  Trojans  which the learned  Angelus Politian  has offer'd at in his  Preface to  Homer He thinks they were fifty thousand without the Auxiliaries from the Conclusion of the eighth  Iliad  where it is said there were a thousand funeral Piles of  Trojans  and fifty Men attending each of them But that the Auxiliaries are to be admitted into that Number appears plainly from this Place  Agamemnon  expresly distinguishes the native  Trojans  from the Aids and reckons but one to ten  Graecians  at which Estimate there could not be above ten thousand  Trojans See the Notes on the Catalogue  X  VERSE  Decay'd our Vessels lie  And scarce ensure the wretched Power to fly  This and some other Passages are here translated correspondent to the general Air and Sense of this Speech rather than just to the Letter The telling them in this Place how much their Shipping was decay'd was a Hint of their Danger in returning as Madam  Dacier  has remark'd  XI  VERSE  So roll the Billows  c  One may take notice that  Homer  in these two Similitudes has judiciously made choice of the two most wavering and inconstant Things in Nature to compare with the Multitude the  Waves  and  Ears  of  Corn  The first alludes to the Noise and Tumult of the People in the breaking and rolling of the Billows the second to their taking the same Course like Corn bending one way and both to the Easiness with which they are mov'd by every  Breath  XII  VERSE  To one sole Monarch    Those Persons are under a Mistake who would make this Sentence a Praise of Absolute Monarchy  Homer  speaks it only with regard to a General of an Army during the time of his Commission Nor is  Agamemnon  styl'd  King of Kings  in any other Sense than as the rest of the Princes had given him the supreme  Authority over them in the Siege  Aristotle  defines a King    Leader of the War Judge of Controversies  and  President of the Ceremonies of the Gods  That he had the principal Care of religious Rites appears from many Places in  Homer  and that his Power was no where absolute but in War for we find  Agamemnon  insulted in the Council but in the Army threatning Deserters with Death He was under an Obligation to preserve the Privileges of his Country pursuant to which Kings are called by our Author  and  the Dispensers or Managers of Justice And  Dionysius  of  Halicarnassus  acquaints us that the old  Graecian  Kings whether Hereditary or Elective had a Council of their chief Men as  Homer  and the most ancient Poets testify nor was it he adds in those Times as in ours when Kings have a full Liberty to do whatever they please  Dion Hal lib    Hist  XIII  VERSE Thersites  only    The Ancients have ascrib'd to  Homer  the first Sketch of  Satyric  or  Comic  Poetry of which sort was his Poem call'd  Margites  as  Aristotle  reports Tho' that Piece be lost this Character of  Thersites  may give us a Taste of his Vein in that kind But whether ludicrous Descriptions ought to have Place in the  Epic  Poem has been justly question'd Neither  Virgil  nor any of the most approv'd Ancients have thought fit to admit them into their Compositions of that Nature nor any of the best Moderns except  Milton  whose Fondness for  Homer  might be the reason of it However this is in its kind a very masterly Part and our Author has shewn great Judgment in the Particulars he has chosen to compose the Picture of a pernicious Creature of Wit the chief of which are a Desire of promoting Laughter at any rate and a Contempt of his Superiors And he sums up the whole very strongly by saying that  Thersites  hated  Achilles  and  Ulysses  in which as  Plutarch  has remark'd in his Treatise of Envy and Hatred he makes it the utmost Completion of an ill Character to bear a Malevolence to the best Men What  is farther observable is that  Thersites  is never heard of after this his first Appearance Such a scandalous Character is to be taken no more notice of than just to shew that 'tis despised  Homer  has observ'd the same Conduct with regard to the most  deform'd  and most  beautiful  Person of his Poem For  Nireus  is thus mention'd once and no more throughout the  Ilaid  He places a worthless  Beauty  and an illnatur'd  Wit  upon the same Foot and shews that the Gifts of the Body without those of the Mind are not more despicable than those of the Mind itself without Virtue  XIV  VERSE  Amidst the Glories    'Tis remark'd by  Dionysius Halicar  in his Treatise of the  Examination of Writers  that there could not be a better Artifice thought on to recal the Army to their Obedience than this of our Author When they were offended at their General in favour of  Achilles  nothing could more weaken  Achilles  's Interest than to make such a Fellow as  Thersites  appear of his Party whose Impertinence would give them a Disgust of thinking or acting like him There is no surer Method to reduce generous Spirits than to make them see they are pursuing the same Views with People of no Merit and such whom they cannot forbear despising themselves Otherwise there is nothing in this Speech but what might become the Mouth of  Nestor  himself if you except a word or two And had  Nestor  spoken it the Army had certainly set sail for  Greece  but because it was utter'd by a ridiculous Fellow whom they are asham'd to follow they are reduc'd and satisfy'd to continue the Siege  XV  VERSE  The  Greeks  and I    These Boasts of himself are the few Words which  Dionysius  objects to in the foregoing Passage I cannot but think the grave Commentators here very much mistaken who imagine  Thersites  in earnest in these Vaunts and seriously reprove his Insolence They seem to me manifest Strokes of Irony which had render'd them  so much the more improper in the Mouth of  Nestor  who was otherwise none of the least Boasters himself And consider'd as such they are equal to the rest of the Speech which has an infinite deal of Spirit Humour and Satyr  XVI  VERSE  He said and cow'ring    The vile Figure  Thersites  makes here is a good Piece of  Grotesque  the Pleasure express'd by the Soldiers at this Action of  Ulysses  notwithstanding they are disappointed by him of their Hopes of returning is agreeable to that generous Temper at once honest and thoughtless which is commonly found in military Men to whom nothing is so odious as a Dastard and who have not naturally the greatest Kindness for a Wit  XVII  VERSE  Unhappy Monarch  c  Quintilian  speaking of the various Kinds of Oratory which may be learn'd from  Homer  mentions among the greatest Instances the Speeches in this Book  Nonne vel unus liber quo missa ad Achillem legatio continetur vel in primo inter duces illa contentio vel dictae in secundo sententiae omnes litium ac consiliorum explicat artes Affectus quidem vel illos mites vel hos concitatos nemo erit tam indoctus qui non suâ in potestate hunc autorem habuisse fateatur  It is indeed hardly possible to find any where more refin'd Turns of Policy or more artful Touches of Oratory We have no sooner seen  Agamemnon  excel in one sort but  Ulysses  is to shine no less in another directly opposite to it When the Stratagem of pretending to set sail had met with too ready a Consent from the People his Eloquence appears in all the Forms of Art In his first Speech he had persuaded the Captains with Mildness telling them the People's Glory depended upon them and readily giving a Turn to the first Design which had like to have been so dangerous by representing it only as a Project of  Agamemnon  to discover the cowardly In his second he had commanded the Soldiers  with Bravery and made them know what Part they sustain'd in the War In his third he had rebuk'd the Seditious in the Person of  Thersites  by Reproofs Threats and actual Chastisements And now in this fourth when all are gather'd he applies to them in Topics which equally affect them all He raises their Hearts by putting them in mind of the Promises of Heaven and those Prophecies of which as they had seen the Truth in the nine Years Delay they might now expect the Accomplishment in the tenth Year's Success which is a full Answer to what  Agamemnon  had said of  Jupiter  's deceiving them  Dionysius  observes one singular Piece of Art in  Ulysses  's manner of applying himself to the People when he would insinuate any thing to the Princes and addressing to the Princes when he would blame the People He tells the Soldiers they must not all pretend to be Rulers there let there be one King one Lord which is manifestly a Precept design'd for the Leaders to take to themselves In the same manner  Tiberius Rhetor  remarks the beginning of his last Oration to be a fine  Ethopopeia  or oblique Representation of the People upon whom the Severity of the Reproach is made to fall while he seems to render the King an Object of their Pity  Unhappy Monarch whom the  Graecian  Race  With Shame deserting  c  XVIII  VERSE  Then  Nestor  thus    Nothing is more observable than  Homer  's Conduct of this whole Incident by what judicious and wellimagined Degrees the Army is restrain'd and wrought up to the Desires of the General We have given the Detail of all the Methods  Ulysses  proceeded in The Activity of his Character is now to be contrasted with the Gravity of  Nestor  's who covers and strengthens the other's Arguments and constantly appears thro' the Poem a weighty Closer of Debates The  Greeks  had already seen their General give way to his Authority in the Dispute with  Achilles  in the former Book and could expect no less than that their Stay should be concluded  on by  Agamemnon  as soon as  Nestor  undertook that Cause For this was all they imagin'd his Discourse aim'd at but we shall find it had a farther Design from  Dionysius  of  Halicarnassus  "There are two things says that excellent Critick worthy of Admiration in the Speeches of  Ulysses  and  Nestor  which are the different Designs they speak with and the different Applauses they receive  Ulysses  has the Acclamations of the Army and  Nestor  the Praise of  Agamemnon  One may enquire the Reason why he extols the latter preferably to the former when all that  Nestor  alledges seems only a Repetition of the same Arguments which  Ulysses  had given before him It might be done in Encouragement to the old Man in whom it might raise a Concern to find his Speech not follow'd with so general an Applause as the other's But we are to refer the Speech of  Nestor  to that Part of Oratory which seems only to confirm what another has said and yet superinduces and carries a farther Point  Ulysses  and  Nestor  both compare the  Greeks  to Children for their unmanly Desire to return home they both reproach them with the Engagements and Vows they had past and were now about to break they both alledge the prosperous Signs and Omens receiv'd from Heaven Notwithstanding this the End of their Orations is very different  Ulysses  's Business was to detain the  Graecians  when they were upon the Point of flying  Nestor  finding that Work done to his Hands design'd to draw them instantly to Battel This was the utmost  Agamemnon  had aim'd at which  Nestor  's Artifice brings to pass for while they imagine by all he says that he is only persuading them to stay they find themselves unawares put into Order of Battel and led under their Princes to fight"  Dion Hal    Part    and    We may next take notice of some Particulars of this Speech Where he says they lose their time in  empty Words  he hints at the Dispute between  Agamemnon  and  Achilles  Where he speaks of those who  deserted the  Graecian  Cause  he glances at  Achilles  in particular When he represents  Helen  in Affliction and Tears he removes the Odium from the Person in whose Cause they were to fight and when he moves  Agamemnon  to advise with his Council artfully prepares for a Reception of his own Advice by that modest way of proposing it As for the Advice itself to divide the Army into Bodies each of which should be compos'd entirely of Men of the same Country nothing could be better judg'd both in regard to the present Circumstance and with an Eye to the future carrying on of the War For the first its immediate Effect was to take the whole Army out of its Tumult break whatever Cabals they might have form'd together by separating them into a new Division and cause every single Mutineer to come instantly under the View of his own proper Officer for Correction For the second it was to be thought the Army would be much strengthen'd by this Union Those of different Nations who had different Aims Interests and Friendships could not assist each other with so much Zeal or so well concur to the same End as when Friends aided Friends Kinsmen their Kinsmen  c  when each Commander had the Glory of his own Nation in view and a greater Emulation was excited between Body and Body as not only warring for the Honour of  Greece  in general but for that of every distinct  State  in particular  XIX  VERSE  How much thy Years excel    Every one has observ'd how glorious an Elogium of Wisdom  Homer  has here given where  Agamemnon  so far prefers it to Valour as to wish not for ten  Ajax's  or  Achilles's  but only for ten  Nestors  For the rest of this Speech  Dionysius  has summ'd it up as follows  "  Agamemnon  being now convinc'd the  Greeks  were offended at him on account of the Departure of  Achilles  pacifies them by a generous Confession of his Fault but then asserts the Character of a supreme Ruler and with the Air of Command threatens the Disobedient"  I cannot conclude this Part of the Speeches without remarking how beautifully they rise above one another and how they more and more awaken the Spirit of War in the  Graecians  In this last there is a wonderful Fire and Vivacity when he prepares them for the glorious  Toils they were to undergo by a warm and lively Description of them The Repetition of the Words in that Part has a Beauty which as well as many others of the same kind has been lost by most Translators    I cannot but believe  Milton  had this Passage in his Eye in that of his sixth Book  Let each  His Adamantine Coat gird well and each  Fit well his Helm gripe fast his orbed Shield  c  XX  VERSE  And  Menelaus  came unbid    The Criticks have enter'd into a warm Dispute whether  Menelaus  was in the right or in the wrong in coming uninvited Some maintaining it the Part of an Impertinent or a Fool to intrude upon another Man's Table and others insisting upon the Privilege a Brother or a Kinsman may claim in this Case The  English  Reader had not been troubled with the Translation of this Word  but that  Plato  and  Plutarch  have taken notice of the Passage The Verse following this in most Editions  c being rejected as spurious by  Demetrius Phalereus  is omitted here upon his Authority  XXI  VERSE  The dreadful  Aegis Jove  's immortal Shield    Homer does not expresly call it a Shield in this Place but he does in the fifth  Iliad  where this  Aegis  is describ'd with a Sublimity that is inexpressible The Figure of the  Gorgon  's Head upon it is there specify'd which will justify the mention of the Serpents in the Translation here The Verses are remarkably sonorous in the Original The Image of the Goddess  of Battels blazing with her immortal Shield before the Army inspiring every Heroe and assisting to range the Troops is agreeable to the bold Painting of our Author And the Encouragement of a divine Power seem'd no more than was requisite to change so totally the Dispositions of the  Graecians  as to make them now more ardent for the Combate than they were before desirous of a Return This finishes the Conquest of their Inclinations in a manner at once wonderfully Poetical and correspondent to the Moral which is every where spread through  Homer  that nothing is entirely brought about but by the divine Assistance  XXII  VERSE  As on some Mountain  c  The Imagination of  Homer  was so vast and so lively that whatsoever Objects presented themselves before him impress'd their Images so forcibly that he pour'd them forth in Comparisons equally simple and noble without forgetting any Circumstance which could instruct the Reader and make him see those Objects in the same strong Light wherein he saw them himself And in this one of the principal Beauties of Poetry consists  Homer  on the sight of the March of this numerous Army gives us five Similes in a Breath but all entirely different The first regards the Splendor of their Armour As a Fire  c  The second the various Movements of so many thousands before they can range themselves in BattelArray Like the Swans  c  The third respects their Number As the Leaves or Flowers  c  The fourth the Ardour with which they run to the Combate Like the Legions of Insects  c  And the fifth the Obedience and exact Discipline of the Troops ranged without Confusion under their Leaders As Flocks under their Shepherds This Fecundity and Variety can never be enough admired  Dacier  XXIII  VERSE  Or milk white Swans on  Asius'  watry Plains    Scaliger who is seldom just to our Author yet confesses these  Verses to be  plenissima Nectaris  But he is greatly mistaken when he accuses this Simile of Impropriety on the Supposition that a Number of Birds flying without Order are here compar'd to an Army ranged in Array of Battel On the contrary  Homer  in this expresses the Stir and Tumult the Troops were in before they got into Order running together from the Ships and Tents  But when they are plac'd in their Ranks he compares them to the Flocks under their Shepherds This Distinction will plainly appear from the Detail of the five Similes in the foregoing Note  Virgil  has imitated this with great Happiness in his seventh  Aeneid  Ceu quondam nivei liquida inter nubila cycni  Cum sese è pastu referunt longa canoros  Dant per colla modos sonat amnis Asia longè  Pulsa palus  Like a long Team of snowy Swans on high  Which clap their Wings and cleave the liquid Sky  When homeward from their watry Pastures born  They sing and  Asia  's Lakes their Notes return  Mr  Dryden  in this Place has mistaken  Asius  for  Asia  which  Virgil  took care to distinguish by making the first Syllable of  Asius  long as of  Asia  short Tho' if we believe Madam  Dacier  he was himself in an Error both here and in the first  Georgic  Quae Asia circum  Dulcibus in stagnis rimantur prata Caystri  For she will not allow that  can be a Patronymic Adjective but the Genitive of a proper Name  which being turn'd into  Ionic  is  and by a  Syncope  makes  This puts me in mind of another Criticism upon the th Verse of this Book 'Tis observ'd that  Virgil  uses  Inarime  for  Arime  as if he had read  instead of    Scaliger  ridicules this trivial Remark and asks if it can be  imagin'd that  Virgil  was ignorant of the Name of a Place so near him as  Baiae  It is indeed unlucky for good Writers that Men who have Learning should lay a Stress upon such Trifles and that those who have none should think it Learning to do so  XXIV  VERSE  Or thick as Insects play    This Simile translated literally runs thus  As the numerous Troops of Flies about a Shepherd's Cottage in the Spring when the Milk moistens the Pails such Numbers of  Greeks  stood in the Field against the  Trojans  desiring their Destruction  The Lowness of this Image in Comparison with those which precede it will naturally shock a modern Critick and would scarce be forgiven in a Poet of these Times The utmost a Translator can do is to heighten the Expression so as to render the Disparity less observable which is endeavour'd here and in other Places If this be done successfully the Reader is so far from being offended at a low Idea that it raises his Surprize to find it grown great in the Poet's Hands of which we have frequent Instances in  Virgil  's  Georgicks  Here follows another of the same kind in the Simile of  Agamemnon  to a  Bull  just after he has been compar'd to  Jove Mars  and  Neptune  This  Eustathius  tells us was blam'd by some Criticks and Mr  Hobbes  has left it out in his Translation The Liberty has been taken here to place the humbler Simile first reserving the noble one as a more magnificent Close of the Description The bare turning the Sentence removes the Objection  Milton  who was a close Imitator of our Author has often copy'd him in these humble Comparisons He has not scrupled to insert one in the midst of that pompous Description of the Rout of the RebelAngels in the sixth Book where the Son of God in all his dreadful Majesty is represented pouring his Vengeance upon them  As a Herd  Of Goats or tim'rous Flocks together throng'd  Drove them before him Thunderstruck  XXV  VERSE  Great as the Gods    Homer here describes the Figure and Port of  Agamemnon  with all imaginable Grandeur in making him appear cloath'd with the Majesty of the greatest of the Gods and when  Plutarch  in his second Oration of the Fortune of  Alexander  blamed the Comparison of a Man to three Deities at once that Censure was not pass'd upon  Homer  as a Poet but by  Plutarch  as a Priest This Character of Majesty in which  Agamemnon  excels all the other Heroes is preserv'd in the different Views of him throughout the  Iliad  It is thus he appears on his Ship in the Catalogue thus he shines in the Eyes of  Priam  in the third Book thus again in the beginning of the thirteenth and so in the rest  XXVI  VERSE  Say Virgins    It is hard to conceive any Address more solemn any Opening to a Subject more noble and magnificent than this Invocation of  Homer  before his Catalogue That Omnipresence he gives to the Muses their Post in the highest Heaven their comprehensive Survey thro' the whole Extent of the Creation are Circumstances greatly imagined Nor is any thing more perfectly fine or exquisitely moral than the Opposition of the extensive Knowledge of the Divinities on the one side to the Blindness and Ignorance of Mankind on the other The Greatness and Importance of his Subject is highly rais'd by his exalted manner of declaring the Difficulty of it  Not tho' my Lungs were Brass  c and by the Air he gives as if what follows were immediately inspir'd and no less than the joint Labour of all the Muses  XXVII  VERSE  The hardy Warriors    The Catalogue begins in this Place which I forbear to treat of at present only I must acknowledge here that the Translation has not been exactly punctual to the Order in which  Homer  places his Towns  However it has not trespass'd against Geography the Transpositions I mention being no other than such minute ones as  Strabo  confesses the Author himself is not free from    Lib  There is not to my Remembrance any Place throughout this Catalogue omitted a Liberty which Mr  Dryden  has made no difficulty to take and to confess in his  Virgil  But a more scrupulous Care was owing to  Homer  on account of that wonderful Exactness and unequal'd Diligence which he has particularly shewn in this Part of his Work  XXVIII  VERSE  Down their broad Shoulders  c  The  Greek  has it    à tergo comantes  It was the Custom of these People to shave the forepart of their Heads which they did that their Enemies might not take the Advantage of seizing them by the Hair the hinder Part they let grow as a valiant Race that would never turn their Backs Their manner of fighting was hand to hand without quitting their Javelins in the way of our Pikemen  Plutarch  tells us this in the Life of  Theseus  and cites to strengthen the Authority of  Homer  some Verses of  Archilochus  to the same Effect  Eobanus Hessus  who translated  Homer  into  Latine  Verse was therefore mistaken in his Version of this Passage  Praecipuè Jaculatores hastamque periti  Vibrare longis contingere pectora telis  XXIX  VERSE  Eager and loud from Man to Man he flies    The Figure  Menelaus  makes in this Place is remarkably distinguish'd from the rest and sufficient to shew his Concern in the War was personal while the others acted only for Interest or Glory in general No Leader in all the List is represented thus eager and passionate he is louder than them  all in his Exhortations more active in running among the Troops and inspirited with the Thoughts of Revenge which he still encreases with the secret Imagination of  Helen  's Repentance This Behaviour is finely imagined  The Epithet  which is apply'd in this and other Places to  Menelaus  and which literally signifies  loudvoiced  is made by the Commentators to mean  valiant  and translated  bello strenuus  The reason given by  Eustathius  is that a loud Voice is a Mark of Strength the usual Effect of Fear being to cut short the Respiration I own this seems to be forc'd and rather believe it was one of those kind of SirNames given from some distinguishing Quality of the Person as that of a loud Voice might belong to  Menelaus  which Mons  Boileau  mentions in his ninth Reflection upon  Longinus  in the same manner as some of our Kings were called  Edward Longshanks William Rufus  c But however it be the Epithet taken in the literal Sense has a Beauty in this Verse from the Circumstance  Menelaus  is described in which determined the Translator to use it  XXX  VERSE  New to all the Dangers of the Main    The  Arcadians  being an Inland People were unskill'd in Navigation for which reason  Agamemnon  furnish'd them with Shipping From hence and from the last Line of the Description of the Sceptre where he is said to preside over  many Islands Thucydides  takes occasion to observe that the Power of  Agamemnon  was superior to the rest of the Princes of  Greece  on account of his Naval Forces which had render'd him Master of the Sea  Thucyd lib    XXXI  VERSE  Three Ships with  Nireus  This Leader is no where mention'd but in these Lines and is an Exception to the Observation of  Macrobius  that all the Persons of the Catalogue make their Appearance afterwards in the Poem  Homer  himself gives us the reason because  Nireus  had but a  small Share of Worth and Valour his Quality only gave him a Privilege to be nam'd among Men The Poet has caused him to be remember'd no less than  Achilles  or  Ulysses  but yet in no better manner than he deserv'd whose only Qualification was his Beauty 'Tis by a bare Repetition of his Name three times which just leaves some Impression of him on the Mind of the Reader Many others of as trivial Memory as  Nireus  have been preserv'd by Poets from Oblivion but few Poets have ever done this Favour to Want of Merit with so much Judgment  Demetrius Phalereus    Sect  takes notice of this beautiful Repetition which in a just Deference to so delicate a Critick is here preserv'd in the Translation  XXXII  VERSE  The Grace and Glory of the beauteous Kind    He gives  Alcestis  this Elogy of the Glory of her Sex for her conjugal Piety who dy'd to preserve the Life of her Husband  Admetus Euripides  has a Tragedy on this Subject which abounds in the most masterly Strokes of Tenderness In particular the first Act which contains the Description of her Preparation for Death and her Behaviour in it can never be enough admired  XXXIII  VERSE  In twenty Ships the bold  Perrhaebians  came    I cannot tell whether it be worth observing that except  Ogilby  we have not met with one Translator who has exactly preserv'd the Number of the Ships  Chapman  puts eighteen under  Eumelus  instead of eleven  Hobbes  but twenty under  Ascalaphus  and  Ialmen  instead of thirty and but thirty under  Menelaus  instead of sixty  Valterie  the former  French  Translator has given  Agapenor  forty for sixty and  Nestor  forty for ninety Madam  Dacier  gives  Nestor  but eighty I must confess this Translation not to have been quite so exact as  Ogilby  's having cut off one from the Number of  Eumelus  's Ships and two from those of  Guneus Eleven  and  two and  twenty  would sound but oddly in  English  Verse and a Poem contracts a Littleness by insisting on such trivial Niceties  XXXIV  VERSE  Or rein'd the noblest Steeds    This coupling together the Men and Horses seems odd enough but  Homer  every where treats these noble Animals with remarkable Regard We need not wonder at this Enquiry  which were the best Horses  from him who makes his Horses of heavenly Extraction as well as his Heroes who makes his Warriours address them with Speeches and excite them by all those Motives which affect a human Breast who describes them sheding Tears of Sorrow and even capable of Voice and Prophecy In most of which Points  Virgil  has not scrupled to imitate him  XXXV  VERSE  His Troops  c  The Image in these Lines of the Amusements of the  Myrmidons  while  Achilles  detain'd them from the Fight has an exquisite Propriety in it Tho' they are not in Action their very Diversions are Military and a kind of Exercise of Arms The cover'd Chariot and feeding Horses make a natural Part of the Picture and nothing is finer than the manly Concern of the Captains who as they are suppos'd more sensible of Glory than the Soldiers take no share in their Diversions but wander sorrowfully round the Camp and lament their being kept from the Battel This difference betwixt the Soldiers and the Leaders as  Dacier  observes is a Decorum of the highest Beauty  Milton  has admirably imitated this in the Description he gives in his second Book of the Diversions of the Angels during the Absence of  Lucifer  Part on the Plain or in the Air sublime  Upon the Wing or in swift Race contend  Part curb their fiery Steeds or shun the Goal  With rapid Wheels or fronted Brigades form  But how nobly and judiciously has he raised the Image in proportion to the Nature of those more exalted Beings in that which follows  Others with vast  Typhoean  Rage more fell  Rend up both Rocks and Hills and ride the Air  In Whirlwind Hell scarce holds the wild Uproar  XXXVI  VERSE  As when angry  Jove  The Comparison preceding this of a Fire which runs thro' the Corn and blazes to Heaven had exprest at once the dazling of their Arms and the Swiftness of their March After which  Homer  having mention'd the Sound of their Feet superadds another Simile which comprehends both the Ideas of the Brightness and the Noise for here says  Eustathius  the Earth appears to  burn  and  groan  at the same time Indeed the first of these Similes is so full and so noble that it scarce seem'd possible to be exceeded by any Image drawn from Nature But  Homer  to raise it yet higher has gone into the  Marvellous  given a prodigious and supernatural Prospect and brought down  Jupiter  himself array'd in all his Terrors to discharge his Lightnings and Thunders on  Typhoeus  The Poet breaks out into this Description with an Air of Enthusiasm which greatly heightens the Image in general while it seems to transport him beyond the Limits of an exact Comparison And this daring manner is particular to our Author above all the Ancients and to  Milton  above all the Moderns  XXXVII  VERSE  From  Practius'  Stream  Percote  's Pasture Lands    Homer does not expresly mention  Practius  as a River but  Strabo lib  tells us it is to be understood so in this Passage The Appellative of Pasture Lands to  Percote  is justify'd in the  th Iliad  ℣ where  Hicetaon  is said to feed his Oxen in that Place  XXXVIII  VERSE Axius  that swells with all his neighb'ring Rills    According to the common Reading this Verse should be translated Axius  that diffuses his beautiful Waters over the Land  But we are assured by  Strabo  that  Axius  was a muddy River and that the Ancients understood it thus Axius  that receives into it several beautiful Rivers  The Criticism lies in the last word of the Verse  which  Strabo  reads  and interprets of the River  Aea  whose Waters were pour'd into  Axius  However  Homer  describes this River agreeable to the vulgar reading in  Il  ℣  This Version takes in both  OBSERVATIONS on the CATALOGUE  IF we look upon this Piece with an Eye to ancient Learning it may be observ'd that however fabulous the other Parts of  Homer  's Poem may be according to the Nature of Epic Poetry this Account of the People Princes and Countries is purely Historical founded on the real Transactions of those Times and by far the most valuable Piece of History and Geography left us concerning the State of  Greece  in that early Period  Greece  was then divided into several Dynasties which our Author has enumerated under their respective Princes and his Division was look'd upon so exact that we are told of many Controversies concerning the Boundaries of  Graecian  Cities which have been decided upon the Authority of this Piece  Eustathius  has collected together the following Instances The City of  Calydon  was adjudg'd to the  Aetolians  notwithstanding the Pretensions of  Aeolia  because  Homer  had rank'd it among the Towns belonging to the former  Sestos  was given to those of  Abydos  upon the Plea that he had said the  Abydonians  were Possessors of  Sestos Abydos  and  Arisbe  When the  Milesians  and People of  Priene  disputed their Claim to  Mycale  a Verse of  Homer  carry'd it in favour of the  Milesians  And the  Athenians  were put in Possession of  Salamis  by another which was cited by  Solon  or as some think interpolated by him for that Purpose Nay in so high Estimation has this Catalogue been held that as  Porphyry  has written there have been Laws in some Nations for the Youth to learn it by heart and particularly  Cerdias  whom  Cuperus de Apoth Homer  takes to be  Cercydas  a Lawgiver of the  Megalopolitans  made it one to his Countrymen  But if we consider the Catalogue purely as poetical it will not want its Beauties in that Light  Rapin  who was none of the most superstitious Admirers of our Author reckons it among those Parts which had particularly charm'd him We may observe first what an Air of Probability is spread over the whole Poem by the particularizing of every Nation and People concern'd in this War Secondly what an entertaining Scene he presents to us of so many Countries drawn in their liveliest and most natural Colours while we wander along with him amidst a beautiful Variety of Towns Havens Forests Vineyards Groves Mountains and Rivers and are perpetually amus'd with his Observations on the different Soils Products Situations or Prospects Thirdly what a noble Review he passes before us of so mighty an Army drawn out in order Troop by Troop which had the Number only been told in the Gross had never fill'd the Reader with so great a Notion of the Importance of the Action Fourthly the Description of the differing Arms and manner of fighting of the Soldiers and the various Attitudes he had given to the Commanders Of these Leaders the greatest Part are either the immediate Sons of Gods or the Descendants of Gods and how great an Idea must we have of a War to the waging of which so many DemiGods and Heroes are assembled Fifthly the several artful Compliments he paid by this means to his own Country in general and many of his Contemporaries in particular by a Celebration of the Genealogies ancient Seats and Dominions of the great Men of his Time Sixthly the agreeable Mixture of Narrations from Passages of History or Fables with which he amuses and relieves us at proper Intervals And lastly the  admirable Judgment wherewith he introduces this whole Catalogue just at a Time when the Posture of Affairs in the Army render'd such a Review of absolute Necessity to the  Greeks  and in a Pause of Action while each was refreshing himself to prepare for the ensuing Battels  Macrobius  in his  Saturnalia lib    cap  has given us a judicious Piece of Criticism in the Comparison betwixt the Catalogues of  Homer  and of  Virgil  in which he justly allows the Preference to our Author for the following Reasons  Homer  says he has begun his Description from the most noted Promontory of  Greece  he means that of  Aulis  where was the narrowest Passage to  Euboea  From thence with a regular Progress he describes either the maritime or mediterranean Towns as their Situations are contiguous he never passes with sudden Leaps from Place to Place omitting those which lie between but proceeding like a Traveller in the way he has begun constantly returns to the Place from whence he digress'd 'till he finishes the whole Circle he design'd  Virgil  on the contrary has observ'd no Order in the Regions describ'd in his Catalogue  l  but is perpetually breaking from the Course of the Country in a loose and desultory manner You have  Clusium  and  Cosae  at the beginning next  Populonia  and  Ilva  then  Pisae  which lie at a vast distance in  Etruria  and immediately after  Cerete Pyrgi  and  Graviscae  Places adjacent to  Rome  From hence he is snatch'd to  Liguria  then to  Mantua  The same Negligence is observable in his Enumeration of the Aids that follow'd  Turnus  in  l    Macrobius  next remarks that whatever Persons are nam'd by  Homer  in his Catalogue are afterwards introduc'd in his Battels and whenever any others are kill'd he mentions only a Multitude in general Whereas  Virgil  he continues has spar'd himself the Labour of that Exactness For not only several whom he mentions in the List are never heard of in the War but others make a Figure in the War of whom we had no notice in the List For Example he specifies a thousand Men under  Massicus  who came from  Clusium l  ℣  Turnus  soon afterwards is in the Ship which had carry'd King  Osinius  from the same Place  l  ℣ This  Osinius  was never nam'd before nor is it probable a  King should serve under  Massicus  Nor indeed does either  Massicus  or  Osinius  ever make their Appearance in the BattelsHe proceeds to instance several others who tho' celebrated for Heroes in the Catalogue have no farther notice taken of them throughout the Poem In the third Place he animadverts upon the Confusion of the same Names in  Virgil  As where  Corinaeus  in the ninth Book is kill'd by  Asylas  ℣ and  Corinaeus  in the twelfth kills  Ebusus  ℣  Numa  is slain by  Nisus l  ℣ and  Aeneas  is afterwards in pursuit of  Numa l  ℣  Aeneas  kills  Camertes  in the tenth Book ℣ and  Juturna  assumes his Shape in the twelfth ℣ He observes the same Obscurity in his  Patronymics  There is  Palinurus Iasides  and  Iapix Iasides Hippocoon Hyrtacides  and  Asylas Hyrtacides  On the contrary the Caution of  Homer  is remarkable who having two of the Name of  Ajax  is constantly careful to distinguish them by  Oïleus  or  Telamonius  the  lesser  or the  greater Ajax  I know nothing to be alledg'd in Defence of  Virgil  in answer to this Author but the common Excuse that his  Aeneis  was left unfinish'd And upon the whole these are such trivial Slips as great Wits may pass over and little Criticks rejoice at  But  Macrobius  has another Remark which one may accuse of evident Partiality on the side of  Homer  He blames  Virgil  for having vary'd the Expression in his Catalogue to avoid the Repetition of the same Words and prefers the bare and unadorn'd Reiterations of  Homer  who begins almost every Article the same way and ends perpetually    c  Perhaps the best reason to be given for this had been the artless Manner of the first Times when such Repetitions were not thought ungraceful This may appear from several of the like Nature in the Scripture as in the twenty sixth Chapter of  Numbers  where the Tribes of  Israel  are enumerated in the Plains of  Moab  and each Division recounted in the same Words So in the seventh Chapter of the  Revelations Of the Tribe of  Gad  were sealed twelve thousand c  But the Words of  Macrobius  are  Has copias fortasse putat aliquis Divinae illi simplicitati praeferendas Sed nescio quo modo Homerum  repetitio illa unicè decet est genio antiqui Poetae digna  This is exactly in the Spirit and almost in the Cant of a true modern Critick The  Simplicitas  the  Nescio quo modo  the  Genio antiqui Poetae digna  are excellent general Phrases for those who have no Reasons  Simplicity  is our Word of Disguise for a shameful unpoetical Neglect of Expression The Term of the  Je ne sçay quoy  is the very Support of all ignorant Pretenders to Delicacy and to lift up our Eyes and talk of the  Genius of an Ancient  is at once the cheapest way of shewing our own Taste and the shortest way of criticizing the Wit of others our Contemporaries  One may add to the foregoing Comparison of these two Authors some Reasons for the Length of  Homer  's and the Shortness of  Virgil  's Catalogues As that  Homer  might have a Design to settle the Geography of his Country there being no Description of  Greece  before his Days which was not the Case with  Virgil Homer  's Concern was to compliment  Greece  at a time when it was divided into many distinct States each of which might expect a Place in his Catalogue But when all  Italy  was swallow'd up in the sole Dominion of  Rome Virgil  had only  Rome  to celebrate  Homer  had a numerous Army and was to describe an important War with great and various Events whereas  Virgil  's Sphere was much more confined The Ships of the  Greeks  are computed at about one thousand two hundred those of  Aeneas  and his Aids but at two and forty and as the Time of the Action of both Poems is the same we may suppose the Built of their Ships and the Number of Men they contain'd to be much alike So that if the Army of  Homer  amounts to about a hundred thousand Men that of  Virgil  cannot be above four thousand If any one be farther curious to know upon what this Computation is founded he may see it in the following Passage of  Thucidydes lib    "  Homer  's Fleet says he consisted of one thousand two hundred Vessels those of the  Boeotians  carry'd one hundred and twenty Men in each and those of  Philoctetes  fifty By these I suppose  Homer  exprest the largest and the smallest Size of Ships and therefore mentions no other sort But he tells us of those who sail'd  with  Philoctetes  that they serv'd both as Mariners and Soldiers in saying the Rowers were all of them Archers From hence the whole Number will be seen if we estimate the Ships at a Medium between the greatest and the least"  That is to say at eighty five Men to each Vessel which is the Mean between fifty and a hundred and twenty the Total comes to a hundred and two thousand Men  Plutarch  was therefore in a Mistake when he computed the Men at a hundred and twenty thousand which proceeded from his supposing a hundred and twenty in every Ship the contrary to which appears from the abovemention'd Ships of  Philoctetes  as well as from those of  Achilles  which are said to carry but fifty Men apiece in the sixteenth  Iliad  ℣  Besides  Virgil  's Imitation of this Catalogue there has scarce been any Epic Writer but has copy'd after it which is at least a Proof how beautiful this Part has been ever esteem'd by the finest Genius's in all Ages The Catalogues in the ancient Poets are generally known only I must take notice that the  Phocian  and  Boeotian  Towns in the fourth  Thebaid  of  Statius  are translated from hence Of the Moderns those which most excel owe their Beauty to the Imitation of some single Particular only of  Homer  Thus the chief Grace of  Tasso  's Catalogue consists in the Description of the Heroes without any thing remarkable on the side of the Countries Of the Pieces of Story he has interwoven that of  Tancred  's Amour to  Clorinda  is ill placed and evidently too long for the rest  Spencer  's Enumeration of the  British  and  Irish Rivers  in the eleventh Canto of his fourth Book is one of the noblest in the World if we consider his Subject was more confined and can excuse his not observing the Order or Course of the Country but his Variety of Description and Fruitfulness of Imagination are no where more admirable than in that Part  Milton  's List of the fallen Angels in his first Book is an exact Imitation of  Homer  as far as regards the Digressions of History and Antiquities and his manner of inserting them In all else I believe it must be allow'd inferior And indeed what  Macrobius  has said to cast  Virgil  below  Homer  will fall much more strongly upon all the rest  I had some cause to fear that this Catalogue which contributed so much to the Success of the Author should ruin that of the Translator A meer heap of proper Names tho' but for a few Lines together could afford little Entertainment to an  English  Reader who probably could not be appriz'd either of the Necessity or Beauty of this Part of the Poem There were but two things to be done to give it a chance to please him to render the Versification very flowing and musical and to make the whole appear as much a  Landscape  or  Piece of Painting  as possible For both of these I had the Example of  Homer  in general and  Virgil  who found the Necessity in another Age to give more into Description seem'd to authorise the latter in particular  Dionysius  of  Halicarnassus  in his Discourse of the  Structure and Disposition of Words  professes to admire nothing more than that harmonious Exactness with which  Homer  has placed these Words and soften'd the Syllables into each other so as to derive Musick from a Croud of Names which have in themselves no Beauty or Dignity I would flatter my self that I have practis'd this not unsuccessfully in our Language which is more susceptible of all the Variety and Power of Numbers than any of the modern and second to none but the  Greek  and  Roman  For the latter Point I have ventured to open the Prospect a little by the addition of a few Epithets or short Hints of Description to some of the Places mention'd tho' seldom exceeding the Compass of half a Verse the Space to which my Author himself generally confines these Pictures in Miniature But this has never been done without the best Authorities from the Ancients which may be seen under the respective Names in the Geographical Table following  The Table itself I thought but necessary to annex to the Map as my Warrant for the Situations assign'd in it to several of the Towns For in whatever Maps I have seen to this Purpose many of the Places are omitted or else set down at random  Sophianus  and  Gerbelius  have labour'd to settle the Geography of old  Greece  many of whose Mistakes were rectify'd by  Laurenbergius  These however deserv'd a greater Commendation than those who succeeded them and particularly  Sanson  's Map prefix'd to  Du Pin  's  Bibliotheque Historique  is miserably defective both in Omissions and false Placings which I am obliged to mention as it pretends to be design'd expresly for this Catalogue of  Homer  I am persuaded the greater Part of my Readers will have no Curiosity this way however they may allow me the Endeavour of gratifying those few who have The rest are at liberty to

Boeotia  on the Confines of  Phthiotis  upon the River  Sperchius  according to which Particulars it must have been seated as I have placed it  Livy  also seats it on the  Sperchius  All those Towns

 The ARGUMENT  The Duel of  Menelaus  and  Paris  THE Armies being ready to engage a single Combate is agreed upon between  Menelaus  and  Paris  by the Intervention of  Hector  for the Determination of the War  Iris  is sent to call  Helena  to behold the Fight She leads her to the Walls of  Troy  where  Priam  sate with his Counsellors observing the  Graecian  Leaders on the Plain below to whom  Helen  gives an Account of the chief of them The Kings on either Part take the solemn Oath for the Conditions of the Combate The Duel ensues wherein  Paris  being overcome is snatch'd away in a Cloud by  Venus  and transported to his Apartment She then calls  Helen  from the Walls and brings the Lovers together  Agamemnon  on the Part of the  Graecians  demands the Restoration of  Helen  and the Performance of the Articles  The three and twentieth Day still continues throughout this Book The  Scene  is sometimes in the  Fields  before  Troy  and sometimes in  Troy  itself  THE THIRD BOOK OF THE ILIAD  THUS by their Leader's Care each martial Band  Moves into Ranks and stretches o'er the Land  With Shouts the  Trojans  rushing from afar  Proclaim their Motions and provoke the War  So when inclement Winters vex the Plain  With piercing Frosts or thickdescending Rain  To warmer Seas the Cranes embody'd fly  With Noise and Order thro' the midway Sky  To PygmyNations Wounds and Death they bring  And all the War descends upon the Wing  But silent breathing Rage resolv'd and skill'd  By mutual Aids to fix a doubtful Field  Swift march the  Greeks  the rapid Dust around  Dark'ning arises from the labour'd Ground  Thus from his flaggy Wings when  Notus  sheds  A Night of Vapors round the MountainHeads  Swiftgliding Mists the dusky Fields invade  To Thieves more grateful than the Midnight Shade  While scarce the Swains their feeding Flocks survey  Lost and confus'd amidst the thicken'd Day  So wrapt in gath'ring Dust the  Grecian  Train  A moving Cloud swept on and hid the Plain  Now Front to Front the hostile Armies stand  Eager of Fight and only wait Command  When to the Van before the Sons of Fame  Whom  Troy  sent forth the beauteous  Paris  came  In Form a God the Panther's speckled Hyde  Flow'd o'er his Armour with an easy Pride  His bended Bow across his Shoulders flung  His Sword beside him negligently hung  Two pointed Spears he shook with gallant Grace  And dar'd the Bravest of the  Grecian  Race  As thus with glorious Air and proud Disdain  He boldly stalk'd the foremost on the Plain  Him  Menelaus  lov'd of  Mars  espies  With Heart elated and with joyful Eyes  So joys a Lion if the branching Deer  Or Mountain Goat his bulky Prize appear  In vain the Youths oppose the Mastives bay  The Lordly Savage rends the panting Prey  Thus fond of Vengeance with a furious Bound  In clanging Arms he leaps upon the Ground  From his high Chariot Him approaching near  The beauteous Champion views with Marks of Fear  Smit with a conscious Sense retires behind  And shuns the Fate he well deserv'd to find  As when some Shepherd from the rustling Trees  Shot forth to View a scaly Serpent sees  Trembling and pale he starts with wild Affright  And all confus'd precipitates his Flight  So from the King the shining Warrior flies  And plung'd amid the thickest  Trojans  lies  As Godlike  Hector  sees the Prince retreat  He thus upbraids him with a gen'rous Heat  Unhappy  Paris  but to Women brave  So fairly form'd and only to deceive  Oh had'st thou dy'd when first thou saw'st the Light  Or dy'd at least before thy Nuptial Rite  A better Fate than vainly thus to boast  And fly the Scandal of thy  Trojan  Host  Gods how the scornful  Greeks  exult to see  Their Fears of Danger undeceiv'd in thee  Thy Figure promis'd with a martial Air  But ill thy Soul supplies a Form so fair  In former Days in all thy gallant Pride  When thy tall Ships triumphant stem'd the Tide  When  Greece  beheld thy painted Canvas flow  And Crowds stood wond'ring at the passing Show  Say was it thus with such a baffled Mien  You met th' Approaches of the  Spartan  Queen  Thus from her Realm convey'd the beauteous Prize  And  Theseus  and  Menelaus  both her warlike Lords outshin'd in  Helen  's Eyes  This Deed thy Foes Delight thy own Disgrace  Thy Father's Grief and Ruin of thy Race  This Deed recalls thee to the proffer'd Fight  Or hast thou injur'd whom thou dar'st not right  Soon to thy Cost the Field wou'd make thee know  Thou keep'st the Consort of a braver Foe  Thy graceful Form instilling soft Desire  Thy curling Tresses and thy silver Lyre  Beauty and Youth in vain to these you trust  When Youth and Beauty shall be laid in Dust  Troy  yet may wake and one avenging Blow  Crush the dire Author of his Country's Woe  His Silence here with Blushes  Paris  breaks  'Tis just my Brother what your Anger speaks  But who like thee can boast a Soul sedate  So firmly Proof to all the Shocks of Fate  Thy Force like Steel a temper'd Hardness shows  Still edg'd to wound and still untir'd with Blows  Like Steel uplifted by some strenuous Swain  With falling Woods to strow the wasted Plain  Thy Gifts I praise nor thou despise the Charms  With which a Lover golden  Venus  arms  Soft moving Speech and pleasing outward Show  No Wish can gain 'em but the Gods bestow  Yet wou'd'st thou have the proffer'd Combate stand  The  Greeks  and  Trojans  seat on either Hand  Then let a midway Space our Hosts divide  And on that Stage of War the Cause be try'd  By  Paris  there the  Spartan  King be fought  For beauteous  Helen  and the Wealth she brought  And who his Rival can in Arms subdue  His be the Fair and his the Treasure too  Thus with a lasting League your Toils may cease  And  Troy  possess her fertile Fields in Peace  Thus may the  Greeks  review their native Shore  Much fam'd for gen'rous Steeds for Beauty more  He said The Challenge  Hector  heard with Joy  Then with his Spear restrain'd the Youth of  Troy  Held by the midst athwart and near the Foe  Advanc'd with Steps majestically slow  While round his dauntless Head the  Grecians  pour  Their Stones and Arrows in a mingled Show'r  Then thus the Monarch great  Atrides  cry'd  Forbear ye Warriors lay the Darts aside  A Parley  Hector  asks a Message bears  We know him by the various Plume he wears  Aw'd by his high Command the  Greeks  attend  The Tumult silence and the Fight suspend  While from the Centre  Hector  rolls his Eyes  On either Host and thus to both applies  Hear all ye  Trojans  all ye  Grecian  Bands  What  Paris  Author of the War demands  Your shining Swords within the Sheath restrain  And pitch your Lances in the yielding Plain  Here in the midst in either Army's sight  He dares the  Spartan  King to single Fight  And wills that  Helen  and the ravish'd Spoil  That caus'd the Contest shall reward the Toil  Let these the brave triumphant Victor grace  And diff'ring Nations part in Leagues of Peace  He spoke in still Suspense on either side  Each Army stood The  Spartan  Chief reply'd  Me too ye Warriors hear whose fatal Right  A World engages in the Toils of Fight  To me the Labour of the Field resign  Me  Paris  injur'd all the War be mine  Fall he that must beneath his Rival's Arms  And live the rest secure of future Harms  Two Lambs devoted by your Country's Rite  To  Earth  a sable to the  Sun  a white  Prepare ye  Trojans  while a third we bring  Select to  Jove  th' Inviolable King  Let rev'rend  Priam  in the Truce engage  And add the Sanction of consid'rate Age  His Sons are faithless headlong in Debate  And Youth itself an empty wav'ring State  Cool Age advances venerably wise  Turns on all hands its deepdiscerning Eyes  Sees what befell and what may yet befall  Concludes from both and best provides for all  The Nations hear with rising Hopes possest  And peaceful Prospects dawn in ev'ry Breast  Within the Lines they drew their Steeds around  And from their Chariots issu'd on the Ground  Next all unbuckling the rich Mail they wore  Lay'd their bright Arms along the sable Shore  On either side the meeting Hosts are seen  With Lances fix'd and close the Space between  Two Heralds now dispatch'd to  Troy  invite  The  Phrygian  Monarch to the Peaceful Rite  Talthybius  hastens to the Fleet to bring  The Lamb for  Jove  th' Inviolable King  Meantime to beauteous  Helen  from the Skies  The various Goddess of the Rainbow flies  Like fair  Laodicè  in Form and Face  The loveliest Nymph of  Priam  's Royal Race  Her in the Palace at her Loom she found  The golden Web her own sad Story crown'd  The  Trojan  Wars she weav'd herself the Prize  And the dire Triumphs of her fatal Eyes  To whom the Goddess of the painted Bow  Approach and view the wond'rous Scene below  Each hardy  Greek  and valiant  Trojan  Knight  So dreadful late and furious for the Fight  Now rest their Spears or lean upon their Shields  Ceas'd is the War and silent all the Fields  Paris  alone and  Sparta  's King advance  In single Fight to toss the beamy Lance  Each met in Arms the Fate of Combate tries  Thy Love the Motive and thy Charms the Prize  This said the manycolour'd Maid inspires  Her Husband's Love and wakes her former Fires  Her Country Parents all that once were dear  Rush to her Thought and force a tender Tear  O'er her fair Face a snowy Veil she threw  And softly sighing from the Loom withdrew  Her Handmaids  Clymenè  and  Aethra  wait  Her silent Footsteps to the  Scaean  Gate  There sate the Seniors of the  Trojan  Race  Old  Priam  's Chiefs and most in  Priam  's Grace  The King the first  Thymaetes  at his side  Lampus  and  Clytius  long in Council try'd  Panthus  and  Hicetäon  once the strong  And next the wisest of the Rev'rend Throng  Antenor  grave and sage  Ucalegon  Lean'd on the Walls and bask'd before the Sun  Chiefs who no more in bloody Fights engage  But Wise thro' Time and Narrative with Age  In SummerDays like Grashoppers rejoice  A bloodless Race that send a feeble Voice  These when the  Spartan  Queen approach'd the Tow'r  In secret own'd resistless Beauty's Pow'r  They cry'd No wonder such Celestial Charms  For nine long Years have set the World in Arms  What winning Graces what majestick Mien  She moves a Goddess and she looks a Queen  Yet hence oh Heav'n convey that fatal Face  And from Destruction save the  Trojan  Race  The good old  Priam  welcom'd her and cry'd  Approach my Child and grace thy Father's Side  See on the Plain thy  Grecian  Spouse appears  The Friends and Kindred of thy former Years  No Crime of thine our present Suff'rings draws  Not Thou but Heav'ns disposing Will the Cause  The Gods these Armies and this Force employ  The hostile Gods conspire the Fate of  Troy  But lift thy Eyes and say What  Greek  is He  Far as from hence these aged Orbs can see  Around whose Brow such martial Graces shine  So tall so awful and almost Divine  Tho' some of larger Stature tread the Green  None match his Grandeur and exalted Mien  He seems a Monarch and his Country's Pride  Thus ceas'd the King and thus the Fair reply'd  Before thy Presence Father I appear  With conscious Shame and reverential Fear  Ah had I dy'd e're to these Walls I fled  False to my Country and my Nuptial Bed  My Brothers Friends and Daughter left behind  False to them all to  Paris  only kind  For this I mourn 'till Grief or dire Disease  Shall waste the Form whose Crime it was to please  The King of Kings  Atrides  you survey  Great in the War and great in Arts of Sway  My Brother once before my Days of Shame  And oh that still he bore a Brother's Name  With Wonder  Priam  view'd the Godlike Man  Extoll'd the happy Prince and thus began  O blest  Atrides  born to prosp'rous Fate  Successful Monarch of a mighty State  How vast thy Empire Of yon' matchless Train  What Numbers lost what Numbers yet remain  In  Phrygia  once were gallant Armies known  In ancient Time when  Otreus'  fill'd the Throne  When Godlike  Mygdon  led their Troops of Horse  And I to join them rais'd the  Trojan  Force  Against the Manlike  Amazons  we stood  And  Sangar  's Stream ran purple with their Blood  But far inferior those in manly Grace  And Strength of Numbers to this  Grecian  Race  This said once more he view'd the martial Train  What's He whose Arms lie scatter'd on the Plain  Broad is his Breast his Shoulders larger spread  Tho' great  Atrides  overtops his Head  Nor yet appear his Care and Conduct small  From Rank to Rank he moves and orders all  The stately Ram thus measures o'er the Ground  And Master of the Flocks surveys them round  Then  Helen  thus Whom your discerning Eyes  Have singled out is  Ithacus  the Wife  A barren Island boasts his glorious Birth  His Fame for Wisdom fills the spacious Earth  Antenor  took the Word and thus began  My self O King have seen that wondrous Man  When trusting  Jove  and hospitable Laws  To  Troy  he came to plead the  Grecian  Cause  Great  Menelaus  urg'd the same Request  My House was honour'd with each Royal Guest  I knew their Persons and admir'd their Parts  Both brave in Arms and both approv'd in Arts  Erect the  Spartan  most engag'd our View  Ulysses  seated greater Rev'rence drew  When  Atreus'  Son harangu'd the list'ning Train  Just was his Sense and his Expression plain  His Words succinct yet full without a Fault  He spoke no more than just the Thing he ought  But when  Ulysses  rose in Thought profound  His modest Eyes he fix'd upon the Ground  As one unskill'd or dumb he seem'd to stand  Nor rais'd his Head nor stretch'd his sceptred Hand  But when he speaks what Elocution flows  Soft as the Fleeces of descending Snows  The copious Accents fall with easy Art  Melting they fall and sink into the Heart  Wond'ring we hear and fix'd in deep Surprize  Our Ears refute the Censure of our Eyes  The King then ask'd as yet the Camp he view'd  What Chief is that with Giant Strength endu'd  Whose brawny Shoulders and whose swelling Chest  And lofty Stature far exceed the rest  Ajax  the great the beauteous Queen reply'd  Himself an Host the  Grecian  Strength and Pride  See bold  Idomeneus  superior tow'rs  Amidst yon' Circle of his  Cretan  Pow'rs  Great as a God I saw him once before  With  Menelaus  on the  Spartan  Shore  The rest I know and could in Order name  All valiant Chiefs and Men of mighty Fame  Yet two are wanting of the num'rous Train  Whom long my Eyes have sought but sought in vain  Castor  and  Pollux  first in martial Force  One bold on Foot and one renown'd for Horse  My Brothers these the same our native Shore  One House contain'd us as one Mother bore  Perhaps the Chiefs from warlike Toils at ease  For distant  Troy  refus'd to sail the Seas  Perhaps their Sword some nobler Quarrel draws  Asham'd to combate in their Sister's Cause  So spoke the Fair nor knew her Brothers Doom  Wrapt in the cold Embraces of the Tomb  Adorn'd with Honours in their native Shore  Silent they slept and heard of Wars no more  Meantime the Heralds thro' the crowded Town  Bring the rich Wine and destin'd Victims down  Idaeus'  Arms the golden Goblets prest  Who thus the venerable King addrest  Arise O Father of the  Trojan  State  The Nations call thy joyful People wait  To seal the Truce and end the dire Debate  Paris  thy Son and  Sparta  's King advance  In measur'd Lists to toss the weighty Lance  And who his Rival shall in Arms subdue  His be the Dame and his the Treasure too  Thus with a lasting League our Toils may cease  And  Troy  possess her fertile Fields in Peace  So shall the  Greeks  review their native Shore  Much fam'd for gen'rous Steeds for Beauty more  With Grief he heard and bade the Chiefs prepare  To join his milkwhite Coursers to the Car  He mounts the Seat  Antenor  at his side  The gentle Steeds thro'  Scaea  's Gates they guide  Next from the Car descending on the Plain  Amid the  Grecian  Host and  Trojan  Train  Slow they proceed The sage  Ulysses  then  Arose and with him rose the King of Men  On either side a sacred Herald stands  The Wine they mix and on each Monarch's Hands  Pour the full Urn Then drew the  Grecian  Lord  His Cutlace sheath'd beside his pondrous Sword  From the sign'd Victims crops the curling Hair  The Heralds part it and the Princes share  Then loudly thus before th' attentive Bands  He calls the Gods and spreads his lifted Hands  O first and greatest Pow'r whom all obey  Who high on  Ida  's holy Mountain sway  Eternal  Jove  and you bright Orb that roll  From East to West and view from Pole to Pole  Thou Mother  Earth  and all ye living  Floods  Infernal  Furies  and  Tartarean  Gods  Who rule the Dead and horrid Woes prepare  For perjur'd Kings and all who falsely swear  Hear and be Witness If by  Paris  slain  Great  Menelaus  press the fatal Plain  The Dame and Treasures let the  Trojan  keep  And  Greece  returning plow the watry Deep  If by my Brother's Lance the  Trojan  bleed  Be his the Wealth and beauteous Dame decreed  Th' appointed Fine let  Ilion  justly pay  And ev'ry Age record the signal Day  This if the  Phrygians  shall refuse to yield  Arms must revenge and  Mars  decide the Field  With that the Chief the tender Victims slew  And in the Dust their bleeding Bodies threw  The vital Spirit issu'd at the Wound  And left the Members quiv'ring on the Ground  From the same Urn they drink the mingled Wine  And add Libations to the Pow'rs Divine  While thus their Pray'rs united mount the Sky  Hear mighty  Jove  and hear ye Gods on high  And may their Blood who first the League confound  Shed like this Wine distain the thirsty Ground  May all their Consorts serve promiscuous Lust  And all their Race be scatter'd as the Dust  Thus either Host their Imprecations join'd  Which  Jove  refus'd and mingled with the Wind  The Rites now finish'd rev'rend  Priam  rose  And thus express'd a Heart o'ercharg'd with Woes  Ye  Greeks  and  Trojans  let the Chiefs engage  But spare the Weakness of my feeble Age  In yonder Walls that Object let me shun  Nor view the Danger of so dear a Son  Whose Arms shall conquer and what Prince shall fall  Heav'n only knows for Heav'n disposes all  This said the hoary King no longer stay'd  But on his Car the slaughter'd Victims laid  Then seiz'd the Reins his gentle Steeds to guide  And drove to  Troy Antenor  at his Side  Bold  Hector  and  Ulysses  now dispose  The Lists of Combate and the Ground inclose  Next to decide by sacred Lots prepare  Who first shall launce his pointed Spear in Air  The People pray with elevated Hands  And Words like these are heard thro' all the Bands  Immortal  Jove  high Heav'n's superior Lord  On lofty  Ida  's holy Mount ador'd  Whoe'er involv'd us in this dire Debate  Oh give that Author of the War to Fate  And Shades Eternal Let Division cease  And joyful Nations join in Leagues of Peace  With Eyes averted  Hector  hasts to turn  The Lots of Fight and shakes the brazen Urn  Then  Paris  thine leap'd forth by fatal Chance  Ordain'd the first to whirl the weighty Lance  Both Armies sate the Combate to survey  Beside each Chief his Azure Armour lay  And round the Lists the gen'rous Coursers neigh  The beauteous Warrior now arrays for Fight  In gilded Arms magnificently bright  The Purple Cuishes clasp his Thighs around  With Flow'rs adorn'd and silver Buckles bound  Lycaon  's Cors'let his fair Body drest  Brac'd in and fitted to his softer Breast  A radiant Baldric o'er his Shoulder ty'd  Sustains the Sword that glitters at his side  His youthful Face a polish'd Helm o'erspread  The waving Horsehair nodded on his Head  His figur'd Shield a shining Orb he takes  And in his Hand a pointed Jav'lin shakes  With equal Speed and fir'd by equal Charms  The  Spartan  Hero sheaths his Limbs in Arms  Now round the Lists th' admiring Armies stand  With Jav'lins fix'd the  Greek  and  Trojan  Band  Amidst the dreadful Vale the Chiefs advance  All pale with Rage and shake the threat'ning Lance  The  Trojan  first his shining Jav'lin threw  Full on  Atrides'  ringing Shield it flew  Nor pierc'd the brazen Orb but with a Bound  Leap'd from the Buckler blunted on the Ground  Atrides  then his massy Lance prepares  In Act to throw but first prefers his Pray'rs  Give me great  Jove  to punish lawless Lust  And lay the  Trojan  gasping in the Dust  Destroy th' Aggressor aid my righteous Cause  Avenge the Breach of hospitable Laws  Let this Example future Times reclaim  And guard from Wrong fair Friendship's holy Name  He said and poiz'd in Air the Jav'lin sent  Thro'  Paris'  Shield the forceful Weapon went  His Cors'let pierces and his Garment rends  And glancing downward near his Flank descends  The wary  Trojan  bending from the Blow  Eludes his Death and disappoints the Foe  But fierce  Atrides  wav'd his Sword and strook  Full on his Casque the crested Helmet shook  The brittle Steel unfaithful to his Hand  Broke short the Fragments glitter'd on the Sand  The raging Warrior to the spacious Skies  Rais'd his upbraiding Voice and angry Eyes  Then is it vain in  Jove  himself to trust  And is it thus the Gods assist the Just  When Crimes provoke us Heav'n Success denies  The Dart falls harmless and the Faulchion flies  Furious he said and tow'rd the  Grecian  Crew  Seiz'd by the Crest th' unhappy Warrior drew  Struggling he follow'd while th' embroider'd Thong  That ty'd his Helmet dragg'd the Chief along  Then had his Ruin crown'd  Atrides'  Joy  But  Venus  trembl'd for the Price of  Troy  Unseen she came and burst the golden Band  And left an empty Helmet in his Hand  The Casque enrag'd amidst the  Greeks  he threw  The  Greeks  with Smiles the polish'd Trophy view  Then as once more he lifts the deadly Dart  In Thirst of Vengeance at his Rival's Heart  The Queen of Love her favour'd Champion shrouds  For Gods can all things in a Veil of Clouds  Rais'd from the Field the panting Youth she led  And gently laid him on the Bridal Bed  With pleasing Sweets his fainting Sense renews  And all the Dome perfumes with Heav'nly Dews  Meantime the brightest of the Female Kind  The matchless  Helen  o'er the Walls reclin'd  To her beset with  Trojan  Beauties came  In  Groea  's Form the  Venus  Laughterloving Dame    Groea  her Fav'rite Maid wellskill'd to cull  The snowie Fleece and wind the twisted Wool  The Goddess softly shook her silken Vest  That shed Perfumes and whisp'ring thus addrest  Haste happy Nymph for thee thy  Paris  calls  Safe from the Fight in yonder lofty Walls  Fair as a God with Odours round him spread  He lies and waits thee on the wellknown Bed  Not like a Warrior parted from the Foe  But some gay Dancer in the publick Show  She spoke and  Helen  's secret Soul was mov'd  She scorn'd the Champion but the Man she lov'd  Fair  Venus'  Neck her Eyes that sparkled Fire  And Breast reveal'd the Queen of soft Desire  Struck with her Presence strait the lively Red  Forsook her Cheek and trembling thus she said  Then is it still thy Pleasure to deceive  And Woman's Frailty always to believe  Say to new Nations must I cross the Main  Or carry Wars to some soft  Asian  Plain  For whom must  Helen  break her second Vow  What other  Paris  is thy Darling now  Left to  Atrides  Victor in the Strife  An odious Conquest and a Captive Wife  Hence let me sail And if thy  Paris  bear  My Absence ill let  Venus  ease his Care  A Handmaid Goddess at his Side to wait  Renounce the Glories of thy Heav'nly State  Be fix'd for ever to the  Trojan  Shore  His Spouse or Slave and mount the Skies no more  For me to lawless Love no longer led  I scorn the Coward and detest his Bed  Else should I merit everlasting Shame  And keen Reproach from ev'ry  Phrygian  Dame  Ill suits it now the Joys of Love to know  Too deep my Anguish and too wild my Woe  Then thus incens'd the  Paphian  Queen replies  Obey the Pow'r from whom thy Glories rise  Should  Venus  leave thee ev'ry Charm must fly  Fade from thy Cheek and languish in thy Eye  Cease to provoke me lest I make thee more  The World's Aversion than their Love before  Now the bright Prize for which Mankind engage  Then the sad Victim of the Publick Rage  At this the Fairest of her Sex obey'd  And veil'd her Blushes in a silken Shade  Unseen and silent from the Train she moves  Led by the Goddess of the Smiles and Loves  Arriv'd and enter'd at the Palace Gate  The Maids officious round their Mistress wait  Then all dispersing various Tasks attend  The Queen and Goddess to the Prince ascend  Full in her  Paris'  Sight the Queen of Love  Had plac'd the beauteous Progeny of  Jove  Where as he view'd her Charms she turn'd away  Her glowing Eyes and thus began to say  Is this the Chief who lost to Sense of Shame  Late fled the Field and yet survives his Fame  Oh hadst thou dy'd beneath the righteous Sword  Of that brave Man whom once I call'd my Lord  The Boaster  Paris  oft' desir'd the Day  With  Sparta  's King to meet in single Fray  Go now once more thy Rival's Rage excite  Provoke  Atrides  and renew the Fight  Yet  Helen  bids thee stay lest thou unskill'd  Should'st fall an easy Conquest on the Field  The Prince replies Ah cease divinely fair  Nor add Reproaches to the Wounds I bear  This Day the Foe prevail'd by  Pallas'  Pow'r  We yet may vanquish in a happier Hour  There want not Gods to favour us above  But let the Business of our Life be Love  These softer Moments let Delights employ  And kind Embraces snatch the hasty Joy  Not thus I lov'd thee when from  Sparta  's Shore  My forc'd my willing Heav'nly Prize I bore  When first entranc'd in  Cranaë  's Isle I lay  Mix'd with thy Soul and all dissolv'd away  Thus having spoke th' enamour'd  Phrygian  Boy  Rush'd to the Bed impatient for the Joy  Him  Helen  follow'd slow with bashful Charms  And clasp'd the blooming Hero in her Arms  While these to Love's delicious Rapture yield  The stern  Atrides  rages round the Field  So some fell Lion whom the Woods obey  Roars thro' the Desart and demands his Prey  Paris  he seeks impatient to destroy  But seeks in vain along the Troops of  Troy  Ev'n those had yielded to a Foe so brave  The recreant Warrior hateful as the Grave  Then speaking thus the King of Kings arose  Ye  Trojans Dardans  all our gen'rous Foes  Hear and attest From Heav'n with Conquest crown'd  Our Brother's Arms the just Success have found  Be therefore now the  Spartan  Wealth restor'd  Let  Argive Helen  own her lawful Lord  Th' appointed Fine let  Ilion  justly pay  And Age to Age record this signal Day  He ceas'd His Army's just Applauses rise  And the long Shout runs ecchoing thro' the Skies  OBSERVATIONS ON THE Third Book  OBSERVATIONS ON THE THIRD BOOK  OF all the Books of the  Iliad  there is scarce any more pleasing than the Third It may be divided into five Parts each of which has a Beauty different from the other The first contains what pass'd before the two Armies and the Proposal of the Combate between  Paris  and  Menelaus  The Attention and Suspense of these mighty Hosts which were just upon the Point of joining Battel and the lofty manner of offering and accepting this important and unexpected Challenge have something in them wonderfully pompous and of an amusing Solemnity The second Part which describes the Behaviour of  Helena  in this Juncture her Conference with the old King and his Counsellors with the Review of the Heroes from the Battelments is an Episode entirely of another sort which excels in the Natural and Pathetick The third consists of the Ceremonies of the Oath on both sides and the Preliminaries to the Combate with the beautiful Retreat of  Priam  who in the Tenderness of a Parent withdraws from the sight of the Duel These Particulars detain the Reader in Expectation and heighten his Impatience for the Fight itself The fourth is the Description of the Duel an exact Piece of Painting where we see every Attitude Motion and Action of the Combatants particularly and distinctly and which concludes with a surprizing Propriety in the rescue of  Paris  by  Venus  The Machine of  that Goddess which makes the fifth Part and whose End is to reconcile  Paris  and  Helena  is admirable in every Circumstance The Remonstrance she holds with the Goddess the Reluctance with which she obeys her the Reproaches she casts upon  Paris  and the Flattery and Courtship with which he so soon wins her over to him  Helen  the main Cause of this War was not to be made an odious Character She is drawn by this great Master with the finest Strokes as a frail but not an abandon'd Creature She has perpetual Struggles of Virtue on the one side and Softnesses which overcome them on the other Our Author has been remarkably careful to tell us this whenever he but slightly names her in the foregoing Part of his Work she is represented at the same time as repentant and it is thus we see her at large at her first Appearance in the present Book which is one of the shortest of the whole  Iliad  but in recompence has Beauties almost in every Line and most of them so obvious that to acknowledge them we need only to read them  I  VERSE  With Shouts the  Trojans  The Book begins with a fine Opposition of the Noise of the  Trojan  Army to the Silence of the  Graecians  It was but natural to imagine this since the former was compos'd of many different Nations of various Languages and Strangers to each other the latter were more united in their Neighbourhood and under Leaders of the same Country But as this Observation seems particularly insisted upon by our Author for he uses it again in the fourth Book ℣ so he had a farther Reason for it  Plutarch  in his Treatise of reading the Poets remarks upon this Distinction as a particular Credit to the military Discipline of the  Greeks  And several ancient Authors tell us it was the Manner of the  Barbarians  to encounter with Shouts and Outcries as it continues to this Day the Custom of the Eastern Nations Perhaps these Clamours were only to encourage their Men instead of martial Instruments I think Sir  Walter Raleigh  says there never was a People but made use of some sort of Musick in Battel  Homer  never  mentions any in the  Greek  or  Trojan  Armies and it is scarce to be imagined he would omit a Circumstance so poetical without some particular Reason The Verb  which the modern  Greeks  have since appropriated to the sound of a Trumpet is used indifferently in our Author for other Sounds as for Thunder in the the  st Iliad  ℣  He once names the Trumpet  in a  Simile  upon which  Eustathius  and  Didymus  observe that the use of it was known in the Poet's Time but not in that of the  Trojan  War And hence we may infer that  Homer  was particularly careful not to confound the Manners of the Times he wrote of with those of the Times he liv'd in  II  VERSE  The Cranes embody'd fly    If Wit has been truly describ'd to be a Similitude in Ideas and is more excellent as that Similitude is more surprizing there cannot be a truer kind of Wit than what is shewn in apt Comparisons especially when composed of such Subjects as having the least Relation to each other in general have yet some Particular that agrees exactly Of this Nature is the Simile of the  Cranes  to the  Trojan  Army where the Fancy of  Homer  flew to the remotest Part of the World for an Image which no Reader could have expected But it is no less exact than surprizing The Likeness consists in two Points the  Noise  and the  Order  the latter is so observable as to have given some of the Ancients occasion to imagine the embatteling of an Army was first learn'd from the close manner of Flight of these Birds But this Part of the Simile not being directly express'd by the Author has been overlook'd by some of the Commentators It may be remark'd that  Homer  has generally a wonderful Closeness in all the Particulars of his Comparisons notwithstanding he takes a Liberty in his Expression of them He seems so secure of the main Likeness that he makes no scruple to play with the Circumstances sometimes by transposing the Order of them sometimes by superadding them and sometimes as in this Place by neglecting them in such a manner as to leave the Reader to supply them himself For the present  Comparison it has been taken by  Virgil  in the tenth Book and apply'd to the Clamours of Soldiers in the same manner  Quales sub nubibus atris  Strymoniae dant signa grues atque aethera tranant  Cum sonitu fugiuntque Notos clamore secundo  III  VERSE  The beauteous  Paris  came In Form a God    This is meant by the Epithet  as has been said in the  th  Note on the first Book The Picture here given of  Paris  's Air and Dress is exactly correspondent to his Character you see him endeavouring to mix the fine Gentleman with the Warriour and this Idea of him  Homer  takes care to keep up by describing him not without the same Regard when he is arming to encounter  Menelaus  afterwards in a close Fight as he shews here where he is but preluding and flourishing in the Gaiety of his Heart And when he tells us in that Place that he was in danger of being strangled by the Strap of his Helmet he takes notice that it was    embroider'd  IV  VERSE  So joys a Lion if the branching Deer Or Mountain Goat    The old Scholiasts refining on this Simile will have it that  Paris  is compar'd to a Goat on account of his Incontinence and to a Stag for his Cowardice To this last they make an Addition which is very ludicrous that he is also liken'd to a Deer for his  Skill in Musick  and cite  Aristotle  to prove that Animal delights in Harmony which Opinion is alluded to by Mr  Waller  in these Lines  Here Love takes stand and while she charms the Ear  Empties his Quiver on the list'ning Deer  But upon the whole it is whimsical to imagine this Comparison consists in any thing more than the Joy which  Menelaus  conceiv'd at the sight of his Rival in the hopes of destroying  him It is equally an Injustice to  Paris  to abuse him for understanding Musick and to represent his Retreat as purely the Effect of Fear which proceeded from his Sense of Guilt with respect to the particular Person of  Menelaus  He appear'd at the Head of the Army to challenge the boldest of the Enemy Nor is his Character elsewhere in the  Iliad  by any means that of a Coward  Hector  at the end of the sixth Book confesses that no Man could justly reproach him as such Nor is he represented so by  Ovid  who copy'd  Homer  very closely in the end of his Epistle to  Helen  The Moral of  Homer  is much finer A brave Mind however blinded with Passion is sensible of Remorse as soon as the injur'd Object presents itself and  Paris  never behaves himself ill in War but when his Spirits are depress'd by the Consciousness of an Injustice This also will account for the seeming Incongruity of  Homer  in this Passage who as they would have us think paints him a shameful Coward at the same time that he is perpetually calling him  the divine Paris  and  Paris like a God  What he says immediately afterwards in answer to  Hector  's Reproof will make this yet more clear  V  VERSE  As when a Shepherd    This Comparison of the Serpent is finely imitated by  Virgil  in the second  Aeneid  Improvisum aspris veluti qui sentibus anguem  Pressit humi nitens trepidus{que} repentè refugit  Attollentem iras caerula colla tumentem  Haud secus Androgeus visu tremefaclus abibat  But it may be said to the Praise of  Virgil  that he has apply'd it upon an Occasion where it has an additional Beauty  Paris  upon the sight of  Menelaus  's Approach is compar'd to a Traveller who sees a Snake shoot on a sudden towards him But the Surprize and Danger of  Androgeus  is more lively being just in the reach of his Enemies before he perceiv'd it and the Circumstance of the Serpent's rouzing his Crest which brightens with Anger finely images the shining of  their Arms in the Nighttime as they were just lifted up to destroy him  Scaliger  criticizes on the needless Repetition in the Words  and  which is avoided in the Translation But it must be observ'd in general that  little Exactnesses  are what we should not look for in  Homer  the Genius of his Age was too incorrect and his own too fiery to regard them  VI  VERSE  As Godlike  Hector  This is the first Place of the Poem where  Hector  makes a figure and here it seems proper to give an Idea of his Character since if he is not the chief Heroe of the  Iliad  he is at least the most amiable There are several Reasons which render  Hector  a favorite Character with every Reader some of which shall here be offer'd The chief Moral of  Homer  was to expose the ill Effects of Discord the  Greeks  were to be shewn disunited and to render that Disunion the more probable he has designedly given them  mixt  Characters The  Trojans  on the other hand were to be represented making all Advantages of the others Disagreement which they could not do without a strict Union among themselves  Hector  therefore who commanded them must be endu'd with all such Qualifications as tended to the Preservation of it as  Achilles  with such as promoted the contrary The one stands in Contraste to the other an accomplish'd Character of Valour unruffled by Rage and Anger and uniting his People by his Prudence and Example  Hector  has also a Foil to set him off in his own Family we are perpetually opposing in our Minds the Incontinence of  Paris  who exposes his Country to the Temperance of  Hector  who protects it And indeed it is this Love of his Country which appears his principal Passion and the Motive of all his Actions He has no other Blemish than that he fights in an unjust Cause which  Homer  has yet been careful to tell us he would not do if his Opinion were followed But since he cannot prevail the Affection he bears to his Parents and Kindred and his desire of defending them incites him to do his utmost for their Safety We may add  that  Homer  having so many  Greeks  to celebrate makes them shine in their turns and singly in their several Books one succeeding in the Absence of another Whereas  Hector  appears in every Battel the Life and Soul of his Party and the constant Bulwark against every Enemy He stands against  Agamemnon  's Magnanimity  Diomed  's Bravery  Ajax  's Strength and  Achilles  's Fury There is besides an accidental Cause for our liking him from reading the Writers of the  Augustan  Age especially  Virgil  whose Favorite he grew more particularly from the time when the  Caesars  fancy'd to derive their Pedigree from  Troy  VII  VERSE  Unhappy  Paris  c    It may be observ'd in Honour of  Homer  's Judgment that the Words which  Hector  is made to speak here very strongly mark his Character They contain a warm Reproach of Cowardice and shew him to be touch'd with so high a Sense of Glory as to think Life insupportable without it His calling to mind the gallant Figure which  Paris  had made in his Amours to  Helen  and opposing to it the Image of his Flight from her Husband is a Sarcasm of the utmost Bitterness and Vivacity After he has named that Action of the Rape the Cause of so many Mischiefs his insisting upon it in so many broken Periods those disjointed Shortnesses of Speech      That hasty manner of Expression without the Connexion of Particles is as  Eustathius  remarks extreamly natural to a Man in Anger who thinks he can never vent himself too soon That Contempt of outward Shew of the Gracefulness of Person and of the Accomplishments of a Courtly Life is what corresponds very well with the Warlike Temper of  Hector  and these Verses have therefore a Beauty here which they want in  Horace  however admirably he has translated them in the Ode of  Nireus's Prophecy  Nequicquam Veneris praesidio ferox  Pectes caesariem grataque foeminis  Imbelli citharâ carmina divides  c  VIII  VERSE  And both her Warlike Lords    The Original is    The Spouse of Martial Men  I wonder why Madam  Dacier  chose to turn it  Alliée à tant de braves guerriers  since it so naturally refers to  Theseus  and  Menelaus  the former Husbands of  Helena  IX  VERSE  Thy curling Tresses and thy silver Lyre    It is ingeniously remark'd by  Dacier  that  Homer  who celebrates the  Greeks  for their long Hair  and  Achilles  for his Skill on the Harp makes  Hector  in this Place object them both to  Paris  The  Greeks  nourished their Hair to appear more dreadful to the Enemy and  Paris  to please the Eyes of Women  Achilles  sung to his Harp the Acts of Heroes and  Paris  the Amours of Lovers The same reason which makes  Hector  here displeas'd at them made  Alexander  afterwards refuse to see this Lyre of  Paris  when offer'd to be shewn to him as  Plutarch  relates the Story in his Oration of the Fortune of  Alexander  X  VERSE  One avenging Blow    It is in the  Greek You had been clad in a Coat of Stone Giphanius  would have it to mean stoned to death on the account of his Adultery But this does not appear to have been the Punishment of that Crime among the  Phrygians  It seems rather to signify destroy'd by the Fury of the People for the War he had brought upon them or perhaps may imply no more than being laid in his Grave under a Monument of Stones but the former being the stronger Sense is here followed  XI  VERSE  'Tis just my Brother    This Speech is a farther opening of the true Character of  Paris  He is a Master of Civility no less wellbred to his own Sex than courtly to the other The Reproof of  Hector  was of a severe Nature yet he receives it as from a Brother and a Friend with Candour and Modesty This Answer is remarkable for its fine Address he gives the Heroe a decent and agreeable Reproof for having too rashly depreciated the Gifts of Nature He allows the Quality of Courage its utmost due but desires the same Justice to those softer Accomplishments which he lets him know are no less the Favour of Heaven Then he removes from himself the Charge of want of Valour by proposing the single Combate with the very Man he had just declined to engage which having shewn him void of any Malevolence to his Rival on the one hand he now proves himself free from the Imputation of Cowardice on the other  Homer  draws him as we have seen soft of Speech the natural Quality of an amorous Temper vainly gay in War as well as Love with a Spirit that can be surprized and recollected that can receive Impressions of Shame or Apprehension on the one side or of Generosity and Courage on the other the usual Disposition of easy and courteous Minds which are most subject to the Rule of Fancy and Passion Upon the whole this is no worse than the Picture of a  gentle Knight  and one might fancy the Heroes of the modern Romance were form'd upon the Model of  Paris  XII  VERSE  Much fam'd for gen'rous Steeds for Beauty more    The Original is  Perhaps this Line is translated too close to the Letter and the Epithets might have been omitted But there are some Traits and Particularities of this Nature which methinks preserve to the Reader the Air of  Homer  At least the latter of these Circumstances that  Greece was eminent  for beautiful Women  seems not improper to be mention'd by him who had rais'd a War on the account of a  Grecian Beauty  XIII  VERSE  The Challenge  Hector  heard with Joy    Hector stays not to reply to his Brother but runs away with the Challenge immediately He looks upon all the  Trojans  as disgrac'd by the late Flight of  Paris  and thinks not a Moment is to be lost to regain the Honour of his Country The Activity he shews in all this Affair wonderfully agrees with the Spirit of a Soldier  XIV  VERSE  Hear all ye  Trojan  all ye  Grecian  Bands    It has been ask'd how the different Nations could understand one another in these Conferences since we have no mention in  Homer  of any Interpreter between them He who was so very particular in the most minute Points can hardly be thought to have been negligent in this Some Reasons may be offer'd that they both spoke the same Language for the  Trojans  as may be seen in  Dion Halic lib  were of  Grecian  Extraction originally  Dardanus  the first of their Kings was born in  Arcadia  and even their Names were generally  Greek  as  Hector Anchises Andromache Astyanax c  Of the last of these in particular  Homer  gives us a Derivation which is purely  Greek  in  Il  ℣ But however it be this is no more as  Dacier  somewhere observes than the just Privilege of Poetry  Aeneas  and  Turnus  understand each other in  Virgil  and the Language of the Poet is suppos'd to be universally intelligible not only between different Countries but between Earth and Heaven itself  XV  VERSE  Me too ye Warriors hear  c  We may observe what care  Homer  takes to give every one his proper Character and how this Speech of  Menelaus  is adapted to  the  Laconick  which the better to comprehend we may remember there are in  Homer  three Speakers of different Characters agreeable to the three different kinds of Eloquence These we may compare with each other in one Instance supposing them all to use the same Heads and in the same Order  The Materials of the Speech are The manifesting his Grief for the War with the hopes that it is in his Power to end it an Acceptance of the propos'd Challenge an Account of the Ceremonies to be us'd in the League and a Proposal of a proper Caution to secure it  Now had  Nestor  these Materials to work upon he would probably have begun with a Relation of all the Troubles of the nine Year's Siege which he hop'd he might now bring to an end he would court their Benevolence and good Wishes for his Prosperity with all the Figures of Amplification while he accepted the Challenge he would have given an Example to prove that the single Combate was a wise gallant and gentle way of ending the War practis'd by their Fathers in the Description of the Rites he would be exceeding particular and when he chose to demand the Sanction of  Priam  rather than of his Sons he would place in Opposition on one side the Son's Action which began the War and on the other the Impressions of Concern or Repentance which it must by this time have made in the Father's Mind whose Wisdom he would undoubtedly extol as the effect of his Age All this he would have expatiated upon with Connexions of the Discourses in the most evident manner and the most easy gliding undisobliging Transitions The Effect would be that the People would hear him with Pleasure  Had it been  Ulysses  who was to make the Speech he would have mention'd a few of their most affecting Calamities in a pathetick Air then have undertaken the Fight with testifying such a chearful Joy as should have won the Hearts of the Soldiers to follow him to the Field without being desired He would have been exceeding cautious in wording the Conditions and solemn rather than particular in speaking of the Rites which he would only insist on as an Opportunity to exhort both sides to a fear of the Gods and a strict regard  of Justice He would have remonstrated the use of sending for  Priam  and because no Caution could be too much have demanded his Sons to be bound with him For a Conclusion he would have us'd some noble Sentiment agreeable to a Heroe and it may be have enforc'd it with some inspirited Action In all this you would have known that the Discourse hung together but its Fire would not always suffer it to be seen in cooler Transitions which when they are too nicely laid open may conduct the Reader but never carry him away The People would hear him with Emotion  These Materials being given to  Menelaus  he but just mentions their Troubles and his Satisfaction in the Prospect of ending them shortens the Proposals says a Sacrifice is necessary requires  Priam  's Presence to confirm the Conditions refuses his Sons with a Resentment of that Injury he suffer'd by them and concludes with a Reason for his Choice from the Praise of Age with a short Gravity and the Air of an Apothegm This he puts in order without any more Transition than what a single Conjunction affords And the effect of the Discourse is that the People are instructed by it in what is to be done  XVI  VERSE  Two Lambs devoted    The  Trojans  says the old Scholiast were required to sacrifice two Lambs one Male of a white Colour to the  Sun  and one Female and black to the  Earth  as the  Sun  is Father of Light and the  Earth  the Mother and Nurse of Men The  Greeks  were to offer a third to  Jupiter  perhaps to  Jupiter Xenius  because the  Trojans  had broken the Laws of Hospitality on which account we find  Menelaus  afterwards invoking him in the Combate with  Paris  That these were the Powers to which they sacrific'd appears by their being attested by Name in the Oath ℣  XVII  VERSE  The Nations hear with rising Hopes possest    It seem'd no more than what the Reader would reasonably  expect in the Narration of this long War that a Period might have been put to it by the single danger of the Parties chiefly concern'd  Paris  and  Menelaus Homer  has therefore taken care toward the beginning of his Poem to obviate that Objection and contriv'd such a Method to render this Combate of no effect as should naturally make way for all the ensuing Battels without any future Prospect of a Determination but by the Sword It is farther worth observing in what manner he has improved into Poetry the common History of this Action if as one may imagine it was the same with that we have in the second Book of  Dictys Cretensis When  Paris says he  being wounded by the Spear of  Menelaus  fell to the Ground just as his Adversary was rushing upon him with his Sword he was shot by an Arrow from  Pandarus  which prevented his Revenge in the Moment he was going to take it Immediately on the sight of this perfidious Action the  Greeks  rose in a Tumult the  Trojans  rising at the same time came on and rescued  Paris  from his Enemy Homer  has with great Art and Invention mingled all this with the Marvellous and rais'd it in the Air of Fable The  Goddess of Love  rescues her Favourite  Jupiter  debates whether or no the War shall end by the Defeat of  Paris Juno  is for the Continuance of it  Minerva  incites  Pandarus  to break the Truce who thereupon shoots at  Menelaus  This heightens the Grandeur of the Action without destroying the Verisimilitude diversifies the Poem and exhibits a fine Moral that whatever seems in the World the Effect of common Causes is really owing to the Decree and Disposition of the Gods  XVIII  VERSE  Mean while to beauteous  Helen  c    The following Part where we have the first sight of  Helena  is what I cannot think inferior to any in the Poem The Reader has naturally an Aversion to this pernicious Beauty and is apt enough to wonder at the  Greeks  for endeavouring to recover her at such an Expence But her amiable Behaviour here the secret Wishes that rise in favour of her rightful  Lord her Tenderness for her Parents and Relations the Relentings of her Soul for the Mischiefs her Beauty had been the Cause of the Confusion she appears in the veiling her Face and dropping a Tear are Particulars so beautifully natural as to make every Reader no less than  Menelaus  himself inclin'd to forgive her at least if not to love her We are afterwards confirm'd in this Partiality by the Sentiment of the old Counsellors upon the sight of her which one would think  Homer  put into their Mouths with that very view We excuse her no more than  Priam  does himself and all those do who felt the Calamities she occasion'd And this Regard for her is heighten'd by all she says herself in which there is scarce a word that is not big with Repentance and Goodnature  XIX  VERSE  The golden Web her own sad Story crown'd    This is a very agreeable Fiction to represent  Helena  weaving in a large Veil or Piece of Tapestry the Story of the  Trojan  War One would think that  Homer  inherited this Veil and that his  Iliad  is only an Explication of that admirable Piece of Art  Dacier  XX  VERSE  Like Grashoppers    This is one of the justest and most natural Images in the World tho' there have been Criticks of so little Taste as to object to it as a mean one The Garrulity so common to old Men their Delight in Associating with each other the feeble Sound of their Voices the Pleasure they take in a Sunshiny Day the Effects of Decay in their Chillness Leanness and Scarcity of Blood are all Circumstances exactly parallel'd in this Comparison To make it yet more proper to the old Men of  Troy Faistathius  has observ'd that  Homer  found a Hint for this Simile in the  Trojan  Story where  Tithou  was feign'd to have been transform'd into a Grashopper in his old Age perhaps on account of his being so exhausted by Years as to have nothing left him but Voice  Spondanus  wonders that  Homer  should apply  to Grashoppers  a  sweet Voice  whereas that of these Animals is harsh and untuneful and he is contented to come off with a very poor Evasion of  Homero fingere quidlibet fas fuit  But  Hesychius  rightly observes that  signifies    tener  or  gracilis  as well as  suavis  The Sense is certainly much better and the Simile more truly preserv'd by this Interpretation which is here follow'd in translating it  feeble  However it may be alledg'd in Defence of the common Versions and of Madam  Dacier  's who has turn'd it  Harmonieuse  that tho'  Virgil  gives the Epithet  raucae  to  Cicadae  yet the  Greek  Poets frequently describe the Grashopper as a musical Creature particularly  Anacreon  and  Theocritus Idyl  where a Shepherd praises another's singing by telling him  It is remarkable that Mr  Hobbes  has omitted this beautiful Simile  XXI  VERSE  These when the  Spartan  Fair approach'd    Madam  Dacier  is of Opinion there was never a greater Panegyrick upon  Beauty  than what  Homer  has found the Art to give it in this Place An Assembly of venerable old Counsellors who had suffer'd all the Calamities of a tedious War and were consulting upon the Methods to put a Conclusion to it seeing the only Cause of it approaching towards them are struck with her Charms and cry out  No wonder  c Nevertheless they afterwards recollect themselves and conclude to part with her for the publick Safety If  Homer  had carry'd these old Mens Admiration any farther he had been guilty of outraging Nature and offending against Probability The Old are capable of being touch'd with Beauty by the Eye but Age secures them from the Tyranny of Passion and the Effect is but transitory for Prudence soon regains its Dominion over them  Homer  always goes as far as he should but constantly stops just where he ought  Dacier  The same Writer compares to this the Speech of  Holosernes  's Soldiers on the sight of  Judith Ch  ℣ But tho'  there be a Resemblance in the Words the Beauty is no way parallel the Grace of this consisting in the Age and Character of those who speak it There is something very gallant upon the Beauty of  Helen  in one of  Lucian  's Dialogues  Mercury  shews  Menippus  the Sculls of several fine Women and when the Philosopher is moralizing upon that of  Helen Was it for this a thousand Ships sail'd from  Greece  so many brave Men dy'd and so many Cities were destroy'd My Friend  says  Mercury    'tis true but what you behold is only her  Scull  bad you seen her  Face  you would have been of their Opinion and have done the very same thing  XXII  VERSE  The good old  Priam  The Character of a benevolent old Man is very well preserv'd in  Priam  's Behaviour to  Helena  Upon the Confusion he observes her in he encourages her by attributing the Misfortunes of the War to the Gods alone and not to her Fault This Sentiment is also very agreeable to the natural Piety of old Age those who have had the longest Experience of human Accidents and Events being most inclin'd to ascribe the Disposal of all things to the Will of Heaven It is this Piety that renders  Priam  a Favourite of  Jupiter  as we find in the beginning of the fourth Book which for some time delays the Destruction of  Troy  while his soft Nature and Indulgence for his Children makes him continue a War which ruines him These are the two principal Points of  Priam  's Character tho' there are several lesser Particularities among which we may observe the Curiosity and inquisitive Humour of old Age which gives occasion to the following Episode  XXIII  VERSE  And say what Chief is he    This View of the  Grecian  Leaders from the Walls of  Troy  is justly look'd upon as an Episode of great Beauty as well as a Masterpiece of Conduct in  Homer  who by this means acquaints the Readers with the Figure and Qualifications of each Heroe in a  more lively and agreeable manner Several great Poets have been engag'd by the Beauty of this Passage to an Imitation of it In the seventh Book of  Statius Phorbas  standing with  Antigone  on the Tower of  Thebes  shews her the Forces as they were drawn up and describes their Commanders who were neighbouring Princes of  Boeotia  It is also imitated by  Tasso  in his third Book where  Erminia  from the Walls of  Jerusalem  points out the chief Warriours to the King tho' the latter part is perhaps copied too closely and minutely for he describes  Godfrey  to be of a Port that bespeaks him a Prince the next of somewhat a lower Stature a third renown'd for his Wisdom and then another is distinguish'd by the Largeness of his Chest tnd Breadth of his Shoulders Which are not only the very Particulars but in the very Order of  Homer  's  But however this manner of Introduction has been admir'd there have not been wanting some Exceptions to a Particular or two  Scaliger  asks how it happens that  Priam  after nine Years Siege should be yet unacquainted with the Faces of the  Grecian  Leaders This was an old Cavil as appears by the  Scholia  that pass under the Name of  Didymus  where it is very well answer'd that  Homer  has just before taken care to tell us the Heroes had put off their Armour on this occasion of the Truce which had conceal'd their Persons 'till now Others have objected to  Priam  's not knowing  Ulysses  who as it appears afterwards had been at  Troy  on an Embassy The answer is that this might happen either from the Dimness of  Priam  's Sight or Defect of his Memory or from the Change of  Ulysses  's Features since that time  XXIV  VERSE  Before thy Presence    Helen is so overwhelmed with Grief and Shame that she is unable to give a direct Answer to  Priam  without first humbling herself before him acknowledging her Crime and testifying her Repentance And she no sooner answers by naming  Agamemnon  but her Sorrows renew at the Name  He was once my Brother but I am now a Wretch unworthy to call him so  XXV  VERSE  Great in the War and great in Arts of Sway    This was the Verse which  Alexander  the Great prefer'd to all others in  Homer  and which he propos'd as the Pattern of his own Actions as including whatever can be desired in a Prince  Plut Orat de fort Alex    XXVI  VERSE  Extoll'd the happy Prince    It was very natural for  Priam  on this occasion to compare the declining Condition of his Kingdom with the flourishing State of  Agamemnon  's and to oppose his own Misery who had lost most of his Sons and his bravest Warriours to the Felicity of the other in being yet Master of so gallant an Army After this the Humour of old Age breaks out in the Narration of what Armies he had formerly seen and bore a Part in the Command of as well as what Feats of Valour he had then performed Besides which this Praise of the  Greeks  from the Mouth of an Enemy was no small Encomium of  Homer  's Countrymen  XXVII  VERSE  From Rank to Rank he moves    The Vigilance and Inspection of  Ulysses  were very proper Marks to distinguish him and agree with his Character of a wise Man no less than the Grandeur and Majesty before described with that of  Agamemnon  as the supreme Ruler whereas we find  Ajax  afterwards taken notice of only for his Bulk as a heavy Heroe without Parts or Authority This Decorum is observable  XXVIII  VERSE  I knew their Persons  c  In this View of the Leaders of the Army it had been an Oversight in  Homer  to have taken no Notice of  Menelaus  who was not only one  of the Principal of them but was immediately to engage the Observation of the Reader in the single Combate On the other hand it had been a high Indecorum to have made  Helena  speak of him He has therefore put his Praises into the Mouth of  Antenor  which was also a more artful way than to have presented him to the Eye of  Priam  in the same manner with the rest It appears from hence what a Regard he has had both to Decency and Variety in the Conduct of his Poem This Passage concerning the different Eloquence of  Menelaus  and  Ulysses  is inexpressibly just and beautiful The close  Laconick  Conciseness of the one is finely opposite to the copious vehement and penetrating Oratory of the other which is so exquisitely describ'd in the Simile of the Snow falling fast and sinking deep For it is in this the Beauty of the Comparison consists according to  Quintilian l    c    In Ulysse facundiam magnitudinem junxit cui orationem nivibus hybernis  copiâ  verborum atque  impetu  parem tribuit  We may set in the same Light with these the Character of  Nestor  's Eloquence which consisted in Softness and Persuasiveness and is therefore in Contradistinction to this of  Ulysses  compar'd to Honey which drops gently and slowly a manner of Speech extremely natural to a benevolent old Man such as  Nestor  is represented  Ausonius  has elegantly distinguish'd these three kinds of Oratory in the following Verses  Dulcem  in  paucis  ut Plisthenidem  Et  torrentem  ceu Dulichii  Ningida  dicta  Et  mellitae  nectare vocis  Dulcia fatu verba canentem  Nestora regem  XXIX  VERSE  He spoke no more than just the thing he ought    Chapman in his Notes on this Place and on the second Book has described  Menelaus  as a Character of Ridicule and Simplicity He takes advantage from the word  here made  use of to interpret that of the  Shrillness  of his Voice which was apply'd to the  Acuteness  of his Sense He observes that this sort of Voice is a Mark of a Fool that  Menelaus  's coming to his Brother's Feast uninvited in the second Book has occasion'd a Proverb of Folly that the Excuse  Homer  himself makes for it because his Brother might forget to invite him thro' much Business is purely ironical that the Epithet  which is often apply'd to him should not be translated  warlike  but one who had  an Affectation of loving War  In short that he was a weak Prince play'd upon by others short in Speech and of a bad Pronunciation valiant only by fits and sometimes stumbling upon good Matter in his Speeches as may happen to the most slender Capacity This is one of the Mysteries which that Translator boasts to have found in  Homer  But as it is no way consistent with the Art of the Poet to draw the Person in whose behalf he engages the World in such a manner as no Regard should be conceiv'd for him we must endeavour to rescue him from this Misrepresentation First then the present Passage is taken by Antiquity in general to be apply'd not to his Pronunciation but his Eloquence So  Ausonius  in the foregoing Citation and  Cicero de claris Oratoribus Menelaum ipsum dulcem illum quidem tradit Homerus sed pauca loquentem  And  Quintilian l    c    Homerus brevem cum animi jucunditate propriam    id enim est  non errare verbis  carentem supervacuis Eloquentiam Menelao dedit  c Secondly tho' his coming uninvited may have occasion'd a jesting Proverb it may naturally be accounted for on the Principle of  brotherly Love  which so visibly characterises both him and  Agamemnon  throughout the Poem Thirdly  may import a Love of War but not an ungrounded Affectation Upon the whole his Character is by no means contemptible tho' not of the most shining Nature He is called indeed in the  th Iliad    a soft Warrior  or one whose Strength is of the second rate and so his Brother thought him when he prefer'd nine before him to fight with  Hector  in the  th  Book But on the other hand his Courage gives him a considerable Figure in conquering  Paris  defending the Body of  Patroclus  rescuing  Ulysses  wounding  Helenus  killing  Euphorbus  c He is full of Resentment for his private Injuries which brings him to the War with a Spirit of Revenge in the second Book makes him blaspheme  Jupiter  in the third when  Paris  escapes him and curse the  Grecians  in the seventh when they hesitate to accept  Hector  's Challenge But this also is qualify'd with a Compassion for those who suffer in his Cause which he every where manifests upon proper Occasions and with an Industry to gratify others as when he obeys  Ajax  in the seventeenth Book and goes upon his Errand to find  Antilochus  with some other Condescensions of the like nature Thus his Character is compos'd of Qualities which give him no uneasy Superiority over others while he wants their Assistance and mingled with such as make him amiable enough to obtain it  XXX  VERSE  His modest Eyes  c  This Behaviour of  Ulysses  is copy'd by  Ovid Met    Astitit atque oculos parum tellure moratos  Sustulit  What follows in the  Greek  translated word for word runs thus  He seem'd like a Fool you would have thought him in a Rage or a Madman  How oddly this would appear in our Language I appeal to those who have read  Ogilby  The whole Period means no more than to describe that Behaviour which is commonly remarkable in a modest and sensible Man who speaks in publick His Diffidence and Respect gives him at his first rising a sort of Confusion which is not indecent and which serves but the more to heighten the Surprize and Esteem of those who hear him  XXXI  VERSE  Perhaps their Swords    This is another Stroke of  Helen  's Concern The Sense of her Crime is perpetually afflicting her and awakes upon every occasion The  Lines that follow wherein  Homer  gives us to understand that  Castor  and  Pollux  were now dead are finely introduc'd and in the Spirit of Poetry the Muse is suppos'd to know every thing past and to come and to see things distant as well as present  XXXII  VERSE  Mean time the Heralds  c  It may not be unpleasing to the Reader to compare the Description of the Ceremonies of the League in the following Part with that of  Virgil  in the twelfth Book The Preparations the Procession of the Kings and their Congress are much more solemn and poetical in the latter the Oath and Adjurations are equally noble in both  XXXIII  VERSE  The curling Hair    We have here the whole Ceremonial of the solemn Oath as it was observ'd anciently by the Nations our Author describes I must take this Occasion of remarking that we might spare our selves the trouble of reading most Books of  Grecian Antiquities  only by being well vers'd in  Homer  They are generally bare Transcriptions of him but with this unnecessary Addition that after having quoted any thing in Verse they say the same over again in Prose The  Antiquitates Homericae  of  Feithius  may serve as an Instance of this What my Lord  Bacon  observes of Authors in general is particularly applicable to these of Antiquities that they write for Ostentation not for Instruction and that their Works are perpetual Repetitions  XXXIV  VERSE  And Age to Age record the signal Day    This seems the natural Sense of the Line and not as Madam  Dacier  renders it  the Tribute shall be paid to the Posterity of the  Greeks  for ever  I think she is single in that Explication the Majority of the Interpreters taking it to signify that the Victory  of the  Grecians  and this Pecuniary Acknowledgment  should be recorded to all Posterity  If it means any more than this at least it cannot come up to the Sense Madam  Dacier  gives it for a Nation put under perpetual Tribute is rather enslaved than received to Friendship and Alliance which are the Terms of  Agamemnon  's Speech It seems rather to be a Fine demanded as a Recompence for the Expences of the War which being made over to the  Greeks  should  remain to their Posterity for ever  that is to say which they should never be molested for or which should never be redemanded in any Age as a Case of Injury The Phrase is the same we use at this Day when any Purchase or Grant is at once made over to a Man  and his Heirs for ever  With this will agree the  Scholiast  's Note which tells us the Mulct was reported to have been half the Goods then in the besieg'd City  XXXV  VERSE  The Chief the tender Victims slew    One of the grand Objections which the Ignorance of some Moderns has rais'd against  Homer  is what they call a Defect in the Manners of his Heroes They are shock'd to find his Kings employ'd in such Offices as slaughtering of Beasts  c  But they forget that sacrificing was the most solemn Act of Religion and that Kings of old in most Nations were also ChiefPriests This among other Objections of the same kind the Reader may see answered in the Preface  XXXVI  VERSE  Give me great  Jove  Homer  puts a Prayer in the Mouth of  Menelaus  but none in  Paris  's  Menelaus  is the Person injur'd and innocent and may therefore apply to God for Justice but  Paris  who is the Criminal remains silent  Spondanus  XXXVII  VERSE  The brittle Steel unfaithful to his Hand Broke short  This Verse is cut to express the Thing it describes the snapping short of the Sword 'Tis the Observation of  Eustathius  on this Line of the Original that we do not only see the Action but imagine we hear the Sound of the breaking Sword in that of the Words  And that  Homer  design'd it may appear from his having twice put in the  which was a Letter unnecessary to cause this Harshness in the Verse As this Beauty could not be preserv'd in our Language it is endeavour'd in the Translation to supply it with something parallel  XXXVIII  VERSE  The Goddess softly shook  c  Venus  having convey'd  Paris  in Safety to his Chamber goes to  Helena  who had been Spectator of his Defeat in order to draw her to his Love The better to bring this about she first takes upon her the most proper Form in the World that of a favourite ServantMaid and awakens her Passion by representing to her the beautiful Figure of his Person Next assuming her own Shape she frightens her into a Complyance notwithstanding all the Struggles of  Shame Fear  and  Anger  which break out in her Speech to the Goddess This Machine is Allegorical and means no more than the Power of  Love  triumphing over all the Considerations of  Honour Ease  and  Safety  It has an excellent Effect as to the Poem in preserving still in some degree our good Opinion of  Helena  whom we look upon with Compassion as constrain'd by a superior Power and whose Speech tends to justify her in the Eye of the Reader  XXXIX  VERSE  She spoke and  Helen  's secret Soul was mov'd    Nothing is more fine than this the first Thought of  Paris  's  Beauty overcomes unawares to herself the Contempt she had that Moment conceiv'd of him upon his Overthrow This Motion is but natural and before she perceives the Deity When the Affections of a Woman have been thoroughly gained tho' they may be alienated for a while they soon return upon her Homer  knew  says Madam  Dacier    what a Woman is capable of who had once lov'd  XL  VERSE  For me to lawless Love no longer led I scorn the Coward    We have here another Branch of the Female Character which is to be ruled in their Attaches by  Success Helen  finding the Victory belong'd to  Menelaus  accuses herself secretly of having forsaken him for the other and immediately entertains a high Opinion of the Man she had once despised One may add that the Fair Sex are generally Admirers of Courage and naturally Friends to great Soldiers  Paris  was no Stranger to this Disposition in them and had formerly endeavour'd to give her that Opinion of himself as appears from her Reproach to him afterwards  XLI  VERSE  Should  Venus  leave thee ev'ry Charm must fly    This was the most dreadful of all Threats Loss of Beauty and of Reputation  Helen  who had been Proof to the personal Appearance of the Goddess and durst even reproach her with Bitterness just before yields to this and obeys all the Dictates of Love  XLII  VERSE  She turn'd away Her glowing Eyes    This Interview of the two Lovers plac'd opposite to each other and overlook'd by  Venus Paris  gazing on  Helena  she turning away her Eyes shining at once with Anger and Love are Particulars finely drawn and painted up to all the Life of Nature  Eustathius  imagines she look'd aside in the Consciousness  of her own Weakness as apprehending that the Beauty of  Paris  might cause her to relent Her bursting out into Passion and Reproaches while she is in this State of Mind is no ill Picture of Frailty  Venus  as Madam  Dacier  observes does not leave her and Fondness will immediately succeed to these Reproaches  XLIII  VERSE  Ah cease divinely fair    This Answer of  Paris  is the only one he could possibly have made with any Success in his Circumstance There was no other Method to reconcile her to him but that which is generally most powerful with the Sex and which  Homer  who was Learned every way here makes use of  XLIV  VERSE  When first entranc'd in  Cranaë  's Isle    It is in the Original  The true Sense of which is express'd in the Translation I cannot but take notice of a small Piece of  Pruderie  in Madam  Dacier  who is exceeding careful of  Helen  's Character She turns this Passage as if  Paris  had only her  Consent to be her Husband  in this Island  Pausanias  explains this Line in another manner and tells us it was here that  Paris  had first the Enjoyment of her that in Gratitude for his Happiness he built a Temple of  Venus Migonitis  the Mingler or Coupler and that the neighbouring Coast where it was erected was call'd  Migonian  from    à miscendo Paus Laconicis  XLV  VERSE  Not thus I lov'd thee    However  Homer  may be admired for his Conduct in this Passage I find a general Outcry against  Paris  on this Occasion  Plutarch  has led the way in his Treatise of reading Poets by remarking it as a most heinous Act of Incontinence in him to go to Bed to his Lady in the  Daytime  Among the Commentators the  most violent is the moral Expositor  Spondanus  who will not so much as allow him to say a civil thing to  Helen Mollis effoeminatus spurcus ille adulter nihil de libidine suâ imminutum dicit sed nunc magis eâ corripi quàm unquam aliàs ne quidem cùm primùm ea ipsi dedit    Latini ita rectè exprimunt  in re venereâ    in Insula  Cranaë  Cùm alioqui homines primi concubitûs soleant esse ardentiores  I could not deny the Reader the Diversion of this Remark nor  Spondauus  the Glory of his Zeal who was but two and twenty when it was written Madam  Dacier  is also very severe upon  Paris  but for a Reason more natural to a Lady She is of Opinion that the Passion of the Lover would scarce have been so excessive as he here describes it but for fear of losing his Mistress immediately as foreseeing the  Greeks  would demand her One may answer to this lively Remark that  Paris  having nothing to say for himself was obliged to testify an uncommon Ardour for his Lady at a time when Compliments were to pass instead of Reasons I hope to be excus'd if in Revenge for her Remark upon our Sex I observe upon the Behaviour of  Helen  throughout this Book which gives a pretty natural Picture of the Manners of theirs We see her first in Tears repentant cover'd with Confusion at the sight of  Priam  and secretly inclin'd to return to her former Spouse The Disgrace of  Paris  increases her Dislike of him she rails she reproaches she wishes his Death and after all is prevail'd upon by one kind Compliment and yields to his Embraces Methinks when this Lady's Observation and mine are laid together the best that can be made of them is to conclude that since both the Sexes have their Frailties it would be well for each to forgive the other  It is worth looking backward to observe the  Allegory  here carry'd on with respect to  Helena  who lives thro' this whole Book in a Whirl of Passions and is agitated by turns with Sentiments of Honour and Love The Goddesses made use of to cast the Appearance of Fable over the Story are  Iris  and  Venus  When  Helen  is call'd to the Tower to behold her former Friends  Iris  the Messenger of  Juno  the Goddess  of Honour is sent for her and when invited to the BedChamber of  Paris Venus  is to beckon her out of the Company The Forms they take to carry on these different Affairs are properly chosen the one assuming the Person of the Daughter of  Antenor  who press'd most for her being restor'd to  Menelaus  the other the Shape of an old Maid who was privy to the Intrigue with  Paris  from the beginning And in the Consequences as the one inspires the Love of her former Empire Friends and Country so the other instills the Dread of being cast off by all if she forsook her second Choice and causes the Return of her Tenderness to  Paris  But if she has a Struggle for  Honour  she is in a Bondage to  Love  which gives the Story its Turn that way and makes  Venus  oftner appear than  Iris  There is in one Place a Lover to be protected in another a LoveQuarrel to be made up in both which the Goddess is kindly officious She conveys  Paris  to  Troy  when he had escap'd the Enemy which may hint his Love for his Mistress that hurry'd him away to justify himself before her She softens and terrifies  Helen  in order to make up the Breach between them And even when that Affair is finished we do not find the Poet dismisses her from the Chamber whatever Privacies the Lovers had a mind to In which Circumstance he seems to draw aside the Veil of his Allegory and to let the Reader at last into this Meaning of it that the Goddess of Love has been all the while nothing more than the Passion of it  THE FOURTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD  The ARGUMENT  The Breach of the Truce and the first Battel  THE Gods deliberate in Council concerning the  Trojan  War They agree upon the Continuation of it and  Jupiter  sends down  Minerva  to break the Truce She persuades  Pandarus  to aim an Arrow at  Menelaus  who is wounded but cured by  Machaon  In the mean time some of the  Trojan  Troops attack the  Greeks Agamemnon  is distinguished in all the Parts of a good General he reviews the Troops and exhorts the Leaders some by Praises and others by Reproofs  Nestor  is particularly celebrated for his military Discipline The Battel joins and great Numbers are slain on both sides  The same Day continues thro' this as thro' the last Book as it does also thro' the two following and almost to the end of the seventh Book The  Scene  is wholly in the Field before  Troy  THE FOURTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD  AND now  Olympus'  shining Gates unfold  The Gods with  Jove  assume their Thrones of Gold  Immortal  Hebè  fresh with Bloom Divine  The golden Goblets crowns with Purple Wine  While the full Bowls flow round the Pow'rs employ  Their careful Eyes on longcontended  Troy  When  Jove  dispos'd to tempt  Saturnia  's Spleen  Thus wak'd the Fury of his partial Queen  Two Pow'rs Divine the Son of  Atreus  aid  Imperial  Juno  and the Martial Maid  But high in Heav'n they sit and gaze from far  The tame Spectators of his Deeds of War  Not thus fair  Venus  helps her favour'd Knight  The Queen of Pleasures shares the Toils of Fight  Each Danger wards and constant in her Care  Saves in the Moment of the last Despair  Her Act has rescu'd  Paris'  forfeit Life  Tho' great  Atrides  gain'd the glorious Strife  Then say ye Pow'rs what signal Issue waits  To crown this Deed and finish all the Fates  Shall Heav'n by Peace the bleeding Kingdoms spare  Or rowze the Furies and awake the War  Yet would the Gods for human Good provide  Atrides  soon might gain his beauteous Bride  Still  Priam  's Walls in peaceful Honours grow  And thro' his Gates the crowding Nations flow  Thus while he spoke the Queen of Heav'n enrag'd  And Queen of War in close Consult engag'd  Apart they sit their deep Designs employ  And meditate the future Woes of  Troy  Tho' secret Anger swell'd  Minerva  's Breast  The prudent Goddess yet her Wrath supprest  But  Juno  impotent of Passion broke  Her sullen Silence and with Fury spoke  Shall then O Tyrant of th' Aethereal Reign  My Schemes my Labours and my Hopes be vain  Have I for this shook  Ilion  with Alarms  Assembled Nations set two Worlds in Arms  To spread the War I flew from Shore to Shore  Th' Immortal Coursers scarce the Labour bore  At length ripe Vengeance o'er their Heads impends  But  Jove  himself the faithless Race defends  Loth as thou art to punish lawless Lust  Not all the Gods are partial and unjust  The Sire whose Thunder shakes the cloudy Skies  Sighs from his inmost Soul and thus replies  Oh lasting Rancour oh insatiate Hate  To  Phrygia  's Monarch and the  Phrygian  State  What high Offence has fir'd the Wife of  Jove  Can wretched Mortals harm the Pow'rs above  That  Troy  and  Troy  's whole Race thou woud'st confound  And yon' fair Structures level with the Ground  Haste leave the Skies fulfil thy stern Desire  Burst all her Gates and wrap her Walls in Fire  Let  Priam  bleed If yet thou thirst for more  Bleed all his Sons and  Ilion  float with Gore  To boundless Vengeance the wide Realm be giv'n  'Till vast Destruction glut the Queen of Heav'n  So let it be and  Jove  his Peace enjoy  When Heav'n no longer hears the Name of  Troy  But should this Arm prepare to wreak our Hate  On thy lov'd Realms whose Guilt demands their Fate  Presume not thou the lifted Bolt to stay  Remember  Troy  and give the Vengeance way  For know of all the num'rous Towns that rise  Beneath the rowling Sun and starry Skies  Which Gods have rais'd or Earthborn Men enjoy  None stands so dear to  Jove  as sacred  Troy  No Mortals merit more distinguish'd Grace  Than Godlike  Priam  or than  Priam  's Race  Still to our Name their Hecatombs expire  And Altars blaze with unextinguish'd Fire  At this the Goddess roll'd her radiant Eyes  Then on the Thund'rer fix'd them and replies  Three Towns are  Juno  's on the  Grecian  Plains  More dear than all th' extended Earth contains  Mycenae Argos  and the  Spartan  Wall  These thou may'st raze nor I forbid their Fall  'Tis not in me the Vengeance to remove  The Crime's sufficient that they share my Love  Of Pow'r superior why should I complain  Resent I may but must resent in vain  Yet some Distinction  Juno  might require  Sprung with thy self from one Celestial Sire  A Goddess born to share the Realms above  And styl'd the Consort of the thund'ring  Jove  Nor thou a Wife and Sister's Right deny  Let both consent and both by turns comply  So shall the Gods our joint Decrees obey  And Heav'n shall act as we direct the way  See ready  Pallas  waits thy high Commands  To raise in Arms the  Greek  and  Phrygian  Bands  Their sudden Friendship by her Arts may cease  And the proud  Trojans  first infringe the Peace  The Sire of Men and Monarch of the Sky  Th' Advice approv'd and bade  Minerva  fly  Dissolve the League and all her Arts employ  To make the Breach the faithless Act of  Troy  Fir'd with the Charge she headlong urg'd her Flight  And shot like Light'ning from  Olympus'  Height  As the red Comet from  Saturnius  sent  To fright the Nations with a dire Portent  A fatal Sign to Armies on the Plain  Or trembling Sailors on the wintry Main  With sweeping Glories glides along in Air  And shakes the Sparkles from its blazing Hair  Between both Armies thus in open Sight  Shot the bright Goddess in a Trial of Light  With Eyes erect the gazing Hosts admire  The Pow'r descending and the Heav'ns on Fire  The Gods they cry'd the Gods this Signal sent  And Fate now labours with some vast Event  Jove  seals the League or bloodier Scenes prepares  Jove  the great Arbiter of Peace and Wars  They said while  Pallas  thro' the  Trojan  Throng  In Shape a Mortal pass'd disguis'd along  Like bold  Laödocus  her Course she bent  Who from  Antenor  trac'd his high Descent  Amidst the Ranks  Lycaön  's Son she found  The warlike  Pandarus  for Strength renown'd  Whose Squadrons led from black  Aesepus'  Flood  With flaming Shields in martial Circle stood  To him the Goddess  Phrygian  can'st thou hear  A welltim'd Counsel with a willing Ear  What Praise were thine cou'd'st thou direct thy Dart  Amidst his Triumph to the  Spartan  's Heart  What Gifts from  Troy  from  Paris  wou'd'st thou gain  Thy Country's Foe the  Grecian  Glory slain  Then seize th' Occasion dare the mighty Deed  Aim at his Breast and may that Aim succeed  But first to speed the Shaft address thy Vow  To  Lycian Phoebus  with the Silver Bow  And swear the Firstlings of thy Flock to pay  On  Zelia  's Altars to the God of Day  He heard and madly at the Motion pleas'd  His polish'd Bow with hasty Rashness seiz'd  'Twas form'd of Horn and smooth'd with artful Toil  A Mountain Goat resign'd the shining Spoil  Who peirc'd long since beneath his Arrows bled  The stately Quarry on the Cliffs lay dead  And sixteen Palms his Brows large Honours spread  The Workman join'd and shap'd the bended Horns  And beaten Gold each taper Point adorns  This by the  Greeks  unseen the Warrior bends  Screen'd by the Shields of his surrounding Friends  There meditates the Mark and couching low  Fits the sharp Arrow to the wellstrung Bow  One from a hundred feather'd Deaths he chose  Fated to wound and Cause of future Woes  Then offers Vows with Hecatombs to crown  Apollo  's Altars in his Native Town  Now with full Force the yielding Horn he bends  Drawn to an Arch and joins the doubling Ends  Close to his Breast he strains the Nerve below  'Till the barb'd Point approach the circling Bow  Th' impatient Weapon whizzes on the Wing  Sounds the tough Horn and twangs the quiv'ring String  But Thee  Atrides  in that dang'rous Hour  The Gods forget not nor thy Guardian Pow'r  Pallas  assists and weaken'd in its Force  Diverts the Weapon from the destin'd Course  So from her Babe when Slumber seals his Eye  The watchful Mother wafts th' envenom'd Fly  Just where his Belt with golden Buckles join'd  Where Linen Folds the double Corslet lin'd  She turn'd the Shaft which hissing from above  Pass'd the broad Belt and thro' the Corslet drove  The Folds it pierc'd the plaited Linen tore  And raz'd the Skin and drew the Purple Gore  As when some stately Trappings are decreed  To grace a Monarch on his bounding Steed  A Nymph in  Caria  or  Meönia  bred  Stains the pure Iv'ry with a lively Red  With equal Lustre various Colours vie  The shining Whiteness and the  Tyrian  Dye  So great  Atrides  show'd thy sacred Blood  As down thy snowie Thigh distill'd the streaming Flood  With Horror seiz'd the King of Men descry'd  The Shaft infix'd and saw the gushing Tide  Nor less the  Spartan  fear'd before he found  The shining Barb appear above the Wound  Then with a Sigh that heav'd his manly Breast  The Royal Brother thus his Grief exprest  And grasp'd his Hand while all the  Greeks  around  With answering Sighs return'd the plaintive Sound  Oh dear as Life did I for this agree  The solemn Truce a fatal Truce to thee  Wert thou expos'd to all the hostile Train  To fight for  Greece  and conquer to be slain  The Race of  Trojans  in thy Ruin join  And Faith is scorn'd by all the perjur'd Line  Not thus our Vows confirm'd with Wine and Gore  Those Hands we plighted and those Oaths we swore  Shall all be vain When Heav'n's Revenge is slow  Jove  but prepares to strike the fiercer Blow  The Day shall come that great avenging Day  Which  Troy  's proud Glories in the Dust shall lay  When  Priam  's Pow'rs and  Priam  's self shall fall  And one prodigious Ruin swallow All  I see the God already from the Pole  Bare his red Arm and bid the Thunder roll  I see th' Eternal all his Fury shed  And shake his  Aegis  o'er their guilty Head  Such mighty Woes on perjur'd Princes wait  But thou alas deserv'st a happier Fate  Still must I mourn the Period of thy Days  And only mourn without my Share of Praise  Depriv'd of thee the heartless  Greeks  no more  Shall dream of Conquests on the hostile Shore  Troy  seiz'd of  Helen  and our Glory lost  Thy Bones shall moulder on a foreign Coast  While some proud  Trojan  thus insulting cries  And spurns the Dust where  Menelaus  lies  " Such are the Trophies  Greece  from  Ilion  brings  " And such the Conquests of her King of Kings  " Lo his proud Vessels scatter'd o'er the Main  " And unreveng'd his mighty Brother slain  Oh e're that dire Disgrace shall blast my Fame  O'erwhelm me Earth and hide a Monarch's Shame  He said A Leader's and a Brother's Fears  Possess his Soul which thus the  Spartan  chears  Let not thy Words the Warmth of  Greece  abate  The feeble Dart is guiltless of my Fate  Stiff with the rich embroider'd Work around  My vary'd Belt repell'd the flying Wound  To whom the King My Brother and my Friend  Thus always thus may Heav'n thy Life defend  Now seek some skilful Hand whose pow'rful Art  May stanch th' Effusion and extract the Dart  Herald be swift and bid  Machaon  bring  His speedy Succour to the  Spartan  King  Pierc'd with a winged Shaft the Deed of  Troy    The  Grecian  's Sorrow and the  Dardan  's Joy  With hasty Zeal the swift  Talthybius  flies  Thro' the thick Files he darts his searching Eyes  And finds  Machaön  where sublime he stands  In Arms encircled with his native Bands  Then thus  Machaön  to the King repair  His wounded Brother claims thy timely Care  Pierc'd by some  Lycian  or  Dardanian  Bow  A Grief to us a Triumph to the Foe  The heavy Tidings griev'd the Godlike Man  Swift to his Succour thro' the Ranks he ran  The dauntless King yet standing firm he found  And all the Chiefs in deep Concern around  Where to the steely Point the Reed was join'd  The Shaft he drew but left the Head behind  Strait the broad Belt with gay Embroid'ry grac'd  He loos'd the Corslet from his Breast unbrac'd  Then suck'd the Blood and Sov'reign Balm infus'd  Which  Chiron  gave and  Aesculapius  us'd  While round the Prince the  Greeks  employ their Care  The  Trojans  rush tumultuous to the War  Once more they glitter in refulgent Arms  Once more the Fields are fill'd with dire Alarms  Nor had you seen the King of Men appear  Confus'd unactive or surpriz'd with Fear  But fond of Glory with severe Delight  His beating Bosom claim'd the rising Fight  No longer with his warlike Steeds he stay'd  Or press'd the Car with polish'd Brass inlay'd  But left  Eurymedon  the Reins to guide  The fiery Coursers snorted at his side  On Foot thro' all the martial Ranks he moves  And these encourages and those reproves  Brave Men he cries to such who boldly dare  Urge their swift Steeds to face the coming War  Your ancient Valour on the Foes approve  Jove  is with  Greece  and let us trust in  Jove  'Tis not for us but guilty  Troy  to dread  Whose Crimes sit heavy on her perjur'd Head  Her Sons and Matrons  Greece  shall lead in Chains  And her dead Warriors strow the mournful

round the dreadful Plain  Prepar'd for Flight but doom'd to fly in vain  Confus'd and panting thus the hunted Deer  Falls as he flies a Victim to his Fear  Still must ye wait the Foes and still retire  'Till yon' tall Vessels blaze with  Trojan  Fire  Or trust ye  Jove  a valiant Foe shall chace  To save a trembling heartless dastard Race  This said he stalk'd with ample Strides along  To  Crete

in the Day of War  But let the Signal be this Moment giv'n  To mix in Fight is all I ask of Heav'n  The Field shall prove how Perjuries succeed  And Chains or Death avenge their impious Deed  Charm'd with this Heat the King his Course pursues  And next the Troops of either  Ajax  views  In one firm Orb the Bands were rang'd around  A Cloud of Heroes blacken'd all the Ground  Thus from the lofty Promontory's Brow  A Swain surveys the gath'ring Storm below  Slow from the Main the heavy Vapours rise  Spread in dim Streams and sail along the Skies  'Till black as Night the swelling Tempest shows  The Cloud condensing as the WestWind blows  He dreads th' impending Storm and drives his Flock  To the close Covert of an arching Rock  Such and so thick th' embattel'd Squadrons stood  With Spears

 And Earth's proud Tyrants low in Ashes laid  So spoke the Master of the martial Art  And touch'd with Transport great  Atrides'  Heart  Oh had'st thou Strength to match thy brave Desires  And Nerves to second what thy Soul inspires  But wasting Years that wither human Race  Exhaust thy Spirits and thy Arms unbrace  What once thou wert oh ever might'st thou be  And Age the Lot of any Chief but thee  Thus to th' experienc'd Prince  Atrides  cry'd  He shook his hoary Locks and thus reply'd  Well might I wish could Mortal Wish renew  That Strength which once in boiling Youth I knew  Such as I was when  Ereuthalion  slain  Beneath this Arm fell prostrate on the Plain  But Heav'n its Gifts not all at once bestows  These Years with Wisdom crowns with Action those  The Field of Combate fits the Young and Bold  The solemn Council best becomes the Old  To you the glorious Conflict I resign  Let sage Advice the Palm of Age be mine  He said With Joy the Monarch march'd before  And found  Menestheus  on the dusty Shore  With whom the firm  Athenian  Phalanx stands  And next  Ulysses  with his Subject Bands  Remote their Forces lay nor knew so far  The Peace infring'd nor heard the Sounds of War  The Tumult late begun they stood intent  To watch the Motion dubious of th' Event  The King who saw their Squadrons yet unmov'd  With hasty Ardour thus the Chiefs reprov'd  Can  Peteus'  Son forget a Warrior's Part  And fears  Ulysses  skill'd in ev'ry Art  Why stand you distant and the rest expect  To mix in Combate which your selves neglect  From you 'twas hop'd among the first to dare  The Shock of Armies and commence the War  For this your Names are call'd before the rest  To share the Pleasures of the Genial Feast  And can you Chiefs without a Blush survey  Whole Troops before you lab'ring in the Fray  Say is it thus those Honours you requite  The first in Banquets but the last in Fight  Ulysses  heard The Hero's Warmth o'erspread  His Cheek with Blushes and severe he said  Take back th' unjust Reproach Behold we stand  Sheath'd in bright Arms and but expect Command  If glorious Deeds afford thy Soul delight  Behold me plunging in the thickest Fight  Then give thy WarriorChief a Warrior's Due  Who dares to act whate'er thou dar'st to view  Struck with his gen'rous Wrath the King replies  Oh great in Action and in Council wise  With ours thy Care and Ardour are the same  Nor need I to command nor ought to blame  Sage as thou art and learn'd in Humankind  Forgive the Transport of a martial Mind  Haste to the Fight secure of just Amends  The Gods that make shall keep the Worthy Friends  He said and pass'd where great  Tydides  lay  His Steeds and Chariots wedg'd in firm Array  The warlike  Sthenelus  attends his side  To whom with stern Reproach the Monarch cry'd  Oh Son of  Tydeus  He whose Strength could tame  The bounding Steed in Arms a mighty Name  Can'st thou remote the mingling Hosts descry  With Hands unactive and a careless Eye  Not thus thy Sire the fierce Encounter fear'd  Still first in Front the matchless Prince appear'd  What glorious Toils what Wonders they recite  Who view'd him lab'ring thro' the Ranks of Fight  I saw him once when gath'ring martial Pow'rs  A peaceful Guest he sought  Mycenae  's Tow'rs  Armies he ask'd and Armies had been giv'n  Not we deny'd but  Jove  forbad from Heav'n  While dreadful Comets glaring from afar  Forewarn'd the Horrors of the  Theban  War  Next sent by  Greece  from where  Asopus  flows  A fearless Envoy he approach'd the Foes  Thebes'  hostile Walls unguarded and alone  Dauntless he enters and demands the Throne  The Tyrant feasting with his Chiefs he found  And dar'd to Combate all those Chiefs around  Dar'd and subdu'd before their haughty Lord  For  Pallas  strung his Arm and edg'd his Sword  Stung with the Shame within the winding Way  To bar his Passage fifty Warriors lay  Two Heroes led the secret Squadron on  Moeon  the fierce and hardy  Lycophon  Those fifty slaughter'd in the gloomy Vale  He spar'd but one to bear the dreadful Tale  Such  Tydeus  was and such his martial Fire  Gods how the Son degen'rates from the Sire  No Words the Godlike  Diomed  return'd  But heard respectful and in secret burn'd  Not so fierce  Capaneus'  undaunted Son  Stern as his Sire the Boaster thus begun  What needs O Monarch this invidious Praise  Our selves to lessen while our Sires you raise  Dare to be just  Atrides  and confess  Our Valour equal tho' our Fury less  With fewer Troops we storm'd the  Theban  Wall  And happier saw the Sev'nfold City fall  In impious Acts the guilty Fathers dy'd  The Sons subdu'd for Heav'n was on their side  Far more than Heirs of all our Parent's Fame  Our Glories darken their diminish'd Name  To him  Tydides  thus My Friend forbear  Suppress thy Passion and the King revere  His high Concern may well excuse this Rage  Whose Cause we follow and whose War we wage  His the first Praise were  Ilion  's Tow'rs o'erthrown  And if we fail the chief Disgrace his own  Let him the  Greeks  to hardy Toils excite  'Tis ours to labour in the glorious Fight  He spoke and ardent on the trembling Ground  Sprung from his Car his ringing Arms resound  Dire was the Clang and dreadful from afar  Of arm'd  Tydides  rushing to the War  As when the Winds ascending by degrees  First move the whitening Surface of the Seas  The Billows float in order to the Shore  The Wave behind rolls on the Wave before  Till with the growing Storm the Deeps arise  Foam o'er the Rocks and thunder to the Skies  So to the Fight the thick  Battalions  throng  Shields urg'd on Shields and Men drove Men along  Sedate and silent move the num'rous Bands  No Sound no Whisper but their Chief's Commands  Those only heard with Awe the rest obey  As if some God had snatch'd their Voice away  Not so the  Trojans  from their Host ascends  A gen'ral Shout that all the Region rends  As when the fleecy Flocks unnumber'd stand  In wealthy Folds and wait the Milker's Hand  The hollow Vales incessant Bleating fills  The Lambs reply from all the neighb'ring Hills  Such Clamours rose from various Nations round  Mix'd was the Murmur and confus'd the Sound  Each Host now joins and each a God inspires  These  Mars  incites and those  Minerva  fires  Pale  Flight  around and dreadful  Terror  reign  And  Discord  raging bathes the purple Plain  Discord  dire Sister of the slaught'ring Pow'r  Small at her Birth but rising ev'ry Hour  While scarce the Skies her horrid Head can bound  She stalks on Earth and shakes the World around  The Nations bleed wheree'er her Steps she turns  The Groan still deepens and the Combate burns  Now Shield with Shield with Helmet Helmet clos'd  To Armour Armour Lance to Lance oppos'd  Host against Host with shadowy Squadrons drew  The sounding Darts in Iron Tempests flew  Victors and Vanquish'd join promiscuous Cries  And shrilling Shouts and dying Groans arise  With streaming Blood the slipp'ry Fields are dy'd  And slaughter'd Heroes swell the dreadful Tide  As Torrents roll increas'd by num'rous Rills  With Rage impetuous down their ecchoing Hills  Rush to the Vales and pour'd along the Plain  Roar thro' a thousand Chanels to the Main  The distant Shepherd trembling hears the Sound  So mix both Hosts and so their Cries rebound  The bold  Antilochus  the Slaughter led  The first who strook a valiant  Trojan  dead  At great  Echepolus  the Lance arrives  Raz'd his high Crest and thro' his Helmet drives  Warm'd in the Brain the brazen Weapon lies  And Shades Eternal settle o'er his Eyes  So sinks a Tow'r that long Assaults had stood  Of Force and Fire its Walls besmear'd with Blood  Him the bold  Elphenor  Leader of th'  Abantian  Throng  Seiz'd to despoil and dragg'd the Corps along  But while he strove to tug th' inserted Dart  Agenor  's Jav'lin reach'd the Hero's Heart  His Flank unguarded by his ample Shield  Admits the Lance He falls and spurns the Field  The Nerves unbrac'd support his Limbs no more  The Soul comes floating in a Tide of Gore  Trojans  and  Greeks  now gather round the Slain  The War renews the Warriors bleed again  As o'er their Prey rapacious Wolves engage  Man dies on Man and all is Blood and Rage  In blooming Youth fair  Simoïsius  fell  Sent by great  Ajax  to the Shades of Hell  Fair  Simoïsius  whom his Mother bore  Amid the Flocks on silver  Simois'  Shore  The Nymph descending from the Hills of  Ide  To seek her Parents on his flow'ry Side  Brought forth the Babe their common Care and Joy  And thence from  Simois  nam'd the lovely Boy  Short was his Date by dreadful  Ajax  slain  He falls and renders all their Cares in vain  So falls a Poplar that in watry Ground  Rais'd high the Head with stately Branches crown'd  Fell'd by some Artist with his shining Steel  To shape the Circle of the bending Wheel  Cut down it lies tall smooth and largely spread  With all its beauteous Honours on its Head  There left a Subject to the Wind and Rain  And scorch'd by Suns it withers on the Plain  Thus pierc'd by  Ajax Simoïsius  lies  Stretch'd on the Shore and thus neglected dies  At  Ajax Antiphus  his Jav'lin threw  The pointed Lance with erring Fury flew  And  Leucus  lov'd by wise  Ulysses  slew  He drops the Corps of  Simoïsius  slain  And sinks a breathless Carcass on the Plain  This saw  Ulysses  and with Grief enrag'd  Strode where the foremost of the Foes engag'd  Arm'd with his Spear he meditates the Wound  In Act to throw but cautious look'd around  Struck at his Sight the  Trojans  backward drew  And trembling heard the Jav'lin as it flew  A Chief stood nigh who from  Abydos  came  Old  Priam  's Son  Democoon  was his Name  The Weapon enter'd close above his Ear  Cold thro' his Temples glides the whizzing Spear  With piercing Shrieks the Youth resigns his Breath  His Eyeballs darken with the Shades of Death  Down sinks the Chief his clanging Arms resound  And his broad Buckler rings against the Ground  Seiz'd with Affright the boldest Foes appear  Ev'n Godlike  Hector  seems himself to fear  Slow he gave way the rest tumultuous fled  The  Greeks  with Shouts press on and spoil the Dead  But  Phoebus  now from  Ilion  's tow'ring Height  Shines forth reveal'd and animates the Fight  Trojans  be bold and Force with Force oppose  Your foaming Steeds urge headlong on the Foes  Nor are their Bodies Rocks nor ribb'd with Steel  Your Weapons enter and your Strokes they feel  Have ye forgot what seem'd your Dread before  The great the fierce  Achilles  fights no more  Apollo  thus from  Ilion  's lofty Tow'rs  Array'd in Terrors rowz'd the  Trojan  Pow'rs  While War's fierce Goddess fires the  Grecian  Foe  And shouts and thunders in the Fields below  Then great  Diores  fell by Doom Divine  In vain his Valour and illustrious Line  A broken Rock the Force of  Pirus  threw  Who from cold  Aenus  led the  Thracian  Crew  Full on his Ankle dropt the pond'rous Stone  Burst the strong Nerves and crash'd the solid Bone  Supine he tumbles on the crimson'd Sands  Before his helpless Friends and native Bands  And spreads for Aid his unavailing Hands  The Foe rush'd furious as he pants for Breath  And thro' his Navel drove the pointed Death  His gushing Entrails smoak'd upon the Ground  And the warm Life came issuing from the Wound  His Lance bold  Thoas  at the Conqu'ror sent  Deep in his Breast above the Pap it went  Amid the Lungs was fix'd the winged Wood  And quiv'ring in his heaving Bosom stood  'Till from the dying Chief approaching near  Th'  Aetolian  Warrior tugg'd his weighty Spear  Then sudden wav'd his flaming Faulchion round  And gash'd his Belly with a ghastly Wound  The Corps now breathless on the bloody Plain  To spoil his Arms the Victor strove in vain  The  Thracian  Bands against the Victor prest  A Grove of Lances glitter'd at his Breast  Stern  Thoas  glaring with revengeful Eyes  In sullen Fury slowly quits the Prize  Thus fell two Heroes one the Pride of  Thrace  And one the Leader of th'  Epeian  Race  Death's sable Shade at once o'ercast their Eyes  In Dust the Vanquish'd and the Victor lies  With copious Slaughter all the Fields are red  And heap'd with growing Mountains of the Dead  Had some brave Chief this martial Scene beheld  By  Pallas  guarded thro' the dreadful Field  Might Darts be bid to turn their Points away  And Swords around him innocently play  The War's whole Art with Wonder had he seen  And counted Heroes where he counted Men  So fought each Host with Thirst of Glory fir'd  And Crowds on Crowds triumphantly expir'd  OBSERVATIONS ON THE Fourth Book  OBSERVATIONS ON THE FOURTH BOOK  I  IT was from the beginning of this Book that  Virgil  has taken that of his tenth  Aeneid  as the whole Tenour of the Story in this and the last Book is followed in his twelfth The Truce and the solemn Oath the Breach of it by a Dart thrown by  Tolumnius Juturna  's inciting the  Latines  to renew the War the Wound of  Aeneas  his speedy Cure and the Battel ensuing all these are manifestly copied from hence The Solemnity Surprize and Variety of these Circumstances seem'd to him of Importance enough to build the whole Catastrophe of his Work upon them tho' in  Homer  they are but Openings to the general Action and such as in their Warmth are still exceeded by all that follows them They are chosen we grant by  Virgil  with great Judgment and conclude his Poem with a becoming Majesty Yet the finishing his Scheme with that which is but the coolest Part of  Homer  's Action tends in some degree to shew the Disparity of the Poetical Fire in these two Authors  II  VERSE  Immortal  Hebe  The Goddess of Youth is introduc'd as an Attendant upon the Banquets of the Gods to  shew that the divine Beings enjoy an eternal Youth and that their Life is a Felicity without end  Dacier  III  VERSE  Two Pow'rs Divine    Jupiter's reproaching these two Goddesses with neglecting to assist  Menelaus  proceeds as M  Dacier  remarks from the Affection he bore to  Troy  Since if  Menelaus  by their help had gain'd a compleat Victory the Siege had been rais'd and the City deliver'd On the contrary  Juno  and  Minerva  might suffer  Paris  to escape as the Method to continue the War to the total Destruction of  Troy  And accordingly a few Lines after we find them complotting together and contriving a new Scene of Miseries to the  Trojans  IV  VERSE  Tho' great  Atrides  gain'd the glorious Strife    Jupiter here makes it a Question Whether the foregoing Combate should determine the Controversy or the Peace be broken His putting it thus  that  Paris  is not killed but  Menelaus  has the Victory  gives a Hint for a Dispute whether the Conditions of the Treaty were valid or annulled that is to say whether the Controversy was to be determined by the  Victory  or by the  Death  of one of the Combatants Accordingly it has been disputed whether the Articles were really binding to the  Trojans  or not  Plutarch  has treated the Question in his  Symposiacks l    qu  The Substance is this In the first Proposal of the Challenge  Paris  mentions only the Victory  And who his Rival shall in Arms subdue  Nor does  Hector  who carries it say any more However  Menelaus  understands it of the Death by what he replies  Fall he that must beneath his Rival's Arms And live the restIris  to  Helen  speaks only of the former and  Idaeus  to  Priam  repeats the same Words But in the solemn Oath  Agamemnon  specifies the latter  If by  Paris  slain  and  If by my Brother's Arms the  Trojan  bleed Priam  also understands it of both saying at his leaving the Field  What Prince shall fall Heav'n  only knows  I do not cite the  Greek  because the  English  has preserv'd the same Nicety  Paris  himself confesses he has lost the Victory in his Speech to  Helen  which he would hardly have done had the whole depended on that alone And lastly  Menelaus  after the Conquest is clearly his by the Flight of  Paris  is still searching round the Field to kill him as if all were of no effect without the Death of his Adversary It appears from hence that the  Trojans  had no ill Pretence to break the Treaty so that  Homer  ought not to have been directly accus'd of making  Jupiter  the Author of Perjury in what follows which is one of the Chief of  Plato  's Objections against him  V  VERSE  Tho' secret Anger swell'd  Minerva  's Breast    Spondanus takes notice that  Minerva  who in the first Book had restrain'd the Anger of  Achilles  had now an Opportunity of exerting the same Conduct in respect to herself We may bring the Parallel close by observing that she had before her in like manner a Superior who had provok'd her by sharp Expressions and whose Counsels ran against her Sentiments In all which the Poet takes care to preserve her still in the Practice of that  Wisdom  of which she was Goddess  VI  VERSE  Let  Priam  bleed  c  We find in  Persius  's Satyrs the Name of  Labeo  as an ill Poet who made a miserable Translation of the  Iliad  one of whose Verses is still preserv'd and happens to be that of this Place  Crudum manduces Priamum Priamique pisinnos  It may seem from this that his Translation was servilely literal as the old  Scholiast  on  Persius  observes And one cannot but take notice that  Ogilby  's and  Hobbes  's in this Place are not unlike  Labeo  's  Both King and People thou would'st eat alive  And eat up  Priam  and his Children all  VII  VERSE  But should this Arm prepare to wreak our Hate On thy lov'd Towns    Homer  in this Place has made  Jupiter  to prophecy the Destruction of  Mycenae  the favour'd City of  Juno  which happen'd a little before the Time of our Author  Strab l    The  Trojan  War being over and the Kingdom of  Agamemnon  destroy'd  Mycenae  daily decreas'd after the Return of the  Heraclidae  For these becoming Masters of  Peloponnesus  cast out the old Inhabitants so that they who possess'd  Argos  overcame  Mycenae  also and contracted both into one Body A short time after  Mycenae  was destroy'd by the  Argives  and not the least Remains of it are now to be found  VIII  VERSE  Th'Advice approv'd    This is one of the Places for which  Homer  is blamed by  Plato  who introduces  Socrates  reprehending it in his Dialogue of the Republick And indeed if it were granted that the  Trojans  had no Right to break this Treaty the present Machine where  Juno  is made to propose Perjury  Jupiter  to allow it and  Minerva  to be commission'd to hasten the Execution of it would be one of the hardest to be reconciled to reason in the whole Poem Unless even then one might imagine that  Homer  's Heaven is sometimes no more than an Ideal World of abstracted Beings and so every Motion which rises in the Mind of Man is attributed to the Quality to which it belongs with the Name of the Deity who is suppos'd to preside over that Quality superadded to it In this Sense the present Allegory is easy enough  Pandarus  thinks it  Prudence  to gain Honour and Wealth at the Hands of the  Trojans  by destroying  Menelaus  This Sentiment is also incited by a Notion of  Glory  of which  Juno  is represented as Goddess  Jupiter  who is suppos'd to know  the Thoughts of Men permits the Action which he is not Author of but sends a Prodigy at the same time to give warning of a coming Mischief and accordingly we find both Armies descanting upon the sight of it in the following Lines  IX  VERSE Pandarus  for Strength renown'd    Homer says  Plutarch  in his Treatise of the  Pythian Oracle  makes not the Gods to use all Persons indifferently as their second Agents but each according to the Powers he is endu'd with by Art or Nature For a Proof of this he puts us in Mind how  Minerva  when she would persuade the  Greeks  seeks for  Ulysses  when she would break the Truce for  Pandarus  and when she would conquer for  Diomed  If we consult the  Scholia  upon this Instance they give several Reasons why  Pandarus  was particularly proper for the Occasion The Goddess went not to the  Trojans  because they hated  Paris  and as we are told in the end of the foregoing Book would rather have given him up than have done an ill Action for him She therefore looks among the Allies and finds  Pandarus  who was of a Nation noted for Perfidiousness and had a Soul avaricious enough to be capable of engaging in this Treachery for the hopes of a Reward from  Paris  as appears by his being so covetous as not to bring Horses to the Siege for fear of the Expence or Loss of them as he tells  Aeneas  in the fifth Book  X  VERSE  Sixteen Palms    Both the Horns together made this Length and not each as Madam  Dacier  renders it I do not object it as an Improbability that the Horns were of sixteen Palms each but that this would be an extravagant and unmanageable Size for a Bow is evident  XI  VERSE  This by the  Greeks  unseen the Warrior bends    The Poet having held us thro' the foregoing Book in Expectation  of a Peace makes the Conditions be here broken after such a manner as should oblige the  Greeks  to act thro' the War with that irreconcileable Fury which affords him the Opportunity of exerting the full Fire of his own Genius The Shot of  Pandarus  being therefore of such Consequence and as he calls it the  the  Foundation of future Woes  it was thought fit not to pass it over in a few Words like the Flight of every common Arrow but to give it a Description some way corresponding to its Importance For this he surrounds it with a Train of Circumstances the History of the Bow the bending it the covering  Pandarus  with Shields the Choice of the Arrow the Prayer and Posture of the Shooter the Sound of the String and Flight of the Shaft all most beautifully and livelily painted It may be observed too how proper a time it was to expatiate in these Particulars when the Armies being unemploy'd and only one Man acting the Poet and his Readers had leisure to be the Spectators of a single and deliberate Action I think it will be allow'd that the little Circumstances which are sometimes thought too redundant in  Homer  have a wonderful Beauty in this Place  Virgil  has not fail'd to copy it and with the greatest Happiness imaginable  Dixit auratâ volucrem Threissa sagittam  Deprompsit pharetrâ cornuque infensa tetendit  Et duxit longè donec curvata coirent  Inter se capita manibus jam tangeret aequis  Laevâ aciem ferri dextrâ nervoque papillam  Extemplo teli stridorem aurasque sonantes  Audiit unà Aruns haesitque in corpore ferrum  XII  VERSE Pallas  assists and weaken'd in its force Diverts the Weapon    For she only designed by all this Action to encrease the Glory of the  Greeks  in the taking of  Troy  Yet some Commentators have been so stupid as to wonder that  Pallas  should be employ'd first in the wounding of  Menelaus  and after in the protecting him  XIII  VERSE  Wafts the wing'd Hornet    This is one of those humble Comparisons which  Homer  sometimes uses to diversify his Subject but a very exact one in its kind and corresponding in all its Parts The Care of the Goddess the unsuspecting Security of  Menelaus  the Ease with which she diverts the Danger and the Danger itself are all included in this short Compass To which it may be added that if the Providence of heavenly Powers to their Creatures is exprest by the Love of a Mother to her Child if Men in regard to them are but as heedless sleeping Infants and if those Dangers which may seem great to us are by them as easily warded off as the Simile implies there will appear something sublime in this Conception however little or low the Image may be thought at first sight in respect to a Heroe A higher Comparison would but have tended to lessen the Disparity between the Gods and Man and the Justness of the Simile had been lost as well as the Grandeur of the Sentiment  XIV  VERSE  As when some stately Trappings  c  Some have judg'd the Circumstances in this Simile to be superfluous and think it foreign to the Purpose to take notice that this Ivory was intended for the Bosses of a Bridle was laid up for a Prince or that a Woman of  Caria  or  Meonia  dy'd it  Eustathius  was of a different Opinion who extols this Passage for the Variety it presents and the Learning it includes We learn from hence that the  Lydians  and  Carians  were famous in the first Times for their staining in Purple and that the Women excell'd in Works of Ivory As also that there were certain Ornaments which only Kings and Princes were privileged to wear But without having recourse to Antiquities to justify this Particular it may be alledg'd that the Simile does not consist barely in the Colours It was but little to tell us that the Blood of  Menelaus  appearing on the Whiteness of his Skin vyed with the purpled Ivory but this  implies that the honourable Wounds of a Heroe are the beautiful Dress of War and become him as much as the most gallant Ornaments in which he takes the Field  Virgil  'tis true has omitted the Circumstance in his Imitation of this Comparison  Aen    Indum sanguineo veluti violaverit ostro  Si quis ebur  But in this he judges only for himself and does not condemn  Homer  It was by no means proper that his Ivory should have been a Piece of martial Accoutrement when he apply'd it so differently transferring it from the Wounds of a Heroe to the Blushes of the fair  Lavinia  XV  VERSE  As down thy snowy Thigh    Homer is very particular here in giving the Picture of the Blood running in a long Trace lower and lower as will appear from the Words themselves  The Translator has not thought fit to mention every one of these Parts first the Thigh then the Leg then the Foot which might be tedious in  English  But the Author's Design being only to image the streaming of the Blood it seem'd equivalent to make it trickle thro' the Length of an  Alexandrine  Line  XVI  VERSE  Oh dear as Life  c  This Incident of the Wound of  Menelaus  gives occasion to  Homer  to draw a fine Description of fraternal Love in  Agamemnon  On the first sight of it he is struck with Amaze and Confusion and now breaks out in Tenderness and Grief He first accuses himself  as the Cause of this Misfortune by having consented to expose his Brother to the single Combate which had drawn on this fatal Consequence Next he inveighs against the  Trojans  in general for their Perfidiousness as not yet knowing it was the Act of  Pandarus  only He then comforts himself with the Confidence that the Gods will revenge him upon  Troy  but doubts by what Hands this Punishment may be inflicted as fearing the Death of  Menelaus  will force the  Greeks  to return with Shame to their Country There is no Contradiction in all this but on the other side a great deal of Nature in the confused Sentiments of  Agamemnon  on the occasion as they are very well explained by  Spondanus  XVII  VERSE  While some proud  Trojan  c    Agamemnon here calls to mind how upon the Death of his Brother the ineffectual Preparations and Actions against  Troy  must become a Derision to the World This is in its own Nature a very irritating Sentiment tho' it were never so carelesly exprest but the Poet has found out a peculiar Air of Aggravation in making him bring all the Consequences before his Eyes in a Picture of their  Trojan  Enemies gathering round the Tomb of the unhappy  Menelaus  elated with Pride insulting the Dead and throwing out disdainful Expressions and Curses against him and his Family There is nothing which could more effectually represent a State of Anguish than the drawing such an Image as this which shews a Man increasing his present Unhappiness by the Prospect of a future Train of Misfortunes  XVIII  VERSE  Let not thy Words the Warmth of  Greece  abate    In  Agamemnon Homer  has shewn an Example of a tender Nature and fraternal Affection and now in  Menelaus  he gives us one of a generous warlike Patience and Presence of Mind He speaks of his own Case with no other Regard but as this Accident of his Wound may tend to the Discouragement of  the Soldiers and exhorts the General to beware of dejecting their Spirits from the Prosecution of the War  Spondanus  XIX  VERSE  The  Trojans  rush tumultuous to the War    They advanced to the Enemy in the Belief that the Shot of  Pandarus  was made by Order of the Generals  Dacier  XX  VERSE  Nor had you seen    The Poet here changes his Narration and turns himself to the Reader in an  Apostrophe Longinus  in his d Chapter commends this Figure as causing a Reader to become a Spectator and keeping his Mind fixed upon the Action before him  The  Apostrophe says he  renders us more awaken'd more attentive and more full of the Thing described  Madam  Dacier  will have it that it is the Muse who addresses herself to the Poet in the second Person 'Tis no great matter which since it has equally its Effect either way  XXI  VERSE  Thro' all the martial Ranks he moves  c  In the following Review of the Army which takes up a great Part of this Book we see all the Spirit Art and Industry of a compleat General together with the proper  Characters  of those Leaders whom he incites  Agamemnon  considers at this sudden Exigence that he should first address himself to all in general he divides his Discourse to the Brave and the Fearful using Arguments which arise from Confidence or Despair Passions which act upon us most forcibly To the Brave he urges their secure Hopes of Conquest since the Gods must punish Perjury to the Timorous their inevitable Destruction if the Enemy should burn their Ships After this he flies from Rank to Rank applying himself to each Ally with particular Artifice He caresses  Idomeneus  as an old Friend who had promised not to forsake him and meets with an Answer  in that Hero's true Character short honest hearty and Soldierlike He praises the  Ajaxes  as Warriors whose Examples fired the Army and is received by them without any Reply as they were Men who did not profess Speaking He passes next to  Nestor  whom he finds talking to his Soldiers as he marshal'd them here he was not to part without a Compliment on both sides he wishes him the Strength he had once in his Youth and is answer'd with an Account of something which the old Heroe had done in his former Days From hence he goes to the Troops which lay farthest from the Place of Action where he finds  Menestheus  and  Ulysses  not intirely unprepar'd nor yet in Motion as being ignorant of what had happen'd He reproves  Ulysses  for this with Words agreeable to the Hurry he is in and receives an Answer which suits not ill with the twofold Character of a wise and a valiant Man Hereupon  Agamemnon  appears present to himself and excuses his hasty Expressions The next he meets is  Diomed  whom he also rebukes for Backwardness but after another manner by setting before him the Example of his Father Thus is  Agamemnon  introduced praising terrifying exhorting blaming excusing himself and again relapsing into Reproofs a lively Picture of a great Mind in the highest Emotion And at the same time the Variety is so kept up with a regard to the different Characters of the Leaders that our Thoughts are not tired with running along with him over all his Army  XXII  VERSE  For this in Banquets    The Ancients usually in their Feasts divided to the Guests by equal Portions except when they took some particular occasion to shew Distinction and give the Preference to any one Person It was then look'd upon as the highest Mark of Honour to be allotted the best Portion of Meat and Wine and to be allowed an Exemption from the Laws of the Feast in drinking Wine unmingled and without Stint This Custom was much more ancient than the time of the  Trojan  War and we find it practised in the Banquet given by  Joseph  to his Brethren in  Aegypt  Gen  ℣  ult And he sent Messes to them from before him but  Benjamin  's Mess was five times so much as any of theirs Dacier  XXIII  VERSE  There rev'rend  Nestor  ranks his  Pylian  Bands    This is the Prince whom  Homer  chiefly celebrates for martial Discipline of the rest he is content to say they were valiant and ready to fight The Years long Observation and Experience of  Nestor  render'd him the fittest Person to be distinguished on this account The Disposition of his Troops in this Place together with what he is made to say that their Forefathers used the same Method may be a Proof that the Art of War was well known in  Greece  before the Time of  Homer  Nor indeed can it be imagined otherwise in an Age when all the World made their Acquisitions by Force of Arms only What is most to be wonder'd at is that they had not the use of  Cavalry  all Men engaging either on  Foot  or from  Chariots  a Particular necessary to be known by every Reader of  Homer  's Battels In these Chariots there were always two Persons one of whom only fought the other was wholly employ'd in managing the Horses Madam  Dacier  in her excellent Preface to  Homer  is of Opinion that there were no Horsemen 'till near the Time of  Saul  threescore Years after the Siege of  Troy  so that altho' Cavalry were in use in  Homer  's Days yet he thought himself obliged to regard the Customs of the Age of which he writ rather than those of his own  XXIV  VERSE  The middle Space suspected Troops supply    This Artifice of placing those Men whose Behaviour was most to be doubted in the middle so as to put them under a necessity of engaging even against their Inclinations was followed by  Hannibal  in the Battel of  Zama  as is observed and praised by  Polybius  who quotes this Verse on that occasion in Acknowledgment of  Homer  's Skill in military Discipline  That our Author was the first Master of that Art in  Greece  is the Opinion of  Aelian Tactic c    Frontinus  gives us another Example of  Pyrrhus  King of  Epirus  's following this Instruction of  Homer Vide Stratag lib    c  So  Ammianus Marcellinus l    Imperator catervis peditum infirmis medium inter acies spacium secundùm Homericam dispositionem praestituit  XXV  VERSE  He whom the Fortune of the Field shall cast  From forth his Chariot mount the next  c  The Words in the Original are capable of four different Significations as  Eustathius  observes The first is that whoever in fighting upon his Chariot shall win a Chariot from his Enemy he shall continue to fight and not retire from the Engagement to secure his Prize The second that if any one be thrown out of his Chariot he who happens to be nearest shall hold forth his Javelin to help him up into his own The third is directly the contrary to the last that if any one be cast from his Chariot and would mount up into another Man's that other shall push him back with his Javelin and not admit him for fear of interrupting the Combate The fourth is the Sense which is followed in the Translation as seeming much the most natural that every one should be left to govern his own Chariot and the other who is admitted fight only with the Javelin The reason of this Advice appears by the Speech of  Pandarus  to  Aeneas  in the next Book  Aeneas  having taken him up into his Chariot to go against  Diomed  compliments him with the Choice either to fight or to manage the Reins which was esteem'd an Office of Honour To this  Pandarus  answers that it is more proper for  Aeneas  to guide his own Horses lest they not feeling their accustomed Master should be ungovernable and bring them into Danger  Upon occasion of the various and contrary Significations of which these Words are said to be capable and which  Eustathius  and  Dacier  profess to admire as an Excellence Mons  de la Motte  in his late Discourse upon  Homer  very justly animadverts that if this be true it is a grievous Fault in  Homer  For what can be more absurd than to imagine that the Orders given in a Battel should be delivered in such ambiguous Terms as to be capable of many Meanings These double Interpretations must proceed not from any design in the Author but purely from the Ignorance of the Moderns in the  Greek  Tongue It being impossible for any one to possess the dead Languages to such a degree as to be certain of all the Graces and Negligences or to know precisely how far the Licences and Boldnesses of Expression were happy or forced But Criticks to be thought learned attribute to the Poet all the random Senses that amuse them and imagine they see in a single Word a whole heap of Things which no modern Language can express so are oftentimes charmed with nothing but the Confusion of their own Ideas  XXVI  VERSE  Remote their Forces lay    This is a Reason why the Troops of  Ulysses  and  Menestheus  were not yet in Motion Tho' another may be added in respect to the former that it did not consist with the Wisdom of  Ulysses  to fall on with his Forces 'till he was well assured Tho' Courage be no inconsiderable Part of his Character yet it is always join'd with great Caution Thus we see him soon after in the very Heat of a Battel when his Friend was just slain before his Eyes first looking carefully about him before he would throw his Spear to revenge him  XXVII  VERSE  I saw him once when  c  This long Narration concerning the History of  Tydeus  is not of the Nature of those for which  Homer  has been blam'd with some Colour of Justice It is not a cold Story but a warm Reproof while the particularising the Actions of the Father is made the highest Incentive to the Son Accordingly the Air of this  Speech ought to be inspirited above the common Narrative Style As for the Story itself it is finely told by  Statius  in the second Book of the  Thebais  XXVIII  VERSE  No Words the Godlike  Diomed  return'd    "When  Diomed  is reproved by  Agamemnon  he holds his Peace in respect to his General but  Sthenelus  retorts upon him with Boasting and Insolence It is here worth observing in what manner  Agamemnon  behaves himself he passes by  Sthenelus  without affording any Reply whereas just before when  Ulysses  testify'd his Resentment he immediately return'd him an Answer For as it is a mean and servile thing and unbecoming the Majesty of a Prince to make Apologies to every Man in Justification of what he has said or done so to treat all Men with equal Neglect is meer Pride and Excess of Folly We also see of  Diomed  that tho' he refrains from speaking in this Place when the Time demanded Action he afterwards expresses himself in such a manner as shews him not to have been insensible of this unjust Rebuke  as in the ninth Book  when he tells the King he was the first who had dar'd to reproach him with want of Courage"  Plutarch  of reading the Poets  XXIX  VERSE  We storm'd the  Theban  Wall    The first  Theban  War of which  Agamemnon  spoke in the preceding Lines was seven and twenty Years before the War of  Troy Sthenelus  here speaks of the second  Theban  War which happen'd ten Years after the first when the Sons of the seven Captains conquer'd the City before which their Fathers were destroyed  Tydeus  expired gnawing the Head of his Enemy and  Capaneus  was Thunderstruck while he blasphemed  Jupiter Vid Stat Thebaid  XXX  VERSE  As when the Winds    Madam  Dacier  thinks it may seem something odd that an Army going to conquer should be compared to the Waves going to break themselves against the Shore and would solve the appearing Absurdity by imagining the Poet laid not the Stress so much upon this Circumstance as upon the same Waves assaulting a Rock lifting themselves over its Head and covering it with Foam as the  Trophy of their Victory  as she expresses it But to this it may be answer'd that neither did the  Greeks  get the better in this Battel nor will a Comparison be allowed intirely beautiful which instead of illustrating its Subject stands itself in need of so much Illustration and Refinement to be brought to agree with it The Passage naturally bears this Sense  As when upon the rising of the Wind the Waves roll after one another to the Shore at first there is a distant Motion in the Sea then they approach to break with Noise on the Strand and lastly rise swelling over the Rocks and toss their Foam above their Heads So the  Greeks  at first marched in order one after another silently to the Fight  Where the Poet breaks off from prosecuting the Comparison and by a  Prolepsis  leaves the Reader to carry it on and image to himself the future Tumult Rage and Force of the Battel in Opposition to that Silence in which he describes the Troops at present in the Lines immediately ensuing What confirms this Exposition is that  Virgil  has made use of the Simile in the same Sense in the seventh  Aeneid  Fluctus uti primo coepit cùm albescere vento  Paulatim sese tollit mare altiùs undas  Erigit inde imo consurgit ad aethera fundo  XXXI  VERSE  As when the Winds  c  This is the first Battel in  Homer  and it is worthy Observation with what Grandeur it is described and raised by one Circumstance  above another 'till all is involved in Horror and Tumult The foregoing Simile of the Winds rising by degrees into a general Tempest is an Image of the Progress of his own Spirit in this Description We see first an innumerable Army moving in order and are amus'd with the Pomp and Silence then waken'd with the Noise and Clamour next they join the adverse Gods are let down among them the Imaginary Persons of  Terror Flight Discord  succeed to reinforce them then all is undistinguish'd Fury and a Confusion of Horrors only that at different Openings we behold the distinct Deaths of several Heroes and then are involv'd again in the same Confusion  XXXII  VERSE  Discord dire Sister  c  This is the Passage so highly extoll'd by  Longinus  as one of the most signal Instances of the noble Sublimity of this Author where it is said that the Image here drawn of Discord  whose Head touch'd the Heavens  and  whose Feet were on Earth  may as justly be apply'd to the vast Reach and Elevation of the Genius of  Homer  But Mons  Boileau  informs us that neither the Quotation nor these Words were in the Original of  Longinus  but partly inserted by  Gabriel de Petra  However the best Encomium is that  Virgil  has taken it word for word and apply'd it to the Person of  Fame  Parva metu primo mox sese attollit in auras  Ingrediturque solo caput inter nubila condit  Aristides  had formerly blamed  Homer  for admitting  Discord  into Heaven and  Scaliger  takes up the Criticism to throw him below  Virgil Fame  he says is properly feign'd to hide her Head in the Clouds because the Grounds and Authors of Rumours are commonly unknown As if the same might not be alledg'd for  Homer  since the Grounds and Authors of  Discord  are often no less secret  Macrobius  has put this among the Passages where he thinks  Virgil  has fallen short in his Imitation of  Homer  and brings these Reasons for his  Opinion  Homer  represents  Discord  to rise from small beginnings and afterwards in her Encrease to reach the Heavens  Virgil  has said this of  Fame  but not with equal Propriety for the Subjects are very different  Discord  tho' it reaches to War and Devastation is still  Discord  nor ceases to be what it was at first But  Fame  when it grows to be universal is  Fame  no longer but becomes Knowledge and Certainty For who calls any thing  Fame  which is known from Earth to Heaven Nor has  Virgil  equal'd the Strength of  Homer  's Hyperbole for one speaks of  Heaven  the other only of the  Clouds Macrob Sat l    c    Scaliger  is very angry at this last Period and by mistake blames  Gellius  for it in whom there is no such thing His Words are so insolently dogmatical that barely to quote them is to answer them and the only Answer which such a Spirit of Criticism deserves  Clamant quòd Maro de Fama dixit eam inter nubila caput condere cùm tamen Homerus unde ipse accepit in coelo caput Eridis constituit Jam tibi pro me respondeo Non sum imitatus nolo imitari non placet non est verum Contentionem ponere caput in coelo Ridiculum est fatuum est Homericum est Graeculum est  Poetic  l    c    This fine Verse was also criticiz'd by Mons  Perault  who accuses it as a forc'd and extravagant Hyperbole M  Boileau  answers that Hyperboles as strong are daily used even in common Discourse and that nothing is in effect more strictly true than that  Discord  reigns over all the Earth and in Heaven itself that is to say among the Gods of  Homer  It is not continues this excellent Critick the Description of a Giant as this Censor would pretend but a just Allegory and as he makes  Discord  an allegorical Person she may be of what Size he pleases without shocking us since it is what we regard only as an Idea and Creature of the Fancy and not as a material Substance that has any Being in Nature The Expression in the  Psalms  that the  impious Man is lifted up as a Cedar of  Libanus does by no means imply that the impious Man was a Giant as tall as the Cedar Thus far  Boileau  and upon the whole we may observe that it seems not only the Fate of great Genius's to have met with the most malignant Criticks but of the finest and noblest Passages in them  to have been particularly pitch'd upon for impertinent Criticisms These are the divine Boldnesses which in their very Nature provoke Ignorance and Shortsightedness to shew themselves and which whoever is capable of attaining must also certainly know that they will be attack'd by such as cannot reach them  XXXIII  VERSE  Now Shield with Shield  c  The Verses which follow in the Original are perhaps excell'd by none in  Homer  and that he had himself a particular Fondness for them may be imagin'd from his inserting them again in the same Words in the eighth Book They are very happily imitated by  Statius lib    Jam clypeus clypeis umbone repellitur umbo  Ense minax ensis pede pes cuspide cuspis  c  XXXIV  VERSE  As Torrents roll    This Comparison of Rivers meeting and roaring with two Armies mingling in Battel is an Image of that Nobleness which to say no more was worthy the Invention of  Homer  and the Imitation of  Virgil  Aut ubi decursu rapido de montibus altis  Dant sonitum spumosi amnes in aequora currunt  Quisque suum populatus iterStupet inscius alto  Accipiens sonitum saxi de vertice Pastor  The word  populatus  here has a Beauty which one must be insensible not to observe  Scaliger  prefers  Virgil  's and  Macrobius Homer  's without any Reasons on either side but only one Critick's positive Word against another's The Reader may judge between them  XXXV  VERSE  The bold  Antilochus  Antilochus  the Son of  Nestor  is the first who begins the Engagement It seems as  if the old Hero having done the greatest Service he was capable of at his Years in disposing the Troops in the best order as we have seen before had taken care to set his Son at the head of them to give him the Glory of beginning the Battel  XXXVI  VERSE  As o'er their Prey rapacious Wolves engage    This short Comparison in the  Greek  consists only of two Words  which  Scaliger  observes upon as too abrupt But may it not be answer'd that such a Place as this where all things are in Confusion seems not to admit of any Simile except of one which scarce exceeds a Metaphor in Length When two Heroes are engag'd there is a plain View to be given us of their Actions and there a long Simile may be of use to raise and enliven them by parallel Circumstances but when the Troops fall in promiscuously upon one another the Conclusion excludes distinct or partiticular Images and consequently Comparisons of any Length would be less natural  XXXVII  VERSE  In bloom of Youth fair  Simoisius  fell    This Prince receiv'd his Name from the River  Simois  on whose Banks he was born It was the Custom of the Eastern People to give Names to their Children deriv'd from the most remarkable Accidents of their Birth The holy Scripture is full of Examples of this kind It is also usual in the Old Testament to compare Princes to Trees Cedars  c  as  Simoisius  is here resembled to a Poplar  Dacier  XXXVIII  VERSE  So falls a Poplar    Eustathius in  Macrobius  prefers to this Simile that of  Virgil  in the second  Aeneid  Ac veluti in summis antiquam montibus ornum  Cum ferro accisam crebrisque bipennibus instant  Eruere agricolae certatim illa usque minatur  Et tremefacta comam concusso vertice nutat  Vulneribus donec paulatim evicta supremùm  Congemuit traxitque jugis avulsa ruinam  Mr  Hobbes  in the Preface to his Translation of  Homer  has discours'd upon this Occasion very judiciously  Homer  says he intended no more in this Place than to shew how comely the Body of  Simoisius  appear'd as he lay dead upon the Bank of  Scamander  strait and tall with a fair Head of Hair like a strait and high Poplar with the Boughs still on and not at all to describe the manner of his falling which when a Man is wounded thro' the Breast as he was with a Spear is always sudden  Virgil  's is the Description of a great Tree falling when many Men together hew it down He meant to compare the manner how  Troy  after many Battels and after the Loss of many Cities conquer'd by the many Nations under  Agamemnon  in a long War was thereby weaken'd and at last overthrown with a great Tree hewn round about and then falling by little and little leisurely So that neither these two Descriptions nor the two Comparisons can be compared together The Image of a Man lying on the Ground is one thing the Image of falling especially of a Kingdom is another This therefore gives no Advantage to  Virgil  over  Homer  Thus Mr  Hobbes  XXXIX  VERSE  But  Phoebus  now    Homer here introduces  Apollo  on the side of the  Trojans  He had given them the Assistance of  Mars  at the beginning of this Battel but  Mars  which signifies Courage without Conduct proving too weak to resist  Minerva  or Courage with Conduct which the Poet represents as constantly aiding his  Greeks  they want some prudent Management to rally them again He therefore brings in a  Wisdom  to assist  Mars  under the Appearance of  Apollo  XL  VERSE Achilles  fights no more    Homer from time to time puts his Readers in mind of  Achilles  during his Absence from the War and finds occasions of celebrating his Valour with the highest Praises There cannot be a greater Encomium than this where  Apollo  himself tells the  Trojans  they have nothing to fear since  Achilles  fights no longer against them  Dacier  XLI  VERSE  Had some brave Chief    The turning off in this Place from the Actions of the Field to represent to us a Man with Security and Calmness walking thro' it without being able to reprehend any thing in the whole Action this is not only a fine Praise of the Battel but as it were a Breathingplace to the Poetical Spirit of the Author after having rapidly run along with the Heat of the Engagement He seems like one who having got over a Part of his Journey stops upon an Eminence to look back upon the Space he has pass'd and concludes the Book with an agreeable Pause or Respite  The Reader will excuse our taking notice of such a Trifle as that it was an old Superstition that this fourth Book of the  Iliads  being laid under the Head was a Cure for the  Quartan Ague Serenus Sammonicus  a celebrated Physician in the time of the younger  Gordian  and Preceptor to that Emperor has gravely prescrib'd it among other Receipts in his medicinal Precepts  Praec    Moeoniae Iliados quartum suppone timenti  I believe it will be found a true Observation that there never was any thing so absurd or ridiculous but has at one time or other been written even by some Author of Reputation A Reflection it may not be improper for Writers to make as being at once some Mortification to their Vanity and some Comfort to their Infirmity  FINIS  blazon or coat of arms  DIEU ET MON DROIT  GEORGE R  GEORGE by the Grace of GOD King of  Great Britain France  and  Ireland  Defender of the Faith  c  To all to whom these Presents
