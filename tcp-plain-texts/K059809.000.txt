THE PREFACE  _THE unsufferable Behaviour of Servants in this Nation is now it may be hop'd come to its Height their Measure of Insolence I think may be said to be quite full  Private Families have struggled long with it the injur'd Reputation of Masters Mistresses YoungLadies and Gentlemen which has lain so long at the Mercy of their Servants Tongues has groan'd under it the Patience of the Heads of Families under the Rudeness and Insults they have suffer'd has been enough and indeed too much provok'd the poor Husbandman Artificer and Manufacturer have suffer'd sufficiently  in a Word  the Grievance is become national and calls aloud for a Remedy  I confess in the Beginning of this Work I seem'd to stand alone in the Complaint and some to whom I shew'd these  Sheets  tho' they own'd the Fact did not think it important enough to appear that it was below the Dignity of the Pen and wou'd not influence the World as I hop'd it wou'd to attempt a Cure  But those Gentlemen are since convinc'd of their Mistake and that they did not think it was an Evil of so extensive a Nature as it now appears to be they thought it only regarded  a few Citizens Wives and Tradesmens HouseMaids or a few Gentlemens Footmen  and the like  they did not imagine that the Husbandmen are ruin'd the Farmers disabled Manufacturers and Artificers plung'd to the Destruction of Trade and Stagnation of their Business and that no Men who in the Course of Business employ Numbers of the Poor can depend upon any Contracts they make or perform anything they undertake having no Law no Power to enforce their Agreement or to oblige the Poor to perform honestly what they are hir'd to do tho' ever so justly paid for doing it  They did not consider that the Peace of Families is ruin'd all Houshold Discipline at a full Stop and that such innumerable Disorders are the Consequences of this one Grievance that there was an absolute Necessity of some speedy Application for a Remedy  But in the middle of this Undertaking and after this Work had been a considerable time in the Press I had the Satisfaction to see that the whole Representative Body of  GreatBritain  concurr'd with my Opinion and that which to some seem'd not important enough for a Book of Complaint was found so significant as that the  House of Commons  thought it worth while to take it into their Consideration and to resolve upon Measures for its Redress  May those Resolutions end as we have Reason to hope they will in such Laws as shall effectually deliver us from this Burthen which I have too much Reason to say is become intollerable to to the whole Nation  THE Great LAW OF  Subordination consider'd  c  LETTER I  Dear Brother  _IT was formerly said of  England  by way of Proverb That it was  the Hell of Horses the Purgatory of Servants and the Paradise of  Women what might be the Case in former Days I know not but I must confess as things stand now I see no just Reason for that way of Speaking  As for  the Horses  I shall not trouble you much upon that Subject 'tis certain they have as great a quantity of Horseflesh here as any Nation in the World and as good a  Kind if not better considering that they excel in the Breeds of all the sorts of Horses together whereas other Nations are singlar to a sort some Nations have fine shap'd Horses as Spanish  Genets and Barbs  some swift Gallopers as the  Persians  some strong and vastly large CoachHorses as in  Handers  some good DraughtHorses as the  Swiss  others good Cuirassiers or Charging Horses as in  Holstein  and other Parts of  Germany  but  England  excels in all the Kinds together and no Nation goes beyond them  It is true the  English  have a great deal of Business for Horses and that almost in all Parts of the Island They have but little Inland Navigation and therefore not only their Husbandry requires the Labour of their Cattle but most part of the heavy Goods which are carried from Place to Place in Trade are carried by Land such as GroceryWare Corn Meal Malt Wine Oyl Wool and WoolenManufacturies  c  Also in many Places even their Metals and Minerals such as  Lead Iron Copper wrought Iron Stones  and even  Coals  and  Salt  and other weighty and bulky Goods are carried by LandCarriage so that the Horses in  England  do really work very hard and this perhaps may be the Cause of the old Saying that  England  is the  Hell of Horses  tho' I do not think it is just neither for this may really be said in the Case  that as the  English  work their Horses very hard so generally speaking they feed them very well and take Care of them well also and that better than in most Countries that I have been in so I do not think it can be said 'tis the Hell of Horses  but that by the way  As to  the Women  and  England's  being  the Paradise  of Women it chiefly relates to the good Customs and ancient Laws made in behalf of  the Ladies  by which they have better Provisions made for them by the Law with respect to their Claim to the Estates and the Effects of their Husbands after Death and to the Right of Division among the Heirs in Personal Estates and in some Copyholds and to a Right of Coheirship by the  Customs  of several Tenures and in several Cities and Corporations and the like I say better than in other Countries  But if we come to talk of  the good Usage of Wives  in  England  whether we speak of the generality of the Nation or of particular Persons I have not so much to say for them as perhaps they may expect the good Treatment of Wives in  England  is not such as may be much boasted of at present nor am I of the Opinion of the antient Writers here that used to boast of the Women of  England that if there was a Bridge over the  NarrowSeas  all the Women in  Christendom  would run over into England  In the first Place I must acknowledge that since Drunkenness is so much encreased in  England  to which we owe a great many other ill Customs which were never known in  England  before I say since this terrible eruption of Drinking in  England  the Usage of Wives in this Country is much alter'd from what it us'd to be in former Times and even in a few Years past You can not doubt but that Flood of Infatuation which has spread over the whole Kingdom in the manner I shall inform you of in its Turn has had its Effect not only upon the Morals but even upon the Sences and good Manners of the  English  Nation the very Blood and Nature of Men seems to be chang'd with their Temperance they have lost their Temper and with their Virtue so much of their good Humour for which they us'd to be so fam'd that they seem to be quite another Kind of People than their Ancestors were usually said to be and even than I myself remember them to be  In those Days as the ancient Fathers have reported things  at least to  me there was a Softness and Tenderness among them which I can see little of now  especially for the Women  they generally treated them with a courteous kind and respectful Manner different in many things from other Nations and it is to this kind benevolent Temper to which we owe all the antient Constitutions made in favour of the Women which they  talk so much of and with so good Reason  in England  for  in short  you see very little done in their behalf in the last fifty or sixty Years nay not in the last Century nor have they any great Prospect of new Favours 'tis well if they can retain the Privileges which the goodhumour'd Ages of their Ancestors left them possess'd of  For now the Case is quite alter'd FamilyGovernment is exceedingly chang'd if not inverted and the Men grow rigid surly cruel tyrannick and outrageous  in a Word  as it is the Cause of all the rest so the Word may well comprehend all the rest  they grow Drunken  and when I say that I have said all  The Effect of this is seen abundance of Ways in their Families for 'tis of that I am now speaking and particularly of their Conduct and Treatment of their Wives that they grow Sottish and Stupid more than ever and by that sordid way of living drink away their Understandings and even their Sences also to say nothing of their Substance and Estates by this they become Brutish and Sour in their Families and at best deprive their Wives and Daughters not only of their Care and Management on which the Prosperity of Families so much depends but of the Solace and Comfort of their relation of their Company and of all that Enjoyment which derives from what we call a Social Life  As Drunkenness has encreas'd so indeed the Comfort and FamilyHappiness of the Women in  England  are decreas'd in Proportion and in that very Article their  Paradise  if they had one before is in my Opinion very much alter'd and most of the Pleasure of it lost  But this is not all for as Extremes follow one another and one ill Habit may have a hundred ill Consequences so this new Usage of Drinking as it Stupifies and makes Sots of some so in others it affects the Passions fires the Blood raises their Spleen and sends Men home to their Families mad and outregeous so that instead of the kind mild and affable Temper which the  English  Nation used to be fam'd for  as to their Wives  the Men are now made a Terror to them and to their whole Families rageing storming and quarreling and too often fighting so that if you will believe themselves the Case of the Women in  England  is truly Deplorable and there is scarce a good Husband now to twenty that merited that Name in former Times nor was beating of Wives ever so much the Usage in  England  as it is now the Difference is manifest and they tell me that 'tis so frequent now especially among the meaner sort of People that to hear a Woman cry Murther now scarce gives any Alarm the Neighbours scarce stir at it and if they do if they come out in a Fright and ask one another what's the Matter and where is it  that they cry Murther the common Answer to one another is only thus 'tis nothing Neighbour but  such a one  a beating his Wife O  dear  says the other  is that all  and in they go again compos'd and easie as hearing a thing of no great Consequence that has no great Novelty in it nor much Danger and what if it had they don't much care to meddle with in a word 'tis so common a thing now to bully and abuse their Wives when they are in Drink that I believe I may say there are very few Men get Drunk but that they do quarrel with beat or misuse their Wives one way or other If this be their  English Paradise  the Women here may enjoy it by themselves I believe none of the Wives in our Country will trouble them or crowd in upon them for a Share of the Enjoyment  But this is not my present Design neither the Women's Case is too long for this Undertaking and deserves to be consider'd by itself It is added that as  England  is the  Paradise of Women  so it is the  Purgatory of Servants  This I object against more than I do that of Women nay I exclaim against it nothing is more certain than that as the Women's Case is made worse by the change of their Usage among us so that of the Servants is infinitely varied the other Way and we must allow that the Proverb should be turn'd and we should say it is the  Purgatory of Wives  and the  Paradise of Servants  and this is the  Subject I intend to entertain you with for some time  Nothing is more visible nor indeed breaks in so far upon our Civil Affairs in this Nation as the surprizing Difference that there is in the Behaviour of Servants of every Rank and Degree among us from what it was in former Times from what it is now in other Nations and from what indeed in the Nature of the thing ought to be everywhere The Complaint is so general and the Grievance so very notorious that I need enter into no Search after Evidence of Fact I shall therefore give you some general Account of it in this Letter and descend to Particulars hereafter  By Servants you are to understand me to mean the several Denominations hereafter mention'd for I am not going to entertain you with a long Complaint of a few Footmen and Cookwenches but the Grievance possesses the whole Body of the Nation and all that bear the Name of Servant may be said to be more or less concern'd  Apprentices as well the Apprentices to Merchants and more eminent TradesMen as the Apprentices to meaner People such as ShopKeepers Handicrafts Artificers Manufacturers  c    Menial Servants  such as Cooks Gardeners Butlers Coachmen Grooms Footmen Pages MaidServants Nurses  c  all kept within Doors at Bed and Board that is to say such as have Yearly or Monthly Wages with Meat Drink Lodging and Washing  Clerks to Lawyers Attorneys Scriveners  c  and to Gentlemen in publick Offices and the like I shall speak of the Labouring Poor that is of Servants  without Doors  in a Letter by itself for I have much also to say of them I assure you  In every one of these there appears a visible and important Difference in almost every Article which relate to them as Servants by Difference I mean between them and Servants of the same Class in former Years  The first and last of these already nam'd I mean  Merchants Apprentices  and  Lawyers Clerks  might indeed be said always to have some particular Regard shew'd them as being oftentimes the Sons of considerable Families bred something above the ordinary Rate of Servants and that gave large Sums to their Masters in order to be introduc'd into a capital Business which they were likely to have considerable Stocks of their own to carry on yet these differ too very much  In former times it was usual to give great Sums I say with Apprentices to Merchants but then those Sums were call'd great in those times which are accounted but small Sums now the Reason of that I need not examine  however I say great Sums were given to principal Merchants as particularly  l  and sometimes but very rarely and more lately  l  to eminent  Turkey  Merchants To the more considerable  Spanish  and  Italian  Merchants from  l  to  l  and these were the firstrate  Premio's  that were given in the City of  London  for about or Years ago nor if I am inform'd Right was ever more than  l  given with an Apprentice to the best  Turkey  Merchant in  London  before the Year or thereabout and to other Merchants such as  Dutch French Hamburg  and  EastCountry  Merchants in Proportion to Shopkeepers of the first Rank as Linnen and WoollenDrapers Mercers wholesale Grocers and other considerable Dealers  l  and afterwards  l  and so of other Trades in their Proportion also  But now such a strange Change is there upon the Face of things that 'tis very ordinary to give a thousand Pound with an Apprentice to a  Turkey  Merchant  l  to  l  to other Merchants from to to Shopkeepers and wholesale Dealers LinnenDrapers especially and so in Proportion to other Trades and the like with Clerks to Lawyers Attornies Scriveners  c  As the  Premio's  given with such Servants as these are thus strangely differing from what was formerly done so the Usage of these kinds of Servants in the Families where they are taken differs also and so in Proportion  does their Services they are employ'd in differ it may be alledg'd that upon their Masters demanding such great Sums of Money with their Apprentices they have reason to treat them as Gentlemen and not as Servants to let them see that they are rather brought into their CountingHouses as Pupils to a Tutor and Scholars or Students to a College than as Servants that their Business is to be introduc'd handsomely and reputably into Business sent Abroad and receiv'd into the management of Affairs and not indeed to be accounted or call'd Servants or to be us'd as such and this may be granted but still it breaks into the great Foundation the Rule of  Subordination  which I say is essential to all FamilyOeconomy and these Youths should be called Lodgers not Apprentices or Servants for as their coming in differs  as above  in a much greater Proportion does their Behaviour and Conduct differ the Consequence of which in a great measure is that more of them are ruin'd debauch'd and come to nothing for want of Subordination and being under Government than was wont to be the Case to the great Calamity of their Families especially of their Parents of which abundince of lamentable Examples might be given but neither is this the particular Design of these Letters which is more especially to give you a Sketch of  LowLife  and describe to you the horrible degencracy of the meaner sort of Servants and the mischiefs  which this Nation suffers upon that Account  From these kinds of Servants therefore  I mean Apprentices to Merchants WholesaleMen and the like  I must descend to the Apprentices of meaner Tradesmen and yet not of the labouring Trades neither that is to say the Handicrafts Artificers and the like they remain to be mention'd by themselves  It is but few Years ago and in the Memory of many now living that all the Apprentices of the Shopkeepers and Warehousekeepers as well in  London  as in other Places except the few mention'd before submitted to the most servile Employments of the Families in which they serv'd such as the  young Gentry  their Successors in the the same Station scorn so much as the Name of now such as  cleaning  their Masters Shoes bringing  Water  into the Houses  from the Conduits  in the Street which they carried on their Shoulders in long Vessels call'd Tankards also waiting at Table waiting on their Masters to the Church and carrying their Bibles PrayerBooks  c  and many more such things  whereas now  the Apprentices of the very same Class are so far from stooping to such things as these that 'tis very rarely that they will condescend to open or shut the Shopwindows much less to sweep the Shop or Warehouses but their Masters are oblig'd to keep Porters or Footmen to wait upon the Apprentices and do all those things for them so far are they  now from cleaning their Masters Shoes that the Apprentices scorn to clean their own Shoes but there are poor Women generally attending at the ShopDoors to do those things as well for the Apprentices as for the Masters and are paid for it so far are they from being subjected to their Masters or to their Family Discipline that they think it hard to have any Enquiry made after them when they go out and keep oftentimes later Hours than their Masters and as often are pleas'd to come home in Drink which also their Masters have scarce the Authority to resent or question them about  This unsufferable  Liberty  is not so much granted by the Master as it is assum'd by the Apprentices and if at any times Words happen between them 'tis very seldom but that the Servant is as high as the Master and scorning to give an Account of his Excursions takes it very ill to be examin'd and much worse to be restrain'd and tho' perhaps they may reply in Language a little more decent than meaner Fellows talk in yet they shall not fail to tell their Masters they did not give such Sums of Money to be confin'd like Prisoners or to be used like Footboys and that if they the Masters do not like their Service as they wou'd call it they are willing to be otherwise dispos'd of not forgetting to add that if the Master consents to Part with them they expect Part of their Money back again  and the like  intimating that the Master will  bear with their Disorders rather than part with them and refund  The Effect of this Insolence for I can call it no less is that there are more of these Servants call'd Apprentices ruin'd by these  Liberties  than one would think it was possible cou'd be found in the whole City all manner of Wickednesses are practised by them and as they are generally but Youths have their Pockets unadvisedly supplied with Monies by their Relations and thus assume Time and  Liberty  to spend it they indulge themselves in all sorts of  Liberties  This has been so Examplar on many Occasions that never was so many Masters robb'd by their Apprentices as now and I think I might give an Account of or young Clerks and Apprentices that have been Hang'd here in  London  or near it within these few Years besides innumerable others ruin'd by the many several Ways of being undone of which this Town affords them perhaps more than any other Place in the World  The next Head or Class is that of the lower  Menial Servants  and here whatever is the Occasion we find the Wages of almost all sorts of Servants doubled and of some trebbled as in the Article before but for the Behaviour of these People their Sauciness Drunkenness and abusive Language on the side of the MenServants the gaiety fine Cloaths Laces Hoops  c  of the MaidServants nay even to Patches and Paint are hardly to be describ'd it would be a Satyr  upon the Ladies such as perhaps they would not bear the reading of should we go about to tell how hard it is sometimes to know the ChamberMaid from her Mistress or my Lady's ChiefWoman from one of my Lady's Daughters nor can she bear to be call'd any thing less than Mistress by the rest of the Servants or is it altogether improper as I shall shew in its Place  From this gaiety of Dress must necessarily follow Encrease of Wages for where there is such an Expence in Habit there must be a proportion'd Supply of Money or it will not do  The Pocket thus furnish'd and the Back thus cloath'd and the Servant thus exalted how can it be expected she shou'd not be above herself much more above her Business and most of all  which is to my Purpose  above Reproof to be talk'd to is to hear how Saucy she can be and as she is impatient of being told when she is in a Fault so she is sure to be in as many such Faults as ever Servants can be suppos'd to have been  But as abundance of Faults are protected by a Saucy Tongue and every Master or Mistress may not be quallified to scold with their Footmen and Chambermaids so they rather wink at the more venial Mistakes of their Servants than be troubled with their Clamour  Thus I have made my first Letter a kind of Index of my whole Design and you will see how you must be prepar'd to read a black  History of the Degeneracy of  English  Servants I shall illustrate it with some Examples as they occur to my Observations and are apposite to the Cases where I relate them  In the mean Time how happy are you in  France  in this Particular tho' in many other you do not come up to the  English  as in the solid Security of Property and of Religion  c  but in this you outdo  England  indeed for your Servants are indeed Servants a  French  Footman if he was to write to his Master might well subscribe your  Humble Servant  even in the literal Sence of it for your Servants are Humble and you keep them so they are taught a due Subordination as their Introduction and you hold them to it and I am sure  France  is in the right of it  But here there is no such thing as a good Servant in the true Sence of the Word whither the monstrous Evil may spread and what may be the Effect if some Laws are ot speedily made to regulate the Office of a Servant and to prescribe to them their Bounds sorm them into Classes and then oblige them to do the Duty of a Servant I say how far it may spread who can tell  But when I talk of Laws to regulate this I talk of a thing the most difficult to be done of anything of that kind that I know in  England  I shall take up your Time a little upon the Subject hereafter  I am  c  Dear Sir Your Brother and humble Servant  LETTER II  Dear Sir  BEing  as by my last  to give you some Account of the Conduct of  LowLife  in this Country  where it differs so much from all the rest of the World  I propos'd to begin it by way of Preliminary that as I have already laid down Heads of the Grievance in general so I may now lead you a little to the Fountain from whence it flows and the manifest Degrees by which it is swell'd to such a Height as almost to overwhelm the National Oeconomy and embarrass our Families in constant Vexation and Disorder  As I hinted in my last the miserable Circumstance of this Country is now such that in short if it goes on the Poor will be Rulers over the Rich and the Servants be Governours of their Masters the  Plebeij  have almost mobb'd the  Patricij  and as the Commons in another Case may be said to be gotten above the Lords so the Cannaille of this Nation impose Laws upon their Superiours and begin not only to be troublesome but in time may be dangerous in a word Order is inverted Subordination ceases and the World seems to stand with the Bottom upward  How and by what Steps things have been brought to this Height and from whence all  this Disorder proceeds  tho' it may be Difficult to find out all the Springs and Causes which have assisted in it  yet some Part of it may be seen in the following Particulars which are the Preliminaries I mentioned in my last  I AS the People here are universally bless'd with real and valuable  LIBERTY  more than any Nation in the World SO the common sort are withal so possess'd with mistaken Notions of that LIBERTY in general and of their own  Legal Liberties  in Particular that it runs them upon the most preposterous Follies imaginable particularly abusing that  Liberty  to indulge their Wickedness suggesting that Liberty is a Freedom to Crime not a Security against Oppression and Injustice  II AS the common People  not Exclusive of a great Part of the Nobility and Gentry  are miserably overwhelm'd in a Dreadful Innundation of Vice and Immorality infinitely more than was the Case in former Days SO the particular Vices which are most concern'd in the present Complaint are those two above all the rest  namely  Drunkeness and prophane Swearing  To the Account of these two I place the Guilt of almost all the Evils that I am now to speak of what additional Helps may have  been had from other and lesser Excursions of the Poor miserable People who I am going to describe I may speak to as I go on I will not say but that as all the little Brooks and Currents descending from the rising Grounds adjacent to a River assist to swell the Stream of that River into a Flood so there may be many other smaller Helps from Hell to prompt the ruin of a Nation's Peace but these two like the principal Channels support the main Current  It is from these that the Passions are rais'd Men put out of their own Government and the general Temper of the People as I said in my last chang'd and alter'd it is from hence that Calm that Sobriety that Kindness and goodness of Humour which formerly was the fam'd Disposition of the People of  England  is  chang'd  and become  violent  and  outrageous  from these come contempt of Government quarrellings and fighting with one another insulting Masters Employers and every Degree of Superiors and in a word innumerable other Disorders to the breaking off all manner of Discipline and Regulation the abuse of themselves and the destroying the common Peace and good Neighbourhood of the People one with another  If in describing this I come to let you see the several Steps by which these things have encroach'd upon the Conduct of the meaner Sort among as how and by what fatal Degrees their Manners were first deprav'd and to what Extreme they are since  hurried on I flatter myself it will be both diverting and informing and you will not think your time lost in reading my Letters however tedious they may otherwise be  LIBERTT  is the Glory of an  Englishman  'tis as Natural to him to desire it as 'tis lawful to him to maintain it 'tis his Inheritance purchas'd with the Blood of his Ancestors and as 'tis his Portion so 'tis his Pride but 'tis with an  Englishman  about his Liberty as 'tis with many of them about Popery there is a kind of national Aversion among them to Popery 'tis the universal Scarecrow the Hobgoblin the Spectre with which the Nurses fright the Children and entertain the old Women all over the Country by which means such horror posesses the Minds of the common People about it that I believe there are an stout Fellows who would spend the last Drop of their Blood against Popery that do not know whether it be a Man or a Horse  In like manner  Liberty  is a word of Endearment 'tis the Hereditary Favourite of the People 'tis the Nation's Mistress I was a going to say it was the Nation's Whore in a Word 'tis talk'd of by everybody valu'd by everybody and understood almost by nobody this  English  Liberty is as blindly espous'd as I said Popery was blindly hated by those who mistake it in the grosest manner  This leads me to the Conduct of our ignorant People in the claim they make to this thing call'd  Liberty  and their scandalous Management of it on many Occasions  Pray take me right as I go along that I am talking now chiefly of the common People tho' tis too true that even among the better Sort there are too many whose Notions of Liberty are not only inconsistent with true Liberty but destructive of it for nothing is more certain than that true Liberty consists in a freedom to do well not giving a Loose to the Passions gratifying every vitious Gust and taking off the Restraint of Laws leaving every Man to do what is right in his own Eyes  What the People's Notions of Liberty are I shall best describe by giving you some historical Examples of the Behaviour among the Common People such as have come within the compass of my own Observation  England  is certainly in its constituted Liberties the best Nation for any Subject in the World to live in where the Laws which are their Protection are likewise their Inheritance but then for the contempt of those Laws and abuse of Liberty I must say that no Nation I have been in comes up to them I'll venture to give you a double Example of this in one and the same Story the Case happen'd with in the Verge of my own House and among my own Neighbours as follows  You know there are very severe Laws against prophane Swearing in this Country and the Legislature to do them Justice have often repeated those Laws  and to add to their Sanction  have made additional Clauses to oblige the Magistrate to put those Laws in Execution  and yet I believe  Common or Customary Swearing  is no where in the World more frequent and that of a Kind particular to the  English  Nation or perhaps to the  English  Tongue namely to imprecate Damnation upon themselves a thing not only highly prophane and wicked but absurdly so especially in that way they practise it here  Several Nations are addicted to the wicked Custom of Cursing besides  England  and especially when they are angry with or provok'd at a Person but then they will curse that Person pretty freely and 'tis too much the Practice in common Discourse to curse one another  but here  when a Man is angry with another he curses himself he does not say  Damn you Sir  but  Damn me Sir  which is one of the foolishest as well as wickedest Ways of Speaking that can be imagin'd  Now this way of swearing and cursing is so frequent here among all sorts of People that I believe I do the  English  no Wrong in saying no Nation in  Europe  are guilty of it to such a Degree of Madness and Absurdity  Nor is this the Vice of the common People only but 'tis among the Gentry the Quality and which is still worse the Magistrates so that nothing is more frequent than to hear those very Men swear who the Law obliges by Virtue of their Office to punish Men for swearing in a word the Law is not executed because those who have the executive Power of the Law in their Hands are guilty of the very Crime which they ought to punish and  this I Mention here because it brings on the Story I refer to above which is a double Example as well of the Contempt of the Law against swearing as of the false Notion of Liberty  I had a little Affair one Day with a Gentleman here that is my Neighbour which occasion'd some Words between us but the Interposition of Friends stopt it before it came to any Height and we are since that very good Friends again  but I name it on this Account  my Neighbour's Servant had let some Horses break into my Ground and I had frequently caused them to be only turn'd out again without any Complaint other than speaking to the Servant to prevent it for the future but I was surpriz'd afterwards to find that the Servant was so far from endeavouring to prevent it that in the Night he turn'd his Master's Horses in himself and a Person I set to watch him took him in the Fact  Upon this I Pounded the Horses and went to my Neighbour and complain'd but instead of finding him ready to do me Justice I observ'd him very much concernd about it took it very ill that I shou'd Pound his Cattle began to justifie his Servant and added that he was a very honest Fellow I was surpriz'd at that and when he said his Man was very Honest I told him I did not believe him to be an honest Fellow  He lost his Patience at this and with a Heat no otherwise to be exprest than by repeating  his mad Words reply'd  Dam me Sir  what d'ye mean not believe me  Dam me  what not believe me  Dam me Sir  I can't take that what Sir  Dam me  do you give me the Lye  Dam me  Sir what d'ye mean  Upon these Words thus awkwardly put together and so repeated he gets up walks up and down the Room fretting and fumeing with twenty more  Damme  's at last he ends it all with coming up to my Teeth and letting fly at me with  Dam me Sir explain yourself  I kept my self as cool as I cou'd but was oblig'd to show that I was not frighted at him so with a kind of Smile I said I shou'd have explain'd myself with out his Damming so often if he had given me Room to crow'd in a Word among his Curses  This provok'd him more than I intended it shou'd and he flew out at me then with the like Number of  Damme  's all over again or rather twice as many for my Laughing  Dam me  Sir what d'ye Laugh at me and  Dam me  Sir am I to be Laught at and the like  But to carry the Tale no farther than is to the Purpose that I am writing of I then told him the Fact and that I had not said I did not believe him but that I did not believe his Man was honest and that my Reason was because I had catch'd him opening my Gate with his own Hands and driving the Horses into my Field and that I had brought the Person who see him do it to Witness against him  Upon this my Neighour was as calm and as civil as cou'd be desir'd for awhile and begg'd my Pardon for being warm before after which the two Servants were call'd in and heard and my Man testify'd as above his Servant impudently deny'd it and my Man as positively affirm'd it but with this he flies out in the same Rage at my Man as he was in before at me and then it was  Dam me  I won't believe a Word you say you are a lying Dog you see my Man denies it my Servant then offer'd to go before a Justice and swear it then he flew out again you swear it you are a Rascal  G Dam me  I won't believe your Oath no more than your Word and there he went storming and swearing and rageing about the House and calling my Man a thousand Dogs and Villains and between every two or three Words was the imprecation upon himself of  Gd Dam me  Now had he said always  Dam you  instead of  Dam me  tho' it had been Wicked in it self to call upon God to Damn any body and very Unchristian too to curse his Neighbour yet it had had some shew of Sence in it it had not been both Wicked and Absurd too but that it now seems to be of Use only to show the Dominion that our Passions have above our Reason that they content themselves to talk the grosest Nonsence so it does but give vent to the Rage that posesses the Mind at that time for they will frequently call upon God in their Passion in the same kind of Heat to Damn  their Horses their Dogs or any thing that offends them whether it has a Life of Sence or vegetative Life or no Life at all  In a word 'tis so much a Custom now in  England  to Rage and Damn and Curse in this Manner that they not only do it without regard to Reason and Sence but which is still more wonderful they do it without Thought without being in any Passion or under any Provocation nay they do it without Anger and without any Distaste without any Evil in their Design  that is to say  without thinking atall but as in meer Jest and Mirth  But to return to my Neighbour as I told you some Friends overhearing the Quarrel made us Friends again as to the Matter in dispute and one of them a grave sober Gentleman took the Liberty in a mannerly and courteous Manner to speak to him about his frequent swearing and cursing and how ill it was for him to do so who was a Person of Years of Learning and Breeding and the like he defended himself awhile by saying  he thought no Harm  the usual Defences the  English  Gentleman make for it and which generally is very true but when the other Gentleman carry'd it a little further and press'd him to restrain himself in such unlawful Excesses and he cou'd not tell what to say more than he had said he seem'd a little warm and answer'd Sir I am an  Englishman and I love Liberty  pray let me alone I must have my  Liberty  I shou'd have told you while this happen'd my Servant to whom as I said he was very passionate was mightly affronted at being call'd such ill Names and I heard him so very high among his FellowServants in the next Room that I went out to see what was the matter my Man told me in short that what I said to him at any time was nothing for I was his Master but he hop'd I would not expect he shou'd take it from  Esq  that he would not be call'd Dog and Rogue and Rascal by ne'er a Gentleman in the Country that he valued his Reputation as much as  Esq  at any time and that his Livelyhood depended upon it that if he was one that would Swear any thing and was not fit to be believ'd upon his Oath he was not fit for any Gentleman's Service and he cou'd not blame any Gentleman for refusing him if he had such a Character and therefore he was resolv'd to do himself Justice  I knew that really all the Fellow said was true that he was very much injur'd and that he was indeed a very honest Fellow in the main and a good Servant as Servants in  England  go now so I gave him good Words and seeing he was heated and that he had just Cause to be a little mov'd I endeavour'd to calm him but I found it would not do he insisted that he was resov'd to do himself Justice why you Fool you  says I  what do you mean by doing your self Justice you don't pretend to put yourself upon an equal Foot  with this Gentleman and go and demand Satisfaction of him do you  No Sir says he  I know myself better than that too but is there no way that a poor Servant may take to do himself Justice when he is injur'd but presently to Fight with his Superiors I will do myself Right without Fighting  says he  I look'd earnestly at him upon those Words  What way can you take  says I  Why Sir  says he  in the first Place I will make him pay for swearing I hope the Law will bear me out in that  I mus'd awhile and it presently occur'd to me that if my Man did make Oath that he swore times besides his cursing he would do him no wrong but yet that if he did so it would renew the Quarrel between my Neighbour and I for he would presently say it was all my doing so I did all that lay in my Power to perswade my Man to put it up and let him alone besides  William says I  you know he is a powerful Man in this Part of the County and if ever he meets you he will certainly run you Thoro' in the mean time his Men will abuse you and insult you and you will have no fair Play with them  But I found my Man was too Warm to be mov'd by all such Perswasions as these nor was that all but he would stay for the Gentleman's coming out to talk with him again this I took up and told him I would have no Gentlman affronted by any Servant of mine Well Sir  says he very short  then while I am your Servant I won't say anything  to him but then I hope you will dismiss me from your Service this Minute for I must do myself Justice  No Sir says I angrily  I shan't dismiss you just now neither why then Sir says he I hope you won't take it amiss that I dismiss myself and from this Minute I am your Servant no longer and as I am a FreeBorn  Englishman  and no Slave I live in a Free Nation and must have my  LIBERTY  O Liberty  said I to my self  thou art a brave Article to set Servants above their Masters if I had this Fellow in  France  now or in  Germany  or any where but in  England  I knew very well how to handle him but here I must submit to my Servants  All this I say was only a Reflection in my own Thought but I recover'd that Confusion his Sauciness had put me into and I answer'd him calmly  Well William you shall be dismiss'd  so I begun to ask him what Wages was due to him which was not above two Months and I paid him and order'd another Servant to take an Account of some things that were in his Custody and let him go but now  William says I  as you have dismiss'd yourself from my Service so you must let me dismiss you out of Doors too for I will not have you insult the Gentleman in my House I saw this was some Uneasiness to him but I would not stir from him till he had stript my Livery off put on his Frock and went off  As he went away he began to Triumph for he was now grown not saucy only but impudent  and clapping his RightHand to his Left Shoulder two or three times  now I am my own Man again  says he now I am at Liberty again Sir and Liberty is the Birthright of an  Englishman Well William says I to him  for I overheard him but take Care how you make use of it do not abuse your Liberty your being an  Englishman  and having a right to the Liberty of an  Englishman  does not make you Equal to a Gentleman take Care how you behave you know there's a WhipingPost in the Parish  William  yes yes Sir says he I know it and will take Care I will indeed and here he repeated it two or three times in a scoffing saucy Tone  I will take Care  I will Sir  but I will speak with  Esq  for all that Sir  Look you  William says I  do not be illmanner'd in my House if you do I will lay you by the Heels myself I do say again you shall not speak to him in my House  This made him be a little civiler but yet it was not without some Difficulty that I got him out of my House and the Fellow was so heated with the Usage he had and so Drunk with his Notion of being now at  Liberty  that he was as much out of his Senses as if he had been Drunk indeed with Liquor  However at last I got him out of my House and sent another Servant after him to see whither he went for I had a mind to see what he intended to do it was not above half an Hour before my other Man came in  and told me that  William  went directly to Justice 's and offered to depose that the Gentleman had Sworn Oaths  The Justice endeavour'd with all his Might to prevent his Swearing to it in regard to the Gentleman that he swore against who was his Friend and question'd him so many Ways that he had almost puzzled the Fellow and once or twice he was going away to see for another Justice telling that Justice that the Law gave him  Liberty  and he was an  Englishman  and wou'd have  his Liberty  and as long as he was sure he swore nothing but the Truth he would not be directed that he came there to swear to the Truth and he would take the Hazard of what follow'd  However the Justice by good Words and Perswasions brought him down to threescore and he would come down no lower but appeal'd to me and desir'd the Justice to ask me so the Justice took his Oath and dismiss'd him after this the Justice seeing another of my Servants there  as above  beckon'd to him to stay and when the Fellow was gone he bade him desire of me that I would call and see him in the Evening  In the mean time the first Gentleman staid in my House I had given him an Account of all that had happen'd and much Difficulty I had to keep him from going out to chastise this Fellow as he call'd it himself however I did prevail with him for indeed as I knew the Fellow would be sawcy and that the  Gentleman was warm also and passionate I was afraid he should kill him and I was willing to prevent that kind of Mischief  But I was deliver'd from my Anxiety for a Time by the following Accident The Gentleman had two Servants that waited while their Master was with me and they overheard the Account my Servant had given me of what  William  had done and they walk'd out into the Street of their own Accord for I can bear their Master witness he knew nothing of it and finding  William  loitering about in the Street one of them went up to him and ask'd him what was the Matter and what he did there  William  answer'd very surlily that he waited there to speak with his Master meaning  Esq  my Master  says the Servant  What do you mean by that don't you know where my Master lives can't you come to his House what do you pretend to waylay him in the Street If you have anything to say to my Master come to Morrow Morning and I'll engage my Master will let you speak to him  William  now began to be more in the Wrong than he had been in the Right before for I could not say but that at first  William  was in the Right  But as the Servant talk'd thus far very calmly and rationally to  William  so  William  talk'd hot and high told the Fellow his Master had abus'd him  William  without a Cause and that he was not a Servant now  but at Liberty and he would not be abus'd by any Gentleman whatever and he would speak with him  ay that he would  Very well  says the Servant  jeeringly so you are now my Master's Equal are you and you intend to demand Satisfaction of him do you Pray where's your Sword  Esq  William  where's your Sword  Liberty  has made you a Gentleman I find that and Gentlemen never go without a Sword  Well Mr Servitor  says William  if I am not your Master's Fellow you are not my Fellow neither till you have stript off your Livery as I have done your Master has abus'd me and I took it from him but I won't take it from you  My Master abus'd you Sirrah my Master abuses nobody  says the Servant  Yes  says William  he has abus'd me and he shall know it too as soon as I can see him  You  Dog  you  says the Servant  do you threaten  my Master  What do you wait here to assassinate him Prethee  John says he to his Fellow  go fetch a Constable I'll take Care of  Esq  William  since he won't stay till to Morrow Morning to speak with our Master I'll secure him for to Night and he shall wait for him in the Cage  Away goes  John  for a Constable but while he was gone  William  grew very insolent and giving the Servant ill Language and upon his Master too they fell from one Word to another and then to Blows and tho'  William  was a stout Fellow of his Hands yet the other Fellow was too hard for him and  William  was upon the Point of yielding when the Constable came and carried them both before the Justice the same before whom  William  had been swearing  William  was as high before the Justice as he was before with the Gentleman's Servant and behav'd not only warm but impudent he was a  FreeMan  he said and not a  Slave  and if a Gentleman had injur'd him he wou'd be at Liberty to tell him so  The Justice perswaded him and told him he ought to be quiet till another time as the Footman had perswaded him to be that to stay in the Street and talk as he had done was threatning the Gentleman and that he ought to be search'd if he had no Weapons about him  William  offer'd himself to be search'd and indeed he had no Weapons nor did he intend to do any thing but to be saucy with his Tongue which he might have paid dear enough for too as I observ'd but the Justice took Care of him for that Night and the next Morning made him bring Sureties for the Peace the Servant making Oath that he gave both his Master and him too threatning Language of his being reveng'd and the like  The rest of the Story is short  viz William  was humbled for the Liberty of his Tongue but the Gentleman was forced to pay for his threescure Oaths and so for that time  William  had no great Benefit of his being Freeborn or an  Englishman  But  William  is not the only Example of the prostituting this glorious thing call'd  English Liberty  to the basest Purpose I must tell you another Story which happen'd in the Compass of my own Family too  I had a Steward or as the  English  call them a Baily who look'd after a small Concern which I have in the Country and who I trusted with the whole Management of it to such a Degree that he had several Workmen and Servants employ'd by me under him and whose Business was left to his Care and Inspection  This Fellow I had a particular Confidence in and a very good Opinion of and' very unwilling I was to hear any Accusation against him and the more because several things that had been alledg'd against him when they came to be enquir'd into and examin'd were sound either so trivial as to be not worth Notice or he so effectually clear'd himself that nothing cou'd be fasten'd upon him  But one of my Servants who I employ'd in another Business remote from that where this Steward was employ'd came very seriously to me one Morning with a sad Complaint  viz  that his Wife had been gone from him some time and that tho' he had with the utmost Application search'd her wicked Haunts and had for some Years suspected it and been assur'd of it from others that she kept Company  with my said Steward yet he cou'd never come at a Certainty of it till now that now he was fully perswaded it was so and hop'd I would do him so much Justice as to put a Check to it  I smil'd at the weakness of his last Request tho' I pity'd the poor Man in the former part of his Disaster for says I you know 'tis out of my Power If my Man will be wicked I have no Power to restrain him as if your Wife will be a Whore you see you cannot restrain her Liberty  you know  in  England says I  is too often claim'd for a Freedom to do wickedly and what can I do for you  Besides says I but what Proof is there of the Fact for what can I pretend to talk to him about when upon his denying the Fact  as to be sure he will  I shou'd produce no Evidence my Mouth  said I  will be stopt he own'd he had no positive Proof to produce but he gave me such particular Discoveries that I was convinc'd it was really so as well as he so I told him I would talk with the Stewart about it  Accordingly one Morning I took the Liberty after other Discourse of Business was over to tell my Steward what Rumour was rais'd upon his Conversation with such a Man's Wife and that they said he was so open and barefac'd in it that he kept her at such a Place and so told him other Circumstances which began to put him hard to it however he deny'd it very stifly look ye said I if  it is so I am very sorry for it and I expect you will consider of it He answer'd after again denying it that he had always taken Care of my Business and hop'd I would be satisfied with that and that I would not enter into other Matters and listen to the false Accusations of his Enemies who were his Enemies chiefly because he took Care that they shou'd not abuse and impose upon me and so in a Word did as good as say that if he minded my Business I had no Right to meddle with him any further  I took him a little short there and told him that it was true that I had no Power to examine him or to punish him if he was guilty but that if the thing was true it was really an Insult upon me and my Family the Woman's Husband as he knew being a Relation to me at some distance tho' he was my Servant too and that as he was also intrusted and employ'd by me he might depend I shou'd think it hard that one who receiv'd so many Benefits from me should have so little Respect for me as to debauch a Woman who was Marry'd to one of my Relations and should do it as it were under my Nose  He reply'd tho' with Respect that he hop'd I would not think myself concern'd in the Clamour that as he did not own he was guilty of any such thing and nobody cou'd prove it he desir'd I would not believe any thing of it till it was prov'd  I told him as to Proof in Law it was none of my Business but that I doubted there was Proof enough to make it reasonable to believe it and that it was not sufferable he told me in so many Words that he thought it was hard to be examin'd so close about it that he took Care to mind my Business and cou'd not be charg'd with omitting it as to other things he was an  Englishman  and desir'd to have his  LIBERTY  and so my Man and I parted  This is the Use or rather these are some of the Uses they make of Liberty in this Part of the World I'll trouble you with but one Example more and dismiss this Part in the late Queen's Reign when the Earl of  Gallaway  commanded the  British  Troops in  Spain  sent thither as Auxilliaries to King  Charles  now Emperor the Army begining to grow sickly it was said the Soldiers got the Flux by eating Grapes and other green Fruit  Upon this the General publish'd an Order that the Soldiers should not eat any Grapes for a certain time upon Pain of Death and none of the Suttlers or Peasants were allowed to bring any Grapes into the Camp upon the like Penalties  But as  Englishmen  are not fam'd for being the most easie to be restrain'd in such Cases so some of the  English  Soldiers had got out of the Camp and not being able to refrain the tempting Fruit had gorg'd themselves with Grapes and three of them fell  Sick of the Flux upon which the General sent to have them brought before him but when the Officers came to fetch them truly they were so near being dead tho' not dead that they were not in a Condition to be stirr'd and I think two of them died that Night however one of them being told the General had sent for them and being ask'd if he had eaten any Grapes he boldly answer'd yes at which the Officer asking how they durst presume to break the General's Orders adding that if he recover'd he would certainly be hang'd the Fellow answer'd as for hanging there was no need to hang them they were dead Men already and as to the General's Orders they had obey'd him in every thing relating to their Business as Soldiers but as to the rest they were  ENGLISHMEN  and thought they ought to have their  LIBERTY  and that they had a Right to kill themselves whenever they pleas'd  It seems they all died and so prevented Justice for the Excuse was of no Weight because the Prince has a Right to the Service of his Subjects and no Man can kill himself without a Crime against his Sovereign as well as against Heaven But 'tis apposite to my Purpose namely the Notion we have of  Liberty  here and the Abuse of that  Liberty  Be pleas'd to observe now that when I speak of  Liberty  being abus'd in  England  I keep my Eye principally upon the Morals of the Nation upon the Abuse of the Laws made  for the Preservation of good Manners among Men and the Encouragement given by the Negligence of those who ought to punish the Breakers of those Laws  There are several Sorts of Liberty which are grossly abus'd here as well as this  for Example  First  Religious Liberty  it is true I that abhor Persecution for Religion do not complain of this as if there ought not to be a  Liberty  granted to conscientious Christians to worship God in the Manner which they believe to most agreeable to his Will and most edifying to themselves but I cannot but think that  Liberty  grossly abus'd when 'tis made use of to protect those who deny all Reveal'd Religion who instead of a  Liberty  in Religion claim a  Liberty  to be of no Religion atall  I observe the Toleration of Dissenters which is what they found their Religious  Liberties  upon is commonly call'd an Act for  Liberty of Conscience  in my Opinion that very Title explains the Meaning of the Law that it is to give  Liberty  to Tender Consciences  to worship God  c as I say above This cannot import a Liberty to harden'd Consciences to worship  no God at all  and to sear neither  GOD  or  Devil  There are great Disputes about Religion in this Nation as well as in other Places perhaps more here than anywhere else but the Dispute I take Notice of is not between this and that Religion or this and that Sect or Opinion in Religion but betwixt  GOD  and  Devil  a Man shall come into my Company and blaspheme God deny his Redeemer and make a Mock of all Religion and then tell me he is an  Englishman  and claims  Liberty  that there is a Law to give Liberty of Conscience  c  this is unsufferable and Liberty of Conscience has nothing to do in the Case the Man both by the Laws of God and of all Christian Nations ought to be punished there's nothing of Religion or Conscience in the Case  There is a Parallel Case in this very same Constitution and Government we have a perticular Liberty here and what we value ourselves very much upon and this is call'd  the Liberty of the PRESS  that is to say that every Man is at Liberty to Print and Publish what he pleases  But notwithstanding all this  Liberty  of the Press the Government frequently take up both  Authors  and  Printers  if they Printany thing offensive or against the  Administration  or if they publish any Personal Reflections the Person injur'd if these Reflections are unjust and slanderous has a Right to prosecute the Publisher and Author and will have his Remedy at Law  Again the Government claim to resent injurious Reproaches Sarcasms and Satyrs upon any foreign Prince or State in alliance with  England  and may oblige the Authors and Publishers to answer for all such Indecencies  for Example  one Author and a  Frenchman  too who wrote a Publick Paper was taken up here for printing that the  Duke of Luxemberg  was  Humpshoulder'd and yet you and I that have seen him so often at the Head of the  French  Armies know very well how eminent a Truth it was  Another in the Reign of the late Queen was sent for upon the Complaint of the  Russian  Minister Resident here for likening the Czar of  Muscovy to a Siberian Bear  and tho' he did not really call his  Czarish  Majesty  Siberian Bear  but only liken'd some of his Actions to the Behaviour of that  Northern  Creature yet he was oblig'd to make his Submission beg Pardon and be very thankful for being discharg'd so cheap  Yet all this consists with the Liberty of the Press which is as all Liberty should be understood a  Liberty  to do well but not a Liberty to do  Evil  "Restraint from ill is Freedom to the Wise  "And Good Men wicked Liberties despise  I am Dear Sir Your Brother And humble Servant  LETTER III  SIR  _IN my first Letter I gave you some of my Observations upon the wretched Notions which the People here have entertained of that glorious thing call'd  Liberty  and how that  Liberty  which is the best of Mankind's Privileges is abused in the grossest Sence and applied to the meanest and most scoundrel Purposes I shall now bring it all down to the Design I am upon and let you see how these false Notions of  Liberty  getting into the Heads of the common People have Intoxicated their Brains and have in a word destroy'd all Subordination among us and joining with the Invasion of our Morals of which I am next to speak has set the World as I said with the Bottom upwar'd and have rais'd such a Devil among our Servants as will not easily be laid  I am therefore now to lay before you something of what I call the great Innundation of Vice that has thus tainted the Nation's Morals and which in particular has debauch'd the common People  In order to this I desire you will take this whole Letter as a Parenthesis or Degresion as it breaks in upon what went before and after  which I shall go on in my next where I left off in my last so that you may at any Time connect or join the Observations without this Part which is rather a History but which you will find so necesiary to the Understanding of the whole that I believe you will not think it any Interruption in your Reading  At my very first coming into  England  having not yet engag'd in settled Business I lik'd both the Place and the People so well that I resolv'd to make my stated Residence here for my Life in order to this I began to look upon the Place as my Native Country and immediately applied to my Friends to get myself Naturaliz'd that I might settle my Fortunes here as Providence should direct  To this purpose also I resolv'd for one of my first Steps  as I would advise all Gentlemen to do whether Natives or Forreigners  to make myself thorowly accquainted with the whole History of the Country and then with its Antiquities so that I should be Master both of its  antient State  its  present State  and also its Government and Laws and of the Customs and Manners of the People the delightful Study of this took me up something above a Year in which time I read over and that very carefully all the best Histories of the Island in which are recorded the general Introduction of Laws Rights Soveraignty and civil Goverment in the Nation and account of the first Inhabitants and with what Gallantry  and Bravery they defended their  Liberty  against the several Invasions of the  Romans Picts Saxons Danes Normans  and the Wars and Bloody Battles which afterward happen'd between those contending Nations for the maintaining the Conquests they had made and keeping the Possessions which they had mark'd out to themselves in this Island  In reading these Histories I came to understand how the People of this Nation came to be possess'd of such unusual  Privileges  and  Liberties  such as no Nation enjoy but themselves and what original Plea of Right they have to make for them a Plea which appears so just and excepting some Intervals when their Monarchs uneasie to be under the Restraint of Laws and be as it were govern'd by their People have made Attempts to get out of those Fetters and free the  Crown  as they call'd it from popular Bondage  in which Attempts too they have always miscarry'd  I say excepting which their Plea of Right has been always so demonstrably just that their best Kings have willingly yielded to them and thought it a sufficient Glory to their Family to be possess'd of a Monarchy so flourishing  even with all its Limitations  But as I observ'd there have been Intervals of this Peace and some of their Princes as above impatient of Restraint have broken the  Circle of Government  attempted to make themselves arbitrary assum'd a despotick Right and trampling on the Laws and Constitution  of the Kingdom have broken out into Oppressions and Ravages on the Properties of their Subjects in manifest Violation of the Laws which even those very Princes had sworn to rule by but then on the contrary it should be observ'd also that these Violations of Right  as I call them  never fail'd to meet with Opposition from the Subjects the People on all those Occasions  being assisted by the Nobility and Gentry  frequently had recourse to Arms to vindicate their just Rights and free themselves from Tyranny and Oppression and 'tis to be observ'd with some Wonder almost upon all these Occasions the Kings had the worst as their Claims were unjust their Attempts were unsuccessful and some of them were compell'd to undo what they had done and restore the People to their Liberty as King  Stephen  and King  Hen  III K  John  K  Hen  IV and others and last of all K  James  II Others were entirely ruin'd depos'd and lost both Power and Life as King  Edw  II  Richard  II  c  These were the  Rights  and  Liberties  of  Engglishmen  of which so much has been said in the World and of which such strange Constructions and such simple Use is made in these Days of which I shall say more as I go on and for this Reason it is I take this Notice of it here  As thus I made myself Master of the History and  ancient State  of  England  I resolv'd in the next Place to make myself Master of  its  present State  also and to this Purpose I travell'd in three or four several Tours over the whole Island critically observing and carefully informing myself of every thing worth observing in all the Towns and Countries through which I pass'd  I took with me an  ancient Gentleman  of my Acquaintance who I found was thorowly acquainted with almost every Part of  England  and who was to me as a walking Library or a moveable Map of the Countries and Towns through which we pass'd and we never fail'd to enquire of the most proper Persons in every Place where we came what was to be seen what Rarities of Nature Antiquities ancient Buildings were in the respective Parts or in short every thing worth the Observation of Travellers  I have often complain'd that tho' the  English  Historians especially in their relating Facts have been very particular and distinct and the Histories of the several Wars in  England  are very well written yet that they are all very indifferent in their  Geography  and that the Reader is spoken to as supposing he knew before where everything spoken of was done and how every Town or Country mention'd was situated whereas I that was a perfect Stranger to these things should have been greatly at a Loss But to remedy this I had always the Maps of every Country before me at the same time that I read the History as also I had a Book entitled  Britannia  written  by that very learned Antiquary Mr  Camden  and some other Books too which treat of the natural History as well as the Antiquities of every County with these Helps in my travelling together with my learned Companion I was generally inform'd of every thing material wherever I came whereas without these I might have gone thro' many Places where valuable Antiquities and other Curiosities of Nature or Art were to be seen and have known nothing of them and he that travels  England  without such Helps may in many Cases almost as well stay at Home  But to come to that which is more particular to my present Purpose and which is the Reason of giving you this Account of my Travels by this Means I became particularly acquainted with the common People as well as with the Country in every Place where I came I observ'd their Language that is the several Dialects of it for they strangely disfer in their Way of expressing themselves tho' in the same Tongue and there is as much difference between the  English  Tongue as spoken in the  North  of  England  and the same Torgue as spoken in the  West  as between the French spoken in  Normandy  and that of  Gascogne  and  Poictou  I say I became accquainted with their Language Customs Manners Tempers and above all with their Morals which is the thing I shall have most Occasion to speak of in these Letters I shall trouble you now with no more relating to  my Travels I may in time satisfie the other Part of your late Request and give you a full account of the Country which indeed is well worth a Traveller's Pains to see and a Reader's trouble to look over but I have not now time to revise my Journals and the Minutes which I took of things every where as I pass'd which are very critical I assure you and fruitful of a very diverting as well as instructing variety that Part I must refer to another Occasion  My Friend who went with me was very curious also and the more because I requested it of him in making Enquiries into and Observations upon the Customs and Manners of the People which  as I mention'd above  are the principal things which I am now speaking of  I observe several of the Authors I have just now mentioned have written largely of the antient Families of the Nobility and Gentry of  GreatBritain  their Originals Names Arms and sometimes the History of particular Men among them who have made themselves famous in the World of which the Gentry of  England  have produc'd many  But I meet with very few that take Notice of the common People how they live what their general Employment is and what the particular Employment of them is in the several Counties respectively and yet I found this an Enquiry very full of useful Observations and attended with innumerable Incidents  which gave Light into things of the greatest Moment as well in History as Antiquity and which seem'd to add a Part in the Knowledge of the Country which a Traveller cou'd not be without  To come to the Point 'tis necessary to observe to you as the GroundWork of my whole Design that the common People of this Country have suffer'd a kind of general Revolution or change in their Disposition Temper and Manners within a certain Term of Years  which I shall mark out to you in its Place also  I say they have suffer'd a general change such as I believe no Nation has undergone but themselves I wish I cou'd say it was a change for the better but be that as it will I shall endeavour to give you an impartial Account of it as it is  It is in the next Place needful to observe to you that I took this Journey at the unhappy Time when this Change or Revolution in the Manners and Temper of the common People was in the height of its Operation namely in the Years to for I was near four Year before I finish'd my Travels  I that was then a Stranger to the People tho' not altogether to the Place was not fully accquainted with their just Character in Times past but my Companion upon whose Judgement I very much depended and who being an observing as well as an antient Man had been conversant among them for threescore Years before supply'd me in that Part in a  Manner which no Books or Maps cou'd do for this Part is as I have said scarce meddl'd with in History  'He told me that he first was acquainted among the common People by his Father's being a very great Clothier in the  WestCountry  in consequence of which Business he employ'd many Hundreds  I think he said Thousands  of the Labouring Poor that he acted under his Father for some Years but then went into the  North  and  NorthEast  Parts of  England  as first into the  WestRiding  of  Yorkshire  bordering on  Lancashire  and after that into  Lincolnshire  and  Norfolk  and that his Business was chiefly buying of  Lincolnshire  and  Leicestershire  Wool which by the way is the best and fittest for Manufacturing in  England  and by this trading moving kind of Life  added he  I came to converse among the Poorer sort of People Farmers and Manufacturers of every kind from  Lancashire  and  Westmoreland  in the  North  down to  Lincolnshire  and  Leicestershire  and thence into  Norfolk Suffolk  and  Essex  and especially among the Servants of all these Countries such as Husbandmen DayLabourers and Workmen also Servants in Gentlemen's and Tradesmen's and Farmers Families and the like  I listen'd very carefully to his Discourse because this was the Part that I more particularly intended to inquire into and often desir'd him to tell me what that kind of  People they were in his Time for what they were then and how they behav'd then we both knew very well  'He told me that about the Year to when he began to be conversant in the World on his own Account the common People were plain fairdealing sober openhearted courteous humble that generally speaking they were very honest in their dealing and in many Places religious and conscientious in their Conversation that the Servants were modest humble mannerly and very subservient to those who entertain'd and employ'd them that the  Apprentices  either to Tradesmen or Handicrafts were quiet dilligent submitted chearfully to FamilyBusiness Orders and Hours were laborious and work'd hard for their Masters Benefit having their Eyes at the Time when by the expiration of their Terms they should have the Benefit of their Industry and of the Labour of other Servants for themselves nay  said he  even in  London  the Servants and Apprentices to ShopKeepers WarehouseKeepers and to the best Merchants thought it not below them to stoop to the meanest needful things in their Business such as assisting Package of Goods clearing setting to Rights and Sweeping their Warehouses CountingHouses and Shops loading Carts opening and shutting Doors and Windows  c  of which hereafter  'The Wages of the Poor  said he  were not more then tho' their Labour was greater but just the contrary the Wages of hir'd Servants were then from  s  per  Annum  to  s  for a MaidServant  d  to  d  and  d  a Day to a Labouring or HusbandMan farther in the  NorthWest  Country not so much the Farmers hir'd their yearly MenServants who they took into the House for  s  and their Diet the Gentlemen had their ServingMen or Footmen to whom they also gave their Diet for  s  to  s  a Year and as to Nobleman and Persons of Quality they had their Footmen  as we now call them  of the Sons of their Tennants who thought it their Honour to be taken into the Service and Family of the Lord of the Mannour and had a Badge of that Honour  viz  a Livery given them of RussetCloth with a Badge or Mark of his Lordship's Arms and at  Christmass  a RoseNoble in Silver to bless their Pockets nor was there any need for such as those to have more Wages for their Lord generally prefer'd them after certain Terms of Service to be Tennants of small Farms or made them Cottages and put them into a Way to get their Bread by Honest Labour and dilligence in Husbandry which was the utmost of their Ambition  I look'd earnestly at him while he talk'd thus and after he had done pray then said I when and from what Causes and Beginings  came that strange Alteration of things which we see now for the Country People as well as the TradesPeople in Towns and Cities are quite another sort of Folks at this time than what you speak of and as for the Servants they move in another kind of Circle and do not understand the Language you talk of  O says he 'tis a dismal and melancholly thing to tell you how this Alteration has happen'd and you that are a Stranger will neither have Patience to hear it or be able to give Credit to it when you do  I assur'd him I wou'd convince him of the contrary for  says I  you see I am so desirous to know these things that I can never be dissatisfied with the Relation however long and as for giving Credit  I told him  I knew him too well not to depend entirely upon the Truth of whatever he related to me as Truth and of his own Knowledge for that I was assur'd he would not mislead me in any thing  He then went on with his Discourse and beginning at the History of the late three Reigns First he told me that after the Death of Queen  Elizabeth  when King  James  the First came to the Crown things immediately began to take a new turn he told me that during the whole Reign of that Prince they had in  England  a most dissolute Court where the Nobility and Gentry and Courtiers after the Example of the King himself delighted in Masques Interludes  Bacchanalian Feasts Riots and all manner of Luxury not says he to mention the more wicked Parts of it  'That after King  Jawe's  Death his Son tho' a Prince of great Personal Temperance and Modesty yet Vice and Immorality having gain'd a footing among the Courtiers the King cou'd do little to abate the Riot of it being at the same time perplex'd with the constant Difficulties of his Affairs so that the Flux of Riot and Luxury which began in his Father's Reign receiv'd no other Check in King  Charles  the First's time than what a good Example in the King might give to it and that was not sufficient while the Courtiers gave themselves a Liberty to go on as they had begun  'But that which follow'd said he was still worse and finish'd the Ruin of the Morals of our People especially of the Gentry throughout the Nation and more especially of those who took Part with the King in the Troubles which follow'd for the King said he being oblig'd by the Fate of the Day to raise an Army against his tumultuous Subjects and that Army being compos'd  not of listed Troops as now  in which Case the Law of  Subordination  being rigorously and solemnly observ'd the Officers are as subject one to another as the meanest Soldiers but the King's Army being rais'd by the generous Contribution of the Loyal Gentry the Officers were all Gentlemen and Volentiers  that serv'd upon Principles of Love and Loyalty to their Prince and not for Pay and the King not having always Money to pay them if they had ask'd it could not at the same time tie them up to Laws of War and Rules of Discipline  as is now the Case  nor cou'd he always shew his Resentment much less punish them when they committed even the most detestable Crimes for that so many would interest themselves to intercede that if the King should deny a Pardon they would pretend to be disoblig'd talk of being illtreated their Services disregarded  and the like  and the next Word was quitting the Army so that the King was oblig'd to wink at all the Extravagancies Plunderings Rapes nay and even Murthers too not being in a Condition to do that Justice which the Law and a free Administration call'd for  'If the King was thus disabl'd from punnishing Capital Crimes  says the old Gentleman  less cou'd he dip into lesser Mistakes such in particular as the common Excesses and Extravagancies of his Officers the Oaths and Execrations to this Day so common among the Soldiers and the Drunkenness the Debaucheries and Violences attending them and spreading among the Soldiers by the Example of their Officers but he the King was oblig'd to satisfie himself with verbil Reproof Entreaties and such Ways  as might show his dislike of the thing without Resentment at the Person and if he had not done thus he would have had but few Soldiers to Fight for him  'It was here  said my Friend  that this dreadful unnatural Imprecation of calling on God to  Damn them  first broke out here it was first Invented and first made Use of on the other hand as for the Parliament's Army  said he whether it was really Religion or a religious Policy be that to themselves  yet as they carried on a Pretence of Religion in their Cause so they maintain'd the Face of Religion and more than common Sanctity in their Armies and as they wanted no Money to Pay all their Troops both Officers and Soldiers so they had them all at command and were under no Obligation to a relax Discipline and by this they gain'd insensibly on the Country to make this difference more sensible to me he told me a Story of the Master of  ScoleInn  in  Norfolk  the Man  whether meerly keeping good Hours in his Family or that he had some Extraordinary Business that requir'd his rising early the next Morning he cou'd not remember but the Man I say  was gone to Bed one Night something sooner than usual and locking up his Gates and as was his Custom taking the Key's up with him into his Chamber he was but newly in Bed when he was rais'd with a Noise of rapping and thundering at the Gate a Servant Maid that was up  about her KitchinAffairs goes to the Gate and asks who was there they bid Gd Dn her why did she not open the Gate one cry'd shoot her and another Damn her cut her Throat and the like but the Wench finding they were Soldiers pray'd them to be quiet she would go up to her Master for the Key's and let them in presently so she runs up to the Master's ChamberDoor and calls to him the Man just fallen into his first Sleep did not wake presently and the Wench was almost as impatient at the ChamberDoor as the Troopers were without who began to knock and lay on at the Gate again at last the Man waking and hearing what was the matter starts out of Bed and began to put on his Cloaths Soldiers says he Troopers who are they for for says the Wench you need not ask who they are for  they are for the King  to be sure  hark how they swear  'Here my Friend stopp'd as if he had done well but Sir  said I  what is this to the strange Turn given to the Poor common People and labouring Poor the Servants and the like who you say were so plain so openhearted so quiet so modest and so lowpriz'd since you can remember whence came the Change upon them  'Well says he I am coming to that I shall Account for it as plainly as for the other after the War was over and the RoyalFamily  was restor'd Things took a new Turn again the outside of Religion which the Parliament's People had maintain'd  be it that it was from right or wrong Principles  had had this good Effect namely that it kept the World sober but upon the return of Monarchy at the Restoration the Court was all Mirth and Gayety again and the whole Nation rejoic'd with them  their Joy was without question just no body disputed that Part  but unhappy for  England  they cou'd find no way to Express an exceeding Joy but by an excess of Crime and particularly that most brutish of all Crimes Drunkenness which overspread the Nation like a WinterFlood and a torrent of Oaths and Prophaneness follow'd of course  'He then descended to Particulars the Families of the Nobility and Gentry said he were all universally touch'd with these wicked doings in particular  said he  Drinking  Healths began here  a thing till then not known in  England  the King's Health the Health of all the RoyalFamily one after another six Glasies in a Hand he that had the Victory at the Glass was the best Subject Drunkenness grew a Test of Loyalty and nothing that was sober cou'd keep Company without being affronted  'And yet had this been all one cou'd hardly expect less from a Nation overwhelm'd with Joy at the return of the  RoyalFamily and the restoring the Fortunes and Circumstances of so many ruin'd Families and exil'd Cavaliers but not content with this the Custom of imposing Healths upon everybody that came into Company follow'd it so that nobody cou'd visit his Friend without being made Drunk  'Nor was it enough to drink the King's Health with the Healths of all the RoyalFamily and of General  Monk  and of the RoyalOak and every simple mad thing they cou'd think of but then in spight of the Act of Oblivion and the King's exhorting the People in his Speeches to Parliament to forget all former things Words of Distinction and Marks and Names of Reproach they must then drink Confusion to the Rump Damnation to  Oliver Cromwell  and all his Race Confusion to the Phanaticks and a thousand such extravagant things all which had this additional Evil in the Practice namely that they serv'd to pour Wine down the Throats of the whole Company and make Drunkenness overspread Society in general  'Neither was this only practis'd at the beginning of the Restoration but it held on even to the Death of King  Charles  the  d  at the latterend of whose Reign as if it had slack'd before and that they were afraid the Nation should grow Sober again the Tide of Drunkenness which had but seem'd  to Ebb a little came on again with a surprizing reflux especially upon the Divisions at the latterend of the Popish Plot between  Whig  and  Tory  and particularly upon the Subject of the Bill of Exclusion  'Till then Drunkenness had not so universally spread itself among the common People the Gentlemen contented themselves with being Drunk and making one another so but upon that Occasion it became a Politick Interest to make Servants Tennants Tradesmen and everybody Poor as well as Rich drink to Excess drinking the Duke of  York's  Health became a new Test of Society and of Loyalty drinking to the Succession in the RightLine Confusion to the Presbyterians to all those that were for the Bill of Exclusion and the like  'Now came on frequent Dissolutions and Elections of Parliament and in consequence of that the Bribery and Corruption the Treating for Elections and all those Treatings attended with Excessive Drinking increased to such a Degree that in a few Years the Habit of Drunkenness and the Drinking of Healths  as above  spread by the Example of the Gentlemen to the Tennants to the common People in the Corporations to the Servants and in short to the whole Body of the People  'And tho' it was true that there remain'd a great many sober good religious People in the Nation  and 'tis to be hop'd there does  so still  yet here began the Ruin of the Nation's Morals here the Poor got a smatch of Drunkenness and withal a dreadful Habit of swearing raging and damning one another in their Drink as well as the Rich and with them it continues and encreases every Day  'An Instance of this  adds my Relater  is evident in the Number of AleHouses and PublickHouses erected in the first five Years after the Restoration of which says he this is the short Detail    Licences for new Alehouses where there were none before were granted in a very little Space       WineLicenses for Taverns       MayPoles set up for Dancing       Barrels of Ale  Brew'd in that Space more than was in the five foregoing Years    Barrels of Beer  Here my Friend clos'd his Historical Account as he call'd it of the growth of Debauchery in  England  and the Revolution which the Temper and Disposition of the People of  England  suffer'd in those Days he only added these Words at the end of it I will not says he answer for the Exactness of the Account above as to the Encrease of VictuallingHouses  MayPoles and Brewing tho' I have great Reason to believe they are rather within Compass than beyond it but this I think is certain that by those means the Morals of the Nation were ruin'd Let me only add a few of my Remarks to this Discourse Experience shews that it appears much easier to conquer and give a Check to this Vice thus broken in among the Gentlemen than it is to check it among the common People  At the late  Revolution  upon the coming of the Prince of  Orange  that scandalous Custom of imposing upon People and obliging People to drink whether they would or no receiv'd a Check with their lost Liberties the Nation recover'd the Liberty of Drinking  that is to say  of Drinking as they pleas'd and on a sudden from a Mode or Fashion of putting the Cup to your Neighbour's Nose it became the Mode to give every Man leave to Drink as he pleas'd according to the old Rule at  Ahasuerus's Feast  and this was a great Point gain'd too  But alas it was too late the Distemper was too far gone if the Gentlemen would not make the Servants Drunk the Servants would make one another so the Tennants now began to drink as fast as the Landlords the Husbandman as fast as the Employer and as every Man in Drinking among the Gentry had the Liberty to Drink as little as he would  so every Man among the common People claim'd the Liberty of Drinking as much as he would at the same time knowing not how to set Bounds to their DrinkingGust  Wonder not that I call the  Drunken Vice  the worst of all  Brutallity  it appears by its Consequences in this Nation to be the  Mother Sin  the Parent or producing Cause of all Vice the Sins of Whoreing Gameing Thieving Murther Rapin Couzening and Cheating and particularly that of Swearing have been its natural Progeny and have all enter'd at this one Door Drunkenness has been the great Ancestor of them all  That  Swearing Whoreing  and  Murther  are the natural Consequences of Drunkenness you will grant me I believe at first Word neither is there any need to debate the Point here Experience proves it but suffer me I beseech you to look a little into it  I The Custom of Prophane  Swearing  is so encreas'd among the poor People  Servants Labourers c  that it is troublesome to sober People to go along the Street they hear the Mouths of the common Labouring Poor so continually overflowing with gall I remember being in the  Northern  Parts of  England  beyond  Newcastle  upon  Tyne  I met an  English  Gentleman who was just that very Day come out of  Scotland  and it was so greivous to him that he cou'd  not forbear complaning of it to me his Expression was this  'If I was  says he  to be brought out of  Scotland  into  England  blindfold I would tell at the first Town I set my Foot in on this side the Border that I was on  English  Ground by hearing the Name of God prophaned by the very Young Children in the Street the grown People swearing and cursing in all their ordinary Discourse whereas for the Honour of  Scotland says he  I must speak it you hear nothing or but very little of it there  Everybody knows that this horrid Custom is the ordinary Companion of Drunkenness Swearing and Cursing are the Brats of the Bottle that way and that way only they came in and tho' the Gentlemen have a little abated the dreadful Excess as if their Footmen and Servants having learnt to outswear them it was become a little too Vulgar for them yet this I may venture to say now that the Footmen and Servants will not so easily follow their Master's Example in abating it as they did follow their Example in learning it  Besides as if the Devil having got hold of the Nation in this manner was resolv'd not to part with them If the Gentlemen have left it off the Ladies have taken it up and a certain Dutchess is said to be famous for this  namely  that she will out swear any of her  Footmen  or  Chairmen    Murther  in this I may appeal to the Experience of those that liv'd towards the beginning of the last Century that there was nothing known or heardof like what we see now I mean Men fighting wounding and killing one another in the Streets and in Taverns and coming out of Taverns and where one Accident of this kind happen'd then it may safely be said that five hundred such have happen'd since  How often do we see Men come raving out of the Taverns as void of Sence as a Man out of  Bedlam  and swear they'll kill the next Man they meet and how many Gentlemen of good Families and Fortunes have I  seen since I have been in  England  sent by the Law on that account to make a trip to St Tyburn the Greve of this City  as the Greve at  Paris  is the  Tyburn  of that City that is to say hang'd for drunken Murthers besides the Numbers who by Favour and Intrest have obtain'd the Prince's Pardons and Reprieves  Again how many  selfmurthers  of this kind too have we daily in our weekly and yearly Bills of Mortallity thus kill'd himself by excessive Drinking the yearly Bills give us an Account of no less than one hundred and six and twenty in the last five Years besides such as perish by that Enemy who are spar'd in the said Bills because they shou'd not be known which are perhaps twenty times that Number  'Tis another Evidence of the truth of my Observation on this Head that the Government have found themselves oblig'd to make so many new Laws for the more effectual preventing Drunkenness and Debauchery Obliging Victuallers and Vintners not to keep unseasonable Hours not to draw Drink of a SabbathDay  c  Crimes scarce heard of in former Days and which there was no Occasion to provide against before To oblige every Man that is fuddled or as we call it in drink to pay five Shillings to the Poor or to be set an Hour in the Stocks and the like  Indeed it has been some Obstruction to the Execution of these Laws that the Magistrates are so often overtaken themselves that they cannot find in their Hearts to punish others for what they themselves deserve Punishment for more than most poor Men can do  As to the Vice of Whoring and the near relation that has to this of Drunkenness I need take up none of your time upon that Subject only to remark what an infinite Number of Debauches of this kind happen every Day among us more than ever were before  It occurs to me here to tell you a short Story upon this Head of a certain Colonel of the Army a particular Accquaintance of mine who had an Intriegue with a young Lady and cou'd by no means compass his Design her Virtue proving stanch against all his Attacks only that she had so much respect for him that she would have consented to Marry him  but that did not suit it seems with his Convenience or at least with his Design  However he found means one time to get this Lady into his Company and to get a little Wine into her Head more than she cou'd manage and when her Head was light her Heels prov'd so to and he had his Will of her when she came to herself and was made sensible of her Wickedness finding herself inbed with him that there was no room left for Regret she put it off with a Jest and said well since she had let him come when she was drunk he might e'en as well come when she was sober for it was all one now  After this she sollicited him with all her Skill to marry her as he had offer'd to do before but soon found she could not Master him that way but at length she resolv'd to try if she cou'd not take him at the same Advantage that he had taken her at before she laid many Snares of this kind for him but was always disappointed after some time finding him one Evening come into her Chamber half drunk she took the hint and got him to accept of a Bottle from her as she call'd it and she sat and drank the Bottle out with him and then another or two till being very drunk he wanted to come to Bed to her but she pretended to refuse him because he would not marry her he answer'd he would marry her and call'd for a Parson tho not knowing well  what he said or did she who had got a Minister ready for the Purpose having expected what happen'd takes him at his Word brings in the Parson and made him repeat the Words of Matrimony and had good Witnesses of it and then she went to Bed with him  In the Morning going to rise he call'd her by Name no no Colonel  says she  not Mrs  Mary  now but  Mary  Colonel 's Wife what mean you by that said he even just so Sir  says she  and told him the whole Fact as you serv'd me before I hope you can't be angry  well  says the Colonel  if I have don't when I was drunk I must stand to it when I am sober but you have bit me in my own Play  my Dear says he  and made my Lord  Rochester's  Verses good upon me  "A Woman's ne'er so ruin'd but she can  "Revenge herself on her  Undoer  Man  If I was to give you the Detail of the Adventures I have met with of this kind I might Entertain you with Letters for a great while on no other Subject it is true in the Story above the Man was the Agressor and deserv'd it and the Woman was not intentionally  a Whore  but on the other hand how many young Gentlemen Heirs to good Families and Estates have been drawn in by the meer Engine of the Bottle to debauch  themselves with scandalous and even distemper'd Whores to the ruin of Body Soul and Fortune and how many  which is still worse  have wheedled them in to marry them when they have done If I should say that this Consequence of Drunkenness is more frequent in this Nation than ever I cou'd observe it to be in  France  or even in  Germany  itself I believe I should say Truth  But still this is among the Gentry and does not reach down to the lower Rank of People of whom I am principally to speak but is not the Consequence of Excess in Drink visible in all the lower Sorts of Men as well as the other how are the very Morals and Honesty of the labouring People so ruin'd that now as I noted in my last you cannot with safety hire a Workman by the Day to almost any kind of Business unless your Eye be upon him not only part but even all the time of his Work if you do you are sure to have your Work either spoil'd or neglected or done contrary to your Order  The labouring People have their Eyes now not at your Work but at their own Wages and if they can but secure the last their Business is to cheat you in the first as much as possible but especially  as to Time  formerly honest Men were to be found who whether you were with them or from them would be fairly at their Business and made Conscience of doing their Day's Work for their Day's Wages  But now the Case is quite alter'd I shall give you an Example of this before I come to speak more particularly to it I have for some Years been concern'd in a large publick Building in the Country where we kept a great many other Servants as also Horses and Carts constantly employ'd among the rest we kept an old Servant whose Name was  Wright  in constant Work tho' paid by the Week he was a Wheelwright by Trade and a Carpenter also and his Business was to keep the Carts and Barrows and WorkingTools and Workhouses in repair  and the like  it happen'd one Morning that a Cart being Brokendown upon the Road at some distance from the House this old Man was fetch'd to repair it where it lay while he was busy at his Work comes by a Countryman that knew him and at some Distance salutes him with the usual Compliment  goodMorrow  Father  Wright God speed your Labour  the old Fellow looks up at him for he did not see him at first and with a kind of pleasant surlyness answer'd  I don't care whether he does or no 'tis DayWork  I need make no Comment upon this worthy Speech it explains itself I shall have occasion to mention  old Father Wright  again in a more particular Affair of this kind but I am now more properly speaking of the Effect of Drunkenness upon the Morals of the labouring Poor and that leads me to observe how they are not only become careless and  Negligent of their Business when employ'd by others but entirely negligent of themselves and of their Families notwithstanding they are able by their ordinary Labour to support them very comfortably I had in the same BuildingWorks which I mention'd above a Workman who during the whole Summerseason for the Work which is about seven or eight Months as Weather happens cou'd ordinarily earn Eighteen Shillings a Week sometimes to  s per  Week this Fellow work'd very hard too indeed and yet he would hardly save Cloaths to cover his Nakedness and his Wife and four Children were kept by the Parish  But even this does not fully reach the Case I am upon it would take up more Letters than I should be able to write you for seven Year if I should give you a particular of the dismal Effects of Drunkenness upon the People of this sober Nation I call them so because so they were but a few Years before and even since some that are now alive can remember  But I must shorten the Discourse now my present Design being chiefly of another kind  viz  to let you see what the general Behaviour of Workmen and hir'd Labourers of both Sexes is how they manage themselves or to speak more properly how they manage their Masters for things are come to that pass now that tho' Masters have the Name of Government indeed the Servants  really govern throughout this Nation and especially that Part of them who we hire for daily Labour who if but one crooked Word be spoken to them will turn their Backs upon you and upon your Business and be gone in spight of Contracts and Bargains and in spight of any Damages you may suffer by it as I shall shew you more particularly in my next also of all the other kinds of Servants among us for they are the same in their Degree such as  Coachmen Footmen Cooks MaidServants and MenServants Apprentices  and the like how they behave how their Conduct is alter'd of late how terrible a Greivance their Insolence is in the Families where they are what Masters frequently suffer by their Negligence and Abuses and how hard it is to find Methods for the Regulation of this Evil it is I confess very difficult but I shall venture at it a little and if possible by searching into the bottom of these things we may find out some Remedy that the Nation may be deliver'd from one of the heaviest Burthens that ever loaded it and the most difficult to deal with  I shall conclude with observing to you that I am very just in laying the Weight of all this upon that Flood of Wine and StrongDrink which this Nation seems to be drown'd in for so many Years past because 'tis evident that Drinking is still the ordinary Introduction of all the particular Disorders which these People commit 'Tis ordinary to say  such an one is a very civil Fellow and a very good Workman or such a one is a very good Servant  but he will he Drunk now and then and when he is so he is mad and does not care what he does  and the general Excuse for a saucy insolent Servant is  why he was in drink and did not know what he said you must excuse it he will be very sorry for it and beg your Pardon for it when he is sober  now it may be all this shall be very true and the Fellow shall come the very next Day and beg Pardon  as was said of him  and shall the very next time he gets a little more Drink in his Head be the same Man again and as saucy and Insolent as before and beg Pardon again and be drunk again and so on in a kind of rotation to the end of the Chapter  It is remarkable also that when such a Fellow comes to beg Pardon he shall have the Impudence to say to you that he was in drink and that therefore he hopes you will pass it by whereas his being Drunk is not an aggravation only but an Addition of Crime and so far from a Reason why he should be Pardon'd that 'tis the best Reason that can be given why he shou'd not  Another Case is that this Drunkenness is certainly the Parent of Oaths and as our common People are addicted to Swearing in such an execrable manner as that no Nation in the World is like them so it is most commonly when they are in drink At least  Drunkenness has been the grand Introduction to it nay many that will never Swear when they are sober will Swear in the most outrageous manner when they are in drink and be guilty of the most gross and abominable Actions in their Liquor things which they themselves would abhor when they were themselves  There is an unhappy kind of Swearing which Custom has brought upon this Nation which is not the Effect of Drunkenness of which I shall give you the Trouble of a Letter by iself and this is the Multiplication of Oaths appointed by Authority of which this Kingdom has more than ever I met with in any Nation whatever but of that hereafter  This way of Swearing was in its beginning a high Compliment upon the general Integrity and gave a great Character of the Principles of the People arguing that they were so conscientiously regardful of their Oaths that what they once swore it might be depended on they would carefully and religiously observe  But time and the frequency of taking these Oaths has made kissing the Gospels so familiar with them that such Oaths have lost much of their Solemnity and are consequently brought to be of less Importance and to have less Influence on the Minds of those who take them than it was at first believ'd they would have and then indeed they ought to have  If Drunkenness and in consequence of it this vile habit of Swearing have thus possess'd the generality of the poor People here as I have observ'd what then can we expect from them as to their Morals or Manners you are not indeed to expect much from their Morals but far less from their Manners  What decency of Expression what Modesty in Behaviour can that Man show when he is gorg'd with Drink when his Head runs round like the Sails of a Wind Mill as the Vapour blows when he knows nothing what he does or what he is to do when he can neither think or act  They have a very good old Song here on the Subject of Drinking which has in it one Couple of Lines that is much to my Purpose  viz  "And the Man that is Drunk  "Is as great as a King  It is literally true here an  Englishman  when Drink is in his Head is a King an Emperor Monarch of himself and knows nobody and values nobody if he be the meanest of your Servants is your Master for that time he knows nothing about you or about your Business but will roar and sing even in your Face and tell you he is above all Masters and values nobody  To talk to him while he is in that Condiction is to talk Gospel to a  Kettle Drum  you get nothing but saucy Language or something worse the best way is to get some of the other Servants to have him tobed and when he has slept and is a little sober he will be pretty well again but then you have this trouble upon your Hands again  viz  That if you do not set some honest staid sober Fellow to take care of him  the next Morning  if he gets but one Mug of Beer in his Hand  he is gone  his Head is not thorowly cool and he is a Madman or a Sober Man for another Day just as the Company he falls into first happens to be loose drinking Fellows or sober and grave and sometimes he goes on for the whole Week As this is the Case with them in their Drink it begins to be a kind of a necessary Custom tho' it be owing chiefly to the Custom of drinking namely that no Notice is to be taken no not by the Master himself of what a Servant either says or does when he is in Drink  I shall lead you into these Particulars more to your Satisfaction by giving you some short Histories of Cases which come up to the Perfection of these things and which I hope will be both diverting and instructing mean time I conclude for the present and am  Dear Sir  Your most humble Servant and affectionate Brother  LETTER IV  Dear Sir  _I AM now to lay down some things for your farther Admiration in the particular Behaviour of the  English  Poor and give me leave previous to what I have farther to say upon this Head to add that This is all  in spight of double Pay  at the same Time that their Services are  least  and their Behaviour  worst  their Wages are  best  their pay  largest  and they have the greatest Obligation laid upon them to be diligent  This one would think should either prevent their IllBehaviour or be a means to reclaim them when they had broken in upon their Manners but on the contrary it is a general Observation at least in the Compass of my particular Knowlege and I scarce ever knew it fail  namely  that I never knew a Servant or a Workman in  England  one farthing the better for the Encrease of his Wages on the contrary if you advance a Servant's Wages it is so natural for him to think he deserves it or that else you would not do it that instead of mending him it always makes him worse  It is a kind of a Proverbial Speech among our People when they see a dull heavy Fellow  go slowly on in his Business to say to him come  mend your Pace  and I'll  mend your Pay  but really the Man's return ought to be do you but mend my Pay first  and you shall hang me if I mend my Pace  Servants and Workmen in  England  seem to act in the Case of their Master's Bounty as an old cunning  CartHorse  does with the Driver and his Whip when the Driver smacks his Whip the CartHorse shakes his Bells the Driver makes the Horse believe he will strike and the CartHorse makes the Driver believe he'll go but the Carter does not lash nor does the Horse mend his Pull so that the Horse cheats the Driver for his Favour in which by the way he lets us see that Gratitude is not a natural Principle among Horses  The Behaviour of the labouring Poor in  England  is something akin to this and we find that Gratitude is not a natural Principle among the common People at least if it is they are pleas'd to Sin against it in a most unnatural Manner in a word their Morals being touch'd as before that Part of their Virtue which I call Gratitude and which is the brightest Part of an honest Man is in a manner quite sunk among them But I shall have Occasion to compliment them upon their Gratitude hereafter  I return now to the most fatal Cause of all this Mischief I mean the Advance of Wages for this indeed is the support of all the Insolence  of Servants as their ruin'd Manners is the Spring of it Here indeed they verifie what was by a late Author made part of their Character  "The Lab'ring Poor in spight of double Pay  "Are saucy mutinous and Beggarly  But to return to the Wages and here I am to observe  That tho' advancing the Wages of Servants has not been a publick thing done by the Government or Legislature in the Nature of a Law  Nor has it been done by a common consent as some publick things have been done obtaining thereby the ordinary Sanction of a Law  Nor has it after such a kind of Common Consent been approv'd or confirm'd by any Authority as a thing which ought to be no nor lastly  Has it been so much as encourag'd by the Magistrates or Government on the contrary it is the common receiv'd Opinion that it ought not to be so and that it spoils Servants in the main and yet guided by we know not what Fate everybody comes into it the Servants encroach and demand high Wages and the People generally comply with it and so the Evil is grown insensibly upon us till it is become a receiv'd Custom and is what it may be said ever body does  and therefore every Servant looks for and whereas in common Charity one would expect that this should influence the generality of Servants for the better and help to reclaim them on the contrary it is indeed  the Ruin of them all  Nor is this Advance of Servants Wages any Wealth to them but as above their Morals being destroy'd this overplus is generally laid out either in Luxury or Vanity that is to say in  StrongDrink  by the MenServants and in  gay things  by the WomenServants and take all that little Frugallity which is to be found among them and set it against the horrible encrease of Pride and Debauchery that is  Drink  for I must be allow'd to call Drunkenness Debauchery I say take all that little Frugallity that is left I believe it will be granted  That the Poor are poorer than when Labour was cheaper  Servants lay up less  take them one with another  than they did when they were hir'd at half the Wages  So that upon the whole neither the Labourer withoutDoors or the menial Servant withinDoors are one jott the better in their Behaviour or the richer in their Pockets for all the advance of Pay which they receive which yet in the whole Kingdom amounts to an immense Sum by the Year  To begin with the labouring Poor they are indeed the Grievance of the Nation and there seems an absolute Necessity to bring them by severe regulations to some State of immediate Subordination their Case is briefly summ'd up in two Heads  Under  a stop of Trade  and a general want of Work then they are clamorous and mutinous run from their Families load the Parishes with their Wives and Children who they leave perishing and starving and themselves grow ripe for all manner of Mischief whether publick Insurrection or private plunder and robbery and seeing they have not Work enough they will not work at all and that brings them to wander starve beg steal and be Hang'd    In a Glut of Trade  they grow saucy lazy idle and debauch'd when they may have Work and may get Money enough to live well and lay up for a Time of less Business then instead of Diligence and GoodHusbandry which might be expected from honest Men on the contrary they will Work but two or three Days in the Week or till they get Money enough to keep them the rest of the Week and all the other part of their Time they lie in the Alehouse to spend it  The present Juncture of Time while I am writing this Letter furnishes me with flagrant Examples of this kind there is now and has been for near two Year past a prodigious Run of Trade for all sorts of the  WoollenManufactures of which  England  makes so much  This Demand for Goods makes a propotion'd Encrease of Work and an Encrease of Work of course produces an Encrease of Wages This the Poor in  France  wou'd rejoice at and any People indeed that were in their Sences would take it for a Blessing from Heaven and it would prompt their Diligence and make them work the harder that they might take the honest Advantage of it and as we say  make Hay while the Sun shines  That the Encrease of Trade and Wages is real and the Fact true you may take it thus in a few Words  viz  The rate for spinning weaving and all other ManufacturingWork I mean in  WOOL  is so risen that the Poor all over  England  can now earn or gain near twice as much in a Day and in some Places more than twice as much as they could get for the same Work two or three Years ago Particularly in  Essex Suffolk  and  Norfolk Eastward  and in  Wiltshire Somerset  and  Devon West  the Poor Women now get  d  to  d  a Day for spinning the Men more in proportion and are full of Work whereas before they cou'd not get half so much and very often not find Employment neither  And what now is the Consequence of this not Diligence not Thankfulness  I assure you  less is it enriching the Poor or furnishing themselves with Conveniences Cloaths and Necessaries  least of all  is it attended with a  provident layingup for a time of Scarcity when Work may be wanting and Wages abate again as 'tis very likely may be the Case hereafter  No No  just the contrary This Prosperity introduces Sloth Idleness Drunkenness and all manner of Wickedness instead of  making Hay while the Sun shines  they slight their Work and bully their Employers perhaps they will work two or three Days or it may be a Week till they find a few Shillings gingle and chink in their Pockets but then as if they cou'd not bear that kind of Musick away they go to the Alehouse and 'tis imposible to bring them to work again while they have a Farthing of it left  The Manufacturers are distress'd for Hands they have Workmen but they had as good have none for they will not Work the Masters beg and intreat and with Money in Hand as we say they Pray and Pay too but 'tis all one no Work can be done as long as there's a Farthing of Money in their Pockets  If we go out of the Manufacturing Towns into the CountryVillages there they feel the same thing another way the Farmers Wives can get no DairyMaids their Husbands no Plowmen and what's the matter truly the Wenches answer they won't go to Service at  d  or  d  a Week while they can get  s  to  s  a Week at spinning the Men answer they won't drudge at the Plow and Cart hedging and ditching threshing and  stubbing and perhaps get  l  a Year and course Diet when they can sit still and dry within Doors and get or  s  a Week at Woolcombing or at carding and such Work about the Woollen Manufacture  Now it is true the Argument on their side would be very just and some way unanswerable were the end really to work and so to get as much as they could by a Diligent Application to the Business and then by a frugal honest virtuous Life laying up what they got for their Use in harder times  But instead of this we find these Wenches and Fellows run to the ManufacturingTowns there perhaps they Spin and Work and when they have got a little Money in their Pockets beforehand then they turn Vagrant and Idle spend the little they have got in revelling drinking and by consequence something worse till the Magistrates have been call'd upon to rout them out to secure the Parishes from the charge of their Debaucheries  From these wicked Haunts they spread themselves about the Villages where they draw in other young People till then sober and diligent into the like Wickedness till we have seen six or seven of them in a House with bigBellies to the Shame and Affliction of their poor Parents and the Scandal of the whole Country  As soon as they can drop their Burthen they fly for fear of the House of Correction and away they go to  London  to get Services  London  like the Ocean that receives the muddy and dirty Brooks as well as the clear and rapid Rivers swallows up all the scum and filth of the Country and here they need not fear of getting Places what Servants are likely to come out of such Nurseries is not hard to suggest nor is it any breach of Charity to suppose that this helps to fill the Town with a generation of Whores and Thieves and makes our MaidServants recommend themselves as they do Hence nothing is more Natural than the common Jest we put upon the CountryGirls when we see them come up to  London  in the Carriers Waggons and on the PackHorses  viz  to ask them  if they have been Church'd before they came from home  nor is there any thing unreasonable in the Question as things go now in the Country when Work is so plenty and Wages so high for who wou'd come away to  London  to go to Service if things were all well at home  This is one of the Grievances which we want a Law to restrain and which if not taken in Time and restrain'd will quickly make Servants Wages as dear in the Country as they are now in the City and the poor Farmers must give  l  and  l  a Year Wages for DairyMaid as the Ladies here do for their ChamberMaids and a proportion for PlowMen and Carters of which I shall say more hereafter  It is true we have Laws here for regulating  of Servants and among the rest a Justice of Peace may oblige young People who are idle and live as 'tis call'd at their own Hands to go to Service and may if they refuse it send them to the House of Correction but this is a Concern which the Law takes for Parents whose Circumstances being but mean and their Children lying heavy upon them are willing to be maintain'd in Idleness and Sloth and refuse either to Work for themselves or go out to Service in such a Case the Magistrate may oblige them to go out as above  But if the single Person so challeng'd by the Justice answers that she work'd and maintains herself and is able to maintain herself without being a Charge to her Parents or the Parish I do not find the Magistrate can compel such a one to go to Service  In the next Place as this Insolence of  the labouring Poor  is in spight of  double Pay  so it is with this particular Aggravation that at the same Time that their Wages has been rais'd the Price of Provisions has been cheaper than it has been for many Years before particularly BreadCorn has been so low that none can complain except the poor Farmers who cannot pay their Rents by reason of the Cheapness of Corn and I am Witness to this that when Bread about or Years ago was sold for double the Price that it is now the Wages for spinning and Manufacturing was not much above half the Price that it  is now so that they gain'd less and spent more and yet were able to subsist even then  This makes good the ordinary Remark here  viz  that the poor are always poor it is very plain when Wages were cheap or low and Provisions high and dear the Poor were not poorer than they are now  and now  Wages are higher and Provisions so much lower than it was then yet the Poor are not richer now than they were then but this Riddle is easily expounded by saying The Poor are as above idle proud and saucy and when Wages are good they won't work  any more than from Hand to Mouth  or if they do work they spend it in Riot and Luxury so that it Turns to no Account to them  While this then is the Temper of the  labouring Poor  what are we to expect from them but that as above they will be mutinous when they want Employment and idle and saucy when they have it Would the poor MaidServants who choose rather to spin while they can gain  s per  Week by their Labour than go to service at  d  a Week to the Farmers Houses as before I say would they sit close to their work live near and close as labouring and poor People ought to do and by their Frugality lay up six or seven Shillings  per  Week none could object or blame them for their Choice but while on the contrary they either play half their Time and neglect the Work they have or if they  do work spend it all in Drink and Debauchery as is too much the Case this height of Wages is by it made a publick grievance the Poor are ruin'd even by that which is their Blessing or would be so were it rightly made use of I mean plenty of Work and good Pay nay the very plenty of Provisions which was always receiv'd by reasonable People and especially by Christians as the Gift and Mercy of Heaven is curs'd to them and becomes their Ruin for while they have Bread they won't work and when they do not work 'tis easie to judge what else they do and how they employ their Time  Again as soon as Trade receives a check and there is a little discouragement upon the Clothiers and Manufacturers so that Work is a little stop'd and the Masters and Employers can give no more Wool out to spin or perhaps but a little and that in consequence of this the Price abates too what follows why then they grow clamorous noisy and as I said before mutinous and saucy another way and in the mean time they disperse run away leave their Families and especially the numerous throng of Bastards which as I hinted the Wickedness of their WorkingLife had produc'd upon the Parishes and wander about in Beggary and Distress  In consequence of this it has been observ'd that in our great populous Manufacturing Towns whenever a run of Trade has happen'd and after it the Poor disperse again  there is generally an Encrease of Bastards greater than in any of the precedent Years and I could give such particular Examples of this in the  Western  and  Northern  Counties as would be surprising  Thus Gods Blessing and the Bounty of Providence is abused by these sorts of People not to encrease and encourage their Diligence their frugality and thriftiness to lay up in a time of plenty of Work for a time of scarcity and deadness of Trade but on the contrary to support them in their extravagant Follies and Wickedness prompt their Vices and fill them with Pride and Insolence both against God and Man  And so far are they from improving the Advantages of a Glut of Business that as soon as it stops even the very first Week perhaps the first Day they are reduced to their Original Poverty and Distress for having not laid up a Shilling but just working from Hand to Mouth as soon as the Workmaster stops the Workman or Workwoman starves and it must be confess'd such as these deserve no Pity seeing their wastefulness and the Expence both of their Money and their Time was in the very Teeth of that merciful Providence which suppyl'd them with double Work and double Pay and that they had reduc'd themselves by their Sloth to want when they might have been  as we call it  beforehand in the World  In a certain Town of Note which I have been well acquainted with a poor Workman was brought before the Magistrate by his Employer because he would not finish his Piece of Work which he had begun it was a Piece of Serge or Drugget or some such Stuff which the Master had hir'd him to weave and he had begun it but would not make an end of it  or at least not in the time agreed for  and it produced a most edifying Discourse between the Justice and the Weaver of which I shall give you a Part  The Clothier told his Story first and his complaint was as follows that  Edmund Pratt  the Person brought before him was a Journeyman Weaver that he had given him a Piece of Work to do which he promis'd to finish for him out of hand and that now he had neglected it that he had done part of it but did not finish it that he had oblig'd himself to deliver it by such a Day and should lose the Sale of it if it was not finish'd and sent to  London  in the time that he had deliver'd him the Warp such a time which was about Weeks before that he might have finish'd it in a Fortnight if he would work but that he had not above half done it and that he lay Drunk and sotting in the Alehouse and would not work that he promis'd him from time to time to go to Work and still whenever he came to look at him he was absent and gone to the Alehouse that at last when he entreated him to go to work  he answer'd him  flat  and  plain  he would not work that he did not want Money and would not work not he and for this Reason he came to his Worship for a Warrant to bring  Edmund  before him  The Justice answer'd him very sencibly  first  that as he  Edmund  was not an Apprentice or a hir'd CovenantServant bargain'd with for the Year  that is  for a certain time  and the like  the Case did not lie before him and that if the Fellow was a Knave and would not perform his Agreement he must sue him for his Bargain and would recover Damages against him at Law but that it was not the work of a Justice of the Peace and that he cou'd not make the Fellow work unless he would do it willingly However says the Justice I'll send for him and talk to him I cannot well grant a Warrant for him on such an Occasion but  pray go and tell him I would speak with him  This I mention because I think if the Laws of  England  are deficient in any thing it is in this namely that they do not empower the Justices to compel labouring People who undertake work to finish it before they be Employ'd by any other it is true the Law of Trespass and of Right and Wrong gives the injur'd Employer a Right of Action against such a Man and he shall upon hearing be condemn'd in such a Sum as will compensate the Damage to the Person injur'd and perhaps do Pennance in the County Jail at  last but then  the Suit is long chargeable  and  uncertain  and the Fellow perhaps poor so that you sue a Beggar and  catch an English Proverb  whereas cou'd the Justice of the Peace determine it in a summary way and oblige him to give Bail to perform the Work or send him to the House of Correction till he was humble enough to go about it I say if this was the Case much of the Mischief would be remedied that way  But this Deficiency of the Law it seems the Fellow knew and this made him not only saucy and peremptory to his Employer but very pert and almost impudent before the Justice himself as you will see  As soon as he was told the Justice would speak with him he answer'd readily he wou'd wait upon the Justice immediately and accordingly went when he appear'd the Justice told him the Complaint which was made against him when he had done the Fellow looking something Confident but giving no Answer the Justice spoke to him thus  You hear the Charge  Edmund  what do you say to it  Nothing  Sir says  Edmund  and so the Dialogue begun  Just  Nothing what do you mean by that Sir  Ed  And 't please your Worship I see no Answer it requires  Just  What does it require no Answer  Ed  No I think not he has told your  Worship a fine Story and your Worship has heard it what would he have more  Just  It is plain what he would have he would have his Work done  Ed  I believe he would and't please your Worship  Just  And you promis'd to finish it  Ed  And has he told your Worship so  Just  Yes he has  Ed  Then I suppose he has said all he has to say  Just  Well and what do you say to it then  Ed  Nothing Sir  Just  Why I find you are an impudent Fellow  Ed  Nay and't please your Worship can I be impudent in saying  nothing  Just  Yes you are impudent in not answering me when I ask you a Question  Ed  I have answer'd every Question your Worship has ask'd me  Just  I tell you what Mr charges you with and I ask you if it is true or not  Ed  Now indeed your Worship asks me that Question but you only ask'd me before what I had to say to Mr or to his Charge and I answer'd  that I had nothing to say to it  Just  Well you pretend to be nice in your Distinctions I see but what do you say to my Question now  Is the Charge he brings true or not  Ed  I hope your Worship will not be angry if I answer the Question by a Question  am I oblig'd to accuse myself  Just  Why no you are not  Edmund  that is true  I shall call him to prove it then  Ed  Will your Worship allow me to ask another Question  Just  Ay what is your Question  Ed  Won't your Worship be angry if I do ask a Question you should not like  Just  No no I won't be angry if you are not rude and saucy  Edmund  I shall not like that  Ed  I shan't be rude Sir but my Question is this if your Worship calls Mr to prove the Tale he has told you and he shou'd prove it are you empowr'd to try the Cause between us  Just  Why thou art a subtle Rogue  Edmund  I'll be very plain with thee I don't know whether I am or no but it's pity I should not for I think you deserve to be well handled if what he says is true  Ed  If I deserve it never so much I shall have no reason to be sorry if it may be out of your Worship's Power to handle me  Just  Well it may be in my Power too for ought I know I shall talk with Mr again and you shall hear farther pray attend here again to morrow Morning  Ed  Yes Sir so the Follow was dismiss'd and the Justice sent for the Clothier  The Clothier being come says the Justice to him well Mr  I have talk'd with your Workman  and as I told you before that  I thought the Matter did not lye before me  so I assure you he has told me so too in as merry a Manner as I could desire  and so he recited the Discourse that had happen'd between his Worship and the JourneyMan Weaver  He's an impudent Fellow says the Clothier I am sure he ought to be sent to the House of Correction for his saucy Tongue  Why that is true says the Justice but yet he spoke so warily and with a kind of saucy GoodManners with  your Worship  and  your Worship  at every word that tho' it was manifest he ridicul'd the Charge and ridicul'd you yet he was mighty civil to me and as he said indeed I could not lay him by the Heels for answering me that he had  nothing to say to you  Now the Case is this says the Justice 'tis evidient he has had some bad Counsel and somebody has instructed him what to say he demands you shou'd prove the Charge you bring and so indeed you must that is you must prove that he undertook your Work bargain'd to finish it by such a Time and that he has neglected it and that you are Damnified by his Neglect  All this I can easily prove Sir says the Clothier  Well but when you have done all says the Justice  as Edmund said  I do not see that I can Try the Cause it must be heard in the Court of the King's Bench or Common Pleas  and the Verdict and Damages must be given by a Jury 'tis a Breach of Covenant or Trespass and you must prosecute it in the ordinary Course  so the poor Clothier went away  it was not worth his while to sue the Fellow and be at the Charge of a Prosecution which tho' the Fellow was sure to be Cast and condemn'd to pay the Cost and Damages the Consequence would be only that he would run away or go to Jayl neither of which would turn to Account to the Clothier  Well however the Justice had amind to have another Dialogue with this  Edmund  and see whether he could make any thing of him or no so he sent for him again the same Day and when he came the following merry Dialogue began between them  Just  Come in  Edmund  I have talk'd with your Master  Ed  Not  my Master  and 't please your Worship I hope I am  my own Master  Just  Well your Employer Mr E the Clothier will the word Employer do  Ed  Yes yes and 't please your Worship any thing but  Master  Just  Well but why will you not finish the Piece of Work you began  Ed  Does he say I won't finish it Sir  Just  He says you don't finish it  Ed  There's much Difference and 't please you between don't and won't  Just  There's no great Difference on his side the Damage is the same for he wants the  Goods and that is a great loss to him  Ed  But there's a great deal of difference to me Sir if I had refus'd to finish it perhaps he might have had some Advantage on me  Just  All that you can say to that is perhaps that you have been too cunning for him that he did not tye you to a Time and take it under your Hand that you would finish it by that Time but  Edmund  you must not neglect the Man's Work when you have undertaken it  Ed  It may be I should not but as for must not and 't please your Worship I don't understand that  Just  Why you must not that is you cannot and be an honest Man  Ed  Why then if I do he may call me Knave that's all  Just  And it seems you do not matter that  Edmund  Ed  Not much indeed and 't please your Worship  Just  Nay I confess he that don't matter being a Knave may do a great many wicked things and yet not be liable to every Magistrate to take hold of him  Ed  Your Worship is pleas'd to mistake me I did not say I did not matter being a Knave but that I did not matter his calling me so I have done no dishonest thing by him  Just  Why is it not dishonest not to finish his Work according to Agreement  Ed  Yes if any Agreement had been made  Just  No doubt he put it to you expecting you would finish it in time  Ed  That he cou'd not do because he knew my way of Working before  Just  Pray what is that  Edmund  and what did he know  Ed  Why he knew that I never finish any peice of Work till I please  Just  And does he know when that is too  Edmund  pray when do you usually please to finish the Work you undertake  Ed  Why and 't please your Worship when I have finish'd ten Yards I come for my Money which is ten Shillings as by Agreement and then I go to another Work  Just  What Work what do you leave his Loom and go and work in another  Edmund  that would not be honest I am sure  Ed  No no and 't please your Worship I go to the Alehouse and work hard to spend it and when it is all spent then I come to work again  Just  And not before  Ed  No Sir and 't please your Worship never before  Just  And is this honest  Edmund  Ed  I don't enquire into that 'tis my way  Just  Your way but what's that to Mr E the Clothier  Ed  Why and 't please your Worship 'tis this to him that he knows 'tis my way that I never did otherwise and never shall and  he knew this before he put the Warp into the Loom and I did not promise I would do any otherwise so I am no Knave in it if I had promis'd otherwise then indeed he had something to say  Just  Very well so that as he knew your Custom you suppose he put his Work to you upon a supposition that you would act so  Ed  Yes Sir  Just  But can't you break your self of this wicked way  Edmund  Ed  It would be very hard to do it Sir after Years practice  Just  Thou art an old Drunkard I find  Edmund  have a care If I happen to catch thee with a GiddyHead I shall cure thee of the Staggers  Ed  O Sir and 't please your Worship you are very welcome if you catch me in the Corn put me in the Pound I am never fuddl'd and 't please your Worship  Just  But to sit Tippling to keep bad Hours go to the Alehouse aSundays all those things come within my Reach  Edmund  have a care  Ed  I am provided against all that Sir and 't please your Worship I lodge in an Alehouse so that I am always at Home he can't keep bad Hours that is athome in good Season nor you can't deny me Drinking in my own Chamber tho' it be on a Sunday I hope I am safe there  Just  Thou art a crafty Knave  Edmund  why thou settest up to be too cunning for the Law it self  Ed  No no and 't please your Worship I am an honest Drunken Fellow  Just  Well but  Edmund  shall I perswade thee to go and finish Mr E's piece of Stuff and he shall give thee thy Money beforehand  Ed  And 't please your Worship by no means then I shall never do it at all I am sure no it would be impossible and 't please your Worship by no means  Just  Why will nothing oblige you to be Honest  Ed  Yes yes want of Money that does it when I want Money I always go towork  Just  And never but then  Ed  No and please your Worship I work for nothing but Money and why should I work if I do not want Money would anybody work if they had Money enough  Just  No not if they had enough it may be they would not but what do you call enough  Ed  Why if in the Morning I have enough to spend for that Day  that's enough to me  for to Morrow I can work for more  Just  So you lay up nothing  Ed  Lay up Master what should I lay up for I have no Wife or Children to cry after me  Just  Well but hereafter  Edmund  you should consider hereafter you may be sick or lame or grow old  Ed  I ne'er trouble myself with hereafter not I alas and please your Worship what should I think of hereafter for while I can keep myself all is well I trouble nobody and when I can't the Parish must  Just  So that the only way to get you to finish the Clothier's Work is to get you to it next time your Money is spent and then let you have no more Money till 'tis done  Ed  That would do it effectually indeed but then I may chance to run away go to Work for somebody else and never finish it atall  Just  So that in short there is no way to deal with a Drunkard but to let him alone and let him go on his own Way Well I think the Clothier shall try you  Edmund  and if you do run away I'll tell him how he shall fetch you again without a Justice of Peace unless you run quite away and then the Country will be well rid of you  There was a great deal of farther Discourse between them in which  Edmund  was at last so saucy that the Justice found he was halfDrunk and set him in the Stocks and took care afterwards to have him punish'd too for some other MisBehaviour but all the Justice or the Clothier cou'd do cou'd not make him finish his Piece of Work till he pleas'd and that was a good while after  This Story has several useful Inferences depending upon it which is the reason of my being so particular in a thing of so small moment  As above it discovers a Deficiency as I said in the Laws here by which it is evident the Insolence of our labouringPoor cannot be so effectually governed as it were to be wish'd it might be  Edmund  should else have been humbled and have lain in Jail till he had come and begg'd the Clothier to give him leave to finish the Piece of Work without any Wages or that the Wages should have been given to the Poor  It is observable what a perfectly thoughtless temper possesses the Minds of the People here that they never lay up in the Time of Plenty for a Time of Scarcity  That they are not to be oblig'd either by fair means or foul to do their Work if but a Pot of StrongBeer to which they are Slaves be in their way according to the Character given them by one of our  English  Writers  In Drink and drunken Company delight  And what they get by  Day  they spend at  Night  Subjecting all their Labours to their Pots  The greatest Artists are the greatest Sots  I shall conclude this Letter with adding another Observation which I draw from the Story above and which I have by Experience found true also of these labouring Poor namely so little does a Sence of Justice or of Gratitude rest upon their Minds that not only they are thus Insolent in spight of  Double Pay  but in spight of prompt Pay or as some call it Pay by Advance  Nothing is more dangerous of its Kind than to Pay them by Advance and 'tis ten to one as  Edmund  said of himself if ever you have your Work done at all  There is a Proverb among the working People that there are two sorts of bad Masters  Those that Pay beforehand  Those that never Pay atall  And both they say make bad Servants and never should have their Work well finished  It is true that this is the Result of a general Baseness in the Servant but nothing is more certain than that to Pay beforehand is to ruin your Business and your Servant too and that if you have your Work done atall it is never well done and always with an illwill but of this hereafter  I am c  LETTER V  Sir  _I have given you a Sketch of the Insolence of our labouring Poor It is but too much Influence that this matter however triffling it may seem has had upon the general Tranquility of this Nation and is therefore well worth Notice  They are greatly mistaken who think that the poor People are below our Concern it is true in many Cases they are below our Resentment but 'tis apparent that the many Ways which the Poor find to make themselves uneasie to the Rich are such and the Advantages which they have in this Country by the Privileges they enjoy are also such that they bid fair for inverting the Order of things  in a Word  it is already true in a great measure that in  England  the Poor govern and the Rich submit the Case is in short that they clamour their Masters into and out of every thing they please and unless Men will be ever contending and scolding with them he can neither Trade with them or Employ them  Nay let me go farther we are aw'd by the Poor nothing is more frequent than to see Gentlemen bear the vilest Treatment from the meanest Fellows and that for  meer fear  pardon  me I do not say they are afraid of their Hands but really they are afraid of their Tongues and it is not altogether without reason as you shall hear at large in its Place  Nor is it easie for a Gentleman to live in any Place long without suffering the beastly Treatment of the Tongue from the Canaille or Mobb of the Place no Conduct the best the mildest the most prudent can protect him  If he is easie kind and good to them they impose upon him and that in the grossest Manner and no sooner have they done it but they expose him laugh at him and make their Boasts among their Gangs how they cheated him that he is Easie that is to say is a Fool and how they can impose upon him at any time  If he is sharp with them and exact will not be cheated and when he sees it resents exposes and detects them and turns them off then they rail at him the other way that he is hard and cruel will let nobody live by him would starve the Poor and would have a Poor Man's Labour for nothing and the like  If he is Generous and Free they strain that Generosity to its utmost Extent craving till the most bountiful Hand in the World must stop at last and deny or be blind and not see it self abused and then whenever you stop you lose all your Character for Generosity at one blow 'Tis too true of the Temper of these People what one of my Neighbours said to me from his dearbought Experience that if you carry an  Englishman  Mile on your Back and won't carry him you lose all the Title to his Favour and cancel all Obligation the Mile is forgot the odd Negative Mile is only remember'd Nay  says he  if you carry him all the Miles and at last do but set him down hard he will curse you to your Face  Upon the foot of this Temper you may expect to hear of some of the rudest unjust and most impudent things put upon the Gentlemen in this Country by the common People that you can imagine possible  As they impose upon the Generous so on the otherside they hate the Frugal if some Gentlemen live more sparingly than others and are more near and saving than these People like so that they cannot make a Spoil of them as they do of others if they will not suffer themselves to be impos'd  upon or cheated and resent it when they see it offer'd to them these they attack with opprobrious Language and revile them with Covetousness and not living as they ought to do with oppressing the Poor being cruel and barbarous to Poor Men and the like  These Reproaches especially where they are not Just are very grievous to Gentlemen to such especially whose Livesare really blameless and who ought to be Judges of their own way of living as they best know what they can or cannot expend or is proper for them to expend in the Port of Families and as these Gentlemen are loth to have such Characters among the Neighbourhood without reason this makes them bear with a Thousand Indignities and sometimes see themselves impos'd upon and us'd scurvily and yet take no Notice of it because they would not be mark'd for Severity or for hard Treatment of poor Men this is what I call being afraid of the Poor and they really are so afraid of them that they suffer themselves to be illus'd a thousand Ways when they see it plain enough but wink and make as if they did not see it atall only for fear of being counted so and so niggardly cruel hard to the Poor and the like  I was going a few Days ago to visit a Friend in a Country Village not far from  London  and being come to the Town where my Friend liv'd but not knowing his House I rode past it and past two more before I  found anybody to enquire of but at last I saw a Cluster or little Crowd of young Fellows standing together and chatting upon their earnest Affairs I suppose they seem'd to be all Servants four or five of them had Liveries on of several sorts the other look'd like Gardeners and one or two like Bricklayers when I came up to them I ask'd them what Gentleman liv'd at that House pointing to the first House that I had pass'd and which was indeed the Gentleman's House who I was to go to When I ask'd what Gentleman liv'd there the Rogues grinn'd and look'd upon one another and laugh'd Gentleman says one Gentleman says another but gave me no present Answer I saw them a little merry so I smil'd too and speaking pleasantly Well  says I if that is not as it should be  pray who lives at that House Why Sir says one of them very civilly but still laughing  we beg your Pardon  we did not laugh  as you  but at your mistakeing the Person that lives there for a Gentleman if you please to take it in our way of talking 'tis one Dog Kd adding the Gentleman's Sirname  well says I  and pray who lives there pointing to the next House why that's such another too  says the Fellow  that's Dog E adding there the Sirname of another well  says I  that's very good still and who lives at that House pointing at the third House O  says he  that  is a very honest Gentleman indeed that's Mr naming him with a great deal of Respect  Well Gentlemen said I and made myself as familiar with them as I could I see you are very merry upon your Neighbours pray let me ask you how you come to distinguish thus among 'em Why Sir says the Fellow Dog Kd is vastly Rich and lives like a Hog in his Stye does nobody any good but like a Dog snarles at the Rich and bites the Poor and therefore we think he lives more like a Dog than a Gentleman  Well says I and what's Mr He's just such another says the saucy Rogue he is worth the Ld knows how many thousand Pounds and he that ought to keep a Coach and six Horses keeps one Pair of Horses for two Coaches makes his Coachman work in his Garden because he will keep but one Gardener when he ought to keep three and instead of a thorow Livery gives his Men nothing but a Coat Hat and Stockings and is not that a Dog of a Gentleman Sir  says the Fellow  and clos'd it all with a broad Dn him by way of Elegance  I agreed to all this that I might have the rest of it out and it pleas'd them all mightily to see me laugh  well  says I  and what is the Gentleman at this House  O says another of them that's as honest a Gentleman as any in the Country and he lives like himself he keeps a better House and  more Servants than both those Misers and gives a better Livery and has more Horses in his Stable than both of them and yet he has not half their Estate but it may be  said I  he spends more than his Estate can afford 'tis no matter for that  says  the first he lives like a Gentleman and everybody loves him a poor Servant gets something in his House there's Gentlemen and Ladies always a visiting there and they are as merry as the Day's long and when they go away the Servants are the better for them the two DogGentlemen are always at  London  almost a Stockjobbing or somewhere or other I don't know where they are seldom athome so that they have no Company and keep no House worth a Farthing nobody is the better for them  I took my Leave of this knot of Gentlemen soon after gave 'em Sixpence to drink my Health and rid round anotherway to come into the Street again where I did at first that they might not see me go to the first Dog's House as they call'd him where I was really going  I took this time to think what a Liberty these Scoundrels took with the Gentlemen and how subject every Family is to the scurrilous Tongues of such People as these for when I came to consider the Circumstances of the three Families it stood thus The two first were exceeding Rich liv'd well and kept very good Equipages Servants Coaches and Horses as many as they had Occasion  for and not very few neither for I think the second kept twelve Servants and the first five or seven but they were both what we call managingMen that did not withhold what was proper as might be seen by the Houses they liv'd in which are indeed more like Palaces than PrivateGentlemen's Houses but they were Men that did not make Ducks and Drakes of their Money and throw it away on purpose for others to pick it up and laugh at them  But the third who they call'd  an honest Gentleman  was indeed of a differing kind one that kept a good House indeed but spent twice as much as his Revenue brought in kept more Horses and Servants too than he cou'd afford run into everybody's Debt was every now and then haunted with Bayliffs and arrested for Triffles and dunn'd continually by the Butchers Bakers and Cornchandlers and such like People and this was the honest Gentleman and in a few Years he was fain to take up put off Housekeeping thereabouts and go into the Country to live cheaper  But the reason of my telling this Story is to let you see what Treatment the Gentlemen suffer on these Accounts and that this is really a restraint upon them that they bear with a thousand Insolences from the People as well the Servants withindoors as the Workmen and trading People withoutdoors because of their Tongues and because  they would not be made the Scoff of such insolent Rogues without Cause and this indeed encourages the Crime for if they would contemn it more they would be insulted with it less nothing encouraging such ill Usage more than the Concern the Gentlemen shew about it but to proceed  I don't know anything can give you a more perfect  Idea  of the Behaviour of these sort of People who I call the LabouringPoor than their Combinations in their Business imposing upon the Gentlemen in the way of their Employments tho' all Combinations in order to raise the Price of Goods or Workmanship are against the known Laws of the Country  One Instance of this happens just now among the same sort of People who I have been mentioning I mean the  Manufacturers  who in the  West  of  England  that is to say the CloathingCounties which we call the  West  tho' they are  SouthWest  rais'd a kind of Rebellion to support their Insolence against their Masters and Employers The case was this  as I said before  there has been a sudden Run of Trade which has lasted now about two Years and the Workmen in the Country found that the Masters had pressing Orders for Goods  Taking the advantage of this they had twice before clamour'd to have their Wages raised and the Masters had rais'd them and that considerably but demanding a third advance  of Pay the Masters tho' in very civil Terms refus'd them nor were they able to give more Wages without losing by their Goods and told the Workmen so  Upon this the Workmen particularly the Weavers form'd a Combination among themselves not to Work for the Clothiers unless they rais'd their Wages to such a certain Rate as they had also agreed on among themselves They carried on this Combination to such a height as to gather together in a tumultuous manner to bring all the rest of the Workmen to join with them to this End they troop'd about the Towns and entring by Force into the Houses of such honest Weavers as they found were at Work they broke their Looms to pieces spoil'd the Warps and cut in pieces the Goods which they had been at Work upon insulting also the Masters and Employers in an outrageous manner to make them yield to raise the Wages which some were oblig'd to do for fear of their Lives or for fear of having their Houses plunder'd On the otherhand many of the quieter innocent poor Men who would have been glad to have gone on with their Business suffer'd extremely for having Work to do  and the Wages before being sufficent to maintain them  and their Families perhaps wanting a supply yet they durst not Work for fear of being Mobb'd  as above in short  they carry'd this Game on till the Government was oblig'd to send some regular Troops  down to protect the Clothiers and keep the Peace and reduce these mad Fellows by Force which was easily done and several of them had the Favour of being sent to Jail as they deserv'd but the Clemency of the Government spar'd them as to Punishment when it came to that Point  The next Account I shall give has a little more Mirth in it In a certain considerable MarketTown in  England  there was a Combination of  Pumpmakers  that is the  Pumpmakers  in that and two or three considerable Towns round made an Agreement that such and such Gentlemen ought to have new Pumps upon the Resolutions of this worthy Society no Gentleman in the Neighbourhood cou'd order a Pump to be mended when it was out of order but the  Pumpmakers  would tell him it was good for nothing him it cou'd not be mended and so his Worship must have a new Pump if he thought they impos'd upon him and that his Pump might be mended he would probably send for another  Pump maker  but it was all one for the other would be sure to tell him the same Story that the Tree was rotten below that it could not be mended nothing cou'd be done to it but just as before his Worship must have a new Pump and thus several of the Gentlemen it seems were ignorantly drawn in to the Expence of new Pumps without any manner of Necessity only for the Gain of those Rogues the  Pump makers  It happen'd that a particular Gentleman a Justice of the Peace and of a very good Estate in the Neighbourhood who was a little sharper than the rest fell under their Management he had a Pump which belong'd to his StableYard that happen'd to be out of order and he sent a Servant to the MarketTown near him for a  Pumpmaker  The  Pumpmaker  came readily look'd upon the Pump told the Gentleman the Pump cou'd not be mended but he must have a new one for the Fault was in the Tree it was rotten between Wind and Water and there was no Remedy  The Gentleman told him he did not doubt but his Pump might be mended for that it was a new Pump but a little while before and he would not have a new one again but must have it mended Upon this the Fellow told him he would take it up and look and accordingly takes it out of the Well the Gentleman being present all the while the Pump was taking up the designing Rogue was not able to play the Prank he intended for he purpos'd to have made a hole in it if he did not find one there but not being able to do that he acknowleg'd then that it might be mended and appointed to come the next Day to do it  To Morrow coming and two or three toMorrows but no  Pumpmaker  the Gentleman sent for him and so for many Days after oneanother and still his Answer was  he would come such or such a Day on  Tuesday  he would come on  Thursday  and on  Thursday  he would come a  Saturday  and on  Saturday  he would come a  Tuesday  and so from  Tuesday  to  Saturday  he kept the Gentleman in suspence and his Well lying open too for four or five Months Upon this the Gentleman sent to another Town a larger than the other about seven Miles off and there he met with the same Treatment exactly and by this time and not before the Gentleman perceiv'd it was a Trick agreed upon among them  To confirm himself in the Opinion of its being a Trick  as above  he sends his Servant once more and bids him tell the  Pumpmaker  that the Pump which he took out of the Well had met with a Disaster and was spoil'd by Accident as it lay in the Yard and a great Piece burnt off of it and that his Master desir'd him to come and make an Agreement with him for a new Pump the  Pumpmaker  perfectly deceiv'd said yes he would wait upon  Esq  the next Morning and accordingly he came when he came the Gentleman took no Notice of the Message he had sent but saluted him thus O Mr L I am glad to see you what you are come to do my Pump are n't ye indeed you have been unkind to be so long the Fellow said nothing a goodwhile upon which the Gentleman call'd one of his Servants here  Tanner  his  Man's name here is Mr L the  Pumpmaker  come to mend the Pump go with him and show it him Sir  says the Pumpmaker  I understood you had resolv'd to have a new Pump a new Pump  says the Gentleman  why you know you told me this would serve and you cou'd easily mend it Sir  says the Pumpmaker  your Man told me you wanted a new Pump upon this the Gentleman call'd his Man who he had instructed before what to say  Jacob says his Master  did you bid Mr come over to me to make me a new Pump  Yes  Sir  says Jacob  but who order'd you to say so  Jacob says the Master  why  says Jacob  I had been twenty times at his House to bid him come over to mend the oldone and your Worship knows he never came and I found what he wanted so I told him he should come to make a newone that I knew would bring him presently  The  Pumpmaker  would have deny'd it at first but  Jacob  told his Master plainly it was so and that he had been at the other  Pumpmaker's  in the Town and he would not come at all pretending it was the other Man's Work with this he laugh'd  No if he bad  says the  Pumpmaker I would have stuck by his Skirts  and began to be very sawcy  Well well  says the Gentleman  come go about it now and all will be well Sir says the Fellow I can't do it now I'll come a  Tuesday  and do it for you upon my Word  No no  says the Gentleman  I know you can do it now if you please if you will not do it tell me so if not I must send for another at that the Fellow laugh'd impudently and said do if you please what do you mean by that  says the Gentleman  you are very rude I don't doubt but I may have my Pump mended for my Money  Do then if you can Sir  says the Pumpmaker  for I won't meddle with it  Well then go about your Business  says the Gentleman  I will find  Pumpmaker's  enough I warrant ye  Not in this County says the Fellow jeering nor the next and away he went  The Gentleman finding it was a general Combination of the Society but resolving not to be impos'd upon by them waited awhile intending tho' it should cost him the more to send to  London  for a  Pumpmaker  but at length he got Notice that at a Town eight or ten Miles from him there was a  Pumpmaker  newly setup and who it was probable was not got into the Knot yet and besides did not know the Names of the Neighbouring Gentlemen yet or know their Faces or Dwellings so he concluded to send for him not to tell him what it was for or where he was to go  The Servant did his Business so well that the  Pumpmaker  came with him and manag'd so well when he came that in  about two Hours he fully mended the Pump when he had done and while the Gentleman was paying the poor Man somebody by accident call'd the Gentleman by his Name at which the  Pumpmaker  seem'd a little surpris'd and smil'd the Gentleman took Notice of it and ask'd him what he smil'd at the Man declin'd it a little but having mended the Pump and being well paid he confess'd at last that if he had known the Gentleman's Name before he durst not have come why so  says the Gentleman  why Sir  says he  we had all Notice that it was resolv'd in the Society that your Pump should not be mended and we durst not have done it what then  says the Gentleman  what was to be done with me nothing Sir  says he  only that you should be oblig'd to have a new Pump  Well  says the Gentleman  I hope you will tell them you have mended it won't you No indeed Sir  says the Pumpmaker  I dare not and I hope your Worship will not do me so much Prejudice The Gentleman promis'd Silence and away went the  Pumpmaker  But the Jest of the Story is still behind the first  Pumpmaker  finding he was sent for no more was mighty curious to know what was the reason of it and at length by some means or other come to know that the Pump was mended and set up again that encreas'd his Curiosity exceedingly for then he wanted  to know who had done it but that he could not come at by any means at last he offer'd the Gentleman's Servants to give them a Bowl of Punch to tell him upon this that Servant that had been so often sent to him took the hint and laid a Plot for him for he ow'd him a shrewd Turn for making him have so many WinterJourneys for nothing so he told the  Pumpmaker  that he would not tell him himself but if he would come to their Town and give them the Punch there that they might be merry he should know by one means or other  He promis'd and came accordingly and very merry they were not at the Gentleman's House but at a PublickHouse hard by In their Mirth they drank the Gentleman's Health and at last the  Pumpmaker's  Health that mended the Pump At length being most of them very drunk the unlucky Fellow that contriv'd it all proposed to the Company that they would all go and drink the Pump's Health in a draught of fair Water to cool them it was presently agreed to and so they jogg'd away to his Master's House he being gone to  London  some Weeks before when they came to the Pump they agreed to drink on their Knees at the Spout of the Pump without any Mugs or Glasses and so they did but when the  Pumpmaker's  Turn came to drink whether they held him fast or whether they threw him down or whether he being soundly  drunk fell down and somebody kept him there History does not acquaint us of the Particulars but they pump'd him so heartily and so effectually that never was PickPocket better pump'd in the Streets of  London  and it being withal a cold Night he had but a very indifferent Journey home however being very warm within he got no hurt by it nor could he ever tell who had done it for him or how he was manag'd atall  In another Place I met with the following Story of a Combination of Thatchers and 'tis as material to my Purpose as the other tho' not so long a Story A certain Gentleman in  Kent  who had the Management of some Part of his Estate in his own Hands and having every Year a great deal more Corn than his Barns would hold set up the rest in great Stacks or Reiks in his Yard as is usual in like Cases a Thatcher in the Neighbourhood was usually employ'd every Year to thatch this Gentleman's Stacks and his Work generally came to fifty Shillings or three Pound every Year  It happen'd one Year that a straggling  Welchman  who was hir'd for Harvestwork as is common in that County offer'd his Service to thatch the Stacks and having shown by his doing one that he understood it very well and could do it much better than they were done before and cheaper too the Gentleman employ'd him and he thatch'd the Stacks so well that he got Work in other  Places as well as there and afterwards settled in the Country and took a small Farm of the Gentleman so that he became a Tennant by which together with the Merit of his Workmanship he had a kind of a Title to the thatching of the Stacks ever after  Some time after this the Gentleman had a House to thatch for a Tennant a Storm of Wind having blown off great Part of the old Thatch and the poor Family being Sick they were in great Distress to have the House cover'd the Gentleman sent for his  Welchman  to thatch the House but was surpriz'd that the poor Man told him he cou'd not do it that the thatching of a House was done quite another way and with other Tools than thatching Stacks of Corn or Hay and he did not understand it atall  The Gentleman then sent to his old Thatcher but he said no let him that thatch'd his Stacks thatch his House he sent to another and he answer'd no Goodman was the Esquire's Thatcher and he would not take his Work out of his Hand he sent to a third and he answer'd no where was his  Welch  Thatcher he had brought a  Welchman  into the Country to take poor Men's Trade away and he would not Work for him  This  in short  went so far that the poor Family was sore distress'd and the Gentleman was oblig'd to remove them into an empty House for the present and buy Tiles to cover  his House that he might not be at the Mercy of the Thatchers any more  I cou'd load you with Examples of this kind and divert you too with agreeable Tales upon the Subject but tho' it would make my Account as pleasant to you as possible yet I would not have my Letters be a meer Collection of Story these may intimate to you that the Behaviour of which I complain is not confin'd to one or two Classes of Men but in a word a general Spirit of Insolence and Dishonesty possesses the People I am speaking of and the Greivance is come now to such a height that it calls for a speedy Remedy for if some Laws are not very quickly made effectually to regulate the Conduct of these People the Gentlemen in  England  will live far less happily than in other Parts of the World and above all far less than they used to do in this Part of it  There are two other sorts of People here whose Insolence is so very particular that indeed there is sometimes no bearing it and these are HackneyCoachmen and Watermen These are two sorts of People who have not the Goods but the Lives of the People they are concern'd with in their Charge  The first of these have once by their overgrown Rudeness oblig'd the Government to take Notice of them and make Laws for their Regulation and as there are Commissioners appointed for receiving the Tax they  pay to the Publick so those Commissioners have Power to hear and determine between the Drivers and their Fair upon any Abuse that happens  And yet the ordinary Coachmen abate very little of their abusive Conduct but not only impose in Price upon those that hire them but refuse to go this or that way as they are call'd whereas the Law obliges them to go wherever they are legally requir'd and at reasonable Hours This treatment and the particular saucy impudent Behaviour of the Coachmen has been the Occasion of innumerable Quarrels Fighting and Abuses afronting Gentlemen frighting and insulting Women and such Rudenesses that no civil Government will or indeed ought to suffer and above all has been the Occasion of the killing several Coachmen by Gentlemen that have been provoked by the villainous Tongues of those Fellows beyond the Extent of their Patience  It was but very lately that a Gentleman coming out of a Tavern in  Fleetstreet  call'd a HackneyCoach about ten a Clock at Night the Fellow came immediately which made it evident that he was not hir'd or in waiting when he came he ask'd the Gentleman where he was to go before he open'd the Door the Gentleman told him he would tell him when he was in his Coach and bade him open the Door  This the Gentleman did because he suspected by his Question that he would not carry him he being to go to the King's slaughterHouse near  EastSmithfield  Upon the Gentleman's refusing to tell him  he said  that then he would not carry him and getting up into his Coachbox drove away  West  to the Standing where he was when he was call'd one of the Drawers of the Tavern standing by tells the Gentleman that if he pleas'd to tell him where he was to go he would bring the Fellow back and make him carry him so the Gentleman told him it was to  EastSmithfield  Away goes the Boy to the Coachman and without saying a word to him till he was just at the Coachside here Coach  says the Boy  and opening the Door himself jump'd in and shut the Door again before the Fellow could get down when the Coachman got down  turn about says the Boy  not giving the Coachman time to say  where must I go  The Coachman after some grumbling turn'd about but would then know where he was to go I'll tell you presently  says the Boy  drive on when he had gone a little farther the Boy call'd to him to hold which being just at the TavernDoor where the Gentleman had spoken to him the Coachman began to see he was catch'd and that it was the same Person upon which he drove on a goodway the Boy still calling to him to hold but to  no purpose till the Fellow had hurried him down as far as  FleetBridge  The Clamour the Boy made oblig'd the Fellow to stop at last so he gets down to let the Boy out but the Boy held the Door fast and would not come out but bad him turn about again which the Coachman refus'd and offer'd to pull the Boy out but he was too strong for that so that the Coachman was puzzl'd and knew not what to do but offer'd to go back if the Boy would tell him where he was to go but the Boy would not do that neither upon this the Coachman got up in the Box again and making as if he would turn again turns halfabout and whipping his Horses on a sudden drives down by the side of  FleetDitch  and stops of a sudden in the Dark whipps off the Figures from both sides of his Coach having observ'd that thev had not yet taken the Number of it and when he had done this he drives on again the Boy supposing he had Advantage enough of him let him go on to see where the Fellow would drive him but here the Coachman was too many for him for at the same time that he whipp'd off the two Figures from his Coach he had very dextrously hang'd on a wrong Figure in the stead of them  The Boy letting him go on as I have said he drove him into  LeatherLane  in  Holbourn  and there would have perswaded the Boy to come out again but to no purpose  upon which he takes both the Horses out leaves the Coach in the Street and the Boy in it and getting up upon one of the Horses rides away  The Boy was not aware of this for a greatwhile but after some time finding how he was trick'd he gets out gets a Watchman to bring his Lanthorn and taking the Number of the Coach goes his way home thinking  as indeed had it been true if he had gotten the right Number  or Figure that he had Advantage enough of the Coachman  The Coachman had set a Spy to observe what pass'd who giving Notice that the Boy was gone he sent another Man with a Pair of Horses and fetch'd away the Coach  The next Day the poor Coachman whose real Number this Fellow had put upon the Coach instead of his own was surpriz'd with a Summons left at his House to appear before the Commissioners but as he had it seems had no Broil upon his Hands nor given any Cause of Complaint that he knew of he went frankly to the Place to see what was the Matter  The Gentleman and the Drawer both appear'd and made a grievous Complaint as well they might and then the Coachman was call'd but the Gentleman and Drawer was confounded when they saw a Man appear which they neither of them knew any thing of the Boy insisted upon the Number of the Coach and brought the Watchman  to support his Evidence one swearing it was the Number which was upon the Coach in which he was driven about by Force and the Watchman swore it was the Number upon the Coach which was left in the Street and which the Boy call'd him to  This put the poor innocent Coachman to prove where he was all Day and what People he carried which as it happen'd he was very well able to do so it was concluded that the other Coachman had got a Counterfeit Figure and they cou'd make no more of it the Coachman having been too cunning for the Boy but you will observe on the otherhand that had they found the right Person which they would easily have done if they had had his right Figure they would have punish'd him very severely  For refusing to carry the Gentleman when he was first call'd  For carrying the Boy away when he call'd to him to hold  For leaving the Coach with the Boy in it who  tho' a Boy  was actually his Fair and ought to have been carry'd where he had given Orders  But the Coachman was too old for the Boy in that so he escap'd what he deserv'd at that time and they do indeed often escape and run the venture of being punish'd which makes them still so insolent that it is grievance  almost unsufferable many People give them just what they will have rather than have the trouble of prosecuting them and this hardens them but on the otherhand sometimes they meet with Justice or rather Justice meets with them and then they are handled as they deserve  The next are the Watermen and indeed the Insolence of these tho' they are under some Limitations too is yet such at this time that it stands in greater Need than any other of severe Laws and those Laws being put in speedy Execution  Some Years ago one of these very People being Steersman of a Passageboat between  London  and  Gravesend  drown'd three and fifty People at one time The Boat was bound from  Gravesend  to  London  was very full of Passengers and Goods and deep loaden The Wind blew very hard at  South West  which being against them oblig'd them to  turn to Windward  so the Seamen call it when they tack from side to side to make their Voyage against the Wind by the help of the Tide  The Passengers were exceedingly frighted when in one tack stretching over the Stream in a Place call'd  LongReach  where the River is very broad the Waves broke in upon the Boat and not only wetted them all but threw a great deal of Water into the Boat and they all begg'd of the Steersman or Master not to venture again He sawcy and impudent  mock'd them ask'd some of the poor frighted Women if they were afraid of going to the  Devil  bid them say their Prayers  and the like  and then Stoodover again as it were in a Jest The Storm continuing he shipp'd a great deal of Water that time also By this time the rest of the Watermen begun to perswade him and told him  in short  that if he Stoodover again the Boat would founder for that she was a great deal the deeper for the Water she had taken in and one of them begg'd of him not to venture he swore at the Fellow call'd him Fool bade him let him alone to his Business and he would warrant him then used a vulgar SeaProverb which such Fellows have in their Mouths  Blow Devil the more Wind the better Boat  The Fellow told him in so many Words he would drown all the Passengers and before his Face began to strip and so did two more that they might be in Condition to swim for their Lives This extremely terrify'd the Passengers who having a Cloth or Tilt over them were in no Condition to save their Lives so that there was a dreadful Cry among them and some of the Men were making way to come at the Steersman to make him by Force let fly the Sail and stand back for the shore but before they could get to him the Waves broke in upon the Boat and carried them all to the Bottom none escaping but the three Watermen that were prepar'd to Swim  It was but poor Satisfaction for the Loss of so many Lives to say the Steersman was drown'd with them who ought indeed to have died at the Gallows or on the Wheel for he was certainly the Murtherer of all the rest  I have many times pass'd between  London  and  Gravesend  with these Fellows in their smaller Boats when I have seen them in spite of the Shrieks and Cries of the Women and the Perswasions of the MenPassengers and indeed as if they were the more bold by how much the Passengers were the more afraid  I say  I have seen them run needless Hazards and go as it were within an Inch of Death when they have been under no Necessity of it and if not in Contempt of the Passengers it has been in meer Laziness to avoid their rowing and I have been sometimes oblig'd especially when there has been more Men in the Boat of the same Mind so that we have been strong enough for them to threaten to cut their Throats to make them hand their Sails and keep under Shore not to fright as well as hazard the Passengers when there was no Need of it  One time being in one of these Boats all alone coming from  Gravesend  to  London  the Wind freshn'd and it begun to blow very hard after I was come about three or four Mile of the way and as I said above that I always thought those Fellows were the more venturous when their Passengers were the most  fearful I resolv'd I would let this Fellow alone to himself so I lay down in the Boat as if I was asleep as is usual  Just when I lay down I call'd to the Waterman It blows hard Waterman  said I  can you swim no Sir  says he  nor can't your Man swim neither  said I  no Sir  says the  Servant  well then says I take care of yourselves I sshall shift as well as you I suppose  and so down I lay However I was not much dispos'd to Sleep but kept the Tilt which they cover their Passengers with open in one Place so that I could see how things went  The Wind was fair but overblow'd so much that in those Reaches of the River which turn'd crossway and where the Wind by consequence was thwart the Stream the Water went very high and we took so much into the Boat that I began to feel the Straw which lay under me at the Bottom was wet so I call'd to the Waterman and jesting told him they must go allhands to the Pump  he answer'd  he hop'd I should not be wet but it's bad Weather Master  says he  we can't help it No no  says I  'tis pretty well yet go on  By and by I heard him say to himself It blows very hard and every now and then he repeated it and sometimes thus 'Twill be a dirty Night 'twill be a terrible Night  and the like  still I lay still and said nothing  After some time and his bringing out several such Speeches  as above  I rouz'd as if I had but just wak'd well Waterman  says I  how d'ye go on very indifferently  says he  it blows very hard ay so it does  says I  where are we a little above  Erith says he  so down I lay again and said no more for that time  By and by he was at it again it blows a Frett of Wind and it blows very hard  and the like  but still I said nothing at last we ship'd a dash of Water over the Boat'shead and the spry of it wetted me a little and I started up again as if I had been asleep Waterman  says I  what are you doing what did you ship a Sea ay  says the Waterman  and a great one too why it blows a Frett of Wind well well  says I  come have a good Heart where are we now almost in  Gallions says he  that's a Reach below  Woolwich  Well when we got into the  Gallions  Reach there the Water was very rough and I heard him say to his Man  Jack  we'll keep the WeatherShore aboard for it grows dark and it blows a Storm ay thought I had I desir'd you to stand in under shore you would have kept off in meer Bravado but I said nothing by and by his Mast broke and gave a great Crack and the Fellow cry'd out  Lord have mercy upon us  I started up again but still spoke chearfully what's the matter now  says I  Ld Sir  says he  how can you sleep why my Mast is come by the board well well  says I  then you must make a Goosewing a Goosewing why  says he  I can't carry a knot of Sail it blows a Storm well  says I  if you can't carry any Sail you must drive up  under shore then you have the Tide under foot and with that I lay down again The Man did as I said a piece of his Mast being yet standing he made what they call a Goosewing Sail that is a little Piece of the Sail out just to keep the Boat steddy and with this we got up as high as  Blackwall  the Night being then come on and very dark and the Storm increasing I suffer'd myself to be perswaded to put in there tho' five or six Mile short of  London  whereas indeed I was resolv'd to venture no farther if the Waterman would have done it  When I was on shore the Man said to me Master you have been us'd to the Sea I don't doubt why you can sleep in a Storm without any Concern as if you did not value your Life I never carry'd one in my Life that did so why 'twas a wonder we had not founder'd why  says I  Friend for that you know I left it all to you I did not doubt but you would take care of yourself but after that I told him my other Reason for it the Fellow smil'd but own'd the thing was true and that he was the more cautious a great deal for that I took no thought about it and I am still of Opinion that the less frighted and timerous their Passengers are the more cautious and careful the Watermen are and the least apt to run into Danger whereas if their Passengers appear frighted then the Watermen grow sawcy and audacious show themselves vent'rous and contemn the Dangers which they are really expos'd to  I have heard abundance of Tragical Stories of these Fellows and I know some of them to be true indeed there are very many Lives lost by their audacious Carriage What I have said may give you a true  Idea  of their general Behaviour and that  in a word  they are beyond Belief abusive insolent and saucy even to the People that they get their Bread by insomuch that 'tis an Evil so growing and so offensive that there is a general Cry against it and yet such is this glorious thing call'd  English Liberty  that I scarce see it probable there can be any suitable Provision made against it  I am  c  LETTER VI  Dear Brother  _I HAVE in my  last  given you a short View of the Behaviour of our labouring Poor who I call Servants withoutDoors and perticularly let you see that as I said before they are not atall the better for the advance of Price on their Labour but that on the contrary that it is all in spite of DoublePay  It is hard to say it of rational Creatures and such as we are to call Christians but I shall be justified from the Experience of most of the Gentlemen that employ Workmen and keep Servants that the Poor are not to be won it is impossible to oblige them no not with the advance of their Wages  I shall now give you the trouble of showing you that it is  the same thing  in its Degree with the Servants  within Doors  only with this Distinction that the Aggravations are greatest in the latter because their Obligations are generally greater and they are treated with more Distinction of which I shall speak at large in its Order but I confine myself to the Particular of encrease of Wages in which Case it is not my Opinion only  I assure  you  that this raising the Price of Wages has ruin'd the Servants and made them worse I say 'tis not my Opinion only 'tis the Experience of the whole Nation and yet unhappily all the Masters and Mistresses in  England  are drawn into it by an unaccountable Concurrence of Causes which it is not easie to give a Reason for  The general Complaint of the badness of Servants makes those few that are good for anything so valuable that Masters and Mistresses think they can never do too much to encourage them so they level themselves to them in their Intimacies load them with Gifts with Cloaths and other Advantages and the mechanick Spirit not able to make a right Judgment of things judges presently in his own Favour  namely  that his own Merit has procur'd him all that this exalts him in his own Opinion and  in a Word  ruins him for Pride and a good Servant are as inconsistent as Darkness with Light Thus the few good Servants that come upon the Stage of the World are ruin'd and spoil'd and that very Bounty which is the Reward of their early goodBehaviour and should be the Encouragement of their Diligence and Humility makes them unsufferable makes them familiar arrogant proud impertinent and at last impudent But I shall give  you a long Letter upon the Subject of the Usage of Servants by their Masters I am at present upon the Alternative  viz  the Usage of Masters by their Servants and that under the Obligations of advance of Wages or  as I call it  in the Case of Labourers  Double Pay  Some think that the demand for Servants is greater in  England  than it us'd to be and I believe it is so not that I will undertake to say the Nation is richer because that might be disputed but that Luxury and living is encreas'd that I believe nobody will deny that People live more profusely keep greater Equipages and more Servants than ever was done before  As there is a greater Demand for Servants so they are not only oblig'd to take up with such as can be had but to give more Wages than usual to procure them  There may be something in the publick Circumstances of the Nation which has been drein'd of People  Men especially  by a long and fatal War of near Years which carried away if the Judgment of those who understand that Part may be depended upon above five Hundred Thousand Men out of the three Kingdoms first and last either kill'd or run into foreign Service or dead of Diseases in the Service or otherwise remov'd from the general Body of the People  Our Plantations carry off every Year very great Numbers of Servants especially of the Female Sex of which they tell us that there has within thirty Years past above gone away voluntarily to  Virginia  and the neighbouring Colonies meerly to seek their Fortunes  as they call it  which in a word is the main Support of those Colonies as well for their Service as for breeding and multiplying the People there for those do not go on the Terms of transported Felons but they bind themselves for five Years more or less and generally when their Time is expir'd sometimes before it get marry'd and settl'd turn Planters and by Industry grow rich or get to be Yearly Servants in good Families upon Terms  that is  to have Wages and not to work in the Fields as at first they did and these  as I am assur'd  make much better Servants than those they leave behind them in  England  NB  The chief Numbers of these Voluntier Servants go out of  Scotland Ireland  and the  West  and  North  of  England  many more than from  London  Now it may be true that these things lessening the Numbers of Servants and on the other hand the manner of living among the better Sort causing a greater Number of Servants  to be wanted both together may cause the rate of Servants Wages to rise as scarcity of any Goods and the encrease of the Demand for them raises the Value at Market  But the Mystery of all this is What shou'd be the reason why the Servants shou'd be the worse for it for that I refer you to what I said before namely  the Error is in their Morals  the Money prompts their Vice and their Vice depraves their Manners so that very Advantage which shou'd encourage them to Diligence and an humble Behaviour is the ruin both of their Diligence and Behaviour  I have a remarkable Story to tell you to illustrate and confirm this in which not the Brutishness of one Servant is concern'd but after it the Behaviour of a great Number and I think indeed it may give you an  Idea  of the general Temper and Conduct of Servants among us great part of the  Story  I am particularly acquainted with and can therefore vouch the Truth of the Fact  A Gentleman a particular Friend of mine and by that means  as I have said  I came to a true Account of the Case  had a Groom  whom he took from the HorseHeels to be his particular Footman or Serving man to wait upon him wherever he went upon which Remove he considerably augmented his Wages and as my Friend lov'd Sport and kept a good Pack of FoxHounds he took the more Delight in this Fellow because he was a good Horseman lov'd the Game too and was always  a keen Sportsman in the Field and which still added to the Value he had for him he knew him to be a very stout Fellow of his Hands and had often seen him try'd  This Fellow however as is the Fate of most Scoundrels cou'd not bear his good Fortune but believing himself advanc'd not in Kindness to him but on a pure account of his wonderful Merit grew proud and in the first Place uneasie to his FellowServants by his haughty Carriage and sometimes he took upon him to be saucy to his Master  It was upon an Accident happening one Day in their Sport  viz  that he rid over one of the Hounds that his Master was it seems in some Passion with him upon it and  Edward    so they call'd him  gave his Master two or three very insolent saucy Answers that so provok'd his Master who was angry before that he lifted up his Cane at him once or twice as if he intended to lend him a Turn or two with it but did not strike at that time when  Edward  instead of shifting from his Master as a modest Fellow wou'd have done fac'dabout to him and as his Master's Hand was lifted up as if to strike tho'  as he said  he did not intend to strike him he said to him with a kind of a sawcy Air and a Grin  Sir Sir don't strike me pray don't strike me  Why Sir says the Master  why shou'd I not strike you I'm sure you deserve it  But Sir says Edward  I desire you wou'd not strike me because I shall be apt to strike again  Say'st thou so  Edward says the Gentleman his Master smiling and as he said to me all his Passion went away that Moment  Come  Edward  Thou bast a good Stick in thy Hand and I'm sure a better than mine  but since it is come to that  here's nobody by and I give thee my Word for it thou shalt have fair Play and if thou art too hard for me  I forgive thee  and do thy best but  he added  depend upon it  Edward  if I have the better of thee thou wilt feel me a little  therefore  look to thy self  Edward  If the Fellow had been Master of the least Grain of Modesty he wou'd have ask'd his Master's Pardon  and said  that he did not desire to engage with him and he might easily have seen that his Master who indeed was one of the besthumour'd Gentlemen in  England  at one soft Word wou'd have forgiven him all that had pass'd but he was the same  sawcy Edward  as before and return'd in a grumbling sawcy way  That he wou'd not be can'd by ne'er a Master in  England  Never hereafter it may be  Edward says his Master  but it happens so I doubt that you must now  and with that Word he laid him home a smart Blow or two upon the Shoulders not striking at his Head at first when  Edward  felt it come hard it rais'd his Mettle and he struck again indeed  as he said he wou'd  and follow'd it with a strong Hand and a good Heart for a great while nay he play'd his Staff so well and his Blows came so thick  that  as his Master said Edward  for awhile beat him a little out of his Play and hurt one of his Hands at the first or second Blow  But his Master who understood a Staff somewhat better than  Edward  took all his Blows upon his Cane and return'd them so warmly that at last  Edward  cry'd  Quarter No no  Edward  said his Master No Quarter Fight or Run  is the Word and so follow'd him with his Blows very thick Well  Edward  was stout too and he cou'd not  Run  but defended himself again a little while and then cry'd  Quarter  again  No Edward  says his Master  no Quarter I tell you  and laid furiously at him so that he broke his Head in two or three Places  Edward  seeing the Blood come was rather enrag'd than daunted  and said aloud  and in a kind of Fury  What do you intend to murther me No no Edward  says his Master  a broken Head won't kill you Fight  or  Run  Edward  that's the Bargain you know  and still they laid on aboth sides  You may kill me if you please  says Edward  I'll never Run for the stoutest Man alive tho' I die upon the Spot  and with that he flung himself off of his Horse  for the first of the Fight was on Horseback  and comes up to his Master in a Rage and almost unhors'd him But his Master spurring his Horse sprung from him a little and throwing himself off from his Horse also came at him onfoot too  Edward  seeing that strove to closein with his Master but cou'd not easily do it yet after some time he got  within his Blows and boldly collar'd him but his Master being a strong Man disingag'd himself and struck up his Heels Now  Edward  says his Master the Fight's over I am no more fighting with thee as thy Equal  But now  as thy Master I  must correct thee for thy Impudence  upon which he can'd him heartily and very severely and the next Day sent him to the House of Correction where he was soundly lash'd then sent him his Wages and dismiss'd him his Service  Here was a Specimen of an  English  Servant who had not his Master been one of the bravest and stoutest Gentlemen in the Kingdom  Edward  had triumph'd over him for  Edward  was really a bold daring resolute Fellow as the whole Encounter testifies  When you read this Story you will blame the Gentleman perhaps for engaging thus Voluntier with his Servant especially at such Weapons too that many a course brawny Fellow may be an Overmatch for a Gentleman that he ought to have conceal'd his Resentment 'till he had brought him home and then have sent him to the House of Correction as he did afterwards or that at first instead of caning him he should have run him thro' and sent him to the Devil for a better Master  But several Things alter the Case first as for killing Servants for their Insolence that will not do in  England  at all neither would it be well if it were lawful for many Reasons the Constitution of  England  refers all  Justice of that Kind to the Laws and it would have brought the Master into a Labyrinth of Trouble besides the Crime of it  It is true the Master levell'd himself too much and  as a neighbouring Gentleman afterwards told him  it was a Kind of Excess of Gallantry to measure his Staff with his Footman who eat his Bread and wore his Livery but as he scorn'd to be threat'ned with the  Battoon  of a Scoundrel and on the otherhand knew his own Ability to deal with him it was a Kind of Sport to him at first tho' as he told me in relating the Story  for I had it from his own Mouth  He did not think he should have had his Hands so full with him as he had  Again as to killing him or running him thro' you are to observe that our  English  Gentlemen when they are a hunting do not ride with Swords or FireArms as you do in  France  but with a single white Belt about them and a long Whip which they call a  HuntingWhip  in their Hands and it was by meer Accident that this Gentleman had a good Cane in his Hand for  Edward  had a strong Oaken Plant as they call it here which is a very good Weapon in the Hand of a stout Fellow as  Edward  was  But this is by the by the Case was as above and  Edward  was handsomely can'd as he deserv'd and was very coursly us'd too afterwards  as I told you  at the House of Correction whither his Master sent him for as  his Master was in Commission of the Peace he was capable of committing him to the House of Correction without another Magistrate  But I have not quite done with  Edward  yet for he went about the Country raving afterwards at his Master reporting That he had beaten him unmercifully with  any Provocation or Fault that he would have murther'd him if he had not at  been forced to resist him and that now  had sent him to the House of Correctio  because he could not have his Will of him▪  This grew into a Clamour about the  +try and it came to that Height that some  the Fellow Servants began to talk round+ly about it One said He would not be us'd so by any Master in  England  and that as they knew  Edward  to be a stout Fellow they said he was able to have defended himself and he was a Fool he did not and in short they carried it so far that they began to be saucy and to insult the Gentleman as he went about the Country Once in particular as he was riding on Horseback thro' a little Village not far from the Place where he liv'd there happen'd to be a Gang of Footmen and Gentlemen's Gardeners and such Fellows at an Alehouse Door and they began to flout him and throw out their saucy Jests at him and one call'd out to his Man You  Ralphson  that it seems was the Fellow's Name have a Care you'll have a Drubbing next time it may be The Gentleman  took no Notice of it at all only as he was riding before on a pretty full Trot he check'd his Pace a little upon it and went sostly to hear what else they said and as they were far from being modest in their Speech one of them calls out to another who stood over the Way  JACK would you have been serv'd so JACK Jack  answer'd  No not I  and swore to it by his Maker the first return'd No  Damn him  nor I I would I had been in  Edward  's Place  Jack  I would have shewn him the Difference of it and then added the usual Oath B G  I would not have stood still to be murther'd  I would have let him known  Servants are not Dogs  there's never a Gentleman in  England  should have us'd me so  Ay  says a Third  Edward  was a Fool everybody knows  Edward  is as stout a Fellow as any in all the Country and was able to have dealt with him ay with two such as he  says the other  But  Edward  's a modest Fellow and was loth because it was his Master Loth  Says the other  if it had been the best Master that ever wore a Head I wou'd not have took it of him I wou'd it had been my Lot he shou'd have repented abusing a Servant as long as he liv'd G Damn him  The Gentleman stopt his Horse short at this Fellow's Words but did not turn about or look behind him nor did the Fellow baulk his Language for his being heard but  the Gentleman I say stopping a little and calling his Servant up to him Whose Servant is that  says he  His Man told him Sir  Edward W  's Very well  says his Master  and whose Servant is  Jack  pray And his Man told him whose Man he was also  One of the Gang while the Gentleman call'd his Man up to him calls out to the First and with the usual Oath  Damn me  he knows you  Tom  says he he asks his Man if you are not Sir  Edward W  's Coachman know me  says he  Damn me let him know me anybody may know me I am Sir  Edward W  's Coachman I a'n't ashamed of my self Damn me my Master's a very honest Gentleman Damn me if I had such a Master as he I wou'd overthrow him the first time I drove him over  Chalkhill  and break his Neck B G he should murther no more Servants I warrant him  All this was so loud and with so much Insolence that as my Friend told me he had a great deal to do to restrain his Passion but he consider'd that they were all Footmen and Gardeners and such Fellows Servants among the neighbouring Gentlemen  and that he might have better Sport with them as he call'd it another Way also it came into his Head that this very Fellow as saucy as he was ought to have Justice done him for that it was certain by his Way of talking that  Edward  or somebody for him had  told a Pack of horrid Lies to this Fellow and that the Story had not been handed about as it ought to be told so he went off and rode immediately to the Gentleman's House whose Servant had treated him thus and finding him at home tells him the whole Story what his Coachman had said of him and the Manner of it then desiring a Pen and Ink and Paper he set it all down in Writing and call'd in his own Servant who Sir  Edward  examin'd upon Oath for they were both Justices to the Particulars and the Servant both remembring the Words exactly and knowing the Fellows made Oath to the Substance of it all his Examination agreeing exactly with his Master's Narration of the Fact  When he had done thus he added And now Sir  Edward  you must give me Leave to observe to you that I am satisfied your Coachman and all the rest of them have one Thing to be said in their Favour namely That they have  Edward  's Story wrong and that they understand I strook and can'd my Man either without Cause or without a sufficient Cause and that I would have murther'd him and the like for I have been told the Fellow does make out his Story in such a Manner being ashamed to tell the whole Truth of it so that I find I am obliged by these Gentlemen Servitors to tell the Truth and make the Story publick that I may not pass for such a Master as your Coachman thinks  me to be Pray therefore give me Leave to let you into the short History of the Affair between my Man  Edward  and I  With all my Heart  says Sir Edward  for I have been told the Story a great many Ways already and perhaps none of them right upon this the Gentleman tells him the whole Story in the Manner as I have related it above  Well Sir  says Sir Edward  upon my Word you have but given him Part of his Due tho' indeed you acted a Kind of Excess of Gallantry to measure your Staff with a Footman who eat your Bread I assure you  Edward  wou'd have been too hard for me if I had done so But after all  added Sir Edward  what had my Rogue to do with it I assure you I shall take him to Task for it another Way No Sir  says my Friend  if your Servant cou'd but be found I wou'd first be glad to hear in what Manner he has been inform'd of the Story for if  as I say  he he has been misinform'd of the Thing and that by  Edward  himself then he is not so much to blame and I must take Care to prevent  Edward  's telling his Tale any more or I shall be mob'd by all the Gentlemen's Servants in the Country  Truly Sir  says Sir Edward  I think we and all the Gentlemen in the Country are mob'd by our Servants already but I promise you Sir I will take Care to do you Justice upon my Servant he shall insult you no more  upon this he call'd another Servant and sent him out to look for  Thomas  the Coachman  Thomas  had suspected that the Gentleman was gone to his Master's and watch'd him and supposing he should be sent for took care that when his Fellow Servant came for him he should lye for him and carry back Word that he could not be found for that Servants will always lye for one another is no new Thing here But as soon as ever he understood  Esq  C  was gone Home he comes and takes care tho' at a Distance that his Master should see him rather before anybody should tell him he was come that he might rather seem to offer himself than be call'd  As soon as his Master saw him he in a Manner that might let the Fellow see he was angry call'd to him  Come hither Mister I must speak with you a little  on the other hand  Thomas  to let his Master see a little that he  intended to be saucy  answer'd very loud  Yes Sir  and so comes on when he was come What's the Meaning Sir  says Sir Edward  that you behave so that Gentlemen are oblig'd to come to me and complain of your abusing them on the Highway  Sir  says Thomas  I abuse nobody  Says Sir Edward  Yes you have abus'd an honest Gentleman and one that all the County knows to be so and you have abus'd him in such a Manner as no Villain but your  self could have the Impudence to do and as no Servant of mine shall be suffer'd to do I assure you  As you please Sir for that  says Thomas  I know who you mean Sir  Esq  C  has been here I suppose and made his Complaint I wish I had been at home you should have heard me say all that I said of him to his Face I do not think any Servant ought to be civil to him  What mean you by that Sir  sayr Sir Edward  I assure you it was well for you then that you was not here for if you had said that to his Face and in my House too Sir that you have said behind his Back I assure you I wou'd have sent you to the House of Correction my self you begin very saucily methinks what a Master have I been to you that you shou'd give me such an Answer  To the House of Correction Sir  says Thomas  with a Kind of a Grin and for  Esq  C  I ne'er was sent to the House of Correction yet nor never threat'ned with it before and I have done nothing to deserve it now Sir if you don't like my Service Sir you may please to provide your self I won't be sent to the House of Correction for talking to such a Man as  Esq  C  Very well Sir  says Sir Edward  I'll take your Warning but that is not to the Purpose I must still have Satisfaction from you Sir about your abusing a very honest Gentleman  for I will have the Story out to the Bottom  A Gentleman Sir he's no Gentleman  says Thomas  he does not deserve the Name of a Gentleman and I will affront him as often as ever I see him let it be where it will tho' it was in the very Church and so will all the Gentlemen's Servants in this County  Say you so Sir  says Sir Edward  then I perceive there's a Combination among you is there to abuse this Gentleman I assure you Sir he is a Match for you all and he may chance to bring some of you to the Gallows if you go on  Thomas  replies  He a Match for us all  I wish I had been in  Edward  's Place I wou'd have let him see that Servants are not Dogs nor to be murther'd every Time a Master pleases to be in a Passion for Nothing  Yes I suppose  says Sir Edward  you wou'd have used me as that Villain offer'd to use his Master wou'd you I assure you Sir if you had offer'd it or threat'ned it  as he did  I wou'd not have given you the Favour of a Bastinado I wou'd have shot you thro' the Head or the best Dog of you that ever wore a Livery  Then I think 'tis Time any Man shou'd quit such a Master if you should tell Servants so beforehand Sir  says Thomas impudently  nobody will take your Livery Well that is not the Question with you Sir  says Sir Edward  but since you have not only abus'd a Gentleman who you know is your Master's Friend and given him impudent Language but threaten to do the like and acknowledge a Combination among you and other Gentleman's Servants to be saucy to this Gentleman hereafter I must enquire farther into it this is a dangerous Business Servants are come to a heigth I find that in a little Time they will tell their Masters what they shall or shall not say to them I'll have none of the Society in my Service I assure you  Well Sir  says Thomas  I am ready to quit your Service then for I will be at Liberty to speak my Mind to  Esq  C  I said Nothing of you Sir that are my Master and as for him I value him not if I must give an Account to you Sir I shall fetch you my Livery Sir I hope I do you no Injury Sir in leaving your Service  No no  not at all  Thomas says Sir Edward calmly  bring your Cloaths and give them the Steward and take your Wages 'tis Time to be rid of such Servants  Away went  Thomas  hot and fiery and saucy enough even to his Master too as you may see I say away he went to fetch his Livery in the mean time  Sir Edward  sent not a Servant for they seem'd to be all in the Quarrel so that he would not trust them but one of his Sons to fetch the  Constable and order'd him not to meddle with  Thomas  'till they were quite parted 'till he had his Wages and left his Livery and every thing and that then he should take him just as he was without the Door going away and bring him in again and for this he gave him his Warrant as a Justice of the Peace  When the Fellow had brought down his Livery and deliver'd up his Charge as Coachman to the Steward the Steward came in to let  Sir Edward  know it and ask'd if he should pay him his Wages and dismiss him or whether he would see him again  Sir Edward said  No no prithee don't let me be troubled any more with his Sauciness I shall but be provok'd perhaps to use him as he deserves In the meantime it was easy for  Sir Edward  to see that even the Steward himself seem'd to be of  Thomas  's side and think he had hard Measure to be questioned for affronting such a Man as  Esq  C  However  Sir Edward  who had all his Measures ready and his Son with the Constable attending without the outer Gate waited to see the Issue and  Thomas  was dismiss'd when he had his Wages and all was over  Thomas  wanted to see his Master no  says the Steward  my Master says he has nothing to say any more to you and won't be disturb'd at this he began to be very rude and loud and he would see  Sir Edward  he was not his Master now he said but he wanted to speak with him and other Servants seeing him rude desired him to be easy and go about his Business but he would not stir and swore and hector'd that he would speak with  Sir Edward  he did not then call him his Master but  Sir Edward  that he had Business with him and would speak with him the Steward said  Sir Edward  was busy and would not be disturb'd well it would not do a great while he told the Steward he answered for  Sir Edward  without his Order if he would go to  Sir Edward  and tell him he desired to speak with him and he refused him then he knew what he had to do but he would not take an Answer from him  Why  says the Steward  if I do perhaps you will not take the Answer from me then any more than you will now yes he said if he came back and told him upon his Word what Answer  Sir Edward  gave he would be satisfied so the Steward went in to his Master and  Sir Edward  who had heard all that pass'd stood at the Door of his Parlour and calling aloud but calmly to his Steward that  Thomas  might hear bade him tell  Thomas  that if he would be quiet and not be saucy he would speak with him again in an Hour and so he might come again in that Time so  Thomas  went away  As soon as he was out of the outer Gate the Constable meets him and takes him up telling him it was on the Complaint of  Esq  C  and that he must go in again the Steward who was not parted from him and was secretly his Friend but angry that he had been so rude to his own Master said to him You need not have been in such Haste I see to speak with my Master I find you are like to see him sooner than he propos'd to you  Thomas  gave him little Answer but the Constable shewing his Warrant ask'd for  Sir Edward  and they were order'd to come in  When they were call'd in the Constable who had been furnish'd with the Information sworn to by  Esq  C  's Man and with the Account given by  Esq  C  in Writing presented them both to  Sir Edward  as Justice of the Peace and told him there was  Esq  C  's Servant at the Door to justify all he had said So  Sir Edward  and his late Servant after reading the Paper had the following short Dialogue  Sir Edward  Well  Thomas  I find I am to be troubled with you again sooner than I intended you hear what Mr  C  's Servant has depos'd what do you say to it  Thomas  Say to it Sir what wou'd you have me say to it  Sir  the Fellow is a Rascal and a Villain to come with such a Story here and his Master I think is little  better all the Country knows the Story as well as I and there's not a Gentleman's Servant round but wou'd have said as much as I did he must expect it where ever he goes  Sir Edw  Thou art very hot  Thomas  and a little impudent to me too to answer in this Manner I have nothing to do with the rest but my Business is with you at present and you had best not be so saucy I advise you to it  Tho  I was born saucy  Sir  I can't help it  Sir Edw  I have known many a Child be cur'd of Distempers they were born with and I think you might have been cur'd of it by this Time you are old enough  Tho  That may be  Sir  but I shall never be cur'd of it But that's nothing to the Case before your Worship what am I brought here for  Sir Edw  As to that  Thomas  I thought to have talk'd with you upon it indeed if you had been able to behave as become you but I must take another Course with you first I'll try if I can't cure you of being saucy first that Distemper which you say you were born with Here Constable do you secure this Fellow 'till I make his  Mittimus  I must send him to a Doctor to be cur'd  Tho  What you please Sir if you shew me the Way into a Prison Sir I'll find the Way out again I can find Bail  Sir Edw  I shall not meddle with that  Thomas  you may bring your  Habeas Corpus  if you please but I'll make you take a little Physick first  To the Constable  Here Mr  Constable  carry him to the House of Correction and bring him before me again to morrow Morning  Tho  What do you mean by that  Sir  I go to the House of Correction For what  Sir  Sir Edw  For your Want of Manners  Thomas  Tho  Why Want of Manners pray Your Worship is not my Master now  Sir Edw  No  Thomas  I do not talk of your Sauciness to me while I was your Master I cou'd have taken that better as you see I did an Hour or two ago but as I am a Magistrate and in the Commission of the Peace and bear the King's Authority I am bound to maintain it and not see a Justice of the Peace insulted by an impudent Fellow as you are when he comes before him in a Way of Justice  Tho  You can't send me to the House of Correction for any Thing I have said now  Sir Edw  If I do anything illegal I'll answer it to the Law but what I have done I will stand to Constable do you do your Duty  And then Sir  Edward  went into another Room  As he was going into the next Room some of the Servants spoke to  Thomas  to beg  Sir Edward  's Pardon you know your Master  Thomas said one of them  had always a Respect for you don't provoke him  Damn me Sir  says  Thomas  I'll ask Pardon of no Man upon Earth what have I done to ask Pardon I won't ask Pardon by and swore so loud that his Master heard him upon which  Sir Edward  return'd immediately into the Room hold Goodman  Waters says Sir Edward    meaning the Constable  I think I heard him swear Here  Thomas says he  you must pay for swearing  Tho  I'll pay Nothing not I  Sir Edw  Well well you may refuse to pay indeed but then you must sit in the Stocks  Thomas  you know that Law Go Goodman  Waters says Sir Edward  put him in the Stocks first a little  Thomas  rag'd and grumbled out a good many Oaths more but the Justice not hearing it that pass'd over and  Thomas  was carried to the Stocks  While he sat in the Stocks all the Footmen round about that were near enough came to visit him and there they sat an Alehouse being just by and Chairs brought out for them and there was a Consultation of Rogues cursing their Masters and abusing  Esq  C  calling him all the Scoundrels and Rascals that they could think of and here they treated  Thomas  and on  drank to him and another drank to him  'till  Thomas  was so drunk that when he had fulfill'd his Pennance that is to say an Hour in the Stocks he was in no Condition to walk to the House of Correction but if they would have him there they must get a Cart to carry him  The Justice who had some Spies among them and particularly some to take an Account of their swearing found there was an absolute Necessity to put a stop to this newfashion'd Behaviour of the Servants so he sends to Goodman  Waters  the Constable to leave  Thomas  well guarded in the Stocks and to come to him which he did and he gave him a Warrant to take some Assistance and bring away five Fellows whose Names he wrote down and against whom he had taken Information for swearing four of these five were Gentlemen's Servants in the Neighbourhood and the fifth a Farmer's Son one of  Sir Edward  's own Tennants in the Village The four Servants were oblig'd to pay three or four or five Shillings each for swearing and two of them who were very ungovernable  Sir Edward  order'd to be carried Home to their own Masters where one of them behav'd so impudently to his Master that he was oblig'd to send him to  Bridewell  too and he got there before  Thomas  the other had his Livery stript off his Back by his Master and he came back hallowing thro' the Town to the Place where they all were and got as drunk  as  Thomas  but some of the Neighbours kindly got him to Bed out of the Way or else he had been set in the Stocks too  All this made a great Hubbub in the Town and two or three honest Men Inhabitants of the Place came to  Sir Edward  and begg'd for  Thomas  that he might not go to the House of Correction that Night offering that they would be Security for him that he should come and beg Pardon for his Behaviour the next Morning But  Sir Edward  was positive that he should go only whereas his Order was in his  Mittimus  that he should have the Correction of the House that Night he sent a Note to the Keeper of the Prison that he should defer that Part 'till the next Day and order'd the Neighbours who had interceeded with him to come to him in the Morning  Next Morning  Thomas  was not quite so outragious as he was overnight but he would not submit to come and beg Pardon 'till he saw a fresh Order from  Sir Edward  and three Justices more intimating That he should not be corrected in the House but should be carried to the WhippingPost in the Town and should be publickly lash'd there unless he submitted himself before such a Time this and the Importunity of his Friends humbled him a little and indeed it was but a little for Matters did not end here  While this was doing and before  Thomas  had his Liberty and well it was for him that he had not his Liberty at that time I say while this was doing a Gang of about fourteen or fifteen of the Gentlemen's Servants and young Fellows in the Neighbourhood swearing to one another that they would be secret disguis'd themselves and going to Mr  C  's the Gentleman who had bastinado'd his Man  Edward  resolv'd to insult him if they could come at him The first Thing they did they met with his Parkkeeper but he a stout Fellow and as it happen'd having a long Keeper's Staff in his Hand arm'd at both Ends was aware of them Indeed the Parkkeeper seeing them disguis'd for their Faces were smear'd over with Soot and Grease some of them had great Whiskers made upon their Lips others had false Beards and the like I say he took them for  Deerstealers  come to rob his Master's Park and talking with them at a Distance would not let one of them come in with him At length one of them running in to him by main Force had collar'd him but was immediately fasten'd upon by the Keeper's Dog which made him quit the Keeper but to deliver him another came up and the Keeper to rescue his Dog knock'd him down however the rest coming in the Keeper seeing so many was forc'd to fly and call'd off his Dog who wou'd else have been kill'd  During this Skirmish the rest went up to the Gentleman's House and two of them asking for  Sam  as they call'd him which was the Servant who was with his Master when  Thomas  bullied him in the Town they told him they would speak with him so the Fellow innocently walk'd out with them when immediately they ask'd him if he had not been before the Justice and sworn to the Words that  Thomas  said and the like the Fellow said yes he did but pleaded that it was sore against his Will but that his Master carried him to  Sir Edward  and there they made him do it between them and begg'd heartily for his Life at first for he believed they intended to murther him  Well  they told him  they would make an Example of him to all Rogues that should betray any Servant to be ill us'd and upon this they dragg'd him to a Pond in the Park where they duck'd him and dragg'd him toandagain in it 'till they had almost drown'd him then took him and toss'd him in a Blanket then tying his Hands behind him and a Halter about his Neck so ty'd that he could not untie it with the long End hanging down behind upon his Back in this Plight they sent him Home and bade him tell his Master That they would serve him just in the same Manner the first Time they cou'd come at him and that there was  fifty of them had sworn to do it for the sake of his Man  Edward  They also made the Fellow swear that he would not fail to tell his Master all they said but that they need not have done for poor  Sam  told his Tale as soon as ever he came Home that his Master might not come to any Mischief  By this Time the Keeper was come Home too but first he had been raising the Parish to look for  Deerstealers  and was got ten or twelve strong having pick'd up a Warrener or two and their Servants and a Gentleman's Huntsman and several others enough to have given these Fellows their due if he had met with them But as their Goodluck guided them the Keeper watching for them among the Thickets and Cover of the Park where such People as he took them to be might be expected and their Business being not among the Deer  I say  as their  Goodluck  guided them the Keeper miss'd them and came Home just as  Sam  was come in and had told his pitiful Story  Their Master with two or three neighbouring Gentlemen with him was at Home taking a hearty Bottle as they call it all this while and knew nothing of the Matter but when the poor halfdrown'd Fellow came in the Noise was too great in the House for the Master to be long ignorant of it and immediately he caus'd the poor  Youngman to come into the Parlour and tell his Story to all the Gentlemen  No sooner had he told his Tale but the Keeper came in and told his Story also and the House was all in a  Hubbub  every one got up and the Gentleman lending his Friends FireArms and the Keeper's Men Horses they all mounted and went in Pursuit of them but it was to no Purpose for they knew well enough they should be pursued so they made all clear off by contrary Ways got Water and wash'd their Faces and dropt one by one to their Masters Houses and nobody was miss'd for they were not long about their Work and not the least News cou'd be heard of them But to return to  Thomas  Thomas  drunk and incapable of knowing any thing of what had befallen him the Night before wak'd you may suppose in the Morning in a Kind of course Lodging in the House of Correction and had soon his Friends about him  as above  who letting him know his Circumstance and how the Justice his late Master had had the Goodness to spare him the last Night at their Request and that they had been bound for him that he should ask him Pardon for the Rudeness of his Behaviour they also let him know that he was quite in the wrong to behave as he did to  Sir Edward  who had been a good Master to him and that he might stand in need enough of his Friendship  still in the other Case for that not  Esq  C  only but almost all the Gentlemen in the Country were resolv'd to enquire fully into the Affair and to go to the Bottom of it for that they found they should none of them dare to reprove a Servant or to be safe if they gave them but an ill Word and then they told him the Story of the Fellow's Management at  Esq  C  's House and assur'd him there would very soon be a Publication from all the Bench of Justices with a Reward of an Hundred Pound to any one or two of the Gang to discover the rest  Thomas  was prevail'd upon by all these Demonstrances to ask his Master  Sir Edward  Pardon for his Rudeness the Night before and the Neighbours had petitioned  Sir Edward  to accept it and so  Thomas  was ordered to be brought up by the Keeper in the Afternoon  But in the mean Time for the searching farther into the Combination of Servants which it was apparent by  Thomas  's Words was made among them there was about five or six Gentlemen more assembled at  Sir Edward  's all Justices of the Peace to take this Fellow's Examination When he was brought in he kneel'd down very submissively to  Sir Edward  to beg his Pardon for his Rudeness to him and  Sir Edward  forgave him and so the Fellow thought to have been dismiss'd But he was thunderstrook when he  was told by one of the other Justices in a solemn Manner  'That tho' his Master  Sir Edward  had been so good as to forgive him for what he had done to offend him and that Part was over yet that they were assembled there to enquire into his abusive Carriage to such a Gentleman naming the Person and the rather because he had intimated a Conspiracy or Combination of the other Servants in the Country about to join in their insulting that Gentleman and had personaliy threatned him in his Discourse as the Gentleman was riding thro' the Town and they said they must know the Meaning of these things before they quitted him and the rather because this Combination had appeared to be real by what had happen'd since  At which they repeated what had happen'd the Night before at  Esq  C  's House and told him  'He would do well to make a timely Discovery of the Thing if he knew any thing of it otherwise they must take such a Course with him as should be judg'd proper as well to detect the Confederacy it self as to punish him for his misusing a Gentleman who had offer'd him no Injury and was peaceably going along the King's Highway'  Thomas  was a bold Fellow and withal very full of Tongue spoke much but pretty well too only very apt to be fancy had liv'd with several Persons of Quality and  been Coachman to a Duke or two and valued himself very much upon it So when he began his Tale he told them  'That he had liv'd with such and such Lords and Dukes and that he had driven a Coach and Six so many Years and that he had never been us'd thus by any Master in his Life That he was but a poor Fellow 'twas true and they took Advantage of his being heated with talking of that Gentleman  c  Here the Justice that spoke before interrupted him and told him  'This was all nothing to the Purpose if he had serv'd such noble Persons as he said he ought to have learnt better Manners in their Service that every Gentleman that pays a Servant Wages has a Right not to the Service only but the Respect due from such Servant to him that employs him but that however as to his Sauciness to his Master that was not the Question but he was sent to Prison for his Rudeness to  Sir Edward  not as his Master for he was not then his Master but as a Magistrate but even as a Magistrate upon his Submission he was forgiven which he ought to be very thankful for but he was question'd then upon the Information of  Esq    C  confirm'd upon Oath by his Servant for insulting him on the Highway and threat'ning him not personally only but also with a Combination  of other Fellows against him which had in part appear'd to be a Reality by what had happen'd as above  Thomas  made a long Harangue again upon his having serv'd so many Gentlemen  c  as above but was bid let that alone as nothing to the purpose and speak to the Point  he said  he knew not what Point they meant  they answer'd  his insulting Mr  C c He said  he did not understand how that lay before them that what he had said of Mr  C  was true that he had abus'd an honest Fellow that was his Servant in such a manner that he thought no Servant cou'd owe him any Respect and that all Servants were so far concern'd in that Usage as that they cou'd not help telling him of it whereever they met with him and that he might thank himself for that Servants were not hir'd to be us'd like Dogs or to be murther'd upon every time their Master was pleas'd to be mad and what he had said  he believ'd  was no more than he ought to have said and he shou'd not be afraid to say it again and thus he run on a little like what he had said in Mr  C  's hearing only with a little more Respect  and added  that it was true that he said he wish'd he had been in  Edward's  Place he shou'd not have serv'd him so and he hop'd he might say so again  Why what wou'd you have done  says one of the Justices  Why Sir  says he  before  I wou'd have been beaten so like a Dog I wou'd have defended myself Ay  says one of the Justices  and have murther'd your Master it may be if you cou'd  I wou'd have kill'd any Man in the World  says he  rather than he shou'd have kill'd me the poor Fellow is not murther'd indeed that is he is not dead yet but he may be soon he was beaten so unmercifully that he is in the Surgeon's Hands and nobody knows whether he will live or die I think 'tis time poor Servants shou'd speak when 'tis come to this  Well  Thomas  and what was all this for pray  says the Justice  was there no Provocation given No  says Thomas  none that requir'd such Usage he happen'd to override one of the Hounds in their Sport and that was not with Design neither the Fellow lov'd the Dogs as well as his Master did and wou'd not have done it if he cou'd have help'd it  Well  Thomas  and you think this was the Occasion of it all do you  says the Justice  Think so Sir  says Thomas  I know it for I had it from his own Mouth  Pray  Sir Edward says one of the Justices  be pleas'd to let the whole Case be read at large not for  Thomas  's Satisfaction for he does not deserve it but for the Satisfaction of all the People here for I see half the Town are come about us to hear the Cause and they are all it seems impos'd upon as  well as he So  Sir Edward  caus'd one of his Clerks to read the Account that  Esq  C  had given under his Hand of the whole Combat at large in the manner I have given it you above  At the reading this Story there was a general Murmur among the People in the Hall where they stood to hear the Cause one said he was a Rogue another a Villain another said he had not half his Reward that is to say meaning  Edward  some said they never heard such a Story in their Lives others said he deserv'd to be hang'd and in short everybody said the Story was told quite another way all over the Town and that they had been abus'd in the Relation of it  But  Thomas  cry'd out it was all false not a Word of it true  The Justices bid him have a care what he said for this was the Account the Gentleman gave himself and that he was ready to make Oath of it however  they told him  that as he had boasted that if he was sent to Prison he knew the Way out again and that he cou'd get Bail  they told him  they thought the least thing they cou'd do was to bind him over to the next QuarterSessions and in the mean time to require Sureties of him for his good Behaviour and so they left him with the Keeper to detain him 'till all this was done  It was near a Week before  Thomas  cou'd get Security but at last he did and got his Liberty but as soon as the Story came abroad and how it had really been all People cry'd shame of the Footmen and the first thing to be heard of in order to a further Discovery of Things was that about eight Footmen in several Gentlemen's Families were run away any one might conclude they were thoroughly frighted with  Thomas  's Story besides when it was known that so many were gone it was easy to know what they were guilty of As for  Thomas  his Fate is not determin'd yet  There is a great deal more in the History of this Affair but it is not significant enough to trouble you with you will see thro' ev'ry Part of what I have written an Air of uncommon Insolence upon the Conduct of Servants all the Country round and that is the Reason of my giving you this Account Before I dismiss this Subject I must observe to you That this insolent Behaviour is not among the false and thievish Servants such we may always expect to be impudent but this is the Conduct of the honest Part of Servants at least those we call honest I cou'd give you an Account of Servants robbing ay and murthering their Masters and those now more than ever but among such nothing is to be wonder'd at and such are in all Nations as well as here but I confine my self to the Point in hand namely  the insolent unsufferable Conduct of Servants that is to say of those that call themselves honest and value themselves upon being so  Nor is it every Servant that will fight his Master as  Edward  did because it is not every Servant that dares do it but I must also add that there is not one Servant in twenty now that will take a Blow from a Master but with their Tongues will insult them at that rate that it is very hard for any Gentleman to bear it nor do I wonder at any thing more than that there are not ten Servants for one kill'd by their Masters the Treatment which Masters receive from them being now such as indeed 'tis very hard for any Temper to submit to I shall give you some Instances of this Kind in my next Letter  LETTER VII  Dear Brother  _MY Last gave you a kind of TragiComedy between a Friend of mine and his Man  Edward  I shall fill up my Account with some of every kind that offers  I must acknowledge to you that it is not the easiest thing in the World for a Gentleman to bear the sawcy Language of a Servant on any Account whatever and there are some Actions of Servants that a Master cannot but resent and reprove them for when they upon these just Reproofs return impudent ungrateful Language and insulting Behaviour as is the very Case I am upon It is not every Temper that in such provoking Cases can restrain it self and this has been the Occasion of sending many a Servant to the Devil before their Time and as killing a Servant is not in  England  so light a matter as it is in  France  especially killing a Servant in a Passion or in drink so some Gentlemen who have had the Misfortune to push their Resentments a little farther than they ought have been put to great Distresses and some have been quite ruin'd on that Account  and this brings to my Mind a Story which also happen'd within the Reach of my own Knowledge  There happen'd in a Country Town within about Eleven Miles of  London  a very odd Passage of a Servant and a Master which ended more tragical than that in my Last The Gentleman was a Colonel in the  Militia  and of a very good Estate and had only two Daughters his eldest Daughter a fine beautiful Lady and very well bred was said to be in Love with somebody but it cou'd never be found out who it was with She was so unsuspected by her Father as to her Vertue that there was no need to keep any Watch over her She often took the Coach or the Chariot with her Sister to go to  London  or any where else and sometimes without her but always came home in good time and if her Father ask'd her at any time where she had been been she wou'd say she only took a turn out upon the Forrest or upon such a Heath or such a Way for the Air which was an Answer satisfying enough and sometimes without the least Suspicion in his Head he wou'd ask the Coachman which Way he drove or how far And he wou'd give him the like Answer  This pass'd for a great while 'till it was observ'd at last that she took the Chariot out for airing without her Sister or anybody else with her oftner than usual and her Father  who had heard a Rumour that his Daughter had an Amour with somebody began to suspect upon this Suspicion one Evening he examin'd the Coachman in a friendly obliging manner whether anybody met his Daughter upon those Airings and Ridings out The Fellow with a sawcy Fleer at him said  No  and laugh'd this mov'd him a little and he call'd him sawcy Fellow or something to that purpose Why Sir do you think  says the Coachman  that if my young Mistress had any LoveIntrigue with anybody and trusted me to carry her I wou'd betray her and tell you of it  Very well Sir  says the Colonel  then you may say you will be faithful to my Daughter but you cou'd not boast of much Honesty to your Master 'tis no matter for that Sir  says be  I never betray my Trust yes Sir  says the Colonel  you do in that very thing for as you are my Servant when you carry her abroad 'tis I trust my Daughter in your Hands I think nothing of that  says the Fellow  'tis the Lady trusts me with herself and that's more than you trust me with  Well well if that be your Principle  says the Colonel  then I shall trust you no more with her and you shall carry her out no more However it happen'd that about a Week after or thereabout the young Lady call'd her Coachman her Father being from home and rode out as usual the Colonel coming  home while they were abroad and hearing of it never lighted off his Horse but rode about to see if he cou'd meet her any where and discover any thing  It was his Misfortune to ride round and round the Country a great way but not to meet with them but being just come back so near as that he was within sight of his own Door  if it had been Daylight  he heard the Coach stop just before him upon this he stop'd and got off of his Horse and hanging his Bridle to another Door stept forward on the other side it being very dark believing he shou'd see some Spark or other come home with his Daughter to bring her to the Door and he was the more confirm'd in his Expectation when he saw the Coach stop a little short of the Door  But judge what Rage what Horror must take hold of his Soul when he saw the Coachman after opening the CoachDoor to his Daughter take her out of the Coach in his Arms and holding her in his Arms a good while kiss her several times and she on the otherhand throwing one of her Arms about his Neck give him leave to do it as long as he wou'd  Blame not the Gentleman if he had not Patience enough to restrain his Passion at this killing Sight but he run in upon them  Unhand her Villain  said he to the Coachman  or I'll this Minute send you to the Devil  The Fellow surpriz'd you may  suppose set her down but gave his Master the most impudent Language imaginable and which the Gentleman not able to take gave him a large Cut over the Face with his Sword I'll mark thee now  says he  for a Dog that I may know thee again to morrow  The Fellow cry'd Murther at first but immediately flying back gave his Master two or three Lashes with his Whip and was coming at him in a Rage with the thick End of it when the frighted Lady having rung the Bell other Servants came and open'd the Door and the Master stept in which put an End to the Fray for that time  Then the Gentleman came to the Door again and pull'd in his Daughter  Come Mistress  says he  Come you in I'll take care of you whatever I do with him  The Lady was terribly frighted to be sure however the Fellow drove the Coach round into the StableYard and having put up the Horses sent one of the Servants in to tell his Master he desir'd he might send for a Surgeon his Master sent Word he might go to a Surgeon's if he wou'd for he shou'd sleep no more in his House He sent Word again very sawcily he wou'd not stir in that Condition and at that time of Night but that in the Morning he wou'd let him know more of his Mind  However the Gentleman was perswaded to let him stay that Night his LodgingRoom being over the CoachHouse and so not within the DwellingHouse and locking up his Daughter in her Chamber he sat up himself to see that no Mischief might happen In the dead of the Night he heard some Noise in the Yard and putting himself in a Posture to hear as much as he cou'd of it and not to be discover'd he heard his Daughter calling out at a little Window to the Coachman to ask him how he did and telling him she wou'd find some way or other to come out the next Day to him for all this with some other little Tendernesses between them which however serv'd to inform him how Things were He restrain'd his Passion and did not discover himself at all but took care of her ChamberDoor and that she shou'd not get out of the Window  The next Morning he call'd his Coachman to him paid him his Wages and dismiss'd him The Coachman said nothing to him but look'd and behav'd surlily 'till he was paid and was going away as he thought when he turn'd short upon him and told him saucily He hop'd he wou'd give him some Satisfaction for cutting him on the Face  his Master answer'd  He ought to be thankful to him he had not cut his Throat  For what  says the Coachman  For your Impudence  says the Master  The Coachman said something very rude upon that about his Daughter intimating that tho' he was but a poor Servant now yet he was a Gentleman born and of as good a Family as he meaning his Master and 'twas no Dishonour to his Daughter to engage with him for Sir  says he  I have as good Blood in my Veins as yourself with some other Language which the Colonel cou'd not bear upon which he took his Sword in his Hand which lay on the Table and opening the Door said with a little Smile Then Sir if you don't immediatly get out of my House I'll let some of your Gentlemanly Blood out for you and that presently too  Sir  says the Coachman  I am none of your Servant  now  but as good a Man as your self This provok'd the Colonel farther and he rose up tho' in his Gown and Slippers and thrust the Villain out of his Door and kick'd him down the Steps  When the Fellow was out he fac'd him again Sir  says he  go tell your Daughter you owe your Life to Her and were it not for her sake I'd trample you under my Feet this Moment  The Colonel was not a Match for the Brute perhaps at his Fist tho' in Courage infinitely superior but flies into his Parlour for his Sword and comes instantly out  to him again but he was gone a little way from the Door he call'd after him  but he answer'd  he wou'd go but a little way farther and wait on him again  by and by  About two Hours after the Fellow comes again dress'd up very genteely and a Sword by his side and two Fellows with him  When his Master saw them he call'd one of his Servants and bade him go to the Stable and fetch him two Pitchforks  for  says he  I'll deal with this Dog in his own way  accordingly the Servant brought them and he bade him and his FellowServant keep in the next Room with them and not shew themselves unless he call'd them  When this was done he bade a MaidServant go and desire the two Men that were with the Coachman to walk in and bid the Coachman stay without  When they were come in he treated them very courteously and ask'd them  if they had any particular Business with him  They answer'd very civily too that their Business was only this that  William  his Coachman had desir'd them to come with him that he had been wounded by him the Evening before in his Passion and that he was afraid he might be in Danger again and that he desir'd them to come with him to prevent any Mischief  Pray Gentlemen  says the Colonel  did he acquaint you with the Reason of my being so provok'd They answer'd  No only that he had said it was without any Provocation at all  It's the only obliging thing  says the Colonel  that  William  cou'd do but depend upon it Gentlemen I cou'd never be guilty of using a Servant so hardly as cutting him over the Face if I had not had the greatest Provocation in the World  As to that  they said  they knew nothing of it and if they had they wou'd not have appear'd in it for they wou'd not countenance any Servant in abusing his Master  Well but Pray Gentlemen  says he  what need is there to bring you to guard him now he is out of my Service and has no Business with me If he does not come in my Reach I can do him no Hurt and my best Advice to him is to keep out of my way  But Sir  says one of the Men  he says his Business now was to see what Satisfaction you will give him for wounding him  Says the Colonel  my Answer to that is plain what the Law will give him I'll submit to I shall give him no more Satisfaction I suppose he does not come to to challenge me if he thinks he has not merited much more than I gave him I leave him to take any Course he pleases Pray  what Satisfaction does he demand  says the Colonel  have you any thing to offer in his Name I am ready to answer as becomes me in any Case  says he  and if he had been a Gentleman and indeed any thing but my own Servant I knew what Answer to make  NB  Here the Colonel began to imagine a  Challenge  but they had not any Instructions  they said  not foreseeing they shou'd speak with him first or alone  Well then Gentlemen  says he  tell him from me I have no Business with him and I think he has none with me if he keeps away from my House he has nothing to fear from me and so  needs no Guard  and with this he dismiss'd them  When they were gone he perceiv'd that when they came to the Door where the Coachman waited and gave an Account to him of the Discourse they had with his Master he appear'd  very uneasie  that he came from them twice in a Kind of a Passion towards the Door but that they call'd him back again But however he came on the third time and the Colonel observ'd that when he came from them  the third time  they shook their Heads and went away as if they had said  If you will go we will have nothing to do with you  However he came to the Gate and knock'd or rung very hard the Colonel who had seen him order'd his Servants not to open  the Gate but let him knock or ring awhile at length He order'd one of his Men to go out at the Backdoor and come round and stand in a Place in the Yard which was on one side of the House where he might speak to him out at Window and where the Fellow at the Gate might see him too  When the Servant was come to the Place his Master call'd to him aloud  John  what does  that Fellow  want that rings at the Gate there  John answer'd  'tis  William  Sir  Well  says his Master  I know that what wou'd he have  The Coachman answer'd  I wou'd speak with you Sir  The Colonel answer'd nothing to him upon which  John  the Servant said  He says he wou'd speak with you Sir  Tell him  says his Master  I have nothing to say to him bid him go about his Business  Well  William  wou'd not stir but call'd to his Master aloud  Tho' you have nothing to say to me you may bear what I have to say to you I tell thee FELLOW  says the Colonel  I have no Business with thee and will have none with thee  Then he desir'd he might be admitted to speak with his Daughter that he rejected with Indignation and in some harsh Terms Why  says William  I desire but to speak with her at the Window and in your Hearing I am not asham'd you shou'd hear what I have to say to her  But she ought to be asham'd to speak to you  says the Colonel  or hear you speak to her and much more that I shou'd hear it Besides I have remov'd her out of your Reach so you may go about your Business  Remove her where you will  says William  I will speak with her do your worst and have her too if you ha'n't murther'd her  How it came to pass that the Daughter got so much Liberty he cou'd not tell but in the middle of all this Discourse she got to a Window on the Side of the House and call'd aloud to  William  and giving the Lye to her Father  as it were  told him she was not remov'd nor wou'd not be remov'd but she wou'd find a Way quickly to come out  or to that Effect  and  William  answer'd her in such Terms as made her Father fear they were married  This was very provoking to her Father you may be sure to have his Daughter give him the  LYE  in that manner as she did and extorted some rash Words from him to the Fellow and he as much inflam'd return'd him very scurrilous Language in so many Words and bade him  Come out into the Yard if he was not afraid to shew his Face to an honest Man  The Colonel a Man of Spirit ran to his Closet took a Fusee in his Hand that was loaded with a Brace of Bullets which he always kept so loaded in case of Thieves and boldly open'd the Door but the Fellow  who was without the Gate seeing the Gun in his Hand upbraided him with Cowardice in bringing out FireArms to a naked Man but moving off desir'd him to have Patience and he wou'd wait upon him again in a Condition fit to talk with him notwithstanding his Gun so in a Quarter of an Hour he return'd with a Fusee in his Hand also  But by this time the Neighbours alarm'd by some of the Colonel's Servants interpos'd and the Fray was ended for that time without Mischeif It is not material to the present Purpose how the Gentleman and his Daughter manag'd he wou'd have sent her into the Country but the Girl wou'd not go he knew not well where to put her but that if she had a Mind to be miserable and take the Fellow she might find Means to do it so he thought it fafest to keep her in his own House where he thought his Anthority might prevent her Designs and his Reasoning might in time prevail with her to alter her Mind  But about five Days after the Fellow having found Means by flashing of Gun Powder and other Tokens agreed between them to let her know that he was ready and she having found Means to give him notice of her Resolution she let herself down from the third Story in the Night and he with two more stood ready to carry her off at the Bottom  She was safe at the Bottom and had just set her Foot upon the Ground when the Colonel hearing or suspecting some Noise started up run to the Window with his Gun in his Hand and having just Light enough to see his Daughter putting herself into the Arms of his Coachman shot him dead upon the Spot  The Lady frighted almost to Death fell flat upon the Ground and the Father believing he had kill'd his own Daughter was for awhile in a dreadful Agony and run out to bring her in but was better satisfied when he found she was only frighted It cost the poor Gentleman a greatdeal of Trouble and Affliction afterwards and in a manner ruin'd the Family for the Laws here are very nice in such Cases where there appear'd a former Quarrel But all this had its Beginning in the Insolence of the Servant and so far is to the purpose I am writing about the rest of the Story being too long to trouble you with now  NB  You may note that on the Tryal it was effectually prov'd  That at one aClock in the Morning or thereabouts three Men were seen in his Yard  That he saw them carrying off his Daughter  which was necessarily construed to be a Robbery  But suppose not it was allow'd to be an unseasonable Time of Night and that the Gentleman not going out of his House had a Right to defend his House which he had Reason to believe was in Danger to be robb'd  That he call'd out several times  Who's there  but was answer'd by one of them not the Coachman  Nobody  at which he gave notice that he wou'd fire and bade them stand off at their Peril  All which Particulars were it seems effectually prov'd in his Favour  However it was very unhappy to the Father and afflicted him all his Days to the last Degree for the Blood of a Man tho' a Villain in what he did is very grievous to a Mind sensible of the World and of the Nature of killing a FellowCreature however faulty  This Story I tell you in Confirmation of what I have said namely That the Provocations given by Servants in this Country are such that 'tis next to impossible that any Gentleman shou'd bear them and were it so in  France  I believe you will be of my Opinion that there wou'd be Footmen in a Year sent into another World by their Masters own Hands and I must add my Opinion too in the other Part  namely  That it is because Masters in  France  will not bear  such Usage from their Servants that Servants in  France  behave after another manner  I remember when the Insolence of Servants in  France  caus'd that happy Edict of our late Great Monarch That no Servants that is to say no Footmen or as we call 'em Valets shou'd wear Swords But even this was occasion'd by their Rudeness to other People and sometimes to one another but it was scarce ever heard in  France  that a Footman behav'd otherwise to his Master than with the most profound Submission or that if they did they always met with the severest Correction  The very Name of  Footman  intimates That they are bred at the Foot of their Master their Business is to clean his Shoes and to be always ready at his Foot that is to say for the most servile Employment their Post is to go or ride behind and they ought not to come into the Master's Presence but with Hat in Hand bareheaded and with all the Tokens of an entire Submission This ever was the Usage and is still in our Country and ought to be in every Country But I can assure you the Case is quite alter'd in  England  and tho' the Carriage of a Footman is seemingly submissive their real Behaviour is quite another thing than it was  They are now drunken sawcy unmannerly negligent not only above Correction but even above Reproof I shall tell you  afterwards what causes it I am now upon the Fact and letting you know that it really is so  A Gentleman of my particular Acquaintance having Occasion to be in  Scotland  thought it a good Place to get a Servant in his  English  Servant that he carried down with him was not able  as he said  to live as Servants liv'd in  Scotland  and so he desir'd to be dismiss'd which was granted he had after that a Fellow recommended to him that had a great Desire to serve an  English  Gentleman for he had heard much what good Masters they were and how well they us'd their Setvants upon this the Gentleman sent for him  The Fellow seem'd to have the Face of a good Servant far from being unacquainted with the lowest Submission and when they talk'd of going to  England  he told my Friend That if his Honour pleas'd to carry him to  England  he wou'd run at his Horse Foot all the Way for he shou'd not need to buy a Horse for him Now my Friend thought indeed that he had been fitted he had Occasion to travel some short Journeys while he remain'd there being employ'd in publick Business and his new Man was the most tendible Servant that ever Gentleman cou'd desire  The Master generous like an  English  Gentleman and kind cou'd not bear to see the poor Fellow run on Foot up Hill and  downHill over the Mountains thro' the Rivers in the coldest Weather as well as in the hottest while his other Servants had Horses always to ride on so without his Man's Sollicitation he furnish'd himself with another Horse for his new Valet and mighty thankful the Fellow was  The Gentlemen among whom my Friend convers'd and to whom  Harry  that was his Name was frequently sent of Errands and on Business of great Consequence shew'd their Respect for his Master by being very bountiful to his Servant so that  Harry  began to feel Money ring in his Pocket which had never been his Case before  The first Consequence of this was that  Harry  threw away his Bonnet which was all the Covering his Brains had ever known in  Aberdeenshire  from thence he came and bought himself a good Castor  English  Hat  His Master had promis'd him his Livery when he came to  England  but was not willing to have it made there for many Reasons but having Occasion to stay some Months longer in  Scotland  than he expected  Harry  found Ways and Means by the same Bounty of the  Scots  Gentlemen to buy an old or secondhand black Coat which his Master being at that Time in Mourning was suitable enough and  Harry  began to call himself his Master's Gentleman  It was not long before his Master had Occasion to send  Harry  from  Edinburgh  to  Queen'sFerry  upon Business of Consequence and his Horses and other Servants being gone to  Glasgow  on some other Occasion  Harry  was oblig'd to go on Foot at which he shew'd a visible Reluctance at length when his Master told him it must be so he said  loud enough to be heard  it was a little overfar to gang on his Foot  Well his Master took no Notice of it at that time but  Harry  went the long Journey and came back the same Day but at Night when his Master wanted  Harry  for some Business I know not what truly he was gone to his Bed and the next Morning his Master had two or three little Rubbs of his great Weariness upon which a Day or two after he call'd his Man  Harry  and with good Humour in his Face ask'd him if his Weariness was over  Harry  said Yes but that indeed it was a hard Journey Why  Harry said his Master  did not you offer to run at my HorseFoot to  England  when I hir'd you  Harry  wou'd sain have forgot that he had said so but his Master reminded him of the Particulars in so plain a manner that he cou'd not deny it but he came off with saying He was always willing to serve his Honour  so all Servants call their Masters there  but he found he was willinger than able  No no  Harry said his Master  not less able but a little less humble I doubt than you  were you and I must talk about that  Harry  pray get you another Master Yes Sir  says Harry without any Hesitation  and away he went  However  Harry  bethought himself and made Friends to be continued in his Service and that he might go to  England  for that was all he desir'd it seems when he came first upon this Submission  Harry  was receiv'd again into Favour and came to  England  with his Master when he had been in  England  a little while he grew like the  English  Servants sawcy and proud but with this Addition to it that he did not like the Wages his Master gave him but he understood that other Servants in  England  got more Wages than he did and he wanted more Wages Well his Master being willing to have kept the Fellow consented to give him  s  a Year more Wages than he had agreed with him for before  It happen'd that  Harry  did something wrong that his Master had set him about and it being something of Business which being wrong done was some Disappointment to his Master he was a little angry and took  Harry  up short but gave him not one hard Name or any thing of that Kind  Harry  told him impudently He did not understand such Language that he had not been us'd to be so talk'd to in that manner and a great many Words he made of it  Some time after  Harry  took Occasion to let fall some insolent Words among the Servants as that he wou'd not be talk'd to by any Master in  Britain  that his Relations were Men of honourable Families and he was a Gentleman tho' he serv'd his Master soandso  His Master heard of this but took no notice of it but some time after  Harry  had done another Fault and it was a Fault that indeed in a Servant is intollerable that when some Gentlemen had been to speak with his Master who was abroad and had left Word with  Harry  that they had been there and told their Names  Harry  took no care to let his Master know any thing of it  When his Master came to hear of it he was very much provok'd as indeed he had Reason and calling up his Man he examin'd him if such Gentlemen had not been there at such a time  Harry  own'd they had been there and left their Names too Well  says his Master  and what was the Reason that you did not give me an Account of it when I came home  Harry  answer'd first that he thought he had told him  His Master alledg'd  That cou'd not be for then he shou'd not have forgot to own it to the Gentlemen that Business being of Consequence to himself Then  Harry  wou'd have said he forgot it this made his Master doubly angry Why then did you not  says his Master  set it down in  the Book It seems his Master had given him a MinuteBook and Pen and Ink on purpose to set down such Business as might happen in his Absence  Truly  Harry  being driven to the Necessity of owning a Fault which if he had done there had been an End of it grew sawcy and after grumbling and muttering to himself awhile and his Master asking what he said  he told him in so many Words  that truly he did not give himself much Trouble to remember such Things  What do you mean by that Sir  say his Master  Is it not my Business Are you a Servant or are you not  Harry replied  tho' he was a Servant he was not to be talk'd in that manner to as he had been and he shou'd not trouble himself with Men's Business that us'd him so  Blame him not if the Gentleman was in some Passion at this but he turn'd short upon him with a Smile What  Harry  do you bear Malice 'Tis above a Month since I spoke to your Worship in the manner you talk of and I am sure you deserv'd it and if any had Occasion to remember it I shou'd for you were impudent enough and do you pretend to bear it in Mind now  Yes  he said  he did and he wou'd never forgive any Man that shou'd talk to him in that manner  Why then  says his Master  I am sorry I had not can'd you then and kick'd you out of Doors for a Rascal as you deserv'd then  you had had something to remember and bear Malice for  Harry  had not much to say then but still kept grumbling at length says his Master It seems I had disoblig'd you before  Harry  and so you neglected my Business now on purpose to be even with me was that the Case Indeed  says Harry  something of that Kind for I do not understand such Treatment as this With that his Master had indeed no more Patience but flew at him and giving him a good Kick on the Backside took up his Cane to have broke his Head being provok'd at his Ingratitude  You ungrateful Dog  says he did I take you to run at my Horse Foot and can you talk thus to me and with that I say flew to his Cane  But  Harry  was as nimble as he and tho' he was as sawcy as  Edward  yet he had not  Edward  's Courage but fled out of Doors and walk'd off for that Night and staid two or three Days 'till he thought his Master's Passion was over and then he came again and sent in another of the Servants to tell his Master he was come to ask his Pardon  His Master was easy enough to forgive him but order'd his Clerk to pay him his Wages and dismiss him which was done but there was another thing still at the End of  Harry  's Submission and that was he did not design coming back to his Duty and  Service for the Time was not up that he was hir'd for but he was told by his Countrymen that he might have more Wages and he studied to disoblige his Master that he might be turn'd off but still he wanted a Certificate this is what we call in  France  a Testimonial of Fidelity and good Behaviour  His Master told him  Ay he wou'd give him a Certificate such as he deserv'd Why Sir  says Harry in his Country Tone  Have I not been honest and just Yes  says his Master  but thou hast been sawcy and impudent too Well but Sir  says Harry  and you'll certify to my Honesty you have forgiven me the rest please to certify the first Part  Nay  says his Master  tho' I have forgigiven your Behaviour  Harry  I cannot certify that you did not misbehave E'en certify what you like Sir  says Harry  and was very humble for  Harry  found that he cou'd not get a Place without a Certificate and his Master perceiv'd it and was willing to humble him so he wrote a Certificate thus  I do hereby certify That  Harry D  the Bearer serv'd me three Quarters of a Year having been hir'd for a Year that he was honest in what Matters of Trust I committed to him but dismiss'd by me for his insolent Behaviour  and sawcy Language Witness my Hand the th Day of  August    Harry  heard the Contents of this with a staring Countenance and an inexpressible Surprize for his Master read it to him and when he had done only said  Is that the Certificate you will please to give me  And without waiting for an Answer turn'd his Back and went off However  Harry  like a true Villain that cou'd fawn 'till his Purpose was serv'd and be impudent again when it was serv'd I say  Harry  made Friends to the Gentleman's Lady and she interceeded for him to his Master and considering it might be the poor Fellow's Ruin at last he gave him a Certificate  It was some time after this that  Harry  being dress'd mighty fine comes to the Gentleman's House and his Master being not at home sent in his Name to his Lady The Lady was somehow or other engag'd but bade one of the Servants tell him his Master was not at home she cou'd not imagine indeed the Gentleman had any Business with her unless it had been to thank her for her Intercession but she order'd the Servants to have him into the Kitchin and make him eat and drink so he went away but about three or four Days after sends a sawcy impudent Letter to the Lady herself full of foolish but rude Language because she was pleas'd to order her Servants  to entertain him but did not wait upon him herself  The same Gentleman I mention'd above had the Exercise of several such Servants as these and some worse one of the principal Reasons that I can assign for it was that if the general Character of the Gentleman was just he was only the kindest and most considering Master imaginable to his Servants always compassionate of them easy with them doing good to them making their Lives easy and their Service pleasant  But I must now give you an Example where this Evil has prov'd tragical both to Master and Servant for as I hinted before that the Provocations given by Servants are unsufferable and that it is not always easy for Gentlemen to govern their Passions in such Cases so you may reasonably suppose that all Gentlemen have not the same Government of themselves Men are not equally patient nor equally Philosophers and some Examples may be given where this insolent Behaviour of Servants has provok'd Masters beyond their Patience  There was a Country Gentleman of a very good Estate but being a single Man so they call Men here that are not married and having no Family he liv'd privately and only kept two Servants one was a Groom the other a kind of Gentleman to him that is to say one that always attended his  Master dress'd him and travell'd with him and at other times was a kind of Steward to him did Business for him Receiv'd his Rents paid Money for him and was trusted by him to a very considerable Degree and as he had always appear'd to be very honest and his Master none of the best Managers he rather too much depended upon this Servant and seldom took any regular Account of his Behaviour but left all to him  Time and good Usage had the usual Effect upon this Servant  that is to say  that as the Custom of most Servants is in this Country that they soon get out of the Knowledge of themselves they take all the Kindness of their Masters to be not a Favour but a Debt to their extraordinary Merit this Fancy of extraordinary Merit swells them with extraordinary Pride and from that Time they neither know how to behave to FellowServants or to Masters themselves So it was here and first this Fellow began to mend his Figure get a long Wig ride with a Sword wear a Watch in his Pocket and the like In consequence of this he look'd upon himself to be above the Rank of an ordinary Servant and at length by his particular Interest with his Master obtain'd to throw off his Livery and dress as a Gentleman  From one Step to another Pride knows no Bounds first he learnt to insult over his  Fellow Servant and in a little time more began to bristle up even to his Master himself and that in Spight of innumerable Favours Benefactions and Civilities which he had receiv'd from a Gentleman who however he was warm and passionate in extraordinary Cases was yet to him the besthumour'd Gentleman living  His Master who had shew'd him by a thousand Tokens that he had an extraordinary Respect for him cou'd not yet bear to have him grow upon him and was very nice in taking notice of it did many Ways check and take him short in the Beginning of his new Behaviour and sometimes talk'd roundly to him about it but it was allone he grew the more pert and short with his Master 'till in Time the Evil growing upon him and he became downright sawcy on many Occasions  I cannot but observe here for the Caution of all Gentlemen on the like Occasions that they shou'd if possible avoid such common catchword Sayings as have any thing ominous in them upon themselves This Gentleman in reproving his Steward  as I may call him  us'd this extraordinary Expression almost upon all Occasions Prithee  Humphry  don't be sawcy I can't bear your insolent Tongue  I'll kill you  you Dog if you talk so to me I tell you  I'll kill you  this he often said in Jest after he had us'd it pretty much if he sent him for Money to his  Tennants he wou'd add jestingly Go and get me some Money  I'll kill you  you Dog if you don't bring me some Money and the like upon many other Occasions  Among the rest of this unhappy Gentletleman's Misfortunes this was one  viz  That he drank very hard and sometimes this impudent Fellow wou'd take upon him to reprove his Master for it and that not in a modest way as a cautioning him of the Mischief of it which he had good Humour enough to have taken very kindly but he wou'd laugh at him ridicule and expose his Master rather than modestly cover his Infirmity and upon his Master's being acquainted with this one time after he had been a little in Drink he calls his Man to him and upbraided him with it but he gave him sawcy Language which was the Occasion of the first Breach between them for his Master told him in few Words he did not deserve the Favours he had shewn him and so in short turn'd him off  However in a few Days the Fellow began to be sensible of his Loss and went to his Master ask'd him Pardon and was with an Abundance of good Nature receiv'd into his Place again and in as much Favour as ever  By that time he had been in Place again long enough to forget the Favour and to forget the Sense he had had of it before he became  just as sawcy and insolent as he was before  It happen'd one Night that his Master stay'd out very late and his Gentleman sitting up for him was very finely gotten fast asleep in his Master's Parlour and in his easy Chair by the Fire About four aClock in the Morning his Master rung at the Door and the Groom or Footman comes running into the Parlour to call the Steward believing he might be asleep and he was indeed so dead asleep that he cou'd not be presently wak'd so that while the Footman was waking him his Master was at his Heels and was come into the Parlour himself The Dialogue between the Groom and the Steward was very short but being much to the Purpose 'tis very needful to give you the Particulars of it  as follows  Footman  Mr  Humphry  Mr  Humphry  my Master's come  Mr Humphry  Ha what  And then  Humphry  snor'd again  Footm  Nay Mr  Humphry  wake I tell you my Master's come  Pulls him  Mr Humph  What Ha Come Who's come What  And snores again  Footm  Why my Master's come Mr  Humphry  he'll be here this Minure get up I say  Pulls him almost out of the Chair and almost wakes him  Mr Humph  O O Is he come Is the old Dog come then D him 'tis very well  indeed a fine Time of Night D him a fine Time truly I suppose the old Rogue is drunk enough pray who brought him home  All the while the Sot said this last Part his Master stood and heard every Word of it for he was come in within the ParlourDoor so when he had done his Master began O Mr  Humphry says he  what are you got drunk before me to Night And spoke it merrily enough for it happen'd to Mr  Humphry  's Misfortune that his Master was not drunk that Night or at most not so drunk as he usually was so that he had Temper enough to manage his Gentleman Mr  Humphry  pretty well for he caus'd him to give up all his Trusts and Books which he usually kept that very Night and turn'd him out of Doors the next Morning  Mr  Humphry  wou'd fain have staid next Morning and gave his Master very good Words but it wou'd not do his Master was warmer then by a great deal than he was overnight No no  Humphry says he  you and I must part I can't bear such as this  adding  I shall certainly  kill you  one time or other if you stay therefore get you gone I say or I am sure I shall  kill you  So Mr  Humphry  was oblig'd to pack up and be gone  Well notwithstanding all this abominable Treatment Mr  Humphry  upon an Acknowledgment of his Fault and the Intercession  of some Friends which he got to speak to his Master in his Favour was taken in again a third time about half a Year after and was reinstated in the same Place as before  He had upon his Application to his Master to be restor'd humbled himself very much acknowledg'd that he was in Drink and knew not what he said and asking Pardon had assur'd his Master of his future good Behaviour and for some time he was a tollerable good Servant  But there is no changing of Nature Mr  Humphry  soon forgot the  Easy Chair  and the Story of calling his Master hard Names as above and grew just the same individual  Mr Humphry  as he was before and in particular as sawcy to his Master upon several Occasions It happen'd one Night that his Master got so very drunk at a neighbouring Gentleman's House that he cou'd not get home but as he was riding homewards fell off from his Horse but it being in a Country Village where he was known the People at an Inn took him up and sent to his House for his Servants to come and fetch him  He kept no Coach nor he cou'd not fit on Horseback so his two Men thought themselves oblig'd to carry him home in a Chair it being near two Miles off and that not a Chair as we call it such as  ply in the Streets of  London  but a meet plain Country Chair when they were just coming out of the Inn comes up Mr  Humphry  and he falls upon his Master with a thousand insolent Reproaches calling him  Drunken old Rogue  and the like and in a Word made the two Men set him down and get a Cart to carry him home in  Everybody cry'd out against Mr  Humphry  for offering such an Affront to his Master told him it was a Shame and the like But his Master that cou'd just speak and that was all call'd out that he wou'd have the Cart ay he wou'd have the Cart  Humphry  you Dog  says he  bring the Cart I will have the Cart I tell you  and at last adds  I'll kill you you Dog if you don't give me the Cart This made the Country People quiet and so Mr  Humphry  like himself put his Master into the Cart and carried him home  The next Day when his Master was sober and come to know how he had been us'd by his Man he conceiv'd such an irreconcileable Grudge against him as was never to be wip'd off and was at last fatal to them both  That Part of the Story is tragical and wou'd be too long for a Letter neither is it to my present Purpose But the short of it is this that this unhappy Gentleman being another time a little in Drink and  Humphry  giving him some provoking Language one Night as they were going home from a Tavern his Master in a Passion run him into the Body and laid him dead at his Foot for which he was try'd at the Country AssIzes and the old Grudge being prov'd the Jury brought him in guilty of wilful Murder and it cost him his Life  I am  c  LETTER VIII  Dear Brother  _I Told you at my Beginning to write on this flagrant Subject I did not intend to trouble you with an Account of the Dishonesty the thieving and whoring among Servants for that these had been frequent not only in all Ages but in all Nations There have always been Thieves and Whores who get into Peoples Houses under the Characters of honest Servants even with Design to rob the Families  and the like  and to talk of these wou'd be to say nothing new yet you must allow me to observe that there were never so many such as now I have been told our famous Thieftaker as they call him has a List of  Newgate  Birds now in Services in this City and Parts adjacent all with Intent to rob the Houses they are in and the Reason of this I hinted at in one of my last namely that it is certainly encreas'd by the Pride and Insolence which Servants in general are now arriv'd to for that as I said then when once Servants are brought to contemn the Persons and Authority of their Masters or Mistresses or Employers they soon come to despise their  Interests and at last to break into their Property and thus they become Thieves in a manner insensible and by the meer Consequence of the Thing  But I am now to describe to you that Sort of Thieving and Robbery which is practis'd by those we call honest Servants in  England  or at least by those who call themselves  honest  and who as I said in my Last wou'd think themselves very much affronted if they shou'd be call'd dishonest or be deny'd Testimonials of their Honesty  The first is Loss of Time If I hire a Servant or a Workman by the Day or by the Week the Meaning of the Agreement is that my Money is their Due when the Hours which they were to work are expir'd and their Time is my Due if they expect their Wages He that defrauds me of any Part of the Time that he makes me pay for is as much a Thief as if he broke open my Cabinet and took away so much Money as those Hours so wasted came to This is certainly just but it is impossible to perswade any Servant of this and they so little value it as a Dishonesty that generally speaking they scorn to acknowledge it either to God or Man  A Friend of mine in the Country had a warm Scuffle with one of these honest Servants upon this Foot a few Months ago He had order'd his Gardener in particular to make a Hotbed for the raising some nice  Plants which he being curious that way took great Delight in and had a Value for The Fellow took his Orders and went out into the Garden as if he went to make the Hotbed but it happen'd that in a Field just without his GardenWall there was some young Fellows playing at Cricket a Sport which the Country People in this Part of  England  very much delight in  Three times the Gentleman went down into his Garden to see what Progress his Gardener had made in the Hotbed at the first time he found him at the Work having made a Beginning which was as much as he cou'd expect for the Time that he had been about it The second time he went down which was two or three Hours after and found he had not done one Stroke towards it more than he had done at first and that he was not at the Work whereupon calling him he found he was at the Backdoor of the Garden looking out into the Field As soon as he heard his Master call him he came in fell to the Work told him that he was but just stept to the Door from the Work that Minute which tho' it was false yet pass'd well enough and my Friend said little to him at that time nor did he know anything of the attractive Sport that was in the Field which occasion'd his Gardener's idle Humour at that time but seeing him fall to work hard while he staid he left him again for two or three Hours more and then comes again to look at the Work  but instead of the Work going on his Gardener was at the same Sport and at the same GardenDoor as before only that being pretty sharp in looking out for his Master he was so nimble as to shut the Garden Backdoor and sculk behind some fine trim'd Hedges that stood convenient for his Purpose and so get to the Hotbed before his Master but as Eyes are quicker than Feet his Master happen'd to see him tho' he thought he had not  As the Gardener thought he had not been seen so his Master did not let him know  at first  that he had seen him but when he came to the Hotbed and found little or nothing done more than was done when he left him before he question'd him tho' calmly what was the Meaning that his Orders had not been executed and the Hotbed made he knowing that the Plants he had to set in it had lain out of the Ground all the while and wou'd be in Danger of spoiling  The Fellow said  He had work'd very hard at it and done what he cou'd and he cou'd do no more than he had done in that Time  and the like  grumbling a little as if he was not justly blam'd  His Master still concealing that he knew anything of what was the Case argued with him awhile how little was done  and told him  that if an Hour's Work or two in a Day had been missing he might indeed not have been able to perceive it or at least his Gardener  might pretend to impose upon him but when instead of missing an Hour or two's Work in a Day there was not an Hour's Work done in the Day he cou'd not be deceiv'd so much and that he expected when he order'd a Thing to be done it shou'd be dispatch'd and not the Time spent at Backdoors and chatting with Companions  c  This was enough to make a Fellow who had Manners little enough without it to be surly and perhaps sawcy However he began a little low at first told his Master he work'd as hard as he cou'd and he  his Master  was never satisfied that he cou'd not work harder  not he  and the like  Perhaps you may work hard when you are at it  says his Master  and perhaps you may work as hard as you can but then you can't say you have work'd as long as you can too or as long as you ought I was only out at the Backdoor two Minutes in the Morning  says he  no Master in  England  wou'd make so many Words about such a Trifle and I am sure I have setch'd it up since The Master smil'd at him and said nothing for awhile but finding him still grow hot and sawcy  he told him  that in Pity to him and to prevent his telling more Lyes he wou'd let him know that he found him the second time at the GardenDoor and told him how long he had been there and how he slunk in and which way he went round to the  Hotbed  to avoid his seeing him  Instead of modestly acknowledging his Fault and asking his Master's Pardon  he told him  he had little to do indeed to watch a poor Servant that he cou'd not stir to speak to a Friend but he must be at his Heels that he was a Servant but wou'd not be a Slave that he knew how to do his Work as well as another without being watch'd And thus the Fellow run on impudentiy as if his Master had injur'd him in the highest Degree by discovering him However his Master commanded his Passion all this while but when he said he knew how to do his Work well enough without being watch'd his Master took him up as if with a kind of a Jest too  Well  says his Master  but you know 'tis natural to watch a THIEF  A Thief  Says the Gardener  a Thief  And repeating it several times flew into not a Passion of Sawciness but even a Rage told his Master he was as honest a Man as himself that he scorn'd a Master that shou'd call him  a Thief  and he wou'd not take it from the best Master that evet kept a Servant he had robb'd him of nothing and was no Thief and wou'd not be call'd so and he wou'd make him prove it  and the like  Well hold  says his Master  don't be so hot if you put me to prove it I do insist upon it and I shall not only prove it but punish you for it too I say you have robb'd me of the Time which I pay you for not only to Day but many Days and that Servant that robs  me of my Time and of his Work in the time that I hire him for robs me of my Money and is as much a Thief as if he stole my Money out of my House or out of my Pocket  O dear  says the Gardener  is that your Thieving you charge me with Will you make a Man a  Thief  for that I think and know myself to be as honest a Man as any in  England  for all that Why hark you Sir  says his Master  do I pay you your Wages or do I not Well  he said  he did not deny but he had his Wages And what do I give you Wages for  says his Master  Why for my Work  says the Gardener  And what if you do not work  says his Master  and yet take my Money as if you did as is the Case to Day  Why  he said  he did not say but it was wrong to take his Money and not do his Work but he did not do so  Prithee  says his Master  don't tell me of its being wrong and such Stuff as that I tell thee 'tis  Thieving  and neither better nor worse and when you tell me a Lye and tell me you have been at work when I know you have been at the Alehouse and out of your Business and by that Cheat you take my Money as if you had been at work I say that is robbing me and when you do so you are  a Thief  there's no mincing the Matter  Well this Word  Thief  ran so in his Head and stuck so in his Stomach that notwithstanding his Master talk'd all this very calmly to him yet his Blood was fir'd with it and he cou'd not work but as soon as his Master's Back was turn'd he stuck up his Spade and his Fork in the Ground and away he goes out at the Backdoor to the Alehouse gets very drunk and came not home 'till about one aClock in the Morning when being by his Master's Order shut out he went back and lodg'd as he cou'd and in the Morning when he came again his Master order'd his other Servants to tell him at the Door that his Master had no more Business for him  He made many Attempts and got several Persons to interceed for him for he had a very good Place of it but his Master was inflexible so he came for his Tools had his Wages and was dismiss'd  When he was going away he told his Master that as he had serv'd him so long and had never differ'd with him before he hop'd he wou'd give him a Certificate I shall explain what is meant here by a Certificate hereafter when I come to that Part  A Certificate  says his Master  Yes I'll give thee a Certificate if thou desirest it  Yes  says the Gardener  I desire it if you please  Why  says his Master  I believe thou had'st better take no Certificate you know  added  his Master  you said you cou'd have Places enough  Well Sir  says the Gardener  but I hope you won't scruple such a Trifile as that  No  says his Master  but I tell thee thou may'st do better without it  Why so Sir  says the Gardener  Why  says the Master  because it will do thee no Good  Yes  he said  it wou'd do him good to be sure when he came to see another Place  Why look you  says his Master  such a Certificate as I must give you will do you no good indeed  Why  says he  will you not give me such a Certificate as the Law directs  Yes indeed will I  says his Master  and that is such as is according to your Desert  Why  said the Gardener  I have been an honest Servant  No hold there  says the Master  I can't say that indeed  Why  says the Gardener  what will you put this little trifling Difference into a Certificate  I'll put in nothing but the Truth  says the Master  What Truth  says the Gardener  And began to be sawcy again  Look you  says the Master  don't be sawcy again for I will not lye for you nor assist you to deceive anybody else as you have me  Well  says the Gardener  give me a Certificate and put what you will into it say your worst I value it not  Say you so  says his Master  well my Certificate shall be just and fair and make you your best of it upon which he wrote his Certificate as follows  I  A W  do hereby certify that the Bearer  G M  serv'd me as my chief Gardener two Years and one Quarter that he is a Person capable of discharging the Place of a Gardener but was dismiss'd by me for neglecting his Business robbing me of my Time and for his sawcy Tongue Witness my Hand this twentieth Day of  August    A W  I shall have Occasion to give you a farther Relation of this Affair of the Certificate so I say no more to it now only this the Fellow took it and went away and had so little Wit as to shew it among his Comrades and FellowGardeners which he did as he thought to expose his Master but they in return made it publick and the poor Fellow became so known by it that indeed it was an effectual Certificate to him for no Gentleman wou'd employ him and he kept out of Place 'till he was almost starv'd but of that also hereafter  I shou'd have told you that in he first Discourse between this Gentleman and his Gardener he ask'd the Fellow the Question in few Words that I formerly ask'd my Overseer namely  Whether he did not think it a  Theft  to rob his Master of his Time if he took Wages of him for it and did not work  He said as above he own'd it shou'd not be so and that it shou'd not be so often But when his Master ask'd him again and kept him to it that it was  Robbery  he answer'd  no indeed  he did not think anything like it he might say it was a Fault but every Fault did not make a Man a  Thief  No no  says his Master  I suppose you count nothing Thievery but what a Man must or may be hang'd or transported for  Truly  he said  he thought it was no Theft for the Law had not made any Punishment for it and if it had been Theft there wou'd have been a Law against it  Very well  says his Master  there is no Law expresly to punish a Man with corporal Punishment for being a Bankrupt and yet we often say that in some Cases a Bankrupt is no better than a Highwayman nay that he deserves to be hang'd a thousand times more than one that robs upon the Road  The Gardener however wou'd not yield to it on any Account whatsoever that robbing his Master of his Time ought to be called Robbing him at all or Theft that it was but what the  Spaniards  call a  Peccadillo  a  small Fault that there was nothing in it but it was what everybody did as well as he and therefore he might do it as well as everybody else  This impudent barefac'd robbing their Masters of their Time and justifying that it is no Theft is the Foundation of almost all the impudent Carriage of those kind of Servants whose Service consists in Labour for first it makes them impatient of Reproof and sawcy if they are spoken to as if they were injur'd not their Masters that they ought to have the Liberty to play at their Work when they thought fit and that the Master had not Right to take any Notice of it and if they are put away for such Behaviour they take upon them to rail plentifully at the Injustice of it  And this brings me to a Part I have not spoken to yet namely the manner in which the Servants generally behave here in  England  when they are dismiss'd any Service  It is very seldom that a Servant can be put away by any Gentleman but that as above they are full of it that they are injur'd that they were put away for nothing or some Trifle nay 'tis very seldom they will own that they were put away at all but that they wou'd serve no longer that they did not like and that they had come away upon some very just Discontent and 'tis  very rare but on such Occasions they will raise some scandalous Lye or other on the Family they come from  But on the otherhand if the Crime is notorious and they have nothing to say to hide it then their Behaviour is still worse and they rail at and abuse the whole Family in the grossest manner possible  From one or both these Cases it generally happens that whenever a Gentleman turns away a Servant in this Country he is sure to make an Enemy I hinted this before when I told you how far this goes with the Gentlemen here and how patiently they submit to be bullied and insulted by their Servants for Fear of being rail'd at and abus'd by them when they are gone But I must add also that it is not always so neither sometimes an unthankful Rogue meets with a Master that knows how to deal with him and for your Diversion I shall here give you a Story that has very lately been the Subject of Satisfaction to all our Neighbourhood  A certain Citizen who had his Country House in a Village near  London  had a Servant who he had kept many Years and had employ'd him in several matters of Business as well as meer Servitude and having had him so long that he was as it were naturaliz'd  to the Family it appear'd that he had really a Kindness for the Fellow  Had the Man had the use of but a moderate Share of common Sense he might have consider'd that tho' his Master had a Kindness for him and did often bear with and pass by his Misdemeanours yet that he might one time or other come to be tir'd of him and that it was not in human Nature to be always winking at the Abuses and ill Behaviour of a Servant it was easy for him to know that his Master did not wink because he cou'd not see for he knew his Master was no Fool and he was himself not Fool enough to be ignorant that whatever he was formerly he was now become a very unsufferable Fellow and such as no Master cou'd or indeed ought to bear with  But whatever he might see and know of himself nothing cou'd bring him it seems to reform or to mend his Manners but he grew worse and worse was drunken idle pilfering and withal an intolerable Swearer To compleat it all he grew sawcy and insolent to his Master as I have told you they all do and whenever he got Drink in his Head was more particularly abusive to his Master than at other times  His Master whose particular Aversion was the Vice of Drunkenness but more especially in his Servants had several times differ'd with him upon that particular Occasion  and sometimes as well as he lov'd him had turn'd him away for it but was still prevail'd with by some Intercession or other and particularly by his Respect which he had for the Fellow to take him again  This Fellow harden'd in that Part of his Carriage which particularly merits the Name of Ingratitude and which render'd him most base because offer'd to a Master and a Family to which he was bound by infinite Obligations such as rating the Station he was in namely of a Servant were as binding in their Nature as he was capable of receiving yet behav'd so that he became a Nusance even to the whole Family and indeed unsufferable for he was not only a Thief a Drunkard idle and negligent in his Business and withal intolerably rude and sawcy when reprov'd but he introdu'd other Thieving into the Family which were at last expos'd by the very Observation of the Neighbours who cou'd not see the Family so abus'd without acquainting them of it  Upon this his Master turn'd him and his Dependants off and dismiss'd him his Service and yet even this his Master did with Calmness and without doing himself that Justice upon him which the Law wou'd have justify'd him in for the Laws here in matters of that Nature are such that this Fellow wou'd have been transported if his Master had thought fit to have carried his Resentment  on to Extremity but in Compassion to him and his Family he forebore that Part  But no sooner was the Fellow dismiss'd but he run about the Town raging and swearing at and damning his Master and the whole Family from whom he had receiv'd so much good Usage and so many Favours representing his Usage as unjust and injurious and as if he had done nothing to merit being turn'd off or that being put out of his Service had cancell'd all the Obligation of former Favours a thousand scandalous Lies were rais'd and spread about by him thro' the Town and  in a Word  he fail'd not to give all possible Testimonies of the utmost Spite Malice and Rage against the whole Family where he and his Family had for several Years together been so well us'd and so much oblig'd  But as the Characters of the Family were plac'd by Providence out of his Reach and that all the Neighbourhood knew how much better they had merited from him it return'd all in his Face nor did his Master or the Family much mind him for as it was below their Resentment they took not the least Notice of it or of them but the Fellow grew infamous by it and gradually grew poor also which must be the Issue of such Conduct for no Families of Note wou'd entertain him  It is true Contempt is the best and indeed the only way to treat such Fellows with and 'tis so severe a Punishment upon them for their Behaviour that it exceeds either the Stocks or the CorrectionPost but the Hardship upon Gentlemen even in the Practice of so much Selfdenial as that of suppressing their own Resentments in such Cases is very great and there are some Cases in Families where the Abuses receiv'd by such People can't be pass'd by and this leads me to some Particulars which really good Families are so much abus'd in by the Villany of turn'doff Servants both Men and Women that it can't  I say  be put up without infinite Injustice to themselves  Nor indeed can this Article be well omitted because it has gone a greater Length in FamilyMischiefs than any Part I have yet spoken to and has been the Ruin of some Families of Note within these few Years The Fact is branch'd out into two Particulars  The Liberty these abusive Creatures call'd  Servants  take with the Reputation of the Families they go from and in particular sacrificing the Characters of the YoungLadies wherever they come  The Treachery of them in betraying YoungLadies of Fortune into the Hands of Villains and Scoundrels  either to debauch them or to Marriages many ways as fatal as the other wou'd be  That the Insults of Servants is risen up to the first Pitch of Villany is now so notorious that a thousand Instances is to be given of it and the Remedy is so hard to be found that the only Hope now left us for the Evil of it seems to lie in the Practice being so scandalous that no Persons of any tolerable Degree of Prudence will lay any Stress upon it The Instances of such Attempts having appear'd meerly malicious are innumerable Some Examples of this I cannot omit it is true they carry me a little off from the MenServants this Part being chiefly in the way of the Women or MaidServants but the Men are not without their Share of it  A certain eminent Family within the Compass of my Knowledge had a particular Affront of this Kind put upon them by a certain  MaidServant  as she was suppos'd to be The Lady being newly dead the Gentleman having three or four Children had hir'd a Housekeeper to manage the Family and kept two MaidServants under her besides the Cook  The Housekeeper was a sober grave Woman that had a bad Husband but he was yet alive and as her Family was reduc'd by his Extravagance and himself got fast by the  Heels in the  FleetPrison  she was glad to get into such a Place as this was for her Support her Master directing what Servants he intended to keep had left it to this Woman his Housekeeper to hire such as she thought proper for his Business and she letting her Husband know that they wanted a ChamberMaid perhaps innocently too that he might if he heard of any send them to her he sends her a Creature of his own procuring to be hir'd and as the most impudent Creatures are sometimes more than ordinarily qualify'd to counterfeit that Modesty which they are not atall bless'd with so this Maid appear'd with the Air of a modest sober Girl as much as cou'd be desir'd and not only the Housekeeper but the Master himself was very well pleas'd with her  She had not however been long in the Family but with a Subtlety beyond the Devil she causes a Feud in the Family between the Housekeeper and another Maid who was properly call'd the NurseryMaid and this she manag'd with such Dexterity that even the two Parties themselves did not so much as suspect that she the Chamber Maid had any hand in it This Quarrel run up to such a Height that  in a Word  it begin to embroil the Family for every Day more or less this Nursery Maid was affronting the Housekeeper 'till at length the Cause came before the Master of the  House who seeing his Housekeeper evidently in the right began calmly to perswade the Maid to be quiet and to make no more Disturbance in the Family but to mend what was complain'd of and do her Business as she shou'd do  The Maid seeing her Master tho' he had spoken very little to her Disadvantage yet apparently against her instead of taking quietly the Reproof which was so much her Due flies out in a Kind of Passion and went raving about the House among the other Servants  telling them  it was easy to see which way things went and that the Housekeeper wou'd be sure to trample poor Servants under Foot when she had her Master on her side and  in a Word  behav'd very sawcily and indeed impudently to her Master intimating little less but that she had been told that he was  in short  too great with his Housekeeper  So great is the Power of Scandal and so greedily do the Minds of the common People entertain any thing that savours of Reproach that tho' the Master himself believing his Character to be out of the Reach of such Tongues despis'd it yet he soon found that it had got Vent in the Family and even in the Neighbourhood also for some who were concern'd for the Reputation of the Gentleman himself came and acquainted him with it  He was a little alarm'd at it then indeed and call'd his Housekeeper to a hearing for she was alarm'd at it as well as he the Servants were then call'd together and examin'd before the Housekeeper's Face and the two Neighbours present all the Servants gave her a Character greater than she desir'd and declar'd that they never saw the least Indecency in her Behaviour in their Lives and it was more particularly observ'd that the two Servants who were really the Traytors in this Wickedness were the forwardest when it came thus to a hearing to justify their Master and the Housekeeper also and with the greatest Expressions of Kindness to the one and Respect for the other  But this look'd so ill among the rest of the Servants that one of them who indeed had been suspected took the Occasion in order to vindicate herself to take the Maid short and tell her before her Master and the Housekeeper that she had been the forwardest to talk of the Housekeeper in a manner that did not become her and began to be particular with her and seem'd inclin'd to enter into some Discovery  But the subtle Wench the NurseryMaid took her up short and said that was only in Mirth and jesting with one another when she had told a Story of a certain Gentleman that had been a little familiar with his House keeper but that she had not the  least Thought of what was now suggested that her Master had indeed been against her in a Dispute between her and the Housekeeper but that was as he pleas'd she thought no Harm upon that Account and down she falls upon her Knees and makes loud Imprecations on herself if ever she entertain'd a Thought to the Prejudice of her Master's Reputation or of the Housekeeper's either and this Part of what she said was really true for she knew within herself that she did not believe what she had reported but that she had rais'd it all maliciously and of her own Head or at least by the Instigation of the other Maid mention'd above who she also knew did it with a Design to supplant the Housekeeper  However this Creature manag'd her Desence with so much Art and fac'd down the other Maid with so much Confidence and so many Words that they were all dismiss'd the Master was defam'd and the poor Housekeeper not only blasted in her Reputation but her Husband was enrag'd and tho' a Prisoner was hardly kept from insulting the Gentleman and his Wife too and tho' all this went on to a very unhappy Length yet still the Servants were all purg'd and stood clear of being the Instruments  But the Master of the House as he was made uneasy at first was much more so when he found that notwithstanding all his  Servants had said the Scandal encreas'd and spread farther and farther upon him and besides that he had some Intimations that this NurseryMaid notwithstanding all she had said before and notwithstanding all her Imprecations had still let fall some little Reflections and had shewn that nothing but Fear restrain'd her for she was resolv'd to ruin the Housekeeper if she cou'd having retain'd an implacable Grudge against her from the first Quarrel as above  Upon this the Gentleman order'd that Maid to be turn'd off and giving her a Month's Wages not a Month's Warning had her turn'd out of Doors that very Night he wou'd not order the Housekeeper to do it because he wou'd not encrease the Quarrel between them then as he found that however innocent the poor Woman was the Reproach wou'd never die unless she was remov'd too he resolv'd to put her off also tho' as he was fully satisfy'd of the Wrong done to her he thought it was particularly hard upon her as it was also upon himself with Respect to his Family because she was a very useful and faithful Servant  The poor Woman was under a great Affliction the Loss of her Place being a Kind of Ruin to her the Circumstances of herself and of her Husband consider'd but she was confounded and her coming from her Place made less grievous to her when  going from her Master's House directly to her Husband in the  Fleet  Prison instead of receiving her kindly as he us'd to do he flew out in a Rage at her abus'd her and fell upon her with his Hands too that she had much ado and not  but  by crying out and some of the Prisoners coming in to help her to escape with her Life and all the while knew nothing what the Reason of it all was after his first Fury was over and she cou'd get Room to talk with him he charg'd her positively with being a Whore and a Whore to her Master and shew'd her a Letter which he had written to her Master reproaching him with abusing him in debauching his Wife intimating that if his Misfortunes had not pinn'd him down in such a Place as he was in he wou'd have come and taken his Revenge with his own Hands  When the poor Woman saw this Letter and what Mischiefs had been so near her she was glad in her Mind that she was come away from her Master for that she saw things were gone too far to have been otherwise but she set herself with all her Cunning to find out if possible who it cou'd be who had carried their Malice to such a Height  There was a poor Woman in the Prison whose Business it was to clean the Rooms run of Errands tend sick Prisoners and any such things as Occasion offer'd to get her Bread this Woman was a sensible good  Sort of body and sharp enough and above all had a singular Character in the Place for her Faithfulness and Honesty to her Trust  This poor Creature was either in the Man's Chamber or near it when he fell foul on his Wife as is said above and did her Endeavour to deliver the poor Wife out of his Hands and consequently came to know something of the Case  After the Man's Wife the Housekeeper had  as I have said  got a little farther into the Affair and found how it stood between her and her Husband she took this poor Woman aside and engaging her to Secrecy and to assist her  told her  the whole Case and withal giving her something in hand with Promise of more employ'd her to find out if possible who it was that cou'd be thus malicious to bring such a horrid Story to her Husband  In the mean time to go back to the  NurseryMaid  as she was turn'd off with some Resentment so she went away full of Resentment and she was no sooner out of the House but she went about railing at the Housekeeper and at her Master too openly calling the first a  Whore  and not forbearing to say she was so to her Master and so impolitick was she in her Discourse that she form'd several Stories which she pretended to say were of her own Knowledge particularly that she saw the Housekeeper go into her  Master's Chamber such a Night naming the time and that she sat up all Night to watch the Door and that she was sure she did not come out till the next Morning that at such a time she saw her Master kiss her and several other Passages too dirty to be repeated here that she went another time into her Master's Chamber presently after he was gone down Stairs and that there were two Pillows in the Bed and the plain Mark of two Bodies as having lain in the Bed all Night  You must take it with you as you go  that the other Servant who as I hinted had kindled this Flame from the Beginning was the Person that privately set all these Wheels at work and gave this foolish Wench the NurseryMaid all her Cue  told her  those Stories of the Housekeeper's being in her Master's Chamber allNight of the Print on the Pillows and in the Bed and affirm'd that she watch'd and that she saw them but brought the other Wench who was forward enough of herself to be reveng'd of the Housekeeper to take it all to herself and tell the Story in her own Name which she did as above  This subtle Creature also made the same hot passionate Girl go to the Housekeeper's Husband in the Prison and tell him all the vile Stories the cou'd invent which had put him into such a Rage and made him beat his Wife and to propose to him that he shou'd  affront the Gentleman in the manner he intended to do by his Letter  Nor did she fail of her Design for everything answering her End she got the Housekeeper turn'd away  as you have heard  after which with a Smile in her Face and a smooth Tongue she went and offer'd her Service to her Master to be Housekeeper 'till as she pretended with a feign'd Modesty he cou'd provide himself more to his Mind  In this Address to her Master she fail'd not to rail plentifully at the Rudeness of the NurseryMaid suggested how she had certainly wrong'd the poor Housekeeper and been the Cause of her Ruin and how justly his Worship had put her away that she deserv'd to be punish'd for that she had certainly done it in meer Malice on Account of the Quarrel they had with one another when his Worship  so she call'd her Master  decided in favour of the Housekeeper that she had heard her say she wou'd be reveng'd of her  and the like  Thus she sacrific'd the very Impliment she had made use of and expos'd her as much as she had made her expose the Housekeeper and all to serve her own turn and get into the Housekeeper's Place which by her sawning Tongue her Treachery not being suspected she brought to pass and was accordingly made Housekeeper as she desir'd  All this while the old Housekeeper was waiting and using an unwearied Diligence to find out if possible who had thus supplanted her and above all who had us'd her so basely to her Husband as to set him against her as had been done and besides the honest poor Woman who she had employ'd at the Prison she set another Woman to work who kept a Shop in the Town where her Master had his CountryHouse and where all these wicked things were done and she told her Case to her and begg'd of her that if the Maid came to her Shop as she knew she wou'd she wou'd endeavour to get some of the Particulars out of her if she cou'd for she suspected tho' she cou'd not prove it that all this abominable Stuff came from her for their old Quarrel tho' she cou'd not so much as think she had any hand in the other Part about her Husband for she was satisfy'd she did not so much as know she had a Husband much less where he was or in what Condition  She had not set these Wheels a working many Days but she found the Effect of her Diligence for this Wench who had been fully instructed by the other who was now the Housekeeper comes in the Morning to the Prison to the Husband and there she begins her Story again from the Beginning affirm'd again that she saw his Wife go into her Master's Chamber at Night after he  went in to go to Bed and that she sat up allNight and was positive she never came out 'till Morning also the visible Appearance of two having been in the Bed  and the like  then she run on in a great many Tokens of more than ordinary Kindness that was between them that she did not treat him with the Distance and Respect due from a Servant but with a kind of Freedom more like a Wife and that her Master did not use her like a Servant but with a kind of Familiarity that anybody might see thro'  and the like  It being in the Morning the poor Woman  I mention'd above  was in the Room doing necessary things as was her Place at first the Maid seem'd a little shy of speaking but he encourag'd her  and said  you may speak freely that is only a poor Woman that tends the Chambers here she minds nothing and so the Wench went on with all the Freedom she wou'd have done if they had been alone  The poor Woman busied herself here and there about the Room as usual and seem'd to take no Notice of anything but as she had listen'd very attentively to all she had said and with Detestation observ'd how she endeavour'd to insinuate Jealousy into the Man and exasperate him against his own Wife she resolv'd to hear a little more of it if she cou'd so finding she had sully vented her Rage and supposing it wou'd not be  long e'er she wou'd go away she goes out first and planting herself in the Way at her going out the Man when he saw her call'd to her to shew her  the Maid  the way out and get the Door at the Stairfoot open'd  She readily offer'd her Service but when she came to the Door she pretended the Turnkey was not at the Door but wou'd come immediately and so ask'd her to go into a little Room which she knew to be empty and sit down so she gets her into the Room  Here she falls a bemoaning her poor Master above Stairs that he shou'd have such hard Luck and be so treated by his Wife when he was under the Affliction of being in Prison and so brought the Wench who was full of it and apt enough to be talkative  I say  she brought her to tell all the Story overagain and to name the Housekeeper's Name and her Master's Name the Place where he liv'd and all she cou'd think of which was what the wise poor Woman wanted for above she had heard the Story but had not the Knowledge of Persons and Names but here the unwary Fool told her Story without any Reserve without the least Caution not dreaming she was just taken in her own Snare  The poor Woman join'd with her in everything said  Ay  and  Yes  to all that requir'd it and got the Bottom of her Resentment  out and then pretending the Turnkey was come went with her to the Door and let her go  When she was rid of her she went immediately while it was fresh in her Memory and set down in Writing everything that was material that she had said with the Names and Circumstances and Times of every Action as well what she had said to her below as what she had said before to him above Stairs and this she did that she might be sure to do Justice to the Man's abus'd Wife and that she might do no Wrong to the Wench  When the Housekeeper came again which was not 'till two or three Days after she stop'd her and wou'd not let her go up to her Husband for  said she  he is in a Range again for here has been an Agent with him enough to enflame ten Husbands so she took her into the same Room  ond told her  the whole Story  as above  It seems this revengeful Creature the NurseryMaid being bent upon doing all the Mischief she was able and being heated with the Discourse she had had here both above Stairs and below went directly from the Prison up to the Chandler's Shop where she us'd to go in her Master's Neighbourhood and there she sits down to refresh herself it being some Distance from the City  The Woman who kept the Shop expected what happen'd  namely  that she wou'd fall upon the old Story and thinking it wou'd not be convenient that she shou'd be brought in as an Evidence against any Servant and for what might be said in her Shop too for that then no Servants wou'd care to come to her Shop she slipt into a Backroom where she as it happen'd had another Woman a Friend that was come from  London  to see her so she brought out her Friend into the Shop upon some Pretence or other and growing all familiar together it was not very long e'er the Maid began her Story about her being turn'd away at such a House and why her Master put her away boldly hinting that she had seen a little too much  and the like  then the Stranger put in her Questions and holding up her Hands made an Admiration that such a thing shou'd happen soandso and in such a Family too she thought the Gentleman had been quite another Person  and the like  this drew the weak passionate Wench in to tell all her Tale ay and more than her Tale too so that wherever  she  came  she  found room to add something or other to the Story  The Housekeeper got a full Account of this also and being thus effectually furnish'd with two sufficient Evidences besides hearing it in Pieces and Parts in several other Places among the Neighbours some here some there  I say  being now fully satisfy'd  who had been the Incondiary  she  upon good Advice causes the Creature to be arrested in the first Place in an Action of Slander and left her Husband might upon Application to him discharge her  she  went and acquainted the Gentleman her former Master of the whole Story who carrying her before a Justice of Peace had her bound over and committed to the House of Correction 'till  she  shou'd find Sureties to appear at the QuarterSessions In this Pickle  she  found herself the very first two or three Days after her having been at the  Fleet  Prison with the Housekeeper's Husband  However  she  found Friends at some length of time and giving Bail  she  got her Liberty again for awhile and not foreseeing what was like to follow she was at first as sawcy as ever but her Friends who knew better things and who found that the Gentleman resolv'd to prosecute her very warmly especially for the poor Woman's Sake and more especially when they came to know what Evidence they had against her warn'd her a little of her Danger and so  she  behav'd something quieter  She began now to find  she  was betray'd and that  she  was in Danger to suffer for the Rudeness of her Tongue and as I  say  this made her a little more humble so in her Discourse  she  let some Words fall that what  she  said was not altogether of her own Head but  that  she  had good Authority for what  she  had said  Some of her Friends carried this to the Housekeeper that prosecuted her  but she answer'd she  was a poor Woman and  she  cou'd not afford to prosecute two or three Folks and besides  she  might say what  she  had said only to slip her own Neck out of the Collar and when a Prosecution shou'd be begun against the Person  she  had accus'd  she  might deny it all again or might run away and not appear at the Trial and so  she  the Housekeeper might be cast for Want of Evidence and for these Reasons  she said she  wou'd not run the venture of going from one to another but the  NurseryMaid  was her Mark  she  had sufficient Evidence against her and  she  wou'd look no farther that besides  she  was the Person who had endeavour'd to set her the old Housekeeper's Husband against her by a forg'd and slanderous Charge and had made him abuse her as he had done and  she  wou'd have the Truth of it out if  she  cou'd but wou'd look no farther for her Enemy than where  she  had found her  But this Accident of the NurseryMaid pretending to say  she had Authors for what she had said  had a farther Effect than what has been yet observ'd and that in two differing ways  first  the  new Housekeeper  who as I have said was at the Bottom of all the Mischief and had been so from the  Beginning but had craftily conceal'd herself began to be apprehensive that this Wench wou'd discover her as the Author of all and therefore she underhand push'd on the old Housekeeper not to accept of the Offer of a Discovery and put all those Arguments into her Mouth which I have just mentioned and press'd her to prosecute the Maid with the utmost Severity and to bring her to a Tryal with all the Speed  she  cou'd  This  she  manag'd with such Dexterity that the Tryal was hasten'd all her Proposals of a farther Discovery were rejected and  she  was left to expect the worst which indeed was bad enough for her for upon a full Tryal the Maid was sentenc'd to pay a Fine to the Prosecutor for her Damage in the Loss of her Place  I do not remember the Sum exactly  and to be whipp'd publickly at the Cart's Tail thro' the Town where her Master's Country House was and where  she  had liv'd which was executed on her to the utmost as indeed  she  very well deserv'd  she  was lash'd it seems very heartily and nobody pitied her but all the Neighbours said  she  ought to smart for it  But the Story does not end yet the poor Wench tho'  she  had been soundly lash'd had a Fine also to pay to the Housekeeper for Reparation of Scandal and Loss of Employment this they took hold of and she having intimated that  she  cou'd make some Discovery the Housekeeper willing  to know who had been her Friends and who her Enemies in this Affair went to her in the Prison and press'd her to make this Discovery offering her good Encouragement if she wou'd tell who set her on upon all those wicked things  But the Wench was then obstinate  No she said  they had done their worst to her and  she  had no Obligation to gratify them if they had desir'd it of her before  she  had been us'd as  she  was  she  might have serv'd them but now  she  wou'd say nothing They argued with her that there was still room for them to be kind to her that  she  lay under a Fine which  she  was to be kept in Prison for 'till  she  paid and the Prosecutor offer'd to forgive her all the Money  she  was to pay her for Damages on Condition of the Discovery  No she said  it was below her to betray any of her  FellowServants  and  she  wou'd tell them nothing that as to getting out of Prison  she  wou'd do that as well as  she  cou'd but  she  wou'd make no Discovery so they went away concluding it was only Talk and  she  was not able to discover anything but the old Housekeeper wou'd not give it over so for  she  had some Reasons to believe there was something in it so  she  follow'd her still and one Day pressing her very home and  telling her first  what  she  wou'd give her  namely  remit the Damages and gratify her besides  the Maid told her jestingly she  might go among  the Servants and enquire there perhaps  she  wou'd hear of it in the Family without her Help  The HouseKeeper  took her short there and told her  as for  FellowServants she  shou'd not pretend anything of that Nature for  she  was very well satisfy'd there was none of the FellowServants but were so provok'd at the barbarous Treatment of her  the old Housekeeper  and especially of their  Master  that they had all of them declar'd  she  deserv'd what  she  had had and had been eager with her to go on with the Prosecution  Ay said she she  was sure that cou'd not be they wou'd not ALL say so  Yes  says the Housekeeper  every one of them  The Maid laugh'd at her again and with a kind of a Jest repeated the Words  not every one not every one  several times  The Housekeeper answer'd she  wou'd prove it that  every one  of them had openly said so  The Maid then fell to railing and  told her she  ly'd it cou'd not be and if they had said so it was only to blind and deceive her and make a Jest of her  The Housekeeper return'd  yes they had all told her so and particularly  the new Housekeeper had told her she  wou'd be unjust to herself and unkind to her Master's Reputation if  she  did not prosecute her to  the utmost and she wou'd bring her to say so to her Face  The Maid soon discover'd by her Countenance that she meant the same Person when she said  not every one  for upon her naming her  as above she  flew into a greater Passion told her it cou'd not be and that  she  was sure it was a Lye  and the like  Well  says the old Housekeeper  I'll go and fetch such Witness of it as shall convince you of the Truth of what I have said and with that  she  left her and went out the next Morning  she  went to the  new Housekeeper  innocently told her all their Discourse and wou'd have had her gone with her to the Prison to have justify'd what  she  had said for  she  had spoken with such Eagerness against the Wench that the  old Housekeeper  cou'd not imagine but  she  was hearty in it all and wou'd have said the same to her Face  But  she  excus'd herself  first she said she  did not love  fending and proving  what Advice  she  had given her  she  had made use of and it had answer'd the End  she  gave it her for  namely  that  she  had got Reparation of her Credit and the Wench had been severely punish'd and  she  thought  she  ought to be satisfy'd with it and so in  short  excus'd herself from going to the Maid or having any more Trouble about it 'twas time  she said  to let it all drop and die that  the World might not be always gossiping about the Affairs of the Family  But this did not satisfy the Woman so  she  went to her Master and  told him  what the Maid had said  viz  That there was somebody still in his Family who had been the Original of all this Scandal that she had not rais'd it of herself but that  she  had it from somebody in the Family  then told him  the Reasons  she  had to believe it was the  new Housekeeper  and what Steps  she  had taken with her to bring them  FacetoFace  but that the Housekeeper declin'd it her Master bade her be easy he wou'd manage that Part for her for that he wou'd the next Day send the  new Housekeeper  of an Errand to the Maid to carry her some Relief for that tho' he was satisfy'd  she  shou'd be punish'd yet he was not willing  she  shou'd starve and he would send her something by the Housekeeper as if  she    the Housekeeper  had given it of her own Accord  She was jealous this would not do and that the  House keeper  wou'd sham it and not go but send some body else but the Housekeeper was not so cunning but did come believing that carrying Money to the Maid and giving it to her as her own Gift wou'd secure her and this Thought made her Fool enough to go  When  she  came there the  old Housekeeper  who had watch'd her narrowly follow'd quick  after and clapp'd in upon her as if  she  also had come casually to see the Maid and  she  came so suddenly and unlook'd for that she cou'd not avoid their being all together being thus met they began to talk roundly of the Matter and after some time the  old  Housekeeper reminded the  new  one of her formerly expressing honestly  as the old one call'd it  her Detestation of the Fact and pressing her to have her  the NurseryMaid  prosecuted and punish'd and told her the NurseryMaid wou'd not believe her but she hop'd she wou'd not deny it now When she repeated that Part she  the new Housekeeper  broke out in a Passion at it  told her  it was a Lye of her own inventing that she had perswaded her not to go on with the Prosecution but to pity the poor Girl  and the like  The Housekeeper was a little surpriz'd at first with such a Token of Assurance but recovering herself she with a Smile  told her  she was very glad she had found out the Firebrand of the Family that if she had known it a little soouer the poor Nursery Maid shou'd have been pardon'd that she wou'd not only prove she had said so to her but that she had said the same thing to her Master as well as to her perswading him to prosecute the Girl in her  the old Housekeeper  's Behalf and to prove the Truth of it  turning to the NurseryMaid    Susan said she  has she not given you ten Shillings  Yes  says Susan  And has she not given it you as her own Bounty  Susan  Yes  says Susan  Well  says she  'tis my Master's Money  Susan  which he sent in Pity to you  for be said  tho' you were justly punish'd and tho' you had injur'd him he wou'd not let you starve and he knows this Creature has push'd on your Tryal with him  as I said before  as well as with me and he shall own it to her Face  This so stunn'd and stupify'd the  new  Housekeeper that she had not a Word to say at which the Maid  Susan  first fell acrying then flew upon her in a violent Rage and fell a tearing the Cloaths off of her Back and Head what  She said  had she serv'd her so And after that for the  old  Housekeeper stept in and took her off from her  I say  after that she told the  old Housekeeper  the whole Story from the Beginning and how all the Stories of watching their Master's ChamberDoor  and the like  came from this Creature and  in a Word  that it was she that sent  Sasan  to the  Fleet  Prison to rail at her  the old Housekeeper  to her Husband that he might take her away or by affronting their Master cause him to turn her off  Now  the Saddle was set upon the right Mare  and had not poor  Susan  had a terrible Whipping on her bare Back she might have come off free but that Part cou'd not be taken off again however they all parted  in a kind of Wrath the  old  Housekeeper went directly to her Master's House intending to have confronted her Adversary before her Master's Face and the  new Housekeeper  went the same way also with Design to pack up her Cloaths quarrel with her Master and be gone so to be out of the Reach of farther Mischief  To the great Disappointment of the former her Master was gone to  London  and it being very uncertain whether he wou'd return at Night or no and she so warm and eager that she cou'd not wait so she resolv'd to go to his City House and speak with him there but she miss'd him there too and at last heard he was gone to his Country House again but then it was too late for her to go so far so she was oblig'd to defer it 'till next Morning resolving to be there before he was up  But the  new Housekeeper  had the better Luck and she manag'd it wickedly enough if she cou'd have carry'd it afterwards as she ought to have done for her Master coming home and she having thereby an Advantage to tell her Tale by herself she boldly comes up to him and desir'd to speak with him so he went into a Parlour by himself and call'd her in  She was cunning enough to take hold of the Advantage which the Occasion put into her Hands and which he knew not how to get off of for she began with a Shower of  bold Reproaches on him for betraying his own Secret  as she call'd it  and exposing her to  Susan  that he had sent to  Susan  by her Hands but gave her Order to conceal his Name and give it her in her own Name and that then he had discover'd it to his Favourite Mrs the  old House keeper  and had sent her after to tell  Susan  that it was his Money  As I have said above  this plung'd him a little for it was so in Fact and he knew not what to say to it he was heartily vex'd that the  old Housekeeper  had acted so foolishly or falsly he did not well know which and 'till he could see her he scarce knew what to think of it all but recollecting himself a little and remembring what the other  Housekeeper  had told him he found himself oblig'd to bring it out sooner than he intended and to charge her downright with the Fact  namely  with being the Original of all the Noise that had been made in the House and the Abuses both upon Mrs the  old Housekeeper  and also upon himself and yet that she had prompted both of them to prosecute poor  Susan  when she was herself the Cause of it all that  Susan  was but her Tool to kindle the Flame and that all this was done to get the  old Housekeeper  out and to get into her Place  She pretended to be the more enflam'd at this deny'd the thing with great Asseverations for she knew  Susau  who was her  Accuser was not athand but threw back the Dirt of it in his Face with an unlucky Advantage and impudently told him  It seem'd truly now not so unlikely to be true as She had thought it had been  that he was so great with his old Housekeeper and  for ought She knew  there might be something in it seeing he held so close a Correspondence with her that when he had entrusted her with a secret Errand he shou'd go and discover it himself to that very Woman and send such a Creature as that after her to expose her and that  there must be something more in it than ordinary  that there was such a Confidence between them that since it was so she thought she had staid long enough among them and that if he pleas'd to order her to be paid her Wages she wou'd deliver up her Charge and be gone for she was resolv'd she wou'd not sleep another Night in his House and he might go to Bed to his old Favourite as freely as ever she wou'd not interupt him  The Gentleman was really out done by her for she had such a plausible Ground of Complaint that he was confounded However tho' she had treated him with most provoking Language yet he calmly  told her  he had his particular Reasons for letting Mrs know what he had done that yet he did not bid her go and make it known to  Susan  but if she had done so he did not value it and did not doubt but  Mrs had some Reasons for what she had done too which he shou'd know when he saw her and he did not doubt also but she wou'd soon let him hear of it It seems his Housekeeper had been so nimble upon him  for she was as sharp as a Hawk  that she had not given him time to hear in the Family that the old Housekeeper had been there to speak with him and was gone to  London  to seek him as she had left Word  But having calmly  I say  given her this Auswer she continued the more sawcy and grew insolent to the last Degree boasted much of her being faithful and honest and reproach'd him in such an unsufferable Manner with his secret Correspondence with the other Housekeeper that  in short  he was almost provok'd to kick her out of Doors but he restrain'd his Anger and did not touch her himself but causing her Wages to be immediately paid her and her Boxes and Trunks or what she had in the House given her he caus'd her also to be turn'd out that very Hour which was indeed what the cunning Jade wanted and thus they parted with as much Resentment as  Susan  and they had done before  But when Mrs the old Housekeeper came the next Morning and gave the Gentleman an Account of the whole Story as it really was then he found he had been much in the wrong that she had gain'd a Point of him in letting her  go so quietly away and that heought to have sent her immediately to the House of Correction He wou'd have retriev'd the Mistake and sent to several Places in the Town to have stopt her again but she had been in too much Haste to get away overNight to be taken hold of again in the Morning  in a word  she provided for her own Safety and was fled  She had indeed  as I have said  a vast Advantage over him in the first Part of the Story I mean that which related to his sending the Money in the Woman's Name and discovering the Secret to his  old House keeper  and this Creature who told her Tale afterward in the Street told that Part of it so well and so effectually kept it separate from the Reason of the Discovery which was the Counterpart of the Fact that  in short  all the Neighbours ran away with it and it did more towards fixing a real Reproach upon the Gentleman himself than all that had been done or said before nor did the crafty Creature want Emissaries to support the Reflection which she so diligently ply'd and so artfully supported herself in that it blacken'd the Gentleman in a Manner never to be effectually wip'd off tho' he was innocent as an unborn Infant of the Charge or of any Appearance of it  So dreadful a thing is Slander on the Tongue of a subtle Instrument and so much is the Reputation of the most innocent Person  in the World at the Mercy of an insolent Servant when turn'd away be the Occasion ever so just  Nor was the punishing this malicious Creature able either to wipe off the Blot or to stop her Mouth some thought indeed he was in the wrong to pursue her but having the Evidence of the Maid  Susan  and of another which she brought in against her he at last taking hold of her by Accident brought her to Justice and had her lash'd as severely as  Susan  had been before her but it had not so good an Effect upon her as it had upon  Susan  she went raving and railing ten times the more at him and at the other Housekeeper too only by how much she had smarted for it before she was now more wary of her Words and spoke tho' not with less Malice yet with more Crafr framing her Words so as that they cou'd not be taken hold of and continued implacably bent to ruin the Reputation of the Gentleman as much as possible and this way of abusing her Master was as fatal and mischievous to him tho' not so dangerous to her as the other nor was there any Remedy for it but Patience so vile a thing is the Tongue of an insolent Servant when punish'd for their Disorders and this is one of the things which we want a Law against in  England  and which is one of the Reasons of my giving you this Story for if there is no Method  taken better to curb their insolent Tongues when turn'd away all the Masters and Mistresses in  England  will in a little while stand in Awe of their Servants or be at the Mercy of them which is much at one  I am  c  LETTER IX  Dear Brother  _IHIS comes to acknowledge the Favour of Your's of the th in Answer to my Last in which I observe you suggest two things as Doubts upon the Accounts I gave you of the Insolence and unsufferable Pride of Servants in this Country  You say that certainly the English must be very cruel arbitrary and which is still worse unreasonable Masters or  Surely England has no Laws of Subordination in Force for the particular Regulation of Servants for securing their Obedience and stating what is or is not their Duty  I confess 'tis very rational to suggest in general that there must be something or other uncommon that shou'd be the Reason of such things as these that it is not thus in other Nations and that Servants are more at Command and more subject to their Masters or more easily to be punish'd in other Countries and that if it is not so here there must be some Reason to be assign'd for it and that you think one of these must be the Case  But as I know you will bear with my Freedom I take the Liberty to say particularly as to these two things you are entirely mistaken and  First  as to the Behaviour of Masters to Servants I hope you will allow to avoid frequent Repetitions that when I say  Masters  I shou'd be understood to mean Mistresses as well as Masters for they stand in the same Place in Point of Argument  And  First  the contrary is true to an Extream and it is partly to the Account of this very thing I place the first Rise of the Insolence of Servants 'tis so far from being owing to the ill Usage of Servants by their Masters that the unseasonable Lenity Kindness and Tenderness to Servants in this Country is the very Cause of it  In a Word  as I may truly say that the poor know not what it is to be Servants so the Rich  I must acknowledge  know not how to be Masters  I remember a Passage of the famous Colonel  Kirk  who commanded a Regiment of  English  Soldiers in the  French  Service and was fam'd for his Severity of Discipline He had order'd a Sergeant to correct a private Centinel for some Error in his Exercise when he was seeing the Regiment handle their Arms go and knock that Dog down  says the Colonel  the Sergeant believing the Colonel meant that he shou'd cane him only did it very severely when he had done it the Colonel call'd the Sergeant to him when he came lend me your Halbert  says the Colonel  which the Sergeant did very submissively look here  says the Colonel  I'll shew you how to knock a Soldier down and with the Words knock'd the poor Fellow down with his own Halbert It is true  Kirk  was said to be too unmerciful and severe but on the otherhand he had the best disciplin'd Regiment in the whole  English  Body which consisted of five Brigades he was faithfully serv'd and if he had commanded his Men to have jump'd into the Fire they wou'd certainly have done it  They have a Proverbial Saying in this Country which they say was taken from the late Usurper  Oliver Cromwell  who his worst Enemies acknowledge to be a good Soldier they tell us that it was his Saying that to have a good Army you must  hang well  and  pay well  and his known that his own Regiment which wore white Cloaths  and were call'd  Cromwel's Lambs  wou'd follow him thro' Fire and Water never were known to turn their Backs in the Field but had cut in Pieces many a Regiment of the best Cavalry the King had while at the same time 'tis said he had first or last pistol'd three of them with his own Hand when they had mutiny'd upon some Occasion or other and refus'd to march  There is since that another Proverbial Saying upon the very Subject I am upon  namely That the  English  are the best Masters and the worst Servants in the World  If I were to invert that Saying I wou'd place it thus  That the  English  have the uneasiest Servants because they are the easiest Masters in the World In a Word  as I hinted just now we may say  that in  England  the  Rich  know not how to be Masters and therefore the  Poor  know not how to be Servants  There is a Town in  Hertfordsbire  not far from  London  of which they say  That there is nobody  Poor  enough to keep the  TownHogs  or  Rich  enough to keep a  Hogherd This Town is an Emblem of the Country it self but especially of the Poor and 'tis very much to the present Purpose for tho' the Poor are too low to keep a Servant yet they are generally too high to be Servants themselves  I cannot say that the  English  are the best Masters in the World but that they are the easiest kindest tenderest Masters to Servants  that is certainly true  and this is certainly the true Reason of the Mischief I am speaking of  In a Word  as a slack Rein in Government encourages Factions and Rebellions so  easy Masters  make  sawcy Servants  the Master that will bear to be impos'd upon shall be impos'd upon nay I have heard some say he that will be insulted ought to be insulted I will not say so because 'tis an Ingratitude in the Servant but I must allow it is an unpardonable Folly and Mistake in the Master  I have often disguiss'd myself for this purpose and mingl'd in among the Mob of such Fellows as those who we call Footmen I have convers'd with them over a Mug of  Porter  as they call their Alehouse Beer and Ale and there how have I heard them boast over their Master's Kindness to them and how they cou'd do anything they pleas'd that they valued not their Masters a Shilling and that they durst not be angry with them that if they did quarrel d 'em they wou'd be gone and their Master cou'd not do without 'em  One Fellow  was talking thus and I entred into a short Dialogue with him about it I ask'd him what his Master wou'd say to him if he got drunk and if at another time he staid out allNight  and the like  Say to me says he why he wou'd swear at me it may be  Well  says I  and what then  Why then  says he  I wou'd swear it may be as fast as he and d as fast he  And it has been so then sometimes between you  says I  has it  Yes very often  says he  Well but that was when you was drunk  says I  wa'n't it  Yes  said he  But next Morning  says I  how was it with you both then  O  says he  my Master wou'd be a little surly and it may be not speak for a good while and I wou'd take no Notice of it but go about my Affairs as I use to do  and he  wou'd cometo again in a Day or two but if he took any Notice I wou'd tell him I had got a little Drink  that I did not remember I was rude  if I was I was very sorry  but I was in Drink  and the like  Well and what then  said I  O  said he  I knew one good Word wou'd pacify him and he wou'd be pleas'd presently for my Master is the easiest goodnatur'd Man in the World  Very well  says I  that is to say your Master is the easiest Fool in the World  Nay  says he  I cannot deny but my Master is  easy  and that makes his Servants all play upon him as they do  Why  says I  do you not own you are very much oblig'd to your Master for being so goodhumour'd  Yes  says he  but I must own I don't make him a bit the better Servant for that  How do you mean  says I  not a bit better  Mean  says he  why I am the easier to be drunk again and to swear at him again  because  I know for a Word speaking I can make it all up again and then be drunk again and ask Pardon again  and so on  Well but  said I Jack  you must own you are a Dog an ungrateful Dog to him to impose upon his good Nature in that Manner  I don't value that a Farthing  says Jack  if my Master is a Fool it's the better for me is it not then I can be Master when I please  But have you a good Place too  Jack said I  Yes  said he  a very good Place  Well then  says I  why don't you behave better  Jack  that you may not lose it  No no  says he  my Master does not love to change Faces he can't abide to put away Servants we may do anything and say anything if we do but give him a good Word the next Day and say we beg his Pardon all is over with him presently  Well  says I  and are not you all the better Servants for that  No no says he but much the worse for there's scarce a Day in the Week but one or other  of us give ourselves a loose for we know we can make it up again with a Word  Prithee  Jack said I  where did you learn this Principle of Honesty and Gratitude  O  says he  'tis not so much Ingratitude  but  'tis Policy an easy Master must be us'd so  and  we fare never the worse for it  for  we keep him at Bay by it he expects no other  Well but  Jack says I  if you were a Master wou'd you take it of a Servant wou'd you be such an easy Master  O  says  Jack  that's quite another Case  no no what do you take me for a Fool  Well but how wou'd you act  says I  How  says he  D 'em I'd see my Business done and have it done at a Word or I'd make my Cane walk among them  Well but  says I  what if your Servant d as fast as you  as you said just now  and hector'd you as you say you do your Master what wou'd you do then  Do  says he  I'd make 'em fly me as a Pidgeon does a Hawk  I'd open the Door and kick 'em out  and bid 'em go to the Devil  Very well and they wou'd go I suppose  said I  and the next wou'd be the same and so on  Why then  says he  I wou'd turn the next away in the same Manner  and so on as you say  'till I bad a good Servant if I turn'd off a hundred in a Year  And do you think then  said I  that this kind treating of his Servants is a Fault in your Master and that you are all the worse for it  AY most certainly  said he  and he will never have a good Servant while he does so  a FoolMaster always makes a RogueServant  I'll tell you a Story  says  Jack  and so he begins as follows  'There was a poor honest Master Weaver in our Country kept several Apprentices and as I suppose being poor and having but little Houseroom he and his Apprentices lay all in a Chamber together tho' not all in a Bed one Night his Master being gone to Bed in cold Winter Weather and the Candle out feeling a cold Wind come in somewhere calls to his Boy thus  Jack  says the Master  That is the Way of Servants replying or answering in the Country when they are call'd as to say  Sir  or  Madam  is to answer a Call in these Parts about  London  Ay  Master says  Jack I believe that Window is open Jack  says the Master  I believe it is Master  says  Jack  so they lay still awhile Byandby the Master feeling the Cold still calls again  Jack Ay Master  says  Jack The Wind blows very cold at that Window Jack  says the Master  Ay so it does Master  says  Jack  Some time after the Master finding the Boy did'nt stir calls again  Jack  says he  Ay Master  says  Jack Wou'd that Window was shut  Jack  ay wou'd it was Master  says  Jack  but still  Jack  did'nt stir By this time the Master's Patience was spent and feeling the Cold come in at the Window still he rouzes up himself like a Man  Why Jack  says he  Ay Master  says  Jack  again very impudently  You lazy Son of a Whore  says the Master  why don't you rise and shut the Window there  Must I come and rouze you  Get up you Dog and shut the Window Yes Master  says  Jack now you speak in earnest  so he gets up and shuts the Window and all was well  And this  says I  is the true Picture of you Servants is it  Yes indeed  says he  it is so all over the Nation and will be so while Masters act without the Authority of Masters Servants will never shew the Submission and Obedience of their Place  And you learnt it of  Jack  did you  said I  Yes  says he  that was my first Lesson indeed but I am improv'd since by farther Examples  And pray  said I  what is that you call  improv'd  Why  says he  to do as little Work as I can to get into good Company as soon as ever my Master's Back's turn'd  Ay  said I  to come home drunk and be sawcy too is that a Part of it  Why as to that  says he  it will happen so sometimes but that's nothing I do well enough with my Master for that for give him  but a good Word again  when I come to myself  all is over with him presently  Ay  said I  and that encourages you to do so again perhaps the next Opportunity that offers  Why truly  says he  in all Difficulties when Folks come off easy they are the forwarder to venture again We had a great deal of Discourse more besides this I feign'd my self to be a Servant too but that I had a very severe strict Master that wou'd not bear with a Servant being absent from his Business that if any of the Servants were heard to swear it was with the greatest Intercession imaginable that they avoided being turn'd away but if once they got drunk they had no more to do but strip and be gone off with their Livery take their Wages and out of Doors they had as good go voluntarily as stay to be turn'd out for I assure you  said I  my Master never gave a Servant Occasion to be drunk twice in his Service  That's very hard  says he  why any poor Servant may be overtaken and not design it  It's all one  says I  our Master makes it so stated a Rule in the Family that it is no Hardship because all the Servants know it as soon as they come into the House  Well  says he  and you are all sober Dogs ar'n't you Pray what kind of Servants has your Master are they good for anything  All very good Servants I assure you  said I except myself  Nay  says he  it is certainly the only way your Master is in the right of it  to be sure  and none but such Masters will have good Servants but I wou'd not live with him if he wou'd give me double Wages for all that  Why wou'd you not restrain yourself to have a good Place  Not I  says he  'tis not the Way among Servants at this time I have been us'd to be Master wherever I have been and I can't bear those strict Orders of Families not I Confinement won't do with me I must drink with my old Friends sometimes  Well so do we too  said I  for if we ask Leave we are never deny'd he is as civil and kind  that way  to us as we can desire only we must keep our time when we promise to return and not come home Drunk and I do not see any great Harm in that not I  No Harm in it  says he  why 'tis making a Jail of his House such a Service would be  Bridewell  to me I wou'd as lieu beat Hemp  says he  every jot and then he pour'd out two or three Gd dmn him's at such a Master but all the way he own'd that they were the Masters that got good Servants only that he wou'd not serve any Man in  England  upon such Terms not he for he wou'd have his Liberty ay that he wou'd  From this short Discourse between this Fellow and I you may see the state of the Case  in sbort  that 'tis the Easiness and Kindness of Masters in  England  that has ruin'd the Servants  you will say indeed 'tis a Token of a prodigious Baseness in the Minds of the Poor of this Country that they may be forc'd by Discipline but are not to be oblig'd by Kindness and that  said he  cannot be help'd  Among the civil Usage giveu to Servants in  England  I must place the Privileges they have in their Places The Huntsmen have their FieldMoney and are allow'd to carry out the Hounds upon all Occasions to gratify the Gentlemen round  that is to say  to get their FieldMoney  The Gamekeepers are trusted with Powers to take away Guns and Dogs from the meaner People and they abuse the Trust  as you shall hear  and the Game too  HeadCarters and upperPlowmen are often sent to Market and entrusted both to buy and to sell  and you shall hear how they improve  Your Coachmen have Privileges of their own making  namely  of having Compliments from the Tradesmen  that is to say  all those who supply you with things needful to the Equigage such as the Coachmaker Harnessmaker Cornchandler Farrier  c  and the like is the Case with all the Stewards Butlers  c  These are Advantages which our Gentlemen in  France  are too wise to put into the Hands of Mercenaries and Scoundrels such as many times have them here I assure you 'tis far from obliging these Gentlemen  as they call themselves  who I am talking of far from engaging them to be more faithful  to their Masters more careful of their Masters Interest or more affectionate to their Service  on the contrary  it fills their Pockets with Money and that illgotten too so that it eats a Hole into their Consciences and makes them scruple no Villany to encrease it that Money makes them proud insolent and unsufferable withinDoors and drunken and wicked withoutdoors But let me take them in their several Capacities acting to these Principles and consider them apart  Your Huntsman if you do not give him Leave to take the Hounds out when he pleases and can get Company shall take care you shall have little Sport enough when you go out your self nay he shall batter your Horses baulk your Hounds and show you no Sport or to be sure kill you nothing while at the same time he turns Poacher for the unfair Sportsmen and shall show them a Hare sitting as often as they please for the usual Bribe of  a Schilling  If you find him out and make a Fault of it he turns short upon you and tells you saucily  It is his Fees or Vails  as they call it here  and if you wou'd Hunt in Company as other Gentlemen do that the Huntsman might get his FieldMoney he wou'd not do so  FieldMoney is Money given by all the Gentlemen in the Field where they are hunting as often as they find a Hare fitting  that is to say he wou'd have you keep a Pack of Hounds like my LordMayor not for your self but for your Huntsman  that he may get all the young Rakes round the Country and all the loose People he can into the Field and hunt what and where and how they bid him for the meer sake of his  FieldMoney  which they call the Huntsman's Fees till they beat out the Hounds and hackney them till they are good for little or nothing and if you will not do that you shall  as above  go out two or three Days together perhaps and have no Sport your self kill nothing nay perhaps find nothing while your Huntsman who at the same time knows of a Brace or two of Hares sitting shall on purpose to miss of them draw quite another Way if you happen to dislike and bid him go this or that Way he'll tell you he beat all that Ground in the Morning before you came out or perswade you that he knows where there is a Hare that way that he is beating and so draw you off from the Game that he is not willing you shou'd find till you are thorowly fatigu'd and your Horses too and if he lets you kill one single Hare you are to take it for a great Favour  The next is your Ranger or Parkkeeper It is his Business not only to range the Park and see that the Pale is in repair and the Covert in order but to preserve the Deer and he has several large Privileges some when any Deer is kill'd for his Master's House but greater when any Presents are made of Deer alive or of Venison and these Advantages  make the Keeper's Place a very good thing  But instead of being the more faithful unless you consider him extraordinary and every nowandthen give him Leave to sell a fat Buck for you to some great Feast  and the like  you shall feel the Consequence of it for you shall have the Park never fail of being robb'd three or four times in every Season and the best Bucks carry'd off four or five Brace at a time Then to solve his own Credit he has the Impudence to accuse several of the young Fellows round the Country who know nothing atall of the Matter and if any of them cannot give a good Account of themselves they are at least loaded with a Scandal and render's suspected not only there but to all the Gentlemen in the Country when at the same time your Keeper has Horses sent to fetch the Venison by his own Order and as punctually as his Master himself from certain PastryCooks and sly Merchants in  London  who deal in such Goods and perhaps you chance if you come to  London  to give a couple of Guineas to some or other of them for a Haunch of your own Venison On the other hand if in the Country you want any Venison for your own Table or to make a Present of to any neighbouring Gentlemen your Park keeeper shall tell you there is very little fit for your Use and that if you kill any more 'till next Season you will spoil your Park  This is so known a Practice that I need but converse with a few Gentlemen in the Neighbourhood of this City and I might furnish you with a great many diverting Stories upon this Subject and two or three Parkkeepers are I think at this very time in Prison for such Rogueries  This indeed may be said to be a kind of Thieving and so not to come directly into the Subject I am upon but as it is one of these Sorts of Thieving which the Servants of this Age will not allow to be Robbery I place it rather upon the insolent Temper of the Men for 'tis certain those that trade with them in this wicked Trade call it nothing but a Love of Sport and to have an honest Keeper or two befriend them in it but the Laws are of late more severe in this Case than formerly and we shall 'tis hop'd find some Examples made e'er long of which I shall not fail to give you an Account  But I return to the Villany which more immediately respects the Persons of their Masters The next is the Game keeper or as it was call'd formerly the  Falconer  Your Game keeper shall lead you about with your Dogs and your Nets and hardly shew you a Covey of Birds in riding over a whole Lordship At the same time he is under Contract with the Higglers for so many Dozen of Partridges in the Season which he supplies by going out in the Night with a Pair  of  Trammels  with which he kills all the Birds about your Estate  If you send him out with your Gun he shall go about all the Morning and perhaps send you home a Hen Pheasaut and at the same time send all the rest to Market if he shoots a Woodcock or two now and then or a Snipe you must count it a Rarety while at the same time he sets his Snares in all the springy swampy Places in the Woods and near you and takes from five to ten Brace in a Night  In a Word  while the Gentlemen in the Parliament House are making Laws to preserve the Game their own Servants are the greatest  Poachers  in the Country and under Pretence of killing the Game for their Masters they make a Property of the Sport and supply the Hucksters and Carriers with all kinds of Fouls which the Law forbids them to touch  It was on this very Account that the Gentlemen found it necessary to get farther Laws made for preserving the Game and particularly one which forbids upon severe Penalties any Partridges Pheasants Quails  c  being sold in the Shops or Markets or by any Higlers Poulterers or such Persons whatsoever but notwithstanding that and even in Spight of Laws and Penalties the Trade goes on still  By this Means all the Laws for preserving the Game are only made Laws for raising the Price of the Game in the Poulterer's  Shops for as 'tis a kind of contraband Trade they drive it on clandestinely and underhand but Hares Partridges Pheasants  c  are to be bought now as easily as before only they make the Buyer pay double Price and whereas a good Hare might have been bought before for a Shilling or eighteen Pence now they will have four or five Shillings for it but still the Game is as much destroy'd as before  From these very modest Fellows come we next to the Plowmen and Carters Husbandmen and the like  Suppose you now to be a Gentleman in  England  that keeping Part of your Estate in your own Hands keep also a Head Carter or Baily to manage your Team of Horse see your Land plow'd order the Cows the Sheep  and the like  the Servants are all under this Man as the Director of their Labour he orders them when to plow when to sow and in what Places how and where and when the Sheep are to be folded the Calves and Lambs suckled the Fat Cattle sold off and all such things and sometimes he is trusted so far as to be sent to Market to sell what is to be dispos'd of In all which he understands his Business to be that nobody shall cheat you but himself while you are easy at all he does he is easy with you too because he makes his Market of you but if you straiten him and pretend to look after him his Manners are all vanish'd on a sudden and he is as sour  and surly you scarce know how to speak to him  If you anger him or find Fault with his Management he shall in his Passion whip your Horses starve your fatting Swine suckle other Men's Calves with your Cows and carry on your Affairs with a general Neglect 'till you give him some kind Words again and so make him Satisfaction by putting it into his Power to cheat you again if it be possible worse than he did before  Every MarketDay 'tis suppos'd you send him to Market with something or other of the Produce of the Farm 'tis not worth your while to go perhaps or Miles to sell a Score of Sheep or a Couple of incalv'd Cows or a Load of wheat or Barley but  Thomas  the Carter goes to Market with them and when he returns he very honestly tells you he sold them for  so much  when 'tis very ordinary to have him sell them for  s  in  l  more than he gives you an Account of If you dare but suppose that they might sell for more he begins with you for Thieves are always the first to cry out of being suspected he tells you that he wonders your Worship will not take the Trouble to go to Market yourself that he wou'd much rather you wou'd go and see every thing sold to your Mind that he wou'd go with all his Heart and stand in the Market you need but be at the Tavern hard by and he wou'd bring every Chapman to you and your Worship might  make your own Bargains take the Money yourself and so be satisfy'd that you are not cheated that he thinks nothing of the Trouble of going to Market but hates the trust of it for that if the Markets run low it always makes a poor Servant be suspected  All this while going to Market is his only Aim and he is undone if he does not and yet if you went yourself unless it were without him too he wou'd cheat you to your Face and whisper a low Price to the Buyer tho' he shar'd the Profit with him and so cheat you of  s  to get but of it for himself  I wou'd not load innocent Men willingly but this I may venture to say  viz  That such is the Degeneracy of the Servants of this Country that  in short  except here and there an extraordinary Servant  and I scarce know where that extraordinary Man is to be found  I say except such an extraordinary one no Gentleman can send his Servant with Corn or Cattle to Market but he shall be cheated  It is but the very Week these Sheets were writing that a Gentleman of my Acquaintance living in the Country sent up about Load of Hay to  London  by Water to sell entrusting a Man to sell it for him intending to send a much greater Quantity Hay being this Year between three and four Pound  per  Load at  London  Market  His Servant gave him an Account of the first ten Load as sold ten Shillings  per  Load  cheaper than as he found by neighbouring Farmers Hay was sold for those very Market Days this made him Master of so much Jealousy as to set a more faithful Person as a Spy to watch his Servant at the Market and if possible to inform himself how he sold by the means of this Intelligence he arriv'd to a Discovery that his Servant had put  s per  Load in his Pocket out of every Load of Hay of the whole Parcel having sold it for so much more than he gave his Master an Account of and the doing himself Justice upon this fraudulent Servant is now upon his Hands  Again come to the Plowman and meer labouring Husbandman if he sows in the Field or threshes in the Barn he will cheat you of your Corn even to your Face A Country Farmer that I knew employ'd a poor Man to thresh Wheat in his Barn and every Evening to prevent his being cheated look'd upon the Heap of Corn lock'd up the BarnDoors and sent the poor Thresher home to his Cottage seeing him out himself that he might be sure he was not wrong'd  But one Day having some Suspicion of his Man he took Occasion to send the Thresher out in a Hurry telling him there were Hogs gotten into a Close newly sow'd with Wheat and which lay near the Barn when the Man was gone he makes that an Opportunity to search about the Barn and in a Corner of the Mow he finds hid a  little leather Bag  with about  half a peck of Wheat in it he took no Notice nor did he remove the Bag but cuts a little Bit out of it with a pair of Scissars towards the top so that the Corn wou'd not run out that he might know his Bag again and leaves it as he found it At Night he dismiss'd the Thresher as usual who walk'd away but as soon as he was gone the Master runs a nearer way and meets him in a narrow Field which he knew he would go through and finds the little Bag of Wheat upon his Head carrying it Home as he suppos'd  He did not appear angry or surpriz'd atall but after some other trifling Discourse  he says to him  and art thou going home directly Yes  says the Thresher  and what hast thou got there  Goodman Thomas says the Farmer  I doubt that's some of my Corn The Fellow wou'd have denied it a little at first but seeing himself discover'd Why yes  says he  'tis some of the Sweepings of the Floor but 'twas such a little  said he  I thought you wou'd not scruple such a small Parcel 'tis nothing but what you would have thrown to the Poultry Poultry  Thomas says the Farmer  but my Poultry are my own and they help to pay my Rent I assure you I thought you wou'd not have carried away any of my Corn  Here  Goodman Thomas  began to be surly seeing himself detected  and said  he never work'd for any Master before that wou'd not give him a handful of Corn for his Cocks and  Hens Well but  Goodman Thomas  and so perhaps wou'd l  says the Farmer  if you had assk'd me but I don't love to have it taken without my Leave The Fellow grumbl'd and began to be sawcy and offer'd to go Well well  Goodman Thomas says the Farmer  I expect you'll bring it backagain in the Morning when you come to Work  Next Morning he came to Work but when the Farmer ask'd for the Bag of Corn  Goodman Thomas  made light of it  and said  he hop'd he wou'd not stand with him for such a small Matter No  Goodman Thomas said the Farmer  if you will ingenuously own how often you have done so how often  says Thomas  why as often as we want it at home I always take a little for our Baking Why Master  says he  don't all the Threshers for you do the same I hope not  says the Farmer  I assure you they that Thresh for me shall not if I can help it Well well  says Goodman Thomas  see where you'll get a Man to Thresh for you that don't do it I thought it no Crime not I and so laugh'd it off and his Master forgave him but dismiss'd him from his Work  But Goodman  Thomas  's Words were all made good for as this made the Farmer more jealous and consequently more careful the next three Threshers he hir'd he took them all in the same Fact with this Difference only that as  Thomas  stole under half a Peck one of them stole a Bushel at a time and the  other Two about half as much each So hard is it to get a Servant now but will not only defraud you and cheat you but like Goodman  Thomas  grin and laugh in your Face when they are discover'd and think it very hard to be restrain'd or huff and insult you and tell you 'tis no Crime that 'tis their Fees and they expect it and that they wou'd not work with you for such Wages if it was not for the other Advantages they make  And it is on this Account that I name the Behaviour of these sort of Servants I mean Husbandmen for it is the same Pride and and Insolence by which the Footmen and HousholdServants are made sawcy that the other are made thievish and dishonest and this is what we must expect will follow in time among all the rest of our Servants for when once they grow sawcy and impudent they will not be long before they grow Thieves 'tis a natural Consequence of the thing for when once Servants are arriv'd to a Contempt of their Masters Persons they can never be suppos'd to have a sincere Regard to their Interest and if they come to be regardless of their Interest they will soon come to have the same Disregard to their Property  There is a kind of a Contest in  England  between Masters and Servants which I never met with anywhere else concerning Honesty and the Servants here have as odd a Notion of Honesty as really they have of Liberty and this false Notion of Honesty is such that  in short  it makes Thieves of half the Servants in  England  and yet at the same time they have the Impudence to call themselves very honest Fellows and wou'd think it very hard to be denied a Character as such when they go from you You see Goodman  Thomas  thought taking a little Wheat for his Family for their baking was no Dishonesty 'twas what everybody did and why shou'd not he do it as well as another  I mention'd the honest thieving of their Time before which they think nothing of their making their Masters pay for those Hours which they spend at the Alehouse to get drunk  I need not repeat it  that is one  Leaving their Masters and running from their Work when there is the greatest Necessity of their Service is another I knew a poor Farmer had his three MenServants run from him in the Prime of his Harvest being got into Company and drunk and left the poor Man destitute of Hands to get in his Corn  A Soldier deserting his Colours especially in time of Service is shot to Death without Mercy and reason good because the Safety of his  King  and  Country  is betray'd by his deserting as much as it is possible for him to betray it  A Servant who hires himself to a poor Farmer to do his Business and runs from him in Harvest as much as in him lies betrays him and ruins him and this very thing is so notoriously practis'd at this time  and is so much a Grievance that the Parliament since my writing these Letters have it under Consideration to oblige Servants to perform their Agreement and stay out the Year and to empower the Justices of Peace and proper Officers to punish fugitive Servants and I doubt not but we shall soon have a very severe Law upon that Subject  But of this hereafter  I am  c  LETTER X  Dear Sir  _I Intended in this Letter to have enter'd into the great Article of the Behaviour of Women Servants which I assure you is at this time grown up to be as great a Grievance as the other and I have by me several little Histories of their Behaviour particularly with respect to the Havock they make of the Reputation of the Families they live in their Pride haughty and insolent Behaviour gay dressing and profusion of Cloathing by which it is now become frequent in middling Families that the Chambermaids have better Laces and finer Silks than the Mistresses and it is not easie to know the Servants from the Daughters of a Family and some of these little Histories wou'd have pleas'd you very well As particularly of a Gentleman in a Visit lately at a House of good Fashion who being recommended to one of the Gentleman's Daughters mistook the Chambermaid for her who was design'd for his Mistress and unhappily stepping up to her saluted her first which Misfortune cost him the loss of his Mistress and the impudent Wench the loss of her Place  I shou'd also have furnish'd you with some very good Accounts of the Disasters of three of four several Ladies of Fortune sold or rather deliver'd into the Hands of Scoundrels by their  MaidServants  the Ladies wheedl'd in to marry them as Fortunes and the Wenches impudently assisting the Ravishers for they cou'd be call'd little less to violate that Honour which was with too easie a Confidence put into their Hands one of which  She Devils  we have since seen deservedly brought to the Gallows  I shou'd likewise have diverted you with the overandabove Insolence of  Female Servants  in the Duty of their FamilyBusiness very proper for the Information of the  Senior  Ladies and for their  Caution  in the managing such  Creatures  and for their  Conduct  when it is their Lot  as  whose is it not sometimes to be afflicted with sawcy and insolent Servants  But I am already swell'd to a Bulk beyond my Expectation and must forbear dwelling any longer upon this Part however entertaining it may be The  Contents  of my last Letter brings me necessarily back to that Part of your Enquiry which respects the Laws which we have in  England  against this Evil and how those Laws are put in Execution I remember your Words were That surely we are deficient in  England  in point of Regulation and that we want good Laws to secure the due  Subordination  of the People you insinuate that it cou'd not be that Servants  cou'd thus set up to be Masters and govern even the Masters themselves and their Families also as it is apparent they do if we had Laws sufficient to enforce their Obedience or if those Laws for enforcing Obedience were sufficiently observ'd or duly executed  My Answer indeed is That our Deficiency is double  That the Laws now in Force are not sufficient the Laws are good but 'tis long since they were made the Circumstances of things are alter'd in the Nation the way of living is alter'd the Rate of Things advanc'd Wages are higher Pride encreas'd Vice grown rampant Drunkenness which is the Ruin of Servants broke in like a Flood GoodManners declin'd  and in a Word  all Sence of  Subordination  is lost among us  Those Laws which we have and which are in Force are ill executed Magistrates are degenerated in themselves and Vice is crept in even on the Bench so that it is not so easie to get the Drunkenness and Debaucheries of the Poor discountenanc'd and punish'd as it wou'd be if the Magistrates were untainted with the  Crimes  they are to punish  But lastly which is yet worse the very  Masters  and  Mistresses  of Families themselves  by their Remissness in taking legal Remedies against the Insolence of Servants and against their refusing to serve and submit to their said  Masters  and  Mistresses  as the Law directs is the great  and indeed  the chief Reason why the  Laws  have not their due Effect upon the lower  Class  of Mankind and why a  due Subordination  is not preserv'd between  Master  and  Servant  as the Law directs  But you will be agreeably surpriz'd when I shall tell you that all this and not this only but all that I have already said upon the Subject of  Servants  is confirm'd by the Parliament which is now sitting having taken this very Matter into their Consideration and thinking it worth their while to inspect the Laws which are now in Being between  Masters  and  Servants  in order to a new Regulation and in order to making those  Laws  more effectual  It is evident that the Legislature sees the Necessity of rectifying this Matter they see that the Rudeness and Insolence of  Servants  is an unsufferable Burthen that it is become so general as to deserve the Name of  a National Grievance  and to call for an additional Force of Law to suppress it  In this the Parliament acts as the antient  Romans  who when their  Slaves  rebell'd resolv'd to arm themselves with Whips for their Correction rather than with Swords to subdue  them by Conquests scorning to attack them on the equal foot of Soldiers and Men of Honour or to let it be said that they stoop'd to the Fear of their Arms but went out arm'd against them as a base and Scoundrel Race whose Spirits were levell'd to their Condition and knew not how to shew their Faces to those who they us'd to tremble at before  Thus our Parliament here in  England  have acted in this  Case  for the Law is a Whip for the Offender the Authority of the  Lictor  is arm'd with these Rods and Axes and supported by the Magistrate and the base rebelling insulting Servant is order'd to remember his proper Station and look that he behaves with due Obedience to his Superiour or to expect the Correction which his Insolence deserves  This coming at the very Juncture of my writing these Letters gives a very satisfactory Sanction to my Opinion  viz  That the Grievance was flagrant and that I was not giving you the Trouble of writing to you on a Subject which was trifling and not worth Notice I shall therefore stop here for the present and wait awhile till we see what sufficient Provision the Parliament will make in this Exigence for preserving the Government of our Families from the Encroachments and Usurpation of our Servants for really as things are now Masters or Heads of Families are no more Masters  Subordination  seems to be at a  Crisis  and the Government is shar'd between  the Head and the Tail the Master and his hir'd Servant the last receives the Wages indeed but the Work is done when and how the hir'd Gentlemen please to perform and if they think fit 'tis often not done atall  I shall give you here as a Conclusion to the whole Work a Representation which has been prepar'd for the Instruction of and due Caution to the Housekeepers of  GreatBritain  in this very needful Case I dare say you will be pleas'd with the Sight of it because it offers something towards a Remedy of this flagrant Mischief and which if the Advice is taken we may be in Hopes that in Conjunction with the new Provision now making in the Parliament  Servants  may in a little time be brought to their Senses again be made to know themselves a little and the Peace and due Government of Families may be again restor'd  THE CONCLUSION  BEING AN Earnest and Moving Remonstrance TO THE Housekeepers of  GreatBritain  In Order to The better Regulating the Manners of Their  Servants  Gentlemen and Ladies  'AS the Insolence of your Servants is your great Grievance and gives you daily Offence so I cannot but believe 'tis very agreeable to you to hear that the Parliament has at length taken this Matter into their Consideration  This is an unanswerable Testimony of not the Necessity of the Remedy only but also of the Weight and Oppression of the Disease that the Complaint is not trifling or the Subject too mean to be concern'd about We read that in  Athens  in  Sparta  and also in  Rome  but especially in the former the due Subjection of Servants was always thought worthy the Care of the Commonwealth even the Diet and the Habits of Servants were provided for in  Licurgus  his Institutions the first he provided for that the poor might not be oppress'd and the latter that they might not forget that they were Servants  I He provided that the Masters shou'd feed their Servants sufficiently that their Strength might be supported for their Labour and then he provided that the Servants shou'd wear a particular Badge of their Servitude that they might be known upon all Occasions to be what they were namely  Servants NB  This was for hir'd Servants not Slaves  Whether our Parliament will think fit to go this Length I know not but this I may appeal to yourselves for that if they do not distinguish the Servants from the Masters and Mistresses the Masters and Mistresses must find some Ways to distinguish themselves from their Servants or  as already frequently happens  the Clark will  soon be worship'd for the Justice and the Maid be kiss'd instead of the Mistress  The antient Laws for Regulation of Servants and for ascertaining their Wages and for obliging single Persons to go to Service are brought into Contempt not so much that the Reason and Necessity of such Laws are not the same as ever or if alter'd are only greater and more pungent than ever but because Masters and Mistresses have slacken'd the Reins of Family Government and given a loose to the Pride and Vanity of Servants and have by that Remissness let them as it were by immemorial Custom go lawless 'till their Servants do not only forget but indeed not so much as know that any such Laws were ever in being much less that they are still in Force among us  As  Gentlemen and Ladies  it is by your Lenity and Remissness in governing your Servants that they have forgot to obey it lies at your Door to retrieve this Loss by recovering your selves and reassuming the Authority which you have laid aside so long 'till you seem'd to have lost it  In a Word 'tis for you to be Masters and Mistresses and then you will have Servants be Servants again for as has been said in publick if Masters will be trampl'd on they shall be trampl'd on and they that will be insulted may expect it 'Tis an old agreed Maxim that Good Masters  make Good Servants but then it is to be debated what is to be understood by the Term a  Good Master  He that being remiss in his Management holds the Rein of his Family Government with a slack Hand or as it were throws them on the Necks of his Servants may be call'd an  Easy Master  but cannot be call'd a  Good Master  To be a good Master is to be a Master that will do his Servant Justice and that will make his Servant do him Justice he may be kind to a Servant that will let him sleep when he shou'd work but then he is not just to himself or a good Governour to his Family but he is not a good or a kind Master no not to the Servant himself who will let him be drunk when he shou'd work and so of all other Vices and therefore  in a Word  however plain and unpleasant a Truth it may be this is certain 'tis a needful a seasonable and an unanswerable Truth that the Want of Family Government is the Ruin of Servants and it is since Family Discipline decay'd in  England  and the good Example of Masters ceas'd that Servants have got the Head and Mastership over us and untill something of an orderly and vertuous Governing of Families comes in Fashion again among us I fear that no Laws Acts of Parliament or publick Regulations will be effectual to this Purpose  Laws are of no Force where Vice and Scandal ennervate the Authority of the Master drunken and disorderly Families will be fill'd with drunken and disorderly Servants nay indeed they are Seminaries of such and send them abroad fully instructed in Wickedness to spread the Contagion in other Families and ruin the Servants wherever they come  Wherefore for Godsake and for your own Sakes nay for your Servants Sakes let Family Government be restor'd and tho' you shou'd not reform yourselves which it may be hop'd this wou'd a little move you to yet reform your Families and suffer no drunken no swearing disorderly Servant to stay in your Houses if all Gentlemen wou'd dismiss such and refuse Certificates of Behaviour to them they must reform or starve  I am not to dictate to Parliaments nor I hope do they need it but an Overture or Proposal may be accepted from WithoutDoors without any Offence I wou'd then most humbly propose in Order to the compleat Regulation of Servants a few Heads only which if duly observ'd wou'd go a great way to humble the Servants of this Age and make them behave after a much different Manner than they do now  That if any menial Servant swore an Oath or curs'd any Person or was disorder'd in Drink within his Master's House or within Yards of the House or Outhouses Walls and Gardens of the same and his Master or Mistress hearing or being inform'd of the same did not immediately cause such Servant to be carried before a Justice of the Peace or dismiss and turn them away he shou'd forfeit  l  Half to the Informer and Half to the Servant himself  That if any menial Servant shou'd swear at or curse to his Face their Master or Mistress from whom they receive Wages or strike or offer to strike or threaten their said Master or Mistress they shou'd upon legal Conviction be transported for Years not to be in the Master's Power to remit the Sentence and the Master not prosecuting to forfeit  l  That if any Master or Mistress so turning away a Servant for swearing or cursing or for being disorder'd in Drink shall at or after their so turning the said Servant away give a Certificate of good Behaviour to them or any Certificate atall without expressing  the said Offence for which they were turn'd away the said Master to forfeit  l  Half to the Informer and Half to the Poor  That if any Master or Mistress shou'd discover or detect any Servant of Fraud Theft Breach of Trust or other Dishonesty to the Value of  s  or upwards and shou'd after such Discovery give a Certificate of good Behaviour to such Servant the Master or Mistress so discovering the Fraud shou'd be liable to make good all Loss or Damage which the said Servant or Servants shou'd occasion in the next Place they go to or where they were receiv'd by Virtue of that Certificate  The Forms of Certificates to Servants to be settled by an Act of Parliament  That any menial Servant turn'd away from his Master or Mistress for lying out of their Houses without Leave or for giving sawcy or insolent Language to his Master shou'd not be allow'd to enter into any other Service or offer themselves to be hir'd to any other Place 'till they had been out of Place at least six Months  That no Master or Mistress shall take any menial Servant into their House without a full Certificate for their Behaviour in the last Places they serv'd in which Certificate the said Servant shall deliver to their new Place when hir'd and if any Master or Mistress shou'd venture to hire a Servant without such a Certificate they shou'd have no Remedy by Law against such said Servant whatever Disorders they committed Murther excepted  That every Certificate of Behaviour given to a Servant shall mention the particular Reason of their being dismiss'd  No Certificate to be refus'd a Servant that dismisses himself and on Complaint the Justices to grant a Certificate if a Master unjustly declines it  If these Conditions or such like were enacted by a Law and strictly observ'd by all the Heads of Families in  GreatBritain  I durst boldly say that the Great Law of  Subordination  wou'd again take Place Servants wou'd learn to know themselves and Family Government wou'd be soon restor'd  One of the great Evils which lies heavy upon Families now in this particular Case of taking Servants is the going about from House to House to take Characters and Reports of Servants or by Word of Mouth and especially among the Ladies this Usage prevails in which the good Nature and Charity of the Ladies to ungrateful Servants goes so far beyond their Justice to one another that an ill Servant is very seldom detected and the Ladies yet excuse themselves by this  namely  that they are loth to take away a poor Servant's GoodName which is starving them and that they may perhaps mend when they come to another Family what was amiss before which indeed seldom happens  This is the Reason why little is got by such Enquiries and the Ladies often run as much Risque in taking a Servant after such Enquiries as if they had not enquired atall and this is the Reason why so many Servants get Places again who have been Whores Thieves Drunkards Swearers and everything that is vile in the Places where they had serv'd before and all this while the Ladies are cheating and abusing one another in Charity to their  Servants  It is Time to put an End to this unseasonable Goodnature 'tis time to be just to yourselves and not to be afraid of speaking Truth for fear of ruining what we call  a Poor Servant  The Care of not being  ruin'd ought to be their own and they ought to consider when they go to Service that they are upon their Behaviour for their Lives and that to misbehave is to be undone  Nor wou'd any of these Severities  shou'd they be call'd so  make the Service of good and wellbehaving  Servants  atall the more severe or difficult because such a  Servant  illus'd might always quit with Advantage and might before a Justice obtain a Certificate without any Expence expressing the Hardship they suffer'd and the Reason of their coming off  And after all I might appeal even to the wellbehaving Servants in  England  to put in their Requests and to tell us what there is for them either to fear or desire which the Laws of  England  do not provide for It is evident the Grievance is not of the Servants side they  do not  really and indeed  cannot  complain they wou'd no doubt be content things shou'd lye just as they are but it cannot be the Cry is loud against them every Part of the Nation complains and I humbly move the good Housekeepers of  England  that they wou'd not now give it over 'till they see the Reformation of Family Discipline effectually made which I hope these few Articles wou'd soon bring to pass Laws have already been made on the  Servants  side for their more easy obtaining Justice for the better Recovery of  Wages and for obliging Masters to perform their Contracts and Covenants the Justices are empower'd to relieve them in the Country and the Chamberlains and Magistrates in the Corporations every poor Apprentice Boy may complain if he has not Food and Cloaths fitting and convenient according to his Indentures and every Plowman and poor ServantMaid may complain to the Justices of Peace  Nay in Favour of faithful and wellbehaving Servants the most favourable Law that was ever contriv'd for their Encouragement was pass'd here in Parliament  namely  That every menial Servant how remote soever from the Place of their Birth yet remaining but one Year at a Time in the Place they were last hir'd to is by that one Year's faithful Service entituled to a Parish Settlement in the Place and if any Disaster happens to them so as that they are disabled for Service by Blindness Lameness or otherwise the Parish is oblig'd to take care of and provide for them as long as they live as much as if they had been born there I doubt few Servants consider the Favour they enjoy by this Law at leastnot 'till they come to want the Help of it  But on the otherhand the insolent Servant without Regard to Master or Mistress to Justice or Reason packs up and runs away when he pleases leaves the Husbandman  in the middle of his Harvest leaves his Garden in the Prime of the Season leaves the Manufactures in the middle of the Spring Trade and after having receiv'd his Wages in the Dead of Winter when there was no Work to be had flies when the Days grow long and his Service useful and goes abroad where he can get the best Pay and for all this the Master has no Remedy  New Laws therefore seem absolutely necessary to enforce the Obedience of Servants and oblige them to continue in their Places according to the Time they respectively agree for when they are hir'd Nothing can effectually do this but a strict Obliging all Persons whether Gentlemen or Husbandmen Artificers Manufacturers or whatever they are who employ Servants or DayLabourers neither to hire or employ any Servant Workman or Labourer without a Certificate of their being fairly discharg'd and having honestly behav'd at the last Place they work'd at tho' it was but for one Day  This Certificate wou'd secure their Behaviour everywhere it wou'd be a Pass to them from Place to Place it wou'd vindicate them from all Charges on Suspicion either in travelling from Place to Place or stopping in any Place in their Way and so it wou'd be of Service to the travelling Poor and prevent their being wrongfully taken up by Hue and Cry or other Pursuit as is often unavoidably their Case  And it wou'd be of Service to the Publick Justice for the more easy apprehending of Thieves and Vagabonds for in case of Robberies and Mischief every honest Man being furnish'd to give a ready Account of his Station from Place to Place those who were not able to give such legal Satisfaction wou'd be immediately taken hold of  Now therefore is the time for the People of  England  to rescue themselves out of the Hands of the worst Slavery they were ever yet in since  Magna Charta  was restor'd to them I mean a Bondage to their own Servants For as they say in  Turkey  that a Renegado is worse than a  Turk  and that a Slave makes the worst  Patroon  so must add that Insolent Servants are the worst Masters
