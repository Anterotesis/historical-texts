 A DISCOURSE ON Antient and Modern LEARNING By the late Right Honourable JOSEPH ADDISON  Esq  Published from an Original MANUSCRIPT of Mr ADDISON's prepared and corrected by himself  LONDON  Printed for T OSBORNE in  Gray  's  Inn  MDCCXXXIV  A DISCOURSE ON Antient and Modern LEARNING  THE present Age seems to have a very true Taste of polite Learning and perhaps takes the Beauties of an antient Author as much as 'tis possible  for it  at so great a Distance of Time It may therefore be some Entertainment to us to consider what Pleasure the Cotemporaries and Countrymen of our old Writers found in their Works which we at present are not  capable of and whether at the same Time the Moderns mayn't have some Advantages peculiar to themselves and discover several Graces that arise merely from the Antiquity of an Author  AND here the first and most general Advantage the Ancients had over us was that they knew all the secret History of a Composure What was the Occasion of such a Discourse or Poem whom such a Sentence aim'd at what Person lay disguis'd in such a Character For by this means they cou'd see their Author in a Variety of Lights and receive several different Entertainments from the same Passage We on the contrary can only please ourselves with the Wit or good Sense of a Writer as it stands stripp'd of all those accidental Circumstances that at first help'd to set it off We have him but in a single View and only discover such essential standing Beauties as no Time or Years can possibly deface  I DON'T question but  Homer  who in the Diversity of his Characters has far excell'd all other Heroic Poets had an Eye on some real Persons who were then living in most of 'em The Description of  Thersites  is so spiteful and particular that I can't but think it one of his own or his Country's Enemies in disguise as on the contrary his  Nestor  looks like the Figure of some antient and venerable Patriot An effeminate Fop perhaps of those Times lyes hid in  Paris  and a crafty Statesman in  Ulysses Patroclus  may be a Compliment on a celebrated Friend and  Agamemnon  the Description of a majestic Prince  Ajax Hector  and  Achilles  are all of 'em valiant but in so different a Manner as perhaps has characterised the different Kinds of Heroism that  Homer  had observed in some of his great Cotemporaries Thus far we learn from the Poet's Life that he endeavoured to gain Favour and Patronage by his Verse and 'tis very probable he thought on this Method  of ingratiating himself with particular Persons as he has made the Drift of the whole Poem a Compliment on his Country in general  AND to shew us that this is not a bare Conjecture only we are told in the Account that is left us of  Homer  that he inserted the very Names of some of his Cotemporaries  Tychius  and  Mentor  in particular are very neatly celebrated in him The first of these was an honest Cobler who had been very kind and serviceable to the Poet and is therefore advanc'd in his Poem to be  Ajax  's Shieldmaker The other was a great Man in  Ithaca  who for his Patronage and Wisdom has gained a very honourable Post in the  Odysses  where he accompanies his great Countryman in his Travels and gains such a Reputation for his Prudence that  Minerva  took his shape upon her when she made herself visible  Themius  was the Name of  Homer  's Schoolmaster but the  Poet has certainly drawn his own Character under when he sets him forth as a Favourite of  Apollo  that was deprived of his Sight and used to sing the noble Exploits of the  Grecians    VIRGIL  too may well be suppos'd to give several Hints in his Poem which we are not able to take and to have lain many bye Designs and Underplots which are too remote for us to look into distinctly at so great a Distance But as for the Characters of such as lived in his own Time I have not so much to say of him as of  Homer  He is indeed very barren in this Part of his Poem and has but little varied the Manners of the principal Persons in it His  Aeneas  is a compound of Valour and Piety  Achates  calls himself his Friend but takes no Occasion of shewing himself so  Mnesteus Sergestus Gyas  and  Cloanthus  are all of 'em Men of the same Stamp and Character  Fortem{que} Gyan fortem{que} Cloanthum  BESIDES  Virgil  was so very nice and delicate a Writer that probably he might not think his Compliment to  Augustus  so great or so artfully concealed if he had scattered his Praises more promiscuously and made his Court to others in the same Poem Had he entertained any such Design  Agrippa  must in justice have challenged the second Place and if  Agrippa  's Representative had been admitted  Aeneas  would have had very little to do which would not have redounded much to the Honour of his Emperor If therefore  Virgil  has shadowed any great Persons besides  Augustus  in his Characters they are to be found only in the meaner Actors of his Poem among the Disputers for a petty Victory in the fifth Book and perhaps in some few other Places I shall only mention  Iopas  the philosophical Musician at  Dido  's Banquet where I can't but fancy some celebrated Master complimented for methinks the Epithet  Crinitus  is so wholly foreign to the Purpose  that it perfectly points at some particular Person who perhaps to pursue a wandring Guess was one of the  Grecian  Performers then at  Rome  for besides that they were the best Musicians and Philosophers the Termination of the Name belongs to their Language and the Epithet is the same  that  Homer  gives to his Countrymen in general  Now that we may have a right Notion of the Pleasure we have lost on this Account let us only consider the different Entertainment we of the present Age meet with in Mr  Dryden  's  Absalom and Achitophel  from what an  English  Reader will find a Hundred Years hence when the Figures of the Persons concerned are not so lively and fresh in the Minds of Posterity Nothing can be more delightful than to see two Characters facing each other all along and running parallel through the whole Piece to compare Feature with Feature to find out the  nice Resemblance in every Touch and to see where the Copy fails and where it comes up to the Original The Reader can't but be pleas'd to have an Acquaintance thus rising by degrees in his Imagination for whilst the Mind is busy in applying every Particular and adjusting the several Parts of the Description it is not a little delighted with its Discoveries and feels something like the Satisfaction of an Author from its own Composure  WHAT is here said of  Homer  and  Virgil  holds very strong in the antient Satirists and Authors of Dialogues but especially of Comedies What could we have made of  Aristophanes  's Clouds had he not told us on whom the Ridicule turn'd and we have good Reason to believe we should have relish'd it more than we do had we known the Design of each Character and the secret Intimations in every Line Histories themselves often come down to us defective  on this Account where the Writers are not full enough to give us a perfect Notion of Occurrences for the Tradition which at first was a Comment on the Story is now quite lost and the Writing only preserved for the Information of Posterity  I MIGHT be very tedious on this Head but I shall only mention another Author who I believe received no small Advantage from this Consideration and that is  Theophrastus  who probably has shewn us several of his Cotemporaries in the Representation of his Passions and Vices for we may observe in most of his Characters something foreign to his Subject and some other Folly or Infirmity mixing itself with the principal Argument of his Discourse His Eye seems to have been so attentively fixed on the Person in whom the Vanity reigned that other Circumstances of his Behaviour besides those he was to describe insinuated themselves unawares and crept  insensibly into the Character It was hard for him to extract a single Folly out of the whole Mass without leaving a little Mixture in the Separation So that his particular Vice appears something discoloured in the Description and his Discourse like a Glass set to catch the Image of any single Object gives us a lively Resemblance of what we look for but at the same Time returns a little shadowy Landskip of the Parts that lye about it  AND as the Ancients enjoyed no small Privilege above us in knowing the Persons hinted at in several of their Authors so they received a great Advantage in seeing often the Pictures and Images that are frequently described in many of their Poets When  Phidias  had carved out his  Jupiter  and the Spectators stood astonish'd at so awful and majestick a Figure he surprized them more by telling them it was a Copy And to make his Words true shewed them the Original in that magnificent Description  of  Jupiter  towards the latter End of the first  Iliad  The comparing both together probably discover'd secret Graces in each of 'em and gave new Beauty to their Performances Thus in  Virgil  's first  Aeneid  where we see the Representation of Rage bound up and chain'd in the Temple of  Janus  Furor impius intus  Saeva sedens super arma et centum vinctus ahenis  Post tergum nodis fremit horridus ore cruento  THOUGH we are much pleased with so wonderful a Description how must the Pleasure double on those who cou'd compare the Poet and the Statuary together and see which had put most Horror and Distraction in his Figure But we who live in these lower Ages of the World are such entire Strangers to this Kind of Diversion that we often mistake the Description  of a Picture for an Allegory and don't so much as know when it is hinted at  Juvenal  tells us a Flatterer will not stick to compare a weak Pair of Shoulders to  Hercules  when he lifts  Antaeus  from the Earth Now what a forc'd unnatural Similitude does this seem amidst the deep Silence of Scholiasts and Commentators But how full of Life and Humour if we may suppose it alluded to some remarkable Statue of these two Champions that perhaps stood in a public Place of the City There is now in  Rome  a very antient Statue entangled in a Couple of Marble Serpents and so exactly cut i  Laccoon  's Posture and Circumstances that we may be sure  Virgil  drew after the Statuary or the Statuary after  Virgil  And if the Poet was the Copyer we may be sure it was no small Pleasure to a  Roman  that could see so celebrated an Image outdone in the Description  I MIGHT here expatiate largely on several  Customs that are now forgotten though often intimated by antient authors and particularly on many Expressions of their cotemporary Poets which they had an Eye upon in their Reflections tho' we at present know nothing of the Business Thus  Ovid  begins the second Book of his Elegies with these two Lines  Haec quoque scribebam Pelignis natus aquosis  Ille ego nequitiae Naso poeta meae  How far these may prove the four Verses prefix'd to  Virgil  's  Aeneid  genuine I shall not pretend to determine But I dare say  Ovid  in this Place hints at 'em if they are so and I believe every Reader will agree that the Humour of these Lines wou'd be very much heightened by such an Allusion if we suppose a Love Adventure ushered in with an  Ille Ego  and taking its Rise from something like a Preface to the  Aeneid  Guesses might be numberless on this Occasion  and though sometimes they may be grounded falsly yet they often give a new Pleasure to the Reader and throw in abundance of Light on the more intricate and obscure Passages of an antient Author  BUT there is nothing we want more Direction in at present than the Writings of such antient Authors as abound with Humour especially where the Humour runs in a Kind of Cant and a particular Set of Phrases We may indeed in many Places by the Help of a good Scholiast and Skill in the Customs and Language of a Country know that such Phrases are humorous and such a Metaphor drawn from a ridiculous Custom but at the same Time the Ridicule flags and the Mirth languishes to a Modern Reader who is not so conversant and familiar with the Words and Ideas that lye before him so that the Spirit of the Jest is quite pall'd and deaden'd and the Briskness of an Expression lost to an Ear  that is so little accustomed to it This Want of discerning between the comical and serious Stile of the Ancients has run our modern Editors and Commentators into a senseless Affectation of  Terence  's and  Plautus  's Phrases when they desire to appear pure and classical in their Language So that you often see the grave Pedant making a Buffoon of himself where he least designs it and running into light and trifling Phrases where he would fain appear solemn and judicious  ANOTHER great Pleasure the Ancients had beyond us if we consider 'em as the Poet's Countrymen was that they lived as it were on the Spot and within the Verge of the Poem their Habitations lay among the Scenes of the  Aeneid  they cou'd find out their own Country in  Homer  and had every Day perhaps in their Sight the Mountain or Field where such an Adventure happen'd or such a Battle was fought  Many of 'em had often walk'd on the Banks of  Helicon  or the Sides of  Parnassus  and knew all the private Haunts and Retirements of the Muses So that they liv'd as it were on  Fairy Ground  and convers'd in an enchanted Region where every▪ Thing they look'd upon appear'd romantick and gave a thousand pleasing Hints to their Imaginations To consider  Virgil  only in this Respect How must a  Roman  have been pleas'd that was well acquainted with the Capes and Promontories to see the Original of their Names as they stand derived from  Misenus Palinurus  and  Cajeta  That cou'd follow the Poet's Motions and attend his Hero in all his Marches from Place to Place That was very well acquainted with the Lake  Amsanctus  where the Fury sunk and cou'd lead you to the Mouth of the Cave where  Aeneas  took his Descent for Hell Their being conversant with the Place where the Poem was transacted gave 'em a greater Relish than we can have at  present of several Parts of it as it affected their Imaginations more strongly and diffused through the whole Narration a greater Air of Truth The Places stood as so many Marks and Testimonies to the Veracity of the Story that was told of 'em and helped the Reader to impose upon himself in the Credibility of the Relation To consider only that Passage in the th  Aeneid  where the Poet brings his Hero acquainted with  Evander  and gives him a Prospect of that Circuit of Ground which was afterwards cover'd with the Metropolis of the World The Story of  Cacus  which he there gives us at large was probably raised on some old confus'd Tradition of the Place and if so was doubly entertaining to a  Roman  when he saw it worked up into so noble a Piece of Poetry as it wou'd have pleas'd an  Englishman  to have seen in Prince  Arthur  any of the old Traditions of  Guy  varied and beautified in an Episode had the Chronology suffered the Author to  have led his Hero into  Warwickshire  on that Occasion The Map of the Place which was afterwards the Seat of  Rome  must have been wonderfully pleasing to one that lived upon it afterwards and saw all the Alterations that happened in such a Compass of Ground Two Passages in it are inimitably fine which I shall here transcribe and leave the Reader to judge what Impressions they made on the Imagination of a  Roman  who had every Day before his Eyes the  Capitol  and the  Forum    Hinc ad Tarpeiam sedem et Capitolia ducit  Aurea nunc olim silvestribus horrida dumis  Jam tum Religio pavidos terrebat agrestes  Dira loci jam tum silvam faxum{que} tremebant  Hoc nemus hunc inquit frondoso vertice collem  Quis Deus incertum est habitat Deus Arcades ipsum  Credunt se vidisse Jovem Cum saepe nigrantem  Aegida concuteret dextrâ nimbos{que} cieret  And afterwards  ad tecta subibant  Pauperis Evandri passim{que} armenta videbant  Romano{que} foro et lautis mugire carinis  THERE is another engaging Circumstance that made  Virgil  and  Homer  more particularly charming to their own Countrymen than they can possibly appear to any of the Moderns and this they took hold of by choosing their Heroes out of their own Nation For by this Means they have humour'd and delighted the Vanity of a  Grecian  or  Roman  Reader they have powerfully engaged him on the Hero's Side and made him as it were a Party in every Action so that the Narration renders him more intent the happy Events raise a greater Pleasure in him the passionate Part more moves him and in a Word the whole Poem comes more home and touches him more nearly than it would have done had the Scene lain in another Country and a Foreigner been the Subject of it No doubt but the Inhabitants  of  Ithaca  preferr'd the  Odysses  to the  Iliad  as the  Myrmidons  on the contrary were not a little proud of their  Achilles  The Men of  Pylos  probably could repeat Word for Word the wise Sentences of  Nestor  and we may well suppose  Agamemnon  's Countrymen often pleas'd themselves with their Prince's Superiority in the  Greek  Confederacy I believe therefore no  Englishman  reads  Homer  or  Virgil  with such an inward Triumph of Thought and such a Passion of Glory as those who saw in them the Exploits of their own Countrymen or Ancestors And here by the Way our  Milton  has been more universally engaging in the Choice of his Persons than any other Poet can possibly be He has obliged all Mankind and related the whole Species to the two chief Actors in his Poem Nay what is infinitely more considerable we behold in him not only our Ancestors but our Representatives We are really engaged in their Adventures and have a personal  Interest in their good or ill Success We are not only their Offspring but Sharers in their Fortunes and no less than our own eternal Happiness or Misery depends on their single Conduct So that ev'ry Reader will here find himself concerned and have all his Attention and Solicitude raised in every Turn and Circumstance of the whole Poem  IF the Ancients took a greater Pleasure in the Reading of their Poets than the Moderns can their Pleasure still rose higher in the Perusal of their Orators tho' this I must confess proceeded not so much from their Precedence to us in respect of Time as Judgment Every City among them swarm'd with Rhetoricians and every  Senatehouse  was almost filled with Orators so that they were perfectly well vers'd in all the Rules of Rhetorick and perhaps knew several Secrets in the Art that let 'em into such Beauties of  Demosthenes  or  Cicero    as are not yet discovered by a modern Reader And this I take to have been the chief Reason of that wonderful Efficacy we find ascrib'd to the antient Oratory from what we meet with in the present for in all Arts every Man is most mov'd with the Perfection of 'em as he understands 'em best Now the Rulers of  Greece  and  Rome  had generally so well accomplish'd themselves in the politer Parts of Learning that they had a high Relish of a noble Expression were transported with a well turned Period and not a little pleas'd to see a Reason urg'd in its full force They knew how proper such a Passage was to affect the Mind and by admiring it insensibly begot in themselves such a Motion as the Orator desir'd The Passion arose in 'em unawares from their considering the aptness of such Words to raise it Accordingly we find the Force of  Tully  's Eloquence shew'd itself most on  Caesar  who probably understood it best and  Cicero  himself was  so affected with  Demosthenes  that 'tis no Wonder when he was ask'd which he thought the best of his Orations he shou'd reply  The Longest  But now the Generality of Mankind are so wholly ignorant of the Charms of Oratory that  Tully  himself who guided the Lords of the whole Earth at his Pleasure were he now living and a Speaker in a modern Assembly wou'd not with all that divine Pomp and Heat of Eloquence be able to gain over one Man to his Party The Vulgar indeed of every Age are equally mov'd by false Strains of Rhetorick but they are not the Persons I am here concern'd to account for  THE last Circumstance I shall mention which gave the Ancients a greater Pleasure in the Reading of their own Authors than we are capable of is that Knowledge they had of the Sound and Harmony of their Language which the Moderns have at present a very imperfect Notion of We find  ev'n in Music that different Nations have different Tastes of it and those who most agree have some particular Manner and Graces proper to themselves that are not so agreeable to a Foreigner Whether or no it be that as the Temper of the Climates varies it causes an Alteration in the animal Spirits and the Organs of Hearing or as such Passions reign most in such a Country so the Sounds are most pleasing that most affect those Passions or that the Sounds which the Ear has been most accustomed to insensibly conform the secret Texture of it to themselves and wear in it such Passages as are best fitted for their own Reception or in the last Place that our national Prejudice and Narrowness of Mind makes every thing appear odd to us that is new and uncommon Whether any one or all of these Reasons may be looked upon as the Cause we find by certain Experience that what is tuneful in one Country is harsh and ungrateful in another And if this  Consideration holds in musical Sounds it does much more in those that are articulate because there is a greater Variety of Syllables than of Notes and the Ear is more accustom'd to Speech than Songs But had we never so good an Ear we have still a fault'ring Tongue and a Kind of Impediment in our Speech Our Pronunciation is without doubt very widely different from that of the  Greeks  and  Romans  and our Voices in respect of theirs are so out of Tune that shou'd an Ancient hear us he wou'd think we were reading in another Tongue and scarce be able to know his own Composure by our Repetition of it We may be sure therefore whatever imaginary Notions we may frame to ourselves of the Harmony of an Author they are very different from the Ideas which the Author himself had of his own Performance  THUS we see how Time has quite worn out or decay'd several Beauties of our antient  Authors but to make a little Amends for the Graces they have lost there are some few others which they have gather'd from their great Age and Antiquity in the World And here we may first observe how very few Passages in their Stile appear flat and low to a modern Reader or carry in 'em a mean and vulgar Air of Expression which certainly arises in a great Measure from the Death and Difuse of the Languages in which the Ancients compil'd their Works Most of the Forms of Speech made use of in common Conversation are apt to sink the Dignity of a serious Stile and to take off from the Solemnity of the Composition that admits them nay those very Phrases that are in themselves highly proper and significant and were at first perhaps study'd and elaborate Expressions make but a poor Figure in Writing after they are once adopted into common Discourse and sound over familiar to an Ear that is every where accustomed to them They  are too much dishonour'd by common Use and contract a Meanness by passing so frequently through the Mouths of the Vulgar For this Reason we often meet with something of a Baseness in the Stiles of our best  English  Authors which we can't be so sensible of in the  Latin  and  Greek  Writers because their Language is dead and no more us'd in our familiar Conversations so that they have now laid aside all their natural Homeliness and Simplicity and appear to us in the Splendor and Formality of Strangers We are not intimately enough acquainted with them and never met with their Expressions but in Print and that too on a serious Occasion and therefore find nothing of that Levity or Meanness in the Ideas they give us as they might convey into their Minds who used 'em as their MotherTongue To consider the  Latin  Poets in this Light  Ovid  in his  Metamorphosis  and  Lucan  in several Parts of him are not a little beholden to Antiquity for the  Privilege I have here mentioned who wou'd appear but very plain Men without it as we may the better find if we take 'em out of their Numbers and see how naturally they fall into low Prose  Claudian  and  Statius  on the Contrary whilst they endeavour too much to deviate from common and vulgar Phrases clog their Verse with unnecessary Epithets and swell their Stile with forced unnatural Expressions 'till they have blown it up into Bombast so that their Sense has much ado to struggle thro' their Words  Virgil  and  Horace  in his Odes have run between these two Extremes and made their Expressions very sublime but at the same time very natural This Consideration therefore least affects them for tho' you take their Verse to Pieces and dispose of their Words as you please you still find such glorious Metaphors Figures and Epithets as give it too great a Majesty for Prose and look something like the Ruin of a noble Pile where you see broken Pillars  scatter'd Obelisks maim'd Statues and a Magnificence in Confusion  AND as we are not much offended with the low Idiotisms of a dead Language so neither are we very sensible of any familiar Words that are used in it as we may more particularly observe in the Names of Persons and Places We find in our  English  Writers how much the proper Name of one of our own Countrymen pulls down the Language that surrounds it and familiariseth a whole Sentence For our Ears are so often used to it that we find something vulgar and common in the Sound and Cant but fancy the Pomp and Solemnity of Stile too much humbled and depress'd by it For this Reason the Authors of Poems and Romances who are not tied up to any particular Set of proper Names take the Liberty of inventing new ones or at least of chusing such as are not used in their own Country and by this Means not a little maintain the  Grandeur and Majesty of their Language Now the proper Names of a  Latin  or  Greek  Author have the same Effect upon us as those of a Romance because we meet with 'em no where else but in Books  Cato Pompey  and  Marcelles  sound as great in our Ears who have none of their Families among us as  Agamemnon Hector  and  Achilles  and therefore tho' they might flatten an Oration of  Tully  to a  Roman  Reader they have no such Effect upon an  English  one What I have here said may perhaps give us the Reason why  Virgil  when he mentions the Ancestors of three noble  Roman  Families turns  Sergius Memmius  and  Ciuentius  which might have degraded his Verse too much into  Sergestes Mnestheus  and  Cloanthus  though the three first wou'd have been as high and sonorous to us as the other  BUT though the Poets could make thus free with the proper Names of Persons  and in that respect enjoy'd a Privilege beyond the Prose Writers they lay both under an equal Obligation as to the Names of Places For there is no poetical Geography Rivers are the same in Prose and Verse and the Towns and Countries of a Romance differ nothing from those of a true History How oddly therefore must the Name of a paultry Village sound to those who were well acquainted with the Meanness of the Place and yet how many such Names are to be met with in the Catalogues of  Homer  and  Virgil  Many of their Words must therefore very much shock the Ear of a  Roman  or  Greek  especially whilst the Poem was new and appear as meanly to their own Countrymen as the Duke of  Buckingham  's  Putney Pikes  and  Chelsea Curiaseers  do to an  Englishman  But these their Catalogues have no such disadvantageous Sounds in 'em to the Ear of a Modern who scarce ever hears of the Names out of the Poet or knows any thing of the Places that belong  to them  London  may sound as well to a Foreigner as  Troy  or  Rome  and  Islington  perhaps better than  London  to them who have no distinct Ideas arising from the Names I have here only mention'd the Names of Men and Places but we may easily carry the Observation further to those of several Plants Animals  c  Thus where  Virgil  compares the Flight of  Mercury  to that of a  WaterFowl Servius  tells us that he purposely omitted the Word  Mergus  that he might not debase his Stile with it which tho' it might have offended the Niceness of a  Roman  Ear wou'd have sounded more tolerable in ours  Scaliger  indeed ridicules the old Scholiast for his Note because as he observes the Word  Mergus  is used by the same Poet in his  Georgics  But the Critic shou'd have consider'd that in the  Georgics Virgil  studied Description more than Majesty and therefore might justly admit a low Word into that Poem which wou'd have disgraced his  Aeneid  especially when a God was to be join'd with it in the Comparison  As Antiquity thus conceals what is low and vulgar in an Author so does it draw a Kind of Veil over any Expression that is strain'd above Nature and recedes too much from the familiar Forms of Speech A violent  Grecism  that wou'd startle a  Roman  at the Reading of it sounds more natural to us and is less distinguishable from other Parts of the Stile An obsolete or a new Word that made a strange Appearance at first to the Reader's Eye is now incorporated into the Tongue and grown of a Piece with the rest of the Language And as for any bold Expressions in a celebrated Ancient we are so far from disliking 'em that most Readers single out only such Passages as are most daring to commend and take it for granted that the Stile is beautiful and elegant where they find it hard and unnatural Thus has Time mellowed the  Works of Antiquity by qualifying if I may so say the Strength and Rawness of their Colours and casting into Shades the Light that was at first too violent and glaring for the Eye to behold with Pleasure  FINIS
