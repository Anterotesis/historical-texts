 POEMS ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS  By STEPHEN DUCK  LONDON  Printed for the AUTHOR MDCCXXXVI  TO THE QUEEN  MADAM  _THE great Honour Your Majesty has done me in giving me leave to prefix Your Royal Name to the following Poems does not encourage me to presume they are worthy to be laid at Your Feet on any other account but only as they are an humble  Tribute of Duty offer'd from a thankful Heart to a gracious Benefactress Your Majesty has indeed the same Right to them as You have to the Fruits of a Tree which You have transplanted out of a barren Soil into a fertile and beautiful Garden It was Your Generosity which brought me out of Obscurity and still condescends to protect me like the Supreme Being who continually supports the meanest Creature which his Goodness has produc'd  I have Room here to expatiate upon a very inviting Subject but Your Majesty has nobly prevented all Panegyric even from the best Pens by building Your  Fame  on a much more lasting Basis than that of  Praise  in  Dedications  Your Encouragements of  Arts  and  Sciences  Your Esteem and Friendship for all Defenders of Truth while they are living  the Regard You pay to their Memories when dead and Your generous Care of their Widows and Orphans record Your Virtues in such Characters as will ever be legible Your Christian Love to Mankind Your zealous Endeavours to promote  Religion  a Soul made tender to feel our Misfortunes and a Will inclin'd to redress them are such amiable and heavenly Qualities as shine best by their own Light and can receive no new Lustre from the finest Description  MAY Heaven long preserve Your Majesty to practise all these Virtues to be a perpetual Source of Comfort and Joy to our glorious Monarch a Blessing to the Nation and a noble Pattern of Beneficence and Generosity to future Queens Your Majesty's great Goodness to myself draws this Prayer from a Heart fill'd with Gratitude As there is so  little Merit in what You now honour with Your Royal Protection I shall endeavour to supply the Defects the only way that is in my Power by my Thanks and Prayers for Your Majesty  These  I will ever continue and always make it my greatest Ambition to shew with what profound Respect I am  MADAM  Your MAJESTY's Most Grateful Most Devoted and Most Dutiful Servant  Stephen Duck  THE PREFACE  _WHAT I propose in this Preface is only to bespeak the Reader's Goodnature and to say something which may incline him to pardon what he cannot commend I have indeed but a poor Defence to make for the Things I have wrote I don't think them good and better Judges will doubtless think worse of them than I do Only this I believe I may say of them That if they have nothing to delight those who may  chance to read them they have nothing to give Modesty a Blush if nothing to entertain and improve the Mind they have nothing to debauch and corrupt it  ANOTHER Motive that I hope may induce the Reader to overlook the Defects in this Volume is That the oldest Poem in it is little more than six Years of Age and a considerable Part of the Time since that was writ has been spent in endeavouring to learn a Language of which I was then intirely ignorant tho' I fear the few Attempts I have made in Translations will too well convince the Public to how little Purpose I have employ'd my Time I confess myself guilty of a great Presumption in publishing Imitations of  HORACE  when many eminent Hands have done it much better before me But when I was only endeavouring to understand him I found it difficult to conquer a Temptation I had to imitate some of his Thoughts which mightily pleas'd me If I may be forgiven this Experiment I promise to trouble the World with nothing of this Nature again at least till I may be able to do my Author more Justice  I have not myself been so fond of writing as might be imagin'd from seeing so many Things of mine as are got together in this Book Several of them are on Subjects that were given me by Persons to whom I have such great Obligations that I always thought their Desires Commands My want of  Education  will be too evident from them for me to mention it here And I hope when the Reader weighs my Performances he will put  that  and other Disadvantages into the Scale  I am afraid the Letter relating to myself wrote by a worthy and learned Gentleman will be thought an improper Thing in a Publication made by myself But as I was desir'd to prefix it by Persons whom I think it an Honour to obey I hope it will be pardon'd and the rather because a very false Account had been publish'd before by a Person who seems to have had as little Regard for Truth as he had for Honesty when he stole my Poems  I would willingly here make known my Obligations to those worthy Persons who first took notice of me in the midst of  Poverty  and  Labour  were I not afraid my Gratitude thus publicly express'd would offend them more than my Silence However I must beg leave to return my Thanks to a Reverend Gentleman of  Wiltshire  and to another of  Winchester  The former made my Life more comfortable as soon as he knew me the latter after giving me several Testimonies of his Bounty and Goodness presented my first Essays to a Lady of Quality attending on the Queen who made my low Circumstances known to Her  Majesty  I hope too that all those Honourable Persons whose  Names  do me so much Credit at the Beginning of my Book will accept my Acknowledgments and Thanks for so liberal a Subscription And as this Volume I fear will tell them they have not encourag'd a Poet I will endeavour to let them see they have been generous to an honest Man  AN ACCOUNT OF THE AUTHOR In a LETTER to a FRIEND  Written in the Year    SIR  _I Don't wonder that you should desire so distinct an Account how  Stephen Duck  came to write Verses and how he manag'd in writing them Philosophers find as much Subject for their Admiration in the minutest Bodies as in the largest and a Poet from the Barn tho' not so great a Man is as great a Curiosity as a Dictator from the Plow I can be particular enough as to his first setting out in Poetry and since you seem to desire it shall give you all the Circumstances I could learn from a Week's Conversation with him in all his Simplicity without considering that many of them to a Person less curious might appear too trifling to be mention'd even in a Letter  MY Friend  Stephen  had originally no other Teaching than what enabled him to read and write  English  he had never taken a single Step toward any other Language As Arithmetic is generally join'd with this Degree of Learning he had a little Share of that too About his Fourteenth Year he was taken from School and was afterwards successively engag'd in the several lowest Employments of a Country Life This lasted for some Years so long that he had forgot almost all the Arithmetic he had learn'd at School However he read sometimes and thought oftener He had a certain Longing after Knowledge and when he reflected within himself on his want of Education he began to be particularly uneasy that he should have forgot something of what he had learnt even at the little School he had been at He thought of this so often that at last he resolv'd to try his own Strength and if possible to recover his Arithmetic again  HIS first Attempt of this kind I take to have been about Six Years ago Considering the Difficulties the poor Fellow lay under this Inclination for Knowledge must have been very strong in him He was then marry'd and at Service he had little Time to spare he had no Books and no Money to get any But he was resolv'd to go thro' with it and accordingly us'd to work more than other Daylabourers and by that means got some little matter added to his Pay This Overplus was at his own Disposal With this he bought first a Book of Vulgar Arithmetic then one of Decimal and a third of Measuring of Land all which by degrees he made himself a tolerable Master of in those Hours he could steal from his Sleep after the Labours of the Day  WHERE there was such a Desire for Knowledge there must be good Sense at bottom and a Soul at least somewhat above the common Conversation he must meet with in his poor State of Life I have ask'd him whom he had that he could talk and converse with in the Country and was pleas'd to find him in this Particular happier than I expected He said he had one dear Friend that he mention'd with uncommon Affection They us'd to talk and read together when they could steal a little Time for it This Friend had been in a Service at  London  for two or three Years He had an Inclination to Books he had purchas'd some and brought 'em down with him into the Country and  Stephen  had always the Use of his little Library which by this Time possibly may be increas'd to two or three dozen of Books This Friend knew no more out of  English  than  Stephen  but by talking together they mutually improv'd each other  Stephen  is all Simplicity He says  "That his Friend can talk better than he as having been more us'd to Company but that he himself has been more us'd to Poetry and in that can do better than his Friend"  HAD it not been for this  Stephen  must have been plac'd in the same Class with  Hai Ebn Yokdhan  and the young  Hermes  in Mr  Ramsay  's  Cyrus  But the Story of their Improvements without any Assistance agrees only with Romances and you know what I am writing to you is a true History Our retir'd Philosopher had his Friend and it seems to have been the greatest Happiness of his Life that he had one They did not only read but reason'd over Points together and I have sometimes thought how agreeable a thing it would have been to have been conceal'd within hearing of them when they were in the midst of some of their most knotty Debates We may imagine 'em both to have had good natural Sense and a few good Books in common between 'em Their Minds were their own neither improv'd nor spoil'd by laying in a Stock of Learning They were perhaps equally well inclin'd to learn both struggling for a little Knowledge and like a Couple of Rowers on the same Bottom while they were only striving perhaps which should out do his Companion they were really each helping the other and driving the Boat on the faster  PERHAPS you would be willing to know what Books their little Library consisted of I need not mention those of Arithmetic again nor his Bible  Milton  the  Spectators  and  Seneca  were his first Favourites  Telemachus  with another Piece by the same Hand and  Addison  's Defence of Christianity his next They had an  English  Dictionary and a sort of  English  Grammar an  Ovid  of long Standing with them and a  Bysshe  's Art of Poetry of later Acquisition  Seneca  's Morals had made the Name of  L'Estrange  dear to them and as I imagine might occasion their getting his  Josephus  in Folio which was the largest Purchace in their Collection They had one Volume of  Shakespear  with Seven of his Plays in it Beside these  Stephen  had read Three or Four other Plays some of  Epictetus    Waller    Dryden  's  Virgil    Prior    Hudibras    Tom Brown  and the  London Spy  You may see I am a faithful Historian by my giving you the Bad with the Good  WITH these Helps  Stephen  is grown something of a Poet and something of a Philosopher I find by him that from his Infancy he has had a Cast in his Mind toward Poetry He has delighted as far back as he can remember in Verses and in Singing He speaks of strange Emotions that he has felt on the top Performances of the little Choir of Songsters in  a Country Chancel and mentions his first hearing of an Organ as a remarkable Epocha of his Life He seems to be a pretty good Judge too of a musical Line but I imagine that he does not hear Verses in his own Mind as he repeats them I don't know whether you understand me I mean that his Ideas of the Notes in a Verse and his Manner of repeating the same Verse are often different For he points out an harmonious Line well enough and yet he generally spoils its Harmony by his way of speaking it  WHAT first gave him a higher Taste of Poetry than he had been us'd to was  Milton  's  Paradise Lost  This came oddly enough into his Hands and when I see you I'll tell you the History of it  Stephen  read it over twice or thrice with a Dictionary before he could understand the Language of it thoroughly This and a sort of  English  Grammar they had have been of the greatest Use to him of any thing  INDEED it seems plain to me that he has got  English  just as we get  Latin  He study'd  Paradise Lost  as others study the Classics The new Beauties in that Poem that were continually opening upon his Mind made all his Labour easy to him He work'd all Day for his Master and after the Labour of the Day set to his Books at Night The Pains he has taken for the Pleasure of improving himself are incredible but it has answer'd too beyond what one could have expected for he seems to understand some of the great and deeper Beauties of that Poem tolerably well and points out several particular Beauties in it which it requires a good nice Eye to discover  'TWAS his Friend that help'd him to the  Spectators  they read them often together and often by themselves  Stephen  tells me that he has frequently carry'd them with him to his Work When he did so his Method was to labour harder than any body else that he might get half an Hour to read a  Spectator  without injuring his Master By this means he us'd to sit down all over Sweat and Heat without regarding his own Health and often to the Prejudice of it If this affects you as it has me I ought not to pass it over that you may not lose the Pleasure of so strong an Instance of Honesty and Industry mix'd together  THE  Spectators  improv'd his Understanding he says more than any thing The Copies of Verses scatter'd in those Pieces help'd on his natural Bent that way and made him willing to try whether he could not do something like 'em He sometimes turn'd his own Thoughts into Verse while he  was at Work and at last begun to venture those Thoughts a little on Paper What he did of this kind was very inconsiderable only scatter'd Thoughts and generally not above four or five Lines on the same Subject which as there was nobody thereabouts that car'd for Verses nor any body that could tell him whether they were good or bad he generally flung into the Fire as soon as he had pleas'd himself enough in reading them  WHATEVER Care he took to burn these little Pieces he found it not sufficient to conceal them The Thing took Air and  Stephen  who had before the Name of a Scholar among the Country People was said now to be able to write Verses too This was mention'd accidentally about a Year ago before a young Gentleman of  Oxford  who sent for  Stephen  and after some Talk with him desir'd him to write him a Letter in Verse That Letter is the Epistle which stands the last in his Poems but was the first whole Copy of Verses that ever he wrote This happen'd to fall into the Hands of some Clergymen in the Neighbourhood who were very well pleas'd with it and upon examining him found the Man had a good deal of Merit They gave him some Presents which as Things stood then were a great Help to him and encourag'd him to go on as much as they could  THIS made him proceed with more Courage And as he had wrote some scatter'd Verses on  Poverty  before this happen'd he carry'd those Thoughts on and fill'd it up as it stands at present in the printed Collection I send you So that this is his second Copy I am very careful in settling the Chronology of his Poems that you may see how he has gone on Step by Step if you please  THE Composition which was next in Order is that on his own  Labours  That Subject was given him by one of those who first encourag'd him and after this was finish'd he was employ'd from the same Quarter in his  Shunammite  As this exceeded any of the rest I think from hence we may date the Aera of his rising in his Character and Circumstances Upon this it was that Persons of Distinction began to send for him different ways In short it got him Fame enough to be pretty trouble some to him at first tho' it is likely to end in a much happier Settlement of him and his Affairs than could ever have been dreamt of by him at his first setting out  WHEN you have read his Poems and consider the Manner he has been bred up in I doubt not you will think they have their Merit But I assure you they give an imperfect Idea of the Man and to know how much he deserves  one should converse with him and hear on what Reasons he omitted such a Part and introduc'd another why he shortens his Style in this Place and enlarges in that whence he has such a Word and whence such an Idea I'll give you all I can recollect of this kind in relation to what is generally reckon'd the best Thing he has wrote  The Shunammite  IN the first Place I found upon Inquiry that he wrote by a Plan he thought over all the Parts as he intended to use them before he made the Verses For a Poem of any Length no doubt 'tis as necessary to do this as it is to have a Draught of a House before you go to building it and yet I believe the common Run of our Poets have generally thought themselves above it or not thought of it at all Tho' the  Shunammite  was written on a Story given to his hand still something of this kind was convenient enough because in forming it anew he did not make use of all the Materials before him and has brought in some of his own He thought the Stretching of the Prophet in so particular a manner must sound strange The Woman introduc'd to tell her Story is a new Cast of his own so is her Doubting and then Confirming herself again by a particular Induction of all  Elisha  's Miracles so the Bringing an Audience about her and their Chorus's when they join together in congratulating her Happiness the last of which closes the Poem in a good proper manner  UPON being ask'd Why he introduc'd a Person to tell all the Story in the  Shunammite  and why he could not as well tell it himself he said he had read  Prior  's  Solomon  and that in reading it  Solomon  's speaking every thing touch'd him particularly He was then ask'd since it was to be spoken why he did not rather chuse the Prophet as the Person of the greater Dignity to speak it He said to this That the Woman was to be pity'd That there seem'd to him to be  Such as these  Ver And she said Nay my Lord thou Man of God do not tye unto thy Handmaid  Ver Did I desire a Son of my Lord Did I not say Do not deceive me  some Expressions of the Woman in the History which if not omitted might lessen our Regard and Compassion for her That if the Prophet had related the Thing he could not have omitted a Word but when the Woman did she might well be allow'd to soften her own Case and to drop when she was cool any thing wrong that she had said in the Violence of her Grief and Passion This is rather fuller in Words than he express'd it but nothing I think is added to his Meaning  AS  Milton  had been his favourite Poet you may wonder why none of his Pieces are in blank Verse I ask'd him about this too Upon which he told me That he had originally written the whole  Shunammite  in blank Verse That upon reading it over he found his Language was not sublime enough for it and that therefore he was forc'd to write it all over again and turn it into Rhyme  UPON reading over the Chapter and his Poem together you will see how justly he shortens and enlarges some of the particular Passages in order to adapt them the more to Poetry Besides some Things already mention'd he drops several little Circumstances in it  See Kings Chap iv Verses and  On the other hand he enlarges on the  Line to  Contentedness and Charities of the Woman on the    c  Look and Attitude of the Prophet on her    Thanks for bearing a Son on  to  the Death of the Child on the    c  See  Reasons of her Confidence in the Prophet in    pointing out the Prophet when she comes to him and in    his Answer in her    pressing the Prophet more earnestly to assist her in    pointing out the dead Child his being    freed from Death and her Thoughts    upon receiving him again into her Arms  'TIS agreeable to see what Use he has made of the little Reading he can have had and how he has improv'd the Thing by observing some good Strokes in the Books he has met with Upon my telling him that I lik'd nothing better in it than his altering  From Line to  the Prophet's Countenance as he does he said he took that Hint from  Telemachus  where the young Prince comes to  Idomeneus  's Court while they are sacrificing The Priest on seeing  Telemachus  breaks off from what he was about assumes a more inspir'd Air and begins speaking of his future Fortunes This Alteration of the Prophet's Countenance  Stephen  says he took from thence but that at the same time he thought himself oblig'd to drop the Wildness and Enthusiasm of it in order to adapt it more to the Nature of a true Prophet  THE Chorus in the Close of the  Shunammite  he said was brought into his Mind by the  Paradise Lost  Book Line and  general Rejoicing of the Angels in  Milton  upon God's  finishing the Creation of the World The first Chorus was not in the Work originally he inserted it when he newform'd it all into Rhyme  HE had also been very careful as to single Words and had Authorities to produce in several little Particulars where one would not expect it For  The  Shunammite  Ver  flow'ry Carmel  he quotes Mr  Pope  and the Prophet's Arbour on the Top of that Mount is cover'd with    Vines  on the Authority of Mr  Sandys  in his Travels For the Words  and  adust  and  supernal  he refers to  Milton    Fanatic  he uses according to the true and not the vulgar Sense of the Word he had learn'd the proper Meaning of it from his Dictionary    Dilated Heart  as spoken of Sorrow is certainly a Fault but it is a Fault that  Stephen  was naturally enough led into by the common Notion and Expressions in the Country of the Heart's  swelling  and being ready to  burst  with Grief  HE owns his Faults very readily and if he thinks a Line of his better than ordinary he will say so without any Reserve He seems to be exceedingly open and honest in every thing he says and 'twould be very difficult for you to be with him a Week as I have been without going away very much his Friend  THO' I have been so long in shewing you how critically he has proceeded as to his own Works I shall add some of his Thoughts on the Works of others to give you as full an Idea of him as I can  'TIS not yet three Years ago that he first met with  Milton  and I believe that was the first Poet of real Value that he ever study'd in earnest He has assur'd me with all his Innocence and Simplicity that when he came afterwards to read  Addison  's Criticisms on  Milton  in the  Spectators  'twas a high Pleasure to him to find many Things mention'd there in the Praise of  Milton  exactly as he had before thought in reading him Here we must depend on his Credit which I need not tell you with me is very good  THE Name of  Milton  whom he admires and dotes on so particularly has not prevail'd on him enough to make him like his  Paradise Regain'd  In speaking of these two Poems he said  "he wonder'd how  Milton  could write so incomparably well where he had so little to lead him and so very poorly where he had more"  THE  Spectators  you know he has read with great Pleasure and great Improvement I remember particularly that on somebody's calling them  Prose  he said  "'Twas true they were  Prose  but there was something in 'em that pleas'd almost like  Verse  "  He mention'd with more Regard than usual the critical Papers on Wit those on  Milton  the  Justum tenacem  from  Horace  Mr  Pope  's  Messiah  and the several scatter'd ones written in the Cause of Virtue and Religion  UPON asking him what Plays he had read he nam'd particularly  Julius Caesar    Hamlet    Cato    Venice Preserv'd  and  the Orphan Venice Preserv'd  he said gave him the most  Horror  a Word which I took notice he us'd sometimes for Sorrow and sometimes in its proper Sense He could not bear the comic Parts in it  Hamlet  he lik'd better than  Julius Caesar  and in  Hamlet  pointed out that celebrated Speech  To be or not to be  c as having been his favourite Part merely of his own Taste He did not admire  Shakespear  's Comedy and said  "He was too high and too low"  I read over to him some of  Hamlet  and the celebrated Speeches of  Antony  to the People in  Julius Caesar  He trembled as I read the Ghost's Speech and admir'd the Speeches and Turns in the Mob round  Caesar  's Body more he said than ever he had done before As I was reading to him I observ'd that his Countenance chang'd often in the most moving Parts His Eye was quick and busy all the time and to say the Truth I never saw Applause or the shifting of proper Passions appear so strongly in any Face as in his  HE had formerly read  Tom Brown  's  Letters from the Dead  and the  London Spy  not without some Pleasure but after he had been some time conversant with the  Spectators  he said  "He did not care much to look into them"  He spoke of  Hudibras  in another manner he saw a great deal of Wit in it and was particularly pleas'd with the Conjurer's Part in that Poem But after all 'tis not a Manner of writing that he can so sincerely delight in as in the Moral the Passionate or the Sublime  INDEED what every body seems to admire him for is that he seems to have an excellent moral Turn in his Thoughts He is as I told you before something of a Philosopher and what is better than a Philosopher a good honesthearted Man He has read and speaks highly of the Archbishop of  Cambray  's Demonstration of the Being of a God and Mr  Addison  's Defence of the Christian Religion He said  "That they touch'd his Mind and that nothing did so well as when one's Reason is mov'd by what is said"  He had lik'd the little he had read of  Epictetus  but 'twas  Seneca  that had made him happy in his own Mind He seems as yet not to be hurt at all by any Applauses that have been given him and to have been perfectly contented with his Condition before When he had only receiv'd some Presents from Gentlemen in the Country he was quite easy as to his Circumstances The only Thing then that he was solicitous about was how he might succeed as to the Poetry he should be employ'd in This was his chief Concern But even this seem'd to proceed not so much from any Desire of Fame as from a Principle of Gratitude or as he express'd it his Longing to please those Friends that had been so generous to him He was not lifted up with the Character some People gave him and talk'd of Fame absolutely like a Philosopher After his best Fortune many of his Friends told him the Danger of being vain and if he should once be so that he would be as much despis'd as he had been applauded He said  "That he could not well tell what they meant That he did not know what it was to be vain But since so many great Men who knew the World so much better than he did were apprehensive for him on that head he began to be terribly alarm'd at his Danger tho' he had no settled Ideas of what it was"  He was told upon this That he should never speak too highly in Praise of the Poems he had written He said  "If that was all he was safe that was a Thing he could never do for he could not think highly of them Gentlemen indeed he said might like 'em because they were made by a poor Fellow in a Barn but that he knew as well as any body that they were not really good in themselves"  THUS Sir I have obey'd your Commands as faithfully as I am able You desir'd me not to spare Paper but to send you a Book rather than a Letter You see I have taken you at your Word and that I am resolv'd in this as well as in every thing else to shew you how punctually I would ever be

opprest  To free from meaner Cares th'inspired Breast  To give the Genius Liberty to fly  And mount with easier Wings its native Sky  Was worthy HER who always understood  The noblest Use of Pow'r was

Occasion'd by his  Poem  on FRIENDSHIP  NO fancied Muse nor  Heliconian  Stream  Inspires my Verse but thy wellchosen Theme  Wellchosen wellexpress'd while void of Art  Thou speak'st the Dictates of an honest Heart  Truth needs no specious Gloss but ever bright  Shines like the Sun with pure unborrow'd Light  And such thy pleasing Strains No pompous Phrase  Bribes the Unworthy with unhallow'd Praise  No servile Flattery nor dull Design  Creeps with soft Accent thro' the fawning Line  Nor jealous Envy rears its hateful Head  To sting the Living or revile the Dead  Nor Malice nor Caprice hast thou like those  Whose pointed Satire dares a thousand Foes  Not but if Fops lay Snares for Ridicule  And Smartlings think it Wit to play the Fool  Indignant Satire has a just Pretence  With all her Whips to lash them into Sense  To please and only please thy Nature tends  And Friend to all Men makes them all thy Friends  WITH double Transport therefore I peruse  The genuine Truths of your untutor'd Muse  While thus you teach us Friendship's sacred Law  And are yourself the faithful Friend you draw  So to those Priests we glad Attention give  Whose Precepts Sanction from their Lives receive  'TWAS this that rais'd thee from thy lowly Seat  'Tis this shall make thy Happiness complete  A Soul sincere to Gratitude inclin'd  An Heart untainted and an humble Mind  Inspir'd by these write on and charm the Age  Nor dread the envious Critic's idle Rage  For who the snarling ZOILUS regards  When SPENCE approves and CAROLINE rewards  T MORELL  THE CONTENTS  _TO a  Gentleman  who

ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS  To a  Gentleman  who requested a Copy of  Verses  from the Author  SIR  _I Have before the Time prescrib'd by you  Expos'd my weak Production to your View  Which may I hope have Pardon at your Hand  Because produc'd to Light by your Command  Perhaps you might expect some finish'd Ode  Or sacred Song to sound the Praise of God  A glorious Thought and laudable But then  Think what illit'rate Poet guides the Pen  Ill suit such Tasks with one who holds the Plough  Such lofty Subjects with a Fate so low  SIR were your Eloquence and Learning mine  And I like you a Fav'rite of the Nine  I quickly would  Parnassus  ' Summit climb  And find a Hero worthy of my Rhyme  Nor should my Muse the  Grecian  Monarchs trace  Nor would I celebrate the  Trojan  Race  Nor any of those martial Sons of Fame  Pagans unworthy of a Christian's Theme  Far nobler Thoughts my grateful Voice should raise  In lofty Strains to great MESSIAH's Praise  I'd joyfully resound his wond'rous Birth  And paint his Godlike Virtues whilst on Earth  Then with Reluctance Horror and Surprize  I'd mournfully relate his Agonies  I'd trace the heav'nly Hero to the Tree  Sing what he suffer'd there for you and me  Next in heroic Numbers would I tell  How soon he baffled Death and vanquish'd Hell  Subdu'd the Grave and shew'd the glorious Way  From Realms of Darkness to eternal Day  Such noble Subjects should my Lays excite  And you my Patron would in such delight  Grateful to me when you wellpleas'd should view  Th'accomplish'd sacred Song inscrib'd to you  BUT now I must omit MESSIAH's Praise  Lest I degrade him with unworthy Lays  My Fate compels me silent to remain  For want of Learning to improve my Strain  By which no Thought tho' well conceiv'd can rise  To full Perfection but in Embryo dies  Yet my unpolish'd Genius will produce  And bring forth something tho' of little Use  THUS in the Country often have I found  Thro' slothful Man's Neglect a Plat of Ground  Waste and uncultivated void of Seeds  Producing nothing but some trifling Weeds  BUT why stand I my Fate accusing so  The Field calls me to Labour I must go  The Kine low after Meat the hungry Steed  Neighing complains he wants his usual Feed  Then Sir adieu Accept what you did crave  And be propitious to your humble Slave  On POVERTY  NO Ill on Earth we tim'rous Mortals fly  With so much Dread as abject Poverty  O despicable Name We thee to shun  On ev'ry other Evil blindly run  For fear of thee distrustful Niggards go  In tatter'd Rags and starve their Bodies too  And still are poor for fear of being so  For fear of thee the cheating Trader vows  His Wares are good altho' his Conscience knows  He has employ'd his utmost Skill and Care  To hide their Faults and make their Beauties glare  The Sailor terrify'd with Thoughts of thee  Boldly attempts the Dangers of the Sea  From East to West o'er Rocks and Quicksands steers  'Tis Poverty and that alone he fears  The Soldier too whom nought but thee can scare  In Hopes of Plunder bravely meets the War  To fly from Poverty he runs on Death  And shews he prizes Riches more than Breath  Strange Terror of Mankind By thee misled  Not Conscience Quicksands Rocks or Death they dread  And yet thou art no formidable Foe  Except to little Souls who think thee so  Who thro' the Glass of Prejudice survey  Thy Face a thousand frightful Forms display  THUS Men at Night in foolish Fears grown old  Who mind the Fairy Tales their Nurses told  Start at a Goblin which their Fancy made  And for a Spectre often take a Shade  CONTENTED Poverty's no dismal Thing  Free from the Cares unwieldy Riches bring  At Distance both alike deceive our View  Nearer approach'd they take another Hue  The poor Man's Labour relishes his Meat  His Morsel's pleasant and his Rest is sweet  Not so the Rich who find their weary'd Taste  Pall'd with the Prospect of the cumb'rous Feast  For what they have more than they can enjoy  Instead of satisfying does but cloy  BUT let us state the Case another way  Were Poverty so hideous as they say  'Tis nobler chearfully to bear our Fate  Than murmur and repine beneath its Weight  That Man deserves the Praise of human Kind  Who bears ill Fortune with a Christian Mind  How does his great heroic Soul aspire  Above that sordid Wealth the rest admire  His nobler Thoughts are fix'd on Things above  His faithful Eyes survey the GOD of Love  Hold forth the heav'nly Prize which makes him run  His mortal Race to gain th'immortal Crown  Not all the Snares a crafty Dev'l can lay  Can intercept or daunt him in his Way  Not all the scornful Insults of the Proud  Not all the Censures of the grov'ling Croud  Not Poverty in all her Terrors drest  Can shake the solid Quiet of his Breast  Unmov'd he stands against the worst of Foes  And mocks the Darts which adverse Fortune throws  Calm and compos'd amidst or Ease or Pain  And finds Content which others seek in vain  So stands a steady Rock sublimely steep  Within the Confines of the briny Deep  Lash'd by the foaming Surge on ev'ry Side  Yet can't be shaken by the furious Tide  THEN why should Phantoms discompose the Mind  Or Woes so far from real fright Mankind  Since Wealth can never make the Vicious blest  Nor Poverty subdue the virtuous Breast  Since both from Heav'n's unerring Hand are sent  LORD give me either give me but CONTENT  The THRESHER's LABOUR  To the Rev  d  Mr STANLEY  THE grateful Tribute of these rural Lays  Which to her Patron's Hand the Muse conveys  Deign to accept 'Tis just she Tribute bring  To him whose Bounty gives her Life to sing  To him whose gen'rous Favours tune her Voice  And bid her 'midst her Poverty rejoice  Inspir'd by these she dares herself prepare  To sing the Toils of each revolving Year  Those endless Toils which always grow anew  And the poor  Thresher  's destin'd to pursue  Ev'n these with Pleasure can the Muse rehearse  When you and Gratitude demand her Verse  SOON as the golden Harvest quits the Plain  And CERES' Gifts reward the Farmer's Pain  What Corn each Sheaf will yield intent to hear  And guess from thence the Profits of the Year  He calls his Reapers forth Around we stand  With deep Attention waiting his Command  To each our Task he readily divides  And pointing to our diff'rent Stations guides  As he directs to distant Barns we go  Here two for Wheat and there for Barley two  But first to shew what he expects to find  These Words or Words like these disclose his Mind  " So dry the Corn was carry'd from the Field  " So easily 'twill thresh so well 'twill yield  " Sure large Daysworks I well may hope for now  " Come strip and try let's see what you can do"  DIVESTED of our Cloathes with Flail in Hand  At proper Distance Front to Front we stand  And first the Threshal's gently swung to prove  Whether with just Exactness it will move  That once secure we swiftly whirl them round  From the strong Planks our Crabtree Staves rebound  And echoing Barns return the rattling Sound  Now in the Air our knotty Weapons fly  And now with equal Force descend from high  Down one one up so well they keep the Time  The CYCLOPS' Hammers could not truer chime  Nor with more heavy Strokes could  Aetna  groan  When VULCAN forg'd the Arms for THETIS' Son  In briny Streams our Sweat descends apace  Drops from our Locks or trickles down our Face  No Intermission in our Work we know  The noisy Threshal must for ever go  Their Master absent others safely play  The sleeping Threshal does itself betray  Nor yet the tedious Labour to beguile  And make the passing Minutes sweetly smile  Can we like Shepherds tell a merry Tale  The Voice is lost drown'd by the louder Flail  But we may thinkAlas what pleasing thing  Here to the Mind can the dull Fancy bring  Our Eye beholds no pleasing Object here  No chearful Sound diverts our list'ning Ear  The Shepherd well may tune his Voice to sing  Inspir'd with all the Beauties of the Spring  No Fountains murmur here no Lambkins play  No Linnets warble and no Fields look gay  'Tis all a gloomy melancholy Scene  Fit only to provoke the Muse's Spleen  When sooty Pease we thresh you scarce can know  Our native Colour as from Work we go  The Sweat the Dust and suffocating Smoak  Make us so much like  Ethiopians  look  We scare our Wives when Ev'ning brings us home  And frighted Infants think the Bugbear come  Week after Week we this dull Task pursue  Unless when winn'wing Days produce a new  A new indeed but frequently a worse  The Threshal yields but to the Master's Curse  He counts the Bushels counts how much a Day  Then swears we've idled half our Time away  " Why look ye Rogues d'ye think that this will do  " Your Neighbours thresh as much again as you"  Now in our Hands we wish our noisy Tools  To drown the hated Names of Rogues and Fools  But wanting these we just like Schoolboys look  When angry Masters view the blotted Book  They cry "their Ink was faulty and their Pen"  We "the Corn threshes bad 'twas cut too green"  BUT soon as Winter hides his hoary Head  And Nature's Face is with new Beauty spread  The lovely  Spring  appears refreshing Show'rs  New cloath the Field with Grass and blooming Flow'rs  Next her the rip'ning  Summer  presses on  And SOL begins his longest Race to run  Before the Door our welcome Master stands  Tells us the ripen'd Grass requires our Hands  The grateful Tidings presently imparts  Life to our Looks and Spirits to our Hearts  We wish the happy Season may be fair  And joyful long to breathe in op'ner Air  This Change of Labour seems to give such Ease  With Thoughts of Happiness ourselves we please  But ah how rarely's Happiness complete  There's always Bitter mingled with the Sweet  When first the Lark sings Prologue to the Day  We rise admonish'd by his early Lay  This new Employ with eager Haste to prove  This new Employ become so much our Love  Alas that human Joys should change so soon  Our Morning Pleasure turns to Pain at Noon  The Birds salute us as to Work we go  And with new Life our Bosoms seem to glow  On our right Shoulder hangs the crooked Blade  The Weapon destin'd to uncloath the Mead  Our left supports the Whetstone Scrip and Beer  This for our Scythes and these ourselves to chear  And now the Field design'd to try our Might  At length appears and meets our longing Sight  The Grass and Ground we view with careful Eyes  To see which way the best Advantage lies  And Herolike each claims the foremost Place  At first our Labour seems a sportive Race  With rapid Force our sharpen'd Blades we drive  Strain ev'ry Nerve and Blow for Blow we give  All strive to vanquish tho' the Victor gains  No other Glory but the greatest Pains  BUT when the scorching Sun is mounted high  And no kind Barns with friendly Shade are nigh  Our weary Scythes entangle in the Grass  While Streams of Sweat run trickling down apace  Our sportive Labour we too late lament  And wish that Strength again we vainly spent  THUS in the Morn a Courser have I seen  With headlong Fury scour the level Green  Or mount the Hills if Hills are in his Way  As if no Labour could his Fire allay  Till PHOEBUS shining with meridian Heat  Has bath'd his panting Sides in briny Sweat  The lengthen'd Chace scarce able to sustain  He measures back the Hills and Dales with Pain  WITH Heat and Labour tir'd our Scythes we quit  Search out a shady Tree and down we sit  From Scrip and Bottle hope new Strength to gain  But Scrip and Bottle too are try'd in vain  Down our parch'd Throats we scarce the Bread can get  And quite o'erspent with Toil but faintly eat  Nor can the Bottle only answer all  The Bottle and the Beer are both too small  Time flows Again we rise from off the Grass  Again each Mower takes his proper Place  Not eager now as late our Strength to prove  But all contented regular to move  We often whet and often view the Sun  As often wish his tedious Race was run  At length he veils his purple Face from Sight  And bids the weary Labourer Goodnight  Homewards we move but spent so much with Toil  We slowly walk and rest at ev'ry Stile  Our good expecting Wives who think we stay  Got to the Door soon eye us in the Way  Then from the Pot the Dumplin's catch'd in haste  And homely by its Side the Bacon plac'd  Supper and Sleep by Morn new Strength supply  And out we set again our Work to try  But not so early quite nor quite so fast  As to our Cost we did the Morning past  SOON as the rising Sun has drank the Dew  Another Scene is open to our View  Our Master comes and at his Heels a Throng  Of prattling Females arm'd with Rake and Prong  Prepar'd whilst he is here to make his Hay  Or if he turns his Back prepar'd to play  But here or gone sure of this Comfort still  Here's Company so they may chat their Fill  Ah were their Hands so active as their Tongues  How nimbly then would move the Rakes and Prongs  THE Grass again is spread upon the Ground  Till not a vacant Place is to be found  And while the parching Sunbeams on it shine  The Haymakers have Time allow'd to dine  That soon dispatch'd they still sit on the Ground  And the brisk Chat renew'd afresh goes round  All talk at once but seeming all to fear  That what they speak the rest will hardly hear  Till by degrees so high their Notes they strain  A Stander by can nought distinguish plain  So loud's their Speech and so confus'd their Noise  Scarce puzzled ECHO can return the Voice  Yet spite of this they bravely all go on  Each scorns to be or seem to be outdone  Meanwhile the changing Sky begins to lour  And hollow Winds proclaim a sudden Show'r  The tattling Crowd can scarce their Garments gain  Before descends the thick impetuous Rain  Their noisy Prattle all at once is done  And to the Hedge they soon for Shelter run  THUS have I seen on a bright Summer's Day  On some green Brake a Flock of Sparrows play  From Twig to Twig from Bush to Bush they fly  And with continu'd Chirping fill the Sky  But on a sudden if a Storm appears  Their chirping Noise no longer dins your Ears  They fly for Shelter to the thickest Bush  There silent sit and All at once is hush  BUT better Fate succeeds this rainy Day  And little Labour serves to make the Hay  Fast as 'tis cut so kindly shines the Sun  Turn'd once or twice the pleasing Work is done  Next Day the Cocks appear in equal Rows  Which the glad Master in safe Ricks bestows  THE spacious Fields we now no longer range  And yet hard Fate still Work for Work we change  Back to the Barns we hastily are sent  Where lately so much Time we pensive spent  Not pensive now we bless the friendly Shade  And to avoid the parching Sun are glad  Yet little Time we in the Shade remain  Before our Master calls us forth again  And says "For Harvest now yourselves prepare  " The ripen'd Harvést now demands your Care  " Get all things ready and be quickly drest  " Early next Morn I shall disturb your Rest"  Strict to his Word for scarce the Dawn appears  Before his hasty Summons fills our Ears  His hasty Summons we obey and rise  While yet the Stars are glimm'ring in the Skies  With him our Guide we to the Wheatfield go  He to appoint and we the Work to do  YE Reapers cast your Eyes around the Field  And view the various Scenes its Beauties yield  Then look again with a more tender Eye  To think how soon it must in Ruin lie  For once set in wheree'er our Blows we deal  There's no resisting of the wellwhet Steel  But here or there wheree'er our Course we bend  Sure Desolation does our Steps attend  THUS when  Arabia  's Sons in Hopes of Prey  To some more fertile Country take their Way  How beauteous all Things in the Morn appear  There rural Cots and pleasant Villa's here  So many grateful Objects meet the Sight  The ravish'd Eye could willing gaze till Night  But long ere then wheree'er their Troops have past  These pleasing Prospects lie a gloomy Waste  THE Morning past we sweat beneath the Sun  And but uneasily our Work goes on  Before us we perplexing Thistles find  And Corn blown adverse with the ruffling Wind  Behind our Master waits and if he spies  One charitable Ear he grudging cries  " Ye scatter half your Wages o'er the Land"  Then scrapes the Stubble with his greedy Hand  LET those who feast at Ease on dainty Fare  Pity the Reapers who their Feasts prepare  For Toils scarce ever ceasing press us now  Rest never does but on the Sabbath show  And barely that our Masters will allow  Think what a painful Life we daily lead  Each Morning early rise go late to Bed  Nor when asleep are we secure from Pain  We then perform our Labours o'er again  Our mimic Fancy ever restless seems  And what we act awake she acts in Dreams  Hard Fate Our Labours ev'n in Sleep don't cease  Scarce HERCULES e'er felt such Toils as these  BUT soon we rise the bearded Crop again  Soon PHOEBUS' Rays well dry the golden Grain  Pleas'd with the Scene our Master glows with Joy  Bids us for Carrying all our Force employ  When strait Confusion o'er the Field appears  And stunning Clamours fill the Workmens Ears  The Bells and clashing Whips alternate sound  And rattling Waggons thunder o'er the Ground  The Wheat when carry'd Pease and other Grain  We soon secure and leave a fruitless Plain  In noisy Triumph the last Load moves on  And loud Huzza's proclaim the Harvest done  OUR Master joyful at the pleasing Sight  Invites us all to feast with him at Night  A Table plentifully spread we find  And Jugs of humming Ale to chear the Mind  Which he too gen'rous pushes round so fast  We think no Toils to come nor mind the past  But the next Morning soon reveals the Cheat  When the same Toils we must again repeat  To the same Barns must back again return  To labour there for Room for next Year's Corn  THUS as the Year's revolving Course goes round  No Respite from our Labour can be found  Like SISYPHUS our Work is never done  Continually rolls back the restless Stone  Newgrowing Labours still succeed the past  And growing always new must always last  The SHUNAMMITE  To Mrs STANLEY  DEIGN heav'nly Muses to assist my Song  To heav'nly Muses heav'nly Themes belong  But chiefly Thou O GOD my Soul inspire  And touch my Lips with thy celestial Fire  If Thou delight'st in flow'ry  Carmel  's Shade  Or  Jordan  's Stream from thence I crave thy Aid  Instruct my Tongue and my low Accents raise  To sing thy Wonders and display thy Praise  Thy Praise let all the Sons of  Judah  hear  And to my Song the distant Tribes repair  So pray'd the  Shunammite  Heav'n heard the Dame  The distant Tribes around her list'ning came  To hear th'amazing Tale while thus her Tongue  Mov'd by some heav'nly Pow'r began the Song  ATTEND ye Seed of ABRAM and give Ear  While I JEHOVAH's glorious Acts declare  How Life from Death and Joy from Sadness spring  If He assist the Muse the Muse shall sing  My Lord and I to whom allbounteous Heav'n  His Blessings with no sparing Hand had giv'n  Like faithful Stewards of our wealthy Store  Still lodg'd the Stranger and reliev'd the Poor  And as ELISHA by divine Command  Came preaching Virtue to a sinful Land  He often deign'd to lodge within our Gate  And oft receiv'd an hospitable Treat  A decent Chamber for him we prepar'd  And he the gen'rous Labour to reward  Honours in Camp or Court to us propos'd  Which I refus'd and thus my Mind disclos'd  HEAV'N's King has plac'd us in a fertile Land  Where he show'rs down his Gifts with copious Hand  Already we enjoy an affluent Store  Why should we be solicitous for more  Give Martial Camps and Kingly Courts to them  Who place their only Bliss in fleeting Fame  There let them live in golden Chains of State  And be unhappy only to be great  But let us in our native Soil remain  Nor barter Happiness for sordid Gain  Here may we feed the Indigent in Peace  Or cloath the Bare with the superfluous Fleece  And give the weary fainting Pilgrim Ease  This we prefer to Pomp and formal Show  Which only serve to varnish o'er our Woe  Refulgent Ornaments which dress the Proud  Objects of Wonder to the gazing Crowd  Yet seldom give Content or solid Rest  To the vain Man by whom they are possess'd  ALL Blessings but a Child had Heav'n supply'd  And only that th'Almighty had deny'd  Which when the holy prescient Sage had heard  He said and I before him strait appear'd  And as my Feet approach'd his awful Room  I saw his Face diviner Looks assume  Not such a Wildness and fanatic Mien  With which some say the  Delphic  Priests are seen  When they for Mysteries of Fate explain  The odd Chimera's of a frantic Brain  But with a grave majestic Air he stood  While more than human in his Aspect glow'd  Celestial Grace sat on his radiant Look  And Pow'r diffusive shone before he spoke  Then thus "Hail gen'rous Soul Thy pious Cares  " Are not forgot nor fruitless are thy Pray'rs  " Propitious Heav'n thy virtuous Deeds to crown  " Shall make thy barren Womb conceive a Son"  So spake the Seer and to complete my Joy  As he had spoke I bore the promis'd Boy  SOON to my Friends the welcome News was known  Who crowded in apace to see my Son  Hailing with kind Salutes the recent Child  And with their pious Hymns my Pain beguil'd  When all had said I mov'd my joyful Tongue  And thus to Heav'n address'd my grateful Song  " O GOD what Eloquence can sing thy Praise  " Or who can fathom thy stupendous Ways  " All Things obey at thy divine Command  " Thou mak'st a fruitful Field of barren Land  " Obdurate Rocks a fertile Glebe shall be  " And bring forth copious Crops if bid by Thee  "  Arabian  Deserts shall with Plenty smile  " And curling Vines adorn the sterile Soil  As thus she spake her Audience raise their Voice  And interrupt her Song as they rejoice  " O GOD we gladly hear thy mighty Pow'r  " With joyful Heart thy gracious Name adore  " All Nature is subservient to thy Word  " And shifts her wonted Course to please her Lord  " We for thy Servant's Joy our Thanks express  " As grows the Child so may her Bliss increase  " And may the Guardian Angels who preside  " Over the Bless'd his future Actions guide  " Make spotless Virtue crown his vital Date  " And hoary Honour end his Life but late  " Then safely bear"The Dame here wav'd her Hand  The People straight obey her mute Command  All silent stand and all attentive look  Waiting her Words while thus she mournful spoke  ALL Pleasures are imperfect here below  Our sweetest Joys are mix'd with bitter Woe  The Draught of Bliss when in our Goblet cast  Is dash'd with Grief or spilt before we taste  Ere twice four Years were measur'd by my Son  So soon alas the greatest Blessing's gone  In Harvesttime he to the Reapers goes  To view the bearded Sheaves erect in Rows  Like an embattled Army in the Field  A new delightful Prospect to the Child  But either there the scorching Sun display'd  His Heat intense and on his Vitals prey'd  Or else some sudden apoplectic Pain  With racking Torture seiz'd his tender Brain  His Spirits fail'd he straight began to faint  And to his Father vainly made Complaint  The glowing Rose was quickly seen to fade  At once his Beauty and his Life decay'd  SOON at my House the dismal News I heard  Soon at my House the dying Child appear'd  T'embrace him I with fond Affection run  And O said I what Pain afflicts my Son  He try'd to speak but fault'ring gave a Groan  No perfect Word proceeded from his Tongue  But on his Lips the broken Accents hung  All Means I us'd that might allay his Pain  All Means I us'd but us'd them all in vain  Yet while he liv'd my Soul would not despair  Nor till he ceas'd to breathe I ceas'd my Pray'r  Deluding Hope now stopt the falling Tears  Now his increasing Pains increas'd my Fears  By Hope and Fear alternate was I toss'd  Till Hope in a sad Certainty was lost  Short and more short he drew his panting Breath  Too sure Presage of his approaching Death  Till soon the Blood congealing ceas'd to flow  He dropt his Head with a declining Bow  Thrice from my Breast to raise himself he try'd  And thrice sunk down again then groaning dy'd  THUS when with Care we've nurs'd a tender Vine  And taught the docile Branches where to twine  An Eastern Gale or some pernicious Frost  Nips the young Tree and all our Labour's lost  WITH Horror chill'd awhile I speechless stood  Viewing the Child and trembling as I view'd  My Eyes discharg'd their humid Store apace  And Tears succeeded Tears adown my Face  Scarcely my Heart the Load of Grief sustain'd  At length recov'ring Speech I thus complain'd  O fleeting Joys inconstant as the Wind  Which only for a Moment please the Mind  Then fly and leave a Weight of Woes behind  But yet in vain I thus lament and mourn  The Soul once fled shall never more return  And the fair Body now must be convey'd  To Earth's dark Bosom and eternal Shade  Yet let me not prescribe a Bound to Heav'n  'Twas by a Miracle the Child was giv'n  Nor can I think the Wonder is more great  Should the departed Soul resume her Seat  What if I to Mount  Carmel  haste away  To him who did his mystic Birth display  His pow'rful Word the barren fruitful made  His pow'rful Word perhaps may raise the Dead  The famous  Tishbite  rais'd a Widow's Son  ELISHA has as wond'rous Actions done  When he to  Jordan  's rapid Torrent came  And with the Mantle smote th'impetuous Stream  Obsequious to the Stroke the Waves divide  And raise a liquid Wall on either Side  At  Jericho  long had the barren Soil  Deceiv'd the Husbandman and mock'd his Toil  Yet at his Word it grew a fertile Field  And pois'nous Springs did wholsome Waters yield  Nor can he only such great Blessings send  But Curses if invok'd his Call attend  Else how at  Bethel  brought he Vengeance down  As a just Scourge on that opprobrious Town  Again when  Moab  Peace with  Israel  broke  And vainly strove to quit the servile Yoke  Our pow'rful Kings led forth th'embattled Host  Thro'  Edom  's sultry Wilds and Air adust  Where the confed'rate Troops no Water found  Dry were the Springs and sterile was the Ground  The Captains wonted Strength and Courage fail'd  When Thirst and Foes at once their Host assail'd  The Kings to him their joint Petitions made  And fainting Soldiers crav'd his timely Aid  Nor crav'd in vain The pow'rful Word he spake  And flowing Waters form'd a spacious Lake  The shining Streams advanc'd their humid Train  Till  Edom  's Wilds became a liquid Plain  Not in more Plenty did the Waters run  Out of the Rock when struck by AMRAM's Son  And who can that amazing Deed forget  Which he perform'd to pay the Widow's Debt  Whose Quantity of Oil one Pot contain'd  Yet num'rous Vessels fill'd before 'twas drain'd  Sure he who such stupendous Acts has done  If GOD propitious prove can raise my Son  So saying up I caught the Child with Speed  And laid him on the sacred Prophet's Bed  Then call'd my Servant to prepare the Steed  Pensive and sad my mourning Husband said  'Tis now in vain to crave ELISHA's Aid  No God Today the Prophet does inspire  Nor can he answer what thou wouldst inquire  RATHER than sink said I attempt to raise  My Hopes nor talk of Ceremonial Days  His God is present still and hears him when he prays  Thus said urging my Steed with eager Haste  Swift as a Mountain Roe the Plains I pass'd  O'er Hills and Dales my Journey I pursu'd  Nor slack'd my Pace till  Carmel  's Mount I view'd  On whose delightful Brow in cool Retreat  Among the curling Vines the Prophet sat  Whose twining Arms a verdant Arbour made  The verdant Arbour form'd a grateful Shade  The fanning Zephyrs gently play'd around  And shook the trembling Leaves and swept the Ground  Down humbly at his Feet I prostrate fell  Submiss and weeping told the mournful Tale  STRIVE to compose thy anxious Soul said he  Tears can't revoke JEHOVAH's fix'd Decree  We live and die and both as He thinks fit  Who may command but Mortals must submit  This Fate the King as well as Peasant finds  Nor is it evil but to evil Minds  Yet if from Heav'n I can my Suit obtain  Thy lifeless Son shall yet revive again  THUS said with Looks divine his Staff he views  As if some pow'rful Charm he would infuse  Then calls his Servant hastily and said  On the Child's Face let this be quickly laid  O Thou said I on whom my Hopes depend  Do not this Work to Servants Care commend  If Thou thyself with me refuse to go  Here to the list'ning Vines I'll vent my Woe  Still prostrate lie lamenting for my Son  Till ev'ry Hill prove vocal to my Moan  More had I said but Grief the Words supprest  Yet Sighs and silent Tears explain'd the rest  At length he from his verdant Seat arose  And hastily adown the Mountain goes  To  Shunem  we with Speed our Way pursue  The City soon appears within our View  And the obedient Servant at the Gate  Returning sad without Success we met  The beauteous Child by Death still vanquish'd lay  Still Death insulted o'er the beauteous Prey  Till to the House the sacred Seer was come  And with supernal Pow'r approach'd the Room  BY the dead Child awhile he pensive stood  Then from the Chamber put the mourning Crowd  That done to GOD he made his ardent Pray'r  And breath'd upon the Child with vital Air  And now the Soul resumes her pristine Seat  And now the Heart again begins to beat  Life's purple Current o'er the Body spreads  While Death repuls'd ingloriously recedes  THUS when a prowling Wolf has stol'n a Lamb  He sternly guards it from the bleating Dam  But if the Keeper comes he quits his Prey  And low'ring with Reluctance makes away  AND now the Prophet to my longing Arms  Resign'd the Child with more than wonted Charms  The blushing Rose shone fresher in his Face  And Beauty smil'd with a superior Grace  SO when Heav'n's Lamp that rules the genial Day  Behind the sable Moon pursues his Way  Affrighted Mortals when th'Eclipse is o'er  Believe him more illustrious than before  HERE ends the Dame and the promiscuous Throng  With Hallelujahs thus conclude the Song  " Holy and good art Thou Lord God of Host  " And all thy Works are wonderful and just  " Both Life and Death are in thy pow'rful Hand  " Both Life and Death obey thy great Command  " By thy great Pow'r the Heav'ns and Earth are aw'd  " Then let the Heav'ns and Earth adore their GOD  " Thou glorious Sun that measur'st all our Days  " Rising and setting still advance his Praise  " Thou Moon and ye less glitt'ring Orbs that dance  " Round this terrestrial Globe his Praise advance  " Ye Seas for ever waving to and fro  " Praise when ye ebb and praise him when ye flow  " Ye wand'ring Rivers and each purling Stream  " As ye pursue your Course his Praise proclaim  " Ye Dews and Mists and humid Vapours all  " Praise when ye rise and praise him when ye fall  " But chiefly  Israel  who dost daily view  " His pow'rful Works his daily Praise renew"  GRATITUDE  A PASTORAL  MENALCAS COLIN  MENALCAS  FRiend COLIN well o'ertook I have of late  Observ'd thy chearful Mien and airy Gait  Say what auspicious Change since t'other Day  When by thy lonely Cot I took my Way  Sorrow and Sadness then o'erspread thy Brows  And ev'ry Look did gloomy Cares disclose  Now Joys diffusive in thy Aspect rise  And Mirth and Gladness sparkle in thy Eyes  COLIN  WHERE hast thou liv'd MENALCAS not to know  Whose gen'rous Bounty has remov'd my Woe  I thought the gracious CAROLINA's Name  Ere this had fill'd the sounding Trump of Fame  MENALCAS  THAT gracious Name the World is bound to bless  All grateful Swains her gen'rous Deeds confess  But COLIN say has she remov'd thy Care  I'm happy when thy Happiness I hear  COLIN  O You MENALCAS know my abject Birth  Born in a Cot and bred to till the Earth  On rigid Worldlings always doom'd to wait  Forc'd at their frugal Hands my Bread to get  But when my Wants to CAROLINE were known  She bless'd me with a Pasture of my own  This makes new Pleasures in my Bosom glow  These joyful Looks I to her Bounty owe  MENALCAS  AND may kind Heav'n reward that gracious QUEEN  Who to thy Wants has so propitious been  Yet tho' her Bounty has thy Wants supply'd  Let not her Bounty e'er exalt thy Pride  But keep an humble Mind a grateful Heart  Her Favours far exceed thy own Desert  Heav'n mov'd the Goodness of the Royal Dame  And Heav'n and She thy Gratitude must claim  COLIN  WHEN me she first into her Favour took  I cut this oaken Staff 'tis now my Crook  And grav'd her Royal Bounty in the Rind  But grav'd it deeper in my grateful Mind  The Letters in the Staff may wear away  Those written in my Soul shall ne'er decay  MENALCAS  SO may thy little Flock increase their Tale  So may thy Field of Pasture never fail  May Heav'n and She in just Proportion still  Or smile or frown as thou art good or ill  COLIN  MAY hungry Foxes kill my tender Lambs  May pois'nous Serpents suck their bleating Dams  And may my Cows distended Udders fail  Elude my Hopes and never fill the Pail  In short to make my Curse the more complete  Tho' 'tis the only Thing I dread and hate  May Heav'n and Heav'nly CAROLINE remove  Their Smiles if COLIN e'er ungrateful prove  MENALCAS  THY Thanks and Pray'rs her gen'rous Soul will please  A Tribute justly due and paid with Ease  Sometimes a Song perhaps she may require  And thou to sing but lately didst aspire  When in an abject low laborious State  Sunk deep in Cares and press'd beneath their Weight  Then so at least 'tis said among our Swains  In Sonnets COLIN charm'd away his Pains  Much sooner now thou may'st a Song rehearse  Whene'er she condescends to hear thy Verse  COLIN  O Friend too well you know my simple Strains  Are far inferior to each rural Swain's  Yet since Great CAROLINA thinks no Scorn  To patronize a Shepherd meanly born  Henceforth I'll strive to raise my Voice sublime  And with her Royal Name adorn my Rhyme  I'll on each verdant Mountain sing her Praise  And vocal Groves shall echo to my Lays  To ev'ry Swain her Godlike Worth proclaim  Nor ever drop the pleasing glorious Theme  MENALCAS  THEN since we're met where friendly Branches spread  And trembling Leaves diffuse a cooling Shade  Since on the Sprays the Thrush and Finch rejoice  Invoke thy Muse and tune thy rural Voice  COLIN  ANOTHER Day my rural Voice I'll raise  Another Day the Muse shall tune her Lays  But now alas such crowding Joys I find  No Words can speak the Transports of my Mind  Would PHOEBUS warm me with poetic Fire  Or would the  Mantuan  Muse my Tongue inspire  As Great ELIZA shone in SPENCER's Line  The Greater CAROLINA should in mine  Then would I emulate the tuneful Throng  And with her glorious Name immortalize my Song  A PASTORAL ELEGY  AT first in Vales obscure the Lyre I strung  Vales where the Muse her annual Labours sung  Now leaving these she ranges o'er the Plains  And tunes her Voice to Flocks and Shepherd Swains  Yet fresh in Grief but feebly moves her Wings  Weeps while she flies and trembles as she sings  TWO Country Swains in Friendship firmly join'd  Lov'd each alike and were like Brothers kind  Great CAROLINE her Royal Bounty show'd  To one and rais'd him from the grov'ling Crowd  When straight his smiling Looks and chearful Mien  Proclaim'd the Goodness of a gracious QUEEN  But gloomy Sadness soon his Face possess'd  And clouded all the Joys before express'd  The other gay and pleasant still appear'd  Nor griev'd for Evils past nor future fear'd  One Day they met MENALCAS first began  And thus the mournful Tale alternate ran  MENALCAS  WHY COLIN dost thou wear that pensive Look  And sighing stand supported by thy Crook  Say from what Cause this Melancholy springs  Or dost thou verify what DAMON sings  " Vain Man can never satiate his Desires  " The more he has the more he still requires  " Today he's craving and Tomorrow cloy'd  " New Pleasures grow insipid when enjoy'd"  So when our Sheep on Hills refuse to feed  We straight remove them to the verdant Mead  Where all intent the luscious Herbage graze  And for that Day their Pasture seems to please  The next they range around the flow'ry Space  And bleating tell they loath the tainted Grass  COLIN  'TWAS Yesterday a giddy Sheep I view'd  Which rose in CUDDY's Fold and stagg'ring stood  While one with burly Horns secure from Pain  Ran enviously and push'd him down again  So you vain jesting Youth unmov'd with Care  Insult the hapless Swain that's in Despair  MENALCAS  I nor insulted nor intended Guile  And if I jested 'twas to make thee smile  But tell me Swain what wond'rous Turn of Fate  O'erclouds thy Face that look'd serene of late  What is thy Harvest blasted on the Ground  Or has the Royal CAROLINA frown'd  Unveil thy Griefs and make thy Sorrows known  You know my Friend's Misfortunes are my own  COLIN  MY Harvest is not blasted on the Ground  Nor has the Royal CAROLINA frown'd  But lately when the Sun had gaily drest  The lofty Mountains in a purple Vest  I early rose to tend my fleecy Care  Wet was the Grass and piercing cold the Air  My lovely SYLVIA stay behind I said  Till I have weav'd a Garland for thy Head  Till I a Bow'r with shady Branches form  To shun the scorching Ray or rapid Storm  And when the Dew's exhal'd which Night distill'd  Bless COLIN with thy Presence in the Field  She answer'd not but from her Bosom sent  A deep presaging Sigh before I went  The Sun had painted ev'ry Object gay  When to the chearful Field I took my Way  The Lark with Mattins welcom'd in the Morn  The Thrush and Finch sat chirping on the Thorn  The Swallows round in airy Circles flew  And ah poor COLIN then was joyful too  But suddenly I saw the Mists arise  And dark'ning Clouds o'erspread the dusky Skies  Th'Horizon seem'd to cast a gloomy Frown  While from his airy Height the Lark sunk down  The tuneful Birds their joyous Songs deny'd  And boding Owls and sooty Ravens cry'd  My drooping Heart which felt unusual Weight  Shock'd with such Omens ceas'd almost to beat  Yet these said I portend no Evil while  My Royal Mistress condescends to smile  If She's propitious what can COLIN fear  Inur'd the lesser Ills of Life to bear  Thus said I took my Way to yonder Grove  And form'd with spreading Boughs an arch'd Alcove  So close I twisted in each pliant Spray  As might exclude the Wind or sunny Ray  With sweetest Flow'rs I deck'd the mossy Ground  And strew'd the fragrant Woodbinds all around  Here when said I my SYLVIA comes afield  This grateful Bow'r a safe Retreat shall yield  If rainy here she may the Storms evade  If fair the Branches will project a Shade  Here SYLVIA shall with COLIN take her Rest  And COLIN here with SYLVIA shall be blest  As thus I spake around I cast my Eye  And saw celestial CELIA drawing nigh  I saw but wonder'd why her heav'nly Mien  Was clouded o'er that us'd to be serene  CELIA's the Mistress of the flow'ry Plain  Whose Bounty's known to ev'ry worthy Swain  Not Godlike PAN presided with more Care  Nor to  Arcadian  Shepherds was so dear  When CELIA to the rural Shade retires  She ev'ry Breast with rising Hope inspires  Expecting Swains with joyous Looks proclaim  The happy Time and hail the gen'rous Dame  As languid Plants which half the Year lie dead  When Spring approaches raise their drooping Head  She cross'd the Plains with a dejected Air  Her pensive Aspect shew'd her pious Care  And loath th'unwelcome Tidings to reveal  She sighing spoke and left th'unfinish'd Tale  " Ah poor unhappy Swain return return  " The sable Clouds foretel a rainy Morn  " Nor only is the Day o'ercast with Gloom  " Thy pleasing Hopes are blasted all at home  " Thy SYLVIA O" She said and dropt the rest  But my presaging Heart too rightly guess'd  I silent stood and spoke my Grief with Tears  You know my Heart was firmly link'd to hers  MENALCAS  I know your Hearts are link'd in Friendship fast  Long may that mutual Bond of Friendship last  May HYMEN to you both propitious prove  And Death but late untie the Knot of Love  COLIN  O stop MENALCAS and my Loss deplore  The good the faithful SYLVIA is no more  That gloomy Morn she in my Absence dy'd  And rigid Death the last Farewel deny'd  Another Loss I could content have born  But must the Loss of SYLVIA always mourn  My lovely SYLVIA was my softest Theme  My Song by Day by Night my pleasing Dream  But now in Sighs I spend the ling'ring Day  And weeping pass the tardy Night away  Nor does thy Friend indulge a needless Care  My Loss is great and just is my Despair  MENALCAS  THY Loss and Sorrows equally are great  But Death's the Law of Nature fix'd by Fate  Our Flocks our Herds our All precarious stands  And fall we must when Heav'n our Fall commands  COLIN  YET Flocks and Herds are with Reluctance spar'd  And what are Flocks and Herds with her compar'd  A hungry Fox stole ten of CUDDY's Lambs  A lurching Mongrel kill'd their bleating Dams  Say did not CUDDY for his Loss repine  But ah what Loss was his compar'd with mine  MENALCAS  I have a Flute which DAMON lately made  No Shepherd on a sweeter ever play'd  I tun'd it Yesterday and straight a Throng  Of Nymphs and Swains ran crowding to my Song  My list'ning Ewes awhile forsook their Meat  My tender Lambs tho' hungry ceas'd to bleat  I'll tune again the soft harmonious Lay  Music perhaps may chase thy Cares away  COLIN  MENALCAS Music's for a lighter Ill  Such Woes as mine would baffle all thy Skill  Upon his Flute ALEXIS often plays  And strives to charm my Sorrows with his Lays  Upon his Flute ALEXIS plays in vain  His Lays tho' charming cannot charm my Pain  The tuneful Birds rejoice on ev'ry Spray  My wanton Lambkins in their Pasture play  In vain the tuneful Birds rejoice in vain  My wanton Lambkins sport upon the Plain  WITH chearful Green the spacious Fields are crown'd  And beauteous Flow'rs adorn the painted Ground  The snowy Blossoms on the Branches shine  A pleasing Scene to ev'ry Eye but mine  For neither chearful Green that crowns the Field  Nor snowy Blossoms which the Branches yield  Nor Flow'rs that spread the painted Meadows o'er  Delight my Eyes now SYLVIA is no more  MENALCAS  'TIS more than Time thy mournful Dirge to end  For see the whistling Ploughmen homeward tend  Our fleecy Flocks stand waiting round the Fold  Damp feel the Dews the ruffling Breezes cold  The setting Sun forsakes the blushing Skies  And hazy Fogs from marshy Grounds arise  Then fold thy Sheep thy anxious Cares remove  Nor weep on Earth for her who sings above  On a GOOD CONSCIENCE  THE solid Joys of human Kind  Are those that flow from Peace of Mind  For who the Sweets of Life can taste  With Vice and tim'rous Guilt opprest  'Tis Virtue softens all our Toils  With Peace our Conscience crowns  Gives Pleasure when our Fortune smiles  And Courage when it srowns  Calms ev'ry Trouble makes the Soul serene  Smooths the contracted Brow and chears the Heart within  WHILE guilty Minds involv'd with Woe  Anticipate the future Blow  Which is to make Damnation more complete  The lesser Hell in Passage to the great  Bold and intrepid honest Men appear  For as they know no Evil none they fear  A glorious Shield of Virtue guards their Breast  Arm'd with themselves they always walk at Rest  THUS under bursting Clouds and stormy Skies  When Thunder roars and Lightning flies  Th'Imperial Eagles boldly rove  Nor dread the firy Bolt of JOVE  While meaner Birds in secret creep below  And trembling fear and often feel the Blow  On MUSIC  I  MUSIC the coldest Heart can warm  The hardest melt the fiercest charm  Disarm the Savage of his Rage  Dispel our Cares and Pains assuage  With Joy it can our Souls inspire  And tune our Tempers to the Lyre  Our Passions like the Notes agree  And stand subdu'd by Harmony  This found the  melancholy King    When DAVID tun'd the trembling String  Sweet MUSIC chas'd the sullen Spleen away  And made his clouded Soul serenely gay  II  WHILE MUSIC breathes in Martial Airs  The Coward durst forget his Fears  Or if the Notes to Pity sound  Revenge and Envy cease to wound  The Pow'r of MUSIC has been known  To raise or tumble Cities down  Thus  Theban  Turrets Authors say  Were rais'd by MUSIC's magic Lay  And ancient  Jericho  's Heav'nhated Wall  To sacred MUSIC ow'd its destin'd Fall  III  NOR Mortals only MUSIC love  It chears celestial Saints above  Sweet Hallelujahs Angels sing  Around their great Ethereal KING  Ceasless they sound the FATHER's Praise  The FATHER too approves their Lays  For HE as all Things MUSIC made  And SERAPHIMS before Him play'd  When over  Horeb  's Mount He came  Array'd in Majesty and Flame  After the sounding Trump sublime He rode  The sounding Trump proclaim'd th'approaching GOD  IV  MUSIC had Being long before  The solemn Organ learnt to roar  When MICHAEL o'er the heav'nly Plain  Advanc'd to fight the rebel Train  Loud Trumpets did his Wrath declare  In MUSIC terrible to hear  And when the Universe was made  On golden Harps the Angels play'd  And when it falls as fall it must  MUSIC shall penetrate the Dust  The Trump shall sound with the Archangel's Breath  And sweetly dreadful wake the Dead from Death  On RICHMOND PARK and ROYAL GARDENS  OF blissful Groves I sing and flow'ry Plains  Ye Sylvan Nymphs assist my rural Strains  Shall  Windsor  Forest gain a deathless Fame  And grow immortal as the Poet's Name  While not a Bard of all the tuneful Throng  With these delightful Fields adorns his  This was writ in the Year since when great Alterations and Improvements have been made in the Gardens and several Poems publish'd on the same Subject  Song  Thy Gardens  Richmond  boast an equal Theme  And only ask an equal Muse's Flame  What tho' no Virgin Nymphs of CYNTHIA's Train  With Belt and Quiver grace the verdant Plain  What tho' no fabled consecrated Floods  Flow o'er thy Fields or murmur thro' thy Woods  My Song thy real Beauties shall pursue  And paint the lovely Scenes and paint 'em true  A pleasing Task Nor slight shall be the Praise  If Royal CAROLINE accept the Lays  DELIGHTED often thro' the mazy Groves  The Muse in pensive Contemplation roves  Or climbs the slow ascending  Richmond  Hill  Hill whose Brow  Hangs o'er the silver Stream which rolls below  Where all around me shining Prospects rise  And various Scenes invite my gazing Eyes  And while I view one Object with Delight  New pleasing Wonders charm the feasted Sight  Now this allures now that attracts it most  And the first Beauty's in the second lost  THUS in a grateful Concert may we hear  The Sounds at once surprize and charm our Ear  The trembling Notes in hasty Fugues arise  And this advances ere the former flies  All seem to be confus'd yet all agree  To perfect the melodious Harmony  BENEATH the Mount with what Majestic Pride  The Sire of Rivers rolls his silver Tide  Let Poets sing of  Hermus  ' golden Shore  His amber Foam and Sands of shining Ore  Nor  Tagus  envy we nor fruitful  Nile    Whose fatt'ning Floods enrich the thirsty Soil  Happy BRITANNIA boasts as fair a Stream  As great in Bounties and as great in Fame  Since DENHAM's deathless Muse has sung his Tide  And  India  's Riches o'er his Surface glide  OBSEQUIOUS River when my Eyes survey  Thy Waves or East or West pursue their Way  Now swiftly roll to meet the briny Main  At stated Periods now return again  How vain the Schemes of Infidels appear  How weak their Reas'nings and the GOD how clear  Say Atheists since you own by Nature's Laws  There's no Effect produc'd without a Cause  Why should the restless Stream run to and fro  And with alternate Motion ebb and flow  Did not some Being of superior Force  Rule the wild Waves and regulate their Course  HENCE lofty  Windsor  to the Sight appears  And high in Air her pompous Turrets rears  Wide round her Domes the spacious Forest shines  Tho' brighter much in POPE's harmonious Lines  O would his tuneful Muse my Breast inspire  With equal Warmth with her sublimer Fire  Then  Richmond  Hill renown'd in Verse should grow  And  Thames  reecho to the Song below  A second  Eden  in my Page should shine  And MILTON's  Paradise  submit to mine  OFT lost in Thought forgetful of my Way  I o'er the Park thro' Wilds of Beauty stray  Where sportive Nature wantons at her Will  And lavishes her Bloom uncheck'd by Skill  Old venerable Trees majestic rise  Sublime in Air and brave the vaulted Skies  Which free from cruel Steel or Lab'rer's Hand  In peaceful Age and hoary Honour stand  Here when AURORA first begins to dawn  The wakeful Larks spring mounting from the Lawn  Pois'd by their Plumes in lofty Flights they play  With joyful Warblings hail th'approaching Day  But when the Sun displays a purple Scene  And drinks the pearly Dew that deck'd the Green  A thousand tuneful Birds in Concert meet  A thousand tuneful Notes the Groves repeat  And when their Music ceases with the Day  Sweet PHILOMELA chants her pensive Lay  BUT hark I hear a louder Music sound  From Woods and Vales the various Notes rebound  'Tis  Albion  's KING pursues the Royal Chace  The nimble Stag skims o'er th'unbending Grass  The Way which Fear directs he trembling tries  Nor knows where Fear directs or where he flies  A hundred diff'rent Sounds assail his Ears  A Death in ev'ry diff'rent Sound he fears  And now he faintly moves a slower Pace  And closer now the Hounds pursue the Chace  Till in Despair back on his Foes he turns  Makes feeble Efforts with his branchy Horns  Short is the Combat soon he yields his Breath  And gasping falls and trembling pants in Death  Now to a softer Theme descends my Muse  Thro' artful Walks her pleasing Path pursues  Where lofty Elms and conic Lindens rise  Or where th'extensive Terras charms her Eyes  Where Elegance and noble Grandeur meet  As the Ideas of its Mistress great  Magnificently fair majestically sweet  See on its Margin Fields of waving Corn  These bearded Crops and Flow'rets this adorn  CERES and FLORA lovingly embrace  And gay Varieties the Landscape grace  HENCE lead me Muses thro' yon arched Grove  Adorn'd with Sand below and Leaves above  Or let me o'er the spacious Oval trace  Where verdant Carpets spread the lovely Place  Where Trees in regular Confusion stand  And sylvan Beauties rise on ev'ry Hand  Or bear me Nymphs to the sequester'd Cell  Where BOYLE and NEWTON mighty Sages dwell  Whose Fame shall live altho' the Grot decay  Long as those sacred Truths their Works display  HOW sweetly pleasing is this cool Retreat  When PHOEBUS blazes with meridian Heat  In vain the fervid Beams around it play  The rocky Roof repels the scorching Ray  Securely guarded with a sylvan Scene  In Nature's Liv'ry drest for ever green  TO visit  this  the curious Stranger roves  With grateful Travel thro' a Wild of Groves  And tho' directed oft mistakes his Way  Unknowing where the winding Mazes stray  Yet still his Feet the magic Paths pursue  Charm'd tho' bewilder'd with the pleasing View  NOT so attractive lately shone the Plain  A gloomy Waste not worth the Muses Strain  Where thorny Brakes the Traveller repell'd  And Weeds and Thistles overspread the Field  Till Royal GEORGE and Heav'nly CAROLINE  Bid Nature in harmonious Lustre shine  The sacred  Fiat  thro' the Chaos rung  And Symmetry from wild Disorder sprung  SO once confus'd the barb'rous Nations stood  Unpolish'd were their Minds their Manners rude  Till  Rome  her conqu'ring Eagles wide display'd  And bid the World reformThe World obey'd  HOW bless'd the Man in these delightful Fields  New Pleasures each indulgent Moment yields  Let gayer Minds in Town pursue their Joys  Exchanging Quietness for Crowds and Noise  Consume the Night at Masquerade or Play  Or waste in busy Idleness the Day  I envy not  Augusta  's pompous Piles  Since rural Solitude more pleasing smiles  O Solitude the Sage's chief Delight  What Numbers can thy lovely Charms recite  Hail peaceful Nymph thou eldest Thing on Earth  Nay like Eternity thou hadst no Birth  The Heav'ns alone can thy Commencement tell  Ere MICHAEL fought or peccant Angels fell  Before the Skies with radiant Light were clad  In awful Gloom and venerable Shade  The FATHER thee his sole Companion made  When to Creation first his Thoughts inclin'd  And future Worlds were rising in his Mind  He sat with thee and plann'd the mighty Scheme  With thee adjusted the stupendous Frame  Contriv'd how Globes selfbalanc'd in the Air  With restless Rounds should rule the circling Year  How Orbs o'er Orbs in mystic Dance should roll  What Laws support and regulate the Whole  Nor art thou yet impair'd celestial Dame  Thy Charms are still attractive still the same  With thee the Mind abstracted from the Crew  May study Nature and her Ends pursue  With thee I hear the feather'd Warblers sing  With thee survey the Beauties of the Spring  When Blossoms Leaves and Fruits the Branches yield  And  Eden  's Glory crowns the happy Field  HERE first the Muse auspicious was the Place  Rejoic'd to see her Royal Guardian's Face  How mild yet how majestic was her Look  How sweetly condescending all she spoke  On ev'ry pleasing Accent Wisdom hung  And Truth and Virtue dwelt upon her Tongue  O were I equal to the glorious Theme  Then should my Lays immortalize her Fame  Or paint Great GEORGE in peaceful Laurels drest  With  Albion  's Safety lab'ring in his Breast  Who while contending Nations round him jar  And Subjects Wealth supports their Monarchs War  Guards happy  Britain  with his floating Tow'rs  From purple Slaughter and invading Pow'rs  No plund'ring Armies rob our fruitful Plain  But bless'd with Peace and Plenty smiles the Swain  NOT so he smiles upon the foreign Shores  But starving walks thro' Nature's lavish Stores  Poor Peasants with their rigid Burdens groan  And Till the Glebe for Harvests not their own  What tho' their more propitious PHOEBUS shines  With warmer Rays and chears the curling Vines  What tho' rich Olives grace the fertile Soil  And the hot Climate teems with fatt'ning Oil  The hungry Farmer views his Crops in vain  In vain the Vineyard tempts the thirsty Swain  While their stern Tyrant's arbitrary Pow'r  Rifles the Plains and ravages their Store  Thy Sons BRITANNIA from such Evils free  Enjoy the Sweets of Peace and Liberty  A gracious Sov'reign smiles upon the Throne  And Heav'n confirms the happy Realm his own  AVARO and AMANDA  A POEM in FOUR CANTO's Taken from the  Spectator  Vol I N  o  xi  CANTO I  WHAT Ills from Want of Education flow  From Avarice what cruel Scenes of Woe  I mean to sing except the tuneful Maid  Neglect my Numbers and refuse her Aid  Say Goddess first what made the Youth explore  A foreign Clime and quit his native Shore  Say too how on the barb'rous Isle he came  What mov'd the Kindness of the  Negro  Dame  What could provoke a faithless Youth to sell  A Friend whose only Crime was loving well  NOW had AVARO twenty Winters pass'd  His blooming Features ev'ry Beauty grac'd  In silver Rings his loosely flowing Hair  Hung o'er his Shoulders with a comely Air  Robust his Limbs and daring was his Soul  And Vigour crown'd the wellproportion'd Whole  His graceful Charms the Ladies oft survey'd  And oft their Eyes an am'rous Signal made  But never could the tender Passion move  The stubborn Youth was still averse to Love  Yet tho' his Breast was Proof to CUPID's Dart  A more ignoble God enslav'd his Heart  NO Mysteries of Faith disturb'd his Head  For Mysteries of Faith he seldom read  That moral Law which Nature had imprest  He blotted from the Volume of his Breast  Yet in his Mind his Father's Precepts bears  Who often rung this Lesson in his Ears  " Would you my Son to Happiness aspire  " Know  Gold  alone can Happiness acquire  " He that has Gold is pow'rful as a King  " Has Valour Virtue Wisdom ev'ry thing  "  This  to obtain your utmost Skill bestow  " And if you gain it be not careful how  " If in the Court or Camp you take Delight  " Then dare to flatter  there  or  here  to fight  " Or should the Merchant's Life your Fancy please  " Be bold and bravely venture on the Seas  " Many by Merchandize have gain'd Renown  " And made the  Indies  Wealth become their own"  The Youth imbib'd the Precepts of his Tongue  Neglecting ev'ry Law of Right and Wrong  Taught by his Sire to court destructive Gain  He burns to try his Fortune on the Main  WHILE other Youths by Wit or Pleasure sway'd  Frequent the Play the Ball or Masquerade  AVARO studious in his Chamber stays  Careless of Balls of Masquerades and Plays  There adds subtracts and with unweary'd Pain  Learns all the Rules of Int'rest Loss and Gain  NEXT from an old Astronomer he tries  To learn the Planets Journey thro' the Skies  With  him  at Night when Heav'n serene appears  He points the Quadrant at the shining Spheres  The HYADES and frozen Pole surveys  Which guide the Sailor o'er the distant Seas  Then Maps and Models of our Globe prepares  And carefully inspects both Hemispheres  From East to West he views the spacious Round  Pleas'd with the modern World COLUMBUS found  In Hope elate the Youth impatient stands  And seems to grasp both  Indies  in his Hands  This sees the Sire and hastily provides  A Vessel proof against the Wind and Tides  The Youth embarks the soft propitious Gales  Arise and soon expand the swelling Sails  The Ship glides swiftly o'er the liquid Plain  And NEPTUNE smiles and courts him on the Main  BUT see how Mortals are the Sport of Fate  How oft unhappy striving to be great  Ere CYNTHIA twice her monthly Race had run  An Omen of the fatal Storm begun  The murm'ring Wind arises by degrees  And rocks the Ship and sweeps the curling Seas  Now louder with impetuous Force it roars  And shoves the swelling Surges to the Shores  Till rapid Rain and Flakes of bick'ring Flame  With dreadful Thunder vex th'ethereal Frame  Struck with Surprize the tim'rous Merchant stands  Nor knows what he forbids or what commands  Nor safely back nor can he forwards go  But trembling waits and fears the fatal Blow  LONG time the Sailers work against the Wind  With fruitless Toil to gain the Port assign'd  Till Courage Hope and all Provisions fail'd  And Fear Despair and Want their Souls assail'd  Forc'd by the Storm into a winding Bay  Their joyful Eyes an  Indian  Isle survey  When straight they quit their Ship and gain the Shore  And for Recruits the Savage Land explore  ADJOINING to the dreary Beach there stood  Wild Shrubs and Trees that form'd a gloomy Wood  Where close obscur'd the crafty Natives lay  And watch'd the wand'ring Crew remote from Sea  Then forth they rush and strait their Bows prepare  Too late the Sailers see th'approaching War  In vain the Brave engage or Tim'rous fly  The Tim'rous and the Brave promiscuous die  The barb'rous Fields are stain'd with purple Gore  And dreadful Groanings echo to the Shore  Our youthful Merchant 'scapes and flies alone  His Fear impels and Safety prompts him on  Thro' dusky Woods he takes his trembling Flight  The dusky Woods conceal him from their Sight  Till in the devious Wilds remote from Foes  Then on the Ground he weeping vents his Woes  Oft curs'd his hapless Fate and often thought  On what the hoary Starmonger had taught  How at our Birth as diff'rent Planets rule  They form a Wit or constitute a Fool  How in the Maze of Life we act as they  Attract retard or force us in the Way  And as he these uncertain Censures made  Against the Stars he thus exclaiming said  THE Planets sure some noxious Pow'r display  And rule my Life with arbitrary Sway  Else had I ne'er forsook my native Home  Nor in this baleful Desert met my Doom  And yet when I reflect I cannot see  How Globes insensible should influence me  I chuse my Actions when the Choice is made  I nor invoke nor yet consult  their  Aid  When Mortals act according to their  Will    Can Heav'n be call'd the Author of their Ill  Too late I find the Stars are not in Fault  But 'tis that golden Wish my Sire has taught  Enticing  Gold  that damn'd deceiving Guide  Induc'd me first to stem the foaming Tide  Fallacious  Charm  that led me from Repose  Now leaves me in a Labyrinth of Woes  SO when compacted Vapours in the Night  Skim o'er the Fields with a delusive Light  The injudicious Traveller surveys  Th'alluring  Scene  and courts the glist'ring Blaze  Till tempted o'er a Rock's impending Brow  He falls to some tremendous Gulph below  THUS the unhappy Youth laments his Fate  Conscious of all the Ills that round him wait  Till setting PHOEBUS leaves the blushing Sky  And glimm'ring Stars a feeble Light supply  The Shades of Night increase his anxious Care  And add a greater Horror to Despair  CANTO II  ALL Night in Tears the pensive Merchant lay  And often wish'd and fear'd the coming Day  Till on the Hills the rising Sun display'd  His golden Beams and chas'd away the Shade  Harmonious Birds salute his chearful Rays  And hail the rosy Morn with joyful Lays  While stretch'd upon the Ground AVARO moans  Answ'ring their tuneful Songs with piercing Groans  NOT distant far from where the Youth was laid  A purling Stream in pleasing Murmurs play'd  And by the Margin of the crystal Flood  Two Rows of Trees in beautcous Order stood  Whose Branches form'd a pendent Arch above  Diffusing gloomy Verdure o'er the Grove  An  Indian  Princess hither daily came  Pleas'd with the grateful Shade and cooling Stream  She now was walking to her lov'd Retreat  And heard the mourning Youth lament his Fate  Fix'd in Amaze awhile she list'ning stood  Then swift approach'd him rushing thro' the Wood  Th' affrighted Merchant rose with gazing Eyes  And tim'rous Looks that testify'd Surprize  Backward he starts the Dame with equal Fears  Recedes as fast and wonders what appears  Yet bolder grown she soon advanc'd again  Smit with the Beauty of the godlike Man  His Dress and fair Complexion charm'd her Sight  Each glowing Feature gave her new Delight  While Love and Pity both arose within  And kindled in her Soul a Flame unseen  With equal Joy AVARO now survey'd  The native Graces of the  Negro  Maid  He view'd her Arms with various Ribbands bound  Her downy Head with painted Feathers crown'd  With Bredes and lucid Shells in Circles strung  Which shone refulgent as they round her hung  AS when in splendid Robes a courtly Maid  Begins the Dance at Ball or Masquerade  The Pearls and Di'monds shine with mingled Light  And glitt'ring Pendants blaze against the Sight  SO shone the beauteous Shells around her Waist  And sparkling Gems that deck'd her jetty Breast  All which AVARO's gazing Eyes pursue  Charm'd with her lovely Shape disclos'd to View  Each Limb appears in just Proportion made  With Elegance thro' ev'ry Part display'd  And now his Cares dissolve new Passions move  And Nature intimates the Change is LOVE  NOT far remote a cooling Grot was made  In which the Virgin often sought a Shade  Thick Shrubs and fruitful Vines around it grew  And none except herself the Mansion knew  To this obscure  Recess  the Royal Dame  Rejoicing with her lovely Captive came  Then from the Branches with officious Haste  She plucks the Fruits which yield a sweet Repast  That done she with her Bow explores the Wood  Pierc'd with her Shaft the Fowl resigns his Blood  Then back she hastens to her cool Retreat  And for AVARO dress'd the grateful Meat  To slake his Thirst she next directs his Way  Where crystal Streams in wild Meanders stray  Nor lets him there expos'd to Foes remain  But to the Cave conducts him safe again  SO doats AMANDA on the Merchant while  She scorns the  Lovers  of her  native Isle  For all the Heroes of her Country strove  With Emulation to attract her Love  And when they could the painted Fowls insnare  Or pierce the savage Beast in sylvan War  The Skins and Feathers Trophies of their Fame  They gave for Presents to the Royal Dame  All which she to her lov'd AVARO brought  And with them gaily deck'd his shining Grot  The spotted Panther here she hung and there  With Paws extended frown'd the shaggy Bear  Here gaudy Plumes appear in Lustre bright  There Shells and Pearls diffuse a sparkling Light  AS when to grace some Royal Prince's Hall  The skilful Painter animates the Wall  Here warlike Heroes frown in Martial Arms  There a soft Nymph displays her blushing Charms  A pleasing Landscape next invites our Eye  And the Room glows with sweet Variety  YET still to give her Lover more Delight  Lest what he daily saw should pall the Sight  When SOL with Purple cloath'd the Western Sky  And Shades extended shew'd the Ev'ning nigh  She to some verdant Grove the Youth convey'd  Where Nightingales harmonious Music made  Soft Flow'rets were their Couch and all around  Diffusive Sweets perfum'd the fragrant Ground  There oft she would his snowy Bosom bare  Oft round her Fingers wind his silver Hair  Charm'd with the Contrast which their Colours made  More pleasing than the Tulip's Light and Shade  Nor was the Youth insensible but soon  Repaid her Love by shewing of his own  Oft would his Bosom heave with speaking Sighs  Oft would he gaze and languish with his Eyes  Now on her panting Breast his Head repose  To meet his Head her panting Breast arose  While in her Soul ecstatic Raptures glow'd  And her fond Arms believ'd they clasp'd a God  SO liv'd the happy Pair observ'd by none  Till both had learnt a Language of their own  In which the Youth one Ev'ning in the Shade  Beguiles the harmless unsuspicious Maid  Leans on her Breast and with a Kiss betrays  Then vents his specious Fraud in Words like these  WITNESS ye Gods and all ye Blest above  For Ye can witness best how well I love  If e'er among our blooming Nymphs I knew  Such Pleasures as my Soul receives from you  O dear AMANDA could I but with thee  Once more my happy native Country see  You should not there in lonely Caves retreat  Nor trace the burning Sands with naked Feet  Your Limbs which now the Sun and Wind invade  Should neatly be in softest Silks array'd  In gilded Houses gaily should you ride  By Horses drawn which prancing Side by Side  Neigh foam and champ the Bit with graceful Pride  Our Time in Pomp and Peace should slide away  And blooming Pleasures crown the smiling Day  And when the setting Sun forsook the Skies  Approaching Night should but increase our Joys  We would not on the chilling Ground embrace  Nor Foes as now should interrupt our Peace  But both reposing on some easy Bed  Soft as the fleecy Down that decks thy Head  The sportive God of Love should round us play  While we in Raptures pass'd the Night away  Then let us carefully my Dear explore  The Haven where I first approach'd the Shore  Perhaps we shall some floating Ship survey  Safe to conduct us o'er the watry Way  Nor let the foaming Waves your Steps retard  I'll guard you o'er and be a faithful Guard  How oft alas is Innocence betray'd  When Love invites and Flatterers persuade  How could the Dame a Stranger to Deceit  Imagine such a heav'nly Form a Cheat  She paus'd she sigh'd then with a pensive Look  Half loth and half consenting thus she spoke  ONCE has AVARO scap'd the raging Main  Why would you tempt the fickle Seas again  To seek new Dangers when in Safety here  Would but provoke the Deities you fear  Sometimes I own we've been surpriz'd by Foes  Whose nightly Walks have wak'd you from Repose  Yet still I guard your sacred Life secure  And always willWhat can AMANDA more  THUS said she clasp'd him in her loving Arms  Embrac'd his Neck and doated on his Charms  And now both shew their Passions in their Look  And now Connubial HYMEN both invoke  In sportive Joys they clos'd the genial Day  While PHILOMELA sung the Nuptial Lay  Till soon the Youth reclin'd upon her Breast  And golden Slumbers seal'd their Eyes to Rest  CANTO III  SOON as the Sun began to gild the Day  And on the Hills emit a trembling Ray  AMANDA from her flow'ry Bed awoke  Sad was her Heart and discompos'd her Look  The briny Torrent flows adown her Cheeks  While thus she to her dear AVARO speaks  O Thou on whom my Life and Love depend  If e'er AMANDA claim'd the Name of Friend  If e'er I gave thy troubled Mind Repose  Or hid thee when pursu'd with furious Foes  Explain this  Dream  that terrifies my Breast  The strangest Fear or Fancy e'er imprest  METHOUGHT a God descended from the Skies  Celestial Beauty sparkled in his Eyes  Like Rays of PHOEBUS shone his radiant Hair  His Shape like thine like thine his graceful Air  A Robe was neatly girt about his Waist  Fine as my lov'd AVARO's silken Vest  His shining Lips upon my Breast he laid  And softly press'd my Hand and smiling said  " ARISE my Dear my lov'd AMANDA rise  " An easier Lodging waits thee in the Skies  " I am descended from the blest Abodes  " To bear thee hence to Heav'n among the Gods  " No Enemies shall there disturb thy Rest  " There with thy  Lover  live for ever blest"  THUS said he rais'd me from the dewy Plain  And bore or seem'd to bear me o'er the Main  But soon he led me to a distant Isle  Where Horrors reign and Comforts never smile  Thick Brakes and Brambles choak'd the dreary Coast  The only Product which the Land could boast  Till a dejected servile Race arose  With gloomy Sadness brooding on their Brows  This Crowd promiscuous with incessant Toil  Or rooted up the Wood or plough'd the Soil  How each perform'd his Task a Tyrant view'd  And sternly shook his Whip and menac'd as he stood  Sometimes to shun the direful Lash they fled  Th'insulting Lord pursu'd with greater Speed  Sure not so fearful fly the trembling Bears  To shun our Hunters Darts and missive Spears  Sure not so swift our Hunters e'er pursu'd  The trembling Bears when flying thro' the Wood  As from the Tyrant's Wrath they swiftly run  Or as the Tyrant swifter urg'd 'em on  Each to his wonted Task he drove again  And made  me  mix among the servile Train  Doom'd with the rest to groan beneath the Yoke  Alike I felt the dire correcting Stroke  But O what added most to my Despair  My Godlike Guide was false and left me there  As thus she spake confus'd her Looks appear'd  For still her Soul the dreadful Vision fear'd  Deciding Reason from her Seat withdrew  And Fancy painted all the Scene anew  The Youth to chear the drooping Dame essay'd  When straight a Boar came rushing thro' the Shade  The crashing Woods proclaim'd his rapid Force  While two fleet Youths pursu'd the sylvan Course  The Lovers started from their flow'ry Seats  Surpriz'd and each a diff'rent Way retreats  As when some Musquet's Thunder has expell'd  Two loving Turtles from the verdant Field  Both diverse thro' the wide ethereal Plain  Fly swift and flying fear their Mate is slain  So parting devious fled th'affrighted Pair  Such was AVARO's such AMANDA's Fear  The foaming Boar between 'em swiftly past  The nimble Coursers urge the Chace as fast  Till soon they pierce him with a mortal Wound  He falls and purple Gore distains the Ground  Then from the savage War they take their Way  And to their Cave triumphant bear the Prey  SOON as the sportive Hunters left the Wood  The loving Pair conceal'd no longer stood  But trembling both forsook the dusky Shade  Both trembling met upon the op'ning Glade  Mute with Surprize awhile they stood the Man  Broke Silence first and thus his Tale began  O dear AMANDA soon we have survey'd  This mystic Vision of the Night display'd  These are the frowning Tyrants in thy Dream  That chas'd the Slaves and we their flying Game  SOME Part said she resembled this I own  And some remains a Riddle yet unknown  What meant that God which still methinks I view  That radiant Deity so much like You  And what the Fields above which he propos'd  Say if the Mystery can be disclos'd  To whom the Youth Our active Fancy seems  For ever roving roving most in Dreams  For then the Soul disburden'd of her Load  Soars high and grows prophetic like a God  Minds Things when past as present to our View  And by Allusion knows the future too  Thus when to Sleep your musing Head reclin'd  She kept our Ev'ning Converse in her Mind  Reflected on the Joys my Country yields  Joys sweet as those in yonder azure Fields  Till soaring higher striving to discern  Her hidden Fate and future Fortune learn  Heav'n shew'd her something like this Morning Chace  By trembling Slaves who fled their Tyrant's Face  Perhaps to warn us timely from our Bed  For O my dear AMANDA had we stay'd  I had not liv'd to tell this mystic Tale  Nor you to hear the Secrets I reveal  But let us to my happy Country steer  Nor longer wait impending Ruin here  So spake the Youth and with a gracious Look  He seem'd to sanctify the Words he spoke  Go she reply'd go where you are inclin'd  Your faithful Lover will not stay behind  If o'er the Seas you shall attempt your Way  The Seas shall not compel me here to stay  Nor will I fear the Surges of the Deep  For Surges oft you say assail the Ship  Calm and compos'd intrepid will I stand  Till you conduct me to your native Land  Or if you would some other Clime pursue  Then shall some other Climate please me too  And when the happy destin'd Land we meet  Where Providence shall fix our wand'ring Feet  With joyful Servitude I'll still attend  On you my nuptial Lord and dearest Friend  Soon as AURORA spreads her purple Ray  When you awake to chase the nimble Prey  I'll also rise and with an equal Art  Display the Net or speed the pointed Dart  Or search the Plains and tasteful Herbs provide  Or strip the Vines and press their juicy Pride  Each Ev'ning will I fondly deck your Bed  With sweetest Flow'rets gather'd from the Mead  And when dissolv'd in downy Sleep you lie  I'll wake and watch if Foes approach too nigh  To guard your Life all Hazards will I run  And for your Safety sacrifice my own  TO whom the Youth No Hazards shall you run  Nor for my Safety sacrifice your own  Nor yet at Ev'ning fondly deck my Bed  With sweetest Flow'rets gather'd from the Mead  Nor shall AMANDA tasteful Herbs explore  Nor shall AVARO chase the savage Boar  A softer Bed than Flow'rs shall give you Rest  A choicer Meat than Fruits indulge your Taste  Ten thousand Things my grateful Soul shall find  To charm your Fancy and delight your Mind  I'll vary Love a hundred diff'rent Ways  And institute new Arts to make it please  So shall our future Race of Children see  A constant Proverb made of you and me  When  British  Youths shall court the doubting Dame  And want Expressions equal to their Flame  Then strongly to attest it shall be said  "  True as  AVARO  to the  Indian  Maid  "  To whom AMANDA pausing at the  Name    What meant AVARO by the  doubting Dame  Has any of your  British  Damsels made  A  Doubt  of what such godlike Beings said  Or is it customary to your Clime  Has ever Youth committed such a  Crime    As  base Ingratitude  Has any there  Deluded first and then forsook the Fair  I cannot think your Love will e'er decline  Nor can my radiant Angel question mine  By yon bright Beams which paint the rising Day  By thy bright Charms as beautiful as they  By all our pleasing Hours of Love I vow  To share your Fate thro' ev'ry Scene of Woe  Content with you to yield my vital Breath  For Life without you would but lengthen Death  WITH such sweet Talk their Moments they beguile  Both seem impatient for the destin'd Isle  He daily vows and daily is believ'd  She daily hears and daily is deceiv'd  CANTO IV  FAREWEL bright Goddess of th'  Idalian  Grove  Farewel ye sportive Deities of LOVE  No longer I your pleasing Joys rehearse  A rougher Theme demands my pensive Verse  A Scene of Woes remains to be display'd  Indulgent Love with Slavery repaid  Ingratitude and broken Vows and Lies  The mighty Ills that spring from Avarice  Provoke my Lays Your Aid ye Muses bring  Assist my Tragic Numbers while I sing  Say what ensu'd when on the briny Deep  The watchful Dame beheld a floating Ship  She call'd and beckon'd to it from the Shore  Then to the Youth the grateful Tidings bore  And said I something see like winged Trees  Strange to behold fly swiftly o'er the Seas  Their bulky Roots upon the Billows float  Say is not this the Ship you long have sought  Or I mistake or by the Gods Command  This comes to bear us to your native Land  Then hasten see the Partner of your Heart  With You her Guide is ready to depart  My Father Mother Friends I bid Adieu  Friends Father Mother not so dear as  You  To whom the Youth with smiling Brow reply'd  O thou true Pattern of a faithful Bride  Who dar'st thy Father Mother Friends resign  And risque thy own dear Life to rescue mine  If I forget the Debt I owe to  Thee    May all the Gods forget their Care of  Me  In more wild Deserts let me rove again  Nor find a Friend like  Thee  to ease my Pain  There let the Vulturs Wolves and Tigers tear  This Body  Thou  hast kindly nourish'd here  So saying to the Beach he straight descends  And by the Flag discerns the Crew his Friends  And now his Heart exults within his Breast  His loving Mate an equal Joy confest  She with him gladly ventures on the Main  Unthinking of her future Toil and Pain  So to the Plough the Heifer yet unbroke  Walks chearful on nor dreads th'impending Yoke  Till in the Fields urg'd with the piercing Goad  She groans and writhes reluctant with her Load  THE  British  Bark was to  Barbados  bound  Th'expected Shore the Sailers quickly found  Where safe from Danger now the perjur'd Youth  False to his former Vows of sacred Truth  Reflecting counts the Int'rest he had lost  While Fate detain'd him on the  Indian  Coast  The frugal Thoughts suppress his am'rous Flame  And prompt him to betray the faithful Dame  Yet scarce he can the cursed Fact pursue  But hesitates at what he fain would do  For tho' his Av'rice moves him to the Ill  His Gratitude within him struggles still  And 'twixt two Passions neither guides his Will  AS when two Scales which equal Loads suspend  Sway to and fro alternate both descend  Till undeclining each aloft abides  Nor this nor that the doubtful Weight decides  SO stood the doubtful Youth awhile nor wou'd  Forsake the Evil nor pursue the Good  Till as the Sailers in the Haven stay  To purchase Slaves the Planters croud the Key  One asks for what the  Negro  may be sold  Then bids a Price and shews the tempting Gold  Which when AVARO views with greedy Eyes  He soon resolves to gain th'alluring Prize  Nor Oaths nor Gratitude can longer bind  Her Fate he thus determines in his Mind  " SUPPOSE I should conduct this  Indian  o'er  " And thus instead of Gold import a  Moor    " Would not my Sire with stern contracted Brows  " Condemn my Choice and curse my nuptial Vows  " Was it for this I learn'd the Merchant's Art  " Only to gain a doating  Negro  's Heart  " Was it for this the raging Seas I crost  " No Gold induc'd me to the  Indian  Coast  " And Gold is offer'd for this simple Dame  " Shall I refuse it or renounce my Flame  " Let am'rous Fools their tiresome Joys renew  " And doat on  Love  while  Int'rest  I pursue"  He added not for now intent on Gold  And dead to all Remorse the  Dame  he sold  AMANDA  stood confounded with Surprize  And silently reproach'd him with her Eyes  She often try'd to speak but when she try'd  Her Heart swell'd full her Voice its Aid deny'd  And when she made her fault'ring Tongue obey  These Words commix'd with Sighs found out their Way  " WHO can the mystic Ways of Fate explain  " Am I awake or do I dream again  " Is  this  the sad Reward of all my Care  " Was it for this I chear'd thee in Despair  " The Gods above if any Gods there be  " Witness what I have done to succour thee  " Yet if my  Kindness  can't thy Pity move  " Pity the  Fruits  of our unhappy  Love  " O let the Infant in my pregnant Womb  " Excite thee to revoke my threaten'd Doom  " Think how the future Slave in Climes remote  " Shall curse the treach'rous Sire that him begot"  SO spake the mourning Dame but spake in vain  Th'obdurate Youth insults her with Disdain  Not all her  Kindness  could his Pity move  Nor yet the  Fruits  of their unhappy  Love  But as the Flames which soften Wax display  The same warm Force to harden sordid Clay  That Motive which would melt another Heart  More harden'd his and made him act a double Villain's Part  He for the Child demands a larger Sum  And sells it while an Embryo in the Womb  AND now he sternly takes her by the Hand  Then drags her on reluctant to the Land  While as she walks her dismal Fate she moans  The Rocks around her echo to her Groans  " O base ungrateful Youth" she loudly cries  " O base ungrateful Youth" the Shore replies  " And canst thou cruel perjur'd Villain leave  " Thy tender Infant too an abject Slave  " To toil and groan and bleed beneath the  Rod  " Fool that I was to think thou wert a God  " Sure from some savage Tyger art thou sprung  " No Tygers feed and fawn upon their Young  " But thou despisest all paternal Cares  " The Fate of Infants and their Mother's Pray'rs"  IN vain she does her wretched State deplore  Pleas'd with the Gold he gladly quits the Shore  The ruffling Winds dilate the Sails the Ship  Divides the Waves and skims along the Deep  Three Days the bellying Canvas gently swells  Clear shines the Sun and friendly blow the Gales  Then frowning Clouds invest the vaulted Sky  And hollow Winds proclaim a Tempest nigh  Fierce BOREAS loudly o'er the Ocean roars  Smoke the white Waves and sound the adverse Shores  While to increase the Horrors of the Main  Descends a Deluge of impetuous Rain  The giddy Ship on circling Eddies rides  Toss'd and retoss'd the Sport of Winds and Tides  Redoubled Peals of roaring Thunder roll  And Flames conflicting flash from Pole to Pole  While guilty Thoughts distract AVARO's Soul  Of Life despairing tho' afraid to die  One fatal Effort yet he means to try  While all the busy Crew with panting Breath  Were lab'ring to repel the liquid Death  AVARO from the Stern the Boat divides  And yields up to the Fury of the Tides  Toss'd on the boist'rous Wave the Vessel flies  Now sinking low now mounting to the Skies  Till soon the Storm decreas'd and by degrees  Hush'd were the Winds and calm the ruffled Seas  The Sailers safely steer their Course again  And leave AVARO floating on the Main  Who landed quickly on a lonely Isle  Where human Feet ne'er print the baleful Soil  A dreary Wilderness was all appear'd  And howling Wolves the only Sound he heard  A thousand Deaths he views before his Eyes  A thousand Guiltcreated Fiends arise  A  conscious Hell  within his Bosom burns  And racks his tortur'd Soul while thus he mourns  " CURS'D be the Precepts of my selfish Sire  " Who bad me after fatal Gold aspire  " Curs'd be myself and doubly curs'd who sold  " A faithful Friend to gain that fatal Gold  " O could these gloomy Woods my Sin conceal  " Or in my Bosom quench this firy  Hell    " Here would I pine my wretched Life away  " Or to the hungry Savage fall a Prey  " But can the gloomy Woods conceal my Sin  " Or cooling Shadows quench the  Hell  within  " No like some Spirit banish'd Heav'n I find  " Terrors in ev'ry Place to rack my Mind  " Tormenting conscious Plagues increase my Care  " And guilty Thoughts indulge my just Despair  " O where shall I that piercing Eye evade  " That scans the Depths of Hell's tremendous Shade"  SO saying straight he gave a hideous Glare  With rolling Eyes that witness'd strong Despair  Then drew his pointed Weapon from the Sheath  Confus'dly wild and all his Thoughts on Death  To pierce his trembling Heart he thrice essay'd  And thrice his coward Arm deny'd its Aid  Meanwhile a howling Wolf with Hunger prest  Leap'd on the Wretch and seiz'd him by the Breast  Tore out his Heart and lick'd the purple Flood  For Earth refus'd to drink the  Villain  's Blood  To a Young LADY who had a CUPID given Her  FAIR Lady take a special Care  This pleasing Toy become no Snare  The  subtle God  is full of Wiles  And mischiefs most when most he smiles  Beware to clasp him in your Arms  Nor gaze too much upon his Charms  Lest in a borrow'd Shape he wound  As once unhappy DIDO found  For while she view'd his smiling Look  Her Heart receiv'd a fatal Stroke  On the Hon Mrs HORNER's Travelling for the Recovery of her  Health  CLARISSA long has sought in vain  Physicians Aid to ease her Pain  But now their Aid she seeks no more  Nor longer will their Drugs endure  Spite of their Art her Spirits fail  Her Cheeks are turn'd a languid Pale  Yet tho' her mortal Part's decay'd  Her nobler  Virtue  does not fade  Her Soul inflexible to Ill  In Piety advances still  So Metals lie in chymic Fires  And while the grosser Part expires  The Flames refine the golden Ore  And make it brighter than before  SHE now a warmer Clime explores  To prove the Air of foreign Shores  O may the temp'rate Breezes bring  Salubrious Med'cines on their Wing  Thou PHOEBUS too propitious shine  And since the Pow'r of Physic's thine  Send blooming Health on ev'ry Beam  Dispel her Pains and chear the Dame  Else must my melancholy Strain  In mournful Elegies complain  Ev'n now too well these Numbers show  My drooping Fancy's damp'd with Woe  Yet tho' my Verse deserves no Praise  Let no sour Critic damn my Lays  Since OVID's Self but faintly sung  When only Grief inspir'd his Tongue  The ABSENT LOVER  ALEXIS walking in the Park  Met CHLOE just before 'twas dark  He ask'd a Kiss nor she deny'd  I don't know what they did beside  But as a Child in Thought chews o'er  The Sweetmeats which he eat before  So in his Mind ALEXIS keeps  The dear Impression of her Lips  He felt it all the foll'wing Day  At Night indulg'd it at the Play  One ling'ring Act he musing stay'd  But knew not what the Actors said  He thought the Park in  Drurylane    Believ'd the Nymph appear'd again  He seems to view her snowy Neck  Her ruby Lip and rosy Cheek  Her graceful Smiles and sparkling Eyes  Her panting Bosom fall and rise  And now he clasp'd her in his Arms  'Twas all imaginary Charms  When rising to the Height of Bliss  His Lips essay'd to take a Kiss  An Orangewench trod on his Foot  And screaming "  Will you have some Fruit  "  Surpriz'd he dropt the pleasing Theme  And found his Joys a waking Dream  He swore and wept and kick'd the Wench  Forgot his Hat and left the Bench  On a  Screen  work'd in Flowers by Her  Royal Highness  ANNE Princess of ORANGE  ILLUSTRIOUS Nymph whose Art could raise  This skilful Monument of Praise  Forgive the Bard who strikes the Lyre  Accept the Verse your  Toils  inspire  For when your  Labours  strike my Eyes  The voluntary Numbers rise  Who can be silent when they view  This fair Creation wrought by  You  Each Flow'r does with such Lustre shine  Such Beauties crown the gay Design  That Nature fix'd in Wonder stands  To see she's rival'd by your Hands  And jealous of your Art displays  A Blush when she the Work surveys  Yet this accomplish'd Piece we find  Shews a faint Image of your  Mind    The lovely Charms and Graces  here    But copy those that centre  there  To His ROYAL HIGHNESS The DUKE of CUMBERLAND On His BIRTHDAY  TWELVE  This was writ when the DUKE enter'd into the Twelfth Year of his Age  times hath SOL his annual Race begun  Since JOVE descended from his radiant Throne  Around the pendent Globe the God pursu'd  His circling March and human Actions view'd  But griev'd that  Virtue  droop'd her languid Head  While  Vice  from Clime to Clime contagious spread  Back to his native Seat he sternly flies  And sends an Edict thro' the spacious Skies  To call th'Ethereal Pow'rs Swift flew his Word  Th'Ethereal Pow'rs as swift attend their Lord  Upon  Olympus  ' Top the Synod met  Where high inthron'd the thund'ring Monarch sat  And with a Nod that shook the Spheres he swore  The Minor Gods should visit Earth no more  What must your earthly Sons MINERVA cry'd  Explore their doubtful Way without a Guide  If PALLAS must no more to Mortals go  Let PALLAS beg a Substitute below  Worthy to rule the World whose noble Mind  May copy out the Gods to human Kind  She lowly bow'd and JOVE consenting smil'd  Go form said he this newimagin'd Child  Collect the best Materials where you will  And let us see for once MINERVA's Skill  He said she hastens o'er the bright Abodes  Selecting each Perfection of the Gods  From MARS she warlike Strength and Courage took  But soften'd them with VENUS' graceful Look  To these she added HERMES' Eloquence  And crown'd it with her own superior Sense  Some of APOLLO's piercing Rays she stole  And while the MUSES play'd she form'd a Soul  When thus compos'd the bright Ingredients lay  She nobly drest them in Ethereal Clay  JOVE touch'd the Mass with his enliv'ning Hand  And vital Warmth inspir'd a CUMBERLAND  To DEATH  An IRREGULAR ODE  I  HAIL formidable KING  My Muse thy dreaded Fame shall sing  Why should old HOMER's pompous Lays  Immortalize ACHILLES' Praise  Or why should ADDISON's harmonious Verse  Our MARLBRO's nobler Deeds rehearse  Alas no more these  Heroes  shine  Their Pow'r is all subdu'd by  Thine  Where are these mighty  Leaders  now  Great POMPEY CAESAR and Young AMMON too  Who thought he drew immortal Breath  These bold ambitious Sons of MARS  Who dy'd the Globe with bloody Wars  Are vanquish'd all by thee victorious DEATH  II  EV'N while they liv'd their Martial Hate  But firmer fix'd thy Throne  Nor tho' it hasten'd others Fate  Could it delay their own  Nor didst thou want  their Rage  to kill  Thy own  can execute thy Will  Whene'er thou dost exert thy Pow'r  A thousand morbid Troops thy Call obey  Sometimes thy wasting Plagues devour  And sweep whole Realms away  Now with contagious Biles the City mourns  And now thy scorching Fever burns  Or trembling Quartan chills  Of Heat and Cold the dire Extremes  Now freeze now fire the Blood with Flames  Till various Torment kills  III  CONSUMPTIONS and Rheumatic Pain  And Apoplectic Fits that rack the Brain  Soulpanting Asthmas Dropsy and Catarrh  Gout Palsy Lunacy and black Despair  Pangs that neglected Lovers feel  Corroding Jealousy their earthly Hell  Which makes the injur'd Woman wild  And pow'rful Spleen that gets the  Man  with Child  Physicians Surgeons Bawds and Whores and Wine  Are all obsequious Ministers of  Thine    Nay and RELIGION too  When Hypocrites their Interest pursue  Or frantic Zeal inspires  It calls for Racks and Wheels and Fires  Then all our mystic Articles of Faith  Instead of saving Life become the Cause of DEATH  IV  GREAT MONARCH how secure must be thy Crown  When all these Things conspire to prop thy Throne  Yet in thy universal Reign  Thou dost not use tyrannic Sway  Whate'er the Weak and Tim'rous say  Who tremble at thy Frown  Thou art propitious to our Pain  And break'st the groaning Pris'ner's Chain  Which Tyranny put on  In  Thee  the Lover quits his Care  Nor longer courts the cruel  Fair    Her Coldness mourns no more  In  Thee  Ambition ends its Race  And finds at length the destin'd Place  It ne'er could find before  The Merchant too who plows the Main  In greedy Quest of Gain  By Thee to happier Climes is brought  Than those his wild insatiate Av'rice sought  V  PROPITIOUS Succourer of the Distrest  Who often by the Dead dost make the Living blest  How could profusive  Heirs  attend  Their Mistress Bottle Ball and Play  If timely  Thou  wertnot their Friend  To snatch the scraping Sire away  How would dull Poets weary Time  With their insipid Rhyme  And teaze and tire the Readers Ears  With Party Feuds and Paper Wars  If  Thou  great Critic didst not use  Thy Pow'r to point a Period for their Muse  The Bard at thy decisive Will  Discards his  mercenary Quill    Then all his mighty Volumes lie  Hid in the peaceful  Tomb  of vast Obscurity  VI  I like the rest advance my Lays  With uncouth Numbers rumble forth a Song  Sedately dull to celebrate thy Praise  And lash and spur the heavy lab'ring Muse along  But soon the fatal Time must come  Ordain'd by Heav'n's unerring Doom  When Thou shalt cut the vital Thread  And shove the verbal Embryos from my Head  Then since I'm sure to meet my Fate  How vain would  Hope  appear  Since  Fear  cannot protract the Date  How foolish 'twere to  fear  I'll strive at least to stand prepar'd  Thy Summons to obey  Nor would I think thy Sentence hard  Nor wish nor fear the  Day    But live in conscious Peace and die without Dismay  VII  FALLACIOUS Reas'ners wrong  Thee  when  They call thy Laws severe  Severe to whom  To wicked Men    Then let the Wicked fear  Thou  judgest all with equal Laws  No venal Witness backs thy Cause  No Bribes to  Thee  are known  If thy impartial Hand but strike  The Prince and Peasant fall alike  The Courtier and the Clown  What tho' awhile the Beggar groans  While Kings enjoy their gilded Thrones  What are Distinctions Pomp and Regal Train  And  Honours  got with Care and kept with Pain  One friendly Stroke of  thine  sets level all again  All earthly Grandeur must decline  Nay ev'n Great GEORGE's Pow'r submit to  thine  But  thy Dominion  shall endure  Till PHOEBUS measures Time no more  Then all shall be in dark Oblivion cast  And ev'ry mortal  Kingdom  fall but  thine  shall fall the last  On Mrs  L  s  SUCH Sweetness and Goodness together combin'd  So beauteous her Face and so bright is her Mind  So loving yet chaste and so humble yet fair  So comely her Shape and so decent her Air  So skilful that Nature's improv'd by her Art  So prudent her Head and so bounteous her Heart  So wise without Pride and so modestly neat  'Tis strange this agreeable Creature's a Cheat  For tho' she to Man for a Mortal was giv'n  These Virtues betray her Extraction from Heav'n  TRUTH and FALSHOOD  A FABLE  SOON as the Iron Age on Earth began  And Vice found easy Entrance into Man  Forth from her Cave infernal FALSHOOD came  FALSHOOD the Hate of Gods of Men the Shame  A silken Robe she wore of various Hue  Its Colour changing with each diff'rent View  Studious to cheat and eager to beguile  She mimic'd TRUTH and ap'd her heav'nly Smile  But mimic'd TRUTH in vain the varying Vest  To ev'ry searching Eye the Fiend confest  AT length she saw celestial TRUTH appear  Serene her Brow and chearful was her Air  Her silver Locks with shining Fillets bound  With Laurel Wreaths her peaceful Temples crown'd  A Lily Robe was girded round her Waist  And o'er her Arms a radiant Mantle cast  With decent Negligence it hung behind  And loosely flowing wanton'd in the Wind  Thus TRUTH advanc'd unknowing of Deceit  And FALSHOOD bowing low began the Cheat  HAIL charming Maid bright as the Morning Star  Daughter of JOVE and Heav'n's peculiar Care  'Tis thine to weigh the World in equal Scales  And chide the conscious Soul when Vice prevails  Dispensing Justice with impartial Hand  The mightiest Pow'rs submit to thy Command  Ev'n Gods themselves tho' in their Actions free  Consult resolve and act as you decree  Great Sov'reign JOVE the first Ethereal Name  Advis'd with thee to form the heav'nly Frame  As TRUTH approv'd he bad the Fabric rise  And spread the azure Mantle of the Skies  Plac'd ev'ry Planet in its proper Sphere  Nor rolls  this  Orb too wide nor  that  too near  But why thus walk we mindless of our Ease  Expos'd beneath the Sun's meridian Blaze  Better retire and shun the scorching Ray  Till fanning  Zephyrs  cool our Ev'ning Way  Hear how yon limpid Streams run murm'ring by  And tuneful Birds their sylvan Notes apply  See fragrant Shrubs along the Borders grow  And waving Shades beneath the Poplar Bough  All these invite us to the River's Side  To bathe our Limbs and sport within the Tide  So cool the Stream the flow'ry Banks so sweet  DIANA's Self might covet the Retreat  Nor can a short Diversion check your Haste  Fresh Strength will soon succeed such welcome Rest  As rapid Currents held awhile at Bay  With swifter Force pursue their liquid Way  So spake the Phantom and with friendly Look  Supporting what she said approach'd the Brook  TRUTH follow'd artless unsuspicious Maid  And in an evil Hour the Voice obey'd  Both at the crystal Stream arriv'd unbound  Their diff'rent Robes both cast them to the Ground  The Fiend upon the Margin ling'ring stood  The naked Goddess leapt into the Flood  Sporting she swims the liquid Surface o'er  Unmindful of the matchless Robe she wore  Not FALSHOOD soShe hasty seiz'd the Vest  And with the beauteous Spoils herself she drest  Then wing'd with Joy outflew the swiftest Wind  Her own infernal Robe far left behind  Straight she aspires above her former State  And gains Admittance to the Rich and Great  Nay such her daring Pride that some report  When thus equipp'd she boldly went to  Court  There spake and look'd with such a graceful Air  Mistaken FAME pronounc'd her Wise and Fair  She fill'd the Wanton's Tongue with specious Names  To deal in  Wounds  and  Deaths  in  Darts  and  Flames    He prefac'd all his leud Attempts with Love  And  Fraud  prevail'd where  Reason  could not move  At length she mingled with the learned Throng  And tun'd the Muse's mercenary Song  In all the Labyrinths of Logic skill'd  She taught the subtle Reas'ner  not  to yield  Instructed how to puzzle each Dispute  And boldly  baffle  Men tho' not  confute  Now at the Bar she play'd the Lawyer's Part  And shap'd out  Right  and  Wrong  by Rules of Art  Now in the Senate rais'd her pompous Tone  Talk'd much of  Public Good  but meant  her Own  Oft to th'  Olympian  Field she turn'd her Eyes  And taught the Racers how to gain the Prize  In Schools and Temples too she claim'd a Share  While FALSHOOD's Self admir'd her Influence there  DELUDED TRUTH observ'd the Fraud too late  Nor knew she to repair a Loss so great  In vain her heav'nly Robes she sighing seeks  In vain the humid Pearls bedew her Cheeks  In vain she tears the Laurel from her Hair  While Nature seems to sympathize her Care  The glowing Flow'rs that crown th'enamel'd Meads  Weep fragrant Dews and hang their drooping Heads  The sylvan Choirs as conscious of her Pains  Deplore her Loss in melancholy Strains  Thus pensive and uncloath'd upon the Shore  She stands and sees the Robe which FALSHOOD wore  Detested Sight Nor longer now she mourns  But Grief to Rage transform'd with Anger burns  Into the Stream the hellish Robe she tost  And scorn'd a Habit so unlike the lost  HENCE TRUTH now naked roves as in Disgrace  None but the Wise and Virtuous see her Face  From Cities far she modestly retreats  From busy Scenes of Life to peaceful Seats  Is chiefly found in lonely Fields and Cells  Where Silence reigns and Contemplation dwells  Hence FALSHOOD cheats us in the fair Disguise  And seems TRUTH's Self to all unwary Eyes  Triumphs and thrives in Pow'r and Wealth and Fame  And builds her Glory on her Rival's Name  With Safety dares to flatter fawn and sooth  For who knows FALSHOOD when array'd like TRUTH  Proper Ingredients  to make a  Sceptic  WOULD

shew  Their Master's Loyalty and Learning too  Thus have thy Precepts made thy Province shine  And ev'n MINERVA's  Athens  yield to  thine  On  Celia  's Picture drawn by Sir  Godfrey Kneller  WITH such a sapient Eye and heav'nly Mind  MINERVA taught her Arts to human Kind  With such attractive Charms and graceful Air  VENUS was judg'd the  Queen  of all the  Fair  Such Sense and Beauty to the

Day  Nor scorn a Muse the meanest of the Nine  Who brings her humble Off'ring to your Shrine  And you Imperial Nymph whose lovely Face  Invites the Hero to your chaste Embrace  Vouchsafe a Spark of your celestial Fire  Harmonious Words and pleasing Thoughts inspire  Soft as your Love and tuneful as your Lyre  So shall my Numbers charm the list'ning Ear  And ev'n the glad NASSAU delighted hear  NASSAU has long enrich'd the Book of Fame  And ANNA now adorns the noble Name  Nations who saw the Light of ORANGE rise  With awful Splendor in the  Belgian  Skies  Shall soon behold it with new Lustre shine  Join'd to a glorious Star of BRUNSWIC's Line  SO where the flowing  Sambre  gently glides  The Swain delights to view the beauteous Tides  But when his more extended Eye surveys  The shining Torrent join the spacious  Maese    Both Rivers thus with friendly Union flow  And to the Sight superior Beauty show  WHENE'ER the Gods a noble Race intend  They suit the Causes to the destin'd End  Nor yoke unequal Hearts in Nuptial Love  JOVE's valiant Bird disdains the fearful Dove  Great Minds by native Sympathy combine  As golden Particles the closest join  Paternal Virtues in their Bosom roll  Ally'd in Love by Nobleness of Soul  Hence Thrones and Sceptres shine neglected Things  Hence Royal ANNE prefers NASSAU to Kings  While  Britons  with united Hearts rejoice  And willing Senators applaud the Choice  To see their KING to Honour ever true  Discharge the Debt to sacred WILLIAM due  Immortal WILLIAM by whose prudent Cares  We yet enjoy the Fruits of all our Wars  Our Laws Religion Liberty and Peace  And ev'n the Blessings of the BRUNSWIC Race  NOR Thou Illustrious ORANGE blush to own  Thy Honour thus ally'd to  Albion  's Crown  Blest with a Princess in whose Form we trace  Her Father's Majesty and Mother's Grace  Bright Orbs of Pow'r that with propitious Ray  Dispel our Clouds and beautify our Day  Not as the Comet raging thro' the Air  Infects the World with Pestilence and War  But like the Sun their Beams of Goodness glow  Inspiring Life and chearing all below  Such are the glorious SIRE and gracious DAME  From whence the beauteous Bride of ORANGE came  And shall unerring Nature change her Kind  What Lion e'er produc'd a tim'rous Hind  The Royal Eagles Royal Eagles breed  And Heroes from heroic Sires proceed  Rome  's Founder thus confess'd his Race Divine  Thus NASSAU copies the NASSOVIAN Line  Thus ANNA's noble Stream of Virtue flows  High as the Regal Spring from whence it rose  Thrice happy Nymph with ev'ry Grace supply'd  Thrice happy Prince with such a heav'nly Bride  In whom superior Sense with Judgment joins  Her Beauty much but more her Merit shines  How glorious When such Worth adorns the Great  We hear we see admire and imitate  Virtue in Them attracts remotest Eyes  But in the vulgar Soul unheeded lies  As radiant PHOEBUS darts superior Light  While smaller Planets shun the watchful Sight  ACCOMPLISH'D thus let her Example fire  The drooping Muse and wake the sounding Lyre  To aid Religion be her chiefest Care  Heav'n justly claims the Soul it made so fair  To stem the Torrent of licentious Rage  And prop the Virtues of a sinking Age  Exalting Science to her ancient Height  To raise declining Arts and make the Rude polite  While great NASSAU whom native Glory warms  Whene'er his Country calls him forth to Arms  May fire the  Belgians  in the Field of MARS  Consult their Peace or animate their Wars  Paint his Forefathers to their wond'ring Eye  And teach 'em how to conquer or to die  Like him who bravely dar'd to break their Chain  Tho' held by all the Force and Fraud of  Spain  For injur'd Liberty the Sword he draws  Resolv'd to gain or perish in the Cause  And having long the doubtful Combat try'd  Like CAESAR vanquish'd and like CAESAR  King WILLIAM's GreatGrandfather the First great Assertor of the  Belgian  Liberties assassinated at  Delph  dy'd  Tho' diff'rent far the Motives of their

Day  Since yet the glorious Name of ORANGE stands  Since Royal ANNA seals the Nuptial Bands  Soon may Imperial ADOLPHS rise again  Again new FRED'RICS thunder on the Main  Rouzing the Martial Youth to War's Alarms  If proud  Iberians  shine again in Arms  To guard their Country from tyrannic Pow'r  And be what glorious WILLIAM was before  NOR shall the  States  invading Forces fear  Ere pregnant Time the promis'd Heroes bear  Nor want Allies their Freedom to defend  Since BRUNSWIC reigns and ALBION is their Friend  As branching Oaks protect the rural Swain  Secure from Summer Heat and Winter Rain  So shall our Monarch with paternal Aid  His Regal Shelter o'er  Batavia  spread  Long as the Sceptre fills his Royal Hand  A true  Palladium  shall insure the Land  AND if the prescient Muses guide my Lay  Or future Secrets PHOEBUS can display  The Day shall shine distinguish'd from the rest  That ANNA dignify'd and HYMEN blest  In which AUGUSTUS fortifies his Throne  And plans a Scheme of Union for his Son  Bespeaks Allies for Princes yet to come  New Friends to  Britain  and new Foes to  Rome  PROCEED Great MONARCH new Allies to gain  And with new Nuptial Leagues our Peace maintain

Author In IMITATION of HORACE's ODE on PINDAR  By a DIVINE  Apply'd to the Marriage of his Highness the Prince of  Orange  with ANNE Princess Royal of  Great Britain  WHO hopes to rival MILTON's Flame  With waxen Pinions fondly flies  His Fall will give the Sea a Name  While he attempts to reach the Skies  MILTON is like a Flood whose Tide  Swell'd with tempestuous Deluge roars  Which from some lofty Mountain's Side  Resistless foams and knows no Shores  With sacred Laurels justly crown'd  Whether in bold unfetter'd Strains  His tow'ring Muse the common Bound  Superior to all Rhyme disdains  Whether the Realms of endless Day  He fill with Wars and rude Alarms  Or set in terrible Array  Seraphic  Legions  clad in Arms  Aloft with all their Forests thrown  See Hills from their Foundations raz'd  See Angels hurl'd with Vengeance down  When the MESSIAH's Standard blaz'd  Or leads he to connubial Bow'rs  The newform'd Pair The teeming Ground  Smiles with a Wilderness of Flow'rs  Diffusing Gales of Fragrance round  Lo ADAM with majestic Mien  For Empire and Command design'd  Consummate Beauty crowns his Queen  With Dignity and Sweetness join'd  While he the charming Scene displays  Where Innocence and Pleasure reign'd  Delighted with his sacred Lays  We hear it lost and feel it gain'd  His Lays inimitably fine  With Ecstasy each Passion move  When loud they trumpet War divine  Or softly warble human Love  O STEPHEN this  Britannic  Swan  Surmounts the Clouds with noble Flight  While I at Distance only can  Admire him less'ning to the Sight  As the poor Bee with endless Toil  To suck the Thyme and blooming Rose  Skims over  Richmond  's fragrant Soil  Thus I with pleasing Pain compose  You with a happy Genius blest  In bolder Strains shall NASSAU sing  When ANNA by the Graces drest  He to the Nuptial Dome shall bring  ANNA enrich'd with various Charms  By the indulgent Care of Heav'n  Than whom into his longing Arms  No greater Treasure can be giv'n  Not tho' with Riches of the  East    At his Command the  Ganges  flow  Tho' with full Empire he possess'd  Whate'er Ambition wish'd below  Ye NEREIDS with propitious Gales  The gilded Vessel kindly aid  Let CUPIDS

tumultuous Joy the Sound  Shall bid AUGUSTA rise in Flames  Loud Thunder bursting from her Tow'rs  Shall signalize the sacred Day  And Transport to the  Belgic  Shores  For Blessings which they lent convey  Around while  Hymeneals  ring  My Voice to highest Pitch I'll raise  Thrice happy if I can but sing  An humble Ode to NASSAU's Praise  You soaring in Heroic Verse  By native Strength of Wing upborn  His godlike Virtues shall rehearse  And Beauties which the Bride adorn  He in your Lays shall finish'd rise  For Council or th'embattled Field  Immortals the contested Prize  To her superior Charms shall yield  Then ravish'd with prophetic Views  Succeeding Glories shall presage  And from the Genial Bed the Muse  Raise Princes to improve the Age  Who bravely prodigal of Blood  Shall prove that to set free Mankind  And conquer for the Public Good  The Race of NASSAU was design'd  Thus great ALCIDES Poets feign  By Labours gain'd the Seats above  Countries preserv'd and Monsters slain  Assert the genuine Son of JOVE  The ANSWER  WHEN I in feeble Verse essay'd  NASSAU and ANNA's Praise  A Lyric Muse flew o'er my Head  And dropp'd a Branch of Bays  I would have fix'd it on my Brow  But PHOEBUS said Forbear  'Tis  Vanity  to  touch  the Bough  And  Sacrilege  to  wear  Give it the Bard who boldly dares  Attempt the  Roman  Lyre  Who wisely checks but not impairs  The tow'ring PINDAR's Fire  Thus Sir to you in PHOEBUS' Name  The Laurel Wreath I send  And since the God denies  me  Fame  Am glad it crowns my  Friend  On  Delia  singing and playing on Music  I  WHEN DELIA tunes her vocal Song  And strikes the trembling Strings  The list'ning Audience round her throng  Admiring while she sings  II  BUT when we view the skilful  Fair    We're struck with more Surprize  Before she only pleas'd our Ear  But now inchants our Eyes  III  BEAUTY and Harmony combin'd  Like secret Charms betray  Like Ghosts in magic Rings confin'd  We cannot stir away  IV  So Birds imprudent fall to Ground  When pleasing Notes they hear  Charm'd with the Piper's artful Sound  Till taken in his Snare  To the Right Honourable  William Clayton    Esq  now Lord  Sundon  on his being Elected Representative in Parliament for  Westminster  without Opposition  TO You great Steward of the public Trust  True to your King and to your Country just  No venal Bard his joyful Tribute brings  Nor  Envy  sure can censure what he sings  Since each impartial Tongue your Praise declares  The Muse but echoes what the Poet hears  SOME by their Birth to Senates lay their Claim  Whose Folly shames the  Seat  which honours  them  But You whose Merits mov'd the People's Voice  Unanimous to make so wise a Choice  With solid Sense and prudent Conduct shew  You grace the Senate not the Senate You  Where in the List of Patriots could we find  A sounder  Judgment  a sincerer  Mind  Or where a juster  Hand  to poise the Scale  Of  Kings Prerogative  and  Public  Weal  Nor  this  you strive to

Public Good  tho' Int'rest lead the Way  For  Public Good  you still employ your Tongue  And rather than commit you suffer Wrong  When  South sea    Waves o'erflow'd the  British  Plain  And  Members  barter'd Honesty for Gain  No Gain no Place nor Profit could controul  The stubborn Virtue of your steady Soul  You firm to  Honour    Truth  and  Conscience  stood  Unfashionably just and obstinately good  BUT why should I in feeble Numbers tell  Those Virtues which your Actions paint so well  For all the Actions of your Life proclaim  A Subject's loyal Love a Patriot's Fame  Your Care to keep the People's Int'rest sure  Your Zeal to guard the Prince's Crown secure  Make Prince and People both espouse your  Cause    Witness their latest Choice and loud  Applause    When crowded Streets with Acclamations rung  And CLAYTON's Praises dwelt on ev'ry Tongue  Parties themselves agreed your Worth to boast  Or differ'd only who should praise it most  While tim'rous Candidates the  Test  declin'd  And to your nobler Brow the Palm resign'd  So fly the Stars before the rising Sun  And from his brighter Beams withdraw their own  To Mr  Winder  now Fellow of  CorpusChristi    Oxford  in Answer to a  Latin  Epistle which he sent me  I  SOON as your partial Lays I saw  I guess'd your crafty Views  And thought you writ in Verse to draw  A Bill upon my Muse  II  BUT since the Treasure you convey  Comes from the  Roman  Mine  Forgive me if I can't repay  The Value of your Coin  III  WHILE on thy manly Lines I dwell  Lines that might POPE employ  What strange Vicissitudes I feel  Of Sorrow Love and Joy  IV  NOW Pleasure charms my glowing Soul  To hear thy pompous Song  In soft majestic Numbers roll  Like FLACCUS sweet and strong  V  BUT quickly sympathizing Pain  Succeeds my short Delight  To find thy moving mournful Strain  Describe thy  Mr  Winder  was much afflicted with sore Eyes when he sent the Epistle  Loss of Sight  VI  I grieve to think MACHAON's Art  Can give thee no Relief  I weep and wish my grateful Heart  Could cure or share thy Grief  VII  NO more to me Encomiums send  In such a learned Strain  But if you'd compliment your Friend  Present him half your  Pain  VIII  TO

Brentfordstreet    O'er  Hounslowheath  my early Course I steer  For Robbers fam'd but I no Robbers fear  Let Gold like Guilt increase the  Miser  's Grief  A  Poet  's Purse like  Virtue  dares a Thief  Colebrook  I quickly pass and soon my Eyes  Survey the Royal Tow'rs of  Windsor  rise  Charm'd with the Theme of POPE's harmonious Song  I check my Steed and slowly move along  As ling'ring Mariners contract their Sails  To feast on Odours of  Arabian  Gales  But lest my Lord your Patience should accuse  The dull Narration of a tedious Muse  I will not sing each Trifle that occurr'd  How much I eat and drank and whipp'd and spurr'd  How oft my Palfry stumbled in the Way  Till  A little Village near  Farringdon  in  Berks  Hatford  ends the Travel of the Day  Where kind  A Farmer once the Author's Master and still his Friend  MENALCAS Partner of my Soul  Revives me with his friendly flowing Bowl  Yet forces no intemp'rate Bumpers round  Except when DELIA's Health the Glasses crown'd  A thousand Labours past we now run o'er  What Scenes we acted and what Toils we bore  No Party Feuds nor Politics we name  The Joys of Friendship mostly were our Theme  Warn'd by the Clock we now retire to Rest  Till rising PHOEBUS streak'd the purple East  Breakfast soon o'er we trace the verdant Field  Where sharpen'd Scythes the lab'ring Mowers wield  Straight Emulation glows in ev'ry Vein  I long to try the curvous Blade again  AS when at  Hockleyhole  old Gamesters view  Young Combatants their Martial Sports renew  A youthful Vigour fires their ancient Soul  Nor former Wounds their Courage can controul  Again they mount the Stage again they play  Again they bear the noble Prize away  So with Ambition burns my daring Breast  I snatch the Scythe and with the Swains contest  Behind 'em close I rush the sweeping Steel  The vanquish'd Mowers soon confess my Skill  NOT long at this laborious Sport I stay  But with my Friend to  Where the Author liv'd a Thresher  Charlton  take my Way  'Twas there my Lord induc'd by potent Ale  Swains leave their Ploughs and Threshers quit their Flail  Your  Money which his Lordship sent to treat the  Threshers  Bounty soon provokes the Bells to ring  Clowns dance Boys hollow and hoarse Coblers sing  Not greater was the Joy in ancient  Greece    When AESON's Son produc'd the  Golden Fleece    Than now appear'd in ev'ry  Thresher  's Breast  Soon as your  Gold  sung Prologue to the Feast  WHY should the Muse recite our Bill of Fare  And with a long Description tire your Ear  None can your gen'rous Treat with Want reproach  All eat enough and many drank too much  Full twenty  Threshers  quaff around the Board  All name their Toast and ev'ry one  my Lord  No Cares no Toils no Troubles now appear  For Troubles Toils and Cares are drown'd in  Beer    Till soon the chol'ric Fumes of Liquor rise  Flush in their Face and sparkle in their Eyes  They now the rustic Feats of Manhood boast  Who best could reap or mow or thresh the most  Contention doubtful All with Anger burn  While each appears a Hero in his Turn  Hard Words succeed so far can  Beer  prevail  That Blows are menac'd ev'n without the Flail  Till thus our Landlord rising from his Chair  Like prudent NESTOR stops impending War  " WHAT Madness Friends what Madness can engage  " Your Minds to burn with this unseemly Rage  " For Shame stain not with Blood our grateful Chear  " Desist from  Blood  or else desist from  Beer  " Are these the only Thanks you give my Lord  " And is it thus his Favours you reward  " If no Respect you pay this chearful Feast  " Yet pay the noble  Founder  some at least"  HE said Abash'd the conscious Heroes stood  Shook Hands and thirsted more for  Beer  than  Blood  Another Glass to TEMPLE's Health they pour  And praise their Liquor much his Bounty more  OFT as this  th of  June  on which his Lordship treats the  Threshers  every Year  Day  returns shall  Threshers  claim  Some Hours of Rest sacred to TEMPLE's Name  Oft as this  Day  returns shall TEMPLE chear  The  Threshers  Hearts with Mutton Beef and Beer  Hence when their Childrens Children shall admire  This Holiday and whence deriv'd inquire  Some grateful Father partial to my Fame  Shall thus describe from whence and how it came  " HERE Child a  Thresher  liv'd in ancient Days  " Quaint Songs he sung and pleasing Roundelays  " A gracious QUEEN his Sonnets did commend  " And some  great Lord  one TEMPLE was his  Friend  " That  Lord  was pleas'd this Holiday to make  " And feast  the Threshers  for  that Thresher  's sake"  THUS shall Tradition keep my Fame alive  The  Bard  may die the  Thresher  still survive  NEXT over  Pewsey  's fertile Fields I haste  Fields with the bearded Crops of CERES grac'd  While pleasing Hopes my grateful Bosom chear  But soon they vanish'd  Rev Mr  Stanley  Rector of  Pewsey  who first encourag'd the Author  STANLEY was not here  FROM hence the Muse to silver  Kennet  flies  On whose green Margin  Hertford

 Mountain's Brow  And tho' I swiftly walk ascend but slow  The spiral Paths in gradual Circles lead  Increase my Journey and elude my Speed  Yet when at length I reach the lofty Height  Towns Vallies Rivers Meadows meet my Sight  A thousand grateful Objects round me smile  Whose various Beauties overpay my Toil  So may you often see the studious Youth  Begin the long laborious Search for TRUTH  How slow his Progress but how great his Pain  How many mazy Problems vex his Brain  Before he o'er the Hills of  Science  rise  Where far from vulgar Sight the Goddess lies  Yet there arriv'd he ends

Discourse with soft persuasive Art  Charm'd the pleas'd Ear till it improv'd the Heart  Bright  Truth  and  Virtue  were his lovely Theme  Which seem'd more lovely when describ'd by  him  VARIOUS

BATHURST my infant Muse's gen'rous Friend  And as around his spacious Park I stray'd  Charm'd with the Prospect which the Fields display'd  Musing on Verse the willing Numbers came  My Song began and

Axes sound  Some bend the stubborn Planks while others rear  The lofty Mast or crooked Timber square  Some ply their Engines some direct the Toil  And carefully inspect the mighty Pile  See ev'ry Chink securely stopt before  The winged Castle ventures from the Shore  So when the youthful Crane intends to fly  Her first long Journey thro' the spacious Sky  Before she rears herself sublime in Air  She ranges ev'ry Plume with prudent Care  Tries if her Pinions can her Flight sustain  Then springs away and soars above the Main  BUT see the smoking firy Forge appears  Vulcanian  Sounds surprize our list'ning Ears  See busy Smiths around their Anvils sweat  Their brawny Arms the glowing Anchor beat  Alternately the chiming Hammers fall  And loud Notes echo thro' the sooty Hall  Such haply on the sounding Anvil rung  When first the Harp melodious TUBAL strung  As TUBALCAIN the ductile Metal wrought  And VULCAN's heav'nly Art to Mortals taught  The Brother pleas'd to hear his Hammers chime  Soon harmoniz'd their Notes to proper Time  Man's Bosom then sonorous Organs warm'd  The softer Lyre his gloomy Sorrows charm'd  While Tyrants Hearts unusual Pity found  And savage Tempers soften'd with the Sound  'TWAS now the Time when PHOEBUS' piercing Ray  Shot down direct and measur'd half the Day  A bold  Captain  Reddish  Commander of the  Amelia  Commander luckily we meet  Who courteously invites us to the Fleet  A Table elegantly spread we found  And loyal Healths the Captain pushes round  AUGUSTUS first and all the Royal Line  Give sweeter Flavour to the sparkling Wine  WAGER and NORRIS next who boldly reign  In floating Castles Monarchs of the Main  BUT now again our winged Sails we spread  Again we visit  Paulton  's sylvan Shade  Where parting from my Friend I mount my Steed  And o'er the Wilds of  Wellow  urge his Speed  Wilds which were lately sterile as the Coast  Where patient CATO march'd his fainting Host  Nor could the Swain explore a cooling Shade  When fervid PHOEBUS burnt his glowing Head  Till CHANDOS bad the dreary Desert smile  With verdant Groves and beautify'd the Soil  He said ten thousand Trees adorn'd the Plain  Ten thousand Shades delightful to the Swain  HENCE o'er the Plains and fruitful Fields I pass  Full forty Miles till  Witney  ends my Race  I visit here an elegant  Reverend Dr  Freind  Divine  In whom the Scholar Friend and Critic join  Who freely judges of an Author's Thoughts  Improves his Beauties and corrects his Faults  Severely kind and candidly severe  Polite as Courtiers and as Truth sincere  Who in MINERVA's Temple taught our Youth  The Path to Wisdom Virtue Honour Truth  Till having with a gen'rous Mind bestow'd  The Flow'r of all his Years in doing Good  Fatigu'd with Labours and with Age decay'd  Retires with Honour to the rural Shade  SO when the Prince of Rivers fruitful  Nile    Has flow'd and fatten'd all the  Memphian  Soil  Spent all the Richness that his Waves contain  Back to his Banks he draws his humid Train  I pay my Off'rings next at PHOEBUS' Shrine  Oxford  the Seat of all the tuneful Nine  Forgive me God of Verse who daring greet  Thy sacred Temples with unhallow'd Feet  As pious  Mussulmen  to  Mecca  roam  Zealous to worship at their Prophet's Tomb  So comes the Poet to thy rev'rend Fanes  Invoking thee to aid his humble Strains  O might a Spark of thy celestial Flame  But raise my Numbers equal to my Theme  ALFRED immortal in my Page should shine  ALFRED the  Monarch    Hero  and  Divine  Who having bravely all his Foes o'erthrown  Advanc'd thy Kingdom and confirm'd his own  Water'd his Realm with the  Pierian  Spring  Recall'd the banish'd Arts and bad the Muses sing  Then should my Numbers sound with  Founder of  New  College  WICKHAM's Praise  Nor less should  Founder of  CorpusChristi  College where the Author was kindly entertain'd  FOXE's Fame adorn my Lays  Whose pious Care the decent Fabric rear'd  Which kindly shelter'd the unworthy Bard  Nor the unworthy Bard should leave unpaid  The grateful Debt contracted while he stay'd  Thy Favours chiefly WINDER should be known  In lasting Numbers tuneful as thy own  Thee BODLEY would I sing who can refuse  A Verse to BODLEY Patron of the Muse  Whose letter'd Bounty to the World declares  The treasur'd Wisdom of three thousand Years  Nor should the Muse forget the  Wainflet  Bishop of  Winchester  Founder of  Magdalen  College where Mr  Addison  writ a Panegyric on Mr  Dryden  the first  English  Verses he ever made public  Prelate's Fame  Who grac'd the River with a stately Frame  Known by the flow'ry Meads which round it lie  And beauteous Walks that charm the Student's Eye  Where courtly ADDISON attun'd his Lays  And rais'd his own by singing DRYDEN's Praise  Hail happy Bard whose Genius still could shine  In ev'ry Art for ev'ry Art was thine  Whether thou didst the Critic's Pen engage  The Critic's Pen improv'd the Poet's Rage  Whether thou didst the Hero's Deeds rehearse  The Hero's Deeds shone brighter in thy Verse  Or did thy tragic Muse sublimely tell  How stubborn CATO for his Country fell  Parties no more retain'd their factious Hate  All pity'd CAESAR's honour'd CATO's Fate  Nor less thy soft diurnal Essays please  That Glass where ev'ry Fool his Folly sees  Where Virtue shines with such attractive Grace  She tempts the Vicious to

waft me to the peaceful happy Shore  Where thou immortal Bard art gone before  Then those who grant me not a Poet's Name  Shall own I left behind a better Fame  PENELOPE to ULYSSES  Paraphras'd from OVID  THESE Lines I send impatient of your Stay  To you my Lord who kill me with Delay  Yet crave not any Answer back beside  Yourself the best of Answers to your Bride  Sure  Troy  so hateful to the  Grecian  Dames  Is ruin'd now with dire consuming Flames  Tho' scarcely  Troy  nor all her King could boast  Was worth the Trouble which her Ruin cost  O had lewd PARIS sunk beneath the Tide  When o'er the Seas he sought the  Spartan  Bride  I had not then accus'd the ling'ring Day  Nor weav'd to charm the tedious Night away  Nor in the Bed deserted and forlorn  Lain weeping cold and comfortless till Morn  WHENE'ER of Dangers in your Camp I heard  Those Dangers threaten'd  you  I always fear'd  For Love like mine no cold Indiff'rence bears  It feeds on tim'rous Thoughts and anxious Cares  I fansy'd furious  Trojans  round thee came  And trembling ever dreaded HECTOR's Name  If any said ANTILOCHUS was slain  ANTILOCHUS was he who caus'd my Pain  Or if in borrow'd Arms PATROCLUS bled  I wept because his Craft no better sped  When  Rhodian  Blood had bath'd the  Lycian  Spear  The  Rhodian  Tlepolemus  Youth again renew'd my Care  In fine whatever  Grecian  Chief was kill'd  My fearful Heart like srigid Ice was chill'd  Lest flatt'ring Fame my doubtful Ears should cheat  And for my Lord's proclaim another's Fate  But Heav'n propitious to my chaste Desire  Preserv'd you safe and  Troy  consum'd with Fire  BUT now the other  Grecian  Chiefs return  And on their smoking Altars Off'rings burn  Their useless Arms they consecrate to Peace  And  Trojan  Spoils the  Grecian  Temples grace  Each youthful Bride some pleasing Gift affords  To welcome home their safereturning Lords  Their safereturning Lords in Songs of Joy  Resound the vanquish'd Fates of ruin'd  Troy  The wond'ring Sages crowd around to hear  The trembling Girls admire the Tales of War  The Wives stand list'ning while their Husbands tell  How  Greece  had conquer'd and how  Ilion  fell  One stains a Table with the purple Draught  And shews the furious Battles which you fought  Paints with the Wine which from the Glass he pours  Camps Rivers Hills and all the  Trojan  Tow'rs  And This says he is the  Sigean  Plain  And here the silver  Simois  rolls his Train  There stood old PRIAM's stately Palace here  ACHILLES pitch'd his Tent ULYSSES there  Here mangled HECTOR dreadful in his Fall  Affrights the Steeds that drag him round the Wall  Your Son who sent by me to NESTOR's Court  To seek his Father brought me this Report  From NESTOR's Mouth and how the  Thracian  Lord  In Sleep became a Victim to your Sword  How DOLON fell into your crafty Snare  But O ULYSSES you too boldly dare  Too fearless thro' the Camp of Foes you rove  Mindful of Wiles forgetful of your Love  Slaying so many in the gloomy Night  One Friend alone to aid you in the Fight  It was not thus you rashly us'd to go  Among the midnight Terrors of the Foe  Fondly of me you formerly have thought  With Prudence acted and with Caution fought  Heav'n knows with Fear my trembling Bosom beat  To hear my Son your daring Deeds relate  Till told how you victoriously return'd  Safe to your Camp with  Thracian  Spoils adorn'd  BUT what avails it me your Arms have thrown  Troy  's stately Walls and lofty Turrets down  As when they stood if I am robb'd of thee  Troy  's fall'n to  others  standing still to  me    To  others  who with captive Oxen toil  To turn the Glebe and till the  Trojan  Soil  And while with crooked Ploughs they discompose  Th'illbury'd Ashes of their slaughter'd Foes  While  Phrygian  Fields grown fat with native Blood  Bear fruitful Crops where stately  Ilion  stood  While verdant Harvests hide their ruin'd Wall  I mourn my absent Lord who wrought its Fall  Nor can I know the Land where you reside  Nor who nor what detains you from your Bride  WHATEVER Sailers on our Coast appear  Hopeful to find some Tidings of my Dear  I fly to them and ask 'em o'er and o'er  If e'er they saw you on some foreign Shore  Then to their Hands a Letter I impart  To give it you the Partner of my Heart  If Chance or Destiny should ever prove  So kind to lead them to my absent Love  WE sought for you at ancient NESTOR's Court  But sought in vain we heard no true Report  We sent to ask the  Spartans  too but they  Knew not the Climate where you ling'ring stay  O had APOLLO sav'd his sacred Town  Ye Gods why did I ever wish it down  If  that  were standing and ULYSSES there  I nothing but the Chance of War should fear  I should not then be singly curst to cry  Others would fear the War no less than I  But now a thousand Whimsies feed my Care  Nor know I what to hope or what to fear  Yet fearing all that Fancy can suggest  Unnumber'd Troubles rack my anxious Breast  Upon the Land whatever Dangers reign  I fear those Dangers make you there remain  Upon the Seas whatever Storms increase  I fear those Storms detain you on the Seas  While thus my foolish Thoughts uncertain rove  Perhaps you revel with a foreign Love  Perhaps you ridicule your Bride at home  Tell how she spins or drudges in the Loom  Suspicious Thoughts that vex my jealous Mind  Begone and vanish into empty Wind  If cruel Fate did not obstruct the Way  My Lord would never make so long Delay  Your long Delay my Father often blames  And often chides me for my constant Flames  My constant Flames shall ever true remain  Let Fathers chide and Suiters court in vain  At length my Sire who finds he can't remove  My Faith from you nor shake my settled Love  Remits his Anger soften'd with my Pray'rs  Yet still a Crowd of Suiters teaze my Ears  From various Realms they come to seek your Crown  And feast and reign securely in your Throne  'Twould tire me ev'n to count their Number o'er  MEDON PISANDER and a hundred more  All bent on Love and Robbers of the State  And All by your pernicious Absence great  To crown your Shame the Beggar IRUS preys  Upon your Sheep and all the fattest slays  And ev'n your Shepherd faithless to his Lord  Slaughters your Lambs to grace the Suiter's Board  Nor have we Strength their Rapine to oppose  For how can Three resist so many Foes  Your feeble Wife your Father worn with Age  Your tender Son too weak to check their Rage  For whom they lately crafty Ambush laid  And menac'd Death on his devoted Head  When mocking all their Stratagems he crost  The Seas to seek you on the  Pylian  Coast  O may the Gods extend his vital Date  And guard his Life till ours submit to Fate  So may he close our Eyes with decent Care  Such is your Servant's such his Nurse's Pray'r  SINCE then your aged Father feeble grown  Amidst your Foes cannot defend your Crown  Your Wife too weak to chase the Foes away  Your Son too young to bear the Regal Sway  Haste haste ULYSSES to your Royal Seat  For you alone can cure our troubled State  Think of your Son who wants you to inspire  His Soul with all the Virtues of his Sire  Think on the Brink of Fate your Father lies  Return my Lord return and close his Eyes  Think of your faithful Wife whose youthful Face  At your Departure blush'd with blooming Grace  But now I blush with blooming Grace no more  Tears for your Absence cloud my Beauty o'er  O may you soon return before I prove  An ancient Dame unworthy of your  Love  An EPIGRAM  Words are but Wind  Tale of a Tub  IF Words are Wind as some allow  No Promises can bind  Since breaking of the strictest Vow  Is only breaking Wind  A  Poem  on Her MAJESTY's  BirthDay  O You the MONARCH's Bliss the Muse's Friend  Accept the Tribute Duty bids me send  'Tis what the Bard should long before have paid  But fearful to aspire has long delay'd  PHOEBUS alone can PHOEBUS' Chariot guide  The Youth who dar'd to drive it daring dy'd  My humble Muse can humble Subjects treat  But trembles to attempt a Theme so great  Yet warm with Gratitude would fain display  Her Zeal to You on this auspicious Day  To You whose gracious Goodness plumes her Wings  By whom she lives by whom inspir'd she sings  Long may she celebrate your sacred BIRTH  Long may You stay from Heav'n to bless the Earth  To chear the Royal Sov'reign of our ISLE  Increase his Joys or soften all his Toil  Who now while Death in purple Triumph reigns  And sanguine Floods pollute the distant Plains  Watchful o'er  Britain  's Fate employs his Care  Or wisely to avert or bravely meet the War  O glorious QUEEN by Nature form'd to bring  The sweetest Comfort to the justest KING  Let proud Oppressors who abuse their Pow'r  Hear groaning Subjects curse their natal Hour  You on that happy Hour may justly feast  Your Soul with Thoughts of making Thousands blest  Whose godlike Bounties to the Wretched show  You're only pow'rful to relieve their Woe  WHAT tho' the Muse old Annals should explore  Mark all our Queens and trace their Virtues o'er  Where could she find so much exalted Sense  Nobly employ'd like yours in Truth's Defense  You strive to make the Seeds of Virtue grow  To spread the Light which Heav'n reveal'd below  Yet free from superstitious Zeal incline  To make the Rays of Moral Goodness shine  Supporting those who firm to Truth defend  That first fix'd Law on which all Laws depend  BENEATH your Influence Art and Science rear  Their sacred Heads and flourish by your Care  This Truth let  Oxford  's pompous Dome proclaim  Which boasts the Honour of a  Queen  's College  Royal Name  Lately your Bard survey'd the graceful Scene  Rising with Bounties of a gen'rous QUEEN  O had the Muse there fledg'd her infant Wing  And early tasted of that learned Spring  She then had soar'd in more heroic Lays  In more majestic Numbers sung your Praise  But fearful now must quit the glorious Theme  Must leave the Architect to speak your Fame  His Art shall there another  Athens  shew  And there another Guardian PALLAS You  FELIX and CONSTANCE  A POEM taken from BOCCACE  To the Right Honourable the Countess of POMFRET  BLOWN on the rolling Surface of the Deep  The mourning Maid at length reclines to Sleep  While conscious Visions labour in her Breast  And airy Spectres discompose her Rest  Sometimes she seems upon her native Shore  Bless'd with the beauteous Youth as heretofore  Hears him converse while from his tuneful Tongue  Melodious Sense in melting Music rung  Sometimes she finds or seems at least to find  His shatter'd Vessel forc'd before the Wind  With foaming Waves and furious Tempests tost  The Mast and broken Sails and Sailers lost  Sometimes her Dream in frightful Forms display'd  A Crowd of Martyrs cruel  Love  had made  Lamenting THISBE's Shade before her stands  Shews her capacious Wound and purple Hands  Now Lyric SAPPHO in the Tide expires  Now faithful PORCIA eats the living Fires  At length awaking from her Dream she hears  A  Latian  Voice which thus salutes her Ears  UNHAPPY  Christian  Maid for such at least  You by your decent Habit seem exprest  Say whence you came and hither how convey'd  Expos'd to Sea without the Seaman's Aid  SOON as the Nymph her native Language hears  Her frighted Soul was fill'd with Doubts and Fears  She thought the adverse Wind or refluent Main  Had forc'd her back to  Liparis  again  Till starting up a spacious Land she spies  Barbarian Caves and Cots her Sight surprize  She sees a Matron on the neighb'ring Strand  Nor knows the Matron nor the neighb'ring Land  O whither whither am I blown she cries  What Dens and Caves appear before my Eyes  And who inhabit 'em or Beasts of Prey  Or Men less kind and crueller than they  To whom the Matron Fly nor dare to trust  The faithless People of this hated Coast  Here Sailers oft their hapless Fate deplore  Who scape the Seas are wreck'd upon the Shore  For when the forceful Wind and foaming Deep  To this inhuman Coast impel the Ship  Around the Beach the rude Barbarians stray  Destroy the Mariners and seize their Prey  By others Death they keep themselves alive  Subsist by Rapine and by Ruin thrive  UNHAPPY Fate the mourning Nymph reply'd  O had I perish'd in the safer Tide  For much I fear the Land I now survey  Dooms me to greater Evils than the Sea  And yet what greater Ills can Fate provide  Than thus to seek for Death and be deny'd  Not so my FELIX scap'd the raging Waves  Him NEPTUNE sunk and me unkindly saves  Saves only to increase my former Woes  To fall perhaps by more ungen'rous Foes  Or to indulge some lustful Tyrant's Will  But O ye Heav'ns avert the fatal Ill  Protect my Honour in this foreign Coast  The only Blessing which I have not lost  THE list'ning Matron wonders with Surprize  Nor hears unmov'd the weeping Damsel's Cries  But leads her to her neighb'ring Cottage where  She chears her fainting Soul with homely Fare  Condoles her Grief and begs her to disclose  Her Country Cares and Cause of all her Woes  Excited by her Words the pensive Maid  Preludes with Sighs and thus reluctant said  O hospitable Dame why would you move  A Wretch to tell a Tale of hapless Love  Which in relating must renew my Grief  Nor can I hope nor you bestow Relief  Yet since you seem a Partner of my Care  'Tis just a Partner know the Weight I bear  NOT far from  Aetna  's flaming Mount I came  From  Liparis  and CONSTANCE is my Name  Great Honours and Estates my Sire possess'd  And O too much to make his Daughter bless'd  I once with Fame and Fortune was supply'd  Nor envy'd Empresses their Pomp and Pride  Now like a Meteor fallen from its Height  My Glory's vanish'd and extinct my Light  Full twenty Years in Happiness I pass'd  And ev'ry Year was happier than the last  Young FELIX then his Love began to show  Young FELIX was the Cause of all my Woe  A beauteous Youth endow'd with manly Grace  But far his noble Soul excell'd his Face  And tho' his niggard Fate had Wealth deny'd  The Want of Wealth by Virtue was supply'd  Two Years to win my doubtful Heart he strove  Two Years my doubtful Heart declin'd his Love  Yet still he press'd me with his am'rous Tale  Nor found at length 'twas fruitless to assail  For by degrees insensibly I came  To first approve and then indulge his Flame  Nor could his Suit nor would his Vows reprove  I heard with Joy nor thought it Sin to love  Till in my Breast imperious CUPID reign'd  Alas how easy  Love  a Conquest gain'd  And now my Reason check'd my Will no more  But fed the Flame it strove to quench before  Yet durst not an immodest Thought approve  Love  rul'd my  Heart  but  Honour  rul'd my  Love  I scorn'd to stain my Virtue with a King  As much my Lover scorn'd so  mean  a thing  What could we do What cannot  Love  inspire  The Youth reveals his Passion to my Sire  And in such melting Accents made it known  As might have mov'd all Fathers but my own  But proudly he my Lover's Suit repell'd  And frowning thus our mutual Ruin seal'd  No more presumptuous Youth thy Passion name  Suppress the Sparks before they rise to Flame  How dar'st thou vulgar Wretch ignobly born  My Daughter's Scandal and her Father's Scorn  Aspire to wed so far above thy Fate  He sternly said and forc'd him from his Gate  O  Avarice  what Evils dost thou cause  Breaking the Bands of Love and Nature's Laws  Go hungry God and rule the Narrowsoul'd  Collect and guard their curst bewitching Gold  Fit Province for thy Reign too mean to prove  The Charms of Nuptial Life and Joys of Love  Ah what avails to gain a pompous Name  With boasted Titles of paternal Fame  Deriv'd from Ancestors of noble Blood  Things common to the Vicious and the Proud  Refulgent Equipage and gaudy Shows  Fictitious Ornaments of real Woes  If Love be absent Pomp and worldly Gain  But gild our Cares and varnish o'er our Pain  O had my cruel Father thought like me  I ne'er had prov'd the Dangers of the Sea  Nor ever wander'd here a banish'd Maid  And O dear FELIX thou hadst not been dead  So speaks the trembling Nymph and while she speaks  The pearly Torrents stream adown her Cheeks  Cold clammy Sweats and throbbing Sighs arise  Slow moves the Blood and dizzy roll her Eyes  So much affected with her Lover's Fate  She struggled groan'd and fainted from her Seat  Her Hostess straight a grateful Cordial sought  And to her Lips applies the chearful Draught  Washing her Temples with reviving Oil  The vital Spirits answer to her Toil  The purple Tide begins to roll again  Again diffuses Life thro' ev'ry Vein  And now she sighing rais'd her drooping Head  And Is my Death she cries again delay'd  Why did you check me on the Brink of Fate  Better the Soul had fled her loathsome Seat  Death is the only Good I wish to know  End of my Pain and Period of my Woe  To whom replies the Dame Unhappy Fair  Rely on Heav'n nor let your Soul despair  Teach me to give your troubled Heart Relief  Or teach me how at least to share your Grief  Your mournful Story much affects my Mind  Yet something seems remaining still behind  O much CONSTANTIA says remains to come  The fatal Part that finishes my Doom  For when my FELIX FELIX now no more  Was banish'd from my haughty Father's Door  Not able to obtain me for his Bride  Nor willing to resign me tho' deny'd  Hope from Despair his daring Soul conceives  A Bark he builds to plough the briny Waves  Then call'd a few Domestics to his Aid  Embrac'd me in his Arms and sighing said  O Thou for ever dear for ever blest  At once the Joy and Trouble of my Breast  Since Poverty expels me from thy Arms  Since Wealth alone is worthy of thy Charms  I swear by all the mighty Pow'rs above  Sad Fate that drives me from the Nymph I love  To try my Fortune on remoter Shores  And seek the Gold thy Sire so much adores  Perhaps the Planets unpropitious here  In other Climes may kinder Aspects wear  May lead me where the rocky Di'monds lie  Or where the golden Mines may Wealth supply  If not the last sad Pleasure is to die  SUCH was the fatal Vow he rashly made  O fatal Vow and fatally obey'd  Struck dumb my Tears the want of Words supply'd  His mixt with mine increas'd the pearly Tide  Yet lest I should his Resolution shake  He rush'd away and mounted on the Deck  His hasty Crew expand the swelling Sails  Strong rolls the Sea before impulsive Gales  The crooked Keel the frothy Flood divides  Swift flies the Ship and rushes thro' the Tides  MY Lover long my gazing Eyes pursue  As long my Lover kept me in his View  Reluctant so departing Souls prepare  To wing their doubtful Flight they know not where  Reluctant so expiring Bodies lie  Nor willing these to stay nor those to fly  TWICE twenty Days I spent in fruitless Tears  Before the fatal Tidings reach'd my Ears  How FELIX sailing o'er the watry Way  Was wreck'd on Rocks and perish'd in the Sea  O then what Trouble Grief and anxious Care  Confus'd my Soul and bent it to Despair  I curs'd the Cause that forc'd him to expire  O Heav'n forgive me if I curs'd my Sire  I fled his House and sought the lonely Grove  The gloomy Witness of my former  Love    Where once resolv'd to seek the Shades below  I drew the Knife to strike the mortal Blow  Till Piety the cruel Thought supprest  And check'd the  Roman  Courage of my Breast  I trembling saw two doubtful Paths nor knew  Which Path was best to shun or which pursue  Opposing Passions in my Bosom strove  And  Conscience  now prevail'd and now my  Love  As when the Wind and Tide a Contest make  The Sailer trembling sees his Vessel shake  This way and that and both by turns reclin'd  As swells the Surge or blows the furious Wind  So was my Soul with diff'rent Notions sway'd  Of this of that of both and all afraid  Ah why should Mortals of their  Reason  boast  Which most deserts 'em when they want it most  For when the troubled Mind's confus'd with Pain  'Tis but an  Ignisfatuus  of the Brain  Which if our wand'ring Souls from  Virtue  stray  But leads us more and more from  Virtue  's Way  So led it me to stem the devious Tide  And seek for Death where wretched FELIX dy'd  NOT distant far a fishing Vessel stood  Nor wholly on the Land nor in the Flood  Arriv'd to this I row'd it from the Shore  And bent on Death the Tide I now explore  Expecting soon the friendlyfurious Wave  Would give my Troubles and myself a Grave  But when I saw the Billows round me flow  The boundless Skies above and Seas below  Scar'd with the Terrors of the watry Space  I wrapt my Mantle round my tim'rous Face  Then lay me down to all the Dangers blind  Chance  was my  Compass  and my  Pilot    Wind  Blown here and there I floated on the Deep  Which rock'd my Eyes but not my Fears asleep  For now my dreaming Soul in Fancy's Maze  A thousand tragic airy Ghosts surveys  Which flutter'd round me and reproaching said  Die Coward follow FELIX to the Shade  Why wouldst thou wish to live now  he  is dead  But when at length your friendly Voice I heard  My Vision ceas'd the Spectres disappear'd  Thus have I told but can't dispel my Care  For who can conquer  Love  or cure  Despair  THUS she and thus CAPRESA spake again  So was she call'd who wak'd her on the Main  Unhappy Nymph compose your troubled Mind  Nor doubt the gracious Guide of human Kind  That GOD who sav'd you from the foamy Wave  Will doubtless guard the Life he deign'd to save  Vouchsafe to take the Counsel I can lend  At  Susa  Heav'n has blest me with a Friend  Much fam'd for Wealth for pious Actions more  No Husband and no Children but the Poor  Let me conduct you to her friendly Gate  Too small my Cottage for a Guest so great  She will protect you from  Barbarian  Foes  With prudent Counsel mitigate your Woes  And charm your ruffled Soul to soft Repose  BLEST Partner of my Grief the Damsel said  Some Angel surely sent you to my Aid  For now some dawning Rays of Hope appear  That chase away the Clouds of dark Despair  This Pause of Pain and Interval of Grace  Shall be employ'd in Search of future Peace  Then guide and guard me to your noble Friend  So may you never want this Aid you lend  And as we travel deign to let me know  To whom so many Thanks I justly owe  What hapless Fortune cast you on this Land  What Occupation here employs your Hand  Sweet Conversation may suspend my Care  Dispel my Grief or make it less severe  So shall I easier reach the neighb'ring Town  And list'ning to your Fate forget my own  THUS she and thus the pensive Dame replies  With briny Drops distilling from her Eyes  Fain would I lovely Nymph suspend your Care  Dispel your Grief or make it less severe  But were I all my Fortune to explain  'Twould not alleviate but increase your Pain  For in your Soul such Sparks of Nature glow  As make you share your Neighbour's Joy or Woe  The  Christian  Faith I secretly embrace  Tho' doom'd to dwell among a  Pagan  Race  Trepanum  wasted all my Bloom of Life  Where long I liv'd a Farmer's happy Wife  My careful loving Husband till'd the Soil  Nor was the Field ungrateful to his Toil  For ev'ry Summer CERES crown'd the Plain  Each Autumn fill'd the Barn with golden Grain  So thick the verdant Harvest yearly stood  The Meadows seem'd to groan beneath their Load  Our fleecy Flocks were fruitful of their Young  Hail were our Oxen and our Horses strong  Nor did our Kine of milky Produce fail  But with distended Udders fill'd the Pail  'Twas then alas how often have I cry'd  I would not wish to be a Monarch's Bride  When all around my little Infants came  Hung on my Knees and lisp'd their  Mama  's Name  Or met their Father with the Ev'ning Ray  Embrac'd his Neck and kiss'd his Cares away  Soon as their riper Age could Labour bear  We sent 'em forth to feed the fleecy Care  Where often have we spent the Summer's Day  Charm'd to behold the wanton Cattle's Play  What Pleasure 'twas to see the skipping Lambs  What Music when they bleated for their Dams  We thought our Joys could never be increas'd  Love Peace and Plenty join'd to make us bless'd  But see how  Fortune  holds her fickle Reign  She raises up to tumble down again  For now our Thread of Happiness was spun  The Gains of twenty Years were lost in one  'Twas in the Season when the verdant Mead  Begins to ask the Mower's crooked Blade  Before the Wheat receives the yellow Stain  Or milky Juice is harden'd into Grain  A Gale of Poison baleful EURUS cast  The vernal Product sicken'd with the Blast  Our Meadows straight a saffron Scene disclose  Our infant Apples quit the blighted Boughs  Pease Wheat and Barley wither'd in the Fields  And Nature one abortive Harvest yields  Nor stopt it here the flying Plague began  To spread the Bane in Beasts and thence to Man  First dy'd our Sheep upon the russet Plain  Next swell'd our Oxen with a fatal Blain  Here tumbles o'er her Meat the moping Cow  There drops the panting Horse before the Plough  At length the dire Contagion spread so wide  My Virgin Children made the Tomb their Bride  This Nature boreBut when our Landlord sent  His Officers to seize my Lord for Rent  And he to shun the Prison flies the Shore  Lists on the Sea to tug the lab'ring Oar  I wept I rav'd I curs'd the baleful Air  And fled my native Land but not my Care  Thus banish'd here a Widow and a Wife  Condemn'd to suffer not enjoy a Life  I toil for those who catch the finny Prey  The Toils are great but very small the Pay  Their scaly Fry to Market oft I bear  Oft in the Ocean wash their thready Snare  And then was washing when with great Surprize  You and your floating Vessel met my Eyes  NOW Heav'n defend us both the Nymph reply'd  And can such Rage in  Christian  Minds reside  What could the curst inhuman Tyrant wrest  Thy tender Husband from thy loving Breast  When all thy Wealth was lost thy Children dead  O  Virtue Virtue  whither art thou fled  Why must such Evils on the Guiltless flow  Ye Heav'ns is Innocence rewarded so  SO spake the Nymph her Friend no more replies  For now PRISCILLA's Dome attracts their Eyes  Approaching to her friendly Gate they found  The gen'rous Lady dealing Alms around  To needy Souls a hapless helpless Crowd  Who daily bless'd her Hand for daily Food  When thus CAPRESA Hail for ever bless'd  'Tis Godlike thus to succour the Distress'd  Yet none of these who claim your  Christian  Aid  Deserves it more than this unhappy Maid  Who once was bless'd with Fame and Riches too  Tho' fickle Fortune now is turn'd her Foe  Unlike the Mendicants who daily share  Your friendly Bounty and maternal Care  TO whom the Lady with a gracious Look  That seem'd to breathe Compassion while she spoke  Sure Decency forbids a Guest so great  Should undistinguish'd with the Vulgar eat  No deck my Table with the choicest Fare  The Nymph with me a kind Repast shall share  For by her Looks if Truth may be divin'd  That lovely Body cloaths a lovely Mind  SHE said and CONSTANCE low Obeisance made  Then gladly follow'd where PRISCILLA led  Within the Gate a spacious Room she found  Whose Walls were beautify'd with Tap'stry round  Where pious Tales appear'd so lively wrought  The Work seem'd vital and the Figures Thought  Here in the Shade the  Jewish  Patriarch stood  Feasting the Sons of Heav'n with earthly Food  While there the good  Samaritan  confest  His Kindness and reproach'd the cruel  Priest    With many more a charitable Band  The skilful Labour of PRISCILLA's Hand  HITHER the Dame convey'd a sweet Repast  Rich Meats and rosy Wines the Table grac'd  They eat they drank in pleasing Converse join'd  And chear'd at once the Body and the Mind  The Call of Nature being soon supprest  Thus spake the Lady to her youthful Guest  SAY lovely Stranger for I long to know  So may propitious Heav'n remove thy Woe  Whence thus reduc'd By Famine Sword or Fire  What Sire thy Beauty boasts what Land thy Sire  Perhaps some Princess banish'd from her Home  Thus condescends to grace my rustic Dome  If so I greatly fear my homely Feast  Has been unworthy of my Royal Guest  SHE said the Nymph unfolds her Tale again  The prudent Dame attempts to sooth her Pain  And thus reply'd Tho' weighty are your Woes  The weightiest Ill with Patience lighter grows  Then bear with Patience all that Heav'n design'd  Whose Ways are just tho' difficult to find  Plann'd for the gen'ral Good of Human Kind  God's Paths in winding Mazes often lie  Too intricate for feeble Reason's Eye  Most regular when in Confusion lost  Most constant when they seem to vary most  Perhaps his Mercy forc'd you thus to roam  To shun a more unhappy Fate at home  For with one Evil he removes a worse  And blesses oft with what we think a Curse  Then let your Soul at Fortune not repine  But trust in Heav'n's Protection next in mine  In me you still shall find a faithful Friend  With whom in time your Troubles all may end  But since you now are harass'd out with Woes  Refresh your weary Soul with sweet Repose  And when you wake at Morning may you find  Heav'n's balmy Comfort heal your wounded Mind  THUS chear'd the Nymph obsequiously withdrew  And bath'd her Cares in Sleep's refreshing Dew  Till PHOEBUS rising from the Shades of Night  With rosy Keys unlock'd the Gates of Light  Bright as his Beams arose the beauteous Maid  And to her Patroness returning said  WHAT Thanks propitious Lady shall I give  For all the Godlike Bounties I receive  O let my  Silence  thank you for I know  Words  can't express the Gratitude I owe  To whom replies the venerable Dame  No other Thanks but Gratitude I claim  The Terms of Charity are never hard  Love and Compassion are their own Reward  A Soul that succours Virtue when distrest  Can with Reflection make a noble Feast  Which nourishes the Mind and overpays  A gen'rous Deed with selfapproving Praise  SUCH was their Converse till domestic Care  Invites PRISCILLA from the youthful Fair  Who sat in pensive Solitude and strove  To soften or suspend the Pains of Love  At length the Linen on her Knee she spread  And with her Needle work'd the docile Thread  Young THISBE's Fate she first began to frame  But soon commits her Labour to the Flame  Next drew she HERO sinking in the Main  Then raz'd the finish'd Image out again  Both these displeas'd her tho' judicious Art  And Rays of Nature shone in ev'ry Part  At length her own unhappy Tale she chose  And lively paints the Scene of all her Woes  Her charming FELIX first the Linen grac'd  By whom her Father frowning stern she plac'd  Her Lover's Parting next to these appears  But weeping here she soil'd her Work with Tears  Next on the Seas she drew her floating Ship  Next her own Boat slowwand'ring o'er the Deep  By these she fix'd CAPRESA on the Strand  Who wak'd her first and welcom'd her to Land  The good PRISCILLA last employ'd her Art  Whose Aspect spoke the Bounty of her Heart  Her friendly Roof a Refuge for the Poor  The Horn of Plenty pendent o'er the Door  Diffusing Blessings still and still increasing more  All these confest such Beauty Skill and Care  Not HELEN better wove the  Trojan  War  While HECTOR PARIS and their Martial Train  With  Grecian  Heroes battled on the Plain  HERE let us leave the lovely Nymph awhile  To pass her tedious Hours in pleasing Toil  Her absent Lover now my Song pursues  Whose valiant Deeds require a nobler Muse  SWIFTPINION'D FAME which often babbling flies  To bear unwelcome Truths and oft'ner Lyes  Had spread the ductile Error far and wide  How wand'ring FELIX perish'd in the Tide  But FELIX safely reach'd the  Thunic  Port  And soon arriv'd to Honours in the Court  His Wisdom there the wisest Peers excell'd  His Valour more surpass'd 'em in the Field  When first he to the Royal Palace came  An Accident occurr'd to raise his Fame  A noble Lord there was of great Renown  Rebell'd against the King and claim'd his Crown  Great Preparations made he for the Fight  Nor less the Monarch to defend his Right  But summon'd all to meet the daring Foe  Whose Strength could wield a Sword or bend a Bow  And promis'd to reward their Martial Care  With Honours equal to their Deeds in War  Now rings the Region with the Foe's Alarms  Terrific shines the Field with burnish'd Arms  The Martial Trumpet sounding from afar  With dreadful Notes proclaims approaching War  The Royal Army valiant FELIX join'd  Intrepid Courage animates his Mind  Fix'd in the Front the Foe he bravely dares  Like PALLAS prudent and as bold as MARS  Say Muse What Goddess that tremendous Hour  Aided the Youth with such unusual Pow'r  Bright VENUS conscious of the Lover's Smart  Sharpen'd his Sword and pointed ev'ry Dart  Fierce as a Lion thro' the Lines he sprung  And forc'd his Foes like trembling Stags along  As when resistless Winds rush o'er the Deep  And from its Anchor force the driving Ship  Or furiously against the Woodland roar  The leafy Harvest tumbling flies before  So rush'd the Hero on the adverse Band  So fled the Legions from his pow'rful Hand  Till soon the rebel Lord he Pris'ner made  And to the King his captive Prize convey'd  Now reaps the Youth the Glory of his Toil  To him the Monarch gives the Martial Spoil  Rewards his Valour with a noble Post  And makes him First Commander of his Host  Thus quickly FELIX gain'd a deathless Name  Thus was his Labour crown'd with Wealth and Fame  But Wealth and Fame insipid Things appear  To give them Taste he wants the lovely Fair  The lovely Fair opprest with equal Grief  To make her happy wants the glorious Chief  HIS Fame which soon at  Susa  was reveal'd  Heroic Actions seldom lie conceal'd  With pleasing Wonder struck CONSTANTIA's Ears  And fill'd her doubtful Soul with Hopes and Fears  For tho' the wise PRISCILLA often strove  With prudent Counsel to suppress her Love  Her Love was only lessen'd not supprest  But glows again again distracts her Breast  AS when in rural Cots the Flames aspire  And lab'ring Peasants quench the mounting Fire  If chance a latent Spark remain behind  In heapy Ashes fann'd with ambient Wind  The Fires again with former Fury rise  Flame thro' the Roof and flash into the Skies  So in her Bosom glows the am'rous Fire  And fills her tender Soul with soft Desire  And is my FELIX yet alive she says  And is he crown'd with Wealth and deathless Praise  No no I fear the flatt'ring Tale deceives  Methinks I see him plunging in the Waves  Ah why ye Heav'ns are feeble Mortals curst  In Things uncertain to believe the worst  No rather let me seek the  Thunic  Court  There with my Eyes confirm the blest Report  Hope  flies before and points the pleasing Way  Love  urges on and  Love  I must obey  SO saying to PRISCILLA straight she came  And with her Thoughts acquaints the pious Dame  The pious Dame with tender Pity sway'd  Approves the Passion of the loving Maid  And with CAPRESA guards her to the Place  Resolv'd herself to view the Hero's Face  The Hero meets 'em at the Regal Gate  Array'd in Armour formidably great  For on that Morning by the King's Command  The Chief was to review the Martial Band  His studded Chariot darted Splendor round  His stately Coursers neighing paw'd the Ground  The nodding Plumes around his Temples wave  With awful Grace and beautifully brave  He knew th'approaching Nymph but in Surprize  The joyous Stream descended from his Eyes  The Nymph beheld the weeping Chief nor knew  For what he wept nor whom she came to view  His Martial Dress bespangled o'er with Gold  The dreadful  Warrior  not the  Lover  told  But when he cast the Helmet from his Head  And thro' the Gates the blushing Damsel led  She knew her Lover clasp'd him to her Breast  While silent Eloquence her Joy confest  The conscious Pains an absent Lover bears  Despair  fallacious  Hope  and anxious  Fears    For want of Words were painted with their Tears  And when at length their crystal Sluices ceas'd  The joyful Hero thus the Nymph address'd  YE Gods and have I then my Charmer found  And are my Labours thus completely crown'd  Yes let me clasp thee to my longing Arms  Drink in thy Breath and feed upon thy Charms  As widow'd Turtles roving round the Fields  Thro' all the fruitful Stores which Nature yields  Curst in the midst of Plenty cannot eat  But starve lamenting for their absent Mate  Thus have I been with Fame and Riches grac'd  Yet wanted thee to give my Riches Taste  But say how came this  Wealth  I wanted most  What brought my  Love  to this  Barbarian  Coast  HE said and now the joyful Damsel spake  The Dangers which she suffer'd for his sake  Shews him the Dame who found her on the Tide  PRISCILLA too who all her Wants supply'd  Then prostrate on her Knees before him bends  And begs him to reward her faithful Friends  The grateful Chief by native Goodness sway'd  Embrac'd 'em both and soon the Nymph obey'd  But first before his Royal Master came  And begs he may resign his Post of Fame  At which the Monarch frowns with awful Eyes  Till FELIX straight who saw his Passion rise  Falls on the Ground and to his Master shows  The various Scene of all his am'rous Woes  This heard the King resumes his former Grace  Love tun'd his Soul and smooth'd his ruffled Face  He rais'd the Hero bids the Nymph appear  The Nymph approach'd him with a modest Fear  Before his awful Throne submiss she fell  And to him straight unfolds th'amazing Tale  Mute on the Ground awhile he fix'd his Eyes  Then Is the Force of  Love  so great he cries  We falsely  Man  the World's Commander call  Thou  mightier Monarch  Love  commandest All  Young AMMON's Self could not thy Pow'r confine  The  World his  Subject was but  He  was  thine  THEN smiling thus he chear'd the trembling Fair  Henceforward lovely Nymph dismiss thy Care  For since thy Love has conquer'd Wind and Sea  Curst be the King that's crueller than they  Let HYMEN straight confirm the Marriage Ties  Thou justly hast deserv'd the Nuptial Prize  THUS said he crown'd the Hero's Martial Care  With Riches far superior to the Fair  Due Thanks return'd they to PRISCILLA came  Bestowing Gifts and Honours on the Dame  CAPRESA next with Age and Labour worn  In comely Robes the grateful Pair adorn  With ample Wealth her former Bliss restor'd  And from the Seas redeem'd her Nuptial Lord  Her Nuptial Lord again enjoys his Wife  Again delightful Freedom crowns his Life  Till  Nature  calls him to resign his Breath  In honourable Age and peaceful Death  THIS done the loving Couple quit the Shore  And joyfully the destin'd Port explore  While sportive NEREIDS round their Vessel play  And wanton CUPIDS hail 'em on their Way  Rough THETIS' Self assumes a pleasing Smile  Glad to return 'em to their native Soil  Where sacred HYMEN join'd their mutual Hands  And Heav'n indulgent bless'd their Nuptial Bands  Ad JOANNEM MILTONUM

check the Reins of Friendship till you prove  What sways the Person Interest or Love  AVOID the Fop impertinently vain  And shun the Slave who flatters you for Gain  Beware of him who sells you for a Jest  But most of all beware the leaky Breast  Who hopes to keep his Wine the Season round  Must first be sure his Cask is sweet and sound  Nor should a formal Fool your Friendship claim  Tho' Wealth

zealous for your Friends whene'er you know  Their Reputation censur'd by a Foe  Nor with a faint Excuse degrade your Friends  The Man who coldly praises discommends  Or are they justly censur'd for a Crime  Reprove them mildly at some proper Time  In private chide all Failings which you find  In public praise the Beauties of their Mind  Place all their Virtues in the clearest Light  Omit their Faults or touch them very slight  As Painters when they draw a beauteous Face  Contract a Blemish heighten ev'ry Grace  NEITHER let Passion Pride or private Ends  Or changing Fortune make you change

prevail  When greedy Ears devour their flatt'ring Tale  While THRASO loves to hear his Praises told  GNATHO will  give  him  Praise  and  take  his  Gold  But you who walk by Wisdom's safer Rules  For 'twere but Labour lost to counsel Fools  Detest the Wretch who ne'er can Courage find  To speak the genuine Dictates of his Mind  But like the  Syrens  sweet pernicious Song  At once would charm and ruin with his Tongue  YET some there are in social Bands ally'd  Who with blunt Truths err on the other Side  Void of Goodnature and Goodbreeding too  They sourly censure ev'ry thing you do  O never flatter ev'n a Monarch's Pride  Nor with the Sternness of a  Cynic  chide  But when you would an erring Friend reprove  Let gentle Cautions shew the Motive's Love  Do not begin with Rashness to exclaim  But rather hint the Fault before you blame  'Tis not enough your Admonition's just  Prudence must guide it or the Labour's lost  Friends should allure and charm us into Sense  Harsh Counsels not reform but give Offence  Nature impatient of severe Reproof  Loves mild Instruction but abhors the rough  As Fruits and Flow'rs improve with gentle Rain  But fade if rapid Storms o'erflow the Plain  SOME Men are Friends when Fortune fills the Sails  And wafts you on with favourable Gales  But quit the tott'ring Ship and make to Shore  When Storms descend and adverse Surges roar  Long as in  Credit    Pow'r  or  Place  you stand  Their fawning formal Friendship you command  With twenty  Squeezes  and a hundred  Bows    As many  Compliments  as many  Vows    They swear your Interest shall be their own  And wish the Time to make it better known  Like false hot Coursers waiting for the Chace  Which foam and neigh and proudly spurn the Grass  Intent to run but droop their jaded Crest  And fail you most when most you want their Haste  WE make a Prostitute of  Friendship  's Name  If only  Complaisance  supports our Claim  And yet there are of this polite Degree  Who treat you still with  forc'd Civility    In each obliging Art so well refin'd  Tho' ever false they never seem unkind  Not that my Muse would Decency offend  For 'tis Goodbreeding polishes a Friend  Nor shines it less with  Truth  and  Virtue  join'd  Than comely Features with a noble Mind  But those whose Friendships most in Speeches dwell  Neglect the Fruit and trifle with the Shell  True Friendship more intrinsic Worth affords  Defin'd by Actions better than by Words  A warm Affection that can never cool  Concord of Mind and Music of the Soul  Which tunes the jarring Strings of Life to Love  Shews Men below how Angels live above  There are in Friendship such attractive Charms  It draws Esteem from those it never warms  See how  Qui clamores tota cavea nuper in hospitis amici mci M Pacuvii nova sabula cum ignorante rege uter eorum esset Orestes Pylades Orestem se esse diceret ut pro illo necaretur Orestes autem ita ut erat Orestem se esse perseveraret Stantes plaudebant in re sicta quid arbitramur in vera fuisse facturos  Cic de Amic §  PACUVIUS' tragic Scenes could move  The People's Praises with fictitious Love  When on the Stage two doubtful Princes strive  Each seeking Death to keep his Friend alive  Now PYLADES deceives the Monarch's Eye  Faithful yet fraudulent resolves to die  ORESTES now displays the friendly Cheat  Invites the threat'ning Sword and courts his Fate  Mov'd with their gen'rous Love the Audience rose  With social Flame each changing Bosom glows  All feel the sacred Pow'r of  Friendship  's Laws  And the Stage rocks and thunders with Applause  I know the Muse may give to some Offence  Tho' rather Men of Wit than Men of Sense  Whose Counsel is "Be not engag'd too far  " The greatest Friendship brings the greatest Care  " Our own Concerns have Plagues enough in Store  " Who joins in Friendship only makes 'em more  " The Cares and Troubles which your Friend endures  " Are all by Sympathy adopted yours"  WHAT base ungen'rous selfish Souls are these  Mere Quacks who turn ev'n Health into Disease  And but the darkest Side of Friendship find  To all its radiant Beams and Beauties blind  Two faithful Friends in any State may gain  Comfort to heighten Joy or lessen Pain  If weighty Cares the pensive Mind invade  They make the Burden light with mutual Aid  If Profit or if Pleasure chears the Soul  The Blessing's common each enjoys the whole  If Bus'ness calls them to some distant Place  Swiftpinion'd Love contracts the lengthen'd Space  Each keeps the other's Image in his Breast  As Wax preserves the Form a Seal imprest  HAIL sacred  Friendship  by whose chearing Ray  All Joys increase without it fade away  Ev'n HYMEN's  Torch  tho' burning e'er so bright  Aided by  Friendship  shines with double Light  This you OCELIA by Experience find  Whose  nuptial Friend  lives always in your Mind  No Length of Time no Distance ever ras'd  His lov'd Idea from your tender Breast  Your friendly Flame admits of no Decays  But glows unclouded with augmented Rays  And makes your bridal Lamp much brighter blaze  That faint pale languid Lamp in Age expires  Except 'tis fed with Friendship's constant Fires  These to the  Winter  of our Years extend  And when the  Lover  cools they warm the  Friend  When all the transient  Joys  of Youth are o'er  When all the  Charms  of Beauty  charm  no more  Surviving  Friendship  gives us fresh Supplies  Of lasting Bliss and more substantial Joys  Which sweeten all the Troubles Age has brought  And make the Dregs of Life a cordial Draught  FINIS  The following was written since the preceding Pages were printed off  An  ODE presented to their Royal Highnesses the  Prince  and  Princess  of WALES in  Richmond Gardens  on  Thursday    May    YE Muses hail the Royal Dame  Whose Charms Report excel  Charms brighter far than sounding  Fame    With  all her Tongues  could tell  O glorious PRINCE  Britannia  's Pride  Welcome to  Richmond Seats    Where  Nature  proud to please your BRIDE  Displays her choicest Sweets  See fragrant Beauties deck the Green  The Branches bloom Delight  Gay FLORA paints the verdant Scene  To charm your CONSORT's Sight  Hear how the feather'd warbling Throng  Congratulate your FAIR  Not more melodious was their Song  To the  first wedded Pair  That  Pair  in  Eden  ne'er repos'd  Where Groves more lovely grew  Those Groves in  Eden  ne'er inclos'd  A lovelier PAIR than YOU  YOU happier than the  former Two    Have  nobler  Tasks assign'd  'Twas  Theirs  to  curse  the World but YOU  Were born to  bless  Mankind
