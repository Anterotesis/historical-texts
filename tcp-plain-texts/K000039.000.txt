 A COMEDY CALL'D THE BassetTable  THE BASSETTable A COMEDY As it is Acted at the  TheatreRoyal  in  DruryLane  by Her Majesty's Servants  By the Author of the  Gamester  LONDON  Printed for  William Turner  at the  Angel  at  LincolnsInnBackGate  and Sold by  J Nutt  near  StationersHall  Price  s    d  To the Right Honourable ARTHUR Lord  ALTHAM  BARON of  ALTHAM  In the Kingdom of IRELAND  My LORD  POetry  in its first Institution was principally design'd to Correct and rectify Manners Thence it was that the  Roman  and  Athenian Stages  were accounted Schools of Divinity and Morality where the Tragick Writers of those Days inspired their Audiences with  Noble  and  Heroick Sentiments  and the  Comick  laugh'd and diverted them out of their  Vices  and by rediculing  Folly Intemperence  and  Debauchery  gave them an Indignation for those Irregularities and made them pursue the opposite  Virtues  This caus'd the  Dramatic Poets  in ancient Times not only to be reverenc'd by the lower sort of People but highly Esteem'd and Courted by Persons of the first Rank and tho' the Writers of latter Ages have in a greater Measure not to say in a scandelous Manner deviated from the Footsteps and Examples of their Predecessors yet have they found Protection and Favour with those who have been so Generous as to ascribe the Faults of the  Poets  to the Degeneracy of the  Age  wherein they liv'd  This consideration  my Lord  has imbolden'd me to this Address for tho' on the one Hand I am sensible that the following Piece does little Merit your  Lordship  's Patronage yet your innate Goodness and Generosity give me hopes that your Lordship will Pardon this Intrusion in  which I have the Examples of all those that  wrote  before me to bear me out I heartily wish this Play were more worthy of your  Lordship  's Acceptance Yet so much I hope will be forgiven to the fondness of a Mother for her Production if I say in its Favour that through the whole Piece I have had a tender regard to good Manners and by the main Drift of it endeavour'd to Redicule and Correct one of the most reigning Vices of the Age I might say as many of my  Brethren  have done upon slighter Grounds that this Play has had the good Fortune to Please and Divert the Nicest and Politest Part of the Town but I should set little Stress on their Applause had I not some reason to depend upon your  Lordship  's Approbation whose Judgement Penetration and Discernment are alone sufficient to do full Justice to a performance of this Kind  And now my  Lord  if I follow'd the beaten Road of Dedicators it would naturally Engage me in a  Panegirick  upon your Lordship's Personal Virtues and those of your  Noble  and  Pious Family  but I shall purposely decline a Talk to which I freely own my Ability is Unequal and which tho' manag'd by a  Masterly Pen  would make your Modesty suffer Therefore I shall conclude with begging your  Lordship  's leave to Subscribe my self with all imaginable Respect and Sincerity  My LORD  Your Lordship's most Obedient and most Devoted Humble Servant  PROLOGUE  Spoke by Mr  Penkethman  IN all the Faces that to Plays Resort  Whether of Country City Mob or Court  I've always found that none such hopes Inspire  As youdear Brethren of the Upper Tire  Poets in Prologues may both Preach and Rail  Yet all their Wisdom nothing will avail  Who writes not up to you 'tis ten to one will fail  Your thundring plaudit 'tis that deals out Fame  You make Plays run tho' of themselves but Lame  How often have we known your Noise Commanding  Impose on your Inferior Masters Understanding  Therefore Dear Brethren since I am one of you  Whether adorn'd in Grey Green Brown or Blue  This day stand all by me as I will fall by you  And now to let  The poor Pit see how Pinky's Voice Commands  SilenceNow rattle all your Sticks and clap your grimy Hands▪  I greet your Loveand let the vainest Author show  Half this Command on clearer Hands below  Nay more to prove your Interest let this Play live by you  So may you share good Claret with your Masters  Still free in your Amours from their Disasters  Free from poor Housekeeping where Peck is under Locks▪  Free from Cold Kitchings and no Christmas Box  So may no long Debates i'th' House of Commons  Make you in the Lobby Starve when hungar Summons  But may your plentious Vails come flowing in  Give you a lucky hit and make you Gentlemen  And thus preferr'd ne'er fear the World's Reproaches  But shake your Elbows with my Lord and keep your Coaches  EPILOGUE  Spoke by Mr  Esthcourt  THis

L Lucy  Fye Cousin does it become you to Laugh at those that give you Council for your good  Lady  For my good Oh mon cour Now cannot I Divine what 'tis that I do more than the rest of the World to deserve this blame  Alp  Nor I for the Soul of me  L Lucy  Shou'd all the rest of the World follow your Ladyship's Example the order of Nature would be inverted and every good design'd by Heaven become a Curse Health and Plenty no longer would be known among usYou cross the purpose of the Day and Night you Wake when you should Sleep and make all who have any dependence on you Wake while you Repose  Lady  Bless me may not any Person Sleep when they please  L Lucy  No there are certain Hours that good Man  Modesty and Health require your Care for Exam  disorderly Hours are neither Healthful nor Modest  not Civil to make Company wait Dinner for your    Lady  Why does any body Dine before four a Clock in  London  For my part I think it an Illbred Custom to make my Appetite Pendulum to the Twelfth hour  Alp  Besides 'tis out of Fashion to Dine by Day light and so I told Sir  Richard  yesterday Madam  L Lucy  No doubt but you did Mrs  Alpiew  and then you entertain such a Train of People Cousin that my Lady  Reveller  is as noted as a publick Ordinary where every Fool with Money finds a Welcome  Lady  Would you have me shut my doors against my FriendsNow she is jealous of Sir  James Courtly  aside  Besides is it possible to pass the Evenings without Diversions  Alp  No certainly  L Lucy  I think the Playhouse the much more innocent and commendable Diversion  Lady  To be seen there every Night in my Opinion is more destructive to the Reputation  L Lucy  Well I had rather be noted every Night in the front Box then by my absence once be suspected of Gaming one ruins my Estate and Character the other diverts my Temper and improves my Mind Then you have such a number of Lovers  Lady  Oh  Cupid  is it a Crime to have a number of Lovers If it be 'tis the pleasantest Crime in the World A Crime that falls not every day to every Womans Lot  L Lucy  I dare be positive every Woman does not wish it  Lady  Because wishes have no Effect Cousin ha ha  L Lucy  Methinks my Lord  Worthy  's Assiduity might have banish'd the admiring Croud by this time  Lady  Banish'd 'em Oh Mon cour what pleasure is there in one Lover 'tis like being seen always in one Suit of Cloaths a Woman with one Admirer will ne'er be a Reigning Toast  L Lucy  I am sure those that Encourage more will never have the Character of a Reigning Virtue  Lady  I slight the malicious Censure of the Town yet defy it to asperse my Verture Nature has given me a Face a Shape a Mein an Air for Dress and Wit and Humour to subdue And shall I lose my Conquest for a Name  Alp  Nay and among the unfashionable sort of People too Madam for Persons of Breeding and Quality will allow that Gallantry and Virtue are not inseperable  L Lucy  But Coquetry and Reputation are and there is no differerence in the Eye of the World between having really committed the Fault and lying under the Scandal for my own part I would take as much Care to preserve my Fame as you would your Virtue  Lady  A little pains will serve you for that Cousin for I never once heard you nam'dA Mortification would break my Heart ha ha  L Lucy  'Tis better never to be nam'd than to be ill spoke of but your Reflections shall not Disorder my Temper I could wish indeed to convince you of your Error because you share my Blood but since I see the Vanity of the attempt I shall desist  Lady  I humbly thank your Ladiship  Alp  Oh Madam here's my Lord  Worthy  Sir  James Courtly  and Ensign  Lovely  coming down will your Ladyship see them  Lady  Now have I a strong Inclination to Engage Sir  James  to discompose her Gravity for if I have any Skill in Glances she loves himbut then my Lord  Worthy  is so peevish since our late Quarrel that I'm afraid to Engage the Knight in a Ducl besides my Absence I know will teize him more therefore upon Consideration I'le retire Cousin  Lucy  Good Morrow I'le leave you to better Company there's a Person at hand may prevent your SixaClock Prayers  Exit  Lucy  Ha Sir  James Courtly  I must own I think him agreeablebut am sorry she believes I do I'le not be seen for if what I scarce know my self be grown so visible to her perhaps he too may Discover it and then I am lost  While in the Breast our Secrets close remain  'Tis out of Fortunes power to give us Pain  Exit  Enter Lord  Worthy  Sir  James  Ensign  Lovel  Sir  James  Ha was not that Lady  Lucy  Ensign  It wasah Sir  James  I find your Heart is out of Order about that Lady and my Lord  Worthy  languishes for Lady  Reveller  Sir James  And thou art sick for  Valeria  Sir  Richard  's Daughter

Lordship is as Melancholy as a losing Gamester  Lord  Faith Gentlemen I'm out of Humour but I don't know at what  Sir James  Why then I can tell you for the very same reason that made your Lordship stay here to be Spectator of the very Diversion you hateGamingthe same Cause makes you uneasy in all Company my Lady  Reveller  Lord  Thou hast hit it  James  I confess I love her Person but hate her Humours and her way of Living I have some reasons to believe I'm not indifferent to her yet I despair of fixing her her Vanity has got so much the Mistress of her Resolution and yet her Passion for Gain furmounts her Pride and lays her Reputation open to the World Every Fool that has ready Money shall dare to boast himself her very humble Servant 'ds Death when I could cut the Rascal's Throat  Sir James  your Lordship is even with her one Way for you are as testy as she's vain and as fond of an opportunity to Quarrel with her as she of a Gaming Acquaintance my Opinion is my Lord she'll ne're be won your Way  To gain all Women there's a certain Rule  If Wit should sail to please then Act the Fool  And where you find simplicity not take  Throw off Disguisesand Profess the Rake  Observe which Way their chiefest Humours run  They're by their own lov'd can't the surest Way undone  Lord  Thou'rt of a happy temper Sir  James  I wish I could be so too but since I can't add to your Diversion I'll take my leave good Morrow Gentlemen  Exit  Sir James  This it is to have more Love than Reason about one you and I  Lovely  will go on with Discretion and yet I fear it's in Lady  Lucy  's Power to banish it  Ensign  I find Mrs  Sago  the Drugsters Wife's Interest begins to shake Sir  James  Sir James  And I fear her Love for Play begins to shake her Husband's Baggs toofaith I am weary of that Intreague lest I should be suspected to have a hand in his Ruin  Ensign  She did not lose much to Night I believe preethy Sir  James  what kind of a temper'd Woman is she Has she Wit

thingNot a sute of Cloaths or a Topknot that is not exactly the same with hersthen her Plots and Contrivances to supply these Expences puts her continually upon the Rack yet to give her her due she

Ensign  A powerful Rival I fear for Sir  Richard  resolves to Marry him to his Daughter all my hopes lyes in her Arguments and you know Philosophers are very positiveand if this Captain does but happen to Contradict one Whimsical Notion the Poles will as soon join as they Couple and rather then yield she would go to the Indies in search of  Dampier  's Ants  Sir James  Nay she is no Woman if
