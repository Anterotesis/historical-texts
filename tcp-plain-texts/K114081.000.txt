 A PROSPECT of SOCIETY  ONE sink of level avarice shall lie  And even the worth of kings unhonor'd die  Yet think not thus when freedom's isles I state  I mean to flatter kings or court the great  Think not I mean to sap my country's good  I would not heaven be witness if I could  But when I see contention hem the throne  A bridging kingly power to stretch her own  When I behold a factious band agree  To call it freedom when themselves are free  Senates in blood the code of justic draw  Laws grind the poor and opulence the law  The wealth of climes where savage nations roam  Pillag'd from slaves to purchase slaves at home  I can't forbear but all my passions start  To tear the barb that grides my swelling heart  I can't forbear but half a coward grown  I wish to shrink from tyrants to the throne  Yes my lov'd brother cursed be that hour  When first ambition toil'd for foreign power  When Britons learnt to swell beyond their shore  And barter useful men for useless ore  To shine with splendors that destruction haste  Like flaring tapers brightening as they waste  Have we not seen at pleasure's lordly call  An hundred villages in ruin fall  Beheld the duteous son the sire decay'd  The modest matron and the blushing maid  Forc'd from their homes a melancholy train  To traverse climes beyond the western main  Where wild Oswego spreads her swamps around  And Niagara stuns with thund'ring sound  Even now perhaps as there some pilgrim strays  Through tangling sorests and through dangerous ways  Through woods where beasts divided empire claim  And the brown Indian takes a deadly aim  There while above the forceful tempest flies  And all around distressful yellings rise  The famish'd exile bends beneath his woe  And faintly fainter fainter seems to go  Casts a fond look where Britain's shores recline  And gives his griefs to sympathize with mine  War in each breast and freedom on each brow  How much unlike the sons of Britain now  Flush'd at the sound my genius spreads her wing  And flies where Britain broods the western spring  Where lawns extend that spurn Arcadian pride  And brighter streams than fam'd Campaspe glide  There all around the gentlest breezes stray  There gentle music melts on every spray  Creation's mildest charms are there combin'd  Extremes are only in the master's mind  Stern o'er each bosom reason holds her state  With daring aims irregularly great  I see the lords of mankind pass me by  With haughty port defiance in their eye  Intent on high designs a thoughtful band  By forms unfashion'd fresh from Nature's hand  Fierce in a native hardihood of soul  True to imagin'd right whate'er controul  While even the peasant boasts these rights to scan  And learns to venerate himself as man  Thine Freedom thine the blessings pictur'd here  Thine are those charms that dazzle and endear  Happy indeed were such without alloy  But even from Freedom issuing ills annoy  That independence Britons prize too high  Keeps man from man and cuts the social tie  There though by circling deeps together held  Minds combat minds repelling and repell'd  Ferments arise imprison'd factions roar  Represt ambition struggles round her shore  Whilst overwrought the general system feels  Its motions stopt or phrenzy fire the wheels  Nor rest their ills As social bonds decay  As duty love and honour fail to sway  Fictitious bonds the bonds of wealth and law  Still gather strength and force unwilling awe  Hence all distinction's paid to these alone  Talent must sink and merit weep unknown  Till Time may come when stript of all her charms  That land of scholars and that nurse of arms  Where ancestry avows the noble claim  And statesmen toil and poets pant for fame  To men of other minds my fancy flies  Embosom'd in the deep where Holland lies  Methinks her patient sons before me stand  Where the broad ocean leans against the land  And sedulous to stop the coming tide  Lift the tall rampire's artificial pride  That spreads its arms amidst the swelling main  And scoops an empire from the watry reign  Onward methinks and diligently slow  The firm connected bulwark seems to go  While ocean pent and rising o'er the pile  Sees an amphibious world beneath him smile  The slow canal the yellow blossom'd vale  The willow tufted bankâ–ª the gliding sail  Plains forests town  in gay profusion drest  A new creation ravish  from his breast  Thus while around the wavesubjected soil  Impels the native to repeated toil  Industrious habits in each breast obtain  And industry begets a love of gain  Hence all the good from opulence that springs  With all those ills superfluous treasure brings  Are here display'd Their muchlov'd wealth imparts  Convenience plenty elegance and arts  But turn the medal craft and fraud appear  Even liberty itself is barter'd here  At gold's superior charms all freedom flies  The needy sell it and the rich man buys  A land of tyrants and a den of slaves  Here wretches seek dishonourable graves  And calm beneath their injuries conform  Dull as their lakes quiescent in a storm  Heavens how unlike their Belgic sires of old  Rough poor content ungovernably bold  Where shading elms beside the margin grew  And freshen'd from the waves the Zephyr blew  And haply tho' my harsh touch faltering still  But mock'd all tune and marr'd the dancer's skill  Yet would the village praise my wond'rous power  And dance forgetful of the noontide hour  Alike all ages Dames of ancient days  Have led their children through the mirthful maze  And the gay grandsire skill'd in gestic lore  Has frisk'd beneath the burthen of threescore  So blest a life these thoughtless realms display  Thus idly strenuous rolls their world away  Theirs are those arts that mind to mind endear  For honour forms the social temper here  Honour that praise which real merit gains  Or even imaginary worth obtains  Here passes current paid from hand to hand  It shifts its splendid traffic round the land  From courts to camps to cottages it strays  And all are taught an avarice of praise  They please are pleas'd they give to get esteem  Till seeming blest they grow to what they seem  But while this softer art their bliss supplies  It gives their follies also room to rise  For praise too dearly lov'd or warmly sought  Enfeebles all internal strength of thought  And the weak soul within itself unblest  Leans for all pleasure on another's breast  Hence ostentation here with tawdry art  Pants for the vulgar praise which fools impart  Here vanity assumes the pert grimace  And trims her robes of frize with copper lace  Here beggar pride defrauds her daily cheer  To boast one splendid dish for once a year  And scarce a man is found who rightly weighs  The solid transports of internal praise  These are the charms to barren states assign'd  Their wants are few their wishes all confin'd  Yet let them only share the praises due  If few their wants their pleasures are but few  Since every want that stimulates the breast  Becomes a means of pleasure when possest  Hence from such lands each pleasing science flies  That first excites desire and then supplies  Unknown to them when sensual pleasures cloy  To fill the languid pause with finer joy  Unknown those powers that raise the soul to flame  Catch every nerve and vibrate through the frame  Their level life is but a smould'ring fire  Nor quench'd by want nor fan'd by strong desire  Unfit for raptures or if raptures cheer  On some high festival of once a year  In wild excess the vulgar breast takes fire  Till buried in debauch the bliss expire  But not their joys alone thus coarsly flow  Their morals like their pleasures are but low  For as refinement stops from sire to son  Manners in one unmending track will run  And love and friendship's finely pointed dart  Fall blunted from each indurated heart  Some sterner virtues o'er the mountain's breast  May sit like falcons cow'ring on the nest  But all the gentler morals such as play  Through life's more cultur'd walks and charm our way  These far disperse on timorous pinions fly  To sport and flutter in a kinder sky  To kinder skies where gentler manners reign  We turn where France displays her bright domain  Thou sprightly land of mirth and social ease  Pleas'd with thyself whom all the world can please  How often have I led thy sportive choir  With tuneless pipe along the sliding Loire  No vernal bloom their torpid rocks display  But winter lingering chills the lap of May  No Zephyr fondly sooths the mountain's breast  But meteors glare and frowning storms invest  Yet still even here content can spread a charm  Redress the clime and all its rage disarm  Though poor the peasant's hut his feasts though small  He sees his little lot the lot of all  See no contiguous palace rear its head  To shame the meanness of his humble shed  No costly lord the sumptuous banquet deal  To make him loath his vegetable meal  But calm and bred in ignorance and toil  Each wish contracting fits him to the soil  Chearful at morn he wakes from short repose  Breasts the keen air and carrols as he goes  With patient angle trolls the finny deep  Or drives his vent'rous plowshare to the steep  Or seeks the den where snow tracks mark the way  And drags the struggling savage into day  At night returning every labour sped  He sits him down the monarch of a shed  Smiles by his chearful fire and round surveys  His childrens looks that brighten at the blaze  While his lov'd partner boastful of her hoard  Displays the cleanly platter on the board  And haply too some pilgrim thither led  With many a tale repays the nightly bed  Thus every good his native wilds impart  Imprints the patriot passion at his heart  Dear in that shed to which his soul conforms  And dear that hill which lifts him to the storms  And as a babe when scaring sounds molest  Clings close and closer to the mother's breast  So the loud torrent and the whirlwind's roar  But bind him to his native mountains more  For wealth was theirs nor far remov'd the date  When commerce proudly flourish'd through the state  At her command the palace learnt to rise  Again the longfall'n column sought the skies  The canvass glow'd with animation warm  The pregnant quarry teem'd with human form  But more unstable than the southern gale  Soon Commerce turn'd on other shores her sail  And late the nation sound with fruitless skill  Their former strength was now plethoric ill  Yet though to fortune lost there still abide  Some splendid arts the wrecks of former pride  From which the seeble heart and long fall'n mind  An easy compensation seems to find  Here may be seen in bloodless pomp array'd  The pasteboard triumph and the cavalcade  Processions form'd for piety and love  A mistress or a saint in every grove  At sports like these are all their cares beguil'd  The sports of children satisfy the child  At sports like these while foreign arms advance  They proudly swell and leave the world to chance  When strenuous aims have suffer'd long controul  They leave at last or feebly man the soul  While low delights succeeding fast behind  In happier meanness occupy the mind  As in those domes where Caesars once bore sway  But now by time dismantled in decay  Amidst the ruin heedless of the dead  The shelterseeking peasant builds his shed  And wond'ring man could want the larger pile  Exults and owns his cottage with a smile  My soul turn from them turn we to survey  Where rougher climes a nobler race display  Where the bleak Swiss their stormy mansions tread  And force a churlish soil for scanty bread  No product here the barren hills afford  But man and steel the soldier and his sword  Far to the right where Appenine ascends  Bright as the summer Italy extends  Her uplands sloping deck the mountain's side  Woods over woods in gay theatric pride  While oft some temples mould'ring tops between  With venerable grandeur marks the scene  Could Nature's bounty satisfy the breast  The sons of Italy were surely blest  Whatever fruits in different climes are found  That proudly rise or humbly court the ground  Whatever blooms in torrid tracts appear  That dress in bright succession round the year  Whatever sweets salute the northern sky  With vernal leaves that blossom but to die  These here disporting own the kindred soil  Nor ask luxuriance from the planter's toil  While seaborne gales their gelid wings expand  To winnow fragrance round the smiling land  But small the bliss that sense alone bestows  And sensual bliss is all the nation knows  In rich luxuriance plants and flowers appear  Men seem the only growth that dwindles here  Contrasted faults through all their manners reign  Though poor luxurious though submissive vain  Though grave yet trifling zealous yet untrue  And even in penance planning sins anew  All ills are here to pejorate the mind  That opulence departed leaves behind  Nor less the patriot's boast where'er we roam  His first best country ever is at home  And yet perhaps if states with states we scan  Or estimate their bliss on Reason's plan  Though patriots flatter and though fools contend  We still shall find the doubtful scale depend  Find that each good by Art or Nature given  To these or those but makes the balance even  Nature a mother kind alike to all  Still grants her blessings at Industry's call  And though the rigid clime or rough rocks frown  These rocks by custom turn to beds of down  From Art more various are the blessings sent  Wealth splendours freedom honor and content  Yet these each other's power so strong contest  That either seems subversive of the rest  Hence e'ery state to one lov'd blessing prone  Chiefly conforms itself to that alone
