 MARCELLUS A MONODY  Humbly inscrib'd to Her Royal Highness THE PRINCESS of  WALES  By Mr  DELAP  M A Fellow of  Magdalen  College CAMBRIDGE  Multis ille bonis flebilis occidit  Nulli flebilior quam tibi  HOR  LONDON  Printed for R DODSLEY in  Pallmall  And sold by M COOPER in  PaternosterRow    MARCELLUS A MONODY  YE virgintrain that whilom wak'd your lyres  Fast by the chrystal springs of  Helicon  To heav'nly strains of joy those dulcet Notes  Ill suit a Nation's universal moan  When ev'ry hope with their lost Prince is gone  The thrilling voice of joy no longer floats  O'er pale  Britannia's  sadlysilent shore  MARCELLUS is no more  But oh the doleful change the plaintive muse  In cypress crown'd must pour her piteous loan  Of sigh and tear and heartempiercing groan  Come then  Melpomene  begin the Lay  With rueful Tears your sorrowing Dirges steep  Such tears as erst your sistermuse did weep  For her dear twin  Palici  every stream  Shall stop to hear your theme  Then sadly murmur to the plaintive shore  MARCELLUS is no more  And feeble Echo from her aery cave  Shall back return the note and ev'ry vale  With all its flow'rs shall droop to hear the tale  How can he lie unwept who knew to raise  Esteem and love in every loyal heart  He was the pride of ev'ry Shepherd's praise  Grac'd with each decent and each princely part  Nor did the muse ungrateful pour her lays  He oft wou'd listen to the poet's art  And oft alone beneath the muse's grot  Hid from a nation's eye he sat and thought  Full many an hour his Offspring pratling round  In gentle dalliance has he fondly smil'd  Full many an hour sequester'd from annoys  In tender amorous talk has he beguil'd  With the dear Partner of his dearest joys  Mean while the foe of Life with treacherous art  In sly destruction prey'd upon his heart  And yet no fatal symptom did appear  The blood still mantled on his rosy cheek  As  Phaebus  oft the clouds with gold doth streak  While brooding storms engender in the air  Where was your knowledge then you sapient Tribe  That boast commandment o'er the pulse of life  Was not a Princess' tears sufficient bribe  Cou'd not a King's a Nation's pray'rs prevail  To make your nicest skill explore his ail  Some few more Years the breath of Life supply  And keep him from the Sky  Ah me what boots your skillNot all the pray'rs  That pale  Britannia  and her King might pour  Not all  Augusta  's sadlyflowing Tears  Not  Aesculapius'  Sons with all their care  Might ward the black inevitable hour  Or could their Prince's vital Band repair  Which in their mood the fatal Sisters tore  Alass he droop'd in life's maturest age  While  Albion  's sceptre hung before his view  And thrice the wise  Machaon  did presage  That  Febris  her inflaming rage withdrew  Yet then renewing her malignant strife  The deadly Fiend unhous'd his tender Life  Then stream'd the tear from ev'ry  British  eye  But chief th' unhappy sire in dismal plight  Detests the odious light  And with loud wailings tears the arched sky  And calls on death to bring a kind reprieve  And lay his cruel sorrows in the grave  But ah my Muse how may thy voice record  Tho' well I ween thou shar'st her piteous state  The tender unimaginable woe  Of his dear Consort for her ravish'd Lord  Torn by the hand of unrelenting Fate  Then hide the tears thou canst not give to flow  Enough that when reviving life did chase  Death's dismal image from her pallid face  With manly shew she mask'd her sorrows dread  And greatly strove to chear with kind relief  Her tender Offspring's sympathetic grief  Who at their Mother's wretched plight grew sad  What heart so stony but did melt in tears  See pale  Britannia  wears  Thro' all her Sons one dismal face of woe  Nor  British  eyes alone do overflow  See even the  Orcades  and frozen Realms  By Ocean's wat'ry barrier sunder'd far  Pay their full tribute of a tender tear  Mean while the awful tongue of death doth pierce  Night's drowzy ear with tollings deep and slow  And now the solemn pealing Organs blow  The winking Lamps a dusky lustre shed  Along the Mansions of the Dead  Where mould'ring Kings in silent dust repose  And now with often interrupted sighs  The Lawnrob'd Prelate his last duty pays  And dust to dust conveys  And now entomb'd his sacred body lies  Free from the cares that this vain life enclose  Up to yon regions of eternal day  The free unbodied spirit wings its way  There in the bosom of its god doth bide  In pure immaculate unshaken bliss  Nor recks the loss of earthly Kingdom's pride  Enthron'd for aye in heavenly paradise  And thou sad Consort of a Prince too good  Longer to visit this forsaken clime  Ah cease to weary the relentless sky  With bitter penance and with bootless tears  Nor deem with vainlypious pray'rs  To draw him from his blissful dear abode  Where now he never more may fear to die  Nor grieve save when your plaints wou'd him recall  Not lent for aye to your fond hopes I ween  And oh forgive the muse whose daring lays  Wou'd grateful pour her artless loyal teen  Reckless that true to draw a Prince's praise  Asks the nice touches of a masterhand  Since she may see in your fair Offspring plann'd  The graceful dowries of their Father's mind  See Mercy Truth Religion Liberty  Beneath the shine of your enliv'ning eye  And ev'ry virtue that may bless mankind  FINIS
