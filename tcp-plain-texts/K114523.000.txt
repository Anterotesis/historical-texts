 The Choice Spirits Assembly  SONGS COMIC AND SATYRICAL  BY GEORGE ALEXANDER STEVENS  I love  FUN  Keep it up  LECTURE UPON HEADS  OXFORD Printed for the AUTHOR  Sold by J WALLER in  FleetStreet  G ROBINSON in  PaternosterRow  and F NEWBERY the Corner of St  Paul's Church Yard London  MDCCLXXII  To the PUBLICK  A Paultry Collection of Songs having lately made its Appearance to which the Pub∣lisher has with uncommon Effrontery prefixed my Name as the Editor and upon my disclaiming the P  sit  on has even had the Assurance in a publick Advertisement to assert that he had my Authority for so doingalthough I have more Veneration for the Publick than either to trouble them or load the Daily Papers with an Altercation between a little Country Shopkeeper and a BalladMaker yet I once for all beg Leave to state the real Fact  About four Years ago I exhibited my LECTURE at  Whitehaven  and having Occasion to use this Man's Shop he took the Opportunity of solliciting me to give him a few Comic Songs  because he had a Mind to publish a Volume to please his Customers in the Part of the Country where he lived  and at the same Time opening a Song Book shewed me several under my Name which he told me he pur∣posed to print in his CollectionMy Reply was  Sir There is not one of those printed as I wrote them and some to which my Name is affixed are really not mine    But sir replied my Chapman will you please to give yourself the Trouble to mark such  of them as are yours    Why really sir I am ashamed of them    Lord sir they'll do very well here pray sir take the Book home and be so obliging as to mark them for me And if it would not give Mr  Stevens  too much Trouble I should be greatly obliged if he would just put a Mark upon any other Songs in the Book that he thinks worth printing  This was done and the Volume returned the next Day  From hence I could not imagine he would do  more  than insert my Name to the Songs I had owned and I solemnly declare he had no Authority from me to use it otherwise What I did was a meer Act of common CivilityI had not then nor have I since had any Connections with the Man and upon this Ground alone he has had the  Modesty  to charge me with a Breach of Promise by my Disavowal This among other Reasons has induced me to publish my own Songs which I now claim as Property and have entered in the Hall Books of the Stationers Company  G A STEVENS  DIRECTIONS to the BINDER  The Assembly of Choice Spirits  Frontispiece  The Moonlight Piece to face the Prologue Signa∣ture A Page  Advertisement  THE Writer of these Ballads by way of Preface begs leave to introduce a  Fragment  which he happily met with among the MSS preserved in that inestimable receptacle of Curiosities at  Chelsea  well known to the  Literati  of all Nations under the denomination of DON SALTERO'S COFFEEHOUSE  This Fragment indeed bears no marks of Antiquity yet the origin as well as progress of MUSIC and POETRY is here traced with uncommon perspi∣cuity and it is greatly to be lamented that the Author himself could not be consulted for putting the finishing hand to so arduous and elaborate an under∣taking  THE HISTORY OF CHOICE SPIRITS AND BALLAD SINGING  JUBAL or TUBAL CAIN was the first composer of Tunes his Lyre preceded  Orion's Amphion's  and even the  Harp  of  Orpheus  ORION when making his voyage upon the Dolphin's back invented  Wa∣ter Music  AMPHION introduced  Cotillons  as well as  Country Dancing  ORPHEUS to please his  Eurydice  ex∣hibited the first  Harmonic Meeting  And on the mountain  Gibello  CIRCE held her first Court for COMUS The Magazines of the Ancients those most useful repositories of readymade erudi∣tion tell us that BACCHUS instituted a Club at this very period called the  Baccae  or  Bacchantes  and which are now called the BUCKS as it appears not only by  Nimrod's  ancient Charter deposited in the Archives of the  Babylonian  Lodge in the environs of  Soho  but also by the authenticated Records belonging to the  Pewter Platter  in  Bishopsgateprecinct  And to these two Bodies of that Noble and Ancient Order the following En∣graving of the famous GOBLET or CUP used by the GRAND BUCK at  Rome  when he celebrated the  Secular Games  is here addressed with its original Inscrip∣tion and a Translation for the mutual entertainment of those distinct Classes of  Critics  the LEARNED and UN∣LEARNED who alternately take the lead in all Conversations  POCULUM POCULORUM Or the CUP of CUPS  BENE VOBIS  BENE MIHI  BENE AMICAE MEAE  BENE OMNIBUS NOBIS  BENE CUI NON INVIDET MIHI  ET EO CUI NOSTRO GAUDEO GAUDET  THUS TRANSLATED  HERE'S TO THEE  HERE'S TO ME  ON OUR ABSENT FRIENDS WE'LL THINK  TO OUR NOBLE SELVES WE'LL DRINK  THEN TO HIM FROM ENVY FREE  WHO LOVES FUN LIKE YOU AND ME  The reason for introducing this  Antique  unto the Reader's acquaintance is ac∣cording to the modern custom of Bookmaking to shew the  Author's  ERUDI∣TION which is still farther displayed in the following account of CHOICE SPIRITS  After  Circe's  elopement with  Ulysses  they became wanderers upon the Face of the Earth and like  Jews  and  Strol∣ingplayers  continue  Itinerants  even unto this day they have nevertheless mul∣tiplied exceedingly propagating their Convivialities into the different  Orders  of GRIGS GREGS and GREGORIANS ANTIGALLICANS FREE MASONS and MACARONISONS of SOUND SENSE and SATISFACTIONSONS of KIT and OLD SOULSTRUE BLUES PUR∣PLES and ALBIONS The BEEF STEAK JOCKEY and CATCH CLUBS The MAGDALENS and LUMBER TROOP with many Others all which acknowledge the Affinity they bear to their paternal Society by celebrating  their Evening Mysteries with a  Song  and a  Sentiment  The CHOICE SPIRITS have ever been famous for their Talents as Musical Artists They usually met at the har∣vesthomes of Grapegathering There exhilerated by the pressings of the Vin∣tage they were wont to sing Songs tell Stories and shew Tricks from their first emerging until their Perihelion under the Presidentship of Mr GEORGE ALEXANDER STEVENS  BalladLaureat  to the Society of CHOICE SPIRITS and who appeared at Ranelagh in the Cha∣racter of COMUS supported by those Droles of merry Memory  Unparalleled were their performances as  first Fists  upon the SALTBOX and inimitable the variations they would twang upon the  forte  and  piano  JEWSHARP Excellent was  Howard  in the

sable shroud is drawn  Then Ghosts are said to glide  The paly Moonshine's silv'ry gleams  Seem dancing down the glade  Mingling 'midst shadowy forms it's beams  Which scare the trembling Maid  The Trav'ller oft is apt to see  Through twilight's dusky veil  A Giant in each Hedgerow Tree  While Phantoms fill the Dale  So rambling Readers may condemn  This Book of medley Rhimes  Whose Errors will appear to them  A list of Giant Crimes  Already mark  Sir Cynic  scowls  Rage wrinkling on his brow  To see O shame two am'rous Owls  Instinctive on yon Bough  With outspread hands and upcast eyes  As Bigots tell their stories  Th' o'erzealous Commentator cries  O Tempora O Mores  But why should Critics carp at Songs  Or Classic Scales apply  To  them  alone this freight belongs  Who'd rather  laugh  than  cry  For neither  Pedant  nor for  Prude  These Sonnets took their birth  But are dish'd up as pleasant Food  For  SONS  of  SOCIAL MIRTH  SONGS COMIC and SATYRICAL  SONG I ORIGIN of ENGLISH LIBERTY  To it's own Tune  I  O  NCE the Gods of the Greeks at am∣brosial feast  Large bowls of rich nectar were quaffing  Merry Momus among them appear'd as a guest  Homer says the Celestials lov'd laughing  II  This happen'd 'fore Chaos was fix'd into form  While Nature disorderly lay  While elements adverse engender'd the storm  And uproar embroil'd the loud fray  III  On ev'ry Olympic the Humourist droll'd  So none cou'd his jokes disapprove  He sung repartee'd and some odd stories told  And at last thus began upon Jove  IV  Sire Mark how you Matter is heaving below  Were it settled 'twou'd please all your Court  'Tis not wisdom to let it lie useless you know  Pray people it just for our sport  V  Jove nodded assent all Olympus bow'd down  At his Fiat creation took birth  The cloudkeeping Deity smil'd on his throne  Then announc'd the production was Earth  VI  To honour their Sov'reign each God gave a boon  Apollo presented it Light  The Goddess of Childbed dispatch'd us a Moon  To silver the shadow of Night  VII  The Queen of Softwishes foul Vulcan's fair bride  Leer'd wanton on her Man of War  Saying as to these Earthfolks I'll give them a guide  So she sparkled the morn and eve Star  VIII  From her cloud all in spirits the Goddess up sprung  In ellipsis each Planet advanc'd  The Tune of the Spheres the Nine Sisters sung  As round Terra Nova they danc'd  IX  E'en Jove himself cou'd not insensible stand  Bid Saturn his girdle fast bind  The Expounder of Fate grasp'd the Globe in his hand  And laugh'd at those Mites call'd Mankind  X  From the hand of great Jove into Space it was hurl'd  He was charm'd with the roll of the ball  Bid his daughter Attraction take charge of the World  And she hung it up high in his hall  XI  Miss pleas'd with the present review'd the globe round  Saw with rapture hills vallies and plains  The selfbalanc'd orb in an atmosphere bound  Prolific by suns dews and rains  XII  With silver gold jewels she India endow'd  France and Spain she taught vineyards to rear  What was fit for each clime on each clime she bestow'd  And Freedom she found flourish'd here  XIII  The blueey'd celestial Minerva the wise  Ineffably smil'd on the spot  My dear says plum'd Pallas your last gift I prize  But excuse me one thing is forgot  XIV  Licentiousness Freedom's destruction may bring  Unless Prudence prepares it's defence  The Goddess of Sapience bid Iris take wing  And on Britons bestow'd CommonSense  XV  Four Cardinal Virtues she left in this isle  As guardians to cherish the root  The blossoms of Liberty gaily 'gan smile  And Englishmen fed on the fruit  XVI  Thus fed and thus bred by a bounty so rare  Oh preserve it as pure as 'twas giv'n  We will while we've breath nay we'll grasp it in death  And return it untainted to Heav'n  SONG II ORIGIN of FACTION  Tune  I am quoth Apollo when Daphne  c  I  IN hist'ries of Heathens by which Tutors train us  The saltwater Sov'reign is call'd OCEANUS  His spouse was deliver'd by manmidwife Triton  Of this seagirt island his fav'rite Britain  II  The Naiads were Nurses old Trident declar'd  To embellish his offspring no pains shou'd be spar'd  By flying fish drawn to Olympus he drove  And petition'd the Gods that his suit they'd approve  III  Quoth Jupiter I'll make it  King  of the  Sea  Avast reply'd Neptune pray leave that to me  I'll guard it with shoals and I'll make their lads  Seamen  Strong Hercules hollow'd out I'll make 'em  Freemen  IV  And what will you make Venus whisper'd to Mars  Why I'll make all Soldiers that  Nep  don't make Tars  Momus smil'd as that droll always merrily means  He begg'd they'd go partners and make 'em  Marines  V  Quoth Saturn much time I'll allow 'em for thinking  Buck Bacchus reply'd no allow it for drinking  But Mercury answer'd a fig for your Wine  The art of Timekilling by Cardplaying's mine  VI  By Styx quoth Apollo but Hermes you're bit  'Gainst Gaming I'll send 'em an antidote Wit  In England laugh'd Momus Wit no one regards  Save that sort of Wit that's in Playing your Cards  VII  Well well replies Phoebus I'll mend their conditions  I'll teach 'em to fiddle and send them Physicians  'Mong Fidlers quoth Momus  true Harmony  's scarce  And as to your Doctorship  Physick's a Farce  VIII  Says Venus I'll people this Island with Beauties  And tempt MarriedMen to be true to their duties  You to MarriedMen's duty a friend bawl'd out Juno  You're a strumpet you slut and that I know and you know  IX  Then turning to Jove who look'd pale she began  I'll spoil your olympical giftgiving plan  Herself not consulted she vow'd she wou'd wrong us  Blew a Scold from her mouth and sent  Party  among us  X  God Bacchus to counterpoise Juno's rash action  Commanded Silenus to seize upon  Faction  Swift flitted the Fiend the old Toper outsped  Whilst Semele's son sent a Flask at his head  XI  The Imp by the blow speechless fell to the ground  May Wine thus for ever foul  Faction  confound  Unanimity  that that's the Toast of our Hearts  Though no Partymen here  Here's to all Men of Parts  SONG III THE RACE  Tune  As Roger came tapping at Dolly's Window  I  AS the Farmer went over his corn ripen'd land  And counted encrease of his grain  Scarlet poppies he saw down the long furrows stand  Like soldiers in lines on the plain  Quoth he though in Learning I am not well skill'd  In mem'ry this maxim I'll keep  Those weeds among wheat shew when belly is fill'd  We have nothing to do but to sleep  II  Each scene of creation that opes to our view  Affords contemplation a theme  As blossoms enamell'd by drops of bright dew  With di'monds so Courtbeauties beam  See grape to grape swelling transparent on vine  That fruit is an emblem of bliss  Balmy lip to lip Lovers as lusciously join  And the nectar enjoy of a Kiss  III  While Britons like Britons dare English Taste own  Success on our strength could depend  We now by importing enervate  Bon Ton  To impotent Idlers descend  We wed without Love we attempt without Powers  And strengthless and senseless in swarms  Insipid as butterflies basking on flowers  The fribbles fill fine womens arms  IV  If  Bacchus  and  Ceres  were drove from Love's court  Desire  must frozen depart  Roast Beef  quantum suff  and take  tantum  Red Port  They steel the Mainspring of the Heart  Cou'd we Venus consult why indeed so we may  Since each circle a Venus supplies  I'll back my opinion those beauties will say  A  Milksop  's the  thing  we despise  V  The Elixir of Love  in our full bottles view  For Beauty's sake Bumpers embrace  While kept in this Training we can't but  come through  For GiveandTake Plates in  Love's Race  Success to that  Meeting  where each against each  Well mounted push forward to win  For third fourth or fifth heats they rallying stretch  And neck to neck nimbly come in  SONG IV THE WORMS  Tune  When Strephon to Chloe made love his pretence  KEEP your distance quoth King who in lead coffin lay  As beside him they lower'd a shrowdless old Clay  The Mendicant Carcase replied with a sneer  "Mister Monarch be still we are all equal here  II  "Life's miseries long I was forc'd to abide  "By the Seasons sore pelted sore pelted by pride  "And tho' clad in ermine yet you've been distrest  "Both our cares now are overso let us both rest"  III  A committee of worms Manor Lords of the Grave  Overheard 'em and wonder'd to hear the Dead rave  Quoth the Chairman  Dare mortals presume thus to prate  When even we Maggots don't think ourselves great  IV  "Insane ostentations who brag of their births  "Yet are but Machines mix'd of aggregate earths  "They distinctions demand with distinctons they meet  "When we throw by the rich folks as not fit to eat  V  "They are scurvy compounds of  Debauch  and  Disease  "Putrefactions of Sloth or Vice run to the Lees  "By Luxury's pestilence Health is laid waste  "And all they can boast is  They're poison'd in Taste  VI  "'Tis true cries  Crawlina  the Queen of the Worms  "They make upon earth immense noise with their forms  "  Pon onner  with Beauties tho' so much I deal  "On not one in ten can I make a good meal  VII  "When we chose to regale on the dainties of charms  "We formerly fed on necks faces and arms  "Now Varnish envenoms their tainted complections  "A fine woman's features spread fatal infections  VIII  "Not a Worm of good taste and  bon ton  I dare vouch  "A morsel of fashionmade Beauties will touch  "A Quality Toast we imported last week  "Two Maggots my servants dy'd eating her cheek"  IX  Very odd  quoth a Critic  Worms hold such discourse  Very odd quoth the Author that Men shou'd talk worse  Like Reptiles we crawl upon earth for a term  Take wing for a while then descend to a Worm  X  Dan Pope  declares all Human Race to be  Worms  Maids Misses Wives Widows all Maggotty forms  But of Worms and wormfeeding no more we'll repeat  Here's a glass  To the Dainty that's made for Man's meat  SONG V THE PICTURE  Tune  Fine Songsters too often apologies make  I  WISHING well to good folks both on this and that  By my own fireside with my Lass  Not yawning nor mute but in spiritful chat  To  Old England  I took off my glass  II  The next to my  King  and the third was a Joke  Of all places I toasted  The Best  She seem'd not to hear but her cheeks blushes spoke  The Wanton my  Sentiment  guess'd  III  Her bosom I press'd to my lips it arose  The crimson still flushing her face  With lovelisping laugh she replied "I suppose  "You presume I can guess at the place"  IV  I answer'd but first for my Fee took a Kiss  "Where the Temple of Love we attend  "Beauty's columns begin at the Fountain of Bliss  "In tapering outlines they end  V  "On the top at the Arch of Enjoyment unite  "Curl'd tendrils the Pediment grace  "For Cupid's Pantheon the Shaft of Delight  "Must spring from the Masculine Base  VI  "If the Lady of this perfect Mansion you'll see"  As I spoke gave my hand to the Lass  "Oh by all means" she said"then my dear come with me"  So I led my Girl up to the glass  VII  Off she turn'd with a pshah yet no anger exprest  Goodbreeding scorns Prudery's skreen  'Mong our dinnertime  toasts  when we drink  to the Best  We only  most excellent  mean  VIII  Remember my Bucks when you're aiming at Jokes  Be sure make the most of a Jest  Not like the assembly of impotent folks  Who prove themselves  bad  at the  best  IX  Our Youths in their waists are now scarcely a span  An insensible expletive crew  When Loveliness weds one in hopes of a Man  'Tis the worst thing a Lady can do  X  Here's to Beauty a Toast sir but not Face alone  Lower yet lies the Circle of Grace  Beneath where in centre Love buckles her Zone  The Point of Attraction we place  XI  Let our Bottles like globes have elliptical sweep  Geometrists mind what I say  May beautiful Parallels distances keep  To give Perpendiculars way  SONG VI SILENUS and CUPID  Tune  Derry down  I  CUPID sent on a message one evening by  Venus  As illluck wou'd have it was met by  Silenus  The bigbelly'd Sot ask'd the Urchin to play  And the silly lad gam'd all Love's weapons away  Derry down  c  II  His Bow from the Bubble the old Gambler drew  And into a crutchheaded Stick turn'd the Yew  The String was tough Catgut  Si  swore it was well  A strong line he wanted to ring his Bar Bell  III  Love's Arrows were Cane he divided the joints  Pipestoppers the ends made and Pickteeth the points  The Feathers to brush down his tables were clever  And to a Tobaccopouch turn'd the boy's Quiver  IV  For pipelighting Matches he chose Billetdeux  And away at each puff went a Sonneteer's Vows  His Tinder was drawn from the brains of the Jealous  And longbottled Sighs he preserv'd for his Bellows  V  Hermes  took the lad home told the story to  Venus  She dash'd down her teacup and flew to  Silenus  Then threaten'd her Captain shou'd kick the old Clown  But he laugh'd and he smoak'd and he sung  derry down  VI  She squeez'd his hard hand and his filthy beard strok'd  Nay kiss'd him tho' with his tobaccofumes choak'd  Then begg'd the boy's Arms but  Si  swore with a frown  He'd be damn'd if he gave them for her  Derry down  VII  She whipt her doves back vastly piqued you may guess  In Synod Celestial demanded Redress  Jove laugh'd at the jest and he vow'd by his Crown  When Spouse rail'd hereafter he'd sing  Derry down  MORAL  Ye Husbands too fond who are Femininefool'd  And tamely by Petticoat Government rul'd  Resist your Wives Railings their shrill trebles drown  By smoaking and singing of  Down derry down  Derry down  c  SONG VII THE DIVORCE  Tune  Old women we are and as wise in the chair  I  NO more let defections of Wedlock be blam'd  To be sure of grave Cato you've heard  In morals more strict not a man cou'd be nam'd  Yet his Wife to a friend he transferr'd  II  In Rome they encourag'd no Trials  crim con  In France Cuckoldmaking's a Jest  And I trust in few years by the help of  bon ton  We shall be as polite as the best  III  'Tis  vastly immense  and  most horridly low  When a Month after Marriage is past  That the Husband shou'd be such a  Fright  not to know  His Lady's affections can't last  IV  For broken in Fortune and ruin'd in Health  To patch up both Person and Purse  His Honour addresses some Citizen's Wealth  And the Daughter accepts as his Nurse  V  Too oft for the sake of a Title impure  Doom'd Beauty is forc'd from her vows  To unite with a  Blank  for upon the Grand Tour  Foreign Vice has disabled the Spouse  VI  In defence of the Fair Satire openly stands  And forbids the vague Spendthrifts to roam  Wives have too much stock lying dead on their hands  When Husbands are Bankrupts at home  VII  Censure no married Dame as the trade's so decreas'd  Heavy Interest Principal clogs  When Ladies have furnish'd and exquisite feast  Must their dainties be thrown to the dogs  VIII  Then  Divorce  but we laugh at such frivolous things  Having here no intention to part  We are wed to our Wine Wine regen'rates the springs  Of that selfmoving muscle the Heart  IX  Though to Wine we are wed yet we do not think fit  To be tied down for  better  for  worse  If our landlord  Adultery  dares to commit  At once we demand a  Divorce  X  But at present I hope with an Englishman's ease  We enjoy both our Wine and our Wives  By Liberty bless'd with the pleasure to please  May we live all the days of our lives  SONG VIII NUNC EST BIBENDUM  Tune  Moggy Lauder  I  NOW we're free from College Rules  From Commonplacebook reason  From trifling syllogistic Schools  And Systems out of Season  Never more we'll have defin'd  If Matter thinks or thinks not  All the matter we shall mind  Is he who drinks or drinks not  II  Metaphysic'ly to trace  The Mind or Soul abstracted  Or prove Infinity of Space  By cause on cause effected  Better Souls we can't become  By immaterial thinking  And as to Space we want no room  But room enough to drink in  III  Plenum vacuum minus plus  Are learned words and rare too  Those terms our Tutors may discuss  And those who please may hear too  A Plenum in our Wine we show  With Plus and Plus behind sir  And when our Cash is minus low  A Vacuum soon we find sir  IV  Copernicus  that learned sage  Dane  Tycho  's error proving  Declares in I can't tell what page  The Earth round Sol is moving  But which goes round what's that to us  Each is perhaps a notion  With Earth and Sun we make no fuss  But mind the Bottle's motion  V  Great  Galileo  ill was us'd  By Superstition's fury  Antipodeans  were abus'd  By ignoramus jury  But feet to feet we dare attest  Nor fear a treatment scurvy  For when we're drunk  probatum est  We're tumbling topsy turvy  VI  Newton  talk'd of Lights and Shades  And different Colours knew sir  Don't let us disturb our heads  We will but study two sir  White  and  Red  our glasses boast  Reflection and Refraction  After him we name our Toast  "The Center of Attraction"  VII  On that Thesis we'll declaim  With  stratum super stratum  There's mighty magic in the name  'Tis Nature's Postulatum  Wine in nature's next to love  Then wisely let us blend 'em  First tho' physically prove  That  Nunc nunc est bibendum  SONG IX ENGLISH LITANY  TUNE  When I enter'd my Teens and threw playthings aside  I  TO a StageCoach we aptly may liken this Nation  Where Passengers seldom are pleas'd with their station  But wrangling and jangling and jostling and jumbling  The Insidefolks grin and the Outsides are grumbling  II  The Inns they are in and the Outs they are out  To be in is the Riddle which makes all this route  The Outs call the Ministry infamous elves  And the Inns when they're out say the same things themselves  III  It is cunning Credulity ever enslaves  The world is a Hotbed to raise Fools and Knaves  They pull this and that way sometimes pull together  But Commonsense scorns to go partners with either  IV  My  Country  my  Freedom  and oh my  Religion  These tickle the ear faith like  Mahomet  's pigeon  'Tis the time's cant the farce the finesse of all ages  For what the best actors of get the best wages  V  Oh my Country  but hold sir on which side the  Tweed  Wa worth tul your words if ye dinna tak hede  We give praise to one side the other abuse  Can the unborn their place of nativity chuse  VI  Off Prejudice off to Oblivion's cave  We boast we are Britons as Britons behave  Can this or that side of a stream alter nature  No wash those reflections away in the water  VII  Get get is the cry now and get all ye can  If ye can get get honestly get though's the plan  Get  one thing  and ev'ry thing else you'll obtain  For Honours are now humble servants to Gain  VIII  The African Slavedealers some may think base  But what must they thinkif at home 'tis the case  The  Guinea trade  here keeps a market 'tis certain  And  Yes  and  No  bought and sold more's the misfortune  IX  When a Beauty's enjoy'd by a Man of the Town  What he doted last week on this week he'll disown  The Selfsellers thus become those people's scoff  Who first turn them Prostitutes then turn them off  X  May all be turn'd off who those dealings befriended  Where honester folks have been sometimes suspended  May they die as they liv'd by all good men abhorr'd  WE BRITONS BESEECH THEE TO HEAR US GOOD LORD  SONG X The MARINE MEDLEY  First tune  Come and listen to my ditty  I  NOW safe moor'd with bowl before us  Messmates heave a hand with me  Lend a Brother Sailor Chorus  While he sings our Lives at Sea  O'er the wide waveswelling ocean  Toss'd aloft or tumbled low  As to fear 'tis all a notion  When our Time's come we must go  II  Tune  Life is chequer'd  Hark the boatswain hoarsely bawling  By topsail sheets and haulyards stand  Down topgallants down be hauling  Down your staysails hand boys hand  Now set the braces  Don't make wry faces  But the lee topsail sheets let go  Starboard here  Larboard there  Turn your quid  Take a swear  Yo yo yo  III  First Tune again  Oh ye Landmen idly lying  All alongside Beauty's Charms  Safe in soft beds seas defying  Free from all but Love's alarms  While on billows billows rolling  Death appears in every form  On no Lady Laps we're lolling  No kind Kiss can calm the Storm  IV  But loud peals on peals are clashing  Through rift rocks the shrill wind shrieks  In our eyes fierce lightning flashing  Scorch the sails and stench the decks  Bursting clouds upon us pouring  Black o'erspread the face of day  Burying seas in whirlpools roaring  Fierey flies the sparkling spray  V  High the tossing Tempest heaves us  Tow'rds the Pole aloft we go  While the clouds seem to receive us  Dreadful yawns the gulph below  In that dark deep down down down down  Down we sink from sight of sky  By the swell as instant up thrown  Hark what means yon dismal cry  VI  The foremast's gone yells some sad tongue out  O'er the lee twelve feet 'bove deck  A leak beneath the chestree's sprung out  Call all hands to clear the wreck  Quick the lannyard's cut in pieces  Come my Hearts be stout and bold  Plumb the well the leak encreases  Four feet water's in the hold  VII  Worse and worse the wild winds tearing  Warring waves around us foam  For the worst while we're preparing  Nature sinks and sighs for Home  There our babes perhaps are saying  In their little lisping strain  As round mother's knees they're playing  Daddy soon will come again  VIII  Tune  Early one morn a jolly young Tar  If we must die why die we must  'Tis a birth in which all must belay mun  When our debt's due for Death won't trust  Then all hands be ready to pay mun  As to Life's striking its Flag never fear  Our Cruise is out that's all my brother  In this world we've luff'd it up thus

 Rising rocks appear before us  Hopeless yet for help we call  Ev'ry sea breaks fatal o'er us  To the Storm's fell power we fall  X  Now Dismay with aspect horrid  Swells each sleepless eye with tears  And Despair with bristly forehead  On each bloodless face appears  Sadly still we wait the Wave  Th' o'erwhelming Wave rolls mountain high  The swell comes on our seagreen grave  Hark what means yon happy cry  XI  The Leak we've found it cannot pour fast  We've lighten'd her a foot or more  Up and rig a jury ForeMast  She rights she rights boys wear off shore  Now my Hearts we're safe from

our looks we rejoic'd we just now were not seen  But when Pleasure prompts Reason always sneaks off  When over he bullylike enters to huff  VI  Just like an old Watchman the Goblin was drest  Grey hairs pole and lanthorn broad belt and long vest  Young Fellow quoth  He  it is time you shou'd think  Old Fellow quoth  Me  it is time you shou'd drink  VII  offer'd a Flask of Champaign on my knee  And begg'd as my Doctor he'd drink for his fee  prais'd his wise seeming my praises prevail'd  For Flattery's a nostrum which never yet fail'd  VIII  With Praises with Bumpers I ply'd him so long  That himself he forgot and wou'd sing us a Song  Aye and dance nay a wench he wou'd have and he swore  But attempting to rise he fell drunk on the floor  IX  As I order'd a Bed says my lovelooking Fair  "As to Bed my dear Reason has no business there  "The Senses their title to that Manor prove  "Let Reason sleep on while we waken to Love"  The MORAL  Reason is but a Bugbear to scare girls and

dress'd cleanly tho' coarse  To their Babes while unheeding the Traveller trots  They shew the fine Man and his Horse  VI  At the heels of the Steed bark the base village Whelps  Each Puppy rude echo bestirs  But the Horse too high bred bounds away from their yelps  Disregarding the clamour of Curs  VII  Illiberal Railers thus Envy betray  When Merit above them they view  But Genius disdains to

an end of my joy  Then resolv'd this advice to her sex she wou'd send  Ne'er to wed 'till they're sure they can wed to some end  VII  And which end is that why the end which prevails  Ploughs ships birds and fishes are steer'd by their Tails  And tho' man and wife for the Head may contend  I'm sure they're best pleas'd when they gain t'other end  VIII  The end of our wishes the end of our wives  The end of our loves and the end of our lives  The end of conjunction 'twixt mistress and male  Tho' the Head may design has its end in the tail  IX  'Tis time tho' to finish if ought I intend  Lest

fair Lady of Light  From saffron robes shaking the last shade of Night  Call'd  Phoebus  who bless'd with his sea beauty's boon  Slow awoke  Thetis  vow'd  'twas immensely too soon  II  Above the horizon his beams circling spread  The grey dappled clouds fring'd transparent with red  The breezy air rich with the perfumes of May  While birds on the boughs chirp'd and sung in the day  III  Shall

look on Timekillers's distress  Who dress dine and daudledine daudle and dress  In one senseless saunter dream  Day  and  Night  thro'  In nothing to say andin nothing to do  VI  As for thinking  Today  'tis absurd to begin  A head fine frizzur'd wants no finish within  Tomorrow  's the wildgoose at which they take aim  A mouthful of moonshine they get for their game  VII  Let us lads depend on Life's plaindealing plan  Not kill Time but keep all alive while we can  Day  and  Night  too our welcome to Beauty we'll pay  Love equal expects both  good Night  and  good Day  VIII  To  Night

Tune  Guildford Stile  I  WHEN Prudence declaims how time passes  Cou'd we tempt Mr  Chronos  to stay  While we're bump'ring a round of our lasses  We wou'd wait upon all he cou'd say  But is it worth while  Through books to toil  In troubling our heads how to think  Thought ne'er was design'd  To puzzle the mind  Let us only mind how we drink  II  There was  Solomon  one of the wise things  When past it began to complain  He affected at last to despise things  Because his was labour in vain  But used to say  There's time to play  To labour to love and to think  Let those in their prime  Remember the time  At present 'tis time we shou'd drink  III  A pox on Reflection be jolly  Dispassionate Cynics despise  Did you once know the raptures of folly  You never wou'd wish to be wise  I

from my Flocks that had stray'd  YE delicate lovelies with leave I maintain  That happiness here you may find  To yourselves I appeal for Felicity's reign  When you meet with a man to your mind  II  When Gratitude Friendship to Fondness unites  Inexpressive endearments arise  Then hopes fears and fancies strange doubts and delights  Are announc'd by those tell tales the eyes  III  Those technical terms in the science of Love  Cold schoolmen attempt to describe  But how should they paint what they never can prove  For Tenderness knows not their tribe  IV  Of all the abuse on enjoyment that's thrown  The treatment Love takes most amiss  Is the rant of the coxcomb the sot and the clown  Who pretend to indulge on a Kiss  V  The love of a fribble at self only aims  For sots and clownsclass them with beasts  No fibre no atom have they in their frames  To relish such delicate feasts  VI  In circling embraces when lips to lips move  Description oh teach me to praise  The Overture KISS to th' Op'ra of Love  But Beauty wou'd laugh at the phrase  VII  Love's preludes are Kisses and after the play  They fill up the pause of delight  The rich repetitions which never decay  The Lip's silent language at night  VIII  The raptures of KISSING we only can taste  When sympathies equal inspire  And while to enjoyment unbounded we haste  Their breath blows the coals of desire  IX  Again and again and again Beauty sips  What feelings these pressures excite  When fleeting life's stopp'd by a Kiss of the lips  Then sinks in a sigh of delight  MORAL  Whilst our glasses we kiss and we frolick at ease  Of Happiness ne'er may we miss  May we live as we list may we kiss whom we please  And may we still please whom we kiss  SONG XXXVII BARTLEME FAIR  Tune  Young Strephon he went t'other day to the Wake  I  WHILE gentlefolks strut in their silver and sattins  We poor folks are tramping in straw hats and pattens  As merrily Old English ballads can singo  As they at their opperores outlandish lingo  Calling out bravo encoro and caro  Tho'f I will sing nothing but Bartleme Fairo  II  Here first of all crowds against other crowds driving  Like wind and tide meeting each contrary striving  Here's fiddling and fluting and shouting and shrieking  Fifes trumpets drums bagpipes and barrowgirls squeaking  My rare round and sound here's choice of fine wareo  Tho' all is not sound sold at Barleme Fairo  III  Here are drolls hornpipe dancing and shewing of postures  Plumporridge blackpuddings and op'ning of oysters  The taphouse guests swearing and gall'ry folks squawling  With saltboxes solos and mouthpieces bawling  Pimps pickpockets strollers fat landladies sailors  Bawds baileys jilts jockies thieves tumblers and taylors  IV  Here's Punch's whole play of the gunpowderplot Sir  Wild beasts all alive and peaseporridge hot Sir  Fine sausages fry'd and the Black on the wire  The whole court of France and nice pig at the fire  The upsanddowns who'll take a seat in the chairo  There are more ups and downs that at Bartleme Fairo  V  Here's Whittington's cat and the tall dromedary  The chaise without horses and Queen of Hungary  The merrygorounds come who rides come who rides  Wine beer ale and cakes fireeating besides  The fam'd learned dog that can tell all his letters  And some men as scholars are not much his betters  VI  This world's a wide fair where we ramble 'mong gay things  Our passions like children are tempted by playthings  By sound and by shew by trash and by trumpery  The fallals of fashion and Frenchify'd frumpery  Life is but a droll rather wretched than rareo  And thus ends the ballad of Bartleme Fairo  SONG XXXVIII RURAL FELICITY  Tune  On Marketday last I remember the time  I  LET court lovers pay adoration to crowns  That man is a monarch for me  Who chearful improves the few acres he owns  Unenvying industrious and free  II  At night in high health from his labour he rests  His houshold sit round in a row  Wife children and servants domestical guests  Such circles in town can ye shew  III  He smiles on his babes as some strive for his knee  And some to their mother's neck clung  While playful the prattlers for place disagree  The roof with their shrill trebles ring  IV  Those Cynics who brood o'er a single life's spleen  The offspring they have dare not own  But happywed pairs can enjoy the fond scene  To you ye unsocials unknown  V  His dame the good man of the house thus address'd  'Twas so with us when we were young  Her hand within his he with gentleness press'd  While sentiment prompted his tongue  VI  I remember the day of my falling in love  How fearful I first came to woo  I hope that these boys will as truehearted prove  And our lasses my dear look like you  VII  A tear of joy starting he kiss'd from her cheek  Love gratefully glowing her face  Too full her fond heart not a word cou'd she speak  But sighing return'd his embrace  VIII  'Tis by such endearments affection is shewn  In silence more nobly express'd  Than all the cant phrase the  Bon Ton  of the town  Where Love is a Monmouthstreet guest  IX  Go on ye high births and pretend to despise  Those scenes which to you are unknown  But laugh not too long rather aim to be wise  And compare such a life with your own  X  Vain jesters be mute I'll a Sentiment give  A Toast which esteem will not scorn  May they who can taste them Love's kisses receive  And Tenderness meet a return  SONG XXXIX THE TOPER  Tune  Shanbuy  YE lads of true spirit pay courtship to Claret  Released from the trouble of thinking  A fool long ago said we nothing cou'd know  The fellow knew nothing of drinking  To pore over Plato  Or practice with Cato  Dispassionates dunces might make us  But men now more wise  Selfdenial despise  And live by the lessons of  Bacchus  II  Big wigg'd in fine coach see the Doctor approach  And solemnly up the stairs pace  Gravely smell on his cane apply finger to vein  And count the repeats with grimaces  As he holds pen in hand  Life and Death's at a stand  A tossup which party will take us  Away with his cant  No prescription we want  But the nourishing nostrums of  Bacchus  III  We jollily join in the practice of Wine  While misers 'midst millions are pining  While ladies are scorning and lovers are mourning  We laugh at wealth wenching and whining  Drink drink now 'tis prime  Toss a bottle to Time  He'll not make such haste to o'ertake us  His threats we prevent  And his cracks we cement  By the styptical Balsam of  Bacchus  IV  What work there is made by the newspaper trade  Of this man and t'other man's station  The  Ins  are all bad and the  Outs  are all mad  In  and  Out  is the cry of the nation  The politic patter  Which both parties chatter  From bumpering freely shan't shake us  With halfpints in hand  Independent we'll stand  To defend  Magna Charta  of  Bacchus  V  Be your motion well tim'd you're charg'd and you're prim'd  Have a careRight and left and make ready  Right hand to glass joinat lips rest the wine  But be in your exercise steady  Our levels we boast  When our women we toast  May graciously they undertake us  No more we desire  So drink

Majority low  Then just at the sellingprice give  Yes  or  No  VIII  We take or are all in our turns taken in  The World to be sure 'tis a shame and a sin  Might soon be much betterbut who will begin

XLV DICK AND DOLL  Tune  I'm like a Skiff on the Ocean toss'd  I  AS one bright summer's sultry day  For sake of shade I sought the grove  Thro' thicksethedge on top of hay  I met with mutual Love  A Youth with one arm round his pretty Girl's waist  On small swelling breasts he his other hand plac'd  While she cry'd  Dick be still  Pray tell me what's your will  II  "I come quoth Dick to have some chat"  And close to hers his lips he squeez'd  "I guess cries Doll what you'd be at  "But now I won't be teaz'd"  She strove to rise up but his strength held her down  She call'd out for help and petition'd the Clown  "O Dick dear let me rise  "The Sun puts out my eyes  III  "I'll tear your soul outLord these men  "If everwellI won't submit  "Why what the DevilCurse me then  "You'll fling me in a fit"  Down like a bent lily her head dropp'd aslant  Her eyes lost the daylight her breath became scant  And feebly on her tongue  Expiring accents hung  IV  The chorus birds sung o'er their heads  The breeze blew rustling thro' the grove  Sweet smelt the hay on newmown meads  All seem'd the scene of Love  Dick offer'd to lift up the Lass as she lay  A look full of tenderness told him to stay  "So soon Dick will you go  "I wishdear meheigh ho"  V  Vibrating with heartheaving sighs  Her tucker trembling to and fro'  Her crimson'd cheeks her glist'ning eyes  Proclaim'd Possession's glow  Dick bid her farewell but she languishing cry'd  As wanton she play'd by her fall'n Shepherd's side  "A moment pray sit still  "Since now you've had your will"  VI  "Lord cries the Girl you hasty men  "Of Love afford but one poor proof  "Our Fowls at home each Sparrow Hen  "Is ten times better off  "No that you shou'd not had I known your design  "But since you've had your will pray let me have mine  "So once more e'er we rise  "Do dear Dick save my eyes"  SONG XLVI A SIMPLE PASTORAL  To a very simple Tune of  Christmas now is coming  I  AURORA Lady grey  Hides her face in blushes  Budding

You look like yon' Lily that droops in the vale  With my lips let me wipe off that tear  II  Disdain a reply to Malignity's tongue  Let Patience to Clamour submit  It is better that Slander shou'd say you was wrong  Than that you the wrong shou'd commit  III  The Atheist if really such madmen exist  Belief will delirious decry  In Infidel Doubtings pretend to persist  What they cannot conceive they deny  IV  Thus some of your sex old and ugly will rail  Like Atheists all goodness they doubt  Insisting men may o'er all beauties prevail  Because themselves could not hold out  V  You must pardon the cry think not strange what I say  They Mercy from you must receive  Be it known to your tenderness 'tis the world's way  Who injure will never forgive  VI  Smile smile and smile on let Day beam on

donor to drink  I began a new practice and that was to think  What my subject shou'd be kept me some time in doubt  I consider'd at last  what we all were about  II  Such frauds and such fractions such follies such fictions  Such outofdoor clamours and in contradictions  What must this be owing to why or from whence  What is it we wantwhy we want  Common Sense  III  O yes who can tell us where  Common Sense  dwells  Does it burnish Gold Roofs or strew Rushes in Cells  Does it beam in the Mine does it swim in the Sea  Does it wing the wide Air does it blossom the Tree  IV  If folks wou'd accept  Common Sense  as their guest  With  Meum  and  Tuum  at home they'll be bless'd  Not Lunatic Lacqueys run mad up and down  Nor mind any business but what was their own  V  But which is the way to find  Common Sense  out  She feasts not on Turtlecuts in at no rout  Get the Tub Cynic's lanthorn we won't mind expence  But look by its light 'till we spy  Common Sense  VI  If chance she is seen tho' for fear we mistake her  She's natively neat like a lovely young Quaker  Pure Beauty despising false Drapery's aid  And  Common Sense  scorns all pedantic parade  VII  Let us first call at Court but perhaps we intrude  'Twas told so by Miss  Affectation  the Prude  There Fashion forbids the free use of the mind  What can  Common Sense  say in a place so refin'd  VIII  Then at Church to be sure  Common Sense  there succeeds  Unless  Superstition  should choak it with weeds  And tho'  Infidelity  dares a pretence  She's easily vanquish'd by plain  Common Sense  IX  When I mention'd the Church you expected at least  In the commonplace mode some stale joke 'gainst a  Priest  That a laugh I shou'd raise at the Clergy's expence  But he who wou'd wish it must want  Common Sense  X  As to Trade no accounts can be well kept without her  Yet Stockjobbers say they know nothing about her  Bear witness 'ChangeAlleythe  Omniums  declare  Common Sense  shall for ever be  under Par  there  XI

Our Music gave French folks the vapours  It took an odd turn on  Conflans  We knew they were all fond of Capers  So set up an old English Dance  'Twas  Britons strike home  that we sounded  By the

Jove  granted the Boon  II  Then gently descending  Her sorrows befriending  His  Thyrsis  he struck 'gainst the bigbelly'd Earth  When o'er the smooth gravel  In murmuring travel  A spring of Champaign at her Head bubbled forth  She wak'd with the scent  Gave her sorrow fresh vent  Yet to drink was determin'd exhausted by tears  She tastes the Champaign  Licks her lips tastes again  And feels herself suddenly freed from her fears  III  As still she kept sipping  Her heart lightly leaping  She look'd upon  Thes  as a pitiful Elf  Wine turn'd her to singing  In hopes it wou'd bring in  A Lover'twas lonely to drink by herself  The God her Adorer  Confess'd stood before her  She hail'd the Celestial she welcom'd the Guest  Champaign stopp'd resistance  She kept not her Distance  But

Sentiments are for a  Sentiment Toast  And  Syntax  abolish for  bak'd boil'd  and  roast  So BEEF and a BUMPER for ever  SONG CXIII SPRING  Tune  Come pledge me Love c  I  LOOK round my Love how chang'd the Scene  So late white o'er with Snow  Now 'ray'd in flow'r enamell'd green  How rich the meadows shew  II  The Sun creative pow'r resumes  And warms the breezy air  The bursting buds expand their blooms  While birds their nests prepare  III  The Herds and Flocks on herbage feed  Sweet Spring renews its pride  The Icebound Streams from fetters freed  Now tinkling roll their tide  IV  On leafless boughs no candy'd frost  In icycles appears  But as in grief for Winter lost  Dissolving into tears  V  Thus sordid senseless Human Kind  But mere existence prove  'Till Beauty's Sunshine ope's the Mind  And melts the Mass to Love  VI  For spite of Wealth or Power's controul  Or all the Wise can say  'Till WOMAN warms the frozen soul  We are but Clods of Clay  SONG CXIV A WONDER  Tune  Since Life's but a Jest  I  A Wonder a Wonder a Wonder I'll shew  You'll wonder indeed when this Wonder you know  We are wonderful high and as wonderful low  Which nobody can deny  II  We always are wond'ring at ev'ry thing new  The good things we wonder at rich people do  'Tis a Wonder indeed if such Wonders are true  III  Some wonderful folks make a wonderful rout  While some blunder in other folks blunder out  We wonder what Blunderers can be about  IV  One Side says the Times are so good they are glad  The Times says the other side ne'er were so bad  No Wonder if this Side or that Side is mad  V  For the Times I some Patriot Changes propose  That our Taxes be less and we wear plainer cloaths  And that ev'ry wearer may pay what he owes  VI  Imprimisreflect on the Taxes on Wheels  On Cards and the Claret we waste at our meals  These grievances each party equally feels  VII  To be sure we must own 'tis cursed provoking  To see how some people their vices are cloaking  While  Virtue  but neighbours don't think I am jokeing  VIII  For my Grandfather said and his name's rever'd  That his Father's Father had often times heard  How  Virtue  when he was a schoolboy appear'd  IX  She fled without leaving behind her directions  'Twas in vain she observ'd to oppose such connexions  As Turtlefeasts Cuckoldoms Cards and Elections  X  You may think me severe but indeed you think wrong  I promis'd a Wonder at first in my Song  And the Wonder isHow cou'd you listen so long  Which nobody can deny  SONG CXV THE PARADE  Tune  While others strive by pompous Phrase  I  LET those attend who seek the choice  Here independent we rejoice  We look we like we meet we part  As Instinct prompts the feeling heart  While many Groups miscall'd the great  Surrounded by insipid State  The Health of Peace abuse  In Party's tumult Pomp's fatigue  Place Popularity's intrigue  Life's social scenes they lose  II  The Danglers at a Birthnight's glare  As Toyshop Figures fin'ry wear  Like winnow'd chaff shift to and fro'  In all the fuss and farce of shew  As flies to Sunshine spread their wings  So up and down these idle things  In courtly Sunbeams play  The Nobles smile to see the train  Which with a blush they must maintain  To garnish Grandeur's day  III  Daughters of Dignity and Grace  Ye highbred Dames of haughty Race  What think you 'midst your Di'mond blaze  Your crouded Routs and  Gala  days  Tho' sordid Flatt'ry's servile grin  Extols your forms is all within  Fit for Contentment's dome  Sisters of Fashion laugh and love  Tho' round you all the Graces move  Yet how are things at Home  IV  Your stucco'd Cielings emboss'd Plate  Your Carpets Robes and Beds of State  Where Gold and Silver Cupids wove  Exbibit artificial Love  Can Down or fring'd Embroidery's art  Affection win or warm the Heart  Or strengthen Vigour's stores  Perhaps 'midst all the waste of Pride  The Fribble yawns at Beauty's side  Or sottish Husband snores  V  While we as marry'd folks shou'd do  On neat unvarnish'd Love fall to  Satiety ne'er bids us roam  We find Fruition's feast at home  Beyond all mercenary charms  Pure Inclination opes her arms  Give  Caesar Caesar  's due  May  Friendship  fill the manly breast  And  Gratitude  be Beauty's guest  And each to each be true  SONG CXVI THE FRIGHT  Tune  Ah Chloe transported I cry'd  I  ONE Ev'ning alone in the Grove  Miss sat on the side of the Green  She wonder'd at what they call Love  And what it was marry'd folks mean  "All night how I tumble and toss  "Yet neither want manner nor means  "Alas must I live to my Loss  "And wither away in my Teens  II  Young Rhodophil ran up the slope  As if he some Sport had in view  She trembl'd betwixt Fear and Hope  Irresolute what she shou'd do  She saw him advance to her seat  She saw him but cou'd not away  Love fix'd a large weight to her feet  Curiousity told her to stay  III  Desire gave grace to his tongue  As Lovers to Lovers will speak  Enamour'd he over her hung  Then bow'd down his Lips to her Cheek  He knelt she attempted to rise  Tho' 'twas but a feeble essay  The wildness he wore in his eyes  So scar'd her she fainted away  SONG CXVII TIME KILLERS  Tune  How foolish weak Women believe  I  HOW weak is the Wisdom of Man  How foolish the fancy of Taste  Admitting that Life's but a Span  That Span must we wantonly waste  About we dissatisfy'd move  And ramble from climate to clime  Yet neither enjoy nor improve  But only alas to kill Time  II  Ye Husbands rash Dupes to Excess  Pretend to live damn'd honest lives  Ingrates to the good ye possess  You abuse both your Time and your Wives  At midnight inebriate reel  A prey to foul Prostitute's lure  O think what Affection must feel  What delicate Wives may endure  III  The Gunloaded 'Squire will toil  All day with keen Industry's care  Incessantly anxious to spoil  The innocent Tenants of Air  Or after the Fox bursts away  Swift down the wind gallops along  The Mischiefs that chance in the Day  At Night furnish Fun for a Song  IV  At Toilets how Beauties appear  Like Fowlers they arm and take aim  High charg'd with Curls tier over tier  And animal Man is their Game  Sometimes with less dangerous arts  The fair Dissipations pursue  If Trifles did not take their parts  With horrid Time what cou'd they do  V  When fine Women do as they please  They hear not the Nursery's din  No Husband's absurdities teize  They fly such dull Scenes to  cut in  Dear Bragg Hazard Loo and Quadrille  Delightful extatic immense  With them each Reflection they kill  And escape all the trouble of Sense  VI  Yet Lovelies before 'tis too late  While yet the pulse beats in its prime  Consider that wrinkles await  And make up your Quarrel with Time  Before 'tis too late so will we  Too long I've your patience be rhim'd  With Time may we henceforth agree  And henceforth all things  e welltim'd  SONG CXVIII THE FUNERAL  Tune  Come ye careless come and hear me  I  SEE the Pallsupporting Bearers  All in Undertaker's shew  See the train of Sablewearers  Acting ev'ry Mode of woe  Silent crouds the spot surrounding  Call'd the GRAND RECEIVER's Dome  Dismal tolling Tenor sounding  Fellow Mortals follow Home  II  List oh list ye State Declaimers  On whose words the many dwell  Placebestowing Patriottamers  Hark oh hark 'tis Grandeur's Knell  Heralds loud proclaim the Honours  Which this once puissant past  Tell his Titles count his Manors  Lord of only this at last  III  View the Tomb with Sculpture splendid  View the Sod with Briars bound  There the Farce of Finery's ended  All are equal under ground  Fashions  there there  Envy  's banish'd  Beauties there can't plead their forms  There  Precedencies  are vanish'd  Offals ALL to odious worms  IV  Wise folks weak ones poor and wealthy  Tenant unremitting Graves  Haughty humble sick and healthy  Britons sons and Asian slaves  Gloom no more the brow with sorrow  Meet the moment come what may  If we're all to dye Tomorrow  Let us live my Lads Today  V  We'll not lavish Life's expences  Nor be Niggards when we pay  Let us please not pall our Senses  This is Reason's holiday  Here to Dunces bid defiance  Affectations disapprove  Here's my Toast  The grand Alliance  FRIENDSHIP FREEDOM WIT and LOVE  SONG CXIX THE COBLER OF CRIPPLEGATE  Tune  Had pretty Miss been at a DancingSchool bred  I  THO' a  Cobler  is call'd but a low occupation  The practice of  cobling  is come into fashion  From me up to those who wou'd  cobble  the nation  II  ome say that Old England wants  heelpiecing  true  Our Country is trod upon like an old Shoe  And may  Heelpieces  want aye and  Headpieces  too  III  One  vamping  our old Constitution pretends  And  turn  and  translate  it to serve self and friends  All this is but  botching  to serve their own  Ends  IV  Each Roof in this Island with Liberty rings  The Good of their Country each Partyman sings  The Sense of that Phrase is My Country's good Things  V  If I but how shou'd I the State have a hand in  Good souls I'd be picking the bad be disbanding  And then we shou'd come to a right understanding  VI  Against Want the cunning man wifely provides  A Storm shunning shepherd beneath a bush hides  o as the Times change we are sure to change Sides  VII  With my  Awl  in my hand I'll Old England defend  Giving room to my betters who've much room to mend  lay they soon become better or soon have an end  VIII  To those who are heedless what here may mishap  Their hearts are as hard as the Stone in my lap  They're taking their swing wou'd their swing was my Strap  IX  I begin to wax warm so I'll close up my seam  Or else I cou'd hammer out such a fine theme  It was about something I saw'd in a dream  X  To my  Last  I am come and that shall not last long  So this is the last of a poor Cobler's Song  May they now be right who till now have been wrong  SONG CXX MUM  Tune  Ye medley of mortals  I  YE Gossips who blab out the secrets of State  Ye Telltales who over the teatables prate  Ye Boasters of Favours from Beauties o'ercome  Be wiser poor Pratlers henceforward be  mum  Sing tantararara mum all  II  Ye Wives who have Husbands neglecting their duties  That time give the Bottle that's due to your beauties  Would you cure them take care when in drink they reel home  To receive them with smiles and resolve to be  mum  III  It is good to hold fast to hold much or hold long  But the best hold of all is the holding your Tongue  Tho' Wits by their words good companions become  Can they get half so much as the Man who is  mum  IV  The Servant who slily keeps silent will rise  His ears he must doubt nor give faith to his eyes  Ask the fine Waitingmaid how she rich cou'd become  She will curt'sy and answer  because I was mum  V  But enough has been said and enough has been sung  Remember dear friends keep good watch o'er your Tongue  I have no more to say to an end I am come  My Rhymes are all out I must henceforth be  mum  Sing tantararara mum all  SONG CXXI THE PARENT  Tune  Away with the Strife the Uproar of State  I  A Fond Father's bliss is to number his race  And exult on the bloom that just buds on their face  With their prattle he'll daily himself entertain  And read in their smiles their lov'd mother again  Men of pleasure be mute this is Life's lovely view  When we look on our young ones our youth we renew  II  Thus living we love and thus loving enjoy  No Deceit here distracts no Debauches destroy  From the Maymorn of Youth unto Winter's white age  Hand in hand with contentment we sing thro' Life's stage  When Death bids us stop we end easy our Song  And give the Gods thanks that we've liv'd well so long  SONG CXXII THE HUM  Tune  Push about the brisk Bowl  I  PUSH about the brisk Bowl 'twill enliver the heart  While thus we sit round on theStay  What business have I an old Song to impart  When I Sirs a new one can say can say  When I Sirs a new one can say  II  What shall I first say or what shall I first do  What best will my bad voice become  Why faith Sirs I'll strive by my verses to shew  That Life is alas but a  Hum  III  Children weep at their birth and old men who they dye  At Death the most happy look glum  At our Entrance and Exit we equally cry  Which proves our Life's plainly a  Hum  IV  Law and Physic you see will make sure of the fee  What advice to you gratis will come  If poor you are lost tho' merit you boast  For  Worth  without  Wealth  is a  Hum  V  Acquaintance pretend that your fortunes they'll mend  And vow to your service they'll come  But be you in need and you'll find that indeed  Modern Friendship is merely a  Hum  VI  When some Ladies kneel small devotion they feel  But let us be modest and mum  At the altar they bow but 'tis only for shew  Religion with them is a  Hum  VII  We are  hum'd  from our birth till we're  hum'd  into earth  To an end of our jokes then we come  Take your Glass my brisk brother and I'll take another  And thus make the most of a  Hum  a  Hum  And let's make the most of a  Hum  SONG CXXIII SELF  Tune  I met with a Maiden one day at the Fair  I  SAYS I to my Tutor Sir what shall I do  Shall I think to accumulate pelf  Or Learning or Glory which must I pursue  Converse  quoth the Put  with yourself  II  Myself I address'd but Self seem'd in a huff  Replying  we ne'er shall agree  For  Drinking  and  Cards Folly Shame  and such stuff  Had charg'd all their Odiums on me  III  Non est factum  says I and resolv'd to be try'd  Conceit  bid me hope for some sport  To Sessions I ran I had  Laugh  on my side  Intending to hum the whole Court  IV  But  Reflection  a wretch who had no bus'ness there  Nor  Memory  yet wou'd come in  Repentance  bid  Pleasure  descend from the Chair  And order'd the Cause to begin  V  I begg'd a permission to call in my friends  To prove the defence I shou'd make  Quoth Self as to Friendship he serv'd his own ends  And only did things for my sake  VI  For his Mistress in Gaiety I was maintain'd  For me he a Madman has prov'd  Tho' he may to hundreds affection have feign'd  Yet me and me only he lov'd  VII  In a pet I resolv'd not a Witness to call  The  general Issue  my Plea  But challeng'd the Court Judge and Jury and all  That they were as guilty as me  VIII  'Tis the Loadstone of Life to that point the world turns  For Man is a miserly Elf  Who cries and laughs loves and hates flatters and scorns  As Interest acts upon Self  IX  But now I'm awake  I that Logic deny  Which proves Self the ruler of Man  To a Heart that can feel weeping Beauty apply  Let him think then of Self if he can  X  'Till WOMAN has civiliz'd savage mankind  We cannot susceptible prove  But when her perfections have beam'd on our mind  We're brighten'd to Wisdom and Love  XI  Ye Scoffers begone ye ridiculous base  To  Gratitude  first be my Toast  May  Merit  meet always with  Friendship  's embrace  And each in each other be lost  SONG CXXIV THE POINT  Tune  I will tell you what Friend  I  SINCE at last I am FREE  Contented I'll be  O'er briars barefooted to go  Or lost in the rain  Upon Sal'sbury Plain  Or left without cloaths in the snow  II  Or if I shou'd perch  On top of Paul's Church  The hottest day just about noon  Astride the cross sat  Without hood or hat  I'd whistle off pain with a Tune  III  For now I am FREE  No low spirits for me  I laugh at all Crosses I find  I think as I please  And reflect at my ease  For Liberty i  les in the mind  IV  To my Fancy I live  And what Fancy can give  I enjoy tho' it is but a dream  Observe the world through  Do others pursue  Ought else than a fanciful scheme  V  Some fancy the Court  Some fancy Fieldsport  The Chace of a Beauty some chuse  The Topers with Wine  The Misers with Coin  And Poets are pleas'd with their Muse  VI  La Mancha  's mad Knight  With Windmills wou'd sight  Like him our attempts are a jest  With envy insane  And with projects so vain  Each sneers at the schemes of the rest  VII  This Extravagancy  On Folly or Fancy  Appears to be rather too long  With something that's shrewd  I wish to conclude  And make this an Epigram Song  VIII  In a Point it must end  On a Point I depend  And like a staunch Pointer I'll stand  I appoint you to sing  I appoint you to ring  And a Scotch Pint of Claret command  SONG CXXV TOM O' BEDLAM  Tune  Young Jockey be courted sweet Mogg the Brunette  I  BAREFOOT and Headbare his Blanket tight skewer'd  Tom o' Bedlam  paraded erect as my Lord  The Boys left their play at his raggedness scar'd  The Mob pity struck at his misery star'd  Girls laugh'd and the Fops fashion form'd for the day  Shrill screaming on tiptoe stole trembling away  While Infants crept close in their mothers arms hid  Tom  Beautylike mov'd heedless what harm he did  II  Where's the Devil  quoth Tom  where's the Devil I say  Good folks have you not seen the Devil today  A Brother just cur'd cries "Where Old Nick does dwell  "Come hither I'll shew youlook there is his Hell  "Behold those round Pillars with Ram'shorns on top  "A Palace some call it I say 'tis his Shop  "  Attendance Dependance  there move round and round  "And where such a Dance is the Damn'd must

by  Promises  fed  "I honour the  Great  who dare greatly behave  "I  dissent  not from  Pique  nor  assent  as a  Slave  "For  Englishmen  scorn base earn'd bread to receive"  Such a damn'd life  quoth Tom  I'll be damn'd if I live  IV  That moment a  Methodist  came to the place  Hair tuck'd behind ears and Zeal's cant on his face  He threaten'd he groan'd he grimac'd and he whin'd  The Mad Fellows mounted and seiz'd him behind  The Multitude question'd why he was us'd thus  He has broke out  quoth Tom  he's you see one of us  To their Hospital dragg'd him he there was unloos'd  Tom cry'd out  At Bedlam is Madness refus'd  V  His Comate reply'dBrother  Tom  do not fret  The World only works now for what it can get  Such sad objects as we are it cares not about  What has Interest to do with us two in or out  But this a Decoy Duck who brings in great gains  And tunnels his hearers by turning their brains  If he's stopp'd folks will follow some mischief as bad  For one way or other the  World  will be  mad  VI  Here's a Bumber my Boys may we still find the way  To speak what we know and to know what we say  Ye big Wigs of  Gresham  some  Nostrum  compound  To keep our  Heads  clear and preserve our  Hearts  sound  May  Greatness  and  Goodness  as partners agree  May our sons like ourselves social sing WE ARE FREE  And may we self conscious presumption despise  Nor e'er be so  mad  as to think ourselves  wise  SONG CXXVI SEMELE  Tune  Hang whining and pining lay hold of your Glass  I  EXtinguish the candles give  Phoebus  fair play  The shutters unbolt let us honour the day  My Lady  Lucina  we've drove from her post  The Sun shines upon us we'll give him a Toast  II  Says  Caution  the neighbours are passing along  They'll look thro' the sashes and tell us we're wrong  Remonstrance  avauntwhat is all they can say  But they've slept all night whilst we drank it away  III  Ye Tutors Disputers ye dignify'd Doctors  Ye Majors ye Minors with Prebends and Proctors  What Sense is it prithee which tells us to think  When all our seven Senses declare we shou'd drink  IV  Our Patron is  Bacchus  and  Jove  was his Sire  He was born in a Burst of Celestial Fire  Mamma  begg'd the God wou'd come worthy her charms  The Light'ning of Love prov'd too much for her Arms  V  From her in a moment the Baby was snatch'd  And into a Buck by Nurse  Jupiter  hatch'd  Th' Immortal to expiate  Semele  's Rape  Bestow'd on his Foundling the Gift of the Grape  VI  Ye Lovesick who live on the Shine of an Eye  The Red of a Cheek or the Tone of a Sigh  Impress'd by the Smiles or the Frowns of a Fair  As Weatherglass shews Variations of Air  VII  In Country or Town you have seen without doubt  A  DancingBear  led by a ring in his snout  While  Pug  plays his tricks if you shew him some fruit  These Emblems ye Ladies will most Lovers suit  VIII  If Girls won't comply why we never run mad  But away to the next as enough may be had  If again we're repuls'd we ne'er hang nor despair  But in Wine comfort seek we are sure of it there  IX  Draw your Bows ye  Crochetti  in Music's defence  With  Sound  I'm for having a portion of  Sense  Give me a Bell's Tinkle a  fat  Landlord's Roar  With a good Fellow's Bellow  Bring six Bottles more  X  Six Bottles we'll have them and bumper away  We've drank up the Night and we'll drink down the Day  Here's their Healths who to Wine and their Words will be just  Here's the Girl that we love and the Friend we can trust  SONG CXXVII CONTENTMENT  Tune  Ye Nobles who hurry thro' ev'ry gay Toil  I  THE Poachers for Fortune who Damsels ensnare  With Dress and Addresses deceive  To Lasses of Wealth how those Miscreants swear  And alas how the Lasses believe  II  Nay some Ladies seem to expect being lost  They trust whom they know are forsworn  They listen to him who has ruin'd the most  And hope to be ruin'd in turn  III  Can this be believ'dnothe Songmaker jokes  'Tis the tale of a slanderous crew  A Sighthen I fear that there may be some folks  Who are sorry to say it is true  IV  But when Love for Love is received on each side  How Tenderness smiles on the pair  This this is a triumph and this is my pride  I enjoy such a favourite Fair  V  No Paint in her Faceno Art in her Mind  Her Thoughts are explain'd by her Eyes  From  Principle  faithful from  Gratitude  kind  And scorns the Deceit of Disguise  VI  All along on the Slope by the side of a stream  Our hours we happily pass  My Head on her Lap while my Love is her Theme  And my Looks I lift up to my Lass  VII  Enjoying the Breeze from the fields of new hay  We gather the Summer's sweet pride  Or point to the Brook where the small Fishes play  And count them beneath the clear tide  VIII  In Rooms rich embellish'd with Luxury's Store  Let wealth pamper'd Indolence yawn  Let Wantonness act her deliriums o'er  'Till Dupes to her dungeon are drawn  IX  Let commonplace Fondness her blandishments spread  And tempt by the Toilet's parade  The Squeeze the soft Sigh wanton Glance and sly Tread  Are Pantomine Tricks of her Trade  X  I have try'd and can tellI have frolick'd away  And follow'd the fashion of Fun  The same Farce have acted that's play'd at this day  And while the World wheels will be done  SONG CXXVIII GIVE THE DEVIL HIS DUE  Tune  To take in good part the soft Squeeze c  I  THERE is one thing my Friends I must offer to you  'Tis  Give to Old Nick what to Old Nick is due  What  he  owes to us I can venture to say  Like a Daemon of Rank upon Honour he'll pay  II  Tho' you smile at my System and sneer at my Song  His Worship's allow'd to be Prince of  Bon Ton  Now thus lies the bus'ness Sirs as we're polite  And practise good manners pray what is his Right  III  The Devil is in you  's a phrase daily us'd  Yet oft by such language the Devil's abus'd  Tho' some hollow Hearts may have much room to spare  The Devil himself wou'd not chuse to dwell there  IV  Some People affect with this World to be sick  And give themselves up in a pet to Old Nick  Devil fetch me  they cry but if SATAN they knew  His  Honour  has much better bus'ness to do  V  Tho' of Darkness he's King he's a Prince of the Air  And with his  Infernalship  we shou'd deal fair  The chearful Day's rul'd by the  Angel  of Light  And the  Devil  Lord bless us is  Monarch  of  Night  VI  His torturing spirits around him await  As Watchmen attend on the Constable's state  Those Imps of Authority sally in shoals  And pennyless Strumpets drag in as damn'd Souls  VII  The Hell upon Earth and Life's Dev'lish Disease  Is Poverty sinning and seiz'd on for Fees  Deep in Darkness that Dross we call Money was hid  A proof that the Use on't to us was forbid  VIII  But  Pluto  the Devil's old heathenish name  Brought it forth from below as a Varnish for Shame  Persuasion Temptation  attended the Gold  'Till all have been bid for and few are unsold  IX  We are Dev'lishly odd in a Dev'lish odd Way  Since Bribe as Bribe can there's  the Devil to pay  The  Devil  of  Party  makes damnable rout  Tho' the  Devil  a bit can we tell what about  X  May  Satan  seize those who by purchase deceive  May they take the same Road who such things receive  But may we preserve HONEST Men tho' they're few  Export all the rest give  the Devil his Due  SONG CXXIX PRESENT TASTE  Tune  Last Night in my Dream I beheld a brown Lass  I  ONE day meeting  Momus  it was upon 'Change  Accosting the Droll withWhat News  By the Foot of  Alcides  quoth he it is strange  That the  English  shou'd  England  abuse  As  Locusts  in swarms cross the seas for

And  Britishborn Artists  are elbow'd by  Pimps  By  HairDressers Dancers  and  Cooks  III  English Merit  in vain may attempt at the lead  All the  Wit  in the world we may waste  But  Things  from beyond Sea are sure to succeed  They hit the high fashion of  Taste  To  Taste  and to  Honour  who has not a claim  They are worn without any expence  They are selfbestow'd Gifts they're  Egotists  Fame  They're  Knav'ry  and Dunces Defence  IV  English  might be allow'd in the rude days of yore  Such  Vulgars  we  caant  now endure  There is something so soft in the sound of  Signior  And immensely polite in  Messieur  How coarse sounds the SANDBYS in  Merit  indeed  Those  Brothers  embellish the age  Can such a rude name now as  Rooker  succeed  Besides he belongs to the Stage  V  All's  vulgar  and  horrid low wretched  and  flat  Of us thus the Connoissieur speaks  But  exquisite fine 'tis immense  and  all that  When he talks about  Gothics  and  Greeks  Perhaps my Address a

we see  Somebody  always in play  And  sometimes  that  something  may  somehow  be shewn  Yet  Nobody  only must  many Things  own  V  The Public is pester'd with many gay forms  Like Butterflies springing from Grubs and from Worms  Those  welldress'd Necessities  daily we view  In  Nobody  's bus'ness with  nothing  to do  VI  They've  nothing  to think on they've  nothing  to say  Nobody  's

of health  And  Water  quoth  Prudence  will win a man wealth  Tho' odd it may seem as the story's not long  Once Water help'd  Bacchus  and thus says the Song  IV  "It was when his Harvest rejoic'd the parch'd Earth  "Beneath the first Vine  Love  on  Wit  begot  Mirth  "Yet  Hate  rais'd some Rebels who broke from his sway  "And drunk with his bounty deny'd to obey  V  "He harness'd his Tygers he marshall'd his force  "  Silenus  was Sutler Lord  Pan  led the Horse  "The Ganges they cross'd came in front of the Foe  "And struck them all dead without striking a blow  VI  "'Twas  Pan  did the feat cast them into a fright  "He crept like a Fox thro' their camp in the night  "All the Wine he drew off while these Ignorants snor'd  "And into the Bottles foul Ditch  Water  pour'd  VII  Each Rebel next morn rais'd the Flask to his head  But chill'd the first gulp in an aguefit fled  Fled trembling from Monarch to meanest Mechanic  From hence came the Phrase to put Men in a  Paninic  SONG CXXXII MEDIOCRITY  Tune  Attempt to be happy but how can that be  I  IN a neighbourly way with an honest man's fame  Unoffending I hope to succeed  Attend if you please if you're pleas'd with a name  Imprimis let  Probity  lead  II  Be careful to keep on  Humility  's side  Nor ever lose  Gratitude  's view  Obey not the  Envy  of  Pique  nor of  Pride  Nor pilfer from  Merit  its due  III  Be assur'd that  Esteem  is a noble Estate  Let not a fond smile make you proud  Nor rail at Men merely because they are Great  Be not dup'd by the Roar of a Croud  IV  Shun  Flattery  's phrase let not  Promise  allure  Nor dangle for Dinners in Taste  Forget not old Friends tho' perhaps they are poor  Nor make new Acquaintance in haste  V  Oh suffer not  Interest Friendship  to wean  Accept not  Servility  's treat  Nor silently witness  Iniquity  's scene  But open at once on  Deceit  VI  Remember Yourself spare the shame of your Friend  Nor carry your  Wit  to excess  With Spirit the Cause of the Absent defend  And shrink not your arm from  Distress  VII  Oppress not the  Low  nor be High People's Slave  Nor ever despair nor be vain  Howe'er inconsistent the World may behave  Mediocrity  ever maintain  VIII  His views let  Ambition  extend o'er the State  Let  Avarice  gluttonize Wealth  No  Nabobs  I wish for I wou'd not be great  I only ask humbly for Health  IX  How chearful in Health will my latter days pass  Unenvy'd unenvying live  With the Friends I have prov'd and my fav'rite Lass  And PRACTICE THE PRECEPTS I GIVE  SONG CXXXIII THE SWEETHEARTS  Tune  Derry Down  I  SINCE the World is so old and the Times are so new  And every thing talk'd of except what is true  Among other stories my Fable may pass  Of four or five Sweethearts who courted a Lass  Derry Down  c  II  The first was from France alà mode de Paris  All fashion all feather bien Monsieur poudrie  He bow'd he took snuff cut a caper and then  He bow'd cut a caper and took snuff agen  III  A Dutchman advanc'd when the Lady he saw  He dropp'd down his pipe and he waddl'd  t yaw  With hands hid in pocket and unpolish'd leer  As frogs sing in courtship so croak'd out Mynheer  IV  From Connaught itself another Beau came  Macfinnin Macgragh Ballinbrough was his name  He bow'd to the Lass and he star'd at Mounseer  Clapp'd hand on his sword and said  AhArrah my Dear  V  The next a Mess John of rank Methodist Taint  Who thought like a sinner but look'd like a saint  Clos'd hands twirl'd his thumbs moving muckle his face  Then turn'd up his eyes as about to say grace  VI  A neat English Sailor in holiday trim  Who long lov'd the Lass and the Lass had lov'd him  Athawrt them all stept under arm toss'd his switch  Squar'd his hat op'd his pouch gave his trowsers a hitch  VII  He alongside her fell and he grappl'd on board  She struck the first broadside of kisses he pour'd  Then he tow'd her to church and as to the rest  What afterwards follow'd is easily guess'd  Derry Down  c  SONG CXXXIV A LESSON OF LOVE  Tune  Go on ye gay wantons c c  I  YE  Lexicon Critics  whose classical pride  Plain sense and plain English as moderns deride  Yet WOMAN dear WOMAN your minds could improve  Turn Students to her take  a Lesson of Love  II  Ye  Rustics  who burst from the arms of embrace  To Beauty's prefer the rude joys of the chace  So savage a practice no more you'll approve  When once you have practis'd  a Lesson of Love  III  At Midnight ye  Topers  when bump'ring your toast  Be careful of who and to whom 'tis you boast  If the tythe of those joys you pretend ye cou'd prove  Wine wou'd not have power to wean you from  Love  IV  Ye  Soldiers  who rush thro' the roughwork of war  As Statesmen may scheme or as Sovereigns jarr  Engagements more glorious at home ye may prove  So set up your standards and list under  Love  V  Ye  Busy  in traffick whose Cent per Cent lives  Can estimate justly all worthbut your  Wives  While th' Interests of Trade you so anxious improve  You neglect  their  demands and are bankrupts to  Love  VI  The Life of a Man is Inquietude's reign  Care dullness fatigue disappointment and pain  But clasp the fond Female those ills she'll remove  Such Witchcraft has Woman such Magic is  Love  SONG THE LAST OR EPILOGUE  Tune  Laura's Song in the Chaplet  I  THE  Wits  were wont in ancient times  To estimate their Age by Rhimes  A Ballad was their Schooling  We Moderns may perhaps be wrong  If not  likewise also  a Song  May fit us for our  Fooling  II  Imprimis there's the  Men of State  But hold I'll let alone the  Great  Lest I shou'd gain a Schooling  For  Greatness  was not form'd for sport  Tho' some folks  greatly  make their Court  By  greatly greatly Fooling  III  We play the  Fool  we act the  Wise  We barefac'd walk or wear disguise  As  Hopes  and  Fears  are  ruling  And yet with all our deeplaid wiles  From  John o' Nokes  to  Tom o' Stiles  What is it all but  Fooling  IV  If Men will think if Men will see  That all this  To  or  not to be  Is as we're hot or cooling  Today  on Expectation's wing  Tomorrow  off  'tis not the Thing  What is the Thing  why Fooling  V  Fool on Fool on for Life at best  Is but halfbred 'twixt Cry and Jest  As  Chance  not  Reason  's ruling  To  Chance  we owe our Rights and Wrongs  To CHANCE I dedicate these Songs  A BalladMaker's Fooling  G A S  FINIS  ERRATA  Pag Ver
