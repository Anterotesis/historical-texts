every needful thing in due season  So that a man cannot say this is worse than that  for in time they shall all be well approved  Ecclesiasticus  xxxix  REPTILES  WE are now to consider the class of reptiles which are for the most part objects of detestation but however the opinion of the world may be if a writer undertakes a general history of animals he must include them they form at lest one link in the chain of beings and may therefore be viewed with a degree of pleasure by a philosophic eye  But notwithstanding the prejudice against this class is almost universal is it founded on reason In some it may be owned that the outward form is disagreeable while the noxious qualities of others are justly productive of terror but are we on that account to reject them The more fatal they are the more deeply we should enquire into their effects that we may be capable of relieving those who are sufferers and secure others from the same misfortune But if we duly weigh their noxious qualities we shall with our moral poet find  All partial evil universal good  The teeth of wild beasts and of serpents are not only created as instruments of vengeance but are salutary in lessening the numbers of those animals which are highly useful in the degree and only hurtful in their excess but if their bad qualities are serviceable we are more indebted to their good ones than we chuse to acknowlege  But many of the animals that form this class are of immediate benefit to mankind The Turtle or SeaTortoise supplies the torrid zone with a wholesome and delicious food as the epicures of our own country can attest Frogs are a food in several parts as Lizards and Serpents are in others  The medicinal virtues of the Viper are partly exploded by the moderns but time the overthrower of systems as well as empires may restore it to the rank it held with the antients The  Lacerta Scincus  is however yet esteemed in the  East  for its salubrious qualities and even Toads have contributed to the ease of patients in the most inveterate of all diseases  Had I followed  Linnaeus  and included the Cartilaginous Fish in this class there would have been ample room for panegyric for it is very doubtful whether any are pernicious but the uses of many either as food or for mechanical purposes were never questioned  But if the external figure of the reptile tribe is disgusting they have one general beauty an apt configuration of parts for their way of life nor are they destitute of their peculiar graces the fine disposition of plates in the shell of the Tortoise with the elegant symmetry of their colors must strike even common observers while the eye of the despised Toad has a lustre denied to more pleasing forms The frolicsome agility of Lizards enlivens the dried banks in hot climates and the great affection which some of them shew to mankind should farther engage our regard and attention  The wreathing of the Snake with the vivid die of its skin are certainly graceful tho' from the dread of some particular species which are venemous we have acquired an antipathy for the whole The antients who considered the Serpent as an emblem of health could associate pleasing ideas with this animal We therefore find it an ornament at every entertainment and in every scene of mirth both in painting and in sculpture  Virgil  adopted this notion and has accordingly described it with every beauty both of form and color  Adytis cum lubricus anguis ab imis  Septem ingens gyros septena volumina traxit  Amplexus placidé tumulum lapsusque per aras  Coeruleae cui terga notae maculosus et auro  Squamam incendebat fulgor ceu nubibus arcus  Mille trahit varios adverso sole calores  V  From the deep tomb with many a shining fold  An azure serpent rose in scales that flam'd with gold  Like heaven's bright bow his varying beauties shone  That draws a thousand colors from the sun  Pleas'd round the altars and the tomb to wind  His glittering length of volumes trails behind  Pitt  But if after all some lively writer should pursue the Naturalists with more wit than argument and more humor than goodnature it should be endured with patience Ridicule is however not the test of truth tho' when joined to satyr it seldom fails  of seducing the many who had rather laugh than think Should this prove the case in the present instance let the author be allowed to skreen himself from censure by saying he writes not to the many but the few to those alone who can examine the parts with a view to the  whole  and who scorn to despise even the most deformed or the most minute work

in any other  Two were taken on the coast of  Cornwall  in the mackrel nets of a vast size a little after  Midsummer  the largest weighed eight hundred pounds the lesser near seven hundred  Doctor  Borlase  first published these animals to the world and discovered them in our seas  He describes them as having seven spiny or serrated ridges running from the head to the tail dividing the upper part of the back into equal parts  The fore legs as appear by his figure are remarkably long and narrow flat smooth and fleshy being destitute of scales The color of their upper side bluish their under side as well as that of the neck ruddy speckled with black  We suspect an error in the number of the hind legs the figure being represented with four an excess we never have met with in any of this genus  The head is painted extremely small in proportion to the size of the animal whose length was six feet nine inches  Size  and breadth from the tip of one fore leg to that of the other ten feet four inches  The covering of this species is compared to that of the  Testudo coriacea  of  Rondeletius  which has an integument resembling a tough strong hide and what is very singular neither that of the  Cornish  species nor yet that of the  French  naturalist seem by the figures to be divided into angular compartments by transverse sutures like the shells of all tortoises we have ever met with But the history of this kind remains still very obscure it is therefore to be wished that particular attention be paid to the next that is taken on our coasts and that observation be made whether the covering is crustaceous or coriaceous that we may be assured that these were the  European  kind not the  American  it seeming not improbable but they might be a couple that had escaped out of some  West India  ship that had foundered or been cast away near the  Cornish  coast  Genus II  Body naked Four legs the feet divided into toes No tail  FROGS  I The COMMON FROG    Arist Hist

properties are so singular that we cannot pass them unnoticed  Its spring or power of taking large leaps is remarkably great and it is the best swimmer of all fourfooted animals Nature hath finely adapted its parts for those ends the fore members of the body being very lightly made the hind legs and thighs very long and furnished with very strong muscles  While in a tadpole state it is entirely a wateranimal the work of generation is performed in that element as may be seen in every pond during spring when the female remains oppressed by the male for a number of days  The work of propagation is extremely singular  Generation  it being certain that the frog has not a  penis intrans  there appears a strong analogy in this case between a certain class of the vegetable kingdom and those  animals for it is well known that when the female frog deposits its spawn the male instantaneously impregnates it with what we may call a  farina foecundans  in the same manner as the male  Palm  tree conveys fructification to the flowers of the female which would otherwise be barren  Shaw's Travels    Hasselquist Trav Engl Ed    As soon as the frogs are released from their tadpole state they immediately take to land and if the weather has been hot and there fall any refreshing showers you may see the ground for a considerable space perfectly blackened by Myriads of these animalcules seeking for some secure lurking places Some philosophers  Rondeletius    Wormii Mus    not giving themselves time to examine into this phaenomenon imagined them to have been generated in the clouds and showered on the earth but had they like our  Derham  Ray's Wisdom Creat    but traced them to the next pool they would have found a better solution of the difficulty  As frogs adhere closely to the backs of their own species so we know they will do the same by fish  Walton  Complete Angler    mentions a strange story of their destroying pike but that they will injure if not entirely kill carp is a fact indisputable from the following relation a very few years ago on fishing a pond belonging to Mr  Pit  of  Encomb Dorsetshire  great numbers of the carp were found each with a frog mounted on it the hind legs clinging to the back the fore legs fixed in the corner of each eye of the fish which were thin and greatly wasted teized by carrying  so disagreeable a load These frogs we imagine to have been males disappointed of a mate  The croaking of frogs is well known and from that in fenny countries they are distinguished by ludicrous titles thus they are stiled  Dutch Nightingales  and  Boston Waites  even the  Stygian  frogs have not escaped notice for  Aristophanes  hath gone farther and formed a chorus of them  Comedy of the Frogs  Brekekex coax coax  Brekekex coax coax  The offspring of the pools and fountains  Yet there is a time of year when they become mute  Periodical Silence  neither croaking nor opening their mouths for a whole month this happens in the hot season and that is in many places known to the country people by the name of the  Paddock Moon  Morton  Hist Northampt    endeavours to find a reason for their silence but tho' his facts are true he is unfortunate in his philosophy Frogs are certainly endued as he well observed with a power of living a good while under water without respiration which is owing to their lungs being composed of a series of bladders but he mistakes the nature of air when he affirms that they receive a quantity of cool air and dare not open their mouths for a month from a dread of admitting a warmer into their lungs It is hardly necessary to say that in whatever state the air was received it  would assimilate itself to the external atmosphere in a short time We must leave the fact to be accounted for by farther experiments But from what we do know we may partly vindicate  Theophrastus  and other antients about the silence of the frogs at  Seriphus  That philosopher affirms it but ascribes it to the coldness of the waters in that island Now when Monsieur  Tournefort  was there the waters were lukewarm and the frogs had recovered their voices  Tournefort's voy  I  Is it not probable that  Theophrastus  might be at  Seriphus  at that season when the frogs were mute and having never observed it elsewhere might conclude their silence to be general as to the time but particular as to the place  Aelian  Aelian lib  iii  ch    who quotes  Theophrastus  for the last passage ascribes the same silence to the frogs of the lake  Pierus  in  Thessaly  and about  Cyrene  in  Africa  but he is so uncertain a writer that we cannot affirm whether the species of the  African  frogs is the same with ours  These  Food  as well as all other reptiles feed but a small space of the year The food of this genus is flies insects and snails Toads are said to feed also on bees and to do great injury to those useful insects  During winter frogs and toads remain in a torpid state the last of which will dig into the earth and cover themselves with almost the same agility as the mole  II The GIBBOUS FROG  Rana gibbosa  Gesner pisc    Rana esculenta  Lin syst    Faun suec No    R corpore angulato dorso

hideous of all animals the body broad the back flat and covered with a pimply dusky hide the belly large  swagging and swelling out the legs short and its pace labored and crawling its retreat gloomy and filthy in short its general appearance is such as to strike one with disgust and horror yet we have been told by those who have resolution to view it with attention that its eyes are fine to this it seems that  Shakespear  alludes when he makes his  Juliet  remark Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes As if they would have been better bestowed on so charming a songster than on this raucous reptile  But the hideous appearance of the toad is such as to make this one advantageous feature overlooked and to have rendered it in all ages an object of horror and the origin of most tremendous inventions  Aelian  Hist an lib  ix  c    makes its venom so potent that  Basilisk  like it conveyed death by its very look and breath but  Juvenal  is content with making the  Roman  ladies who were weary of their husbands form a potion from its entrails  Sat  vi Vide  Aelian Hist an lib  xvii  c  and  in order to get rid of the good man  Occurrit Matrona potens quae molle calenum

pains the toad's envenom'd juice  This opinion begat others of a more dreadful nature for in aftertimes superstition gave it preternatural  powers and made it a principal ingredient in the incantations of nocturnal hags  Toad that under the cold stone  Days and nights has thirtyone  Swelter'd venom sleeping got  Boil thou  first  i' th' charmed pot  We know by the poet that this charm was intended for a design of the first consideration that of raising the dead from their repose and bringing before the eyes of  Macbeth  a hateful secondsight of the prosperity of  Banquo  's line  This shews the mighty powers attributed to this animal by the dealers in the magic art but the powers our poet indues it with are far superior to those than  Gesner  ascribes to it  Shakespear  's witches used it to disturb the dead  Gesner  's only to still the living  Ut vim coeundi ni fallor in viris tollerent  Hist quad ovip    We may add here another superstition in respect to this animal  Toadstone  it was believed by some old writers to have a stone in its head fraught with great virtues medical and magical it was distinguished by the name of the Reptile and called the  ToadStone Bufonites Crapaudine Krottenstein  Boet de Boot de Lap et Gam    but all its fancied powers vanished on the discovery of its being nothing but the fossil tooth of the  sea wolf  or of some flattoothed fish not unfrequent in our island as well as several other countries but we may well excuse this tale since  Shakespear  has extracted from it a simile of uncommon beauty  Sweet are the uses of adversity  Which like the toad ugly and venomous  Wears yet a precious jewel in his head  But these fables have been long exploded we shall now return to the notion of its being a poisonous animal and deliver as our opinion that its excessive deformity joined to the faculty it has of emitting a juice from its pimples and a dusky liquid from its hind parts is the foundation of the report  That it has any noxious qualities we have been unable to bring proofs in the smallest degree satisfactory tho' we have heard many strange relations on that point  On the contrary we know several of our friends who have taken them in their naked hands and held them long without receiving the lest injury  Not poisonous  It is also well known that quacks have eaten them and have besides squeezed their juices into a glass and drank them with impunity  We may say also that these reptiles are a common food to many animals to  buzzards owls Norfolk plovers ducks  and  snakes  who would not touch them were they in any degree noxious  So far from having venomous qualities they have of late been considered as if they had beneficent ones We wish for the benefit of mankind that we could make a favorable report of the many attempts of late to cure the most terrible of diseases the  cancer  by the application of live toads but  alas they seem only to have rendered a horrible complaint more loathsome  In a word we may consider the toad as an animal that has neither good nor harm in it that being a defenceless creature nature has furnished it instead of arms with a most disgusting deformity that strikes into almost every Being capable of annoying it a strong repugnancy to meddle with so hideous and threatening an appearance  The time of their propagation is very early in the spring  Generation  at that season the females are seen crawling about oppressed by the males who continue on them for some hours and adhere so fast as to tear the very skin from the Parts they stick to We are uncertain whether they are viviparous  Linnoeus  Syst Nat    says they are and diverts us with a report he had heard that the male acts the midwife to the female in parturition  To conclude this account with the marvellous this animal is said to have often been found in the midst of solid rocks and even in the centre of growing trees imprisoned in a small hollow to which there was not the least adit or entrance  Plot'  s  Hist Staff    how the animal breathed or how it subsisted supposing the possibility of its confinement is past our comprehension  Plot  's  P    solution of this

that a broad black one those ended a little beyond the hind legs The belly was yellow and the scales large but even The scales on the back small on the tail the ends projected those on the latter were varied with black and brown  The legs and feet were dusky on each foot were five toes furnished with claws  This species is extremely nimble in hot weather it basks on the sides of dry banks or of old trees but on being observed immediately retreats to its hole  The food of this species as of all the other  English  lizards is insects they themselves of birds of prey Each of our lizards are perfectly harmless yet their form is what strikes one with disgust and has occasioned great obscurity in their history  Related to this species is the  Guernsey  lizard  Other species  which we are informed has been propagated in  England  from some originally brought from that island We have also heard of a green lizard frequent near  Farnbam  which probably may be of that kind but the most uncommon species we ever met with any account of is that which was killed near  Woscot  in the parish of  Swinford Worcestershire  in which was two feet six inches long and four inches in girth The fore legs were placed eight inches from the head the hind legs five inches beyond those the legs two inches long the feet divided into four toes each furnished with a sharp claw Another was killed at

found under stones and old logs some very minute young lizards that had much the appearance of this kind they were perfectly formed and had not the least vestiges of fins so that circumstance joined to their being found in a dry place remote from water makes us imagine them to have  never been inhabitants of that element as it is certain many of our lizards are in their first state  At that period they have a fin above and below their tail that on the upper part extends along the back as far as the head but both drop off as soon as the animal takes to the land being then no longer of any use  Besides these circumstances that attend them in form of a  larve  Mr  Ellis  Phil Tran vol  LVI  p    has remarked certain pennated fins at the gills of one very common in most of our stagnating

are viviparous not but that they are hatched from an internal egg being of that class of animals of whose generation  Aristotle  De Gen an lib  iii  c    says    i e  They conceive a perfect egg within but bring forth their young alive  Providence is extremely kind in making this species far from being prolific we having never heard of more than eleven eggs being found in one viper and those are as if chained together and each about the size of a blackbird's egg  The viper grows seldom to a greater length than two feet tho' once we saw a female which is nearly a third larger than the male which was almost three feet long  The groundcolor of this serpent is a dirty yellow  Descr  that of the female deeper Its back is marked the whole length with a series of rhomboid black spots touching each other at the points the sides with triangular ones the belly entirely black  There is a variety wholly black but the rhomboid marks are very conspicuous even in this being of a deeper and more glossy hue than the rest  Petiver  calls it the  Vipera Anglica Nigricans Pet Mus No    Coluber Prester  Lin syst  Bose  Faun suec No    The head of the viper is inflanted which distinguishes it from the common snake The tongue forked  Teeth  the teeth small the four canine teeth are placed two on each side the upper jaw these instruments of poison are long crooked and  moveable and can be raised and depressed at pleasure they are hollow from near the point to their base near which is a gland that secretes prepares and lodges the poison and the same action that gives the wounds forces from this gland thro' the tooth the fatal juice into it  These islands may be particularly thankful for the blessing they enjoy in being possessed of only one venomous animal and that of a kind which encreases so little  They copulate in  May  and are supposed to be about three months before they bring forth  They are said not to arrive at their full growth in less than six or seven years but that they are capable of engendering at two or three  We have been often assured by intelligent people of the truth of a fact mentioned by Sir  Thomas Brown  Vulgar errors    who was far from a credulous writer that the young of the viper when terrified will run down the throat of the parent and seek shelter in its belly in the same manner as the young of the  oppossum  retire into the ventral pouch of the old one  From this some have imagined that the viper is so unnatural as to devour its own young we disbelieve the fact  Food  it being well known the food of these serpents is frogs toads lizards mice and according to Doctor  Mead  even an animal so large as a mole These they swallow entire which if we consider the narrowness of their neck shews it is capable of a distension hardly credible had we not ocular proofs of the fact  It is also said from good authority that they will prey on young birds whether on such as nestle on the ground or whether they climb up trees for them as the  Indian  serpents do we are quite uncertain but we are well assured that this discovery is far from a recent one  Ut assidens implumibus pullis avis  Serpentium allapsus timet  Hor Epod  I  Thus for its young the anxious bird  The gliding serpent fears  The viper is capable of supporting very long abstinence it being known that some have been kept in a box six months without food yet did not abate of their vivacity They feed only a small part of the year but never during their confinement for if mice their favorite diet should at that time be thrown into their box tho' they will kill yet they never will eat them  The poison decreases in violence in proportion to the length of their confinement it must be also added the virtues of its flesh whatsoever they be are at the same time considerably lessened  These animals when at liberty remain torpid throughout the winter yet when confined have never been observed to take their annual repose  The method of catching them is by putting a clift stick on or near their head after which they are seized by the tail and put instantly into a bag  The vipercatchers are very frequently bit by them in the pursuit of their business yet we very rarely  hear of the bite being fatal The remedy if applied in time is very certain and is nothing else but sallad oil which the vipercatchers seldom go without The  axungia viperina  or the fat of vipers is also another Doctor  Mead  suspects the efficacy of this last and substitutes one of his own in its place  Essay on Poisons    but we had rather trust to vulgar receipts which perpetual trials have shewn to be infallible  The symptoms of the venom  Effects of its bite  if the wound is neglected are very terrible it first causes an acute pain in the place affected attended with a swelling first red afterwards livid which by degrees spreads to the neighbouring parts great faintness and a quick tho' low and interrupted pulse ensue great sickness at the stomach bilious convulsive vomitings cold sweats and sometimes pains about the navel and in consequence of these death itself  Lib  xxix  c    But the violence of the symptoms depends much on the season of the year the difference of the climate the size or rage of the animal or the depth or situation of the wound  Dreadful as the effects of its bite may be yet its flesh has been long celebrated as a noble medicine Doctor  Mead  cites from  Pliny Galen  Uses  and other antients several proofs of its efficacy in the cure of  ulcers  the  elephantiasis  and other bad complaints He even says he has seen good effects from it in an obstinate  lepra  it is at present used as a restorative tho' we think the modern physicians have no great dependence on its virtues The antients prescribed  it boiled and

our genera to take in the few serpents we have by a single genus their marks being too evident to be confounded  The color of the back and sides of the snake are dusky or brown  Descr  the middle of

of a bluish white  On each side the neck is a spot of pale yellow and the base of each is a triangular black spot one angle of which points towards the tail  The teeth are small and serrated lying each side the jaw in two rows  This species is perfectly inoffensive it frequents and lodges itself among bushes in moist places and will readily take the water swimming very well  It preys on frogs insects worms and mice and considering the smallness of the neck it is amazing how large an animal it will swallow  The snake is oviparous  Eggs  it lays its eggs in dunghills and in hotbeds whose

that his informant mistook the black or dusky viper for this kind for excepting the viper we never could learn that there was any sort of poisonous serpent in these kingdoms  CLASS IV FISH  Oh Deus

CETACEOUS FISH  NATURE on this tribe hath bestowed an internal structure in all respects agreeing with that of quadrupeds and in a few other the external parts in both are similar  Cetaceous Fish like land animals breathe by means of lungs being destitute of gills This obliges them to rise frequently to the surface of the water to respire to sleep on the surface as well as to perform several other functions  They have the power of uttering sounds such as bellowing and making other noises a faculty denied to genuine fish  Pontop Hist Norw  ii  Blasius Anat Animal    Like land animals they have warm blood are furnished with organs of generation copulate bring forth and suckle their young shewing a strong attachment to them  Their bodies beneath the skin are entirely surrounded with a thick layer of fat blubber analogous to the lard on hogs  The number of their fins never exceeds three  viz  two pectoral fins and one back fin but in some species the last is wanting  Their tails are placed horizontally or flat in respect to their bodies contrary to the direction of those of all other fish which have them in a perpendicular site This situation of the tail enables them to force themselves suddenly to the surface of the water  to breathe which they are so frequently constrained to do  Many of these circumstances induced  Linnoeus  to place this tribe among his  Mammalia  or what other writers style quadrupeds  To have preserved the chain of beings entire he should in this case have made the genus of  Phocoe  or  Seals  and that of the  Trichecus  or  Manati  immediately precede the whale those being the links that connect the  Mammalia  or quadrupeds with the fish for the  Seal  is in respect to its legs the most imperfect of the former class and in the  Manati  the hind feet coalesce assuming the form of a broad horizontal tail  Notwithstanding the many parts and properties which cetaceous fish have in common with land animals yet there still remain others that in a natural arrangement of the animal kingdom must determine us after the example of the illustrious  Ray  Who makes two divisions of fish    Pulmone respirantes    Branchiis respirantes  to place them in the rank of fish and for the same reasons that first of systematic writers assigns  That the form of their bodies agrees with that of fish  They are entirely naked or covered only with a

disbelieve the vast size of the  Indian  whales of whose bones and jaws both  Strabo lib  xv and  Pliny lib  ix  c  relate that the natives made their houses using the jaws for doorcases This method of building was formerly practised by the inhabitants of  Greenland  as we find from  Frobisher  in his second voyage p published in  The head is very much disproportioned to the size of the body being onethird the size of the fish the under lip is much broader than the upper The tongue is composed of a soft spongy fat capable of  yielding five or six barrels of oil The gullet is very small for so vast a fish not exceeding four inches in width In the middle of the head are two orifices thro' which it spouts water to a vast height and with a great noise especially when disturbed or wounded  The eyes are no larger than those of an ox  On the back there is no fin but on the sides beneath each eye are two large ones  The penis is eight feet in length inclosed in a strong sheath The teats in the female are placed in the lower part of the belly  The tail is broad and semilunar  This whale varies in color the back of some being red the belly generally white Others are black some mottled others quite white according to the observations of  Marten  who says that their colors in the water are extremely beautiful and that their skin is very smooth and slippery  What is called  whalebone  adheres to the upper jaw  Whalebone  and is formed of thin parallel laminae some of the longest four yards in length of these there are commonly on each side but in very old fish more of these about are of a length fit for use the others being too short They are surrounded with long strong hair not only that they may not hurt the tongue but as strainers to prevent the return of their food when they discharge the water out of their mouths  It is from these hairs that  Aristotle  gave the name of  or the  bearded whale  to this species which he tells us had in its mouth hairs instead of  teeth  Hist an lib  iii  c    and  Pliny  describes the same under the name of  Musculus  Lib  xi  c    Tho' the antients were acquainted with this animal yet as far as we recollect they were ignorant of their uses as well as capture  Aldrovand  De Cetis    indeed describes from  Oppian  what he mistakes for whale fishing he was deceived by the word  which is used not only to express whale in general but any great fish The  poet  here meant the  shark  and shews the way of taking it in the very manner practised at present by a strong hook baited with flesh He describes too its threefold row of teeth a circumstance that at once disproves its being a whale  Halieut  v  lin    Whose dreadful teeth in triple order stand  Like spears out of his mouth  The whale tho' so bulky an animal swims with vast swiftness and generally against the wind  It brings only two young at a time as we believe is the case with all other whales  Its food is a certain sort of small snail  Food  and as  Linnoeus  says the  medusa  or sea blubber  The great resort of this species is within the  arctic  circle but they sometimes visit our coasts Whether this was the  British  whale of the antients we cannot pretend to say only we find from a line in  Juvenal  that it was of a very large size  Quanto Delphinis Baloena  Britannica  major  Sat x  As much as  British  whales in size surpass  The dolphin race  To view these animals in a commercial light we must add that the  English  were late before they engaged in the whalefishery it appears by a set of queries proposed by an honest merchant in the year in order to get information in the business that we were at that time totally ignorant of it being obliged to send to  Biskaie for men skilful in the catching of the whale and ordering of the oil and one cooper skilful to set up the staved cask  Hackluyt'  s  Col voy  I  This seems very strange for by the account  Octher  gave of his travels to King  Alfred  near years  Idem  I  before that period it is evident that he made that monarch acquainted with the  Norwegians  practising the whalefishery but it seems all memory of that gainful employ as well as of that able voyager  Octher  and all his important discoveries in the North were lost for near seven centuries  It was carried on by the  Biscayeners  long before we attempted the trade and that for the sake not only of the oil but also of the whalebone which they seem to have long trafficked in The earliest notice we find of that article in our trade is by  Hackluyt  Hackluyt  III  who says it was brought from the  Bay of St Laurence  by an  English  ship that went there for the  barbes  and  fynnes  of whales and train oil A D and who found there seven or eight hundred  whale  fynnes  part of the cargo of two great  Biskaine  ships that had been wrecked there three years before Previous to that the ladies stays must have been made of split cane or some tough wood as Mr  Anderson  observes in his Dictionary of Commerce  Vol  I  it being certain that the whale fishery was carried on for the sake of the oil long before the discovery of the use of whalebone  The great resort of these animals was found to be on the inhospitable shores of  Spitzbergen  and the  European  ships made that place their principal fishery and for numbers of years were very successful the  English  commenced that business about the year and the town of  Hull  had the honor of first attempting that profitable branch of trade At present it seems to be on the decline the quantity of fish being greatly reduced by the constant capture for such a vast length of time some recent accounts inform us that the fishers from a defect of whales apply themselves to the seal fishery from which animals they extract an oil This we fear will not be of any long continuance for these shy and timid creatures will soon be induced to quit those shores by being perpetually harrassed as the  morse  or  walrus  has already in a great measure done We are also told that the poor natives of  Greenland  begin even now to suffer from the decrease of the seal in their seas it being their principal subsistence so that should it totally desert the coast the whole nation would be in danger of perishing thro' want  In old times the whale seems never to have been taken on our coasts  Royal Fish  but when it was accidentally

belief of the tales related of this fish's attachment to mankind  Pliny  Epist lib  ix  ep    the younger apologizing for what he is going to say tells the story of the enamoured dolphin of  Hippo  in

past belief a dolphin's arched back  Preserved  Arion  from his destined wrack  Secure he sits and with harmonious strains  Requites his bearer for his friendly pains  We are at a loss to account for the origin of those fables since it does not appear that the dolphin shews a greater attachment to mankind than the rest of the cetaceous tribe We know that at present the appearance of this fish and the porpesse are far from being esteemed favorable omens by the seamen for their boundings springs and frolics in the water are held to be sure signs of an approaching gale  It is from their leaps out

such as mackrel herrings and salmon which they pursue up the bays with the same eagerness as a pack of dogs does a hare In some places they almost darken the sea as they rise above water to take breath but propesses not only seek for prey near the surface but often descend to the bottom in search of sand eels and sea worms which they root out of the sand with their noses in the same manner as hogs do in the fields for their food  Their bodies are very thick towards the head  Descr  but grows slender towards the tail forming the figure of a cone  The nose projects a little is much shorter than that of the dolphin and is furnished with very strong muscles which enables it the readier to turn up the sand  In each jaw are fortyeight teeth  Teeth  small sharp pointed and a little moveable

of cetaceous fish which he calls  thornbacks  from their broad and sharp fin on the back some of these were brown some quite white others spotted but whether they were only a variety of this fish or whether they were small  grampuses  which are also spotted we cannot determine  The porpesse is remarkable for the vast quantity of the fat or lard that surrounds the body  Fat  which yields a great quantity of excellent oil from this lard or from their rooting like swine they are called in many places  sea hogs  the  Germans  call them  meerschwein  the  Swedes marsuin  and the  English porpesse

but are found in much greater numbers off the  North Cape  in  Norway  whence they are called  North Capers  These and all other whales are observed to swim against the wind and to be much disturbed and tumble about with unusual violence at the approach of a storm  Linnoeus  and  Artedi  say that this species is furnished with broad serrated teeth which as far as we have observed is peculiar to the  shark  tribe We therefore suspect that those naturalists have had recourse to  Rondeletius  and copied his erroneous account of the teeth Sir  Robert Sibbald  who had opportunity of examining and figuring the teeth of this fish and from whom we take that part of our description giving a very different account of them  It will be but justice to say that no one of our countrymen ever did so much towards forming a general natural history of this kingdom as Sir  Robert Sibbald  he sketched out a fine outline of the Zoology of  Scotland  which comprehends the greatest part of the  English  animals and we are told had actually filled up a considerable part of it he published a particular history of the county of  Fife  and has left us a most excellent history of the whales which frequent the coast of  Scotland  We acknowledge ourselves much indebted to him for information in respect to many of those  fish few of which frequent the southern seas of those kingdoms and those that are accidentally cast ashore on our coasts are generally cut up by the country people before an opportunity can be had of examining them  Div II CARTILAGINOUS FISH  THIS title is given to all fish whose muscles are supported by cartilages instead of bones and comprehends the same genera of fish to which  Linnaeus  has given the name of  amphibia nantes  but the word  amphibia  ought properly to be confined to such animals who inhabit both elements and can live without any inconvenience for a considerable space either on land or under water This definition therefore excludes all that form this division  Many of the cartilaginous fish are viviparous being excluded from an egg which is hatched within them The egg consists of a white and a yolk and is lodged in a case formed of a thick tough substance not unlike softened horn such are the eggs of the Ray and Shark kinds  Some again differ in this respect and are oviparous such is the Sturgeon and others  They breathe either thro' certain apertures beneath as in the Rays on their sides as in the Sharks c or on the top of the head as in the Pipefish for they have not covers to their gills like the bony fish  Genus IV  Slender Eelshaped

found in the most considerable of the  Scotch  and  Irish  rivers  They are sea fish but like salmon quit the salt waters and ascend the latter end of the winter or beginning of spring and after a stay of a few months return again to the ocean a very few excepted The best season for them is the months of  March April  and  May  for they are more firm when just arrived out of the salt water than they are afterwards being observed to be much wasted and very flabby at the approach of hot weather  They are taken in the nets along with salmon and shad and sometimes in weels laid in the bottom of the river  It has been an old custom for the city of  Gloucester  annually to present his majesty with a  lamprey  pye covered with a large raised crust As the gift is made at  Christmas  it is with great difficulty the corporation can procure any fresh lampreys at that time tho' they give guinea apiece for them so early in the season  They are reckoned a great delicacy either when potted or stewed but are a surfeiting food as one of our monarchs fatally experienced  Henry  the First's death being occasioned by a too plentiful meal of these fish  Lampreys are sometimes found so large as to weigh four or five pounds  The mouth is round and placed rather obliquely below the end of the nose the edges are jagged which enables them to adhere the more strongly to the stones as their custom is and which they do so firmly as not to be drawn off without some difficulty  We have heard of one weighing three pounds which was taken out of the  Esk  adhering to a stone of twelve pounds weight suspended at its mouth from which it was forced with no small pains  There are in the mouth twenty rows of small teeth disposed in circular orders and placed far within  The color is dusky irregularly marked with dirty yellow which gives the fish a disagreeable look  We believe that the antients were unacquainted with this fish  Not the Muraena  so far is certain that which Doctor  Arbuthnot  and other learned men render the word  lamprey  is a species unknown in our seas being the  muraena  of  Ovid Pliny  and others for which we want an  English  name  The words  Lampetra  and  Petromyzon

spines  Skates generate in  March  and  April  Generation  at which time they swim near the surface of the water several of the males pursuing one female They adhere so fast together in coition that the fishermen frequently draw up both together tho' only one has taken the bait The females begin to cast their  purses  as the fishermen call them the bags in which the young are included in  May

expires They impute no noxious qualities to it as a food being commonly eat by the  French  who find them more frequently on their coasts than we do on ours  This wonderful faculty is occasioned by a most rapid frequent and violent contraction and exertion of its muscles against any object that touches it The cause is prettily explained by M  Reaumur  Hist de l'Academie des Sciences    to whom we refer the inquisitive reader for a farther account  We may mention a double use in this strange power the  torpedo  is endued with the one when it is exerted as a means of defence against voracious

in size has no orifice near the eyes and has a small anal fin  and what is worse mistaken for and confounded with the  luna  of  Rondeletius  the same that our  English  writers call the  sunfish  The  Irish  and  Welch  give it the same name from its lying as if to sun itself on the surface of the water and for the same reason we have taken the liberty of calling it the basking shark It was long taken for a species of whale till we pointed out the branchial orifices on the sides and the perpendicular site of the tail  These are migratory fish or at lest it is but in a certain number of years that they are seen in multitudes on the  Welch  seas tho' in most summers a single and perhaps strayed fish appears  They visited the bays of  Caernarvonshire  and  Anglesea  in vast shoals in the summers of  Some old people say they recollect the same sort of fish visiting these seas in vast numbers about forty years ago  and a few succeeding years continuing there only the hot months for they quitted the coast about  Michaelmas  as if cold weather was disagreeable to them  They had nothing of the fierce and voracious nature of the shark kind and were so tame as to suffer themselves to be stroked they generally lay motionless on the surface commonly on their bellies but sometimes like tired swimmers on their backs  Their food seemed to consist entirely of sea plants  Food  no remains of fish being ever discovered in the stomachs of numbers that were cut up except some green stuff the half digested parts of algae and the like  At certain times they were seen sporting on the waves and leaping with vast agility several feet out of the water  Their length was from three to eleven yards but the last was a rare size  Their form was rather slender like others of the shark kind  The upper jaw was much longer than the lower  Teeth  and blunt at the end The mouth placed beneath and each jaw furnished with numbers of small teeth those before were much bent those more remote in the jaws were conic and sharp pointed  On the sides of the neck were five large transverse apertures to the gills  On the back were two fins the first very large not directly in the middle of the back but rather nearer the head the other small and situated near the tail On the lower part were four others viz two pectoral fins and two ventral fins the last placed just beneath the hind fin of the back Near these the male had two genitals and between these fins was situated the pudendum of the female  The tail was very large and the upper part remarkably longer than the lower  The color of the upper part of the body was a deep leaden the belly white  The skin was rough like shagreen but less so on the belly than the back  Within side the mouth towards the throat was a very short sort of whalebone  The liver was of a great size  Liver  but that of the female was the largest some weighed above a thousand pounds  Oil  and yielded a great quantity of pure and sweet oil fit for lamps and also much used by the people who took them to cure bruises burns and rheumatic complaints A large fish has afforded to the captors a profit of twenty pounds They were viviparous a young one about a foot in length being found in the belly of a fish of this kind  They were taken with harpoons with long lines fixed to them in much the same manner as whales are and when struck go off with vast rapidity and dart instantly to the bottom taking with them forty or fifty fathom of line and are a long time before they are quite subdued  The fishers observed on them a sort of leech of a reddish color and about two feet long but which fell off when the fish was brought to the surface of the water and left a white mark on the skin  The same persons assert that there were two species of this fish a lesser sort about two yards in length which had in the mouth only three rows of teeth and those larger than in the kind we have described being an inch and an half long  This account we digested from materials furnished by the Rev Mr  Farrington  and the Rev Mr  Williams  Rector of  Lanvair yn Hornwy  in  Anglesea  for it has not been our fortune to see more of this fish than fragments of the skin jaws and what is styled whalebone they have now in a manner quitted the coasts scarce one in a summer appearing in those seas  ** With the anal fin  IV The WHITE SHARK    Arist Hist an lib  v  c  ix  c

sea and tho' it was drawn up again as fast as the united force of the crew could be exerted yet in that short space the sharks had devoured every part but the feet which were secured at the end of the cord  Swimmers very often perish by them sometimes they lose an arm or leg and sometimes are bit quite assunder serving but for two morsels for this ravenous animal a melancholy tale of this kind is related in a  West India  ballad preserved in Mr  Percy  's reliques of ancient  English  poetry  Vol  I  The mouth of this fish is furnished with sometimes a sixfold row of teeth  Teeth  flat

length are not half an inch so that the fish to which mine belonged must have been six yards long provided the teeth and body keep pace in their growth  Fossil teeth of this fish are very frequent in  Malta  some of which are four inches long  This dreadful apparatus when the fish is in a state of repose lie quite flat in the mouth but when he seizes his prey he has power of erecting them by the help of a set of muscles that join them to the jaw  The mouth is placed far beneath for which reason these as well as the rest of the kind are said to  be obliged to turn on their backs to seize their prey which is an observation as antient as the days of  Pliny  Omnia qutem carnivora sunt talia et supina vescantur lib  ix  c    The eyes are large the back broad flat and shorter than that of other

fondness for human flesh that these fish are less destructive in our seas is owing to the coolness of the climate which is well known to abate the fierceness of some as well as the venom of other

beneath its eyes enticing by that means the  little fish to play round till they come within reach when it springs on them  Cicero  in his second of  De Natura Deorum  gives much the same account of this fish  Ranae autem marinae dicuntur obruere sese arena solere et moveri propè aquam ad quas quasi ad escam pisces cum accesserint confici a ranis atque consumi    The fishing frog grows to a large size  Descr  some being between four and five feet in length and we have heard of one taken near  Scarborough  whose mouth was a yard wide The fishermen on that coast have a great regard for this fish

lines always set it at liberty  It is a fish of very great deformity the head is much bigger than the whole body is round at the circumference and flat above the mouth of a prodigious wideness  The under jaw is much longer than the upper the jaws are full of slender sharp teeth in the roof of the mouth are two or three rows of the same at the root of the tongue opposite each other are two bones of an elliptical form thick set with very strong sharp teeth  The nostrils do not appear externally but in the upper part of the mouth are two large orifices that serve instead of them  On each side the upper jaw are two sharp spines and others are scattered about the upper part of the head  Immediately above the nose are two long tough filaments and on the back three others these are  FISHING

ventral fins are broad thick and fleshy are jointed like arms and within side divided into fingers  The aperture to the gills is placed behind each of these is very wide so that some writers have imagined it to be a receptacle for the young in time of danger  The back fin is placed very low near the beginning of the tail the anal fin is placed beneath almost opposite the former  The body grows

conceals itself in the hot months this shews it to be a fish of a cold nature which is confirmed by the history of  the  European  fish of this species given by Mr  Forster  Phil Trans  lvii  in his Essay on the  Volga  who relates that they are scarce ever found in that river in spring or summer but in vast quantities in autumn and winter when they crowd from the sea under the ice and are then taken in great numbers  Whether the  acipenser  is the sturgeon of the moderns may be doubted otherwise  Ovid  would never have spoke of it as a foreign fish  Tuque peregrinis Acipenser nobilis undis  And thou a fish in foreign seas renowned  It being well known that it is not uncommon in the  Mediterranean  and even in the mouth of the  Tiber  at certain seasons but this passage leaves us as much in the dark as to the particular species intended by the word  acipenser  as the description  Pliny  has given us for that philosopher relates that its scales are placed in a contrary direction to those of other fish being turned towards the mouth which disagrees with the character of all that are known at present Whatever fish it might be it was certainly the same with the  Elops  or  Helops

rivers  Migratory  but in no great numbers and is taken by accident in the  salmon nets It seems a spiritless fish making no manner of resistance when entangled but is drawn out of the water like a lifeless lump It is a fish that is seldom taken far out at sea but frequents such parts as are not remote from the aestuaries of great rivers It is admired for the delicacy and firmness of its flesh which is white as veal and extremely good when roasted It is generally pickled The most we receive comes either from the  Baltic  rivers or  North America  those cured at  Pillau  have been till of late in the greatest repute but thro' the encouragement given by the society instituted for promoting trade and manufactures the sturgeon from our colonies begins to rival those of the  Baltic  Great numbers are taken during summer in the lakes  Frischehaff  and  Curischhaff  near  Pillau  in large nets made of small cord The adjacent shores are formed into districts and farmed out to companies of fishermen some of which are rented for six thousand guilders or near three hundred pounds  per annum  They are found in vast abundance in the  American  rivers in  May June  and  July  at which time they leap some yards out of the water and falling on their sides make a noise to be heard in still weather at some miles distance  Catesby Carol App    Caviare  is made of the roes of this  Caviare

of  Icthyocolla  and says that the glue that was produced from it had the same title and afterwards adds that it was made out of the belly of the fish The  Mario  said by  Pliny lib  ix  c  to be found in the  Danube  and the  Borysthenes  was certainly of this genus a cartilaginous fish  nullis ossibus spinisve intersitis  resembling a small porpesse  Porculo marino simillimus  and very probably may be the same with the  Beluga  which according to Mr  Forster Phil Trans  lvii has a short blunt nose agreeing in that respect with the porpesse  The sturgeon grows to a great size  Descr  to the length of eighteen feet and to the weight of five hundred pounds but it is seldom taken in our rivers of that bulk The largest we have known caught in those of  Great Britain  weighed four hundred and sixty pounds which was taken about two years ago in the  Esk  where they are more frequently found than in our southern waters  The nose is very long slender and ends in a point The eyes are extremely small the nostrils placed near them on the lower part of the nose are four cirri or beards the mouth is situated far beneath is small and unsupported by any jaw bones neither has it any

the lower  The upper part of the body is of a dirty olive color the lower part silvery the middle of the tubercles white  In the manner of breeding it is an exception among the cartilaginous fish

natural history and in some respects borders on the nature of the reptile tribe  It is known to quit its element and during night to wander along the meadows not only for  change of habitation but also that the sake of prey feeding on the snails it finds in its passage  During winter it beds itself deep in the mud and continues in a state of rest like the serpent kind It is very impatient of cold and will eagerly take shelter in a whisp of straw flung into a pond in severe weather which has sometimes been practised as a method of taking them  Albertus  Gesner pisc    goes so far as to say that he has known eels to take shelter in a hayrick yet all perished thro' excess of cold  It has been observed that in the river  Nyne  Morton  's  Hist Northampt    Pliny  observes that the eels of the lake  Benacus  collect together in the same manner in the month of  October  possibly to retreat from the winter's cold  lib  ix  c    there is a variety of small eel with a lesser head and narrower mouth than the mommon kind that is found in clusters in the bottom of the river and is called the  Bedeel  these are sometimes rouzed up by violent floods and are never found at that time with meat in their stomachs This bears such an analogy with the clustering of blindworms in their quiescent state that we cannot but consider it as a further proof of a partial agreement in the nature of the two genera  The antients adopted a most wild opinion about the generation of these fish  Generation  believing them to be either created from the mud or that the scrapings of their bodies which they left on the stones were animated and became young eels Some moderns gave into these opinions and into others that were equally extravagant They could not account for  the appearance of these fish in ponds that never were stocked with them and that were even so remote as to make their being met with in such places a phaenomenon that they could not solve But there is much reason to believe that many waters are supplied with these fish by the aquatic fowl of prey in the same manner as vegetation is spread by many of the land birds either by being dropped as they carry them to feed their young or by passing quick thro' their bodies as is the case with herons and such may be occasion of the appearance of these fish in places where they were never seen before As to their immediate generation  Viviparous  it has been sufficiently proved to be effected in the ordinary course of nature and that they are viviparous  They are extremely voracious and very destructive to the fry of fish  No fish lives so long out of water as the eel it is extremely tenacious of life as its parts will move a considerable time after they are flayed and cut into pieces  The eel is placed by  Linnaeus  in the genus of  Muraena  Descr  his first of the apodal fish or such which want the ventral fins  The eyes are placed not remote from the end of the nose the irides are tinged with red the under jaw is longer than the upper the teeth are small sharp and numerous beneath each eye is a minute orifice at the end of the nose two others small and tubular  This fish is furnished with a pair of pectoral fins rounded at their ends Another narrow fin on the back uniting with that of the tail and the anal fin joins it in the same manner beneath  Behind the pectoral fins is the orifice to the gills which are concealed in the skin  Eels vary much in their colors  Silver Eels  from a sooty hue to a light olive green and those which are called silver eels have their bellies white and a remarkable clearness throughout  Besides these there is another variety of this fish known in the  Thames  by the name of  Grigs  Grigs  and about  Oxford  by that of  Grigs  or  Gluts  These are scarce ever seen near  Oxford  in the winter but appear in spring and bite readily at the hook which common eels in that neighborhood will not They have a larger head a blunter nose thicker skin and Jess fat than the common sort neither are they so much esteemed nor do they often exceed three or four pounds in weight  Common eels grow to a large size sometimes so great as to weigh fifteen or twenty pounds but that is extremely rare As to instances brought by  Dale  and others of these fish encreasing to a superior magnitude we have much reason to suspect them to have been congers since the enormous fish they describe have all been taken at the mouths of the  Thames  or  Medway  The eel is the most universal of fish yet is scarce ever found in the  Danube  tho' it is very common in the lakes and rivers of  Upper Austria  The  Romans  held this fish very cheap probably from its likeness to a snake  Vos anguilla manet longae cognata colubrae  Juvenal Sat  v  Vernula riparum pinguis torrente

We have heard of some taken near  Scarborough  that were ten feet and a half long and eighteen inches in circumference in the thickest part  They differ from the common eel in the following particulars  Descr  Their color in general is more dark  Their eyes much larger in proportion  The irides of a bright silvery color  The lower jaw is rather shorter than the upper  The side line is broad whitish and marked with a row of small spots Mr  Ray  says a double row but we did not observe it in the fish we examined  The edges of the dorsal and anal fins are black  They have more bones than the common eel especially along the back quite to the head  They grow to a much larger size  As to the distinction that Mr  Ray  and other writers make of the small beards at the end of the nose we think it not to be depended on being sometimes found in both kinds and sometimes entirely wanting  We believe they generate like the freshwater species innumerable quantities of what are supposed to be their fry come up the  Severn  about the month of  April  preceding the  Shads  which it is conjectured migrate into that river to feed on them  Elvers  they are called  Elvers  They quite swarm during their season and are taken in a kind of sieve made of haircloth fixed to a long pole the fisherman standing on the edge of the water during the tide puts in his net as far as he can reach and drawing it out again takes multitudes at every sweep and will take as many during one tide as will fill a bushel They are dressed and reckoned very delicate  Congers are extremely voracious preying on other fish and on crabs at the time they have lost their shell and are in a soft state They and eels in general are also particularly fond of carcasses of any  kind being frequently found lodged in such that are accidentally taken up  These fish are an article of commerce in  Cornwall  numbers are taken on that coast and exported to  Spain  and  Portugal  particularly to  Barcelona  The

way is tedious and does not answer the expence of time and labor they are chiefly caught by  Bulters  which are strong lines five hundred feet long with sixty hooks each eight feet asunder baited with pilchards or mackrel the  Bulters  are sunk to the ground by a stone fastened to them sometimes such a number of these are tied together as to reach a mile  We have been told that the fishermen are very fearful of a large conger least it should endanger their legs by clinging round them they therefore kill them as soon as possible by striking them on the navel  They are afterwards cured in this manner  Cur    they are slit and hung on a frame till they dry having a considerable quantity of fat which it is necessary  should exude before they are fit for use It is remarkable that a conger of a hundred weight will waste by drying to twentyfour pounds the people therefore prefer the smallest possibly because they are soonest cured During the process there is a considerable stench and it is said that in the fishing villages the poultry are fed with the maggots that drop from the fish  The  Portuguese  and  Spaniards  use those dried congers after they have been ground into a powder to thicken and give a relish to their soups We think they are sold for about forty shillings the quintal which weighs one hundred and twentysix pounds  VII SEA WOLF  Genus XIII  Blunt head long body One

German  ocean which washes the shores of  Holland  the most southern of its haunts we can with any certainty mention  It is a most ravenous and fierce fish and when taken fastens on any thing within its reach the fishermen dreading its bite endeavor as soon as possible  to beat out its fore teeth and then kill it by striking it behind the head  Schonevelde  relates that its bite is so hard that it will seize on an anchor and leave the marks of its teeth in it and the  Danish  and  German  names of  Steenbider  and  Steinbeisser  express the sense of its great strength as if it was capable of crushing even stones with its jaws  It feeds almost entirely on crustaceous animals  Food  and shell fish such as crabs lobsters prawns muscles scollops large whelks c these it grinds to pieces with its teeth and swallows with the lesser shells It does not appear they are dissolved in the stomach but are voided with the foeces for which purpose the aperture of the anus is wider than in other fish

seventeen inches at the shoulders twenty but near the tail only four and a half  Its weight was twenty pounds and a quarter  The head is a little slatted on the top the nose blunt the nostrils very small the eyes small and placed near the end of the nose  The teeth are very remarkable  Teeth  and finely adapted to its way of life The fore teeth are strong conical diverging a little from each other stand far out of the jaws and are commonly six above and the same below tho' sometimes there are only five in each jaw these are supported withinside by a row of lesser teeth which makes the number in the upper jaw seventeen or eighteen in the lower eleven or twelve  The sides of the under jaw are convex inwards which greatly adds to their strength and at the same time allows room for the large muscles with which the head of this fish is furnished  The  dentes molares  or grinding teeth of the under jaw are higher on the outer than the inner edges which inclines their surfaces inward they join to the canine teeth in that jaw but in the upper are separate from them  In the centre are two rows of flat strong teeth fixed on an oblong basis upon the bones of the palate and nose  These and the other grinding teeth are often found fossil and in that state called  Bufonites  or  Toadstones  they were formerly much esteemed for their  imaginary virtues and were set in gold and worn as rings  The two bones that form the under jaw are united before by a loose cartilage which mechanism admitting of a motion from side to side most evidently contributes to the design of the whole  viz  a facility of breaking grinding and comminuting its testaceous and crustaceous food  The body is long and a little compressed sideways the skin smooth and slippery it wants the lateral line  The pectoral fins consist of eighteen rays are five inches long and seven and a quarter broad  The dorsal fin extends from the hind part of the head almost to the tail the rays in the fresh fish are not

qualities of this fish were well known to the antients who take notice of them without any exaggeration the wounds inflicted by its spines are exceedingly painful attended with a violent burning and most pungent shooting and sometimes with an inflammation that will extend from the arm to the shoulder  It is probable that the malignity of the symptoms arises from the habit of body the person is in or the part in which the wound is given  It is a common notion that these symptoms proceed from something more than the small wound this fish is capable of inflicting and that there is a venom infused into it at lest into such as is made by  the spines that form the first dorsal fin which is dyed with black and has a most suspicious aspect The remedy used by a fisherman in our neighbourhood is the sea sand with which he rubs the place affected for a considerable time  In the  Universal Museum  for  November  is an instance of a person who was reduced to great danger by a wound from this fish and who was cured by the application of sweet oil and taking  opium  and  venice treacle  This fish buries itself in the sands leaving only its nose out and if trod on immediately strikes with great force and we have seen them direct their blows with as much judgment as fighting cocks Notwithstanding this noxious property of the spines it is exceeding good meat  The  English  name seems to have

shores  p    It affects cold climates and seems confined  between the latitudes and what are caught north and south of those degrees being either few in quantity or bad in quality The  Greenland  fish are small and emaciated thro' want of food being very voracious and having in those seas a dearth of provision  This locality of situation is common to many other species of this genus most of them being inhabitants of the cold seas or such that lie within zones that can just clame the title of temperate There are nevertheless certain species found near the  Ganary Islands  called  Cherny  Hist Canary Islands    of which we know no more than the name but according to the unfortunate Captain  Glas  are better tasted than the  Newfoundland  kind  The great rendezvouz of the cod fish is on the Banks of  Newfoundland  and the other sand banks that lie off the coasts of  Cape Breton Nova Scotia  and  New England  They prefer those situations by reason of the quantity of worms produced in those sandy bottoms which tempt them to resort there for food but another cause of the particular attachment the fish have to these spots is their vicinity to the polar seas where they return to spawn there they depose their roes in full security but want of food forces them as soon as the first more southern seas are open to repair thither for subsistence  Few are taken north of  Iceland  but on the south and west coasts they abound they are again found to swarm on the coasts of  Norway  in the  Baltic  off the  Orkney  and the  Western Isles  after which their  numbers decrease in proportion as they advance towards the south when they seem quite to cease before they reach the mouth of the Straits of  Gibraltar  Before the discovery of  Newfoundland  the greater fisheries of cod were in the seas of  Iceland  and of our  Western Isles  which were the grand resort of ships of all the commercial nations but it seems that the greatest plenty was met with near  Iceland  for we find Queen  Elizabeth  condescending to ask permission to fish in those seas from  Christian  the IVth of  Denmark  yet afterwards she so far repented her request as to instruct her embassadors to that court to insist on the right of a free and universal fishery  Rymer  's  Foed  xvi  But the  Spanish  the  French  and the  Britons  had much the advantage of us in all fisheries at the beginning as appears by the state of that in the seas of  Newfoundland  in the year  Hackluyt  's  Coll Voy  iii  when the number of ships belonging to each nation stood thus  Spaniards  besides or that came from  Biscaie  to take whale for train being about five or six thousand tons  Portuguese  or three thousand tons  French  and  Britons  or seven thousand tons  English  from to  But Mr  Anderson  in his Dictionary of Commerce I says that the  French  began to fish there so  early as and we think we have somewhere read that their first pretence for fishing for cod in those seas was only to supply an  English  convent with that article  The encrease of shipping that resort to those fertile banks are now unspeakable our own country still enjoys the greatest share which ought to be esteemed our chiefest treasure as it brings wealth to individuals and strength to the state  All this immense fishery is carried on by the hook and line only  We have been informed that they fish in the depth of from fifteen to sixty fathoms according to the inequality of the  Bank  which is represented as a vast mountain under water above five hundred miles long and near three hundred broad and that seamen knew when they approach it by the great swell of the sea and the thick mists that impend over it  the bait is herring a small fish called a  Capelin  a shell fish called  Clams  and bits of sea fowl and with these are caught fish sufficient to find employ for near fifteen thousand  British  seamen and to afford subsistence to a much more numerous body of people at home who are engaged in the various manufactures which so vast a fishery demands  The food of the cod is either small fish  Food  worms testaceous or crustaceous animals such as crabs large whelks c and their digestion is so powerful as to dissolve the greatest part of the shells they swallow They are very voracious and catch at any small body they perceive moved by the water even stones and pebbles which are often found in their stomachs  Providence hath kindly ordained that this fish  Vastly prolific  so useful to mankind should be so very prolific as to  supply more than the deficiencies of the multitudes annually taken  Leuwenhoek  counted nine millions three hundred and eightyfour thousand eggs in a cod fish of a middling size a number sure that will baffle all the efforts of man or the voracity of the inhabitants of the ocean to exterminate and which will secure to all ages an inexhaustible supply of grateful provision  In our seas they begin to spawn in  January  and deposite their eggs in rough ground among rocks Some continue in roe till the beginning of  April  The cod fish in general recover quicker after spawning than any other fish therefore it is common to take some good ones all the summer When they are out of season they are thin tailed and lousy and the lice chiefly fix themselves on the inside of their mouths  The fish of a middling size are most esteemed for the table and are chosen by their plumpness and roundness especially near the tail by the depth of the sulcus or pit behind the head and by the regular undulated appearance of the sides as if they were ribbed The glutinous parts about the head lose their delicate flavor after it has been twentyfour hours out of the water even in winter in which these and other fish of this genus are in highest season  The largest that we ever heard of taken on our coasts weighed sixtynine pounds  Size  but the general weight on the  Yorkshire  seas is from fourteen to forty  This species is short in proportion to its bulk  Descr  the belly

first consisting of twenty the last of sixteen rays  The tail is almost even at the end the first ray on each side is short and composed of a strong bone  The color of this fish is cinereous on the back and sides and commonly spotted with yellow the belly is white but they vary much not only in color  Codlings are often taken of a yellow orange and even red color while they remain among the rocks but on changing their place assume the color of other cod fish  but in shape particularly that of the head  The side line is white and broad  Side line  strait till it reaches opposite the vent

Asellus  Lib c    Callarias  and  Bacchus  are familiarly applied  to several of our species of cod fish by the more modern writers yet the antients from whom they are borrowed have not authorized the application to any particular kind either by description or any other method  Different reasons have been assigned for giving the name of  or  Asinus  to this genus some imagining it to be from the color of the fish others because it used to be carried on the backs of asses to market but we shall drop this uncertain subject and proceed to what we have fuller assurance of  Large hadocks begin to be in roe the middle of  November  Season  and continue so till the end of  January  from that time till  May  they are very thin tailed and much out of season In  May  they begin to recover and some of the middlingsized fish are then very good and continue improving till the time of their greatest perfection The small ones are extremely good from  May  till  February  and some even in  February March  and  April  viz those which are not old enough to breed  The fishermen assert that in rough weather hadocks sink down into the sand and ooze in the bottom of the sea and shelter themselves there till the storm is over because in stormy weather they take none and those that are taken immediately after a storm are covered with mud on their backs  In summer they live on young herrings and other small fish  Food  in winter on the stonecoated worms  A species of  Serpula  which the fishermen call  hadock meat  The grand shoal of hadocks comes periodically on the  Yorkshire  coasts  Vast shoals  It is remarkable that they appeared in on the th of  December  and exactly on the same day in these shoals extended from the shore near three miles in breadth and in length from  Flamborough  head to  Tinmouth  castle and perhaps much farther northwards An idea may be given of their numbers by the following fact three fishermen within the distance of a mile from  Scarborough  harbour frequently loaded their  coble  or boat with them twice aday taking each time about a ton of fish when they put down their lines beyond the distance of three miles from the shore they caught nothing but dog fish which shows how exactly these fish keep their limits  The best hadocks were sold from eightpence to a shilling per score and the poor had the smaller sort at a penny and sometimes a halfpenny per score  Here Mr  Travis  to whom I am much obliged for a most accurate account of the  Yorkshire  fish with great humanity projects an inland navigation to convey at a cheap and easy method those gifts of Providence to the thousands of poor manufacturers who inhabit the distant parts of that vast county  The large hadocks quit the coast as soon as they go out of season and leave behind great plenty of small ones It is said that the large ones visit the coasts of  Hamburgh  and  Jutland  in the summer  It is no less remarkable than providential that all kinds of fish except mackrel which frequent the  Yorkshire  coast approach the shore and as if it were offer themselves to us generally remaining there as long as they are in high season and retire from us when they become unfit for use  It is the commonest species in the  London  markets  They do not grow to a great bulk  Descr  one of fourteen pounds being of an uncommon size but those are extremely coarse the best for the table weighing from two to three pounds  The body is long and rather more slender than those of the preceding kinds the head slopes down to the nose the space between the hind part of the

this mark to the impression St  Peter  left with his finger and thumb when he took the tribute out of the mouth of a fish of this species which has been continued to the whole race of hadocks ever

other in  September  at the beginning of the  Herring  season probably in pursuit of those fish it was no unusual thing for six men with hooks and lines to take a thousand  Hake  in one night besides a considerable quantity of other fish These were salted and sent to  Spain  particularly to  Bilboa  Smith's Hist Waterford    We are  at this time uninformed of the state of this fishery but find that Mr  Smith  who wrote the History of the County of  Waterford  complain even in his time of its decline Many of the gregarious fish are subject to change their situations and desert their haunts for numbers of years and then return again We see p how unsettled the  Basking Shark  appears to be Mr  Smith  instances the loss of the  Hadock  on the  Waterford  shores where they used to swarm and to our own knowledge we can bring the capriciousness of the herrings which so frequently quit their stations as another example  Sometimes the irregular migration of fish is owing to their being followed and harassed by an unusual number of fish of prey such as the shark kind  Sometimes to deficiency of the smaller fish which served them as food  And lastly in many places to the custom of trawling which not only demolishes a quantity of their spawn which is deposited in the sand but also destroys or drives into deeper waters numberless worms and insects the repast of many fish  The hake is in  England  esteemed a very coarse fish and is seldom admitted to table either fresh or salted  When cured it is known by the name of  Poor John  These fish are from a foot and an half to

length being corrupted from the word  long  It abounds about the  Scilly Isles  on the coasts of  Scarborough  and those of  Scotland  and  Ireland  and forms a considerable article of commerce  This branch of trade was considerable so long ago as the reign of  Edward  III an act for regulating the price of  Lob Ling  and  Cod  being made in his st year  In the  Yorkshire  seas they are in perfection from the beginning of  February  to the beginning of  May  and some till the end of that month In  June  they spawn depositing their eggs in the soft oozy ground of the mouth of the  Tees  at that time the males separate from the females and resort to some rocky ground near  Flamborough Head  where the fishermen take great numbers without ever finding any of the female or roed fish among them  While a ling is in season its liver is very white  Oil  and abounds with a fine flavored oil but as soon as the fish goes out of season the liver becomes red as that of a bullock and affords no oil The same happens to the cod and other fish in a certain degree but not so remarkably as in the ling When the fish is in perfection a very large quantity of oil may be melted out of the liver by a slow fire but if a violent sudden heat be used for that purpose they yield very little This oil which nature hoards up in the cellular membranes of fishes returns into their blood and supports them in the engendring season when they pursue the business of generation with so much eagerness as to neglect their food  Vast quantities of ling is salted for exportation as well as for home consumption When it is cut or split for curing it must measure twentysix inches or upwards from the shoulder to the tail if less than  that it is not reckoned a sizeable fish and consequently not entitled to the bounty on exportation such are called  Drizzles  and are in season all summer  The ufual size of a ling is from three to four feet  Descr  but we have heard of one that was seven feet long  The body is very slender the head flat the upper jaw the longest the teeth in that jaw small and very numerous in the lower few slender and sharp on the chin is a small beard  The first dorsal

the sideline and runs half way down the back  The color of the upper part of the body is a pale brown sometimes marked with a few obscure spots of dirty yellow the belly is white  We have met with a variety of this fish with the eyes and lateral line on the left side  Linnaeus  makes a distinct species of it under the name of  Pleuronectes Passer  p but since it differs in no other respect from

twenty pounds weight but have heard of some that weighed thirty They are taken chiefly off the north coast of  England  and others off the  Dutch  coast but we believe the last has in many instances more credit than it deserves for the abundance of its fish  The large turbots and several other kinds of flat fish  Fishery  are taken by the hook and line for they lye in deep water the method of taking them in wares or staked nets is too precarious to be depended on for the supply of our great markets because it is by meer accident that the great fish stray into them  It is a misfortune to the inhabitants of many of our fishing coasts especially those of the north part of  North Wales  that they are unacquainted with the  most successful means of capture for their benefit and perhaps that of other parts of our island we shall lay before them the method practised by the fishermen of  Scarborough  as it was communicated to us by Mr  Travis  When they go out to fish each person is provided with three lines  Lines  Each man's lines are fairly coiled upon a flat oblong piece of wickerwork the hooks being baited and placed very regularly in the centre of the coil Each line is furnished with score of hooks at the distance of six feet two inches from each other The hooks are fastened to the lines upon sneads of twisted horsehair inches in length  When fishing there are always three men in each coble and consequently nine of these lines are fastened together and used as one line extending in length near three miles and furnished with hooks An anchor and a buoy are fixed at the first end of the line and one more of each at the end of each man's lines in all four anchors which are commonly perforated stones and four buoys made of leather or cork The line is always laid across the current The tides of flood and ebb continue an equal time upon our coast and when undisturbed by winds run each way about six hours They are so rapid that the fishermen can only shoot and haul their lines at the turn of tide and therefore the lines always remain upon the ground about six hours  In this space the  myxine glutinosa  of  Linnaeus  will frequently penetrate the fish that are on the hooks and entirely devour them leaving only the skin and bones  The same rapidity of tide prevents their using handlines  and therefore two of the people commonly wrap themselves in the sail and sleep while the other keeps a strict lookout for fear of being run down by ships and to observe the weather For storms often rise so suddenly that it is with extreme difticulty they can sometimes escape to the shore leaving their lines behind  The coble is feet inches long  Coble  and feet extreme breadth It is about one ton burthen rowed with three pair of oars and admirably constructed for the purpose of encountering a mountanous sea they hoist sail when the wind suits  The fivemen boat is feet long and broad and of tons burthen it is so called tho' navigated by six men and a boy because one of the men is commonly hired to cook c and does not share in the profits with the other five All our able fishermen go in these boats to the herring fishery at  Yarmouth  the latter end of  September  and return about the middle of  November  The boats are then laid up until the beginning of  Lent  at which time they go off in them to the edge of the  Dogger  and other places to fish for turbot cod ling skates c They always take two cobles on board and when they come upon their ground anchor the boat throw out the cobles and fish in the same manner as those do who go from the shore in a coble with this difference only that here each man is provided with double the quantity of lines and instead of waiting the return of tide in the coble return to the boat and bait their other lines thus hawling one set and shooting another every turn of tide They  commonly run into harbour twice a week to deliver their fish The fivemen boat is decked at each end but open in the middle and has two large lugsails  The best bait for all kinds of fish is fresh herring cut in pieces of a proper size  Bait  and notwithstanding what has been said to the contrary they are taken here at any time in the winter and all the spring whenever the fishermen put down their nets for that purpose The fivemen boats always take some nets for that end Next to herrings are the lesser lampreys  The  Dutch  also use these fish as baits in the turbot fishery and purchase annually from the  Thames  fishermen as much as amounts to  l  worth for that purpose  which come all winter by landcarriage from  Tadcaster  The next baits in esteem are small hadocks cut in pieces sand worms muscles and limpets called here  Flidders  and lastly when none of these can be had they use bullock's liver The hooks used here are much smaller than those employed at  Iceland  and  Newfoundland  Experience has shewn that the larger fish will take a living small one upon the hook sooner than any bait that can be put on therefore they use such as the small fish can swallow The hooks are two inches and an half long in the shank and near an inch wide between the shank and the point The line is made of small cording and is always tanned before it is used  Turbots and all the rays are extremely delicate in their choice of baits If a piece of herring or hadock has been twelve hours out of the sea and then used as bait they will not touch it  This and the pearl are of a remarkable square form  Descr  the color of the upper part of the body is cinereous marked with numbers of black spots of different sizes the belly is white the skin is without scales but greatly wrinkled and mixed with small short spines dispersed without any order  X The PEARL  La Barbue  Belon    Rhombus laevis

years ago and exhibited as a shew at  Scarborough  It is of that genus which  Linnaeus  distinguishes by the name of  Chaetodon  from its bristly teeth and is said to be very common on the coast of  Guinea  It is well described by an anonymous writer in the  London Magazine  for  October  which we shall borrow as the account is confirmed to us by Mr  Travis  who had an opportunity of examining one of the same species  Newcastle Sept  On  Saturday  last was thrown upon the sands at  Blyth  a very rare and beautiful fish weighing between seventy and eighty pounds  That described in the  Philosophical Transactions  weighed eightytwo pounds    shaped like the sea bream The length was three feet and an half the breadth from back to belly almost two feet but the thickness from side to side not above six inches  The mouth small for the size of the fish forming a square opening and without any teeth in the jaws The tongue thick resembling that of a man but rough and thick set with beards or prickles pointing backwards so that any thing might easily pass down but could not easily return back therefore these might serve instead of teeth to retain its prey  The writer omitted the description of the tongue and its setaceous teeth which we supply from the  Transactions  The eyes remarkably large covered with a membrane and shining with a glare of gold The cover of the gills like the salmon  The body diminishes very small to the tail which is forked and expands twelve inches the gill fins are broad about eight inches long and play horizontally a little behind their insertion the back fin takes its original where it is about seven inches high but slopes away very suddenly running down very near the tail and at its termination becomes a little broader the belly fins are very strong and placed near the middle of the body a narrow fin also runs from the anus to the tail  All the fins and also the tail are of a fine scarlet but the colours and beauty of the rest of the body which is smooth and covered with almost impercepticle scales beggars all description the upper part being a kind of bright green variegated with whitish  spots and enriched with a shining golden hue much resembling the splendor of the peacock's feathers this by degrees vanishes in a bright silver and near the belly the gold begins again to predominate in a lighter ground than on the back

wonder then that such a prodigy as one of six pounds should so captivate the fancy of the  Roman  epicure  Mr  Ray  establishes some other distinctions such as the first dorsal sin having nine rays and the color of that fin the tail and the pectoral fins being of a very pale purple  On these authorities we form different species of these fish having only examined what  Salvianus  and Mr  Ray

the salt and fresh waters  Ascends rivers  quitting the sea at certain seasons for  the sake of depositing its spawn in security in the gravelly beds of rivers remote from their mouths There are scarce any difficulties but what they will overcome in order to arrive at places fit for their purpose they will ascend rivers hundreds of miles force themselves against the most rapid streams and spring with amazing agility over cataracts of several feet in height Salmon are frequently taken in the  Rhine  as high up as  Basil  Salmon leaps  they gain the sources of the  Lapland  rivers  Scheff Lap    in spite of their torrentlike currents and surpass the perpendicular falls of  Leixslip  Near  Dublin    Kennerth  On the  Tivy  in  South Wales  which  Michael Drayton  celebrates in his  Polyolbion  on this account  and  Pont aberglastyn  Amidst  Snowdon  hills a wild scene in the style of  Salvator Rosa  these last feats we have been witness to and seen the efforts of scores of fish some of which succeeded others miscarried during the time of our stay  It may here be proper to contradict the vulgar error of their taking their tail in their mouth when they attempt to leap such as we saw sprung up quite strait and with a strong tremulous motion  Other particulars relating to the natural history of this fish we shall relate in our accounts of the fisheries either from our own observations or from such as have been communicated to us from different places the fullest we have been favored with is from Mr  Potts  of  Berwick  Tweed  fishery  to whom the publick is indebted for the following very curious history of the salmon fishery on the  Tweed  At the latter end of the year or in the month of  November  the salmon begin to press up the rivers as far as they can reach in order to spawn when that time approaches they search for a place fit for the purpose  Spawning  the male and female unite in forming a proper receptacle for it in the sand or gravel about the depth of eighteen inches in this the female deposits her spawn the male his milt which they cover carefully as it is said with their tails for after spawning they are observed to have no skin on that part  The spawn lies buried till spring if not disturbed by violent floods but the salmon hasten to sea as soon as they are able to purify and cleanse themselves and to recover their strength for after spawning they become very poor and lean and then are called  Kipper  About the latter end of  March  the spawn begins to exclude the young which gradually increase to the length of four or five inches and are then termed  Smelts  or  Smouts  about the beginning of  May  the river is full of them it seems to be all alive there is no having an idea of the numbers without seeing them but a seasonable flood then hurries them all to the sea scarce any or very few being left in the river  About the middle of  June  the earliest of the fry begin to drop as it were into the river again from the sea at that time about twelve fourteen or sixteen inches and by a gradual progress increase in number and size till about the end of  July  which is at  Berwick  termed the height of  Gilse  time the  name given to the fish at that age the end of  July  or beginning of  August  they lessen in number but encrease in size some being six seven eight or nine pounds in weight this appears to be a surprising quick growth  Quick growth  yet we have received from a gentleman at  Warrington  an instance still more so a kipper salmon weighing lb three quarters taken on the th of  February  being marked with a scissars on the back fin and tail and turned into the river was again taken the th of  March  following and then was found to weigh lb and a half  The capture in the  Tweed  Capture  about the month of  July  is prodigious in a good fishery often a boat load and sometimes near two are taken in a tide some few years ago there were above seven hundred fish taken at one hawl but from fifty to a hundred is very frequent the coopers in  Berwick  then begin to salt both  Salmon  and  Gilses  in pipes and other large vessels and afterwards barrel  The salmon barrel holds above fortytwo gallons wine measure  them to send abroad having then far more than the  London  markets can take off their hands  Most of the salmon taken before  April  or to the setting in of the warm weather is sent fresh to  London  in baskets unless now and then the vessel is disappointed by contrary winds of sailing immediately in that case the fish is brought ashore again to the coopers offices and boiled pickled and kitted and sent to the  London  markets by the same ship and fresh salmon put in the baskets in lieu of the stale ones At the beginning of the season when a ship  is on the point of sailing a fresh clean salmon will sell from a shilling to eighteen pence a pound  Price  and most of the time that this part of the trade is carried on the prices are from five to nine

on account of the change of the style  There are on the river fortyone considerable fisheries extending upwards about fourteen miles from the mouth the others above being of no great value which are rented for near  l  per annum The expences attending the servants wages nets boats c amount to  l  more which together makes up the sum  l  Now in consequence  the produce must defray all and no less than twenty times that sum of fish will effect it so that salmon must be caught there one year with another  There is a misfortune attending the river  Tweed  which is worthy a parlementary remedy for there is no law for preserving the fish in it during the fence months as there is in the case of many other  British  rivers This being the boundary between the two kingdoms part of it belongs to the city of  Berwick  and the whole north side beginning about two miles from the town is entirely  Scotch  property From some disagreement between the parties they will not unite for the preservation of the fish so that in some fisheries on the north side they continue killing salmon the whole winter when the death of one fish is the destruction of thousands  The legislature began very early to pay attention to this important article by the th  Edward  Ist there is an act which prohibits the capture of the salmon from the Nativity of our Lady to St  Martin  's Day in the waters of the  Humber Owse Trent Done Arre Derwent Wharfe Nid Yore Swale  and  Tees  and other monarchs in aftertimes provided in like manner for the security of the fish in other rivers  Scotland  possesses great numbers of fine fisheries on both sides of that kingdom  Scotland  The salmon are cured in the same manner as at  Berwick  and a great quantity is sent to  London  in the spring but after that time the adventurers begin to barrel and export them to foreign countries but we believe that  commerce is far less lucrative than it was in former times partly owing to the great encrease of the  Newfoundland  fishery and partly to the general relaxation of the discipline of abstinence in the  Romish  church  Ireland  particularly the north abounds with this fish  Ireland  the most considerable fishery is at  Cranna  on the river  Ban  about a mile and an half from  Coleraine  When I made the tour of that hospitable kingdom in it was rented by a neighboring gentleman for  l  a year who assured me that the tenant his predecessor gave  l  per ann and was a much greater gainer by the bargain for the reasons beforementioned and on account of the number of poachers who destroy the fish in the fence months  The mouth of this river faces the north and is finely situated to receive the fish that roam along the coast in search of an inlet into some fresh water as they do all along that end of the kingdom which opposes itself to the northern ocean We have seen near  Ballicastle  nets placed in the sea at the foot of the promontories that jut into it which the salmon strike into as they are wandering close to shore and numbers are taken by that method  In the  Ban  they fish with nets eighteen score yards long and are continually drawing night and day the whole season which we think lasts about four months two sets of sixteen men each alternately relieving one another The best drawing is when the tide is coming in we were told that at a single draught there were once eight hundred and forty fish taken  A few miles higher up the river is a ware where a considerable number of fish that escape the nets are taken We were lately informed that in the year about tons were taken in the  Cranna  fishery  The salmon are cured in this manner they are first split and rubbed with fine salt and after lying in pickle in great tubs or reservoirs for six weeks are packed up with layers of coarse brown  Spanish  salt in casks six of which make a ton These are exported to  Leghorn  and  Venice  at the price of twelve or thirteen pounds per ton but formerly from sixteen to twentyfour pounds each  The salmon is a fish so generally known  Descr  that a very brief description will serve The largest we ever heard of weighed seventyfour pounds The color of the back and sides are grey sometimes spotted with black sometimes plain the covers of the gills are subject to the same variety the belly silvery the nose sharp pointed the end of the under jaw in the males often turns up in form of a hook sometimes this curvature is very considerable it is said that they lose this hook when they return to the sea  The teeth are lodged in the jaws and on the tongue and are slender

Trouts probably of the same species are also taken in  Hulsewater  a lake in  Cumberland  of a much superior size to those of  Lough Neagh  These are supposed to be the same with the trout of the lake

productions as our friend the Hon  Daines Barrington  has already given an account of them in an ingenious differtation on some of the  Cambrian  fish published in the  Philosophical Transactions  of the year  Trouts are most voracious fish and afford excellent diversion to the angler the passion for the sport of angling is so strong in the neighborhood of  London  that the liberty of fishing in

and in  Wales  It is by several imagined to be the fry of the salmon but our reasons for dissenting from that opinion are these  First It is well known that the salmon fry never  continue in the fresh waters the whole year but as numerous as they appear on their first escape from the spawn all vanish on the first vernal flood that happens which sweeps them into the sea and leaves scarce one behind  Secondly The growth of the salmon fry is so quick and so considerable as suddenly to exceed the bulk of the largest samlet for example the fry that have quitted the fresh water in the spring not larger than gudgeons return into it again a foot or more in length  Thirdly The salmon attain a considerable bulk before they begin to breed the samlets on the contrary are found male and female  It has been vulgarly imagined that there were no other than males of this species  dstinguished by the milt and roe of their common size  Fourthly They are found in the fresh waters in all times of the year and even at seasons when the salmon fry have gained a considerable size It is well known that near  Shrewsbury  where they are called  Samsons  they are found in such quantities in the month of  September  that a skilful angler in a coracle will take with a fly from twelve to sixteen dozen in a day  They spawn in  November  and  December  at which time those of the  Severn  push up towards the head of that fair river quitting the lesser brooks and return into them again when they have done  They have a general resemblance to the trout therefore must be described comparatively  First The head is proportionably narrower and the mouth less than that of the trout  Secondly Their body is deeper  Thirdly They seldom exceed six or seven inches in length  Fourthly The pectoral fins have generally but one large black spot tho' sometimes a single small one attends it whereas the pectoral fins of the trout are more numerously marked  Fifthly The spurious or fat fin on the back is never tipped with red nor is the edge of the anal fin white  Sixthly The spots on the body are fewer and not so bright It is also marked from the back to the sides with six or seven large bluish bars but this is not a certain character as the same is sometimes found in young trouts  Seventhly The tail of the samlet is much more forked than that of the trout  VI The CHARR  L'Omble ou Humble  Belon

of the north and of those of the mountanous parts of  Europe  It affects clear and pure waters and is very rarely known to wander into running streams except into such whose bottom is similar to the neighboring lake  It is found in vast abundance in the cold lakes on the summits of the  Lapland Alps  and is almost the only fish that is met with in any plenty in those regions where it would be wonderful how they subsisted had not Provindence supplied them with innumerable  larvae  of the  Gnat  kind  A pupil of  Linnaeus  remarks in the fourth volume of the  Amsen Acad p  that the same insects which are such a pest to the rein deer afford sustenance to the fish of the vast lakes and rivers of  Lapland  But at the same time that we wonder at  Linnaeus  's inattention to the food of the birds and fish of that country which abound even to a noxious degree we must in justice to that gentleman acknowlege an oversight of our own in the second volume of the  British Zoology p  where we give the  Lapland  waters only one species of water plant for on more careful review of that elaborate performance the  Flora Lapponica  we discover three other species viz  Scirpus No    Alopecurus No    Ranunculus No  but those so thinly scattered over the  Lapland  lakes as still to vindicate our assertion as to the scarceness of plants in the waters of alpine countries  these are

the addition  Arted Sp pisc    of sauces for exercise and temperance render useless the inventions of epicurism  There are but few lakes in our island that produce this fish and even those not in any abundance It is found in  Winander Mere  in  Westmorland  in  Llyn Quellyn  near the foot of  Snowdon  and before the discovery of the coppermines in those of  Llynberris  but the mineral streams have entirely destroyed the fish in the last lakes  They are also found in certain lakes in  Merionethshire  Whether the waters of  Ireland  afford the charr we are uncertain but imagine not except it has been overlooked by their writers on the natural history of that kingdom In  Scotland  it is found in  Loch Inch  and other neighboring lakes and is said to go into the  Spey  to spawn  The largest and most beautiful we ever received were taken in  Winander Mere  and were communicated to us by the Rev Mr  Farrish  of  Carlisle  with an account of their natural history He favored me with five specimens two under the name of the  Case Charr  male and female another he called the  Gelt Charr  i e a charr which had not spawned the preceding season and on that account is reckoned to be in the greatest perfection The two others were inscribed the  Red Charr the Silver or Gilt Charr  the  Carpio Lacus  BENACI  Raii syn pisc  which last are in  Westmorland  distinguished by the epithet  red  by reason of the flesh assuming a higher color than the other when dressed  On the closest examination  Varieties  we could not discover any specific differences in these specimens therefore must describe them as the same fish subject only to a slight variation in their form hereafter to be noted But there is in another respect an essential difference we mean in their oeconomy which is in all beings invariable the particulars we shall deliver in the very words of our obliging informant  The  Umbla minor  Spawning of the case aharr  or case charr spawns about  Michaelmas  and chiefly in the river  Brathy  which uniting with another called the  Rowthay  about a quarter of a mile above the lake they both fall into it together The  Brathy  has a black rocky bottom the bottom of the  Rowthay  is a bright sand and into this the charr are never observed to enter Some of them however spawn in the lake but always in such parts of it which are stony and resemble the  channel of the  Brathy  They are supposed to be in the highest perfection about  May  and continue so all the summer yet are rarely caught after  April  When they are spawning in the river they will take a bait but at no other time being commonly taken as well as the other species in what they call  breast nets  which are in length about twentyfour fathoms and about five where broadest  The season which the other species spawns in is from the beginning of  January  to the end of  March  Gilt charr  They are never known to ascend the rivers but always in those parts of the lake which are springy where the bottom is smooth and sandy and the water warmest The fishermen judge of this warmth by observing that the water seldom freezes in the places where they spawn except in intense frosts and then the ice is thinner than in other parts of the lake They are taken in greatest plenty from the end of  September  to the end of  November  at other times they are hardly to be met with This species is much more esteemed for the table than the other and is very delicate when potted  We must observe that this account of the spawning season of the  Westmorland  charrs agrees very nearly with that of those of  Wales  the last appearing about a month later keep moving from side to side of the pool and then retire into the deep water where they are sometimes but rarely taken  This remarkable circumstance of the different season of spawning in fish apparently the same for the red charr of  Winander  is certainly not the  Carpio Lacus  BENACI  A fish well described by  Salvianus p  which bears no kind of resemblance to our fish except the generical one  puzzles us greatly and makes us wish that the curious who border on that lake would pay farther attention to the natural history of these fish and favor us with some further lights on the subject  We shall now describe the varieties by the names ascribed to them in the north  The length of the red charr to the division in its tail  Red charr  was twelve inches its biggest circumference almost seven The first dorsal fin five inches and three quarters from the tip of its nose and consisted of twelve branched rays the first of which was short the fifth the longest the fat fin was very small  Each of the five fish had double nostrils and small teeth in the jaws roof of the mouth and on the tongue  The head back dorsal fin and tail of each was of a dusky blue the sides rather paler marked with numbers of bright red spots the bellies of the  Red Charr  were of a full and rich red those of the  Case Charr  rather paler from this particular the  Welch  call these fish  Torgoch  or red belly  The first rays of the anal and ventral fins of each were of a pure white the rest of each fin on the lower part of the body tinged with red  The lateral line strait dividing the fish in two equal parts or nearly so  The jaws in the  Case Charr  are perfectly even on the contrary those of the  Red Charr  were unequal  the upper jaw being the broadest and the teeth hung over the lower as might be perceived on passing the finger over them  The branchiostegous rays were on different sides of the same fish unequal in number viz except in one where they were  The  Gelt  or  Barren Charr  Gelt charr  was rather more slender than the others as being without spawn The back of a glossy dusky blue the sides filvery mixed with blue spotted with pale red the sides of the belly were of a pale red the bottom white  The tails of each bifurcated  The charrs we have seen brought from the  Snowdon  lakes were rather smaller than those of  Westmorland  their colors paler The supposed males very much resemble the  Gelt Charr  but that is not a certain distinction of sex for the Rev Mr  Farrington  Who favored the Royal Society with a paper on the  Welch  charr  Vide Phil Trans    has told me that the fishermen do not make that distinction  VII The GRAYLING  Aelian de an lib  xiv  c  Umbra  Ausonii Mosella    Thymalus Thymus

March  and  April  they spawn after which  In the river  Conway  near  Llanrwst  and in the  Mersey  they never continue above three or four weeks  they all return to the salt water and are not seen in the rivers till the next season It has been observed that they never come into the  Mersey  as long as there is any snow water in the river  These fish vary greatly in size but the largest we ever

from the whiteness of its scales The  British  name  Gwiniad  or whiting was bestowed on it for the same reason  It is a gregarious fish and approaches the shores in vast shoals in spring and in summer which prove in many places a blessed relief to the poor of inland countries in the same degree as the annual return of the herring is to those who inhabit the coasts The Rev Mr  Farrish  of  Carlisle  wrote me word that he was assured by a  Hulsewater  fisherman that last summer he took between seven and eight thousand at one draught I must not pass by that gentleman without acknowleging

pike is common in most of the lakes of  Europe  but the largest are those taken in  Lapland  which according to  Schaeffer  are sometimes eight feet long They are taken there in great abundance dried and exported for sale The largest fish of this kind which we ever heard of in  England  weighed thirtyfive pounds  All writers who treat of this species bring instances of its vast voraciousness We have known one that was choaked by attempting to swallow one of its own species that proved too large a morsel It does not confine itself to feed on fish and frogs it will devour the water rat and draw down the young ducks as they are swimming about In a manuscript note which we found p of our copy of  Plott  's History of  Staffordshire  is the following extraordinary fact  At Lord  Gower  's canal at  Trentham  a pike seized the head of a swan as she was feeding under water and gorged so much of it as killed them both The servants perceiving the swan with its head under water for a longer time than usual took the boat and found both swan and pike dead  This note we afterwards discovered was wrote by Mr  Plott  of  Oxford  who assured me he inserted it on good authority  But there are instances of its fierceness still more surprizing and which indeed border a little on the marvellous  Gesner  Gesner pisc    relates that a famished pike in the  Rhone  seized on the lips of a mule that was brought to water and that the beast drew the fish out before it could disengage itself That people have been bit by these voracious creatures while they were washing their legs and that they will even contend with the otter for its prey and endeavour to force it out of its mouth  Walton    Small fish shew the same uneasiness and detestation at the presence of this tyrant as the little  birds do at the sight of the hawk or owl When the pike lies dormant near the surface as is frequently the case the lesser fish are often observed to swim around it in vast numbers and in great anxiety Pike are often haltered in a noose and taken while they lie thus asleep as they are often found in the ditches near the  Thames  in the month of  May  In the shallow water of the  Lincolnshire  fens they are frequently taken in a manner peculiar we believe to that county and the isle of  Ceylon  Knox'  s  Hist Ceylon    The fishermen makes use of what is called a crownnet which is no more than a hemispherical basket open at top and bottom He stands at the end of one of the little fenboats and frequently puts his basket down to the bottom of the water then poking a stick into it discovers whether he has any booty by the striking of the fish and vast numbers of pike are taken in this manner  The longevity of this fish is very remarkable  Longevity  if we may credit the accounts given of it  Rzaczynski  Hist Nat Poloniae    tells us of one that was ninety years old but  Gesner  Iconos piscium  where a print of the ring is given  relates that in the year a pike was taken near  Hailbrun

other according to Mr  Jago  's conjecture is probably the same with the  Saurus  of  Rondeletius  Saurus  p which both those icthyologists agree has a shorter nose than the common species We have no other description of this fish than what is left us by  Rondeletius  who says that it is shorter and thicker than the other that the nose is shorter and turns up that  the edges of the jaws are serrated and that between the anal fin and the tail it has several spurious fins like the mackrel We do not venture to make a distinct article of this fish because Mr  Jago  has not pointed out the

bays that have influxes of fresh water They come in great shoals and keep rooting like hogs in the sand or mud leaving their traces in form of large round holes They are very cunning and when surrounded with a net the whole shoal frequently escapes by leaping over it for when one takes the lead the others are sure to follow this circumstance is taken notice of by  Oppian  whether the

June  one was caught at a small distance below  Caermarthen  in the river  Towy  being brought up by the tide which flows as far as the town It is a fish frequent enough in the  Mediterranean  and also in the ocean where it leads a most miserable life In its own element it is perpetually harassed by the  Dorados  and other fish of prey If it endeavors to avoid them by having recourse to the air it either meets its fate from the  Gulls  or the  Albatross  or is forced down again into the mouth of  the inhabitants of water who below keep pace with its aerial excursion Neither is it unfrequent that whole shoals of them fall on board of ships that navigate the seas of warm climates it is therefore apparent that nature in this creature hath supplied it with instruments that frequently bring it into that destruction it strives to avoid by having recourse to an element unnatural to it  The antients were acquainted with this species  Pliny  mentions it under the name of  Hirundo  and speaks of its flying faculty It is probable that  Oppian  intended the same by his  or the  swift swallow  fish What  Athenaeus  and the last cited author mean by the  and  is not so evident they assert it quitted the water and slept on the rocks from whence it tumbled with precipitation when disturbed by the unfriendly birds on these accounts Icthyologists seem to have made it synonymous with the

is an annual inundation of those fish which cover the shores in such quantities as to become a nusance  Catesby Carol  ii xxxiii  We find them again in the seas of  Kamtzchatka  and possibly they reach  Japan  for  Kaempfer  mentions in his account of the fish of that country some that are congenerous  The great winter rendezvous of the herring is within the  Arctic  circle there they continue for many months in order to recruit themselves after the fatigue of spawning the seas within that space swarming with insect food in a degree far greater than in our warmer latitudes  This mighty army begins to put itself in motion in the spring  Migrations  we distinguish this vast body by that name for the word herring is derived from the  German Heer  an army to express their numbers  They begin to appear off the  Shetland  isles in  April  and  May  these are only forerunners of the grand shoal which comes in  June  and their appearance is marked by certain signs by the numbers of birds such as gannets and others which follow to prey on them but when the main body approaches its breadth and its depth is such as to alter the appearance of the very ocean It is divided into distinct columns of five or six miles in length and three or four in breadth and they drive the water before them with a kind of rippling sometimes they slink for the space of ten or fifteen minutes then rise  again to the surface and in bright weather reflect a variety of splendid colors like a field of the most pretious gems in which or rather in a much more valuable light should this stupendous gift of Providence be considered by the inhabitants of the  British  isles  The first check this army meets in its march southward  Separation  is from the  Shetland  isles which divide it into two parts one wing takes to the east the other to the western shores of  GreatBritain  and fill every bay and creek with their numbers others pass on towards  Yarmouth  the great and antient mart of herrings they then pass thro' the  British  channel and after that in a manner disappear Those which take to the west after offering themselves to the  Hebrides  where the great stationary fishery is proceed towards the north of  Ireland  where they meet with a second interruption and are obliged to make a second division the one takes to the western side and is scarce perceived being soon lost in the immensity of the  Atlantic  but the other which passes into the  Irish  sea rejoices and feeds the inhabitants of most of the coasts that border on it  These brigades as we may call them which are thus separated from the greater columns are often capricious in their motions and do not shew an invariable attachment to their haunts We have had in our time instances of their entirely quitting the coasts of  Cardiganshire  and visiting those of  Caernarvonshire  and  Flintshire  where they continued for a few years but in the present year have quite deserted our sea and returned to their old seats The  season of their appearance among us was very late never before the latter end of  November  their continuance till  February  Were we inclined to consider this partial migration of the herring in a moral light  Providential instinct  we might reflect with veneration and awe on the mighty Power which originally impressed on this most useful body of his creatures the instinct that directs and points out the course that blesses and enriches these islands which causes them at certain and invariable times to quit the vast polar deeps and offer themselves to our expecting fleets That benevolent Being has never from the earliest records been once known to withdraw this blessing from the whole tho' he often thinks proper to deny it to particulars yet this partial failure for which we see no natural reason should fill us with the most exalted and grareful sense of his Providence for impressing so invariable and general instinct on these fish towards a southward migration when the whole is to be benefited and to withdraw it only when a minute part is to suffer  This instinct was given them  Spawaing  that they might remove for the sake of depositing their spawn in warmer seas that would mature and vivify it more assuredly than those of the frigid zone It is not from defect of food that they set themselves in motion for they come to us full and fat and on their return are almost universally observed to be lean and miserable What their food is near the pole we are not yet informed but in our seas they feed much on the  Oniscus Marinus  a crustaceous insect  Food  and sometimes on their own fry  They are in full roe the end of  June  and continue in perfection till the beginning of winter when they begin to deposit their spawn The young herrings begin to approach the shores in  July  and  August  and are then from half an inch to two inches long those in  Yorkshire  are called  Herring Sile  The  Sueaes  and  Danes  call the old herring  Sill  but the people of  Slesw  from whence the  AngloSaxons  came call the fry  Sylen  Tho' we have no particular authority for it  Return  yet as very few young herrings are found in our seas during winter it seems most certain that they must return to their parental haunts beneath the ice to repair the vast destruction of their race during summer by men fowl and fish Some of the old herrings eontinue on our coasts the whole year the  Scarborough  fishermen never put down their nets but they catch a few but the numbers that remain are not worth mention in comparison to the numbers that return  Herrings vary greatly in size  Descr  Mr  Travis  communicated to me the information of an experienced fisher who informed him that there is sometimes taken near  Yarmouth  a herring distinguished by a black spot above the nose and that he once saw one that was twentyone inches and an half long He insisted that it was a different species and varied as much from the common herring as that does from the pilchard This we mention in order to incite some curious person on that coast to a farther enquiry  The eye is very large the edges of the upper jaw and the tongue are very rough but the whole mouth  is void of teeth the gill covers are very loose and open very wide which occasions the almost instant death of the herring when taken out of the water which is well known even to a proverb  The dorsal fin consists of about seventeen rays and is placed beyond the centre of gravity so that when the fish is suspended by it the head immediately dips down the two ventral fins have nine rays the pectoral seventeen the anal fourteen the tail is much forked  The lateral line is not apparent unless the scales are taken off the sides are compressed the belly sharply carinated but the ridge quite smooth and not in the lest serrated  The scales are large thin and fall off with a slight touch  The color of the back and sides green  Color  varied with blue the belly silvery  The herring fishery is of great antiquity  Fishery  the industrious  Dutch  first engaged in it about the year they were in possession of it for several centuries but at length its value become so justly to be known that it gave rise to most obstinate and welldisputed wars between the  English  and them but still their diligence and skill gives them a superiority over us in that branch of trade  Our great stations are off the  Shetland  and  Western Isles  and off the coast of  Norfolk  in which the  Dutch  also share  Yarmouth  has long been famous for its herring fair  This fair was regulated by an act commonly called the  Statute of Herrings  in the st year of  Edward  III  that town is obliged by its  charter to send to the sheriffs of  Norwich  one hundred herrings to be made into twentyfour pies by them to be delivered to the lord of the manor of  East Carleton  who is to convey them to the king  Cambden Britan  I  The facetious Doctor  Fuller  British Worthies    takes notice of the great repute the county of  Norfolk  was in for this fish and with his usual archness calls a red herring a  Norfolk Capon  The  Dutch  are most extravagantly fond of this fish when it is pickled A premium is given to the first buss that arrives in  Holland  with a lading of this their  ambrosia  and a vast price given for each keg We have been in the country at that happy minute and observed as much joy among the inhabitants on its arrival as the  Aegyptians  shew on the first overflowing of the  Nile Flanders  had the honor of inventing the art of pickling herrings One  William Beukelen  of  Biervlet  near  Sluys  hit on this useful expedient from him was derived the name  pickle  which we borrow from the  Dutch  and  German  It is very singular that most nations give the name of their favorite dish to the facetious attendant on every mountebank Thus the  Dutch  call him PICKLE HERRING the  Italians  MACARONI the  French  JEAN POTTAGE the  Germans  HANS WURST  That is  Jack Sausage  and we dignify

Cornwall    THE pilchard appears in vast shoals off the  Cornish  coasts about the middle of  July  disappear the beginning of winter yet sometimes a few return again after  Christmas  Their winter retreat is the same with that of the herring and their motives for migrating the same They affect during summer a warmer latitude for they are not found in any quantities on any of our coasts except those of  Cornwall  that is to say from  Fowey  harbor to the  Scilly  isles between which places the shoals keep shifting for some weeks  The approach of the pilchard is known by much the same signs as those that indicate the arrival of the herring Persons called in  Cornwall Huers  are placed on the cliffs to point to the boats stationed off the land the course of the fish By the st of  James  c fishermen are empowered to go on the grounds of others to  bue  without being liable to actions of trespass which before occasioned frequent lawsuits  The emoluments that accrue to the inhabitants of that county are great and are best expressed in the words of Doctor  W Borlase  in his account of the  Pilchard  fishery  It employs a great number of men on the sea training them thereby to naval affairs employs men women and children at land in salting pressing washing and cleaning in making boats nets ropes casks and all the trades depending on their construction and sale The poor is fed with the offals of the captures the land with the refuse of the fish and salt the merchant finds the gains of commission and honest commerce the fisherman the gains of the fish Ships are often freighted hither with salt and into foreign countries with the fish carrying off at the same time part of our tin The usual produce of the number of hogsheads exported each year for ten years from to inclusive from the four ports of  Fawy Falmouth Penzance  and  St Ives  it appears that  Fawy  has exported yearly hogsheads  Falmouth  hogsheads and twothirds  Penzance  and  MountsBay  hogsheads and onethird  St Ives  hogsheads in all amounting to hogsheads Every hogshead for ten years last past together with the bounty allowed for each hogshead exported and the oil made out of each hogshead has amounted one year with another at an average to the price of one pound thirteen shillings and threepence so that the cash paid for pilchards exported has at a medium annually amounted to the sum of fortynine thousand five hundred and thirtytwo pounds ten shillings  XVII PILCHARD HERRING  The numbers that are taken at one shooting out of the nets is amazingly great Doctor  Borlase  assured me that on the th of  October  there were at one time inclosed in  St Ives's Bay  hogsheads each hogshead containing fish in all  This fish has a general likeness to the herring  Descr  but differs in some particulars very essentially we therefore describe it comparatively with the other having one of each species before us both of them of the same length  viz  nine inches and an half  The body of the pilchard is less compressed than that of the herring being thicker and rounder the nose is shorter in proportion and turns up the under jaw is shorter  The back is more elevated the belly less sharp the dorsal fin of the pilchard is placed exactly in the centre of gravity so that when taken up by it the body preserves an equilibrium whereas that of the herring dips at the head the dorsal fin of the pilchard we examined being placed only three inches eight tenths from the tip of the nose that of the herring four inches one tenth  The scales of the pilchard adhere very closely whereas those of the herring very easily drop off  The pilchard is in general less than the herring the specimen we describe being a very large one The pilchard is fatter or more full of oil  III The SPRAT

suec No    MR  Willoughby  and Mr  Ray  were of opinion that these fish were the fry of the herring we are induced to dissent from them not only because on comparing a sprat and young herring of equal size we discovered some specific differences but likewise for another reason the former visits our coasts and continue with us in shoals innumerable when the others in general have retired to the great northern deeps  They come into the river  Thames  below bridge the beginning of  November  and leave it in  March  and are during their season a great relief to the poor of the capital  At  Gravesend  and at  Yarmouth  they are cured like red herrings they are sometimes pickled and are little inferior in flavor to the  Anchovy  but the bones will not dissolve like those of the latter Mr  Forster  tells me that in the  Baltic  they preserve them in the same manner and call them  Breitling  i e the little deep fish as being deeper than the  Stromling  or  Baltic  herring  The sprat

have agreed to render the  of the first and the  Alausa  of the last by the word  Shad  Perhaps they were directed by the authority of  Strabo  who mentions the  the supposed  Shad  and the  or  Mullet  as fish that ascend the  Nile  at certain seasons which with the  Dolphin  This is the  Dolphin  of the  Nile  a fish now unknown to us  Pliny lib  viii  c  says it had a sharp sin on its back with which it destroyed the crocodile by thrusting it into the belly of that animal the only penetrable place  of that river he says are the only kinds that venture up from the sea for fear of the crocodile That the two first are fish of passage in the  Nile  is confirmed to us by  Belonius  Belon Itin    and by  Hasselquist  P    Suedish  edition  The last says it is found in the  Mediterranean  near  Smyrna  and on the coast of  Aegypt  near  Rosetto  and that in the months of  December  and  January  it ascends the  Nile  as high as  Cairo  that it is stuffed with pot marjoram and when dressed in that manner will very nearly intoxicate the eater  In  Great Britain  the  Severn  affords this fish in higher perfection than any other river It makes its first appearance there in  May  but in very warm seasons in  April  for its arrival sooner or later depends much on the temper of the air It continues  in the river about two months and then is succeeded by a variety which we shall have occasion to mention hereafter  The  Severn  shad is esteemed a very delicate fish about the time of its first appearance especially in that part of the river that flows by  Gloucester  where they are taken in nets and usually sell dearer than salmon some are sent to  London  where the fishmongers distinguish them from those of the  Thames  by the  French  name of  Alose  Whether they spawn in this river and the  Wye  is not determined for their fry has not yet been ascertained The old fish come from the sea into the river in full roe In the months of  July  and  August  multitudes of bleak frequent the river near  Gloucester  some of them are as big as a small herring and these the fishermen erroneously suspect to be the fry of the shad Numbers of these are taken near  Gloucester  in those months only but none of the emaciated shad are ever caught in their return  Belon  also observes that none are taken in their return on  tes prend en moutant contre les rivieres et jamais en descendant  The  Thames  shad does not frequent that river till the month of  July  Twaite  and is esteemed a very insipid coarse fish About the same time and rather earlier the variety called near  Gloucester  the  Twaite  makes its appearance and is taken in great numbers in the  Severn  and is held in as great disrepute as the shad of the  Thames  The differences between each variety are as follow The true  Shad  weighs sometimes eight pounds but their general size is from four to five  The  Twaite  on the contrary weighs from half a pound to two pounds which it never exceeds  The twaite differs from a small shad only in having one or more round black spots on the sides if only one it is always near the gill but commonly there are three or four placed one under the other  I must here acknowlege my obligations to Doctor  Lysons  of  Gloucester  for his communications relating to this fish as well as to several other articles relating to those of the  Severn  The other particulars agree in each so exactly  Descr  that the same description will serve for both  The head slopes down considerably from the back which at the beginning is very convex and rather sharp the body from thence grows gradually less to the tail  The under jaw is rather longer than the upper the teeth very minute  The dorsal fin is placed very near the centre is small and the middle rays are the longest the pectoral and ventral fins are small the tail vastly forked the belly extremely sharp and most strongly serrated  The back is of a dusky blue  Color  above the gills

instances of some who make good profit of their ponds  The antients do not separate the carp from the sea fish We are credibly informed that they are sometimes found in the harbor of  Dantzick  between the town and a small place called  Hela  Carp are very long lived  Gesner  Gesner pisc    brings an instance of one that was an hundred years old They also grow to a very great size On our own knowlege we can speak of none that exceeded twenty pounds in weight but  Jovius  De piscibus Romanis    says that they were sometimes taken in the  Lacus Larius  the  Lago di Como  of two hundred pounds weight and  Rzaczynski  Hist Nat Poloniae    mentions others taken in the  Dniester  that were five feet in length  They are also extremely tenacious of life and will live for a most remarkable time out of water  An experiment has been made by placing a carp in a net well wrapped up in wet moss the mouth only remaining out and then hung up in a cellar or some cool place the fish is frequently fed with white bread and milk and is besides often plunged into water Carp thus managed have been known not only to have lived above a fortnight but to grow exceedingly fat and far superior in taste to those that are immediately killed from the pond  This was told me by a gentleman of the utmost veracity who had twice made the experiment The same fact is related by that pious Philosopher Doctor  Derham  in his  PhysicoTheology  edit th  ch  i  p    n e  The carp is a prodigious breeder  Foecundity  its quantity of roe has been sometimes found so great that when taken out and weighed against the fish itself the former has been found to preponderate We have forbore in this work to enter into minute calculations of the numbers each fish may produce It has already been most skilfully performed by Mr  Harmer  and printed in the  Philosophical Transactions  of the year We shall in our Appendix take the liberty of borrowing such part of his tables of the foecundity of fish as will demonstrate the kind attention of Providence towards the preserving so useful a class of animals for the service of its other creatures  These fish are extremely cunning and on that account are by some styled the  river fox  They will sometimes leap over the nets and escape that way at others will immerse themselves so deep in the mud as to let the net pass over them They are  also very shy of taking a bait yet at the spawning time they are so simple as to suffer themselves to be tickled handled and caught by any body that will attempt it  This fish is apt to mix its milt with the roe of other fish  Spurious breed  from which is produced a spurious breed we have seen the offspring of the carp and tench which bore the greatest resemblance to the first we have also heard of the same mixture between the carp and bream  The carp is of a thick shape the scales very large  Descr  and when in best season of a fine gilded hue  The jaws are of equal length there are two teeth in the jaws or on the tongue but at the entrance of the gullet above and below are certain bones that act on each other and comminute the food before it passes down  On each side of the mouth is a single beard above those on each side another but shorter the dorsal fin extends far towards the tail which is a little bifurcated the third ray of the dorsal fin is very strong and armed with sharp teeth pointing downwards the third ray of the anal fin is constructed in the same manner  II The BARBEL  Barbus  Ausonius Mosella    Barbeau  Belon    Barbus Barbo  Salvian    Barbus  Rondel fluviat

our  Chub  is very evident not only because the  Chub  is entirely an inhabitant of fresh waters but likewise it seems improbable that the  Romans  would give themselves any trouble about the worst of river fish when they neglected the most delicious kinds all their attention was directed towards those of the sea the difficulty of procuring them seems to have been the criterion of their value as is ever the case with effete luxury  The chub is a very coarse fish and full of bones it frequents the deep holes of rivers and during summer commonly lies on the surface beneath the shade of some tree or bush It is a very timid fish sinking to the bottom on the lest alarm even at the passing of a shadow but they will soon resume their situation It feeds on worms caterpillars grasshoppers beetles and other coleopterous insects that happen to fall into the water and it will even feed on crayfish It is the only fish of this genus that will rife to a fly  This fish takes its name from its head

taken at  There are various conjectures about this species but all terminate in a supposition that they are the fry of some fish but few agree to which kind they owe their origin Some attribute it to the shad others to the sprat the smelt and the bleak That they neither belong to the shad nor the sprat is evident from the number of branchiostegous rays which in those are eight in this only three That they are not the young of smelts is as clear because they want the  pinna adiposa  or rayless fin and that they are not the offspring of the bleak is extremely probable since we never heard of the white bait being found in any other river notwithstanding the bleak is very common in several of the  British  streams but as the white bait bears a greater similarity to this fish than to any other we have mentioned  we give it a place here as an appendage to the bleak rather than form a distinct article of a fish which it is impossible to class with certainty  It is evident that it is of the carp or  Cyprinus  genus it has only three branchiostegous rays and only one dorsal fin and in respect to the form of the body is compressed like that of the bleak  Its usual length is two inches

told them it was a  Mediterranean  turtle and not wholesome only one of the company eat of it and it almost killed him being seized with a dreadful vomiting and purging  Since the printing of that article I have been favored with some very curious accounts of this reptile  Toad    which will give greater light into its natural history than I am capable of from a most unphilosophical but invincible aversion to the whole genus The facts that will appear in the following lines serve to confirm my opinion of its being an innoxious animal and I hope will serve to free numbers from a panic that is carried to a degree of infelicity  and also to redeem it from a persecution which the unmerited illopinion the world has conceived perpetually exposes it to  The gentlemen I am principally indebted to for my informations are  J Arscott  Esq  of  Tehott  in  Devonshire  and Mr  Pitfield  of  Exeter  Some of these accounts were addressed to Doctor  Milles  Dean of  Exeter  others to the worthy Prelate abovementioned to whom I owe these and many other agreeable correspondencies others again to myself  Mr  Arscott  's letters give a very ample history of the nature of the toad they were both addressed to Doctor  Milles  and both were the result of certain queries I proposed which the former was so obliging as to give himself the trouble of answering in a most satisfactory manner  I shall first take the liberty of citing Mr  Arscott  's letter of  September  the d which mentions some very curious particulars of this innocent reptile which for such a number of years found an asylum from the good sense of a  family which soared above all vulgar prejudices  It would give me the greatest pleasure to be able to inform you of any particulars worthy Mr  Pennant  's notice concerning the toad who lived so many years with us and was so great a favorite The greatest curiosity in it was its becoming so remarkably tame It had frequented some steps before the halldoor some years before my acquaintance commenced with it and had been admired by my father for its size which was of the largest I ever met with who constantly payed it a visit every evening I knew it myself above thirty years and by constantly feeding it brought it to be so tame that it always came to the candle and looked up as if expecting to be taken up and brought upon the table where I always fed it with insects of all sorts it was fondest of flesh maggots which I kept in bran it would follow them and when within a proper distance would fix its eye and remain motionless for near a quarter of a minute  as if preparing for the stroke which was an instantaneous throwing its tongue at a great distance upon the insect which stuck to the tip by a glutinous matter the motion is quicker than the eye can follow  This rapid capture of its prey might give occasion to the report of its fascinating powers  Linnaeus  says  Insecta in sauces fascine revocat  I always imagined that the root of its tongue was placed in the fore part of its under jaw and the tip towards its throat by which the motion must be a half circle by which when its tongue recovered its situation the insect at the tip would be brought to the place of deglutition I was confirmed in this by never observing any internal motion in its mouth excepting one swallow the instant its tongue returned Possibly I might be mistaken for I never dissected one but contented myself with opening its mouth and slightly inspecting it  You may imagine that a toad generally detested altho' one of the most inoffensive of all animals so much taken notice of and befriended excited the curiosity  of all comers to the house who all desired to see it fed so that even ladies so far conquered the horrors instilled into them by nurfes as to desire to see it This produced innumerable and improbable reports making it as large as the crown of a hat c c This I hope will account for my not giving you particulars more worth your notice When I first read the account in the papers of toads sucking cancerous breasts I did not believe a word of it not thinking it possible for them to suck having no lips to embrace the part and a tongue so oddly formed but as the fact is thoroughly verified I most impatiently long to be fully informed of all particulars relating to it  Notwithstanding these accounts will serve to point out some errors I had adopted in respect to this reptile in my first sheet yet it is with much pleasure I lay before the public a more authentic history collected from Mr  Arscott  's second favor the answer points out my queries which it is needless to repeat  Tehott Nov    In respect to the queries I shall here give the most satisfactory answers I am capable of  First I cannot say how long my father had been acquainted with the toad before I knew it but when I first was acquainted with it he used to mention it as the old toad I've known so many years I can answer for thirtysix years  Secondly No toads that I ever saw appeared in the winter season The old toad made its appearance as soon as the warm weather came and I always concluded it retired to some dry bank to repose till the spring When we newlay'd the steps I had two holes made in the third step on each with a hollow of more than a yard long for it in which I imagine it slept as it came from thence at its first appearance  Thirdly It was seldom provoked neither that toad nor the multitudes I have seen tormented with great cruelty ever shewed the lest desire of revenge by spitting or emitting any juice from their pimples Sometimes  upon taking it up it would let out a great quantity of clear water which as I have often seen it do the same upon the steps when quite quict was certainly its urine and no more than a natural evacuation  Fourthly A toad has no particular enmity for the spider he used to eat five or six with his millepides which I take to be its chief food that I generally provided for it before I found out that flesh maggots by their continual motion was the most tempting bait but when offered it eat blowing flies and humble bees that come from the rattailed maggot in gutters or in short any insect that moved I imagine if a bee was to be put before a toad it would certainly eat it to its cost but as bees are seldom stirring at the same time that toads are they can seldom come in their way as they seldom appear after sunrising or before sunset In the heat of the day they will come to the mouth of their hole I believe for air I once from my parlour window observed a large toad I had in the bank of a bowlinggreen about twelve at noon a very hot day very busy and active upon the grass so uncommon  an appearance made me go out to see what it was when I found an innumerable swarm of winged ants had dropped round his hole which temptation was as irresistible as a turtle would be to a luxurious alderman  Fifthly Whether our toad ever propagated its species I know not rather think not as it always appeared well and not lessened in bulk which it must have done I should think if it had discharged so large a quantity of spawn as toads generally do The females that are to propagate in the spring I imagine instead of retiring to dry holes go into the bottom of ponds and lay torpid amongst the weeds for to my great surprize in the middle of the winter having for amusement put a long pole into my pond and twisted it till it had gathered a large volume of weed on taking it off I found many toads and having cut some asunder with my knife by accident to get off the weed found them full of spawn not thoroughly formed I am not positive but think there were a few males in  March  I know there are thirty  males  Mr  John Hunter  has assured me that during his residence at  Belleisle  he dissected some hundreds of toads yet never met with a single female among them  to one female twelve or fourteen of whom I have seen clinging round a female I have often disengaged her and put her into a solitary male to see with what eagerness he would seize her They impregnate the spawn as it is drawn  I was incredulous as to the  obstetrical  offices of the male toad but since the end is so well accounted for and the fact established by such good authority belief must take place  Mr  Demours  in the Memoirs of the  French  Academy as translated by Dr  Templeman vol  I has been very particular in respect to the male toad as acting the part of an  Accoucheur  his account is curious and clames a place here  In the evening of one of the long days in summer Mr  Demours  being in the king's garden perceived two toads  coupled together  at the edge of an hole which was formed in part by a great stone at the top  Curiosity drew him to see what was the occasion of the motions he observed when two facts equally new surprized him the  first  was the extreme difficulty the female had in laying her eggs insomuch that she did not seem capable of being delivered of them without some assistance The  second  was that the male was mounted on the back of the female and exerted all his strength with his hinder feet in pulling out the eggs whilst his forefeet embraced her breast  In order to apprehend the manner of his working in the delivery of the female the reader must observe that the paws of these animals as well those of the forefeet as of the hinder are divided into several toes which can perform the office of fingers  It must be remarked likewise that the eggs of this species of toads are included each in a membranous coat that is very firm in which is contained the embryo and that these eggs which are oblong and about two lines in length being fastened one to another by a short but very strong cord form a kind of chaplet the beads of which are distant from each other about the half of their length It is by drawing this cord with his paw that the male performs the function of a midwife and acquits himself in it with a dexterity that one would not expect from so lumpish an animal  The presence of the observer did not a little discompose the male for some time he stopped short and threw on the  curious impertinent  a fixed look that marked his disquietness and fear but he soon returned to his work with more precipitation than before and a moment  after  he appeared undetermined whether he should continue it or not The female likewise discovered her uneasiness at the sight of the stranger by motions that interrupted sometimes the male in his operation At length whether the silence and steady posture of the spectator had dissipated their fear or that the  cas  was urgent the male resumed his work with the same vigour and successfully performed his function  out in long strings like a necklace  many yards long not in a large quantity of jelly like frogs spawn  N B  After having held a female some time in my hand I have to try if there was any smell put my finger a foot under water to a male who has immediately seized it and stuck to as firmly as if it was a female  Quere  Would they seize a finger or rag that had touched a cancerous ulcer  Sixthly Insects being their food I never saw any toad shew any liking or dislike to any plant  This question arose from an assertion of  Linnoeus  that the toad delighted in filthy herbs  Delectatur Cotula Actoea Stachyde foetidis  The unhappy deformity of the animal seems to be the only ground of this as well as another misrepresentation of its conveying a poison from its pimples its touch and even its breath  Verrucae lactejcentes venenatoe infusoe tactu anhelitu  Seventhly I hardly remember any persons taking it up except  my father and myself I do not know whether it had any particular attachment to us  Eighhtly In respect to its end I answer this last quere Had it not been for a tame raven I make no doubt but it would have been now living who one day seeing it at the mouth of its hole pulled it out and although I rescued it pulled out one eye and hurt it so that notwithstanding its living a twelvemonth it never enjoyed itself and had a difficulty of taking its food missing the mark for want of its eye before that accident had all the appearance of perfect health  What Mr  Pitfield  communicated to me serves farther to evince the patient and pacific disposition of this poor animal If I am thought to dwell too long on the subject let it be considered that those who have most unprovoked enemies and fewest friends clame the greatest pity and warmest vindication This reptile has undergone all sorts of scandal one author makes it the companion of an atheist  A great toad was said to have been found in the lodgings of  Vanini  at  Toulouse Vide Johnson  's Shakespear  and  Milton  Paradise lost  makes the devil itself  its inmate in a word all kind of evil passions have been bestowed on it It is but justice therefore to say something in behalf of an animal that has of late had so many tryals of its temper from experiments occasioned by the new discovery of its cancersucking qualities It has born all the handling teizing bagging c c without the lest sign of a vindictive disposition but has even made itself a sacrifice to the discharge of its office this I know from the result of much enquiry would I could contradict what is asserted p of the inefficacy of the tryals made of them in the most horrible of diseases for at this time I myself cannot bring one proof of the success But I would not have any one discouraged from the pursuit of the remedy Heaven opens to us gradually its favors the  loadstone  was for ages a meer matter of ignorant amaze at its attractive qualities  mercury  was a supposed poison and the terror of physicians we now wonder at the powers of electricity and are still but partially acquainted with its uses the toad the object of horror even in the most enlightened times is found to be perfectly innocent it has certainly contributed to the ease and as has been said to the  cure of the unhappy cancered let the following facts speak for themselves they come from persons of undoubted veracity and will sufficiently establish the truth of the beneficent qualities of this animal  The first paper relating to it is very ingeniously draw up by Mr  Pitfield  for the information of Doctor  Littleton  Bishop of  Carlisle  now happy who immediately honored me with the copy  Exon Aug    Your lordship must have taken notice of a paragraph in the papers with regard to the application of toads to a cancered breast A patient of mine has sent to the neighborhood of  Hungerford  and brought down the very woman on whom the cure was done I have with all the attention I am capable of attended the operation for eighteen or twenty days and am surprized at the phaenomenon I am in no expectation of any great service from the application the age constitution and thoroughly cancerous condition of the person being unconquerable barriers to it How an ail of that kind absolutely local in an otherwise sound habit and of a  likely age might be relieved I cannot say But as to the operation thus much I can assert that there is neither pain nor nauseousness in it The animal is put into a linen bag all but its head and that is held to the part It has generally instantly laid hold of the foulest part of the sore and sucked with greediness until it dropped off dead It has frequently happened that the creature has swolen immensely and from its agonies appeared to be in great pain I have weighed them for several days together before and after the application and found their increase of weight in the different degrees from a drachm to near an ounce They frequently sweat exceedingly and turn quite pale sometimes they disgorge recover and become lively again I think the whole scene is surprising and a very remarkable piece of natural history From the constant inoffensiveness which I have observed in them I almost question the truth of their poisonous spitting Many people here expect no great good from the application of toads to cancers and where the disorder is not absolutely local none is to be expected  where it is and seated in any part not to be well come at for extirpation I think it is hardly to be imagined but that the having it sucked clean as often as you please must give great relief Every body knows that dogs licking of sores cures them which is I suppose chiefly by keeping them clean If there is any credit to be given to history poisons have been sucked out  Pallentia Vulnera lambit Ore Venera trahens  are the words of  Lucan  on the occasion if the people to whom these words are applied did their cure by immediately following the injection of the poison the local confinement of another poison brings the case to a great degree of similarity  I hope I have not tired your lordship with my long tale as it is a true one and in my apprehension a curious piece of natural history I could not forbear communicating it to you I own I thought the story in the papers to be an invention and when I  considered the instinctive principle in all animals of self preservation I was confirmed in my disbelief but what I have related I saw and all theory must yield to fact It is only the  Rubeta  the land toad which has the property of sucking I cannot find any the lest mention of the property in any one of the old naturalists My patient can bear to have but one applied in twentyfour hours the woman who was cured had them on day and night without intermission for five weeks Their time of hanging at the breast has been from one to six hours  The other account is of a woman now under the experiment which I give as delivered to me from undoubted authority If the event is prosperous an early opportunity shall be taken of informing the public of it in some of the newspapers with all circumstances of place name c which at present it is needless to mention  About six years ago a poor woman received a crush on her breast by the fall of a pail a cancerous complaint was the result  Last year her disorder increased to an alarming degree she had five wounds on her breasts one exceeding large from which fragments of bone worked out giving her vast pain and at the same time there was a great discharge of thin yellow matter she was likewise reduced to a meer skeleton  All her left side and stomach was much swelled her fingers doughy and discolored  On the th of  September  the first toad was applied between that and the th she used seven and had that night better rest She swallowed with greater ease for before that time there was some appearance of humor in her neck and a difficulty of getting any thing down  October  th the patient better It was thought proper as winter was coming on and of course it would be very difficult to procure a number of toads to apply more at a time so three were put on at once the swelling in the arm abated and the woman's rest was good  During these tryals she took an infusion of  Water Parsnep  with  Pulvis Cornacchini  December  th continued to look ill but finds herself better two of the wounds were now healed  She was always most easy when the toads were sucking of which she killed vast numbers in the operation  January  The last account that was received informing that the patient was better  The remarks made on the animals are these Some toads died very soon after they had sucked others lived about a quarter of an hour but some lived much longer for example one that was applied about seven o'clock sucked till ten and died as soon as it was taken from the breast another that immediately succeeded continued till three o'clock but dropped dead from the wound each swelled exceedingly and turned of a pale color  These toads did not seem to suck greedily and would often turn their heads away but during the time of sucking were heard to smack their lips like a young child  As those reptiles are apt by their struggles to get out of the bag the open end ought to be made with an open hem that the string may run the  more readily and fasten tightly about the neck  It would be improper to quit the subject without mentioning the origin of this strange discovery which was owing to a woman near  Hungerford  who labored under a cancerous complaint in her breast which had long baffled all applications  The account she gives of the manner in which she came by her knowlege is very singular and I may say apocryphal She says of herself that in the height of her disorder she went to some church where there was a vast crowd on going into a pew she was accosted by a strange clergyman who after expressing compassion for her situation told her that if she would make such an application of living toads  I have been told that she not only made use of living toads but permitted the dead ones to remain at her breast by way of cataplasms for some weeks  as abovementioned she would be well  This dark story is all we can collect relating to the affair It is our opinion that she stumbled upon the discovery by accident and that having set up for a cancer doctress she thought it necessary to amuse the world with  this mysterious relation  Mr  Valentine Greatraks  who about the year persuaded himself that he could cure diseases by stroking them out of the parts affected with his hand and the famous  Bridget Bostock  of  Cheshire  who worked cures by virtue of her fasting spittle both came by their art in a manner supernatural but by  faith many were made whole  For it seems very unaccountable that this unknown gentleman should express so much tenderness for this single sufferer and not feel any for the many thousands that daily languish under this terrible disorder would he not have made use of this invaluable nostrum for his own emolument or at lest by some other means have found a method of making it public for the good of mankind  Here I take leave of the subject which I could not do without expressing my doubts as to the method of the woman's obtaining her information but in respect to the authenticity of this newdiscovered property of the toad facts establish it beyond dispute Let the humane wish for speedy proofs of the efficacy and for the satisfaction of the world let those who are capable of giving indisputable proofs of the success take the earliest opportunity of making the public acquainted with so interesting an affair  Keysler  Viper    vol  III relates that Sir  Kenelm Digby  used to feed his wife who was a most beautiful woman with capons fattened with the flesh of vipets  The traveller does not quote his authority but the lady did not long survive this strange regimen  In  Sueden  is a small reddish serpent  Blind worm    called there the  Asping  the  Coluber Chersea  of  Linnoeus  it is small and of a reddish color and its bite is said to be mortal  May it not have been from a serpent of this species that the man in  Oxfordshire  received his death  This reminds me of another  Welch  word that is explanatory of the customs of the antients  Glain Neidr    shewing their intent in the use of the plant  Vervaine  in their lustrations and why it was called by  Dioscorides Hierobotane  or the sacred plant and esteemed proper to be hung up in their rooms  The  British  name  Cas gan Cythrawl  or the Devil's aversion may be a modern appellation but is likewise called  Y Dderwen fendigaid  the holy oak which evidently refers to the  Druids  groves  Pliny  informs us that the  Gauls  used it in their incantations as the  Romans  and  Greeks  did in their lustrations  Terence  in his  Andria  shews us the  Verbena  was placed on altars before the doors of private houses in  Athens  and from the same passage in  Pliny  Lib  xxv  cap    we find the  Magi  were guilty of the most extravagant superstition about this herb Strange it is that such a veneration should arise for a plant endued with no perceptible qualities and stranger still it should spread from the farthest north to the boundaries of  India  So general a consent however proves the custom arose before the different nations had lost all communication with each other  This species  Basking Shark    on comparing a rude sketch of one taken in the  Caernarvonshire  seas with an engraving of the  Squalus Maximus  in Bishop  Gunner  's  Acta Nidrosiana  we find them to be the same and that it has a small anal fin which probably was overlooked by the  Welch  fishermen  The mouth of the sturgeon when dead is always open  Sturgeon    when alive it can  close or open it at pleasure by means of certain muscles which also assist it in protruding or drawing it in  Pliny  speaking of his  Acipenser  makes it synonymous with the  Elops Quidam eum  ELOPEM  vocant  This is a kind of  Wrasse  Vide
