 Captain  TOM's  Remembrance to his Old Friends the MOBB of  London Westminster Southwark  and  Wapping  Gentlemen  FOR so I love still to call you on the Score of old Acquaintance and Friendship I take this occasion to wish you Joy on the happy Deliverance of our good Queen from the bloody Design of the Popish Assassin Count  Guiscard  and on your own Escape at the same time from being dragoon'd into Popery and Slavery and becoming Hewers of Wood and Drawers of Water to the  French  King and his JournyMan the Pretender For cou'd his Unchristian Majesty have once got the Collar on your Necks and saddled you with the St  Germain  's Yonker pray think what a whipping Bill of Charges he'd have brought in for nursing boarding and tutoring that Babe of Grace He has no Conscience you know in his Demands and a Child so dutifully bred up as that is wou'd not have had the Boldness to higgle with his FosterFather and make him abate No he would have paid him to the full and you must have found wherewithal to quit the Reckoning And so your selves and your Sons must have been chain'd to the Oar and turn'd Swabbers under  French  Boatswains or been transported into Foreign Countries to have had your Brains knock'd out in the  French  King's Quarrel to make him Monarch of all  Europe  And your Wives and Daughters must some of 'em have been common Strumpets to an Outlandish Jacobite Army and others the handsomest of 'em have been mew'd up in Nunnerys for the Use of Priests and Fryars  Instead of substantial Beef and Pudding your Stomachs wou'd have been taken down with brown husky Bread and Herbs and RotgutSoop And for Sunday Apparel you must have been content with coarse tatter'd Jackets Canvass Shirts and Wooden Shoes Thus my Boys you had for ever lost all the Pleasures of  Easter Whitsontide  and  Christmas  No more Holyday Clothes no more Cakes and Ale no more Beans and Bacon in the Summer no more PlumPorridge MincePyes and roasted SirLoins in the Winter  Instead of being eas'd of Taxes the Nation must have been drain'd to satisfy the  French  King for the Expences of the War And this wou'd have been skrew'd up to One Hundred and Fifty Millions at least besides the Charge of keeping a Standing Army at home and Troops abroad to help him to ruin the Allies All this Mony you may be sure cou'd never be rais'd without selling the Land and the Stock and Shipping of  Great Britain  And then what wou'd you have done for Imployment to get your Living  The Popish Gimcracks and Idolatry must have been set up in your Churches your Benefices have been given to  Romish  Priests and the Chief of our Protestant Lords Gentlemen and Clergy must have been murder'd in their Houses butcher'd in the Streets or pil'd up in  Smithfield  Bonfires and you must have carry'd Faggots to the Flames or have been fry'd your selves  For 'tis impossible the  French  and their St  Germain  's Nursling and Popery and Slavery shou'd be establish'd in this Island without making a Wilderness of our Country a Sacrifice of our Persons and a Seizure of our Estates  Don't think  Gentlemen  I carry things too far here Consider how the  French  King has laid waste his own Country in order to establish  Arbitrary Power  and  Romish Bigotry  in it Call to mind how many Massacres the Papists have made in  France  since the Reformation how many hundred thousands of his own Protestant Subjects that King has destroy'd by Sword Jails Galleys and Banishment And can you imagine that He and the Pretender wou'd use  British  Protestants better Consider how many Protestant Countrys he has ruin'd in  Germany  and forc'd the Inhabitants to beg their Bread in other Lands and do you believe he wou'd be more favourable to  GreatBritain  which has been the chief Hindrance of his becoming  Æ²niversal Monarch  Call to mind how the late King  James  cut off your Noble Patriots under the Notion of Plotters how he sent your Bishops to the Tower fill'd your Armys Universitys and Councils with Papists and set up a  High Commission Court  to turn out the best of your Clergy Remember how he design'd to govern you with a Standing Army and impose a ShamSuccessor on you to make  Popery  and  Slavery  perpetual How did you bless the Day when our late Glorious Deliverer the Prince of  Orange  arriv'd to rescue you from all these Miserys Did not your Hearts o'erflow with Joy And did not you shout him to Town with loud Acclamations as the Saviour under GOD of our Church and State Did not you then take Heart of Grace and under my Conduct rout the  Monks  and  Priests  frighten the Standing Army of the  Popish  King and force him and his  Irish  Teagues to scamper Did we not on all Occasions stand by the Revolution Heart and Hand in which we and our Brethren all over the Kingdom had so great a Share And yet to see the Impudence of a late  Gallimaufry  of mercenary Tatterdemalions they wou'd fain top it on the World that forsooth this same freeborn Mob of  GreatBritain  had forsworn their Principles turn'd Tail and become arrant Enemys to the Revolution and to the Memory of the Glorious Prince who was the Instrument of it and had run in with a Herd of  Jacobites  and  Papists  to raise Tumults and Rebellions  But to prevent your being gull'd with any FlamStorys they may buz in your Ears pray consider  Gentlemen  if  Guiscard  and his Fellow Bravo's had carry'd their Point to murder the Queen and your best Patriots and to fire the City what Havock the Pretender and the D of  Berwick  wou'd have made among you with their  French Irish  and  Popish  Cutthroats while we had no Army to oppose them nor any Protestant Prince to make Head against them  Gentlemen  I hope these things have open'd your Eyes and brought you to your Senses and that you are convinc'd of the Errors some of your Number have been drawn into and of the Knavery of those who misled them and began to act the Tragedy last Winter that was to have been concluded in this Attend therefore to the Advice of your old Captain who exhorts you to continue faithful in the Duty you owe to your Queen and Country to the Protestant Succession to your Religion and Liberty and to your Selves and Families as becomes true  Britains  and to be ever ready to defend all these against  Papists  and  Jacobites  who are still brewing their Plots and endeavouring to disgrace and ruin the Authentick Mob of  Great Britain  by false spurious AntiMobs of their own Cast But I am confident you understand your selves better than to be thus deceiv'd and that you will take Care not to forfeit your former Honour and the Favour of your old trusty Leader  TOM
