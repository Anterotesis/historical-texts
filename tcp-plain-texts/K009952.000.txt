 AGIS A TRAGEDY  As it is acted at the THEATREROYAL IN DRURYLANE  LONDON Printed for A MILLAR in the Strand  MDCCLVIII  Price One Shilling and Sixpence  PROLOGUE  Written by  Spoken by Mr GARRICK  IF in these days of luxury and case  A tale from Sparta's rigid state can please  If patriot plans a British breast can warm  If Kings asserting liberty can charm  If Virtue still a grateful aspect wear  Check not at Agis' fall the gen'rous tear  He view'd his subjects with a parent's love  With zeal to save a sinking people strove  Strove their chang'd hearts with glory to inflame  To mend their Morals and restore their name  Till Faction rose with Murder at her side  Then mourn'd his country persever'd and died  That country once for virtue was rever'd  Admir'd by Greece by haughty Asia fear'd  Then Citizens and Soldiers were the same  And soldiers heroes for their wealth was fame  Then for the Brave the Fair reserv'd her charms  And scorn'd to clasp a toward in her arms  The trumpet call'd she seiz'd the sword and shield  Array'd in haste her husband for the field  And sighing whisper'd in a fond embrace  "Rememberdeath is better than disgrace  The widow'd Mother shew'd her parting son  The race of glory which his sire had run  "My son thy fight alone I shall deplore  "Return victoriousor return no more"  While Beauty thus with patriot zeal combin'd  And round the laurel'd head her myrtle twin'd  Whilst all confest the Virtuous were the Great  Fame Valor Conquest grac'd the Spartan state  Her Pow'r congenial with her Virtue grew  And freedom's Banner o'er her Phalanx flew  But soon as Virtue dropt her sick'ning head  Fame Valor Conquest Pow'r and Freedom fled  May this sad scene improve each Briton's heart  Rouse him with warmth to act a Briton's part  Prompt him with Sparta's noblest sons to vie  To live in glory and in freedom die  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  AGIS King of Sparta  Mr MOSSOP  Spartans  LYSANDER  Mr GARRICK  AMPHARES  Mr HAVARD  Thracians  RHESUS  Mr HOLLAND  EUXUS  Mr DAVIES  WOMEN  AGESISTRATA Mother of AGIS  Mrs PRITCHARD  SANDANE Queen to LEONIDAS the exil'd King  Mrs YATES  EUANTHE an Athenian Lady  Mrs CIBBER  Senators Ephori Messengers  AGIS A TRAGEDY  ACT I SCENE I  A court and hall common to the palaces of the kings of  SPARTA  Enter  SANDANE  attended  HASTEN ORONTES to the senate house  And learn if rumor's voice has spoke the truth  Exit Attendant  The adverse fortune of an exil'd king  Pursues my lord Achaia's generous aid  Sustains his cause in vain Why risk a battle  When the continuance of defensive war  Secur'd success and victory in Sparta  Would I had never left thy splendid court  Delightful Sardis to be Sparta's queen  Enter  AMPHARES  Welcome AMPHARES Have the armies met  AMPHARES  They have This morning at the break of day  The Spartan army charged Achaia's host  This and no more is known Suspense and fear  Possess the people to the gates they run  Then to their houses the still whisper spreads  Thro' justling multitudes the dread alarm  SANDANE  Alas revenge and empire now depend  On the wild issue of unruly war  What if the arms of AGIS should prevail  AMPHARES  Although he should the toils of fate surround him  Dauntless and firm our brave associates stand  And with impatience wait the destin'd hour  To rush on AGIS This unlook'dfor battle  Is but a solemn prelude to the act  Which bold conspiracy will soon perform  This day shall terminate the reign of AGIS  And make O Queen all power in Sparta thine  SANDANE  I see that danger only whets the brave  But yet AMPHARES if my lord is vanquish'd  Will not the conquering army awe the city  AMPHARES  AGIS shall be the surety of our cause  And hostage for our safety till we wrest  The sword from proud LYSANDER if he conquers  But that I fear not much New to command  From idle Athens the mock hero comes  Starts up a soldier and a statesman too  Each palm he claims All honours must adorn  The chosen friend of visionary AGIS  SANDANE  May Mars direct him so to guide the war  As AGIS rules the state And mutiny  Prove there as fatal as sedition here  AMPHARES  This factious state must change its feeble form  Waver no more beneath a double reign  Of limited contending useless kings  Henceforth our monarch shall in Sparta rule  As Jove alone in high Olympus reigns  SANDANE  S  reign the mighty monarchs of the East  And such imperial power I thought belong'd  To Sparta's king else I had ne'er been queen  Young and deceiv'd I left my father's court  For Lacedaemon's miserable sceptre  I did endeavour to extend its sway  And to ambition rous'd my Spartan lord  But the vain pupil of the Grecian schools  Unprincely AGIS marr'd the brave design  Chief of the multitude idol and slave  Of the base populace he led the herd  He urged their brutal fury on the king  AMPHARES  And now their fury on himself recoils  Like the unruly elephant they turn  And trample down the ranks in which they fought  SANDANE  That is their Liberty  AMPHARES  Let us employ  And then suppress such formidable licence  My magistracy now is near expir'd  A king's resentment and a rival's hate  Have long hung over my devoted head  Farewel to place to dignity and power  Whilst haughty AGIS fills the Spartan throne  I will not live obscure in Lacedaemon  Nor roam thro' Grecian states a banish'd man  If I must set to rise and shine no more  A fiery track shall mark my setting sun  But AGIS comes  SANDANE  And AGESISTRATA  Farewel Success attend thee brave AMPHARES  I will not stay My soul disdains to hide  Its hatred or its scorn  Exit  SANDANE  AMPHARES  Yet they who mean  To gratify these passions must conceal them  This day decides my fate So let it be  Such brief conclusion have I ever lov'd  Assist me Hermes God of stratagem  With artful words to sooth the mind of AGIS  And turn him from the track my purpose holds  Enter  AGIS  and  AGESISTRATA  AGESISTRATA  Alas my son that bold bad man I dread  AGIS  He seems to wait us At this hour AMPHARES  I think that thou of all men shou'dst have shunn'd me  AMPHARES  My motive in attending here your presence  Merits a less injurious salutation  AGIS  I know thy merits and I will reward them  Art thou not author of the woes of Sparta  Prime mover and inflamer of sedition  Hast thou not bent the power of thy high office  To the subversion of the state thou serv'st  At thee this day my indignation burns  I am dishonour'd  AMPHARES  What has dishonour'd thee  AGIS  Thou and thy practices they have compell'd me  To leave the noblest station of a prince  In time of war where should a king be found  But at his army's head There AGIS stood  When you and your presumptuous Ephori  Required my presence here Ungrateful Spartans  Had you allow'd me but one other day  Then had I fought this battle for my country  And died or conquer'd with her bravest sons  AGESISTRATA  Peril my son dwells not in camps alone  In cities palaces and courts of justice  With treachery and treason she inhabits  Peril attended thus thou must encounter  More hideous sure than in the ranks of war  AMPHARES  I know my actions have incens'd the king  But I imagin'd not that such suspicions  Found entertainment in your royal breasts  AGIS  Hast thou not join'd the enemies of AGIS  Thou who wast once his friend inconstant man  AMPHARES  I have oppos'd the counsel of a foe  Whose arts depriv'd me of my prince's favour  AGIS  Thou hast oppos'd LYCURGUS and the laws  Which rais'd the name of Sparta to the skies  The Delphic God inspir'd the deep design  For more than human was that power of thought  Which join'd the public to the private good  With such perfection that each selfish passion  Flow'd in the channel of the common welfare  And like one family of sons and sires  And dearest brothers a great people liv'd  In peace they liv'd without or strife or scorn  In war they fought to conquer or to die  Equal and free our happy fathers knew  No interest but the interest of the state  No gain but Sparta's glory proud they bore  That palm aloft and shar'd the high respect  The admiration which consenting Greece  Paid to th' imperial virtue of their country  AMPHARES  Revolving time that system overthrew  And chang'd the manners and the laws of Sparta  AGIS  The laws have been neglected not annull'd  And corrupt rulers have corrupted manners  Authority will soon revive the laws  And great example yet restore the manners  In spite of those who have oppress'd their country  Depriv'd the people of their antient rights  And while the nation sunk beneath their sway  Still strove for power in a declining kingdom  Still sought for wealth in an impoverish'd land  Even at this hour rapacious they persist  And like some wretches in a stranded vessel  Plunder and riot in the midst of ruin  AMPHARES  Mov'd by the present perils of the state  This signal hour I chose unknown as yet  The fortune of the field to change my conduct  And make an offer of my aid to AGIS  AGIS  If I should judge the future by the past  Thou must forgive me tho' I doubt thy faith  AGESISTRATA  Yet hear him AGIS in an hour like this  He who assistance offers is a friend  AGIS  This hour may yet deceive their country's foes  I know the base foundation of that hope  Which makes my baffled enemies presume  LYSANDER's army in its ranks contains  The best and bravest of Laconia's sons  The faction wish and hope defeat to them  That Sparta's generous youth may ne'er return  To guard that freedom which has made them brave  AMPHARES  The boldness of their hopes their deeds will prove  In the assembly if Achaia conquer  AGESISTRATA  AMPHARES say what is their utmost aim  AMPHARES  The old dependants of the exil'd king  And all the venal members of the state  Won by SANDANE's arts and foreign gold  Aim to restore LEONIDAS who comes  With hostile armies to enslave his country  Therefore SANDANE's proffers I rejected  Have warn'd the king and would have serv'd him too  But since resentment and distrust prevent me  Neutral I stand and will not seek that welcome  Which his more artful enemies would give  AGIS  Thou speak'st more boldly than becomes AMPHARES  Add that to the offences I forgive  It is the sacred maxim of my reign  That in a prince's consecrated breast  Revenge and anger should not long remain  These passions in a king afflict the state  By driving rash offenders to despair  This day decides your character with me  Now let your actions prove your words sincere  AMPHARES  No other terms I ask and sure I am  Ne'er shall AMPHARES need again forgiveness  Exit  AMPHARES  Manent  AGIS  and  AGESISTRATA  AGIS  Well has he judg'd the season of submission  He will assist us if LYSANDER conquers  AGESISTRATA  May Jove avert the evils which I fear  I dread the ruin of the Spartan state  And fear the downfal of our antient house  The blackest fury of the Stygian realm  The most destructive is infernal Discord  Bath'd in the blood of kings she walks this world  And tumbles states and empires to the ground  AGIS  Nations oft perish by their princes crime  But now if Sparta's antient state must fall  Gods and good men shall witness for its king  That he with fate contended for his people  And on the ruins of their virtue sell  AGESISTRATA  Think not I mean to blame your high design  Age has not chang'd the tenor of my mind  Nor pall'd my admiration of true glory  Sprung like thy father from Alcides' blood  I feel the spirit of the Spartan line  Only let me adjure thee to beware  And walk with caution thro' surrounding perils  Tho' thou despisest every form of danger  Think what a helpless train attends on thee  An aged mother and an infant son  AGIS  Divine Alcides will protect his race  AGESISTRATA  I will invoke the God in times like these  Prayers are the arms of our defenceless sex  A spotless choir of matrons and of virgins  Who o'er their country mourn myself will lead  To the high temple of the son of Jove  He yet may hear the voice of supplication  And stretch his arm to save the Spartan state  Exit  AGESISTRATA  AGIS  alone  Without the enemy within the faction  What shou'd I think I have a thousand thoughts  That rise and fall like waves upon the shore  I need thee now LYSANDER O my friend  I lean on thee and thou perhaps art fall'n  Ye everliving gods who know my heart  I trust in you for righteous are my thoughts  All bent on raising up longprostrate Sparta  With Sparta too I would be proud to rise  And gain such glory as my fathers gain'd  When Persia's tyrant trembled at their arms  If in this just ambition I should perish  My name shall go to nations yet unborn  But I must change my strain EUANTHE comes  Alas LYSANDER led by love and thee  She left her Athens for this land of broils  Enter  EUANTHE  EUANTHE  No tidings from the camp  AGIS  None fair EUANTHE  If we had lost the field the flying rout  Ere this had reach'd our gates  EUANTHE  Oh many a dame  Matron and virgin tremble at this hour  But who has cause like mine The most forlorn  And desolate of women is EUANTHE  If  AGIS  Small the chance of what EUANTHE fears  In the long wars of stillcontending Greece  Leaders of armies have but rarely fallen  EUANTHE  One thing I know and with prophetic tongue  I speak it Prince if Sparta triumph not  Ne'er shall your eyes again behold LYSANDER  Disdain in him is fatal as despair  AGIS  When he returns victorious from the field  Then shall he hear who best has spoke his praise  But I must leave you now The senate waits me  Hereafter we shall speak of this and smile  Like mariners who on the peaceful shore  Sit and with pleasure talk of tempests past  Exit  AGIS  EUANTHE  alone  This stedfast ease is all assum'd I see  He staggers at the imminent event  How dreadful is this interval to me  Who am bereft and destitute of all  Those aids that stay affliction and must bear  The weight of woe that's heavier every hour  The queen and generous AGIS too discharge  The dues of kindred with unfeigned love  But our acquaintance is not old enough  To yield a ripen'd sympathy whose taste  Alone can comfort such a mind as mine  Yet I repent me not in this extreme  That I forsook my country and my friends  They would have forc'd me to a loathed bed  And torn me from the noblest of mankind  If he should fall my love my only love  Shall I survive thee and return to Athens  Be humbled there before my haughty kindred  And hear them blame the ashes of LYSANDER  Forbid it fearless love forbid it shame  Forbid it honour and my nature's pride  Death shall forbid it for I dare to die  Enter  RHESUS  EUANTHE  RHESUS Great Gods Oh say how fares LYSANDER  RHESUS  As well as glorious victory can make him  EUANTHE  Forgive my rash despair my thanks accept  Ye gracious powers who guard his daring breast  Where is he now  RHESUS  With AGIS in the senate  EUANTHE  Already here blest be the Gods of Greece  RHESUS  Soon as the trumpet from pursuit recall'd  Our conquering Spartans in the field arriv'd  A weary messenger by AGIS sent  LYSANDER strait bespoke the royal band  "With all the speed of men to Sparta haste  "Chastise bold treason and defend your king"  He said and call'd to me With a few horse  I follow'd him And when he sought the king  By his command to you I brought these tidings  EUANTHE  Most welcome RHESUS But has Sparta lost  None of her noble youth  RHESUS  No man of note  Fell in the field but one whose loss you'll mourn  LYSANDER's friend Athenian POLYDORUS  EUANTHE  Alas alas my joy is mix'd with woe  Unhappy youth on my illomen'd head  The blame of thy untimely death will fall  Conducting me thou cam'st to distant Sparta  Fatal the honours Sparta's king bestow'd  Upon the generous guardian of EUANTHE  RHESUS  Lady the people of my native land  The warlike Thracians hold it vain to mourn  For men who fall in battle such they deem  The favourites of MARS our country's God  Those they bewail who die by dire disease  Of youth and vigor full But most of all  Lament old men who drink the bitter dregs  Of life and woe and in decrepit age  Extremity of dotage wish to live  EUANTHE  Who are those men who near the temple stand  Uncouth to me their garb and strange their arms  RHESUS  They are Thracians lady  EUANTHE  What seek they here  RHESUS  I will accost the herald  And learn his business  EUANTHE  To the palace RHESUS  I go the willing messenger of joy  This victory will free the anxious Queen  From many fears I pray thee do not tarry  But come and tell me what yon herald bears  And what affairs still occupy the senate  RHESUS  Depend on the unwearied zeal of RHESUS  Exit  RHESUS  Manet  EUANTHE  AGIS and Sparta and the public cares  Detain LYSANDER from my longing eyes  I see the happy change of my condition  And share the triumphs of the man I love  But yet the slightest circumstance creates  New fears to me Why lingers thus LYSANDER  My mind is not at rest the winds are hush'd  But still my bosom quivers from the storm  Exit  EUANTHE  End of the first Act  ACT II SCENE I  EUANTHE  THEIR tedious council now is at an end  And surely he will hasten to EUANTHE  What means this clamour  Shout of the People behind the Scenes  Ha he comes he comes  Loud acclamations and the voice of joy  Proclaim the hero  Enter  LYSANDER  LYSANDER  O my life my love  To meet thee here is happiness compleat  The Gods have blest me to my utmost wish  And brought me full of glory to EUANTHE  EUANTHE  Thanks to the Gods who have preserv'd LYSANDER  Athenian Pallas sure has heard my prayers  LYSANDER  And mine for mutual is the lover's prayer  Another deity I now invoke  Whose rites the god of war has long delay'd  With peace wellpleas'd shall golden Hymen come  And crown at last our long eventful love  EUANTHE  Speak not of Hymen now his torch for me  He shall not light whilst cruel Discord waves  Her horrid brand and whilst unburied lies  Thy friend and mine the generous POLYDORUS  LYSANDER  Tho' love and glory both my breast inspire  And fortune smiles on both yet sorrow finds  A place to sit in but 'tis temper'd sorrow  For never Grecian hero greater died  EUANTHE  He fell the victim of his love to thee  He follow'd thee when thou forsook'st EUANTHE  Left me the day I touch'd the Spartan shore  Tho' royal AGIS begg'd thee to remain  LYSANDER  Unjust EUANTHE thus to blame LYSANDER  Who sought the field the soldier of his love  As of his sacred country fought to gain  With liberty a rank and place of honour  Such as becomes the husband of EUANTHE  That tender name and names that wait upon it  Awake emotions as implacable  To tyranny as generous and great  As ever selfrenouncing hero own'd  When the chief aim is right all passions else  Of noble kind impell the selfsame way  The lover and the husband rouse and fire  The Spartan and the man  Of common clay and in one common mould  Mankind are made but the celestial fire  That gives them life and soul is liberty  And I Prometheus like to gain that fire  For Sparta's sons would brave the bolt of Jove  EUANTHE  To me you need not vaunt your daring mind  Alas LYSANDER I am still afraid  Of perils lurking in this troubled state  O leave me not again to grief and fear  And to AMPHARIS  LYSANDER  Leave thee to AMPHARES  EUANTHE  Yes in thy absence he did talk of love  Boasted his wealth his clients and his power  Mention'd the ruin of thy father's fortunes  And spoke contemptuous of thy rash designs  LYSANDER  Immortal gods Did I not hate this man  Enough  Enter a  HELOT  Whence HELOT  HELOT  Lord from Celimene  Delivers a Letter  LYSANDER  reads  Let  AGIS  stand upon his guard to day  This to  LYSANDER  from a faithful friend  Helot return and tell the noble dame  That the remembrance of her generous mind  Shall live for ever in my grateful breast  EUANTHE  Who is this faithful friend  LYSANDER  A Spartan dame  A gentle one tho' wedded to a foe  Of royal AGIS In her virgin state  She was the constant and the lov'd companion  Of fair DEIDAMIA AGIS' shortliv'd queen  Thro' all our various strife the generous dame  Preserves the friendships of her early days  This scroll the king must see Farewel EUANTHE  EUANTHE  Its threatning strain awakes my former fears  Would you had been like me content with love  And never left Illyssus' flowery banks  A fairer garland there you might have won  Than ever war bestow'd th' immortal wreath  Of PALLAS queen of arts as well as arms  But you forsook the vale and left the shade  To climb ambition's bare and rocky height  To stand the storms and tempests of the world  LYSANDER  Your words like melancholy music take  My list'ning ear and cause delusive sadness  For vain the malice of our baffled foes  And impotent will prove their last endeavours  Past are the storms and tempests of our fortune  Let not EUANTHE heed the rack of clouds  Nor dread the murmurs of the falling main  EUANTHE  Elate with victory you scorn your foes  I wish that RHESUS would return again  Before you go to AGIS  LYSANDER  Where is RHESUS  EUANTHE  I saw some warriors clad in horrid arms  Near yonder temple stand Strait RHESUS knew  The garb and arms of his own native Thrace  And wond'ring at the sight went forth to learn  Who and from whence they were  LYSANDER  That should be known  In yonder temple sit the Ephori  Those factious magistrates who love not AGIS  If RHESUS come to you detain him not  Our resolutions may on him depend  EUANTHE  LYSANDER stay you go again to AGIS  Perhaps to plan new perils to thy life  If so by all that's sacred I conjure thee  To let me know your purpose Speak with me  Before you execute what you resolve  The image of the stern AMPHARES haunts me  Need I entreat thee to defend me from him  LYSANDER  No by the Gods O urge me not EUANTHE  Nor rouse those thoughts a lover cannot bear  Defend thee from AMPHARES O my fair  When thou art wrong'd LYSANDER lives no more  But see the king  EUANTHE  Let caution shew your love  LYSANDER  goes off towards that side of the stage where  AGIS  appears  Manet  EUANTHE  If nature teaches me aright to read  The mind of man this is a powerful spell  To charm the daring spirit of LYSANDER  And make him think of me as well as Sparta  Exit  EUANTHE  Enter  AGIS  LYSANDER  Regard O king the warnings of a friend  Instructed in the counsels of thy foes  Behold the stedfast faith of CELIMENE  Gives the letter  AGIS  I cannot think so basely of the people  For them I have unplum'd the regal power  And deck'd their freedom with the spoils of kings  If they betray me of all creatures man  Is most ungrateful to his benefactor  The generous courser and the faithful dog  With true affection love their gentle master  Nay even the heavy ox the stubborn mule  Dullest of beasts they know the hand that feeds them  LYSANDER  Humanity lives in thy breast O king  And dictates confidence unlimited  Virtue approves the generous extreme  And magnanimity this error loves  Let private men indulge the glorious fault  And set their lives and fortunes on the faith  And gratitude of those they have oblig'd  But let severer prudence guard the heart  Of him whose brows are circled with a crown  Enter an  OFFICER  OFFICER  O King the captain of Amycla's gate  Informs you that he has this hour descried  A band of men who halted near his post  A thousand Thracians they report themselves  Hir'd by AMPHARES for SELEUCUS' service  AGIS  A thousand Thracians  OFFICER  On their march to Sardis  LYSANDER  By whose permission do they march this way  OFFICER  Before the troops arriv'd a herald came  Who to the Ephori a message bore  AGIS  Your diligence in duty I commend  Exit  OFFICER  LYSANDER  The veil's withdrawn and treason stands reveal'd  Ne'er shall AMPHARES need again forgiveness  With what a double tongue the traitor spoke  Allseeing Gods how little do we know  The greatness of those blessings you confer  Had we not fought to day had we not conquer'd  AGIS and Sparta had been lost for ever  AGIS  This victory came like the bolt of Jove  And levell'd their designs  LYSANDER  Yet if they dare  The worst of crimes their treason may succeed  Your troops your conquering troops are not arriv'd  Th' assembly meets unguarded there you stand  What keeps the traitors from your noble life  AGIS  My life LYSANDER No I fear not that  The ancient annals of this land record  That barbarous foes revere the race divine  And turn in battle from a Spartan king  LYSANDER  The multitude may still revere their lord  Who from the blood of great Alcides springs  And yet some impious hand may strike the prince  Altho' of virtue as of race divine  AGIS  I'll change the guards and place at ev'ry gate  Some men of trust  LYSANDER  Mount your Thessalian steed  And meet the troops that hasten to your aid  With eager steps the royal band advance  And wish for nothing but their king to lead them  Then if the furies in their wrath provoke  Your foes to rise in arms let arms decide  Ne'er were the good and bad winnow'd so well  And sever'd from each other Such the hosts  And such will be their fate as when the rage  Of earthborn giants dar'd the sons of heaven  AGIS  Thou reason'st like an anxious friend LYSANDER  Thy fears are all for me mine for my people  Enter  RHESUS  Hail gallant RHESUS know'st thou ought of those  Thy countrymen who thus unlook'dfor come  And in a doubtful hour perplex our councils  RHESUS  The Thracians are a thousand men compleat  From snowy Hemus and the northern hills  Of wild Odrysus the fierce warriors come  RHINALCES leads them of illustrious birth  But stern imperious and grown old in arms  He knows no umpire but the sword no law  Except obedience to the prince he serves  AGIS  Such oft are those that quit a needy home  To serve as hirelings in a tyrant's host  RHESUS  Next in command my brother EUXUS stands  A Youth to MARS devoted for he loves  Danger itself not danger's rich reward  LYSANDER  Hast thou yet seen him  RHESUS  No  LYSANDER  Has he yet heard  That thou art here in Sparta  RHESUS  He believes  That I am still in Athens From the herald  I kept my name and quality conceal'd  For I suspected that these Thracian troops  Though hir'd for Asia were for Sparta meant  If it prove so I may be useful here  My valiant brother bears a generous mind  And tho' of arms enamour'd justice loves  AGIS  Haste to your valiant brother and explain  With an impartial tongue the state of Sparta  Shew him where justice and where honour stand  If these are facred as thou say'st they are  To gallant EUXUS he may prove a friend  LYSANDER  Exert the strong persuasion of a brother  And tell him RHESUS if he loves bright arms  And that immortal glory valour gains  No more to wield a mercenary sword  But plant himself with thee in Sparta's soil  Where AGIS will his noble nature cherish  And rear his courage to such lofty deeds  As antient story tells of Sparta's chiefs  Exit  RHESUS  AGIS  I hope that RHESUS will divide the Thracians  This favours well the biass of my mind  Averse to leave the city on suspicion  And drive the wavering faction to extremes  LYSANDER  O generous prince whom I admire and blame  The greatest foe the foe LYSANDER dreads  Is the unequall'd gentleness of AGIS  Review the story of the Grecian states  And mark how freedom fell in every land  The brave asserters of the public cause  Have ever been too mild in evil times  Have like indulgent parents spar'd the rod  And let the vices of their children live  To kill the virtues Hence let AGIS learn  The only lesson that his nature needs  AGIS  Uncertain is the peril if I stay  But certain is the evil if I fly  I will remain but to assure my safety  You must LYSANDER to the troops return  LYSANDER  And leave my prince alone amidst his foes  Revoke the hard command If you're resolv'd  To brave the peril then my place I claim  Next to your person by your side I stand  Perhaps some noble service I may render  Receive the mortal wound aim'd at my prince  And with my life redeem the life of AGIS  AGIS  Your great imagination's up in arms  But hear me and let calmer reason judge  I am determin'd not to quit the city  The guilt of civil war shall not be mine  LYSANDER's presence here without the troops  Would but embolden and excite my foes  Who may be tempted by this fair occasion  This mighty vantage to surprize us both  Without delay once more LYSANDER arm  And ostentatiously pass thro' the gate  This victory and the approaching host  Will hush the threatned storm  LYSANDER  So may it prove  But there is something in my heart rebels  Against this counsel Oh I cannot leave you  Nor ought I now to stay Let never man  Say in the morning that the day's his own  Things past belong to memory alone  Things future are the property of hope  The narrow line the isthmus of these seas  The instant scarce divisible is all  That mortals have to stand on O my prince  LYSANDER leaves you with a heavy heart  AGIS  Farewel thou Spartan of the antient mould  Dear as the brother of his blood to AGIS  They embrace and part  LYSANDER  LYSANDER  Ha may heaven your purpose change  AGIS  My will is fix'd But though my judgment too  Confirms the secret counsel of my heart  Yet I may be deceiv'd perhaps my friend  We part this moment ne'er to meet again  LYSANDER  Let us not part at all 'Tis inspiration  The guardian God the Demon of the mind  Thus often presses on the human breast  AGIS  Mistake me not I feel no new impression  Nor if I did should I by that be alter'd  For such presages be they sad or joyful  I deem them but the meteors of the mind  Bred by the inward elemental strife  When great events perplex and shake the soul  My thoughts regard the state If I should fall  To thee LYSANDER I commit my son  The only pledge of my DEIDAMIA's love  Train up the boy to walk in the same path  Which we have trod together the streight path  Of virtue and true glory If he proves  Of noble nature and I hope no less  He will not shun the lofty path of honour  Tho' fate should mark it with his father's blood  LYSANDER  Hear this immortal Gods who rule the world  And guard a prince the image of yourselves  O never never may his royal race  LYSANDER's aid require  Exit  LYSANDER  AGIS  alone  Affection choaks his words  His generous heart bursts at this solemn parting  In times like these of a declining state  Baseness infects the general race of men  But yet these trying times rear up a few  More excellent refin'd and conscious spirits  More principled and fit for all events  Than any in the good but equal mass  Of a far better age Such is LYSANDER  The hour draws near  Enter  SENATORS  SENATORS  Assembled Sparta waits  AGIS  I come my friends I will address the people  Proclaim aloud mine actions which upbraid  And soon shall silence my despiteful foes  My heart shall speak This sceptre of my fathers  By long descent hereditary mine  I would disdain to hold did I not hope  That by its sway I might recall those days  When Lacedaemon was the pride of Greece  The gaze and terror of the wondring world  For there as in a chosen temple dwelt  Valour and virtue whilst attending same  And glory on the land of heroes shone  First SENATOR  O Gods above How happy were our fires  In those bright days of antient glory born  AGIS  Those days shall yet return Olympian Jove  Or low in dust shall Spartan AGIS lie  Sound of musical instruments  First SENATOR  What means this musick  AGIS  To the Gods of Greece  And Sparta's guardian deities it sounds  Let us

Spartan throne  Heav'n avert the ills we fear  Jove from high Olympus hear  Priests of JUPITER  This day our foes embattled came  And vow'd to end the Spartan name  Embattled near our gates they fought  But Jove for us deliverance wrought  He smote Achaia's host with fear  He thunder'd in their trembling rear  Jove's lightning flam'd from Sparta's spear  CHORUS of Matrons and Virgins  Ever may his mighty arm  Save the Spartan state from harm  Ne'er may proud Invader boast  Glory from our glory lost  Light O Jove that sacred fire  Which did Sparta's sons inspire  When the prince and people strove  Burning with their country's love  Xerxes lord of great alarms  Xerxes rous'd the world to arms  Priests of JUPITER  The earth was troubled at his host  The springs were dried the rivers lost  But Spartan valour check'd his pride  A slender band his host defy'd  Thermopylae immortal name  Beheld the Persian tyrant's shame  CHORUS of all  There the brave three hundred dy'd  Faithful by their prince's side  There they conquer'd tho' they dy'd  Priests of HERCULES  On earth below in Heav'n above  Rever'd victorious son of Jove  Hear Alcides hear our prayer  Thy godlike offspring claims thy care  CHORUS of all  Bend thy bow Tyrinthius bend  Lightly on the earth descend  Fix an arrow on the string  Stand beside the Spartan king  AGIS of thy race divine  Tried in labours like to thine  Undaunted like thee with monsters he strives  The fiercest of Hydras in faction revives  If he falls a sacrifice  Never more shall Sparta rise  Exeunt As the procession goes off  Enter  AMPHARES  Thus may my pious foes for ever strive  Be theirs the airy aid of fabled Jove  In nearer and more certain force I trust  Of human race I fight with mortal arms  Yet prais'd be Fortune goddess of my vows  'Tis she whose happy hand leads forth these dames  Ne'er to the palace shall their steps return  The net I've spread now covers all my foes  Except LYSANDER O had he been here  Then I had stood like mighty Atlas firm  Fate but reserves him to another day  The time is almost come my Thracians now  Have reach'd their posts and many a daring eye  Looks for the signal Here it ismy sword  When I appear thus arm'd the furies rise  This is the comet the fierce blazing star  On which commotion change and death attend  Exit  AMPHARES  End of the second Act  ACT III SCENE I

lord thy friends are foes to mine  Yet thou wilt sympathize with thy own sex  And save me from the violence I fear  SANDANE  Where is thy lover to defend thee now  Where is the conquering valour of LYSANDER  And virtuous AGIS the reforming king  Whom thou wast wont to praise Let me advise thee  On brave AMPHARES try thy boasted charms  So young so fair a captive may subdue  The victor's heart  EUANTHE  Are these a woman's words  SANDANE  They are and suited to a light adventurer  Who left her parents and her native land  To seek a lover Sure her roving mind  True to its passion may the object change  And pleas'd accept AMPHARES for LYSANDER  EUANTHE  Thou speak'st thy thoughts and judgest of EUANTHE  By the deceitful standard of thy heart  Too soon thou hast betray'd thy secret soul  I am not yet a captive I may live  To shew thee Queen that pity thou deny'st me  LYSANDER comes to rescue or revenge  SANDANE  LYSANDER soon shall be as AGIS is  Thy wretched arrogance my soul contemns  An enemy I have the Spartan Queen  Whose bitter tongue has often wrong'd my fame  Her will I seek and triumph o'er the ruin  Of her and of her peace  EUANTHE  Had'st thou e'er felt  Sincere affection thou would'st not insult me  And hadst thou ever known a mother's pains  Thou could'st not bear to grieve a mother's heart  SANDANE  Minion for this expect thou pageant thou  That dar'st to brave exasperate a Queen  Thou shalt repent thy pride and kneel in vain  Exit  SANDANE  EUANTHE  The anger that supported me is gone  I feel my weakness and her threatnings fear  Enter  LYSANDER  in a  HELOT'  s garb  HELOT if pity or if gold  LYSANDER  EUANTHE  EUANTHE  O Heav'n and earth LYSANDER  LYSANDER  Yes my love  Thou see'st LYSANDER miserable man  Does AGIS live  EUANTHE  Amidst the clash of arms  And cries of fighting men I heard them shout  The name of AGIS Byandby a Spartan  Flying and wounded as he pass'd call'd out  "The king is safe the king has gain'd the temple"  LYSANDER  Then all is safe for Sparta lives in him  EUANTHE  But the good Queen  LYSANDER  Her sex her age protects her  EUANTHE  Heaven grant they may an impious band in arms  Pursu'd the holy train Fear gave me speed  For I outstript them all But now LYSANDER  Betray'd encompass'd now what shall we do  LYSANDER  Wert thou but safely plac'd LYSANDER knows  What he should do I must not tarry here  There is a temple in this spacious city  For sanctity above all others fam'd  To Juno sacred the avenging Queen  Thither a trusty slave of AGIS' house  Will guide thy steps by my command he waits  Without the palace  EUANTHE  Whither dost thou go  LYSANDER  In this inglorious garb disguis'd I wait  Till night and darkness come then I attempt  The wall where'er I find it slightly guarded  What mortal arm shall then oppose my way  Urg'd as I am Alas my lov'd EUANTHE  From my compliance with thy fond request  Springs the worst evil of this dreadful hour  I have betray'd the confidence of AGIS  But I'll repair my fault  EUANTHE  What dost thou mean  LYSANDER  AGIS commanded me to leave the city  And thinks would to the Gods he thought aright  That his LYSANDER heads the Spartan troops  In whom his only hope of safety lies  But I EUANTHE partial to thy will  Sought thee in vain In that unhappy time  They seiz'd the gates and shut me up in Sparta  Fate punishes with too severe a doom  The human weakness of indulgent love  AGIS I comeFor the deep voices now  Of duty friendship gratitude and glory  Sound thro' my breast and from my beating heart  Their echo rings Farewel my love farewel  EUANTHE  Not yet LYSANDER AGIS is opprest  And Sparta too Does duty or does honour  Require LYSANDER like an eastern slave  To fall attendant on the royal pile  What can you do The army will betray you  So with the few the faithful few that love you  You'll do some desperate action and be slain  If you despise your life yet think of me  The prey of curst AMPHARES  LYSANDER  Infernal Gods  Let me not think of that Retire EUANTHE  And in the hallow'd temple rest secure  This night I'll force ill guarded Sparta's gates  And save my prince my country and EUANTHE  EUANTHE  Thy prince thy country are already lost  O listen and preserve thyself and me  The ship that bore me to the Spartan shore  Rides still at anchor leave this wretched land  Where'er thou goest I will attend thy steps  Thy gods shall be my gods thy people mine  LYSANDER  Alas EUANTHE does not see the shame  The ruin of that counsel love inspires  Th' eternal gods repose this hour in me  No common trust Upon my deeds depend  The fate of AGIS and the fate of Sparta  My soldiers too my brave my faithful soldiers  The meanest warrior of the royal band  Freely devotes his life to godlike AGIS  And shall their leader shall the friend of AGIS  Forsake his prince I will forget thy words  Repeat them not  EUANTHE  Is this LYSANDER's love  Must I not speak Is my reward reproach  For you I left my friends and native land  Defy'd all danger and all censure scorn'd  Now in my sore distress I call on thee  For whom I suffer to protect my honour  And in my sore distress dost thou upbraid me  If ever maid like credulous EUANTHE  Bursts all the bonds of nature for one man  Let her beware that he be not a Spartan  O wretched maid O Athens lost in vain  Ready to faint  LYSANDER  Allruling powers why am I thus distrest  Why come calamities so thick upon me  EUANTHE hear me you shall be obey'd  I'll bear thee hence and go with thee to Athens  Restore thee to thy country and thy friends  Of whom thou dost complain I have bereft thee  LYSANDER will acquit himself to thee  And to mankind  EUANTHE  Delude me not Alas  Thy tongue speaks comfort but thy voice thy looks  Wild and unsettled drive me to despair  For thou methinks art desperate LYSANDER  Those lips that quiver and those eyes that roll  Like dragon's eyes those are not signs of love  Thou say'st that thou wilt bear me back to Athens  Will that acquit thee if thou leav'st me there  Is that thy purpose  LYSANDER  Yes I'll leave the world  And death shall wipe dishonour from my name  AGIS and Sparta shall forgive me then  And every debt be paid  EUANTHE  LYSANDER no  Love's victims are not of your sterner sex  It is the destiny of womankind  Constant to live and desolate to die  To strong necessity EUANTHE yields  If I should tear you from the side of AGIS  I see my fate you ne'er would love me more  Tho' you should live yet you would die to me  But I will rather stay and perish here  Than live without thee Go and fight for AGIS  But in the hour of danger think of me  Calm in the rear direct the course of battle  The dreadful van let other warriors lead  In whom nor AGIS nor EUANTHE lives  LYSANDER  These words become my idoliz'd EUANTHE  And honour now approves the voice of love  O thou first object of my young desires  And thro' each period of my ripening years  Still more maturely and intensely lov'd  Hear and believe my wordsBewareBeware  Enter  AMPHARES  To his people  'Tis she by Venus halt Fear not my fair  Nor meditate escape from your AMPHARES  EUANTHE  My AMPHARES  AMPHARES  Thine and thine

come  To take by force and violence my heart  AMPHARES  The love of thee more powerful than ambition  Inslam'd me to attempt the Spartan throne  Thy beauty is the torch that lights the war  For thee I conquerSmile not thus in scorn  Deign to accept my hand and Sparta's crown  EUANTHE  Dost thou bestow the diadem of Sparta  Where is thy lawful prince  AMPHARES  LEONIDAS  EUANTHE  AGIS  AMPHARES  That AGIS is no more a king  A suppliant surrounded by my troops  In Juno's temple with the priests he dwells  LEONIDAS by me restor'd to power  Will gladly share with me divided empire  Or if I please to reign alone I may  Thro' dark conspiracy and open strife  For thee I strove thou wilt reward my love  Beauty like thine pertains not to the vanquish'd  But still triumphant reigns the victors' queen  EUANTHE  Thinkst thou there is no truth in human breasts  No faithful loyalty no constant love  Soon shalt thou learn thine error I begin  To teach thee first Thee and thy love I scorn  And may the gods reward thy base ambition  As I reward thy love  AMPHARES  O womankind  How well your passions teach us to be just  You love LYSANDER still a little time  Will from your mind erase the memory  Of that vainglorious lost and ruin'd man  Who was my rival  EUANTHE  Was whate'er he was  He is and more Thou and thy crimes contribute  To make him more illustrious more belov'd  Thou giv'st him scope and vantage to his virtue  Speak'st thou of crowns whilst royal AGIS reigns  Of power in Sparta whilst LYSANDER lives  The short dominion of this day is thine  But vengeance and LYSANDER come tomorrow  AMPHARES  Thou do'st instruct me If my time is short  We should not part I'll see thee safely placed  Where I command  EUANTHE  I will not go with thee  AMPHARES  Yield to

That would dishonour me for ever  Advance on all sides and close in upon him  LYSANDER  Strangers give way and let the Spartan chiefs  Fight their own quarrels I will give you all  The wealth of Sparta  AMPHARES  Ha he grows upon them  Throw down year weapons or I'll pierce her heart  Points his sword to  EUANTHE'S  breast  EUXUS  Renown'd LYSANDER give thy sword to EUXUS  EUANTHE  Defend thy noble life Regard not mine  AMPHARES  lifts his arm  LYSANDER  Hold hold  AMPHARES  Thou know'st meChoose  LYSANDER  I cannot bear to see EUANTHE die  Throws down his sword  O AGIS O my prince  AMPHARES  Victorious chief  Statesman and soldier learned Athens' boast  Where are thy glories now  LYSANDER  The strife of tongues  I shun as thou didst shun the strife of arms  AMPHARES  Yet let thy haughtiness grant one request  Tell me what brought the great LYSANDER hither  Some stratagem profound which none but he  Could have contriv'd to hasten his destruction  And add disgrace and ridicule to ruin  LYSANDER  Hadst thou not fled thou coward from my sword  And shriek'd for help this arm this single arm  Had baffled all the craft of false AMPHARES  AMPHARES  This pride becomes thee and thy lost condition  LYSANDER  In this condition it becomes me best  To brave AMPHARES Had he been a captive  I should have pitied him  AMPHARES  Plead'st thou for pity  LYSANDER  For none that thou can'st give Hear me then judge  If what I speak is meant to win thy favour  I should have pitied thee by fate subdued  Opprest with crimes thy spirit would have shrunk  Under calamity and guilt have marr'd  The noble vigor and the port of manhood  Amidst thy triumph does it not confound thee  To think thou ow'st it to excess of baseness  Thou hast prevail'd because the generous AGIS  Would not believe there could be such a traitor  AMPHARES  Oft have I heard and often seen thy folly  But now to rail is madness With one word  I could impose on thee eternal silence  LYSANDER  And wouldI know theeif thou thought'st it wise  Even then as now I should contemn thy power  But know I fear thee not The king is safe  And his victorious troops at break of day  Will thunder in thine ears thou and thy band  Will ill sustain the shock of such an host  My life is in thy hands but yet beware  Thy fate depends on mine In Lacedaemon  A prince like AGIS soon will find LYSANDERS  AMPHARES  Uncertain thy predictions of the future  Small is thy prescience witness thy condition  EUXUS conduct him to you corner tower  EUANTHE  LYSANDER  LYSANDER  Oh I have withdrawn mine eyes  From thee and to contention turn'd my heart  EUANTHE  Yet look on me before we part for ever  LYSANDER  At looks or words of tenderness he'll smile  And o'er the sorrows of our love rejoice  Forgive me still I must not cannot speak  EUANTHE  But I will speak and earth and heaven shall hear me  AMPHARES too shall hear for it will gaul him  To hear EUANTHE now avow her love  And faith to her LYSANDER Powerful words  Emblems and figures of firm constancy  Such as fond lovers lavishly employ  To sooth the pangs of parting and of absence  Such music vows accord not with our state  Our dreadful state yet do not grieve thy heart  Thy noble heart too full of other sorrows  With thoughts of what may happen to EUANTHE  Nothing shall happen to debase EUANTHE  The bondage and the shame that women suffer  Who live the slave of those who slew their lords  I ne'er shall know I never will endure  If cruel destiny decrees thy fall  Unspotted to the shades I'll follow thee  For whom alone on earth I'd wish to live  LYSANDER  Lead on Farewel EUANTHE  EUANTHE  Gods above  AMPHARES  Conduct her to the tower where late you lodg'd  The captive queen  EUANTHE  Alas no guarded tower  Or vaulted dungeon ever yet contain'd  Two

Sparta  SANDANE  Yes AMPHARES  Now fortune seems to smile upon SANDANE  I saw the sullen captive led along  His gloomy eyeballs fix'd upon the earth  AMPHARES  This night O queen must see the bold conclusion  Of a design thus far so bravely borne  On hollow and deceitful ground we tread  Whilst AGIS lives  SANDANE  Thou speakst my very thoughts  Seasons there are AMPHARES which suspend  All sanctimonious reverence and respect  AMPHARES  Temples and priests and altars shall not save him  If fate should drive us to the last extreme  Meanwhile I will employ more gentle means  To gain our ends For sacrilege would rouse  The zealous multitude to rage and arms  The temple is begirt with Thracian bands  Who all access forbid and AGIS knows not  What has befallen LYSANDER I will send  A subtle Spartan in LYSANDER's name  Who may by specious arguments persuade him  To quit the sanctuary and then O queen  With all solemnity of pomp and form  Th' assembled Ephori shall pass his doom  And in the same decree include LYSANDER  SANDANE  Think'st thou the Ephori will give the sanction  Of their authority to AGIS' death  AMPHARES  They will At midnight the stern judges meet  In Terror's temple they have charg'd a herald  With orders to the troops not to advance  On pain of treason The astonish'd people  Will crouch and tremble at that awful power  Which draws the sword of justice on a king  Then shall your lord's authority revive  And like the sun when bursting from a cloud  With greater power and brighter splendor shine  Exeunt  End of the third Act  ACT IV SCENE I  LYSANDER  as a Prisoner the  Thracian  Guards at a distance  LYSANDER  musing advances and speaks  HAS virtue no prerogative on earth  And can the Gods permit the fall of AGIS  They can 'Tis man's own arrogance arrays him  In gorgeous titles of excelling nature  Care of the Gods and centre of creation  I fear I fear man's life is but a dream  His soul a subtile essence of the blood  A rainbow beauty made to shine a space  Then melt and vanish into air  Ye mighty minds of sages and of heroes  Epaminondas Plato great Lycurgus  Who once with such transcendent glory shone  Brighter than all the stars that deck the heavens  Is your celestial fire for ever quench'd  And nought but ashes left the sport of chance  Which veering winds still blow about the world  I will not think so Yet alas the while  I see and feel presages that alarm  If they prove true If man is like the leaf  Which falling from the tree revives no more  I shall be shortly dust That will not hear  EUANTHE weep nor see the shame of

thy misfortunes  Have touch'd my heart but here in trust I stand  Would I had never seen the walls of Sparta  LYSANDER  The Gods the guardian Gods of Lacedaemon  Have brought you hither to preserve a people  And save from traitors' hands the best of kings  Altho' at first you rashly drew the sword  In blind obedience to a leader's will  The gallant EUXUS will not sure persist  In error known in manifest injustice  Thy trade is war brave soldier this is not  An office for thy sword  EUXUS  True are thy words  I was indeed deceiv'd and came not here  To mix in Sparta's strife but honour now  RHESUS  I will not hear thee plead so bad a cause  Is there a bond in nature like the tie  Which binds the hearts of brothers And will EUXUS  From vain ideas of fidelity  To that detested traitor false AMPHARES  His brother murder  EUXUS  No  RHESUS  Then let thy arms  Defend LYSANDER By our country's Gods  I swear and by our warlike father's soul  Whose wellbeloved son thou ever wert  That with the Spartan chief thy brother dies  LYSANDER  Might you not favour the escape of AGIS  The guards are Thracians  EUXUS  I might favour thine  My power extends not to the guards of AGIS  RHESUS

deliberate no time is lost  The light of day suits not with your designs  Before the night comes on I will determine  LYSANDER  'Tis almost night the sun hath left the heavens  And doubtful twilight ushers in the gloom  Perhaps the enemies of AGIS wait  The darkness of the night to cover deeds  They dare not act by day This night I dread  RHESUS  The Ephori have sent a herald forth  Charg'd with some solemn menace and command  To stop the army's march  LYSANDER  If they obey  The fane of Juno guards the king no more  Eternal Gods how wretched is LYSANDER  From me that herald should have heard his answer  Cannot my RHESUS find one gallant Spartan  To bear my orders to the royal band  To storm the city  RHESUS  I myself will bear  These orders to the camp  LYSANDER  Another task  More difficult and dangerous is thine  Assume the arms and vesture of thy country  And thro' the Thracians win thy way to AGIS  RHESUS the generous spirit of that prince  Is of a nature that excludes all

Thracian  THRACIAN  The Spartan lord draws near  EUXUS  AMPHARES comes  Retire my lord whilst I advance to meet him  Our intercourse might lead him to suspicion  LYSANDER  Nor vigilance nor care I

Or whatsoe'er affinity they claim  EUXUS  That strict command hath been already given  AMPHARES  'Tis needful EUXUS for his furious mind  In this extreme will snatch at slight occasions  To make incredible and wild attempts  Renew the charge then go and search LYSANDER  For secret weapons On his breast he wears  A curious gorget rich with precious stones  And a small portrait of surpassing

Monet  AMPHARES  Let other men deprive themselves of pleasure  And toil for bare ambition I'll provide  A more luxurious banquet to my taste  What tho' as yet EUANTHE loves me not  It is the nature of her sex to change  With wondrous ease the female kind submit  To destiny and soon are reconcil'd  To persons and conditions once abhorr'd  Like birds new caught who flutter for a time  And struggle with captivity in vain  But byand by they rest they smooth their plumes  And to new masters sing their former notes  This facile temper of the beauteous sex  Great Agamemnon brave Pelides prov'd  They

sacerdotal robes  As if disguis'd t' elude the Thracian guards  Past in by my permission and conjur'd  AGIS to quit the fane's uncertain shelter  And seek the sure protection of the camp  Himself he offer'd as his faithful guide  This in LYSANDER's name AGIS at first  Irresolute and doubtful balanc'd much  At last this thought sprung up and turn'd the scale  That his escape would force us to

my lord  They have discover'd RHESUS is my brother  LYSANDER  That secret in your breast and his is lodg'd  Nor can his alter'd features now betray him  In early youth he left his native land  The heat of summer and the winter's cold  In many a hard campaign have chas'd his bloom  EUXUS  Indeed I knew him not  LYSANDER  Then who could know him  Calm and determin'd to the senate go  Here I'll remain and wait your quick return  To know what they design imports us much  EUXUS  Your stay is full of danger risk it not  LYSANDER  All necessary dangers must be risk'd  Perhaps I am the subject of their councils  Perhaps I may be call'd before the senate  If I appear not you must be discover'd  And my escape too soon to them be known  EUXUS  Your reasons are of force I am convinc'd  Here take my sword Then if we are betray'd  My troops obey you Now my bold SITHONTES  To one of his Thracians  Draw your battalion nearer to the square  And guard the person of this Spartan chief  As you would guard myself If I'm detain'd  Follow to death or victory LYSANDER  Exit  EUXUS  LYSANDER  Shall I obey the impulse of my heart  And lead these Thracians to the tower that holds  My lost EUANTHE No let reason rule  AMPHARES will not dares not wrong her honour  Whilst undecided is the fate of AGIS  'Tis night but never shall the morning rise  OnWho can know the secret will of heaven  Tell me ye inextinguishable fires  That light the counsels of eternal Jove  Have you since Time began his long career  Beheld a mortal like LYSANDER tost  Down down enthusiasm my heart be calm  A little while and thou shalt beat no more  Oft have I wish'd for perilous occasions  And wandring in the academic grove  Have rous'd myself with strong imagination  Of great exploits by ardent valour done  But ne'er did fancy's tempest match the truth  The strong reality of such a storm  O did I combat but for life alone  Were Sparta and EUANTHE safe spectators  How gaily should LYSANDER take the field  EUXUS draws nearUpon the insect wing  Of a small moment ride th' eternal fates  Enter  EUXUS  My fears were vain The secret is unknown  But RHESUS is condemn'd to die tomorrow  LYSANDER  Tomorrow Ere tomorrow men shall die  Who are not yet condemn'd  EUXUS  'Tis true by heaven  Mortal designs and enterprizes rise▪  On every side The Ephori resolve  At midnight to surprize the royal band  And order'd me to hold my troops prepar'd  Their forces to sustain  LYSANDER  'Tis well 'tis wondrous well  They urge me now and point the line of action  Under the high uplifted arm of fate  I'll rush and strike before their blow can fall  I'll storm the city while they force the camp  Your troops  EUXUS  Shall join you at the gate The word  LYSANDER  AGIS Farewel Now I shall save thee AGIS  Or leave my blood upon the stones of Sparta  Exeunt  LYSANDER  and  EUXUS  End of the fourth Act  ACT V SCENE I  AMPHARES  and the Ephori with the Officers  c  The gate of the prison seen at a distance  First EPHORE  THE hour is past  Second EPHORE  I fear  AMPHARES  Silence He comes  I hear the steps of wary treading feet  Enter a  Spartan AGIS  following  AGIS  This way conducts not to Amycla's gate  Ha whither dost thou lead me  AMPHARES  To thy death  The Ephori of Sparta have condemn'd thee  AGIS  I am betray'd What mockery is this  Of sacred justice Lay aside the robes  And ensigns of authority prophan'd  The pomp of magistracy suits not treason  AMPHARES  The licence of thy tongue affronts the laws  Whose awful reverence our office guards  AGIS  Know ye not this ye guardians of the laws  The meanest citizen of Lacedaemon  Without free trial cannot be condemn'd  Much less your king What law have I transgress'd  Point out my crime produce my bold accusers  AMPHARES  Thy crime is tyranny  AGIS  Is that my crime  Had AGIS been a tyrant thou had'st been  His fawning slave thou enemy of freedom  AMPHARES  Behold the stubborn spirit of this man  He breathes his native arrogance and still  Insults his judges and avows his crimes  AGIS  Who made you judges of the life of AGIS  But you have judg'd yourselves and earth and heaven  Know how unjustly To the Gods above  The sure avengers of a murder'd king  I make my last appeal Their messenger  Is on the wing LYSANDER comes apace  And NEMESIS directs his righteous sword  AMPHARES  Proceeds this boldness from thy trust in him  Thy great avenger is like thee a captive  And under the same mortal sentence lies  AGIS  Ye powers above LYSANDER too a captive  Where was he taken  AMPHARES  In the streets of Sparta  Clad in the servile garment of a Helot  AGIS  Alas alas LYSANDER O my friend  Thy love for me thy generous fearless love  Has wrought thy fall For me thou cam'st to Sparta  And▪ like the parent bird hov'ring too near  Its captive young thy noble life is lost  Forgive these tears my country AGIS weeps  For thee Alas thy brave defender's gone  O Lacedaemon  thou art fallen for ever  Thy bad estate shall every day grow worse  Successive tyrants shall exhaust thy strength  Till all thy generous youths have bled in vain  At last the consummation of thy woes  Shall come upon thee some ambitious foe  Shall stretch the iron arm of conquest forth  And grasp thee in the circle of his empire  My native land the kingdom of my fathers  Shall be no more a nation O my country  How irretrievable is thy condition  The Macedonian vulture hovers o'er thee  Soon to descend and on thy vitals prey  AMPHARES  Thou may'st delay perhaps avoid thy death  Send forth thy mandate to the royal band  To halt till further orders  AGIS  Ha No more  I trust thee traitor Would I had ever been  Thus deaf to thee No let the royal band  Revenge their gallant leader and their king  First EPHORE  Thou tempt'st thy fate  AGIS  I scorn it Since my hope  Of Sparta's lost and my beloved friend  Has perish'd in my cause why should I live  In any period of my former days  I rather would have chose to die attempting  The glorious design which you have ruin'd  Than live the prince of a degenerate people  The tame spectator of a falling empire  First EPHORE  To Reason hearken  AGIS  Reason bids me die  As I have liv'd unalter'd in my love  To Sparta and unconquer'd in my purpose  You mean to take advantage of my state  Without spectator counsellor or friend  You think I dread the stern approach of death  Because the blooming season of my life  Still promises a long extent of years  But my forefathers blood is in my veins  The blood of heroes and of Spartan kings  Less only than the Gods I dare your worst  And with my dying breath acquit my people  The people rose they hearken'd to the voice  Of Liberty and blest the name of AGIS  But you the nobles an inglorious race  Base as the dastard and unarmed Helots  With foreign arms and mercenary aid  Bore down the people and opprest your prince  Whom death delivers AGIS shall not see  The last convulsions of expiring Freedom  For in the first he dies  AMPHARES  We'll hear no more  Of these invectives Bear him to the place  Of execution Officers advance  And do your duty  OFFICERS  This is not our duty  AMPHARES  What  OFFICERS  Murder of a king is not our duty  AMPHARES  Mutinous flaves for you I'll find a time  Sir  To  AGIS  AGIS  Touch me not for uncompell'd I go  To meet my destiny Weep not for me  To an officer  O thou whose nature suits not thy employment  Weep not for me I would not change conditions  With these bad men I shall not feel the woes  That thou and all must feel the woes of Sparta  O might my death avail my muchlov'd country  I'd die as joyful then as fearless now  Exit  AGIS  guarded  AMPHARES  Atone your insolence by prompt obedience  Or death's your portion  To an Officer  Exeunt with  AGIS  Manet  AMPHARES c  AMPHARES

Whilst AGIS lives Let thy good sword fulfil  The sentence of the law and thy own tongue  Shall name the recompense  MESSENGER  Shall it my lord  I am your instrument and bind myself  By this bold deed still faster to your fortunes  Exit  AMPHARES  Ye sons of bold ambition learn of me  Trust not the survey of another's eye  Your dangerous voyage needs a pilot's care  Who never quits the helm  Enter

 The deed is done already Yet I have  One pledge of value  SPARTAN  AGESISTRATA  AMPHARES  This hour she dies I've sent a trusty slave  To end her woes But the Athenian maid  Her I'll bear off in

MESSENGER  My lord the troops of EUXUS have revolted  RHINALCES visited this night each post  And near Amycla's gate some Thracians met  Whose leader question'd answer'd with his sword  AMPHARES  By heaven and earth LYSANDERHa proceed  MESSENGER  The sudden onset and the cloud of night  The traitors favour'd some escap'd our swords  But many more in the sharp combat fell  AMPHARES  Did their fierce leader fall  MESSENGER  Above the rest  Conspicuous he fought at him each sword  Was pointed If he fell not on the spot  Sure he received wounds that must fatal prove  AMPHARES  Confirm me that and I will mock at fate  Command my troops that in the Forum watch  To join RHINALCES I myself will follow  Exit  MESSENGER  Enter  EUANTHE  How beautiful she is Should he survive  Those charms divine

 The dungeonmouth is open  Enter  RHESUS  Tell me RHESUS  RHESUS  The king is murder'd in yon vault he lies  LYSANDER  My prince my friend thy goodness and thy virtue  Thy clemency thy mildness have undone thee  Fatal to nations is the dread example  Hence monarchs who with iron sceptre rule  Will justify their treatment of mankind  And virtuous princes born in evil times  Will hesitate to stem corruption's tide  Lest they should be like AGIS overwhelm'd  AMPHARES  He who preferr'd LYSANDER to AMPHARES  Has paid me with his life My dying hand  Hath sow'd the seeds of discord and distraction  Peace ne'er shall dwell in Sparta Plagues on plagues  Shall rise to curse you as  Dies  LYSANDER  Thy soul is curst  There the fell spirit of AMPHARES fled  In imprecations Prophet of disasters  Upon the dismal banks of Acheron  Amidst the wailing ghosts still curse thy country  And end a speech the damn'd will hate to hear  Behold the mother of our murder'd king  Enter  AGESISTRATA  and  EUXUS  AGESISTRATA  Alas I need not ask the fate of AGIS  Your looks your silence say I have no son  Yet speak to me for I can hear the worst  I have been long familiar with affliction  I am the widow of the fire of AGIS  LYSANDER  There lies the bloody author of his death  Slain by my hand  AGESISTRATA  Alas alas my son  Oft has my anxious mind this hour foreseen  And warn'd thee oft But thou the danger scorn'd  When Sparta's glory was the price of peril  O son of Jove great author of our race  Sustain my soul For he who was my stay  My comfort and my strength is now no more  Yet in the path his generous spirit chose  He fell and conscious virtue crown'd his fall  LYSANDER  So fell not false AMPHARES  EUXUS  And SANDANE  LYSANDER  SANDANE dead  EUXUS  And dreadful was her death  She fled for refuge from the people's rage  To the same turret where AMPHARES' troops  Guarded the queen whose mantle on the ground  She spied and wrapt it round her wretched head  When suddenly a stern assassin came  And stabb'd her as that queen whose robe she wore  Arriving then I heard her shriek for help  Implore her country's Gods with bitter cries  And in her agony divulge her crimes  It was no wonder that she fear'd to die  AGESISTRATA  O guilt thou'rt worst of all he knew thee not  For whom I mourn Untimely was his fate  Yet fall of high and pleasing thoughts he fell  Greathearted Virtue in its swelling hour  Scarce feels the blow that strikes at brittle life  The painful part is mine in grief to live  Would I had dy'd for thee my son my son  EUANTHE  EUANTHE's tears shall ever flow with yours  For her protector and her gentle friend  Mysterious are the counsels of the Gods  Together AGIS and AMPHARES fall  LYSANDER  The son of AGIS lives his infant years  Require a mother's care

matchless worth and honour of your minds  Henceforth be Spartans And ye Spartan youths  Whom AGIS lov'd and for whose rights he died  Display the spirit of your dearbought freedom  With grateful valour guard the hero's son  And prove that AGIS perish'd not in vain  AGESISTRATA  Conduct me Spartans to his dear remains  LYSANDER  Forbear awhile yon dismal vault  Enter  MESSENGER  MESSENGER  My Lord  The people headed by the priests of Jove  And Hercules in long procession come  Bearing the body of their royal lord  From that base dungeon to the sculptur'd tomb  Which guards the sacred dust of Sparta's kings  Enter the Procession with the Body of  AGIS  LYSANDER  O Destiny supreme  EUANTHE  O sad remains  Of youth and majesty  AGESISTRATA  My son my son  Nature is thwarted here thou shouldst have borne  Thy aged parent to the silent tomb  CHORUS  Mourn ye sons of Sparta mourn  Pour the sad lamenting strain  Wretched people Land forlorn  Mourn the best of princes slain  Priest of JUPITER  He fell not as the warrior falls  Whose breast defends his native walls  To treason Agis bow'd his head  And by his guilty subjects bled  Betray'd by those his mercy spar'd  Ingratitude was his reward  CHORUS  Shame is mix'd with Sparta's woe  Blood of kings the city stains  Ever let our sorrows flow  Shame indelible remains  Priest of JUPITER  Yet AGIS triumph'd in his fall  For Virtue triumphs over all  Great superior to his fate  He only griev'd for Sparta's state  When Jove decrees a nation's doom  He calls their heroes to the tomb  Fearless they fall immortal rise  And claim the freedom of the skies  CHORUS  AGIS triumph'd in his fall  Virtue triumphs over all  Such a king shall ne'er return  Our country and ourselves we mourn  Priest of HERCULES  AGIS fell by fraud o'ercome  A like was great Alcides' doom  Yet then most worthy of his fire  The son of Jove when wrapt in fire  Victorious crown'd his labours past  His noblest labour was the last  CHORUS of all  Now in peace our hero lies  Ceas'd his toil his race is run  Freedom is the glorious prize  Agis for his people won  FINIS  EPILOGUE  Spoken by Mrs PRITCHARD  A King in bloom of youth for freedom die  Our bard tho' bold durst not have soar'd so high  This is no credulous admiring age  But sacred sure the faith of Plutarch's page  In simple stile that antient sage relates  The tale of Sparta chief of Grecian states  Eight hundred years it flourish'd great in arms  On dangers rose and grow amidst alarms  Of Sparta's triumph you have heard the cause  More strong more noble than Lycurgus' laws  How Spartan Dames by glory's charms inspir'd  The son the lover and the husband fir'd  Ye Fair of Britain's isle which justly claims  The Grecian title land of lovely dames  In Britain's cause exert your matchless charms  And rouse your lovers to the love of arms  Hid not extinct the spark of valour lies  Your breath shall raise it f  aming to the skies  Now Mars his bloody banner hangs in air  And bids Britannia's s  ns for war prepare  Let each lov'd maid  ach mother bring the shield  And arm their country's champions for the field  Arm'd and inflam'd each British breast shall burn  No youth unlaurel'd shall to you return  Then shall we cease t'exult at trophies won  In glory's field by Heroesnot our own  France yet shall tremble at the British sword  And dread the Vengeance of her antient Lord
