St Paul's Churchyard and T SLACK in Newcastle  MDCCLXVI  A CARD from the AUTHOR to DAVID GARRICK  Esq  REMOTENESS  of situation and some other circumstances have hitherto deprived the Author of that happiness he might receive from seeing Mr  GARRICK  'Tis the universal regard his cha∣racter commands occasions this address  It may be thought by many at a vi∣sit so abrupt as this is that something highly complimentary should be said on  the part of the intruder but according to the ideas the Author has conceived of Mr  GARRICK  'S delicacy and good sense a single period in the garb of flattery would certainly offend him  He therefore takes his leaveand af∣ter having stept perhaps a little too forward to offer his tribute of esteem respectfully retires  NEWCASTLE  Feb    THE SUBSCRIBERS

as the Law directs  DAY A PASTORAL  Carpe diem  HOR  MORNING  I  I  N the barn the tenant Cock  Close to partlet perch'd on high  Briskly crows the shepherd's clock  Jocund that the morning's nigh  II  Swiftly from the mountain's brow  Shadows nurs'd by night retire  And the peeping sunbeam now  Paints with gold the village spire  III  Philomel forsakes the thorn  Plaintive where she prates at night  And the Lark to meet the morn  Soars beyond the shepherd's sight  IV  From the lowroof'd cottage ridge  See the chatt'ring Swallow spring  Darting through the onearch'd bridge  Quick she dips her dappled wing  V  Now the pinetree's waving top  Gently greets the morning gale  Kidlings now begin to crop  Daisies on the dewey dale  VI  From the balmy sweets uncloy'd  Restless till her task be done  Now the busy Bee's employ'd  Sipping dew before the sun  VII  Trickling through the crevic'd rock  Where the limpid stream distills  Sweet refreshment waits the flock  When 'tis sundrove from the hills  VIII  COLIN'S for the promis'd corn  E're the harvest hopes are ripe  Anxiouswhilst the huntsman's horn  Boldly sounding drowns his pipe  IX  SweetO sweet the warbling throng  On the white emblossom'd spray  Nature's universal song  Echos to the rising day  NOON  X  FERVID on the glitt'ring flood  Now the noontide radiance glows  Drooping o'er its infant bud  Not a dewdrop's left the rose  XI  By the brook the shepherd dines  From the fierce meridian heat  Shelter'd by the branching pines  Pendant o'er his grassy seat  XII  Now the flock forsakes the glade  Where uncheck'd the sunbeams fall  Sure to find a pleasing shade  By the ivy'd abbey wall  XIII  Echo in her airy round  O'er the river rock and hill  Cannot catch a single sound  Save the clack of yonder mill  XIV  Cattle court the zephirs bland  Where the streamlet wanders cool  Or with languid silence stand  Midway in the marshy pool  XV  But from mountain dell or stream  Not a flutt'ring zephir springs  Fearful lest the noontide beam  Scorch its soft its silken wings  XVI  Not a leaf has leave to stir  Nature's lull'dsereneand still  Quiet e'en the shepherd's cur  Sleeping on the heathclad hill  XVII  Languid is the landscape round  Till the fresh descending shower  Grateful to the thirsty ground  Raises ev'ry fainting flower  XVIII  Now the hillthe hedgeis green  Now the warblers' throats in tune  Blithsome is the verdant scene  Brighten'd by the beams of Noon  EVENING  XIX  O'ER the heath the heifer strays  Freethe furrow'd task is done  Now the village windows blaze  Burnish'd by the setting sun  XX  Now he sets behind the hill  Sinking from a golden sky  Can the pencil's mimic skill  Copy the refulgent dye  XXI  Trudging as the plowmen go  To the smoaking hamlet bound  Giantlike their shadows grow  Lengthen'd o'er the level ground  XXII  Where the rising forest spreads  Shelter for the lordly dome  To their highbuilt airy beds  See the rooks returning home  XXIII  As the Lark with vary'd tune  Carrols to the evening loud  Mark the mild resplendent moon  Breaking through a parted cloud  XXIV  Now the hermit Howlet peeps  From the barn or twisted brake  And the blue mist slowly creeps  Curling on the silver lake  XXV  As the Trout in speckled pride  Playful from its bosom springs  To the banks a ruffled tide  Verges in successive rings  XXVI  Tripping through the silken grass  O'er the pathdivided dale  Mark the rosecomplexion'd lass  With her wellpois'd milking pail  XXVII  Linnets with unnumber'd notes  And the Cuckow bird with two  Tuning sweet their mellow throats  Bid the setting sun adieu  THE CONTEMPLATIST A NIGHT PIECE  Nox erat  Cum tacet omnis ager pecudes pictaeque volucres  I  THE nurse of CONTEMPLATION Night  Begins her balmy reign  Advancing in their varied light  Her silvervested train  II  'Tis strange the many marshall'd stars  That ride yon sacred round  Should keep among their rapid cars  A silence so profound  III  A kind a philosophic calm  The cool creation wears  And what Day drank of dewy balm  The gentle Night repairs  IV  Behind their leafy curtains hid  The feather'd race how still  How quiet now the gamesome kid  That gambol'd round the hill  V  The sweets that bending o'er their banks  From sultry Day declin'd  Revive in little velvet ranks  And scent the western wind  VI  The Moon preceded by the breeze  That bade the clouds retire  Appears amongst the tufted trees  A Phoenix nest on fire  VII  But softthe golden glow subsides  Her chariot mounts on high  And now in silent pomp she rides  Pale regent of the sky  VIII  Where TIME upon the wither'd tree  Hath carv'd the moral chair  I sit from busy passions free  And breathe the placid air  IX  The wither'd tree was once in prime  Its branches brav'd the sky  Thus at the touch of ruthless TIME  Shall Youth and Vigour die  X  I'm lifted to the blue expanse  It glows serenely gay  Come SCIENCE by my side advance  We'll search the Milky Way  XI  Let us descendThe daring flight  Fatigues my feeble mind  And SCIENCE in the maze of light  Is impotent and blind  XII  What are those wild those wand'ring fires  That o'er the moorland ran  Vapours How like the vague desires  That cheat the heart of MAN  XIII  But there's a friendly guidea flame  That lambent o'er its bed  Enlivens with a gladsome beam  The hermit's osier shed  XIV  Amongst the russet shades of night  It glances from afar  And darts along the dusk so bright  It seems a silver star  XV  In coverts where the few frequent  If VIRTUE deigns to dwell  'Tis thus the little lamp CONTENT  Gives lustre to her cell  XVI  How smooth that rapid river slides  Progressive to the deep  The poppies pendent o'er its sides  Have charm'd the waves to sleep  XVII  PLEASURE'S intoxicated sons  Ye indolent ye gay  Reflectfor as the river runs  Life wings its tractless way  XVIII  That branching grove of dusky green  Conceals the azure sky  Save where a starry space between  Relieves the darken'd eye  XIX  Old ERROR thus with shades impure  Throws sacred Truth behind  Yet sometimes through the deep obscure  She bursts upon the mind  XX  Sleep and her sister Silence reign  They lock the Shepherds fold  But harkI hear a lamb complain  'Tis lost upon the wold  XXI  To savage herds that hunt for prey  An unresisting prize  For having trod a devious way  The little rambler dies  XXII  As luckless is the virgin's lot  Whom pleasure once misguides  When hurried from the halcion cot  Where INNOCENCE presides  XXIII  The Passions a relentless train  To tear the victim run  She seeks the paths of peace in vain  Is conquer'dand undone  XXIV  How bright the little insects blaze  Where willows shade the way  As proud as if their painted rays  Could emulate the Day  XXV  'Tis thus the pygmy sons of pow'r  Advance their vain parade  Thus glitter in the darken'd hour  And like the glowworms fade  XXVI  The soft serenity of night  Ungentle clouds deform  The silver host that shone so bright  Is hid behind a storm  XXVII  The angry elements engage  An oak an ivied bower  Repels the rough winds noisy rage  And shields me from the shower  XXVIII  The rancour thus of rushing fate  I've learnt to render vain  For whilst Integrity's her seat  The soul will sit serene  XXIX  A raven from some greedy vault  Amidst that cloister'd gloom  Bids me and 'tis a solemn thought  Reflect upon the tomb  XXX  The tombThe consecrated dome  The temple rais'd to PEACE  The port that to its friendly home  Compels the human race  XXXI  Yon village to the moral mind  A solemn aspect wears  Where sleep hath lull'd the labour'd hind  And kill'd his daily cares  XXXII  'Tis but the churchyard of the Night  An emblematic bed  That offers to the mental sight  The temporary dead  XXXIII  From hence I'll penetrate in thought  The grave's unmeasur'd deep  And tutor'd hence be timely taught  To meet my final sleep  XXXIV  'Tis peaceThe little chaos past  The gentle moon's restor'd  A breeze succeeds the frightful blast  That through the forest roar'd  XXXV  The Nightingale a welcome guest  Renews her gentle strains  And HOPE just wand'ring from my breast  Her wonted seat regains  XXXVI  YesWhen yon lucid orb is dark  And darting from on high  My soul a more celestial spark  Shall keep her native sky  XXXVII  Fann'd by the lightthe lenient breeze  My limbs refreshment find  And moral rhapsodies like these  Give vigour to the mind  CONTENT A PASTORAL  I  O'ER moorlands and mountains rude bar∣ren and bare  As wilder'd and weary'd I roam  A gentle young shepherdess sees my despair  And leads meo'er lawnsto her home  Yellow sheafs from rich CERES her cottage had crown'd  Green rushes were strew'd on her floor  Her casement sweet woodbines crept wantonly round  And deck'd the sod seats at her door  II  We sate ourselves down to a cooling repast  Fresh fruits and she cull'd me the best  While thrown from my guard by some glances she cast  Love slily stole into my breast  I told my soft wishes she sweetly reply'd  Ye virgins her voice was divine  I've rich ones rejected and great ones deny'd  But take me fond shepherdI'm thine  III  Her air was so modest her aspect so meek  So simple yet sweet were her charms  I kiss'd the ripe roses that glow'd on her cheek  And lock'd the lov'd maid in my arms  Now jocund together we tend a few sheep  And if by yon prattler the stream  Reclin'd on her bosom I sink into sleep  Her image still softens my dream  IV  Together we range o'er the slow rising hills  Delighted with pastoral views  Or rest on the rock whence the streamlet distils  And point out new themes for my muse  To pomp or proud titles she ne'er did aspire  The damsel's of humble descent  The cottager PEACE is well known for her sire  And shepherds have nam'd her CONTENT  WITH A PRESENT  I  LET not the hand of AMITY be nice  Nor the poor tribute from the heart disclaim  A trifle shall become a pledge of price  If friendship stamps it with her sacred name  II  The little rose that laughs upon its stem  One of the sweets with which the gardens teem  In value soars above an eastern gem  If tender'd as the token of esteem  III  Had I vast hoards of massy wealth to send  Such as your merits might demandtheir due  Then should the golden tribute of your friend  Rival the treasures of the rich PERU  CORYDON A PASTORAL To the Memory of  William Shenstone  Esq  I  COME shepherds we'll follow the hearse  We'll see our lov'd CORYDON laid  Tho' sorrow may blemish the verse  Yet let a sad tribute be paid  They call'd him the pride of the plain  In sooth he was gentle and kind  He mark'd on his elegant strain  The graces that glow'd in his mind  II  On purpose he planted yon trees  That birds in the covert might dwell  He cultur'd his thyme for the bees  But never wou'd rifle their cell  Ye lambkins that play'd at his feet  Go bleatand your master bemoan  His music was artless and sweet  His manners as mild as your own  III  No verdure shall cover the vale  No bloom on the blossoms appear  The sweets of the forest shall fail  And winter discolour the year  No birds in our hedges shall sing  Our hedges so vocal before  Since he that should welcome the spring  Can greet the gay season no more  IV  His PHILLIS was fond of his praise  And poets came round in a throng  They listen'dthey envy'd his lays  But which of them equal'd his song  Ye shepherds hence forward be mute  For lost is the pastoral strain  So give me my CORYDON'S flute  And thuslet me break it in twain  The  ROSE  and  BUTTERFLY  A  FABLE  AT day's early dawn a gay Butterfly spied  A budding young Rose and he wish'd her his bride  She blush'd when she heard him his passion declare  And tenderly told himhe need not despair  Their faith was soon plighted as lovers will do  He swore to be constant she vow'd to be true  It had not been prudent to deal with delay  The bloom of a rose passes quickly away  And the pride of a butterfly dies in a day  When wedded away the wing'd gentleman hies  From flow'ret to flow'ret he wantonly flies  Nor did he revisit his bride till the sun  Had less than onefourth of his journey to run  The Rose thus reproach'd him'Already so cold  'How feign'd O you false one that passion you told  ''Tis an age since you left me' She meant a few hours  But such we'll suppose the fond language of flowers  'I saw when you gave the base vi'let a kiss  'Howhow could you stoop to a meanness like this  'Shall a low little wretch whom we roses despise  'Find favour O love in my butterfly's eyes  'On a tulip quite tawdry I saw your fond rape  'Nor yet could the pitiful primrose escape  'Dull daffodils too were with ardour address'd  'And poppies illscented you kindly caress'd'  The coxcomb was piqu'd and reply'd with a sneer  'That you're first to complain I commend you my dear  'But know from your conduct my maxims I drew  'And if I'm inconstant I copy from you  'I saw the boy Zephirus rifle your charms  'I saw how you simper'd and smil'd in his arms  'The honeybee kiss'd you you cannot disown  'You favour'd besidesO dishonoura drone  'Yet worse'tis a crime that you must not deny  'Your sweets were made common false rose to a fly  MORAL  This law long ago did Love's providence make  That ev'ry coquet should be curs'd with a rake  DAMON  and  PHEBE  I  WHen the sweet rosey morning first peep'd from the skies  A loud singing lark bade the villagers rise  The cowslips were livelythe primroses gay  And shed their best perfumes to welcome the May  The swains and their sweethearts all rang'd on the green  Did homage to Phebeand haild her their queen  II  Young Damon step'd forward he sung in her praise  And Phebe bestow'd him a garland of bays  May this wreath said the fair one dear Lord of my rows  A crown for true merit bloom long on thy brows  The swains and their sweethearts that danc'd on the green  Approv'd the fond present of Phebe their queen  III  'Mong'st lords and fine ladies we shepherds are told  The dearest affections are barter'd for gold  That discord in wedlock is often their lot  While Cupid and Hymen shake hands in a cot  At the church with fair Phebe since Damon has been  He's rich as a monarchshe's blest as a queen  A PASTORAL HYMN To  JANUS  On the BIRTH of the QUEEN  Te primum pia thura rogentte vota salutent te Colat omnis honas  MART ad Janum  I  TO JANUS gentle shepherds raise a shrine  His honours be divine  And as to mighty PAN with homage bow  To him the virgin troop shall tribute bring  Let him be hail'd like the greenliveried spring  Spite of the wint'ry storms that stain his brow  II  The pride the glowing pageantry of MAY  Glides wantonly away  But JANUARY in his rough spun vest  Boasts the full blessings that can never fade  He that gave birth to the illustrious maid  Whose beauties make the BRITISH MONARCH blest  III  Could the soft spring with all her sunny showers  The frolic nurse of flowers  Or flaunting summer flush'd in ripen'd pride  Could they produce a finish'd sweet so rare  Or from his golden stores a gift so fair  Say has the fertile Autumn e'er supply'd  IV  Hence forward let the hoary month be gay  As the whitehawthorn'd MAY  The laughing goddess of the spring disown'd  HER rosy wreath shall on HIS brows appear  Old JANUS as he leads shall fill the year  And the less fruitful AUTUMN be dethron'd  V  Above the other months supremely blest  Glad JANUS stands confest  He can behold with retrospective face  The mighty blessings of the year gone by  Where to connect a Monarch's nuptial tie  Assembled ev'ry glory ev'ry grace  VI  When he looks forward on the flatt'ring year  The golden hours appear  As in the sacred reign of Saturn fair  Britain shall prove from this propitious date  Her honours perfect victories compleat  And boast the brightest hopes a BRITISH HEIR  The above little poem was wrote on supposition that her Ma∣jesty's birthday was  really  in the month of January  STANZAS ON THE FORWARDNESS of SPRING  tibi flores plenis  Ecce ferunt nymphae calathis  VIR  I  O'ER Nature's fresh bosom by verdure unbound  Bleak Winter blooms lovely as Spring  Rich flow'rets how fragrant rise wantonly round  And Summer's wing'd choristers sing  II  To greet the young monarch of Britain's blest isle  The groves with gay blossoms are grac'd  The primrose peeps forth with an innocent smile  And cowslips croud forward in haste  III  Dispatch gentle Flora the nymphs of your train  Thro' woodlands to gather each sweet  Gorob of young roses the dewspangl'd plain  And strew the gay spoils at his feet  IV  Two chaplets of laurel in verdure the same  For GEORGE oh ye virgins entwine  From Conquest's own temples these evergreens came  And those from the brows of the Nine  V  What honours ye Britons one emblem implies  What glory to GEORGE shall belong  What Miltons the other what Addisons rise  To make him immortal in song  VI  To a wreath of fresh Oak England's emblem of pow'r  Whose honours with time shall encrease  Add a fair olive sprig just unfolding its flow'r  Rich token of Concord and Peace  VII  Next give him young Myrtles by Beauties bright queen  Collectedthe pride of the grove  How fragrant their odour their foliage how green  Sweet promise of conjugal Love  VIII  Let Gaul's captive Lillies cropt close to the ground  As trophies of Conquest be ty'd  The virgins all cry "there's not one to be found  "Outbloom'd by his Rosesthey dy'd"  IX  Ye foes of Old England such fate shall ye share  With GEORGE as our glories advance  Thro' envy you'll sickenyou'll droopyou'll despair  And dielike the Lillies of France  As the foregoing stanzas have appeared anonymous in some periodical papers 'tis thought necessary to observe that they were o∣riginally inserted with the Author's name in an  Edinburgh  Maga∣zine  On the  APPROACH  of  MAY  I  THE virgin when soften'd by MAY  Attends to the villager's vows  The birds sweetly bill on the spray  And poplars embrace with their boughs  On Ida bright Venus may reign  Ador'd for her beauty above  We shepherds that dwell on the plain  Hail MAY as the mother of love  II  From the West as it wantonly blows  ond zephir caresses the vine  bee steals a kiss from the rose  d willows and woodbines entwine  pinks by the rivulet side  t border the vernal

PAN bade me stick to my strain  Nor lessons too lofty rehearse  Ambition befits not a swain  And PHILLIS loves pastoral verse  II  The rose tho' a beautiful red  Looks faded to PHILLIS'S bloom  And the breeze from the beanflow'r bed  To her breath's but a feeble perfume  The dewdrop so limpid and gay  That loose on the violet lies  Tho' brighten'd by PHEBUS'S ray  Wants lustre compar'd to her eyes  III  A lilly I pluck'd in full pride  Its freshness with her's to compare  And foolishly thought till I try'd  The flow'ret was equally fair  How CORYDON could you mistake  Your fault be with sorrow confest  You said the white Swans on the lake  For softness might rival her breast  IV  While thus I went on in her praise  My PHILLIS pass'd sportive along  Ye poets I covet no bays  She smil'da reward for my song  I find the God PAN'S in the right  No fame's like the fair ones applause  And CUPID must crown with delight  The shepherd that sings in his cause  The  VIOLET  I  SHelter'd

stream  I bow'd my snowey pride  And languish'd in a fruitless flame  For what the fates deny'd  The fair PASTORA chanc'd to pass  With such an Angel air  I saw her in the wat'ry glass  And lov'd the rival fair  II  Ye fates no longer let me pine  A selfadmiring sweet  Permit me by your grace divine  To kiss the fair one's feet  That if by chance the gentle maid  My fragrance should admire  I mayupon her bosom laid  In sister sweets expire  POMONA  A  PASTORAL  I  FROM orchards of ample extent  Pomona's compel'd to depart  And thus as in anguish she went  The Goddess unburthen'd her heart

conveniently neat  With a mill and some meadowsa freehold estate  A wellmeaning miller by labour supplies  Those blessings that grandeur to great ones denies  No passions to plague him no cares to torment  His constant companions are health and content  Their lordships in lace may remark if they will  He's honest tho' daub'd with the dust of his mill  II  Ere the larks early carrols salute the new day  He springs from his cottage as jocund as May  He chearfully whistles regardless of care  Or sings the last ballad he bought at the fair  While courtiers are toil'd in the cobwebs of state  Or bribing elections in hopes to be great  No fraud of ambition his bosom does fill  Contented he works if there's grist for his mill  III  On Sunday bedeck'd in his homespun array  At church he's the loudest to chaunt or to pray  He sits to a dinner of plain English food  Tho' simple the pudding his appetite's good  At night when the priest and exciseman are gone  He quaffs at the alehouse with Roger and John  Then reels to his pillow and dreams of no ill  No monarch more blest than the man of the mill  The  LVIII ODE of ANA∣CREON imitated  AS I wove with wanton care  Fillets for a virgin's

malicious joy  Sudden I secur'd the boy  And regardless of his cries  Bore the little frighted prize  Where the mighty goblet stood  Teeming with a rosy flood  Urchin in my rage I cry'd  What avails thy saucy pride  From thy busy vengeance free  Triumph now belongs to me  ThusI drown thee in my cup  Thusin wine I drink thee up  Fatal was the nectar'd draught  That to murder LOVE I quaff'd  O'er my bosom's fond domains  Now the cruel tyrant reigns  On my heart's most tender strings  Striking with his wanton wings  I'm for ever doom'd to prove  All the insolence of love  A LANDSCAPE  Rura mihi

Near the farmhouse forms a bridge  VII  On her breast the funny beam  Glitters in meridian pride  Yonder as the virgin stream  Hastens to the restless tide  VIII  Where the ships by wanton gales

more  But urg'd the soft pressure with ardour so sweet  I could not begrudge him a score  My lambkins I've kiss'd and no change ever found  Many times as we play'd on the hill  But Damon's dear lips made my heart gallop round  Nor would the fond urchin lie still  III  When the sun blazes fierce to the Sycamore shade  For shelter I'm sure to repair  And virgins in faith I'm no longer afraid  Altho' the dear shepherd be there  At ev'ry fond kiss that with freedom he takes  My heart may rebound if it will  There's something so sweet in the bustle it makes  I'll die 'ere I bid it lie still

Tyrant tenant of my breast  There a thousand WISHES try  On their callow wings to fly  There you may a thousand tell  Pertly peeping through the shell  In a state unfinish'd rise  Thousands of a smaller size  Till their noisy chirpings cease  Never shall my heart have peace  Feather'd ones the younglings feed  Till mature they're fit to breed  Then to swell the crowded store  They produce their thousands more  Nor can mighty numbers count  In my breast their vast amount  LOVE  and  CHASTITY  A  CANTATA  RECITATIVE  FRom the high mount  Mount Latmos  whence sacred groves depend  Diana

jovial song  AIR  Jolly HEALTH springs aloft at the loud sound∣ing horn  Unlock'd from soft SLUMBER'S embrace  And JOY sings an hymn to salute the sweet morn  That smiles on the nymphs of the chace  The rage of fell Cupid no bosom prophanes  No rancour disturbs our delight  All the day with fresh VIGOUR we sweep o'er the plains  And sleep with CONTENTMENT all night  RECIT  Their clamour rous'd the slighted god of love  He flies indignant to the sacred grove  Immortal myrtles wreathe his golden hair  His rosy wings perfume the wanton air  Two quivers fill'd with darts his fell designs declare  A crimson blush o'erspreads fair Dian's face  A frown succeedsShe stops the springing chace  And thus forbids the boy the consecrated place  AIR  Fond disturber of the heart  From these halcion shades depart  Here's a blooming troop disdains  Love and his fantastic chains  Sisters of the silver bow  Pure and chaste as virgin snow  Melt not at thy feeble fires  Wanton god of wild desires  RECIT  Rage and revenge divide Love's little breast  Whilst thus the angry goddess he addrest  AIR  Virgin snow does oft remain  Long unmelted on the plain  Till the glorious god of day  Smiles and wastes its pride away  What is Sol's meridian fire  To the darts of strong desire  Love can light a raging flame  Hotter than his noontide beam  RECIT  Now through the forest's brownembower'd ways  With careless steps the young Endymion strays  His form erectloose flows his lovely hair  His glowing cheek like youthful Hebe's fair  His graceful limbs with ease and vigour move

rustic grot  If the god of Sleep resides  Or in Pan's sequester'd cot  Hither if he'll lightly tread  Follow'd by a gentle dream  We'll enjoy this grassy bed  On the bank beside the stream  RECIT  As on the painted turf the shepherd lies  Sleep's downy curtain shades his lovely eyes  And now a sporting breeze his bosom shews  As marble smooth and white as Alpine snows  The Goddess gaz'd in magic softness bound  Her silver bow falls useless to the ground  Love laugh'd and sure of conquest wing'd a dart  Unerring to her undefended heart  She feels in every vein the fatal fire  And thus persuades her virgins to retire  AIR  I  Ye tender maids be timely wise  Love's wanton fury shun  In flight alone your safety lies  The daring are undone  II  Do blueey'd doves serenely mild  With vultures fell engage  Do lambs provoke the lion wild  Or tempt the tyger's rage  III  No no like fawns ye virgins fly  To secret cells remove  Nor dare the doubtful combat try  'Twixt CHASTITY and

willow's a shade for my brows  For Phillis no longer remembers her vows  To the groves with young Collin the shepherdess flies  While Damon disturbs the still plains with his sighs  PHILLIS  Bethink thee false Damon before you upbraid  When Phoebe's fair lambkin had yesterday stray'd  Thro' the woodlands you wander'd poor Phillis forgot  And drove the gay rambler quite home to her cot  A swain so

pain  Pursues my heated blood thro' ev'ry vein  Whatwhat does the enchantment mean  Ah give the charming magic o'er  My beating heart can bear no more  II  Now wild with fierce desire  My breast is all on fire  In soften'd raptures now I die  Can empty sound such joys impart  Can music thus transport the heart  With melting extasy  O art divine exalted blessing  Each celestial charm expressing  Kindest gift the gods bestow  Sweetest good that mortals know  III  When seated in a verdant shade  Like tuneful Thyrsis Orpheus play'd  The distant trees forsake the wood  The list'ning beasts neglect their food  To hear the heav'nly sound  The Dryads leave the mountains  The Naiades quit the fountains  And in a sprightly chorus dance around  IV  To raise the stately walls of ancient Troy  Sweet Phoebus did his tuneful harp employ  See what soft harmony can do  The moving rocks the sound pursue  Till in a large collected mass they grew  Had Thyrsis liv'd in these remoter days  His were the chaplet of immortal bays  Apollo's harp unknown  The shepherd had remain'd of song  The Deity alone  A  FRAGMENT  Part of a Poem wrote on Miss  BELLAMY  when in Dublin  FROM slavish rules mechanic forms unty'd  She soars with sacred nature for her guide  The smile of peacethe wildness of despair  The soft'ning sighthe soul dissolving tear  Each magic charm the boasted Oldfield knew  Inchanting Bellamy revives in you  'Tis thine resistless the superior art  To search the soul and trace the various heart  With native force with unaffected ease  To form the yielding passions as you please  Oldmixon's  A Lady celebrated for singing  charms by melody imprest  May gently touch the songenamour'd breast  But transient raptures must attend the wound  Where the light arrow is convey'd by sound  Or should Mechel  A Dancer then in SmockAlley Theatre  all languishing advance  Her limbs display'd in ev'ry maze of dance  The soul untouch'd she captivates the sight  But breathing wit with judgment must unite  To give the man of reason unconfin'd delight  On a very young  LADY  SEE how the buds and blossoms shoot  How sweet will be the summer fruit  Let us behold the infant rose  How fragrant when its beauty blows  The morning smiles serenely gay  How bright will be the promis'd day  Contemplate next the charming maid  In early innocence array'd  If in the morning of her years  A lustre so intense appears  When time shall point her noontide rays  When her meridian charms shall blaze  None but the eagleey'd must gaze  An  INVITATION  Including the Characters of the particu∣lar Company that frequented Mr Bux∣ton's elegant Country House at Wes∣ton The Family intending for London  COME  Daphne  as the widow'd turtle true  Foremost in grief conduct the mournful crew  Come  Delia  beauteous as the newborn spring  With song more soft than raptur'd angels sing  Let  Thyrsis  in the bloom of summer's pride  With folded arms walk pensive by her side  Clarinda  come like rosy morning fair  Thy form as beauteous as thy heart's sincere  On her shall  Cimon  gaze with rude delight  Till polish'd by her charms he grows polite  Dorinda  nexther gay good humour fled  With silent steps and griefdejected head  Palemon  see his tuneless harp unstrung  Is on the willow boughs neglected hung  Come  Coelia  sigh'd for by unnumber'd swains  Rosetta  pride of the extended plains  With  Phillis  whose unripen'd charms display  A dawn that promises the future day  With cypress crown'd to Weston's groves repair  The conscious shades shall witness our despair  To vales and lawns and woodlands late so gay  Where in sweet converse we were wont to stray  The joys we've lost in plaintive numbers tell  And bid the social seat a long farewel  FANNY  of the  DALE  I  LET the declining damask rose  With envious grief look pale  The summer bloom more freely glows  In Fanny of the dale  II  Is there a sweet that decks the field  Or scents the morning gale  Can such a vernal fragrance yield  As Fanny of the dale  III  The painted belles at court rever'd  Look lifeless cold and stale  How faint their beauties when compar'd  With Fanny of the dale  IV  The willow binds Pastora's brows  Her fond advances fail  For Damon pours his warmest vows  To Fanny of the dale  V  Might honest truth at last succeed  And artless love prevail  Thrice happy cou'd he tune his reed  With Fanny of the dale  To Mr  K    I  YES Colin 'tis granted you flutter in lace  You whisper and dance with the fair  But Merit advances 'tis yours to give place  Stand off and at distance revere  Nor teize the sweet maid with your jargon of chat  By her side as you saunter along  Your  taste  your  complexion  your  this  and your  that  Nor lisp out the end of your song  II  For folly and fashion you barter good sense  If sense ever fell to your share  'Tis enough you could pert  petit maitre  com∣mence  Laughloiterand lie with an air  No end you can answer affections you've none  Made
