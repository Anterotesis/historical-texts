battle to guard the fighting hero from disgrace than in the private commerce of the world to ward off that littleness of soul which leads by steps imperceptible to all the base train of the inferior passions and  by which the too timid mind is betrayed into a servility derogatory to the dignity of human natureyet is it a virtue of no necessity in a situation such as mine a situation which removes even from cowardice itself the sting of ignominyfor surely that Courage may easily be dispensed with which would rather raise disgust than admiration Indeed it is the peculiar privilege of an author to rob terror of contempt and pusillanimity of reproach  Here let me rest  and snatch myself while yet I am able from the fascination of EGOTISMa monster who has more votaries than ever did homage to

universally contemned and his worship even by his followers never mentioned but with abhorrence  In addressing you jointly I mean but to mark the generous sentiments by  which liberal criticism to the utter annihilation of envy jealousy and all selfish views ought to be distinguished  I have the honour to be GENTLEMEN Your most obedient humble servant *** ****  PREFACE  IN the republic of letters there is no member of such inferior rank or who is so much disdained by his brethren of the quill as the humble Novelist nor is his fate less hard in the world at large since among the whole class of writers perhaps not one can be named of whom the votaries are more numerous but less respectable  Yet while in the annals of those few of our predecessors to whom this species of writing is indebted for being saved from contempt and rescued from depravity we can trace such names as Rousseau Johnson  However superior the capacities in which these great writers deserve to be considered they must pardon me that for the dignity of my subject I here rank the authors of Rasselas and Elo√Øse as Novelists  Marivaux Fielding Richardson and Smollet no man need blush at  starting from the same post though many nay most men may sigh at finding themselves distanced  The following letters are presented to the publicfor such by novel writers novel readers will be calledwith a very singular mixture of timidity and confidence resulting from the peculiar situation of the editor who though trembling for their success from a consciousness of their imperfections yet fears not being involved in their disgrace while happily wrapped up in a mantle of impenetrable obscurity  To draw characters from nature though not from life and to mark the manners of the times is the attempted plan of the following letters For this purpose a young female educated in the most secluded retirement makes at the age of seventeen her first appearance upon the great and busy stage of life with a virtuous mind a cultivated understanding and a feeling heart her ignorance of the forms and inexperience in the manners of the world occasion all the little incidents which these volumes record and which form the natural progression of the life of a young woman of obscure birth but conspicuous beauty for the first six months after her  Entrance into the World  Perhaps were it possible to effect the total extirpation of novels our young ladies in general  and boardingschool damsels in particular might profit from their annihilation but since the distemper they have spread seems incurable since their contagion bids defiance to the medicine of advice or reprehension and since they are found to baffle all the mental art of physic save what is prescribed by the slow regimen of Time and bitter diet of Experience surely all attempts to contribute to the number of those which may be read if not with advantage at least without injury ought rather to be encouraged than contemned  Let me therefore prepare for dsiappointment those who in the perusal of these sheets entertain the gentle expectation of being transported to the fantastic regions of Romance where Fiction is coloured by all the gay tints of luxurious Imagination where Reason is an outcast and where the sublimity of  the Marvellous  rejects all aid from sober Probability The heroine of these memoirs young artless and inexperienced is  No faultless Monster that the World ne'er saw  but the offspring of Nature and of Nature in her simplest attire  In all the Arts the value of copies can only be proportioned to the scarceness of originals among sculptors and painters a fine statue or a beautiful picture of some great master may deservedly employ the imitative talents of younger and inferior artists that their appropriation to  one spot may not wholly prevent the more general expansion of their excellence but among authors the reverse is the case since the noblest productions of literature are almost equally attainable with the meanest In books therefore imitation cannot be shunned too sedulously for the very perfection of a model which is frequently seen serves but more forcibly to mark the inferiority of a copy  To avoid what is common without adopting what is unnatural must limit the ambition of the vulgar herd of authors however zealous therefore my veneration of the great writers I have mentioned however may feel myself enlightened by the knowledge of Johnson charmed with the eloquence of Rousseau softened by the pathetic powers of Richardson and exhilarated by the wit of Fielding and humour of Smollet I yet presume not to attempt pursuing the same ground which they have tracked whence though they may have cleared the weeds they have also culled the flowers and though they have rendered the path plain they have left it barren  The candour of my readers I have not the impertinence to doubt and to their indulgence I am sensible I have no claim I have therefore only to entreat that my own words may not pronounce my condemnation and that what I have here ventured to say in regard to imitation may be understood as it is meant in a general  sense and not be imputed to an opinion of my own originality which I have not the vanity the folly or the blindness to entertain  Whatever may be the fate of these letters the editor is satisfied they will meet with justice and commits them to the press though hopeless of fame yet not regardless of censure  EVELINA  LETTER I  Lady Howard to the Rev Mr Villars  Howard Grove  CAN there my good Sir be any thing more painful to a friendly mind than a necessity of communicating disagreeable intelligence Indeed it is sometimes difficult to determine whether the relator or the receiver of evil tidings is most to be pitied  I have just had a letter from Madame Duval she is totally at a loss in what manner to behave she seems desirous to repair the wrongs she has done yet wishes the world to believe her blameless She would fain cast upon another the odium of those misfortunes for which she alone is answerable Her letter is violent sometimes abusive and that of  youyou  to whom she is under obligations which are greater even than her faults but to whose advice she wickedly imputes all the sufferings of her much injured daughter the late Lady Belmont The chief purport of her writing I will acquaint you with the letter itself is not worthy your notice  She tells me that she has for many years past been in continual expectation of making a journey to England which prevented her writing for information concerning this melancholy subject by giving her hopes of making personal enquiries but family occurrences have still detained her in France which country she now sees no prospect of quitting She has therefore lately used her utmost endeavours to obtain a faithful account of whatever related to her  illadvised  daughter the result of which giving her  some reason  to apprehend that upon her death bed she bequeathed an infant orphan to the world she most graciously says that if  you  with whom  she understands  the child is placed will procure authentic proofs of its relationship to her you may send it to Paris where she will properly provide for it  This woman is undoubtedly at length conscious of her most unnatural conduct it is evident from her writing that she is still as vulgar and illiterate as when her first husband Mr Evelyn had the weakness to marry her nor does she at all apologise for addressing herself to me though I was only once in her company  This letter has excited in my daughter Mirvan a strong desire to be informed of the motives which induced Madame Duval to abandon the unfortunate Lady Belmont at a time when a mother's protection was so peculiarly necessary for her peace and her reputation Notwithstanding I was personally acquainted with all the parties concerned in that affair the subject always appeared of too delicate a nature to be spoken of with the principals I cannot therefore satisfy Mrs Mirvan otherwise than by applying to you  By saying that you  may  send the child Madame Duval aims at  conferring  where she most  owes  obligation I pretend not to give you advice you to whose generous protection this helpless orphan is indebted for every thing are the best and only judge of what she ought to do but I am much concerned for the trouble and uneasiness which this unworthy woman may occasion you  My daughter and my grandchild join with me in desiring to be most kindly remembered to the amiable girl and they bid me remind you that the annual visit to Howard Grove which we were formerly promised has been discontinued for more than four years  I am dear Sir with great regard Your most obedient servant and friend M HOWARD  LETTER II  Mr Villars to Lady Howard  Berry Hill Dorsetshire  YOUR Ladyship did but too well foresee the perplexity and uneasiness of which Madame Duval's letter has been productive However I ought rather to be thankful that I have so many years remained unmolested than repine at my present embarrassment since it proves at least that this wretched woman is at length awakened to remorse  In regard to my answer I must humbly request your Ladyship to write to this effect  "That I would not upon any account intentionally offend Madame Duval but that I have weighty nay unanswerable  reasons for detaining her granddaughter at present in England the principal of which is that it was the earnest desire of one to whose will she owes implicit duty Madame Duval may be assured that she meets with the utmost attention and tenderness that her education however short of my wishes almost exceeds my abilities and that I flatter myself when the time arrives that she shall pay her duty to her grandmother Madame Duval will find no reason to be dissatisfied with what has been done for her"  Your Ladyship will not I am sure be surprised at this answer Madame Duval is by no means a proper companion or guardian for a young woman she is at once uneducated and unprincipled ungentle in her temper and unamiable in her manners I have long known that she has persuaded herself to harbour an aversion for meUnhappy woman I can only regard her as an object of pity  I dare not hesitate at a request from Mrs Mirvan yet in complying with it I shall for her own sake be as concise as I possibly can since the cruel transactions which preceded the birth of my ward can afford no entertainment to a mind so humane as her's  Your Ladyship may probably have heard that I had the honour to accompany Mr Evelyn the grandfather of my young charge when upon his travels in capacity of tutor His unhappy marriage immediately upon his return to England with Madame Duval then a waitinggirl at a tavern contrary to the advice and entreaties of all his friends among whom I was myself the most urgent to dissuade him induced him to abandon his native land and fix his abode in France Thither he was followed by shame and repentance feelings  which his heart was not formed to support for notwithstanding he had been too weak to resist the allurements of beauty which nature though a niggard to her of every other boon had with a lavish hand bestowed on his wife yet he was a young man of excellent character and till thus unaccountably infatuated of unblemished conduct He survived this illjudged marriage but two years Upon his deathbed with an unsteady hand he wrote me the following note  "My friend forget your resentment in favour of your humanitya father trembling for the welfare of his child bequeaths her to your careO Villars hear pity and relieve me"  Had my circumstances permitted I should have answered these words by an immediate journey to Paris but I was obliged to act by the agency of a friend who was upon the spot and present at the opening of the will  Mr Evelyn left to me a legacy of a thousand pounds and the sole guardianship of his daughter's person till her eighteenth year conjuring me in the most affecting terms to take the charge of her education till she was able to act with propriety for herself but in regard to fortune he left her wholly dependent on her mother to whose tenderness he earnestly recommended her  Thus though he would not to a woman lowbred and illiberal as Mrs Evelyn trust the mind and morals of his daughter he nevertheless thought proper to secure to her that respect and duty which from her own child were certainly her due but unhappily it never occurred to him that the mother on her part could fail in affection or justice  Miss Evelyn Madam from the second to the eighteenth year of her life was brought up under  my care and except when at school under my roof I need not speak to your Ladyship of the virtues of that excellent young creature She loved me as her father nor was Mrs Villars less valued by her while to me she became so dear that her loss was little less afflicting to me than that which I have since sustained of Mrs Villars herself  At that period of her life we parted her mother then married to Monsieur Duval sent for her to Paris How often have I since regretted that I did not accompany her thither protected and supported by me the misery and disgrace which awaited her might perhaps have been avoided Butto be brief Madame Duval at the instigation of her husband earnestly or rather tyrannically endeavoured to effect an union between Miss Evelyn and one of his nephews And when she found her power inadequate to her attempt enraged at her noncompliance she treated her with the grossest unkindness and threatened her with poverty and ruin  Miss Evelyn to whom wrath and violence had hitherto been strangers soon grew weary of this usage and rashly and without a witness consented to a private marriage with Sir John Belmont a very profligate young man who had but too successfully found means to insinuate himself into her favour He promised to conduct her to Englandhe didO Madam you know the restDisappointed of the fortune he expected by the inexorable rancour of the Duvals he infamously burnt the certificate of their marriage and denied that they had ever been united  She flew to me for protection With what mixed transports of joy and anguish did I again  see her By my advice she endeavoured to procure proofs of her marriagebut in vain her credulity had been no match for his art  Every body believed her innocent from the guiltless tenor of her unspotted youth and from the known libertinism of her barbarous betrayer Yet her sufferings were too acute for her tender frame and the same moment that gave birth to her infant put an end at once to the sorrows and the life of its mother  The rage of Madame Duval at her elopement abated not while this injured victim of cruelty yet drew breath She probably intended in time to have pardoned her but time was not allowed When she was informed of her death I have been told that the agonies of grief and remorse with which she was seized occasioned her a severe fit of illness But from the time of her recovery to the date of her letter to your Ladyship I had never heard that she manifested any desire to be made acquainted with the circumstances which attended the death of LadyBelmont and the birth of her helpless child  That child Madam shall never while life is lent me know the loss she has sustained I have cherished succoured and supported her from her earliest infancy to her sixteenth year and so amply has she repaid my care and affection that my fondest wish is now bounded in the desire of bestowing her on one who may be sensible of her worth and then sinking to eternal rest in her arms  Thus it has happened that the education of the father daughter and granddaughter has devolved on me What infinite misery have the two first caused me Should the fate of the dear survivor be  equally adverse how wretched will be the end of my caresthe end of my days  Even had Madame Duval merited the charge she claims I fear my fortitude would have been unequal to such a parting but being such as she is not only my affection but my humanity recoils at the barbarous idea of deserting the sacred trust reposed in me Indeed I could but ill support her former yearly visits to the respectable mansion at Howard Grove pardon me dear Madam and do not think me insensible of the honour which your Ladyship's condescension confers upon us both but so deep is the impression which the misfortunes of her mother have made on my heart that she does not even for a moment quit my sight without exciting apprehensions and terrors which almost overpower me Such Madam is my tenderness and such my weakness But she is the only tie I have upon earth and I trust to your Ladyship's goodness not to judge of my feelings with severity  I beg leave to present my humble respects to Mrs and Miss Mirvan and have the honour to be  Madam  Your Ladyship's most obedient and most humble servant ARTHUR VILLARS  LETTER III  Written some months after the last  Lady Howard to the Rev Mr Villars  Howard Grove  March  Dear and Rev Sir  YOUR last letter gave me infinite pleasure after so long and tedious an illness how grateful to yourself and to your friends must be your returning health You have the hearty wishes of every individual of this place for its continuance and increase  Will you not think I talk advantage of your acknowledged recovery if I once more venture to mention your pupil and Howard Grove together Yet you must remember the patience with which we submitted to your desire of not parting with her during the bad state of your health though it was with much reluctance we forbore to solicit her company My granddaughter in particular has scarce been able to repress her eagerness to again meet the friend of her infancy and for my own part it is very strongly my wish to manifest the regard which I had for the unfortunate Lady Belmont by proving serviceable to her child which seems to me the best respect that can be paid to her memory Permit me therefore to lay before you a plan which Mrs Mirvan and I have formed in consequence of your restoration to health  I would not frighten youbut do you think you could bear to part with your young companion for two or three months Mrs Mirvan proposes to  spend the ensuing spring in London whither for the first time my grandchild will accompany her Now my good friend it is very earnestly their wish to enlarge and enliven their party by the addition of your amiable ward who would share equally with her own daughter the care and attention of Mrs Mirvan Do not start at this proposal it is time that she should see something of the world When young people are too rigidly sequestered from it their lively and romantic imaginations paint it to them as a paradise of which they have been beguiled but when they are shown it properly and in due time they see it such as it really is equally shared by pain and pleasure hope and disappointment  You have nothing to apprehend from her meeting with Sir John Belmont as that abandoned man is now abroad and not expected home this year  Well my good Sir what say you to our scheme I hope it will meet with your approbation but if it should not be assured I can never be displeased at any decision made by one who is so much respected and esteemed as yourself by  Dear Sir  Your most faithful humble servant M HOWARD  LETTER IV  Mr Villars to Lady Howard  Berry Hill  March  I AM grieved Madam to appear obstinate and I blush to incur the imputation of selfishness In detaining my young charge thus long with myself in the country I consulted not solely my own inclination Destined in all probability to possess a very moderate fortune I wished to contract her views to something within it The mind is but too naturally prone to pleasure but too easily yielded to dissipation it has been my study to guard her against their delusions by preparing her to expectand to despise them But the time draws on for experience and observation to take place of instruction if I have in some measure rendered her capable of using the one with discretion and making the other with improvement I shall rejoice myself with the assurance of having largely contributed to her welfare She is now of an age that happiness is eager to attendlet her then enjoy it I commit her to the protection of your Ladyship and only hope she may be found worthy half the goodness I am satisfied she will meet with at your hospitable mansion  Thus far Madam I chearfully submit to your desire In confiding my ward to the care of Lady Howard I can feel no uneasiness from her absence but what will arise from the loss of her company since I shall be as well convinced of her safety as if she were under my own roofbut can your Ladyship be serious in proposing to introduce her to the gaieties of a London life Permit me to  ask for what end or what purpose A youthful mind is seldom totally free from ambition to curb that is the first step to contentment since to diminish expectation is to increase enjoyment I apprehend nothing more than too much raising her hopes and her views which the natural vivacity of her disposition would render but too easy to effect The town acquaintance of Mrs Mirvan are all in the circle of high life this artless young creature with too much beauty to escape notice has too much sensibility to be indifferent to it but she has too little wealth to be sought with propriety by men of the fashionable world  Consider Madam the peculiar cruelty of her situation only child of a wealthy baronet whose person she has never seen whose character she has reason to abhor and whose name she is forbidden to claim entitled as she is to lawfully inherit his fortune and estate is there any probability that he will  properly  own her And while he continues to persevere in disavowing his marriage with Miss Evelyn she shall never at the expence of her mother's honour receive a part of her right as the donation of his bounty  And as to Mr Evelyn's estate I have no doubt but that Madame Duval and her relations will dispose of it among themselves  It seems therefore as if this deserted child though legally heiress to two large fortunes must owe all her rational expectations to adoption and friendship Yet her income will be such as may make her happy if she is disposed to be so in private life though it will by no means allow her to enjoy the luxury of a London fine lady  Let Miss Mirvan then Madam shine in all the splendor of high life but suffer my child still  to enjoy the pleasures of humble retirement with a mind to which greater views are unknown  I hope this reasoning will be honoured with your approbation and I have yet another motive that has some weight with me I would not willingly give offence to any human being and surely Madame Duval might accuse me of injustice if while I refuse to let her granddaughter wait upon her I consent to her joining a party of pleasure to London  In sending her to Howard Grove not one of these scruples arise and therefore Mrs Clinton a most worthy woman formerly her nurse and now my housekeeper shall attend her thither next week  Though I have always called her by the name of Anville and reported in this neighbourhood that her father my intimate friend left her to my guardianship yet I have thought it necessary to let her be herself acquainted with the melancholy circumstances attending her birth for though I am very desirous of guarding her from curiosity and impertinence by concealing her name family and story yet I would not leave it in the power of charce to shock her gentle nature with a tale of so much sorrow  You must not Madam expect too much from my pupil She is quite a little rustic and knows nothing of the world and though her education has been the best I could bestow in this retired place to which Dorchester the nearest town is seven miles distant yet I shall not be surprised if you should discover in her a thousand deficiencies of which I have never dreamt She must be very much altered since she was last at Howard Grovebut I will say nothing of her I leave her to your  Ladyship's own observations of which I beg a faithful relation and am  Dear Madam  with great respect Your obedient and most humble servant ARTHUR VILLARS  LETTER V  Mr Villars to Lady Howard  March  Dear Madam  THIS letter will be delivered to you by my childthe child of my adoptionmy affection Unblest with one natural friend she merits a thousand I send her to you innocent as an angel and artless as purity itself and I send you with her the heart of your friend the only hope he has on earth the subject of his tenderest thoughts and the object of his latest cares She is one Madam for whom alone I have lately wished to live and she is one whom to serve I would with transport die Restore her but to me all innocence as you receive her and the fondest hope of my heart will be amply gratified  A VILLARS  LETTER VI  Lady Howard to the Rev Mr Villars  Howard Grove  Dear and Rev Sir  THE solemn manner in which you have committed your child to my care has in some measure dampt the pleasure which I receive from the trust as it makes me fear that you suffer from your compliance in which case I shall very sincerely blame myself for the earnestness with which I have requested this favour but remember my good Sir she is within a few days summons and be assured I will not detain her a moment longer than you wish  You desire my opinion of her  She is a little angel I cannot wonder that you sought to monopolize her Neither ought you at finding it impossible  Her face and person answer my most refined ideas of complete beauty and this though a subject of praise less important to you or to me than any other is yet so striking it is not possible to pass it unnoticed Had I not known from whom she received her education I should at first sight of so perfect a face have been in pain for her understanding since it has been long and justly remarked that folly has ever sought alliance with beauty  She has the same gentleness in her manners the same natural grace in her motions that I formerly so much admired in her mother Her character seems truly ingenuous and simple and at the  same time that nature hus blessed her with an excellent understanding and great quickness of parts she has a certain air of inexperience and innocency that is extremely interesting  You have no reason to regret the retirement in which she has lived since that politeness which is acquired by an acquaintance with high life is in her so well supplied by a natural desire of obliging joined to a deportment infinitely engaging  I observe with great satisfaction a growing affection between this amiable girl and my granddaughter whose heart is as free from selfishness or conceit as that of her young friend is from all guile Their attachment may be mutually useful since much is to be expected from emulation where nothing is to be feared from envy I would have them love each other as sisters and reciprocally supply the place of that tender and happy relationship to which neither of them have a natural claim  Be satisfied my good Sir that your child shall meet with the same attention as our own We all join in most hearty wishes for your health and happiness and in returning our sincere thanks for the favour you have conserred on us  I am Dear Sir Your most faithful servant M HOWARD  LETTER VII  Lady Howard to the Rev Mr Villars  Howard Grove  March  BE not alarmed my worthy friend at my so speedily troubling you again I seldom use the ceremony of waiting for answers or writing with any regularity and I have at present immediate occasion for begging your patience  Mrs Mirvan has just received a letter from her longabsent husband containing the welcome news of his hoping to reach London by the beginning of next week My daughter and the Captain have been separated almost seven years and it would therefore be needless to say what joy surprise and consequently confusion his at present unexpected return has caused at Howard Grove Mrs Mirvan you cannot doubt will go instantly to town to meet him her daughter is under a thousand obligations to attend her I grieve that her mother cannot  And now my good Sir I almost blush to proceedbut tell me may I askwill you permitthat your child may accompany them Do not think us unreasonable but consider the many inducements which conspire to make London the happiest place at present she can be in The joyful occasion of the journey the gaiety of the whole party opposed to the dull life she must lead if left here with a solitary old woman for her sole companion while she so well knows the chearfulness and felicity enjoyed by the rest of the familyare circumstances that seem to merit  your consideration Mrs Mirvan desires me to assure you that one week is all she asks as she is certain that the Captain who hates London will be eager to revisit Howard Grove and Maria is so very earnest in wishing to have the company of her friend that if you are inexorable she will be deprived of half the pleasure she otherwise hopes to receive  However I will not my good Sir deceive you into an opinion that they intend to live in a retired manner as that cannot be fairly expected But you have no reason to be uneasy concerning Madame Duval she has no correspondent in England and only gains intelligence by common report She must be a stranger to the name your child bears and even should she hear of this excursion so short a time as a week or less spent in town upon so particular an occasion though previous to their meeting cannot be construed into disrespect to herself  Mrs Mirvan desires me to assure you that if you will oblige her her  two  children shall equally share her time and her attention She has sent a commission to a friend in town to take a house for her and while she waits for an answer concerning it I shall for one from you to our petition However your child is writing herself and that I doubt not will more avail than all we can possibly urge  My daughter desires her best compliments to you  if  she says you will grant her request but  not else  Adieu my dear Sirwe all hope every thing from your goodness  M HOWARD  LETTER VIII  Evelina to the Rev Mr Villars  Howard Grove  March  THIS house seems to be the house of joy every face wears a smile and a laugh is at every body's service It is quite amusing to walk about and see the general confusion a room leading to the garden is fitting up for Captain Mirvan's study Lady Howard does not sit a moment in a place Miss Mirvan is making caps every body so busysuch flying from room to roomso many orders given and retracted and given againnothing but hurry and perturbation  Well but my dear Sir I am desired to make a request to you I hope you will not think me an incroacher Lady Howard insists upon my writingyet I hardly know how to go on a petition implies a wantand have you left me one No indeed  I am half ashamed of myself for beginning this letter But these dear ladies are so pressingI cannot for my life resist wishing for the pleasures they offer meprovided you do not disapprove them  They are to make a very short stay in town The captain will meet them in a day or two Mrs Mirvan and her sweet daughter both gowhat a happy party Yet I am not  very  eager to accompany them at least I shall be very well contented to remain where I am if you desire that I should  Assured my dearest Sir of your goodness your bounty and your indulgent kindness ought I to form a wish that has not your sanction Decide for me therefore without the least apprehension that I shall be uneasy or discontented While I am yet in suspense perhaps I may  hope  but I am most certain that when you have once determined I shall not repine  They tell me that London is now in full splendour Two Playhouses are openthe OperaHouseRanelaghthe PantheonYou see I have learned all their names However pray don't suppose that I make any point of going for I shall hardly sigh to see them depart without me though I shall probably never meet with such another opportunity And indeed their domestic happiness will be so greatit is natural to wish to partake of it  I believe I am bewitched I made a resolution when I began that I would not be urgent but my penor rather my thoughts will not suffer me to keep itfor I acknowledge I must acknowledge I cannot help wishing for your permission  I almost repent already that I have made this confession pray forget that you have read it if this journey is displeasing to you But I will not write any longer for the more I think of this affair the less indifferent to it I find myself  Adieu my most honoured most reverenced most beloved father for by what other name can I call you I have no happiness or sorrow no hope or fear but what your kindness bestows or your displeasure may cause You will not I am sure send a refusal without reasons unanswerable and  therefore I shall chearfully acquiesce Yet I hopeI hope you will be able to permit me to go  I am With the utmost affection gratitude and duty Your EVELINA  I cannot to  you  sign  Anville  and what other name may I claim  LETTER IX  Mr Villars to Evelina  BerryHill  March    TO resist the urgency of entreaty is a power which I have not yet acquired I aim not at an authority which deprives you of liberty yet I would fain guide myself by a prudence which should save me the pangs of repentance Your impatience to fly to a place which your imagination has painted to you in colours so attractive surprizes me not I have only to hope that the liveliness of your fancy may not deceive you to refuse would be to raise it still higher To see my Evelina happy is to see myself without a wish go then my child and may that Heaven which alone can direct preserve and strengthen you To That my love will I daily offer prayers for your felicity O may it guard watch over you defend you from danger save you from distress and keep vice as distant from your person as from your heart And to Me  may it grant the ultimate blessing of closing these aged eyes in the arms of one so dearso deservedly beloved  ARTHUR VILLARS  LETTER X  Evelina to the Rev Mr Villars  QueenAnnStreet London  Saturday April  THIS

rest till she consented to go her chief objection was to our dress for we have had no time to  Londonize  ourselves but we teized her into compliance and so we are to sit in some obscure place that she may not be seen As to me I should be alike unknown in the most conspicuous or most private part of the house  I can write no more now I have hardly time to breatheonly just this the houses and streets are not quite so superb as I expected However I have seen nothing yet so I ought not to judge  Well adieu my dearest Sir for the present I could not forbear writing a few words instantly on my arrival though I suppose my letter of thanks for your consent is still on the road  Saturday Night  O my dear Sir in what raptures am I returned Well may Mr Garrick be so celebrated so universally admiredI had not any idea of so great a performer  Such ease such vivacity in his manner such grace in his motions such fire and meaning in his eyesI could hardly believe he had studied a written part for every word seemed spoke from the impulse of the moment  His actionat once so graceful and so freehis voiceso clear so melodious yet so wonderfully various in its tonessuch animationevery look  speaks  I would have given the world to have had the whole play acted over again And when he dancedO how I envied Clarinda I almost wished to have jumped on the stage and joined them  I am afraid you will think me mad so I won't say any more yet I really believe Mr Garrick would make you mad too if you could see him I intend to ask Mrs Mirvan to go to the play every night while we stay in town She is extremely kind to me and Maria her charming daughter is the sweetest girl in the world  I shall write to you every evening all that passes in the day and that in the same manner as if I could see I should tell you  Sunday  This morning we went to Portland chapel and afterwards we walked in the Mall in St James's Park which by no means answered my expectations it is a long straight walk of dirty gravel very uneasy to the feet and at each end instead of an open prospect nothing is to be seen but houses  built of brick When Mrs Mirvan pointed out the  Palace  to meI think I was never much more surprised  However the walk was very agreeable to us every body looked gay and seemed pleased and the ladies were so much dressed that Miss Mirvan and I could do nothing but look at them Mrs Mirvan met several of her friends No wonder for I never saw so many people assembled together before I looked about for some of  my  acquaintance but in vain for I saw not one person that I knew which is very odd for all the world seemed there  Mrs Mirvan says we are not to walk in the Park again next Sunday even if we should be in town because there is better company in Kensington Gardens But really if you had seen how much every body was dressed you would not think that possible  We are to go this evening to a private ball given by Mrs Stanley a very fashionable lady of Mrs Mirvan's acquaintance  We have been a  shopping  as Mrs Mirvan calls it all this morning to buy silks caps gauzes and so forth  The shops are really very entertaining especially the mercers there seem to be six or seven men belonging to each shop and every one took care by bowing and smirking to be noticed we were conducted from one to another and carried from room to room with so much ceremony that at first I was almost afraid to follow  I thought I should never have chosen a silk for they produced so many I knew not which to fix upon and they recommended them all so strongly that I fancy they thought I only wanted persuasion  to buy every thing they shewed me And indeed they took so much trouble that I was almost ashamed I could not  At the milliners the ladies we met were so much dressed that I should rather have imagined they were making visits than purchases But what most diverted me was that we were more frequently served by men than by women and such men so finical so affected they seemed to understand every part of a woman's dress better than we do ourselves and they recommended caps and ribbands with an air of so much importance that I wished to ask them how long they had left off wearing them  The dispatch with which they work in these great shops is amazing for they have promised me a compleat suit of linen against the evening  I have just had my hair dressed You can't think how oddly my head feels full of powder and black pins and a great  cushion  on the top of it I believe you would hardly know me for my face looks quite different from what it did before my hair was dressed When I shall be able to make use of a comb for myself I cannot tell for my hair is so much entangled  frizzled  they call it that I fear it will be very difficult  I am half afraid of this ball tonight for you know I have never danced but at school however Miss Mirvan says there is nothing in it Yet I wish it was over  Adieu my dear Sir pray excuse the wretched stuff I write perhaps I may improve by being in this town and then my letters will be less unworthy your reading Mean time I am  Your dutiful and affectionate though unpolished EVELINA  Poor Miss Mirvan cannot wear one of the caps she made because they dress her hair too large for them  LETTER XI  Evelina in continuation  QueenAnneStreet  April Tuesday morning  I HAVE a vast deal to say and shall give all this morning to my pen As to my plan of writing every evening the adventures of the day I find it impracticable for the diversions here are so very late that if I begin my letters after them I could not go to bed at all  We past a most extraordinary evening A  private  ball this was called so I expected to have seen about four or five couple but Lord my dear Sir I believe I saw half the world Two very large rooms were full of company in one were cards for the elderly ladies and in the other were the dancers My mamma Mirvan for she always calls me her child said she would sit with Maria and me till we were provided with partners and then join the card players  The gentlemen as they passed and repassed looked as if they thought we were quite at their disposal and only waiting for the honour of their commands and they sauntered about in a careless indolent manner as if with a view to keep us in suspense I don't speak of this in regard to Miss Mirvan and myself only but to the ladies in general and I thought it so provoking that I determined in my own mind that far from humouring  such airs I would rather not dance at all than with any one who should seem to think me ready to accept the first partner who would condescend to take me  Not long after a young man who had for some time looked at us with a kind of negligent impertinence advanced on tiptoe towards me he had a set smile on his face and his dress was so foppish that I really believe he even wished to be stared at and yet he was very ugly  Bowing almost to the ground with a sort of swing and waving his hand with the greatest conceit after a short and silly pause he said  "Madammay I presume"  and stopt offering to take my hand I drew it back but could scarce forbear laughing  "Allow me Madam"  continued he affectedly breaking off every half moment  "the honour and happinessif I am not so unhappy as to address you too lateto have the happiness and honour"  Again he would have taken my hand but bowing my head I begged to be excused and turned to Miss Mirvan to conceal my laughter He then desired to know if I had already engaged myself to some more fortunate man I said No and that I believed I should not dance at all He would keep himself he told me disengaged in hopes I should relent and then uttering some ridiculous speeches of sorrow and disappointment though his face still wore the same invariable smile he retreated  It so happened as we have since recollected that during this little dialogue Mrs Mirvan was conversing with the lady of the house And very soon after another gentleman who seemed about sixandtwenty years old gayly but not soppishly  dressed and indeed extremely handsome with an air of mixed politeness and gallantry desired to know if I was engaged or would honour him with my hand So he was pleased to say though I am sure I know not what honour he could receive from me but these sort of expressions I find are used as words of course without any distinction of persons or study of propriety  Well I bowed and I am sure I coloured for indeed I was frightened at the thoughts of dancing before so many people all strangers and which was worse  with  a stranger however that was unavoidable for though I looked round the room several times I could not see one person that I knew And so he took my hand and led me to join in the dance  The minuets were over before we arrived for we were kept late by the milliner's making us wait for our things  He seemed very desirous of entering into conversation with me but I was seized with such a panic that I could hardly speak a word and nothing but the shame of so soon changing my mind prevented my returning to my seat and declining to dance at all  He appeared to be surprised at my terror which I believe was but too apparent however he asked no questions though I fear he must think it very odd for I did not choose to tell him it was owing to my never before dancing but with a schoolgirl  His conversation was sensible and spirited his air and address were open and noble his manners gentle attentive and infinitely engaging his person is all elegance and his countenance the most animated and expressive I have ever seen  In a short time we were joined by Miss Mirvan who stood next couple to us But how was I startled when she whispered me that my partner was a nobleman This gave me a new alarm how will he be provoked thought I when he finds what a simple rustic he has honoured with his choice one whose ignorance of the world makes her perpetually fear doing something wrong  That he should be so much my superior every way quite disconcerted me and you will suppose my spirits were not much raised when I heard a lady in passing us say  "This is the most difficult dance I ever saw"  "O dear then"  cried Maria to her partner  "with your leave I'll sit down till the next"  "So will I too then"  cried I  "for I am sure I can hardly stand"  "But you must speak to your partner first"  answered she for he had turned aside to talk with some gentlemen However I had not sufficient courage to address him and so away we all three tript and seated ourselves at another end of the room  But unfortunately for me Miss Mirvan soon after suffered herself to be prevailed upon to attempt the dance and just as she rose to go she cried  "My dear yonder is your partner Lord Orville walking about the room in search of you"  "Don't leave me then dear girl"  cried I but she was obliged to go And then I was more uneasy than ever I would have given the world to have seen Mrs Mirvan and begged of her to make my apologies for what thought I can I possibly say for myself in excuse for running away he must either conclude me a fool or half mad for any one brought up in the great world and  accustomed to its ways can have no idea of such sort of fears as mine  I was in the utmost confusion when I observed that he was every where seeking me with apparent perplexity and surprise but when at last I saw him move towards the place where I sat I was ready to sink with shame and distress I found it absolutely impossible to keep my seat because I could not think of a word to say for myself and so I rose and walked hastily towards the cardroom resolving to stay with Mrs Mirvan the rest of the evening and not to dance at all But before I could find her Lord Orville saw and approached me  He begged to know if I was not well You may easily imagine how much I was confused I made no answer but hung my head like a fool and looked on my fan  He then with an air the most respectfully serious asked if he had been so unhappy as to offend me  "No indeed"  cried I and then in hopes of changing the discourse and preventing his further inquiries I desired to know if he had seen the young lady who had been conversing with me  Nobut would I honour him with my commands to see for her  "O by no means"  Was there any other person with whom I wished to speak  I said  no  before I knew I had answered at all  Should he have the pleasure of bringing me any refreshment  I bowed almost involuntarily And away he flew  I was quite ashamed at being so troublesome and so much  above  myself as these seeming airs made me appear but indeed I was too much confused to think or act with any consistency  If he had not been swift as lightning I don't know whether I should not have stolen away again but he returned in a moment When I had drank a glass of lemonade he hoped he said that I would again honour him with my hand as a new dance was just begun I had not the presence of mind to say a single word and so I let him once more lead me to the place I had left  Shocked to find how silly how childish a part I had acted my former fears of dancing before such a company and with such a partner returned more forcibly than ever I suppose he perceived my uneasiness for he intreated me to sit down again if dancing was disagreeable to me But I was quite satisfied with the folly I had already shewn and therefore declined his offer though I was really scarce able to stand  Under such conscious disadvantages you may easily imagine my dear Sir how ill I acquitted myself But though I both expected and deserved to find him very much mortified and displeased at his ill fortune in the choice he had made yet to my very great relief he appeared to be even contented and very much assisted and encouraged me These people in high life have too much presence of mind I believe to  seem  disconcerted or out of humour however they may feel for had I been the person of the most consequence in the room I could not have met with more attention and respect  When the dance was over seeing me still very much slurried he led me to a seat saying that he  would not suffer me to fatigue myself from politeness  And then if my capacity or even if my spirits had been better in how animated a conver+sation might I have been engaged It was then that I saw the rank of Lord Orville was his least recommendation his understanding and his manners being far more distinguished His remarks upon the company in general were so apt so just so lively I am almost surprised myself that they did not reanimate me but indeed I was too well convinced of the ridiculous part I had myself played before so nice an observer to be able to enjoy his pleasantry so selfcompassion gave me feeling for others Yet I had not the courage to attempt either to defend them or to rally in my turn but listened to him in silent embarrassment  When he found this he changed the subject and talked of public places and public performers but he soon discovered that I was totally ignorant of them  He then very ingeniously turned the discourse to the amusements and occupations of the country  It now struck me that he was resolved to try whether or not I was capable of talking upon  any  subject This put so great a constraint upon my thoughts that I was unable to go further than a monosyllable and not even so far when I could possibly avoid it  We were sitting in this manner he conversing with all gaiety I looking down with all foolishness when that fop who had first asked me to dance with a most ridiculous solemnity approached and after a profound bow or two said  "I  humbly beg pardon Madamand of you too my Lordfor breaking in upon such agreeable conversationwhich must doubtless be much more delectablethan what I have the honour to offerbut"  I interrupted himI blush for my follywith laughing yet I could not help it for added to the man's stately foppishness and he actually took snuff between every three words when I looked round at Lord Orville I saw such extreme surprise in his facethe cause of which appeared so absurd that I could not for my life preserve my gravity  I had not laughed before from the time I had left Miss Mirvan and I had much better have cried then Lord Orville actually stared at me the beau I know not his name looked quite enraged  "RefrainMadam"  said he with an important air  "a few moments refrainI have but a sentence to trouble you withMay I know to what accident I must attribute not having the honour of your hand"  "Accident Sir"  repeated I much astonished  "Yes accident Madamfor surelyI must take the liberty to observepardon me Madam it ought to be no common onethat should tempt a ladyso young a one tooto be guilty of ill manners"  A confused idea now for the first time entered my head something I had heard of the rules of assemblies but I was never at one beforeI have only danced at schooland so giddy and heedless I was that I had not once considered the impropriety of refusing one partner and afterwards accepting another I was thunderstruck at  the recollection but while these thoughts were rushing into my head Lord Orville with some warmth said  "This lady Sir is incapable of meriting such an accusation"  The creaturefor I am very angry with himmade a low bow and with a grin the most malicious I ever saw  "My Lord said he far be it from me to  accuse  the lady for having the discernment to distinguish and preferthe superior attractions of your Lordship"  Again he bowed and walked off  Was ever any thing so provoking I was ready to die with shame  "What a coxcomb"  exclaimed Lord Orville while I without knowing what I did rose hastily and moving off  "I can't imagine cried I where Mrs Mirvan has hid herself"  "Give me leave to see"  answered he I bowed and sat down again not daring to meet his eyes for what must he think of me between my blunder and the supposed preference  He returned in a moment and told me that Mrs Mirvan was at cards but would be glad to see me and I went immediately There was but one chair vacant so to my great relief Lord Orville presently left us I then told Mrs Mirvan my disasters and she goodnaturedly blamed herself for not having better instructed me but said she had taken it for granted that I must know such common customs However the man may I think be satisfied with his pretty speech and carry his resentment no farther  In a short time Lord Orville returned I consented with the best grace I could to go down another dance for I had had time to recollect myself and therefore resolved to use some exertion  and if possible appear less a fool than I hitherto had for it occurred to me that insignificant as I was compared to a man of his rank and figure yet since he had been so unfortunate as to make choice of me for a partner why I should endeavour to make the best of it  The dance however was short and he spoke very little so I had no opportunity of putting my resolution in practice He was satisfied I suppose with his former successless efforts to draw me out or rather I fancied he has been inquiring  who I was  This again disconcerted me and the spirits I had determined to exert again failed me Tired ashamed and mortified I begged to sit down till we returned home which we did soon after Lord Orville did me the honour to hand me to the coach talking all the way of the honour  I  had done  him  O these fashionable people  Well my dear Sir was it not a strange evening I could not help being thus particular because to me every thing is so new But it is now time to conclude I am with all love and duty  Your EVELINA  LETTER XII  Evelina in continuation  Tuesday April  THERE is to be no end to the troubles of last night I have this moment between persuasion and laughter gathered from Maria the most curious dialogue that ever I heard You will at first be startled at my vanity but my dear Sir have patience  It must have passed while I was sitting with Mrs Mirvan in the cardroom Maria was taking some refreshment and saw Lord Orville advancing for the same purpose himself but he did not know her though she immediately recollected him Presently after a very gaylooking man stepping hastily up to him cried  "Why my Lord what have you done with your lovely partner"  "  Nothing  "  answered Lord Orville with a smile and a shrug  "By Jove cried the man she is the most beautiful creature I ever saw in my life"  Lord Orville as he well might laughed but answered  "Yes a pretty modestlooking girl"  "O my Lord"  cried the madman  "she is an angel"  "A  silent  one"  returned he  "Why ay my Lord how stands she as to that She looks all intelligence and expression"  "A poor weak girl"  answered Lord Orville shaking his head  "By Jove"  cried the other  "I am glad to hear it"  At that moment the same odious creature who had been my former torment joined them Addressing Lord Orville with great respect he said  "I beg pardon my Lordif I wasas I fear might be the caserather too severe in my censure of the lady who is honoured with your protectionbut my Lord ill breeding is apt to provoke a man"  "Illbreeding"  cried my unknown champion  "impossible that elegant face can never be so vile a mask"  "O Sir as to that"  answered he  "you must allow  me  to judge for though I pay all deference to your opinionin other thingsyet I hope you will grantand I appeal to your Lordship alsothat I am not totally despicable as a judge of good or ill manners"  "I was so wholly ignorant"  said Lord Orville gravely  "of the provocation you might have had that I could not but be surprised at your singular resentment"  "It was far from my intention answered he to offend your Lordship but really for a person who is nobody to give herself such airsI own I could not command my passions For my Lord though I have made diligent enquiryI cannot learn who she is"  "By what I can make out"  cried my defender  "she must be a country parson's daughter"  "He he he very good 'pon honour"  cried the fop  "well so I could have sworn by her manners"  And then delighted at his own wit he laughed and went away as I suppose to repeat it  "But what the deuce is all this  demanded the other  "Why a very foolish affair"  answered Lord Orville  "your Helen first refused this coxcomb and thendanced with me This is all I can gather of it"  "O Orville"  returned he  "you are a happy manBut  illbred  I can never believe it And she looks too sensible to be  ignorant  "  "Whether ignorant or mischievous I will not pretend to determine but certain it is she attended to all  I  could say to her though I have really fatigued myself with fruitless endeavours to entertain her with the most immoveable gravity but no sooner did Lovel begin his complaint than she was seized with a fit of Laughing first affronting the poor beau and then enjoying his mortification"  "Ha ha ha why there's some  genius  in that my Lord though perhaps rather  rustick  "  Here Maria was called to dance and so heard no more  Now tell me my dear Sir did you ever know any thing more provoking  "  A poor weak girl  " "  ignorant or mischievous  "  What mortifying words I'm resolved however that I will never again be tempted to go to an assembly I wish I had been in Dorsetshire  Well after this you will not be surprised that Lord Orville contented himself with an enquiry after our healths this morning by his servant without troubling himself to call as Miss Mirvan had told me he would but perhaps it may be only a country custom  I would not live here for the world I don't care how soon we leave town London soon  grows tiresome I wish the Captain would come Mrs Mirvan talks of the opera for this evening however I am very indifferent about it  Wednesday morning  Well my dear Sir I have been pleased against my will I could almost say for I must own I went out in very illhumour which I think you can't wonder at but the music and the singing were charming they soothed me into a pleasure the most grateful the best suited to my present disposition in the world I hope to persuade Mrs Mirvan to go again on Saturday I wish the opera was every night It is of all entertainments the sweetest and most delightful Some of the songs seemed to melt my very soul It was what they call a  serious  opera as the  comic  first singer was ill  Tonight we go to Ranelagh If any of those three gentlemen who conversed so freely about me should be therebut I won't think of it  Thursday morning  Well my dear Sir we went to Ranelagh It is a charming place and the brilliancy of the lights on my first entrance made me almost think I was in some inchanted castle or fairy palace for all looked like magic to me  The very first person I saw was Lord Orville I felt so confusedbut he did not see me After tea Mrs Mirvan being tired Maria and I walked round the room alone Then again we saw him standing by the orchestra We too stopt to hear a singer He bowed to me I courtsied and I am sure I coloured We soon  walked on not liking our situation however he did not follow us and when we past by the orchestra again he was gone Afterwards in the course of the evening we met him several times but he was always with some party and never spoke to us tho' whenever he chanced to meet my eyes he condescended to bow  I cannot but be hurt at the opinion he entertains of me It is true my own behaviour incurred ityet is himself the most agreeable and seemingly the most amiable man in the world and therefore it is that I am grieved to be thought ill of by him for of whose esteem ought we to be ambitious if not of those who most merit our ownBut it is too late to reflect upon this now Well I can't help itHowever I think I have done with assemblies  This morning was destined for  seeing sights  auctions curious shops and so forth but my head ached and I was not in a humour to be amused and so I made them go without me though very unwillingly They are all kindness  And now I am sorry I did not accompany them for I know not what to do with myself I had resolved not to go to the play tonight but I believe I shall In short I hardly care whether I do or not  I thought I had done wrong Mrs Mirvan and Maria have been half the town over and so entertainedwhile I like a fool stayed at home to do nothing And at an auction in PallMall who should they meet but Lord Orville He sat next to Mrs Mirvan and they talked a great deal  together but she gave me no account of the conversation  I may never have such another opportunity of seeing London I am quite sorry that I was not of the party but I deserve this mortification for having indulged my illhumour  Thursday night  We are just returned from the play which was King Lear and has made me very sad We did not see any body we knew  Well adieu it is too late to write more  Friday  Captain Mirvan is arrived I have not spirits to give an account of his introduction for he has really shocked me I do not like him He seems to be surly vulgar and disagreeable  Almost the same moment that Maria was presented to him he began some rude jests upon the bad shape of her nose and called her a tall illformed thing She bore it with the utmost goodhumour but that kind and sweettempered woman Mrs Mirvan deserved a better lot I am amazed she would marry him  For my own part I have been so shy that I have hardly spoken to him or he to me I cannot imagine why the family was so rejoiced at his return If he had spent his whole life abroad I should have supposed they might rather have been thankful than sorrowful However I hope they do not think so ill of him as I do At least I am sure they have too much prudence to make it known  Saturday night  We have been to the opera and I am still more pleased than I was on Tuesday I could have thought myself in paradise but for the continual talking of the company around me We sat in the pit where every body was dressed in so high a style that if I had been less delighted with the performance my eyes would have found me sufficient entertainment from looking at the ladies  I was very glad I did not sit next the Captain for he could not bear the music or singers and was extremely gross in his observations on both When the opera was over we went into a place called the coffeeroom where ladies as well as gentlemen assemble There are all sorts of refreshments and the company walk about and  chat  with the same ease and freedom as in a private room  On Monday we go to a ridotto and on Wednesday we return to Howard Grove The Captain says he won't stay here to be  smoked with filth  any longer but having been seven years  smoked with a burning sun  he will retire to the country and sink into a  fairweather chap  Adieu my dear Sir  LETTER XIII  Evelina in continuation  Tuesday April  My dear Sir  WE came home from the ridotto so late or rather so early that it was not possible for me to write Indeed we did not  go  you will be frightened to hear ittill past eleven o'clock but nobody does A terrible reverse of the order of nature We sleep with the sun and wake with the moon  The room was very magnificent the lights and decorations brilliant and the company gay and splendid But I should have told you that I made very many objections to being of the party according to the resolution I had formed However Maria laughed me out of my scruples and so once againI went to an assembly  Miss Mirvan danced a minuet but I had not the courage to follow her example In our walks I saw Lord Orville He was quite alone but did not observe us Yet as he seemed of no party I thought it was not impossible that he might join us and tho' I did not wish much to dance at allyet as I was more acquainted with him than with any other person in the room I must own I could not help thinking it would be infinitely more desireable to dance again with him than with an entire stranger To be sure after all that had passed it was very ridiculous to suppose it even probable that Lord Orville would again honour  me with his choice yet I am compelled to confess my absurdity by way of explaining what follows  Miss Mirvan was soon engaged and presently after a very fashionable gaylooking man who seemed about years of age addressed himself to me and begged to have the honour of dancing with me Now Maria's partner was a gentleman of Mrs Mirvan's acquaintance for she had told us it was highly improper for young women to dance with strangers at any public assembly Indeed it was by no means my wish so to do yet I did not like to confine myself from dancing at all neither did I dare refuse this gentleman as I had done Mr Lovel and then if any acquaintance should offer accept him and so all these reasons combining induced me to tell himyet I blush to write it to youthat I was  already engaged  by which I meant to keep myself at liberty to dance or not as matters should fall out  I suppose my consciousness betrayed my artifice for he looked at me as if incredulous and instead of being satisfied with my answer and leaving me according to my expectation he walked at my side and with the greatest ease imaginable began a conversation in that free style which only belongs to old and intimate acquaintance But what was most provoking he asked me a thousand questions concerning  the partner to whom I was engaged  And at last he said  "Is it really possible that a man whom you have honoured with your acceptance can fail to be at hand to profit from your goodness"  I felt extremely foolish and begged Mrs Mirvan to lead to a seat which she very obligingly did The Captain sat next her and to my great surprise  this gentleman thought proper to follow and seat himself next to me  "What an insensible"  continued he  "why Madam you are missing the most delightful dance in the world The man must be either mad or a foolWhich do you incline to think him yourself"  "Neither Sir"  answered I in some confusion  He begged my pardon for the freedom of his supposition saying  "I really was off my guard from astonishment that any man can be so much and so unaccountably his own enemy But where Madam can he possibly behas he left the roomor has not he been in it"  "Indeed Sir"  said I peevishly  "I know nothing of him"  "I don't wonder that you are disconcerted Madam it is really very provoking The best part of the evening will be absolutely lost He deserves not that you should wait for him"  "I do not Sir"  said I  "and I beg you not to"  "Mortifying indeed Madam"  interrupted he  "a lady to wait for a gentlemanO fiecareless fellowwhat can detain himWill you give me leave to seek him"  "If you please Sir"  answered I quite terrified lest Mrs Mirvan should attend to him for she looked very much surprised at seeing me enter into conversation with a stranger  "With all my heart"  cried he  "pray what coat has he on"  "Indeed I never looked at it"  "Out upon him"  cried he  "What did he address you in a coat not worth looking atWhat a shabby dog"  How ridiculous I really could not help laughing which I fear encouraged him for he went on  "Charming creatureand can you really bear ill usage with so much sweetnessCan you  like patience on a monument  smile in the midst of disappointmentFor my part though I am not the offended person my indignation is so great that I long to kick the fellow round the roomunless indeedhesitating and looking earnestly at me unless indeedit is a partner of your own  creating  "  I was dreadfully abashed and could not make any answer  "But no"  cried he again and with warmth  "it cannot be that you are so cruel Softness itself is painted in your eyesYou could not surely have the barbarity so wantonly to trifle with my misery"  I turned away from this nonsense with real disgust Mrs Mirvan saw my confusion but was perplexed what to think of it and I could not explain to her the cause lest the captain should hear me I therefore proposed to walk she consented and we all rose but would you believe it this man had the assurance to rise too and walk close by my side as if of my party  "Now"  cried he  "I hope we shall see this ingrateIs that he"  pointing to an old man who was lame  "or that"  And in this manner he asked me of whoever was old or ugly in the room I made no sort of answer and when he found that I was resolutely silent and walked on as much as I could without observing him he suddenly stamped his foot and cried out in a passion  "Fool idiot booby"  I turned hastily toward him  "O Madam"  continued he  "forgive my vehemence but I am distracted to think there should exist a wretch who can slight a blessing for which I would forfeit my lifeO that I could but meet himI would soonBut I grow angry pardon me Madam my passions are violent and your injuries affect me"  I began to apprehend he was a madman and stared at him with the utmost astonishment  "I see you are moved Madam"  said he  "generous creaturebut don't be alarmed I am cool again I am indeedupon my soul I amI entreat you most lovely of mortals I entreat you to be easy"  "Indeed Sir"  said I very seriously  "I must insist upon your leaving me you are quite a stranger to me and I am both unused and averse to your language and your manners"  This seemed to have some effect on him He made me a low bow begged my pardon and vowed he would not for the world offend me  "Then Sir you must leave me"  cried I  "I am gone Madam I am gone"  with a most tragical air and he marched away a quick pace out of sight in a moment but before I had time to congratulate myself he was again at my elbow  "And could you really let me go and not be sorryCan you see me suffer torments inexpressible and yet retain all your favour for that miscreant who flies youUngrateful puppyI could bastinado him"  "For Heaven's sake"  my dear cried Mrs Mirvan  "who is he talking of"  "IndeedI do not know Madam"  said I  "but I wish he would leave me"  "What's all that there"  cried the Captain  The man made a low bow and said  "Only Sir a slight objection which this young lady makes to dancing with me and which I am endeavouring to obviate I shall think myself greatly honoured if you will intercede for me"  "That lady Sir  said the Captain coldly  "is her own mistress"  And he walked sullenly on  "You Madam"  said the man who looked delighted to Mrs Mirvan  "you I hope will have the goodness to speak for me"  "Sir"  answered she gravely  "I have not the pleasure of being acquainted with you"  "I hope when you have Ma'am"  cried he undaunted  "you will honour me with your approbation but while I am yet unknown to you it would be truly generous in you to countenance me and I flatter myself Madam that you will not have cause to repent it"  Mrs Mirvan with an embarrassed air replied  "I do not at all mean Sir to doubt your being a gentlemanbut"  "But  what  Madamthat doubt removed why a  but  "  "Well Sir"  said Mrs Mirvan with a goodhumoured smile  "I will even treat you with your own plainness and try what effect that will have on you I must therefore tell you once for all"  "O pardon me Madam"  interrupted he eagerly  "you must not proceed with those words  once for all  no if  I  have been too  plain  and though a  man  deserve a rebuke remember dear ladies that if you  copy  you ought in justice to  excuse  me"  We both stared at the man's strange behaviour  "Be nobler than your sex"  continued he turning to me  "honour me with one dance and give  up the ingrate who has merited so ill your patience"  Mrs Mirvan looked with astonishment at us both  "Who does he speak of my dearyou never mentioned  "O Madam"  exclaimed he  "he was not worth mentioningit is pity he was ever thought of but let us forget his existence One dance is all I solicit permit me madam the honour of this young lady's hand it will be a favour I shall ever most gratefully acknowledge"  "Sir"  answered she  "favours and strangers have with me no connection"  "If you have hitherto"  said he  "confined your benevolence to your intimate friends suffer me to be the first for whom your charity is enlarged"  "Well Sir I know not what to say to youbut"  He stopt her  but  with so many urgent entreaties that she at last told me I must either go down one dance or avoid his importunities by returning home I hesitated which alternative to chuse but this impetuous man at length prevailed and I was obliged to consent to dance with him  And thus was my deviation from truth punished and thus did this man's determined boldness conquer  During the dance before we were too much engaged in it for conversation he was extremely provoking about  my partner  and tried every means in his power to make me own that I had deceived him which though I would not so far humble myself was indeed but too obvious  Lord Orville I fancy did not dance at all he seemed to have a large acquaintance and joined  several different parties but you will easily suppose I was not much pleased to see him in a few minutes after I was gone walk towards the place I had just left and bow to and join Mrs Mirvan  How unlucky I thought myself that I had not longer withstood this stranger's importunities The moment we had gone down the dance I was hastening away from him but he stopt me and said that I could by no means return to my party without giving offence before we had  done our duty of walking up the dance  As I know nothing at all of these rules and customs I was obliged to submit to his directions but I fancy I looked rather uneasy for he took notice of my inattention saying in his free way  "Whence that anxietyWhy are those lovely eyes perpetually averted"  "I wish you would say no more to me Sir"  cried I peevishly  "you have already destroyed all my happiness for this evening"  "Good Heaven what is it I have doneHow have I merited this scorn"  "You have tormented me to death you have forced me from my friends and intruded yourself upon me against my will for a partner"  "Surely my dear madam we ought to be better friends since there seems to be something of a sympathy in the frankness of our dispositionsAnd yet were you not an angelhow do you think I could brook such contempt"  "If I have offended you cried I you have but to leave meand O how I wish you would"  "My dear creature"  cried he half laughing  "why where could you be educated"  "Where I most sincerely wish I now was"  "How conscious you must be all beautiful that you are that those charming airs serve only to heighten the bloom of your complexion"  "Your freedom Sir where you are more acquainted may perhaps be less disagreeable but to  me  "  "You do me justice"  cried he interrupting me  "yes I do indeed improve upon acquaintance you will hereafter be quite charmed with me"  "Hereafter Sir I hope I shall never"  "O hushhushhave you forgot the situation in which I found youHave you forgot that when deserted I pursued youwhen betrayed I adored youbut for me"  "But for you Sir I might perhaps have been happy"  "What then am I to conclude that  but for me  your  partner  would have appearedpoor fellowand did my presence awe him"  "I wish  his  presence Sir could awe  you  "His presenceperhaps then you see him"  "Perhaps Sir I do"  cried I quite wearied of his raillery  "Wherewherefor Heaven's sake shew me the wretch"  "Wretch Sir"  "O a very savagea sneaking shamefaced despicable puppy"  I know not what bewitched mebut my pride was hurt and my spirits were tired andin shortI had the solly looking at Lord Orville to repeat  "  Despicable  you think"  His eyes instantly followed mine  "why is  that  the gentleman"  I made no answer I could not affirm and I would not deny for I hoped to be relieved from his teizing by his mistake  The very moment we had done what he called our duty I eagerly desired to return to Mrs Mirvan  "To your  partner  I presume Madam"  said he very gravely  This quite confounded me I dreaded lest this mischievous man ignorant of his rank should address himself to Lord Orville and say something which might expose my artifice Fool to involve myself in such difficulties I now feared what I had before wished and therefore to  avoid  Lord Orville I was obliged myself to  propose  going down another dance though I was ready to sink with shame while I spoke  "But your  partner  Ma'am"  said he affecting a very solemn air  "perhaps he may resent my detaining you if you will give me leave to ask his consent"  "Not for the universe"  "Who is he Madam"  I wished myself a hundred miles off He repeated his question  "What is his name"  "NothingnobodyI don't know"  He assumed a most important solemnity  "Hownot know Give me leave my dear Madam to recommend this caution to you never dance in public with a strangerwith one whose name you are unacquainted withwho may be a mere adventurera man of no characterconsider to what impertinence you may expose yourself"  Was ever any thing so ridiculous I could not help laughing in spite of my vexation  At this instant Mrs Mirvan followed by Lord Orville walked up to us You will easily believe it was not difficult for me to recover my gravity but what was my consternation when this strange man destined to be the scourge of my artifice exclaimed  "Ha my Lord OrvilleI protest I did not know your Lordship What can I say for my usurpation  Yet faith my Lord such a prize was not to be neglected"  My shame and confusion were unspeakable Who could have supposed or foreseen that this man knew Lord Orville But falsehood is not more unjustifiable than unsafe  Lord Orvillewell he mightlooked all amazement  "The philosophic coldness of your Lordship"  continued this odious creature  "every man is not endowed with I have used my utmost endeavours to entertain this lady though I fear without success and your Lordship would not be a little flattered if acquainted with the difficulty which attended my procuring the honour of only one dance"  Then turning to me who was sinking with shame while Lord Orville stood motionless and Mrs Mirvan astonishedhe suddenly seized my hand saying  "Think my Lord what must be my reluctance to resign this fair hand to your Lordship"  In the same instant Lord Orville took it of him I coloured violently and made an effort to recover it  "You do me too much honour Sir cried he"  with an air of gallantry pressing it to his lips ere he let it go  "however I shall be happy to profit by it if this lady"  turning to Mrs Mirvan  "will permit me to seek for her party"  To compel him thus to dance I could not endure and eagerly called out  "By no meansnot for the worldI must beg"  "Will you honour  me  Madam with your commands"  cried my tormentor  "may  I  seek the lady's party  "No Sir"  answered I turning from him  "What  shall  be done my dear"  said Mrs Mirvan  "Nothing Ma'amany thing I mean"  "But do you dance or not you see his Lordship waits"  "I hope notI beg thatI would not for the worldI am sure I ought toto"  I could not speak but that confident man determined to discover whether or not I had deceived him said to Lord Orville who stood suspended  "My Lord this affair which at present seems perplexed I will briefly explainthis Lady proposed to me another dancenothing could have made me more happyI only wished for your Lordship's permission which if now granted will I am persuaded set every thing right"  I glowed with indignation  "No SirIt is your absence and that alone can set every thing right"  "For Heaven's sake my dear"  cried Mrs Mirvan who could no longer contain her surprise  "what does all this meanwere you preengagedhad Lord Orville"  "No Madam cried Ionlyonly I did not know that gentlemanand soand so I thoughtI intendedI"  Overpowered by all that had passed I had not strength to make my mortifying explanationmy spirits quite sailed me and I burst into tears  They all seemed shocked and amazed  "What is the matter my dearest love"  cried Mrs Mirvan with the kindest concern  "What have I done"  exclaimed my evil genius and ran officiously for a glass of water  However a hint was sufficient for Lord Orville who comprehended all I would have explained He immediately led me to a seat and said in a low voice  "Be not distressed I beseech you I shall ever think my name honoured by your making use of it"  This politeness relieved me A general murmur had alarmed Miss Mirvan who flew instantly to me while Lord Orville the moment Mrs Mirvan had taken the water led my tormentor away  "For Heaven's sake dear Madam"  cried I  "let me go homeindeed I cannot stay here any longer"  "Let us all go"  cried my kind Maria  "But the Captainwhat will he sayI had better go home in a chair"  Mrs Mirvan consented and I rose to depart Lord Orville and that man both came to me The first with an attention I had but ill merited from him led me to a chair while the other followed pestering me with apologies I wished to have made mine to Lord Orville but was too much ashamed  It was about one o'clock Mrs Mirvan's servants saw me home  And nowwhat again shall ever tempt me to an assembly I dread to hear what you will think of me my most dear and honoured Sir you will need your utmost partiality to receive me without displeasure  This morning Lord Orville has sent to enquire after our healths and Sir Clement Willoughby for that I find is the name of my persecutor has called but I would not go down stairs till he was gone  And now my dear Sir I can somewhat account for the strange provoking and ridiculous conduct of this Sir Clement last night for Miss Mirvan says he is the very man with whom she heard Lord Orville conversing at Mrs Stanley's when I was spoken of in so mortifying a manner He was pleased to say he was glad to hear I was a fool and therefore I suppose he concluded he might talk as much nonsense as he pleased to me however I am very indifferent as to his opinionbut for Lord Orvilleif then he thought me an idiot now I am sure he must believe me both bold and presuming Make use of his namewhat impertinencehe can never know how it happenedhe can only imagine it was from an excess of vanitywell however I shall leave this bad city tomorrow and never again will I enter it  The Captain intends to take us tonight to the Fantocini I cannot bear that Captain I can give you no idea how gross he is I heartily rejoice that he was not present at the disagreeable conclusion of yesterday's adventure for I am sure he would have contributed to my confusion which might perhaps have diverted him as he seldom or never smiles but at some other person's expence  And here I conclude my London lettersand without any regret for I am too inexperienced and ignorant to conduct myself with propriety in  this town where every thing is new to me and many things are unaccountable and perplexing  Adieu my dear Sir Heaven restore me safely to you I wish I was to go immediately to Berry Hill yet the wish is ungrateful to Mrs Mirvan and therefore I will repress it I shall write an account of the Fantocini from Howard Grove We have not been to half the public places that are now open though I dare say you will think we have been to all But they are almost as innumerable as the persons who fill them  LETTER XIV  Evelina in continuation  QueenAnnstreet  April  HOW much will you be surprised my dearest Sir at receiving another letter from London of your Evelina's writing But believe me it was not my fault neither is it my happiness that I am still here our journey has been postponed by an accident equally unexpected and disagreeable  We went last night to see the Fantocini where we had infinite entertainment from the performance of a little comedy in French and Italian by puppets so admirably managed that they both astonished and diverted us all except the Captain who has a fixed and most prejudiced hatred of whatever is not English  When it was over while we waited for the coach a tall elderly woman brushed quickly past us calling out  "My God what shall I do"  "Why what  would  you do"  cried the Captain  "  Ma foi Monsieur  "  answered she  "I have lost my company and in this place I don't know nobody"  There was something foreign in her accent though it was difficult to discover whether she was an English or a French woman She was very well dressed and seemed so entirely at a loss what to do that Mrs Mirvan proposed to the Captain to assist her  "Assist her"  cried he  "ay with all my heartlet a linkboy call her a coach"  There was not one to be had and it rained very fast  "  Mon Dieu  "  exclaimed the stranger  "what shall become of me  Je suis au d√©sespoir  "  "Dear Sir"  cried Miss Mirvan  "pray let us take the poor lady into our coach She is quite alone and a foreigner"  "She's never the better for that"  answered he  "she may be a woman of the town for any thing you know"  "She does not appear such"  said Mrs Mirvan  "and indeed she seems so much distressed that we shall but follow the golden rule if we carry her to her lodgings"  "You are mighty fond of new acquaintance"  returned he  "but first let us know if she be going our way"  Upon enquiry we found that she lived in Oxford Road and after some disputing the Captain surlily and with a very bad grace consented to admit her into his coach though he soon convinced us that he was determined she should not be too much obliged to him for he seemed absolutely bent upon quarrelling with her for which  strange inhospitality I can assign no other reason than that she appeared to be a foreigner  The conversation began by her telling us that she had been in England only two days that the gentlemen belonging to her were Parisians and had left her to see for a hackneycoach as her own carriage was abroad and that she had waited for them till she was quite frightened and concluded that they had lost themselves  "And pray"  said the Captain  "why did you go to a public place without an Englishman"  "  Ma foi  Sir"  answered she  "because none of my acquaintance is in town"  "Why then"  said he  "I'll tell you what your best way is to go out of it yourself"  "  Pardie Monsieur  "  returned she  "and so I shall for I promise you I think the English a parcel of brutes and I'll go back to France as fast as I can for I would not live among none of you"  "Who wants you"  cried the Captain  "do you suppose Madam French we have not enough of other nations to pick our pockets already I'll warrant you there's no need of you for to put in your oar"  "Pick your pockets Sir I wish nobody wanted to pick your pockets no more than I do and I'll promise you you'd be safe enough But there's no nation under the sun can beat the English for illpoliteness for my part I hate the very sight of them and so I shall only just visit a person of quality or two of my particular acquaintance and then I shall go back again to France"  "Ay do"  cried he  "and then go to the devil together for that's the fittest voyage for the French and the quality"  "We'll take care however"  cried the stranger with great vehemence  "not to admit none of your vulgar unmannered English among us"  "O never fear"  returned he coolly  "we shan't dispute the point with you you and the quality may have the devil all to yourselves"  Desirous of changing the subject of a conversation which now became very alarming Miss Mirvan called out  "Lord how slow the man drives"  "Never mind Moll"  said her father  "I'll warrant you he'll drive fast enough tomorrow when you're going to Howard Grove"  "To Howard Grove"  exclaimed the stranger  "why  mon Dieu  do you know Lady Howard"  "Why what if we do"  answered he  "that's nothing to you she's none of  your  quality I'll promise you"  "Who told you that  cried she  "you don't know nothing about the matter besides you're the illbredest person ever I see and as to your knowing Lady Howard I don't believe no such a thing unless indeed you are her steward"  The Captain swearing terribly said with great fury  "  you  would much sooner be taken for her washwoman"  "Her washwoman indeedHa ha hawhy you han't no eyes did you ever see a washwoman in such a gown as thisbesides I'm no such mean person for I'm as good as Lady Howard and as rich too and besides I'm now come to England to visit her"  "You may spare yourself that there trouble"  said the Captain  "she has paupers enough about her already"  "Paupers Mrno more a pauper than yourself nor so much neitherbut you're a low dirty fellow and I shan't stoop to take no more notice of you"  "Dirty fellow"  exclaimed the Captain seizing both her wrists  "hark you Mrs Frog you'd best hold your tongue for I must make bold to tell you if you don't that I shall make no ceremony of tripping you out of the window and there you may lie in the mud till some of your Monsieurs come to help you out of it"  Their encreasing passion quite terrified us and Mrs Mirvan was beginning to remonstrate with the Captain when we were all silenced by what follows  "Let me go villain that you are let me go or I'll promise you I'll get you put to prison for this usage I'm no common person I assure you and  ma foi  I'll go to Justice Fielding about you for I'm a person of fashion and I'll make you know it or my name i' n't Duval"  I heard no more amazed frightened and unspeakably shocked an involuntary exclamation of  Gracious Heaven  escaped me and more dead than alive I sunk into Mrs Mirvan's arms But let me draw a veil over a scene too cruel for a heart so compassionately tender as yours it is sufficient that you know this supposed foreigner proved to be Madame Duvalthe grandmother of your Evelina  O Sir to discover so near a relation in a woman who had thus introduced herselfwhat would become of me were it not for you my protector my friend and my refuge  My extreme concern and Mrs Mirvan's surprise immediately betrayed me But I will not  shock you with the manner of her acknowledging me or the bitterness the  grossness  I cannot otherwise express myselfwith which she spoke of those unhappy past transactions you have so pathetically related to me All the misery of a muchinjured parent dear though never seen regretted though never known crowded so forcibly upon my memory that they rendered this interviewone only exceptedthe most afflicting I can ever know  When we stopt at her lodgings she desired me to accompany her into the house and said she could easily procure a room for me to sleep in Alarmed and trembling I turned to Mrs Mirvan  "My daughter Madam  said that sweet woman"  cannot so abruptly part with her young friend you must allow a little time to wean them from each other"  "Pardon me Ma'am"  answered Madame Duval who from the time of her being known somewhat softened her manners  "Miss can't possibly be so nearly connected to this child as I am"  "No matter for that"  cried the Captain who espoused my cause to satisfy his own pique though an awkward apology had passed between them  "she was sent to us and so d'ye see we don't chuse for to part with her"  I promised to wait upon her at what time she pleased the next day and after a short debate she desired me to breakfast with her and we proceeded to QueenAnnStreet  What an unfortunate adventure I could not close my eyes the whole night A thousand times I wished I had never left Berry Hill however my return thither shall be accelerated to the utmost of my power and once more in that abode of tranquil  happiness I will suffer no temptation to allure me elsewhere  Mrs Mirvan was so kind as to accompany me to Madame Duval's house this morning The Captain too offered his service which I declined from a fear she should suppose I meant to insult her  She frowned most terribly upon Mrs Mirvan but she received me with as much tenderness as I believe she is capable of feeling Indeed our meeting seems really to have affected her for when overcome by the variety of emotions which the sight of her occasioned I almost fainted in her arms she burst into tears and said  "Let me not lose my poor daughter a second time"  This unexpected humanity softened me extremely but she very soon excited my warmest indignation by the ungrateful mention she made of the best of men my dear and most generous benefactor However grief and anger mutually gave way to terror upon her avowing the intention of her visiting England was to make me return with her to France This she said was a plan she had formed from the instant she had heard of my birth which she protested did not reach her ears till I must have been twelve years of age but Monsieur Duval who she declared was the worst husband in the world would not permit her to do any thing she wished he had been dead but three months which had been employed in arranging certain affairs that were no sooner settled than she set off for England She was already out of mourning for she said nobody here could tell how long she had been a widow  She must have been married very early in life what her age is I do not know but she really  looks to be less than fifty She dresses very gaily paints very high and the traces of former beauty are still very visible in her face  I know not when or how this visit would have ended had not the Captain called for Mrs Mirvan and absolutely insisted upon my attending her He is become very suddenly so warmly my friend that I quite dread his officiousness Mrs Mirvan however whose principal study seems to be healing those wounds which her husband inflicts appeased Madame Duval's wrath by a very polite invitation to drink tea and spend the evening here Not without great difficulty was the Captain prevailed upon to defer his journey some time longer but what could be done it would have been indecent for me to have quitted the town the very instant I discovered that Madame Duval was in it and to have stayed here solely under her protectionMrs Mirvan thank Heaven was too kind for such a thought That she should follow us to Howard Grove I almost equally dreaded it is therefore determined that we remain in London for some days or a week though the Captain has declared that the  old French hag  as he is pleased to call her shall fare never the better for it  My only hope is to get safe to Berry Hill where counselled and sheltered by you I shall have nothing more to fear Adieu my ever dear and most honoured Sir I shall have no happiness till I am again with you  LETTER XV  Mr Villars to Evelina  BerryHill  April  IN the belief and hope that my Evelina would ere now have bid adieu to London I had intended to have deferred writing till I heard of her return to Howard Grove but the letter I have this moment received with intelligence of Madame Duval's arrival in England demands an immediate answer  Her journey hither equally grieves and alarms me how much did I pity my child when I read of a discovery at once so unexpected and unwished I have long dreaded this meeting and its consequence to claim you seems naturally to follow acknowledging you I am well acquainted with her disposition and have for many years foreseen the contest which now threatens us  Cruel as are the circumstances of this affair you must not my love suffer it to depress your spirits remember that while life is lent me I will devote it to your service and for future time I will make such provision as shall seem to me most conducive to your future happiness Secure of my protection and relying on my tenderness let no apprehensions of Madame Duval disturb your peace conduct yourself towards her with all the respect and deference due to so near a relation remembering always that the failure of duty on her part can by no means justify any neglect on yours indeed the more forcibly you are struck with improprieties and misconduct in another  the greater should be your observance and diligence to avoid even the shadow of similar errors Be careful therefore that no remissness of attention no indifference of obliging make known to her the independence I assure you of but when she fixes the time for her leaving England trust to me the task of refusing your attending her disagreeable to myself I own it will be yet to you it would be improper if not impossible  In regard to her opinion of me I am more sorry than surprised at her determined blindness the palliation which she feels the want of for her own conduct leads her to seek for failings in all who were concerned in those unhappy transactions which she has so much reason to lament And this as it is the cause so we must in some measure consider it as the excuse of her inveteracy  How grateful to me are your wishes to return to Berry Hill your lengthened stay in London and the dissipation in which I find you are involved fill me with uneasiness I mean not however that I would have you sequester yourself from the party to which you belong since Mrs Mirvan might thence infer a reproof which your youth and her kindness would render inexcusable I will not therefore enlarge upon this subject but content myself with telling you that I shall heartily rejoice when I hear of your safe arrival at Howard Grove for which place I hope you will be preparing at the time you receive this letter  I cannot too much thank you my best Evelina for the minuteness of your communications continue to me this indulgence for I should be miserable if in ignorance of your proceedings  How new to you is the scene of life in which you are now engagedballsplaysoperasridottos  Ah my child at your return hither how will you bear the change My heart trembles for your future tranquillityYet I will hope every thing from the unsullied whiteness of your soul and the native liveliness of your disposition  I am sure I need not say how much more I was pleased with the mistakes of your inexperience at the private ball than with the attempted adoption of more fashionable manners at the ridotto But your confusion and mortifications were such as to entirely silence all reproofs on my part  I hope you will see no more of Sir Clement Willoughby whose conversation and boldness are extremely disgustful to me I was gratified by the goodnature of Lord Orville upon your making use of his name but I hope you will never again put it to such a trial  Heaven bless thee my dear child and grant that neither misfortune nor vice may ever rob thee of that gaiety of heart which resulting from innocence while it constitutes your own contributes also to the felicity of all who know you  ARTHUR VILLARS  LETTER XVI  Evelina to the Rev Mr Villars  QueenAnnStreet  Thursday morning April  BEFORE our dinner was over yesterday Madame Duval came to tea though it will lessen your surprise to hear that it was near five o'clock for we never dine till the day is almost over She was asked into another room while the table was  cleared and then was invited to partake of the dessert  She was attended by a French gentleman whom she introduced by the name of Monsieur Du Bois Mrs Mirvan received them both with her usual politeness but the Captain looked very much displeased and after a short silence very sternly said to Madame Duval  "Pray who asked you to bring that there spark with you"  "O"  cried she  "I never go nowhere without him"  Another short silence ensued which was terminated by the Captain's turning roughly to the foreigner and saying  "Do you know Monsieur that you're the first Frenchman I ever let come into my house"  Monsieur Du Bois made a profound bow He speaks no English and understands it so imperfectly that he might possibly imagine he had received a compliment  Mrs Mirvan endeavoured to divert the Captain's illhumour by starting new subjects but he left to her all the trouble of supporting them and leant back in his chair in gloomy silence except when any opportunity offered of uttering some sarcasm upon the French Finding her efforts to render the evening agreeable were fruitless Mrs Mirvan proposed a party to Ranelagh Madame Duval joyfully consented to it and the Captain though he railed against the dissipation of the women did not oppose it and therefore Maria and I ran up stairs to dress ourselves  Before we were ready word was brought us that Sir Clement Willoughby was in the drawingroom He introduced himself under the pretence of enquiring after all our healths and entered  the room with the easy air of an old acquaintance though Mrs Mirvan confesses that he seemed embarrassed when he found how coldly he was received not only by the Captain but by herself  I was extremely disconcerted at the thoughts of seeing this man again and did not go down stairs till I was called to tea He was then deeply engaged in a discourse upon French manners with Madame Duval and the Captain and the subject seemed so entirely to engross him that he did not at first observe my entrance into the room Their conversation was supported with great vehemence the Captain roughly maintaining the superiority of the English in every particular and Madame Duval warmly refusing to allow of it in any while Sir Clement exerted all his powers of argument and of ridicule to second and strengthen whatever was advanced by the Captain for he had the sagacity to discover that he could take no method so effectual for making the master of the house his friend as to make Madame Duval his enemy and indeed in a very short time he had reason to congratulate himself upon his successful discernment  As soon as he saw me he made a most respectful bow and hoped I had not suffered from the fatigue of the ridotto I made no other answer than a slight inclination of the head for I was very much ashamed of that whole affair He then returned to the disputants where he managed the argument so skilfully at once provoking Madame Duval and delighting the Captain that I could not forbear admiring his address though I condemned his subtlety Mrs Mirvan dreading such violent antagonists attempted frequently to change the subject and she might have succeeded  but for the interposition of Sir Clement who would not suffer it to be given up and supported it with such humour and satire that he seems to have won the Captain's heart though their united forces so enraged and overpowered Madame Duval that she really trembled with passion  I was very glad when Mrs Mirvan said it was time to be gone Sir Clement arose to take leave but the Captain very cordially invited him to join our party he  had  an engagement he said but would give it up to have that pleasure  Some little confusion ensued in regard to our manner of setting off Mrs Mirvan offered Madame Duval a place in her coach and proposed that we four females should go all together however this she rejected declaring she would by no means go so far without a gentleman and wondering so polite a lady could make  so English  a proposal Sir Clement Willoughby said his chariot was waiting at the door and begged to know if it could be of any use It was at last decided that a hackneycoach should be called for Monsieur Du Bois and Madame Duval in which the Captain and at his request Sir Clement went also Mrs and Miss Mirvan and I had a peaceful and comfortable ride by ourselves  I don't doubt but they quarrelled all the way for when we met at Ranelagh every one seemed out of humour and though we joined parties poor Madame Duval was avoided as much as possible by all but me and I did not dare quit her for an instant indeed I believe she was resolved I should not for she leant upon my arm almost all the evening  The room was so very much crowded that but for the uncommon assiduity of Sir Clement  Willoughby we should not have been able to procure a box which is the name given to the arched recesses which are appropriated for teaparties till half the company had retired As we were taking possession of our places some ladies of Mrs Mirvan's acquaintance stopped to speak to her and persuaded her to  take a round  with them When she returned to us what was my surprize to see that Lord Orville had joined her party The ladies walked on Mrs Mirvan seated herself and made a slight though respectful invitation to Lord Orville to drink his tea with us which to my no small consternation he accepted  I felt a confusion unspeakable at again seeing him from the recollection of the ridotto adventure nor did my situation lessen it for I was seated between Madame Duval and Sir Clement who seemed as little as myself to desire Lord Orville's presence Indeed the continual wrangling and illbreeding of Captain Mirvan and Madame Duval made me blush that I belonged to them And poor Mrs Mirvan and her amiable daughter had still less reason to be satisfied  A general silence ensued after he was seated his appearance from different motives gave a universal restraint to every body What his own reasons were for honouring us with his company I cannot imagine unless indeed he had a curiosity to know whether I should invent any new impertinence concerning him  The first speech was made by Madame Duval who said  "It's quite a shocking thing to see ladies come to so genteel a place as Ranelagh with hats on it has a monstrous vulgar look I can't think what they wear them for There's no such a thing to be seen in Paris"  "Indeed"  cried Sir Clement  "I must own myself no advocate for hats I am sorry the ladies ever invented or adopted so tantalizing a fashion for where there is beauty they only serve to shade it and where there is none to excite an unavailing curiosity I fancy they were originally worn by some young and whimsical coquet"  "More likely"  answered the Captain  "they were invented by some wrinkled old hag who'd a mind for to keep the young fellows in chace let them be never so weary"  "I don't know what you may do in England"  cried Madame Duval  "but I know in Paris no woman need n't be at such a trouble as that to be taken very genteel notice of"  "Why will you pretend for to say"  returned the Captain  "that they don't distinguish the old from the young there as well as here"  "They don't make no distinguishments at all"  said she  "they're vastly too polite"  "More fools they"  said the Captain sneeringly  "Would to Heaven"  cried Sir Clement  "that for our own sakes we Englishmen too were blest with so accommodating a blindness"  "Why the devil do you make such a prayer as that"  demanded the Captain  "them are the first foolish words I've heard you speak but I suppose you're not much used to that sort of work Did you ever make a prayer before since you were a sniveler"  "Ay now"  cried Madame Duval  "that's another of the unpolitenesses of you English to go to talking of such things as that now in Paris nobody never says nothing about religion no more than about politics"  "Why then"  answered he  "it's a sign they take no more care of their souls than of their country and so both one and t'other go to old Nick"  "Well if they do"  said she  "who's the worse so long as they don't say nothing about it it's the tiresomest thing in the world to be always talking of them sort of things and nobody that's ever been abroad troubles their heads about them"  "Pray then"  cried the Captain  "since you know so much of the matter be so good as to tell us what they  do  trouble their heads abouthay Sir Clement ha'n't we a right to know that much"  "A very comprehensive question"  said Sir Clement  "and I expect much instruction from the lady's answer"  "Come Madam"  continued the Captain  "never flinch speak at once don't stop for thinking"  "I assure you I am not going"  answered she  "for as to what they  do  do why they've enough to do I promise you what with one thing or another"  "But  what what  do they do these famous Monsieurs"  demanded the Captain  "can't you tell us do they gameor drinkor fiddleor are they jockiesor do they spend all their time in slummering old women"  "As to that Sirbut indeed I shan't trouble myself to answer such a parcel of low questions so don't ask me no more about it"  And then to my great vexation turning to Lord Orville she said  "Pray Sir was you ever in Paris"  He only bowed  "And pray Sir how did you like it"  This  comprehensive  question as Sir Clement would have called it though it made him smile also made him hesitate however his answer was expressive of his approbation  "I thought you would like it Sir because you look so like a gentleman As to the Captain and as to that other gentleman why they may very well not like what they don't know for I suppose Sir you was never abroad"  "Only three years Ma'am"  answered Sir Clement drily  "Well that's very surprising I should never have thought it however I dare say you only kept company with the English"  "Why pray who  should  he keep company with"  cried the Captain  "what I suppose you'd have him ashamed of his own nation like some other people not a thousand miles off on purpose to make his own nation ashamed of him"  "I'm sure it would be a very good thing if you'd go abroad yourself"  "How will you make out that hay Madam come please to tell me where would be the good of that"  "Where why a great deal They'd make quite another person of you"  "What I suppose you'd have me learn to cut capersand dress like a monkeyand palavar in French gibberishhay would youAnd powder and daub and make myself up like some other folks"  "I would have you learn to be more politer Sir and not to talk to ladies in such a rude oldfashion way as this You Sir as have been in Paris"  again addressing herself to Lord Orville  "can tell this English gentleman how he'd be despised  if he was to talk in such an ungenteel manner as this before any foreigners Why there is n't a hairdresser nor a shoemaker nor nobody that would n't blush to be in your company"  "Why look ye Madam"  answered the Captain  "as to your hairpinchers and shoeblacks you may puff off their manners and welcome and I am heartily glad you like 'em so well but as to me since you must needs make so free of your advice I must e'en tell you I never kept company with any such gentry"  "Come ladies and gentlemen"  said Mrs Mirvan  "as many of you as have done tea I invite to walk with me"  Maria and I started up instantly Lord Orville followed and I question whether we were not half round the room ere the angry disputants knew that we had left the box  As the husband of Mrs Mirvan had borne so large a share in this disagreeable altercation Lord Orville forbore to make any comments upon it so that the subject was immediately dropt and the conversation became calmly sociable and politely chearful and to every body but me must have been highly agreeablebut as to myself I was so eagerly desirous of making some apology to Lord Orville for the impertinence of which he must have thought me guilty at the ridotto and yet so utterly unable to assume sufficient courage to speak to him concerning an affair in which I had so terribly exposed myself that I hardly ventured to say a word all the time we were walking Besides the knowledge of his contemptuous opinion haunted and dispirited me and made me fear he might possibly misconstrue whatever I should say So that far from enjoying a conversation  that might at any other time have delighted me I continued silent uncomfortable and ashamed O Sir shall I ever again involve myself in so foolish an embarrassment I am sure that if I do I shall deserve yet greater mortification  We were not joined by the rest of the party till we had taken three or four turns round the room and then they were so quarrelsome that Mrs Mirvan complained of being fatigued and proposed going home No one dissented Lord Orville joined another party having first made an offer of his services which the gentlemen declined and we proceeded to an outward room where we waited for the carriages It was settled that we should return to town in the same manner we came to Ranelagh and accordingly Monsieur Du Bois handed Madame Duval into a hackneycoach and was just preparing to follow her when she screamed and jumpt hastily out declaring she was wet through all her clothes Indeed upon examination the coach was found to be in a dismal condition for the weather proved very bad and the rain had though I know not how made its way into the carriage  Mrs and Miss Mirvan and myself were already disposed of as before but no sooner did the Captain hear this account than without any ceremony he was so civil as to immediately take possession of the vacant seat in his own coach leaving Madame Duval and Monsieur Du Bois to take care of themselves As to Sir Clement Willoughby his own chariot was in waiting  I instantly begged permission to offer Madame Duval my own place and made a motion to get out but Mrs Mirvan stopped me saying that I  should then be obliged to return to town with only the foreigner or Sir Clement  "O never mind the old Beldame"  cried the Captain  "she's weatherproof I'll answer for her and besides as we are all I hope  English  why she'll meet with no worse than she expects from us"  "I do not mean to defend her"  said Mrs Mirvan  "but indeed as she belongs to our party we cannot with any decency leave the place till she is by some means accommodated"  "Lord my dear"  cried the Captain whom the distress of Madame Duval had put into very good humour  "why she'll break her heart if she meets with any civility from a filthy Englishman"  Mrs Mirvan however prevailed and we all got out of the coach to wait till Madame Duval could meet with some better carriage We found her attended by Monsieur Du Bois standing amongst the servants and very busy in wiping her negligee and endeavouring to save it from being stained by the wet as she said it was a new Lyons silk Sir Clement Willoughby offered her the use of his chariot but she had been too much piqued by his raillery to accept it We waited some time but in vain for no hackneycoach could be procured The Captain at last was persuaded to accompany Sir Clement himself and we four females were handed into Mrs Mirvan's carriage though not before Madame Duval had insisted upon our making room for Monsieur Du Bois to which the Captain only consented in preference to being incommoded by him in Sir Clement's chariot  Our party drove off first We were silent and unsociable for the difficulties attending this arrangement  had made every one languid and fatigued Unsociable I must own we continued but very short was the duration of our silence as we had not proceeded thirty yards ere every voice was heard at oncefor the coach broke down I suppose we concluded of course that we were all half killed by the violent shrieks that seemed to come from every mouth The chariot was stopped the servants came to our assistance and we were all taken out of the carriage without having been at all hurt The night was dark and wet but I had scarce touched the ground when I was lifted suddenly from it by Sir Clement Willoughby who begged permission to assist me though he did not wait to have it granted but carried me in his arms back to Ranelagh  He enquired very earnestly if I was not hurt by the accident I assured him I was perfectly safe and free from injury and desired he would leave me and return to the rest of the party for I was very uneasy to know whether they had been equally fortunate He told me he was happy in being honoured with my commands and would joyfully execute them but insisted upon first conducting me to a warm room as I had not wholly escaped being wet He did not regard my objections but made me follow him to an apartment where we found an excellent fire and some company waiting for carriages I readily accepted a seat and then begged he would go  And go indeed he did but he returned in a moment telling me that the rain was more violent than ever and that he had sent his servants to offer their assistance and acquaint  the Mirvans  of my situation I was very mad that he would not go himself but as my acquaintance with him  was so very slight I did not think proper to urge him contrary to his inclination  Well he drew a chair close to mine and after again enquiring how I did said in a low voice  "You will pardon me Miss Anville if the eagerness I feel to vindicate myself induces me to snatch this opportunity of making sincere acknowledgments for the impertinence with which I tormented you at the last ridotto I can assure you Madam I have been a true and sorrowful penitent ever since butshall I tell you honestly what encouraged me to"  He stopt but I said nothing for I thought instantly of the conversation Miss Mirvan had overheard and supposed he was going to tell me himself what part Lord Orville had borne in it and really I did not wish to hear it repeated Indeed the rest of his speech convinces me that such was his intention with what view I know not except to make a merit of his defending me  "And yet  he continued  "my excuse may only expose my own credulity and want of judgment and penetration I will therefore merely beseech your pardon and hope that some future time"  Just then the door was opened by Sir Clement's servant and I had the pleasure of seeing the Captain Mrs and Miss Mirvan enter the room  "O ho"  cried the former  "you have got a good warm birth here but we shall beat up your quarters Here Lucy Moll come to the fire and dry your trumpery But heydaywhy where's old Madam French"  "Good God"  cried I  "is not Madame Duval then with you  "With me Nothank God"  I was very uneasy to know what might have become of her and if they would have suffered me I should have gone out in search of her myself but all the servants were dispatched to find her and the Captain said we might be very sure her  French beau  would take care of her  We waited some time without any tidings and were soon the only party in the room My uneasiness encreased so much that Sir Clement now made a voluntary offer of seeking her However the same moment that he opened the door with this design she presented herself at it attended by Monsieur Du Bois  "I was this instant Madam"  said he  "coming to see for you"  "You are mighty good truly"  cried she  "to come when all the mischief's over"  She then enteredin such a conditionentirely covered with mud and in so great a rage it was with difficulty she could speak We all expressed our concern and offered our assistanceexcept the Captain who no sooner beheld her than he burst into a loud laugh  We endeavoured by our enquiries and condolements to prevent her attending to him and she was for some time so wholly engrossed by her anger and her distress that we succeeded without much trouble We begged her to inform us how this accident had happened  "How"  repeated shewhy  "it was all along of your all going awayand there poor Monsieur Du Boisbut it was n't his faultfor he's as bad off as me"  All eyes were then turned to Monsieur Du Bois whose clothes were in the same miserable plight with those of Madame Duval and who wet shivering and disconsolate had crept to the fire  The Captain laughed yet more heartily while Mrs Mirvan ashamed of his rudeness repeated her enquiries to Madame Duval who answered  "Why as we were acoming along all in the rain Monsieur Du Bois was so obliging though I'm sure it was an unlucky obligingness for me as to lift me up in his arms to carry me over a place that was ancledeep in mud but instead of my being ever the better for it just as we were in the worst partI'm sure I wish we had been fifty miles offfor somehow or other his foot sliptat least I suppose sothough I can't think how it happened for I'm no such great weightbut however that was down we both came together all in the mudand the more we tried to get up the more deeper we got covered with the nastinessand my new Lyons negligee too quite spoilthowever it's well we got up at all for we might have laid there till now for aught you all cared for nobody never came near us"  This recital put the Captain into an extacy he went from the lady to the gentleman and from the gentleman to the lady to enjoy alternately the sight of their distress He really shouted with pleasure and shaking Monsieur Du Bois strenuously by the hand wished him joy of having  touched English ground  and then he held a candle to Madame Duval that he might have a more complete view of her disaster declaring repeatedly that he had never been better pleased in his life  The rage of poor Madame Duval was unspeakable she dashed the candle out of his hand stamped upon the floor and at last spat in his face  This action seemed immediately to calm them both as the joy of the Captain was converted into resentment and the wrath of Madame Duval into fear for he put his hands upon her shoulders and gave her so violent a shake that she screamed out for help assuring her at the same time that if she had been one ounce less old or less ugly she should have had it all returned on her own face  Monsieur Du Bois who had seated himself very quietly at the fire approached them and expostulated very warmly with the Captain but he was neither understood nor regarded and Madame Duval was not released till she quite sobbed with passion  When they were parted I entreated her to permit the woman who has the charge of the ladies cloaks to assist her in drying her clothes she consented and we did what was possible to save her from catching cold We were obliged to wait in this disagreeable situation near an hour ere a hackneycoach could be found and then we were disposed in the same manner as before our accident  I am going this morning to see poor Madame Duval and to enquire after her health which I think must have suffered by her last night's misfortunes though indeed she seems to be naturally strong and hearty  Adieu my dear Sir till tomorrow  LETTER XVII  Evelina in continuation  Friday Morning April  SIR Clement Willoughby called here yesterday at noon and Captain Mirvan invited him to dinner For my part I spent the day in a manner the most uncomfortable imaginable  I found Madame Duval at breakfast in bed though Monsieur Du Bois was in the chamber which so much astonished me that I was involuntarily retiring without considering how odd an appearance my retreat would have when Madame Duval called me back and laughed very heartily at my ignorance of foreign customs  The conversation however very soon took a more serious turn for she began with great bitterness to inveigh against the  barbarous brutality of that fellow the Captain  and the horrible illbreeding of the English in general declaring she should make her escape with all expedition from so  beastly a nation  She lamented very mournfully the fate of her Lyons silk and protested she had rather have parted with all the rest of her wardrobe because it was the first gown she had bought to wear upon leaving off her weeds She has a very bad cold and Monsieur Du Bois is so hoarse he can hardly speak  She insisted upon my staying with her all day as she intended she said to introduce me to some of my own relations I would very fain have  excused myself but she did not allow me any choice  Till the arrival of these relations one continued series of questions on her side and of answers on mine filled up all the time we passed together Her curiosity was insatiable she enquired into every action of my life and every particular that had fallen under my observation in the lives of all I knew Again she was so cruel as to avow the most inveterate rancour against the sole benefactor her deserted child and grandchild have met with and such was the indignation her ingratitude raised that I would actually have quitted her presence and house had she not in a manner the most peremptory absolutely forbid me But what good Heaven can induce her to such shocking injustice O my friend and father I have no command of myself when this subject is started  She talked very much of taking me to Paris and said I greatly wanted the polish of a French education She lamented that I had been brought up in the country which she observed had given me a very  bumpkinish air  However she bid me not despair for she had known many girls much worse than me who had become very fine ladies after a few years residence abroad and she particularly instanced a Miss Polly Moore daughter of a chandler'sshop woman who by an accident not worth relating happened to be sent to Paris where from an awkward illbred girl she so much improved that she has since been taken for a woman of quality  The relations to whom she was pleased to introduce me consisted of a Mr Branghton who is her nephew and three of his children the eldest  of which is a son and the two younger are daughters  Mr Branghton appears about forty years of age He does not seem to want a common understanding though he is very contracted and prejudiced he has spent his whole time in the city and I believe feels a great contempt for all who reside elsewhere  His son seems weaker in his understanding and more gay in his temper but his gaiety is that of a foolish overgrown schoolboy whose mirth consists in noise and disturbance He disdains his father for his close attention to business and love of money though he seems himself to have no talents spirit or generosity to make him superior to either His chief delight appears to be tormenting and ridiculing his sisters who in return most heartily despise him  Miss Branghton the eldest daughter is by no means ugly but looks proud illtempered and conceited She hates the city though without knowing why for it is easy to discover she has lived no where else  Miss Polly Branghton is rather pretty very foolish very ignorant very giddy and I believe very goodnatured  The first half hour was allotted to  making themselves comfortable  for they complained of having had a very dirty walk as they came on foot from Snow Hill where Mr Branghton keeps a silversmith's shop and the young ladies had not only their coats to brush and shoes to dry but to adjust their head dress which their bonnets had totally discomposed  The manner in which Madame Duval was pleased to introduce me to this family extremely  shocked me  "Here my dears"  said she  "here's a relation you little thought of but you must know my poor daughter Caroline had this child after she run away from methough I never knew nothing of it not I for a long while after for they took care to keep it a secret from me though the poor child has never a friend in the world besides"  "Miss seems very tenderhearted aunt"  said Miss Polly  "and to be sure she's not to blame for her mama's undutifulness for she could n't help it"  "Lord no"  answered she  "and I never took no notice of it to her for indeed as to that my own poor daughter was n't so much to blame as you may think for she'd never have gone astray if it had not been for that meddling old parson I told you of"  "If aunt pleases"  said young Mr Branghton  "we'll talk o' somewhat else for Miss looks very uneasylike"  The next subject that was chosen was the age of the three young Branghtons and myself The son is twenty the daughters upon hearing that I was seventeen said that was just the age of Miss Polly but their brother after a long dispute proved that she was two years older to the great anger of both sisters who agreed that he was very illnatured and spiteful  When this point was settled the question was put which was tallestWe were desired to measure as the Branghtons were all of different opinions They none of them however disputed my being the tallest in the company but in regard to one another they were extremely quarrelsome the brother insisted upon their measuring  fair  and not with  heads  and  heels  but they would by no means consent to lose these privileges of our sex and therefore the young man was  cast  as shortest though he appealed to all present upon the injustice of the decree  This ceremony over the young ladies began very freely to examine my dress and to interrogate me concerning it  "This apron's your own work I suppose Miss but these sprigs a'n't in fashion now Pray if it is not impertinent what might you give a yard for this lutestringDo you make your own caps Miss"  and many other questions equally interesting and wellbred  They then asked me  how I liked London  and whether I should not think the country a very  dull place  when I returned thither  "Miss must try if she can't get a good husband"  said Mr Branghton  "and then she may stay and live here"  The next topic was public places or rather the theatres for they knew of no other and the merits and defects of all the actors and actresses were discussed the young man here took the lead and seemed to be very conversant on the subject But during this time what was my concern and suffer me to add my indignation when I found by some words I occasionally heard that Madame Duval was entertaining Mr Branghton with all the most secret and cruel particulars of my situation The eldest daughter was soon drawn to them by the recital the youngest and the son still kept their places intending I believe to divert me though the conversation was all their own  In a few minutes Miss Branghton coming suddenly up to her sister exclaimed  "Lord Polly only think Miss never saw her papa"  "Lord how odd"  cried the other  "why then Miss I suppose you would n't know him"  This was quite too much for me I rose hastily and ran out of the room but I soon regretted I had so little command of myself for the two sisters both followed and insisted upon comforting me notwithstanding my earnest entreaties to be left alone  As soon as I returned to the company Madame Duval said  "Why my dear what was the matter with you why did you run away so"  This question almost made me run again for I knew not how to answer it But is it not very extraordinary that she can put me in situations so shocking and then wonder to find me sensible of any concern  Mr Branghton junior now enquired of me whether I had seen the Tower or St Paul's church and upon answering in the negative they proposed making a party to shew them to me Among other questions they also asked if I had ever seen  such a thing as an Opera  I told them I had  "Well"  said Mr Branghton  "I never saw one in my life so long as I've lived in London and I never desire to see one if I live here as much longer"  "Lord Papa"  cried Miss Polly  "why not you might as well for once for the curiosity of the thing besides Miss Pomfret saw one and she says it was very pretty"  "Miss will think us very vulgar"  said Miss Branghton  "to live in London and never have been to an Opera but it's no fault of mine I assure you Miss only Papa don't like to go"  The result was that a party was proposed and agreed to for some early opportunity I did not dare oppose them but I said that my time while  I remained in town was at the disposal of Mrs Mirvan However I am sure I will not attend them if I can possibly avoid so doing  When we parted Madame Duval desired to see me the next day and the Branghtons told me that the first time I went towards Snow Hill they should be very glad if I would call upon them  I wish we may not meet again till that time arrives  I am sure I shall not be very ambitious of being known to any more of my relations if they have any resemblance to those whose acquaintance I have been introduced to already  LETTER XVIII  Evelina in continuation  I Had just finished my letter to you this morning when a violent rapping at the door made me run down stairs and who should I see in the drawing room but Lord Orville  He was quite alone for the family had not assembled to breakfast He enquired first of mine then of the health of Mrs and Miss Mirvan with a degree of concern that rather surprised me till he said that he had just been informed of the accident we had met with at Ranelagh He expressed his sorrow upon the occasion with the utmost politeness and lamented that he had not been so fortunate as to hear of it in time to offer his services  "But I think"  he added  "Sir Clement Willoughby had the honour of assisting you"  "He was with Captain Mirvan my Lord"  "I had heard of his being of your party"  I hope that flighty man has not been telling Lord Orville he only assisted  me  however he did not pursue the subject but said  "This accident though extremely unfortunate will not I hope be the means of frightening you from gracing Ranelagh with your presence in future"  "Our time my Lord for London is almost expired already"  "Indeed do you leave town so very soon"  "O yes my Lord our stay has already exceeded our intentions"  "Are you then so particularly partial to the country"  "We merely came to town my Lord to meet Captain Mirvan"  "And does Miss Anville feel no concern at the idea of the many mourners her absence will occasion"  "O my LordI'm sure you don't think"  I stopt there for indeed I hardly knew what I was going to say My foolish embarrassment I suppose was the cause of what followedfor he came to me and took my hand saying  "I  do  think that whoever has once seen Miss Anville must receive an impression never to be forgotten"  This complimentfrom Lord Orvilleso surprised me that I could not speak but felt myself change colour and stood for some moments silent and looking down however the instant I recollected my situation I withdrew my hand and told him that I would see if Mrs Mirvan was not dressed He did not oppose me so away I went  I met them all on the stairs and returned with them to breakfast  I have since been extremely angry with myself for neglecting so excellent an opportunity of apologizing  for my behaviour at the Ridotto but to own the truth that affair never once occurred to me during the short  t√™te√†t√™te  which we had together But if ever we should happen to be so situated again I will certainly mention it for I am inexpressibly concerned at the thought of his harbouring an opinion that I am bold or impertinent and I could almost kill myself for having given him the shadow of a reason for so shocking an idea  But was it not very odd that he should make me such a compliment I expected it not from himbut gallantry I believe is common to all men whatever other qualities they may have in particular  Our breakfast was the most agreeable meal if it may be called a  meal  that we have had since we came to town Indeed but for Madame Duval I should like London extremely  The conversation of Lord Orville is really delightful His manners are so elegant so gentle so unassuming that they at once engage esteem and diffuse complacence Far from being indolently satisfied with his own accomplishments as I have already observed many men here are though without any pretensions to his merit he is most assiduously attentive to please and to serve all who are in his company and though his success is invariable he never manifests the smallest degree of consciousness  I could wish that  you  my dearest Sir knew Lord Orville because I am sure you would love him and I have felt that wish for no other person I have seen since I came to London I sometimes imagine that when his youth is flown his vivacity abated and his life is devoted to retirement he will perhaps resemble him whom I most love  and honour His present sweetness politeness and diffidence seem to promise in future the same benevolence dignity and goodness But I must not expatiate upon this subject  When Lord Orville was goneand he made but a very short visitI was preparing most reluctantly to wait upon Madame Duval but Mrs Mirvan proposed to the Captain that she should be invited to dinner in QueenAnnStreet and he readily consented for he said he wished to ask after her Lyons negligee  The invitation is accepted and we expect her every moment But to me it is very strange that a woman who is the uncontrolled mistress of her time fortune and actions should chuse to expose herself voluntarily to the rudeness of a man who is openly determined to make her his sport But she has very few acquaintance and I fancy scarce knows how to employ herself  How great is my obligation to Mrs Mirvan for bestowing her time in a manner so disagreeable to herself merely to promote my happiness every dispute in which her undeserving husband engages is productive of pain and uneasines s to herself of this I am so sensible that I even besought her not to send to Madame Duval but she declared she could not bear to have me pass all my time while in town with her only Indeed she is so infinitely kind to me that one would think she was your daughter  LETTER XIX  Evelina in continuation  Saturday Morning April  MADAME Duval was accompanied by Monsieur Du Bois I am surprised that she should chuse to introduce him where he is so unwelcome and indeed it is strange that they should be so constantly together though I believe I should not have taken notice of it but that Captain Mirvan is perpetually rallying me upon my  grandmama's beau  They were both received by Mrs Mirvan with her usual goodbreeding but the Captain most provokingly attacked her immediately saying  "Now Madam you that have lived abroad please to tell me this here Which did you like best the  warm room  at Ranelagh or the  cold bath  you went into afterwards though I assure you you look so well that I should advise you to take another dip"  "  Ma foi  Sir"  cried she  "nobody asked for your advice so you may as well keep it to yourself besides it's no great joke to be splashed and to catch cold and spoil all one's things whatever you may think of it"  "  Splashed  quothawhy I thought you were soused all overCome come don't mince the matter never spoil a good story you know you had n't a dry thread about you'Fore George I shall never think on't without hallooing such a poor forlorn draggletailed  gentlewoman  and poor Monsieur French here like a drowned rat by your side"  "Well the worse pickle we was in so much the worser in you not to help us for you knowed where we was fast enough because while I laid in the mud I'm pretty sure I heard you snigger so it's like enough you jostled us down yourself for Monsieur Du Bois says that he is sure he had a great jolt given him or he should n't have fell"  The Captain laughed so immoderately that he really gave me also a suspicion that he was not entirely innocent of the charge however he disclaimed it very peremptorily  "Why then"  continued she  "if you did n't do that why did n't you come to help us"  "Who Iwhat do you suppose I had forgot I was an  Englishman  a filthy beastly  Englishman  "  "Very well Sir very well but I was a fool to expect any better for it's all of a piece with the rest you know you wanted to fling me out of the coachwindow the very first time ever I see you but I'll never go to Ranelagh with you no more that I'm resolved for I dare say if the horses had runn'd over me as I laid in that nastiness you'd never have stirred a step to save me"  "Lord no to be sure Ma'am not for the world I know your opinion of our nation too well to affront you by supposing a  Frenchman  would want  my  assistance to protect you Did you think that Monsieur here and I had changed characters and that he should pop you into the mud and I help you out of it Ha ha ha"  "O very well Sir laugh on it's like your manners however if poor Monsieur Du Bois had n't met with that unlucky accident himself I should n't have wanted nobody's help"  "O I promise you Madam you'd never have had mine I knew my distance better  and as to your being a little ducked or so why to be sure Monsieur and you settled that between yourselves so it was no business of mine"  "What then I suppose you want to make me believe as Monsieur Du Bois served me that trick o' purpose"  "O' purpose ay certainly who ever doubted that Do you think a  Frenchman  ever made a blunder If he had been some clumsyfooted  English  fellow indeed it might have been accidental but what the devil signifies all your hopping and capering with your dancingmasters if you can't balance yourselves upright"  In the midst of this dialogue Sir Clement Willoughby made his appearance He affects to enter the house with the freedom of an old acquaintance and this very  easiness  which to me is astonishing is what most particularly recommends him to the Captain Indeed he seems very successfully to study all the humours of that gentleman  After having heartily welcomed him  "You are just come in time my boy"  said he  "to settle a little matter of a dispute between this here gentlewoman and I do you know she has been trying to persuade me that she did not above half like the ducking Monsieur gave her t'other night"  "I should have hoped"  said Sir Clement with the utmost gravity  "that the friendship subsisting between that lady and gentleman would have guarded them against any actions professedly disagreeable to each other but probably they might not have discussed the matter previously in which case the gentleman I must own seems to have been guilty of inattention since in my  humble opinion it was his business first to have enquired whether the lady preferred soft or hard ground before he dropt her"  "O very fine Gentlemen very fine"  cried Madame Duval  "you may try to set us together by the ears as much as you will but I'm not such an ignorant person as to be made a fool of so easily so you need n't talk no more about it for I sees into your designs  Monsieur Du Bois who was just able to discover the subject upon which the conversation turned made his defence in French with great solemnity he hoped he said that the company would at least acknowledge he did not come from a nation of brutes and consequently that to wilfully offend any lady was to him utterly impossible but that on the contrary in endeavouring as was his duty to save and guard her he had himself suffered in a manner which he would forbear to relate but which he greatly apprehended he should feel the ill effects of for many months and then with a countenance exceedingly lengthened he added that he hoped it would not be attributed to him as national prejudice when he owned that he must to the best of his memory aver that his unfortunate fall was owing to a sudden but violent push which he was shocked to say some malevolent person with a design to his injury must certainly have given him but whether with a view to mortify him by making him let the lady fall or whether merely to spoil his clothes he could not pretend to determine  This disputation was at last concluded by Mrs Mirvan proposing that we should all go to Cox's Museum Nobody objected and carriages were immediately ordered  In our way down stairs Madame Duval in a very passionate manner said  "  Ma foi  if I would n't give fifty guineas only to know who gave us that shove"  This Museum is very astonishing and very superb yet it afforded me but little pleasure for it is a mere show though a wonderful one  Sir Clement Willoughby in our walk round the room asked me what my opinion was of this brilliant  spectacle  "It is very fine and very ingenious"  answered I  "and yetI don't know how it isbut I seem to miss something"  "Excellently answered"  cried he  "you have exactly defined my own feelings though in a manner I should never have arrived at But I was certain your taste was too well formed to be pleased at the expence of your understanding"  "  Pardie  "  cried Madame Duval  "I hope you two is difficult enough I'm sure if you don't like this you like nothing for it's the grandest prettiest finest sight that ever I see in England"  "What"  cried the Captain with a sneer  "I suppose this may be in your French taste it's like enough for it's all  kickshaw  work But pry'thee friend"  turning to the person who explained the devices  "will you tell me the  use  of all this for I'm not enough of a conjurer to find it out"  "Use indeed"  repeated Madame Duval disdainfully  "Lord if every thing's to be useful"  "Why Sir as to that Sir"  said our conductor  "the ingenuity of the mechanismthe beauty of the workmanshiptheundoubtedly Sir any person of taste may easily discern the utility of such extraordinary performances"  "Why then Sir"  answered the Captain  "your person of taste must be either a coxcomb or a Frenchman though for the matter of that 'tis the same thing"  Just then our attention was attracted by a pineapple which suddenly opening discovered a nest of birds who immediately began to sing  "Well"  cried Madame Duval  "this is prettier than all the rest I declare in all my travels I never see nothing eleganter"  "Hark ye friend"  said the Captain  "hast never another pineapple"  "Sir"  "Because if thou hast pry'thee give it us without the birds for d'ye see I'm no Frenchman and should relish something more substantial"  This entertainment concluded with a concert of mechanical music I cannot explain how it was produced but the effect was pleasing Madame Duval was in extacies and the Captain flung himself into so many ridiculous distortions by way of mimicking her that he engaged the attention of all the company and in the midst of the performance of the Coronation Anthem while Madame Duval was affecting to beat time and uttering many expressions of delight he called suddenly for salts which a lady apprehending some distress politely handed to him and which instantly applying to the nostrils of poor Madame Duval she involuntarily snuffed up such a quantity that the pain and surprise made her scream aloud When she recovered she reproached him with her usual vehemence but he protested he had taken that measure out of pure friendship as he concluded from her raptures that she was going  into hysterics This excuse by no means appeased her and they had a violent quarrel but the only effect her anger had on the Captain was to encrease his diversion Indeed he laughs and talks so terribly loud in public that he frequently makes us ashamed of belonging to him  Madame Duval notwithstanding her wrath made no scruple of returning to dine in QueenAnnstreet Mrs Mirvan had secured places for the play at Drury Lane Theatre and though ever uneasy in her company she very politely invited Madame Duval to be of our party however she had a bad cold and chose to nurse it I was sorry for her indisposition but I knew not how to be sorry she did not accompany us for she isI must not say what but very unlike other people  LETTER XX  Evelina in continuation  OUR places were in the front row of a sidebox Sir Clement Willoughby who knew our intention was at the door of the Theatre and handed us from the carriage  We had not been seated five minutes ere Lord Orville who we saw in the stagebox came to us and he honoured us with his company all the evening Miss Mirvan and I both rejoiced that Madame Duval was absent as we hoped for the enjoyment of some conversation uninterrupted by her quarrels with the Captain but I soon  found that her presence would have made very little alteration for so far was I from daring to speak that I knew not where even to look  The play was Love for Love and though it is fraught with wit and entertainment I hope I shall never see it represented again for it is so extremely indelicateto use the softest word I canthat Miss Mirvan and I were perpetually out of countenance and could neither make any observations ourselves nor venture to listen to those of others This was the more provoking as Lord Orville was in excellent spirits and exceedingly entertaining  When the Play was over I flattered myself I should be able to look about me with less restraint as we intended to stay the Farce but the curtain had hardly dropped when the boxdoor opened and in came Mr Lovel the man by whose foppery and impertinence I was so much teazed at the ball where I first saw Lord Orville  I turned away my head and began talking to Miss Mirvan for I was desirous to avoid speaking to himbut in vain for as soon as he had made his compliments to Lord Orville and Sir Clement Willoughby who returned them very coldly he bent his head forward and said to me  "I hope Ma'am you have enjoyed your health since I had the honourI beg ten thousand pardons but I protest I was going to say the honour of  dancing  with youhowever I mean the honour of  seeing  you dance"  He spoke with a selfcomplacency that convinced me he had studied this address by way of making reprisals for my conduct at the ball I therefore bowed slightly but made no answer  After a short silence he again called my attention by saying in an easy negligent way  "I think Ma'am you was never in town before"  "No Sir"  "So I did presume Doubtless Ma'am every thing must be infinitely novel to you Our customs our manners and  les etiquettes de nous autres  can have very little resemblance to those you have been used to I imagine Ma'am your retirement is at no very small distance from the capital"  I was so much disconcerted at this sneering speech that I said not a word though I have since thought my vexation both stimulated and delighted him  "The air we breathe here however Ma'am  continued he very conceitedly  "though foreign to that you have been accustomed to has not I hope been at variance with your health"  "Mr Lovel"  said Lord Orville  "could not your  eye  have spared that question"  "O my Lord"  answered he  "if  health  were the only cause of a lady's bloom my eye I grant had been infallible from the first glance but"  "Come come"  cried Mrs Mirvan  "I must beg no insinuations of that sort Miss Anville's colour as you have successfully tried may you see be heightenedbut I assure you it would be past your skill to lessen it"  "'Pon honour Madam"  returned he  "you wrong me I presumed not to infer that  rouge  was the only succedaneum for health but really I have known so many different causes for a lady's colour such as flushinganger  mauvaise honte  and so forth that I never dare decide to which it may be owing"  "As to such causes as them there"  cried the Captain  "they must belong to those that they keep company with"  "Very true Captain"  said Sir Clement  "the natural complexion has nothing to do with occasional sallies of the passions or any accidental causes"  "No truly"  returned the Captain  "for now here's me why I look like any other man just now and yet if you were to put me in a passion 'fore George you'd soon see me have as fine a high colour as any painted Jezebel in all this place be she never so bedaubed"  "But"  said Lord Orville  "the difference of natural and of artificial colour seems to me very easily discerned that of Nature is mottled and varying that of art  set  and  too  smooth it wants that animation that glow that  indescribable something  which even now that I see it wholly surpasses all my powers of expression"  "Your Lordship"  said Sir Clement  "is universally acknowledged to be a  connoisseur  in beauty"  "And you Sir Clement"  returned he  "an  enthusiast  "  "I am proud to own it"  cried Sir Clement  "in such a cause and before such objects enthusiasm is simply the consequence of not being blind"  "Pr'ythee a truce with all this palavering"  cried the Captain  "the women are vain enough already no need for to puff 'em up more"  "We must all submit to the commanding officer"  said Sir Clement  "therefore let us call another subject Pray Ladies how have you been entertained with the play"  "Want of entertainment"  said Mrs Mirvan  "is its least fault but I own there are objections to it which I should be glad to see removed"  "I could have ventured to answer for the Ladies"  said Lord Orville  "since I am sure this is not a play that can be honoured with their approbation"  "What I suppose it is not sentimental enough"  cried the Captain  "or else it's too good for them for I'll maintain it's one of the best comedies in the language and has more wit in one scene than there is in all the new plays put together"  "For my part"  said Mr Lovel  "I confess I seldom listen to the players one has so much to do in looking about and finding out one's acquaintance that really one has no time to mind the stage Praymost affectedly fixing his eyes upon a diamondring on his little finger praywhat was the play tonight"  "Why what the Dl"  cried the Captain  "do you come to the play without knowing what it is  "O yes Sir yes very frequently I have no time to read playbills one merely comes to meet one's friends and shew that one's alive"  "Ha ha haand so"  cried the Captain  "it costs you five shillings a night just to shew that you're alive Well faith my friends should all think me dead and under ground before I'd be at the expence for 'em Howsomever this here you may take from methey'll find you out fast enough if you've any thing to give 'em And so you've been here all this time and don't know what the play was"  "Why really Sir a play requires so much attentionit is scarcely possible to keep awake if one listensfor indeed by the time it is evening one has been so fatigued with diningor wineor the houseor studyingthat it isit is perfectly an impossibility But now I think of it I believe I have a bill in my pocket O ay here it isLove for Love aytrueha hahow could I be so stupid  "O easily enough as to that I warrant you"  said the Captain  "but by my soul this is one of the best jokes I ever heard Come to a play and not know what it isWhy I suppose you would n't have found it out if they had  fob'd  you off with a scraping of fidlers or an operaHa ha hawhy now I should have thought you might have taken some notice of one Mr  Tattle  that is in this play  This sarcasm which caused a general smile made him colour but turning to the Captain with a look of conceit which implied that he had a retort ready he said  "Pray Sir give me leave to askwhat do  you  think of  one Mr Ben  who is also in this play  The Captain regarding him with the utmost contempt answered in a loud voice  "Think of himwhy I think he's a  man  "  And then staring full in his face he struck his cane on the ground with a violence that made him start He did not however chuse to take any notice of this but having bit his nails some time in manifest confusion he turned very quick to me and in a sneering tone of voice said  "For my part I was most struck with the  country  young lady Miss Prue pray what do  you  think of her Ma'am"  "Indeed Sir"  cried I very much provoked  "I thinkthat is I do not think any thing about her"  "Well really Ma'am you prodigiously surprize me  mais apparemment ce n'est qu'un fa√ßon √† parler  though I should beg your pardon for probably you do not understand French"  I made no answer for I thought his rudeness intolerable but Sir Clement with great warmth said  "I am surprised that you can suppose such an object as Miss Prue would engage the attention of Miss Anville even for a moment"  "O Sir"  returned this fop  'tis the first character in the pieceso well drawnso much the thingsuch true countrybreedingsuch rural ignoranceha ha ha'tis most admirably hit off 'pon honour"  I could almost have cried that such impertinence should be levelled at me and yet chagrined as I was I could never behold Lord Orville and this man at the same time and feel any regret for the cause I had given of displeasure  "The only character in the play"  said Lord Orville  "worthy of being mentioned to these ladies is Angelica"  "Angelica"  cried Sir Clement  "is a noble girl she tries her lover severely but she rewards him generously"  "Yet in a trial so long"  said Mrs Mirvan  "there seems rather too much consciousness of her power"  "Since my opinion has the sanction of Mrs Mirvan's"  added Lord Orville"  "I will venture to say that Angelica bestows her hand rather with the air of a benefactress than with the tenterness of a mistress Generosity without delicacy  like wit without judgment generally gives as much pain as pleasure The uncertainty in which she keeps Valentine and her manner of trifling with his temper give no very favourable idea of her own"  "Well my Lord"  said Mr Lovel  "it must however be owned that uncertainty is not the  ton  among our ladies at present nay indeed I think they say though faith"  taking a pinch of snuff  "I hope it is not truebut they say that  we  now are most shy and backward"  The curtain then drew up and our conversation ceased Mr Lovel finding we chose to attend to the players lest the box How strange it is Sir that this man not contented with the large share of foppery and nonsense which he has from nature should think proper to affect yet more for what he faid of Tattle and of Miss Prue convinced me that he really had listened to the play though he was so ridiculous and foolish as to pretend ignorance  But how malicicious and impertinent in this creature to talk to me in such a manner I am sure I hope I shall never see him again I should have despised him heartily as a fop had he never spoken to me at at all but now that he thinks proper to resent his supposed ill usage I am really quite afraid of him  The entertainment was The Deuce is in him which Lord Orville observed to be the most finished and elegant  petite piece  that was ever written in English  In our way home Mrs Mirvan put me into some consternation by saying it was evident from the resentment which this Mr Lovel harbours of my conduct that he would think it a provocation  sufficiently important for a duel if his courage equalled his wrath  I am terrified at the very idea Good Heaven that a man so weak and frivolous should be so revengeful However if bravery would have excited him to affront Lord Orville how much reason have I to rejoice that cowardice makes him contented with venting his spleen upon me But we shall leave town soon and I hope see him no more  It was some consolation to me to hear from Miss Mirvan that while he was speaking to me so cavalierly Lord Orville regarded him with great indignation  But really I think there ought to be a book of the laws and customs  alamode  presented to all young people upon their first introduction into public company  To night we go to the opera where I expect very great pleasure We shall have the same party as at the play for Lord Orville said he should be there and would look for us  LETTER XXI  Evelina in continuation  I HAVE a volume to write of the adventures of yesterday  In the afternoonat Berry Hill I should have said the  evening  for it was almost six o'clockwhile Miss Mirvan and I were dressing for the opera and in high spirits from the expectation of great entertainment and pleasure we heard a carriage  stop at the door and concluded that Sir Clement Willoughby with his usual assiduity was come to attend us to the Haymarket but in a few moments what was our surprise to see our chamberdoor flung open and the two Miss Branghtons enter the room They advanced to me with great familiarity saying  "How do you do cousinso we've caught you at the glasswell I'm determined I'll tell my brother of that"  Miss Mirvan who had never before seen them and could not at first imagine who they were looked so much astonished that I was ready to laugh myself till the eldest said  "We're come to take you to the opera Miss papa and my brother are below and we are to call for your grandmama as we go along"  "I am very sorry"  answered I  "that you should have taken so much trouble as I am engaged already"  "Engaged Lord Miss never mind that"  cried the youngest  "this young lady will make your excuses I dare say it's only doing as one would be done by you know"  "Indeed Ma'am"  said Miss Mirvan  "I shall myself be very sorry to be deprived of Miss Anville's company this evening"  "Well Miss that is not so very goodnatured in you"  said Miss Branghton  "considering we only come to give our cousin pleasure it's no good to us it's all upon her account for we came I don't know how much round about to take her up"  "I am extremely obliged to you"  said I  "and very sorry you have lost so much time but I cannot possibly help it for I engaged myself without knowing you would call"  "Lord what signifies that"  said Miss Polly  "you're no old maid and so you need n't be so very formal besides I dare say those you are engaged to a'n't half so near related to you as we are"  "I must beg you not to press me any further for I assure you it is not in my power to attend you"  "Why we came all out of the city on purpose besides your grandmama expects youand pray what are we to say to her"  "Tell her if you please that I am much concernedbut that I am preengaged"  "And who to"  demanded the abrupt Miss Branghton  "To Mrs Mirvanand a large party"  "And pray what are you all going to do that it would be such a mighty matter for you to come along with us"  "We are going toto the opera"  "O dear if that be all why can't we go all together"  I was extremely disconcerted at this forward and ignorant behaviour and yet their rudeness very much lessened my concern at refusing them Indeed their dress was such as would have rendered their scheme of accompanying our party impracticable even if I had desired it and this as they did not themselves find out I was obliged in terms the least mortifying I could think of to tell them  They were very much chagrined and asked where I should sit  "In the pit"  answered I  "In the pit"  repeated Miss Branghton  "well really I must own I should never have supposed that my gown was not good enough for the pit but come Polly let's go if Miss does not think  us fine enough for her why to be sure she may chuse"  Surprised at this ignorance I would have explained to them that the pit at the opera required the same dress as the boxes but they were so much affronted they would not hear me and in great displeasure left the room saying they would not have troubled me only they thought I should not be so proud with my own relations and that they had at least as good a right to my company as strangers  I endeavoured to apologize and would have sent a long message to Madame Duval but they hastened away without listening to me and I could not follow them down stairs because I was not dressed The last words I heard them say were  "Well her grandmama will be in a fine passion that's one good thing"  Though I was extremely mad at this visit yet I so heartily rejoiced at their going that I would not suffer myself to think gravely about it  Soon after Sir Clement actually came and we all went down stairs Mrs Mirvan ordered tea and we were engaged in a very lively conversation when the servant announced Madame Duval who instantly followed him into the room  Her face was the colour of scarlet and her eyes sparkled with fury She came up to me with a hasty step saying  "So Miss you refuses to come to me do you And pray who are you to dare to disobey me"  I was quite frightenedI made no answerI even attempted to rise and could not but sat still mute and motionless  Every body but Miss Mirvan seemed in the utmost astonishment and the Captain raising and approaching Madame Duval with a voice of authority  said  "Why how now Mrs Turkey Cock what's put you into this here fluster"  "It's nothing to you"  answered she  "so you may as well hold your tongue for I sha'n't be called to no account by you I assure you"  "There you're out Madam Fury"  returned he  "for you must know I never suffer any body to be in a passion in my house but myself"  "But you  shall  "  cried she in a great rage  "for I'll be in as great a passion as ever I please without asking your leave so don't give yourself no more airs about it And as for you Miss"  again advancing to me  "I order you to follow me this moment or else I'll make you repent it all your life"  And with these words she flung out of the room  I was in such extreme terror at being addressed and threatened in a manner to which I am so wholly unused that I almost thought I should have fainted  "Don't be alarmed my love"  cried Mrs Mirvan  "but stay where you are and I will follow Madame Duval and try to bring her to reason"  Miss Mirvan took my hand and most kindly endeavoured to raise my spirits Sir Clement too approached me with an air so interested in my distress that I could not but feel myself obliged to him and taking my other hand said  "For Heaven's sake my dear Madam compose yourself surely the violence of such a wretch ought merely to move your contempt she can have no right I imagine to lay her commands upon you and I only wish that you would allow  me  leave to speak to her"  "O no not for the world indeed I believeI am afraidI had better follow her"  "Follow her Good God my dear Miss Anville would you trust yourself with a mad woman  for what else can you call a creature whose passions are so insolent No no send her word at once to leave the house and tell her you desire that she will never see you again"  "O Sir you don't know who you talk ofit would ill become me to send Madame Duval such a message"  "But  why  "  cried he looking very inquisitive  "  why  should you scruple to treat her as she deserves"  I then found that his aim was to discover the nature of her connection with me but I felt so much ashamed of my near relationship to her that I could not persuade myself to answer him and only entreated that he would leave her to Mrs Mirvan who just then entered  Before she could speak to me the Captain called out  "Well Goody what have you done with Madame French is she cooled a little 'cause if she be n't I've just thought of a most excellent device to bring her to"  "My dear Evelina"  said Mrs Mirvan  "I have been vainly endeavouring to appease her I pleaded your engagement and promised your future attendance but I am sorry to say my love that I fear her rage will end in a total breach which I think you had better avoid if she is any further opposed"  "Then I will go to her Madam"  cried I  "and indeed it is now no matter for I should not be able to recover my spirits sufficiently to enjoy much pleasure  any  where this evening"  Sir Clement began a very warm expostulation and entreaty that I would not go but I begged him to desist and told him very honestly that if my compliance were not indispensably necessary  I should require no persuasion to stay He then took my hand to lead me down stairs but the Captain desired him to be quiet saying he would 'squire me himself  "because"  he added exultingly rubbing his hands  "I have a wipe ready for the old lady which may serve her to  chew  as she goes along"  We found her in the parlour  "O you're come at last Miss are youfine airs you give yourself indeed  ma foi  if you had n't come you might have stayed I assure you and have been a beggar for your pains"  "Heyday Madam"  cried the Captain prancing forward with a look of great glee  "what a'n't you got out of that there passion yet why then I'll tell you what to do to cool yourself call upon your old friend Monsieur Slippery who was with you at Ranelagh and give my service to him and tell him if he sets any store by your health that I desire he'll give you such another souse as he did before he'll know what I mean and I'll warrant you he'll do't for my sake"  "Let him if he dares"  cried Madame Duval  "but I sha'n't stay to answer you no more you are a vulgar fellowand so child let us leave him to himself"  "Hark ye Madam"  cried the Captain  "you'd best not call names because d'ye see if you do I shall make bold to show you the door"  She changed colour and saying  "  Pardie  I can shew it myself"  hurried out of the room and I followed her into a hackneycoach But before we drove off the Captain looking out of the parlour window called out  "D'ye hear Madamdon't forget my message to Monsieur"  You will believe our ride was not the most agreeable in the world indeed it would be difficult to say which was least pleased Madame Duval or me though the reasons of our discontent were so different however Madame Duval soon got the start of me for we had hardly turned out of QueenAnnestreet when a man running full speed stopt the coach He came up to the window and I saw he was the Captain's servant He had a broad grin on his face and panted for breath Madame Duval demanded his business  "Madam"  answered he  "my master desires his compliments to you andandand he says he wishes it well over with you He he he"  Madame Duval instantly darted forward and gave him a violent blow on the face  "Take that back for your answer sirrah"  cried she  "and learn to grin at your betters another time Coachman drive on"  The servant was in a violent passion and swore terribly but we were soon out of hearing  The rage of Madame Duval was greater than ever and she inveighed against the Captain with such fury that I was even apprehensive she would have returned to his house purposely to reproach him which she repeatedly threatened to do nor would she I believe have hesitated a moment but that notwithstanding her violence he has really made her afraid of him  When we came to her lodgings we found all the Branghtons in the passage impatiently waiting for us with the door open  "Only see here's Miss"  cried the brother  "Well I declare I thought as much"  said the younger sister  "Why Miss"  said Mr Branghton  "I think you might as well have come with your cousins at once it's throwing money in the dirt to pay two coaches for one fare"  "Lord father"  cried the son  "make no words about that for I'll pay for the coach that Miss had"  "O I know very well"  answered Mr Branghton  "that you're always more ready to spend than to earn"  I then interfered and begged that I might myself be allowed to pay the fare as the expence was incurred upon my account they all said  no  and proposed that the same coach should carry us on to the opera  While this passed the Miss Branghtons were examining my dress which indeed was very improper for my company and as I was extremely unwilling to be so conspicuous amongst them I requested Madame Duval to borrow a hat or bonnet for me of the people of the house But she never wears either herself and thinks them very  English  and barbarous therefore she insisted that I should go full dressed as I had prepared myself for the pit though I made many objections  We were then all crowded into the same carriage but when we arrived at the operahouse I contrived to pay the coachman They made a great many speeches but Mr Branghton's reflection had determined me not to be indebted to him  If I had not been too much chagrined to laugh I should have been extremely diverted at their ignorance of whatever belongs to an opera In the first place they could not tell at what door we  ought to enter and we wandered about for some time without knowing which way to turn they did not chuse to apply to me though I was the only person of the party who had ever before been at an opera because they were unwilling to suppose that their  country cousin  as they were pleased to call me should be better acquainted with any London public place than themselves I was very indifferent and careless upon this subject but not a little uneasy at finding my dress so different from that of the company to which I belonged attracted general notice and observation  In a short time however we arrived at one of the doorkeeper's  bars  Mr Branghton demanded for what part of the house they took money They answered the pit and regarded us all with great earnestness The son then advancing said  "Sir if you please I beg that I may treat Miss"  "We'll settle that another time"  answered Mr Branghton and put down a guinea  Two tickets of admission were given to him  Mr Branghton in his turn now stared at the doorkeeper and demanded what he meant by giving him only two tickets for a guinea  "Only two Sir"  said the man  "why don't you know that the tickets are half a guinea each"  "Half a guinea each"  repeated Mr Branghton  "why I never heard of such a thing in my life And pray Sir how many will they admit"  "Just as usual Sir one person each"  "But one person for half a guineawhy I only want to sit in the pit friend"  "Had not the Ladies better sit in the gallery Sir for they'll hardly chuse to go into the pit with their hats on"  "O as to that"  cried Miss Branghton  "if our hats are too high we'll take them off when we get in I sha'n't mind it for I did my hair on purpose"  Another party then approaching the doorkeeper coul no longer attend to Mr Branghton who taking up the guinea told him it should be long enough before he'd see it again and walked away  The young ladies in some confusion expressed their surprise that their  papa  should not know the opera prices which for their parts they had read in the papers a thousand times  "The price of stocks"  said he  "is enough for me to see after and I took it for granted it was the same thing here as at the playhouse"  "I knew well enough what the price was"  said the son  "but I would not speak because I thought perhaps they'd take less as we're such a large party"  The sisters both laughed very contemptuously at this idea and asked him if he ever heard of  people's abating  any thing at a public place  "I don't know whether I have or no"  answered he  "but I'm sure if they would you'd like it so much the worse"  "Very true Tom  cried Mr Branghton  "tell a woman that any thing is reasonable and she'll be sure to hate it"  "Well"  said Miss Polly  "I hope that Aunt and Miss will be of our side for Papa always takes part with Tom"  "Come come"  cried Madam Duval  "if you stand talking here we sha'n't get no place at all"  Mr Branghton then enquired the way to the gallery and when we came to the doorkeeper demanded what was to pay  "The usual price Sir"  said the man  "Then give me change"  cried Mr Branghton again putting down his guinea  "For how many Sir"  "Whylet's seefor six"  "For six Sir why you've given me but a guinea"  "  But  a guinea why how much would you have I suppose it i'n't half a guinea apiece here too"  "No Sir only five shillings"  Mr Branghton again took up his unfortunate guinea and protested he would submit to no such imposition I then proposed that we should return home but Madame Duval would not consent and we were conducted by a woman who sells books of the Opera to another gallerydoor where after some disputing Mr Branghton at last paid and we all went up stairs  Madame Duval complained very much of the trouble of going so high but Mr Branghton desired her not to hold the place too cheap  "for whatever you may think"  cried he  "I assure you I paid pit price so don't suppose I come here to save my money"  "Well to be sure"  said Miss Branghton  "there's no judging of a place by the outside else I must needs say there's nothing very extraordinary in the staircase"  But when we entered the gallery their amazement and disappointment became general For a few instants they looked at one another without speaking and then they all broke silence at once  "Lord Papa  exclaimed Miss Polly  "why you have brought us to the oneshilling gallery"  "I'll be glad to give you two shillings though"  answered he  "to pay I was never so fooled out of my money before since the hour of my birth Either the doorkeeper's a knave or this is the greatest imposition that ever was put upon the public"  "  Ma foi  "  cried Madame Duval  "I never sat in such a mean place in all my lifewhy it's as highwe sha'n't see nothing"  "I thought at the time"  said Mr Branghton  "that three shillings was an exorbitant price for a place in the gallery but as we'd been asked so much more at the other doors why I paid it without many words but then to be sure thinks I it never can be like any other gallerywe shall see some  crinkumcrankum  or other for our moneybut I find it's as arrant a takein as ever I met with"  "Why it's as like the twelvepenny gallery at Drurylane"  cried the son  "as two peas are one to another I never knew father so bit before"  "Lord  "said Miss Branghton  "I thought it would have been quite a fine placeall over I don't know whatand done quite in taste"  In this manner they continued to express their dissatisfaction till the curtain drew up after which their observations were very curious They made no allowance for the customs or even for the language of another country but formed all their remarks upon comparisons with the English theatre  Notwithstanding all my vexation at having been forced into a party so very disagreeabl and that too from one so much  so very much the contraryyet would they have suffered me to listen I should have forgotten every thing unpleasant and selt nothing but delight in hearing the sweet voice  of Signor Millico the first singer but they tormented me with continual talking"  "What a jabbering they make"  cried Mr Branghton  "there's no knowing a word they say Pray what's the reason they can't as well sing in Englishbut I suppose the fine folks would not like it if they could understand it"  "How unnatural their action is"  said the son  "why now who ever saw an Englishman put himself in such outoftheway postures"  "For my part"  said Miss Polly  "I think it's very pretty only I don't know what it means"  "Lord what does that signify"  cried her sister  "mayn't one like a thing without being so very particularYou may see that Miss likes it and I don't suppose she knows more of the matter than we do"  A gentleman soon after was so obliging as to make room in the front row for Miss Branghton and me We had no sooner seated ourselves than Miss Branghton exclaimed  "Good gracious only seewhy Polly all the people in the pit are without hats dressed like any thing"  "Lord so they are  cried Miss Polly  "well I never saw the likeit's worth coming to the Opera if one saw nothing else"  I was then able to distinguish the happy party I had left and I saw that Lord Orville had seated himself next to Mrs Mirvan Sir Clement had his eyes perpetually cast towards the five shilling gallery where I suppose he concluded that we were seated however before the Opera was over I have reason to believe that he had discovered me high and distant as I was from him Probably he distinguished me by my headdress  At the end of the first act as the green curtain dropped to prepare for the dance they imagined that the Opera was done and Mr Branghton expressed great indignation that he had been  tricked  out of his money with so little trouble  "Now if any Englishman was to do such an impudent thing as this"  said he  "why he'd be peltedbut here one of these outlandish gentry may do just what he pleases and come on and squeak out a song or two and then pocket your money without further ceremony"  However so determined he was to be dissatisfied that before the conclusion of the third act he found still more fault with the Opera for being too long and wondered whether they thought their singing good enough to serve us for supper  During the symphony of a song of Signor Millico's in the second act young Mr Branghton said  "It's my belief that that fellow's going to sing another songwhy there's nothing but singingI wonder when they'll speak"  This song which was slow and pathetic caught all my attention and I leaned my head forward to avoid hearing their observations that I might listen without interruption but upon turning round when the song was over I found that I was the object of general diversion to the whole party for the Miss Branghtons were tittering and the two gentlemen making signs and faces at me implying their contempt of my affectation  This discovery determined me to appear as inattentive as themselves but I was very much provoked at being thus prevented enjoying the only pleasure which in such a party was within my power  "So Miss"  said Mr Branghton  "you're quite in the fashion I seeso you like Operas well I'm not so polite I can't like nonsense let it be never so much the taste"  "But pray Miss  said the son  "what makes that fellow look so doleful while he's singing"  "Probably because the character he performs is in distress"  "Why then I think he might as well let alone singing till he's in better cue it's out of all nature for a man to be piping when he's in distress For my part I never sing but when I'm merry yet I love a song as well as most people"  When the curtain dropt they all rejoiced  "How do  you  like itand how do  you  like it"  passed from one to another with looks of the utmost contempt  "As for me"  said Mr Branghton  "they've caught me once but if ever they do again I'll give 'em leave to sing me to Bedlam for my pains for such a heap of stuff never did I hear there is n't one ounce of sense in the whole Opera nothing but one continued squeaking and squalling from beginning to end"  "If I had been in the pit"  said Madame Duval  "I should have liked it vastly for music is my passion but sitting in such a place as this is quite unbearable"  Miss Branghton looking at me declared that she was not  genteel  enough to admire it  Miss Polly confessed that if they would but sing  English  she should like it  very well  The brother wished he could raise a riot in the house because then he might get his money again  And finally they all agreed that it was  monstrous dear  During the last dance I perceived standing near the gallerydoor Sir Clement Willoughby I was extremely vexed and would have given the world to have avoided being seen by him my chief objection was from the apprehension that he wou'd hear Miss Branghton call me  cousin  I fear you will think this London journey has made me grow very proud but indeed this family is so lowbred and vulgar that I should be equally ashamed of such a connexion in the country or any where And really I had already been so much chagrined that Sir Clement had been a witness of Madame Duval's power over me that I could not bear to be exposed to any further mortification  As the seats cleared by parties going away Sir Clement approached nearer to us the Miss Branghtons observed with surprise what a fine gentleman was come into the gallery and they gave me great reason to expect that they would endeavour to attract his notice by familiarity with me whenever he should join us and so I formed a sort of plan to prevent any conversation I am afraid you will think it wrong and so I do myself nowbut at the time I only considered how I might avoid immediate humiliation  As soon as he was within two seats of us he spoke to me  "I am very happy Miss Anville to have sound you for the Ladies below have each an humble attendant and therefore I am come to offer my services here"  "Why then"  cried I not without hesitating  "if you pleaseI will join them"  "Will you allow me the honour of conducting you"  cried he eagerly and instantly taking my hand he would have marched away with me but I turned to Madame Duval and said  "As our  party is so large Madam if you will give me leave I will go down to Mrs Mirvan that I may not crowd you in the coach"  And then without waiting for an answer I suffered Sir Clement to hand me out of the gallery  Madame Duval I doubt not will be very angry and so I am with myself now and therefore I cannot be surprised but Mr Branghton I am sure will easily comfort himself in having escaped the additional coach expence of carrying me to QueenAnnstreet as to his daughters they had no time to speak but I saw they were in utter amazement  My intention was to join Mrs Mirvan and accompany her home Sir Clement was in high spirits and good humour and all the way we went I was fool enough to rejoice in secret at the success of my plan nor was it till I got down stairs and amidst the servants that any difficulty occurred to me of meeting with my friends  I then asked Sir Clement how I should contrive to acquaint Mrs Mirvan that I had left Madame Duval  "I fear it will be almost impossible to find her  answered he  "but you can have no objection to permitting me to see you safe home"  He then desired his servant who was waiting to order his chariot to draw up  This quite startled me I turned to him hastily and said that I could not think of going away without Mrs Mirvan  "But how can we meet with her"  cried he  "you will not chuse to go into the pit yourself I cannot send a servant there and it is impossible for  me  to go and leave you alone"  The truth of this was indisputable and totally silenced me Yet as soon as I could recollect myself I determined not to go in his chariot and told him I believed I had best return to my party up stairs  He would not hear of this and earnestly entreated me not to withdraw the trust I had reposed in him  While he was speaking I saw Lord Orville with several ladies and gentlemen coming from the pit passage unfortunately he saw me too and leaving his company advanced instantly towards me and with an air and voice of surprise said  "Good God do I see Miss Anville"  I now most severely felt the folly of my plan and the aukwardness of my situation however I hastened to tell him though in a hesitating manner that I was waiting for Mrs Mirvan but what was my disappointment when he acquainted me that she was already gone home  I was inexpressibly distressed to suffer Lord Orville to think me satisfied with the single protection of Sir Clement Willoughby I could not bear yet I was more than ever averse to returning to a party which I dreaded his seeing I stood some moments in suspense and could not help exclaiming  "Good Heaven what can I do"  "Why my dear Madam"  cried Sir Clement  "should you be thus uneasyyou will reach QueenAnn street almost as soon as Mrs Mirvan and I am sure you cannot doubt being as safe"  I made no answer and Lord Orville then said  "My coach is here and my servants are ready to take any commands Miss Anville will honour me with for them I shall myself go home in a chair and therefore"  How grateful did I feel for a proposal so considerate and made with so much delicacy I should gladly have accepted it had I been permitted but Sir Clement would not let him even finish his speech he interrupted him with evident displeasure and said  "My Lord my own chariot is now at the door"  And just then the servant came and told him the carriage was ready He begged to have the honour of conducting me to it and would have taken my hand but I drew it back saying  "I can'tI can't indeed pray go by yourselfand as to me let me have a chair"  "Impossible"  cried he with vehemence  "I cannot think of trusting you with strange chairmenI cannot answer it to Mrs Mirvancome dear Madam we shall be home in five minutes"  Again I stood suspended With what joy would I then have compromised with my pride to have been once more with Madame Duval and the Branghtons provided I had not met with Lord Orville However I flatter myself that he not only saw but pitied my embarrassment for he said in a tone of voice unusually softened  "To offer my services in the presence of Sir Clement Willoughby would be superfluous but I hope I need not assure Miss Anville how happy it would make me to be of the least use to her"  I courtsied my thanks Sir Clement with great eagerness pressed me to go and while I was thus uneasily deliberating what to do the dance I suppose finished for the people crowded down stairs Had Lord Orville then repeated his offer I should have accepted it notwithstanding Sir Clement's repugnance but I fancy he thought it would be impertinent In a very few minutes I heard Madame  Duval's voice as she descended from the gallery  "Well"  cried I hastily  "if I must go"  I stopt but Sir Clement immediately handed me into his chariot called out  "QueenAnnstreet"  and then jumped in himself Lord Orville with a bow and a half smile wished me good night  My concern was so great at being seen and left by Lord Orville in so strange a situation that I should have been best pleased to have remained wholly silent during our ride home but Sir Clement took care to prevent that  He began by making many complaints of my unwillingness to trust myself with him and begged to know what could be the reason This question so much embarrassed me that I could not tell what to answer but only said that I was sorry to have taken up so much of his time  "O Miss Anville"  cried he taking my hand  "if you knew with what transport I would dedicate to you not only the present but all the future time allotted to me you would not injure me by making such an apology"  I could not think of a word to say to this nor to a great many other equally fine speeches with which he ran on though I would fain have withdrawn my hand and made almost continual attempts but in vain for he actually grasped it between both his without any regard to my resistance  Soon after he said that he believed the coachman was going the wrong way and he called to his servant and gave him directions Then addressing himself to me  "How often how assiduously have I sought an opportunity of speaking to you without the presence of that brute Captain Mirvan Fortune has now kindly favoured me  with one and permit me"  again seizing my hand  "permit me to use it in telling you that I adore you"  I was quite thunderstruck at this abrupt and unexpected declaration For some moments I was silent but when I recovered from my surprise I said  "Indeed Sir if you were determined to make me repent leaving my own party so foolishly you have very well succeeded"  "My dearest life"  cried he  "is it possible you can be so cruel Can your nature and your countenance be so totally opposite Can the sweet bloom upon those charming cheeks which appears as much the result of goodhumour as of beauty"  "O Sir  cried I interrupting him  "this is very fine but I had hoped we had had enough of this sort of conversation at the Ridotto and I did not expect you would so soon resume it"  "What I then said my sweet reproacher was the effect of a mistaken a prophane idea that your understanding held no competition with your beauty but now now that I find you equally incomparable in both all words all powers of speech are too feeble to express the admiration I feel of your excellencies"  "Indeed"  cried I  "if you did not talk in one language and think in another you would never suppose that I could give credit to praise so very much above my desert"  This speech which I made very gravely occasioned still stronger protestations which he continued to pour forth and I continued to disclaim till I began to wonder that we were not in QueenAnnStreet and begged he would desire the coachman to drive faster  "And does this little moment"  cried he  "which is the first of happiness I have ever known does it already appear so very long to you"  "I am afraid the man has mistaken the way"  answered I  "or else we should ere now have been at our journey's end I must beg you will speak to him"  "And can you think me so much my own enemyif my good genius has inspired the man with a desire of prolonging my happiness can you expect that I should counteract its indulgence"  I now began to apprehend that he had himself ordered the man to go a wrong way and I was so much alarmed at the idea that the very instant it occurred to me I let down the glass and made a sudden effort to open the chariotdoor myself with a view of jumping into the street but he caught hold of me exclaiming  "For Heaven's sake what is the matter"  "II don't know"  cried I quite out of breath  "but I am sure the man goes wrong and if you will not speak to him I am determined I will get out myself"  "You amaze me"  answered he still holding me  "I cannot imagine what you apprehend Surely you can have no doubts of my honour"  He drew me towards him as he spoke I was dreadfully frightened and could hardly say  "No Sir nonone at allonly Mrs MirvanI think she will be uneasy"  "Whence this alarm my dearest angelWhat can you fearmy life is at your devotion and can you then doubt my protection"  And so saying he passionately kissed my hand  Never in my whole life have I been so terrified I broke forcibly from him and putting my head out of the window called aloud to the man to stop Where we then were I knew not but I saw not a human being or I should have called for help  Sir Clement with great earnestness endeavoured to appease and compose me  "If you do not intend to murder me"  cried I  "for mercy's for pity's sake let me get out"  "Compose your spirits my dearest life"  cried he  "and I will do every thing you would have me"  And then he called to the man himself and bid him make haste to QueenAnnStreet  "This stupid fellow"  continued he  "has certainly mistaken my orders but I hope you are now fully satisfied"  I made no answer but kept my head at the window watching which way he drove but without any comfort to myself as I was quite unacquainted with either the right or the wrong  Sir Clement now poured forth abundant protestations of honour and assurances of respect entreating my pardon for having offended me and beseeching my good opinion but I was quite silent having too much apprehension to make reproaches and too much anger to speak without  In this manner we went through several streets till at last to my great terror he suddenly ordered the man to stop and said  "Miss Anville we are now within twenty yards of your house but I cannot bear to part with you till you generously forgive me for the offence you have taken and promise not to make it known to the Mirvans"  I hesitated between fear and indignation  "Your reluctance to speak redoubles my contrition for having displeased you since it shews the reliance I might have on a promise which you will not give without consideration"  "I am very very much distressed"  cried I  "you ask a promise which you must be sensible I ought not to grant and yet dare not refuse"  "Drive on"  cried he to the coachman  "Miss Anville I will not compel you I will exact no promise but trust wholly to your generosity"  This rather softened me which advantage he no sooner perceived than he determined to avail himself of for he flung himself on his knees and pleaded with so much submission that I was really obliged to forgive him because his humiliation made me quite ashamed and after that he would not let me rest till I gave him my word that I would not complain of him to Mrs Mirvan  My own folly and pride which had put me in his power were pleas which I could not but attend to in his favour However I shall take very particular care never to be again alone with him  When at last we arrived at our house I was so overjoyed that I should certainly have pardoned him then if I had not before As he handed me up stairs he scolded his servant aloud and very angrily for having gone so much out of the way Miss Mirvan ran out to meet meand who should I see behind her butLord Orville  All my joy now vanished and gave place to shame and confusion for I could not endure that he should know how long a time Sir Clement and  I had been together since I was not at liberty to assign any reason for it  They all expressed great satisfaction at seeing me and said they had been extremely uneasy and surprised that I was so long coming home as they had heard from Lord Orville that I was not with Madame Duval Sir Clement in an affected passion said that his booby of a servant had misunderstood his orders and was driving us to the upper end of Piccadilly For my part I only coloured for though I would not forfeit my word I yet disdained to confirm a tale in which I had myself no belief  Lord Orville with great politeness congratulated me that the troubles of the evening had so happily ended and said that he had found it impossible to return home before he enquired after my safety  In a very short time he took leave and Sir Clement followed him As soon as they were gone Mrs Mirvan though with great softness blamed me for having quitted Madame Duval I assured her and with truth that for the future I would be more prudent  The adventures of the evening so much disconcerted me that I could not sleep all night I am under the most cruel apprehensions left Lord Orville should suppose my being on the gallerystairs with Sir Clement was a concerted scheme and even that our continuing so long together in his chariot was with my approbation since I did not say a word on the subject nor express any dissatisfaction at the coachman's pretended blunder  Yet his coming hither to wait our arrival though it seems to imply some doubt shews also some anxiety Indeed Miss Mirvan says that he  appeared  extremely  anxious nay uneasy and impatient for my return If I did not fear to flatter myself I should think it not impossible but that he had a suspicion of Sir Clement's design and was therefore concerned for my safety  What a long letter is this however I shall not write many more from London for the Captain said this morning that he would leave town on Tuesday next Madame Duval will dine here today and then she is to be told his intention  I am very much amazed that she accepted Mrs Mirvan's invitation as she was in such wrath yesterday I fear that today I shall myself be the principal object of her displeasure but I must submit patiently for I cannot defend myself  Adieu my dearest Sir Should this letter be productive of any uneasiness to you more than ever shall I repent the heedless imprudence which it recites  LETTER XXII  Evelina in continuation  Monday Morning April  MRS Mirvan has just communicated to me an anecdote concerning Lord Orville which has much surprised half pleased and half pained me  While they were sitting together during the Opera he told her that he had been greatly concerned at the impertinence which the young lady under her protection had suffered from Mr Lovel but that he had the pleasure of assuring her she had no future disturbance to apprehend from him  Mrs Mirvan with great eagerness begged he would explain himself and said she hoped he had not thought so insignificant an affair worthy his serious attention  "There is nothing"  answered he  "which requires more immediate notice than impertinence for it ever encroaches when it is tolerated"  He then added that he believed he ought to apologize for the liberty he had taken of interfering but that as he regarded himself in the light of a  party concerned  from having had the honour of dancing with Miss Anville he could not possibly reconcile to himself a patient neutrality  He then proceeded to tell her that he had waited upon Mr Lovel the morning after the play that the visit had proved an amicable one but the particulars were neither entertaining nor necessary he only assured her Miss Anville might be perfectly easy since Mr Lovel had engaged his honour never more to mention or even to hint at what had passed at Mrs Stanley's assembly  Mrs Mirvan expressed her satisfaction at this conclusion and thanked him for his polite attention to her young friend  "It would be needless"  said he  "to request that this affair may never transpire since Mrs Mirvan cannot but see the necessity of keeping it inviolably secret but I thought it incumbent upon me as the young lady is under your protection to assure both you and her of Mr Lovel's future respect"  Had I known of this visit previous to Lord Orville's making it what dreadful uneasiness would it have cost me Yet that he should so much interest himself in securing me from offence gives  me I must own an internal pleasure greater than I can express for I feared he had too contemptuous an opinion of me to take any trouble upon my account Though after all this interference might rather be to satisfy his own delicacy than from thinking well of me  But how cool how quiet is true courage Who from seeing Lord Orville at the play would have imagined his resentment would have hazarded his life yet his displeasure was evident though his real bravery and his politeness equally guarded him from entering into any discussion in our presence  Madame Duval as I expected was most terribly angry yesterday she scolded me for I believe two hours on account of having left her and protested she had been so much surprised at my going without giving her time to answer that she hardly knew whether she was awake or asleep But she assured me that if ever I did so again she would never more take me into public And she expressed an equal degree of displeasure against Sir Clement because he had not even spoken to her and because he was always of the Captain's side in an argument The Captain as bound in honour warmly defended him and then followed a dispute in the usual style  After dinner Mrs Mirvan introduced the subject of our leaving London Madame Duval said she should stay a month or two longer The Captain told her she was welcome but that he and his family should go into the country on Tuesday morning  A most disagreeable scene followed Madame Duval insisted upon keeping me with her but Mrs Mirvan said that as I was actually engaged on a visit to Lady Howard who had only consented to  my leaving her for a few days she could not think of returning without me  Perhaps if the Captain had not interfered the goodbreeding and mildness of Mrs Mirvan might have had some effect upon Madame Duval but he passes no opportunity of provoking her and therefore made so many gross and rude speeches all of which she retorted that in conclusion she vowed she would sooner go to law in right of her relationship than that I should be taken away from her  I heard this account from Mrs Mirvan who was so kindly considerate as to give me a pretence for quitting the room as soon as this dispute begun lest Madame Duval should refer to me and insist on my obedience  The final result of the conversation was that to soften matters for the present Madame Duval should make one in the party for Howard Grove whither we are positively to go next Wednesday  Mrs Mirvan is now writing to Lady Howard to excuse bringing this unexpected guest and to prevent the disagreeable surprise which must otherwise attend her reception This dear lady seems eternally studying my happiness and advantage  Tonight we go to the Pantheon which is the last diversion we shall partake of in London for tomorrow  This moment my dearest Sir I have received your kind letter  If you thought us too dissipated the first week I almost fear to know what you will think of us  this secondhowever the Pantheon this evening will probably be the last public place which I shall ever see  The assurance of your support and protection in regard to Madame Duval though what I never doubted excites my utmost gratitude how indeed cherished under your roof the happy object of your constant indulgence how could I have borne to become the slave of her tyrannical humourspardon me that I speak so hardly of her but whenever the idea of passing my days with her occurs to me the comparison which naturally follows takes from me all that forbearance which I believe I owe her  You are already displeased with Sir Clement to be sure then his behaviour after the opera will not make his peace with you Indeed the more I reflect upon it the more angry I am I was entirely in his power and it was cruel in him to cause me so much terror  O my dearest Sir were I but worthy the prayers and the wishes you offer for me the utmost ambition of my heart would be fully satisfied but I greatly fear you will find me now that I am out of the reach of your assisting prudence more weak and imperfect than you could have expected  I have not now time to write another word for I must immediately hasten to dress for the evening  LETTER XXIII  Evelina in continuation  QueenAnnstreet  Tuesday April  THERE is something to me half melancholy in writing an account of our last adventures in London however as this day is merely appropriated to packing and preparations for our journey and as I shall shortly have no more adventures to write I think I may as well complete my town journal at once And when you have it all together I hope my dear Sir you will send me your observations and thoughts upon it to Howard Grove  About eight o'clock we went to the Pantheon I was extremely struck with the beauty of the building which greatly surpassed whatever I could have expected or imagined Yet it has more the appearance of a chapel than of a place of diversion and though I was quite charmed with the magnificence of the room I felt that I could not be as gay and thoughtless there as at Ranelagh for there is something in it which rather inspires awe and solemnity than mirth and pleasure However perhaps it may only have this effect upon such a novice as myself  I should have said that our party consisted only of Captain Mrs and Miss Mirvan as Madame Duval spent the day in the citywhich I own I could not lament  There was a great deal of company but the first person we saw was Sir Clement Willoughby He addressed us with his usual ease and joined us  for the whole evening I felt myself very uneasy in his presence for I could not look at him nor hear him speak without recollecting the chariot adventure but to my great amazement I observed that he looked at  me  without the least apparent discomposure though certainly he ought not to think of his behaviour without blushing I really wish I had not forgiven him and then he could not have ventured to speak to me any more  There was an exceeding good concert but too much talking to hear it well Indeed I am quite astonished to find how little music is attended to in silence for though every body seems to admire hardly any body listens  We did not see Lord Orville till we went into the tearoom which is large low and under ground and serves merely as a foil to the apartments above he then sat next to us he seemed to belong to a large party chiefly of ladies but among the gentlemen attending them I perceived Mr Lovel  I was extremely irresolute whether or not I ought to make any acknowledgments to Lord Orville for his generous conduct in securing me from the future impertinence of that man and I thought that as he had seemed to allow Mrs Mirvan to acquaint me though no one else of the measures which he had taken he might perhaps suppose me ungrateful if silent however I might have spared myself the trouble of deliberating as I never once had the shadow of an opportunity of speaking unheard by Sir Clement On the contrary he was so exceedingly officious and forward that I could not say a word to any body but instantly he bent his head forward with an air of profound attention as if I had addressed myself wholly to  him and yet I never once looked at him and would not have spoken to him on any account  Indeed Mrs Mirvan herself though unacquainted with the behaviour of Sir Clement after the opera says it is not right for a young woman to be seen so frequently in public with the same gentleman and if our stay in town was to be lengthened she would endeavour to represent to the Captain the impropriety of allowing his constant attendance for Sir Clement with all his  easiness  could not be so eternally of our parties if the Captain was less fond of his company  At the same table with Lord Orville sat a gentlemanI call him so only because he  was  at the same tablewho almost from the moment I was seated fixed his eyes stedfastly on my face and never once removed them to any other object during teatime notwithstanding my dislike of his staring must I am sure have been very evident I was quite surprised that a man whose boldness was so offensive could have gained admission into a party of which Lord Orville made one for I naturally concluded him to be some lowbred and uneducated man and I thought my idea was indubitably confirmed when I heard him say to Sir Clement Willoughby in an  audible whisper  which is a mode of speech very distressing and disagreeable to bystanders  "For Heaven's sake Willoughby who is that lovely creature"  But what was my amazement when listening attentively for the answer though my head was turned another away I heard Sir Clement say  "I am sorry I cannot inform your Lordship but I am ignorant myself"  Lordship  how extraordinary that a  nobleman  accustomed in all probability to the first rank  of company in the kingdom from his earliest infancy can possibly be deficient in  good manners  however faulty in morals and principles Even Sir Clement Willoughby appeared modest in comparison with this person  During tea a conversation was commenced upon the times fashions and public places in which the company of both tables joined It began by Sir Clement's enquiring of Miss Mirvan and of me if the Pantheon had answered our expectations  We both readily agreed that it had greatly exceeded them  "Ay to be sure"  said the Captain  "why you don't suppose they'd confess they did n't like it do you Whatever's the fashion they must like of courseor else I'd be bound for it they'd own that there never was such a dull place as this here invented"  "And has then this building"  said Lord Orville  "no merit that may serve to lessen your censure Will not your eye Sir speak something in its favour"  "Eye"  cried the Lord I don't know his name  "and is there any eye here that can find any pleasure in looking at dead walls or statues when such heavenly living objects as I now see demand all their admiration"  "O certainly"  said Lord Orville  "the lifeless symmetry of architecture however beautiful the design and proportion no man would be so mad as to put in competition with the animated charms of nature but when as tonight the eye may be regaled at the same time and in one view with all the excellence of art and all the perfection of nature I cannot think that either suffer by being seen together"  "I grant my Lord"  said Sir Clement  "that the cool eye of unimpassioned philosophy may view both with equal attention and equal safety but where the heart is not so well guarded it is apt to interfere and render even to the eye all objects but one insipid and uninteresting"  "Aye aye"  cried the Captain  "you may talk what you will of your eye here and your eye there and for the matter of that to be sure you have twobut we all know they both squint one way"  "Far be it from me"  said Lord Orville  "to dispute the  magnetic  power of beauty which irresistibly draws and attracts whatever has soul and sympathy and I am happy to acknowledge that though we have now no  gods  to occupy a mansion professedly built for them yet we have secured their  better halves  for we have  goddesses  to whom we all most willingly bow down"  And then with a very droll air he made a profound reverence to the ladies  "They'd need be goddesses with a vengeance"  said the Captain  "for they're mortal dear to look at Howsomever I should be glad to know what you can see in e'er a face among them that's worth half a guinea for a sight"  "Half a guinea"  exclaimed that same Lord  "I would give half I am worth for a sight of only  one  provided I make my own choice And prithee how can money be better employed than in the service of fine women"  "If the ladies of his own party can pardon the Captain's speech"  said Sir Clement  "I think he has a fair claim to the forgiveness of all"  "Then you depend very much as I doubt not but you may"  said Lord Orville  "upon the general  sweetness of the sexbut as to the ladies of the Captain's party they may easily pardon for they cannot be hurt"  "But they must have a devilish good conceit of themselves though"  said the Captain  "to believe all that Howsomever whether or no I should be glad to be told by some of you who seem to be knowing in them things what kind of diversion can be found in such a place as this here for one who has had long ago his full of facehunting"  Every body laughed but nobody spoke  "Why look you there now"  continued the Captain  "you're all at a dead standnot a man among you can answer that there question Why then I must make bold to conclude that you all come here for no manner of purpose but to stare at one another's pretty facesthough for the matter of that half of 'em are plaguy uglyand as to t'other halfI believe it's none of God's manufactory"  "What the ladies may come hither for Sir"  said Mr Lovel stroking his ruffles and looking down  "it would ill become  us  to determine but as to we men doubtless we can have no other view than to admire them"  "If I be n't mistaken"  cried the Captain looking earnestly in his face  "you are that same person we saw at Love for Love t'other nightbe n't you"  Mr Lovel bowed  "Why then Gentlemen"  continued he with a loud laugh  "I must tell you a most excellent good jokewhen all was over as sure as you're alive he asked what the play was Ha ha ha"  "Sir"  said Mr Lovel colouring  "if you were as much used to a town life as I amwhich I presume is not precisely the caseI fancy you would not find so much diversion from a circumstance so common"  "Common what is it common"  repeated the Captain  "why then 'fore George such chaps are more fit to be sent to school and well disciplined with a cat o' nine tails than to poke their heads into a playhouse Why a play is the only thing left nowadays that has a grain of sense in it for as to all the rest of your public places d'ye see if they were all put together I would n't give  that  for 'em"  snapping his fingers  "And now we're talking of them sort of things there's your operasI should like to know now what any of you can find to say for them"  Lord Orville who was most able to have answered seemed by no means to think the Captain worthy an argument upon a subject concerning which he had neither knowledge nor feeling but turning to us he said  "The ladies are silent and we seem to have engrossed the conversation to ourselves in which we are much more our own enemies than theirs But"  addressing himself to Miss Mirvan and me  "I am most desirous to hear the opinions of these young ladies to whom all public places must as yet be new"  We both and with eagerness declared that we had received as much if not more pleasure at the opera than any where but we had better have been silent for the Captain quite displeased said  what signifies asking them girls Do you think they know their own minds yet Ask 'em after any thing that's called diversion and you're sure they'll say it's vastly finethey are set of  parrots and speak by rote for they all say the same thing but ask 'em how they like making puddings and pies and I'll warrant you'll pose 'em As to them operas I desire I may hear no more of their liking such monsense and for you Moll"  to his daughter  "I charge you as you value my favour that you'll never again be so impertinent as to have a taste of your own before my face There are fools enough in the world without your adding to their number I'll have no daughter of mine affect them sort of megrims It is a shame they a'n't put down and if I'd my will there's not a magistrate in this town but should be knocked of the head for suffering them If you've a mind to praise any thing why you may praise a play and welcome for I like it myself"  This reproof effectually silenced us both for the rest of the evening Nay indeed for some minutes it seemed to silence every body else till Mr Lovel not willing to lose an opportunity of returning the Captain's sarcasm said  "Why really Sir it is but natural to be most pleased with what is most familiar and I think of all our diversions there is not one so much in common between us and the country as a play Not a village but has its barns and comedians and as for the stagebusiness why it may be pretty equally done any where and even in regard to  us  and the  canaille  confined as we all are within the semicircle of a theatre there is no place where the distinction is less obvious"  While the Captain seemed considering for Mr Lovel's meaning Lord Orville probably with a view to prevent his finding it changed the subject  to Cox's Museum and asked what he thought of it  "Think"  said he  "why I think as how it i'n't worth thinking about I like no such  jem cracks  It is only fit in my mind for monkeysthough for I aught I know they too might turn up their noses at it"  "May we ask your Lordship's own opinion"  said Mrs Mirvan  "The mechanism"  answered he  "is wonderfully ingenious I am sorry it is turned to no better account but its purport is so frivolous so very remote from all aim at instruction or utility that the sight of so fine a shew only leaves a regret on the mind that so much work and so much ingenuity should not be better bestowed"  "The truth is"  said the Captain  "that in all this huge town so full as it is of folks of all sorts there i'n't so much as one public place besides the playhouse where a man that's to say a man who  is  a man ought not to be ashamed to shew his face T'other day they got me to a ridotto but I believe it will be long enough before they get me to another I knew no more what to do with myself than if my ship's company had been metamorphosed into Frenchmen Then again there's your famous Ranelagh that you make such a fuss aboutwhy what a dull place is thatits the worst of all"  "Ranelagh dull""Ranelagh dull"  was echoed from mouth to mouth and all the ladies as if of one accord regarded the Captain with looks of the most ironical contempt  "As to Ranelagh"  said Mr Lovel  "most indubitably though the price is plebeian it is by no means adapted to the plebeian taste It requires  a certain acquaintance with high life andandand something ofofsomething  d'un vrai go√ªt  to be really sensible of its merit Those whosewhose connections and so forth are not among  les gens comme il faut  can feel nothing but  ennui  at such a place as Ranelagh  "Ranelagh"  cried Lord  "O 'tis the divinest place under heavenor indeedfor aught I know "  "O you creature"  cried a pretty but affected young lady patting him with her fan  "you shan't talk so I know what you are going to say but positively I won't sit by you if you're so wicked"  "And how can one sit by you and be good"  said he  "when only to look at you is enough to make one wickedor wish to be so"  "Fie my Lord"  returned she  "you are really insufferable I don't think I shall speak to you again these seven years"  "What a metamorphosis"  cried Lord Orville  "should you make a patriarch of his Lordship"  "Seven years"  said he  "dear Madam be contented with telling me you will not speak to me  after  seven years and I will endeavour to submit"  "O very well my Lord"  answered she  "pray date the end of our speaking to each other as early as you please I'll promise to agree to your time"  "You know dear Madam"  said he sipping his tea  "you know I only live in your sight"  "O yes my Lord I have long known that But I begin to fear we shall be too late for Ranelagh this evening"  "O no Madam"  said Mr Lovel looking at his watch  "it is but just past ten"  "No more"  cried she  "O then we shall do very well"  All the ladies then started up and declared they had no time to lose  "Why what the Dl"  cried the Captain leaning forward with both his arms on the table  are you going to Ranelagh at this time of night"  The ladies looked at one another and smiled  "To Ranelagh"  cried Lord  "Yes and I hope you are going too for we cannot possibly excuse these ladies"  "I go to Ranelaghif I do I'll be "  Every body now stood up and the stranger Lord coming round to me said  "  You  go I hope"  "No my Lord I believe not"  "O you cannot must not be so barbarous"  And he took my hand and ran on saying such fine speeches and compliments that I might almost have supposed myself a goddess and him a pagan paying me adoration As soon as I possibly could I drew back my hand but he frequently in the course of conversation contrived to take it again though it was extremely disagreeable to me and the more so as I saw that Lord Orville had his eyes fixed upon us with a gravity of attention that made me uneasy  And surely my dear Sir it was a great liberty in this Lord notwithstanding his rank to treat me  so freely As to Sir Clement he seemed in misery  They all endeavoured to prevail with the Captain to join the Ranelagh party and this Lord told me in a low voice that  it was tearing his heart out  to go without me  During this conversation Mr Lovel came forward and assuming a look of surprise made me a bow and enquired how I did protesting upon his honour that he had not seen me before or would sooner have paid his respects to me  Though his politeness was evidently constrained yet I was very glad to be thus assured of having nothing more to fear from him  The Captain far from listening to their persuasions of accompanying them to Ranelagh was quite in a passion at the proposal and vowed he would sooner go to the  Blackhole in Calcutta  "But"  said Lord  "if the  ladies  will take their tea at Ranelagh you may depend upon our seeing them safe home for we shall all be proud of the honour of attending them"  "May be so"  said the Captain  "but I'll tell you what if one of these places be n't enough for them tonight why tomorrow they shall go to ne'er a one"  We instantly declared ourselves very ready to go home  "It is not for yourselves that we petition"  said Lord  "but for  us  if you have any charity you will not be so cruel as to deny us we only beg you to prolong our happiness for a few minutesthe favour is but a small one for you to grant though so great a one for us to receive"  "To tell you a piece of my mind"  said the Captain surlily  "I think you might as well not  give the girls so much of this palaver they'll take it all for gospel As to Moll why she's well enough but nothing extraordinary though perhaps you may persuade her that her pugnose is all the fashion and as to the other why she's good white and red to be sure but what of thatI'll warrant she'll moulder away as fast as her neighbours"  "Is there"  cried Lord  "another man in this place who seeing such objects could make such a speech"  "As to that there"  returned the Captain  "I don't know whether there be or no and to make free I don't care for I sha'n't go for to model myself by any of these fairweather chaps who dare not so much as say their souls are their ownand for aught I know no more they ben't I'm almost as much ashamed of my countrymen as if I was a Frenchman and I believe in my heart there i'n't a pin to chuse between them and before long we shall hear the very sailors talking that lingo and see never a swabber without a bag and a sword"  "He he hewell 'pon honour"  cried Mr Lovel  "you gentlemen of the ocean have a most severe way of judging"  "Severe 'fore George that is impossible for to cut the matter short the men as they call themselves are no better than monkeys and as to the women why they are mere dolls So now you've got my opinion of this subject and so I wish you good night"  The ladies who were very impatient to be gone made their courtsies and tripped away followed by all the gentlemen of their party except the Lord I have beforementioned and Lord  Orville who stayed to make enquiries of Mrs Mirvan concerning our leaving town and then saying with his usual politeness something civil to each of us with a very grave air he quitted us  Lordremained some minutes longer which he spent in making a prosusion of compliments to me by which he prevented my hearing distinctly what Lord Orville said to my great vexation especially as he lookedI thought so at leastas if displeased at his particularity of behaviour to me  In going to an outward room to wait for the carriage I walked and could not possibly avoid it between this nobleman and Sir Clement Willoughby and when the servant said the coach stopped the way though the latter offered me his hand which I should much have preferred this same Lord without any ceremony took mine himself and Sir Clement with a look extremely provoked conducted Mrs Mirvan  In all ranks and all stations of lise how strangely do characters and manners differ Lord Orville with a politeness which knows no intermission and makes no distinction is as unassuming and modest as if he had never mixed with the great and was totally ignorant of every qualification he possesses this other Lord though lavish of compliments and fine speeches seems to be an entire stranger to real good breeding whoever strikes his fancy engrosses his whole attention He is forward and bold has an air of haughtiness towards men and a look of libertinism towards women and his concious quality seems to have given him a freedom in his way of speaking to either sex that is very little short of rudeness  When we returned home we were all lowspirited the evening's entertainment had displeased the Captain and his displeasure I believe disconcerted us all  And here I thought to have concluded my letter but to my great surprise just now we had a visit from Lord Orville He called he said to pay his respects to us before we left town and made many enquiries concerning our return and when Mrs Mirvan told him we were going into the country without any view of again quitting it he expressed his concern in such termsso polite so flattering so seriousthat I could hardly forbear being sorry myself Were I to go immediately to Berry Hill I am sure I should feel nothing but joybut now we are joined by this Captain and by Madame Duval I must own I expect very little pleasure at Howard Grove  Before Lord Orville went Sir Clement Willoughby called He was more grave than I had ever seen him and made several attempts to speak to me in a low voice and to assure me that his regret upon the occasion of our journey was entirely upon my account But I was not in spirits and could not bear to be teazed by him However he has so well paid his court to Captain Mirvan that he gave him a very hearty invitation to the Grove At this he brightenedand just then Lord Orville took his leave  No doubt but he was disgusted at this illtimed illbred partiality for surely it was very wrong to make an invitation before Lord Orville in which he was not included I was so much chagrined that as soon as he went I left the room and I shall not go down stairs till Sir Clement is gone  Lord Orville cannot but observe his assiduous endeavours to ingratiate himself into my favour and does not this extravagant civility of Captain Mirvan give him reason to suppose that it meets with our general approbation I cannot think upon this subject without inexpressible uneasinessand yet I can think of nothing else  Adieu my dearest Sir Pray write to me immediately How many long letters has this one short fortnight produced More than I may probably ever write again I fear I shall have tired you with reading them but you will now have time to rest for I shall find but little to say in future  And now most honoured Sir with all the follies and imperfections which I have thus faithfully recounted can you and with unabated kindness suffer me to sign myself  Your dutiful and most affectionate EVELINA  LETTER XXIV  Mr Villars to Evelina  Berry Hill  April  HOW much do I rejoice that I can again address my letters to Howard Grove My Evelina would have grieved had she known the anxiety of my mind during her residence in the great world My apprehensions have been inexpressibly alarming and your journal at once exciting and  relieving my fears has almost wholly occupied me since the time of your dating it from London  Sir Clement Willoughby must be an artful designing man I am extremely irritated at his conduct The passion he pretends for you has neither sincerity nor honour the manner and the opportunities he has chosen to declare it are bordering upon insult  His unworthy behaviour after the opera convinces me that had not your vehemence frightened him QueenAnnStreet would have been the last place whither he would have ordered his chariot O my child how thankful am I for your escape I need not now I am sure enlarge upon your indiscretion and want of thought in so hastily trusting yourself with a man so little known to you and whose gaiety and flightiness should have put you on your guard  The nobleman you met at the Pantheon bold and forward as you describe him to be gives me no apprehension a man who appears so openly licentious and who makes his attack with so little regard to decorum is one who to such a mind as my Evelina's can never be seen but with the disgust which his manners ought to excite  But Sir Clement though he seeks occasions to give real offence contrives to avoid all appearance of intentional evil He is far more dangerous because more artful but I am happy to observe that he seems to have made no impression upon your heart and therefore a very little care and prudence may secure you from those designs which I fear he has formed  Lord Orville appears to be of a better order of beings His spirited conduct to the meanly impertinent Lovel and his anxiety for you after the  opera prove him to be a man of sense and of feeling Doubtless he thought there was much reason to tremble for your safety while exposed to the power of Sir Clement and he acted with a regard to real honour that will always incline me to think well of him in so immediately acquainting the Mirvan family with your situation Many men of this age from a false and pretended delicacy to a friend would have quietly pursued their own affairs and thought it more honourable to leave an unsuspecting young creature to the mercy of a libertine than to risk his displeasure by taking measures for her security  Your evident concern at leaving London is very natural and yet it afflicts me I ever dreaded your being too much pleased with a life of dissipation which youth and vivacity render but too alluring and I almost regret the consent for your journey which I had not the resolution to withhold  Alas my child the artlessness of your nature and the simplicity of your education alike unfit you for the thorny paths of the great and busy world The supposed obscurity of your birth and situation makes you liable to a thousand disagreeable adventures Not only my views but my hopes for your future life have ever centered in the country Shall I own to you that however I may differ from Captain Mirvan in other respects yet my opinion of the town its manners inhabitants and diversions is much upon a level with his own Indeed it is the general harbour of fraud and of folly of duplicity and of impertinence and I wish few things more fervently than that you may have taken a lasting leave of it  Remember however that I only speak in regard to a public and a dissipated life in private families we may doubtless find as much goodness honesty and virtue in London as in the country  If contented with a retired station I still hope I shall live to see my Evelina the ornament of her neighbourhood and the pride and delight of her family giving and receiving joy from such society as may best deserve her affection and employing herself in such useful and innocent occupations as may secure and merit the tenderest love of her friends and the worthiest satisfaction of her own heart  Such are my hopes and such have been my expectations Disappoint them not my beloved child but chear me with a few lines that may assure me this one short fortnight spent in town has not undone the work of seventeen years spent in the country  ARTHUR VILLARS  LETTER XXV  Evelina to the Rev Mr Villars  Howard Grove  April  NO my dear Sir no  the work of seventeen years  remains such as it was ever unworthy your time and your labour but not more so nowat least I hope notthan before that fortnight which has so much alarmed you  And yet I must confess that I am not half so happy here at present as I was ere I went to town but the change is in the place not in me Captain  Mirvan and Madame Duval have ruined Howard Grove The harmony that reigned here is disturbed our schemes are broken our way of life is altered and our comfort is destroyed But do not suppose  London  to be the source of these evils for had our excursion been any where else so disagreeable an addition to our houshold must have caused the same change at our return  I was sure you would be displeased with Sir Clement and therefore I am by no means surprised at what you say of him but for lord OrvilleI must own I had greatly feared that my weak and imperfect account would not have procured him the good opinion which he so well deserves and which I am delighted to find you seem to have of him O Sir could I have done justice to the merit of which I believe him possessedcould I have painted him to  you  such as he appeared to  me  then indeed you would have had some idea of the claim which he has to your approbation  After the last letter which I wrote in town nothing more passed previous to our journey hither except a very violent quarrel between Captain Mirvan and Madame Duval As the Captain intended to travel on horseback he had settled that we four females should make use of his coach Madame Duval did not come to Queen Annstreet till the carriage had waited some time at the door and then attended by Monsieur Du Bois she made her appearance  The Captain impatient to be gone would not suffer them to enter the house but insisted that we should immediately get into the coach We obeyed but were no sooner seated than Madame Duval said  "Come Monsieur Du Bois these  girls can make very good room for you sit closer children"  Mrs Mirvan looked quite confounded and M Du Bois after making some apologies about crowding us actually got into the coach on the side with Miss Mirvan and me But no sooner was he seated than the Captain who had observed this transaction very quietly walked up to the coachdoor saying  "What neither with your leave nor by your leave"  M Du Bois seemed rather shocked and began to make abundance of excuses but the Captain neither understood nor regarded him and very roughly said  "Look'ee Monsieur this here may be a French fashion for aught I knowbut Give and Take is fair in all nations and so now d'ye see I'll make bold to shew you an English one"  And then seizing his wrist he made him jump out of the coach  M Du Bois instantly put his hand upon his sword and threatened to resent this indignity The Captain holding up his stick bid him draw at his peril Mrs Mirvan greatly alarmed got out of the coach and standing between them entreated her husband to reenter the house  "None of your clack"  cried he angirly  "what the Dl do you suppose I can't manage a Frenchman"  Mean time Madame Duval called out to M Du Bois  "  Eh laissezle mon ami ne le corriger pas c' est un vilain b√™te qui ne vaut pas la peine  "  "  Monsieur le Capitaine  "  cried M Du Bois  "  voulezvous bien me demander pardon  "  "O ho you demand pardon do you"  said the Captain  "I thought as much I thought you'd come toso you have lost your relish for  an English salutation have you"  strutting up to him with looks of defiance  A crowd was now gathering and Mrs Mirvan again besought her husband to go into the house  "Why what a plague is the woman afraid ofdid you ever know a Frenchman that could not take an affrontI warrant Monsieur knows what he is aboutdon't you Monsieur"  M Du Bois not understanding him only said  "  plaitil Monsieur  "No nor  dish  me neither"  answered the Captain  "but be that as it may what signifies our parleying here if you've any thing to propose speak at once if not why let us go on our journey without more ado"  "  Parbleu je n'entends rien moi  "  cried M Du Bois shrugging his shoulders and looking very dismal  Mrs Mirvan then advanced to him and faid in French that she was sure the Captain had not any intention to affront him and begged he would desist from a dispute which could only be productive of mutual misunderstanding as neither of them knew the language of the other  This sensible remonstrance had the desired effect and M Du Bois making a bow to every one except the Captain very wisely gave up the point and took leave  We then hoped to proceed quietly on our journey but the turbulent Captain would not yet permit us he approached Madame Duval with an exulting air and said  "Why how's this Madam what has your champion deserted you why I thought you told me that you old gentlewomen had it all your own way among them French sparks"  "As to that Sir"  answered she  "it's not of no consequence what you thought for a person  who can behave in such a low way may think what he pleases for me for I sha'n't mind"  "Why then Mistress since you must needs make so free"  cried he  "please to tell me the reason why you took the liberty for to ask any of your followers into my coach without my leave Answer me to that"  "Why then pray Sir"  returned she  "tell me the reason why you took the liberty to treat the gentleman in such a impolite way as to take and pull him neck and heels out I'm sure he had n't done nothing to affront you nor nobody else and I don't know what great hurt he would have done you by just sitting still in the coach he would not have eat it"  "What do you think then that my horses have nothing to do but to carry about your snivelling Frenchmen If you do Madam I must make bold to tell you you are out for I'll see 'em hanged first"  "More brute you then for they've never carried nobody half so good"  Why look'ee Madam if you must needs provoke me I'll tell you a piece of my mind you must know I can see as far into a millstone as another man and so if you thought for to fob me off with one of your smirking French puppies for a soninlaw why you'll find yourself in a hobblethat's all"  "Sir you're abut I won't say whatbut I protest I had n't no such a thought no more had n't Monsieur Du Bois"  "My dear"  said Mrs Mirvan  "we shall be very late"  "Well well"  answered he  get away then off with you as fast as you can it's high time As to Molly she's fine lady enough in all conscience  I want none of your French chaps to make her worse"  And so saying he mounted his horse and we drove off And I could not but think with regret of the different feelings we experienced upon leaving London to what had belonged to our entering it  During the journey Madame Duval was so very violent against the Captain that she obliged Mrs Mirvan to tell her that when in her presence she must beg her to chuse some other subject of discourse  We had a most affectionate reception from Lady Howard whose kindness and hospitality cannot fail of making every body happy who is disposed so to be  Adieu my dearest Sir I hope though I have hitherto neglected to mention it that you have always remembered me to whoever has made any enquiry concerning me  LETTER XXVI  Evelina to the Rev Mr Villars  Howard Grove  April  O MY dear Sir I now write in the greatest uneasiness Madame Duval has made a proposal which terrifies me to death and which was as unexpected as it is shocking  She had been employed for some hoursthis afternoon in reading letters from London and just about teatime she sent for me into her room and said with a look of great satisfaction  "Come  here child I've got some very good news to tell you something that will surprise you I'll give you my word for you ha'n't no notion of it"  I begged her to explain herself and then in terms which I cannot repeat she said she had been considering what a shame it was to see me such a poor country shamefaced thing when I ought to be a fine lady and that she had long and upon several occasions blushed for me though she must own the fault was none of mine for nothing better could be expected from a girl who had been so immured However she assured me she had at length hit upon a plan which would make quite another creature of me  I waited without much impatience to hear what this preface led to but I was soon awakened to more lively sensations when she acquainted me that her intention was to prove my birthright and to claim by law the inheritance of my real family  It would be impossible for me to express my extreme consternation when she thus unfolded her scheme My surprise and terror were equally great I could say nothing I heard her with a silence which I had not the power to break  She then expatiated very warmly upon the advantages I should reap from her plan talked in a high style of my future grandeur assured me how heartily I should despise almost every body and every thing I had hitherto seen predicted my marrying into some family of the first rank in the kingdom and finally said I should spend a few months in Paris where my education and manners might receive their last polish  She enlarged also upon the delight she should have in common with myself from mortifying the  pride of certain people and shewing them that she was not to be slighted with impunity  In the midst of this discourse I was relieved by a summons to tea Madame Duval was in great spirits but my emotion was too painful for concealment and every body enquired into the cause I would fain have waved the subject but Madame Duval was determined to make it public She told them that she had it in her head to  make something  of me and that they should soon call me by another name than that of Anville and yet that she was not going to have the child married neither  I could not endure to hear her proceed and was going to leave the room which when Lady Howard perceived she begged Madame Duval would defer her intelligence to some other opportunity but she was so eager to communicate her scheme that she could bear no delay and therefore they suffered me to go without opposition Indeed whenever my situation or affairs are mentioned by Madame Duval she speaks of them with such bluntness and severity that I cannot be enjoined a task more cruel than to hear her  I was afterwards acquainted with some particulars of the conversation by Miss Mirvan who told me that Madame Duval informed them of her plan with the utmost complacency and seemed to think herself very fortunate in having suggested it but soon after she accidentally betrayed that she had been instigated to the scheme by her relations the Branghtons whose letters which she received today first mentioned the proposal She declared that she would have nothing to do with any  roundabout ways  but go openly and instantly to law in order to prove my birth real name and title to the estate of my ancestors  How impertinent and officious in these Branghtons to interfere thus in my concerns You can hardly imagine what a disturbance this plan has made in the family The Captain without enquiring into any particulars of the affair has peremptorily declared himself against it merely because it has been proposed by Madame Duval and they have battled the point together with great violence Mrs Mirvan says she will not even  think  till she hears your opinion But Lady Howard to my great surprise openly avows her approbation of Madame Duval's intention however she will write her reasons and sentiments upon the subject to you herself  As to Miss Mirvan she is my second self and neither hopes nor fears but as I do And as to  me  I know not what to say nor even what to wish I have often thought my fate peculiarly cruel to have but one parent and from that one to be banished for everwhile on the other side I have but too well known and felt the propriety of the separation And yet you may much better imagine than I can express the internal anguish which sometimes oppresses my heart when I reflect upon the strange indifferency that must occasion a father never to make the least enquiry after the health the welfare or even the life of his child  O Sir to  me  the loss is nothinggreatly sweetly and most benevolently have you guarded me from seeling itbut for  him  I grieve indeedI must be divested not merely of a filial piety but of all humanity could I ever think upon this subject and not be wounded to the soul  Again I must repeat I know not what to  wish  think for me therefore my dearest Sir and suffer  my doubting mind that knows not which way to direct its hopes to be guided by your wisdom and unerring counsel  EVELINA  LETTER XXVII  Lady Howard to the Rev Mr Villars  Howard Grove  Dear Sir  I Cannot give a greater proof of the high opinion I have of your candour than by the liberty I am now going to take of presuming to offer you advice upon a subject concerning which you have so just a claim to act for yourself but I know you have too unaffected a love of justice to be partially tenacious of your own judgment  Madame Duval has been proposing a scheme which has put us all in commotion and against which at first in common with the rest of my family I exclaimed but upon more mature consideration I own my objections have almost wholly vanished  This scheme is no other than to commence a lawsuit with Sir John Belmont to prove the validity of his marriage with Miss Evelyn the necessary consequence of which proof will be securing his fortune and estate to his daughter  And why my dear Sir should not this be I know that upon first hearing this plan conveys ideas that must shock you but I know too that your mind is superior to being governed by prejudices  or to opposing any important cause on account of a few disagreeable attendant circumstances  Your lovely charge now first entering into life has merit which ought not to be buried in obscurity She seems born for an ornament to the world Nature has been bountiful to her of whatever she had to bestow and the peculiar attention you have given to her education has formed her mind to a degree of excellence that in one so young I have scarce ever seen equalled Fortune alone has hitherto been sparing of her gifts and she too now opens the way which leads to all that is left to wish for her  What your reasons may have been my good Sir for so carefully concealing the birth name and pretensions of this amiable girl and forbearing to make any claim upon Sir John Belmont I am totally a stranger to but without knowing I respect them from the high opinion I have of your character and judgment but I hope they are not insuperable for I cannot but think that it was never designed for one who seems meant to grace the world to have her life devoted to retirement  Surely Sir John Belmont wretch as he has shewn himself could never see his accomplished daughter and not be proud to own her and eager to secure her the inheritance of his fortune The admiration she met with in town though merely the effect of her external attractions was such that Mrs Mirvan assures me she would have had the most splendid offers had there not seemed to be some mystery in regard to her birth which she was well informed was assiduously though vainly endeavoured to be discovered  Can it be right my dear Sir that this promising young creature should be deprived of the fortune and rank of life to which she is lawfully entitled and which you have prepared her to support and to use her so noblyTo despise riches may indeed be philosophic but to dispense them worthily must surely be more beneficial to mankind  Perhaps a few years or indeed a much shorter time may make this scheme impracticable Sir John though yet young leads a life too dissipated for long duration and when too late we may regret that something was not sooner done for it will be next to impossible after he is gone to settle or prove any thing with his heirs and executors  Pardon the earnestness with which I write my sense of this affair but your charming ward has made me so warmly her friend that I cannot be indifferent upon a subject of such importance to her future life  Adieu my dear Sirsend me speedily an answer to this remonstrance and believe me to be c  M HOWARD  LETTER XXVIII  Mr Villars to Lady Howard  Berry Hill  May  YOUR letter Madam has opened a source of anxiety to which I look forward with dread and which to see closed I scarcely dare expect I am  unwilling to oppose my opinion to that of your Ladyship nor indeed can I but by arguments which I believe will rather rank me as a hermit ignorant of the world and fit only for my cell than as a proper guardian in an age such as this for an accomplished young woman Yet thus called upon it behoves me to explain and endeavour to vindicate the reasons by which I have been hitherto guided  The mother of this dear childwho was led to destruction by her own imprudence the hardness of heart of Madame Duval and the villainy of Sir John Belmontwas once what her daughter is now the best beloved of my heart and her memory so long as my own holds I shall love mourn and honour On the fatal day that her gentle foul left its mansion and not many hours ere she ceased to breathe I solemnly plighted my faith  That her child if it lived should know no father but myself or her acknowledged husband  You cannot Madam suppose that I found much difficulty in adhering to this promise and forbearing to make any  claim  upon Sir John Belmont Could I feel an affection the most paternal for this poor sufferer and not abominate her destroyer Could I wish to deliver to  him  who had so basely betrayed the mother the helpless and innocent offspring who born in so much sorrow seemed entitled to all the compassionate tenderness of pity  For many years the  name  alone of that man accidentally spoken in my hearing almost divested me of my christianity and scarce could I forbear to execrate him Yet I sought not neither did I desire to deprive him of his child had he with any appearance of contrition or indeed of humanity  endeavoured to become less unworthy such a blessing but he is a stranger to all parental feelings and has with a savage insensibility forborne to enquire even into the existence of this sweet orphan though the situation of his injured wife was but too well known to him  You wish to be acquainted with my intentionsI must acknowledge they were such as I now perceive would not be honoured with your Ladyship's approbation for though I have sometimes thought of presenting Evelina to her father and demanding the justice which is her due yet at other times I have both disdained and feared the application disdained lest it should be refused and feared lest it should be accepted  Lady Belmont who was firmly persuaded of her approaching dissolution frequently and earnestly besought me that if her infant was a female I would not abandon her to the direction of a man so wholly unfit to take the charge of her education but should she be importunately demanded that I would retire with her abroad and carefully conceal her from Sir John till some apparent change in his sentiments and conduct should announce him less improper for such a trust And often would she say  "Should the poor babe have any feelings correspondent with its mother's it will have no want while under your protection"  Alas she had no sooner quitted it herself than she was plunged into a gulph of misery that swallowed up her peace reputation and life  During the childhood of Evelina I suggested a thousand plans for the security of her birthrightbut I as oftentimes rejected them I was in a perpetual conflict between the desire that she should have justice done her and the apprehension  that while I improved her fortune I should endanger her mind However as her character began to be formed and her disposition to be displayed my perplexity abated the road before me seemed less thorny and intricate and I thought I could perceive the right path from the wrong for when I observed the artless openness the ingenuous simplicity of her nature when I saw that her guileless and innocent soul fancied all the world to be pure and disinterested as herself and that her heart was open to every impression with which love pity or art might assail itthen did I flatter myself that to follow my own inclination and to secure her welfare was the same thing since to expose her to the snares and dangers inevitably encircling a house of which the master is dissipated and unprincipled without the guidance of a mother or any prudent and sensible female seemed to me no less than suffering her to stumble into some dreadful pit when the sun was in its meridian My plan therefore was not merely to educate and to cherish her as my own but to adopt her the heiress of my small fortune and to bestow her upon some worthy man with whom she might spend her days in tranquillity chearfulness and good humour untainted by vice folly or ambition  So much for the time past Such have been the motives by which I have been governed and I hope they will be allowed not merely to account for but also to justify the conduct which has resulted from them It now remains to speak of the time to come  And here indeed I am sensible of difficulties which I almost despair of surmounting according to my wishes I pay the highest deference to your  Ladyship's opinion which it is extremely painful to me not to concur with yet I am so well acquainted with your goodness that I presume to hope it would not be absolutely impossible for me to offer such arguments as might lead you to think with me that this young creature's chance of happiness seems less doubtful in retirement than it would be in the gay and dissipated world but why should I perplex your Ladyship with reasoning that can turn to so little account for alas what arguments what persuasions can I make use of with any prospect of success to such a woman as Madame Duval Her character and the violence of her disposition intimidate me from making the attempt she is too ignorant for instruction too obstinate for entreaty and too weak for reason  I will not therefore enter into a contest from which I have nothing to expect but altercation and impertinence As soon would I discuss the effect of sound with the deaf or the nature of colours with the blind as aim at illuminating with conviction a mind so warped by prejudice so much the slave of unruly and illiberal passions Unused as she is to controul persuasion would but harden and opposition incense her I yield therefore to the necessity which compels my reluctant acquiescence and shall now turn all my thoughts upon considering of such methods for the conducting this enterprize as may be most conducive to the happiness of my child and least liable to wound her sensibility  The lawsuit therefore I wholly and absolutely disapprove  Will you my dear Madam forgive the freedom of an old man if I own myself greatly surprised that you could even for a moment listen  to a plan so violent so public so totally repugnant to all female delicacy I am satisfied your Ladyship has not weighed this project There was a time indeed when to assert the innocence of Lady Belmont and to blazon to the world the  wrongs  not  guilt  by which she suffered I proposed nay attempted a similar plan but then all assistance and encouragement was denied How cruel to the remembrance I bear of her woes is this tardy resentment of Madame Duval She was deaf to the voice of Nature though she has hearkened to that of Ambition  Never can I consent to have this dear and timid girl brought forward to the notice of the world by such a method a method which will subject her to all the impertinence of curiosity the sneers of conjecture and the stings of ridicule And for whatthe attainment of wealth which she does not want and the gratification of vanity which she does not seelA child to appear against a fatherno Madam old and infirm as I am I would even yet sooner convey her myself to some remote part of the world though I were sure of dying in the expedition  Far different had been the motives which would have stimulated her unhappy mother to such a proceeding all her felicity in this world was irretrievably lost her life was become a burthen to her and her fair fame which she had early been taught to prize above all other things had received a mortal wound therefore to clear her own honour and to secure from blemish the birth of her child was all the good which Fortune had reserved herself the  power  of bestowing But even this last consolation was withheld from her  Let milder measures be adopted andsince it must be solet application be made to Sir John Belmont but as to a lawsuit I hope upon this subject never more to hear it mentioned  With Madame Duval all pleas of delicacy would be ineffectual her scheme must be opposed by arguments better suited to her understanding I will not therefore talk of its impropriety but endeavour to prove its inutility Have the goodness then to tell her that her own intentions would be frustrated by her plan since should the lawsuit be commenced and even should the cause be gained Sir John Belmont would still have it in his power and if irritated no doubt in his inclination to cut off her granddaughter with a shilling  She cannot do better herself than to remain quiet and inactive in the affair the long and mutual animosity between her and Sir John will make her interference merely productive of debates and illwill Neither would I have Evelina appear till summoned And as to myself I must wholly decline  acting  though I will with unwearied zeal devote all my thoughts to giving counsel but in truth I have neither inclination nor spirits adequate to engaging personally with this man  My opinion is that he would pay more respect to a letter from your Ladyship upon this subject than from any other person I therefore advise and hope that you will yourself take the trouble of writing to him in order to open the affair When he shall be inclined to see Evelina I have for him a posthumous letter which his muchinjured lady left to be presented to him if ever such a meeting should take place  The views of the Branghtons in suggesting this scheme are obviously interested they hope by securing to Evelina the fortune of her father to induce Madame Duval to settle her own upon themselves In this however they would probably be mistaken for little minds have ever a propensity to bestow their wealth upon those who are already in affluence and therefore the less her grandchild requires her assistance the more gladly she will give it  I have but one thing more to add from which however I can by no means recede my word so solemnly given to Lady Belmont that her child should never be owned but with herself must be inviolably adhered to  I am dear Madam with great respect Your Ladyship's most obedient servant ARTHUR VILLARS  LETTER XXIX  Mr Villars to Evelina  Berry Hill  May  HOW sincerely do I sympathise in the uneasiness and concern which my beloved Evelina has so much reason to feel The cruel scheme in agitation is equally repugnant to my judgment and my inclinationyet to oppose it seems impracticable To follow the dictates of my own heart I should instantly recal you to myself and never more consent to your being separated from me but the manners and opinion of the world demand a different conduct Hope however for the best  and be satisfied you shall meet with no indignity if you are not received into your own family as you ought to be and with the distinction that is your due you shall leave it for ever and once again restored to my protection secure your own tranquillity and make as you have hitherto done all the happiness of my life  LETTER XXX  Evelina to the Rev Mr Villars  Howard Grove  May  THE die is thrown and I attend the event in trembling Lady Howard has written to Paris and sent her letter to town to be forwarded in the ambassador's packet and in less than a fortnight therefore she expects an answer O Si  with what anxious impatience shall I await its arrival upon it seems to depend the fate of my future life My solicitude is so great and my suspense so painful that I cannot rest a moment in peace or turn my thoughts into any other channel  Deeply interested as I now am in the event most sincerely do I regret that the plan was ever proposed methinks it  cannot  end to my satisfaction for either I must be torn from the arms of my  more  than fatheror I must have the misery of being finally convinced that I am cruelly rejected by him who has the natural claim to that dear title a title which to write mention or think of fills my whole soul with filial tenderness  The subject is discussed here eternally Captain Mirvan and Madame Duval as usual quarrel whenever  it is started but I am so wholly engrossed by my own reflections that I cannot even listen to them My imagination changes the scene perpetually at one moment I am embraced by a kind and relenting parent who takes me to that heart from which I have hitherto been benished and supplicates through me peace and forgiveness from the ashes of my motherat another he regards me with detestation considers me as the living image of an injured saint and repulses me with horrorBut I will not afflict you with the melancholy phantasms of my brain I will endeavour to compose my mind to a more tranquil state and forbear to write again till I have in some measure succeeded  May Heaven bless you my dearest Sir and long long may it continue you on earth to bless  Your grateful EVELINA  LETTER XXXI  Lady Howard to Sir John Belmont Bart  HowardGrove  May  SIR  YOU will doubtless be surprised at receiving a letter from one who had for so short a period the honour of your acquaintance and that at so great a distance of time but the motive which has induced me to take this liberty is of so delicate a nature that were I to commence making apologies  for my officiousness I fear my letter would be too long for your patience  You have probably already conjectured the subject upon which I mean to treat My regard for Mr Evelyn and his amiable daughter was well known to you nor can I ever cease to be interested in whatever belongs to their memory or family  I must own myself somewhat distressed in what manner to introduce the purport of my writing yet as I think that in affairs of this kind frankness is the first requisite to a good understanding between the parties concerned I will neither torment you nor myself with punctilious ceremonies but proceed instantly and openly to the business which occasions my giving you this trouble  I presume Sir it would be superfluous to tell you that your child resides still in Dorsetshire and is still under the protection of the Reverend Mr Villars in whose house she was born for though no enquiries concerning her have reached his ears or mine I can never suppose it possible you have forborne to make them It only remains therefore to tell you that your daughter is now grown up that she has been educated with the utmost care and the utmost success and that she is now a most deserving accomplished and amiable young woman  Whatever may be your view for her future destination in life it seems time to declare it She is greatly admired and I doubt not will be very much sought after it is proper therefore that her future expectations and your pleasure concerning her should be made known  Believe me Sir she merits your utmost attention and regard You could not see and know her and remain unmoved by those sensations of affection  which belong to so near and tender a relationship She is the lovely resemblance of her lovely motherpardon me Sir that I mention that unfortunate lady but I think it behoves me upon this occasion to shew the esteem I felt for her allow me therefore to say and be not offended at my freedom that the memory of that excellent lady has but too long remained under the aspersions of calumny surely it is time to vindicate her fameand how can that be done in a manner more eligible more grateful to her friends or more honourable to yourself than by openly receiving as your child  the daughter of the late Lady Belmont  The venerable man who has had the care of her education deserves your warmest acknowledgments for the unremitting pains he has taken and attention he has shewn in the discharge of his trust Indeed she has been peculiarly fortunate in meeting with such a friend and guardian a more worthy man or one whose character seems nearer to perfection does not exist  Permit me to assure you Sir she will amply repay whatever regard and favour you may hereafter shew her by the comfort and happiness you cannot fail to find in her affection and duty To be owned  properly  by you is the first wish of her heart and I am sure that to merit your approbation will be the first study of her life  I fear that you will think this address impertinent but I must rest upon the goodness of my intention to plead my excuse  I am Sir Your most obedient humble servant M HOWARD  LETTER XXXII  Evelina to the Rev Mr Villars  Howard Grove  May  OUR house has been enlivened today by the arrival of a London visitor and the necessity I have been under of concealing the uneasiness of my mind has made me exert myself so effectually that I even think it is really diminished or at least my thoughts are not so totally so very anxiously occupied by one only subject as they lately were  I was strolling this morning with Miss Mirvan down a lane about a mile from the grove when we heard the trampling of horses and fearing the narrowness of the passage we were turning hastily back but stopped upon hearing a voice call out  "Pray Ladies don't be frightened for I will walk my horse"  We turned again and then saw Sir Clement Willoughby He dismounted and approaching us with the reins in his hand presently recollected us  "Good Heaven"  cried he with his usual quickness  "do I see Miss Anvilleand you too Miss Mirvan"  He immediately ordered his servant to take charge of his horse and then advancing to us took a hand of each which he pressed to his lips and said a thousand fine things concerning his good fortune our improved looks and the charms of the country when inhabited by  such  rural deities  "The town Ladies has languished since your absenceor at least I have so much languished myself as to be absolutely  insensible to all it had to offer One refreshing breeze such as I now enjoy awakens me to new vigour life and spirit But I never before had the good luck to see the country in such perfection"  "Has not almost every body left town Sir"  said Miss Mirvan  "I am ashamed to answer you Madambut indeed it is as full as ever and will continue so till after the birthday However you ladies were so little seen that there were but few who know what it has lost For my own part I felt it too sensibly to be able to endure the place any longer"  "Is there any body remaining there that we were acquainted with"  cried I  "O yes Ma'am"  And then he named two or three persons we had seen when with him but he did not mention Lord Orville and I would not ask him lest he should think me curious Perhaps if he stays here some time he may speak of him by accident  He was proceeding in this complimentary style when we were met by the Captain who no sooner perceived Sir Clement than he hastened up to him gave him a hearty shake of the hand a cordial slap on the back and some other equally gentle tokens of satisfaction assuring him of his great joy at his visit and declaring he was as glad to see him as if he had been a messenger who brought news that a French ship was sunk Sir Clement on the other side expressed himself with equal warmth and protested he had been so eager to pay his respects to Captain Mirvan that he had left London in its full lustre and a thousand engagements  unanswered merely to give himself that pleasure  "We shall have rare sport"  said the Captain  "for do you know the old Frenchwoman is among us 'Fore George I have scarce made any use of her yet by reason I have had nobody with me that could enjoy a joke howsomever it shall go hard but we'll have some diversion now"  Sir Clement very much approved of the proposal and we then went into the house where he had a very grave reception from Mrs Mirvan who is by no means pleased with his visit and a look of much discontent from Madame Duval who said to me in a low voice  "I'd as soon have seen Old Nick as that man for he's the most impertinentest person in the world and is n't never of my side"  The Captain is now actually occupied in contriving some scheme which he says is  to play the old Dowager off  and so eager and delighted is he at the idea that he can scarcely constrain his raptures sufficiently to conceal his design even from herself I wish however since I do not dare put Madame Duval upon her guard that he had the delicacy not to acquaint me with his intention  LETTER XXXIII  Evelina in continuation  May th  THE Captain's operations are begunand I hope ended for indeed poor Madame Duval has already but too much reason to regret Sir Clement's visit to Howard Grove  Yesterday morning during breakfast as the Captain was reading the newspaper Sir Clement suddenly begged to look at it saying he wanted to know if there was any account of a transaction at which he had been present the evening before his journey thither concerning a poor Frenchman who had got into a scrape which might cost him his life  The Captain demanded particulars and then Sir Clement told him a long story of being with a party of country friends at the Tower and hearing a man call out for mercy in French and that when he enquired into the occasion of his distress he was informed that he had been taken up upon suspicion of treasonable practices against the government  "The poor fellow"  continued he  "no sooner found that I spoke French than he besought me to hear him protesting that he had no evil designs that he had been but a short time in England and only waited the return of a Lady from the country to quit it for ever"  Madame Duval changed colour and listened with the utmost attention  "Now though I by no means approve of so many foreigners continually flocking into our country"  added he addressing himself to the Captain  "yet I could not help pitying the poor wretch because he did not know enough of English to make his defence however I found it impossible to assist him for the mob would not suffer me to interfere In truth I am afraid he was but roughly handled"  "Why did they duck him"  said the Captain  "Something of that sort"  answered he  "So much the better so much the better"  cried the Captain  "an impudent French puppyI'll bet you what you will he was a rascal I only wish all his countrymen were served the same"  "I wish you had been in his place with all my soul"  cried Madame Duval warmly  "but pray Sir did n't nobody know who this poor gentleman was"  "Why I did hear his name spoke"  answered Sir Clement  "but I cannot recollect it"  "It was n'tit was n'tDu Bois"  stammered out Madame Duval  "The very name"  answered he  "yes Du Bois I remember it now"  Madame Duval's cup fell from her hand as she repeated  "Du Bois Monsieur Du Bois did you say"  "Du Bois why that's  my  friend  cried the Captain  "that's  Monsieur Slippery  i'n't itWhy he's plaguy fond of sousing work howsomever I'll be sworn they gave him his fill of it"  "And I'll be sworn"  cried Madame Duval  "that you're abut I don't believe nothing about it so you need n't be so overjoyed for I dare say it was no more Monsieur Du Bois than I am"  "I thought at the time"  said Sir Clement very gravely  "that I had seen the gentleman before and now I recollect I think it was in company with you Madam"  "With  me  Sir"  cried Madame Duval  "Say you so"  said the Captain  "why then it must be he as sure as you're aliveWell but my good friend what will they do with poor Monsieur"  "It is difficult to say"  answered Sir Clement very thoughtfully  "but I should suppose that if he has not good friends to appear for him he will be in a very unpleasant situation for these are serious sort of affairs'  "Why do you think they'll hang him"  demanded the Captain  Sir Clement shook his head but made no answer  Madame Duval could no longer contain her agitation she started from her chair repeating with a voice half choaked  "Hang himthey can'tthey sha'n'tlet them at their perilhowever 'tis all false and I won't believe a word of itbut I'll go to town this very moment and see M Du Bois myselfI won't wait for nothing"  Mrs Mirvan begged her not to be alarmed but she flew out of the room and up stairs into her own apartment Lady Howard blamed both the gentlemen for having been so abrupt and followed her I would have accompanied her but the Captain stopped me and having first laughed very heartily said he was going to read his commission to his ship's company  "Now do you see"  said he  "as to Lady Howard I sha'n't pretend for to enlist her into  my service and so I shall e'en leave her to make it out as well as she can but as to all you I expect obedience and submission to orders I am now upon a hazardous expedition having undertaken to convoy a crazy vessel to the shore of Mortification so d'ye see if any of you have any thing to propose that will forward the enterprizewhy speak and welcome but if any of you that are of my chosen crew capitulate or enter into any treaty with the enemyI shall look upon you as mutinying and turn you adrift"  Having finished this harangue which was interlarded with many expressions and seaphrases that I cannot recollect he gave Sir Clement a wink of intelligence and left us to ourselves  Indeed notwithstanding the attempts I so frequently make of writing some of the Captain's conversation I can only give you a faint idea of his language for almost every other word he utters is accompanied by an oath which I am sure would be as unpleasant for you to read as for me to write And besides he makes use of a thousand seaterms which are to me quite unintelligible  Poor Madame Duval sent to enquire at all probable places whether she could be conveyed to town in any stagecoach but the Captain's servant brought her for answer that no London stage would pass near Howard Grove till today She then sent to order a chaise but was soon assured that no horses could be procured She was so much inflamed by these disappointments that she threatened to set out for town on foot and it was with difficulty that Lady Howard dissuaded her from this mad scheme  The whole morning was filled up with these enquiries But when we were all assembled to dinner she endeavoured to appear perfectly unconcerned and repeatedly protested that she gave not any credit to the report as far as it regarded M Du Bois being very certain that he was not the person in question  The Captain used the most provoking efforts to convince her that she deceived herself while Sir Clement with more art though not less malice affected to be of her opinion but at the same time that he pretended to relieve her uneasiness by saying that he doubted not having mistaken the name he took care to enlarge upon the danger to which the  unknown gentleman  was exposed and expressed great concern at his perilous situation  Dinner was hardly removed when a letter was delivered to Madame Duval The moment she had read it she hastily demanded from whom it came  "A country boy brought it"  answered the servant  "but he would not wait"  "Run after him this instant"  cried she  "and be sure you bring him back  Mon Dieu quel avanture que feraije  "  "What's the matter what's the matter"  said the Captain  "Why nothingnothing's the matter  O mon Dieu  "  And she rose and walked about the room  "Why whathas Monsieur sent to you"  continued the Captain  "is that there letter from him  "Noit i'n'tbesides if it is it's nothing to you"  "O then I'm sure it is Pray now Madame don't be so close come tell us all about itwhat does he say how did he relish the horsepondwhich did he find best sousing  single  or  double  'Fore George 'twas plaguy unlucky you was not with him"  "It's no such a thing Sir"  cried she very angrily  "and if you're so very fond of a horsepond I wish you'd put yourself into one and not be always a thinking about other people's being served so"  The man then came in to acquaint her they could not overtake the boy She scolded violently and was in such perturbation that Lady Howard interfered and begged to know the cause of her uneasiness and whether she could assist her  Madame Duval cast her eyes upon the Captain and Sir Clement and said she should be glad to speak to her Ladyship without so many witnesses  "Well then Miss Anville"  said the Captain turning to me  "do you and Molly go into another room and stay there till Mrs Duval has opened her mind to us"  "So you may think Sir"  cried she  "but who's fool then no no you need n't trouble yourself to make a ninny of me neither for I'm not so easily taken in I'll assure you"  Lady Howard then invited her into the dressingroom and I was desired to attend her  As soon as we had shut the door  "O my Lady"  exclaimed Madame Duval  "here's the most cruellest thing in the world has happenedbut that Captain is such a beast I can't say nothing before himbut it's all true poor M Du Bois is tooked up"  Lady Howard begged her to be comforted saying that as M Du Bois was certainly innocent there could be no doubt of his ability to clear himself  "To be sure my Lady"  answered she  "I know he is innocent and to be sure they'll never be so wicked as to hang him for nothing"  "Certainly not"  replied Lady Howad  "you have no reason to be uneasy This is not a country where punishment is inflicted without proof"  "Very true my Lady but the worst thing is this I cannot bear that that fellow the Captain should know about it for if he does I sha'n't never hear the last of itno more won't poor M Du Bois"  "Well well"  said Lady Howard  "shew me the letter and I will endeavour to advise you"  The letter was then produced It was signed by the clerk of a country justice who acquainted her that a prisoner then upon trial for suspicion of treasonable practices against the government was just upon the point of being committed to jail but having declared that he was known to her this clerk had been prevailed upon to write in order to enquire if she really could speak to the character and family of a Frenchman who called himself Pierre Du Bois  When I heard the letter I was quite amazed at its success So improbable did it seem that a foreigner should be taken before a  country  justice of peace for a crime of so dangerous a nature that I cannot imagine how Madame Duval could be alarmed even for a moment But with all her violence of temper I see that she is easily frightened and in fact more cowardly than many who  have not half her spirit and so little does she reflect upon circumstances or probability that she is continually the dupe of her ownI ought not to say  ignorance  but yet I can think of no other word  I believe that Lady Howard from the beginning of the transaction suspected some contrivance of the Captain and this letter I am sure must confirm her suspicion however though she is not at all pleased with his frolick yet she would not hazard the consequence of discovering his designs her looks her manner and her character made me draw this conclusion from her apparent perplexity for not a word did she say that implied any doubt of the authenticity of the letter Indeed there seems to be a sort of tacit agreement between her and the Captain that she should not appear to be acquainted with his schemes by which means she at once avoids quarrels and supports her dignity  While she was considering what to propose Madame Duval begged to have the use of her Ladyship's chariot that she might go immediately to the assistance of her friend Lady Howard politely assured her that it would be extremely at her service and then Madame Duval besought her not to own to the Captain what had happened protesting that she could not endure he should know that poor M Du Bois had met with so unfortunate an accident Lady Howard could not help smiling though she readily promised not to  inform  the Captain of the affair As to me she desired my attendance which I was by no means rejoiced at as I was certain she was going upon a fruitless errand  I was then commissioned to order the chariot  At the foot of the stairs I met the captain who was most impatiently waiting the result of the conference In an instant we were joined by Sir Clement A thousand enquiries were then made concerning Madame Duval's opinion of the letter and her intentions upon it and when I would have left them Sir Clement pretending equal eagerness with the Captain caught my hand and repeatedly detained me to ask some frivolous question to the answer of which he must be totally indifferent At length however I broke from them they retired into the parlour and I executed my commission  The carriage was soon ready and Madame Duval having begged Lady Howard to say she was not well stole softly down stairs desiring me to follow her The chariot was ordered at the garden door and when we were seated she told the man according to the clerk's directions to drive to Mr Justice Tyrell's asking at the same time how many miles off he lived  I expected he would have answered that he knew of no such person but to my great surprize he said  "Why 'Squire Tyrell lives about nine miles beyond the park"  "Drive fast then"  cried she  "and you sha'n't be no worse for it"  During our ride which was extremely tedious she tormented herself with a thousand fears for M Du Bois' safety and piqued herself very much upon having escaped unseen by the Captain not only that she avoided his triumph but because she knew him to be so much M Du Bois' enemy that she was sure he would prejudice the Justice against him and endeavour to take away his life For  my part I was quite ashamed of being engaged in so ridiculous an affair and could only think of the absurd appearance we should make upon our arrival at Mr Tyrell's  When we had been out near two hours and expected every moment to stop at the place of our destination I observed that Lady Howard's servant who attended us on horseback rode on forward till he was out of sight and soon after returning came up to the chariotwindow and delivering a note to Madame Duval said he had met a boy who was just coming with it to Howard Grove from the clerk of Mr Tyrell  While she was reading it he rode round to the other window and making a sign for secrecy put into my hand a slip of paper on which was written  "Whatever happens be not alarmedfor  you  are safethough you endanger all mankind"  I readily imagined that Sir Clement must be the author of this note which prepared me to expect some disagreeable adventure but I had no time to ponder upon it for Madame Duval had no sooner read her own letter than in an angry tone of voice she exclaimed  "Why now what a thing is this here we're come all this way for nothing"  She then gave me the note which informed her that she need not trouble herself to go to Mr Tyrell's as the prisoner had had the address to escape I congratulated her upon this fortunate incident but she was so much concerned at having rode so far in vain that she seemed less pleased than provoked However she ordered the man to make what haste he could home as she hoped  at least to return before the Captain should suspect what had passed  The carriage turned about and we journeyed so quietly for near an hour that I began to flatter myself we should be suffered to proceed to Howard Grove without further molestation when suddenly the footman called out  "John are we going right"  "Why I a'n't sure"  said the coachman  "but I'm afraid we turned wrong"  "What do you mean by that Sirrah"  said Madame Duval  "why if you lose your way we shall be all in the dark"  "I think we should turn to the left"  said the footman  "To the left"  answered the other  "No no I'm partly sure we should turn to the right"  "You had better make some enquiry"  said I  "  Ma foi  "  cried Madame Duval  "we're in a fine hole herethey neither of them know more than the post However I'll tell my Lady as sure as you're born so you'd better find the way"  "Let's try this lane"  said the footman  "No"  said the coachman  "that's the road to Canterbury we had best go straight on"  "Why that's the direct London road"  returned the footman  "and will lead us twenty miles about"  "  Pardie  "  cried Madame Duval  "why they won't go one way nor t'other and now we're come all this jaunt for nothing I suppose we sha'n't get home tonight"  "Let's go back to the publichouse"  said the footman  "and ask for a guide"  "No no"  said the other  "if we stay here a few minutes somebody or other will pass by and the horses are almost knocked up already"  "Well I protest"  cried Madame Duval  "I'd give a guinea to see them sots both horsewhipped As sure as I'm alive they're drunk Ten to one but they'll overturn us next"  After much debating they at length agreed to go on till we came to some inn or met with a passenger who could direct us We soon arrived at a small farmhouse and the footman alighted and went into it  In a few minutes he returned and told us we might proceed for that he had procured a direction  "But"  added he  "it seems there are some thieves hereabouts and so the best way will be for you to leave your watches and purses with the farmer who I know very well and who is an honest man and a tenant of my Lady's"  "Thieves"  cried Madame Duval looking aghast  "the Lord help usI've no doubt but we shall be all murdered"  The farmer came to us and we gave him all we were worth and the servants followed our example We then proceeded and Madame Duval's anger so entirely subsided that in the mildest manner imaginable she intreated them to make haste and promised to tell their Lady how diligent and obliging they had been She perpetually stopped them to ask if they apprehended any danger and was at length so much overpowered by her fears that she made the footman fasten his horse to the back of the carriage and then come and seat himself within it My endeavours to encourage her were fruitless she sat in the middle held the man by the arm and protested that if he did  but save her life she would make his fortune Her uneasiness gave me much concern and it was with the utmost difficulty I forbore to acquaint her that she was imposed upon but the mutual fear of the Captain's resentment to me and of her own to him neither of which would have any moderation deterred me As to the footman he was evidently in torture from restraining his laughter and I observed that he was frequently obliged to make horrid grimaces from pretended fear in order to conceal his risibility  Very soon after  "The robbers are coming"  cried the coachman  The footman opened the door and jumped out of the chariot  Madame Duval gave a loud scream  I could no longer preserve my silence  "For Heaven's sake my dear Madam"  said I  don't be alarmedyou are in no dangeryou are quite safe there is nothing but"  Here the chariot was stopped by two men in masks who at each side put in their hands as if for our purses Madame Duval sunk to the bottom of the chariot and implored their mercy I shrieked involuntarily although prepared for the attack one of them held me fast while the other tore poor Madame Duval out of the carriage in spite of her cries threats and resistance  I was really frightened and trembled exceedingly  "My angel"  cried the man who held me  "you cannot surely be alarmeddo you not know meI shall hold myself in eternal abhorrence if I have really terrified you"  "Indeed Sir Clement you have"  cried I  "but for Heaven's sake where is Madame Duvalwhy is she forced away"  "She is perfectly safe the Captain has her in charge but suffer me now my adored Miss Anville to take the only opportunity that is allowed me to speak upon another a much dearer much sweeter subject"  And then he hastily came into the chariot and seated himself next to me I would fain have disengaged myself from him but he would not let me  "Deny me not most charming of women"  cried he  "deny me not this only moment that is lent me to pour forth my soul into your gentle earsto tell you how much I suffer from your absencehow much I dread your displeasureand how cruelly I am affected by your coldness"  "O Sir this is no time for such languagepray leave me pray go to the relief of Madame DuvalI cannot bear that she should be treated with such indignity"  "And will youcan you command my absenceWhen may I speak to you if not nowdoes the Captain suffer me to breathe a moment out of his sightand are not a thousand imperti+nent people for ever at your elbow"  "Indeed Sir Clement you must change your style or I will not hear you The  impertinent people  you mean are among my best friends and you would not if you really wished me well speak of them so disrespectfully"  "Wish you wellO Miss Anville point but out to me how in what manner I may convince you of the fervour of my passiontell me but what services you will accept from me and you shall find my life my fortune my whole soul at your devotion"  "I want  nothing  Sir that you can offerI beg you not to talk to me soso strangely Pray leave me and pray assure yourself you cannot take any  method so successless to shew any regard for me as entering into schemes so frightful to Madame Duval and so disagreeable to myself"  "The scheme was the Captain's I even opposed it though I own I could not refuse myself the solongwishedfor happiness of speaking to you once more without so many ofyour  friends  to watch me And I had flattered myself that the note I had charged the footman to give you would have prevented the alarm you have received"  "Well Sir you have now I hope said enough and if you will not go yourself to see for Madame Duval at least suffer  me  to enquire what is become of her"  "And when may I speak to you again"  "No matter whenI don't knowperhaps"  "Perhaps what my angel"  "Perhaps  never  Sirif you torment me thus"  "Never O Miss Anville how cruel how piercing to my soul is that icy wordIndeed I cannot endure such displeasure"  Then Sir you must not provoke it Pray leave me directly"  "I will Madam but let me at least make a merit of my obedienceallow me to hope that you will in future be less averse to trusting yourself for a few moments alone with me"  I was surprized at the freedom of this request but while I hesitated how to answer it the other mask came up to the chariot door and in a voice almost stifled with laughter said  "I've done for her the old buck is safebut we must sheer off directly or we shall be all aground"  Sir Clement instantly left me mounted his horse and rode off The Captain having given some directions to the servants followed him  I was both uneasy and impatient to know the fate of Madame Duval and immediately got out of the chariot to seek her I desired the footman to shew me which was she was gone he pointed with his finger by way of answer and I saw that he dared not trust his voice to make any other I walked on a very quick pace and soon to my great consternation perceived the poor lady seated upright in a ditch I flew to her with unfeigned concern at her situation She was sobbing nay almost roaring and in the utmost agony of rage and terror As soon as she saw me she redoubled her cries but her voice was so broken I could not understand a word she said I was so much shocked that it was with difficulty I forbore exclaiming against the cruelty of the Captain for thus wantonly illtreating her and I could not forgive myself for having passively suffered the deception I used my utmost endeavours to comfort her assuring her of our present safety and begging her to rise and return to the chariot  Almost bursting with passion she pointed to her feet and with frightful violence she actually beat the ground with her hands  I then saw that her feet were tied together with a strong rope which was fastened to the upper branch of a tree even with an hedge which ran along the ditch where she sat I endeavoured to untie the knot but soon sound it was infinitely beyond my strength I was therefore obliged to apply to the footman but being very unwilling to add to his mirth by the sight of Madame Duval's situation I desired him to lend me a knife I  returned with it and cut the rope Her feet were soon disentangled and then though with great difficulty I assisted her to rise But what was my astonishment when the moment she was up she hit me a violent slap on the face I retreated from her with precipitation and dread and she then loaded me with reproaches which though almost unintelligible convinced me that she imagined I had voluntarily deserted her but she seemed not to have the slightest suspicion that she had not been attacked by real robbers  I was so much surprized and confounded at the blow that for some time I suffered her to rave without making any answer but her extreme agitation and real suffering soon dispelled my anger which all turned into compassion I then told her that I had been forcibly detained from following her and assured her of my real sorrow at her ill usage  She began to be somewhat appeased and I again entreated her to return to the carriage or give me leave to order that it should draw up to the place where we stood She made no answer till I told her that the longer we remained still the greater would be the danger of our ride home Struck with this hint she suddenly and with hasty steps moved forward  Her dress was in such disorder that I was quite sorry to have her figure exposed to the servants who all of them in imitation of their master hold her in derision however the disgrace was unavoidable  The ditch happily was almost quite dry or she must have suffered still more severely yet so forlorn so miserable a figure I never before saw Her headdress had fallen off her linen was torn  her negligee had not a pin left in it her petticoats she was obliged to hold on and her shoes were perpetually slipping off She was covered with dirt weeds and filth and her face was really horrible for the pomatum and powder from her head and the dust from the road were quite  pasted  on her skin by her tears which with her  rouge  made so frightful a mixture that she hardly looked human  The servants were ready to die with laughter the moment they saw her but not all my remonstrances could prevail upon her to get into the carriage till she had most vehemently reproached them both for not rescuing her The footman fixing his eyes on the ground as if fearful of again trusting himself to look at her protested that the robbers had vowed they would shoot him if he moved an inch and that one of them had stayed to watch the chariot while the other carried her off adding that the reason of their behaving so barbarously was to revenge our having secured our purses Notwithstanding her anger she gave immediate credit to what he said and really imagined that her want of money had irritated the pretended robbers to treat her with such cruelty I determined therefore to be carefully upon my guard not to betray the imposition which could now answer no other purpose than occasioning an irreparable breach between her and the Captain  Just as we were seated in the chariot she discovered the loss which her head had sustained and called out  "My God what is become of my hairwhy the villain has stole all my curls"  She then ordered the man to run and see if he could find any of them in the ditch He went and presently returning produced a great quantity  of hair in such a nasty condition that I was amazed she would take it and the man as he delivered it to her found it impossible to keep his countenance which she had no sooner observed than all her stormy passions were again raised She flung the battered curls in his face saying  "Sirrah what do you grin for I wish you'd been served so yourself and you would n't have found it no such joke you are the impudentest fellow ever I see and if I find you dare grin at me any more I shall make no ceremony of boxing your ears"  Satisfied with the threat the man hastily retired and we drove on  Her anger now subsiding into grief she began most sorrowfully to lament her case  "I believe  she cried  "never nobody was so unlucky as I am and so here because I ha'n't had misfortunes enough already that puppy has made me lose my curlsWhy I can't see nobody without themonly look at meI was never so bad off in my life before  Pardie  if I'd know'd as much I'd have brought two or three sets with me but I'd never a thought of such a thing as this"  Finding her now somewhat pacified I ventured to ask an account of her adventure which I will endeavour to write in her own words  "Why child all this misfortune comes of that puppy making us leave our money behind us for as soon as the robber see I did not put nothing in his hands he lugged me out of the chariot by main force and I verily thought he'd have murdered me He was as strong as a lion I was no more in his hands than a child But I believe never nobody was so abused before for he dragged me down the road pulling and hawling me all the way as if I'd no more feeling than a horse I'm sure I  wish I could see that man cut up and quartered alive however he'll come to the gallows that's one good thing So as soon as we'd got out of sight of the chariotthough he need n't have been afraid for if he'd beat me to a mummy those cowardly fellows would n't have said nothing to itSo when I was got there what does he do but all of a sudden he takes me by both the shoulders and he gives me such a shake  Mon Dieu  I shall never forget it if I live to be an hundred I'm sure I dare say I'm out of joint all over And though I made as much noise as ever I could he took no more notice of it than nothing at all but there he stood shaking me in that manner as if he was doing it for a wager I'm determined if it costs me all my fortune I'll see that villain hanged He shall be found out if there's e're a justice in England So when he had shooked me till he was tired and I felt all over like a jelly without saying never a word he takes and pops me into the ditch I'm sure I thought he'd have murdered me as sure as I ever thought any thing in my life for he kept bumping me about as if he thought nothing too bad for me However I'm resolved I'll never leave my purse behind me again the longest day I have to live So when he could n't stand over me no longer he holds out his hands again for my money but he was as cunning as he could be for he would n't speak a word because I should n't swear to his voice however that sha'nt save him for I'll swear to him any day in the year if I can but catch him So when I told him I had no money he fell to jerking me again just as if he had but that moment begun And after that he got me close by a tree and out of his pocket he pulls a  great cordIt's a wonder I did not swoon away for as sure as you're alive he was going to hang me to that tree I screamed like any thing mad and told him if he would but spare my life I'd never prosecute him nor tell nobody what he'd done to me so he stood some time quite in a brown study a thinking what he should do And so after that he forced me to sit down in the ditch and he tied my feet together just as you see them and then as if he had not done enough he twitched off my cap and without saying nothing got on his horse and left me in that condition thinking I suppose that I might lie there and perish"  Though this narrative almost compelled me to laugh yet I was really irritated with the Captain for carrying his love of tormenting  sport  he calls itto such barbarous and unjustifiable extremes I consoled and soothed her as well as I was able and told her that since M Du Bois had escaped I hoped when she recovered from her fright all would end well  "Fright child"  repeated she  "why that's not halfI promise you I wish it was but here I'm bruised from top to toe and it's well if ever I have the right use of my limbs again However I'm glad the villain got nothing but his trouble for his pains But here the worst is to come for I can't go out because I have got no curls and so he'll be escaped before I can get to the Justice to stop him I'm resolved I'll tell Lady Howard how her man served me for if he had'nt made me fling 'em away I dare say I could have pinned them up well enough for the country"  "Perhaps Lady Howard may be able to lend you a cap that will wear without them"  "Lady Howard indeed why do you think I'd wear one of her dowdies No I'll promise you I sha'nt put on no such disguisement It's the unluckiest thing in the world that I did not make the man pick up the curls again but he put me in such a passion I could not think of nothing I know I can't get none at Howard Grove for love nor money for of all the stupid places ever I see that Howard Grove is the worst there's never no getting nothing one wants"  This sort of conversation lasted till we arrived at our journey's end and then a new distress occurred Madame Duval was eager to speak to Lady Howard and Mrs Mirvan and to relate her misfortunes but she could not endure that Sir Clement or the Captain should see her in such disorder for she said they were so illnatured that instead of pitying her they would only make a jest of her disasters She therefore sent me first into the house to wait for an opportunity of their being out of the way that she might steal up stairs unobserved In this I succeeded as the gentlemen thought it most prudent not to seem watching for her though they both contrived to divert themselves with peeping at her as she passed  She went immediately to bed where she had her supper Lady Howard and Mrs Mirvan both of them very kindly sat with her and listened to her tale with compassionate attention while Miss Mirvan and I retired to our own room where I was very glad to end the troubles of the day in a comfortable conversation  The Captain's raptures during supper at the success of his plan were boundless I spoke afterwards to Mrs Mirvan with the openness which her kindness encourages and begged her to  remonstrate with him upon the cruelty of tormenting Madame Duval so causelessly She promised to take the first opportunity of starting the subject but said he was at present so much elated that he would not listen to her with any patience However should he make any new efforts to molest her I can by no means consent to be passive Had I imagined he would have been so violent I would have risked his anger in her defence much sooner  She has kept her bed all day and declares she is almost bruised to death  Adieu dear Sir What a long letter have I written I could almost fancy I sent it you from London  LETTER XXXIV  Evelina in continuation  Howard Grove  May  THIS insatiable Captain if left to himself would not I believe rest till he had tormented Madame Duval into a fever He seems to have no delight but in terrifying or provoking her and all his thoughts apparently turn upon inventing such methods as may do it most effectually  She had her breakfast again in bed yesterday morning but during ours the Captain with a very significant look at Sir Clement gave us to understand that he thought she had now rested long enough to bear the hardships of a fresh campaign  His meaning was obvious and therefore I resolved to endeavour immediately to put a stop to his intended exploits When breakfast was over I followed Mrs Mirvan out of the parlour and begged her to lose no time in pleading the cause of Madame Duval with the Captain  "My love"  answered she  I have already expostulated with him but all I can say is fruitless while his favourite Sir Clement contrives to urge him on"  "Then I will go and speak to Sir Clement"  said I  "for I know he will desist if I request him"  "Have a care my dear"  said she smiling  "it is sometimes dangerous to make requests to men who are too desirous of receiving them"  "Well then my dear Madam will you give me leave to speak myself to the Captain  "Willingly nay I will accompany you to him"  I thanked her and we went to seek him He was walking in the garden with Sir Clement Mrs Mirvan most obligingly made anopening for my purpose by saying  "Mr Mirvan I have brought a petitioner with me"  "Why what's the matter now"  cried he  I was fearful of making him angry and stammered very much when I told him I hoped he had no new plan for alarming Madame Duval  "  New  plan"  cried he  "why you don't suppose the  old  one would do again do you Not but what it was a very good one only I doubt she would n't bite"  "Indeed Sir  said I  "she has already suffered too much and I hope you will pardon me if I take the liberty of telling you that I think it  my duty to do all in my power to prevent her being again so much terrified"  A sullen gloominess instantly clouded his face and turning short from me he said I might do as I pleased but that I should much sooner repent than repair my officiousness  I was too much disconcerted at this rebuff to attempt making any answer and finding that Sir Clement warmly espoused my cause I walked away and left them to discuss the point together  Mrs Mirvan who never speaks to the Captain when he is out of humour was glad to follow me and with her usual sweetness made a thousand apologies for her husband's illmanners  When I left her I went to Madame Duval who was just risen and employed in examining the cloaths she had on the day of her ill usage  "Here's a sight cried she Come here childonly look  Pardie  so long as I've lived I never see so much before Why all my things are spoilt and what's worse my sacque was as good as new Here's the second negligee I've used in this mannerI am sure I was a fool to put it on in such a lonesome place as this however if I stay here these ten years I'll never put on another good gown that I'm resolved"  "Will you let the maid try if she can iron it out or clean it Ma'am  "No she'll only make bad worseBut look here now here's a cloak  Mon Dieu  why it looks like a dishclout Of all the unluckinesses that ever I met this is the worst for do you know I bought it but the day before I left ParisBesides into the bargain my cap's quite gone where the villain twitched it I don't know but I see no more of it from that time to this Now you  must know this was the becomingest cap I had in the world for I've never another with pink ribbon in it and to tell you the truth if I had n't thought to have seen M Du Bois I'd no more have put it on than I'd have flown for as to what one wears in such a stupid place as this it signifies no more than nothing at all"  She then told me that she had been thinking all night of a contrivance to hinder the Captain's finding out her loss of curls which was having a large gauze handkerchief pinned on her head as a hood and saying she had the toothach  "To tell you the truth"  added she  "I believe that Captain is one of the worst men in the world he's always making a joke of me and as to his being a gentleman he has no more manners than a bear for he's always upon the grin when one's in distress and I declare I'd rather be done any thing to than laughed at for to my mind it's one or other the disagreeablest thing in the world"  Mrs Mirvan I found had been endeavouring to dissuade her from the design she had formed of having recourse to the law in order to find out the supposed robbers for she dreads a discovery of the Captain during Madame Duval's stay at Howard Grove as it could not fail being productive of infinite commotion She has therefore taken great pains to shew the inutility of applying to justice unless she were more able to describe the offenders against whom she would appear and has assured her that as she neither heard their voices nor saw their faces she cannot possibly swear to their persons or obtain any redress  Madame Duval in telling me this extremely lamented her hard fate that she was thus prevented  from revenging her injuries which however she vowed she would not be persuaded to  pocket tamely  "because"  added she  "if such villains as these are let to have their own way and nobody takes no notice of their impudence they'll make no more ado than nothing at all of tying people in ditches and such things as that however I shall consult with M Du Bois as soon I can ferret out where he's hid himself I'm sure I've a right to his advice for it's all along of his gaping about at the Tower that I've met with these misfortunes"  "M Du Bois said I will I am sure be very sorry when he hears what has happened"  "And what good will that do nowthat won't unspoil all my cloaths I can tell him I a'n't much obliged to him though it's no fault of hisyet it i'n't the less provokinger for that I'm sure if he had been there to have seen me served in that manner and put neck and heels into a ditch he'd no more have thought it was me than the Pope of Rome I'll promise you whatever you may think of it I sha'n't have no rest night nor day till I find out that rogue"  "I have no doubt Madam but you will soon discover him"  "  Pardie  if I do I'll hang him as sure as fatebut what's the oddest is that he should take such a 'special spite against  me  above all the rest it was as much for nothing as could be for I don't know what I have done so particular bad to be used in that manner I'm sure I had n't given him no offence as I know of for I never see his face all the time and as to screaming a little I think it's very hard if one must n't do such a thing as that when one's put in fear of one's life"  During this conversation she endeavoured to adjust her headdress but could not at all please herself Indeed had I not been present I should have thought it impossible for a woman at her time of life to be so very difficult in regard to dress What she may have in view I cannot imagine but the labour of the toilette seems the chief business of her life  When I left her in my way down stairs I met with Sir Clement who with great earnestness said he must not be denied the honour of a moment's conversation with me and then without waiting for an answer he led me to the garden at the door of which however I absolutely insisted upon stopping  He seemed very serious and said in a very grave tone of voice  "At length Miss Anville I flatter myself that I have hit upon an expedient that will oblige you and therefore though it is death to myself I will put it in practice"  I begged him to explain himself  "I saw your desire of saving Madame Duval and scarce could I refrain giving the brutal Captain my real opinion of his savage conduct but I am unwilling to quarrel with him lest I should be denied entrance into a house which you inhabit I have been endeavouring to prevail with him to give up his absurd new scheme but I find him impenetrableI have therefore determined to make a pretence for suddenly leaving this place dear as it is to me and containing all I most admire and adoreand I will stay in town till the violence of this boobyish humour is abated"  He ssopped but I was silent for I knew not what I ought to say He took my hand which he pressed to his lips saying  "And must I then  Miss Anville must I quit yousacrifice voluntarily my greatest felicityand yet not be honoured with one word one look of approbation"  I withdrew my hand and said with a half laugh  "You know so well Sir Clement the value of the favours you confer that it would be superfluous for me to point it out"  "Charming charming girl how does your wit your understanding rise upon me daily and must I can I part with youwill no other method"  "O Sir do you so soon repent the good office you had planned for Madame Duval"  "For Madame Duvalcruel creature and will you not even suffer me to place to your account the sacrifice I am about to make"  "You must place it Sir to what account you please but I am too much in haste now to stay here any longer"  And then I would have left him but he held me and rather impatiently said  "If then I cannot be so happy as to oblige  you  Miss Anville you must not be surprised should I seek to oblige myself If my scheme is not honoured with your approbation for which alone it was formed why should I to my own infinite dissatisfaction pursue it"  We were then for a few minutes both silent I was really unwilling he should give up a plan which would so effectually break into the Captain's designs and at the same time save me the pain of disobliging him and I should instantly and thankfully have accepted his offered civility had not Mrs Mirvan's caution made me fearful However when he pressed me to speak I said in an ironical voice  "I had thought Sir that the very  strong sense you have yourself of the favour you propose to me would sufficiently have repaid you but as I was mistaken I must thank you myself And now"  making a low courtesy  "I hope Sir you are satisfied"  "Loveliest of thy sex"  he began but I forced myself from him and ran up stairs  Soon after Miss Mirvan told me that Sir Clement had just received a letter which obliged him instantly to leave the Grove and that he had actually ordered a chaise I then acquainted her with the real state of the affair Indeed I conceal nothing from her she is so gentle and sweettempered that it gives me great pleasure to place an entire confidence in her  At dinner I must own we all missed him for though the flightiness of his behaviour to me when we are by ourselves is very distressing yet in large companies and general conversation he is extremely entertaining and agreeable As to the Captain he has been so much chagrined at his departure that he has scarce spoken a word since he went but Madame Duval who made her first public appearance since her accident was quite in raptures that she escaped seeing him  The money which we left at the farmhouse has been returned to us What pains the Captain must have taken to arrange and manage the adventures which he chose we should meet with Yet he must certainly be discovered for Madame Duval is already very much perplexed at having received a letter this morning from M Du Bois in which he makes no mention of his imprisonment However she has so little suspicion that she imputes his silence upon the subject to his fears that the letter might be intercepted  Not one opportunity could I meet with while Sir Clement was here to enquire after his friend Lord Orville but I think it was strange he should never mention him unasked Indeed I rather wonder that Mrs Mirvan herself did not introduce the subject for she always seemed particularly attentive to him  And now once more all my thoughts involuntarily turn upon the letter I so soon expect from Paris This visit of Sir Clement has however somewhat diverted my fears and therefore I am very glad he made it at this time Adieu my dear Sir  LETTER XXXV  Sir John Belmont to Lady Howard  Paris  May  Madam  I Have this moment the honour of your Ladyship's letter and I will not wait another before I return an answer  It seldom happens that a man though extolled as a saint is really without blemish or that another though reviled as a devil is really without humanity Perhaps the time is not very distant when I may have the honour to convince your Ladyship of this truth in regard to Mr Villars and myself  As to the young Lady whom Mr Villars so obligingly proposes presenting to me I wish her all the happiness to which by your Ladyship's account she seems entitled and if she has a third  part of the merit of  her  to whom you compare her I doubt not but Mr Villars will be more successful in every other application he may make for her advantage than he can ever be in any with which he may be pleased to favour me  I have the honour to be Madam your Ladyship's most humble and most obedient servant JOHN BELMONT  LETTER XXXVI  Evelina to the Rev Mr Villars  Howard Grove  May  WELL my dear Sir all is now over the letter so anxiously expected is at length arrived and my doom is fixed The various feelings which oppress me I have not language to describe nor need Iyou know my heart you have yourself formed itand its sensations upon this occasion you may but too readily imagine  Outcast as I am and rejected for ever by him to whom I of right belongshall I now implore  your  continual protectionno noI will not offend your generous heart which open to distress has no wish but to relieve it with an application that would seem to imply a doubt I am more secure than ever of your kindness since you now know upon that is my sole dependance  I endeavour to bear this stroke with composure and in such a manner as if I had already received your counsel and consolation Yet at times my  emotions are almost too much for me O Sir what a letter for a parent to write must I not myself be deaf to the voice of Nature if I could endure to be thus absolutely abandoned without regret I dare not even to you nor would I could I help it to myself acknowledge all that I think for indeed I have sometimes sentiments upon this rejection which my strongest sense of duty can scarcely correct Yet suffer me to askmight not this answer have been softenedwas it not enough to disclaim me for ever without treating me with contempt and wounding me with derision  But while I am thus thinking of myself I forget how much more  he  is the object of sorrow than I am Alas what amends can he make himself for the anguish he is hoarding up for time to come My heart bleeds for him whenever this reflection occurs to me  What is said of  you  my protector my friend my benefactorI dare not trust myself to comment upon Gracious Heaven what a return for goodness so unparalleled  I would fain endeavour to divert my thoughts from this subject but even that is not in my power for afflicting as this letter is to me I find that it will not be allowed to conclude the affair though it does all my expectations for Madame Duval has determined not to let it rest here She heard the letter in great wrath and protested she would not be so easily answered she regretted her facility in having been prevailed upon to yield the direction of this affair to those who knew not how to manage it and vowed she would herself undertake and conduct it in future  It is in vain that I have pleaded against her resolution and besought her to forbear an attack where she has nothing to expect but resentment especially as there seems to be a hint that Lady Howard will one day be more openly dealt with she will not hear me she is furiously bent upon a project which is terrible to think offor she means to go go herself to Paris take me with her and there  face to face  demand justice  How to appease or to persuade her I know not but for the universe would I not be dragged in such a manner to an interview so awful with a parent I have never yet beheld  Lady Howard and Mrs Mirvan are both of them infinitely shocked at the present situation of affairs and they seem to be even more kind to me than ever and my dear Maria who is the friend of my heart uses her utmost efforts to console me and when she fails in her design with still greater kindness she sympathises in my sorrow  I very much rejoice however that Sir Clement Willoughby had left us before this letter arrived I am sure the general confusion of the house would otherwise have betrayed to him the whole of a tale which I now more than ever wish to have buried in oblivion  Lady Howard thinks I ought not to disoblige Madame Duval yet she acknowledges the impropriety of my accompanying her abroad upon such an enterprize Indeed I would rather die than force myself into his presence But so vehement is Madame Duval that she would instantly have compelled me to attend her to town in her way to Paris had not Lady Howard so far exerted herself as to declare she could by no means consent to my  quitting her house till she gave me up to you by whose permission I had entered it  She was extremely angry at this denial and the Captain by his sneers and raillery so much encreased her rage that she has positively declared should your next letter dispute her authority to guide me by her own pleasure she will without hesitation make a journey to Berry Hill and  teach you to know who she is  Should she put this threat in execution nothing could give me greater uneasiness for her violence and volubility would almost distract you  Unable as I am to act for myself or to judge what conduct I ought to pursue how grateful do I feel myself that I have such a guide and director to counsel and instruct me as yourself  Adieu my dearest Sir Heaven I trust will never never let me live to be repulsed and derided by  you  to whom I may now sign myself  Wholly your EVELINA  LETTER XXXVII  Mr Villars to Evelina  Berry Hill  May  LET not my Evelina be depressed by a stroke of fortune for which she is not responsible No breach of duty on your part has incurred the unkindness which has been shewn you nor have you by any act of imprudence provoked either censure or reproach Let me entreat you therefore my dearest child to support yourself with that courage  which your innocency ought to inspire and let all the affliction you allow yourself be for him only who not having that support must one day be but too severely sensible how much he wants it  The hint thrown out concerning myself is wholly unintelligible to me my heart I dare own fully acquits me of vice but  without blemish  I have never ventured to pronounce myself However it seems his intention to be hereafter more explicit and  then  should any thing appear that has on  my  part contributed to those misfortunes we lament let me at least say that the most partial of my friends cannot be so much astonished as I shall myself be at such a discovery  The mention also of any  future applications  I may make is equally beyond my comprehension But I will not dwell upon a subject which almost compels from me reflections that cannot but be wounding to a heart so formed for filial tenderness as my Evelina's There is an air of mystery throughout the letter the explanation of which I will await in silence  The scheme of Madame Duval is such as might be reasonably expected from a woman so little inured to disappointment and so totally incapable of considering the delicacy of your situation Your averseness to her plan gives me pleasure for it exactly corresponds with my own Why will she not make the journey she projects by herself She would not have even the wish of an opposition to encounter And then once more might my child and myself be left to the quiet enjoyment of that peaceful happiness which she alone has interrupted As to her coming hither I could indeed dispense with such a visit but if she will not be  satisfied with my refusal by letter I must submit to the task of giving it her in person  My impatience for your return is encreased by your account of Sir Clement Willoughby's visit to Howard Grove I am but little surprized at the perseverance of his assiduities to interest you in his favour but I am very much hurt that you should be exposed to addresses which by their privacy have an air that shocks me You cannot my love be too circumspect the slightest carelessness on your part will be taken advantage of by a man of his disposition It is not sufficient for you to be reserved his conduct even calls for your resentment and should he again as will doubtless be his endeavour contrive to solicit your favour in private let your disdain and displeasure be so marked as to constrain a change in his behaviour Though indeed should his visit be repeated while you remain at the Grove Lady Howard must pardon me if I shorten your's  Adieu my child You will always make my respects to the hospitable family to which we are so much obliged  LETTER XXXVII  Mr Villars to Lady Howard  BerryHill  May  Dear Madam  I BELIEVE your Ladyship will not be surprized at hearing I have had a visit from Madame Duval as I doubt not her having made known her intention before she left Howard Grove I would gladly  have excused myself this meeting could I have avoided it decently but after so long a journey it was not possible to refuse her admittance  She told me that she came to Berry Hill in consequence of a letter I had sent to her granddaughter in which I had forbid her going to Paris Very roughly she then called me to account for the authority which I assumed and had I been disposed to have argued with her she would very angrily have disputed the right by which I used it But I declined all debating I therefore listened very quietly till she had so much fatigued herself with talking that she was glad in her turn to be silent And then I begged to know the purport of her visit  She answered that she came to make me relinquish the power I had usurped over her granddaughter and assured me she would not quit the place till she succeeded  But I will not trouble your Ladyship with the particulars of this disagreeable conversation nor should I but on account of the result have chosen so unpleasant a subject for your perusal However I will be as concise as I possibly can that the better occupations of your ladyship's time may be the less impeded  When she found me inexorable in refusing Evelina's attending her to Paris she peremptorily insisted that she should at least live with her in London till Sir John Belmont's return I remonstrated against this scheme with all the energy in my power but the contest was vain she lost her patience and I my time She declared that if I was resolute in opposing her she would instantly make a will in which she would leave all her  fortune to strangers though otherwise she intended her granddaughter for her sole heiress  To me I own this threat seemed of little consequence I have long accustomed myself to think that with a competency of which she is sure my child might be as happy as in the possession of millions but the incertitude of her future fate deters me from following implicitly the dictates of my present judgment The connections she may hereafter form the style of life for which she may be destined and the future family to which she may belong are considerations which give but too much weight to the menaces of Madame Duval In short Madam after a discourse infinitely tedious I was obliged though very reluctantly to compromise with this ungovernable woman by consenting that Evelina should pass one month with her  I never made a concession with so bad a grace or so much regret The violence and vulgarity of this woman her total ignorance of propriety the family to which she is related and the company she is likely to keep are objections so forcible to her having the charge of this dear child that nothing less than my diffidence of the right I have of depriving her of so large a fortune would have induced me to listen to her proposal Indeed we parted at last equally discontented she at what I had refused I at what I had granted  It now only remains for me to return your Ladyship my humble acknowledgments for the kindness which you have so liberally shewn to my ward and to beg you would have the goodness to part with her when Madame Duval thinks proper  to claim the promise which she has extorted from me I am  Dear Madam c  ARTHUR VILLARS  LETTER XXXIX  Mr Villars to Evelina  Berry Hill  May  WITH a reluctance which occasions me inexpressible uneasiness I have been almost compelled to consent that my Evelina should quit the protection of the hospitable and respectable Lady Howard and accompany Madame Duval to a city to which I had hoped she had bid an eternal adieu But alas my dear child we are the slaves of custom the dupes of prejudice and dare not stem the torrent of an opposing world even though our judgments condemn our compliance however since the die is cast we must endeavour to make the best of it  You will have occasion in the course of the month you are to pass with Madame Duval for all the circumspection and prudence you can call to your aid she will not I know propose any thing to you which she thinks wrong herself but you must learn not only to  judge  but to  act  for yourself if any schemes are started any engagements made which your understanding represents to you as improper exert yourself resolutely in avoiding them and do not by a too passive facility risk the censure of the world or your own future regret  You cannot too assiduously attend to Madame Duval herself but I would wish you to mix as little  as possible with her associates who are not likely to be among those whose acquaintance would reflect credit upon you Remember my dear Evelina nothing is so delicate as the reputation of a woman it is at once the most beautiful and most brittle of all human things  Adieu my beloved child I shall be but ill at ease till this month is elapsed  A V  LETTER XL  Evelina to the Rev Mr Villars  London  June  ONCE more my dearest Sir I write to you from this great city Yesterday morning with the truest concern I quitted the dear inhabitants of Howard Grove and most impatiently shall I count the days till I see them again Lady Howard and Mrs Mirvan took leave of me with the most flattering kindness but indeed I knew not how to part with Maria whose own apparent sorrow redoubled mine She made me promise to send her a letter every post And I shall write to her with the same fre  om and almost the same confidence you allow me to make use of to yourself  The Captain was very civil to me but he wrangled with poor Madame Duval to the last moment and taking me aside just before we got into the chaise he said  "Hark'ee Miss Anville I've a favour for to ask of you which is this that you will write us word how the old gentlewoman finds herself when she sees it was all a trick and  what the French lubber says to it and all about it"  I answered that I would obey him though I was very little pleased with the commission which to me was highly improper but he will either treat me as an  informer  or make me a party in his frolic  As soon as we drove away Madame Duval with much satisfaction exclaimed  "  Dieu merci  we've got off at last I'm sure I never desire to see that place again It's a wonder I've got away alive for I believe I've had the worst luck ever was known from the time I set my foot upon the threshold I know I wish I'd never a gone Besides into the bargain it's the most dullest place in all Christendom there's never no diversions nor nothing at all"  Then she bewailed M Du Bois concerning whose adventures she continued to make various conjectures during the rest of our journey  When I asked her what part of London she should reside in she told me that Mr Branghton was to meet us at an inn and would conduct us to a lodging Accordingly we proceeded to a house in Bishopsgatestreet and were led by a waiter into a room where we found Mr Branghton  He received us very civilly but seemed rather surprised at seeing me saying  "Why I did n't think of your bringing Miss however she's very welcome"  "I'll tell you how it was"  said Madame Duval  "you must know I've a mind to take the girl to Paris that she may see something of the world and improve herself a little besides I've another reason that you and I will talk more about but do you know that meddling old parson as I told you of  ould not let her go however I'm resolved I'll  be even with him for I shall take her on with me without saying never a word more to nobody"  I started at this intimation which very much surprised me But I am very glad she has discovered her intention as I shall be carefully upon my guard not to venture from town with her  Mr Branghton then hoped we had passed our time agreeably in the country  "O Lord Cousin"  cried she  "I've been the miserablest creature in the world I'm sure all the horses in London shan't drag me into the country again of one while why how do you think I've been servedonly guess"  "Indeed Cousin I can't pretend to do that"  "Why then I'll tell you Do you know I've been robbedthat is the villain would have robbed me if he could only I'd secured all my money"  "Why then Cousin I think your loss can't have been very great"  "O Lord you don't know what you're a saying you're talking in the unthinkingest manner in the world why it was all along of not having no money that I met with that misfortune"  "How's that Cousin I don't see what great misfortune you can have met with if you'd secured all your money"  "That's because you don't know nothing of the matter for there the villain came to the chaise and because we had n't got nothing to give him though he'd no more right to our money than the man in the moon yet do you know he fell into the greatest passion ever you see and abused me in such a manner and put me in a ditch and got a rope o' purpose to hang meand I'm sure if that was n't misfortune enough why I don't know what is"  "This is a hard case indeed Cousin But why don't you go to justice Fielding"  "O as to that I'm a going to him directly but only I want first to see poor M Du Bois for the oddest thing of all is that he has wrote to me and never said nothing of where he is nor what's become of him nor nothing else"  "M Du Bois why he's at my house at this very time"  "M Du Bois at your house well I declare this is the surprisingest part of all however I assure you I think he might have comed for me as well as you considering what I have gone through on his account for to tell you the truth it was all along of him that I met with that accident so I don't take it very kind of him I promise you"  "Well but Cousin tell me some of the particulars of this affair"  "As to the particulars I'm sure they'd make your hair stand an end to hear them however the beginning of it all was thro' the fault of M Du Bois but I'll assure you he may take care of himself in future since he don't so much as come to see if I'm dead or alivebut there I went for him to a justice of peace and rode all out of the way and did every thing in the world and was used worser than a dog and all for the sake of serving him and now you see he don't so muchwell I was a fool for my painshowever he may get somebody else to be treated so another time for if he's taken up every day in the week I'll never go after him no more"  This occasioned an explanation in the course of which Madame Duval to her utter amazement heard that M Du Bois had never left London during her absence nor did Mr Branghton believe  that he had ever been to the Tower or met with any kind of accident  Almost instantly the whole truth of the transaction seemed to  rush upon her mind  and her wrath was inconceivably violent She asked me a thousand questions in a breath but fortunately was too vehement to attend to my embarrassment which must otherwise have betrayed my knowledge of the deceit Revenge was her first wish and she vowed she would go the next morning to Justice Fielding and enquire what punishment she might lawfully inflict upon the Captain for his assault  I believe we were an hour in Bishopsgatestreet ere poor Madame Duval could allow any thing to be mentioned but her own story at length however Mr Branghton told her that M Du Bois and all his own family were waiting for her at his house A hackneycoach was then called and we proceeded to Snowhill  Mr Branghton's house is small and inconvenient though his shop which takes in all the ground floor is large and commodious I believe I told you before that he is a silversmith  We were conducted up two pair of stairs for the diningroom Mr Branghton told us was  let  His two daughters their brother M Du Bois and a young man were at tea They had waited some time for Madame Duval but I found they had not any expectation that I should accompany her and the young ladies I believe were rather more surprised than pleased when I made my appearance for they seemed hurt that I should see their apartment Indeed I would willingly have saved them that pain had it been in my power  The first person who saw me was M Du Bois  "  Ah mon Dieu  "  exclaimed he  voil√† Mademoiselle  "  "Goodness"  cried young Branghton  if there is n't Miss"  "Lord so there is"  said Miss Polly  "well I'm sure I should never have dreamed of Miss's coming"  "Nor I neither I'm sure"  cried Miss Branghton  "or else I would not have been in this room to see her I'm quite ashamed about itonly not thinking of seeing any body but my aunthowever Tom it's all your fault for you know very well I wanted to borrow Mr Smith's room only you were so  grumty  you would not let me"  "Lord what signifies"  said the brother  "I dare be sworn Miss has been up two pair of stairs before nowHa'n't you Miss"  I begged that I might not give them the least disturbance and assured them that I had not any choice in regard to what room we sat in  "Well"  said Miss Polly  "when you come next Miss we'll have Mr Smith's room and it's a very pretty one and only up one pair of stairs and nicely furnished and every thing"  "To say the truth"  said Miss Branghton  "I thought that my cousin would not upon any account have come to town in the summer time for it's not at all the  fashion  so to be sure thinks I she'll stay till September when the playhouses open"  This was my reception which I believe you will not call a very  cordial  one Madame Duval who after having severely reprimanded M Du Bois for his negligence was just entering upon the story of her misfortunes now wholly engaged the company  M Du Bois listened to her with a look of the utmost horror repeatedly lifting up his eyes and hands and exclaiming  "  O ciel quel barbare  "  The young ladies gave her the most earnest attention but their brother and the young man kept a broad grin upon their faces during the whole recital She was however too much engaged to observe them but when she mentioned having been tied in a ditch young Branghton no longer able to constrain himself burst into a loud laugh declaring that he had never heard any thing so  funny  in his life His laugh was heartily reechoed by his friend the Miss Branghtons could not resist the example and poor Madame Duval to her extreme amazement was absolutely overpowered and stopped by the violence of their mirth  For some minutes the room seemed quite in an uproar the rage of Madame Duval the astonishment of M Du Bois and the angry interrogatories of Mr Branghton on one side the convulsive tittering of the sisters and the loud laughs of the young men on the other occasioned such noise passion and confusion that had any one stopped an instant on the stairs he must have concluded himself in Bedlam At length however the father brought them to order and half laughing half frightened they made Madame Duval some very awkward apologies But she would not be prevailed upon to continue her narrative till they had protested they were laughing at the Captain and not at her Appeased by this she resumed her story which by the help of stuffing handkerchiefs into their mouths the young people heard with tolerable decency  Every body agreed that the ill usage the Captain had given her was  actionable  and Mr Branghton  said he was sure she might recover what damages she pleased since she had been put in fear of her life  She then with great delight declared that she would lose no time in satisfying her revenge and vowed she would not be contented with less than half his fortune  "For though"  said she  "I don't put no value upon the money because  Dieu merci  I ha'n't no want of it yet I don't wish for nothing so much as to punish that fellow for I'm sure whatever's the cause of it he owes me a great  grudge  and I know no more what it's for than you do but he's always been doing me one spite or other ever since I knew him"  Soon after tea Miss Branghton took an opportunity to tell me in a whisper that the young man I saw was a lover of her sister's that his name was Brown and that he was a haberdasher with many other particulars of his circumstances and family and then she declared her utter aversion to the thoughts of such a match but added that her sister had no manner of spirit or ambition though for her part she would ten times rather die an old maid than marry any person but a gentleman  And for that matter"  added she  "I believe Polly herself don't care much for him only she's in such a hurry because I suppose she's a mind to be married before me however she's very welcome for I'm sure I don't care a pin's point whether I ever marry at allit's all one to me"  Some time after this Miss Polly contrived to tell  her  story She assured me with much tittering that her sister was in a great fright lest she should be married first  "So I make her believe that I will"  continued she  "for I love dearly to plague her a little though I declare I don't  intend to have Mr Brown in reality I'm sure I don't like him half well enoughdo you Miss"  "It is not possible for me to judge of his merits said I as I am entirely a stranger to him"  "But what do you think of him Miss"  "Why really II don't know"  "But do you think him handsome Some people reckon him to have a good pretty personbut I'm sure for my part I think he's monstrous uglydon't  you  Miss"  "I am no judgebut I think his person is veryvery well"  "  Very well  Why pray Miss"  in a tone of vexation  "what fault can you find with it"  "O none at all"  "I'm sure you must be very illnatured if you could Now there's Biddy says she thinks nothing of himbut I know it's all out of spite You must know Miss it makes her as mad as can be that I should have a lover before her but she's so proud that nobody will court her and I often tell her she'll die an old maid But the thing is she has taken it into her head to have a liking for Mr Smith as lodges on the first floor but Lord he'll never have her for he's quite a fine gentleman and besides Mr Brown heard him say one day that he'd never marry as long as he lived for he'd no opinion of matrimony"  "And did you tell your sister this"  "O to be sure I told her directly but she did not mind me however if she will be a fool she must"  This extreme want of affection and goodnature increased the distaste I already felt for these unamiable sisters and a confidence so entirely unsolicited  and unnecessary manifested equally their folly and their want of decency  I was very glad when the time for our departing arrived Mr Branghton said our lodgings were in Holborn that we might be near his house and neighbourly He accompanied us to them himself  Our rooms are large and not inconvenient our landlord is an hosier I am sure I have a thousand reasons to rejoice that I am so little known for my present situation is in every respect very unenviable and I would not for the world be seen by any acquaintance of Mrs Mirvan  This morning Madame Duval attended by all the Branghtons actually went to a Justice in the neighbourhood to report the Captain's ill usage of her I had great difficulty in excusing myself from being of the party which would have given me very serious concern Indeed I was extremely anxious though at home till I heard the result of the application for I dread to think of the uneasiness which such an affair would occasion the amiable Mrs Mirvan But fortunately Madame Duval has received very little encouragement to proceed in her design for she has been informed that as she neither heard the voice nor saw the face of the person suspected she will find it difficult to cast him upon  conjecture  and will have but little probability of gaining her cause unless she can procure witnesses of the transaction Mr Branghton therefore who has considered all the circumstances of the affair is of opinion that the lawsuit will not only be expensive but tedious and hazardous and has advised against it Madame Duval though very unwillingly has acquiesced in his decision but vows that if ever she is so affronted again she will be revenged even if  she ruins herself I am extremeiy glad that this ridiculous adventure seems now likely to end without more serious consequences  Adieu my dearest Sir My direction is at Mr Dawkins's a hosier in High Holborn  LETTER XLI  Evelina to Miss Mirvan  June th  I HAVE no words my sweet friend to express the thankfulness I feel for the unbounded kindness which you your dear mother and the muchhonoured Lady Howard have shewn me and still less can I find language to tell you with what reluctance I parted from such dear and generous friends whose goodness reflects at once so much honour on their own hearts and on her to whom it has been so liberally bestowed But I will not repeat what I have already written to the kind Mrs Mirvan I will remember your admonitions and confine to my own breast that gratitude with which you have filled it and teach my pen to dwell upon subjects less painful to my generous correspondent  O Maria London now seems no longer the same place where I lately enjoyed so much happiness every thing is new and strange to me even the town itself has not the same aspectmy situation so altered my home so differentmy companions so changedBut you well know my averseness to this journey  Indeed to me London now seems a desart that gay and busy appearance it so lately wore is now succeeded by a look of gloom fatigue and lassitude the air seems stagnant the heat is intense  the dust intolerable and the inhabitants illiterate and underbred At least such is the face of things in the part of the town where I at present reside  Tell me my dear Maria do you never retrace in your memory the time we past here when together to mine it recurs for ever And yet I think I rather recollect a dream or some visionary fancy than a realityThat I should ever have been known to Lord Orvillethat I should have spoken tohave danced with himseems now a romantic illusion and that elegant politeness that flattering attention that highbred delicacy which so much distinguished him above all other men and which struck us with such admiration I now retrace the remembrance of rather as belonging to an object of ideal perfection formed by my own imagination than to a being of the same race and nature as those with whom I at present converse  I have no news for you my dear Miss Mirvan for all that I could venture to say of Madame Duval I have already written to your sweet mother and as to adventures I have none to record Situated as I now am I heartily hope I shall not meet with any my wish is to remain quiet and unnoticed  Adieu excuse the gravity of this letter and believe me  Your most sincerely affectionate and obliged EVELINA ANVILLE  LETTER XLII  Evelina to the Rev Mr Villars  Holborn  June th  YESTERDAY morning we received an invitation to dine and spend the day at Mr Branghton's  and M Du Bois who was also invited called to conduct us to Snowhill  Young Branghton received us at the door and the first words he spoke were  "Do you know "Sisters a'n't dressed yet"  Then hurrying us into the house he said to me  "Come Miss you shall go up stairs and catch 'emI dare say they're at the glass"  He would have taken my hand but I declined his civility and begged to follow Madame Duval Mr Branghton then appeared and led the way himself We went as before up two pair of stairs but the moment the father opened the door the daughters both gave a loud scream We all stopped and then Miss Branghton called out  "Lord Papa what do you bring the company up here for why Polly and I a'n't half dressed"  "More shame for you"  answered he  here's your aunt and cousin and M Du Bois all waiting and ne'er a room to take them to"  "Who'd have thought of their coming so soon"  cried she  "I'm sure for my part I thought Miss was used to nothing but quality hours"  "Why I shan't be ready this halfhour yet"  said Miss Polly  "can't they stay in the shop till we're dressed"  Mr Branghton was very angry and scolded them violently however we were obliged to descend and stools were procured for us in the shop where we found the brother who was highly delighted he said that his sisters had been  catched  and he thought proper to entertain me with a long account of their tediousness and the many quarrels they all had together  When at length these ladies were equipped to their satisfaction they made their appearance but  before any conversation was suffered to pass between them and us they had a long and most disagreeable dialogue with their father to whose reprimands though so justly incurred they replied with the utmost pertness and rudeness while their brother all the time laughed aloud  The moment they perceived this they were so much provoked that instead of making any apologies to Madame Duval they next began a quarrel with him  "Tom what do you laugh for I wonder what business you have to be always a laughing when Papa scolds us"  "Then what business have you to be such a while getting on your cloaths You're never ready you know well enough"  "Lord Sir I wonder what that's to you I wish you'd mind your own affairs and not trouble yourself about ours How should a boy like you know any thing"  "A boy indeed not such a boy neither I'll warrant you'll be glad to be as young when you come to be old maids"  This sort of dialogue we were amused with till dinner was ready when we again mounted up two pair of stairs  In our way Miss Polly told me that her sister had asked Mr Smith for his room to dine in but he had refused to lend it  "because"  she said  "one day it happened to be a little greased however we shall have it to drink tea in and then perhaps you may see him and I assure you he's quite like one of the quality and dresses as fine and goes to balls and dances and every thing quite in tasteand besides Miss he keeps a footboy of his own too"  The dinner was illserved illcooked and illmanaged The maid who waited had so often to go down stairs for something that was forgotten that the Branghtons were perpetually obliged to rise from table themselves to get plates knives and forks bread or beer Had they been without  pretensions  all this would have seemed of no consequence but they aimed at appearing to advantage and even fancied they succeeded However the most disagreeable part of our fare was that the whole family continually disputed whose turn it was to rise and whose to be allowed to sit still  When this meal was over Madame Duval Mr Branghton and in broken English M Du Bois entered into an argument concerning the French nation and Miss Polly then addressing herself to me said  "Don't you think Miss it's very dull sitting up stairs here we'd better go down  to shop  and then we shall see the people go by"  "Lord Poll"  said the brother  "you're always wanting to be staring and gaping and I'm sure you need n't be so fond of shewing yourself for you're ugly enough to frighten a horse"  "Ugly indeed I wonder which is best you or me But I tell you what Tom you've no need to give yourself such airs for if you do I'll tell Miss of you know what"  "Who cares if you do You may tell what you will I don't mind"  "Indeed"  cried I  "I do not desire to hear any secrets"  "O but I'm resolved I'll tell you because Tom's so very spiteful You must know Miss t'other night"  "Poll"  cried the brother  "if you tell of that Miss shall know all about your meeting young Brownyou know whenSo I'll be quits with you one way or another"  Miss Polly coloured and again proposed our going down stairs till Mr Smith's room was ready for our reception  "Aye so we will"  said Miss Branghton  "I'll assure you Cousin we have some very genteel people pass by our shop sometimes Polly and I always go and sit there when we've cleaned ourselves"  "Yes Miss"  cried the brother  "they do nothing else all day long when father don't scold them But the best fun is when they've got all their dirty things on and all their hair about their ears sometimes I send young Brown up stairs to them and then there's such a fussthere they hide themselves and run away and squeal and squall like any thing mad and so then I puts the two cats into the room and I gives 'em a good whipping and so that sets them a squalling too so there's such a noise and such an uproarLord you can't think Miss what fun it is"  This occasioned a fresh quarrel with the sisters at the end of which it was at length decided that we should go to the shop  In our way down stairs Miss Branghton said aloud  "I wonder when Mr Smith's room will be ready"  "So do I"  answered Polly  "I'm sure we should not do any harm to it now"  This hint had not the desired effect for we were suffered to proceed very quietly  As we entered the shop I observed a young man in deep mourning leaning against the wall with  his arms folded and his eyes fixed on the ground apparently in profound and melancholy meditation but the moment he perceived us he started and making a passing bow very abruptly retired As I found he was permitted to go quite unnoticed I could not forbear enquiring who he was  "Lord"  answered Miss Branghton  "he's nothing but a poor Scotch poet"  "For my part"  said Miss Polly  "I believe he's just starved for I don't find he has any thing to live upon"  "Live upon"  cried the brother  "why he's a poet you know so he may live upon learning"  "Aye and good enough for him too"  said Miss Branghton  "for he's as proud as he's poor"  "Like enough"  replied the brother  "but for all that you won't find he will live without meat and drink no no catch a Scotchman at that if you can why they only come here for what they can get"  "I'm sure"  said Miss Branghton  "I wonder Papa 'll be such a fool as to let him stay in the house for I dare say he'll never pay for his lodging"  "Why no more he would if he could get another Lodger you know the bill's been put up this fortnight Miss if you should hear of a person that wants a room I assure you it is a very good one for all it's up three pair of stairs"  I answered that as I had no acquaintance in London I had not any chance of assisting them but both my compassion and my curiosity were excited for this poor young man and I asked them some further particulars concerning him  They then acquainted me that they had only known him three months When he first lodged  with them he agreed to board also but had lately told them he would eat by himself though they all believed he had hardly ever tasted a morsel of meat since he left their table They said that he had always appeared very lowspirited but for the last month he had been  duller  than ever and all of a sudden had put himself into mourning though they knew not for whom nor for what but they supposed it was only for convenience as no person had ever been to see or enquire for him since his residence amongst them and they were sure he was very poor as he had not paid for his lodgings the last three weeks and finally they concluded he was a poet or else halfcrazy because they had at different times found scraps of poetry in his room  They then produced some unfinished verses written on small pieces of paper unconnected and of a most melancholy cast Among them was the fragment of an ode which at my request they lent me to copy and as you may perhaps like to see it I will write it now  O LIFE thou lingering dream of grief of pain  And every ill that nature can sustain  Strange mutable and wild  Now flattering with Hope most fair  Depressing now with fell Despair  The nurse of Guilt the slave of Pride  That like a wayward child  Who to himself a foe  Sees joy alone in what's denied  In what is granted woe  O thou poor feeble fleeting pow'r  By Vice seduc'd by Folly woo'd  By Mis'ry Shame Remorse pursu'd  And as thy toilsome steps proceed  Seeming to Youth the fairest flow'r  Proving to Age the rankest weed  A gilded but a bitter pill  Of varied great and complicated ill  These lines are harsh but they indicate an internal wretchedness which I own affects me Surely this young man must be involved in misfortunes of no common nature but I cannot imagine what can induce him to remain with this unfeeling family where he is most unworthily despised for being poor and most illiberally detested for being a Scotchman He may indeed have motives which he cannot surmount for submitting to such a situation Whatever they are I most heartily pity him and cannot but wish it were in my power to afford him some relief  During this conversation Mr Smith's foot boy came to Miss Branghton and informed her that his master said she might have the room now when she liked it for that he was presently going out  This very genteel message though it perfectly satisfied the Miss Branghtons by no means added to my desire of being introduced to this gentleman and upon their rising with intention to accept his offer I begged they would excuse my attending them and said I would sit with Madame Duval till the tea was ready  I therefore once more went up two pair of stairs with young Branghton who insisted upon accompanying me and there we remained till Mr  Smith's footboy summoned us to tea when I followed Madame Duval into the diningroom  The Miss Branghtons were seated at one window and Mr Smith was lolling indolently out of the other They all approached us at our entrance and Mr Smith probably to shew he was master of the apartment most officiously handed me to a great chair at the upper end of the room without taking any notice of Madame Duval till I rose and offered her my own seat  Leaving the rest of the company to entertain themselves he very abruptly began to address himself to me in a style of gallantry equally new and disagreeable to me It is true no man can possibly pay me greater compliments or make more fine speeches than Sir Clement Willoughby yet his language though too flowery is always that of a gentleman and his address and manners are so very superior to those of the inhabitants of this house that to make any comparison between him and Mr Smith would be extremely unjust This latter seems very desirous of appearing a man of gaiety and spirit but his vivacity is so low bred and his whole behaviour so forward and disagreeable that I should prefer the company of  dullness  itself even as that goddess is described by Pope to that of this  sprightly  young man  He made many apologies that he had not lent his room for our dinner which he said he should certainly have done had he seen me first and he assured me that when I came again he should be very glad to oblige me  I told him with sincerity that every part of the house was equally indifferent to me  "Why Ma'am the truth is Miss Biddy and Polly take no care of any thing else I'm sure  they should be always welcome to my room for I'm never so happy as in obliging the ladiesthat's my character Ma'ambut really the last time they had it every thing was made so greasy and so nasty that upon my word to a man who wishes to have things a little genteel it was quite cruel Now as to you Ma'am its quite another thing for I should not mind if every thing I had was spoilt for the sake of having the pleasure to oblige you and I assure you Ma'am it makes me quite happy that I have a room good enough to receive you"  This elegant speech was followed by many others so much in the same style that to write them would be superfluous and as he did not allow me a moment to speak to any other person the rest of the evening was consumed in a painful attention to this irksome young man who seemed to intend appearing before me to the utmost advantage  Adieu my dear Sir I fear you will be sick of reading about this family yet I must write of them or not of any since I mix with no other Happy shall I be when I quit them all and again return to Berry Hill  LETTER XLIII  Evelina in continuation  June th  THIS morning Mr Smith called  on purpose  he said to offer me a ticket for the next Hampstead assembly I thanked him but desired to be  excused accepting it he would not however be denied nor answered and in a manner both vehement and free pressed and urged his offer till I was wearied to death but when he found me resolute he seemed thunderstruck with amazement and thought proper to desire I would tell him my reasons  Obvious as they must surely have been to any other person they were such as I knew not how to repeat to him and when he found I hesitated he said  "Indeed Ma'am you are too modest I assure you the ticket is quite at your service and I shall be very happy to dance with you so pray don't be so coy"  "Indeed Sir"  returned I  "you are mistaken I never supposed you would offer a ticket without wishing it should be accepted but it would answer no purpose to mention the reasons which make me decline it since they cannot possibly be removed"  This speech seemed very much to mortify him which I could not be concerned at as I did not chuse to be treated by him with so much freedom When he was at last convinced that his application to me was ineffectual he addressed himself to Madame Duval and begged she would interfere in his favour offering at the same time to procure another ticket for herself  "  Ma foi  Sir"  answered she angrily  "you might as well have had the complaisance to ask me before for I assure you I don't approve of no such rudeness however you may keep your tickets to yourself for we don't want none of 'em  This rebuke almost over set him he made many apologies and said that he should certainly have first applied to her but that he had no notion the  young  lady would have refused him and on the contrary had concluded that she would have assisted him to persuade Madame Duval herself  This excuse appeased her and he pleaded his cause so successfully that to my great chagrin he gained it and Madame Duval promised that she would go herself and take me to the Hampstead assembly whenever he pleased  Mr Smith then approaching me with an air of triumph said  "Well Ma'am now I think you can't possibly keep to your denial"  I made no answer and he soon took leave though not till he had so wonderfully gained the favour of Madame Duval that she declared when he was gone he was the prettiest young man she had seen since she came to England  As soon as I could find an opportunity I ventured in the most humble manner to entreat Madame Duval would not insist upon my attending her to this ball and represented to her as well as I was able the impropriety of my accepting any present from a young man so entirely unknown to me but she laughed at my scruples called me a foolish ignorant country girl and said she should make it her business to teach me something of the world  This ball is to be next week I am sure it is not more improper for than unpleasant to me and I will use every possible endeavour to avoid it Perhaps I may apply to Miss Branghton for advice as I believe she will be willing to assist me from disliking equally with myself that I should dance with Mr Smith  July th  O my dear Sir I have been shocked to deathand yet at the same time delighted beyond expression in the hope that I have happily been the instrument of saving a human creature from destruction  This morning Madame Duval said she would invite the Branghton family to return our visit tomorrow and not chusing to rise herselffor she generally spends the morning in bedshe desired me to wait upon them with her message M Du Bois who just then called insisted upon attending me  Mr Branghton was in the shop and told us that his son and daughters were out but desired me to step up stairs as he very soon expected them home This I did leaving M Du Bois below I went into the room where they had dined the day before and by a wonderful chance I happended so to seat myself that I had a view of the stairs and yet could not be seen from them  In about ten minutes time I saw passing by the door with a look perturbed and affrighted the same young man I mentioned in my last letter Not heeding as I suppose how he went in turning the corner of the stairs which are narrow and winding his foot slipped and he fell but almost instantly rising I plainly perceived the end of a pistol which started from his pocket by hitting against the stairs  I was inexpressibly shocked All that I had heard of his misery occurring to my memory made me conclude that he was at that very moment meditating suicide Struck with the dreadful idea all my strength seemed to fail meI sat motionless  I lost all power of actionand grew almost stiff with horror  He moved on slowlyyet I soon lost sight of him I then trembled so violently that my chair actually shook under me till recollecting that it was yet possible to prevent the fatal deed all my faculties seemed to return with the hope of saving him  My first thought was to fly to Mr Branghton but I feared that an instant of time lost might for ever be rued and therefore guided by the impulse of my apprehensions as well as I was able I followed him up stairs stepping very softly and obliged to support myself by the banisters  When I came within a few stairs of the landingplace I stopped for I could then see into his room as he had not yet shut the door  He had put the pistol upon a table and had his hand in his pocket whence in a few moments he took out another He then emptied something on the table from a small leather bag after which taking up both the pistols one in each hand he dropt hastily upon his knees and called out  "O GodForgive me"  In a moment strength and courage seemed lent me as by inspiration I started and rushing precipitately into the room just caught his arm and then overcome by my own fears I fell down at his side breathless and senseless My recovery however was I believe almost instantaneous and then the sight of this unhappy man regarding me with a look of unutterable astonishment mixed with concern presently restored to me my recollection I arose though with difficulty he did the same the pistols as I soon saw were both on the floor  Unwilling to leave them and indeed too weak  to move I leant one hand on the table and then stood perfectly still while he his eyes cast wildly towards me seemed too infinitely amazed to be capable of either speech or action  I believe we were some minutes in this extraordinary situation but as my strength returned I felt myself both ashamed and awkward and making a slight courtesie I moved towards the door Pale and motionless he suffered me to pass without changing his posture or uttering a syllable and indeed  He looked a bloodless image of despair  Pope's Iliad  When I reached the door I turned round I looked fearfully at the pistols and impelled by an emotion I could not repress I hastily stepped back with an intention of carrying them away but their wretched owner perceiving my design and recovering from his astonishment darting suddenly down seized them both himself  Wild with fright and scarce knowing what I did I caught almost involuntarily hold of both his arms and exclaimed  "O Sir have mercy on yourself"  The guilty pistols fell from his hands which disengaging from me he fervently clasped and cried  "Sweet Heaven is this thy angel"  Encouraged by such gentleness I again attempted to take the pistols but with a look half frantic he again prevented me saying  "What would you do"  "Awaken you"  I cried with a courage I now wonder at  "to worthier thoughts and rescue you from perdition"  I then seized the pistols he said not a wordhe made no effort to stop meI glided quick by him and tottered down stairs ere he had recovered from the extremest amazement  The moment I reached again the room I had so fearfully left I threw away the pistols and flinging myself on the first chair gave free vent to the feelings I had most painfully stifled in a violent burst of tears which indeed proved a happy relief to me  In this situation I remained some time but when at length I lifted up my head the first object I saw was the poor man who had occasioned my terror standing as if petrified at the door and gazing at me with eyes of wild wonder  I started from the chair but trembled so excessively that I almost instantly sunk again into it He then though without advancing and in a faltering voice said  "Whoever or whatever you are relieve me I pray you from the suspense under which my soul laboursand tell me if indeed I do not dream"  To this address so singular and so solemn I had not then the presence of mind to frame any answer but as I presently perceived that his eyes turned from me to the pistols and that he seemed to intend regaining them I exerted all my strength and saying  "O for Heaven's sake forbear"  I rose and took them myself  "Do my senses deceive me"  cried he  "do  I  live and do you"  As he spoke he advanced towards me and I still guarding the pistols retreated saying  "No noyou must notmust not have them"  "Whyfor what purpose tell medo you withhold them"  "To give you time to  think  to save you from eternal miseryand I hope to reserve you for mercy and forgiveness"  "Wonderful"  cried he with uplifted hands and eyes  "most wonderful"  For some time he seemed wrapped in deep thought till a sudden noise of tongues below announcing the approach of the Branghtons made him start from his reverie he sprung hastily forwarddropt on one kneecaught hold of my gown which he pressed to his lips and then quick as lightning he rose and flew up stairs to his own room  There was something in the whole of this extraordinary and shocking adventure really too affecting to be borne and so entirely had I spent my spirits and exhausted my courage that before the Branghtons reached me I had sunk on the ground without sense or motion  I believe I must have been a very horrid sight to them on their entrance into the room for to all appearance I seemed to have suffered a violent death either by my own rashness or the cruelty of some murderer as the pistols were fallen close by my side  How soon I recovered I know not but probably I was more indebted to the loudness of their cries than to their assistance for they all concluded that I was dead and for some time did not make any effort to revive me  Scarcely could I recollect  where  or indeed  what  I was ere they poured upon me such a torrent of questions and enquiries that I was almost stunned with their vociferation However as soon and as well as I was able I endeavoured  to satisfy their curiosity by recounting what had happened as clearly as was in my power They all looked aghast at the recital but not being well enough to enter into any discussions I begged to have a chair called and to return instantly home  Before I left them I recommended with great earnestness a vigilant observance of their unhappy lodger and that they would take especial care to keep from him if possible all means of selfdestruction  M Du Bois who seemed extremely concerned at my indisposition walked by the side of the chair and saw me safe to my own apartment  The rashness and the misery of this illfated young man engross all my thoughts If indeed he is bent upon destroying himself all efforts to save him will be fruitless How much do I wish it were in my power to discover the nature of the malady which thus maddens him and to offer or to procure alleviation to his sufferings I am sure my dearest Sir you will be much concerned for this poor man and were you here I doubt not but you would find some method of awakening him from the error which blinds him and of pouring the balm of peace and comfort into his afflicted soul  LETTER XLIV  Evelina in continuation  Holborn  June th  YESTERDAY all the Branghtons dined here Our conversation was almost wholly concerning the adventure of the day before Mr Branghton said that his first thought was instantly to turn his lodger out of doors  "Lest"  continued he  "his killing himself in my house should bring me into any trouble but then I was afraid I should never get the money he owes me whereas if he dies in my house I have a right to all he leaves behind him if he goes off in my debt Indeed I would put him in prisonbut what should I get by that he could not earn any thing there to pay me So I considered about it some time and then I determined to ask him pointblank for my money out of hand And so I did but he told me he'd pay me next week however I gave him to understand that though I was no Scotchman yet I did not like to be overreached any more than he so then he gave me a ring which to my certain knowledge must be worth ten guineas and told me he would not part with it for his life and a good deal more such sort of stuff but that I might keep it till he could pay me"  "It is ten to one Father said young Branghton if he came fairly by it"  "Very likely not"  answered he  "but that will make no great difference for I shall be able to prove my right to it all one"  What principles I could hardly stay in the room  "I'm determined"  said the son  "I'll take some opportunity to affront him soon now I know how poor he is because of the airs he gave himself to me when he first came"  "And pray how was that child"  said Madame Duval  "Why you never knew such a fuss in your life as he made because one day at dinner I only happened to say that I supposed he had never got such a good meal in his life before he came to England there he fell in such a passion as you can't think but for my part I took notice of it for to be sure thinks I he must needs be a gentleman or he'd never go to be so angry about it However he won't put his tricks upon me again in a hurry"  "Well said Miss Polly he's grown quite another creature to what he was and he does n't run away from us nor hide himself nor any thing and he's as civil as can be and he's always in the shop and he saunters about the stairs and he looks at every body who comes in"  "Why you may see what's after plain enough said Mr Branghton he wants to see Miss again"  "Ha ha ha Lord how I should laugh"  said the son  "if he should have fell in Love with Miss"  "I'm sure"  said Miss Branghton  "Miss is welcome but for my part I should be quite ashamed of such a beggarly conquest"  Such was the conversation till tea time when the appearance of Mr Smith gave a new turn to the discourse  Miss Branghton desired me to remark with what a  smart air  he entered the room and asked me if he had not very much a  quality look  "Come"  cried he advancing to us  "you ladies must not sit together wherever I go I always make it a rule to part the ladies"  And then handing Miss Branghton to the next chair he seated himself between us  "Well now ladies I think we sit very well What say you for my part I think it was a very good motion"  "If my Cousin likes it"  said Miss Branghton  "I'm sure I've no objection"  "O"  cried he  "I always study what the ladies likethat's my first thought And indeed it is but natural that you should like best to sit by the gentlemen for what can you find to say to one another"  "Say"  cried young Branghton  "O never you think of that they'll find enough to say I'll be sworn You know the women are never tired of talking"  "Come come Tom"  said Mr Smith  "don't be severe upon the ladies when I'm by you know I always take their part"  Soon after when Miss Branghton offered me some cake this man of gallantry said  "Well if I was that lady I'd never take any thing from a woman"  "Why not Sir"  "Because I should be afraid of being poisoned for being so handsome"  "Who is severe upon the ladies  now  "  said I  "Why really Ma'am it was a slip of the tongue I did not intend to say such a thing but one can't always be on one's guard"  Soon after the conversation turning upon public places young Branghton asked if I had ever been to  George  's at Hampstead  "Indeed I never heard the place mentioned"  "Did n't you Miss"  cried he eagerly  "why then you've a deal of fun to come I'll promise you and I tell you what I'll treat you there some Sunday soon So now Bid and Poll be sure you don't tell Miss about the chairs and all that for I've a mind to surprise her and if I pay I think I've a right to have it my own way"  "George's at Hampstead"  repeated Mr Smith contemptuously  "how came you to think the young Lady would like to go to such a low place as that But pray Ma'am have you ever been to Don Saltero's at Chelsea"  "No Sir"  "NoNonay then I must insist on having the pleasure of conducting you there before long I assure you Ma'am many genteel people go or else I give you my word  I  should not recommend it"  "Pray Cousin"  said Mr Branghton  "have you been to Sadler's Wells yet"  "No Sir"  "No why then you've seen nothing"  "Pray Miss"  said the Son  "how do you like the Tower of London"  "I have never been to it Sir"  "Goodness"  exclaimed he  "not seen the Towerwhy may be you ha'n't been o' top of the Monument neither"  "No indeed I have not"  "Why then you might as well not have come to London for aught I see for you've been no where"  "Pray Miss"  said Polly  "have you been all over Paul's Church yet"  "No Ma'am"  "Well but Ma'am"  said Mr Smith  "how do you like Vauxhall and Marybone"  "I never saw either Sir"  "NoGod bless meyou really surprise mewhy Vauxhall is the first pleasure in lifeI know nothing like itWell Ma'am you must have been with staange people indeed not to have taken you to Vauxhall Why you have seen nothing of London yetHowever we must try if  we  can't make you amends"  In the course of this  catechism  many other places were mentioned of which I have forgotten the names but the looks of surprise and contempt that my repeated negatives incurred were very diverting  "Come"  said Mr Smith after tea  "as this Lady has been with such a queer set of people let's shew her the difference suppose we go somewhere tonightI love to do things with spiritCome Ladies where shall we go For my part I should like Foote'sbut the Ladies must chuse I never speak myself"  "Well Mr Smith is always in such spirits"  said Miss Branghton  "Why yes Ma'am yes thank G pretty good spiritsI have not yet the cares of the world upon meI am not  married  ha ha hayou'll excuse me Ladiesbut I can't help laughing"  No objection being made to my great relief we all proceeded to the little theatre in the Haymarket where I was extremely entertained by the performance of the Minor and the Commissary  They all returned hither to supper  LETTER XLV  Evelina in continuation  June th  YESTERDAY morning Madame Duval again sent me to Mr Branghton's attended by M Du Bois to make some party for the evening because she had had the vapours the preceding day from staying at home  As I entered the shop I perceived the unfortunate North Briton seated in a corner with a book in his hand He cast his melancholy eyes up as we came in and I believe immediately recollected my face for he started and changed colour I delivered Madame Duval's message to Mr Branghton who told me I should find Polly up stairs but that the others were gone out  Up stairs therefore I went and seated on a window with Mr Brown at her side sat Miss Polly I felt a little awkward at disturbing them and much more so at their behaviour afterwards for as soon as the common enquiries were over Mr Brown grew so fond and so foolish that I was extremely disgusted Polly all the time only rebuked him with  "La now Mr Brown do be quiet can't youyou should not behave so before companyWhy now what will Miss think of me"  while her looks plainly shewed not merely the pleasure but the pride which she took in his caresses  I did not by any means think it necessary to punish myself by witnessing their tenderness and  therefore telling them I would see if Miss Branghton was returned home I soon left them and again descended into the shop  "So Miss you've come again"  said Mr Branghton  "what I suppose you've a mind to sit a little in the shop and see how the world goes hay Miss"  I made no answer and M Du Bois instantly brought me a chair  The unhappy stranger who had risen at my entrance again seated himself and though his head leant towards his book I could not help observing that his eyes were most intently and earnestly turned towards me  M Du Bois as well as his broken English would allow him endeavoured to entertain us till the return of Miss Branghton and her brother  "Lord how tired I am"  cried the former  "I have not a foot to stand upon"  And then without any ceremony she flung herself into the chair from which I had risen to receive her  "You tired"  said the brother  "why then what I must be that have walked twice as far"  And with equal politeness he paid the same compliment to M Du Bois which his sister had done to me  Two chairs and three stools compleated the furniture of the shop and Mr Branghton who chose to keep his own seat himself desired M Du Bois to take another and then seeing that I was without any called out to the stranger  "Come Mr Macartney lend us your stool"  Shocked at their rudeness I declined the offer and approaching Miss Branghton said  "If you will be so good as to make room for me on your  chair there will be no occasion to disturb that gentleman"  "Lord what signifies that"  cried the brother  "he has had his share of sitting I'll be sworn"  "And if he has not"  said the sister  he has a chair up stairs and the shop is our own I hope"  This grossness so much disgusted me that I took the stool and carrying it back to Mr Macartney myself I returned him thanks as civilly as I could for his politeness but said that I had rather stand  He looked at me as if unaccustomed to such attention bowed very respectfully but neither spoke nor yet made use of it  I soon found that I was an object of derision to all present except M Du Bois and therefore I begged Mr Branghton would give me an answer for Madame Duval as I was in haste to return  "Well then TomBiddywhere have you a mind to go tonight your Aunt and Miss want to be abroad and amongst them"  "Why then Papa"  said Miss Branghton  "we'll go to Don Saltero's Mr Smith likes that place so may be he'll go along with us"  "No no"  said the son  "I'm for WhiteConduit House so let's go there"  "WhiteConduit House indeed"  cried his sister  "no Tom that I won't"  "Why then let it alone nobody wants your companywe shall do as well without you I'll be sworn and better too"  "I'll tell you what Tom if you don't hold your tongue I'll make you repent itthat I assure you"  Just then Mr Smith came into the shop which he seemed to intend passing through but when he saw me he stopped and began a most courteous  enquiry after my health protesting that had he known I was there he should have come down sooner  "But bless me Ma'am"  added he  "what is the reason you stand"  and then he flew to bring me the seat from which I had just parted  "Mr Smith you are come in very good time"  said Mr Branghton  "to end a dispute between my son and daughter about where they shall all go tonight"  "O fie Tomdispute with a lady"  cried Mr Smith  "Now as for me I'm for where you will provided this young Lady is of the partyone place is the same as another to me so that it be but agreeable to the ladiesI would go any where with you Ma'am"  to me  "unless indeed it were to  church  ha ha hayou'll excuse me Ma'am but really I never could conquer my fear of a parsonha ha hareally ladies I beg your pardon for being so rude but I can't help laughing for my life"  "I was just saying Mr Smith"  said Miss Branghton  "that I should like to go to Don Saltero'snow pray where should  you  like to go"  "Why really Miss Biddy you know I always let the ladies decide I never fix any thing myself but I should suppose it would be rather hot at the coffeehousehowever pray Ladies settle it among yourselvesI'm agreeable to whatever you chuse"  It was easy for me to discover that this man with all his parade of  conformity  objects to every thing that is not proposed by himself but he is so much admired by this family for his  gentility  that he thinks himself a complete fine gentleman  "Come"  said Mr Branghton  "the best way will be to put it to the vote and then every body  will speak their minds Biddy call Poll down stairs We'll start fair"  "Lord Papa"  said Miss Branghton  "why can't you as well send Tomyou're always sending me of the errands"  A dispute then ensued but Miss Branghton was obliged to yield  When Mr Brown and Miss Polly made their appearance the latter uttered many complaints of having been called saying she did not want to come and was very well where she was  "Now Ladies your votes"  cried Mr Smith  "and so Ma'am"  to me  "we'll begin with you What place shall you like best"  and then in a whisper he added  "I assure you I shall say the same as you do whether I like it or not"  I said that as I was ignorant what choice was in my power I must beg to hear their decisions first This was reluctantly assented to and then Miss Branghton voted for Saltero's Coffeehouse her sister for a party to  Mother Red Cap's  the brother for WhiteConduit House Mr Brown for Bagnigge Wells Mr Branghton for Sadler's Wells and Mr Smith for Vauxhall  "Well now Ma'am"  said Mr Smith  "we have all spoken and so you must give the casting vote Come what will you fix upon"  "Sir"  answered I  "I was to speak  last  "  "Well so you will"  said Miss Branghton  "for we've all spoke first"  "Pardon me"  returned I  "the voting has not yet been quite general"  And I looked towards Mr Macartney to whom I wished extremely to shew that I was not of the same brutal nature with those by whom he was treated so grossly  "Why pray"  said Mr Branghton  "who have we left out would you have the cats and dogs vote"  "No Sir"  cried I with some spirit  "I would have  that gentleman  voteif indeed he is not superior to joining our party"  They all looked at me as if they doubted whether or not they had heard me right but in a few moments their surprise gave way to a rude burst of laughter  Very much displeased I told M Du Bois that if he was not ready to go I would have a coach called for myself  O yes he said he was always ready to attend me  Mr Smith then advancing attempted to take my hand and begged me not to leave them till I had settled the evening's plan  "I have nothing Sir"  said I  "to do with it as it is my intention to stay at home and therefore Mr Branghton will be so good as to send Madame Duval word what place is fixed upon when it is convenient to him"  And then making a slight courtesie I left them  How much does my disgust for these people encrease my pity for poor Mr Macartney I will not see them when I can avoid so doing but I am determined to take every opportunity in my power to shew civility to this unhappy man whose misfortunes with this family only render him an object of scorn I was however very well pleased with M Du Bois who far from joining in their mirth expressed himself extremely shocked at their illbreeding  We had not walked ten yards ere we were followed by Mr Smith who came to make excuses and to assure me they were  only joking  and hoped  I took nothing ill for if I did he would make a quarrel of it himself with the Branghtons rather than I should receive any offence  I begged him not to take any trouble about so immaterial an affair and assured him I should not myself He was so officious that he would not be prevailed upon to return home till he had walked with us to Mr Dawkin's  Madame Duval was very much displeased that I brought her so little satisfaction WhiteConduit House was at last fixed upon and notwithstanding my great dislike of such parties and such places I was obliged to accompany them  Very disagreeable and much according to my expectations the evening proved There were many people all smart and gaudy and so pert and lowbred that I could hardly endure being amongst them but the party to which unfortunately I belonged seemed all  at home  LETTER XLVI  Evelina in continuation  Holburn  June th  YESTERDAY Mr Smith carried his point of making a party for Vauxhall consisting of Madame Duval M Du Bois all the Branghtons Mr Brown himselfand mefor I find all endeavours vain to escape any thing which these people desire I should not  There were twenty disputes previous to our setting out first as to the  time  of our going Mr Branghton his son and young Brown were for  six o'clock and all the ladies and Mr Smith were for eightthe latter however conquered  Then as to the  way  we should go some were for a boat others for a coach and Mr Branghton himself was for walking but the boat at length was decided upon Indeed this was the only part of the expedition that was agreeable to me for the Thames was delightfully pleasant  The Garden is very pretty but too formal I should have been better pleased had it consisted less of strait walks where  Grove nods at grove each alley has its brother  the trees the numerous lights and the company in the circle around the orchestra make a most brilliant and gay appearance and had I been with a party less disagreeable to me I should have thought it a place formed for animation and pleasure There was a concert in the course of which the hautbois concerto was so charmingly played that I could have thought myself upon enchanted ground had I had spirits more gentle to associate with The hautboy in the open air is heavenly  Mr Smith endeavoured to attach himself to me with such officious assiduity and impertinent freedom that he quite sickened me Indeed M Du Bois was the only man of the party to whom voluntarily I ever addressed myself He is civil and respectful and I have found nobody else so since I left Howard Grove His English is very bad but I prefer it to speaking French myself which I dare not venture to do I converse with him frequently both to disengage myself from others and to oblige  Madame Duval who is always pleased when he is attended to  As we were walking about the orchestra I heard a bell ring and in a moment Mr Smyth flying up to me caught my hand and with a motion too quick to be resisted ran away with me many yards before I had breath to ask his meaning tho' I struggled as well as I could to get from him At last however I insisted upon stopping  "Stopping Ma'am"  cried he  "why we must run on or we shall lose the cascade  And then again he hurried me away mixing with a crowd of people all running with so much velocity that I could not imagine what had raised such an alarm We were soon followed by the rest of the party and my surprise and ignorance proved a source of diversion to them all that was not exhausted the whole evening Young Branghton in particular laughed till he could hardly stand  The scene of the cascade I thought extremely pretty and the general effect striking and lively  But this was not the only surprise which was to divert them at my expence for they led me about the garden purposely to enjoy my first sight of various other deceptions  About ten o'clock Mr Smith having chosen a  box  in a very conspicuous place we all went to supper Much fault was found with every thing that was ordered though not a morsel of any thing was left and the dearness of the provisions with conjectures upon what profit was made by them supplied discourse during the whole meal  When wine and cyder were brought Mr Smith said  "Now let's enjoy ourselves now is the  time or never Well Ma'am and how do you like Vauxhall"  "Like it"  cried young Branghton  "why how can she help liking it she has never seen such a place before that I'll answer for"  "For my part"  said Miss Branghton  I like it because it is not vulgar"  "This must have been a fine treat for you Miss"  said Mr Branghton  "why I suppose you was never so happy in all your life before"  I endeavoured to express my satisfaction with some pleasure yet I believe they were much amazed at my coldness  "Miss ought to stay in town till the last night"  said young Branghton  "and then it's my belief she'd say something to it Why Lord it's the best night of any there's always a riotand there the folks run aboutand then there's such squealing and squallingand there all the lamps are brokeand the women run skimper scamperI declare I would not take five guineas to miss the last night"  I was very glad when they all grew tired of sitting and called for the waiter to pay the bill The Miss Branghtons said they would walk on while the gentlemen settled the account and asked me to accompany them which however I declined  "You girls may do as you please"  said Madame Duval  "but as to me I promise you I sha'n't go no where without the gentlemen"  "No more I suppose will my  Cousin  "  said Miss Branghton looking reproachfully towards Mr Smith  This reflection which I feared would slatter his vanity made me most unfortunately request  Madame Duval's permission to attend them She granted it and away we went having promised to meet in the room  To the room therefore I would immediately have gone but the sisters agreed that they would first have a  little pleasure  and they tittered and talked so loud that they attracted universal notice  "Lord Polly"  said the eldest  "suppose we were to take a turn in the dark walks"  "Ay do"  answered she  "and then we'll hide ourselves and then Mr Brown will think we are lost"  I remonstrated very warmly against this plan telling them that it would endanger our missing the rest of the party all the evening  "O dear"  cried Miss Branghton  "I thought how uneasy Miss would be without a beau"  This impertinence I did not think worth answering and quite by compulsion I followed them down a long alley in which there was hardly any light  By the time we came near the end a large party of gentlemen apparently very riotous and who were hallowing leaning on one another and laughing immoderately seemed to rush suddenly from behind some trees and meeting us face to face put their arms at their sides and formed a kind of circle that first stopped our proceeding and then our retreating for we were presently entirely inclosed The Miss Branghtons screamed aloud and I was frightened exceedingly our screams were answered with bursts of laughter and for some minutes we were kept prisoners till at last one of them rudely seizing hold of me said I was a pretty little creature  Terrified to death I struggled with such vehemence to disengage myself from him that I succeeded in spite of his efforts to detain me and immediately and with a swiftness which fear only could have given me I flew rather than ran up the walk hoping to secure my safety by return+ing to the lights and company we had so foolishly left but before I could possibly accomplish my purpose I was met by another party of men one of whom placed himself so directly in my way calling out  "Whither so fast my love"  that I could only have proceeded by running into his arms  In a moment both my hands by different persons were caught hold of and one of them in a most familiar manner desired to accompany me in a race when I ran next while the rest of the party stood still and laughed  I was almost distracted with terror and so breathless with running that I could not speak till another advancing said I was as handsome as an angel and desired to be of the party I then just articulated  "For Heaven's sake Gentlemen let me pass"  Another then rushing suddenly forward exclaimed  "Heaven and earth what voice is that"  "The voice of the prettiest little actress I have seen this age"  answered one of my persecutors  "Nonono"  I  panted  out  "I am no actresspray let me gopray let me pass"  "By all that's sacred"  cried the same voice which I then knew for Sir Clement Willoughby's  "'tis herself"  "Sir Clement Willoughby"  cried I  "O Sir assistassist meor I shall die with terror"  "Gentlemen"  cried he disengaging them all from me in an instant  "pray leave this lady to me"  Loud laughs proceeded from every mouth and two or three said  "  Willoughby has all the luck  "  But one of them in a passionate manner vowed he would not give me up for that he had the first right to me and would support it  "You are mistaken"  said Sir Clement  "this lady isI will explain myself to you another time but I assure you you are all mistaken"  And then taking my willing hand he led me off amidst the loud acclamations laughter and gross merriment of his impertinent companions  As soon as we had escaped from them Sir Clement with a voice of surprise exclaimed  "My dearest creature what wonder what strange revolution has brought you to such a spot as this"  Ashamed of my situation and extremely mortified to be thus recognized by him I was for some time silent and when he repeated his question only stammered out  "I haveI hardly know howlost myself from my party"  He caught my hand and eagerly pressing it in a passionate voice said  "O that I had sooner met with thee"  Surprised at a freedom so unexpected I angrily broke from him saying  "Is this the protection you give me Sir Clement"  And then I saw what the perturbation of my mind had prevented my sooner noticing that he had led me though I know not how into another of the dark alleys instead of the place whither I meant to go  "Good God"  I cried  "where am Iwhat way are you going"  "Where"  answered he  "we shall be least observed"  Astonished at this speech I stopped short and declared I would go no further  "And why not my angel"  again endeavouring to take my hand  My heart beat with resentment I pushed him away from me with all my strength and demanded how he dared treat me with such insolence  "Insolence"  repeated he  "Yes Sir Clement  insolence  from you who know me I had a claim for protectionnot to such treatment as this"  "By Heaven"  cried he with warmth  "you distract mewhy tell mewhy do I see you hereIs this a place for Miss Anvillethese dark walksno partyno companionby all that's good I can scarce believe my senses"  Extremely offended at this speech I turned angrily from him and not deigning to make any answer walked on towards that part of the garden whence I perceived the lights and company  He followed me but we were both some time silent  "So you will not explain to me your situation"  said he at length  "No Sir"  answered I disdainfully  "Nor yetsuffer me to make my own interpretation"  I could not bear this strange manner of speaking it made my very soul shudderand I burst into tears  He flew to me and actually flung himself at my feet as if regardless who might see him saying  "O Miss Anvilleloveliest of womenforgive mymyI beseech you forgive meif I have  offendedif I have hurt you I could kill myself at the thought"  "No matter Sir no matter"  cried I  "if I can but find my friendsI will never speak tonever see you again"  "Good Godgood Heavenmy dearest life what is it I have doneWhat is it I have said"  "You best know Sir  what  and  why  but don't hold me herelet me be gone and do  you  "  "Not till you forgive meI cannot part with you in anger"  "For shame for shame Sir"  cried I indignantly  "do you suppose I am to be thus compelleddo you take advantage of the absence of my friends to affront me"  "No Madam"  cried he rising  "I would sooner forfeit my life than act so mean a part But you have flung me into amazement unspeakable and you will not condescend to listen to my request of giving me some explanation"  "The manner Sir"  said I  "in which you spoke that request made and will make me scorn to answer it"  "ScornI will own to you I expected not such displeasure from Miss Anville"  "Perhaps Sir if you had you would less voluntarily have merited it"  "My dearest life surely it must be known to you that the man does not breathe who adores you so passionately so fervently so tenderly as I dowhy then will you delight in perplexing mein keeping me in suspencein torturing me with doubt"  "I Sir delight in perplexing youYou are much mistakenYour suspence your doubts your perplexitiesare of your own creating and  believe me Sir they may  offend  but they can never  delight  mebut as you have yourself raised you must yourself satisfy them"  "Good Godthat such haughtiness and such sweetness can inhabit the same mansion"  I made no answer but quickening my pace I walked on silently and sullenly till this most impetuous of men snatching my hand which he grasped with violence besought me to forgive him with such earnestness of supplication that merely to escape his importunities I was forced to speak and in some measure to grant the pardon he requested though it was accorded with a very ill grace but indeed I knew not how to resist the humility of his entreaties yet never shall I recollect the occasion he gave me of displeasure without feeling it renewed  We now soon arrived in the midst of the general crowd and my own safety being then insured I grew extremely uneasy for the Miss Branghtons whose danger however imprudently incurred by their own folly I too well knew how to tremble for To this consideration all my pride of heart yielded and I determined to seek my party with the utmost speed though not without a sigh did I recollect the fruitless attempt I had made after the opera of concealing from this man my unfortunate connections which I was now obliged to make known  I hastened therefore to the room with a view of sending young Branghton to the aid of his sisters In a very short time I perceived Madame Duval and the rest looking at one of the paintings I must own to you honestly my dear Sir that an involuntary repugnance seized me at presenting such a set to Sir Clementhe who had been used to see  me in parties so differentMy pace slackened as I approached thembut they presently perceived me  "  Ah Mademoiselle  "  cried M Du Bois  "  Que je suis charme de vous voir  "  "Pray Miss"  cried Mr Brown  "where's Miss Polly"  "Why Miss you've been a long while gone"  said Mr Branghton  "we thought you'd been lost But what have you done with your cousins"  I hesitatedfor Sir Clement regarded me with a look of wonder  "  Pardie  "  cried Madame Duval  "I sha'n't let you leave me again in a hurry Why here we've been in such a frightand all the while I suppose you've been thinking nothing about the matter"  "Well"  said young Branghton  "as long as Miss is come back I don't mind for as to Bid and Poll they can take care of themselves But the best joke is Mr Smith is gone all about a looking for you"  These speeches were made almost all in a breath but when at last they waited for an answer I told them that in walking up one of the long alleys we had been frightened and separated  "The long alleys"  repeated Mr Branghton  "and pray what had you to do in the long alleys why to be sure you must all of you have had a mind to be affronted"  This speech was not more impertinent to me than surprising to Sir Clement who regarded all the party with evident astonishment However I told young Branghton that no time ought to be lost for that his sisters might require his immediate protection  "But how will they get it"  cried this brutal brother  "if they've a mind to behave in such a  manner as that they ought to protect themselves and so they may for me"  "Well"  said the simple Mr Brown  "whether you go or no I think I may as well see after Miss Polly"  The father then interfering insisted that his son should accompany him and away they went  It was now that Madame Duval first perceived Sir Clement to whom turning with a look of great displeasure she angrily said  "  Ma foi  so you are comed here of all the people in the worldI wonder child you would let such asuch a  person  as that keep company with you"  "I am very sorry Madam"  said Sir Clement in a tone of surprise  "if I have been so unfortunate as to offend you but I believe you will not regret the honour I now have of attending Miss Anville when you hear that I have been so happy as to do her some service"  Just as Madame Duval with her usual  Ma foi  was beginning to reply the attention of Sir Clement was wholly drawn from her by the appearance of Mr Smith who suddenly coming behind me and freely putting his hands on my shoulders cried  "O ho my little runaway have I found you at last I have been scampering all over the gardens for you for I was determined to find you if you were above groundBut how could you be so cruel as to leave us"  I turned round to him and looked with a degree of contempt that I hoped would have quieted him but he had not the sense to understand me and attempting to take my hand he added  "Such a demure looking lady as you are who'd have thought of your leading one such a danceCome now  don't be so coyonly think what a trouble I have had in running after you"  "The trouble Sir"  said I  "was of your own choicenot mine"  And I walked round to the other side of Madame Duval  Perhaps I was too proudbut I could not endure that Sir Clement whose eyes followed him with looks of the most surprized curiosity should witness his unwelcome familiarity  Upon my removal he came up to me and in a low voice said  "You are not then with the Mirvans"  "No Sir"  "And praymay I askhave you left them long  "No Sir"  "How unfortunate I ambut yesterday I sent to acquaint the Captain I should reach the Grove by tomorrow noon However I shall get away as fast as possible Shall you be long in town"  "I believe not Sir"  And then when you leave itwhich waywill you allow me to ask which way you shall travel"  "IndeedI don't know"  "Not knowBut do you return to the Mirvans any more"  "II can't tell Sir"  And then I addressed myself to Madame Duval with such a pretended earnestness that he was obliged to be silent  As he cannot but observe the great change in my situation which he knows not how to account for there is something in all these questions and this unrestrained curiosity that I did not expect from a man who when he pleases can be so wellbred as Sir Clement Willoughby He seems disposed  to think that the alteration in my companions authorizes an alteration in his manners It is true he has always treated me with uncommon freedom but never before with so disrespectful an abruptness This observation which he has given me cause to make of his  changing with the tide  has sunk him more in my opinion than any other part of his conduct  Yet I could almost have laughed when I looked at Mr Smith who no sooner saw me addressed by Sir Clement than retreating aloof from the company he seemed to lose at once all his happy selfsufficiency and conceit looking now at the baronet now at himself surveying with sorrowful eyes his dress struck with his air his gestures his easy gaiety he gazed at him with envious admiration and seemed himself with conscious inferiority to shrink into nothing  Soon after Mr Brown running up to us called out  "La what i'n't Miss Polly come yet"  "Come"  said Mr Branghton  "why I thought you went to fetch her yourself did n't you"  "Yes but I could n't find heryet I dare say I've been over half the garden"  "Half but why did not you go over it all"  "Why so I will but only I thought I'd just come and see if she was here first"  "But where's Tom"  "Why I don't know for he would not stay with me all as ever I could say for we met some young gentlemen of his acquaintance and so he bid me go and look by myself for he said says he I can divert myself better another way says he"  This account being given away again went this silly young man and Mr Branghton extremely  incensed said he would go and see after them himself  "So now"  cried Madame Duval  "he's gone too why at this rate we shall have to wait for one or other of them all night"  Observing that Sir Clement seemed disposed to renew his enquiries I turned towards one of the paintings and pretending to be very much occupied in looking after it asked M Du Bois some questions concerning the figures  "O  Mon Dieu  "  cried Madame Duval  "don't ask him your best way is to ask Mr Smith for he's been here the oftenest Come Mr Smith I dare say you can tell us all about them"  "Why yes Ma'am"  said Mr Smith who brightening up at this application advanced towards us with an air of assumed importance which however sat very uneasily upon him and begged to know what he should explain first  "For I have attended"  said he  "to all these paintings and know every thing in them perfectly well for I am rather fond of pictures Ma'am and really I must say I think a picture is aa veryis really a veryis something very pretty"  "So do I too"  said Madame Duval  "but pray now Sir tell us who that is meant for"  pointing to a figure of Neptune  "Thatwhy that Ma'am isLord bless me I can't think how I come to be so stupid but really I have forgot his nameand yet I know it as well as my own toohowever he's a  general  Ma'am they are all generals"  I saw Sir Clement bite his lips and indeed so did I mine  "Well"  said Madame Duval  "it's the oddest dress for a general ever I see"  "He seems so capital a figure"  said Sir Clement to Mr Smith  "that I imagine he must be  generalissimo  of the whole army"  "Yes Sir yes"  answered Mr Smith respectfully bowing and highly delighted at being thus referred to  "you are perfectly rightbut I cannot for my life think of his nameperhaps Sir you may remember it"  "No really"  replied Sir Clement  "my acquaintance among the generals is not so extensive"  The ironical tone of voice in which Sir Clement spoke entirely disconcerted Mr Smith who again retiring to an humble distance seemed sensibly mortified at the failure of his attempt to recover his consequence  Soon after Mr Branghton returned with his youngest daughter whom he had rescued from a party of insolent young men but he had not yet been able to find the eldest Miss Polly was really frightened and declared she would never go into the dark walks again Her father leaving her with us went in quest of her sister  While she was relating her adventures to which nobody listened more attentively than Sir Clement we saw Mr Brown enter the room  "O la"  cried Miss Polly  "let me hide myself and don't tell him I'm come"  She then placed herself behind Madame Duval in such a manner that she could not be seen  "So Miss Polly is not come yet"  said the simple swain  "well I can't think where she can be I've been a looking and looking and looking all about and I can't find her all I can do"  "Well but Mr Brown"  said Mr Smith  "sha'n't you go and look for the lady again"  "Yes Sir"  said he sitting down  "but I must rest me a little bit first You can't think how tired I am"  "O fie Mr Brown fie"  cried Mr Smith winking at us  "tired of looking for a lady Go go for shame"  "So I will Sir presently but you'd be tired too if you'd walked so far besides I think she's gone out of the garden or else I must have seen something or other of her"  A  he he he  of the tittering Polly now betrayed her and so ended this ingenious little artifice  At last appeared Mr Branghton and Miss Biddy who with a face of mixed anger and confusion addressing herself to me said  "So Miss so you ran away from me Well see if I don't do as much by you some day or other But I thought how it would be you'd no mind to leave the  gentlemen  though you'd run away from  me  "  I was so much surprised at this attack that I could not answer her for very amazement and she proceeded to tell us how ill she had been used and that two young men had been making her walk up and down the dark walks by absolute force and as fast as ever they could tear her along and many other particulars which I will not tire you with relating In conclusion looking at Mr Smith she said  "But to be sure thought I at least all the company will be looking for me so I little expected to find you all here talking as comfortably as ever you can However I know I may thank my cousin for it"  "If you mean  me  Madam"  said I very much shocked  "I am quite ignorant in what manner I can have been accessary to your distress"  "Why by running away so If you'd stayed with us I'll answer for it Mr Smith and M Du Bois would have come to look for us but I suppose they could not leave your ladyship"  The folly and unreasonableness of this speech would admit of no answer But what a scene was this for Sir Clement his surprise was evident and I must acknowledge my confusion was equally great  We had now to wait for young Branghton who did not appear for some time and during this interval it was with difficulty that I avoided Sir Clement who was on the rack of curiosity and dying to speak to me  When at last the hopeful youth returned a long and frightful quarrel ensued between him and his father in which his sisters occasionally joined concerning his neglect and he defended himself only by a brutal mirth which he indulged at their expence  Every one now seemed inclined to departwhen as usual a dispute arose upon the  way  of our going whether in a coach or a boat After much debating it was determined that we should make two parties one by the water and the other by land for Madame Duval declared she would not upon any account go into a boat at night  Sir Clement then said that if she had no carriage in waiting he should be happy to see her and me safe home as his was in readiness  Fury started into her eyes and passion inflamed every feature as she answered  "  Pardie  noyou may take care of yourself if you please but as to me I promise you I sha'n't trust myself with no such person"  He pretended not to comprehend her meaning yet to wave a discussion acquiesced in her refusal The coach party fixed upon consisted of Madame Duval M Du Bois Miss Branghton and myself  I now began to rejoice in private that at least our lodgings would be neither seen nor known by Sir Clement We soon met with an hackneycoach into which he handed me and then took leave  Madame Duval having already given the coachman her direction he mounted the box and we were just driving off when Sir Clement exclaimed  "By Heaven this is the very coach I had in waiting for myself"  "This coach your honour"  said the man  "no that it i'nt"  Sir Clement however swore that it was and presently the man begging his pardon said he had really forgotten that he was engaged  I have no doubt but that this scheme occurred to him at the moment and that he made some sign to the coachman which induced him to support it for there is not the least probability that the accident really happened as it is most likely his own chariot was in waiting  The man then opened the coachdoor and Sir Clement advancing to it said  "I don't believe there is another carriage to be had or I would not incommode you but as it may be disagreeable to you to wait here any longer I beg you will not get out for you shall be set down before I am carried home if you will be so good as to make a little room"  And so saying in he jumpt and seated himself between M Du Bois and me while our astonishment  at the whole transaction was too great for speech He then ordered the coachman to drive on according to the directions he had already received  For the first ten minutes no one uttered a word and then Madame Duval no longer able to contain herself exclaimed  "  Ma foi  if this is n't one of the impudentest things ever I see"  Sir Clement regardless of this rebuke attended only to me however I answered nothing he said when I could possibly avoid so doing Miss Branghton made several attempts to attract his notice but in vain for he would not take the trouble of paying her any regard  Madame Duval during the rest of the ride addressed herself to M Du Bois in French and in that language exclaimed with great vehemence against boldness and assurance  I was extremely glad when I thought our journey must be nearly at an end for my situation was very uneasy to me as Sir Clement perpetually endeavoured to take my hand I looked out of the coachwindow to see if we were near home Sir Clement stooping over me did the same and then in a voice of infinite wonder called out  "Where the dl is the man driving towhy we are in Broad St Giles's"  "O he's very right"  cried Madame Duval  "so never trouble your head about that for I shan't go by no directions of yours I promise you"  When at last we stopped at  an Hosier's  in  High Holborn  Sir Clement said nothing but his  eyes  I saw were very busily employed in viewing the place and the situation of the house The coach he insisted upon settling himself as he said it belonged to him and then he took leave M Du  Bois walked home with Miss Branghton and Madame Duval and I retired to our apartments  How disagreeable an evening's adventure not one of the party seemed satisfied except Sir Clement who was in high spirits but Madame Duval was enraged at meeting with him Mr Branghton angry with his children the frolick of the Miss Branghtons had exceeded their plan and ended in their own distress their brother was provoked that there had been no riot Mr Brown was tired and Mr Smith mortified As to myself I must acknowledge nothing could be more disagreeable to me than being seen by Sir Clement Willoughby with a party at once so vulgar in themselves and so familiar to me  And you too my dear Sir will I know be sorry that I have met him however there is no apprehension of his visiting here as Madame Duval is far too angry to admit him  END OF VOL I
