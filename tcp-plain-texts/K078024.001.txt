ST JOHN'S SQUARE CLERKENWELL FOR THE AUTHOR And for F and C RIVINGTON N  o  ST PAUL'S CHURCH YARD  MDCCCII  TO T MARSHAM AND A M'LEAY ESQRS TREASURER AND SECRETARY OF THE LINNAEAN SOCIETY  MY DEAR SIRS  IF I were not anxious to acknowledge you amongst the number of those whose useful infor∣mation has in various instances tended to improve this Work motives of esteem would alone induce me to in∣scribe it to you The reflection that for ten years past it has been sanctioned with no inconsiderable share of public approbation will not allow me to believe it un∣worthy of your attention and its conclusion affords me the best opportunity to testify the favour as well as the respect with which  I remain Most sincerely yours E DONOVAN  ADVERTISEMENT  AT the conclusion of a Work which has been pub∣lished in a progressive manner and either in the form of Monthly Numbers or Annual Volumes has already passed the ordeal of public criticism the Author can have little to advance in favour of the design or the manner in which it has been executed His chief object was to illustrate the science of Entomology on a more extensive scale than had been previously attempted in this Country and he trusts upon the whole his endeavours in this respect have not been fruitless  As a general History of the Insect Productions of Great Britain it is presumed this Work will be found sufficiently copious and instructive for though the Author has pur∣posely avoided entering too deeply amongst the minutiae of the Insect race he has been careful to include what∣ever is interesting The selection of Papiliones or Butter∣flies is extremely ample as well as that of the Sphinges  or Hawk Moths none of the larger kinds of Phalaeuae or Moth tribes have been overlooked and the number of those of an inferior size that are extremely rare or particularly beautiful are altogether considerable Those are chiefly alluded to because general observers are more immediately interested with the uncommon elegance of the Lepidopterous tribes than any others In general however the reader will meet with some information in every department as nothing material in any cabinet to which he has access has been omitted  The arrangement of the subjects is for the most part conformable to the system of Linnaeus with occasional reference to the writings of Fabricius This is designed to assist the labours of the practical Entomologist and by combining novelty with beauty and scientific information may induce many other attentive observers of nature to pursue this pleasing and interesting study  The Author cannot but feel some degree of satisfaction in having at least fulfilled the chief object of his first design and after the labour of ten years completed a Work perhaps the most extensive that may ever appear in this form on the subject of British Entomology but this consideration will not permit him to entirely abandon his favourite pursuit his attention will be still directed to a science in which the past indulgence of a liberal pub∣lic  have induced him to believe he may still be useful and though he cannot consistently with the conditions of this undertaking extend it further at this time should a sufficient number of new and valuable species occur he will certainly be tempted to transgress and make some addition to the present selection  ALPHABETICAL TABLE OF CONTENTS

feathers  III AMPHIBIA Lungs arbitrary  IV PISCES Fishes breath by gills not arbitrarily  V INSECTA Insects two antennae or feelers  Those feelers are the two horns that are affixed to the head    VI VERMES No head  Insects therefore compose the fifth Class in the System and are di∣vided into seven Orders  Order I COLEOPTERA Wings two covered by two shells divided by a longitudinal future  II HEMIPTERA Shells or covers of the wings somewhat soft and incumbent on each other  III LEPIDOPTERA Wings four imbricated with minute scales  IV NEUROPTERA Wings four naked transparent reticu∣lated with veins or nerves Tail without sting  V HYMENOPTERA Wings four Membraneous Tail of the female armed with a sting  VI DIPTERA Wings two  VII APTERA No wings  TRANSFORMATIONS OF INSECTS  Many of our readers are no doubt acquainted with the singular transformations Insects undergo but we trust those will pardon a digression which may be useful to those who have not that knowledge and without premising farther we proceed to inform them that Insects in general undergo a material change in their form at stated periods of their lives there are some though few which burst forth from the egg perfectly formed as  Spiders  c but the greater part exist in four several states the first that of the egg whence the Larva or Caterpillar is produced it is at first very minute but in this state it feeds some kinds on one or two plants only others promiscuously on many they therefore continue to increase in size moulting several times the outer skin until the destined period of their dormant state approaches they then spin a web more or less strong according to the species and are converted into the aurelia or chrysalis and lastly they burst forth in due season perfectly formed It is under this form they propagate a future race and themselves perish as they rarely survive the inclemencies of the winter  The antient naturalists held suppositions very imperfect and erro∣neous relative to those transformations but  Malpighi  and  Swammer∣dam  proved by many accurate examinations clearly that those changes were not suddenly effected but gradual and that under the form of the Caterpillar they could distinguish the future changes the Insect would undergo  PLATE I PHALAENA PAVONIA EMPEROR MOTH LEPIDOPTERA  Insects of the LEPIDOPTERA ORDER are divided into three  Genera  PAPILIO SPHINX and PHALAENA  Butterflies Hawk Moths  and  Moths  The characters of the two former hereafter those of the Phalaena are  GENERIC CHARACTER  The antennae setaceous decreasing in size from the base to the apex The wings when at rest are generally contracted They fly in the night  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Antennae feathered No trunk Wings expanded horizontal rounded entire with a large eye in the center of each the first redbrown waved the second orange The antennae of the male are broader and the wings of the female larger waved with black and white and bordered with yellow Caterpillar green or yellow spinous on thorns and brambles Length of the moth one inch  Berken Out  The conformity and likeness which prevails between the male and female throughout the greater part of the animal system cannot how∣ever in Insects be implicitly depended on the difference in many is such as even to mislead some very accurate Entomologists the illustrious Linnaeus not excepted In this species it is not so great as  in many but such as entitles the female to a figure in a future plate Our figure is of the male  Albin  Plate    Subject  has given a figure of the male and female on the same plate and describes a male to have changed to the aurelia state as in our plate represented  July  and  March  fol∣lowing to have produced the Fly But the time of their appearance de∣pends on the proportion of heat or cold as the author's subject was pre∣served from the severity of winter in a warm room The usual time to find them in the caterpillar state is August and in April the Fly  The singular provision which nature makes for the protection of this Fly deserves particular notice when the time of its continuation in the caterpillar state is expired by much labour it forms a kind of bag or purse of a very tough substance this it fixes against the trunks of trees c by a number of hairs or filaments which remain on the external surface It lines the outer case by one of a finer texture the top of which is closed by several bristles that unite in the center exactly representing a cap and excludes almost the possibility of its receiving an injury during this defenceless state In this bag it passes to the aurelia and remains until the birth of the perfect insectOur figure represents the chrysalis or aurelia in the bag part appears torn away to exhibit its situation therein  Were we to unite the several accounts of authors respecting its food it would appear to be a general feeder it will live on the rose the elm and the willow and on thorns and brambles particularly  PLATE II  FIG I MONOCULUS QUARICORNIS APTERA  Apterous insects are distinguished chiefly by having no wings in either male or female  GENERIC CHARACTER  The feet are formed for swimming The body is covered with a crustaceous case or shell The eyes fixed in the shell very near each other  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Grey brown One eye Antennae four Body diminishes towards the tail which is long and bifid with three or four strong hairs on each side A bag of eggs on each side of the tail Length half a line  Berk Out  Although this insect may have been noticed by many swimming or rather darting swiftly in various directions in water its minuteness is such that the most attentive could never have comprehended precisely its component parts but the microscope discovers it to be an animal of such singular formation as highly to deserve the attention of the naturalist It is covered by a firm crustaceous substance divided into annulations and armed in several parts with spines and bristles not∣withstanding  which this shell is so transparent that the whole motion of the intestines is very visible by a good magnifier  It must be granted that but for the microscope the wonders of the minute creation would be to us entirely unknown our ideas could never suppose the existence of those animated forms which occupy the immeasurable space between an apparent atom and nothing The myriads of animals thousands of times smaller than a mite must evade our cognizance and be an actual conviction of their nonexistence  But with all the utility that the microscope can boast no instru∣ment is so likely to mislead the most accurate observer particularly if not in the habit of using it the variations of light the difference of the magnifying powers or the damage the glasses may meet with by accident such as requires every one to examine with the greatest care one degree of light may bring an object to view whilst another may entirely blend it with the fluid it exists in or one glass may discover spines on an object another glass might have represented perfectly smooth it is therefore necessary to begin with a small power in pro∣portion to the size of the object and to proceed to deeper mag∣nifiers after  There is some difference in our figure and those either of  Barbut  or of  Baker  which appears chiefly from our using a single lens nearly of the deepest power convenient to use Our glasses were the th and th of an inch focus  We very attentively examined the eyes and found not one but two placed near each other on a scale or plate of a black colour hence arises the appearance of a single eye by a small magnifying power  The tail presents a forked appearance by a deep power and the eggs are contained in two bags one on each side the tail The co∣lour varies probably in proportion to the nature of its food to pale green more or less of a red or of a grey brown colour  FIG II  This minute animalcula is frequent in stagnant water or in in∣fusions of vegetables and is one species of those whose existence can only be discovered by a good microscope It is very difficult consi∣dering the power those creatures have to distort their true form at plea∣sure to fix their distinguishing character therefore where the definition appears dubious we prefer being silent rather than hazard an error  FIG Represents them  magnified  as they sometimes seem to follow the leader in herds but perhaps it is only the scent of the prey that induces each to follow the foremost as they frequently swim or whirl in the water separately with great swiftness devouring the smaller kinds of animalculae  FIG Two magnified by a deep power when they appear to have feet or sins  FIG Shews the strange form it assumes whilst depositing its eggs  FIG The eggs deeper magnified  PLATE III PHALAENA BUCEPHALA BUFFTIP MOTH LEPIDOPTERA  GENERIC CHARACTER  Antennae taper from the base to the apex and are setaceous Wings in general deflected when at rest Fly by night No Trunk Wings reversed i e first Wings horizontal and second erect  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Antennae feathered First Wings grey with two double transverse brown waves and a large yellowish brown spot at the extreme angle Second Wings plain light yellow length scarce one inch Cater∣pillar hairy yellow with black spots On Oaks Ash c  Berken∣hout  The delicate assemblage of beautiful down which cloath the upper wings of the Bufftip Moth is its chief recommendation the history affords but little for observation it is hatched from the egg in  August  and in  June  following the Fly is perfect  Its beauty preserves it not from the race of birds who pursue it from necessity or from an innate desire of cruelty and devastation and  whilst happy in its apparent security ranging the plain to experience the pleasures of liberty or to banquet in the nectareous profusion of the vegetable kingdom he becomes a dupe to his happiness his plea∣sures at once sully and he falls an unresisting victim into the devour∣ing jaws of death  PLATE IV PHALAENA GROSSULARIATA MAGPYE or CURRANTMOTH  GENERIC CHARACTER  The antennae setaceous decreasing in size from the base to the point The Wings when at rest generally deflected Fly by night  Antennae taper like bristles  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Antennae and Legs black Body yellow with black spots Wings white with many black patches and a transverse yellow wave on the first pair Caterpillar white with black spots on the Back Belly yellow  Berk Out  The MagpyeMoth is one of the  geometrae  and feeds on Gooseberry and Currantbushes as the name indicates The Caterpillar is found in  May  and in  July  the Fly  The Caterpillar previous to its change to the Chrysalis state spins a web of a very slight and delicate texture by which it is suspended horizontally against the branches of trees c as in our Plate re∣presented  PLATE V  FIG I MONOCULUS CONCHACEUS APTERA  Without wings  GENERIC CHARACTER  Body covered with a crust or shell Feet made for swimming  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Inclosed in a bivalve ashcoloured shell from the aperture of which it puts forth a number of capillary antennae which it retracts when taken out of the water  To acquire a proper knowledge of the formation of this minute in∣sect it is necessary to use a microscope with a glass stage for objects or rather such as admit of nicely adjusting a talc as occasion may re∣quire the insect to be taken from the water with a camelhair pencil and carefully placed on the talc after which it may be examined by a magnifier of of an inch focus but in proceeding to a deeper power let the talc be turned the upper surface with the insect in the drop of the fluid from the lens and thereby the lens may approach the object to its proper focus without this caution the lens would be frequently immerged in the water and entirely obstruct the sight  In the adult state the opacity of the bivalve shell its external co∣vering so entirely obscures the internal motion that nothing except the filaments it throws from the aperture or opening is visible by the microscope  It breaks from the egg perfectly formed but very minute and trans∣parent this is therefore the best time to discover its structure and from one in this state we have taken our figure  By the antennae it directs its course as does the  Monoculus Quadri∣cornis  and like it also it hath two eyes fixed in the shell but it can com∣pletely envelop its head in its bivalve covering its mouth is beneath but the numerous filaments it darts forth causes such a violent motion in the water that the minuter insects are unresistingly drawn between them and forced to the mouth  The motion of its lungs is very visible as are also the vesse ram  ls∣fying thence Its food is carried to and digested in the deepcoloured tube or intestine and the refuse is discharged by a sudden jerk from the extremity of the tube or anus  Thus it exists a life of rapine and destruction enjoyed at the ex∣pence of the lives of thousands and as the objects of its ravenous dis∣position are defenceless so are they the sport of their conqueror the few moments of intermission its craving appetite grants them is occu∣pied equally in the spoil first pressing them to death and then tossing them undevoured into the fluid  But should a more powerful insect oppose him he immediately con∣tracts his parts and

con∣stitute a material distinction The  Sixspot  is taken near the environs of  London where the other is rarely if ever found and in some parts of Bedfordshire the  Fivespot  is very common  As all Lepidopterous Insects undergo some trifling alterations from attendant circumstances so specimens of the female  Sp Filipendulae  has been taken with the two spots near the base of the Wing closely united and hence arose some doubt as to the existence of any other  Fivespot Burnet  the two kinds must not however be compared to entertain this supposition as the  Fivespot  is not only smaller the margin of the Inferior Wings deeper but wants that spot of red nearest the Apex of the Superior Wings and which must immedi∣ately appear on the slightest inspection  The Caterpillars of most Insects

fourteen days the Flies are perfect  The caterpillars of the  Pha Padella  and  Evonymella  are ever found in the same society and many circumstances may be advanced  to prove them either varieties of each other or difference of sex only although Linnaeus considered them as distinct species They differ in colour the Caterpillars of one being light yellow brown the other black and the upper wings of the  Evonymella  are less of a lead colour than those of the  Padella  To gain information on this subject we this season put the eggs of several females into different glasses the eggs of each female

Tail Moth we cannot pass over such remarkable circumstances as attended the uncommon increase of this species in the above winter  The fears of the public must have been great indeed when prayers were offered to avert the famine supposed to be threatened by the ap∣pearance of those insects in the state of the Caterpillar  In July the Caterpillar is found feeding on the whitethorn fallow appletrees

 PLATE XXIII SILPHA VESPILLO COLEOPTERA  GENERIC CHARACTER  Antennae clavated foliated Head prominent Thorax margined  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Margin of the thorax broad Shells abbreviated black with two orange belts Thigh of the hind legs large with a spine near their origin length one inch  This species like most of the Coleopterous Insects delights in filth and putrescence and are rarely found except in the dung or dead bodies of larger animals whose entrails they devour they prey on the larvae of smaller insects beneath the surface of the earth or they will destroy each other Their Grubs are secreted in perforations made in the earth by the female and therein they change to their last or perfect state in June or July those Grubs are to be found by following the track of a plough  They fly well with the transparent wings which are concealed be∣neath the Elytra or upper Shells The male is rather smaller than the female and the orange belts are of a deeper hue though both male and female vary in the strength of colour when alive and yet more when preserved in cabinets as they sometimes become almost brown All insects are subject to this change whatever may be the care of the collector  PLATE XXIV LIBELLULA DEPRESSA DRAGON FLY NEUROPTERA  Wings four naked transparent reticulated with veins or nerves Tail without a sting  GENERIC CHARACTER  Mouth with two long lateral jaws Antennae very short Tail of the male forked Wings extended  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Eyes brown Thorax greenish with two yellow transverse bands A large black spot at the base of each Wing and a small dark mark on their exterior margin Body depressed lanceshaped  All the species of Libellula but particularly the larger kinds are considered by many rather as objects of terror than subjects worthy in∣spection and the vulgar denomination of  Horsestinger  contributes to this abhorrence although it hath no power over animals of such mag∣nitude it is perfectly a Vulture among lepidopterous or other defenceless Insects destroying more for its sport than for its voracious appetite  The Fly is on the wing in May and June in almost every marshy situation the female lays her eggs near the roots of Osiers on the banks of ditches or sinks them into the stalks of Rushes in the water they hatch and an ugly apterous insect of a brown colour comes  forth it hath a long body like the Fly six Legs and a forked Head a sharp spine at the extremity of the abdomen and a row of spines on each side one at every joint it plunges into the water and imme∣diately devours such of the inhabitants or their eggs as comes within its reach and it continues this life of depredation until its next change They are to be taken with a small handnet  All transparent objects in a certain direction before a microscope reflect the colours of the prism The  Tipula Plumosa  exhibits in this situation an effulgence of colouring which its natural size con∣veys but small vestiges of and the colours on the wing of this Libellula appears far more vivid when magnified  The body of the male is bluish grey the present specimen is the female  PLATE XXV SPHINX APIFORMIS BEE HORNET SPHINX  GENERIC CHARACTER

morning or in the evening the Chrysalis is seen issuing through the bark from a perforation in the trunk which the Caterpillar had formed previous to its change gene∣rally to the depth of six or eight inches or more Nature has furnished every segment of the Chrysalis with a double row of sharp teeth or spines therewith it firmly attaches itself to the sides of the cavity and by repeated exertions

for the present subject notwithstanding it may be easily distinguished by a crescent of yellow in the fore part of the thorax and thence entitled the  Lunar Hornet Sphinx  a Drawing of which Insect with the larva has been presented to the  Linnaean Society  This larva is nearly the size of the Bufftip Caterpillar and of an obscure brown colour probably the larva of the  Sp Apiformis  may much resemble it  It is arranged in many cabinets under the title of  Sphinx Vespi∣formis  but the  Sp Vespiformis  in the  Linnaean Collection  now in the possession of Dr  Smith  scarcely exceeds half

Dipterous or twowinged Insects we have yet though so well known in its perfect state few have attended so minutely to its changes as to discover that they form the most singular part of its history The female deposits her eggs in the hollow stalks of aquatic plants or broken reeds or so provides for them that they cannot but by some unforeseen accident be carried away The egg in due time ripening produces a Larva no way resembling the Parent but rather a Worm  of a most singular structure This happens about the latter end of  May  or beginning of  June  if the weather proves favourable they will then be found in shallow standing waters crawling on the grass or plants which grow there or they may be taken floating on the surface of the water The Body consists of twelve annular divisions whereof the Head and Tail are two the Tail has a verge of hairs which when entirely expanded support the creature on the surface with its head downwards If it wishes to descend it contracts the hairs in the form of a wine glass or entirely closes them at the end and when again it is rising to the surface it forces a bubble from a small aperture in the center which immediately makes a passage for its ascension It changes to the Pupa state and about the middle of  July  to the Fly It subsists at this time on the nectar and other juices it extracts from the bottom of the corolla in flowers  FIG II MUSCA PENDULA DIPTERA MUSCA  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Head black Thorax yellow with three longitudinal black lines Abdomen yellow with transverse black marks  Its habits nearly

those more common subjects occasionally introduced and which the nature of our plan cannot permit us to refuse  Our endeavours to procure the Caterpillar have hitherto been in∣effectual although it is

taken it since that plate was finished or we would have introduced it with the Fly Being unac∣quainted with any perfect representation of this aquatic larva we are happy to give it before the completion of the first volume  PLATE XXXVI  FIG I LIBELLULA PUELLA NEUROPTERA  Wings four naked transparent reticulated With Veins or Nerves Tail without a sting  GENERIC CHARACTER  Mouth with two long lateral Jaws Antennae very short tail of the male forked Wings extended  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Body Saxongreenish blue Eyes distant remote Wings of equal length with a cloud of brown in the middle and without marginal spot Length two inches  Linn Syst Nat    Fan Sv    It is neither so large as to infuse terror by its appearance or so beautiful as to claim the first place in a collection of British insects notwithstanding there are many inferior to it both in elegance and co∣lour The whole of the body is a deep purplish blue which reflects on one part a most brilliant colour with a greenish cast and the clouds on the wings contribute much to its lustre The Thorax and Head are nearly the same some few shades of green excepted  It is found in  May  and  June  sporting on the waters or among the bushes which overgrow the sides of pools or gently flowing streams at noon or after a shower when the sun breaks from its watery prison and penetrates the thickets and the groves with inviting warmth they are seen issuing from the dark retreat and overhanging shrubbery to bask and wanton in its effulgent beams and fan the gently rising breeze with their lucid Wings In many parts on the banks of the  Thames  they heighten the scene by the glow and richness of their colouring the green the blue and the red the yellow purple and the brown in their richest teints according to the species and as they fly in various directions display themselves in all their native elegance and splendor  FIG II LIBELLULA PUELLA NEUROPTERA LIBELLULA  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Body red with yellow and black lines at each segment thorax green with yellow stripes Wings clear with marginal spots  The body is red with a yellow band and black mark at every seg∣ment the Thorax green with
