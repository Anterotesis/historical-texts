 MIDAS AN English Burletta  Price Eighteenpence  MIDAS AN English Burletta  As it is performed at the THEATREROYAL IN  COVENTGARDEN  LONDON Printed for G KEARSLY W GRIFFIN J COOTE T LOWNDS and W NICOLE  M DCC LXIV  To the READER  THE Editor of the following piece thinks proper to observe that the first idea of it was conceived and the plan in some measure executed by a gentleman in Dublin for the private entertainment of some persons of distinction in that kingdom at a time when Italian Burlettas were blended with the exhibitions of the Theatre and almost triumphed over the best productions in our language The public spirit of those for whom it was originally intended prevailed upon the author to enlarge his design Accordingly MIDAS adventured on the stage and met with uncommon success for a series of nights The Editor begs leave to add a word concerning the stile which prevails in the following scenes They are written in the true spirit of the mockheroic BURLESQUE in all times from the stage of ATHENS down to the DRAGON OF WANTLEY has been esteemed one of the provinces of the Drama It's  humour principally consists in making dignified personages raise in our minds trite and ordinary ideas or else in giving to trivial objects a serious air of gravity and importance  It would be impertinent to point out instances in either way of composition but thus much was deemed necessary that no one should look for another sort of entertainment than was here intended The public with their usual candour will consider the particular scope of this piece and will decide nothing till they have heard the musick to which it is adapted Should MIDAS in the representation be found to have merit and indeed excellence in its kind the generous critick will allow the author that degree of applause which his talents seem to deserve  Dramatis Personae  Jupiter  Mr  Legg  Juno  Mrs  Stephens  Apollo  Mr  Mattocks  Momus  Mr  Dibden  Mercury  Mr  Baker  Pan  Mr
