Dozen Shirts and your Regimentals are my whole Cargo  Capt  I was wild to get away and as soon as I obtain'd my Leave of Absence I thought every Moment an Age till I return'd to the Place where I first saw this youngcharming innocent bewitching Creature  Puff  With fifteen thousand Pounds for her FortuneStrong Motives I must confessAnd now Sir as you are pleas'd to say you must depend upon my Care and Abilities in this Affair I think I have a just Right to be acquainted with the Particulars of your Passion that I may be the better enabled to serve you  Capt  You shall have 'emWhen I left the University which is now seven Months since my Father who loves his Money better than his Son and would not settle a Farthing upon me  Puff  Mine did so by me Sir  Capt  Purchas'd me a Pair of Colours at my own Request but before I join'd the Regiment which was going  abroad I took a Ramble into the Country with a FellowC  legian to see a Relation of his who liv'd in  Berkshire    Puff  A Party of Pleasure I suppose  Capt  During a short Stay there I came acquainted with this young Creature she was just come from the BoardingSchool and tho' she had all the Simplicity of her Age and the

Compliance with my Commands  Exit  Captain  Puff  The Devil's in these fiery young Fellows they think of no body's Wants but their own He does not consider that I am Flesh and Blood as well as himself

from you and if I am secure of your Affections  Puff  I'll be bound for him Madam and give you any Security you can ask  Tag  Every thing goes on to our Wish Sir I just now had a second Conference with my old Lady and she was so convinced by my Arguments that she return'd instantly to the Lawyer to forbid the drawing out of any Writings at all and she is determin'd never to thwart Miss's Inclinations and left it to us to give the old Gentleman his Discharge at the next Visit  Capt  Shall I undertake the old Dragon  Tag  If we have Occasion for Help we shall call for you  Biddy  I expect him every Moment therefore I'll tell you what  Rhodophil  you and your Man shall be lock'd up in my Bedchamber till we have settled Matters with the old Gentleman  Capt  Do what you please with

Dangerslet me see what shall I do with my two Gallants I must at least part with 'em decently suppose I set 'em together by the EarsThe luckiest thought in the World For if if they won't quarrel as I believe they won't I can break with them for Cowards and very justly dismiss 'em my Service and if they will fight and one of 'em should be kill'd the other will certainly be hang'd or run away and so I shall very handsomely get rid of bothI am glad I have settled it so purely  Enter  Tag  Well  Tag  are they safe  Tag  I think so the Door's double lock'd and I have the Key in my Pocket  Biddy  That's pure but have you given 'em any thing to divert 'em  Tag  I have given the Captain one of your old Gloves to mumble but my  Strephon  is diverting himself with the more substantial Comforts of a cold Ven'son Pasty  Biddy  What shall we do with the next that comes  Tag  If Mr  Fribble  comes first I'll clap him up into my Lady's Storeroom I suppose he is a great Maker  of Marmalade himself and will have an Opportunity of making some critical Remarks upon our Pastry and Sweetmeats  Biddy  When one of 'em comes do you go and watch for the other and as soon as you see him run in to us and pretend it is my Aunt and so we shall have an Excuse to lock him up till we want him  Tag  You may depend upon me here is one of 'em  Enter  Fribble  Biddy  Mr  Fribble  your Servant  Fribble  Miss

Heart  Kneels and gives the Pot  Biddy  Upon my Word that is very prettily express'd you are positively the best Company in the WorldI wish he was out of the House  Aside  Frib  But to return to my Accident and the Reason why my Hand is in this ConditionI beg you'll excuse the Appearance of it and be satisfyed that nothing but mere Necessity could have forc'd me to appear thus muffled before you  Biddy  I am very willing to excuse any Misfortune that happens to you Sir  Curtsies  Frib  You are vastly good indeedthus it wasHemYou must know Miss there is not an Animal in the Creation I have so
