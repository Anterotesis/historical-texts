 THE  FreeHolders Plea  AGAINST STOCKJOBBING ELECTIONS OF Parliament Men  LONDON  Printed in the Year  THE  FreeHolders Plea  AGAINST STOCKJOBBING Elections of PARLIAMENT Men  OF all the Nations in the World we may say without Detracting from the Character of our Native Country that  England  has for some Ages past been the most Distracted with Divisions and Parties among themselves  Union and Charity the one relating to our Civil the other to Religious Concerns are Stangers in the Land and whether we speak of difference in Opinions or differences in Interest we must own that we are the most  Divided Quarrelsome Nation under the Sun  Poland  is the only Nation of  Europe  which can pretend to Match us in this Illnatur'd Quality and yet all things examin'd  Poland  cannot come near us  'Twas a true Character given of us by the Wisest Princess that ever Govern'd us Queen  Elizabeth  that the  English  were harder to be Govern'd in time of Peace than War  What Experience our present Governors have had of this Old Maxim in the short Peace we have had we leave to every Man's Observation  Not to enter into the History of the Divisions and Civil Disturbances in the Nations Peace which is too fresh in our Memories and cannot be review'd without sensible Regret by any Man who Loves his Country or has the least regard to its Prosperity or Reputation  Yet we cannot but express our sense of the Encrease and more than ordinary progress of this wrangling Temper on the present Affairs of the Publick and with what Fatal success it Invades us in the most Minute and most tender Parts with what subtilty it spreads its contagious Qualities into the Vitals of the State and  from thence descends into the less Noble Parts the Trade of the Nation  Religion and the State have felt the plague of Contention eating out the very Entrails of the Nation and with a sort of alternate Motion have equally come under its Malignant Effects for almost Four entire Centuries of Years and as if it was not enough to hurt us in those two Essentials of our Peace behold the Plague is broke out in our Trade which is the third and next the other two the Supreme Article of the Kingdoms Prosperity  Wherefore we the Yeomandry and poor Freeholders of  England  having God knows no Hand in the Differences tho' we have a deep share in the Damages do take the freedom to make our just Remarks upon the Causes which as we apprehend have conduc'd too much to the present unhappy Divisions of the Nation and which if some care be not taken to prevent it may compleat the Ruin of us all  The Wisdom of late Parliaments have Establish'd two great Rivals in Trade the Old and the New  East India  Companies  We do not pretend to Arraign the Justice of those  Wonderful and Unintelligible Assemblies  if they  were in being we dare not and since they are not in being 'tis not very Honourable you'll say to speak ill of the Dead  But thus far we hope without offence we may be allow'd to give our Opinions in this particular Affair that tho' separately and distinctly every part of the proceedings of those Parliaments might be literally and positively Just and Right we mean as to the  East India  Companies  Yet when they are Conjunctively and in the General put together and reflected on they seem to be clouded both as to the publick Interest and as to the Honour of the proceedings with dark Enigma's of State and Inexplicable Paradoxes too hard for us to understand such as these  That during the Being of one Company and before the Extent of their Charter and Privileges were Expir'd we mean the years allow'd them for bringing Home their Effects there should be Erected a New Company with power of immediate Trade  Had the New Company not commenc'd their Trade till the time of the Old was expir'd or near it there might have been a Succession of Companies not two Rival Companies in Being together  That the manner of the Trading by the New Company should be so Order'd as that the Old Company by Subscribing shou'd enable themselves to Trade separately as a Company still and that with so Capital a Stock as always to share the Trade with the New Company and so at the same time two contraries be upheld by the same Authority  Had the New Company been so Establish'd that at the Expiration of the Old it shou'd have had a Commanding Superiority by which no other Men cou'd have Traded but under them by Permission at the same time leaving all Men at liberty to come in and Trade with them there had been then no Rivals in the Trade which will no question as they now stand soon reduce the Trade to very low Terms  That after this New Company was Establish'd and the Mony paid in to the Use of the Government  which some say was the thing which first mov'd the Conception of a New Company and which if the Old Company wou'd have procur'd they had never been Broke nor the New one Born  That after this New Company was Erected the Stock advanc'd and the Mony to the Government pay'd they shou'd prohibit by Act of Parliament Two Thirds of their Trade and so Starve the Child they had Begotten  If the Trade was ruinous to the English Manufactures and the Interest of the Nation it shou'd have been foreseen before Gentlemen had payd their Mony or else it shou'd not have been Examin'd afterwards  That after all this they shou'd grant a New Charter to the Old Company by Virtue of which they have both Power and Time to Trade to the prejudice of the New even to their Hearts Content  We say nothing of those particulars but thus that really we do not understand the consistency of them with themselves they stand to us as Arcana's of Policy too high to be medled with  Nor shou'd we trouble our Heads about them but leave both Companies to confound one another as we believe they will but that we find so great a part of the Nation concern'd in their Quarrel as gives us cause to Observe that the Issue of them seems to threaten the Nation with something Fatal  For the Power of these two Rivals is so great and their Interest in the Kingdom so popular and High that Matters of higher Moment than Trade seem to depend upon them while all the proceedings of their Members both in the City and in the late Parliament in both which  their Parties have been numerous are and have been guided according to their Interest in their respective Companies  The Grand Work which the whole Nation is now Intent upon is chusing their Representatives in Parliament Chusing Men to Meet and advise with the King about the most Important Affairs of the Kingdom  And while all Men ought to be fixing their Eyes upon such Men as are best Qualified to Sit in that Place of Honour and to Examine who are fittest to be Intrusted with the Religion and Peace of  England  and perhaps of all  Europe  Here we are plagu'd with the Impertinence of two  East India  Companies as if the Interest of either Company were to be Nam'd in the Day with the  Protestant Religion and the publick Peace  or as if they who are fit to be Representatives of the People in the great Matters of Peace and War Leagues and Alliances of Neighbours Succession of Crowns and Protection of the Protestant Religion should not be capable of deciding the petty Controversy in Trade between two Rivial Companies  The Grand Question ask'd now when your Vote is requir'd for a Parliament Man is not as it ought to be Is he a Man of Sense of Religion of Honesty and Estate  But What Company is he for the New or the Old  If Mr  A M  set up as a Candidate in a Neighbouring Borough Who set him up 'Tis known he is no Inhabitant there nor ever was has no Freehold or Copyhold or Leasehold Estate there nor is not known there and of himself possibly was not acquainted with People there  But enquire what Company he is for and then see if all the rest of that Company were not found running over the Water to make their Interest with their Friends for his Election  And the Time would fail us and the Paper too to give you a List of the Shopkeepers Merchants and Pedlers and the StockJobbers who with their Hir'd Liveries in Coaches and Six Horses who God knows never had Coach or Livery of their own are come down into the Countreys being detach'd from  London  by either Company to get themselves chosen ParliamentMen by those Boroughs who are easie to be Impos'd upon and who like wellmeaning Men that know nothing of the Matter Choose them upon the Recommendation of the Pountry Gentlemen that have Interest in the Towns which  Country Gentlemen are prevail'd upon to quit their own pretensions to advance theirs but by what Arguments we cannot pretend to Determine  We have formerly been told that spending Mony upon the Inhabitants of Towns was a pernicious practice and no doubt it was and an Act of Parliament has been wisely made to prevent it  What any Man cou'd propose to himself by spending nay pound was spent at the Town of  Winchelsea  to be chosen to Sit in a House where there is not one Farthing to be gotten honestly was a Mystery every one did not understand  But here is a New way of getting Mony For if a Country Gentleman has so much Interest in a Town that he can be chosen a Member of Parliament if he will decline it here is a sort of Folks they call  StockJobbers  help him to a G  s for his Interest  This is ParliamentJobbing and a New Trade which as we thought it the Duty of  English  Freeholders thus to Expose we hope an  English  Parliament will think it their Duty to prevent  For as this StockJobbing in its own Nature is only a new Invented sort of  Deceptio Visus  a  Legerdemain  in Trade so mix'd with Trick and Cheat that twou'd puzzle a good  Logician  to make it out by  Syllogism  So nothing can be more Fatal in  England  to our present Constitution and which in time may be so to our Liberty and Religion than to have the Interests of Elections Jobb'd upon Exchange for Mony and Transfer'd like  East India  Stock to those who bid most  By this Method the Country Gentlemen may sit at Home and only Corresponding with the Brokers at  Jonathan  's and  Garraway's  as the Prizes Rise or Fall they may dispose of their Interests in the Towns they can Govern at as good a rate as they can  The Citizens or such who have their several Companies and Interest to Serve will Ease themselves of the Expence of Travelling with the fine borrow'd Equipages before mention'd and only go to Market in Exchange Alley and Buy an Election as the StockJobber and they shall agree which Election shall be manag'd by the Country Gentleman who is to have his Bargain no Purchase no Pay and is to go thro' with it or else he gets none of the Mony  Elections of ParliamentMen are in a hopeful way and Parliaments themselves are in a hopeful way by this concise Method of Practice to come unde the absolute Management of a few Hands and no doubt things will go on accordingly  Banks and Stocks may be lay'd up and employ'd in a short time for the purchasing the Interest of Gentlemen and our Gentry being willing to get a Penny in  an Honest way  as we say will but too often sell their Interests and their Country too especially such Gentlemen whose Estates are reduc'd to an occasion for it  The truth of it is 'tis a Paradox a Riddle that we Countrymen cannot understand nor never cou'd what makes our Gentlemen so fond of being Parliament Men we do not very well understand what the Business is at the Parliament Only we find we are swingingly Tax'd and they tell us 'tis done by the Parliament but we never understood they had any of the Mony themselves we always thought the Mony was for the King tho' they had the Giving of it then we see in the King's  Proclamation  for Calling a Parliament that it was to Advise with them about Affairs of the Highest Importance to the  Kingdom Now we cannot see they can get any thing by coming together to be Advis'd with and our Knights of the Shire tell us they get nothing by it And here lies the Difficulty we can never reconcile their spending so much Money to be Chosen going up Miles to  London  and spending six Months sometimes there in attending the House and all for nothing we have often been thinking there must be something else in the case and we are afraid there is  Nor did ever any thing explain this Riddle so much as the struggling of these two Companies to make Members of Parliament for the meaning to us seems thus  That they suppose which Company so ever gets most Friends in the House will be most likely to be farther Establish'd to the Ruin of the other and therefore they make such a stir to get Friends there  Whence first it must be suppos'd that the Matter shall not stand or fall by true Merrit and that Company be supprest that deserves it for if so it might be probable they wou'd both be supprest for we apprehend they are both destructive to our  English  Trade in general and Manufactures in particular  But It must be suppos'd that Friendship and Number of Voices only will decide the Controversy  And in order to this the StockJobbers who care not a Farthing which Side gets the better but makes a Prey of them both have set up this new Trade of Jobbing for Elections And that the way of their proceeding may be a little plainer understood We desire you to read the Copy of a Letter come down last Post to a worthy Gentleman in our Country from a Friend of his plying in or near  ExchangeAlly  concerning this Matter  SIR  THE Elections for a New Parliament being began almost ever where I doubt not but the Time is fixt at your Town of  I know you have the Absolute Power of the Inhabitants there and can put in whom you please and finding by your last you purpose to Decline it you Self I am to inform you that a very honest Gentleman of my Acquaintance being an Eminent Merchant here wou'd think himself very much Oblig'd if you wou'd Use your Interest in his behalf upon your Grant whereof I have an Order to Preent you with a Thousand Guinea's to buy my Lady Pins  He is ready to come down at your first Summons in a very good Equipage Pray dispatch your Mind per the Bearer to  Your humble Servant  To the Honourable Sir  A B C D  Bar  Postscript  IF Sir  E F G H  will dispose of his Interest in the Town of  I can help him to very good Terms  Now tho' the worthy Gentleman to whom this Proposal was made rejected it with Disdain yet the Attempt is made very plain in the case  And we are inform'd that the Number of Members come down into the Counties on such accounts are incredible  Wherefore we think it very needful to publish our Resentments at such a practice and to protest against it in this our Honest Plea as an indirect wicked and pernicious Practice and which may be of very ill consequence to the Nation on these following Accounts  A hundred or an hundred and fifty such Members in the House wou'd make a Dead  Weight as it us'd to be call'd to carry any Vote they are For or Against either in the Negative or Affirmative as they shall agree and if so it will be almost in their Power to dispose of our Estates Persons Liberties and Religion as they think fit  If it be true as is very rational to suppose that they who will Buy will Sell or if it be true which seems still more rational that they who have Bought must Sell must make a  Penny  of it or else they lose their  Purchase  and some their Fortunes which they expected to raise by these mercenary Elections then the Influence such a Number of Members gotten into the House by the method We are speaking of will be capable of selling our Trade our Religion our Peace our Effects our King our Crown and every thing that is Valluable or Dear to the Nation  If Stockjobbing of Elections be the first step in all probability Stockjobbing of Votes will be be the second for he that will give a Thousand pounds or more only for a power to Vote expects to get something by Voting or gives away his Money for nothing  What shall we say then if a League of Confederacy shou'd be made between our ParliamentSollicitors and our Stockjobbingbrokers two sort of People equally mercenary and deceitful  We desire to know whether 'twould not be more fatal to  England  than the Union of  France  and  Spain  which all  Europe  seems to be so much disturb'd at  In vain do We the FreeHolders of  England  strive to Chuse Men of all the Six Characters mention'd by a late Author in order to have a Parliament every way Quallified for the Important Affairs his Majesty has mentioned in his Proclamation  In vain shall those Gentlemen We chose sit and Vote in the House if such a Generation as We hear of are let into the House by the help of their Money at the Boroughs and Towns for the Citizens and Burgesses outrun the Knigths in Number above Three for One  We think 'tis no small Misfortune to the  English  Constitution that so great a Number of Members Chosen by the Corporations of  England  and according to our weak Opinions it seems not equal That all the Freeholders of a County  shou'd be represented only by two Men and the Towns in the same County be represented by above Forty as it is in  Cornwall  and near the like in other Counties  Again in some of these Corporations where the right of Voting is in the Mayor and Jurats in some the Mayor Aldermen and Common Councel in others the Mayor Aldermen and Capital Burgesses in others the Bayliff and Jurats and the like the right of Voting is reduc'd to so few and those so Mean and Mercenary that they are easily prevail'd with to chuse such as they know not but are recommended by others  And which is worse some Towns whose Charters remain tho' the Towns themselves seem to be Dead are so mean and contemptible that nothing remains of them but a Despicable Village with the Ruins of what they have been  We think it wou'd be but reasonable that the Charters and Priviledges of Towns shou'd die with the Towns and that whereas when they were Popolous and Rich they were Represented in Parliament because they were so when they are Depopulated and Desolate there can be no need of any Person to represent them what can  the Members who have serv'd for the Town of  Winchelsea  answer if they were ask'd who they Represent they must Answer they Represent the Ruins and Vaults the remain of a good Old Town now lying in Heaps as for the Inhabitants they are not to be Nam'd among the List of the most despicable Endships or Village in the County  Branber  in  Sussex  Old  Sarum Stockbridge Gatton Quinburro  and multitudes of Towns the like who send up Gentlemen to represent Beggars and have had more Mony spent at some of their Elections than all the Land in the Parishes wou'd be worth if Sold at a Hundred Years Purchase  While on the other Hand a great many good Towns in  England  being of more modern Rise in the World are not permitted to chuse at all and the City of  London  it self tho' some say it bears a proportion to Six parts of the Kingdom sends but Four Members of it self and but Eight in the whole Circumference  This Inequality we humbly conceive opens the Door to the fraudulent practices which have all along been made use of in Elections Buying of Voices giving Freedoms in Corporations to People Living out of Corporations on purpose  to make Votes debauching the Electors makeing whole Towns Drunk and Feasting them to Excess for a Month sometimes two or more in order to engage their Voices  These things were so Notorious and withal so Ruinous to the Gentry themselves of whom several Men of plentiful Estates have been miserably Beggar'd and undone that the Parliament wisely took notice of it and have prohibited the practice  But as if the Devil ow'd the Nation a Grudge and was rummaging his Invention to find it out here is a new project found out to succeed the other which is Ten Fold more the Child of Hell than that  Elections were obtain'd by those Clandestine Vicious ways only to sit in the House in General but here the design seems to be form'd beforehand what they wou'd be chosen for and the measures concerted nay we have heard that it may be known already and Wagers have been layd in or near  Exchange Alley  which Company has most Friends in the ensuing Parliament and how many of the Members of each Company stand fairest to be chosen  Those Gentlemen who have Intelligence suitable  to such nice Calculations are equally capable of Jobbing the whole Nation and as is already noted having gotten the way of Buying and Selling that is jobbing Elections will soon influence such Persons to Act as the Mony they are able to bid shall direct  'Twou'd be but a melancholly Thought to reflect that the matter of our Succession shou'd come to be debated before a Parliament that had a Governing number of such Members who cou'd imagine but that the settlement of our Crown wou'd attend the highest bidder and our future Liberty Religion and all that's dear to us be Mortgag'd to the Bribes of Forreigners  The  French  King need not keep great Armies on Foot Build Ships and Strengthen himself at Sea to Ruin us if the great Affairs of the Kingdom concerted in Parliament shou'd come to be prepar'd manag'd and byass'd at  Garraway  's and  Jonathan  's Coffeehouse and expos'd to Sale by a parcel of StockJobbers  And how shall it be otherwise they that can make Members will always Govern Members Creation supposes a Right of disposing the Gentlemen who Buy are Oblig'd to stand in good Terms with the Broker least they shou'd find a better  Chapman and leave him in the lurch the next Election so that by the Nature of the thing they are always subject to this Mercenary Scandalous thing call'd a Broker and he keeps them under his Girdle if he bids them Vote for or against they do it the mischiefs are endles and innumerable that may at tend it  To all Men whose Eyes are to be open'd with Reason and Argument it shou'd be enough to fill them with abhorrence to think that the Scandalous Mechanick Upstart Mistery of Jobbrokeing should grow upon the Nation that ever the  English  Nation shou'd suffer themselves to be Impos'd upon by the New invented ways of a few Needy Mercinaries who can turn all Trade into a Lottery and make the  Exchange  a Gaming Table A thing which like the Imaginary Coins of Foreign Nations have no reality in themselves but are plac'd as things which stand to be Calculated and Reduc'd into Value a Trade made up of Sharp and Trick and manag'd with Impudence and Banter  That Six or Eight Men shall Combine together and by pretended Buying or Selling among themselves raise or sink the Stock of the  E India  Company to what extravagant pitch of Price  they will so to wheedle others sometimes to Buy sometimes to Sell as their occasions require and with so little regard to Intrinsick Value or the circumstances of the Company that when the Company has a loss Stock shall Rise when a great Sale or a Rich Ship arriv'd it shall Fall Sometimes run the Stock down to  l  other times up to a  l  and by this Method Buy and Sell so much that 'tis thought there are few of the Noted Stockjobbers but what have bought and sold more Stock than both the Companies possess  Thus let them Jobb Trick and Cheat one another and let them be bubbl'd by them that know no better but for God's sake Gentlemen do not let the Important Affairs of the State come under their wicked clutches  Don't let them prepare our Acts of Parliament and then Chuse Members to Vote for them If Fate and  Popish  Confederacies and Union of  Popish  Powers abroad threaten us Let us alone to struggle with them and have Fair Law and Honourable Conditions for it but to be Bought and Sold to have our Elections of Members and our Laws Liberties and Estates Stockjobb'd away is intollerable  Some and not a few of our Stockjobbing Brokers are  French  Men a little Correspondence between the  French Court  and  Jonathan  's  Coffeehouse  with a Currency of  Louis D'ors  will make strange alterations here if this method of Buying and Jobbing Elections shou'd go on  The Parliament of  England  is the Governing Council their Breath is our Law and on their Breath under the Direction of God's Providence we all depend the greatest Nicety that is possible should be us'd in chusing Men of untainted Principles and unquestion'd Wisdom to compose a Body so Eminent in their Power and Influence  But to attempt to fill the House with Mechanicks Tradesmen Stockjobbers and Men neither of Sense nor Honesty is tricking at the Root and undermining the Nation's Felicity at once and 'tis a wonder the impudence of this attempt has not made them Stink in the Nostrils of the whole Nation  How can the King be encourag'd to place that confidence in his People which he mentions in the late  Proclamation  by which People his Majesty understands the true Representative Body Assembled in Parliament if instead of a  true Representative the House is fill'd with Elections Clandestinly procur'd by Tricks and Shams impos'd upon the People  How can the King depend upon his Parliament to carry him thro' any thing he shall undertake by their advice if mercenary Men fill the House whose Suffrages shall be guided by the Bribes and private procurations of his and the Nations Enemies  How shall the Protestant Religion be Espous'd and Defended which wise Men say is in great Danger  How shall Trade be Encourag'd and Protected and the Niceties of it Dsputed and Defended  How shall Reformation of Manners which is so much wanted and which the King has so often Recommended be promoted  Are Stockjobbers Agents of Regiments Taylors and  East India  Companies Qualifi'd for these Works or will any sort of Men who Purchase Elections with Mony to bring to pass private Interests and Parties Espouse these General Cases on which the Welfare of the Nation depends  Tell a Stockjobber of the Union of  France  and  Spain  of the  Muscovites  breaking the Peace of the Difference between the  Danes  and the Duke of  Holstein  Tell him of a good Barrier in  Flanders  against the  French  or of Assisting the  Emperor  on the  Rhine  talk Gospel to a Kettle Drum 'tis all Excentrick and Foreign to him But talk of the Great  Mogul  and the Pirates of  Madagascar  of Fort St  George  and St  Helena  there you'll hit him and he turns Statesman presently  It was a Famous StockJobber and one who is very likely to be a Parliament Man who when some body was talking lately of the Election of the New  Pope  and having heard the particulars very attentively brought out this very grave Question at the end ont Well says he I am glad 'tis over and don't you think that  Stock  will rise upon't  A Learned Question upon the Case truly upon which pray give us leave to ask another  And is't not pity  But such a one should Represent the City  You  Londoners  may make them Sheriffs Aldermen and Deputies and CommonCouncel  Men and welcome you know them and they can hurt no body but themselves  But when you come to talk of Parliament Men Gentlemen pray consider 'tis the whole Nation lies at Stake a Man may set his own House on Fire and welcome provided it stands by it self and neither hurts nor endangers no bodies else and the Law has nothing to say to him but if it stands in a Town or a City he deserves to be Hang'd for he may burn out and undo his Neighbours  Nor are you chusing Men to sit in Parliament as Persons to Act for you only whom they Represent but they are Representatives in a double capacity separately consider'd every Member Represents the People who chuse him and all together Represent the whole Nation Their right to sit is separately Devolv'd but their right in Act is conjunctively Inherent every Man Represents the whole and Acts for the whole tho' he is sent but from part  The Fate of  Bristol  or  New Castle  may be decided by a Member of  London  or  Canterbury  whose Vote on an equality of Voices carries it which way he pleases  Therefore  London  cannot say to  Bristol  or  NewCastle  What have you to do with our Election or they to  London  What have you to do with ours why one bad Member may ruin a City a Town or Family a Person or perhaps all together and if any Town or City or Burrough or private Person is pleas'd to give a Friendly Admonition or Caution to another especially if they seem to be proceeding against their own or the Nation's Interest they ought to accept the Hint and reflect upon what they are doing with Honesty and reform it  Upon this we hope it shall be justified that we have ventur'd to lay open the Villanous practices of some People to corrupt and procure Elections in order to get Members into the ensuing Parliament who shall serve a Turn and a Party without considering whether they are Men qualified for the other great Affairs which are to be consider'd there and which His Majesty has assur'd us are of the highest Importance to the Kingdom  FINIS
