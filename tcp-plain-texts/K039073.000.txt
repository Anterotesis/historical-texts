 A LETTER To the RIGHT REVEREND The Lord Bishop of Od Price One Shilling  A LETTER To the RIGHT REVEREND The Lord Bishop of Od CONTAINING Some Animadversions upon a Character given of the late Dr BENTLEY IN A LETTER from a late Professor in the University of  Oxford  to the Right Rev Author of the Divine Legation of MOSES demonstrated  "  Jam parce sepulto  "  LONDON  Printed for J WILKIE in St Paul's ChurchYard  A LETTER To the RIGHT REVEREND The Lord Bishop of Od  My LORD  A LETTER subscribed by a  late Professor in the University of Oxford  and addressed to a learned Prelate now living fell into my hands no earlier than a few days ago A very unexpected character which is therein given of the literary taste and genius of the late Dr  Bentley  has strongly tempted me to address a few observations to the Writer of that Letter and as I shall hope to do this  with all becoming civility and decorum I presume the  Lord Bishop of O  will make no scruple to avow any opinions which a  late Professor in that University  thought fit to advance  In the correspondence I have now commenced with your Lordship it is far from my meaning to attempt at measuring weapons with you in the science of letters I have much too humble a sense of my own powers and too high a respect for your Lordship's to entertain such a design It is an appeal to your candour as a gentleman not an attack upon your capacity as a scholar that I meditate I am willing you should enjoy whole and unenvied all the same you can fairly and honestly acquire but I would wish your Lordship to believe that no credit is to be gained either with the present age or posterity by attempting  to demolish the reputation of another  Add to this that such conduct is in your particular grossly impolitic You at present enjoy a temporary repose hostilities seem for a while suspended between your  Right Reverend Correspondent  and you cultivate the time examine and improve your resources conciliate to yourself new allies rivet and confirm your old ones and imitate those few wise and provident princes who knowing the short duration of all public felicity employ the intervals of peace in preparations for a future war  You will probably find employment enough for all your talents when the great champion whom you have so insultingly provoked shall enter the lists against you the time will certainly come  and amongst the virtues which you will have occasion to exercise in that day of trial 'tis well my Lord if repentance be not found to have a place  The zealous affection which you my Lord so well know how to express for your friends must excuse the warmth with which I interest myself in the defence of mine If honour calls upon us to resent an aspersion upon an absent friend yet living something more than honour piety engages us to vindicate the dead Did your Lordship when you struck with such rancour at Dr  Bentley  flatter yourself that he had outlived all those private and tender alliances which bind and connect mankind together and that his fame lay at the mercy of every free booter Far from it the learned and the candid of all nations are the friends of his fame and no  inconsiderable number still survive whom his private worth and virtues have left under lasting impressions of affection The former order of men will probably think you have discovered no great tokens of discernment in this invective or favouring your judgment will think your temper not altogether free from some small portion of envy and asperity As for the latter class of people personalities my Lord inflame mankind to that degree that 'tis well if they leave you even the small shred of reputation which you have allowed to Dr  Bentley    Recollect my Lord the warmth the piety with which you remonstrated against  Bishop W  's treatment of your father in a passage of his  Julian    Page  "  It is not in behalf of myself that I expostulate but of one for whom I am much more concerned that is my Father  "  These are your Lordship's words amiable affecting expression instructive lesson of filial devotion Alas my Lord that you who was thus sensible to the least speck which fell upon the reputation of your father should be so inveterate against the fame of one at least as eminent and perhaps no less dear to his family  For my own part much as I reverence great and learned men in my poor estimation one generous sentiment one benevolent emanation of the heart is of more value and respect than all the unimpassioned productions of the understanding I therefore cannot help holding  your Correspondent  in higher esteem for the generous and candid manner in which he atones for this offence than for all the vast fund of erudition which he has displayed in the eyes of the world to the singular annoyance as it should seem of your Lordship but to the general  use and information of all mankind besides  He tells you that he knew not that the  Pages  Mr L whom he had treated with disrespect in one of his notes was your father that this circumstance amply justified you for every thing he complained of relative to your unkind usage of him in your prelections in short that he owed so much to your piety which he considered as really edifying that he would strike out that note against your father the first opportunity Indeed the whole turn of the letter from which these expressions are selected carries such an air of candour and polite acknowledgment that I am surprised your Lordship with this transaction fresh in your memory should not have considered when you was thus unhandsomely  treating Dr  Bentley  's character that it was possible some one might be found under the same predicament or with the same feelings towards him that you had experienced towards Mr L There is a rule my Lord in the Christian doctrine which I dare say you have frequently recommended to other people that on this occasion would have been peculiarly useful to yourself All that can now be done is that as you have thought fit to copy  your learned Correspondent  in the least amiable part of his character you should strive to resemble him in his more shining features and learn of him that even faults may be made graceful by an ingenuous manner of atoning for them As there are some distempers which by being skilfully cured leave the constitution more vigorous and healthy than if it had never been attacked by them  so there seem to be certain flaws in the moral conduct of some men which being well and effectually repaired set off the character with greater lustre and advantage than it could have appeared with had such imperfections never been discovered Was I worthy to prescribe to your Lordship the task would be no very hard one that I should set you it would be only to give your real sentiments of Dr  Bentley  's merit and I am persuaded they would turn out the most complete recantation of what you have now been pleased to amuse us with that could be wished for  I have entered thus circumstantially into this matter not with a design to aggravate your Lordship's offence but to extenuate my own Censure which falls from you my Lord falls from a great height especially when the defenceless  object upon whom it is directed is unhappily laid so low  You will now permit me to transcribe the sentence of which I complain I find it in your th page I mention the page because for the allusion it bears to any part of your subject it might as well be sought for in any other leaf of the book The paragraph is addressed to  Bishop W  and runs thus  "And here more opportunely for the illustration of what I am saying than for your own purpose you introduce  the incomparable Bentley  as standing in the foremost rank of modern critics of grammatical and verbal critics I agree with you he could judge with great penetration of the age of an author by the dialect the phrase and the matter by Thericlean cups and Sicilian talents this  was his proper sphere of science and in this he excelled but in matters of pure taste a fine discernment of the different characters of composition colours of style and manners of thinking of interior beauties and excellencies of writing in regard to all this what was he  Unus caprimulgus aut fossor  What then has he to do here"  Ay what indeed Your Lordship has asked a question which I really cannot easily resolve and but that you have prevented me in it the very question I should have taken the liberty of putting to your Lordship  For what answer can we give Is it to be thought that you conceive this sovereign contempt of Dr  Bentley  's taste and genius from an acquaintance with his works with his  It is proposed to publish a new edition of these works in a short time  original works  I mean for although a great and elegant genius will break forth even when employed in the under work of criticism and exposition as witness your Lordship's learned labours on the Hebrew poesy yet undoubtedly it is in compositions of an original sort where the proper estimate of the genius of an author is to be formed Let me then with all due respect demand of your Lordship from which of the original productions of Dr  Bentley  's pen is it that you have collected these very unfavourable sentiments concerning him In which of his labours have you traced the brutal ignorance of a  goatherd  the clownish stupidity of a  hedger and ditcher  Indeed my good Lord these are hard words worse by one half than you bestowed upon the prophet  Ezra  who escaped your satire with the appellation only of a  semibarbarian  Could you have given worse language to a  country curate at a visitation Is your Lordship sure that these expressions are perfectly elegant and perfectly true are they fit for one scholar one gentleman one Christian divine to bestow upon another do they give us any impression of your Lordship's manners of your wit or of your judgment The virtues of your heart my Lord and the purity of your morals will support your character with the present age but it must be the productions of your understanding that are to establish your reputation with posterity How therefore could you think of transmitting to afterages an opinion which mankind will be sure to charge to the error either of your head or of your heart What provocation can you have received from Dr  Bentley  's genius that you should liken it to that of boors and peasants I don't know my Lord what kind of licence you men of learning take in speaking  of each other but we who act in common life and have common understandings stare at such familiarities a certain cautious principle which your Lordship seems to hold in disregard called prudence and a small degree of worldly virtue in which your Lordship 'tis plain on some occasions does not abound called goodmanners teach us to smother and repress these sallies of spleen and illnature if not from natural principle yet from the dread of that humiliating correction which expressions of so offensive a nature would be apt to incur These my Lord are amongst the checks and restraints that civilize society I don't mean to apply them to the case in question I believe and by your Lordship's example am convinced that other rules and principles obtain in the republic of letters every thing there breathes an unrestrained freedom of manners affronts are mutually interchanged  and challenges are publicly given and accepted by the gravest and most respectable characters nothing however shall persuade me that this is not ridiculous and unbecoming I cannot see  Professors  dignified Divines and  Bishops  tilting at each other without a blush 'tis this unpardonable petulancy that makes the company of men of learning so little sought after it reduces literary science to the rank of a mechanical art when the scholar is found to give way to as many little mean detracting insinuations in his profession as a  Fidler  or a  Taylor  does in his For my own part such is my prejudice against envy and illnature and so great is the respect that I bear to candour and complaisance that altho' I have your Lordship's example before my eyes still I cannot be persuaded that invidious aspersions lessening comparisons and calumnious railings are any proofs of liberal education or of an  elegant improved understanding and this I can tell your Lordship that if you had not expressly ay and in capital letters asserted  Page  THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD to have been the place of your education the seat where you first sacrificed to the muses and to the graces it might really to future ages have been just matter of doubt in what one spot of this globe your Lordship had imbibed those elegant and friendly manners which run through the whole of your disputations with Bishop  W  and are particularly marked out in the character you have given of Dr  Bentley  a character in which you have apparently a double intent not only to undeceive the world with respect to any false opinions we might have taken up concerning his understanding but to give us at the same time a just impression of your own for where would be the  use of exposing Dr  Bentley  's egregious deficiency in all the polite accomplishments of a scholar if you did not thereby tacitly inform mankind that Dr  L th  was eminently endowed with them all This my Lord of all the roads which lead to fame is the shortest and easiest ascent 'tis following the camp without mixing in the fray  That men born in the same country cultivators of the same science professing the same religion fellowlabourers in the same ministry should invidiously defame and disparage each other in the eyes of mankind is a mystery to men of ordinary capacities If a  Caprimulgus  my Lord a low and paltry  Herdsman  should set about to underrate the talents of a rival in that rustic occupation if a  Fossor  a vulgar untaught  Hedger and Ditcher  should attempt to disparage the handywork of a fellowlabourer such  lowbred dealings in clowns might find some excuse but when we see the same mean passions carried into upper life and exhibited by a man of your Lordship's talents and erudition we blush for you for your profession for your title we feel an ingenuous shame for the disreputation which is brought upon learning nay even upon our country and we sigh when we can no longer esteem a character like your Lordship'sfor surely my Lord you forget how much you expose your own fame when you endeavour to blind and to blacken that of Dr  Bentley  's  The treatment the world has thought proper to bestow upon critics in general suits its gratitude it is owing to the labours of the eminent in that department that almost any of the now elegant remains of Greek and Roman literature are at this day intelligible the moment they were so the weapons they were so kind to  polish for our use have been employed against themselves a run therefore upon criticism in general is become too trite to be any longer a subject of complaint but the pulling down the fame of the dead though reared by the approbation of the learned of all Europe must be ungenerous however severe a provocation may be supposed to be concealed in a man's having been called  incomparable  by the  Bishop of G  The lot of Dr  B  has been particular as his character is at present arraigned by your Lordship his condition has in like manner been debased in the  Biographia Britannica  from that of a gentleman to a mean tradesman this misrepresentation may perhaps have had a share in inducing your Lordship to bestow upon him the delicate epithets which you was sure from  Catullus  were good Latin and from the authority of an uninformed modern historian  you imagined were justly applicable to his supposed birth  But I just now desired your Lordship to resolve me in which of Dr  Bentley  's original works it was that you had discovered such convincing marks of the meanness and contemptible rusticity of his genius was it in his declamations from the pulpit that he betrayed this utter ignorance of  the beauties and excellencies of writing  Did ever  Herdsman  from his observations on nature and the fabric and construction of man argue up to the divine author and creator of all things with such strength of reasoning such convictive eloquence as are to be found in his  Lectures  Did ever  Hedger and Ditcher  give such edifying such satisfactory  Reasons for the Hope and the Faith that was in him  as are given in his famous  Commencement Sermon  Many clowns my Lord it must be confess'd  have preached before kings and still continue to preach but does Dr  Bentley  's sermon before the king impeach him of inurbanity surely not and it will be hard to think with your Lordship that the same person who was capable of composing in so good a style himself should be incapable of forming any judgment with respect to that of another man's I flatter myself therefore I may conclude that it is not in the pulpit your Lordship will arraign Dr  Bentley  it is not for his labours in the cause of religion the instruction of mankind and the confutation of atheism that your Lordship so conspicuous for merits of the same nature means to degrade and disgrace his memory I may say for him what Bishop  W  pleaded for himself  Page  "that his services to religion and society seem to entitle him to common respect from every man of letters  engaged in the same cause  where no personal animosities have intervened  "  And as your Lordship in describing your own character has professed yourself to be  "  Page  as a member of the commonwealth of letters a true lover of peace and quietness of mutual freedom  candour and benevolence  and that you detest and despise the squabbles that are perpetually arising from the jealousy and peevishness of the  genus irritabile scriptorum  "  I will venture to conclude that you have not taken up this contemptuous opinion of his understanding and abilities from the services he has done to religion and the instructions he has bequeathed to mankind  But my Lord this is not all I have some little matter more to offer in defence of his mangled reputation some  few remarks more to make upon his services in the cause of God and of religion I hope these will not be taken for tokens of his want of understanding The confutation of atheism seems an easy and obvious task a work for real  herdsmen  and  hedgers  every object proves the existence of the Deity and every rational being comprehends that proof but  Bentley  like a hardy obstinate clown as he was undertook a bolder task this ignorant unpolished peasant undertook my Lord to confute and expose the fine gentlemen of his age the wits and reasoners of the time the set of  Freethinkers  that unhinged the age in which he lived and threw the whole bench of bishops your Lordship was not then amongst the number into consternation and dismay In this dilemma my Lord when the whole army of Protestant Divines mitred and unmitred like that of  Saul  upon the challenge of  Goliath    trembled behind their trenches this despicable herdsman this booby boor taken like  David  from the sheepfolds entered the lists and singly overthrew the mighty champion of infidelity The triumphs of Christianity upon this victory were only to be equalled by the applauses which every true believer bestowed upon their defender The whole bench of bishops honoured Dr  Bentley  with their thanks Behold the revolution of a few years  Bentley  dies your Lordship succeeds to a seat on that bench you dissent from your predecessors and tear their trophies from his shrine  Let me stop here for a moment I would fain preserve all possible respect for your Lordship and must not therefore pursue my thoughts where they would lead me on this subject But really if men of your order who are enlisted and banded together against the  legions that make war upon Christianity cannot withhold your fingers from each others throats how can the general cause of religion prosper How must the spirits of the modern  Freethinkers  revive when your Lordship tells them and the world that he who had cut their follies to the heart by the keen edge of his most piercing ridicule was a man void of  all pure taste  and genius incapable of any  fine discernment  blind to all the  beauties and excellencies of writing  a mere  grammatical and verbal critic  in short  unus caprimulgus aut fossor  This my Lord is pity to the fallen indeed it is binding up their wounds yet bleeding with his strokes it is recalling them to life and vigour putting arms into their hands and pointing out the victim against whom they should employ them methinks it puts me in mind of the call of  Lucifer  to  his troops of rebelangels when they lay prostrate and confounded in the burning gulph no doubt they will like them obey the summons and arise  The policy therefore of this conduct of your Lordship's I cannot comprehend the generosity the urbanity of it I have already considered suffer me now to carry my enquiries into the truth of it  What my Lord will you allow the author of  The Remarks  no place but amongst  grammatical and verbal critics  will you expel him from the society of liberal and wellaccomplished scholars was he fit for no higher uses than like a juggler to play with  Thericlean cups and Sicilian talents  was this  his proper sphere of science  and did he really  excel  in nothing higher are there no sparks  of genuine Attic wit no sallies of native humour no polished strokes of temperate and cleanly ridicule not such I mean as your Lordship's pleasantries upon the  sin of Sodom  to be found in that work are there really no dawnings of  a pure taste  no shadowings of a  discerning  faculty to be found your Lordship says noHe possessed them notHe was a clown a clumsy blockheadWhat an error have the learned of all the nations in Europe been in  Surely my Lord without disparaging your Lordship's learned labours these were works as profitable to mankind and as serviceable to religion as determining the aera in which the poem of  Job  call it  drama  or  dialogue  was composed your Lordship sees I give you credit for having actually decided that important question and am willing to allow you  the reputation of having from  "  a fine discernment of the different characters of composition colours of style and manners of thinking  "  made such nice discoveries in a language of which there is now extant but one volume as not only to have been able to fix the date of this poem the  Page  Homer  of the Hebrew classics but to have pointed out to posterity the  Augustan aera of Hebrew poesy  though you readily allow there was  Page  very little variation in the language from the time of Moses to the Babylonish captivity    But to convince your Lordship with what reluctance I yield to any impressions in disfavour of that  candour and benevolence  which you assure us are to be found in such plentiful portions in your composition I will confess that I am far from thinking we have as yet discovered the cause that ruined Dr  Bentley  in  your good opinion the laurels he won by his triumphs over atheism and infidelity I am persuaded would neither have attracted your envy nor incurred your illwill I dare believe your Lordship is far too considerate in your resentments to abuse any man when there is no prospect of serving yourself by it or gratifying your friends but in the lawful prosecution of one's fortune when by making one enemy we can gain two patrons your Lordship understands the value of the world's favour too well and the road that leads to it to hesitate a moment and if Dr  Bentley  's fame has been one round in the ladder by which your Lordship has climbed to the summit of preferment  "  Scelera ipsa nefasque  "  Hac mercede placent  "  There is no harm done my Lord the ladder is not one whit the worse for your use 'tis only brushing the step clean again which your foot has soiled a little and it will be as whole and as sound as when you first mounted upon it  I think therefore we may venture to draw this conclusion that had this object of your contempt been blessed with such faculties as to have reasoned all  Atheism  and  Deism  effectually out of fashion and put to perpetual silence every professor of infidelity had he taken the whole walk of criticism to himself and filled our shelves with notes comments and corrections upon every antient classic that has come down to us he might have done it with impunity perhaps with applause had he but spared a certain club of wits who sucked the milk of science from the same breasts  at which it seems your Lordship fed With these confederates your Lordship well knows he singly maintained a notable controversy with every advantage on his side that superior talents for wit learning and argumentation could give him If your Lordship doubts which party triumphed in this dispute you are the only man of erudition in all Europe that does but this I dare say is by no means the case You could have pitied him but you cannot find in your heart to applaud him facts press so hard upon you that you have no argument but the last refuge of a flat denial and the superiority of his genius is so very conspicuous that nothing now can be done but by a resolute and desperate manoeuvre to assail him in that quarter where he is conceived to be least vulnerable and consequently least expecting an attack In some circumstances every thing is to be  risked deny him therefore every faculty for which he was most eminent and though the very same business which gives your Lordship the inclination to abuse him furnishes the amplest refutation of that abuse be animated by the hazard of the attempt and make if possible the cradle of his reputation the tomb of it The difficulty of finding an answer to your Lordship's question at the conclusion of your character of Dr  Bentley  now entirely vanishes and when after having bestowed every term that your fertile imagination assisted besides by that of  Catullus  could furnish most contemptuous you ask  "  What then has he to do here  "  we are no longer without a solution and having now discovered the clue to your thoughts and being fully satisfied that your Lordship never dignifies an author with your abuse whom you are not secretly convinced is eminent  for those very qualifications that you publicly declare him to be deficient in we thankfully accept your reprehensions as a testimony of your private applause which though it is not indeed signified in so gracious a manner as it might be yet we hold it of much value from the certainty with which it directs us to the real sentiments of your heart  Having thus happily discovered the method of decyphering your Lordship's invectives I am not without suspicion that the same key must be applied for construing your applauses What strengthens this conjecture is that those talents which you are pleased to take from Dr  Bentley  you liberally bestow upon  Page  Mr  Hobbes    According to this rule of inversion how shall we my Lord interpret the  many fine things you tell us of yourself such as that  "you are a true lover peace and quietness of mutual freedom candour and benevolence that you detest the jealous and peevish squabbles of authors"  These are virtues which upon your Lordship's report we gave you credit for it would be with extreme reluctance we should find ourselves obliged to carry them to the other side of the account  But these are groundless apprehensions You have favoured the world with a faithful portrait of yourself however you have dawbed and disguised those of other people I have at this time your letter to the  Demonstrator of the Divine Legation of Moses  before me and I hold it for impossible that the author of any work so full of pleasant and innocent raillery so replete with playful and facetious  conceits can be capable of wrath rancour and malevolence Can any thing be more lively than the strain in which you accost your  Right Reverend correspondent  in the second page of your epistle  "  I thought  " says your Lordship "  you might possibly whip me at the cart's a  " I beg pardon I should have said "  carts tail in a note to Divine Legation  "  Inimitable humour courtly elegant episcopal wit so severe upon Bishop  W  so very just and suitable to yourself never did I know a  whipping  better laid on or more properly applied But behold another attitude  "  Or pillory me in the Dunciad  "  Surely there is something ravishingly delectable when a grave wise and dignified priest or  prelate  like your Lordship surprises one all at once with a stroke of this nature there is no withstanding itBut your vein is not yet exhausted  and you proceed  "  or perhaps have ordered me a kind of Bridewell correction by one of your Beadles in a pamphlet  "  Well I protest my Lord this climax of yours exceeds in profundity of false humour every thing that  Swift  has given us in his  Art of Sinking  We laugh indeed but it is not a Bishop  W  you ask us to an entertainment provided in his name while your Lordship obligingly pays the whole cost These postures in which you have exhibited yourself before us put me in mind of the freaks of a  Merry Andrew  who suffers himself to be kicked and cuffed and tweaked by the nose to make sport for the mob while the vile empiric imposes upon them his nostrums and quackeries the paltry sweepings of the counters for universal panacea's When we expected some solemn sententious reproof from the learned and pious  Prelector  on the  Hebrew  Poesy  out comes all  Bartlemy Fair  let loose upon us at once and we see your Lordship  whipt at the cart's tail posted up in the pillory flogged by the Beadles of Bridewell caned by Bishop W's  Page  footman hunted and waylaid by his  ibid  Cherokees and Iroquois  and at length good man  exhibited on a  Page  Scaffold erected on purpose for you and in the most conspicuous place  How much you must have profited by your studies on the book of Job this example of your patience demonstrates but what agreeable company to introduce us into and you seem so sociable and intimate with them  Footmen  and  Bumbailiffs Beadles Constables Hangmen  and  wild Indians  Edifying society elegant allusions taste that savours of the kennels of  Saint Giles  's jests that would put the  Ordinary  of  Newgate  to the blush and wit the genuine offspring  not of  Athens  but of the  Ola Bailey  Now my Lord would I venture to undergo all the discipline your Lordship has run through if that old cynic Dr  Bentley  would have stirred a muscle of his face to laughter at all this pleasantryNo no he had no taste or capacity but for  hedging and ditching and milking of Goats  not a syllable of all this would he have comprehended In  matters of  such  pure taste  as your Lordship has now given us a sample of  compositions  of a  character  so different from any he ever had been used to  style  of a  colour  so directly opposite to his own and a  manner of thinking  so utterly unlike that of any gentleman who ever thought at all I do allow and am persuaded he would not have shown the least shadow of  discernment    For this however I do seriously and from the ground of my heart thank your Lordship again and again  viz  that when you informed the world of his utter want of taste your consented to give us so fair a specimen of your own But your railleries are not confined to yourself only you are wonderfully pleasant upon the patriarchs Your arch insinuations about  Page  Abraham  's offering his son  Isaac  are infinitely facetiousI was so ignorant as to consider this as a circumstance of a most serious and edifying nature an exalted instance of the most perfect faith in God and obedience to his word and a sacred type of our Redeemer's death and passion selected as the passage of scripture best suited to our  Good Friday  's meditation I have been apt therefore to think and to speak of this act of the patriarch's with reverence and devotion  Your Lordship treats it with the levity of a  Milesian Fable  and puts some arch queries upon the matter relative to  the sin of Sodom  This  sin of Sodom  it seems has been a sort of stumblingblock to your Lordship and you tell us you have hunted after it  Page  from the beginning of the Bible to the end  The search might be useful though the object of it was not the most worthy I hope my Lord you was not equally inquisitive when you turned to your  Catullus  in search of those reproachful terms  Caprimulgus aut Fossor  to bestow them upon Dr  Bentley  Had you ransacked that author through as you did the Bible every leaf would have furnished you with descriptions of the  sin of Sodom  As good luck will have it you have carried us into one of his cleanliest poems and as your quotation put me upon reading it over I really thought I traced the features of your  Lordship as strongly marked out in the picture of  Suffenus  as you conceived you did those of Dr  Bentley  for this  Suffenus  says the  Vide Cat ex rec Is Voss page  poet  Homo est venustus et dicax et urbanus  Idemque longe plurimos facit versus  * * *  neque idem unquam  Aeque est beatus ac poema quum scribit  Tom gaudet in se tamque se ipse miratur  The moral with which the epigram concludes I more particularly recommend to your Lordship  Nimirum idem omnes fallimur neque est quisquam  Quem non in aliqua re videre Suffenum  Possis suus quoique adtributus est error  Sed non videmus manticae quid in tergo est  But I have detained your Lordship long time and hasten to conclude my self  My Lord  your Lordship's most obedient humble Servant A MEMBER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE
