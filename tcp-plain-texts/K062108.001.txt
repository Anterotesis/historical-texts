 EUPHEMIA  BY Mrs  CHARLOTTE LENNOX  IN FOUR VOLUMES  VOL I  LONDON PRINTED FOR T CADELL IN THE STRAND AND J EVANS PATERNOSTERROW  M DCC XC  EUPHEMIA  LETTER I MISS HARLEY TO MRS NEVILLE  ONE of the greatest pleasures I proposed to myself on my return to England was to meet my dear Euphemia to bind if possible in faster bands that tender friendship which has united us from our earliest years to live in sweet society together to suffer only short absences rendered tolerable by frequent letters and the dear hope of meeting soon again But how are these expectations destroyed You are going to leave me and too probably for ever I  Long tracts of land and an immeasurable ocean will soon divide us I shall hear from you once or twice in a year perhaps my dear Euphemia will be lost to me and all that now remains of that friendship which was the pride and happiness of my life will be the sad remembrance of a good I once enjoyed but which is fled for ever  HOW shall I teach my heart to forget you How shall I bear the conversation of other young women of our age and condition after being used to yours It was some merit to be capable of tastn g it with so high a relish as to render that of my other companions insipid There are friendships that serve only to pass away the time and soften the tediousness of solitude but yours besides being delightful was profitable I never read your letters but I brought away pleasures that remained and advantages that did you no hurt I grew rich by what I took from you without  impoverishing you by my gain In a word I was happy and I am so no more I must lose you there is no remedy My tears efface my letters as I write I cannot I would not restrain them The wise may call these tender feelings infirmities of the mind if they will I do not wish to be without them and I had rather have my malady than their health  BUT tell me my Euphemia by what strange fatality have all these things happened When I went to France I left you rich and happy the reputed heiress of a large fortune both your beloved parents alive and every prospect brightening before you What a reverse in the space of a few months An orphan your inheritance lost married and in consequence of that marriage becoming an exile from your country doomed to waste your days in America I cannot bear to think of it But you go with a husband you love I never  thought my Euphemia very susceptible of that passion Mr Neville undoubtedly must possess an uncommon share of merit to have so soon conquered your indifference your reserve and if I may now venture to say so your indisposition to the married state Oh had it been otherwise with what pleasure should I have communicated to you the happy change in my fortune a fortune which by sharing with you I should have doubly enjoyed I cannot enter into particulars now my mind is too much agitated Write to me soon yet what can you say to comfort me If you cannot say that you are not to quit England it will be the first of your letters that I shall not receive with transport Adieu my everdear Euphemia  MARIA HARLEY  LETTER II MISS HARLEY TO MRS NEVILLE IN CONTINUATION  MY DEAR EUPHEMIA  I Cannot let the post go away without giving you the particulars of that happy change in my fortune which while my heart was so full of your loss that I could utter nothing but complaints I only hinted at but you would have reason to be offended with me if I was silent on this subject knowing so well as I do the tender interest you take in whatever concerns me  YOU never could be persuaded to think that my uncle's marriage with Miss Fenwick would make any alteration in his conduct towards me having brought me up with a tenderness and care that supplied the loss of my parents  a loss which I could only know by reflection being but an infant when they died and which the kindness of my uncle made it impossible for me to feel But in this you was mistaken my dear friend Lady Harley was a true stepmother and contrived to alienate my uncle's affection from me by artifices which imposed upon us both I will give you two or three instances of her plan of operations as they have been since explained to me  MY uncle who really loved me and viewed all my actions in a favourable light was particularly pleased with a certain attention which prevented his wishes and made him perceive that I was delighted when I could be useful to him There is nothing so necessary as to know how to bear tedious moments My uncle did not possess this art he is as you know a man of sense and some learning but having passed the greatest part of his life in the common track of  men of fortune and fashion his amusements must come all from without he knew not how to strike out any for himself from resources which a mind more cultivated might have afforded him  SOME time after his marriage the gout began to visit him with periodical  he bore the pain and the confinement with much impatience Lady Harley whose fondness for him always appeared excessive rather tired than relieved him by her importunate caresses which however he received without any apparent peevishness for to be sure he knew how to value a love so tender and passionate with which he had inspired a woman twenty years younger than himself  MY company was now more acceptable than my aunt's I sung I played to him I gave the rein to my natural vivacity and endeavoured to divert him by a thousand lively sallies of imagination  I read to him sometimes and perceived with great satisfaction that he began to acquire a taste for this amusement My voice and manner pleased him He had a wellstored library and he approved my choice of the books which were to furnish out his entertainment You will easily imagine how much this taste for reading increased upon him when I tell you that I read all Plutarch's Lives to him in less than a fortnight Thus this long fit of the gout passed away during which my aunt had time to make observations on her own insufficiency on such occasions and my apparent superiority over her A second attack of the gout gave her an opportunity to practise some of those artifices which she had imagined in order to lessen my uncle's regard for me She redoubled her cares and assiduity she scarce ever left him a moment she watched his looks and every turn of his distemper with such an anxious solicitude as if her life depended upon his  She would rise several times in the night and run into his chamber to know if he slept and if the nurse was attentive A thousand things of this kind she did which left me fond as I was of my uncle far behind her in these outward testimonies of affection  IT is common for people to judge of friendship by the shew it makes without considering that superstition is fuller of ceremonies than true devotion My attentions appeared cold and constrained compared with those of my aunt and were received with indifference My uncle now seldom desired me to read and when I offered to take a book he would ask me if I did not think reading so much had hurt me I sometimes smiled at this and he would add with a significant look  Reading aloud is not good for one who has weak lungs  'That is not my case Sir' replied I 'I am glad of it' said he coldly  but however you shall not read to  me  I was quite confounded at this peremptory refusal and knew not what to say to him but though vexed and mortified to the last degree I suffered no complaints to escape me because I was not willing to discompose my uncle or gratify the malice of Lady Harley who I judged was at the bottom of this peevishness in him and I judged right for this was the manner in which she effected her purpose as my uncle afterwards informed me  ONE day when he desired her to bid me come and read to him she regretted her not having equal talents with me for that employment'Which if I had' said she I should not be afraid of falling into a consumption by using them' 'Why has Mari  that notion' said Sir John 'She certainly has' said my aunt  but you must not mention to her what I tell you She complains of a pain in her breast of shortness of breath and declares that when she has  read to you an hour or two she feels as if she was ready to expire with a strange oppression and faintness She has carried her apprehensions so far as to send her case to an eminent physician whose answer is that if she continues to read aloud she will fall into a decline  MY uncle was amazed and confounded at hearing this for I never looked better in my life and he took notice of that circumstance Lady Harley assured him I was perfectly well and in very good spirits 'And therefore' added she  it is the more surprizing that she should give way to such strange fancies  MY aunt followed this first blow with many others of the same kind which would be tedious to enumerate so that at length my uncle viewing all my actions in an unfavourable light set me down in his mind as a perfect hypocrite a character  which he ever despised and hated But although in consequence of this opinion he withdrew his affection from me yet as it produced no other alteration in his behaviour than a certain coldness and reserve which rather increased than lessened that politeness which was so natural to him I knew not on what ground to build a complaint My expences were as liberally supplied as before my requests as readily granted My uncle as he has since told me could never be brought to hate his brother's daughter though he ceased to love me as his own  BEING in this unfavourable disposition towards me he was easily persuaded to press me to a marriage in which my inclinations were much less consulted than my interest You know the man I refused my dear Euphemia and you did not chide me for my disobedience My however was offended and as I was absolutely incapable of repairing my  fault or even repenting of it his continued displeasure gave me so deep a concern that my situation became very miserable  MRS Irwin was about this time preparing to go to the south of France for the recovery of her health as she was a near relation of my mother's and a very worthy woman I asked and obtained leave to attend her I left England without any regret but parting with you my sweet friend for my uncle appeared so happy in the passionate tenderness of his young wife and so compleatly estranged from me that I could not suppose my absence would give him any uneasiness He provided for my expences however with his usual generosity When I took leave of him my tears and the ardour with which I kissed his hand seemed to awaken some tender emotions for he turned aside and wiped his eyes but immediately afterwards as if hardened by some unfavourable  recollection he relapsed into his former coldness and took a much more ceremonious than kind leave of me My aunt acted her part extremely well regretted the loss of my company and comforted herself with the hope of a happy meeting in a few months Mrs Irwin was amazed at the ascendant Lady Harley had gained over a man of my uncle's good sense 'This woman' said she  will as the poet says  Mould his passions till she makes his will  But it is my opinion that your excursion to the Continent will prove less favourable to her machinations than your stay here With friends and lovers absence is a kind of Death which sheds oblivion over faults and heightens every virtue and amiable quality Lady Harley will now miss a thousand opportunities of hurting you with your uncle which artifice on her side and innocent security on yours would have furnished her with  if you had staid here  It is certain that the fine fabrick she had raised with such an expence of falshood was destroyed on a sudden by means which she could neither foresee nor prevent  WITH what pleasure do I turn from this dark side of my fortune to one in which my dear Euphemia will share in my satisfaction But what do I say My Euphemia is going to leave me This thought like the stings of a guilty conscience saddens all my enjoyments and when I should be happy gives me up to tears and complainings But you wilt chide me if I continue this strain Adieu my dear friend  IN my next you shall have a full account of all that remains for you to know concerning my present situation Mean time pity ray impatience my anxiety and explain to me the causes of this sad reverse of fortune and all that has happened to you in a separation  of a few months and which alas is so soon to be followed by one of many years But I will fly this thought Adieu  MARIA HARLEY  LETTER III MRS NEVILLE TO MISS HARLEY  WHY does my dear Maria imagine I would chide her for a sensibility so amiable in her so flattering to me who am the object of it Am I qualified to recommend apathy to you who share so deeply with you in an affliction that is common to us both and while my heart is still smarting with a wound which never never can be healed You knew my mother Maria you knew her excellence judge what my grief must be for her loss But she is happy her patientsuffering virtue has it's just reward  So little do events depend upon the most prudent measures that had she lived to see the unprosperous event of a marriage which was her own work and from which in her last moments she owed all her consolation with regard to me she  would have been miserable Heaven spared her this affliction and did not self mingle too frequently in our most justifiable passions I should not now grieve so much for her death as rejoice in her exemption from an evil which she might not perhaps have borne with her usual fortitude But you shall have my history from the time of our separation and an eventful one it is for the time I have leisure enough and to rehearse the past when the present is unhappy and the future presents only a gloomy prospect is not so irksome a task as to make me decline obeying you  SCARCE were my tears dried up for your sudden and unexpected departure when a surprizing alteration in the temper and behaviour of my father filled my mother and myself with the most uneasy apprehensions He became peevish melancholy silent and reserved he shunned company staid much  at home and passed the greatest part of his time shut up in his closet and was inaccessible even to my mother who certainly was not even then wholly ignorant of the cause of this great change in him A stroke of the palsy followed these first symptoms and compleated our distress It was but slight however and by the great skill and care of his physicians he was restored to some degree of health and able to take a journey to Bath which they judged necessary to his perfect recovery I never doubted but I should be permitted to attend him thither as well as my mother but my father had resolved otherwise I durst not dispute his will tender and affectionate as he always seemed to me he exacted and never failed to receive an implicit obedience to it Spare me the description of this sad parting My father as he turned from me shed tears which he endeavoured to hide I had thrown myself into the arms of my governess but raising my head to snatch a parting glance as he stepped into the coach at  that moment he appeared to me more like a corpse than my living father I shrieked and fainted away My dear mother who had taken every precaution to make this absence more supportable to me directed my governess to carry me immediately to Richmond where I was impatiently expected by Mrs Highmore and her family with whom I was to reside till my parents returned from Bath You know this lady my dear Maria you know how greatly she was esteemed by my mother whose confidence she had acquired by the appearance of an uncommon attachment to her She had daughters of an age fit to be my companions and their birth and accomplishments made them very proper ones  DURING our little journey Mrs Burton employed every soothing art to alleviatemy grief but that image that deathlike image of my father filled my imagination and swam continually before my  sight I was for a long time insensible to all the caresses of Mrs Highmore and the young ladies which were indeed carried to excess particularly on the part of Mrs Highmore and the eldest daughter but I was more touched with the behaviour of Lucy the youngest of these ladies whose professions of friendship for me had an air of candour and sweetness which won my confidence and engaged my gratitude  THE first letter I received from my mother gave me so favourable an account of my father's health that my melancholy apprehensions began to abate and I was once more able to mix in society and to share in those amusements which the family were eager to procure for me This attention apparently so obliging would certainly have made an impression upon me if I had not been disgusted with the adulation which Mrs Highmore and her eldest daughter were perpetually pouring in my ears I have  heard it said that it is a mark of grandeur to be hated by those who do not know us and flattered by those who do a young woman of fortune has this in common with royalty that she seldom hears truth My governess would have it that Mrs Highmore had some design upon me and her suspicions were strengthened by a visit made her by her son a youth of nineteen from college though it was not vacationtime  THE young gentleman had probably received orders to be violently in love with me for he seemed to court opportunities of speaking to me alone which I believe were often contrived for him but he was too bashful to profit by them as was expected for after some general conversation about the weather he used to withdraw to a window and whistle a tune His behaviour might have afforded me some diversion had my mind been more at case but now every letter from Bath brought me still less favourable  accounts of my father's health At length the fatal news of his death arrived which not with standing the caution that was used the melancholy looks of my governess and the rest of the family announced to me before the tender Lucy whose sad task it was to prepare me for this stroke could utter a word 'My father is dead' cried I trembling 'Is it not so' Lucy answered me only by her tears  Then I have seen him' said I 'for the last time and the last time I saw him he looked as he is now  I CONTINUED several days in a most melancholy situation during which time the family took part in my affliction with an appearance of the most tender sympathy they shut themselves up with me and neither paid nor received any visits each solicitous to outdo the other in endeavouring to calm my grief On a sudden this attention ceased they saw company as usual and their engagements  both at home and abroad took up their time so much that they had scarce a few moments to bestow on me and I have sometimes passed a whole day without seeing them in my apartment The young man was sent back to college without leaving even a compliment for me A strange alteration now took place in their manner of conversing with me respect and adulation were no more their kindness was disgustingly familiar their pity humiliating and their civility constrained  ALL this passed unnoticed for some time but when the violence of my grief was in some degree abated my attention was awakened first to little neglects and failures in their usual politeness that led to a fuller observation of their behaviour towards me which I found so changed that they did not seem to be the same person with whom I had conversed so long Perplexed and astonished at what I now for the first time  discovered I asked my governess the meaning of this strange alteration  My dear  said she  you now see the world as it is and you will probably  added she sighing  have but too many opportunities of assenting to the truth of that maxim which seems to bear hard upon human nature but which is nevertheless but too true That the generality are bad  'Bu  Lucy' said I without taking in the full meaning of her words  Lucy is still the same she is not changed  At that moment the dear girl entered the room I flew into her arms and my heart being greatly oppressed I burst into tears She looked at Mrs Benson significantly as I afterwards recollected and then applied herself with her usual tender solicitude to console me My governess retired upon Mrs Highmore's coming in Why my good girl' said she to me  will you never have done grieving  Struck with the unusual coarseness of her phrase I stared at her without making  any answer 'Come' pursued she  you must not stay moping in the house take an airing in your chariot you may not always have one  Here Lucy in great agitation stopped her crying eagerly'Mamma' Mrs Highmore as if recollecting herself replied  You are right But Miss Lumley  said she to me  have you had a letter from your mamma How is she does she talk of returning    Would to Heaven I were with her  said I passionately 'Ah poor woman' said Mrs Highmore  she is in trouble enough she is greatly to be pitied  My tears now flowed afresh 'Pray Madam' said Lucy receiving my declining head on her bosom  leave me to comfort Miss Lumley she will be more calm when we are alone    Well I am going  said Mrs Highmore  Pray my good girl moderate your affliction And Lucy do you hear I cannot possibly dispense with your dining at table today I have company  you know You will hardly have time to dress  She went out of the room at these words and I with some peevishness pressed Miss Lucy to go and dress but she declared she would not quit me that day Mrs Benson being obliged to go to town to transact some business my mother had charged her with  I HAVE related this little scene circumstantially to you my dear Maria that you may have some notion of the astonishment I must be in at the alteration of this woman's stile and behaviour who a few weeks before had carried her respects and attentions to me even to servility But the mystery was soon to be unravelled  Two days after this Mrs Benson told me I should soon see my mother 'When' cried I impatiently  Tomorrow perhaps  said she smiling 'and perhaps tonight' I rose from  my chair in a transport  Ah she is here  said I 'let me fly to her' 'No my dear' said Mrs Benson  she is not here she would not come here but she is in London I have a note from her ordering me to bring you to her The chariot is getting ready and we will set out in a few minutes  Lucy came running to me all in tears I took an affectionate leave of her and received the parting civilities of Mrs Highmore and her eldest daughter with great coolness Mrs Highmore charged me to assure her good friend so she stiled my mother that it should not be long before she called upon her As supercilious as this speech was the air that accompanied it was still more so I answered only by a slight bow and we drove away  My thoughts wholly employed on the expected meeting with my dear mother a meeting at once so wished and dreaded prevented my taking notice of the  extreme dejection of Mrs Benson who scarce spoke to me all the way Nor was I rouzed from my reverie till I found myself in St James's Square when the carriage instead of crossing into Pall Mall where our house was drove directly to Charles Street and stopped at a small house upon the window of which I observed a bill for lodgings 'Have you any business here' said I to my governess 'My dear' replied she sighing  we shall find your mamma here  'My mamma here' cried I eagerly and springing out of the chariot I flew up stairs upon the top of which I saw her coming to meet me  HER deep mourning her pale and emaciated countenance the transient gleam of joy which the first sight of me occasioned effaced by a flood of tears affected me with such poignant anguish that I sunk down at her feet and clasping her knees remained there speechless and drowned in tears Mrs Benson  raised me and led us both into the room My dear mother continued gazing on me for some time in silent sorrow while I wept and kissed the hand with which she affectionately pressed mine 'My dear child' said she recovering herself  you have no doubt paid your just tribute of tears to the memory of your father The time calls upon us for fortitude You have alas many evils to struggle against Poverty is a more dreadful monster than any Hercules overcame and to bear it with patience to preserve our integrity our independence of mind in a word to fall with dignity is to be a greater hero than he was  AT the word Poverty I started and gazed on my mother eagerly  Yes my dear  pursued she  we are no longer rich you are no longer an heiress to a great fortune From the small provision your father made for me on our marriage before he succeeded to  his uncle's great riches and which will cease at my death we must for the future draw our subsistence Mr Lumley died insolvent Houses plate jewels furniture all are seized by the creditors This small apartment in which you now see me is my habitation and even this I must soon exchange for one less expensive and more suitable to my circumstances for it must be my part now to live in such a manner that my dear child may not be wholly destitute at my death Something I hope I shall be able by the strictest parsimony to leave behind me to put off the bad day of beggary  My mother could not restrain her tears at this word She rose up and said she would retire to her bedchamber for a few moments and endeavour to compose herself  WHEN she was gone I gave free vent to those emotions which respect and tenderness for her had hitherto restrained Mrs Benson endeavoured to comfort  me 'Tell me' said I  if you know tell me by what means this ruin was brought about    Your father  replied she  would have been a happy man if he had continued in that easy mediocrity which once bounded his wishes but no sooner was he become possessed of the great riches your uncle had acquired in the Indies than he plunged deep into all the fashionable excesses of the age  The word All she pronounced with a deep emphasis and a meaning look that went to my heart 'His seat in parliament' continued she  cost him an immense sum He played high and always with ill success In a word he was ruined my dear before the continued dissipation in which he lived gave him leisure to look into his affairs Reflection which came too late to prevent the wreck of his fortune now produced a remorse that preyed upon his mind and brought on those disorders which put a period to his life  MY mother's entrance obliged me to restrain those emotions which Mrs Benson's discourse had excited I dried my tears I endeavoured to console my mother by every soothing power I possessed Her piety and good sense had already brought her to a state of perfect resignation in every thing that respected herself it was for me only that she felt and it was to relieve her from that tender anxiety which preyed upon her spirits and destroyed her health that I made a sacrifice which I cannot repent of though alas it proved fruitless But here let me break off for the present I will continue my narrative some other time This free communication of my misfortunes to a dear and sympathizing friend seems to lessen their force  The grief that must not speak  Whispers the o'ercharg'd heart and bids it break  says my favourite poet I will go on then and speak to youBut my Maria  remember you must give me the remainder of your little history as soon as possible you will easily imagine how much I am interested in it Adieu my dear friend  EUPHEMIA NEVILLE  LETTER IV MISS HARLEY TO MRS NEVILLE  MY DEAR EUPHEMIA  I Have almost effaced every word of your tender and affecting narrative with my tears Alas my sweet friend what have you not suffered Why was I not with you during these hard trials Why did you conceal your situation from me I never received but two letters from you while I was in France In the last there were some obscure hints which greatly perplexed me and which you have now but too well explained My uncle expresses great tenderness and concern for you and speaks of your mother in terms of the highest admiration He says he was intimate enough with Mr Lumley to use the liberty of remonstrating against some of those errors in his conduct which have been  the source of his misfortunes 'But' added he very sententiously  there is a wide distance between being simply persuaded that a thing is wrong to the being sufficiently so as to make us fall to action when we must act contrary to our inclinations Mr Lumley acknowledged there was reason in what I said but did not alter his conduct  'How much easier' thought I  it is to be wiser for others than ourselves  Had your father represented to Sir John the imprudence of marrying at his years a gay young girl he might have made the same observation but this truth he was soon convinced of by his own experience  I HAD been near a year in France when I received a letter from my uncle very different from any of his former ones for it was extremely affectionate He expressed great uneasiness at my long absence and much impatience for my return This letter was accompanied  with a large order upon his banker at Paris whither we were now going and permission to stay there a month after which he said he would expect me and if his health permitted Lady Harley and he would meet me at He said not a word of those causes of uneasiness which he had given me for when do men own they are in the wrong but concluded with professions of the tenderest attachment to me You will easily conceive that after the receipt of this letter I passed my time very pleasantly at Paris when a few days before our intended departure I received another letter from my uncle it contained but a few lines and those surprized me with an account of the death of Lady Harley As I have not naturally a hard heart nor an unforgiving temper the death of this lady gave me a real concern particularly on my uncle's account who I supposed would be greatly afflicted Mrs Irwin agreed that this news ought to hasten our  journey and accordingly we set out immediately upon our return  MY uncle was surprized when he heard of my arrival so much sooner than he expected and I could perceive was pleased at my readiness to oblige him He received me very kindly and as I did not observe any signs of immoderate grief in his countenance my compliments of condolence were but short He mentioned my aunt only once and employed but a few words on the subject  Her illness  said he  was sudden and reached it's height before she was thought to be in any danger The faculty complained of her obstinacy in refusing to be bled and attributed her death to the want of that remedy  When my uncle took leave of me for the night he said  I will send Martin to you as soon as I am in bed he will inform you of some circumstances that have happened during your absence  I believe you have seen  this man an old confidential servant who had lived with him many years and who by his zeal and attachment merited the great regard he expressed for him  MY curiosity was strongly excited as well by my uncle's behaviour as by these words which seemed to indicate that something extraordinary had really happened As soon as the good old man appeared he congratulated me on my return with tears and assured me the tenants and servants had constantly prayed for it 'And they did not scruple' pursued he  to tell my lady herself how much they all longed to see you and this seemed to displease her for my lady was cunning by halves only and although she persuaded my master that she was grieved for your absence she did not take the same pains to deceive us  'SHE has certainly' said I  been less guarded on some occasion or other  than usual for my uncle is greatly altered with respect to her he appears not to regret her death and speaks of her with little affection  'AH Madam' said Mr Martin  there is good reason for that I have a curious history to relate to you if you can have the patience to hear it my master ordered me to tell you every circumstance  'Pray sit down' said I 'and let me have it all' He did so and here is what he told me and in his own words  'You may remember Madam' said he  how childishly fond my lady affected to be of her husband it was much worse after you was gone She was continually taking his hand stroking his cheek and would often kiss him before the servants I was sorry to see my good master so played upon and if I durst I would have told him that all was not gold that glisters  Mr Greville who you know Madam is a very facetious old gentleman and has a power of wit used to joke with my master about his young wife's prodigious fondness for him and would often say very  home  things which my master would sometimes take very well and sometimes answer peevishly to but they had been great friends from their youth so that it was not a little matter would part them Now it happened that my master was taken with another fit of the gout and grievous bad he was so that the doctors were afraid that it was getting up into his stomach and then you know Madam all would have been over with him My lady sat by his bedside almost continually sighing most piteously and shedding rivers of tears while she was with him but her maid used to say that when she was in her own apartment she had no need of an handkerchief to dry her eyes Well Madam my poor master grew worse  and worse and my lady to be sure more and more sorrowful And now my master resolved to alter his will you may guess Madam who put that into his head I was ordered to ride to town and fetch Lawyer Grasp and some more gentlemen of that  persuasion  I perceived what was going forward and to be sure Madam I thought a new will under my lady's direction would not be favourable to you and that it was fit some friend of yours should be present and no one was more proper than Mr Greville who loves you so dearly and was besides my master's most dear friend So I ventured to say to my master  Does not your honour please that I should send or go for Mr Greville upon this occasion  My lady looked as if she could have eat me and my master said weakly  Mr Greville is at his feat in that is more than seventy miles distant it will be too much trouble for him to  come on such short notice  "Sir" said I  I am sure he will not think so  My master seemed to pause upon it when my lady losing her temper quite called me an officious fool and bursting into tears said  Do you want to persuade your master that he is dyingMy dear Sir John the physicians assure me you are better Mr Greville will be here in a week or two Do not let this blockhead put such sad thoughts into your head  She sobbed violently while she was speaking holding my master's hand to her lips all the time My master then said  Let him go for the lawyers however  Upon which my lady looking very spitefully at me said"Do as you are ordered" and I left the room immediately with my heart full as well for my dear master's danger as for the injustice you were likely to suffer my dear young lady  I INTERRUPTED the honest man here to thank him for the affection he had shewn for me at a time when selfish policy would have pointed out a different conduct and I do assure you I thanked him with an effusion of heart equal to his own But I must break off here I am summoned to dinner My uncle has been riding this morning which has given me leisure to scribble so much he has brought Mr Greville home to dinner You cannot imagine how greatly I am obliged to this gentleman but you shall know all in my next My dear Euphemia adieu  MARIA HARLEY  THE post not being yet gone out I have time to add a few lines Something that fell from Mr Greville relating to you has alarmed me greatly I fear I fear my sweet friend you are not likely to be as happy in the married state as you deserve to be Your husband forgive  my freedom is thought to be illtempered you are all sweetness patience and condescension I foresee from this contrast continual encroachments on one side continual recedings on the other You are one of those few persons who never contest what they think they cannot obtain What a dangerous power will such a disposition throw into the hands of one who is disposed to use it tyrannically Mr Greville knows your husband and this is what he said upon my telling my uncle in answer to his enquiry how I had been amusing myself all the morning that I had been writing to you 'Poor Miss Lumley' said he  she is married to Mr Neville then There is nothing  a friend of mine said of himself and may be applied to her  that could persuade a believer in modern miracles to confess that any thing is impossible to be done but her ill fortune which is unchangeable  'I hope not' said my uncle 'There is no more room for hope' replied  Mr Greville  she is married to the worsttempered man in the world and that has crowned all her misfortunes  You may judge my dear Euphemia how I was affected by this discourse I asked a thousand questions about Mr Neville and every answer I received served to convince me that his temper will make you very miserable Good Heaven and is it with this man that you are to cross the Atlantic This the protector the friend the companion with whom you are to traverse an immense ocean and live in unknown regions far from your country and all you love Surely you can never consent to it he cannot be so unreasonable as to desire it If his duty calls him hence his tenderness for you ought to make him dispense with your accompanying him You must stay with me my dear Euphemia my fortune is yours my uncle will be a father to us both he offers you his house  for a retreat and me for your companion till your husband returns  I HAVE not time to add more Pray think on what I have proposed and the necessity there is for complying with it Once more adieu my dear friend  LETTER V MISS HARLEY TO MRS NEVILLE IN CONTINUATION  MY uncle is gone to spend a day or two with Mr Greville so I shall have full leisure for my pen which is never so pleasingly employed as when I am writing to my dear Euphemia Well Martin went on with his story which I shall continue to give you in his own words  Finding I was not permitted to send for Mr Greville in my master's name I resolved however to write to him and let him know what was going on and this I did before I set out for the lawyer's and put my letter myself into the post I was sorry to find Mr Grasp at home so there could be no delay on that side He told me he would call upon Counsellor Worden in his way and bring him with him  With this answer I returned My lady seemed not at all satisfied with the haste I had made and her woman told me she shewed great impatience and was very restless and uneasy all the time I was gone  WELL Madam the lawyers came at last they were shut up with my master several hours and my lady went backwards and forwards continually At last the chaplain and I were called up to witness this fine will the chaplain set his name but as Fortune would have it I had cut my right thumb so desperately about an hour before that I could not hold my pen so I was excused and Counsellor Worden's clerk signed instead of me and right glad was I that I had escaped this odious office  MY lady looked marvellously pleased when this affair was over that is when she was not in my master's chamber for there her countenance was like December  all cold and surly but all sunshine every where else  As I waited on the lawyers to their carriage I heard Counsellor Worden say to the attorney  Sir John's next heir will not thank him for burthening his estate with such an enormous jointure for so young a life as Lady Harley's And Miss Harley  said the attorney  has no reason to be pleased with the small provision that is made for her  They shook their wise heads at each other and smiled as much as to say  Somebody has played her cards well  Heaven forgive me but I could not help hating them a little for the part they had in making this will though to be sure they were no ways to blame you know Madam  "No certainly" said I  but I long to hear of my uncle's recovery methinks you leave him too long on this sick bed Mr Martin  'WHY Madam' replied the honest man  he grew better and better every day after this and was soon able to leave his bed and when Mr Greville came he found him walking about his chamber I had just time to tell Mr Greville all I knew of the matter and he was sorely grieved at it and lamented his not getting my letter sooner My lady complained much of what she had suffered during my master's illness  And yet you never looked better in your life Madam  said he dryly  if grief is such a friend to your complexion what will joy be Why your ladyship looks like May but I am sorry  said he turning to my master  to see my good friend here look so much like January  THERE was some joke in this I found for Mr Greville looked archly at my master who blushed and my lady seemed half pleased and half angry My lady's woman went tittering out of the  room and I followed curious to know what she laughed at "Oh Mr Martin" said she  if you had read as many books as I have you would know what that comical gentleman  luded  to Why there is a tale in rhyme about January an old knight who married a young lady called May and she made a fool of him and Mr Greville as good as called my master and lady January and Maythere was the jest Mr Martin  I WAS afraid the old man might have sported with this idea too far so I thought fit to look very grave upon which he recollected himself and went on  MR Greville staid several days at the Hall and during that time I believe he talked in a pretty home manner to my master for I observed that whenever they had had some private conversation my master would be in a musing mood a long time afterwards My  lady on these occasions always redoubled her fondness and Mr Greville used to cut his jokes without mercy At length he went away and now my lady having my master all to herself played all her old tricks over but not with the same success as formerly for my master though he recovered his health did not appear half so well pleased as usual and used to be often talking of you Madam and wishing for your return and at last he said he would write to you and insist upon your coming home immediately My lady was confounded and brought a great many bad reasons as my master told her to put him off this design and finding she could not prevail that way she fairly told him that your temper was so bad it was impossible to live with you and hereupon she cried bitterly  My master was not moved as she expected but seemed a little angry  and defended you Madam very cordially and in conclusion wrote to you and gave me the letter before her face to get it properly conveyed to you and glad was I of the office you may be sure After this his Honour was continually speaking of you and always in your praise so that my lady was sufficiently mortified  I HAVE often observed my dear Euphemia let a calumniator be ever so artful all that which does not directly hurt the persons abused turns to their advantage This charge of bad tempers appeared to my uncle so illfounded that it led him to weigh thoroughly many other faults she had accused me of and to compare my behaviour with the picture she used to draw of my disposition and the result of this candid investigation was so favourable for me that upon my return I had reason to believe I stood higher in his opinion  than ever as the sequel of my little History will shew you  BUT here I will conclude for the present a Letter from you is this moment brought me does it or does it not bring an answer favourable to my wishes I break the seal with eagerness Ah my dear Euphemia your first words destroy all my hopes Adieu  MARIA HARLEY  LETTER VI MRS NEVILLE TO MISS HARLEY  MY DEAR MARIA  DESTINED to live under the control of another I find obedience to be a very necessary virtue and in my case it is an indispensable duty I am a wife I know to what that sacred tie obliges me I am determined by Heaven's assistance to fulfil the duties of my station My lot is cast perhaps for misery here the future will be like the past so my foreboding heart suggests I have drawn a blank in the great lottery of life but there is a state beyond this in which my hopes aspire to a prize to that all my wishes all my endeavours tend Philosophy may teach us to bear the past and future evils but it is the Christian only that can endure the present with fortitude Oh my dear Maria  what could have supported me under my affliction for the death of my mother but that active faith which made resignation to the will of Heaven at once my duty and my reward I perceive all the hardships of my situation but I cannot avoid them without a crime it is my duty to follow my husband and what in other circumstances I should certainly have done from inclination I do now from better motivesfrom a sense of those sacred obligations which the state I have entered into lays upon me and which whatever mortifications I may meet with in the discharge of them are still indispensable  BUT how shall I thank you my dear friend for your kind and generous offers how shall I make you sensible of the gratitude that fills that more than fills that oppresses my heart for this proof of your friendship Words here are weak and deeds alas are not in my power for I am poor in every thing  but in will Do not however imagine my leaving this country such a misfortune except you I have nothing to regret for the unfortunate have few friends here every object reminds me of my former state and makes the present more sensibly felt Every place where I have seen my mother renews my grief for her loss Change of scene new objects and different cares may perhaps weaken this sad idea and restore me some degree of tranquillity Let this consideration reconcile you to my departure and though separated we will not be wholly absentour minds shall meet in conversea constant intercourse of letters shall bring us within view of each othershall communicate our joys and sorrows our hopes and fears and all the little as well as considerable events of our lives  I WILL make it a rule to retire every day to my closet for an hour at least to talk to you and every ship that sails  for England shall bring a packet from your Euphemia which shall leave you ignorant of nothing that concerns her Tell me Maria how you like this scheme and whether you can resolve to be as punctual in the performance of your part of it as I propose to be of mine meantime I will continue to give you a relation of such of my affairs as you are yet ignorant of but not in this letter which I dispatch immediately to bear my warmest acknowledgments for your most generous offers to acquaint you with my reasons for declining them and to share with you that comfort I derive from the plan I communicate Present my best respects and grateful thanks to your good uncle for his kind proposals and do not let me wait long for the rest of your History My curiosity is wound up to a very high pitch by what you have already related and I am charmed with the honest zeal and affecting simplicity of your humble friend I wait impatiently for the remainder  of his narration my griefs are all suspended while I read your letters and is not this a sufficient motive to make you hasten them to me Farewel my dear and most valuable friend  EUPHEMIA NEVILLE  LETTER VII MISS HARLEY TO MRS NEVILLE  MY DEAR EUPHEMIA  NOTHING can be offered in opposition to the arguments you use in support of your resolution to leave England with your husband My heart murmurs it is true but my reason approves Approves did I sayI admire I love I almost adore you my excellent friend Blame not the warmth of my expressions Must we not revere virtue unless it be consecrated by antiquity What were the merits of an Arria  or a Portia to your's Love produced in them those great actions for which they are so famous Religion and duty are the nobler motives which influence your's To die for the man one loves is not an act of such heroism as to chuse misery with the man one has no reason  to love because we consider it to be our duty to do so  IT is the fate of the best things to be either wholly neglected or at most but little known Such is this noble conduct of your's for few will know it and fewer still admire it I who am the greatest loser by it am yet capable of admiring it and this is a merit you must permit me to be vain of since it costs me so dear  BUT it is time to introduce Mr Martin again You tell me your griefs are suspended while you read my Letters and this is sufficient to make me devote the greatest part of my time to writing were I at liberty to follow my inclinations But I have no will of my own my dear Euphemia I am a slave to that of another Reconcile this if you can with what I told you of the happy change in my fortune or if you cannot wait patiently for my explanation  which will come in due time But now hear Mr Martin who went on in this manner  THE doctors Madam finding my master in so fine a way of recovery told him that change of air would set him quite up again and so he accepted Mr Greville's invitation to pass a week or two at his seat Mr Greville being a single man my lady thought she should be troublesome to him so she stayed behind at the Hall but she wept over my master when he took leave of her as if they were never to meet again However she quickly recovered her spirits and passed her time very merrily with Lady Flareit and some other gay ladies in the neighbourhood There was nothing but airings and visiting and dining and supping and Colonel Flareit Lady Flareit's kinsman always made one and he was so very obsequious to my lady that her woman said if my master  should happen to die it would certainly be a match but my lady was wiser I believe than that comes to for Colonel Flareit you know Madam has no estate  WELL Madam in the midst of all this jollity news came that my master being out a hunting had fallen from his horse and was taken up dead The whole family was in tears and lamentation but my lady was more composed because she did not believe the report "for if it was true" she said  she should have notice of it by a messenger sent express by Mr Greville  This seemed likely but for all that I was impatient to set out for Greville Park to know the truth but it being very late in the evening when the news came my lady ordered me not to stir till the next morning when I might set out as soon as I pleased And now she thought sit to make a show of sorrow and shed a few tears before her  woman and I But for all that we thought we could perceive that she would not be sorry to be a rich young widow  WELL Madam I passed an anxious night Heaven knows and the moment it was light I mounted and rode away  BEING still weak with my distemper I could not make as much haste as my impatience required and at the very second stage I saw Mr Greville's postchaise and himself in it drive into the innyard I was now seized with such a fit of trembling that I could neither sit my horse nor alight so one of the hostlers helped me and I followed Mr Greville to a room where he was sitting  Oh Sir my master my master  was all I could bring out His very looks however relieved me instantly as well as his words'  WHAT does the simpleton mean  said he  by trembling and looking so pale What you have heard of the accident then Well your master has got off for only a few slight bruises  "Heaven be praised" said I  for this good news but we heard that he had broke his neck and all us at the Hall are in the deepest affliction  "How" said Mr Greville  Does your lady believe Sir John is dead  "Not absolutely Sir" replied I  she said if it was true a messenger would be sent express to inform her and no one had come yet  "A wise woman" said Mr Greville  she was in the right not to be lavish of her tears upon an uncertainty but Martin  pursued he after thinking a little  I have a mind to know how she will take his death when she believes it to be certain Sir John poor man believing his consinement is likely to be long though that is by no means the case was  desirous of his lady's company so I could do no less than offer my service to conduct her to him and that was the sole motive of my journey but now I am resolved to have a little diversion from it Can you keep a secret Martin    I believe I can Sir  said I  my master has trusted me with many    Ah I do not doubt it  said Mr Greville shaking his head  Well then my design is to tell your lady that the report of Sir John's death was but too true  "Oh Sir" cried I  you know how fond my lady is of her husband this trial will be very hard upon her    You are a rogue  said he smiling  I see that but you will be secret    But Sir  said I  your servants will betray the matter  "Never fear that" said he  I will give them their instructions so send them up to me  I did so and after Mr Greville had tutored them properly we all set out for the Hall  MR Greville in consideration of my late illness had the goodness to take me into the chaise with him and all the way he diverted himself with the scheme he had formed and with telling me what to say and how to behave  WELL Madam we had scarce entered the avenue when Mr Greville's carriage and servants being perceived by one of our men the whole family was in motion and came crowding round us "Is the sad news true" cried several voices at once Mr Greville's servants shook their heads in a melancholy way "Alas then it is too true" they all repeated and ran back in great disorder into the house which they filled with their lamentations Mr Greville alighting said in a solemn tone  If Lady Harley is at leisure let her be informed I am come  He followed the butler who with eyes full of tears shewed him into my master's library and withdrew to acquaint my lady  IT was with difficulty I could break from the servants who hung upon me lamenting and inquiringbut I was curious to see how my lady would receive Mr Greville so I hastened after him  HE was seated and had taken a book "for" said he to me  I cannot expect to have an audience so soon the lady will take time to settle the face she is to wear upon this trying occasion  and to be sure Madam my lady was a full hour before she sent to desire Mr Greville would be pleased to come to her in her dressingroom  MR Greville obeyed immediately but with a slow step and solemn air I attended him but I believe I did not act my part so well as his Honour for my fellowservants have since told me that they thought my grief was not very violent We found my lady halflying  on a settee with a handkerchief at her eyes so that she did not perceive our entrance Her woman was standing close by her with a smelling bottle which she offered her and at the same time told her Mr Greville was there My lady then drawing aside her handkerchief just looked up and crying "Ah Mr Greville" clapped it close to her eyes again and continued silent  I CANNOT blame you Madam I cannot blame you  said Mr Greville  your grief is great and so is your cause for griefyou have lost a good husband but that is not all you have lost  At that word my lady started let fall her handkerchief and fixed her eyes upon Mr Greville impatiently expecting him to proceed for here the poor gentleman was seized with a violent cough which held him for two or three minutes  ALL that time I observed my lady heedfully her colour went and came she seemed hardly able to draw her breath still keeping her fixed looks upon Mr Greville who recovering went on  Yes Madam as I was saying you have lost beside a good husband  My lady seemed now ready to die with impatience for Mr Greville paused as if fearful of his cough returning then slowly added  You have lost a friend a protector an amiable companionSir John was all this to you Madam and how dear you were to him you will if you do not know it already soon know  MY lady was again at leisure for her tears she resumed her handkerchief and Mr Greville his fine speeches which lasted till I was desired to let my lady know that dinner was served Mr Greville then offered his hand to lead her down but she declined it saying she must entreat him to dispense  with her attending him at table since her melancholy situation would plead her excuse Mr Greville allowed it and only beseeching her to moderate her sorrow if possible bowed and quitted the room  I THEN advanced and asked if her ladyship had any commands for me She answered haughtily "No" and I followed Mr Greville who seeing me enter the diningparlour said to the other servants  You need not wait my lads my old friend here will be sufficient to attend me  accordingly they left the room  MR Greville made a sign to me to fasten the door which I did  And now  said he  let me have my laugh out for I am almost strangled  WHAT diverted Mr Greville most Madam was that he had thrown my lady quite off her guard when he  made her apprehend a greater loss than that of her husband for to be sure Madam my lady was quite in earnest then and looked frighted out of her wits for she supposed as Mr Greville intended she should that my master had made some alteration in his will before the accident happened  BUT here I must drop Mr Martin and his narration for the present for I have only time to make up my letter which you must acknowledge is of a tolerable length therefore adieu my dear Euphemia Alas the moment is approaching when I must bid you adieu for a long an indefinite time This is a sad thought but since I have well considered your admirable reasons for a resolution so contrary to my hopes and wishes I perceive a sort of calm acquiescence steal upon my mind which gathers strength every moment Yet you must not on this account imagine I love you less I endeavour to imitate  your fortitude and to make myself worthy of your esteem  MARIA HARLEY  WHY have I not a letter from you Must I charge you with breach of promise in not sending me the remainder of your affecting story  LETTER VIII MRS NEVILLE TO MISS HARLEY  NO my dear Maria I do not think you love me less than you did but that you love me more wisely But were it possible for me to suspect the sincerity of your affection it would be from the extravagant eulogium you bestow on me for what in my opinion is but an ordinary effect of duty and obedience  SURELY then you mean to excite me to virtue by a new subtilty and the praises you give me are but disguised exhortations Take notice this is the construction I shall put upon all such language from you and if you would not be thought rather to dictate than to commend avoid it for the future  BUT to shew you that I am as little disposed to submit to unjust censure as to undeserved praise I will not receive patiently your charge of being a promisebreaker Every thing that is promised and not done is not a violation of faith or breaking of promise since accident has so much to do in the ordering of small events The large packet that will soon follow this letter will convince you that I have been employed in obeying your commands and I have given you my History as you call it down to the present moment without interruption that you may no longer be ignorant of the causes and motives of the most important transaction of my life and from which that life must hereafter take all its colour  I HAVE been very much entertained with your friend Martin's relation and like his manner extremely well which your memory has so faithfully preserved but I am not quite pleased with the method  Mr Greville hit upon to realise his doubts of Lady Harley's sincerity He laid himself under the necessity of telling a direct falsehood and of supporting that falsehood by many little artifices not easily practised by an ingenuous mind But your men of wit and ridicule have a very relaxed moral on certain occasions A man of plain good sense starts at these humorous violations of truth and thinks his reputation would be ruined for ever by such bold flights  BUT I ought to remember that it is my dear Maria's friend whose conduct I am censuring and that it was for her service chiefly he devised this stratagem therefore though I cannot absolve yet I am willing to pardon for I confess my integrity is scarcely proof against so high a bribe My dear friend adieu  EUPHEMIA NEVILLE  LETTER IX MISS HARLEY TO MRS NEVILLE  MY DEAR EUPHEMIA  AND do you really resolve to put such a strange construction upon the just tribute paid by a friend to your merit Must my praises be considered as disguised exhortations Let me tell you you avoid presumption by a contrary extreme since envy itself would give you that which your own modesty takes away  BUT notto offend you further by dwelling on this theme you shall now have the remainder of Mr Martin's relation his simplicity pleases you and I have been careful to make no alteration in his style and manner thus then he went on  MR Greville as soon as he had dined sent to beg my lady would favour him with a short interview before his departure which he said the occasion required should be immediately Accordingly he was admitted to see her He told her that he intended to get as far on his way home that night as he possibly could and would call upon Mr Mainwaring and the executor to settle all matters relating to the funeral He desired to know if her ladyship had any particular commands to favour him with to which she answered  Pray Mr Greville do not consult me upon these sad affairs I leave all to your discretion  "BUT Madam" said Mr Greville  I earnestly recommend it to you to arm yourself with fortitude the body must be brought here tomorrow or next day at farthest  "As you please" said my lady  but I entreat you spare me any further discourse upon this melancholy subject  ALL this Madam Mr Greville told me was said with the utmost composure of look and accent so to be short Madam he took his leave and as my ague now returned with great violence this served for a good reason for my not going with him so I went up to my chamber but as I afterwards found my lady did not know I was in the house for she concluded I was gone with Mr Greville  THAT very evening Lady Flareit came to condole with my lady and supper was served up in her dressingroom and nobody was allowed to wait but her woman in whom my lady had great confidence which she did not deserve for she was very deceitsul Now it happened  that my name was mentioned upon some occasion or other upon which Mrs Wilson said I was very ill  MY lady was much surprised to hear I was in the house and declared I should not stay another moment in it  He is a busy meddling fellow  said she  he gained his master's good will by his fawning and his lies Poor Sir John had no very strong head and even this paltry fellow could make a dupe of him Go Wilson and tell him to leave the Hall immediately  Mrs Wilson told her that I was ill and gone to bed  "No matter" said my lady  he may go to the next inn he is rich enough to procure accommodation any whereI am determined he shall not stay in the houseI am mistress here and will be obeyed  "LORD Madam" said Mrs Wilson as she told me afterwards  does your ladyship consider what a clamour this will make every one knows my late good master had a great regard for Mr Martin he has served him faithfully many years you know Madam and faithful servants ought not to be used so  "YOUR late  good  master" said my lady  has well rewarded him for his services such as they were But methinks you are very bold to stand arguing with me thus go and deliver my orders tell him to be gone and here  said she kicking a little French dog that my master was very fond of  bid him take this animal with him This was a favourite too and was allowed to snarl and bark and spoil the carpets and no one not even myself durst find fault with him  MRS Wilson took up the dog and came to my room and told me all that had passed I was thundershook in a manner and making no answer she asked me what she should say to my lady  "GIVE my duty to her ladyship" said I  and tell her that I will obey her commands tomorrow morning as soon as it is day but for this night I hope she will excuse me and as for the dog I will take care of it for my dear master's sake and so good night Mrs Wilson  She smiled and said I acted quite right so she went away and I bolted the door after her and went to bed  I KNOW not how my lady took this answer for early the next morning I got up and finding myself much better I went to the stable made the groom saddle my horse and I set out for Mr Greville's seat  I ARRIVED there the next day about noon and had the satisfaction to hear that my master was quite well for indeed his hurt had been but very inconsiderable I desired Mr Greville's valet to tell his master that I was come and begged to speak to him in private before I waited on my master  MR Greville ordered me to come to him in his study and expressed much surprise at seeing me I told him all that had passed and how my lady had turned me out of doors and the little dog with me  MR Greville rubbed his hands and cried out joyfully  So this goes well she has shewn the cloven foot what will my old friend say to this  "DOES my master know Sir said I  of the trick you have put upon my lady  "OH yes" said he  and laughs at the jest but I fancy the story you have to tell will put some serious thoughts into his head Come I will bring you to him  I FOLLOWED Mr Greville into my master's chamber who was walking about and looked so well that my joy quite overpowered me and I burst into tears  "WELL Martin" said my master  I believe you are glad to find me alive but what brings you here I heard you was not well and why have you brought my poor Fidelle with you  added he caressing the dog who had got out of my arms and was jumping about him  I CAST down my eyes and was silent not knowing how to tell the matter My master then perceived that something extraordinary had happened  and said hastily  Why don't you answer me Martin  "I BELIEVE I must answer for him" said Mr Greville  for the poor man is half ashamed of the matter but the truth is my lady firmly believing that she is now whole and sole sovereign has in the plenitude of her power taken upon her to turn your faithful servant and your favourite dog out of doors  "How is this" said my master eagerly then suddenly stopping he mused a little and added with a smile  She has played you trick for trick but considering that Martin was ill this was carrying the jest too far But pray what cause did she assign for this treatment  MY lady accuses me of being a spy a busy body and a mischiefmaker Sir  said I  and as for the dog her  ladyship makes heavy complaints of him for such faults as dogs are often guilty of to be sure but I never thought Fidelle was one of those  MY master now laughed heartily at which I thought Mr Greville looked a little silly  I see you take this matter right  said he to my master in a peevish tone  "WHY yes" said my master  I believe I do but come I am resolved to act a part in this farce I find myself strong enough to undertake a longer journey than that to my own house so if you please we will set out tomorrow and I will surprise Lady Harley with the ghost of her husband  "WITH all my heart" said Mr Greville  but if your sudden appearance should frighten her into fits I am guiltless of the consequences for I  do assure you she thinks you are actually dead  INDEED I am persuaded she has been laughing at you all this time  said my master  "WELL" replied Mr Greville  I have no more to say but I hope you will have your jest too  "THAT is what I intend" said my master He then ordered me to go and take care of myself and I withdrew a little apprehensive of his difpleasure because he did not take this matter as Mr Greville expected  HOWEVER I had an opportunity of speaking to Mr Greville that evening and he assured me my master was not angry with any of us that was his phrase "Though some of us" says he  certainly deserve that he should be so He talks of what has past  very pleasantly but I think I can perceive he has some serious thoughts about it for he is often pensive and silent  WELL Madam my master set out next day at noon with Mr Greville for the Hall He would have had me stay behind a day or two to recover myself but I told him I found myself well enough to attend him and truly I would not upon any account have missed the scene I expected to see  WE lay that night at a friend of Mr Greville's who had heard the report of my master's death and was rejoiced to find it without foundation We left this gentleman's house so late in the day that it was night before we reached the Hall No one took any notice of my master who was wrapt up in his great coat and his hat slouched he followed Mr Greville up stairs who had asked for my lady and was told she was in her own apartment  A SERVANT announced Mr Greville to my lady's woman who was in waiting and Mr Greville without ceremony followed her into my lady's dressing room my master being close at his heels and to be sure Madam there was my lady not mourning like a sorrowful widow but sitting at supper with Lady Flareit and the Colonel and they all seemed very cheerful  YOUR servant your servant good people  said my master gaily taking off his hat  will you permit a couple of hungry travellers to partake with you  MY lady who had seemed lost in astonishment and terror at the sound of his voice no sooner saw his face than she screamed aloud and fell into a fainting fit Lady Flareit cried out  A ghost  hid her eyes with her apron and trembled like an aspenleaf and the Colonel starting up clapped his  hand "instinctively" aye that was Mr Greville's word upon his sword and opening his eyes as wide as he could stood staring at my master from a corner of the room who was very busy in endeavouring to recover my lady which at last with the assistance of her woman who sprinkled her face plentifully with water he effected  BUT as soon as she opened her eyes and saw my master she seemed ready to relapse upon which Lady Flareit who was now by the assistance of Mr Greville quite recovered from her fright approached and taking her hand said  Come Lady Harley let me lead you to your chamber Sir John this was a cruel jest    It was all Grevslle's doings  said my master  therefore pray my dear  said he to my lady who went tottering out of the room leaning upon Lady Flareit's arms  do not be too much discomposed but return  again soon if you would not spoil my supper  COLONEL Flareit then came forward looking a little foolish I thought as if he did not know how to take my master's gaiety  "Come Colonel" said my master come and finish your supper otherwise I shall think you are still afraid  "AFRAID Sir" said the Colonel "Aye afraid" said my matter  why Colonel a soldier may be afraid of a ghost without any disparagement to his courage but after all  continued my master laughing  you have all acted your parts very well and my friend Greville need not boast much of the success of his trick for I am confident there is not one of you that was imposed upon for a single moment by the story he invented of my death therefore the laugh I think is fairly turned upon him  THE Colonel said not a word and Mr Greville seemed utterly at a loss how to understand my master so he continued to eat in silence  AT length Lady Flareit came in looking very grave and was going to speak but my master prevented her crying out  So Lady Harley is not with you I see she would fain carry on the jest a little further and persuade me that she really thought I was dead but I know better she is not so good an actress as she thinks and yet after all she imposed upon Greville I believe  LADY Flareit now cleared up all on a sudden "Ah" said she to my master  you have found us out we intended to mortify you by our pretended indifference but however your sudden appearance surprised Lady Harley you know she has very weak nerves she is really not well  and is gone to bed    I am sorry for that  said my master  I hoped she would have joined the laugh against this plotter here  clapping Mr Greville on the back  LADY Flareit now returned to my lady telling the Colonel that she would go home in a quarter of an hour Mrs Wilson informed me that this time was spent in close conversation between the two ladies which she could not hear distinctly but Lady Flareit seemed endeavouring to persuade my lady to something She was sent to acquaint the Colonel that her lady ship was ready so he took leave of my master and Mr Greville and they went away together  EARLY the next morning I saw my master and Mr Greville walking together upon the lawn seemingly in deep discourse When they came in to breakfast my lady sent her woman with an apology for her not being able to attend  them having had a very indifferent night My master expressed great concern for her illness and desired her woman to let him know when she was up that he might go and see her then hastily turning to me he said  Get ready immediately to go for Worden and Grasp I have some business for them to do which I think ought not to be delayed lest I should die in good earnest  Mrs Wilson heard these words and hurried away to tell her lady and I was as eager to execute my commission  I BROUGHT them both with me to the Hall My master was in my lady's chamber when they arrived and as soon as he had notice of it he joined them in his study Mr Greville was there and they continued a long time together  My master detained the two lawyers to dinner at which my lady being still indisposed did not appear The next  morning Mr Greville set out for his own seat he shook my hand as I attended him to his carriage saying in a low voice  All goes right honest Martin  I understood his Honour and was heartily glad of it  WHEN Mr Greville was gone my lady appeared at table as usual but so sullen so silent that my master could hardly get a word out of her though he was very complaisant and civil to her Mrs Wilson told me that she could hear Lady Flareit who seldom missed a day coming to see her often chide her for her behaviour telling her she was wrong quite wrong but my lady could not be persuaded to alter it continuing cold reserved and even peevish But my master seemed to take no notice of this strange alteration in her manner towards him he was often talking of you Madam and pleasing himself with the expectation of seeing you soon He ordered your apartset  of wrought dressingplate for your toilet came from London which my lady scarcely condescended to look at saying coldly when my master asked her opinion that it was mighty pretty  A GREAT alteration now appeared in my lady's looks and it was apparent that her secret discontents had hurt her health My master proposed to her change of air and a journey to Paris she said she would rather go to some of the watering places But she grew visibly worse and at length was seized with a violent fever The physicians had very little hopes from the first and all their arguments and intreaties could not prevail upon her to be bled so she died as one may say by her own fault  MY master was very kind to her during her illness but she was seldom sensible and scarce ever spoke The day she died he continued shut up in his  closet for several hours and the next morning set out for Mr Greville's seat She was buried in the family vault with great solemnity but I am sorry to say not much lamented for her lady ship was not very charitable to the poor and she always behaved to the tenants and small gentry in the neighbourhood with great haughtiness  HERE Mr Martin ended his narration which took up two or three of my evenings in listening to and I have given it you almost in his very words What more I have to tell you on this subject must be deferred till my next But now adieu my ever dear Euphemia  MARIA HARLEY  LETTER X MRS NEVILLE TO MISS HARLEY  MY DEAR MARIA  I SHALL never for the future rank your uncle with men of common understanding his whole conduct with regard to Lady Harley on the most trying occasion imaginable displays a fund of good sense and philosophy rarely to be met with in persons who like him have spent so great a part of their lives in the pursuit of pleasure  How nicely has he steered between two extremes equally fatal to his reputation Had he appeared insensible of her levities and indifferent to the ungrateful returns she made to his affection he would have passed for a dupe had he avowed his resentment he would have authorised suspicions that  would have ruined her character and fixed ridicule upon his own he escaped both these rocks by the most masterly management imaginable and neither malice nor ridicule can find a shaft to hit him  I AM not surprised at the despair which Lady Harley seems to have fallen into The most common view persons have when they commit imprudent actions is the probability of always finding out some resource or other but Lady Harley in this case could have no such hope she had fixed her husband's opinion of her irrevocably and the very methods he used to render her less contemptible in the eyes of the world served only to lessen her more in her own But peace be to her ashes and oblivion to her memory  I AM particularly impatient for your next letter in hopes that it will clear up an ambiguous expression in one of  your former ones that has puzzled me greatly you say you have no will of your own and that you are a slave to that of another pray make me understand this Adieu my dear Maria  LETTER XI MISS HARLEY TO MRS NEVILLE  MY DEAR EUPHEMIA  I WISH I could with any propriety have shewn my uncle some part of your last letter even the wise might be pardoned for indulging a little vanity at receiving praises from judgment and sincerity like yours but you will easily conceive this would not have been proper at least at this time after what I am going to tell you  MARTIN having informed him that he had obeyed his commands and given me a very particular and you must own my friend that it  was  a very particular account of all that had  happened during my absence my uncle spoke to me in this manner  You have heard from Martin some very interesting circumstances relating to your aunt and me you have candour and good sense I doubt not but you will judge rightly of my conduct I only intreat you never to mention Lady Harley to me in private and in public be as reserved on that subject as I am Mr Greville  he added  is certainly your friend you owe him some acknowldgments  and these my dear I did not fail to pay him the very first opportunity with an effusion of heart which convinced him of my gratitude  I WAS obliged to listen to some humrous sallies on my aunt's account and even to smile at them for indeed it would have been very difficult to refrain however he always spared my uncle which considering his fondness  for raillery was an instance of selfdenial that had some merit in it  MY aunt's woman was still in the house she expected to have made her court to me by throwing out some reflections upon her late lady and by making an ample discovery of all she knew but I silenced her by a severe look and an absolute command never to speak to me on the subject  MY uncle left it to me to do as I pleased with regard to her I had reason to think her very deceitful and incapable of being true to any one I resolved to discharge her immediately so I gave her all her late lady's clothes and linen with what money she had in her pockets when she died and dismissed her to the great joy of the servants who had all of them at one time or other experienced her treachery  You will call Mr Greville a bold man when I tell you he would read your last letter notwith standing all I could do to hinder him he came in when I was writing and saw it lying on my table and actually read it through and this is what he said when he returned it to me  No modesty is able to resist the praises that come from your amiable friend and although I have hitherto thought vanity a ridiculous quality yet I protest I should take a pleasure in being corrupted by her  HE prest me much to shew my uncle what you said of him but I pleaded his absolute command not to mention Lady Harley to him and he agreed that he ought to be obeyed  THIS unlooked for intrusion of Mr Greville's will teach me caution I will always fasten my door for the future when I sit down to write to you But I will now explain to you what I meant  when I told you my uncle was kinder to me than ever and yet I had no will of my own but was a slave to that of another  IT is that kindness of his that has enslaved my will my dear Euphemia that has loaded me with a debt of gratitude which I can never be able to pay and has fixed shackles upon my mind which it is impossible for me ever to unloose Mark the method he took to produce this voluntary subjection  SOME little time after my return from France Mr Greville being upon a visit at the Hall my uncle sent for me into his study where he was sitting with his friend they had papers lying upon the table before them one of which upon my entrance my uncle took and presenting it to Mr Greville  Here Sir  said he  is a deed of gift to my niece of the greatest part of my personal estate amounting to about twenty  thousand pounds which as her guardian and trustee I lodge in your hands It is all placed on government securities for the interest of which you are to be accountable to her only from the present moment and to pay into her hands for her sole use and benefit  'BE not surprised' pursued he 'child' taking my hand and leading me all amazed and speechless to a chair next his own  I believe you have a sincere affection for me and I am willing to enjoy the pleasure this thought gives me pure and unmixed with the least shadow of a doubt What I intended to bequeath you at my death I give you now irrevocably that you may be free and absolute mistress of yourself and that having nothing more to hope or any thing to fear from me your actions may be as unconstrained as your thoughts and your real affection for me liable to no misconstructions  IT was easy to perceive by this conduct of my uncle my dear Euphemia what an impression Lady Harley's duplicity and artifice had made upon his mind and how much he apprehended being thought the dupe of female subtilty a second time His favourable opinion of me was also evident and this was the point to which as I conceived delicacy obliged me only to answer  MY heart was full but I endeavoured to suppress my emotions and taking his hand which I respectfully kissed while an involuntary tear at the same time dropped upon it  I am obliged to you Sir  said I  not so much for making me rich or for making me rich before my time but for putting it in my power to shew you    I understand you my dear niece  said he hastily interrupting me  we understand one another I believe and we shall both be the happier for it Would to Heaven  added he with some emotion  that the estate of my family which falls to a collateral branch which I have no reason to love could have been your's likewise    Come no more of this  said Mr Greville  my fair ward here will have enough of that pelf which as Pope says  Buys the sex a tyrant in itself  MR Greville very judiciously end ea voured to give the conversation a gayer turn to r  ieve my uncle and me from the very awkward situation we found ourselves in while he was afraid of hearing acknowledgments which my full heart left me not the power of expressing And thus my friend has the independence my uncle bestowed on me been the beginning of my slavery for I cannot I ought not to have any will but that of a benefactor who has acted with such uncommon generosity  THE power to follow my inclinations is secured to me but my will is fettered by the obligations I lie under Thus for instance my heart impels me to fly to you to sooth to comfort to assist you in your present situation and I should most certainly have asked his permission for a short absence if he had not by making me my own mistress deprived himself as he thinks of the power of refusing and my company being now more necessary to him than ever I cannot give the least hint that I have a wish that way for fear of laying him under the necessity of doing what may be disagreeable to him But perhaps his own good fense may suggest to him to offer what I cannot ask and then you may depend upon seeing me in London  I HAVE this moment received the longexpected packet but I must rein in my impatience and not open it till I retire for the night for this whole day I  shal be employed in reading to my uncle who is a little indisposed and cannot take his usual ride My dear Euphemia adieu  LETTER XII MRS NEVILLE TO MISS HARLEY  BEFORE I continue my little narrative I must entreat you my dear Maria not to suffer these papers to be seen by any person but yourself they will contain a faithful account of my affairs and give you a just picture of my situation and consequently I shall be obliged to touch upon the faults of one who from the near relation in which he stands to me has claims upon my tenderness and respect which even those faults cannot dispense with me from allowing him Mine I know your friendship would spare and conceal and he being a part of myself for him I expect the same indulgence  I HAVE already repeated what Mrs Benson told me concerning my father's imprudent management of his affairs the consequence of which has involved his family in ruin My mother always gentle and kind endeavoured to palliate those errors by which she was so great a sufferer  THERE is nothing said she more commendable than generosity but nothing ought less to be stretched too far Mr Lumley served his friends with too little attention to his own ability which together with other imprudences produced that bitter remorse which shortened his days  HER tears flowed fast at these words I suppressed my own emotions that I might comfort her and endeavoured to detach her thoughts from the melancholy idea by giving her a detail of the inequality of Mrs Highmore's behaviour to me during the first and the last days of my residence with her which  the wreck of our fortunes now enabled me to account for  My mother smiled at my story and taking two letters out of her pocketbook put them into my hand  Here are two letters from Mrs Highmore  said she  of different dates the first is to Mrs Lumley in affluence the second to the same Mrs Lumley in distress read them  I did so and here is what they contained  TO MRS LUMLEY  DEAR MADAM  My whole family have been transported with joy ever since I communicated to them your resolution to give us the inestimable blessing of Miss Lumley's company during your stay at Bath My daughters will think themselves honoured by her accepting their services and I shall be proud to stand in the place of a mother to such  excellence during the absence of you her incomparable mother Most devoutly do I pray for the perfect recovery of good Mr Lumley and for all imaginable blessings to your worthy self being with great respect  Dear Madam  Your obliged most humble And most obedient servant A HIGHMORE  P S  The dear young lady is in perfect health  TO MRS LUMLEY  I AM sincerely sorry my very good friend for your late loss which is attended with such dreadful consequences to your affairs Your daughter takes on greatly for her father's death but we keep her in ignorance of the rest of her misfortunesagainst my judgment indeed for it moves  my pity to see the poor thing so unsuspicious of the sad reverse of her fortune  I WISH I could offer you any consolation in this great calamity but as you are a good Christian and a woman of sense you will doubtless reflect that all are not born to be rich and that it behoves us to be resigned and humble under difficult situations Pray let me know when you design to leave Bath and whether I can be of any use to you here on this occasion for I shall always be glad to shew myself your very sincere friend  And humble servant A HIGHMORE  The poor child is as well as can be expected considering her afflication  My mother answered this extraordinary epistle no otherwise than by cancelling a  note for sixty pounds which Mrs Highmore had borrowed of her about a year before and enclosing it in a cover which contained only these words  Mrs Lumley's compliments and desires Mrs Highmore will accept the enclosed as payment for her daughter's and her governess board for five weeks  THIS billet was sent by a porter to Mrs Highmore's house in town whither we had heard she was come with orders not to stay for an answer She came herself a few days afterwards to visit my mother who pleaded indisposition and refused to see her  MRS Highmore's behaviour was imitated by many other persons of our acquaintance whose cool kindness and constrained civility marked too well the change of our fortunes  SOME of our relations were of high rank and these kept us at a distance by their very ceremonious behaviour Some were only rich and to them poverty appeared rather a crime than a misfortune so that in strict morality they were obliged to treat us with great coldness and reserve  My mother appeared calm and Unruffled by this general depravity  Persons of quicker sensibility than myself  said she  would on this occasion complain of the world but I shall content myself with forgetting it  HAVING settled all her affairs in London we retired to a small house which my mother had taken in a neighbouring town and furnished with a simplicity suitable to her fortune and a neatness that gave elegance to that simplicity  MRS Benson refused the part of governess to a young lady of high distinction  in order to accompany us in this retreat 'I have an income' said she  which though small is sufficient to prevent my being an incumbrance to you I acquired part of it in your service and I will never quit you while my attendance can be either useful or agreeable to you  You will easily imagine my dear Maria how acceptable such an instance of faithful attachment must be to my mother at a time when she seemed forsaken by all the world She embraced and thanked her with tears of tenderness and joy yet represented to her that her interest required she should accept the advantageous proposal that was made to her  'HONOUR gratitude and friendship' replied she  impel me to attach myself to you and my beloved pupil in doing so I find my interest  WE were soon settled in our new habitation one maidservant composed our whole equipage We worked we read we dressed our little gardenall was peace friendship and mutual complacency  'I SEE' said I one day to my mother  that one may cease to be rich without being unhappy    A life led in tranquillity and with judgment  replied my mother  which is the work of reason is preferable to one half of those sudden and great successes which the world admires and which are scarce ever the rewards of merit but the mere vagaries of fortune  THE privacy my mother so earnestly desired was not like to be interrupted in a neighbourhood chiefly composed of families grown wealthy by the successful arts of trade and had chosen this retreat for their summer residence who had no idea of any merit but riches and allowed no  claims to respect but what were derived from the ostentatious display of them The name of Lumley sounded less respectable in their ears than that of Jackson or Wilson because Jackson or Wilson kept coaches and could afford to fare sumptuously every day  'NOTHING' says the immortal Bacon  can make that great which nature meant to be little  Our situation afforded us many opportunities of observing how fortune and nature were at strife when the lavish gifts bestowed by the one could not efface the despicable stamp impressed by the other The Indian plunderer raised from the condition of a linkboy to princely affluence in the midst of his blaze of grandeur looked like a robber going in mock state to execution and the forestalling trader enjoyed his clumsy magnificence with the same aspect as when he had overreached a less cunning dealer in a bargain  SUCH were the observations of Mrs Benson when these sons and daughters of sudden opulence rolled in unwieldy state by our humble habitation  MY mother used sometimes to chide her for the severity of her sarcasms but her spleen was often roused by the inconveniences which our contiguity to these great personages exposed us to for money which as she said cost them nothing to acquire but what they valued as nothing consequently was expended so lavishly as raised the prices of necessaries and this grievance was severely felt by their less opulent neighbours  bespoke every day to furnish this indispensable article to their afternoon regale  SUCH inconveniences as these my mother bore without murmuring but she was not so easy under the difficulty she found of procuring a seat in the church 'which' said Mrs Benson  are almost all taken up with the worshippers of Mammon to whom as they have erected an altar in their own houses they might as well perform their devotions at home and let Christians have access to the house of God  MY mother however sometimes by the force of bribe got admission into a pew and one Sunday making use of the same powerful oratory she was let into a pew where there was only one lady of a diminutive figure indeed but a soul so vast as seemed to oe'rinform her small tenement of clay and made her fancy herself large enough to occupy  the whole pew so that upon my mother's entrance she spread her flounces and hoop over the whole bench and wedging my mother close in a corner looked askance upon her without making the least return to the courtesy she made her after she had risen from her knees  WHEN the service was over the little great lady being in a hurry to get out flounced by my mother and said loud enough to be heard by her to the woman who attended to open the door  I wonder at your assurance to put people that nobody knows into my pew I shall complain to the churchwarden I assure you  'MADAM' said the woman  you have a right to but one seat in the pew and the gentlewoman looks as much like a lady as any body  THIS speech called forth a contemptuous smile and a repetition of the word  'lady' for although my mother was as you know my Maria a most elegant figure and had an air of dignity which was rendered more interesting by the gentle sorrow which shaded her features yet as she had no footman with her that barrier in this polite country town between the high and the low it was impossible to imagine she could have any claim to civility  SHOCKED but not mortified at the ridiculous pride of this daughter of trade my mother was preparing to go out of the pew when she was accosted by a lady who by her air and manner seemed to be indeed a gentlewoman she had heard what had been said to the pewopener and appeared much affected at it  'I PERCEIVE Madam' said she to my mother  that you are not provided with a seat in this church which indeed is very difficult to procure in the  summer season but you will be extremely welcome to one in my pew there is room enough and I shall be happy to accommodate you you need only desire to be shewn to Mrs Howard's pew and it will always be open to you  THE lady curtseyed and passed on giving my mother time to pay her acknowledgments for this favour only by a deep curtsey and an expressive look  SHE related this incident to Mrs Benson and me when she came home telling us at the same time the name of the benevolent lady  I should have been surprised  said Mrs Benson  if any of the plebeian gentry of this lofty place had been capable of such an instance of civility to a stranger from the noble name of Howard one might expect it  'IT is true' replied my mother  that pride and meanness are generally found together but there are persons even of high birth who can submit to to be proud and whose whole greatness lie in their titles so that if they would have us respect them they must send a herald before to announce their claims  I BELIEVE you and I my dear Maria know several of these undignified great ones and to my sorrow some may be found among my own relations  MY mother did not fail to go to church next Sunday and the pewopener who had heard what Mrs Howard said immediately conducted her to that lady's pew Mrs Howard was already there and received her with smiles that shewed the satisfaction she felt at seeing her offer so readily accepted My mother had now an opportunity of paying her acknowledgments which she did  with her usual politeness and a heart glowing with gratitude  MRS HOWARD judging by the paleness of her looks that she was in a weak state of health desired as soon as the service was over that she would permit her to set her down at her own door which my mother after a short apology for the trouble it would give her consented to  MY mother being desired to tell the servant where the coach was to stop directed him to the place and said he would see the name of Lumley upon the door  'Is your name Lumley Madam' said Mrs Howard hastily my mother bowing  THEN you are the widow of the late Mr Lumley who died at Bath I presume  said she  'I AM Madam' replied my mother sighing  How happy am I to meet with you thus unexpectedly  said Mrs Howard  I have often wished for the pleasure of your acquaintance but I know not how it was I never met you at any of my parties but you must promise that we shall be good neighbours now I generally pass three or four months every year at a little pleasant house I have about a short mile from hence before I go to our seat in Hertfordshire I will not part with you till you have promised to spend a day with me  MY mother assured her she would with great pleasure Mrs Howard insisted upon alighting when the coach stopped that she might be introduced to me for I ha d hastened to the door to receive my mother She saluted me tenderly  said some very civil things and took leave of us having first made us promise to dine with her the next day and to name the hour when we chose the coach should come for us But little did I imagine the influence this visit was to have over my future fortunes  THE coach came for us at the appointed time and carried us to a small but elegant building The grounds about it were laid out with a beautiful simplicity and the apartments all furnished in the same taste  MRS HOWARD received us with an easy politeness which soon banished the idea of being but the acquaintance of a day When we were summoned to the dining parlour we found there no other company but one gentleman who by his dress we knew to be an officer whom Mr Howard introduced to us as his kinsman  THIS was Mr Neville my dear Maria now the husband of your Euphemia His age seemed to be about thirty he was well bred talked sensibly and had something very gracious and insinuating in his manner which I know not how it was had not the same effect upon me that it had upon most other persons on whom it generally produced a favourable prepossession  ALTHOUGH I could perceive I had attracted his notice his eyes being almost constantly fixed on me and following all my motions yet his attentions were chiefly directed to my mother he sat next her at table and served her with every thing in the most polite and obliging manner imaginable We walked in the gardens after dinner he kept close by my mother whom he prevailed upon to lean on his arm and entertained her with all the gallantry of an admirer yet with all the respect and reverence of a son My mother was quite pleased with  him he seemed solicitous to gain hèr good opinion and frequently threw out sentiments which did prodigious honour to his heart  My mother was greatly struck with one thing he said which she declared was worthy of Socrates himself Having upon some instance of his obliging assiduity complimented him upon his politeness Mrs Howard said with a smile  I do assure you Madam Mr Neville is a general favourite  'I PROTEST to you Madam' replied Mr Neville  I do not think I have any reason to be vain of such a commendation the favour of the multitude is seldom procured by honest and lawful means I aspire indeed to the approbation of the few for I do not number voices but weigh them  'PRAY' said Mrs Benson when my mother repeated this speech to her  'how old is this sententious gentleman' My mother replied  that she believed he was under thirty  'Ah' replied she  a philosopher of that age will always be suspected by me these fine sayings come more from the head than the heart  YOUR satire is too keen my dear Benson  said my mother  it is easy to perceive you are out of humour with the world but having no reason to be so on your own account I must place it to your friendship for me who am so uneasily situated in it however Fortune may justify herself for having favoured me so little for I am sure I never courted her  'BUT I would fain know' said Mrs Benson  what my young pupil here thinks of this grave young gentleman  'MY mama thinks well of him' said I  her judgment ought to be a guide to mine but if I may be permitted to speak my sentiments I think the air of his countenance and the graciousness of his manner are not of a piece his smiles are rather forbidding than conciliating and do not seem calculated to invite confidence in the goodness of his temper  'UPON my word' said my mother half smiling  Mrs Benson seems to have infused part of her spirit in you but my dear  pursued she in a grave tone  I wish he were your husband I am persuaded he would make you happy and to see you settled is all the wish I have on this side heaven  'DEAR Madam' said I a little disconcerted  the gentleman has no thought of me  'I do not know that' replied my mother  I am sure he took a very particular notice of you and as  he seems to be a man of much worth and honour it would make me happy to leave you under such a protection  THIS last thought affected me with a tender concern and made Mrs Benson look grave We changed the discourse but my mother often mentioned Mr Neville still finding something in his manners and behaviour to ground a good opinion of his morals on  HE called the next day to enquire after our health but only left his name without staying to be asked in which afforded my mother new matter for praise as his modesty seemed in this instance to be equal to his politeness  IT soon became a custom to dine every Sunday with Mrs Howard who carried us home with her from church and we were always sure to find Mr Neville there His behaviour to me was now particular enough to be observed by  every body Mrs Howard railing me on my conquest was pleased to say  there are few men worthy of you but in point of birth or fortune Mr Neville is no improper match On the death of his uncle who is now seventy he will succeed to an estate of eight hundred a year he is likely to rise in the army and his own fortune which is about five thousand pounds is I believe still entire as I never heard he was addicted to any extravagance  MY mother was very well pleased with this account of his circumstances  Such an establishment for my daughter  said she to Mrs Benson  is in her situation not to be rejected especially when the man is so worthy  MRS Benson who knew how little I was disposed to become a wife and did not perhaps think so highly of Mr Neville's good qualities as my mother did shewed no great satisfaction at Mr Neville's  addresses and wished the affair not to be hurried on too fast  'IT is dangerous' said she  to enter the state of marriage rashly and by the conduct of fortune all the eyes that prudence hath are not too many to serve as a guide in this business for errors are mortal where repentance is unprofitable  SHE sometimes expressed her surprise to me at my mother's earnestness to conclude this affair Alas the motive soon became too obvious her health was declining fast her anxiety for me preyed upon her spirits I could often observe her look at me earnestly for a minute till her eyes filled with tears and then she would hastily turn away to conceal her emotion  MR NEVILLE'S behaviour all this time was so tender so obliging so eager to do us little services so attentive to my  mother so passionate yet so respectful to me that he even brought over Mrs Benson in some degree to his party She would sometimes tell me that since I was absolutely certain his addresses to me were not actuated by any motives of interest I owed him some gratitude for the sincerity of his affection  MY mother's illness now increased so fast upon her as to fill us with the most dreadful apprehensions the physicians acknowledged they thought her case dangerous I passed my days and the greatest part of my nights by her bedside indulging my tears in her intervals of restfor I carefully concealed from her the agonizing fears that filled my mind  MR NEVILLE on this occasion shewed all the tenderness of a son and all the sympathy of the most cordial friendship  'OH that you could love this man' said my mother to me one day  what satisfaction would it give me to leave you under his protection for indeed my dear child  pursued she  I have reason to think my anxiety for you is one of the chief sources of my illness  I STARTED from the chair where I was sitting I threw myself on my knees at her bedside and bathing the dear hand she held out to me with my tears 'My dear mama' said I  why oh why did you not explain yourself before could you doubt my ready obedience to your will  'IN this case my Euphemia' said she  I would exact nothing from your obedience my wish went no farther than that you could love Mr Neville Your good opinion of him I am sure he has  'HE has Madam' said I  and I will teach my heart to love him since he is your choice and since the peace of your mind depends upon my being settled should my compliance restore you to your health I shall be the happiest of human beings  'AND to see you happy' said my mother  is all my wish upon earth I am persuaded Mr Neville will make you so provided you have no dislike to him  'How is it possible Madam' said I  that I can have any dislike to a person for whom you have so great a regard Doubt not but I shall love Mr Neville when it is my duty so to do and I will make it my duty whenever you please to command me  'MY dear child' said my mother  Heaven will I doubt not reward you for this as well as every other instance  of your filial piety From a young woman of your reserved and delicate turn of mind I expected no sudden attachment no romantic flights of passion but I am well assured that the man whom your judgment approves will when entitled to your affection possess it entirely  FROM that day my mother began to be not only composed but cheerful the easy state of her mind had such a powerful effect upon her health that in a few days she left her bed and her recovery seemed no longer doubtful  MR NEVILLE received my consent with transports that seemed to border I thought upon madness and rather frighted than pleased me He asked his uncle's consent for form's sake which was neither granted nor refused for the old gentleman who was not satisfied with his conduct in general had long ceased to trouble himself about his affairs  and it was thought that his disgust had risen to such a height that if he could have disinherited him he would certainly have done it  MR NEVILLE'S security on this point was perhaps one cause of the little care he took to conciliate him  MY mother made no reflections to the disadvantage of Mr Neville on account of this coolness between him and his relation for there are times when some persons are always in the right We were married and my husband in about a fortnight afterwards carried me to a genteel house in Hillstreet which he had taken ready furnished for my reception  THE parting with my mother whose state of health did not permit her to live in London would have been very grievous to me if I had not been enabled to visit her constantly every day for  among other articles of expence which I did not expect from the very moderate income my husband possessed at present I had a chariot and servants in elegant liveries My mother gently hinted her fears that his great fondness for me would in the oeconomy of his house and appearance make him consider rather the affluence in which I had been bred than the humble condition to which fortune had reduced me  I HAVE heard it observed that it is common for persons who are conscious that they have done things deserving of blame to answer their own thoughts rather than what is said to them Mr Neville therefore hastily replied  I have no intention to mislead my Euphemia into an opinion that I am richer than I really am I never deceived her with regard to my present circumstances nor my future prospects what you object to was not done to cast a mist before her eyes  'MY dear son' said my mother hastily interrupting him  how vastly do you mistake my meaning You are incapable of deceit but you are also incapable of reflecting that your wife having brought you no fortune has no claim to any increase of expence beyond conveniences  MY husband's countenance now cleared up and this short debate ended with a kind compliment to me which I was pleased with because it gave her satisfaction  MR NEVILLE however had deceived several of his friends and Mrs Howard in particular with regard to his circumstances and consequently my mother for of his own fortune which was five thousand pounds the greatest part was spent He had commanded a company of foot in a regiment which was lately reduced and his halfpay was almost all he had to subsist on Without reflecting  upon the causes of disgust he had given his uncle he hoped that upon his marriage an event which he had often wished for he would have made him a decent allowance out of an estate which must one day be his and of which he did not spend the half upon himself but in this he was disappointed after many fruitless endeavours to soften his uncle he took a sudden resolution for his resolutions are always sudden to extricate himself from his difficulties by going abroad and fortune on this occasion favoured his designs  A YOUNG gentleman who was appointed first Lieutenant to one of the independent companies in NewYork having no inclination to leave England entered eagerly into a proposal Mr Neville made him to exchange this commission for his Captain's halfpay and having very considerable interest the affair was soon accomplished Mr Neville  who has very high notions of the prerogatives of a husband and doubtless soreseeing the opposition I should make to this scheme never deigned to consult me upon it Little did I expect the storm that was ready to burst upon my head when one evening having staid later than usual with my mother on my return I found him at home very busy at his escrutore looking over papers and settling accounts  AFTER some enquiries concerning my mother's health he asked me abruptly 'if I should like to travel' I said  I should like it extremely in certain circumstances  And pray what are these certain circumstances my dear  said he 'Why' replied I  a full purse and my mother's company  I cannot promise for either  said he  and yet I believe we must travel  He said this with so grave a look and accent that although I could hardly think him  in earnest yet I was strangely alarmed and I asked him with some emotion 'what he meant'  'I MEAN what I say' replied he  that we must go abroad my dear it is absolutely necessary  'ABSOLUTELY necessary to go abroad' I repeated trembling and scarce able to speak  'IT is really as I tell you' said he without taking notice of the disorder I was in  My uncle is incorrigible he will make no addition to my income which is too small to support you properly I am besides incumbered with some debts which without his assistance I am not able to pay and he has had the cruelty to refuse me a few hundreds which would have set me at ease Fortunately an opportunity offers which will enable me to extricate myself from these difficulties without  his help I have made an advantageous exchange with an officer who was going to NewYork It is one of the finest of our American provinces the climate is delightful the air healthy the people polished all the luxuries of life are there more easily purchased than common necessaries here There will be no great hardship in passing three or four years there My uncle's death will be the period of our banishment if you will have me call it so his age and infirmities scarce make it probable that he can last long we will then return to England  ALL the time he was speaking I sat with my hands folded and my eyes fixed on the ground in an agony of thought He paused as if expecting me to answer him  'You say nothing to me Euphemia' said he at length  You think it a  hardship no doubt to follow a husband who has given you such uncommon proofs of his affection  'OH my dear mother' cried I  am I to be torn from you at a time when my attendance on you is so necessary  'YOUR mother will go with us perhaps' said he  The voyage is not so long a one as you imagine they often run it in less than three weeks  'I CHARGE you' interrupted I rising hastily and holding him as if he was going that instant to my mother  I charge you do not carry this dreadful news to my mother you will kill her she will not survive the parting with me Alas was it for this  I paused  'Go on' said Mr Neville  was it for this you married I know to whom I was obliged for your reluctant consent  THIS was a sad thoughtAgitated as I was with other griess I perceived instantly all the inconveniencies this notion if it took too deep root would bring upon me but it was not possible for me to eradicate it without descending to the meanness of falsehood my soul was unacquainted with those emotions which on this occasion would have suggested professions of fondness and attachment such as he perhaps expected I answered therefore with great simplicity  It is true Sir you were my mother's choice I never had any other will but her's and her choice regulated mine but I would not have married an emperor if by that marriage I should have been obliged to leave her  'WELL' answered he carelessly  I believe your mother will be the only rival I shall ever have in your affections we must endeavour to prevail upon her to go with us But pray  pursued he in a kinder accent  compose yourself this separation is yet too distant to occasion all this uneasiness  'BUT still it is certain' said I  is it not so  'I AM afraid it is' he replied  My affairs are in such perplexity that it must be so  AT this decisive word my tears flowed afresh His patience for alas he has but a small share of that useful quality seemed now exhausted he rose up and taking his hat told me he was obliged to go out and hoped when he returned to find me in a better humour  I WAS not sorry to be left alone that I might give free vent to my tears But scarce had I passed a few minutes in this sad employment when my servant informed me a gentleman from Lord S  desired to speak with me This nobleman my dear Maria was a relation of my mother's and was my godfather as I believe you have heard me say He was but very lately returned from the Continent where he had spent two years in search of health which however he had not found as his letter which his gentleman now delivered to me informed me He expressed great concern for my father's death and the situation in which he had left my mother and me wished me happy in my marriage and desired my acceptance of five hundred pounds as a nuptial present lamenting his inability to do more for me which indeed I knew to be true as he had but a small estate and several children to provide for  My surprise at this unexpected piece of good fortune at a time when I was overwhelmed with despair was so great that the letter fell out of my hands and  the banknotes enclosed in it were scattered about the room My soul was filled with joy and gratitude in this providential relief I felt I acknowledged the gracious hand of Heaven It was with difficulty I could compose myself to write a few lines to my kind benefactor and when I sent for his messenger to deliver my billet to him myself the transport I was in might easily be read in my countenance Delivered from my fears of being separated from my mother by being thus enabled to supply the necessities of my husband I felt as if a mountain was removed from my breast I expected his return with inconceivable impatience and as soon as he entered the room I flew eagerly to him  'My dear Mr Neville' said I delivering him the letter with the notes  see how Providence has interposed to prevent a separation that would have given death to my mother and made  me miserable These sums will I hope be sufficient to set you at ease and make it unnecessary for you to go abroad  HE read the letter and examined the notes 'It must be confessed' said he coldly  this is a fortunate circumstance considering your great unwillingness to leave England Well Euphemia I hope you will now be easy since you have your wish  I saw he expected I should thank him for his ready acquiescence to my will and by this piece of policy he escaped what to him would have been a very great mortificationthe appearance of being under any obligation to me or my friends My answer was calculated to please him and I left him the next day in very good humour in order to visit my mother  My heart was light and the inward satisfaction I felt gave such an air of  cheerfulness to my countenance that upon my entering my mother's apartment she took notice of it Holding out her hand to me which I kissed  May I always see you  said she  with this contented air and may you never have reason to be otherwise  ALAS how soon was my cheerfulness to be overcast I felt her hand intensely hot I fixed my eager looks upon her face the alteration I perceived there froze me with terror  I have had but an indifferent night but I am better now  said she forcing a smile to dissipate my apprehensions  MRS Benson that moment entered the room in the fixed concern that was visible in her face I read my impending misfortune She was followed by the physician but from him I could collect no comfort he even acknowledged to me that my mother was in great danger Shall I attempt to describe my  feelings to you on this occasion Oh no it is impossible to give you an idea of my distress I had sent back the carriage to town which returned again immediately with Mr Neville who had been informed by a billet from Mrs Benson of my mother's situation  THE most dutiful the most affectionate of sons could not have behaved otherwise than he did and I have the comfort to reflect that my mother to the last moment of her life was fully persuaded that I was perfectly happy in the choice she had made for me  I LEFT her no more after this day nor ever parted from her bedside a moment while she lived I had command enough over myself to suppress my sighs and tears that I might not interrupt that saintlike composure with which she waited for her dissolution All the moments that were not spent in her devotions she employed in consoling  fortifying and instructing me With the most pathetic sweetness she recommended me to my husband's care She intreated Mrs Benson to continue her friendship for me and heard with great satisfaction her promise never to forsake me She talked sensibly she reasoned justly to the last moment of her life It was not more than a quarter of an hour before she died when faintly pressing my hand which she held in her's and looking earnestly on me 'It has been said' said she  with more wit than truth that virtue was the most beautiful and the most unprofitable thing in the world Can that be called unprofitable which when supported by  give a calm like this  My heart sunk as it was with sorrow caught the enthusiasm of her words  'OH' cried I lifting up my swimming eyes to Heaven  may I die the death of the righteous and may my  latter end be like their's  A smile of joy beamed over her countenance now beginning to be overspread with the dark shades of deathonce more I felt the faint pressure of her hand now cold and clammy and withdrawing from mine To the last moment she kept her eyes fixed upon methen gently closing them her head sunk upon my bosom and with one soft sigh she breathed out her pure and innocent soul  HERE let me draw a veil over the sad scene that ensued My husband carried me in his arms and put me into the chariot where I continued without sense or motion till we arrived at our own house I had no reason to complain of his behaviour to me on this occasion it was tender affectionate and assiduous and filled my heart with the warmest sentiments of gratitude  MRS Benson came in the evening and spent two hours with me and then  returned to watch by the dear remains of her friend and benefactress Lord S desired to be at the expence of the funeral which was performed in a manner suitable to her birth and happier fortunes She lies in the family vault at Oh my Maria I must pause here for a while when I can detach my thoughts from this affecting subject I will continue my narration  As soon as I was recovered from a dangerous fever with which I was seized immediately after the death of my mother Lord S insisted upon my passing a few weeks at his countryseat with his lady and daughters Mr Neville was also invited but he pleaded business in town that required his attendance and contented himself with sometimes coming to pass a day or two with us  WHEN I returned to town I found Mrs Benson had with the concurrence of my husband settled all my mother's affairs She had taken lodgings in the same street where I lived that she might be near me and now my mind being a little more composed I thought it necessary to represent to Mr Neville that in the present state of our circumstances prudence required we should adopt some plan of living less expensive and more suitable to our income I took care to avoid giving this discourse the air of advice I even complimented his tenderness by ascribing to that motive the figure we had hitherto made which I said I was by no means intitled to  Mr Neville as usual answered his own thoughts 'I suppose' says he  you think it strange that I have not yet acquainted you with the manner in which I have disposed of your five  hundred pounds but the time has not been favourable for such discussions  'ALAS no' said I bursting into tears at the sad remembrance he excited by these last words 'And perhaps' pursued he  I have now introduced this subject unseasonably if you please we will talk no more of it at present  IT was not long however before he renewed it himself  I cannot submit to alter my mode of living  said he  and I cannot continue it without involving myself in difficultiesthere is no help for itwe must go abroad If your mother had lived I should have found it very difficult to have mentioned this to you again but as it is I think you can have no objection to changing the scene for a few years  MY surprise and confusion were so great at this unexpected declaration that I continued silent for some moments  during which his countenance was marked with so much impatience that I thought proper to tell him I would endeavour to overcome the reluctance I had to quit my native country and those few friends which the wreck of my fortunes had left me but he must permit me to say  that I wish this hard task had not been imposed upon me    He said that it was impossible for him to break through his engagement without bringing such a stain upon his honour as could never be wiped off  'Since that is the case' I replied 'I have nothing more to say' and from that moment I have never suffered him to perceive that I had any reluctance to this voyage  MY dear Mrs Benson goes with me She has nothing dearer she says than me in the world and no claims upon her that should hinder her from keeping the promise she made to my mother never to forsake me  Mr Neville seems to approve of her design I say  seems  because he never heartily approves of any thing that he is not the first mover of himself  You are now my dear Maria informed of all those circumstances of my life which led to my present situation Some particulars I wish indeed may be known to none but yourself for when I discover secrets to you I think I hide them Adieu  EUPHEMIA NEVILLE  LETTER XIII MISS HARLEY TO MRS NEVILLE  MY DEAR EUPHEMIA  WHAT an affecting narrative is your's If Nature herself could speak she could not make use of more significant terms You are above all praise therefore without incurring the guilt of making you vain I may venture to tell you how we talk of you here in our set 'She is a woman' said Mr Grevilie  either lifted up by her own strength above the passions of her sex or Nature hath exempted her from them by a peculiar privilege  'Miss Lumley' said my uncle  is indeed a wonderful young woman she had an excellent monitress in her mother and she has profited well both by her  lessons and example Young as she is she is strict in the performance of all her duties yet she affects no peculiar gravity in her aspect and manners but tempers her reserve with so much sweetness that without endeavouring to please any she pleases all the world  HAD any persons been present at this discourse who were ignorant of my sentiments for you they might have judged from my silence and discontented air that I was envious of your praises This is the friend thought I I must lose and she of whom hardly any man can be worthy must follow one who assuredly cannot be ranked among the best to the wilds of America  I AM afraid you will be angry with me my Euphemia for these impatient repinings and for profiting so little by the example you set me but you well know that there are some of us of such spirits that neither time nor  philosophy can work upon us while there are others again who prevent the work of time and philosophy by their own natural disposition  WE are going to spend a week at Mr Greville's he sets out today to prepare for our reception and two days afterwards we are to follow him My chief pleasure there as well as here will be writing to you I hope to have a letter from you before we leave the Hall Adieu my dear friend  MARIA HARLEY  LETTER XIV  MRS NEVILLE TO MISS HARLEY  YESTERDAY Mr Neville told me he had been to pay his respects to Colonel Bellenden whose first lieutenant he now is and who is appointed commander of the forces stationed at New York under the governor who it seems is captaingeneral The colonel introduced him to his lady and daughters he was greatly pleased with his reception and having desired leave to present me to Mrs Bellenden and the young ladies we received a polite invitation to dine there today which we accepted  Mr Neville is much out of humour that being still in mourning for my dear mother I cannot appear with eclat that is his expression in this my first visit He takes upon him to judge what ornaments I may wear with propriety and has actually laid out my jewels which he says will receive additional lustre from my sable habit  IT has been observed that obstinate persons are ever most obstinate in error Unhappily I experience the truth of this observation every day on some occasion or other When Mr Neville has once given his opinion however erroneous it may be it is impossible by argument to set him right for reason itself would seem to be wrong if it is not of his side I was sadly perplexed for I saw nothing but determined opposition would save me from an absurdity and upon this I could not resolve when fortunately for me he took it into his head to make an appeal to Mrs Benson who  sat smiling all the time without meddling in the dispute But first he endeavoured by a long speech to convince her that what he proposed was the fittest thing in the world to be done  'I KNOW not who it is' said Mrs Benson very gravely  who says that eloquence is that powerful efficacious and dangerous gift alike capable of persuading both to what is right and what is wrong There is no answering your arguments that is certain but you are too gallant not to yield up this point to Mrs Neville since the article of dress is entirely her own affair  'Oh to be sure' said Mr Neville  she is at liberty to dress as she pleases I only wanted to convince her I was right in what I proposed but I am satisfied if you think me so  HE was indeed satisfied with the compliment Mrs Benson paid to his eloquence yet he could not help now and  then returning to the charge with  How plainly you are dressed my dear if you would but add a few ornaments you would look much better  I constantly replied with a smile  Have you not said I should dress as I please  'Oh to be sure to be sure' he cried 'I shall never contradict you'and the next moment  Certainly my dear you might wear diamond earrings at least  But I see the chariot at the doormy husband is coming to fetch me I protest he surveys me with a look of disapprobation I must remind him of the compliment Mrs Benson paid him to put him in a good humour again Farewel my dear Maria I will give you an account of our new acquaintance when we return if we are not kept too late  TEN O'CLOCK  WE are just come homeMr Neville is engaged with a gentleman in the parlour who having business with him waited his return so I have an hour before supper which I shall devote to you my dear Maria to acquit myself of my promise  WE were set down at a handsome house in St James's Square and shewn into a genteel drawingroom into which immediately afterwards came Mrs Bellenden followed by three young ladies her daughters Mrs Bellenden is aboutfiveand forty years of age or something more She has in her youth been handsome though her complexion is brown for her features are regular and pleasing and her eyes remarkably fine She is well made her motions perfectly genteel and in her behaviour  she has all that easy politeness which distinguishes persons in a certain rank of life After saluting me with a mixture of ceremony and cordiality both as a stranger and one with whom an intimate connection was likely soon to take place she presented her three daughters to me by name  MISS Bellenden the eldest is about twoandtwenty tall and wellshaped and may doubtless be called a good figure yet her proportions are not fine and her motions want grace She is reckoned extremely handsome Mr Neville says and it is certain that she has a fine complexion and very regular features but they are merely regular cold and insipid Her eyes are not animated with any thing but motion and so totally devoid of expression that they may more properly be said to see than to look She made me a short compliment which gave me an opportunity of observing that the tones of her  voice are unpleasing and her expression confused  LOUISA the second daughter resembles her eldest sister in the delicacy of her complexion and the air of her features but has greatly the advantage of her in the elegance of her form which has besides more dignity in it than I ever remember to have seen in one so young This young lady is about fifteen she seems grave and reserved and returned my salute with a deep curtsey without scarce raising her eyes  CLARA the youngest daughter is about fourteen all life soul and sensibility She appeared in her impatience to salute me almost ready to prevent her mother who introduced her in her turn The same powerful sympathy drew me towards her I could scarcely help embracing her tenderly but I checked this involuntary emotion and confined myself to form How shall I  give you an idea of this amiable girl whose loveliness is rather felt than seen how paint the evervarying charms of a countenance which is never the same for three minutes together yet pleasing in every change She is not thought so handsome as either of her sisters her complexion being less fair and her features not so delicate Her eyes however are the finest in the world large dark full of fire full of softness languishing yet bright lively yet tender so full of expression that it is scarce necessary  her to speak the intelligence of her looks conveying her thoughts as distinctly as her words The make of her face is genteel and her smile bewitching She does not promise to be quite so tall as her eldest sister nor to equal her second in the dignity of her person but she excels them both in the elegance and symmetry of her form Her voice in speaking is so sweet so modulated that it is a kind of oratory in itself and persuades  as much as her words She continued to sit near me the whole day which gave me great pleasure  IN about half an hour after our arrival Colonel Bellenden entered the room With an air of easy dignity he apoligized to us for not being able to join us sooner having been detained at the coffee house by some persons of business It is impossible my dear Maria to look upon this gentleman without feeling for him even at first sight love esteem and reverence He has a fine figure a noble air a most engaging countenance in which every virtue that adorns the human heart is apparent He is not a man of letters having as he told us been a soldier from the age of fourteen but nature has given him an excellent understanding He talks little but that little is always to the purpose and he possesses so much natural grace that all he says and does is pleasing  SUCH my Maria is the family with whom I am to make a voyage to the New World and I believe you will not think I shall find it a difficult matter to pass my time agreeably with them  WHEN tea was announced we returned to the drawingroom leaving the two gentlemen to their wine Miss Bellenden then drawing her chair near me said in a low voice and a half sigh  Do you know Madam when this terrible voyage is to take place  'Not exactly Madam' I replied  but I am sorry to find you are so much afraid of the sea  'OH dear no' said she  I am not afraid of the sea I never thought about it but I am very sorry to leave England  'OH' said Clara  we shall find London in every place where there are balls and concerts and assemblies and plays    And who tells you  said Miss Bellenden  that there are any such things in the strange part of the world to which we are going  YOUR sister may have heard so from me  said Mrs Bellenden 'who seemed anxious to quiet her daughter's mind about these matters  I have been told by persons who have resided some years in the province of NewYork that it is a very gay place that the people are fond of polite amusements and are in general very well bred  That last article I found had great weight with Mrs Beilenden for she spoke it with an emphasis  'I AM informed too' proceeded Mrs Bellenden  that the air is pure the climate agreeable and the face of the country romantic and beautiful  THEN Clara will be delighted with it  said Miss Bellenden  for she would rather wander in woods and groves she says than mix in the most fashionable assemblies nay I have known her prefer a walk in the most solitary part of HydePark where she could see nothing but trees and grass than accompany me to the Mall when it has been so crowded with persons of fashion that we could hardly move  Here I observed Clara cast down her eyes and Miss Louisa smiling significantly  'Is solitude your taste too Miss' said I 'No indeed Madam' said she  I like to be among persons of fashion but not in such a crowd as my sister speaks of for then every body looks alike and there is no distinction of persons  FROM these lights thus artlessly held out it was no difficult matter to  discover the different dispositions of these young ladies which were made still plainer by the manner in which their portraits are taken by the inimitable pencil of Sir Joshua Reynolds whose pieces are so full of mind that you have the character as well as form of those who sit to him But I am interrupted with a summons to supper and as I shall not have an opportunity of filling up the remainder of my paper till tomorrow I will here bid you good night  MRS NEVILLE IN CONTINUATION  THE Colonel and Mr Neville having joined us Mrs Bellenden carried us into her dressingroom to look at her daughters' pictures 'I was resolved' said she  to have them drawn before we left England and by our great artist because they are designed for presents to some of their nearest relations  SHE then directed my eyes to the portrait of Miss Bellenden which was placed in the most conspicuous part of the room It is a wholelength and finely executed She is dressed for a masquerade her habit that of a Circassian Lady she holds her masque in one hand and with the other adjusts a curl of her bright auburn hair which seems falling on her ivory neck her countenance expresses all the selfcomplacency of conscious beauty and communicates to the spectator part of that pleasure which she herself feels in the contemplation of it  WHILE I was gazing attentively upon this finished piece Miss Bellenden who seemed impatient for my opinion glided up to me and said in a loud whisper  the painter has flattered me excessively yet I think there is some resemblance  MR Neville took the word and in a high strain of compliment expatiated  upon the beauties of the picture and the skill of the artist  MISS Bellenden smiled and interrupting him at last said  but I would have Mrs Neville's opinion  THE painter has done you justice Madam  said I 'and only justice'  'AH' replied she  I perceive you can compliment as well as your lord here  I LEFT it to Mr Neville to satisfy the lady's scruples about our veracity and turned my eyes upon Miss Louisa's picture her dress is a robe of pale blue sattin ornamented with festoons of flowers her hair hangs in loose ringlets upon her fine turned neck and its luxurious growth about the forehead and temples is confined by a tiara of pearls she is represented standing in a garden her left arm leaning on a marble column  her right extended towards a beautiful little boy as if to receive a small basket of flowers which he offers her Her attitude is extremely graceful and calculated to mark the dignity of her form she smiles upon the child who presents her with the flowers who seems to have gathered them from a parterre at a distance to which he points There is a beautiful distinction between the flowers on her robe and those in the basket we see that the former are artificial only because they are contrasted with the others which look like nature itself  'You have gazed long enough' said the colonel  upon these two fine ladies now let me have your opinion of my little pastoral nymph here  Miss Louisa while we were looking at her picture stood by with an air quite easy and unconcerned and replied to our compliments no otherwise than by a respectful curtsey  My attention was now fixed upon the picture of my young favourite which both for design and execution is one of the most pleasing pieces I ever saw She is represented in a wood and as just risen from the foot of a spreading oak her book a large folio volume lying near it a young fawn at a distance seems hastening to hide itself in a thicket a length of ribband which it trails along shews that it has been her captive and has made its escape she seems springing forwards to recover it a sweet anxiety is expressed in her animated countenance her hair is tied behind with a ribband and floats in the wind The admirable symmetry of her form is shewn to advantage by a thin white robe which she gathers up with one hand that it may not impede her flight the other she holds out invitingly towards the little animal I perceived the book was lettered on the back it was Sidney's Arcadia I smiled  That is a romance is it not Madam  said  Mrs Bellenden  Clara is very fond of those sort of books too fond I think  Clara blush'd and seemed apprehensive of more rebukes on this subject  It is a romance Madam  said I  but it is a very ingenious work and contains excellent lessons of morality it was wrote by one of the bravest soldiers and most accomplished gentlemen of the age he lived in an age too that was fruitful in great men  I SEE you are an advocate for romances Mrs Neville  said Mrs Bellenden half grave and half smiling  and indeed you are still of an age to relish them  I smiled assentingly and the Colonel leading me again to the drawingroom the discourse turned upon matters relating to our intended voyage and the country we were going to till it was time to take leave  I AM apprehensive this voyage will take place sooner than I expected but I  could easily reconcile myself to all the difficulties of it except parting with you my dear MariaAlas this is a subject I dare not trust myself to write on  THIS moment your short letter which to make amends for its shortness it must be owned is very sweet is brought me By lavishing such praises on me you do me a favour no doubt but I cannot say you do me justice and you seem to have a design to please me at the hazard of offending truth But you will tell me these high commendations come from your uncle and Mr Greville'Tis well I will rate them then at their just value for do we not all know my dear Maria what politeness obliges men of wit and gallantry to when ladies are the subjects of their panegyric but enough of this Write to me soon let me know all that passes in this little excursion every thing interests me that relates to you Adieu  EUPHEMIA NEVILLE  LETTER XV MISS HARLEY TO MRS NEVILLE  MY DEAR EUPHEMIA  IT is some comfort to me to reflect that if you must take this hated voyage the Bellenden family will afford you agreeable companions in it Mr Greville is well acquainted with the Colonel he speaks of him with a kind of enthusiasm In the language of Pope he cried out  A wit's a feather a chief's a rod  An honest man's the noblest work of God  'Colonel Bellenden' said he  is that noblest work and to this truth the candid bear testimony by their words and detractors by their silence  I asked him his opinion of the ladies  'MRS Bellenden' he said  by her politeness and attention to please supplies in some degree the defect of her education which being confined to mere accomplishments as they are called has left the nobler powers of her mind uncultivated She sings well she dances finely she performs on the harpsichord with great skill she can carry on the small talk of a teatable in French draws prettily and is allowed to shade her flowers in embroidery extremely well but her reading has been wholly confined to her Psalter and Bible a few devotional tracts and some sermons and among profane authors the Seven Champions of Christendom pamphlets poems and some other works of the same kind She has a great contempt for what she calls booklearning in women and thinks chastity and good breeding for so she pairs them the highest of female virtues She is an obedient wife a tender mother and  an easy companion is gentle in her censures of her acquaintance except when they offend against the laws of modesty or the rules of ceremony and then it must be owned she is very severe  'YOUR characters' said I  seem to be drawn with so much skill that I wish to have Miss Bellenden's by the same hand She will be the companion of my dear friend in a long voyage and I shall be happy to know that she will be an agreeable one  'I DO not' said Mr Greville  think Miss Bellenden qualified to be an agreeable companion to one of your friend's solid understanding but she is goodtempered and will not give offence she is very handsome and has no idea of any higher excellence in women than beauty she is greedy of admiration and would be a coquet if she had wit enough to secure her  conquests but although nature directs her to throw the bait and the gaudy fry often catch at it yet she has not skill enough to bring her prey to land and they always escape her These disappointments affect her but little for a constant succession of new conquests keeps her in good humour with her own charms and leaves her no leisure to regret that their effect is not lasting  HER two sisters are too young to have any character yet but they are both fine girls in their persons and Clara the youngest seems I think to give the promise of being superior to the others in the endowments of her mind  My friend has found that out already  said I 'Then' replied Mr Greville  I shall have some opinion of my own penetration  MY uncle this moment sends to let me know that he is ready and the carriage  is at the gate We are to spend a week at least at Mr Greville's and from thence my next letter will be dated unless I should find leisure to write to you at the inn where my uncle puts up the first night Ever ever your's  MARIA HARLEY  LETTER XVI  MISS HARLEY TO MRS NEVILLE  Bell Inn  HERE we are my dear Euphemia somewhat fatigued with our journey for the roads were very heavy and the day unpleasant and to complete our dissatisfaction we met with some disagreeable occurrences on our arrival at this place which have had a surprising effect on my uncle's temper and for which at present I can by no means account  WHEN our carriage drove into the innyard a young gentleman who was talking to Mrs Deering the landlady hastily advanced and with great politeness offered his hand to help me out  he bowed low to my uncle and observing that he descended with some difficulty he assisted him with equal attention my uncle thanked him very cordially which the young gentleman answered only by a most respectful bow and withdrew Both my uncle and I thought him extremely handsome and indeed my dear Euphemia he has a most engaging countenance and is one of the finest figures I ever saw  MRS Deering having conducted us to a parlour appeared to be in some confusion 'Your honour' said she  used always to give me notice when you intended to come here and then I prepared every thing for your reception  'AND have you not had notice' said my uncle  I sent Robert before me early in the morning  'Indeed Sir' said she  not a soul has been here from you and I am in the greatest quandary  in the world for I have not a bed for your honour my house is so full I can make a shift to accommodate the young lady if she will put up with a little bed in a dark closet and her maid can sleep with one of mine but the room your honour used always to have is engaged by that young gentleman you saw in the yard and I have not another room in the house but what is taken up  MY uncle fretted very much at this disappointment and at the negligence of the groom  What is to be done Maria  said he to me  do you think you can bear the fatigue of travelling to the next stage this cold dark night  'I CAN bear it very well Sir' said I  but I am sure you cannot therefore I must entreat that you will accept of the dark room and the little bed Mrs Deering talks of and Fanny shall sit up with me in this room here are two  easy chairs and if I can get a book I shall pass my time well enough  I cannot consent to that  said my uncle then turning to Mrs Deering who had uttered a thousand good lacks all the time he ordered her to get a boiled chicken forsupper and in the mean time he would resolve upon something  I CONTINUED to press my uncle to agree to my proposal which he could not prevail upon himself to approve  ALL this time we heard nothing of the groom The night became wet and stormy I trembled for my uncle's health for he was immoveable in his resolution not to let me sit up all night but rather to go forward to the next stage when Mrs Deering entered the room smiling and told us that the young gentleman who had engaged the room hearing of the inconveniences we were likely to suffer for want of an apartment had politely resigned it to  my uncle and was actually set out on horseback in the midst of the storm in order to reach the house of a friend who lived about ten miles distant  'BLESSINGS on his heart for it' said Mrs Deering  it was as good a deed as ever was done and it was all his own offer  MY uncle appeared very much affected with this young man's civility 'Who is he' said he to Mrs Deering  I hope I shall have an opportunity some time or other of thanking him  'He is your namesake' said Mrs Deering  'HARLEY' interrupted my uncle impatiently 'Who's son is he'  He is son to the Reverend Doctor Harley  answered Mrs Deering  and is just returned from Germany He was sent to get his learning at a  Versity  there because his father it seems is not rich and could not maintain him at one of our own  Versities  My uncle had been used to this good woman's language and was able to listen to her gravely but it was with some difficulty that I could help smiling However my mirth was immediately clouded when casting my eyes upon my uncle I perceived all the marks of astonishment anger and confusion in his countenance  'PRAY hasten supper' said he to Mrs Deering at the same time making a motion to her with his hand to be gone She left the room and he continued to walk about in it silently with a hasty unequal step  My astonishment at this evident discomposure kept me silent also for some moments At length I asked him if  any thing extraordinary had happened to make him uneasy  'YES' replied he throwing himself into a chair  I have reason to be uneasy when contrary to my intentions I am laid under obligations to persons I hate This young fellow has insulted me by his mockcivility Cannot you guess who he is  Is he not Sir  said I 'related to us'  HE is so to your and my misfortune  said he  His father is my enemy my mortal enemy and upon him since I have no male heir my estates are entailed Oh that my brother had left me a son instead of a daughter  'WELL Sir' said I endeavouring to laugh him out of his ill humour  it is always misfortune enough to be a woman without any aggravation But I am not avaricious and you have  made me as rich as I desire to be I wish indeed your heir was more worthy of your regard But has this young man affronted you as well as his father  'His father is a villain' cried my uncle starting from his chair and pacing again furiously about the room then suddenly stopping and grasping my hand eagerly  'OH Maria' said he  I have cause for hatred that base man betrayed me betrayed me in the tenderest point betrayed me who was his kinsman his friend his benefactor  HIS voice failed his eyes filled with tears he turned from me and throwing himself again into his chair fixed his looks altered as they were from rage to melancholy stedfastly upon the fire  WHILE he continued in this affecting silence I could not refrain from tears which I endeavoured to conceal upon Mrs Deering's entrance with supper Sir John was so absorbed in thought that he did not perceive she was in the room I drew near to tell him softly that supper was on the table  'I HOPE his Honour is not ill' said Mrs Deering coming up officiously towards him 'Sir John is fatigued' said I 'with his journey'  Ah no doubt of it  said she  What a mercy it was that his honour did not go further tonight Blessings on good young Mr Harley for leaving us his bed  At that name my uncle started up in some emotion and then for the first time perceiving our loquacious landlady he recollected himself and drew his chair near the table  'IT is a bitter night' pursued she  poor heart I warrant he is drenched through with the rain by this time but as long as his Honour is safe and warm I am contented  SENSIBLE how much my uncle must suffer in the present state of his mind by this woman's idle talk I desired her to get his apartment ready for him as soon as possible 'for I suppose Sir' said I  you will choose to retire when you have supped  'Certainly' he said upon which Mrs Deering withdrew  MY uncle still pensive and silent carved the chicken helped me and himself but scarce ate any thing and my supper being finished as soon as his he drank one glass of wine and ordering his valet who attended to light him to his room he wished me a good night and left me  I WAS glad to be alone that I might give free vent to my tears for the gentle melancholy my uncle fell into after the first sallies of his anger were over affected me greatly I could have wished he had opened his heart to me and acquainted me with the cause of his enmity against his kinsman That there was no cordiality nor correspondence between them I knew but I never imagined their differences were of a nature to excite such a strong and lasting enmity But what has this poor young man done to deserve so great a share of my uncle's dislike for it seems he never saw him before and was disposed to like him till he heard his name and indeed it must be acknowledged that he has something extremely interesting in his countenance and his person and address are engaging to a great degree Poor youth his complaisance may probably cost him dear the night is dark and stormy his road lies across the country and he has ten miles to travel with no attendant  but an old countryman whom at a large expence he hired to serve him as a guide  HERE is Mrs Deering with her alasses again she puts a thousand frightful thoughts into one's head I have always observed that low people take a pleasure in creating fears when there is no cause for them and in aggravating them when there is But I will go tobed I am tired but not sleepy I have been writing ever since my uncle left meGood night my dear Euphemia  THREE O'CLOCK  I CANNOT sleep the tempest without is so violent and to say the truth the agitations of my mind have raised a kind of tempest within me I am risen and I am got again to my pen I dread the seeing my uncle his uneasiness affects me greatly Methinks I can now  account for his illsuited marriage with Miss FenwickDoubtless he hoped for an heir to disappoint the expectations of his hated kinsman and his race But why should his race be hated too Whatever the father's guilt may be ought it to involve the innocent son Bless me there is a loud knocking at the gate This stormy night has driven some bewildered travellers hither Poor Mr Harley perhaps he too may be in difficulties Good Heaven how they thunder at the gate This impatience speaks some emergency So the house is roused I perceive my window looks into the innyard cold and dreary as it is I must open it and see what is the matter  A POST chaise drives into the yard they help a man out of it who seems to be hurt some dreadful accident has happened I must ring for somebody to come to me I am terrified and cannot bear to be alone  ALAS my dear Euphemia the wounded man I saw brought in is Mr Harley My maid whom the noise had wakened came to my chamber I sent her to make some enquiries she returned with my uncle's groom who told me that the young gentleman was dangerously hurt I was excessively angry with this fellow by whose neglect all this mischief has been brought about I could hardly bear him in my sight yet I was impatient to know how he happened to be in Mr Harley's company for he was in the chaise with him it seems he told me after some awkward excuses for his transgression which I impatiently interrupted that having met with a brother who was just returned from sea and whom he had not seen for many years he was by him persuaded to go into a public house where drink and discourse beguiled the time he said in such a manner that it was late in the evening before they parted but the storm was so violent  that he could not have proceeded if he had not met with a returned postchaise the driver of which was his acquaintance who invited him to take a seat in it he set out with his friend who promised to leave him at this inn In their way they were alarmed with the cries of a man who begged them to alight and assist a gentleman whose horse had thrown him and who he believed was dangerously hurt this was poor Mr Harley my dear They found him lying under a tree which afforded him but indifferent shelter against the rain and in this condition it seems he had remained near an hour being unable to rise much less to sit his horse and in all this time no carriage of any sort had passed by till their arrival his guide poor fellow had taken off his own great coat to cover the poor youth as he lay supporting his head upon his knees hollowing in vain for help where there was none to hear and uncertain whether he ought to leave him in that  condition to seek for assistance or stay near him in expectation that Providence would send them relief  WITH some difficulty they raised him and put him into the chaise Robert supporting him in it The humanity he had shewn upon this occasion prevented any further reproaches from me for his negligence and I promised to prevail with my uncle to pardon him who upon the report of what had happened had risen and having sent to know if I was up desired I would come to him in the parlour He took notice that my eyes were red  I do not blame you for your sensibility  said he  I am concerned as well as you for the accident that has happened to this young man That I should be undesignedly made in part the occasion of it is one of those good turns which I am used to meet with from that family  I PERCEIVED he was in an ill humour so I made him no answer to this speech which I thought was a very strange one at this time He walked hastily backwards and forwards in the room as his manner is when he is vexed  'I HAVE sent to tell Mrs Deering' said he  that she may accommodate her guest with my bed which I have left for that purpose so there I think we are even  There was no answering to this you know so I was still silent  'I AM impatient to be gone' pursued he  therefore ring and order some breakfast to be prepared immediately we will set out as soon as it is light  I RUNG and my maid appearing I ordered her to get breakfast ready  for I suppose  said I  they have business enough below to employ them  My uncle looked withfully at Fanny then at me as if desirous to know what was passing I asked no questions though  I was really in a great deal of anxiety myself being resolved to see how far good nature would work He seemed disappointed when Fanny went out of the room and going to the door called her back  'WHY do you not tell us' said he 'how the gentleman is'  He is very bad Sir  said Fanny  he is very much bruised and has got a large cut on the side of his head for it seems he fell against a huge stone that lay in the road Mrs Deering says he bleeds like a pig and he has fainted away twice There is no surgeon to be had nearer than the next town and that is seven miles off  MY uncle now walked about faster than before 'Cursed accident' muttered he then suddenly stopping  Is any one gone for this surgeon  asked he hastily Fanny told him a man and horse were gone full speed  Well make haste with breakfast  said he  it grows light and tell the men to get the carriage ready I will be gone immediately  MRS Deering brought in the chocolate herself and told us that as good luck would have it one of her guests being a physical gentleman had visited Mr Harley who was now in bed that he said he ought to be bled immediately and undertook to do it himself though he did not practise that profession that he had  subscribed  something to anoint his bruises and to compose him to sleep and that he was actually in a fine breathing sweat and was very quiet  SIR John I could observe listened to her strange jargon very attentively which at any other time would have made me smile But I was really concerned for the young gentleman extremely concerned it was natural I should be so for he is our kinsman you  know and whatever may be his father's demerits he is blameless  MY uncle heard all she said without making any reply and having drank his chocolate seated himself in an easy chair complaining that he was very sleepy I retired to my own room and wrote thus far expecting to be soon summoned to depart for I see the coach is drawn out Methinks I could with the surgeon was come that we might have his opinion of the poor young man's case common humanity you know my dear would suggest this Sure Sir John will not go till he knows what degree of danger Mr Harley is in I was mistaken he sends this moment to know if I am ready Well I will attend him  Greville Park  I AM retired for the night to my own chamber the fatigue and agitation of the day affording me a reasonable excuse  for desiring early rest but I shall devote an hour or two to you before I go tobed  I TOLD you my uncle sent to let me know he was ready to set out from the inn and I hastened down to him I found him reading a newspaper and so leisurely that he even read all the advertisements at length he laid down the paper walked to the window and looked at his watch My maid coming in with my cloak he asked her  If the surgeon was come  She answered 'No' but that the coach was ready' I rose up my uncle gave me his hand I thought we were going away immediately when he stopped short at the parlour door 'I fancy Maria' said he  you would be glad of a dish of tea before you go you have had very little rest it will refresh you and you are not used to breakfast upon chocolate  IT appeared to me that my uncle was desirous of staying till the surgeon  came though he would not own it I accepted his proposal and tea was ordered In about half an hour afterwards Fanny told us the surgeon was come 'Well' said my uncle with an assumed carelessness  we shall now hear his opinion of this case  And accordingly Mrs Deering came in a great hurry to tell us  'WELL Heaven be praised' said she  matters are not so bad as we imagined Surgeon Parker has examined the wound and shook his head but says he hopes it will not be attended with very great danger He is a fine man he will cure him if any body can He says the young gentleman is very much bruised but he hopes not dangerously and his fever is pretty high but he hopes not dangerous He says he must be kept quiet for it will be a work of time to set him upon his legs again Oh he is a fine man the young gentleman will be very safe in  his hands But I must go and get ready the things he has  subscribed  for him  And accordingly she left us in as great a hurry as she came in  'I FANCY this fine man' said my uncle half smiling  will make a fine job of this  Then pausing a little the wounded gentleman' said he  is probably not provided with money enough to answer such extraordinary expences as he may be brought into and the wretch his father lives at a great distance can you think of any method Maria of conveying this to him  taking a banknote of fifty pounds out of his pocketbook  it will hurt his delicacy I suppose to put it into Mrs Deering's hands for his use  I could have wished my uncle had completed this act of benevolence by making Mr Harley a visit and giving it to himself but I durst not mention this to him  'THERE is no other way Sir' said I  than to inclose it and send it to him by Mrs Deering  He said that would do and taking his hat walked into the garden to give me an opportunity Accordingly I inclosed the note in a blank sheet of paper and sealed it with my own cypher I then sent for Mrs Deering and desired her to deliver it to Mr Harley herself She told me he was asleep which I was glad to hear and smiling significantly assured me he should have it as soon as he waked She was going to oppress me with her usual loquacity but my uncle coming in she stopped short He gave me his hand to lead me to the coach and we drove away immediately my uncle not once speaking to me till we came within five miles of Grevillepark when he perceived Mr Greville on horse back coming to meet us and he pointed him out to me  MR GREVILLE full of the pleasure this visit gave him said a great many civil thing to me and thanked Sir John for the favour he did him in prevailing upon me to accompany him But my uncle continued to be grave and pensive so that when we arrived at the Park Mr Greville as he handed me out of the coach expressed some surprise at the humour his friend seemed to be in and asked me in a whisper What was the matter I replied That we had met with some disagreeable accidents at the inn which I supposed Sir John would acquaint him with and that I should then expect an explanation from him for I knew he was too much in his confidence to be ignorant of any thing that materially concerned him  THIS iS a delightful seat my dear Euphemia sweetly romantic in its situation and prospects The house is not very large but elegant and furnished with great taste I complimented the  housekeeper who is a grave matronly woman upon the exquisite neatness that reigned in all the apartments That which is allotted for me during my stay is one of the best  I HAVE had a long conversation with Mr Greville this morning My uncle being a little fatigued with his journey did not accompany us in our walk in the park which is a very extensive one I was impatient to know what had passed between them after I left them last night concerning our adventures on the road and Mr Greville to my wish entered of himself into the subject  So Sir John has seen his young kinsman  said he  I find It must have been a trying interview for him and no doubt opened all those wounds which neither time nor reason have been able entirely to heal  'What are those wounds' said I  which in a mind so generous as my uncle's naturally is could produce such fatal effects as to make him confound innocence with guilt and reject the blameless son for the faults of the offending father Yet it must be owned that angry as he was he forgot not the duties of humanity  'THAT is exactly my friend' replied Mr Greville  his passions may sometimes mislead him but his inclinations are always good and never fail to bring him again into the right path But you will not be surprised at the continuance of his resentment against the father when you know the injuries he has received from him and I have his leave to make you acquainted with them  For I am not willing  said he  that my niece should think meanly of me as she probably will till she is convinced that my resentment  is but proportioned to the offence that has been given me  You must know then that Sir John and Dr Harley had contracted a great friendship for each other in their early youth They received the first rudiments of their education at the same academy and were sent together to the same university Dr Harley's father was but in indifferent circumstances and would have found it very difficult to have supported his son at college had not his expences been liberally supplied by your uncle whose father Sir Henry Harley gave him a very large allowance The two friends were inseparable and their mutual attachment was so steady and so ardent that they were called Pilades and Orestes Mr Harley your uncle during one of the vacations became acquainted in a gentleman's family the daughter of which was exquisitely  handsome and highly accomplished for her father having no fortune to give her was at an expence for her education which but little suited his circumstances not doubting but her beauty aided by such advantages would procure her a very honourable establishment Your uncle conceived a violent passion for her he made her a declaration of it which was not ill received but the prudent young lady referred him to her father which put matters in such a train that your uncle was soon engaged in a formal matrimonial address which for the present however was to be carried on secretly as it was not expected that Sir Henry would be easily prevailed upon to give his consent and the young gentleman was still master enough of himself to reject all thoughts of a complete disobedience  HIS young kinsman you may be sure became his confident and he  undertook to manage a correspondence between the lovers which for some time was carried on undiscovered at length some hints of the affair had been given to Sir Henry who when his son came next to visit him caused him to be watched so closely that he soon became master of the whole secret He came to an explanation with his son who had too much candour to deny his attachment to Miss Denby but assured him that he never entertained a thought of engaging himself further without his consent  SIR HENRY seemed satisfied with this assurance and gave him to understand that he relied entirely upon his honour and expected that he would break off this connexion and to make all sure proposed that he should set out immediately upon his travels This was a sad stroke Mr Harley endeavoured to ward it off by many bad arguments which he brought to prove  that it would be better to defer this expedition for a year at least  SIR HENRY who never had recourse to authority when the case in question could be decided by reason was sensible that to combat passion with remonstrances was engaging with unequal arms therefore he put an end to the debate with a positive  I will have it so  and preparations were immediately made for his departure  THE lovers at parting exchanged a thousand vows of constancy and their faithful confident promised to manage their correspondence as usual which went on unsuspected for near a year when Mr Harley's governor discovered it by chance and gave immediate notice to Sir Henry  THE Baronet began now to apprehend very serious consequences from a passion which had stood the test of  time and absence and the active part young Harley had taken in the affair giving him just offence he sent for him in order to reprove him severely for it Mr Harley finding it in vain to deny the truth to one who was too well informed pleaded in his own excuse the force of friend ship and in your uncle's the fascinating power of Miss Denby's charms and on this last point he spoke so feelingly as put a scheme into Sir Henry's head which if it succeeded would effectually prevent the misfortune he feared from his son's imprudent attachment  DROPPING therefore the first severity of his tone and aspect he began to expostulate mildly with him  "IF my son" said he  continues his addresses to this girl he will offend me greatly but if he should be mad enough to marry her never let him hope for my pardon I will  banish him from my heart and from my sight for ever tell him this and use all your influence with him to prevent such an insult to parental authority in doing so you will shew your friendship to him and will secure mine to yourself  MR Harley's father was lately dead and had left him a very small fortune he had taken orders but had little hopes of obtaining any preferment in the church but by the interest of Sir Henry He perceived all the advantages of this opening towards gaining his confidence and friendship and Sir Henry was convinced by the suppleness of his answers that it would not be a very difficult matter to lead him as far as he pleased He resolved therefore to explain his whole design at once founding his hopes of success in it on the observations he had made on the warmth with which the young man expatiated upon the beauty and merit of Miss Denby He knew that  the shortest way to persuade was to please therefore he instantly proposed to him to marry the young lady himself whom he would portion with a thousand pounds and give him the reversion of the living of which was worth three hundred pounds a year and was likely to be soon vacant the present incumbent being then above fourscore  THE once faithful Pilades could not resist these strong temptations he sacrificed his Orestes without scruple persuading himself that the friendship he had vowed for him required that he should use every means in his power to prevent his incurring the guilt of disobedience to his fathers and knowing that in great affairs there are no small steps he went boldly to work represented to Mr Denby the danger of offending a man so powerful by his fortune and interest as Sir Henry Harley by encouraging his son's clandestine address to Miss Denby that  the young gentleman himself did not entertain a thought of marrying her without his father's consent which would never be obtained that the Baronet's death alone could open a prospect of success in this affair and this prospect considering the vigour of his years and constitution was very remote He advised him therefore to listen to another proposal for his daughter which though not so splendid yet was certain and might be productive of more happiness  MR Denby was a reasonable man he considered that nothing is less certain than the futurenothing apter to deceive than hope He was anxious to settle his daughter and resolved not to reject a present good for the bare possibility of a greater in future and after some reflection desired Mr Harley to explain himself which he accordingly did relating very candidly Sir Henry's proposal for even  knaves can be honest when their interest points that way  THE two gentlemen were soon agreed the greatest difficulty seemed to be the persuading Miss Denby to this new regulationbut even this was got over in a little time either because the young lady's passion for her absent lover was not very violent or she had given way to a growing inclination for the present or what indeed was most likely the precarious condition of her fortune her sole dependence being upon the life of her father whose health was declining and whose income arising from a place in the revenue did not enable him to lay up any thing for her future support  SIR Henry had soon the satisfaction to hear that this marriage was completed he performed the first part of his promise immediately and caused the  thousand pounds he gave Miss Denby to be settled on herself and in a very few weeks he was enabled to perform the second part of it the living became vacant and Mr Harley was put in possession of it  YOUR uncle was at Brussels on his way to England when he heard of this marriage which upon report he did not believe but a letter from his father put it past a doubt He received one at the same time from Dr Harley which he returned unopened He made no reproaches he expressed no resentment satisfied with the resolution he had taken never for the future to hold any converse with a man who had so basely betrayed him he confined his grief and rage within his own breast and in his letter to his father took not the least notice of what had happened but desired he would approve of his intention to continue abroad some time longer  DR Harley was deeply wounded by the contemptuous silence of his injured friend which carried with it more keen reproach than the severest invectives His remorse it was said cost him a fit of sickness and he had the mortification to find that Sir Henry though he profited by his treachery yet despised him for it confining his acknowledgments to the bare performance of his promise withoutkeeping up any correspondence with him or pushing his interest any further  YOUR uncle continued on the continent three years longer visiting most of the European courts and being furnished with remittances to make a large expence he amused himself so effectually that he returned to England perfectly cured of his passion but retaining all his resentment against the perfidious pair who had so basely betrayed him  SIR Henry pressed him to marry to which he seemed greatly averse and when his father to prevail upon him mentioned the entail of his estates upon Mr Harley in default of issue in his line your uncle said his brother's marriage might as effectually prevent that misfortune as his Accordingly Mr Edward Harley was with the consent of all parties married to your amiable mother and Sir Henry before he died had the satisfaction to be grandfather to three fine boys and yourself It pleased Heaven however to take your brother to himself and your parents too much affected with their loss followed them in a few months Then it was that your uncle resolved upon marriage but was not able to fix till he saw Miss Fenwick A most judicious choice as it has proved and he has now the mortification to know that the person whom he hates most and has most  reason to hate plumes himself with the hope of succeeding to his fortune  THIS was what Mr Greville told me my dear Euphemia and it must be confessed that my uncle's fixed resentment against the elder Mr Harley is very justifiable It was natural you know my dear to be a little inquisitive about the character of the son Mr Greville it seems knows him very well having met him several times in company since his return from Leyden He speaks of his merit in very high terms he says he is a most amiable youth is possessed of a fine understanding and besides being an excellent scholar is highly accomplished He resembles his father he says in nothing but the graces of his person and even in these he has the advantage of him  'HE would be no bad representative' added Mr Greville  of the honours  of your family but if it be true what some have observed that the qualities of the mind are hereditary though the order of succession is not always observed young Harley may have a son that will resemble his grandfather and disgrace those honours  I SMILED at this conceit and I must confess I was glad to hear so good an account of the young man for I was willing to be justified in the favourable prepossession I mean the good opinion I had conceived of him from his very polite and engaging behaviour  Mr Greville told me that he would dispatch a man and horse today to the Bell Inn to know how the young gentleman is and by some means or other  said he  I will contrive to let Sir John know the state of his health about which I am sure he has good nature enough to be anxious though he will not own it  OUR walk ended with this little history My uncle himself mentioned Mr Harley and said he should be glad to know if the young man's hurt was really as bad as the surgeon represented it  'WE shall know presently' said Mr Greville  for I ordered Will as he passed by the Bell Inn to enquire he must be come back I suppose by this time  He rang the bell and Will himself appeared  Well how is the wounded gentleman  said Sir John carelessly 'Sir' replied the man  he is much better so well indeed that he talks of setting out tomorrow in a post chaise for his father's house but the surgeon and Mrs Deering say he is mad to think of any such thing and would fain have him stay a week longer at least but the young gentleman seems to be a very positive young gentleman and will do as he pleases  WHEN William left the room my uncle said he was glad the young man was not likely to be a great sufferer by his civility which whether it proceeded said he from an interested policy or real benevolence I profited by and therefore owed him my thanks for it and now that the matter is all over I must insist upon never having his name mentioned to me again  HE spoke this with so severe a look and in so firm an accent that Mr Greville did not think fit to make any reply much less did I you may be sure But is this just my dear Euphemia to shew so much rancour Rancour did I say no that is too harsh a word My uncle is incapable of harbouring any rancour in his breast but so much dislike to one who never offended him one whose amiable qualities yes I think that praise may be allowed to him from what we observed of his behaviour even though Mr Greville may have  drawn his character with some exaggeration But why should one suppose that Mr Greville whose penetration and sincerity nobody ever called in question could either be mistaken in the character of this youth or draw it in false colours If then he is what he represents him to be and what his behaviour to us gives us reason to think he is I must say it is unreasonable nay it is unjust in my uncle to confound him with his unworthy parents and make him answerable for their faults  I EXPECTED to have had a letter from you by yesterday's post How does it happen that I am disappointed Does the Bellenden family engross you wholly Have you not a few moments to spare to your friend Let me not accuse you of neglect my Euphemia at this time it would affect me greatly I am lowspiritedI know not why but I am really so and yet have I not  too much cause for low spiritsare we not to be separated perhaps for ever Mr Greville quarrels with me for spending so many hours in the Park its romantic scenes charm me  solitude is the nurse of tender thought  the poet says and in the silence and gloom of these shades I undergo the melancholy reveries of divided friendshipdivided but never to be lessened Yes my dear Euphemia I think of you with more tenderness than ever my fortitude has quite forsaken me and my tears flow at the bare idea of our separation How then shall I suppress the trial when it comes But I must lay down my pen Mr Greville makes an entertainment tomorrow for some of the neighbouring families who come to welcome us to this part of the country and my maid tells me it is time to dress The post carries you a large packet this time Adieu  MARIA HARLEY
