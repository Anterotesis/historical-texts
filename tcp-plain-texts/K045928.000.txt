 SPEECH OF EDMUND BURKE ESQ ON AMERICAN TAXATION APRIL  LONDON PRINTED FOR J DODSLEY IN PALLMALL MDCCLXXV  PREFACE  THE following Speech has been much the subject of conversation and the desire of having it printed was last summer very general The means of gratifying the public curiosity were obligingly furnished from the notes of some Gentlemen Members of the last Parliament  This piece has been for some months ready for the press But a delicacy possibly over scrupulous has delayed the publication to this time The friends of administration have been used to attribute a great deal of the opposition to their measures in America to the writings published in England The Editor of this Speech kept it back until all the measures of government have had their full operation and can be no longer affected if ever they could have been affected by any publication  Most Readers will recollect the uncommon pains taken at the beginning of the last session of the last Parliament and indeed during the whole course of it to asperse the characters and decry the measures of those who were supposed to be friends  to America in order to weaken the effect of their opposition to the acts of rigour then preparing against the Colonies This Speech contains a full refutation of the charges against that party with which Mr Burke has all along acted In doing this he has taken a review of the effects of all the schemes which have been successively adopted in the government of the Plantations The subject is interesting the matters of information various and important and the publication at this time the Editor hopes will not be thought unseasonable  SPEECH OF EDMUND BURKE ESQ  DURING the last Session of the last Parliament on the th of April Mr Rose Fuller Member for Rye made the following motion That an Act made in the seventh Year of the reign of his present Majesty intituled  "An Act for granting certain Duties in the British Colonies and Plantations in America for allowing a Drawback of the Duties of Customs upon the Exportation from this Kingdom of Coffee and Cocoa Nuts of the Produce of the said Colonies or Plantations for discontinuing the Drawbacks payable on China Earthen Ware exported to America and for more effectually preventing the clandestine running of Goods in the said Colonies and Plantations"  might be read  And the same being read accordingly He moved  "That this House will upon this day seven night resolve itself into a Committee of the whole House to take into consideration the duty of d  per  pound weight upon tea payable in all his Majesty's Dominions in America imposed by the said Act and also the appropriation of the said duty"  On this latter motion a warm and interesting debate arose in which Mr Edmund Burke spoke as follows  SIR  I Agree with the Honourable Gentleman  Charles Wolsran Cornwall  Esq  lately appointed one of the Lords of the Treasury  who spoke last that this subject is not new in this House Very disagreeably to this House very unfortunately to this Nation and to the peace and prosperity of this whole Empire no topic has been more familiar to us For nine long years session after session we have been lashed round and round this miserable circle of occasional arguments and temporary expedients I am sure our heads must turn and our stomachs nauseate with them We have had them in every shape we have looked at them in every point of view Invention is exhausted reason is fatigued experience has given judgement but obstinacy is not yet conquered  The Hon Gentleman has made one endeavour more to diversify the form of this disgusting argument He has thrown out a speech composed almost entirely of challenges Challenges are serious things and as he is a man of prudence as well as resolution I dare say he has very well weighed those challenges before he delivered them I had long the happiness to sit at the same side of the House and to agree with the Hon Gentleman on all the American questions My sentiments I am sure are well known to him and I thought I had been perfectly acquainted with his Though I find myself mistaken he will still permit me to use the privilege of an old friendship he will permit me to apply myself to the House under the sanction of his authority and on the various grounds he has measured out to submit to you the poor opinions which I have formed upon a matter of importance enough to demand the fullest consideration I could bestow upon it  He has stated to the House two grounds of deliberation one narrow and simple and merely confined to the question on your paper the other more large and more complicated comprehending the whole series of the parliamentary proceedings with regard to  America their causes and their consequences With regard to the latter ground he states it as useless and thinks it may be even dangerous to enter into so extensive a field of enquiry Yet to my surprize he had hardly laid down this restrictive proposition to which his authority would have given so much weight when directly and with the same authority he condemns it and declares it absolutely necessary to enter into the most ample historical detail His zeal has thrown him a little out of his usual accuracy In this perplexity what shall we do Sir who are willing to submit to the law he gives us He has reprobated in one part of his speech the rule he had laid down for debate in the other and after narrowing the ground for all those who are to speak after him he takes an excursion himself as unbounded as the subject and the extent of his great abilities  Sir When I cannot obey all his laws I will do the best I can I will endeavour to obey such of them as have the sanction of his example and to stick to that rule which though not consistent with the other is the most rational He was certainly in the right when he took the matter largely I cannot prevail on myself to agree with him in his censure of his own conduct It is not he will give me leave to say either useless or dangerous He asserts that retrospect is not wise and the proper the only proper subject of enquiry is  "not how we got into this difficulty but how we are to get out of it"  In other words we are according to him to consult our invention and to reject our experience The mode of deliberation he recommends is diametrically opposite to every rule of reason and every principle of good sense established amongst mankind For that sense and that reason I have always understood absolutely to prescribe whenever we are involved in difficulties from the measures we have pursued that we should take a strict review of those measures in order to correct our errors if they should be corrigible or at least to avoid a dull uniformity in mischief and the unpitied calamity of being repeatedly caught in the same snare  Sir I will freely follow the Hon Gentleman in his historical discussion without the least management for men or measures further than as they shall seem to me to deserve it But before I  go into that large consideration because I would omit nothing that can give the House satisfaction I wish to tread the narrow ground to which alone the Hon Gentleman in one part of his speech has so strictly confined us  He desires to know whether if we were to repeal this tax agreeably to the proposition of the Hon Gentleman who made the motion the Americans would not take post on this concession in order to make a new attack on the next body of taxes and whether they would not call for a repeal of the duty on wine as loudly as they do now for the repeal of the duty on tea Sir I can give no security on this subject But I will do all that I can and all that can be fairly demanded To the  experience  which the Hon Gentleman reprobates in one instant and reverts to in the next to that experience without the least wavering or hesitation on my part I steadily appeal and would to God there was no other arbiter to decide on the vote with which the House is to conclude this day  When Parliament repealed the Stamp Act in the year I affirm first that the Americans did  not  in consequence of this measure call upon you to give up the former parliamentary revenue which subsisted in that Country or even any one of the articles which compose it I affirm also that when departing from the maxims of that repeal you revived the scheme of taxation and thereby filled the minds of the Colonists with new jealousy and all sorts of apprehensions then it was that they quarreled with the old taxes as well as the new then it was and not till then that they questioned all the parts of your legislative power and by the battery of such questions have shaken the solid structure of this Empire to its deepest foundations  Of those two propositions I shall before I have done give such convincing such damning proof that however the contrary may be whispered in circles or bawled in newspapers they never more will dare to raise their voices in this House I speak with great confidence I have reason for it The Ministers are with me  They  at least are convinced that the repeal of the Stamp Act had  not and that no repeal can have the consequences which the Hon Gentleman who defends their measures is so much alarmed at To their conduct I refer him for a conclusive answer to his objection I carry my proof irresistibly into the very body of both Ministry and Parliament not on any general reasoning growing out of collateral matter but on the conduct of the Hon Gentleman's ministerial friends on the new revenue itself  The Act of which grants this ten duty sets forth in its preamble that it was expedient to raise a revenue in America for the support of the civil government there as well as for purposes still more extensive To this support the Act assigns six branches of duties About two years after this Act passed the Ministry I mean the present Ministry thought it expedient to repeal five of the duties and to leave for reasons best known to themselves only the sixth standing Suppose any person at the time of that repeal had thus addressed the Minister  Lord North then Chancellor of the Exchequer    "Condemning as you do the repeal of the Stamp Act Why do you venture to repeal the duties upon glass paper and painters colours Let your pretence for the repeal be what it will are you not thoroughly convinced that your concessions will produce not satisfaction but insolence in the Americans and that the giving up these taxes will necessitate the giving up of all the rest"  This objection was as palpable then as it is now and it was as good for preserving the five duties as for retaining the sixth Besides the Minister will recollect that the repeal of the Stamp Act had but just preceded his repeal and the ill policy of that measure had it been so impolitic as it has been represented and the mischiefs it produced were quite recent Upon the principles therefore of the Hon Gentleman upon the principles of the Minister himself the Minister has nothing at all to answer He stands condemned by himself and by all his associates old and new as a destroyer in the first trust of finance of the revenues and in the first rank of honour as a betrayer of the dignity of his Country  Most men especially great men do not always know their wellwishers I come to rescue that Noble Lord out of the hands  of those he calls his friends and even out of his own I will do him the justice he is denied at home He has not been this wicked or imprudent man He knew that a repeal had no tendency to produce the mischiefs which give so much alarm to his Honourable friend His work was not bad in its principle but imperfect in its execution and the motion on your paper presses him only to compleat a proper plan which by some unfortunate and unaccountable error he had left unfinished  I hope Sir the Hon Gentleman who spoke last is thoroughly satisfied and satisfied out of the proceedings of Ministry on their own favourite Act that his fears from a repeal are groundless If he is not I leave him and the Noble Lord who sits by him to settle the matter as well as they can together for if the repeal of American taxes destroys all our government in AmericaHe is the manand he is the worst of all the repealers because he is the last  But I hear it rung continually in my ears now and formerly  "the Preamble what will become of the Preamble if you repeal this Tax"  I am sorry to be compelled so often to expose the calamities and disgraces of Parliament The preamble of this law standing as it now stands has the lie direct given to it by the provisionary part of the Act if that can be called provisionary which makes no provision I should be afraid to express myself in this manner especially in the face of such a formidable array of ability as is now drawn up before me composed of the antient household troops of that side of the House and the new recruits from this if the matter were not clear and indisputable Nothing but truth could give me this firmness but plain truth and clear evidence can be beat down by no ability The Clerk will be so good as to turn to the Act and to read this favourite preamble  Whereas it is  expedient  that a revenue should be raised in your Majesty's Dominions in America for making a more  certain  and  adequate  provision for defraying the charge of the  administration of justice and support of civil government  in such Provinces where it shall be found necessary and towards  further defraying  the expences of  defending protecting and securing the said Dominions  You have heard this pompous performance Now where is the revenue which is to do all these mighty things Five sixths repealedabandonedsunkgonelost for ever Does the poor solitary tea duty support the purposes of this preamble Is not the supply there stated as effectually abandoned as if the tea duty had perished in the general wreck Here Mr Speaker is a precious mockerya preamble without an acttaxes granted in order to be repealedand the reasons of the grant still carefully kept up This is raising a revenue in America This is preserving dignity in England If you repeal this tax in compliance with the motion I readily admit that you lose this fair preamble Estimate your loss in it The object of the act is gone already and all you suffer is the purging the Statutebook of the opprobrium of an empty absurd and false recital  It has been said again and again that the five Taxes were repealed on commercial principles It is so said in the paper in my hand  Lord Hillsborough's Circular Letter to the Governors of the Colonies concerning the Repeal of some of the Duties laid in the Act of  a paper which I constantly carry about which I have often used and shall often use again What is got by this paltry pretence of commercial principles I know not for if your government in America is destroyed by the  repeal of Taxes  it is of no consequence upon what ideas the repeal is grounded Repeal this Tax too upon commercial principles if you please These principles will serve as well now as they did formerly But you know that either your Objection to a repeal from these supposed consequences has no validity or that this pretence never could remove it This commercial motive never was believed by any man either in America which this Letter is meant to soothe or in England which it is meant to deceive It was impossible it should Because every man in the least acquainted with the detail of Commerce must know that several of the articles on which the Tax was repealed were fitter objects of Duties than almost any other articles that could possibly be chosen without comparison more so than the Tea that was left taxed as infinitely less liable to be eluded by contraband The Tax upon Red and White Lead was of this nature You have in this kingdom an advantage in Lead that  amounts to a monopoly When you find yourself in this situation of advantage you sometimes venture to tax even your own export You did so soon after the last war when upon this principle you ventured to impose a duty on Coals In all the articles of American contraband trade who ever heard of the smuggling of Red Lead and White Lead You might therefore well enough without danger of contraband and without injury to Commerce if this were the whole consideration have taxed these commodities The same may be said of Glass Besides some of the things taxed were so trivial that the loss of the objects themselves and their utter annihilation out of American Commerce would have been comparatively as nothing But is the article of Tea such an object in the Trade of England as not to be felt or felt but slightly like White Lead and Red Lead and Painters Colours Tea is an object of far other importance Tea is perhaps the most important object taking it with its necessary connections of any in the mighty circle of our Commerce If commercial principles had been the true motives to the Repeal or had they been at all attended to Tea would have been the last article we should have left taxed for a subject of controversy  Sir it is not a pleasant consideration but nothing in the world can read so awful and so instructive a lesson as the conduct of Ministry in this business upon the mischief of not having large and liberal ideas in the management of great affairs Never have the servants of the state looked at the whole of your complicated interests in one connected view They have taken things by bits and scraps some at one time and one pretence and some at another just as they pressed without any sort of regard to their relations or dependencies They never had any kind of system right or wrong but only invented occasionally some miserable tale for the day in order meanly to sneak out of difficulties into which they had proudly strutted And they were put to all these shifts and devices full of meaness and full of mischief in order to pilfer piecemeal a repeal of an act which they had not the generous courage when they found and felt their error honourably and fairly to disclaim By such management by the irresistible operation of feeble councils so paltry a sum as threepence in the eyes of a financier so  insignificant an article as tea in the eyes of a philosopher have shaken the pillars of a Commercial Empire that circled the whole globe  Do you forget that in the very last year you stood on the precipice of general bankruptcy Your danger was indeed great You were distressed in the affairs of the East India Company and you well know what sort of things are involved in the comprehensive energy of that significant appellation I am not called upon to enlarge to you on that danger which you thought proper yourselves to aggravate and to display to the world with all the parade of indiscreet declamation The monopoly of the most lucrative trades and the possession of imperial revenues had brought you to the verge of beggary and ruin Such was your representationsuch in some measure was your case The vent of Ten Millions of pounds of this commodity now locked up by the operation of an injudicious Tax and rotting in the warehouses of the Company would have prevented all this distress and all that series of desperate measures which you thought yourselves obliged to take in consequence of it America would have furnished that vent which no other part of the world can furnish but America where Tea is next to a necessary of life and where the demand grows upon the supply I hope our dearbought East India Committees have done us at least so much good as to let us know that without a more extensive sale of that article our East India revenues and acquisitions can have no certain connection with this country It is through the American trade of Tea that your East India conquests are to be prevented from crushing you with their burthen They are ponderous indeed and they must have that great country to lean upon or they tumble upon your head It is the same folly that has lost you at once the benefit of the West and of the East This folly has thrown open foldingdoors to contraband and will be the means of giving the profits of the trade of your colonies to every nation but yourselves Never did a people suffer so much for the empty words of a preamble It must be given up For on what principle does it stand This famous revenue stands at this hour on all the debate as a description of revenue not as yet known in all the comprehensive but too comprehensive vocabulary of finance  a  preambulary tax  It is indeed a tax of sophistry a tax of pedantry a tax of disputation a tax of war and rebellion a tax for any thing but benefit to the imposers or satisfaction to the subject  Well but whatever it is gentlemen will force the Colonists to take the Teas You will force them has seven years struggle been yet able to force them O but it seems  "we are in the rightThe tax is triflingin effect it is rather an exoneration than an imposition threefourths of the duty formerly payable on teas exported to America is taken off the place of collection is only shifted instead of the retention of a shilling from the drawback here it is threepence custom paid in America"  All this Sir is very true But this is the very folly and mischief of the act Incredible as it may seem you know that you have deliberately thrown away a large duty which you held secure and quiet in your hands for the vain hope of getting one threefourths less through every hazard through certain litigation and possibly through war  The manner of proceeding in the duties on paper and glass imposed by the same act was exactly in the same spirit There are heavy excises on those articles when used in England On export these excises are drawn back But instead of withholding the drawback which might have been done with ease without charge without possibility of smuggling and instead of applying the money money already in your hands according to your pleasure you began your operations in finance by flinging away your revenue you allowed the whole drawback on export and then you charged the duty which you had before discharged payable in the Colonies where it was certain the collection would devour it to the bone if any revenue were ever suffered to be collected at all One spirit pervades and animates the whole mass  Could any thing be a subject of more just alarm to America than to see you go out of the plain high road of finance and give up your most certain revenues and your clearest interests merely for the sake of insulting your Colonies No man ever doubted that the commodity of tea could bear an imposition of threepence But  no commodity will bear threepence or will bear a penny when the general feelings of men are irritated and two millions of people are resolved not to pay The feelings of the Colonies were formerly the feelings of Great Britain Theirs were formerly the feelings of Mr Hampden when called upon for the payment of twenty shillings Would twenty shillings have ruined Mr Hampden's fortune No but the payment of half twenty shillings on the principle it was demanded would have made him a slave It is the weight of that preamble of which you are so fond and not the weight of the duty that the Americans are unable and unwilling to bear  It is then Sir upon the  principle  of this measure and nothing else that we are at issue It is a principle of political expediency Your act of asserts that it is expedient to raise a revenue in America your act of which takes away that revenue contradicts the act of and by something much stronger than words asserts that it is not expedient It is a reflexion upon your wisdom to persist in a solemn parliamentary declaration of the expediency of any object for which at the same time you make no sort of provision And pray Sir let not this circumstance escape you it is very material that the preamble of this act which we wish to repeal is not  declaratory of a right  as some gentlemen seem to argue it it is only a recital of the  expediency  of a certain exercise of a right supposed already to have been asserted an exercise you are now contending for by ways and means which you confess though they were obeyed to be utterly insufficient for their purpose You are therefore at this moment in the aukward situation of fighting for a phantom a quiddity a thing that wants not only a substance but even a name for a thing which is neither abstract right nor profitable enjoyment  They tell you Sir that your dignity is tied to it I know not how it happens but this dignity of yours is a terrible incumbrance to you for it has of late been ever at war with your interest your equity and every idea of your policy Shew the thing you contend for to be reason shew it to be common sense shew it to be the means of attaining some useful end and then I am content to allow it what dignity you please But what dignity is derived from  the perseverance in absurdity is more than ever I could discern The Hon Gentleman has said wellindeed in most of his  general  observations I agree with himhe says that this subject does not stand as it did formerly Oh certainly not every hour you continue on this illchosen ground your difficulties thicken on you and therefore my conclusion is remove from a bad position as quickly as you can The disgrace and the necessity of yielding both of them grow upon you every hour of your delay  But will you repeal the act says the Hon Gentleman at this instant when America is in open resistance to your authority and that you have just revived your system of taxation He thinks he has driven us into a corner But thus pent up I am content to meet him because I enter the lists supported by my old authority his new friends the ministers themselves The Hon Gentleman remembers that about five years ago as great disturbances as the present prevailed in America on account of the new taxes The ministers represented these disturbances as treasonable and this House thought proper on that representation to make a famous address for a revival and for a new application of a statute of H VIII We besought the King in that wellconsidered address to enquire into treasons and to bring the supposed traytors from America to Great Britain for trial His Majesty was pleased graciously to promise a compliance with our request All the attempts from this side of the House to resist these violences and to bring about a repeal were treated with the utmost scorn An apprehension of the very consequences now stated by the Hon Gentleman was then given as a reason for shutting the door against all hope of such an alteration And so strong was the spirit for supporting the new taxes that the session concluded with the following remarkable declaration After stating the vigorous measures which had been pursued the Speech from the throne proceeds  You have assured me of your  firm  support in the  prosecution  of them Nothing in my opinion could be more likely to enable the welldisposed among my subjects in that part of the world effectually to discourage and defeat the designs of the factious and seditious than the hearty concurrence of every branch of the Legislature in  maintaining the execution of the laws in every  part of my dominions    After this no man dreamt that a repeal under this ministry could possibly take place The Hon Gentleman knows as well as I that the idea was utterly exploded by those who sway the House This Speech was made on the ninth day of May Five days after this Speech that is on the th of the same month the public Circular Letter a part of which I am going to read to you was written by Lord Hillsborough Secretary of State for the Colonies After reciting the substance of the King's Speech he goes on thus  "  I can take upon me to assure you notwithstanding insinuations to the contrary from men with  factious and seditious views  that his Majesty's  present administration have at no time entertained a design to propose to parliament to lay any further taxes upon America for the purpose of RAISING A REVENUE  and that it is at present their intention to propose the next Session of Parliament to take off the duties upon glass paper and colours upon consideration of such duties  having been laid contrary to the true principles of Commerce"  "  These have  always  been and  still are  the sentiments of his  Majesty's present servants  and by which their conduct in  respect to America has been governed  And  his Majesty  relies upon your prudence and fidelity for such an explanation of  his  measures as may tend to remove the prejudices which have been excited by the misrepresentations of those who are enemies to the peace and prosperity of Great Britain and her Colonies and to reestablish that mutual  confidence and affection  upon which the glory and safety of the British empire depend  "  Here Sir is a canonical book of ministerial scripture the general epistle to the Americans What does the gentleman say to it Here a repeal is promised promised without condition and while your authority was actually resisted I pass by the public promise of a Peer relative to the repeal of taxes by this House I pass by the use of the King's name in a matter of supply that sacred and reserved right of the Commons I conceal the ridiculous figure of Parliament hurling its thunders at the gigantic rebellion of America and then five days after prostrate at the feet of those assemblies we  affected to despise begging them by the Intervention of our ministerial sureties to receive our submission and heartily promising amendment These might have been serious matters formerly but we are grown wiser than our fathers Passing therefore from the constitutional consideration to the mere policy does not this Letter imply that the idea of taxing America for the purpose of revenue is an abominable project when the Ministry suppose none but  factious  men and with seditious views could charge them with it does not this Letter adopt and sanctify the American distinction of  taxing for a revenue  does it not formally reject all future taxation on that principle does it not state the ministerial rejection of such principle of taxation not as the occasional but the constant opinion of the King's servants does it not say I care not how consistently but does it not say that their conduct with regard to America has been  always  governed by this policy It goes a great deal further These excellent and trusty servants of the King justly fearful lest they themselves should have lost all credit with the world bring out the image of their gracious Sovereign from the inmost and most sacred shrine and they pawn him as a security for their promises  "  His Majesty  relies on your prudence and fidelity for such an explanation of  his  measures"  These sentiments of the Minister and these measures of his Majesty can only relate to the principle and practice of taxing for a revenue and accordingly Lord Botetourt stating it as such did with great propriety and in the exact spirit of his instructions endeavour to remove the fears of the Virginian assembly lest the sentiments which it seems unknown to the world had  always  been those of the Ministers and by which  their  conduct in  respect to America had been governed  should by some possible revolution favourable to wicked American taxers be hereafter counteracted He addresses them in this manner  It may possibly be objected that as his Majesty's present administration are  not immortal  their successors may be inclined to attempt to undo what the present Ministers shall have attempted to perform and to that objection I can give but this answer that it is my firm opinion that the plan I have stated to you will certainly take place and that it will never be departed from and so determined am I for ever to abide by it that I will be content to be declared infamous if I do not to the last hour of  my life at all times in all places and upon all occasions exert every power with which I either am or ever shall be legally invested in order to obtain and  maintain  for the Continent of America that  satisfaction  which I have been authorised to promise this day by the  confidential  servants of our gracious Sovereign who to my certain knowledge rates his honour so high  that he would rather part with his crown than preserve it by deceit  A material point is omitted by Mr Burke in this speech viz  the manner in which the Continent received this royal assurance  The Assembly of Virginia in their Address in answer to Lord Botetourt's Speech express themselves thus  "We will not suffer our present hopes arising from the pleasing prospect your Lordship hath so kindly opened and displayed to us to be dashed by the bitter reflection that any  future  administration will entertain a wish to depart from that  plan  which affords the surest and most permanent foundation of public tranquillity and happiness No my Lord we are sure  our most gracious Sovereign  under whatever changes may happen in his confidential servants will remain immutable in the ways of truth and justice and that he is  incapable of deceiving his faithful subjects  and we esteem your Lordship's information not only as warranted but even sanctified  by the royal word  "    A glorious and true character which since we suffer his Ministers with impunity to answer for his ideas of taxation we ought to make it our business to enable his Majesty to preserve in all its lustre Let him have character since ours is no more Let some part of government be kept in respect  This Epistle was not the Letter of Lord Hillsborough solely though he held the official pen It was the letter of the noble Lord upon the floor  Lord North  and of all the King's then Ministers who with I think the exception of two only are his Ministers at this hour The very first news that a British Parliament heard of what it was to do with the duties which it had given and granted to the King was by the publication of the votes of American assemblies It was in America that your resolutions were predeclared It was from thence that we knew to a certainty how much exactly and not a scruple more nor less we were to repeal We were unworthy to be let into the secret of our own conduct The assemblies had  confidential  communications from his Majesty's  confidential  servants We were nothing but instruments Do you after this wonder that you have no weight and no respect in the Colonies After this are you surprized that Parliament is every day and every where losing I feel it with sorrow I utter it with reluctance that reverential affection which so endearing a name of authority ought ever to  carry with it that you are obeyed solely from respect to the bayonet and that this House the ground and pillar of freedom is itself held up only by the underpinning and clumsy buttresses of arbitrary power  If this dignity which is to stand in the place of just policy and common sense had been consulted there was a time for preserving it and for reconciling it with any concession If in the session of that session of idle terror and empty menaces you had as you were often pressed to do repealed these taxes then your strong operations would have come justified and enforced in case your concessions had been returned by outrages But preposterously you began with violence and before terrors could have any effect either good or bad your ministers immediately begged pardon and promised that repeal to the obstinate Americans which they had refused in an easy goodnatured complying British Parliament The assemblies which had been publicly and avowedly dissolved for  their  contumacy are called together to receive  your  submission Your ministerial directors blustered like tragic tyrants here and then went mumping with a sore leg in America canting and whining and complaining of faction which represented them as friends to revenue in the Colonies I hope nobody in this House will hereafter have the impudence to defend American taxes in the name of Ministry The moment they do with this letter of attorney in my hand I will tell them in the authorised terms they are wretches  "with factious and seditious views enemies to the peace and prosperity of the Mother Country and the Colonies" and subverters "of the mutual affection and confidence on which the glory and safety of the British Empire depend"  After this letter the question is no more on propriety or dignity They are gone already The faith of your Sovereign is pledged for the political principle The general declaration in the Letter goes to the whole of it You must therefore either abandon the scheme of taxing or you must send the Ministers tarred and feathered to America who dared to hold out the Royal Faith for a renunciation of all taxes for revenue Them you must punish or this faith you must preserve The preservation of this faith is of more consequence than the duties on  red lead  or  white lead  or on broken  glass  or  atlas ordinary  or  demifine  or  blueroyal  or  bastard    or  fool'scap  which you have given up or the threepence on tea which you retained The Letter went stampt with the public authority of this kingdom The instructions for the Colony government go under no other sanction and America cannot believe and will not obey you if you do not preserve this channel of communication sacred You are now punishing the Colonies for acting on distinctions held out by that very Ministry which is here shining in riches in favour and in power and urging the punishment of the very offence to which they had themselves been the tempters  Sir if reasons respecting simply your own commerce which is your own convenience were the sole grounds of the repeal of the five duties why does Lord Hillsborough in disclaiming in the name of the King and Ministry their ever having had an intent to tax for revenue mention it as the means  "of reestablishing the confidence and affection of the Colonies"  Is it a way of soothing  others  to assure them that you will take good care of  yourself  The medium the only medium for regaining their affection and confidence is that you will take off something oppressive to their minds Sir the Letter strongly enforces that idea for though the repeal of the taxes is promised on commercial principles yet the means of counteracting  "the insinuations of men with factious and seditious views"  is by a disclaimer of the intention of taxing for revenue as a constant invariable sentiment and rule of conduct in the government of America  I remember that the noble Lord on the floor not in a former debate to be sure it would be disorderly to refer to it I suppose I read it some where but the noble Lord was pleased to say that he did not conceive how it could enter into the head of man to impose such taxes as those of I mean those taxes which he voted for imposing and voted for repealing as being taxes contrary to all the principles of commerce laid on  British Manufactures    I dare say the noble Lord is perfectly well read because the duty of his particular office requires he should be so in all our revenue laws and in the policy which is to be collected out of them Now Sir when he had read this act of American revenue and a little recovered from his astonishment I suppose  he made one step retrograde it is but one and looked at the act which stands just before in the Statute Book The American revenue act is the fortyfifth chapter the other to which I refer is the fortyfourth of the same session These two acts are both to the same purpose both revenue acts both taxing out of the kingdom and both taxing British manufactures exported As the th is an act for raising a revenue in America the th is an act for raising a revenue in the Isle of Man The two acts perfectly agree in all respects except one In the act for taxing the Isle of Man the noble Lord will find not as in the American act four or five articles but almost the  whole body  of British manufactures taxed from two and an half to fifteen  per cent  and some articles such as that of spirits a great deal higher You did not think it uncommercial to tax the whole mass of your manufactures and let me add your agriculture too for I now recollect British corn is there also taxed up to ten  per cent  and this too in the very headquarters the very citadel of smuggling the Isle of Man Now will the noble Lord condescend to tell me why he repealed the taxes on your manufactures sent out to America and not the taxes on the manufactures exported to the Isle of Man The principle was exactly the same the objects charged infinitely more extensive the duties without comparison higher Why why notwithstanding all his childish pretexts because the taxes were quietly submitted to in the Isle of Man and because they raised a flame in America Your reasons were political not commercial The repeal was made as Lord Hillsborough's Letter well expresses it to regain  "the confidence and affection of the Colonies on which the glory and safety of the British Empire depend"  A wise and just motive surely if ever there was such But the mischief and dishonour is that you have not done what you had given the Colonies just cause to expect when your ministers disclaimed the idea of taxes for a revenue There is nothing simple nothing manly nothing ingenuous open decisive or steady in the proceding with regard either to the continuance or the repeal of the taxes The whole has an air of littleness and fraud The article of tea is slurred over in the Circular Letter as it were by accidentnothing is said of a resolution either to keep that tax or to give it up There is no fair dealing in any part of the transaction  If you mean to follow your true motive and your public faith give up your tax on tea for raising a revenue the principle of which has in effect been disclaimed in your name and which produces you no advantage no not a penny Or if you choose to go on with a poor pretence instead of a solid reason and will still adhere to your cant of commerce you have ten thousand times more strong commercial reasons for giving up this duty on tea than for abandoning the five others that you have already renounced  The American consumption of teas is annually I believe worth l at the least farthing If you urge the American violence as a justification of your perseverance in enforcing this tax you know that you can never answer this plain questionWhy did you repeal the others given in the same act whilst the very same violence subsistedBut you did not find the violence cease upon that occasionNo because the concession was far short of satisfying the principle which Lord Hillsborough had abjured or even the pretence on which the repeal of the other taxes was announced and because by enabling the East India Company to open a shop for defeating the American resolution not to pay that specific tax you manifestly shewed a hankering after the principle of the act which you formerly had renounced Whatever road you take leads to compliance with this motion It opens to you at the end of every visto Your commerce you policy your promises your reasons your pretences your consistency your inconsistencyall jointly oblige you to this repeal  But still it sticks in our throats if we go so far the Americans will go fartherWe do not know that We ought from experience rather to presume the contrary Do we not know for certain that the Americans are going on as fast as possible whilst we refuse to gratify them Can they do more or can they do worse if we yield this point I think this concession will rather fix a turnpike to prevent their further progress It is impossible to answer for bodies of men But I am sure the natural effect of fidelity clemency kindness in governors is peace goodwill order and  esteem on the part of the governed I would certainly at least give these fair principles a fair trial which since the making of act to this hour they never have had  Sir the Hon Gentleman having spoken what he thought necessary upon the narrow part of the subject I have given him I hope a satisfactory answer He next presses me by a variety of direct challenges and oblique reflexions to say something on the historical part I shall therefore Sir open myself fully on that important and delicate subject not for the sake of telling you a long story which I know Mr Speaker you are not particularly fond of but for the sake of the weighty instruction that I flatter myself will necessarily result from it It shall not be longer if I can help it than so serious a matter requires  Permit me then Sir to lead your attention very far back back to the act of navigation the cornerstone of the policy of this country with regard to its colonies Sir that policy was from the beginning purely commercial and the commercial system was wholly restrictive It was the system of a monopoly No trade was let loose from that constraint but merely to enable the Colonists to dispose of what in the course of your trade you could not take or to enable them to dispose of such articles as we forced upon them and for which without some degree of liberty they could not pay Hence all your specific and detailed enumerations hence the innumerable checks and counterchecks hence that infinite variety of paper chains by which you bind together this complicated system of the Colonies This principle of commercial monopoly runs through no less than twentynine Acts of Parliament from the year to the unfortunate period of  In all those acts the system of commerce is established as that from whence alone you proposed to make the Colonies contribute I mean directly and by the operation of your superintending legislative power to the strength of the empire I venture to say that during that whole period a parliamentary revenue from thence was never once in contemplation Accordingly in all the number of laws passed with regard to the Plantations the  words which distinguish revenue laws specifically as such were I think premeditately avoided I do not say Sir that a form of words alters the nature of the law or abridges the power of the lawgiver It certainly does not However title and formal preambles are not always idle words and the lawyers frequently argue from them I state these facts to shew not what was your right but what has been your settled policy Our revenue laws have usually a  title  purporting their being  grants  and the words  give and grant  usually precede the enacting parts Although duties were imposed on America in Acts of King Charles the Second and in Acts of King William no one title of giving  "an aid to His Majesty"  or any other of the usual titles to revenue acts was to be found in any of them till nor were the words  "give and grant"  in any preamble until the th of George the Second However the title of this Act of George the Second notwithstanding the words of donation considers it merely as a regulation of trade  "An Act for the better securing of the trade of His Majesty's Sugar Colonies in America"  This Act was made on a compromise of all and at the express desire of a part of the Colonies themselves It was therefore in some measure with their consent and having a title directly purporting no more than a  commercial regulation  and being in truth nothing more the words were passed by at a time when no jealousy was entertained and things were little scrutinized Even Governor Barnard in his second printed letter dated in gives it as his opinion that  "it was an act of  prohibition  not of revenue"  This is certainly true that no act avowedly for the purpose of revenue and with the ordinary title and recital taken together is found in the statute book until the year I have mentioned that is the year All before this period stood on commercial regulation and restraint The scheme of a Colony revenue by British authority appeared therefore to the Americans in the light of a great innovation the words of Governor Barnard's ninth letter written in Nov state this idea very strongly  "it must" says he "have been supposed  such an innovation as a parliamentary taxation  would cause a great  alarm  and meet with much  opposition  in most parts of America it was  quite new  to the people and had no  visible bounds  set to it"  After stating the weakness of government  there he says  "was this a time to introduce  so great a novelty  as a parliamentary inland taxation in America"  Whatever the right might have been this mode of using it was absolutely new in policy and practice  Sir they who are friends to the schemes of American revenue say that the commercial restraint is full as hard a law for America to live under I think so too I think it if uncompensated to be a condition of as rigorous servitude as men can be subject to But America bore it from the fundamental act of navigation until Why Because men do bear the inevitable constitution of their original nature with all its infirmities The act of navigation attended the Colonies from their infancy grew with their growth and strengthened with their strength They were confirmed in obedience to it even more by usage than by law They scarcely had remembered a time when they were not subject to such restraint Besides they were indemnified for it by a pecuniary compensation Their monopolist happened to be one of the richest men in the world By his immense capital primarily employed not for their benefit but his own they were enabled to proceed with their fisheries their agriculture their shipbuilding and their trade too within the limits in such a manner as got far the start of the slow languid operations of unassisted nature This capital was a hotbed to them Nothing in the history of mankind is like their progress For my part I never cast an eye on their flourishing commerce and their cultivated and commodious life but they seem to me rather antient nations grown to perfection through a long series of fortunate events and a train of successful industry accumulating wealth in many centuries than the Colonies of yesterday than a set of miserable outcasts a few years ago not so much sent as thrown out on the bleak and barren shore of a desolate wilderness three thousand miles from all civilized intercourse  All this was done by England whilst England pursued trade and forgot revenue You not only acquired commerce but you actually created the very objects of trade in America and by that creation you raised the trade of this kingdom at least fourfold America  had the compensation of your capital which made her bear her servitude She had another compensation which you are now going to take away from her She had except the commercial restraint every characteristic mark of a free people in all her internal concerns She had the image of the British constitution She had the substance She was taxed by her own representatives She chose most of her own magistrates She paid them all She had in effect the sole disposal of her own internal government This whole state of commercial servitude and civil liberty taken together is certainly not perfect freedom but comparing it with the ordinary circumstances of human nature it was an happy and a liberal condition  I know Sir that great and not unsuccessful pains have been taken to inflame our minds by an outcry in this House and out of it that in America the act of navigation neither is or ever was obeyed But if you take the Colonies through I affirm that its authority never was disputed that it was no where disputed for any length of time and on the whole that it was well observed Wherever the Act pressed hard many individuals indeed evaded it This is nothing These scattered individuals never denied the law and never obeyed it Just as it happens whenever the laws of trade whenever the laws of revenue press hard upon the people in England in that case all your shores are full of contraband Your right to give a monopoly to the East India Company your right to lay immense duties on French brandy are not disputed in England You do not make this charge on any man But you know that there is not a creek from Pentland Frith to the Isle of Wight in which they do not smuggle immense quantities of teas East India goods and brandies I take it for granted that the authority of Gov Bernard in this point is indisputable Speaking of these laws as they regarded that part of America now in so unhappy a condition he says  "I believe they are no where better supported than in this Province I do not pretend that it is entirely free from a breach of these laws but that such a breach if discovered is justly punished"  What more can you say of the obedience to any laws in any Country An obedience to these laws formed the acknowledgement instituted by yourselves for your superiority and was the payment you originally imposed for your protection  Whether you were right or wrong in establishing the Colonies on the principles of commercial monopoly rather than on that of revenue is at this day a problem of mere speculation You cannot have both by the same authority To join together the restraints of an universal internal and external monopoly with an universal internal and external taxation is an unnatural union perfect un+compensated slavery You have long since decided for yourself and them and you and they have prospered exceedingly under that decision  This nation Sir never thought of departing from that choice until the period immediately on the close of the last war Then a scheme of government new in many things seemed to have been adopted I saw or thought I saw several symptoms of a great change whilst I sat in your gallery a good while before I had the honour of a seat in this House At that period the necessity was established of keeping up no less than twenty new regiments with twenty colonels capable of seats in this House This scheme was adopted with very general applause from all sides at the very time that by your conquests in America your danger from foreign attempts in that part of the world was much lessened or indeed rather quite over When this huge encrease of military establishment was resolved on a revenue was to be found to support so great a burthen Country gentlemen the great patrons of occonomy and the great resisters of a standing armed force would not have entered with much alacrity into the vote for so large and so expensive an army if they had been very sure that they were to continue to pay for it But hopes of another kind were held out to them and in particular I well remember that Mr Townshend in a brilliant harangue on this subject did dazzle them by playing before their eyes the image of a revenue to be raised in America  Here began to dawn the first glimmerings of this new Colony system It appeared more distinctly afterwards when it was devolved upon a person to whom on other accounts this Country owes very great obligations I do believe that he had a very serious desire to benefit the public But with no small study of the detail  he did not seem to have his view at least equally carried to the total circuit of its affairs He generally considered his objects in lights that were rather too detached Whether the business of an American revenue was imposed upon him altogether whether it was entirely the result of his own speculation or what is more probable that his own ideas rather coincided with the instructions he had received certain it is that with the best intentions in the world he first brought this fatal scheme into form and established it by act of parliament  No man can believe that at this time of day I mean to lean on the venerable memory of a great man whose loss we deplore in common Our little partydifferences have been long ago composed and I have acted more with him and certainly with more pleasure with him than ever I acted against him Undoubtedly Mr Grenville was a firstrate figure in this country With a masculine understanding and a stout and resolute heart he had an application undissipated and unwearied He took public business not as a duty which he was to fulfil but as a pleasure he was to enjoy and he seemed to have no delight out of this House except in such things as some way related to the business that was to be done within it If he was ambitious I will say this for him his ambition was of a noble and generous strain It was to raise himself not by the low pimping politics of a court but to win his way to power through the laborious gradations of public service and to secure to himself a wellearned rank in Parliament by a thorough knowledge of its constitution and a perfect practice in all its business  Sir if such a man fell into errors it must be from defects not intrinsical they must be rather sought in the particular habits of his life which though they do not alter the groundwork of character yet tinge it with their own hue He was bred in a profession He was bred to the law which is in my opinion one of the first and noblest of human sciences a science which does more to quicken and invigorate the understanding than all the other kinds of learning put together but it is not apt except in persons very happily born to open and to liberalize the mind  exactly in the same proportion Passing from that study he did not go very largely into the world but plunged into business I mean into the business of office and the limited and fixed methods and forms established there Much knowledge is to be had undoubtedly in that line and there is no knowledge which is not valuable But it may be truly said that men too much conversant in office are rarely minds of remarkable enlargement Their habits of office are apt to give them a turn to think the substance of business not to be much more important than the forms in which it is conducted These forms are adapted to ordinary occasions and therefore persons who are nurtured in office do admirably well as long as things go on in their common order but when the high roads are broken up and the waters out when a new and troubled scene is opened and the file affords no precedent then it is that a greater knowledge of mankind and a far more extensive comprehension of things is requisite than ever office gave or than office can ever give Mr Grenville thought better of the wisdom and power of human legislation than in truth it deserves He conceived and many conceived along with him that the flourishing trade of this country was greatly owing to law and institution and not quite so much to liberty for but too many are apt to believe regulation to be commerce and taxes to be revenue Among regulations that which stood first in reputation was his idol I mean the act of navigation He has often professed it to be so The policy of that act is I readily admit in many respects well understood But I do say that if the act be suffered to run the full length of its principle and is not changed and modified according to the change of times and the fluctuation of circumstances it must do great mischief and frequently even defeat its own purpose  After the war and in the last years of it the trade of Americ  had encreased far beyond the speculations of the most sanguine imagination It swelled out on every side It filled all its proper channels to the brim It overflowed with a rich redundance and breaking its banks on the right and on the left it spread out upon some places where it was indeed improper upon others where it was only irregular It is the nature of all greatness not to be exact and great trade will always be attended with considerable abuses  The contraband will always keep pace in some measure with the fair trade It should stand as a fundamental maxim that no vulgar precaution ought to be employed in the cure of evils which are closely connected with the cause of our prosperity Perhaps this great person turned his eye somewhat less than was just towards the incredible increase of the fair trade and looked with something of too exquisite a jealousy towards the contraband He certainly felt a singular degree of anxiety on the subject and even began to act from that passion earlier than is commonly imagined For whilst he was first lord of the admiralty though not strictly called upon in his official line he presented a very strong memorial to the lords of the treasury my lord Bute was then at the head of the board heavily complaining of the growth of the illicit commerce in America Some mischief happened even at that time from this overearnest zeal Much greater happened afterwards when it operated with greater power in the highest department of the finances The bonds of the act of navigation were straitned so much that America was on the point of having no trade either contraband or legitimate They found under the construction and execution then used the act no longer tying but actually strangling them All this coming with new enumerations of commodities with regulations which in a manner put a stop to the mutual coasting intercourse of the Colonies with the appointment of courts of admiralty under various improper circumstances with a sudden extinction of the paper currencies with a compulsory provision for the quartering of soldiers the people of America thought themselves proceeded against as delinquents or at best as people under suspicion of delinquency and in such a manner as they imagined their recent services in the war did not at all merit Any of these innumerable regulations perhaps would not have alarmed alone some might be thought reasonable the multitude struck them with terror  But the grand manoeuvre in that business of new regulating the colonies was the th act of the fourth of George III which besides containing several of the matters to which I have just alluded opened a new principle and here properly began the second period of the policy of this country with regard to the Colonies  by which the scheme of a regular plantation parliamentary revenue was adopted in theory and settled in practice A revenue not substituted in the place of but superadded to a monopoly which monopoly was enforced at the same time with additional strictness and the execution put into military hands  This act Sir had for the first time the title of  "granting duties in the Colonies and Plantations of America"  and for the first time it was asserted in the preamble that it was  just  and  necessary  that a revenue should be raised there" Then came the technical words of  "giving and granting"  and thus a complete American revenue act was made in all the forms and with a full avowal of the right equity policy and even necessity of taxing the Colonies without any formal consent of theirs There are contained also in the preamble to that act these very remakable wordsthe Commons c  "being desirous to make  some  provision in the  present  Session of Parliament  towards  raising the said revenue"  By these words it appeared to the Colonies that this act was but a beginning of sorrows that every session was to produce something of the same kind that we were to go on from day to day in charging them with such taxes as we pleased for such a military force as we should think proper Had this plan been pursued it was evident that the provincial assemblies in which the Americans felt all their portion of importance and beheld their sole image of freedom were  ipso facto  annihilated This ill prospect before them seemed to be boundless in extent and endless in duration Sir they were not mistaken The Ministry valued themselves when this act passed and when they gave notice of the Stamp Act that both of the duties came very short of their ideas of American taxation Great was the applause of this measure here In England we cried out for new taxes on America whilst they cried out that they were nearly crushed with those which the war and their own grants had brought upon them  Sir it has been said in the debate that when the first American revenue act the act in imposing the port duties passed the Americans did not object to the principle It is true they touched it but very tenderly It was not a direct attack They  were it is true as yet novices as yet unaccumstomed to direct attacks upon any of the rights of Parliament The duties were port duties like those they had been accustomed to bear with this difference that the title was not the same the preamble not the same and the spirit altogether unlike But of what service is this observation to the cause of those that make it It is a full refutation of the pretence for their present cruelty to America for it shews out of their own mouths that our Colonies were backward to enter into the present vexatious and ruinous controversy  There is also another circulation abroad spread with a malignant intention which I cannot attribute to those who say the same thing in this house that Mr Grenville gave the Colony agents an option for their assemblies to tax themselves which they had refused I find that much stress is laid on this as a fact However it happens neither to be true nor possible I will observe first that Mr Grenville never thought sit to make this apology for himself in the innumerable debates that were had upon the subject He might have proposed to the Colony agents that they should agree in some  mode  of taxation as the ground of an Act of Parliament But he never could have proposed that they should tax themselves on requisition which is the assertion of the day Indeed Mr Grenville well knew that the Colony agents could have no general powers to consent to it and they had no time to consult their assemblies for particular powers before he passed his first revenue act If you compare dates you will find it impossible Burthened as the agents knew the Colonies were at that time they could not give the least hope of such grants His own favourite governour was of opinion that the Americans were not then taxable objects  "  Nor was the time less favourable to the  equity  of such a taxation I don't mean to dispute the reasonableness of America contributing to the charges of Great Britain  when she is able  nor I believe would the Americans themselves have disputed it at a  proper time and season  But it should be considered that the American governments themselves have in the prosecution of the late war contracted very large debts which it will take some years to pay off and in the mean time occasion  very  burdensome taxes for that purpose  only For instance this government which is as much beforehand as any raises every year    l sterling for sinking their debt and must continue it for four years longer at least before it will be clear  "  These are the words of Governor Bernard's Letter to a member of the old ministry and which he has since printed Mr Grenville could not have made this proposition to the agents for another reason He was of opinion which he has declared in this House an hundred times that the Colonies could not legally grant any revenue to the Crown and that infinite mischiefs would be the consequence of such a power When Mr Grenville had passed the first revenue act and in the same session had made this House come to a resolution for laying a stampduty on America between that time and the passing the stampact into a law he told a considerable and most respectable merchant a member of this House whom I am truly sorry I do not now see in his place when he represented against this proceeding that if the stampduty was disliked he was willing to exchange it for any other equally productive but that if he objected to the Americans being taxed by Parliament he might save them the trouble of the discussion as he was determined on the measure This is the fact and if you please I will mention a very unquestionable authority for it  Thus Sir I have disposed of this falsehood But falsehood has a perennial spring It is said that no conjecture could be made of the dislike of the Colonies to the principle This is as untrue as the other After the resolution of the House and before the passing of the stampact the Colonies of Massachuset's Bay and New York did send remonstrances objecting to this mode of parliamentary taxation What was the consequence They were suppressed they were put under the table notwithstanding an order of council to the contrary by the ministry which composed the very council that had made the order and thus the House proceeded to its business of taxing without the least regular knowledge of the objections which were made to it But to give that House its due it was not over desirous to receive information  or to hear remonstrance On the th of February whilst the stampact was under deliberation they refused with scorn even so much as to receive four petitions presented from so respectable Colonies as Connecticut Rhode Island Virginia and Carolina besides one from the traders of Jamaica As to the Colonies they had no alternative left to them but to disobey or to pay the taxes imposed by that Parliament which was not suffered or did not suffer itself even to hear them remonstrate upon the subject  This was the state of the Colonies before his Majesty thought fit to change his ministers It stands upon no authority of mine It is proved by uncontrovertible records The Hon Gentleman has desired some of us to lay our hands upon our hearts and answer to his queries upon the historical part of this consideration and by his manner as well as my eyes could discern it he seemed to address himself to me  Sir I will answer him as clearly as I am able and with great openness I have nothing to conceal In the year sixtyfive being in a very private station far enough from any line of business and not having the honour of a seat in this House it was my fortune unknowing and unknown to the then ministry by the intervention of a common friend to become connected with a very noble person and at the head of the Treasury department It was indeed in a situation of little rank and no consequence suitable to the mediocrity of my talents and pretensions But a situation near enough to enable me to see as well as others what was going on and I did see in that noble person such sound principles such an enlargement of mind such a clear and sagacious sense and such unshaken fortitude as have bound me as well as others much better than me by an inviolable attachment to him from that time forward Sir Lord Rockingham very early in that summer received a strong representation from many weighty English merchants and manufacturers from governors of provinces and commanders of men of war against almost the whole of the American commercial regulations and particularly with regard to the total ruin which was threatened to the Spanish trade I believe Sir the noble Lord soon saw his way in this  business But he did not rashly determine against acts which it might be supposed were the result of much deliberation However Sir he scarcely begun to open the ground when the whole veteran body of office took the alarm A violent outcry of all except those who knew and felt the mischief was raised against any alteration On one hand his attempt was a direct violation of treaties and public lawOn the other the Act of Navigation and all the corps of trade laws were drawn up in array against it  The first step the noble Lord took was to have the opinion of his excellent learned and ever lamented friend the late Mr Yorke then attorney general on the point of law When he knew that formally and officially which in substance he had known before he immediately dispatched orders to redress the grievance But I will say it for the then minister he is of that constitution of mind that I know he would have issued on the same critical occasion the very same orders if the Acts of Trade had been as they were not directly against him and would have chearfully submitted to the equity of Parliament for his indemnity  On the conclusion of this business of the Spanish trade the news of the troubles on account of the stampact arrived in England It was not until the end of October that these accounts were received No sooner had the sound of that mighty tempest reached us in England than the whole of the then opposition instead of feeling humbled by the unhappy issue of their measures seemed to be infinitely elated and cried out that the ministry from envy to the glory of their predecessors were prepared to repeal the stampact Near nine years after the Hon Gentleman takes quite opposite ground and now challenges me to put my hand to my heart and say whether the ministry had resolved on the repeal till a considerable time after the meeting of Parliament Though I do not very well know what the Hon Gentleman wishes to infer from the admission or from the denial of this fact on which he so earnestly adjures me I do put my hand on my heart and assure him that they did  not  come to a resolution directly to repeal They weighed this matter as its difficulty and importance required They considered  maturely among themselves They consulted with all who could give advice or information It was not determined until a little before the meeting of Parliament but it was determined and the main lines of their own plan marked out before that meeting Two questions arose I hope I am not to go into a narrative troublesome to the House  A cry of Go on go on  The first of the two considerations was whether the repeal should be total or whether only partial taking out every thing burthensome and productive and reserving only an empty acknowledgement such as a stamp on cards or dice The other question was On what principle the act should be repealed On this head also two principles were started One that the legislative rights of this country with regard to America were not entire but had certain restrictions and limitations The other principle was that taxes of this kind were contrary to the fundamental principles of commerce on which the Colonies were founded and contrary to every idea of political equity by which equity we are bound as much as possible to extend the spirit and benefit of the British constitution to every part of the British dominions The option both of the measure and of the principles of repeal was made before the session and I wonder how any one can read the King's Speech at the opening of that session without seeing in that Speech both the repeal and the declaratory act very sufficiently crayoned out Those who cannot see this can see nothing  Surely the Hon Gentleman will not think that a great deal less time than was then employed ought to have been spent in delibeberation when he considers that the news of the troubles did not arrive till towards the end of October The Parliament sat to fill the vacancies on the th day of December and on business the th of the following January  Sir a partial repeal or as the  bon ton  of the court then was a  modification  would have satisfied a timid unsystematic procrastinating ministry as such a measure has since done such a ministry  A modification is the constant resource of weak undeciding minds To repeal by a denial of our right to tax in the preamble and this too did not want advisers would have cut in the heroic style the Gordian knot with a sword Either measure would have cost no more than a day's debate But when the total repeal was adopted and adopted on principles of policy of equity and of commerce this plan made it necessary to enter into many and difficult measures It became necessary to open a very large field of evidence commensurate to these extensive views But then this labour did knights service It opened the eyes of several to the true state of the American affairs it enlarged their ideas it removed prejudices and it conciliated the opinions and affections of men The noble Lord who then took the lead in administration my Hon Friend  Mr Dowdeswell  under me and a Right Hon Gentleman  General Conway  if he will not reject his share and it was a large one of this business exerted the most laudable industry in bringing before you the fullest most impartial and leastgarbled body of evidence that ever was produced to this House I think the enquiry lasted in the Committee for six weeks and at its conclusion this House by an independent noble spirited and unexpected majority by a majority that will redeem all the acts ever done by majorities in Parliament in the teeth of all the old mercenary Swiss of state in despite of all the speculators and augurs of political events in defiance of the whole embattled legion of veteran pensioners and practised instruments of a court gave a total repeal to the stampact and if it had been so permitted a lasting peace to this whole empire  I state Sir these particulars because this act of spirit and fortitude has lately been in the circulation of the season and in some hazarded declamations in this House attributed to timidity If Sir the conduct of ministry in proposing the repeal had arisen from timidity with regard to themselves it would have been greatly to be condemned Interested timidity disgraces as much in the cabinet as personal timidity does in the field But timidity with regard to the wellbeing of our country is heroic  virtue The noble Lord who then conducted affairs and his worthy collegues whilst they trembled at the prospect of such distresses as you have since brought upon yourselves was not afraid steadily to look in the face that glaring and dazzling influence at which the eyes of eagles have blenched He looked in the face one of the ablest and let me say not the most scrupulous oppositions that perhaps ever was in this House and withstood it unaided by even one of the usual supports of administration He did this when he repealed the stampact He looked in the face a person he had long respected and regarded and whose aid was then particularly wanting I mean Lord Chatham He did this when he passed the declaratory act  It is now given out for the usual purposes by the usual emissaries that Lord Rockingham did not consent to the repeal of this act until he was bullied into it by Lord Chatham and the reporters have gone so far as publickly to assert in an hundred companies that the Hon Gentleman under the gallery  General Conway  who proposed the repeal in the American committee had another sett of resolutions in his pocket directly the reverse of those he moved These artifices of a desperate cause are at this time spread abroad with incredible care in every part of the town from the highest to the lowest companies as if the industry of the circulation were to make amends for the absurdity of the report  Sir whether the noble Lord is of a complexion to be bullied by Lord Chatham or by any man I must submit to those who know him I confess when I look back to that time I consider him as placed in one of the most trying situations in which perhaps any man ever stood In the House of Peers there were very few of the ministry out of the noble Lord's own particular connexion except Lord Egmont who acted as far as I could discern an honourable and manly part that did not look to some other future arrangement which warped his politicks There were in both houses new and menacing appearances that might very naturally drive any other than a most resolute minister from his measure  or from his station The household troops openly revolted The allies of ministry those I mean who supported some of their measures but refused responsibility for any endeavoured to undermine their credit and to take ground that must be fatal to the succcess of the very cause which they would be thought to countenance The question of the repeal was brought on by ministry in the Committee of this House in the very instant when it was known that more than one court negotiation was carrying on with the heads of the opposition Every thing upon every side was full of traps and mines Earth below shook heaven above menaced all the elements of ministerial safety were dissolved It was in the midst of this chaos of plots and counterplots it was in the midst of this complicated warfare against public opposition and private treachery that the firmness of that noble Person was put to the proof He never stirred from his ground no not an inch He remained fixed and determined in principle in measure and in conduct He practised no managements He secured no retreat He sought no apology  I will likewise do justice I ought to do it to the Hon Gentleman who led us in this House  General Conway  Far from the duplicity wickedly charged on him he acted his part with alacrity and resolution We all felt inspired by the example he gave us down even to myself the weakest in that phalanx I declare for one I knew well enough it could not be concealed from any body the true state of things but in my life I never came with so much spirits into this House It was a time for a  man  to act in We had powerful enemies but we had faithful and determined friends and a glorious cause We had a great battle to fight but we had the means of fighting not as now when our arms are tied behind us We did fight that day and conquer  I remember Sir with a melancholy pleasure the situation of the Hon Gentleman  General Conway  who made the motion for the repeal in that crisis when the whole trading interest of this empire crammed into your lobbies with a trembling and anxious expectation waited  almost to a winter's return of light their fate from your resolutions When at length you had determined in their favour and your doors thrown open shewed them the figure of their deliverer in the wellearned triumph of his important victory from the whole of that grave multitude there arose an involuntary burst of gratitude and transport They jumped upon him like children on a long absent father They clung about him as captives about their redeemer All England all America joined in his applause Nor did he seem insensible to the best of all earthly rewards the love and admiration of his fellowcitizens  Hope elevated and joy brightened his crest  I stood near him and his face to use the expression of the Scripture of the first martyr  "his face was as if it had been the face of an angel"  I do not know how others feel but if I had stood in that situation I never would have exchanged it for all that kings in their profusion could bestow I did hope that that day's danger and honour would have been a bond to hold us all together for ever But alas that with other pleasing visions is long since vanished  Sir this act of supreme magnanimity has been represented as if it had been a measure of an administration that having no scheme of their own took a middle line pilfered a bit from one side and a bit from the other Sir they took  no  middle lines They differed fundamentally from the schemes of both parties but they preserved the objects of both They preserved the authority of Great Britain They preserved the equity of Great Britain They made the declaratory act they repealed the stamp act They did both  fully  because the declaratory act was  without qualification  and the repeal of the stamp act  total  This they did in the situation I have described  Now Sir what will the adversary say to both these acts If the principle of the declaratory act was not good the principle we are contending for this day is monstrous If the principle of the repeal was not good why are we not at war for a real substantial effective revenue If both were bad why has this ministry incurred all the inconveniences of both and of all schemes Why  have they enacted repealed enforced yielded and now attempt to enforce again  Sir I think I may as well now as at any other time speak to a certain matter of fact not wholly unrelated to the question under your consideration We who would persuade you to revert to the antient policy of this kingdom labour under the effect of this short current phrase which the court leaders have given out to all their corps in order to take away the credit of those who would prevent you from that frantic war you are going to wage upon your Colonies Their cant is this  "All the disturbances in America have been created by the repeal of the Stamp Act"  I suppress for a moment my indignation at the falsehood baseness and absurdity of this most audacious assertion Instead of remarking on the motives and character of those who have issued it for circulation I will clearly lay before you the state of America antecedently to that repeal after the repeal and since the renewal of the schemes of American taxation  It is said that the disturbances if there were any before the repeal were slight and without difficulty or inconvenience might have been suppressed For an answer to this assertion I will send you to the great author and patron of the Stamp Act who certainly meaning well to the authority of this Country and fully apprized of the state of that made before a repeal was so much as agitated in this House the motion which is on your Journals and which to save the Clerk the trouble of turning to it I will now read to you It was for an amendment to the address of the th of December  "  To express our just resentment and indignation at the  outrageous tumults and insurrections  which have been excited and carried on in North America and at the resistance given by  open  and  rebellious  force to the execution of the laws in that part of his Majesty's dominions And to assure his Majesty that his faithful Commons animated with the warmest duty and attachment to his royal person and government will firmly and effectually support his Majesty in all  such measures as shall be necessary for preserving and supporting the legal dependance of the Colonies on the Mother Country  c c"  Here was certainly a disturbance preceding the repeal such a disturbance as Mr Grenville thought necessary to qualify by the name of an  insurrection  and the epithet of a  rebellious  force terms much stronger than any by which those who then supported his motion have ever since thought proper to distinguish the subsequent disturbances in America They were disturbances which seemed to him and his friends to justify as strong a promise of support as hath been usual to give in the beginning of a war with the most powerful and declared enemies When the accounts of the American Governors came before the House they appeared stronger even than the warmth of public imagination had painted them so much stronger that the papers on your table bear me out in saying that all the late disturbances which have been at one time the Minister's motives for the repeal of five out of six of the new court taxes and are now his pretences for refusing to repeal that sixth did not amountwhy do I compare them no not to a tenth part of the tumults and violence which prevailed long before the repeal of that act  Ministry cannot refuse the authority of the commander in chief General Gage who in his Letter of the th of November from New York thus represents the state of things  "  It is difficult to say from the  highest to the lowest  who has not been  accessory  to this  insurrection  either by writing or  mutual agreements  to oppose the act by what they are pleased to term all legal opposition to it Nothing effectual has been proposed either to prevent or quell the tumult  The rest of the Provinces are in the same situation  as to a positive refusal to take the stamps and threatening those who shall take them  to plunder and murder them  and this affair stands  in all the Provinces  that unless the act from its own nature enforce itself nothing but a  very  considerable military force can do it  "  It is remarkable Sir that the persons who formerly trumpeted forth the most loudly the violent resolutions of assemblies the universal insurrections the seizing and burning the stamped papers the forcing stamp officers to resign their commissions under the gallows the rifling and pulling down of the houses of magistrates and the expulsion from their country of all who dared to write or speak a single word in defence of the powers of parliament these very trumpeters are now the men that represent the whole as a mere trifle and choose to date all the disturbances from the repeal of the stamp act which put an end to to them Hear your officers abroad and let them refute this shameless falsehood who in all their correspondence state the disturbances as owing to their true causes the discontent of the people from the taxes You have this evidence in your own archivesand it will give you compleat satisfaction if you are not so far lost to all parliamentary ideas of information as rather to credit the lye of the day than the records of your own House  Sir this vermin of court reporters when they are forced into day upon one point are sure to burrow in another but they shall have no refuge I will make them bolt out of all their holes Conscious that they must be baffled when they attribute a precedent disturbance to a subsequent measure they take other ground almost as absurd but very common in modern practice and very wicked which is to attribute the ill effect of illjudged conduct to the arguments which had been used to dissuade us from it They say that the opposition made in parliament to the stamp act at the time of its passing encouraged the Americans to their resistance This has even formally appeared in print in a regular volume from an advocate of that faction a Dr Tucker This Dr Tucker is already a dean and his earnest labours in this vineyard will I suppose raise him to a bishoprick But this assertion too just like the rest is false In all the papers which have loaded your table in all the vast crowd of verbal witnesses that appeared at your bar witnesses which were indiscriminately produced from both sides of the House not the least hint of such a cause of disturbance has ever appeared As to the fact of a strenuous opposition to the  stamp act I sat as a stranger in your gallery when the act was under consideration Far from any thing inflammatory I never heard a more languid debate in this House No more than two or three gentlemen as I remember spoke against the act and that with great reserve and remarkable temper There was but one division in the whole progress of the bill and the minority did not reach to more than or In the House of Lords I do not recollect that there was any debate or division at all I am sure there was no protest In fact the affair passed with so very very little noise that in town they scarcely knew the nature of what you were doing The opposition to the bill in England never could have done this mischief because there scarcely ever was less of opposition to a bill of consequence  Sir the agents and distributors of falsehoods have with their usual industry circulated another lye of the same nature with the former It is this that the disturbances arose from the account which had been received in America of the change in the ministry No longer awed it seems with the spirit of the former rulers they thought themselves a match for what our calumniators choose to qualify by the name of so feeble a ministry as succeeded Feeble in one sense these men certainly may be called for with all their efforts and they have made many they have not been able to resist the distempered vigour and insane alacrity with which you are rushing to your ruin But it does so happen that the falsity of this circulation is like the rest demonstrated by indisputable dates and records  So little was the change known in America that the letters of your governors giving an account of these disturbances long after they had arrived at their highest pitch were all directed to the  Old Ministry  and particularly to the  Earl of Halifax  the secretary of state corresponding with the Colonies without once in the smallest degree intimating the slightest suspicion of any ministerial revolution whatsoever The ministry was not changed in England until the tenth day of July On the th of the preceding June Governor Fauquier from Virginia writes thus and writes thus to the Earl of Halifax  "  Government is set at  defiance  not having strength enough in her hands to enforce obedience to the laws of the  communityThe private distress which every man feels encreases the  general dissatisfaction  at the duties laid by the  Stamp Act  which breaks out and shews itself upon every trifling occasion  "  The general dissatisfaction had produced some time before that is on the th of May several strong public resolves against the Stamp Act and those resolves are assigned by Governor Bernard as the cause of the  insurrections  in Massachuset's Bay in his letter of the th of August still addressed to the Earl of Halifax and he continued to address such accounts to that Minister quite to the th of September of the same year Similar accounts and of as late a date were sent from other governors and all directed to Lord Halifax Not one of these letters indicates the slightest idea of a change either known or even apprehended  Thus are blown away the infect race of courtly falsehoods thus perish the miserable inventions of the wretched runners for a wretched cause which they have flyblown into every weak and rotten part of the country in vain hopes that when their maggots had taken wing their importunate buzzing might sound something like the public voice  Sir I have troubled you sufficiently with the state of America before the repeal Now I turn to the Hon Gentleman who so stoutly challenges us to tell whether after the repeal the Provinces were quiet This is coming home to the point Here I meet him directly and answer most readily  They were quiet  And I in my turn challenge him to prove when and where and by whom and in what numbers and with what violence the other laws of trade as gentlemen assert were violated in consequence of your concession or that even your other revenue laws were attacked But I quit the vantage ground on which I stand and where I might leave the burthen of the proof upon him I walk down upon the open plain and undertake to shew that they were not only quiet but shewed many unequivocal marks of acknowledgement and gratitude And to give him every advantage I select the obnoxious Colony of Massachuset's Bay which at this time but without hearing her is so heavily a culprit before parliamentI will select their proceedings even under circumstances of no small  irritation For a little imprudently I must say Governor Bernard mixed in the administration of the lenitive of the repeal no small acrimony arising from matters of a separate nature Yet see Sir the effect of that lenitive though mixed with these bitter ingredients and how this rugged people can express themselves on a measure of concession  "  If it is not now in our power  " say they in their address to Gov Bernard "  in so full a manner as will be expected to shew our respectful gratitude to the Mother Country or to make a dutiful and affectionate return to the indulgence of the King and Parliament it shall be no fault of ours for this we intend and hope we shall be able fully to effect  "  Would to God that this temper had been cultivated managed and set in action other effects than those which we have since felt would have resulted from it On the requisition for compensation to those who had suffered from the violence of the populace in the same address they say  "  The recommendation enjoined by Mr Secretary Conway's Letter and in consequence thereof made to us we will embrace the first convenient opportunity to consider and act upon  "  They did consider they did act upon it They obeyed the requisition I know the mode has been chicaned upon but it was substantially obeyed and much better obeyed than I fear the parliamentary requisition of this session will be though enforced by all your rigour and backed with all your power In a word the damages of popular fury were compensated by legislative gravity Almost every other part of America in various ways demonstrated their gratitude I am bold to say that so sudden a calm recovered after so violent a storm is without parallel in history To say that no other disturbance should happen from any other cause is folly But as far as appearances went by the judicious sacrifice of one law you procured an acquiescence in all that remained After this experience nobody shall persuade me when an whole people are concerned that acts of lenity are not means of conciliation  I hope the Hon Gentleman has received a fair and full answer to his question  I have done with the third period of your policy that of your repeal and the return of your ancient system and your antient tranquillity and concord Sir this period was not as long as it was happy Another scene was opened and other actors appeared on the stage The state in the condition I have described it was delivered into the hands of Lord Chathama great and celebrated name a name that keeps the name of this country respectable in every other on the globe It may be truly called  Clarum et venerabile nomen  Gentibus et multum nostrae quod proderat urbi  Sir the venerable age of this great man his merited rank his superior eloquence his splendid qualities his eminent services the vast space he fills in the eye of mankind and more than all the rest his fall from power which like death canonizes and sanctifies a great character will not suffer me to censure any part of his conduct I am afraid to flatter him I am sure I am not disposed to blame him Let those who have betrayed him by their adulation insult him with their malevolence But what I do not presume to censure I may have leave to lament For a wise man he seemed to me at that time to be governed too much by general maxims I speak with the freedom of history and I hope without offence One or two of these maxims flowing from an opinion not the most indulgent to our unhappy species and surely a little too general led him into measures that were greatly mischievous to himself and for that reason among others perhaps fatal to his country measures the effects of which I am afraid are for ever inurable He made an administration so checkered and speckled he put together a piece of joinery so crossly indented and whimsically dovetailed a cabinet so variously inlaid such a piece of diversified Mosaic such a tesselated pavement without cement here a bit of black stone and there a bit of white patriots and courtiers kings friends and republicans whigs and tories treacherous friends and open enemies that it was indeed a very curious show but utterly unsafe to touch and unsure to stand on The colleagues whom he had assorted at the same boards stared at each other and were obliged to ask  "Sir your nameSir you have the advantage of meMr Such a  oneI beg a thousand pardons"  I venture to say it did so happen that persons had a single office divided between them who had never spoke to each other in their lives until they found themselves they knew not how pigging together heads and points in the same trucklebed  Supposed to allude to the Right Hon Lord North and George Cook Esq who were made joint paymasters in the Summer of on the removal of the Rockingham administration    Sir in consequence of this arrangement having put so much the larger part of his enemies and opposers into power the confusion was such that his own principles could not possibly have any effect or influence in the conduct of affairs If ever he fell into a fit of the gout or if any orher cause withdrew him from public cares principles directly the contrary were sure to predominate When he had executed his plan he had not an inch of ground to stand upon When he had accomplished his scheme of administration he was no longer a minister  When his face was hid but for a moment his whole system was on a wide sea without chart or compass The gentlemen his particular friends who with the names of various departments of ministry were admitted to seem as if they acted a part under him with a modesty that becomes all men and with a confidence in him which was justified even in its extravagance by his superior abilities had never in any instance presumed upon any opinion of their own Deprived of his guiding influence they were whirled about the sport of every gust and easily driven into any port and as those who joined with them in manning the vessel were the most directly opposite to his opinions measures and character and far the most artful and most powerful of the set they easily prevailed so as to seize upon the vacant unoccupied and derelict minds of his friends and instantly they turned the vessel wholly out of the course of his policy As if it were to insult as well as to betray him even long before the close of the first session of his administration when every thing was publickly transacted and with great parade in his name they made an act declaring it highly just and expedient to raise a revenue in America For even then Sir even before this splendid orb was entirely set and while the Western horizon was in a  blaze with his descending glory on the opposite quarter of the heavens arose another luminary and for his hour became lord of the ascendant  This light too is passed and set for ever You understand to be sure that I speak of Charles Townshend officially the reproducer of this fatal scheme whom I cannot even now remember without some degree of sensibility In truth Sir he was the delight and ornament of this house and the charm of every private society which he honoured with his presence Perhaps there never arose in this country nor in any country a man of a more pointed and finished wit and where his passions were not concerned of a more refined exquisite and penetrating a judgment If he had not so great a stock as some have had who flourished formerly of knowledge long treasured up he knew better by far than any man I ever was acquainted with how to bring together within a short time all that was necessary to establish to illustrate and to decorate that side of the question he supported He stated his matter skilfully and powerfully He particularly excelled in a most luminous explanation and display of his subject His style of argument was neither trite and vulgar nor subtle and abstruse He hit the house just between wind and waterAnd not being troubled with too anxious a zeal for any matter in question he was never more tedious or more earnest than the preconceived opinions and present temper of his hearers required to whom he was always in perfect unison He conformed exactly to the temper of the house and he seemed to guide because he was always sure to follow it  I beg pardon Sir if when I speak of this and of other great men I appear to digress in saying something of their characters In this eventful history of the revolutions of America the characters of such men are of much importance Great men are the guideposts and landmarks in the state The credit of such men at court or in the nation is the sole cause of all the publick measures It would be an invidious thing most foreign I trust to what you think my disposition to remark the errors into which the authority of great  names has brought the nation without doing justice at the same time to the great qualities whence that authority arose The subject is instructive to those who wish to form themselves on whatever of excellence has gone before them There are many young members in the house such of late has been the rapid succession of publick men who never saw that prodigy Charles Townshend nor of course know what a ferment he was able to excite in every thing by the violent ebullition of his mixed virtues and failings For failings he had undoubtedlymany of us remember them we are this day considering the effect of them But he had no failings which were not owing to a noble cause to an ardent generous perhaps an immoderate passion for Fame a passion which is the instinct of all great souls He worshiped that goddess wheresoever she appeared but he paid his particular devotions to her in her favourite habitation in her chosen temple the House of Commons Besides the characters of the individuals that compose our body it is impossible Mr Speaker not to observe that this house has a collective character of its own That character too however imperfect is not unamiable Like all great public collections of men you possess a marked love of virtue and an abhorence of vice But among vices there is none which the house abhors in the same degree with  obstinacy  Obstinacy Sir is certainly a great vice and in the changeful state of political affairs it is frequently the cause of great mischief It happens however very unfortunately that almost the whole line of the great and masculine virtues constancy gravity magnanimity fortitude fidelity and firmness are closely allied to this disagreeable quality of which you have so just an abhorrence and in their excess all these virtues very easily fall into it He who paid such a punctilious attention to all your feelings certainly took care not to shock them by that vice which is the most disgustful to you  That fear of displeasing those who ought most to be pleased betrayed him sometimes into the other extreme He had voted and in the year had been an advocate for the Stamp Act Things and the disposition of mens minds were changed In short the Stamp Act began to be no favourite in this house He therefore attended at the private meeting in which the resolutions  moved by a Right Honourable Gentleman were settled resolutions leading to the repeal The next day he voted for that repeal and he would have spoken for it too if an illness not as was then given out a political but to my knowledge a very real illness had not prevented it  The very next session as the fashion of this world passeth away the repeal began to be in as bad an odour in this house as the Stamp Act had been in the session before To conform to the temper which began to prevail and to prevail mostly amongst those most in power he declared very early in the Winter that a revenue must be had out of America Instantly he was tied down to his engagements by some who had no objection to such experiments when made at the cost of persons for whom they had no particular regard The whole body of courtiers drove him onward They always talked as if the king stood in a sort of humiliated state until something of the kind should be done  Here this extraordinary man then Chancellor of the Exchequer found himself in great straits To please universally was the object of his life but to tax and to please no more than to love and to be wise is not given to men However he attempted it To render the tax palatable to the partizans of American revenue he made a preamble stating the necessity of such a revenue To close with the American distinction this revenue was an  external  or portduty but again to soften it to the other party it was a duty of  supply  To gratify the  colonists  it was laid on British manufactures to satisfy the  merchants of Britain  the duty was trivial and except that on tea which touched only the devoted East India Company on none of the grand objects of commerce To counterwork the American contraband the duty on tea was reduced from a shilling to threepence But to secure the favour of those who would tax America the scene of collection was changed and with the rest it was levied in the Colonies What need I say more This finespun scheme had the usual fate of all exquisite policy But the original plan of the duties and the mode of executing that plan both arose singly and solely from a love of our applause He was truly the child of the house He never thought did or  said any thing but with a view to you He every day adapted himself to your disposition and adjusted himself before it as at a lookingglass  He had observed indeed it could not escape him that several persons infinitely his inferiors in all respects had formerly rendered themselves considerable in this house by one method alone They were a race of men I hope in God the species is extinct who when they rose in their place no man living could divine from any known adherence to parties to opinions or to principles from any order or system in their politics or from any sequel or connection in their ideas what part they were going to take in any debate It is astonishing how much this uncertainty especially at critical times called the attention of all parties on such men All eyes were fixed on them all ears open to hear them each party gaped and looked alternately for their vote almost to the end of their speeches While the House hung in this uncertainty now the  Hearhims  rose from this sidenow they rebellowed from the other and that party to whom they fell at length from their tremulous and dancing balance always received them in a tempest of applause The fortune of such men was a temptation too great to be resisted by one to whom a single whiff of incense withheld gave much greater pain than he received delight in the clouds of it which daily rose about him from the prodigal superstition of innumerable admirers He was a candidate for contradictory honours and his great aim was to make those agree in admiration of him who never agreed in any thing else  Hence arose this unfortunate act the subject of this day's debate from a disposition which after making an American revenue to please one repealed it to please others and again revived it in hopes of pleasing a third and of catching something in the ideas of all  This revenue act of formed the fourth period of American policy How we have fared since thenwhat woeful variety of schemes have been adopted what enforcing and what repealing what bullying and what submitting what doing and undoing what straining and what relaxing what assemblies dissolved for not obeying and called again without obedience what troops sent out  to quell resistance and on meeting that resistance recalled what shiftings and changes and jumblings of all kinds of men at home which left no possibility of order consistency vigour or even so much as a decent unity of colour in any one public measureIt is a tedious irksome task My duty may call me to open it out some other time  Resolutions moved in May  on a former occasion I tried your temper on a part of it for the present I shall forbear  After all these changes and agitations your immediate situation upon the question on your paper is at length brought to this You have an act of parliament stating that  "it is  expedient  to raise a revenue in America"  By a partial repeal you have annihilated the greatest part of that revenue which this preamble declares to be so expedient You have substituted no other in the place of it A secretary of state has disclaimed in the king's name all thoughts of such a sustitution in future The principle of this disclaimer goes to what has been left as well as what has been repealed The tax which lingers after its companions under a preamble declaring an American revenue expedient and for the sole purpose of supporting the theory of that preamble militates with the assurance authentically conveyed to the Colonies and is an exhaustless source of jealousy and animosity On this state which I take to be a fair one not being able to discern any grounds of honour advantage peace or power for adhering either to the act or to the preamble I shall vote for the question which leads to the repeal of both  If you do not fall in with this motion then secure something to fight for consistent in theory and valuable in practice If you must employ your strength employ it to uphold you in some honourable right or some profitable wrong If you are apprehensive that the concession recommended to you though proper should be a means of drawing on you further but unreasonable claimswhy then employ your force in supporting that reasonable concession against those unreasonable demands You will employ it with more grace with better effect and with great probable concurrence of all the quiet and rational people in the provinces who are now united with and hurried away by the violent having indeed different dispositions  but a common interest If you apprehend that on a concession you shall be pushed by metaphysical process to the extreme lines and argued out of your whole authority my advice is this when you have recovered your old your strong your tenable position then face aboutstop shortdo nothing morereason not at alloppose the antient policy and practice of the empire as a rampart against the speculations of innovators on both sides of the question and you will stand on great manly and sure ground On this solid basis fix your machines and they will draw worlds towards you  Your ministers in their own and his Majesty's name have already adopted the American distinction of internal and external duties It is a distinction whatever merit it may have that was originally moved by the Americans themselves and I think they will acquiesce in it if they are not pushed with too much logic and too little sense in all the consequences That is if external taxation be understood as they and you understand it when you please to be not a distinction of Geography but of policy that it is a power for regulating trade and not for supporting establishments The distinction which is as nothing with regard to right is of most weighty consideration in practice Recover your old ground and your old tranquillitytry itI am persuaded the Americans will compromise with you When confidence is once restored the odious and suspicious  summum jus  will perish of course The spirit of practicability of moderation and mutual convenience will never call in Geometrical exactness as the arbitrator of an amicable settlement Consult and follow your experience Let not the long story with which I have exercised your patience prove fruitless to your interests  For my part I should choose if I could have my wish that the proposition of the  Mr Fuller  Honourable Gentleman for the repeal could go to America without the attendance of the penal bills Alone I could almost answer for its success I cannot be certain of its reception in the bad company it may keep In such heterogeneous assortments the most innocent person will lose the effect of his innocency  Though you should send out this angel of peace yet you are sending out a destroying angel too and what would be the effect of the conflist of these two adverse spirits or which would predominate in the end is what I dare not say whether the lenient measures would cause American passion to subside or the severe would increase its furyAll this is in the hand of Providence yet now even now I should confide in the prevailing virtue and efficacious operation of lenity though working in darkness and in chaos in the midst of all this unnatural and turbid combination I should hope it might produce order and beauty in the end  Let us Sir embrace some system or other before we end this session Do you mean to tax America and to draw a productive revenue from thence If you do speak out name fix ascertain this revenue settle its quantity define its objects provide for its collection and then fight when you have something to fight for If you murderrob If you kill take possession and do not appear in the character of madmen as well as assassins violent vindictive bloody and tyrannical without an object But may better counsels guide you  Again and again revert to your old principlesseek peace and ensure itleave America if she has taxable matter in her to tax herself I am not here going into the distinctions of rights nor attempting to mark their boundaries I do not enter into these metaphysical distinctions I hate the very sound of them Leave the Americans as they antiently stood and these distinctions born of our unhappy contest will die along with it They and we and their and our ancestors have been happy under that system Let the memory of all actions in contradiction to that good old mode on both sides be extinguished for ever Be content to bind America by laws of trade you have always done it Let this be your reason for binding their trade Do not burthen them by taxes you were not used to do so from the beginning Let this be your reason for not taxing These are the arguments of states and kingdoms Leave the rest to the schools for there only they may be discussed with safety But if intemperately unwisely fatally you sophisticate and poison the very source of government by  urging subtle deductions and consequences odious to those you govern from the unlimited and illimitable nature of supreme sovereignty you will teach them by these means to call that sovereignty itself in question When you drive him hard the boar will surely turn upon the hunters If that sovereignty and their freedom cannot be reconciled which will they take they will cast your sovereignty in your face No body will be argued into slavery Sir let the gentlemen on the other side call forth all their ability let the best of them get up and tell me what one character of liberty the Americans have and what one brand of slavery they are free from if they are bound in their property and industry by all the restraints you can imagine on commerce and at the same time are made packhorses of every tax you choose to impose without the least share in granting them When they bear the burthens of unlimited monopoly will you bring them to bear the burthens of unlimited revenue too The Englishman in America will feel that this slaverythat it is  legal  slavery will be no compensation either to his feelings or his understanding  A Noble Lord  Lord Carmarthen  who spoke some time ago is full of the fire of ingenuous youth and when he has modeled the ideas of a lively imagination by further experience he will be an ornament to his country in either house He has said that the Americans are our children and how can they revolt against their parent He says that if they are not free in their present state England is not free because Manchester and other considerable places are not represented So then because some towns in England are not represented America is to have no representative at all They are "our children" but when children ask for bread we are not to give a stone Is it because the natural resistance of things and the various mutations of time hinders our government or any scheme of government from being any more than a sort of approximation to the right is it therefore that the Colonies are to recede from it infinitely When this child of ours wishes to assimilate to its parent and to reflect with a true filial resemblance the beauteous countenance of British liberty are we to turn to them the shameful parts of our constitution are we to give them our weakness for  their strength our opprobium for their glory and the slough of slavery which we are not able to work off to serve them for their freedom  If this be the case ask yourselves this question will they be content in such a state of slavery If not look to the consequences Reflect how you are to govern a people who think they ought to be free and think they are not Your scheme yields no revenue it yields nothing but discontent disorder disobedience and such is the state of America that after wading up to your eyes in blood you could only end just where you begun that is to tax where no revenue is to be found tomy voice fails me my inclination indeed carries me no furtherall is confusion beyond it  Well Sir I have recovered a little and before I sit down I must say something to another point with which gentlemen urge us What is to become of the declaratory act asserting the entireness of British legislative authority if we abandon the practice of taxation  For my part I look upon the rights stated in that act exactly in the manner in which I viewed them on its very first proposition and which I have often taken the liberty with great humility to lay before you I look I say on the imperial rights of Great Britain and the privileges which the Colonists ought to enjoy under these rights to be just the most reconcileable things in the world The Parliament of Great Britain sits at the head of her extensive empire in two capacities one as the local legislature of this island providing for all things at home immediately and by no other instrument than the executive powerThe other and I think her nobler capacity is what I call her  imperial character  in which as from the throne of heaven she superintends all the several inferior legislatures and guides and controls them all without annihilating any As all these provincial legislatures are only coordinate to each other they ought all to be subordinate to her else they can neither preserve mutual peace nor hope for mutual justice nor effectually afford mutual assistance It is necessary to coerce the negligent to restrain  the violent and to aid the weak and deficient by the overruling plenitude of her power She is never to intrude into the place of the others whilst they are equal to the common ends of their institution But in order to enable parliament to answer all these ends of provident and beneficent superintendance her powers must be boundless The gentlemen who think the powers of parliament limited may please themselves to talk of requisitions But suppose the requisitions are not obeyed What Shall there be no reserved power in the empire to supply a deficiency which may weaken divide and dissipate the whole We are engaged in warthe Secretary of State calls upon the Colonies to contributesome would do it I think most would chearfully furnish whatever is demandedone or two suppose hang back and easing themselves let the stress of the draft lie on the otherssurely it is proper that some authority might legally say  "Tax yourselves for the common supply or parliament will do it for you"  This backwardness was as I am told actually the case of Pennsylvania for some short time towards the beginning of the last war owing to some internal dissentions in the Colony But whether the fact were so or otherwise the case is equally to be provided for by a competent sovereign power But then this ought to be no ordinary power nor ever used in the first instance This is what I meant when I have said at various times that I consider the power of taxing in parliament as an instrument of empire and not as a means of supply  Such Sir is my idea of the constitution of the British Empire as distinguished from the constitution of Britain and on these grounds I think subordination and liberty may be sufficiently reconciled through the whole whether to serve a refining speculatist or a factious demagogue I know not but enough surely for the case and happiness of man  Sir whilst we held this happy course we drew more from the Colonies than all the impotent violence of despotism ever could extors from them We did this abundantly in the last war It has never been once deniedand what reason have we to imagine that the Colonies would not have proceeded in supplying government as liberally if you had not stepped in and hindered them from contributing  by interrupting the channel in which their liberality flowed with so strong a course by attempting to take instead of being satisfied to receive Sir William Temple says that Holland has loaded itself with ten times the impositions which it revolted from Spain rather than submit to He says true Tyranny is a poor provider It knows neither how to accumulate nor how to extract  I charge therefore to this new and unfortunate system the loss not only of peace of union and of commerce but even of revenue which its friends are contending forIt is morally certain that we have lost at least a million of free grants since the peace I think we have lost a great deal more and that those who look for a revenue from the Provinces never could have pursued even in that light a course more directly repugnant to their purposes  Now Sir I trust I have shewn first on that narrow ground which the Hon Gentleman measured that you are like to lose nothing by complying with the motion except what you have lost already I have shewn afterwards that in time of peace you flourished in commerce and when war required it had sufficient aid from the Colonies while you pursued your antient policy that you threw every thing into confusion when you made the stamp act and that you restored every thing to peace and order when you repealed it I have shewn that the revival of the system of taxation has produced the very worst effects and that the partial repeal has produced not partial good but universal evil Let these considerations founded on facts not one of which can be denied bring us back to your reason by the road of your experience  I cannot as I have said answer for mixed measures but surely this mixture of lenity would give the whole a better chance of success When you once regain confidence the way will be clear before you Then you may enforce the act of navigation when it ought to be enforced You will yourselves open it where it ought still further to be opened Proceed in what you do whatever you do from policy and not from rancour Let us act like men let us act like statesmen Let us hold some sort of consistent conduct  It is agreed that a revenue is not to be had in America If we lose the profit let us get rid of the odium  On this business of America I confess I am serious even to sadness I have had but one opinion concerning it since I sat and before I sat in Parliament The noble Lord  Lord North  will as usual probably attribute the part taken by me and my friends in this business to a desire of getting his places Let him enjoy this happy and original idea If I deprived him of it I should take away most of his wit and all his argument But I had rather bear the brunt of all his wit and indeed blows much heavier than stand answerable to God for embracing a system that tends to the destruction of some of the very best and fairest of his works But I know the map of England as well as the noble Lord  Lord North  or as any other person and I know that the way I take is not the road to preferment My excellent and honourable friend under me on the floor  Mr Dowdeswell  has trod that road with great toil for upwards of twenty years together He is not yet arrived at the noble Lord's destination However the tracks of my worthy friend are those I have ever wished to follow because I know they lead to honour Long may we tread the same road together whoever may accompany us or whoever may laugh at us on our journey I honestly and solemnly declare I have in all seasons adhered to the system of for no other reason than that I think it laid deep in your truest interestsand that by limiting the exercise it fixes on the firmest foundations a real consistent wellgrounded authority in parliament Until you come back to that system there will be no peace for England  FINIS  ERRATA  Page Line the underpinning
