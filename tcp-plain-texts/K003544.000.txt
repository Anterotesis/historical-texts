 A COLLECTION OF POEMS ON VARIOUS SUBJECTS  By THOMAS ELLWOOD  LONDON  Printed and sold by LUKE HINDE in  Georgeyard Lombardstreet  Price Sixpence  TO THE READER  THE following POEMS wrote by THOMAS ELLWOOD which have lain dormant in  Manuscript  for many Years being lately communicated to me by a Friend I thereupon gave them a serious Perusal and observing the pious and religious Sentiments wherewith they abound thought they were too good  to be lost  especially as there is room to hope the uncaptious and sincerely religious Youth of either Sex may be benefitted thereby  The EDITOR  DIVINE WORSHIP  In vain do they worship  Me  teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men  Mat xv  OF WORSHIP I presume to sing  Yet from the  Nine  no Aid implore  SHILOH's outvies  Castalia's  Spring  Assist blest Pow'r whom I adore  Breath on my Muse and fill her Quill  With sacred Dews from  Hermonhill    Momus  be gone fly all ye Vain  Who the Wit of Poems place  In florid Strains my Muse is plain  Fine Cloth exceeds fantastick Lace  On Kersey set I leave those Flights  To such as Fiction most delights  Let them also avoid the Place  Should there be of that scoffing Stock  Who are so destitute of GRACE  They at the SPIRIT's  Infl'ence  mock  To such my Muse no Pleasure brings  Who scorn the Power by which she sings  But come all ye who TRUTH embrace  Whose Souls do pure Religion love  Who prize the Gift of sacred GRACE  Whose Treasure lies in Realms above  Nay all that are not Foes draw near  And grant my Song a willing Ear  In early Times when Man was made  Before the  Priesthood  was confin'd  While TRUTH in  Adam's  Houshold stay'd  And GOD ador'd by all Mankind  No Form of Worship that appears  Had been prescrib'd for many Years  While Men with GOD a Converse kept  And on Him did devoutly wait  He gracious while they wak'd or slept  Did so their Minds illuminate  That they not only knew His Will  But by His Aid could it fulfill  Before the Flood and after long  The  Patriarchs  directed were  Both when to warble out their Song  And how to ope Heav'ns Gate by  Pray'r    Whatever Act the LORD requir'd  Their Hearts He thereunto inspir'd  But after that Heav'n did decree  In special Love to  Abraham    That his Posterity should be  Sacred to Him and bear His Name  A Worship asked at their hand  Which did in  Observations  stand  What must be  offer'd when  and  where    Each Part was carefully exprest  The  various Modes  prescribed were  For  sacrificing  and the rest  Settimes were fix'd for  solemn Feasts    Diff'rence 'twixt  clean  and  unclean Beasts    This legal Worship as it stood  In  Meats  and  Drinks  and  carnal Rites    Were Types of that eternal Good  To which the Gospel all invites  The longest Date that it could claim  Was but till  Heb ix  REFORMATION came  When that auspicious Time drew nigh  The Morning of that Day was come  The WORD descending from on high  Took sinless Flesh in Virgin's Womb  At whose blest Birth Heaven's Host rejoice  And pour their Hymns with raptur'd Voice  SHILOH so oft foretold thus come  His Death the Templevail did rend  And being of those Types the SUM  That  Dispensation  had its End  'Twas meet the  Servant  should withdraw  When he the MASTER's Presence saw  But yet e'er CHRIST would abrogate  A Worship so long Time in Use  And disannul the  legal State    He did a better introduce  This LAW was not in Marble cut  But in the Heart and Conscience put  For so the Prophets in GOD's Name  While yet the LAW in Vigour stood  Did by Authority proclaim  He said who what He says makes good  Jer xxxi Ezek xi  After those Days I in the Heart  My  FEAR  will place and  LAW  impart  Again  Joel ii  And it shall come to pass    My  SPIRIT  on all Flesh I'll pour  On Young and Old  the Lad and Lass  Shall feel the Virtue of this Show'r  Not of the  Priest  shall LAW be sought  But all thy Sons of GOD be taught  Happy they who such a TEACHER have  And yield thereto a willing Ear  From all that's hurtful He will save  If in His LAW they persevere  O that Mankind therein would walk  Nor some against some only for it talk  The SON of GOD who from Heav'n came  And fully Man's Redemption wrought  When met by the  Samarian  Dame  The true approved Worship taught  Not at that  Jerusalem  City  or this  Mount  Tho' rever'd for  Jacob's  Fount  But who the FATHER will adore  Whether Bond or Free Ag'd or Youth  Must worship not as heretofore  In Types but in SPIRIT and TRUTH  God's a Spiritamong  Jews  and  Greeks    Such inward Worshipers He seeks  Not those who serve in  Repititions    Or in  Prescriptions  as the  Jews    Nor yet in  oral vain Traditions    Such as  Samaritans  did use  Th'  Jewish  Faith in  Symbols  stood  Th'  Samaritan  's was never good  Types Shadows Sacraments  and  Signs    Did on this Dispensation wait  Who to the Gospelworship joins  Shadows  must leave to th'  shad'wy State  'Tis not the  fatted Calf  that skips  Is offer'd now but  Calves of Lips    Thanks and Praise Sacrifices are  To GOD most pleasing when they spring  From a pure Heart He doth prepare  And then excites His Acts to sing  True  Christ'ans  use both Heart and Tongue  Whene'er a Hymn or Psalm is sung  Not chanting in a formal Note  States  touch'd in ancient Song  Perverting what the  Psalmist  wrote  Whose Case cannot to all belong  'Tis who their own Exper'ence bring  With  Spirit  and with  Judgment  sing  Instead of Incense to perfume  The Altar from the Soul arise  In Flames that warm but not consume  Sighs Supplications Groans and Cries  Which tho' but weak do never fail  At MERCY's Fountain to prevail  Rom viii  We know not what to ask  PAUL taught  Who then shall  Forms  appoint  True Pray'r is by the SPIRIT wrought  With which Heav'n does each Child anoint  He that best knows what we should have  Inwardly teacheth what to crave  This then of WORSHIP is the Sum  To wait in  SPIRIT  on the  LORD  That at what Time He deigns to come  The Soul may hear His living Word  And with Alacrity fulfill  What He makes known to be His Will  For when the Mind on GOD is stay'd  In  Silence  waiting to be taught  The World's Concerns aside are laid  Nor Licence gi'n to one vain Thought  The LORD doth to that Soul draw near  And with Instruction fills its Ear  Instructed still the Soul doth cleave  The LORD His Virtue doth impart  Discoveries of His Will He leaves  Which operate upon the Heart  A Sacrifice He doth prepare  Whether  Thanksgiving Praise  or  Pray'r    Great is the Pleasure GOD doth take  In such Oblations in His Sight  That Soul is dear he'll not forsake  But in His  Book  his Name will write  The Joys that the Obedient feel  Nor Men nor Angels can reveal  INWARD PEACE  My PEACE I give unto you  John xiv  WHO can conceive much less express  The inward Peace which they possess  Who by the Indwelling of the LIGHT  Have put satanic Pow'rs to flight  In whom renew'd and born again  The LORD of Life doth live and reign  Renew'd restor'd purg'd purify'd  And nat'ral Rovings laid aside  Cleans'd by the BLOOD kept by the GRACE  That Sin in them scarce finds a Place  The Temple swept prepar'd then blest  With Presence of an heav'nly Guest  A Guest not for a Night or twain  But one that always will remain  Yea such a Guest as doth impart  That Joy which overcomes the Heart  A Joy so great no Tongue of Man  Express the Fullness of it can  And this unutterable Bliss  Flows from the Love of GOD to His  O Love immense and without Bound  To all that in the TRUTH are found  Words are too short to set it forth  In its Extent and real Worth  The  Wife  that in the Bosom lies  Is precious in the Husband's Eyes  The  sucking Babe  is very near  The  only Son  exceeding dear  Tender the  Apple of the Eye    Friends  and  Relations  very nigh  But yet this Love doth far transcend  That to  Wife Child Eye Parent Friend    These  Metaphors  are all too low  The Nature of this Love to show  No Tongue is able to declare  How dear to GOD His Children are  Only the Sense of it is felt  Which breaks the Heart and makes it melt  FRAUS DIABOLICA  THE Devil overreach'd Men by a Slight  When first he taught them  to oppose  the LIGHT  For he himself in Darkness dwells and he  That hates the LIGHT must needs in Darkness be  Archcraft indeed he knows the LIGHT who shun  Must needs into the thickest Darkness run  And he so craftily his Plot has laid  That many simple Ones he hath betray'd  To tread the Path that leads to Death's dark Cell  'Till by a sad Mistake they come to Hell  LOYALTY  I KNOW my Heart is loyal to my Prince  I never harbour'd a disloyal Thought  And If my Pen or Tongue hath given Offence  That Error hath thro' Ignorance been wrought  For which when prov'd I will for Mercy cry  And thankful live or uncomplaining die  THOUGHTS  HOW long alas shall vain Thoughts in me rest  And find a lurking Place within my Breast  How long how long e'er I a Conqueror be  And o'er my ownself get the Victory  Ah how disgustful is it when I find  Some little triv'al Thought possess my Mind  Oft have I set myself to keep the Door  That no vain Cogitation enter more  And reckon'd too so strict a Watch to keep  That nothing unexamin'd in should creep  But on a sudden when I least suspected  An idle Thought has Satan introjected  Which like a little Thief hath open set  The Door for greater Rovers in to get  I'll trust myself no more I see 'tis vain  Man of himself no Conquest can obtain  To Him will I betake myself from whom  Each good and perfect Gift I know doth come  His Succour will I beg His Aid implore  Who for the Helpless still has Help in Store  Thou  Israel  's SHEPHERD Thou alone canst keep  My Soul who neither slumber dost nor sleep  Thou  Everywhere  who dost all Places fill  Who art both perfect POW'R and perfect WILL  Thou  allsufficient  art no Thought can fly  The Scrutage of Thy  alldiscerning  EYE  And Thou dear FATHER too commanded hast  Thy Children  all their Care on  THEE  to cast    Which I most gladly do but yet not so  As henceforth careless in myself to grow  No I resolve still on the Watch to be  Not in my own Strength but impower'd by Thee  Set Thou the Watch O LORD appoint the Guard  Give Thou the Charge O help me so to ward  That no vain Thought into my Mind may slip  But in the  Embrio  may receive a Nip  Thou who for me hast great Deliv'rance wrought  Deliver too from ev'ry idle Thought  To such as  stand idle  in the  Marketplace  WHY do you trifle thus your Time away  Why are you of such Treasure so profuse  Do you expect to have another Day  Who of the present make so ill a Use  How can it be  The Moment that is past will come no more  The Hour mispent can never be recall'd  Old  Cronos  has but one poor Lock before  His Head behind is altogether bald  Take that from me  Be therefore wise in Time while yet an Hour  Is lent you lest when that is vainly spent  It never should again be in your Pow'r  Although with Tears ye seek it  to repent  For  GOD  is just  And tho' He frequently doth Man invite  To cease from Evil and accept of GRACE  Yet if fond Man persists His Love to slight  MERCY withdraws  Justice  steps in her Place  And die he must  AGONY  I FAINT my dying Breath will not suffice  To midwife forth my Words my falt'ring Tongue  Resigns its Office to my weeping Eyes  Speak Eyes and do my faithful Heart no Wrong  Ye crystal Fountains set your Sluices wide  Stream forth your Tears like a full flowing Tide  Draw up the Floodgates let the Torrent flow  In its right Current whether fast or slow  A STATE  BLEST is the Man whose Heart is found  When Trials come upright and sound  Whom not the Hopes of greatest Gain  Nor Fear of most tormenting Pain  Nor yet the most magnetick Pleasure  Nor Honours heap'd up without measure  Can cause to shrink or start aside  And leave the strait Way for the wide  This is the STATE on which my Eye is fix'd  Oh that no Cloud may ever come betwixt  But that my Heart may henceforth always dwell  In that which doth all earthly Things excel  For he alone can stand the dreadful Shock  Whose House is built on the eternal ROCK  To a FRIEND in AMERICA  MY Heart is with thee but I dare not give  Myself the Pleasure of a wand'ring Thought  That I to see the Day may ever live  When to  America  I may be brought  Where I that peaceful Solitude may find  Which more than Riches would delight my Mind  But here I'm fix'd my Station here is set  By Him whose Will is sov'reign to mine  My Work and Service tye me here as yet  At which I bless my GOD I don't repine  O may my Spirit always take Delight  In that which is most pleasing in His Sight  DEUS  est qui cuncta gubernat  EXCEPT the  Psalm cxxvii  LORD the City keep  The Watchman watches but in vain  The Adversary in will creep  And hardly be got out again  So close his Stratagems are laid  So deep and many are his Wiles  The Sentinel's by him betray'd  And he the Watchman too beguiles  Sometimes TRUTH's Colours up he sets  As if indeed a Friend he were  And by that Practice in he gets  Before his Falshood doth appear  And which is worst within are some  That always treacherous have been  Who when he to the Gate doth come  Too ready are to let him in  LORD Thou art He in whom I trust  On whom my Safety doth depend  Thou only canst subdue the Lust  Thou only canst the Place defend  My Weakness LORD I daily find  'Tis Thou alone sufficient art  To Thee therefore I have resign'd  The Care and keeping of my Heart  Be Thou Commander there in chief  Place Thou the Guard the Watchman set  At each Assault send Thou Relief  Let Satan no Advantage get  Put Thou the Enemy to flight  Break Thou his Strength his Works destroy  Discomfit Thou his Forces quite  And fill my Soul with lasting Joy  Take too a Course with those within  That would the Place to him betray  Burn up the Ground that brings forth Sin  And the rebellious Nature slay  Then shall I praise Thy holy Name  And Hallelujahs to Thee sing  My Tongue and Pen extend Thy Fame  Who art my GOD and  Sion  's KING  FANCY  WHen LOVE and HATE before my Fancy pass  They look methinks like a prospective Glass  If on another Person's Failings I  Do chance at any Time to cast an Eye  LOVE takes the End that doth extenuate  The opposite is held by squintey'd HATE  But if on 'tother hand I have a mind  To view their Actions who to me are kind  LOVE presently presents unto mine Eye  That Glass which their good Turns will magnify  HATE too would be as forward if she might  To clap her partial Glass before my Sight  But I am weary of herfor I know  She to all Goodness is a mortal Foe  LOVE's the best Glass by far yet many chuse  To look thro' that which Sight doth  most abuse    LOVE's Original  LOVE is a  Cyon  cropt from Virtue's Tree  And grafted in the Stock of Purity  Planted at first in Nature's choisest Soil  Before the Fiend did Nature's Beauty spoil  But thence transplanted to a richer Ground  Than can in all Dame Nature's Realm be found  Where being well manur'd it takes deep Root  Downward and Branches upward forth doth shoot  The Sap which doth this stately Tree maintain  Is  Sympathy  which runs as in a Vein  Thro' every Branch causing it first to sprout  And e'er awhile young tender Buds spring out  Nor is it barren but much Fruit doth bear  To Taste most pleasing and to Sight most fair  A sound substantial Fruit that can indure  The sharpest Frost and yet continue pure  And that ye may this Fruit the more admire  Take Notice that I call it  Chaste Desire    LOVE's Definition  The  Author  being press'd to shew his Mind  What is  true Love what not  hath here defin'd  I CALL not that  true Love  which can admit  Of Heats and Colds like to an Aguefit  Those Rivers which their Banks do overflow  In a few Hours their empty Channels show  That's not  true Love  that's grounded upon Wealth  Or hath the least Regard to worldly Pelf  For such an one might he his End obtain  Would prostitute his very WIFE for Gain  Nor can he with  true Lovers  have a Place  Who's Love depends upon some pretty Face  Which Age or Sickness having once defac'd  The very Groundwork of his Love is raz'd  And since that sordid Thing  SelfInterest    Is able to defile the chastest Breast  If not prevented therefore I declare  That  it  and  true Love  inconsistent are  Such Marks as these I could add many more  Like Watchtow'rs tending to forewarn the jolly  But young unskilful Mariners before  They split their Vessels on the Rocks of Folly  But for this Theme let this suffice while I  Tir'd with the Subject borrow Wings and fly  Into an higher Orb where I may view  That  Love  who's choicest Epithet is  true    That I call  Love  that only  Love  I call  Whose Birth appears to be  Caelestial    That and that only I account  true Love    Which in the Sphere of CHASTITY doth move  He's a  true Lover  not who can subdue  Monsters and Giants for his Mistress Sake  And sighs perhaps and weep with much ado  For fear she should some other happy make  But who so far her Happiness prefers  Before his own that he can be content  To sacrifice his own to purchase hers  Tho' with the Price of his own Banishment  A hearty Lover wholly doth devote  Himself to make her happy whom he loves  And doth with Might and Main her Good promote  Altho' destructive to his Hopes it proves  He that loves truly loves to that Degree  Whatever Notions Libertines may spread  That he would be content yea joy to see  His Mistress bless some worthier Person's Bed  Nor can  true Love  to Hatred ever turn  Although it never should Acceptance find  But like a Lamp clear to the last would burn  And thereby manifest a noble Mind  Such amorous Motions then conclude we must  How speciously so ever they are deckt  Proceed not from  true Love  but filthy Lust  Which each chaste Breast should study to reject  LOVE's Caveat  IF VIRTUE move  A Man to love  How can he then refuse  If NATURE move  Unless he prove  How knows he what to chuse  For  Vice  's Look  For VIRTUE's took  By many an honest Heart  Who think they're safe  Till felt they have  Her deadly stinging Smart  And then too late  Cry O my Fate  Was ever Grief like mine  I thought my Love  Sprung from above  And that it was divine  But now I find  With Grief of Mind  That from the Earth it came  And that the Fruit  Which thence doth shoot  Is nought but Grief and Shame  Thus honest Men  Are now and then  Deceiv'd by Beauty's Bait  Which makes them chuse  Pleasure  and lose  A far more happy State  Nor can Man be  From Danger free  But as he doth abide  In that which will  That Nature kill  And keeps close to  his Guide    Which if he do  'Twill to him shew  Each Motion's Root and Ground  That in this Day  No Folly may  In ISRAEL be found  Which is the Cry  Of one whose Eye  Hath been too apt to stray  Who could not stand  Did not GOD's Hand  Support him Day by Day  INTEGRITY  IT is not Wealth nor worldly Pelf  Could my Affection take  I am not such a Friend to SELF  To suffer for its Sake  'Tis not the Features of a Face  Could captivate mine Eye  I have seen some of th' sweetest grace  Yet kept my Liberty  What was it then stout Heart I pray  Did thee to Love incline  Canst thou without Presumption say  It was a Pow'r divine  Much I could say did Need require  In Favour of my Love  But I chuse rather to retire  Let it itself approve  A PROSPECT  'TWAS tow'rds the Evening of the Day  When Books lie still and Scholars play  That having got an Hour to spare  I walked out to take the Air  To which the Heavens did invite  With Smiles that promised Delight  My Walk upon a Bank I took  Which was the Margin to a Brook  Whose crystal Streams so small did slide  As if they fear'd to be descry'd  Save that a Pebble here and there  Whisper'd their Flight into mine Ear  Hence I design'd to take a View  Of NATURE in her richest Hue  Nor should I think my Labour lost  To see the like at double Cost  The Birds in various Notes did sing  A Penegyrick to the Spring  Each strove I think to do her best  But  Philomel  excell'd the rest  The Trees serv'd for a shady Screen  Hung round with Canopies of green  And some were here and there imboss'd  With Blossoms at Dame  Nature  's Cost  Which with a gentle Zephyr play'd  And pretty whist'ling Murmurs made  Which Way so e'er I turn'd mine Eye  I saw wellmix'd Variety  The fine wrought Tap'stry of the Field  Did many pretty Landscapes yield  Here  Wheat  there  Barley  did appear  Some in the  Blade  some in the  Ear    The  Pease  in Bloom and  Beans  in Flow'r  Stood waiting for a gentle Show'r  For fear of which in Haste home flies  The Bee with Honeyladen Thighs  The  Meadows  in their Grassgreen Vest  Methought were very neatly drest  Not only neat but richly fraught  With checquer'd Flowers finely wrought  Cowslips  and  Violets  intermixt  And tufted  Daises  cast betwixt  Each Object did affect my Sight  With sweetest innocent Delight  But stay'd I there Oh no my Heart  Cry'd still Give me the better Part  Let me with Him for ever live  That to these Things doth Being give  Exterior Things may please each Sense  And be enjoy'd without Offence  But nothing but a Power divine  Can make their Virtues truly mine  Thy Wisdom therefore so infuse  Into my Heart that I may use  Thy Creatures as they ought to be  And still return the Praise to Thee  To whom the highest Praise is due  O GOD most holy just and true  Upon his dear deceased Friends ISAAC and MARY PENINGTON  SINCE first made  One  as  One  they liv'd together  In Heart and Mind in Flesh and Spirit  One    'Till Death in part this Unity did sever  By taking him and leaving her alone  In silent Grief his Absence to bemoan  He being gone she could not long survive  But daily from his Death began to die  And rather seem'd to be than was alive  Restless till by his Side she came to lie  Her Spirit join'd to his again on high  Thus Death by whom the parting Blow was given  Brought them together again in Earth and Heaven  In Remembrance of my Friend MARY PENINGTON  UPON  September  's eighteenth Day  In sixteen hundred eighty two  Death took a virtuous DAME away  Who of her Equals left but few  She Widow was but now is gone  To SPRINGETT and to PENINGTON  For personal Endowments held  She justly was to few behind  But those wherein she most excell'd  Were the Endowments of the Mind  My Pen I fear would wrong her Worth  Should I attempt to set them forth  I therefore purposely abstain  From seeking Words to speak her Praise  I know 'twould Labour be in vain  Her Fame no Words can higher raise  Let others sing her Worth while I  Honour and love her Memory  EXERCISE  AH me how bitter is this Cup to drink  How do I tremble when on it I think  Surely to fight with  Tigres  or to rouse  Old hungry  Lyons  were less hazardous  Yea I should think I made a happy Change  To meet a  Bear  whom Hunger makes to range  Or to encounter with a  Dragon  fierce  Whose scaly Hide no Sword did ever pierce  But what do I demur still make Delay  Seem yet to doubt whether I should obey  Or Rebel prove let no such tainting Thought  Into my yet untainted Breast be brought  Why stay I Why forbear then to proceed  Success  crowns Acts  Delays  but Danger breed  And  Strength  in Weakness Faithfulness doth find  When  Slothfulness  is often left behind  The bleating Sheep or the Flock's Complaint of their Shepherds  Woe to the Shepherds of  Israel  that do feed themselvesYe feed not the Flockbut with Force and with Cruelty have ruled themTherefore thus faith the  LORD  Behold I am against the Shepherds I will require my Flock at their hand  Ezek xxxiv  IN elder Times e'er  Shepherds  were so great  So ARCH so LORDLY so ambitious grown  Long time before the  Pontificial Seat    Wherewith the World has been so plagu'd was known  Before that Voice was heard which Stories say  Was spoke from Heaven by an Angel's Tongue    Poison is pour'd into the Church this Day    When  Constantine  his great Revenues flung  Amongst the gaping  Shepherds  e'er much Wealth  Had made them proud and lazy long e'er this  While they their  Conventicles  had by Stealth  And glad were when Informers they could miss  How honourable was the  Shepherd's  Trade  In those blest Times how much to be desir'd  When none unto himself Advantage made  O' th' Flock when none to lordly Rule aspir'd  Not seeking theirs but them content to live  And living well thereon 'cause therein blest  Upon the Milk the Sheep did freely give  Thus were the  Shepherds  fed Sheep not opprest  Nor were mean while the fleecy Flock ingrate  But right regardful of their Pastor's Pains  With chearful Hearts they did communicate  Of each good Thing that human Life sustains  In sweet Communion thus they walk'd together  And mutual Comfort in each other had  What was a Grief to one was Grief to either  And what made one rejoice made t'other glad  The  Shepherds  for the Sheep no Pains did spare  But for their Safety labour'd watch'd and pray'd  The Sheep were conscious of the  Shepherds  Care  And unto them a due Observance paid  And both the  Shepherds  and the Sheep did aim  In all they undertook with Heart and Tongue  To magnify the supreme SHEPHERD's Name  To whom both Sheep and  Shepherds  did belong  Thus was it in the Morning of that Day  Which on the  Heathen  World long since did break  And thus it held while simple TRUTH bore Sway  As Stories sacred and prophane do speak  But ah how short a Time that Day did last  How soon eclipsed was that glorious LIGHT  How quickly was its Brightness overcast  And buried in the Grave of dusky Night  Which ne'er to be enough lamented Loss  The Ruin of so excellent a State  By what unhappy Means it came to pass  My Muse will in the following Lines relate  Blest with a peaceful Time the fruitful Flock  Grew num'rous fat and with fair Fleeces clad  After they had sustained many a Shock  From  Wolves Bears Tigres  and from  Dogs  run mad  Enrich'd with Plenty by the bounteous Hand  Of the great SHEPHERD whose indulgent Care  Over His Flock His Treasures did expand  And all good Things did for His Sheep prepare  The grateful Flock of Quiet thus possest  And having now of worldly Wealth good Store  Remember'd with a right regardful Breast  The Sufferings of their Pastors heretofore  With open Hand and with enlarged Heart  Such is the Nature of a bounteous Mind  They to their Pastors did their Wealth impart  Each striving how to leave the Rest behind  None thought he gave enough all studied how  They to their Shepherds might their Love express  Each seem'd to vie which should the Church endow  Most amply with the Goods he did possess  Thus they went on a while but e'er 'twas long  The Glew of Gold to pastoral Fingers stuck  Th' attractive Pow'r of Riches was so strong  It did them from their honest Labours pluck  The  Phrygian  Fabler tells us of a Hen  That one Egg daily added to the Store  Until her Dame her overfed and then  She grew so overfat she laid no more  So did it with these antient  Shepherds  fare  Who while a spare and temp'rate Life they led  Upon their Flock nor Care nor Pains did spare  What Pity 'twas they e'er were overfed  For after that thro' too indulgent Love  And injudicious Zeal the wellfleec'd sheep  Upon their  Shepherds  who had learnt t' improve  Their Bounty did unneeded Riches heap  The  Shepherds  who by that Time were become  Not better but more greedy than before  The more they in superfluous Plenty swam  The more they wanted and still crav'd the more  The Sheep by blind Devotion led still give  In hopes at length the  Shepherds  Mouths to fill  Scarce leaving to themselves whereon to live  And yet the gaping  Shepherds  craved still  At length the  Shepherds  in some grand Offence  Some of the chief Bellweathers having caught  Wrang from them great Endowments on pretence  Large Gifts to them  would expiate the Fau't  By various Arts the wily  Shepherds  get  From the unthinking Sheep still more and more  And what at first was GIFT they now call DEBT  The Sheep must now  pay  what they  gave  before  Fullfed the  Shepherds  quickly idle grew  Betook themselves to a voluptuous Ease  Their due Attendance on the Flock withdrew  And studied chiefly how themselves to please  Then  Discord  rose among them how to part  Their illgot Wealth they could not well agree  Only in this they all were of one Heart  That by them all  the Flock should fleeced be    Themselves they therefore into Cycles cast  Some small some great some low some too too high  And that the Model might the better last  They gave their Plan the Name of HIERARCHY  The higher Orbs the sturdier  Shepherds  take  And thereof as their own themselves possess  Where fair Provisions for themselves they make  Leaving the lower Circles to the less  Those  UnderShepherds  Servants to the rest  Thus left to scramble for what t'others left  Each carved for himself as he thought best  So parting tho' unequally their Theft  To these the  MasterShepherds  did commit  The Flock which was before their common Care  Who fed them once or twice a Week abit  And that too with but dry and feeble Fare  The  MasterShepherds  having thus devolv'd  Upon their Journeymen the working Part  Their Genius wholly to indulge resolv'd  And with soft Pleasures satiate their Heart  For Palaces and lofty Seats they build  Wherein they live in most resplendent State  Supply'd with all things that Delight may yield  To wanton Sense and Nature captivate  Ambition  now prevails to  swilling Pride  And  portly Pomp  they now let loose the Rein  Drawn in their Coach and fix abroad they ride  Attended with a great and splendid Train  Of the  Chiefweathers  these Precedence claim  In State Conventions are above them plac'd  Most of them  Arch  by Nature are by Name  Two always with the Stile of ARCH are grac'd  High Titles they ambitiously affect  Sure Token of foul Arrogance and Pride  And to be call'd  My Lord Your Grace  expect  For which judicious Sheep do them deride  A common Sheep being by Chance in Place  Where he an  Undershepherd  heard e'er while  Saying to one of these  May't please your Grace    Wish'd him  more Grace in Heart  tho'  less in Stile  Yet the bare Name of  Lordship  will not do  They  Lordship  love and will  Dominion  have  O'er both the Sheep and  Undershepherds  too  Who at their  Graces  Hands for Grace must crave  To these the  Undershepherds  Tribute pay  Which doth them in a poor Condition keep  And makes them with a sharper Hunger prey  Upon the harmless and poor helpless Sheep  Wherein the  Mastershepherds  them support  Not only with their Countenance but Pow'r  That by the Assistance of their  Shepherd's Court    They may the Sheep and what they have devour  And they so many Ways have found to pull  Lock after Lock from the deluded Sheep  That they scarce leave the Sheep enough of Wool  Them from the Blasts of  Poverty  to keep  Besides the  gen'ral Tax  they on them lay  Whereby the Flock they Yearly  decimate    For ev'ry little Chear they make them pay  And oft too at unconscionable Rate  A  Ram  and  Ewe  may not with nuptial Rite  Together join but there must present be  Some one of these who to them must recite  The spousal Words for which he  claims a Fee    And when the pregnant  Ewe  her  Lamb  doth yean  The  Shepherd  will  another Taglock  get  By telling them that now the  Ewe  is clean  And may again among the Flock be set  Some certain Rites too must performed be  To give the  Lamb  Admittance to the Fold  For which the Shepherd  claims another Fee    And thus the Sheep both old and young are poll'd  When a Sheep dies the  Shepherd  DIRGE must say  Over the Corps when to the Grave 'tis brought  For which he will be sure to have  his Fee    And  Mortuary  if the Sheep left ought  Thus the poor Sheep the  Shepherds  do oppress  And with Exactions peel on ev'ry hand  Nor can the Sheep expect to find Redress  While they must to th'  Oppressors  Judgment stand  For in the  Shepherds Courts  these Pleas are try'd  If any hardy Sheep to pay refuse  Where  Shepherds  or their  Creatures  still preside  Who serve such Sheep as CHRIST was serv'd by  Jews    For having there contemn'd them right or wrong  They over to the  sec'lar Pow'r  are turn'd  To be in Prison cast amongst a Throng  Of Criminals and in some Countries burn'd  These are the  Courts  from which the Sheep sustain  By  Shepherds  who them cruelly intreat  Such Hardships as enforce them to complain  And vent their Sorrows with a mournful Bleat  Ah who can without Indignation hear  How  Shepherds  do the Sheep in Bondage keep  Who can from shedding Show'rs of Tears forbear  At the Bemoanings of the bleating Sheep  FLORALIA Or an Account of the Rise of MAYGAMES and MAYPOLES  WHEN  Rome  was wholly  Pagan  long before  The VIRGIN's Womb our blessed SAVIOUR bore  There liv'd in  Rome  a most lascivious Dame  A noted Harlot  Flora  was her Name  Who prostituting of herself for Hire  Great Wealth did with great Infamy acquire  This filthy Strumpet when she came to die  Bequeath'd her Treasures to  Rome  's Treasury  For she her  Heir  the  Roman  People made  Of what she got by her venereal Trade  And that her Memory might still abide  Among them by her  Will  she did provide  That on her  Birthday  certain wanton Games  Should celebrated be by  Roman  Dames  Which that they might not for the Charge decline  Part of her Wealth she thereto did assign  So large a Legacy however got  The  Roman  Senate thought deserved not  To be contemn'd Yet that the filthy Stain  Of her lewd Life might not too long remain  A Blemish on them they a Way contrive  The Whore to bury  Flora  keep alive  Her they a  Goddess  feign whom deify'd  They make o'er  Fruits  and  Flowers  to preside  To her they Altars raise and by Decree  Appoint the Rites of her Solemnity  The common People in next Age adore  Her whom their Fathers knew to be a Whore  And drench'd in superstitious Darkness fear  They neither  Flowers  nor  Fruits  should have that Year  If they to keep her  Festivals  forbear  Yet 'cause the better Part did still retain  A Sense how she her  Goddeship  did gain  Such as had due Regard unto their Honour  Would rather venture that than wait upon her  But all the Strumpets of the Town and such  As had of Fame or Modesty not much  Unto her Altars flock'd and danc'd the Round  Some naked some in partycolours Gown  Having their Heads with flow'ry Garlands crown'd  Nor spar'd they  Wine  but in full Bowls did quaff  And at each others antick Gestures laugh  The Rein was quite let loose and they were best  Accounted of could break the rudest Jest  Torches  were us'd to intimate that  Night  Had been the Time of  Flora  's chief Delight  And to denote how lustful she had been  The  Goat  and  Hare  in these her Games were seen  Thus did they Yearly celebrate her Day  Upon the Calends of the Month call'd  May    Thus 'twas while  heath'nish Superstition  reign'd  Before the  Gospel Light  Dominion gain'd  O'er  Pagan Darkness  but when once the Day  Th' illustrious Day of CHRIST broke forth away  These filthy Vapours roll'd The  Gospel Light    From  Christian  Hearts dispell'd this Darkness quite  Nor can the Patrons of these  Maygames  now  Of such lewd Pastimes any Footsteps show  Amongst the antient  Christians  e'en in  Rome    From whence those  Pagan  Rites at first did come  But after that thro' Satan's Wiles ill Men  From  Truth  to  Error  had relaps'd again  After the Power of Godliness was lost  And formal  Christians  of more Form did boast  When Christian  Rome  was three times worse become  In some Respects than had been heathen  Rome    Then to debauch the Nations up were brought  Some  Pagan  Rites condemn'd of old as nought  'Mongst these the  Maygames  with such Variation  As suited best the Humour of each Nation  How in this Island they were us'd of old  Is that which in the next Place shall be told  On  Flora  's Birthday a  long Pole  they raise  In Marketplaces or in parting Ways  A painted  Pole  whereon there hang display'd  Fine Garlands of the choicest Flow'rs made  On Top of which a Weathercock is set  Emblem  of those who do such Sports abet  Unto this  Pole  the looser Class resort  And spend their Time in timemispending Sports  The  Fiddle  or the  Bagpipe  calls them forth  And they come foremost who are of least Worth  Here Old and Young of either Sex do meet  And with obscene Discourse each other greet  About the Tree they in Disorder dance  As Children on their Hobbyhorses prance  Confusedly they intermix in Routs  And drown the  Fiddle  with their deaf'ning Shouts  One breaks a bawdy Jest wherein doth follow  From all the Rabble an applauding Hollow  With Scoffs Derisions Jeers they entertain  Each other and whatever's loose and vain  And who most archly can the  Mimick  play  Is sure for Praise to bear the Bell away  The Liberty which at such Times they use  With Scoffs and Jokes the Passersby t' abuse  Hath pass'd into a  Proverb  that 'tis said  Of such an one they a  meer Maygame made    For in these Revelrouts they countenance  Whatever tends Prophaness to advance  Nor are these dry Feasts  Flora  doth pretend  To guard the  Vine  and Store of  Barley  send  And therefore sure her Votaries will not fail  To steep their Brains that Day in  Wine  or  Ale    In brimful Bowls or Glasses then they bouse  And Healths on bare and bended Knees carouse  The Health they drink perhaps of some great Lord  Who's wellgrown Woods their  Maypole  did afford  Who's Honour doubtless would have risen higher  Had he bestow'd it on the Poor for Fire  Patrons of  Maypoles  if they please may see  The Original of this their Vanity  Yea all the Rise of  Maygames  may behold  Who for them are so strenuous and bold  'Tis  Flora  's Feast a Strumpet void of Shame  The Institution from the  Romans  came  But they were  Heathen  What is that to we  Who boast a nobler Birth a higher Pedigree  Oh  Britons  give your Views a higher Aim  Nor slur with  Pagan  Rites the  Christian  Name  An EPISTLE to a FRIEND  Via recta ad vitam beatam    THOU that a  happy Life

Sensations urge my Voice O lend  Thy sacred Ear my FATHER GOD and FRIEND  Assist the Strain while by Reflection led  I backward view the Years gone o'er my Head  As far as my frail Memory can trace  I find Vestigia's of Thy Love and Grace  Thro' ev'ry Period of my Life I see  Thy saving Providence and Clemency  There's scarce a Day thro' the revolving Year  But I remark some Token of Thy Care  A Sense of which deeply impress'd my Mind  Humbl'd my Heart and made my Soul resign'd  Engag'd me oft to cry on bended Knee  Cant i  Draw me O  GOD  and I'll run after Thee  And should'st Thou deign a  Competence  to give  Thy Laws shall be revered while I live  And when I die admitted to Thy Throne  In endless Praise my Gratitude be shown  But on Thy Mercy still must I confide  For tho' I vow'd yet I have stept aside  Infring'd Thy Laws Thy Statutes disrever'd  And the  first Nature  has too much appear'd  So that I may this fair Confession make  Mat xxvi  The Spirit's willing but the Flesh is weak  Therefore I beg O let Thy Grace subdue  Each erring Passion and my Heart renew  That to my Friends I this Account may give  Like pious PAUL  I'm dead  and yet  I live  And now the Life that

in  Cringes  or in  Sounds    In  Ceremonies  or in  Cut of Coat    Nor in  long Pray'rs  expressed all by Rote  'Tis not perform'd with  tuned Instrument  In costly Domes Houses magnificent  Which strike the Senses and Affections draw  Into a  superstitious lifeless Awe    But unreforms and leaves the Soul as poor  As impotent and filthy as before  No genuine WORSHIP is a nobler Thing  LOVE's its Original and only Spring  It is perform'd  in Spirit  and  in Heart    By th' Ability GOD doth Himself impart  And it consisteth in  a holy living    In  Pray'r  in  Praise  and  true Thanksgiving    The INTERNAL MONITOR  THOU need'st not say with mental Sighs O Man  Who will unfold JEHOVAH's mystick Plan  Who bring the sacred  Pandects  from the Sky  That we may hear and with the Terms comply  Who perch upon the Morning's early Breeze  And waft it to us from beyond the Seas  Or who descend to the unmeasur'd Deep  And fetch it where tremendous Waters sleep  For in thy Heart the WORD's divinely wrote  Indelible and fair without a Blot  Speaks ev'ry Tongue beneath the Cope of Heav'n  Extensive as the LIGHT to All 'tis giv'n  Unto this Oracle Attention give  Obey its Dictates and thy Soul shall live  Nor need'st thou say Wherewith alas shall I  Approach the Great Eternal DEITY  Or how prostrate myself to gain his Eye  Shall I before His awful Presence come  With Yearlingcalves in a full Hecatomb  Will Rams in thousands please from  Bashan  's Soil  Or shall I give ten thousand Rills of Oil  Shall my Firstborn be offer'd as a Toll  The Body's Fruit ransom the guilty Soul  No

JEHOVAH shall I chuse  T' express my Thanks to Thee  What reverential Posture use  Down on my Face or Knee  External Forms may seem devout  Yet no Acceptance find  Nor all the Pomp of Words without  A

dearer still  For LOVE that did my Debts discharge  And brought from Heav'n Thy Will  Shall I O GOD thus highly blest  E'er disobedient prove  Or make  revealed Truths  a Jest  And  Sceptick  Reas'ning love  Shall I prefer a transient Sin  Renounce Thy sacred Laws  And slight Thy holy Checks within  To gain the World's Applause  No rather let my Hand forget  To guide the passive Quill  My Eyes in total Darkness set  My lab'ring Heart stand still  FINIS
