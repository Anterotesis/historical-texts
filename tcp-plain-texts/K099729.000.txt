 PASTORALS After the simple Manner of THEOCRITUS  By Mr  PVRNEY  Theoc  LONDON Printed for J BROWN at the  Black Swan  without  TempleBar  and R BURLEIGH in  AmenCorner  Price One Shilling  ADVERTISEMENT Concerning the LANGUAGE  _MR  Dryden  much admires  Shakespear  's Tempest In that Comedy new PERSONAGES are introduced for whom he thinks the Poet has invented a Language equally uncommon True it is that such is the  recept of a CRITICK in no small repute  Be  Language  says  Quinctilian    alway suited to the  Matter  True it also is that  See  DION HALICARN  who admires him on that Account  Homer  used the most rustick Words drawn from the  Beotians    Virgil  from  Ennius  in his HEROICKS render'd his Language uncommon  Milton    Shakespear    Spencer  and our contemporary  Pastoral Writers  by reviving the antiquated  English  terms by chusing and culling the finest Words of our Glorious ANCESTORS In the Steps of these our Swain has ventur'd to tread and where the Phrase in use was not suited to the softness and simplicity of his CHARACTERS as he is acquainted with the Dialect of most Counties in  England  has from thence drawn the tenderest Expressions as he thought and best adapted to the simplicity of his sentiments Induced I suppose to take these Liberties in Pastoral by what that excellent Judge of Poetry Mr  Addison  has laid down on that Poem How beautiful says he is the old Pastoral BALLAD beginning thus  See  Guardians  N and  RAGER  go vetch tha  Or Cows  Kee or else tha Zun  Will quite be go be vore c'have half a don  And into Language how much finer than the Author's has he turn'd a Thought of  Virgil  And what that hight which girds the Welkin sheen  Where twelve gay Signs in meet array are seen  This great Man adds that by imitating the rusticity of the  Dorick  by the help of the old obsolete  Roman  Language  Virgil  might have attain'd as much of the Air of  Theocritus  as  Phillips  hath that of  Spencer  by using the antiquated ENGLISH  Fewer Oldwords indeed has our present Writer admitted than are found either in  Spencer  or the incomparable  Pastorals  of Mr  Phillips  But in return has often made use of those once introduced As his CHARACTERS are particularly simple and tender much also has he imitated  Spencer  's manner of changing the vulgar dress as 'twere of his Words yet leaving the Main Body so as to be known  Homer  's manner of performing this  Aristotle  shows in the Chap of his  Poesie  He used for    and for      c Virgil  did it by changing ILLI into OLLI and the like  Milton  by altering HERMIT into EREMITE ENTERPRIZE into EMPRIZE  c  And  Spencer  by affixing  y  and  a  before and  en    et    ie  after his Words which gives an inexpressible softness to without hiding the Language  This Liberty every good heroick Writer has taken And well knew  Spencer  that Pastoral still more required it He has given us in his  FairyQueen  a new Language The reason must be because his Scene lyes in a new Place But how much more has he done it in his Pastorals  Among other places in the Preface to her  HOMER  D'acier  and many Frenchmen complain of the penury and stiffness of their Language thro' the want of this And Mr  Addison  observes that the ancient  Romans  did the like Yet must I confess that even among the Pastoral Writers no one but  Theocritus    Spencer  and our present  British  Swains durst ever venture themselves in this Pastoral Path being affraid and unwilling to forgo that Honour which either a refin'd Language or a sublime one procures But then must we add that from thence it is that no Critick but who dares not stir a step without Leadingstrings as  Scaliger    Rapin  c has ever allow'd any else to be Pastoral Writers  But is any One dissatisfied with our rural STILE read he a full Vindication of one much more so such he'll find before  Folio Edition  Spencer  's Pastorals and by his Friend Mr  Harvey  For who knows not  that his Language was equally uncommon in his Day and in  Our  's Our TONGUE receiving no visible Alteration in one hundred Years This appears from  Ben Johnson    Hooker    Our CommonPrayer Book  c  The Reader will observe I here only bring some few  Authorities  The reason that I my self decline laying down any thing concerning the true Pastoral Language is because we shall see I believe a Discourse in a short time on the Nature of this kind of Poetry Where that TENDER in the Language which is agreeable to Pastoral will be considered and distinguish'd from the TENDER which is suitable to the Epick and that which the Tragick Poem requires  Conclude we then with what the Learned  Basil Kennet  says in his Life of  Theocritus  after speaking of his rustick Stile  As for our selves  SAYS HE  the  SCOTCHSONGS  which pass with so much Applause    show    that it is not impossible to revive this old Conduct among Us with Success  POSTSCRIPT  AS for the MORAL and ACTIONS in each of the following  Pastorals  for Action is the only  Unity  to be kept in that Poem they lye obvious to every Eye But as the Pastoral does not paint the CHARACTERS so lively as the tragick or epick Poem those of our Shepherdesses are specified in the  Arguments  And this for the ease of the SOFTSEX whose Favour and Approbation our young SWAIN seems particularly desirous of  ARGUMENT  _CUBBIN  the Writer so call'd was acquainted with  PAPLET  and  SOFLIN  All Young was  PAPLET  and ignorant of Love  SOFLIN  more experienc'd but equally tender and innocent The first eager to be let into the Nature and Manner of Lovers and the other  SEX  The other of a Temper particularly free and inclining These as  CUBBIN  was inform'd were at Evening gone out to a  BUSH  of a sweet and pleasant Scituation to tattle of Love and of  COLLIKIN SOFLIN'S  Lover In pain is  CUBBIN  least the gentle  PAPLET  should fall in Love with him too and goes forth to skulk near the  BUSH  to hear if it indeed was so There does the latter part of their Discourse which alone he hears confirm the hearsay When the gloom of Night draws on they go to bath and cool 'em in  EDEN  Brook There is  PAPLET  solitary and musing and thence ignorant  of her Ail returns alone by Moonshine to the  BUSH  For there  COLLIKIN  that Morn had loll'd with his  LOVE CUBBIN  soon discovers her uneasiness forsakes hit Covert to attempt her relief But endeavouring to divert her thoughts from  COLLIKIN  is chid from her sight So being averse to her Cure she falls intirely in Love  The time in this PIECE is from  Noon

KISS  At Eve did come with YOUNGLING MEY  Ato the Grove where  Lallet  lay  The why he hither came was this  Paplet  he won to take a Kiss  I'll have quoth she a SONG for th' Kiss  Thou sha't quoth he and one for this  So here they came as did befall  To sing elong with NIGHTINGALE  Here Violets ypicketh he  To deck the bosom of the MEY  When lo he hear's a murmuring tone  May seem some Young Lass made her moan  Never will I full well ywis  Give pain agen I've paid for this  Oh if he leaven love ah god  How shall I name a thing so bad  Oh if he leave to love farewell  Farewell for ever ought but Ill  Heav'd the Swain's Breast for pity oft  Unhappy Swain to be so soft  Ached his Heart to hear her smart  Unhappy Swain to have such Heart  Ynethered he creeps anear  Still as a Spirit or as Air  But could not well tell where she lay  'Mongst many a Breer and many a Tree  Which dusk'd in GLOOM Moon's waining Ray  Ah  Lallet  how there can'st thou lay  A Stream half closed a Plat of Grass  And made a sweet a pleasant Place  Here woetheworse as nigh drew he  He saw what made him sad to see  A gentle Lass aneath a BOUGH  Should gentle Lass be laid so low  Twey Lips she had now sooth I say  Like CHERRIES and as soft as they  A dainty Blush on Cheek was too  The prettiest Blush no MEYS blush so  The harmless Shepherd to her sped  And took in Arms the harmless Maid  But oh when took in Arms the Lass  Witness me God how wo he was  And is it then and is't quoth he  Lallet  the gentle  Lall  I see  The dainty Daughter of the GLEN  Help me ye Heavens to speak my Pain  He stroak'd her Locks all wet with Mist  Out Bosom then her Bosom kist  Why sooth 'twas soft as Bird in Bush  He kist so soft and bad not blush  Ysoothing breath'd the sweetlip'd Air  On pretty Paps and waved her Hair  In VEST her Face she wimpled  On tender Bosom hung the Head  Tell me ye gentle STRIPLINGS tell  If suiten Lass so lovely wail  O tell me should she ay or on  Letten the Air her VEST yblow  Her slender VEST the Air so blew  That might see lilly Limbs athro'  Cubbin  was griev'd ye can't think how  To see her soil her Beauty so  Her Beauty fresh gan Bloom and 'ope  Its bashful Bosom to th' DEWDROP  Her pretty Paps like clustring Grapes  Athro' her VEST soft show'd their Shapes  Then did the Swain so fair and fine  Ywipe her Tears out pretty Eyen  Set her more soft and soothing sweet  Ask'd her how could so fair CHEEKS wet  He chears but ah she will no chear  Down drops her Head on Bosom bare  Chiding the gentle NIGHTINGALE  That sang so soft its softest Tale  Then  Paplet  ask'd het this and that  Who gave her grieve Why so she sate  The sloeeyed SWEET ONE noted none  But looked at the waining Moon  Tho' little SPARROW with her was  And soft it sate in Neck of Lass  Sooth in her lilly Face 'twould look  A pretty fliggar when she spoak  See the sweet FON quoth YOUNGLINGMEY  I prethee turn and with it play  Alack the Day quoth  Lallet  fair  The lovely Lad will love elsewhere  And clap'd her Face to th' dewie Grass  The fairest Face that ever was  The sweet Balmbreathing  Paplet  chear'd  Soft as the Song of EVENING BIRD  Then stroaked up the Locks of th' Lass  And spoak her thus as gave a kiss  Paplet  Poor DEAR It gives me pine with pain  To see poor DEAR so wond'rous wain  Ah woaway Come gentle Maid  In  Paplet  's Bosom loll thy Head  Come soft thy careful Case CHILD tell  And can a Lover give such wail  Lallet  Oh had I pained but my self  Instead of him poor harmless ELF  Paplet  See Lass that pretty Springlet fair  Hark how sweet chirp's the GRASSHOPPER  There set we SWEET There may'st thou tell  On softest Flowers thy tender Tale  Lallet  Ah what are Flowers or Spring to me  Oh good how fair my LAD would lay  How loose we lean'd the livelong Day  How wont I with his Bosom play  Her dainty CHEEK with that same Word  From off the Green she pertly rear'd  But as gan think what she had done  Poor HEART down flapped it agen  The dabling DEW fell all emong  Her buding Breasts so fair and young  Her buding Breasts that bloomie grew  Soft shrinked at the dabling DEW  At lenth howe're the tender Twey  Won her to rise from off the LEA  Quoth  Cubbin  Prethee to my COTT  Let's go refresh thee there awhit  Oh no said she I late did pain  The loveliest Lad the sweetest Swain  Not for the World might he not now  To know I'm there be grieved too  But thro' the Grove she trip'd it and  The Shepherd lead her by the Hand  Scene  A  CAVE  in middle of the Wood  The gentle Lad and Lass so fair  Thus soft did sooth for soft they were  His Lips gan bloom with tender Hair  Her Paps ysprouted fresh and fair  At lenth the wailing SWEET ONE they  Bring where she safe and loose might lay  A Cave there is by IDLEHILL  Ye know the Place where Shepherds loll  There  Fauney  often goes I guess  To hear the Lark or toy with Lass  A SWEETBREER dainty o're it spread  That Roses bore and cast a Shade  Abie it ran a Rivolet  Painted with Sky and Flowers so sweet  To this the lillyfinger'd Lass  Soft wailing pointed as did pass  May seem she wish'd to set in th' CAVE  Her Love might thither hap to rove  Thither the Silvershapen Lass  Soft triped it with easy Pace  The SHRUBS afore her sprinkled Dew  As easy Air atween 'em flew  Thro' Boughs the MOONLIGHT fair beseen  Sweet checkered the Grassie Green  Cubbin  went first to make the way  And after trip'd the finelimb MEY  First gan ope Lip the little Lass  The sweetest Lip that ever was  See gentle WAILER See my SWEET  I've crop'd a Rose and Violet  Here let me stick it in thy Breast  She stuck it there and then it kist  Well were quoth  Cubbin  all elong  Laying him soft we had a SONG  Paplet  shall shrill some lovely Lay  And  Paplet  's sweet as  Musk  in  May  Then first the Deweye'd Wailer rear'd  Her hanging Head as quick as Bird  She lack'd 'em sore to sing I weet  Of  Fauney  yet was shamed to say't  Agreed quoth sweetlip'd  Paplet  quick  But thou thy UNDERSONG sha't make  And sure we so shall  Lallet  please  You lye on that side I on this  Paplet  Paplet  Cubbin  's Song to  Lallet  Arise my FAIR ONE come away  Fresh be the Flowers the Groves as gay  Early arise e're LARK gin's sing  We'll see how well the VIOLETS spring  Cubbin  Come FAIR ONE be thou like the Roe  That leaping o're the HILLS doth go  Come down the Gardens to the Grove  We'll hear the TURTLE in his Love  Then  FAUNEY  sang they    what he was    And could such Lad 'ere leave his Lass    Paplet  Fauney  doth rove like airy ROE  Arm'd with a Quiver and a Bow  In every SHADE he soft doth set  And bay's in every STREAMULET  Cubbin  Fauney  's the Joy of every Lass  All meek's his Mind as fair his Face  Fauney  is fresh as EVENINGSKY  With small red Mouth and twinkling Eye  Then soft they sang to shew the Lass    No slight Mishaps made Love the less  Paplet  Once clomb I for MAYBOUGH by hap  Cuddleit  the while abie did trip  He help'd me down and sooth'd me sweet  Shrew

Tale  Sweet as the Breath of NIGHTINGALE  While the fair Wailer lowly laid  And hung adown her pretty Head  Then  Cubbin  took the Hand of th' Lass  And said softsmiling in her Face  I prethee  Lallet  go with me  Why  Fauney  's far enough away  Oh kind my Lad Leave ask quoth she  Or bid go lye on yon wet LEA  Could I have Heart to pain poor ELE▪  And shan't I have to pain my self  She said small thinking how the while  Fauney  was near Soft did he smile  To hear the gentlehearted Lass▪  In VEST she wrapt her lilly Face  Forth crep he soft of lovely Look  Pleas'd as the hunted HART at Brook  Cubbin  and  Paplet  beck'ned first  Then claspt his Arms round  Lallet  's WASTE  So loose her held the rosie Boy  That she not dreamed any nigh  Anon adown her self she threw  And gan to weep and wail anew  Ah God but how she looked then  Is it and is't my gentle SWAIN  Like started Hare she leap'd aloft  Like easy Sleep he seiz'd her soft  Together thro' the WOOD they pass  With eachen Lad his pretty Lass  Merry as Lamkins on the LEA  And well ye know how merry they  So all is well agen then now  Lallet  's as pleas'd as Bird on Bough  Then what remains ye STRIPLINGS now  But that you smile and be so too  More bless'd to make's alone in you  Can ye dislike what LASSES do  Much Wo has had the fairfaced DEAR  Do pity her because she's fair  The End of the Second Pastoral  N B  THE Writer of these Pieces has several of the like by him His Friends were very importunate for their attending these into the World But he thought if he could find Pardon for thrusting two upon the TOWN 'twould be Honour enough Nor had he consented so far▪ but thro' their representing to him that Innocence and Simplicity were here set in an engaging Light And would any one thro' this slight Attempt
