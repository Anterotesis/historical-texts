 THE CAMPAIGN A POEM  THE CAMPAIGN A POEM To His GRACE the DUKE of  MARLBOROUGH  By Mr  ADDISON  Rheni pacator Istri  Omnis in hoc Uno variis discordia cessit  Ordinibus laetatur Eques plauditque Senator  Votaque Patricio certant Plebeia favori  Claud de Laud Stilic  LONDON  Printed for  Jacob Tonson  within  GraysInn Gate  next  GraysInn Lane    THE CAMPAIGN A POEM To His GRACE the DUKE of  MARLBOROUGH  WHile Crouds of Princes Your Deserts proclaim  Proud in their Number to enroll Your Name  While Emperors to You commit their Cause  And  ANNA  'S Praises crown the vast Applause  Accept Great Leader what the Muse indites  That in ambitious Verse records Your Fights  Fir'd and transported with a Theme so new  Ten Thousand Wonders op'ning to my View  Shine forth at once Sieges and Storms appear  And Wars and Conquests fill th'Important Year  Rivers of Blood I see and Hills of Slain  An Iliad rising out of One Campaign  The Haughty  Gaul  beheld with tow'ring Pride  His ancient Bounds enlarg'd on ev'ry Side  Pirene  's lofty Barriers were subdu'd  And in the midst of his wide Empire stood  Ausonia  's States the Victor to restrain  Oppos'd their  Appenines  and  Alpes  in vain  Nor found themselves with strength of Rocks immur'd  Behind their Everlasting Hills secur'd  The rising  Danube  its long Race began  And half its Course through the new Conquests ran  Amaz'd and anxious for her Sov'raign's Fates  Germania  trembled through a Hundred States  Great  Leopold  himself was seis'd with Fear  He gaz'd around but saw no Succour near  He gaz'd and half abandon'd to Despair  His Hopes on Heav'n and Confidence in Pray'r  To BRITTAIN'S QUEEN the Nations turn their Eyes  On Her Resolves the Western World relies  Confiding still amidst its dire Alarms  In  ANNA  'S Councils and in CHURCHILL'S Arms  Thrice Happy BRITTAIN from the Kingdoms rent  To sit the Guardian of the Continent  That sees her Bravest Son advanc'd so high  And flourishing so near her Prince's Eye  Thy Fav'rites grow not up by Fortune's sport  Or from the Crimes or Follies of a Court  On the firm Basis of Desert they rise  From long try'd Faith and Friendship's Holy Ties  Their Sov'raign's welldistinguish'd Smiles they share  Her Ornaments in Peace her Strength in War  The Nation thanks them with a Publick Voice  By Show'rs of Blessings Heav'n approves their Choice  Envy it self is dumb in Wonder lost  And Factions strive who shall applaud 'em most  Soon as soft Vernal Breezes warm the Sky  Brittania  's Colours in the Zephyrs fly  Her Chief already has his March begun  Crossing the Provinces Himself had won  Till the  Moselle  appearing from afar  Retards the Progress of the Moving War  Delightful Stream had Nature bid her fall  In distant Climes far from the perjur'd  Gaul  But now a Purchase to the Sword she lyes  Her Harvests for uncertain Owners rise  Each Vineyard doubtful of its Master grows  And to the Victor's Bowl each Vintage flows  The discontented Shades of slaughter'd Hosts  That wander'd on her Banks her Heroes Ghosts  Hop'd when they saw  Brittania  's Arms appear  The Vengeance due to their great Deaths was near  Our Godlike Leader e'er the Stream he past  The mighty Scheme of all his Labours cast  Forming the Wond'rous Year within his Thought  His Bosom glow'd with Battels yet unfought  The long laborious March he first surveys  And joins the distant  Danube  to the  Maese  Between whose Floods such pathless Forests grow  Such Mountains rise so many Rivers flow  The Toil looks lovely in the Heroes Eyes  And Danger serves but to enhance the Prize  Big with the Fate of  Europe  he renews  His dreadful Course and the proud Foe pursues  Amidst the sultry Gales his Temples beat  Infected by the burning Scorpion's Heat  'Till on the Borders of the  Maine  he finds  Defensive Shadows and refreshing Winds  Our  Brittish  Youth with inborn Freedom bold  Unnumber'd Scenes of Servitude behold  Nations of Slaves with Tyranny debas'd  Their Maker's Image more than half defac'd  Hourly instructed as they urge their Toil  To prize their QUEEN and love their Native Soil  Still to the rising Sun they take their Way  Through Clouds of Dust and gain upon the Day  When now the  Neckar  on its friendly Coast  With cooling Streams revives the fainting Host  That chearfully its Labours pass'd forgets  The Midnight Watches and the Noonday Heats  O'er prostrate Towns and Palaces they pass  Now cover'd o'er with Weeds and hid in Grass  Breathing Revenge whilst Anger and Disdain  Fire ev'ry Breast and boil in ev'ry Vein  Here shatter'd Walls like broken Rocks from far  Rise up in hideous Views the Guilt of War  Whilst here the Vine o'er Hills of Ruin climbs  Industrious to conceal great  Bourbon  's Crimes  At length the Fame of  England  's Heroe drew  Eugenio  to the glorious Interview  Great Souls by Instinct to each other turn  Demand Alliance and in Friendship burn  A sudden Friendship while with stretch'd out Rays  They meet each other mingling Blaze with Blaze  Polish'd in Courts and harden'd in the Field  Renown'd for Conquest and in Council skill'd  Their Courage dwells not in a troubl'd Flood  Of mounting Spirits and fermenting Blood  Lodg'd in the Soul with Virtue overrul'd  Inflam'd by Reason and by Reason cool'd  In Hours of Peace content to be unknown  And only in the Field of Battel shown  To Souls like these in mutual Friendship join'd  Heav'n dares entrust the Cause of Human kind  Brittania  's graceful Sons appear in Arms  Her Harras'd Troops the Heroe's Presence warms  Whilst the high Hills and Rivers all around  With thund'ring Peals of  Brittish  Shouts resound  Doubling their Speed they March with fresh Delight  Eager for Glory and require the Fight  So the stanch Hound the trembling Deer pursues  And smells his Footsteps in the tainted Dews  The tedious Track unrav'ling by degrees  But when the Scent comes warm in ev'ry Breeze  Fir'd at the near Approach he shoots away  On his full Stretch and bears upon his Prey  The March concludes the various Realms are past  Th' Immortal  Schellenberg  appears at last  Like Hills th' aspiring Ramparts rise on high  Like Vallies at their Feet the Trenches lye  Batt'ries on Batt'ries guard each fatal Pass  Threat'ning Destruction Rows of hollow Brass  Tube behind Tube the dreadful Entrance keep  Whilst in their Wombs Ten Thousand Thunders sleep  Great CHURCHILL owns charm'd with the glorious sight  His March o'erpaid by such a promis'd Fight  The Western Sun now shot a feeble Ray  And faintly scatter'd the Remains of Day  Ev'ning approach'd but oh what Hosts of Foes  Were never to behold that Ev'ning close  Thick'ning their Ranks and wedg'd in firm Array  The close compacted  Brittons  win their Way  In vain the Cannon their throng'd War defac't  With Tracks of Death and laid the Battel waste  Still pressing forward to the Fight they broke  Through Flames of Sulphur and a Night of Smoke  'Till slaughter'd Legions fill the Trench below  And bear their fierce Avengers to the Foe  High on the Works the mingling Hosts engage  The Battel kindled into Tenfold Rage  With Show'rs of Bullets and with Storms of Fire  Burns in full Fury Heaps on Heaps expire  Whole Nations trampl'd into Dirt and bruis'd  In one promiscuous Carnage lye confus'd  How many gen'rous  Brittons  meet their Doom  New to the Field and Heroes in the Bloom  Th' Illustrious Youths that left their Native Shore  To March where  Brittons  never march'd before  O Fatal Love of Fame O Glorious Heat  Only Destructive to the Brave and Great  After such Toils o'ercome such Dangers past  Stretch'd on  Bavarian  Ramparts breathe their last  But hold my Muse may no Complaints appear  Nor blot the Day with an ungrateful Tear  While MARLBRÔ lives  Britannia  's Stars dispense  A friendly Light and shine in Innocence  Plunging thro' Seas of Blood his fiery Steed  Where e'er his Friends retire or Foes succeed  Those he supports these drives to sudden Flight  And turns the various Fortune of the Fight  Forbear Great Man Renown'd in Arms forbear  To brave the thickest Terrors of the War  Nor hazard thus confus'd in Crouds of Foes  Britannia  's Safety and the World's Repose  Let Nations anxious for thy Life abate  This Scorn of Danger and Contempt of Fate  Thou liv'st not for thy self thy QUEEN demands  Conquest and Peace from thy Victorious Hands  Kingdoms and Empires in thy Fortune join  And  Europe  's Destiny depends on Thine  At length the longdisputed Pass they gain  By crouded Armies fortify'd in vain  The War breaks in the fierce  Bavarians  yield  And see their Camp with  British  Legions fill'd  So  Belgian  Mounds bear on their shatter'd Sides  The Sea's whole weight encreas'd with swelling Tides  But if the rushing Wave a Passage finds  Enrag'd by watry Moons and warring Winds  The trembling Peasant sees his Country round  Cover'd with Tempests and in Oceans drown'd  The few surviving Foes disperst in Flight  Refuse of Swords and Gleanings of a Fight  In ev'ry russling Wind the Victor hear  And MARLBRÔ'S Form in ev'ry Shadow fear  'Till the dark Cope of Night with kind Embrace  Befriends the Rout and covers their Disgrace  To  Donnawert  with unresisted Force  The gay Victorious Army bends its Course  The Growth of Meadows and the Pride of Fields  Whatever Spoils  Bavaria  's Summer yields  The  Danube  's great Increase  Britannia  shares  The Food of Armies and Support of Wars  With Magazines of Death destructive Balls  And Cannons doom'd to batter  Landau  's Walls  The Victor finds each hidden Cavern stor'd  And turns their Fury on their Guilty Lord  Deluded Prince how is thy Greatness crost  And all the gaudy Dream of Empire lost  That proudly set thee on a fancy'd Throne  And made Imaginary Realms thy own  Thy Troops that now behind the  Danube  join  Shall shortly seek for Shelter from the  Rhine  Nor find it there Surrounded with Alarms  Thou hop'est th' Assistance of the  Gallic  Arms  The  Gallic  Arms in Safety shall advance  And croud thy Standards with the Pow'r of  France  While to console thy Doom th'aspiring  Gaul  Shares thy Destruction and adorns thy Fall  Unbounded Courage and Compassion join'd  Temp'ring each other in the Victor's Mind  Alternately proclaim him Good and Great  And make the Heroe and the Man compleat  Long did he strive th'obdurate Foe to gain  By proffer'd Grace but long he strove in vain  'Till fir'd at length he thinks it vain to spare  His rising Wrath and gives a Loose to War  In Vengeance rous'd the Soldier fills his Hand  With Sword and Fire and ravages the Land  A Thousand Villages to Ashes turns  In crackling Flames a Thousand Harvests burns  To the thick Woods the woolly Flocks retreat  And mixt with bellowing Herds confus'dly bleat  Their trembling Lords the common Shade partake  And Cries of Infants sound in ev'ry Brake  The list'ning Soldier fixt in Sorrow stands  Loth to Obey his Leader's just Commands  The Leader grieves by gen'rous Pity sway'd  To see his just Commands so well obey'd  But now the Trumpet terrible from far  In shriller Clangors animates the War  Confed'rate Drums in fuller Consort beat  And ecchoing Hills the loud Alarm repeat  Gallia  's proud Standards to  Bavaria  's join'd  Unfurl their gilded Lillies in the Wind  The daring Prince his blasted Hopes renews  And while the thick embattled Host he views  Stretcht out in deep Array and dreadful Length  His Heart dilates and glories in his Strength  The fatal Day its mighty Course began  That the griev'd World had long desir'd in vain  States that their New Captivity bemoan'd  Armies of Martyrs that in Exile groan'd  Sighs from the Depth of gloomy Dungeons heard  And Pray'rs in Bitterness of Soul preferr'd  Europe  's loud Cries that Providence assail'd  And  ANNA  'S Ardent Vows at length prevail'd  The Day was come when Heav'n design'd to show  His Care and Conduct of the World below  Behold in awful March and dread Array  The long Extended Squadrons shape their Way  Death in approaching terrible imparts  An anxious Horror to the Bravest Hearts  Yet do their beating Breasts demand the Strife  And Thirst of Glory quells the Love of Life  The  British  Souls low Images disclaim  The Heat of Vengeance and Desire of Fame  O'erlook the Foe advantag'd by his Post  Lessen his Numbers and Contract his Host  Tho' Fens and Floods possest the middle Space  That unprovok'd they would have fear'd to pass  Nor Fens nor Floods can stop  Britannia  's Bands  When Her proud Foe rang'd on their Borders stands  But O my Muse what Numbers wilt thou find  To sing the furious Troops in Battel join'd  Methinks I hear the Drum's tumultuous Sound  The Victor's Shouts and Dying Groans confound  The dreadful Burst of Cannon rend the Skies  And all the Thunder of the Battel rise  'Twas then Great MARLBRÔ'S mighty Soul was prov'd  That in the Shock of Charging Hosts unmov'd  Amidst Confusion Horror and Despair  Examin'd all the Dreadful Scenes of War  In peaceful Thought the Field of Death survey'd  To fainting Squadrons sent the timely Aid  Inspir'd repuls'd Battalions to engage  And taught the doubtful Battel where to rage  So when an Angel by Divine Command  With rising Tempests shakes a guilty Land  Such as of late o'er pale  Britannia  past  Calm and Serene he drives the furious Blast  And pleas'd th' Almighty's Orders to perform  Rides in the Whirlwind and directs the Storm  But see the haughty HousholdTroops advance  The Dread of  Europe  and the Pride of  France  The War's whole Art each private Soldier knows  And with a Gen'ral's Love of Conquest glows  Proudly He Marches on and void of Fear  Laughs at the shaking of the  British  Spear  Vain Insolence with Native Freedom brave  The meanest  Briton  scorns the highest Slave  Contempt and Fury fire their Souls by turns  Each Nation's Glory in each Warrior burns  Each fights as in his Arm th' important Day  And all the Fate of his great Monarch lay  A Thousand glorious Actions that might claim  Triumphant Laurels and Immortal Fame  Confus'd in Crouds of glorious Actions lye  And Troops of Heroes undistinguish'd die  O  Dormer  how can I behold thy Fate  And not the Wonders of thy Youth relate  How can I see the Gay the Brave the Young  Fall in the Cloud of War and lye unsung  In Joys of Conquest he resigns his Breath  And fill'd with  England  's Glory smiles in Death  The Rout begins the  Gallic  Squadrons run  And rush in Crouds to meet the Fate they shun  Thousands of fiery Steeds with Wounds transfix'd  Floating in Gore with their drown'd Masters mixt  Midst Heaps of broken Spears and Standards lye  And in the  Danube  's bloody Whirlpools die  Troops of bold Youths born on the distant  Soan  Or sounding Borders of the Rapid  Rhône  Or where the  Sein  her flow'ry Fields divides  Or where the  Loire  through winding Vineyards glides  In Heaps the Rolling Billows sweep away  And into  Scythian  Seas their bloated Corps convey  From  Bleinheim  's Tow'rs the  Gaul  with wild Affright  Beholds the various Havock of the Fight  His waving Banners that so oft had stood  Planted in Fields of Death and Streams of Blood  So us'd the guarded Enemy to reach  And rise Triumphant in the Fatal Breach  Or pierce the broken Foe's remotest Lines  The hardy Veteran with Tears resigns  Unfortunate  Tallard  Oh who can name  The Pangs of Rage of Sorrow and of Shame  That with mixt Tumult in thy Bosom swell'd  When first thou saw'st thy Bravest Troops repell'd  Thine Only Son pierc'd with a Deadly Wound  Choak'd in his Blood and gasping on the Ground  Thy self in Bondage by the Victor kept  The Chief the Father and the Captive wept  An  English  Muse is touch'd with gen'rous Woe  And in th' unhappy Man forgets the Foe  Greatly Distrest thy loud Complaints forbear  Blame not the Turns of Fate and Chance of War  Give thy Brave Foes their Due nor blush to own  The fatal Field by such great Leaders won  The Field whence fam'd  Eugenio  bore away  Only the Second Honours of the Day  With Floods of Gore that from the Vanquisht fell  The Marshes stagnate and the Rivers swell  Mountains of Slain lye heap'd upon the Ground  Or 'midst the Roarings of the  Danube  drown'd  A Captive Host the Conqueror detains  In painful Bondage and inglorious Chains  Ev'n those who 'scape the Fetters and the Sword  Nor seek the Fortunes of a happier Lord  Their raging King dishonours to compleat  MARLBRÔ'S Great Work and finish the Defeat  From  Memminghen  's high Domes and  Ausburg  's Walls  The distant Battel drives th' insulting  Gauls  Free'd by the Terror of the Victor's Name  The rescu'd States his great Protection claim  Whilst  Ulme  th' Approach of her Deliv'rer waits  And longs to open her obsequious Gates  The Heroe's Breast still swells with great Designs  In ev'ry Thought the tow'ring Genius shines  If to the Foe his dreadful Course he bends  O'er the wide Continent his March extends  If Sieges in his lab'ring Thoughts are form'd  Camps are assaulted and an Army storm'd  If to the Fight his active Soul is bent  The Fate of  Europe  turns on its Event  What distant Land what Region can afford  An Action worthy his Victorious Sword  Where will he next the flying  Gaul  defeat  To make the Series of his Toils compleat  Where the swoln  Rhine  rushing with all its Force  Divides the Hostile Nations in its Course  While Each contracts its Bounds or wider grows  Enlarg'd or straiten'd as the River flows  On  Gallia  's Side a mighty Bulwark stands  That all the wide extended Plain commands  Twice since the War was kindled has it try'd  The Victor's rage and twice has chang'd its Side  As oft whole Armies with the Prize o'erjoy'd  Have the long Summer on its Walls employ'd  Hither our mighty Chief his Arms directs  Hence future Triumphs from the War expects  And tho' the Dogstar had its Course begun  Carries his Arms still nearer to the Sun  Fixt on the glorious Action He forgets  The Change of Seasons and Increase of Heats  No Toils are painful that can Danger show  No Climes unlovely that contain a Foe  The roving  Gaul  to his own Bounds restrain'd  Learns to Encamp within his Native Land  But soon as the Victorious Host he spies  From Hill to Hill from Stream to Stream he flies  Such dire Impressions in his Heart remain  Of MARLBRÔ'S Sword and HOCKSTET'S fatal Plain  In vain  Britannia  's mighty Chief besets  Their shady Coverts and obscure Retreats  They fly the Conqueror's approaching Fame  That bears the Force of Armies in his Name  Austria  's Young Monarch whose Imperial Sway  Sceptres and Thrones are destin'd to obey  Whose boasted Ancestry so high extends  That in the Pagan Gods his Lineage ends  Comes from afar in Gratitude to own  The great Supporter of his Father's Throne  What Tides of Glory to his Bosom ran  Clasp'd in th' Embraces of the Godlike Man  How were his Eyes with pleasing Wonder fixt  To see such Fire with so much Sweetness mixt  Such easie Greatness such a graceful Port  So turn'd and finish'd for the Camp or Court  Achilles  thus was form'd with ev'ry Grace  And  Nireus  shone but in the second Place  Thus the great Father of Almighty  Rome  His Features flusht with an Immortal Bloom  That  Cytherea  's fragrant Breath bestow'd  In all the Charms of his bright Mother glow'd  The Royal Youth by MARLBRÔ'S Presence charm'd  Taught by his Counsels by his Actions warm'd  On  Landau  with redoubl'd Fury falls  Discharges all his Thunder on its Walls  O'er Mines and Caves of Death provokes the Eight  And learns to Conquer in the Hero's sight  The  British  Chief for mighty Toils renown'd  Increas'd in Titles and with Conquests crown'd  To  Belgian  Coasts his tedious March renews  And the long Windings of the  Rhine  pursues  Clearing its Borders from Usurping Foes  And blest by rescu'd Nations as he goes  Treves  fears no more freed from its dire Alarms  And  Traerbach  feels the Terror of his Arms  Seated on Rocks her proud Foundations shake  While MARLBRÔ presses to the dire Attack  Plants all his Batt'ries bids his Cannon roar  And shows how  Landau  might have fall'n before  Scar'd at his near Approach Great  Louis  fears  Vengeance reserv'd for his declining Years  Forgets his Thirst of Universal Sway  And scarce can teach his Subjects to Obey  His Arms he finds on vain Attempts employ'd  Th' Ambitions Projects of his Race destroy'd  The Work of Ages sunk in One Campaign  And Lives of Millions sacrific'd in vain  Such are th' Effects of  ANNA  's Royal Cares  By Her  Britannia  great in Foreign Wars  Ranges through Nations wheresoe'er disjoin'd  Without the wonted Aid of Sea and Wind  By Her th' unfetter'd  Ister  's States are free  And taste the Sweets of  English  Liberty  But who can tell the Joys of those that lye  Within the constant Influence of Her Eye  Whilst in diffusive Show'rs Her Bounties fall  Like Heav'n's Indulgence and descend on All  Secure the Happy succour the Distrest  Make ev'ry Subject Glad and a whole People Blest  Thus would I fain  Britannia  's Wars rehearse  In the smooth Records of a faithful Verse  That if such Numbers can o'er Time prevail  May tell Posterity the wond'rous Tale  When Actions Unadorn'd are faint and weak  Cities and Countries must be taught to speak  Gods may descend in Factions from the Skies  And Rivers from their Oozy Beds arise  Fiction may deck the Truth with spurious Rays  And round the Heroe cast a borrow'd Blaze  MARLBRÔ'S Exploits appear divinely bright  And proudly shine in their own Native Light  Rais'd of themselves their genuin Charms they boast  And those who Paint 'em truest Praise 'em most  FINIS  Books Printed for  Jacob
