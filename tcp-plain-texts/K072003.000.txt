THE THEATRESROYAL IN DRURYLANE COVENTGARDEN and SMOCKALLEY  GENTLEMEN  TO your Censures I commit the following Piece since you are all the proper Judges of my Tryal If I am condemned I shall receive my Sentence without Murmuring and if acquitted with sincere Thanks But as every Offender would find some Pretence to mitigate his Crime I will only put  you in mind that I have march'd under all your Banners in many Winter Colds and Summer Heats and given Proofs of my  Conduct  if not of my Courage and have disciplin'd some of your Troops  Tho' my Enemies have beat me to the Pit  as  Brutus  said yet thank Heaven some few Friends have interpos'd and prevented my falling in There is a Consolation in Innocence that is our best Shield  I am bad at Compliments but I wish you all the Success your Merits deserve Copy the  Roman Roscius  tho' a Heathen while you live and when you die it may be said of you as the noble  Cicero  Every Person may not know that  Marcus Tullius Cicero  and  Roscius  lived in the same Century and were Cotemporaries though the  Orator  was much the younger and was taught all that Energy in his Orations he was so much famed for by  Roscius Tully  survived him many Years He derived his Line from  Tullius Appius  King of the  Volsci  and took his Name from  Cicer  a  Chichpea  or as we call them in  England Vech  by having a Wart on his Forehead which resembled that Pulse These great Men  Cicero  and  Roscius  flourished about the Year of the World Years before the Birth of Christ  said of that celebrated Actor  Quis nostrum tam animo agresti ac duro fuit ut  ROSCII  morte nuper non commoveretur qui cum esset senex mortuus tamen propter excellentem artem ac venustatem videbatur omnino mori non debuisse  Which of us all would be so unpolished and obdurate as not to be sensibly moved with the Death of ROSCIUS Who tho' dying in Old Age yet his excellent Art and sweet Manner of Deportment influenced every one to wish him immortal  With this I end and take Leave to subscribe myself  Your most Obedient Humble and Respectful Servant W R CHETWOOD  THE PREFACE  A PREFACE  is Part of the Habit to a  Book  and no Author can appear fulldress'd without it 'Tis a  Cockade  to an Officer a  Nosegay  to a Lawyer a  Patch  or a  Fan  to a fine Lady or a  Ribband  to her LapDog  If I should tell my Readers I am prevailed upon with great Intreaties from my Friends to publish this Piece I should embark with a Falshood for it is my own Freewill Act and Deed and I would willingly have my Readers believe I publish nought but Truth My Cargo is genuine and I have taken up but little on Credit  If the good Reader should find better Scraps of Rhyme than my own which I presume will not be overdifficult I have given them distinguishing Marks that there may be no Doubts on that Account  The numerous Notes I have squeezed in are meant to divert if I lose my Aim I shall content myself with considering I may be but one among ten thousand that have been mistaken  I have unnumbered Thanks to many in this Kingdom and in particular to a young Gentleman whose Goodnature has been indefatigable in my Interest The other a Gentleman eminent in the  Law who has made my Cause his own It gives me great Concern I am not permitted publicly to own their unbounded Goodness and Generosity since such  Sterling  Friends are but seldom met with by Wretches in Misfortune  I am  Unfortunate  I own but as  Oroonoko  says  not ashamed of being so  I bear all with Patience and Chearfulness which I find has occasion'd the following Flight of Poetry from a Friend I know Authors often write to themselves yet I'll assure you on my Veracity it is not the Case here tho' I must allow a little Vanity in my Composition makes me willing to insert it  Integervitae scelerisquepurus  Hor Ode XXII  SAY fair Content lov'd Goddess say  How shall I find thy soft Retreat  Where shall I seek thy Halcyon Seat  Or trace thy sacred Way  Love pointed out a pleasing Scene  Where nought but Beauty could be found  With Roses and with Myrtles crown'd  And nam'd thee for its Queen  Delusion all a specious Cheat  At my Approach the Roses fade  I found each Fragrance quite decay'd  And curs'd the fond Deceit  At Courts I've sought where Splendor shone  Where Pomp and gilded Cars reside  'Midst endless Hurry endless Pride  But there thou wast unknown  Yet in the Captive's dreary Cell  Lodg'd with a longexperienc'd Sage  With thee thou CHIRON of the  Stage  The Goddess deigns to dwell  Integrity and Truth serene  Have eas'd the Labours of the Breast  And lull'd the peaceful Heart to rest  'Midst Perfidy and Pain  A Soul like thine disrob'd of Guile  In native Innocence elate  Above the keenest Rage of Fate  Can greet IT with a Smile  I would wish with  Horace  Nec turpem senectam  Degere  To pass declining Years without Reproach  But that I find impossible Falshood and Fraud are the Products of the World and grow spontaneous But no more than this I forgive my Enemies and shall ever cherish the Memory of my Friends I must ask Pardon for naming Mr  Barrington  in this Theatre and Miss  Bellamy  in  CoventGarden  the Goodness of them both have often eas'd an aching Heart  A General HISTORY OF THE STAGE  THE STAGE is almost as old as the sacred Inspiration of the Muse admir'd when at  Nurse  and even in its Infant Prattle pleasing Born in  Greece  and nourish'd at  Athens  A merry Author says in a Prologue  Thespis  the first Professor of our Art  At Country Wakes sung Ballads in a Cart  And tho'  Bacchus  is allowed to be the Father yet all Nations  antient  and  modern  esteem'd it to be a  sober  and  instructive  Entertainment  The early Stages were indeed no more than native Turf or Sod and what was first exhibited of a Piece simple Pastoral Songs sometimes mix'd with Scandal or Abuse and may be home Truths like the  Terrae Filius  at  Oxford  or the blazoning  Peccadillos  of two  opponent Members setting up for the same Borough Yet from these Seeds of Satire we owe a  Juvenal Perseus Horace  and  Petronius  and indeed the whole Race of  Heroic Epic Dramatic  and  Pastoral  Poets and Poetry your  Spondees  and  Dactyls  the  Buskin  and  Sock  the  Laurel  and  Bays  From these Turf Stages the Players such as they were mounted a Cart or some such Vehicle and began to travel Bag and Baggage perhaps like the Picture of the Itinerants in  Scarron  's comical Romance Hear what  Horace  says in  Latin  Ignotum Tragicae genus invenisse Camoenae  Dicitur plaustris vexisse Poemata  Thespis  Quae canerent agerentque peruncti faecibus ora  Post hunc personae pallaeque repertor honestae  Aeschylus modicis implevit pulpita tignis  Et docuit magnumquae loqui nitique  Cothurno  But for fear some People may understand as little  Latin  as myself take the Sense in the following  English  Thespis  an early Poet and Player born at  Athens  Thespis  the first that did surprise the Age  With Tragedy ne'er trod a decent Stage  But in a Waggon drove his Plays about  And shew'd mean antick Tricks to please the Rout  His Songs uneven rude in ev'ry Part  His Actors smutted and the Stage a Cart  Next  Aeschylus  a celebrated  Greek  Poet an  Athenian  There are several  Greek  Tragedies of his handed down to us and as  Casaubon  imagines many more lost By some Authors he is suppos'd to have been one of the Performers in his own Dramatic Pieces The learned  Thomas Stanley  Esq  of  Hertfordshire  has publish'd this antient Author in  Latin  with the original  Greek  on one Side illustrated with elaborate Notes in  Folio  Aeschylus  did greater Art express  He built a Stage and taught them how to dress  In decent Motion he his Parts convey'd  And made them look as great as those they play'd  CREECH  The first Theatre in  Athens  was built by the Directions of  Aeschylus  at the public Charge It was a wooden Pile yet very spacious But at the Representation of one of the Tragedies compos'd by  Aeschylus  according to  Suidas  the Building gave way by the monstrous Weight of Spectators and many were kill'd and maim'd To prevent such fatal Accidents for the future the City order'd one more magnificent to be erected intirely built with Stone capable of holding half the Inhabitants without the former Danger Some Authors say of Marble surpassing in Elegance the Temples of their Gods It consisted of two Parts the  Scena  and  Cavea  The  Scena  that Part which form'd the Stage and other Conveniencies belonging to it the upper Part for their  Scenes  and  Machinery  which were generally flat Curtains with all the Variety of Painting let occasionally down to vary the Prospect and manage  the Machinery as  Lee  intimates in the Tragedy of  Oedipus  O that as oft I have at  Athens  seen  The Stage  arise  and the big Clouds  descend  The  Cavea  was the Place where the Spectators were seated The under Part of the Stage was form'd for raising any thing particular for the different Performances where were also placed the brazen Tubes for Thunder and Utensils for Lightning and many other Conveniencies according to  Graevius  With brazen Thunder forked Lightning hurl'd  That blazing stream'd to fright the mimic World  They had also different Thunder for good or bad Omens according to  Athenaeus  Auspicious Omen rends the Womb of Night  And forked Lightning flashes from the Right  And again  IllOmen'd Lightning has the Welkin cleft  And rolling Thunder bellows from the Left  It may well be ask'd by Numbers If these  Theatres  were so large and spacious what sort of  Theatrical  Performers must those distant Ages produce They must either have  Stentrophon  Voices or their Auditors most delicate auricular Faculties No in my Opinion the  Senses of Hearing and Seeing were much the same as now But as to the Voice that indeed doubtless wanted Assistance which to help they had Coverings to the whole Head and Face and over the Face a  Mask  with a Mouth only to strengthen the Sound of the Voice in my poor Opinion wretched Assistance Where were the  Eyes  and Muscles of the Countenance to command implore exult upbraid consent refuse and all those different Passions that agitate the Mind wherein the Eyes are the  Index  These  Masks  were made to cover the Head as was said before adorn'd with Hair proper to the Character the Actor was to represent upon the Stage Madam  Dacier  has given an engrav'd Specimen of several Masks us'd on the  Roman Theatre  in her Translation of  Terence  which she procur'd in an ancient Manuscript of that Author's Works The  Romans  follow'd the  Greeks  in their  Drama  so we may be assured these Helps came from  Athens  to  Rome  But as the Voice was to be modell'd so was the Person therefore the  Cothurnus  or  Buskin  was invented not like our modern  Greek  or  Roman  Buskin but an Elevation of Person half a Yard or so to emulate the Size of Immortals or earthly Giants and Heroes like our waggish Boys appearing upon Stilts But the  Cothurnus  was only made use of in Tragedy to  step stately  for if they had hurry'd they might have been in some Danger of kissing the Ground Neither could they I suppose pay Homage to their Monarch or  their Mistress tho' perhaps in those Days Kneeling was neither a Mark of Submission or Adoration at least among the  Greeks  But thus are their Actors pictur'd out by many Authors  Cornelius Nepos  tells us most of the Performers on the  Grecian  Theatres were the chief of the Nobility Persons of great Learning and Dignity  Poets Orators  and  Historians  even  Kings  did not disdain to appear on the  Athenian  Stage But what is most surprising these monstrous Piles of Buildings were so contriv'd that two of these large Theatres could turn join and form an  Amphitheatre  for the hunting wild Beasts c  Casaubon  in his Description of the Splendor of  Rome  says that  Curio  a  Roman  Knight to entertain the People built two spacious Theatres in such a Manner Back to Back if it may be so term'd first for the  Histriones  Histriones  or Actors took their Name from  Hister  in the  Tuscan  Language a Player  or Actors to perform in the Morning in the Afternoon they were mov'd to meet each other and form one spacious  Amphitheatre  where the Combats of Gladiators and Wild Beasts were perform'd But when we consider the  Greek  and  Roman  Engines of War the  Turres  Turres Mobiles  or moving Towers of the  Greeks  are the same of those of the  Romans  which they copied from them They are used in besieging the Walls of a City generally Foot high and Foot square containing many Rooms in Length and Height capable of holding a large Body of Soldiers with Arms and other Engines Ladders Bridges to throw over the Citywall for the Soldiers to enter the Town and all this mighty Bulk put together in three Hours as  Gronovius  tells us with Wheels that could move it forward or back by Men to shove or draw to press on or retreat some of the Stories fill'd with Archers and Slingers another with Fireballs the rest with Spears and Darts c  and a whole Catalogue of others the Wonder will cease  The  Athenian  Theatre was beyond all doubt the primal and eldest Child of the  Drama  and consequently must have the earliest of the Dramatic Poets and most in Number We have not many more of the  Roman  Dramatic Bards after naming  Seneca  The learned  Seneca  was born at  Cordova  in  Spain  This is not the Stoic Philosopher whom by his moral Writings  Hierome  ranks among the List of sacred Authors tho' both these great Men were born in  Cordova  for Tragedy and  Plautus  Plautus  was born in  Umbria  in the Kingdom of  Naples  Notwithstanding his Reputation as a Comic Poet thro' his extravagant Way of Living he was at last reduced to get his Subsistence by turning a Baker's Handmill A  Memento  for Poets as well as Players  with  Terence  Terence  was born at  Carthage  the Capital of  Africa  that so long contended with the  Roman  Republic He serv'd  Terentius Lucanus  a  Roman  Knight who recommended him to  Scipio  and  Laelius  There are Six of his Comedies left us but most taken from the  Greek  of  Menander  which makes the learned World regret the Loss of that excellent Author  Terence  after his great Success in  Rome  embark'd to visit  Athens  but was suppos'd to perish at Sea for he was never after heard of  for Comedy and this last borrowed from the  Greek  of  Menander  While among the  Grecians  we have this  Menander  Menander  a celebrated  Greek  Comic Poet  Suidas  informs us that he squinted and was an inordinate Lover of the Fair Sex  Plautus  and  Terence  borrow'd as much from this Author as our modern Playwrights from  Corneille Racine Moliere Renard  and many of the  French  Tribe of  Parnassus  But whom has our Immortal  Shakespear  pilfer'd from Why not having the Fear of Heaven before his Eyes he has sacrilegiously stolen from that sacred Goddess Nature in all her Works    Aeschylus Sophocles  Sophocles  was a celebrated Tragic Poet of  Athens  He flourished in the Year of the World before the Birth of  Christ      Euripides  Euripides  wrote Dramatic Pieces Altho' he was twice married he was accounted a Womanhater Various are the Accounts of his Death Some say he was torn to Pieces by Women others by the King of  Macedon  's Dogs He was contemporary with  Sophocles  and  Aristophanes  Aristophanes  was born at  Lindus  in the Island of  Rhodes  He wrote Comedies He was cotemporary with  Socrates  and in one of his Plays ridicules that great Philosopher He flourished in the Year of the World  the first and last for Comedy the other for Tragedy not forgeting  Lycophron  Lycophron  an eminent Tragic Poet born at  Chalcedon  a City of  Bithynia  in  Asia Minor  and now call'd  Chiutale  by the  Turks  in whose Government it now remains  Therefore we may thank  Athens  Athens  was built by  Cecrops  as  Helvicus  informs us a King of  Egypt  in the Year of the World Years before the  Israelites  went out of  Egypt  It was obey'd by Kings till of the World when the Line of Monarchs ended with  Codrus Archons  then were constituted in the Place of Regal Power after the Reign of Kings the Hero  Theseus  being the th of that Number who nam'd the City  Athens  These  Archons  or joint Rulers were nine in Number and were generally Hereditary  Solon  the wise Lawgiver was an  Athenian  and form'd those wholsome Statutes from which they deriv'd their excellent Government See the  English  of the  Greek  of what he said of himself  What Pow'r was fit I did on all bestow  Nor rais'd the Poor too high nor press'd too low  The Rich that rul'd and ev'ry Office bore  Confin'd by Laws they could not press the Poor  Both Parties I secur'd from lawless Might  So none prevailed upon another's Right  Have we better Laws now These  Archons  for Life continued Governors till They were then changed for ten Years Rule only till then it formed a direct Republic and as  Alcibiades  says in the Play of  Timon  of  Athens  One Tyrant is better than four Hundred  Their homebred Jars made them a Prey to the  Macedonians  and afterwards to the  Romans  And tho' famous for War and Arms yet Learning and Art even in their Troubles rais'd them to be the first in the Esteem tho' they wore the Chains of  Rome  which shall introduce the Words of the  Oracle  to the great  Theseus  Hear  Theseus Pitheus  Daughter's Son  Hear what  Jove  for thee has done  In this great City thou hast made  He has as in a Storehouse laid  The settled Periods and fix'd Fates  Of many Cities mighty States  But know thou neither Fear nor Pain  Solicit not thyself in vain  For like a Bladder that does bide  The Fury of the angry Tide  Thou from high Waves unhurt shalt bound  Always toss'd but never drown'd  DUKE  Athens  is now call'd  Atheni  by the  Turks  There are computed  Christians  and  Turks  who command the Town The  Aga  resides in the  Acropolis  or Castle built upon a Rock a Mile in Circumference within it is a  Mosque  that when  Athens  flourish'd was the Temple of  Minerva  built of white Marble Foot in Length and in Breadth and as  Wheeler  says was one of the finest Structures in the World Near it are some of the Remains of the  Theatre  of  Bacchus  The  Area  and the  Stage  are almost fill'd with the ruinous Marble Seats But it is plain to be discover'd that this  Theatre  is much larger than the Temple of  Minerva  and built with white Marble The Temple of the eight Winds some Remains of the  Odeum  or Music Theatre c may be still distinguish'd  for her Schools of Science and  Arts whose flourishing Branches by degrees spread over the now learned World as  Horace  writes in his Epistle to  Augustus Caesar  Graecia  capta ferum victorem cepit artes Intulit agresti  Latio  Greece  conquer'd did her Conquerors o'ercome Polish'd the Rude and sent her Arts to  Rome  The  Socci  is no more than we say in  English Seck  and used in Comedy only For Tragedy with the  Chorus  and Comedy were a long time the  Greek  and  Roman  Entertainments The Chorus might indeed be term'd  Interludes  tho' their Substance were mostly relative to the Story as Thoughts of the foregoing  Subject of the Scene by Standersby or Overhearers Yet these by degrees melted away and  Mimes  or  Pantomimes  were instituted in their room Some of our  English  Authors have their Chorus after the antient Manner  viz Shakespear  in his  Henry  V and  Winter's Tale Milton  in his  Samson Agonistes Sandys  in his  Christ's Passion  and the late Duke of  Buckingham  in his two Tragedies from the  Julius Caesar  of our  Shakespear  and others The  Mimes  and  Pantomimes  crept in and shov'd out these antient Chorus's some were loose and wanton  Mimics  that the  Roman  Luxury too well lik'd others were more decent who by Action and Gesture could describe a Story without speaking in all its Variety of Passions One of these was so excellent that when a foreign Prince came to  Rome  in the Time of  Nero  the Tyrant at his Departure he ask'd no other Favour of the Emperor but that  Mime  whom he had seen perform for this Reason that as he had many barbarous Nations bordering round him of different Speech this Man by his Action could be an excellent Interpreter whose Meaning was so well understood without the Use of Speech  Mimes  and  Pantomimes  are generally the same thing but to translate them Buffoons as  Cooper  in his Dictionary is something too low a Meaning I shall leave the Antients to rest quietly in their Graves  The  Drama  in  England  and all over  Europe  began as meanly as its first Original in  Greece  or  Rome  and our Poetry as crude The first Play at least that has appeared in Print was with this Title  Gammer Gurton  's  Needle  a Comedy acted at  Christ'sCollege Cambridge  Writ by Mr S Master of Arts And an artful Piece it is  Gammer Gurton  has lost her Needle and truly great Hunt is made about it her Boy is sent to blow the Embers in order to light a Candle to help the Search The damn'd Witch of a Cat is got in the Chimney with her two fiery Eyes The Boy cries  It is the Devil of a Fire  for when he puffs it's out and when he does not it's in  Stir it  cries Gammer  Gurton  The Boy does as he's bid The Fire or rather the Cat flies among a Pile of Wood the Boy cries  The House will be burnt  All Hands to work The Cat is discover'd by a Priest having a little more Cunning than the rest This is the  Episode  The main  Plot  and  Catastrophe  are full as good Gammer  Gurton  it seems had the Day before been mending her Man  Hodge  's Breeches Now  Hodge  in some Game of Merriment was to be punish'd by three Slaps on the  Bum  by the brawny open Hand of one of his Fellow Bumpkins His Head is laid down in Gammer  Gurton  's Lap the first Slap is given  Hodge  with great Exclamation bellows out  Oh  He declares his Grief and searching for the Cause of his PainO happy the Needle was found bury'd up to the Eye in the Posterior of poor  Hodge  It was pull'd out with great Rejoicing  by all but the Delinquent who express'd some Pain and so ends this excellent  Comedy  But Time has polish'd this Rudeness and true  English Tragedy  and  Comedy  is allow'd to stand in the utmost Perfection Yet Bunglers will still be dabbling Every polite Nation delights in the  Drama  The heavy  Dutch  have Plays in their own Language but they are generally plann'd from the Old Testament I had a Description of one given me from an  English  Spectator It was the Story of  Abraham  sacrificing his Son  Isaac  But  Abraham  was arm'd with a  Gun  instead of a sacrificing  Knife  The Angel to prevent the Gun from firing sprinkled some warm Water a Distillation of its own making The  Ram  in the Brake which was represented by Boughs of Laurel was a plump fat  Dutchman  marry'd I suppose with fair browspread Antlers on his Head fix'd very artificially and all the Decorations were of a Piece But they have a handsome regular  Theatre  at the  Hague  occupy'd by a  French  Troop of  Comedians  Even the distant  Chinese  have very fine Theatres I saw in my Youth a  Chinese  Performance at  Canton  where the  Scenes Machines  and  Habits  were surprising and magnificent but not understanding the Language  the Glare growing familiar  as  Addison  says by Beauty  Faded on the Eye and pall'd upon the Sense  Du Halde  in his History of  China  has translated  into  French  several of the  Chinese  Dramatic Authors but they seem plann'd mostly alikeA Prince secreted in his Youth by an evil Minister and counterplotted by a good one The Child at last brought from its Obscurity marry'd to a great Princess and begins his happy Reign But these illustrious Ladies have but little to say for themselves no more than the lost Daughters in the  Comedies  of  Terence  found again by the Parents and marry'd to the Son of a Friend  Tavernier  in his Travels to the  EastIndies  informs us that  Theatres  have been many Ages the Diversion of the  Chinese  and more magnificent than those of  Europe  He relates a long Description of them and the more to illustrate that Account gives you the  Plan  and  Picture  of one engrav'd with the  Scenes  and  Machines  The People of  America  had their Theatre according to  Acosta  Acosta  the  Spaniard  that wrote the History of the  WestIndies  before  Cortez  had conquer'd it says the  Amantas  or  Indian  Philosophers were also Poets and invented  Comedies  and  Tragedies  which were acted on their Festivals before the King the Royal Family and the Court the Actors being the Noblemen and great Officers of the Army The Subject of their  Tragedies  were the Victories and great Actions of their Ancestors which seem'd to be the best Means they had of preserving the Memory of what was past In their  Comedies  their Husbandry their Houshold Affairs and Commerce were represented and the most remarkable Follies in Life expos'd The Poets taught them what they had to say not by Writing but by Memory for Orthography was not known among the  Indians  till after the Conquest  According to  Lopez de Vega  the Christian Religion was propagated among the  Americans  by the Theatre Read in his own Words what he writes upon the Subject  Every Part of Gospelhistory is thrown into a Play and the  Indians  are the Actors instructed by the  Jesuits  one acts our  Saviour  another St  Peter  a third  Pontius Pilate  a fourth  Judas  and so on This they look upon as the readiest Way of instructing the vulgar  Indians  in the Christian Religion and to fix the Sacred History of it in their Memories  But what need we travel so far  from Home 'Tis Time to come back to our own Country with this Observation that polite Nations allow the  Theatre  a wise and instructive Amusement Even the Apostles did not disapprove of Plays and no doubt read them for St  Paul  in his First Epistle to the  Corinthians  quotes  Menander  the  Greek  Comic Poet and sets down his own Phrase in his own Words xvth Chapter d Verse  Be not deceiv'dEvil Communication corrupts good Manners  Arts Sciences and even Trade generally flourish with the Theatre and I think  Religion  and Politeness and why may not the  Drama  be a great Mark of a civiliz'd Nation The  Greeks  and  Romans  were in their highest Glory when the  Stage  flourish'd I need not say that the  Theatre  in  England  came in with the Reformation and the longreign'd  Queen Elizabeth  whose great Learning not only made her give it Encouragement but Sir  Roger Naunton  tells us that great Queen translated one of the Tragedies of  Euripides  from the  original  Greek  for her own Amusement Our immortal  Shakespear  met Reward from that illustrious Princess and her Influence brought forth his inimitable Genius to that high Lustre where it will shine unrival'd to after Ages never once clouded but in the Time of Fanaticism and drear Darkness of  Canting  and  Hypocrisy France  was poring in the thick Mist till  Hardy  their first Poet shewed Dramatic Light then all Branches of Learning began to shine and spread their Lustre improv'd their Arts and Arms and warm'd their widespreading Nation to Glory when Conquest waited on their Monarch and Victory cover'd him with Laurels till check'd by the  British  Lion Ambition in great Minds stands rank'd in the Line of Virtue but I think to bound it is more truly a Virtue as sweettongu'd  Waller  writes  If the successful Troublers of Mankind  With Laurel crown'd so great Applause do find  Shall the vex'd World less Honour yield to those  That stop their Progress and their Rage oppose  Next to that Pow'r which does the Ocean awe  Is to set Bounds and give Ambition Law  But let me set Bounds to myself  As the  Stage  flourish'd in the Reign of Queen  Elizabeth  and King  James  the First with such excellent Dramatic Poets  viz Shakespear Ben Johnson Massenger  and many others we may be well assur'd the  Actors  did not fall much  short of the  Writers  Nature is the same in every Age  Taylor Burbidge Lowen Hemmings Condel Allen Mason Field Tarlton  and others that performed in the Plays of  Shakespear Johnson  c have their public Praises in several cotemporary Authors Mr  Marlow  in his Preface to the  Jew  of  Malta  a Play acted before King  Charles  the First and his Queen at  Whitehall  in the Year writes "that Mr  Mason  and Mr  Taylor  perform'd their Parts with that Excellence that it was beyond conceiving" Sir  Richard Baker  in his Chronicles of  England  at the latter End of Queen  Elizabeth  after giving an Account of the eminent Persons in that Reign writes thus of three Actors "Excellency in the meanest Things deserves Remembrance  Richard Burbidge  and  Edward Allen  two such Actors as no Age must ever look to see the like And to make their Comedies complete  Richard Tarlton  for the  Clown's  Part never had his Match nor never will have" What this Writer calls the  Clown's  Part were such as  Launcelot  in the  Merchant of Venice Touchstone  in  As you like it  the Fool in  King Lear  and Parts of the Kind which required Persons of infinite Humour  Mr  Thomas Heywood  was not only an excellent Actor but a very great Author and Dramatic Poet I have read all his Works that are extant and in my poor Judgment he may be accounted the first of the secondrank'd Poets in the Reigns of Queen  Elizabeth  and  King  James  the First I do not think it will displease the Reader to give him a Catalogue of his great Labours    Robert  Earl of  Huntingdon  's Downfal    Robert  Earl of  Huntingdon  's Death These two Pieces are the History of  Robin Hood    The Golden Age      The Silver Age      The Brazen Age      A Woman kill'd with Kindness      If you know not me you know nobody  This is the History of Queen  Elizabeth  with a Print of that great Queen in the Front and the  Spanish  Armada

Edward the Fourth  In Two Parts The late Mr  Bowman  informed me he was very well assured by Mr  Cleveland  a Poet of the last Age this double Play was performed on two succeeding Nights and had a very great Run a Theatrical Term  Several modern Authors have borrow'd from Mr  Heywood  I shall only mention two  Shadwell  in his  Lancashire Witches  and  Fielding  in his  Intriguing ChamberMaid  from the  English Traveller  or rather  Renarde  the  Frenchman  translated it into  French  from the  English  and our  English  Privateer retook it back again Though it is very possible all three might have an Eye upon the  Mostellaria  of  Plautus  But this is sailing a little out of my Latitude Yet we may be very well assured this Poet must be in great Reputation by the Number and Success of his Dramatic Works when  Skakespear  and  Fletcher  were the reigning Monarchs of the Stage not forgetting  Ben Johnson  and  Massenger  And I repeat it here again the Stage Performers must certainly be great in those Times since few of our Poets have outshone those that went before them more especially  Shakespear  and  Johnson  This last had no other  Epitaph  than O RARE BEN JOHNSON and  Burbidge  the Tragedian by way of Estimation  Exit  BURBIDGE Mr  Richard Allen  another great Actor founded and endowed a College  This College was first designed for the Relief and Support of six Men six Women with six Children Persons thro' Indigence Misfortunes or old Age belonging to the Theatres of  London  But when the Building was going forward Mr  Allen  having left off acting he recommended a Doorkeeper to his quondam Brother Actors they absolutely refused him that small Favour which so enraged him that he turned his Bounty another Way Both Parties perhaps to blame but I believe few censured him  out  of the Theatres at that Time He afterwards increased the Number of Children to twelve from the Age of five Years to be taught and maintained till or We may imagine the Founder no very great Friend to Matrimony since he left Directions that the Governor should continue a Batchelor and one of his own Name and to give place to another  Allen  should he once change his Condition The College is a noble Building with a very handsome Chapel the Altarpiece elegantly painted with a wellton'd Organ and it is the Duty of the Organist to teach the Children to sing the proper Services of the Church The decent Decorum is admired by all There is also an elegant PleasureGarden with a useful Orchard and KitchenGarden all wellstock'd with the best Fruits c Fishponds that yield large Quantities of  Carp Tench Perch  and  Eels  And much to the Credit of the Managers of this Charity the original Estate left by the Founder is more than trebled in Value and they have Money in their Treasury ready for another Purchase I shall end this Account with what Sir  Richard Baker  writes in his Chronicle of  England  where he closes the Reign of King  James  the First  About this Time  Edward Allen  of  Dulwich  in  Surry  founded a fair Hospital at  Dulwich  for six poor Men six poor Women and twelve poor Children from the Age of four to six Years to be there maintained and taught till the Age of Fourteen or Sixteen and to have a Schoolmaster with Diet and a convenient Stipend This Man may be an Example who having gotten his Wealth by Stageplaying converted it to this pious Use not without a kind of Reputation to the Society of StagePlayers  at  Dulwich  in  Surry  at his own private Expence  We have had great Generals knowing Admirals worthy Discoverers of new Worlds as well as illustrious Poets in the two last Ages and why may not their cotemporary Theatrical Performers be as great in their Way An Author who wrote about Forty Years past speaks thus of Mr  Betterton  In the Tragedy of  Hamlet  Prince of  Denmark  Mr  Betterton  performed the Part of young  Hamlet  Sir  William Davenant  Sir  William Davenant  was by many supposed the natural Son of  Shakespear  He succeeded  Ben Johnson  as PoetLaureat in and obtained a Patent for a Company of Comedians from King  Charles  and was knighted by that Monarch He was accounted a great Poet in several Branches of that Science His Poem of  Gondibert  is esteemed a noble Poem which he wrote in  France  during his Exile with King  Charles  the Second His Works are printed in Folio which contains Dramatic Pieces besides his Poems with his Head crowned with Laurel The Features seem to resemble the open Countenance of  Shakespear  but the want of a Nose gives an odd Cast to the Face I shall not inquire how he came Noseless yet give you a stale Jest upon the Occasion Sir  William  walking by  TempleBar  a Fishmonger's Boy in watering his Fish upon the Stall besprinkled the  Laureat  who snuffling loudly complained of the Abuse The Master begged the Knight's Pardon and was for chastising his Servant with some Expostulations as well as a Cudgel  Zounds Sir  cry'd the Boy  it's very hard I must be corrected for my Cleanliness the Gentleman blew his Nose upon my Fish and I was washing it off that's all  The Jest pleased Sir  William  so well that he gave him a Piece of Money and went away highly delighted Since I have given you one old Jest upon the Nose of Sir  William  I'll venture to throw in another As he was walking along the  Mews  an importunate Beggarwoman teiz'd him for Charity with often repeating  Heaven bless your Eyesight God preserve your Worship's Eye sightWhy what's the Matter with my Eyesight Woman  reply'd Sir  William I find no Defect there Ah good Sir I wish you never may  return'd the Beggar  for should your Sight ever fail you you must borrow a Nose of your Neighbour to hang your Spectacles on  His Play of the  Law against Lovers  is  Shakespear  's  Measure for Measure  with a very little Alteration and as  little  for the better Sir  William  was the Contriver of painted Scenes in our  English  Theatres as well as one of the first Introducers of singing Operas There is a Work of this Kind whose Title runs thus  The Cruelty of the  Spaniards  in  Peru  expressed by Instrumental and Vocal Music and by Art of Perspective in Scenes at the  CockPit  in  DruryLane  at three in the Afternoon  having seen Mr  Taylor  of the  BlackFriers  Playhouse act this Part who was instructed by the Author  Shakespear  remembred him so well that he taught Mr  Betterton  in every Article which by his exact Performance gained the Actor Esteem and Reputation superlative to all the other Players  This Account makes it plain  Taylor  must be very great in the Part since  Betterton  his Imitator performed it so well And  Betterton  in the Memory of many was  esteemed the greatest Actor of his Time Read what the great  Addison  writes of him who may be allowed a Judge of the Drama as well as the Performers  Such an Actor as Mr  Betterton  ought to be recorded with the same Respect as  Roscius  among the  Romans  The greatest Orator  Tully  has thought fit to quote his Judgment and celebrate his Life  Roscius  was the Example to all that would form themselves into proper and winning Behaviour His Action was so well adapted to the Sentiments he expressed that the Youth of  Rome  thought they wanted only to be virtuous to be as graceful in their Appearance as  Roscius  The Imagination took a lovely Impression of what was great and good and they who never thought of setting up for the Art of Imitation became themselves inimitable Characters There is no human Invention so aptly calculated for the forming a freeborn People as that of a  Theatre Tully  reports that the celebrated  Roscius  used frequently to say the Perfection of an  Actor  is only to become what he is doing I have hardly a Notion that any Performer of Antiquity could surpass the Action of Mr  Betterton  in any of the Occasions in which he has appeared on our Stage The wonderful Agony which he appeared in when he examined the Circumstance of the Handkerchief in the Part of  Othello  the Mixture of Love that intrudes upon his  Mind upon the innocent Answers  Desdemona  makes betrayed in his Gesture such a Variety and Vicissitude of Passion as would admonish a Man to be afraid of his own Heart and perfectly convince him it is to stab it to admit that worst of Daggers  Jealousy  Whoever reads in his Closet this admirable Scene will find that he cannot except he has as warm an Imagination as  Shakespear  himself find any but dry incoherent and broken Sentences But a Reader that has seen  Betterton  act it observes there could not be a Word added that longer Speeches had been unnatural nay impossible in  Othello  's Circumstances Mr  Rymer  the greatest Critic of the Age he lived in in his Dissertation on Tragedy speaks thus on Mr  Hart  The Eyes of the Audience are prepossessed and charmed by his Action before ought of the Poet can approach their Ears and to the most wretched of Characters  Hart  gives a Lustre which dazzles the Sight that the Deformities of the Poet cannot be perceived  Now after the Opinions of two such eminent Judges why may we not suppose there were as great Stage Performers in Times past as the present without lessening the Merit of those that survive If in my simple Judgment I allow the present equal to the past I cannot allow that they exceed them no more perhaps than the next Race of  Theatrical  Performers  will excel many that now grace the Stage Excellency in this Science does not always run in the Blood or like Estates follow hereditary They must be born  Actors  as well as  Poets  and  Painters  Yet there are many Dabblers in all three but alas how few come to Perfection We very rarely see Brothers or Sisters Sons or Daughters or any of the relative Line though they sometimes take up the Calling because one of the Race flourishes in the Theatrical Field succeed in their Attempts A Monarch may give Ribbands Titles of Honour or add to his Peers but no Power but that immortal Goddess  Nature  can form a perfect Actor Yet some even of these forget their Instructress and Faults invade them to sully their Perfections Every Performer on the Stage ought to take Virtue for his Guide Precepts from the Pulpit will not have all their Efficacy from a  Monitor  without  Morals  A Discourse on Sobriety on a  Sunday  would lose something of its Intention from an Orator known to baste the Bottle about all the past  Saturday  Evening till the  Noon of Night  as  Shakespear  says The Blind may hear the Dumb and Deaf see but every Sense must be perfect to instruct and be instructed Performers of both Sexes ought to imitate those virtuous Characters they represent upon the Stage the Dignity of the Theatre then might emulate that of  Athens  'Tis not the Business brings Scandal to the Performers if they will take care to avoid  drawing it upon themselves I have known the Managers of  DruryLane  and many of the rest of the Fraternity meet Regard and even Respect from Persons of the first Rank from their proper Behaviour and I am convinced every one with the like Conduct would meet with the like Treatment from People of Sense and good Breeding but the Twolegg'd Brutes of the Creation will be ever incorrigible A decent Dress will become their Station but Pride ought to be as far distant from them as the licensed Instructors of Divine Institution For if Theatrical Performers are Servants to the Public as an eminent Actor publicly declared they should never attempt to outdress their Masters  Veluti in Speculum behold as in a Glass  the Motto over the Front of  DruryLane  Theatre will serve both Auditors and Actors and I think carries a more instructive Meaning than the other of  Vivitur Ingenio we live by Wit  which only relates to the Stage A bad Painter is seldom copy'd and Excellence is only worth Imitation Dress beyond Station is Pride and Pride very often brings Selfpunishment I have known Fidlers and Dancingmasters wear lac'd Cloaths but they seldom improv'd any thing but the Taylor's Bill and as much laugh'd at as the Baboon I have often seen in a lac'd Coat and a Bagwig in the Parade at  BartholomewFair  Yet I have seen gold Fringe on silk Vests with white silk Stockens worn by the Dancers on the Ropes at  SadlersWells  that have bow'd and scrap'd in that rich Dress picking up Halfpence thrown down by  Coblers  and  LinkBoys  Such Sights put me in mind of the painted Eggs  It is the Custom of the  Muscovites  at  Christmas Easter  and many other stated Festivals to send as a friendly Present to their Acquaintance and Relations painted Eggs generally embellish'd with Flowers curiously drawn Fruits c that are very often so expensive that the Money laid out for the painting of one would purchase a hundred as simple Nature produc'd them and are of no farther Use than to be look'd upon This Custom is kept up chiefly in the Holidays of  Christmas  in Commemoration of the  Eastern  wise Men led by the Star to visit our  Redeemer  in the Manger at  Bethlehem  where they made their Presents to the Divine Infant These Eggs are sometimes eaten in those Days ordained where Flesh is sorbidden but not till the Sun is set or if no Sun appears not till Candlelight  of  Muscovy  they don't relish the better for their Colouring and gaudy Outsides Even  Roscius  among the  Romans  though the Actors did not keep up their Reputations equal to those of  Athens  was mark'd out as a Pattern for the Youth of  Rome  to follow in Decency of Dress and Morals  Tully  says  Cum artifex ejusmodi sit ut solus dignus videatur esse qui in scena spectetur tum vir ejusmodi est ut solus dignus videatur qui eo non accedat    So excellent an Artist that he seem'd the only Person to adorn the Stage and yet in all other respects so complete in every Grace and Virtue that he seem'd the only Person that should not take up with such a Profession  Moral Virtue and a decent Behaviour will gain Esteem from People of every Rank will add Weight to the Characters they represent and even may atone for want of Excellency  Lessons for the Stage may be convey'd in one respect stronger than from the Pulpit if the Audience were attentive as they should be at Church For a Play well wrote and well perform'd where Virtue suffers or meets its just Reward must have strong Force upon the Mind where the Eye is suppos'd to view the very Persons in the real Circumstances of History What then will add to this Imagination Why the Performers to be as blameless as human Nature will allow I remember a virtuous Actress or one reputed so repeating two Lines in King  Lear  at her Exit in the Third Act  Arm'd in my  Virgin Innocence  I'll fly  My Royal Father to relieve or die  receive a Plaudit from the Audience more as a Reward for her reputable Character than perhaps her Acting claim'd when a different  Actress  in the same Part more fam'd for her StagePerformance than the other at the Words  Virgin Innocence  has created a Horselaugh no Reflection on the Audience since a Theatrical Term and the Scene of generous Pity and Compassion at the Close turn'd to Ridicule Here the Audience are disconcerted and the Reality of the Subject before them loses much of its Force with the Imagination  debilitated if not turn'd another Way On the other hand indeed if a Person who acts  Iago  be suspected to wear a Heart that way inclin'd he appears stronger in  that  Character and meets with an Applause that condemns him We may find by these Examples Virtue is of some Use upon the Stage and would be more so if more practis'd To give Instructions to an Actor is a very difficult Task for if much is wanting it is not worth while to give any A rough Diamond may be polish'd but few Pebbles are worth cutting After many Requisites for the Stage bad Action will even cause a good Figure to appear aukward and tho' there may be Rules for Action yet Nature is the best Teacher and if an Actor of good Understanding is truly possessed with his Character the true Action will involuntarily occur I remember Mrs  Porter  to whom Nature had been niggard in Voice and Face so great in many Parts as Lady  Macbeth Alicia  in  Jane Shore Hermione  in the  Distrest Mother  and many Parts of the Kind that her just Action Eloquence of Look and Gesture mov'd Astonishment and yet I have heard her declare she left the Action to the Possession of the Sentiments in the Part she perform'd I have known some tolerable Actors as to Countenance and Elocution that have mortify'd both by the Badness of Action more especially the proper Use of their Hands Had they worn each in a Scarf they had been much more tolerable as it is the most expressive  Part in the Action of the Body so as  Shakespear  says  like an illsheath'd Knife it will most hurt its Master  I think  Quintilian  says all the Parts of the Body assist the Speaker but the Hands speak without a Tongue supplicate threaten call dismiss provoke shew every Passion of the Soul The Hands are the general Language of Mankind and we need no Grammar but Nature to understand it So by their aukward Use upon the Stage we may turn the Serious into Ridicule Mr  Booth  would often regret the want of Opportunity for an Actor to continue in a graceful Attitude which  Nicolini  the  Italian  Singer was so masterly familiar with between the  Retornels  of a Song and other Occasions Yet when Mr  Booth  had the least Opportunity he shew'd he only wanted it I remember in the th Act of  Othello  while he is listening to  Emilia  's speaking to  Desdemona  after she is suppos'd to be strangled he suited his Attitude and Countenance to the Circumstances of the Scene that I have not Art to describe but the treble repeated Applauses of the Audience while he was silent spoke such high Approbation that Miss  Santlow  afterwards Mrs  Booth  us'd to say  She thought the Audience were pleas'd poor  Desdemona  was strangled out of the Way  Of all the various Passions of Grief a manly Sorrow is the most difficult to express And of all the Actors I have ever yet seen I must be pardon'd if I give the Preference to  Mr  Wilks  No Heart that was capable of being touch'd but must have sympathiz'd at his Manner of speaking one Line in the  Orphan  to  Monimia  in the Fifth Act  My fatal Love alas has ruin'd thee  And yet I have heard it spoke when it has given me no more Concern than if a Voice had pierced my Ear with  Kettles or Pots to mend Old Brass to mend  If moving the Passions is a great Art in Acting I think Mr  Wilks  was Master of that Art There was no avoiding feeling  his  Distress in another Line when he performed the Part of the  Royal Merchant  in the  Beggars Bush  a Comedy of  Fletcher  's The Character is noted for beneficent Charity and when his flintyhearted Creditors had just press'd him for Payment  Clause  his old Beadsman tho' his Father in Disguise comes as if to beg his usual Charity when the Merchant replies with such a Tone that sinks into the Soul  Clause  I pray thee leave me for by my Troth I have nothing now to give thee  Comparison is the true Touchstone of Excellence and brighten'd Brass by a false Light might be taken for Gold if not try'd  In the th Act of  Macbeth  when he is told by  Lenox  of the Loss of his Wife and Children his Mixture of Sorrow and manly Grief at  He has no Children Butcher If he had  The Thought of them would sure have stirr'd Remorse  drew Tears from almost every Eye when if he had blubber'd like a Schoolboy whipt the touching Scene would have rais'd Laughter in the place of Grief And yet some particular People will not allow Mr  Wilks  's Excellence to stand in Tragedy If indeed he had attempted the Parts of  Cato Lear Macbeth Henry  the VIIIth  Melantius  and a countless Catalogue of others in the same Class I might have join'd in their Opinion but while there is a  Juba  an  Edgar Macduff Buckingham  and  Amintor  in the same Plays I don't desire to see a better Performer in that Cast of Playing than Mr  Wilks  In  Hamlet  he pleas'd all the Audience and if the best Judges laugh'd at his Parts in Comedy I can't conceive they have shed more Tears since his muchlamented Death at any of the abovementioned Plays I remember a few Years ago a Dispute arose between Two Theatrical Gentlemen upon  this  Stage concerning the Propriety of a particular Speech the one to enforce his Argument told the other he never heard it spoke otherwise on the  English  Stage  Pho  reply'd the other Disputant  that was the old Way of  Acting  A truly great Actor that stood by reply'd  Learn the old Way first and when you are perfect then begin a new one if you can find it out Art may invent Fashions in our Dress but Nature is the same as the Habits of the  Turks  which they have never yet alter'd  The Cloaths of the first  Ottoman  Prince is the Model of the Emperor that now reigns and as the divine  Pope  paints the unalterable Goddess  Unerring Nature still divinely bright  One clear unchang'd and universal Light  Life Force and Beauty must to all impart  At once the Source and End and Test of Art  I have known many Actors with excellent Voices so I have often known common Balladsingers in the Streets with strong Lungs and Voices but for want of a Manner with Judgment murder an excellent Song and yet extort Praise from their Auditors A Sowgelder's Horn will pierce the Ear and alarm all the Dogs in the Parish but I believe most People would rather hear a Trumpet The Voice like an Instrument of Music must be put in Tune and if managed by a skilful Actor whose Mind feels the Passions will send out the proper Tone when a Bungler in Music does but harshly grate upon the Ear But who is ignorant of this If this is the Disease of the Stage where is the Remedy It must certainly be in the Hands of the Manager tho' no very easy Task The Circumstances of a  Theatre very often oblige the Directors to thrust Persons into Characters too weak to support the Weight of them Vanity is blended in most human Compositions and the Stage is seldom free from it therefore when an Actor is once in Possession of a Part Male or Female they think it a very great Hardship to give it up to a better Performer There are a much larger Number of common Soldiers in an Army than commanding Officers and we have some few Instances of a Soldier rising to Preferment by Merit whilst others grow grey with a Musquet upon their Shoulders and yet at some Time or other a Soldier may do the Duty of a Corporal if he is indisposed or out of the Way But that Exigence does not give him a Title to the Post I remember an Actor was taken into the Theatre in  DruryLane  for playing the Part of  Caesar Borgia  in a private Play and when Mr  Booth  was studying the Part he thought it the greatest Oppression as he call'd it that could be thrown upon him Nay after Mr  Booth  had perform'd the Part with universal Applause several successive Nights this Person said nay bound it with an Oath that  Booth did not know how to speak a single Line  Yet this Person was a Man of Sense and Learning But there are more Requisites to make a finish'd Actor Therefore as they do not always judge candidly for themselves it is requisite they should have one of unbyass'd and superior Knowledge to judge for them When such Actors abovemention'd take Parts as they  thrust themselves into for their Benefits as is too often the Case and I think ought not to be allow'd it proves as  Shakespear  says  Like a Player  Bellowing his Passion till he break the Spring  And his rack'd Voice jar to the Audience  There are too many Performers of both Sexes that are fond of choosing capital Parts for their Benefits that sit upon them  Like a Giant's Robe  Upon a dwarfish Thief  And at the same Time excuse themselves from Rehearsals that should prepare them to act with some Decency at least to cultivate their Interest and when they come to perform at Night only take Shame to themselves tho' they oft disconcert others and may truly say  Like a dull Actor now I have forgot  My Part and stop ev'n to a full Disgrace  That's villainous and shews a most pitiful Ambition in the Fool that uses it  SHAK  The noble Gift of Playing well is not given to all that play Yet as in building of Houses there must be provided many Hands even to the carrying the Morter a  Mortercarrier  must be had as well as the rest of the Hands in the Work All are not equal to every Part in the Building no more than every Actor is fit for  every Part If they attempt to wade out of their Depths they are in great Danger of drowning and as our immortal Poet writes  As in a Theatre the Eyes of Men  After a wellgrac'd Actor leaves the Stage  Are idly bent on him that enters next  Will think his Prattle to be tedious  Yet I have known many Persons belonging to a Theatre not eminent in any superior Part never offend through their private Characters in Life A modest Behaviour is commendable in every Station but much more observed in Persons of a public Profession where the Eyes of Thousands are upon them Confidence Pride and Vanity will draw down Contempt and Ridicule from Superiours with Disregard from all  Of all the Causes which conspire to blind  Man's erring Judgment and misguide the Mind  What the weak Heart with strongest Byass rules  Is Pride the neverfailing Vice of Fools  POPE  Humility Affability and Goodnature will claim Regard from all Ranks and if any Stains are thrown upon the Profession such Qualifications will wipe them off Yet I think there are no Spots but what they themselves throw upon it We are apt even in strange Company to out with some Theatrical Quotation that seldom fails of declaring what Business we follow What need a  Taylor  talk of his  Yard  and  Sheers  a  Smith  of his  Forge  or a  Brewer  of his  Grains  Let the  Buskin  and  Sock  be left in the Theatre I know an eminent Actor invited to dine in a mix'd Company of both Sexes of Condition When the Dinner seem'd a little tedious before it made its Entrance a Gentleman one of the Invited starts up and cry'd  Zounds Mr give us the  Ghost  in  Hamlet  by way of Grace  The Master of the House reply'd there was no Meat he could give him was worth one Speech besides  he did not invite Mrto pay for his Dinner that Way It was only in Retaliation for the Supper he gave him the Night before on the Stage where no Cook but himself could dress such a Dish of black Broth  meaning  Othello So by your Rule of Courtesy if I had invited  Fausan  I should have desired him to dance the  Buffoon  before Dinner  This was the Height of Civility to one and a sufficient Rebuke to the other The Fop for he was no less to plead his Excuse told the Company he had been many Times with several Actors who took as much Pleasure to speak Speeches as he to hear them and he did not doubt but they were People of great Judgment for they generally own'd other Performers did not act so well as themselves  Yes  reply'd the Master of the House  Selfpraise is always to be believed yet I have known a Signpainter criticize upon  Raphael Wit will be often entertaining but a small Portion of one's own if we had it is better than a Cartload of other Peoples Yet Quotations  from the  Drama  may shew some Judgment when properly apply'd and not too often The Author of a Comedy call'd  The Play's the Plot  shews the Strolling Players not improperly by their Style  It is something surprising to me that where Vice in every Shape with Folly is expos'd daily to their View Performers on the Stage should have any Faults or at least Art enough to disguise them so well that few should find them out To hide the Passions Nature has sown in the Seeds of the human Race will prevent their Growth and in Time destroy them May we not learn Virtue and avoid Vice by the instructive Lessons of the Drama What premeditated Murderer would not feel Compunction or perhaps Repentance at the Speech of  Torrismond  to the  Queen  in the  Spanish Fryar  when she has given Commission to the Murder of the good  King Sancho  Think timely think on the last dreadful Day  How will you tremble there to stand expos'd  And foremost in the Rank of guilty Ghosts  That must be doom'd for Murder Think on Murder  That Troop is plac'd apart from common Crimes  The Damn'd themselves start wide and shun that Band  As far more black and more forlorn than they  The Queen's Answer  'Tis terrible it shakes it staggers me  I knew this Truth but I repell'd the Thought  Sure there is none but fears a future State  And when the most obdurate swear they do not  Their trembling Hearts belye their boasting Tongues  We may find by this last Speech the former had its desired Effect since the Queen repented her impious Intentions  In  Rule a Wife  we have another upon the crying Sin of  Adultery  which I shall set down as another  Memento  The Duke of  Modena  tries all his Arts to debauch  Margarita  the Wife of  Leon  a Woman of a vicious Inclination who consented to marry  Leon  merely as a Tool that she might indulge her Passions but by the Spirit and Conduct of her Husband was reclaim'd When the Duke by the Appointment of the worthy  Leon  permits their meeting after a ridiculous Fright from a Drunkard in the Cellar which the Duke takes for a Spirit he cries  O I am most miserable  Margarita  the Wife answers  You are indeed  And like a foolish Thing have made yourself so  Could not your own Discretion tell ye Sir  When I was marry'd I was none of yours  Your Eyes were then commanded to look off me  And I now stand in a Circle and secure  Mark me but this and then Sir be most miserable  'Tis Sacrilege to violate a Wedlock  You rob two Temples make yourself twice guilty  You ruin her's and spot her noble Husband's  We might go through the sacred  Decalogue  with the Assistance of those Flowers in the spacious Fields of Poetry  The Stage says the  Female Spectator  by its Institution is the School of Virtue and the Scourge of Vice and when either of these noble Purposes is defeated it is no Wonder that Persons of true Sense and Honour choose to absent themselves and oblige their Families to do so too  So reasonable an Entertainment as the Drama in its Purity must be in some sort a Promoter to Virtue therefore every Manager of a Theatre should make it his Study to exhibit no other Pieces but what aim to that End and by Degrees throw off the looser Drama and constitute in its place those that the wisest and most virtuous need not be asham'd to partake of the innocent Amusement I do not pretend to set up for a Monitor but every Stage Performer would find his Account in reforming the Stage as well as themselves I do not mean this Admonition to any particular Theatre but all in general at Home and Abroad for our Plantations in  America  have been voluntarily visited by some Itinerants  Jamaica  in particular I had an Account from a Gentleman who was possess'd of a large Estate in the Island that a Company in the Year came there and clear'd a large Sum of Money where they might have made moderate Fortunes if they had not been too busy with the Growth of the Country They receiv'd Pistoles the first Night to  the  Beggars Opera  but within the Space of two Months they bury'd their third  Polly  and two of their Men The Gentlemen of the Island for some Time took their Turns upon the Stage to keep up the Diversion but this did not hold long for in two Months more there were but one old Man a Boy and a Woman of the Company left The rest died either with the CountryDistemper  The Country Distempers are the Drygripes and  Tenesmus  which generally ends in a Sanguinary Flux Most Newcomers for want of a proper Regimen fall into it The Drygripes brings a final Dissolution in two Days if no Remedy keeps it back The other Distemper indeed is slower in its Execution and Cure Sir  Hans Sloane  tells us the Badness of the Water contributed to all these Distempers which is brackish near the Seacoasts But swallowing large Draughts of Rum Punch with the fatal Dew that falls in the Night when the Body is carelesly exposed heated with drinking is the chief Cause Place any woollen Garment expos'd to the noxious Vapours of the Night and it will imbibe double its Weight of Dew before Sunrise Those that escape the Seasoning as they term it seldom feel the fatal Effects of it afterwards This is more dangerous on the Seacoasts of the Island the mid Parts are much more salubrious both as to Air and Water  or the common Beverage of the Place the noble Spirit of Rumpunch which is generally fatal to Newcomers The shatter'd Remains with upwards of Pistoles in Bank embark'd for  Carolina  to join another Company at  Charlestown  but were cast away in the Voyage Had the Company been more blest with the Virtue of Sobriety c they might perhaps have liv'd to carry home the Liberality of those generous Islanders  Even the Wicked have some Regard to Virtue are often aw'd by Persons that are reputed to wear that amiable Character Persons on the Stage which is too liable to Insults escape them there unless as in a Crowd of Quarrellers where a Looker on may meet with an accidental Stroke But these Theatrical Squabbles are too often ungenerous from the Audience or I should say from a small Part of the Audience for a Dozen when they are pleas'd to take it into their Heads shall disturb the Whole and disconcert the best Actors in the World Is not this a gross Affront upon the rest What Right have I to rob my Neighbour of his Money and Satisfaction He pays the Price to be entertain'd for two or three Hours and perhaps would be as well contented with a wellacted Play as a Dinner Now if I should come to you Sir be you who you will while you are sat down to your Meal at a Tavern turn the Drawers down Stairs throw your Provision about prevent your eating your Dinner with any Satisfaction I should think you a very goodnatur'd Gentleman if you only thrust me out of your Room because I should imagine I deserv'd worse Treatment  I remember above twenty Years past I was one of the Audience at a new Play Before me sat a SeaOfficer with whom I had some Acquaintance on each Hand of him a Couple of Sparks both prepar'd with their offensive Instruments vulgarly term'd  Catcalls  which they were often tuning before the Play began  The Officer did not take any Notice of them till the Curtain drew up but when they continued their Sowgelder's Music as he unpolitely call'd it he beg'd they would not prevent his hearing the Actors tho' they might not care whether they heard or no but they took little Notice of his civil Request which he repeated again and again to no Purpose But at last one of them condescended to tell him  If he did not like it he might let it alone Why really  reply'd the Sailor  I do not like it and would have you let your Noise alone I have paid my Money to see and hear the Play and your ridiculous Noise not only hinders me but a great many other People that are here I believe with the same Design Now if you prevent us you rob us of our Money and our Time therefore I intreat you as you look like Gentlemen to behave as such  One of them seem'd mollified and put his Whistle in his Pocket but the other was incorrigible The blunt  Tar  made him one Speech more  Sir  said he  I advise you once more to follow the Example of this Gentleman and put up your Pipe  But the  Piper  sneer'd in his Face and clap'd his troublesome Instrument to his Mouth with Cheeks swell'd out like a Trumpeter to give it a redoubled and louder Noise but like the broken Crow of a Cock in a Fright the Squeak was stopt in the Middle by a Blow from the Officer which he gave him with so strong a Will that his Child's Trumpet was struck thro' his Cheek  and his Companion led him out to a Surgeon so that we had more Room and less Noise and not one that saw or heard the Affair but what were well pleased with his Treatment and notwithstanding his great Blustering he never thought it worth his while to call upon the Officer tho' he knew where to find him It is certainly a Mark of Cowardice to insult in public Company or strike a Man who has his Hands bound and yet I have known a poor Actor pelted by Puppies that would run away at the Sight of a StageFoil that has neither Edge or Point  As Cheats to play with those still aim  That do not understand the Game  So Cowards never use their Might  But against those that  must  not fight  Hud  Actors  in  France  meet with Respect I mean if they will endeavour to deserve it which in my Opinion they may easily do and are acceptable in the Company of Rank and Figure in that polite Nation and tho' the Clergy scrupled to give  Moliere  Moliere  the great Comic Poet of  France  was esteem'd an excellent Actor He died in performing the Part of the  Hypochondriac  in a Comedy of his own Writeing call'd  Le Malade Imaginaire  which is Part of a Comedy in  English  call'd the  Motherinlaw  on the th of  February  in his grand Climacteric The Archbishop of  Paris  would not allow his Body to be inhum'd in consecrated Ground which the King being informed of sent for the Archbishop and expostulated with him but he was an obstinate Churchman and would not willingly condescend to his Majesty's Persuasions The King finding him unwilling to comply desired to know how many Feet deep the Holy Ground reach'd The Bishop reply'd  About eight Well  reply'd the King  I find there is no getting the better of your Scruples therefore let his Grave be dug twelve Feet that's four below your consecrated Ground and let them bury him there  The Archbishop was obliged to comply for  Lewis the XIVth  would be obey'd  Moliere  left behind him thirtytwo Dramatic Pieces which are held by the  French  in the highest Esteem A  French  Gentleman in giving me his Opinion of this excellent Author told me  Moliere compos'd    Pieces for the Stage and tho' he had left the World twice that Number of Years all the Dramatic Writers of the  French  Nation had not produced twice as many Comedies equal to his  Most of his Comedies have given a Foundation to our  English  Dramatic Writers but none have met with more Success than the  Miser  and the  MockDoctor  by Mr  Fielding  the Rites of the Church at his Death yet  Lewis the XIVth  often convers'd with him in his Closet as well as in Public  I shall not say much more on this Subject and it may be I have said too much already For I am convinced  Nil sub sole novum  no not even in Fashions for what we receive for new are only the old ones taking their Course over again The Stage is the Epitome of the great World as  Boileau  has said long ago  Le monde à mon avis est comme une Grand Theatre c  The World in my Opinion is a Stage  Where in deceiving others all engage  Hence the discerning Eye can often scan  The Player widely diff'ring from the Man  The Blockhead prating from another's Book  The Scholar apes with supercilious Look  And the sly Knave by putting Virtue on  Deceives the Virtuous till they are undone  'Tis very possible  Boileau  might have  Shakespear  in view in these Lines from that of  Antonio  's Speech in the first Act of the  Merchant  of  Venice  I hold this World but as a World  Gratiano  A Stage where ev'ry Man must play his Part c  The  French  have borrowed from us as well as we have from them  Le Comte d' Essex  is not only plann'd upon  Banks's Earl of Essex  but has many Speeches for several Pages together translated The best modern Tragic Poet  France  has produced since  Corneille  and  Racine  Monsieur  This noted Author about twenty Years past resided in  London  His Acquaintance with the  Laureat  brought him frequently to the Theatre where he confess'd he improved in the  English  Orthography more in a Week than he should otherwise have done by labour'd Study in a Month I furnish'd him every Evening with the Play of the Night which he took with him into the  Orchestre  his accustomed Seat In four or five Months he not only convers'd in elegant  English  but wrote it with exact Propriety In time he wore off the Prejudice he first conceiv'd at the Catastrophe of our  English Tragedy  the Custom of killing upon the Stage never having been introduced on the  French Theatre  till the  Zara  of this Author which he plann'd from  Shakespear's Othello  The last Speech of  Osmin  the Emperor after he has stab'd  Zara  which he ends by killing himself is to the same Purpose with  Othello  's and the same Sentiments His Attempt answer'd his Wish for  Zaire  in  Paris  had above fifty successive crowded Audiences The  French  open'd their Senses to the true Fire of our  English Drama  where they discover'd the Spirit of Liberty and for the first time shew'd that Monarchs had no Right from Heaven to enslave their Subjects and that Godlike Liberty was a Gift from Power Almighty The Freedom of his Pen gave Disgust to People in Power and their Resentment occasioned his Banishment from  Paris  Shortly after he made himself a voluntary Exile where his Wit gains him many Admirers and his good Sense and Wisdom links them in the Lands of Friendship  Voltaire  has in  Oedipus  follow'd  our  English  Play of that Name and ends his third Act with a verbal Translation from  Nat Lee  To you just Gods I make my last Appeal  Or clear my Virtues or my Crimes reveal c  His  Zaire  looks after  Othello  in its Jealousy and all the rest of his Plays seem to be of  English  Extraction  Now let us leave  Greece Rome France Britain  and the rest of the World and retire to this Kingdom where no Snake in the Grass will rise to bite the unwary Traveller no Blindworm or  Adder to hiss us into Fears Viper or Toad to molest our Eyes or noisome Spider to spread her Venom which according to some of the antient  Irish  Bards were banish'd the Island many Ages before St  Patric  The  Irish  History informs us that Prince  Gadelus  I think of the  Milesian  Race in his Travels visited  Pharaoh  King of  Egypt  fell in Love with  Scota  the King's Daughter and married her This  Gadelus  or  Gadel  for the Royal Records of  Tarah  call him by both Names as I am informed in  Egypt  was stung by a  Serpent  as he lay asleep and was healed by the Prophet  Moses  The  Irish  is thus elegantly translated by a native Bard  The hissing Serpent eager for his Prey  Ascends the Couch where sleeping  Gadel  lay  In winding Mazes there himself he roll'd  And leap'd upon him with a dreadful Fold  And sheek his forked Tongue and then around  His Neck he twists and gave a deadly Wound  The subtle Poison spreads thro' ev'ry Vein  No Art no Juice of Herbs can ease the Pain  Till  Moses  with his neverfailing Wand  Touch'd the raw Wound which heal'd at his Command  When  Gadelus  with his Wife  Scota  from this Princess  Ireland  was first call'd  Scota  and his Followers were leaving  Egypt  to settle some new Colony the following Prophecy was declar'd by  Moses  translated by the same elegant Hand  The Holy Prophet was inspir'd to see  Into Events of dark Futurity  And said For thee young Prince has Heav'n in store  Blessings that Mortals ne'er enjoy'd before  For wheresoe'er the Royal Line shall come  Fruitful shall be their Land and safe their Home  No poisonous Snake or Serpent shall deface  The Beauty of thy Fields or taint thy Grass  No noisome Reptile with invenom'd Teeth  Shall ever swell that Land or be the Cause of Death  But Innocence and Arts shall flourish there  And Learning in its lovely Shapes appear  The Poets there shall in their Songs proclaim  Thy glorious Acts and neverdying Name  Our  English  Historians mention the Bards of antient  Britain  but we cannot find any of their Productions extant when we are assured there are many  Irish  Historians and Poets still to be found in  Ireland  as well as  England  more especially in the Library of the Duke of  Chandos  preserved even from the Depredations of the  Danes  Destroyers that were utter Enemies to Science and Learning    This Kingdom of  Ireland  is one of the last in  Europe  where established  Theatres  were erected yet I am assur'd one of the first whose Bards or Poets have celebrated in Verse the illustrious Actions of their Monarchs nor any Nation in the World where Poetry and Poets were in such high Esteem Every antient and noble Family had one in their Houshold and their Kings their  Poet Laureats  as we have in  England  but long long before the  English  invaded  Ireland  The Poets had their Seats in their great assembled Triennial Councils which you may find by the following Lines translated from the original  Irish  by the same Hand  Once in three Years the great Convention sat  And for the public Happiness debate  The King was seated on a Royal Throne  And on his Face majestic Greatness shone  A Monarch for heroic Deeds design'd  For noble Acts become a noble Mind  Around him summon'd by his strict Command  The Peers the Priests and Commons of the Land  The  Bards  or  POETS  are indulg'd a Place  And Men of Learning the Assembly grace  Here Love and Union ev'ry Look confess'd  And Joy and Friendship beat in ev'ry Breast  Justice by nothing biass'd or inclin'd  Is deaf to Pity to Temptation blind  For here with stern and steddy Rule she sways  And flagrant Crimes with certain Vengeance pays  Tho' just yet so indulgently severe  Like Heav'n she pities those she cannot spare  A few Lines more of the same Author and same Translator will tell you the  Poet Laureat  's Business at Court for he was one of the ten Officers that attended the Kings of  Ireland  A Poet to applaud or boldly blame  And justly to give Infamy or Fame  For without him the freshest Laurels fade  And Vice to dark Oblivion is betray'd  By these Lines we may gather that their Poets were their  Historians  and it may be suppos'd if they had thought of the Drama we might have had some elegant Tragedies handed down to us But to proceed  Mr  Ogilby  the Master of the Revels in this  Kingdom who had it from proper Authority inform'd Mr  Ashbury  that Plays had been often acted in the Castle of  Dublin  when  Blount  Lord  Mountjoy  was LordLieutenant here in the latter End of the Reign of Queen  Elizabeth  And Mr  Ashbury  saw a Bill  for Wax Tapers dated the    th Day of  September Queen  Elizabeth  's Birthday  for the Play of  The Play of  Gorboduc  was written by the Right Honourable  Thomas Sackville  Lord  Buckhurst  afterwards created Earl of  Dorset  in the first Year of King  James  the First's Reign This Dramatic Piece was accounted the best of its Kind at the Time it was wrote it was first published under the Title of  Ferrex  and  Porrex  in and reprinted under the Title of  Gorboduc  This was a favourite Play of Queen  Elizabeth  's as may be supposed by her seeing it twice acted first by the Gentlemen of the  InnerTemple  and afterwards by the Children of her Majesty's Revels Mr  Spence  Professor of Poetry in the University of  Oxford  has reprinted this Play about nine Years ago and dedicated it to the Earl of  Middlesex  Son to his Grace the Duke of  Dorset  descended from this Author  Gorboduc  done at the Castle oneandtwenty Shillings and two Groats  But it is to be supposed they were Gentlemen of the Court that were the Actors on this Occasion  I cannot find any established Theatre in  Dublin  till the Year when the Earl of  Strafford  was LordLieutenant of this Kingdom in the tenth Year of the Reign of King  Charles  the First  John Ogilby  Esq  then Master of the Revels under the Title of Historiographer to his Majesty and Master of the Revels in the  Kingdom of  Ireland  and I believe the first that wore the last Title This Theatre was built by his Directions in  WarbergStreet  where the Company continued to act till the unhappy Rebellion broke out in the Year  Henry Burnel  Esq  a Gentleman of  Ireland  wrote a Play call'd  Landgartha  a TragiComedy acted at the New  Theatre  in  Dublin  with very great Applause so says the Title but there are no Actors Names printed in the  Drama  The Prologue was spoken by an  Amazon  arm'd with a Battleax to bespeak the Favour of the Audience The Plot is taken from the  Danish  History of  Saxo Grammaticus  This Play was the last that was performed on the Theatre in  Warbergstreet  before the Rebellion broke out which was discovered by Mr  Owen O Connolly  but the Night before the Execution which prevented the City of  Dublin  being seiz'd on the d of  October  as intended but it was too late to give Notice to the rest of the Kingdom which felt the fatal Effect of the Rebellion  The Theatre was then shut up by Order of the Lords Justices sign'd  William Parsons  and  John Borlace  We do not find any mention of a  Theatre  in  Dublin  till the Year after the Restoration which was built on the Spot where the Theatre now stands in  Orangestreet  commonly call'd  Smockalley  how it came by the last Name may be easily guess'd  We find in the Year  Pompey  a Tragedy acted at the  Theatre  in  Dublin  translated from the  French  of  Corneille  It is wrote in Verse by Mrs  Catharine Phillips  the fam'd  Orinda  term'd by her cotemporary Poets the  English Sappho  This Lady wrote another Play call'd  Horace  taken from the same  French  Author  but neither of them play'd in  England  till after her Death which fell out in the Year in the st Year of her Age of the SmallPox From this we may gather that she resided in  Ireland  since both her Plays were acted in this Kingdom some Years before they were perform'd in  England  The Theatre in  SmockAlley  was so badly built that in the Year some Part of it sell down when two were kill'd and several sorely maimed We can give little Account of the Theatre here from this Time till after the  Revolution  all that can be given will be noted in the Life of  Joseph Ashbury  Esq  Playing was discontinued during the Troubles between King  William  and  James  the Second but when quiet Peace was restored the  Theatre  opened again with  Othello  Moor of  Venice  the Part of  Othello  by Mr  Wilks  See more of this in the Memoirs of that excellent Player This Play was acted by Officers mostly about the Castle Mr  Ashbury Iago  only for the Company was not form'd till three Months after when they began again with  Othello  which was on  March  the Day of proclaiming the End of the  Irish  War The Company play'd on with Success many Years and I find by the Cast of Sir  George Etheridge  's three Comedies there has not been a better in all its Branches since which I shall set down in proper Order that the Reader may judge for himself The Cast of these three Plays I

Wilks  that Mrs  Knightly  Mrs  Hook  and Mrs  Smith  were very good Actresses in their different Parts Mrs  Ashbury  is taken Notice of in the Memoirs of her Husband I will put down the Cast of three

Trapes  in the  Beggar's Opera  Arabella by Mrs Ashbury  Ruth by Mrs Thurmond  Mrs Chat by Miss Schoolding  Distinguished Characters in Bills were not in Fashion at the Time these Plays were perform'd they were printed in Order according to the Drama as they stood not regarding the Merit of the Actor As for Example in  Macbeth Duncan  King of  Scotland  appear'd first in the Bill tho' acted by an insignificant Person and so every other Actor appear'd according to his Dramatic Dignity all of the samesiz'd Letter But latterly I can assure my Readers I have found it a difficult Task to please some  Ladies  as well as  Gentlemen  because I could not find Letters large enough to please them and some were so very fond of Elbowroom that they would have shoved every body out but themselves as if one Person was to do all and have the Merit of all like Generals of an Army such a Victory was gained by such a King and such a Prince while the other Officers and Soldiers are forgot But as  Trim  tells us in the  Funeral  or  Grief Alamode    of such Rascals as these will make an  Alexander I shall leave this last Quarter of a Hundred of Years to the Memory of others that I may the sooner come to the Conclusion of my little  History  and fall upon the  Memoirs  I have told you the first Theatre was built in and the old  SmockAlley  House in and now I shall proceed to the rest as they stand at present  In the Year a Theatrical Booth was erected by Mrs  Violante  an  Italian  Lady celebrated for Strength and Agility a Qualification  that does not render the FairSex the least more amiable the Strength of the Limbs which these Sort of Undertakers expose in my Opinion is shockingly indecent but hers were masculinely indelicate and were of a Piece with the Features of her Face I am informed the shewing her Limbs did not meet with the Success in this Kingdom as she had found in her elder Sister  England  that Lady's Children delight in such Entertainments Bullbaiting Boxing Beargarden and Prizefighting will draw to them all Ranks of People from the Peer to the Pedlar Our late  English  Gladiator Mr  Figg  of Cuttingslashing Memory made much private Emolument by his public Valour more especially in Linen  Mr  Figg  informed me once that he had not bought a Shirt for more than twenty Years but had sold some Dozens It was his Method when he fought in his Amphitheatre his Stage bearing that superb Title he sent round to a select Number of his Scholars to borrow a Shirt for the ensuing Combat and seldom failed of half a dozen of superfine Holland from his prime Pupils most of the young Nobility and Gentry made it Part of their Education to march under his warlike Banner This Champion was generally Conqueror tho' his Shirt seldom failed of gaining a Cut from his Enemy and sometimes his Flesh tho' I think he never receiv'd any dangerous Wound Most of his Scholars were at every Battle and were sure to exult at their great Master's Victories every Person supposing he saw the Wounds his Shirt received Mr  Figg  took his Opportunity to inform his Lenders of Linen of the Chasms their Shirts received with a Promise to send them home  But  said the ingenious courageous  Figg I seldom received any other Answer than Damn you keep it  I shall not enter into the Merits of this Method in procuring Linen but if it was a Fraud as he told me he was never found Guilty For as  Hudibras  says  For those that meddle with his Tools  Will cut their Fingers if they're Fools    But to Mademoiselle  Violante  She finding her Tumbling tiresome fell into Playing and  Pantomime  another Disgrace to the Drama Mr  Barrington  Mr  John Morris  and I think Mr  Beamsly  Miss  Woffington  Miss  Mackay  now Mrs  Mitchel  and many others came under her Directions and play'd several Dramatic Pieces with Grotesque Entertainments till stopt by the Lord Mayor of the City of  Dublin  Mrs  Violante  having no Sanction or proper Authority to exhibit such Entertainments The  It is now an Hospital for indigent  Lyingin Women  which is a generous virtuous and humane Charity worthy the Imitation of every civilized Nation The Director and Inventor of this useful Institution ought to be mentioned with great Respect How many Subjects have been lost for want of such a noble Charity The Hospital was opened in  March  and by the First of  November  there were poor Women safely delivered of Boys and Girls Women bearing Twins the eminent Dr  Mosse  the first Promoter of this charitable Work giving Attendance without Fee or Reward I wish  Iberia  's Elder Sister would follow the Example 'Tis true there are such in  China  but not under such Regulation the Women there are not receiv'd till the Pangs of Childbirth attack them according to  Mendez Pinto  and several Mothers with their Infants perish before they can be conveyed to the Hospital In  Paris  there is one of this Kind but the Women after the Month if able are obliged to attend those that lie in and cannot be free of the Place till their Turn comes on which must be one Month at least For as I am informed they are Nurses to each other  Rome  that has Hospitals almost without Number has none such tho' they have one for repenting Courtezans Altho' the Hospitals in  Amsterdam  maintain Souls of both Sexes yet I cannot find one that is appropriated to this Use  Place is put to another Use  I shall take Leave of  Violante  and her Postures and give it as my own Opinion that I think such Diversions are below the Dignity of the Stage or Humanity Where can be the Satisfaction when Death and Danger attend it I have the Fate of Lady  Isabella  The Lady  Isabella  was born in  Italy  sprung from a noble Family in the City of  Florence  She was put into a Nunnery at twelve Years of Age in order to take the Veil but a Posturemaster unluckily came to that City gained her Affections and found Means to carry her off and marry'd her instructed her in his unseemly dangerous Employment if we may call it so and brought her to  England  where Lady  Isabella  was greatly admir'd for her Postures and Feats of Activity The last and fatal Time of her Performance she was eight Months gone with Child but the covetous Husband loved Money so well as it is reported that he would not allow her the necessary Repose required in her Condition so that in one of her Dances on a slack Rope she fell on the Stage where the Mother and Infant newly born with the Force of the Fall expired in a Moment fatal Catastrophe in the Twentyfirst Year of her Age This was the running Account of the poor Lady  Isabella  after her Death whose End was much lamented For notwithstanding her disreputable Employment she was esteemed as a Woman of strict Virtue  ever present to my Memory at the mentioning of such dangerous Entertainments I should have told my Reader that Mrs  Violante  had let her  Booth  to Mr  Luke Sparks  Mr  John Barrington  Miss  Mackay  now Mrs  Mitchel  for three Pounds  per  Week The three mentioned Persons being all very young fell desperately in Love with the  Dramatic Poets  and were resolved to marry them with their Poetical Fortune that is without a Rag to cover their Nakedness or rather nothing but Rags for their Scenes had shewed their best Days However Cloaths were borrowed some from Friends and some to be paid for and they began with a Comedy of  Farquhar  's call'd  The Inconstant  or  The Way to win him  the three chief Parts being performed by the three adventurous Undertakers  viz  Young Mirabel by Mr Sparks  Duretete by Mr Barrington  Bisarre by Miss Mackay  Mr  Sparks  as having played before in a Country Company was the  Manager  The Play was performed much better than was expected and their Company soon became more numerous being join'd by others that look'd more to  Profit  than  Pleasure  for these three  Lovers of the Drama could play Heroes and Heroines without eating Love for the Sublime was enough for them However other People did not relish this Cameleon Diet and hunger'd after something more substantial therefore resolved upon Benefits and gave the first to Miss  Mackay  in order to break the Ice The  Fop's Fortune  was the Play and she then being a young promising Actress several Ladies of the first Rank espous'd her Cause and brought upwards of Forty Pounds to her Benefit They might well say with the Herald in the  Rehearsal  They had not seen so much the Lord knows when  The Success of this Benefit alarmed the  Old Smockalley House  who applying to the  Lord Mayor  he sent Orders to forbid their Acting and it was with much Difficulty they had Leave to play one more which was  Woman's a Riddle  to a good House  And that the last  This was the Spring from whence  Ransfordstreet  arose out of the Power of the  Lord Mayor  of  Dublin  Ransfordstreet Theatre  was built and opened for the first Time under a Licence granted by the Right Honourable the Earl of  Meath  I saw a Licence granted by that worthy Nobleman to the late Mr  Thomas Walker  Comedian for Forty Pounds  per Annum  which Sum was meant to be given to the Poor in the Earl of  Meath  's Liberty A pious Example    being Part of his Liberties The first Play that was performed there was a Comedy call'd  LOVE for LOVE  The Company being under the Directions of Mr  Husband    Sir Sampson by Mr Moore  Since dead  Valentine by Mr Husband  Tattle by Mr Ravenscroft  Since dead  Foresight by Mr Bourne  Now in  England  Ben by Mr Sparks  Trapland by Mr Daniel  Jeremy by Mr Roch  Angelica by Mrs Ravenscroft  Dead  Mrs Foresight by Mrs Smith  Dead  Mrs Frail by Miss Mackay  Now Mrs  Mitchel  Miss Prue by Miss Barnes  Now Mrs  Martin  Nurse by Mrs Talent  Lives at  Corke  I never saw this  Theatre  but have been inform'd it was a very neat compact Building capable of containing an hundred Pounds at common Prices which they never raised but at Benefits  The Company performed here above a Year with tolerable Success sometimes Neap and sometimes Springtides but when  Henry  the Eighth with the pompous Coronation was exhibited at the Theatre in  Aungierstreet  they were almost forsaken good Sense with Shew for once prevailed which is not always the Case  As Poverty is the Mother of Invention all the Wit of the Company went to work and at last produced a  Mock  Coronation with less Expence than a Lady's Tail at  Aungierstreet Theatre  It was called the  Beggars Coronation  and not unworthy that Title in the Play of  The Royal Merchant  or  The Beggars Bush  with the following  Prologue  on the solemn Occasion ushered in by this Preamble in Print  APROLOGUE  spoke at  Ransfordstreet  Playhouse on the Revival of  The Royal Merchant  or  The Beggars Bush  which was acted with the  Mock Coronation  on the playing King  Henry  the  VIII  th and Coronation in  Aungierstreet  Playhouse  WELL by this Time your Eyes have ach'd with gazing  On Coronations Masks and Sights no less amazing  Here then you come unwilling to be pleas'd  Longer than just your dazzled Sight is eas'd  The Sun 'tis true will dim the strongest Eye  And Darkness only can new Force supply  Yet you must own that had no Shew been there  You'd been content to kill an Ev'ning here  The  Coronation  made so great a Noise  Had there been none  Harry  had miss'd your Voice  BuffoonJackpuddingJobsonHob  conspir'd  In vain to make the burlesque King admir'd  He play'd it tho' some say with wond'rous Art  His Bellyshook andthat was all the Part  Yet faith 'tis oddBut we surprise you more  Than  Harry  's Hoh or  Wolsey  's envy'd Store  Here honest  Clause  shall gain a Beggar's Crown  Tho' Tyrants threaten and proud Churchmen frown  Each willing Subject his small Tribute brings  Abhorring Slav'ry yet adoring Kings  Clause  tho' a Beggar 'midst his Rags is free  Henry  's a Slave to Tyrants great as he  How does their Splendor mock their wretched Fate  They mourn in Pomp and starve in pageant State  Like petty Kings who  Rome  's Subjection own  To feed its Pride they hunger on a Throne  If any here with indigested Rage  Will speak malignly of our sporting Stage  As if in Ridicule of Rites so known  Sacred to  Britain  's Fame and  GEORGE  's Crown  We thus our Mockery of State pursue  Let others our Design with Candour view  And own if any Disrespect appears  'Tis them we mock be then the Censure theirs  As the World is fond of Novelty and this Mock Coronation appearing new the Stream of Success flowed upon them with a rapid Torrent swelled their Pockets till they overflow'd their Banks and water'd the Fields of many a Publican Debts were cleared and every single Person might fearless look at the Dial on the  Tholsel  Their Success went even beyond their Hopes and  Aungierstreet  suffered short Allowance as they say at Sea because the Current was turn'd another Way Yet I find by this Success all do not think alike  King Henry the Eighth  with the Coronation in the utmost Magnificence was performed in the Year of his present Majesty's Accession to the Throne at the Theatre Royal in  Drurylane London  The Success  there  was beyond the Bounds of Expectation it was even added to every Play as a  Pantomime  c and exhibited that one Season Times  The Theatre in  Lincoln'sInn Fields  got up a  Mock Coronation  as a Burlesque upon that in  Drury lane  but the Audience took a different Turn to that in  Ransfordstreet  for the poor Mock Peers and Magistrates were pelted off the Stage in the utmost Contempt and all their Study and Labour came to nothing  However this  Mock Coronation  fill'd  Ransfordstreet  Theatre seventeen succeeding Nights  But as Mountainrivers soon overflow they as soon sink and rest in their natural Bed again  Ransfordstreet  was too far out of the Way therefore the Company after three Years Occupation forsook it However I shall subjoin a Couple of poetical Pieces of Poetry occasioned by the above  Prologue  Wits are a Tribe like  Jews  and one Production begets another As every Line of Battle Ship has its own  Chaplain  so every Theatre have their own  Poets  and sometimes like  Ragotin  in  Scarron  they may be found in itinerant Troops The opponent Theatre produced one spoken by Mrs  Bellamy  in Boy's Cloaths at a Time when an epidemic Cold had reigned greatly in Town  Dear Ladies may I perish but I'm proud  To find you all recover'd and so loud  Not one sore Throat amongst you now remains  Of that vile Cold of which the Town complains  And faith you'll answer for me I'm sincere  When I profess I'm glad to see you here  I found a Female Habit would not do  And therefore try'd a Pair of Breeches too  A spruce young Blade well made with such Address  Among you  Belles  may speak with some Success  And I who am a Womanto my Cost  Know by myself what please the Ladies most  In vain we strive our Merit  here  to show  For ev'ry Night to  Ransfordstreet  you go  Where painted Scenes and tinsell'd taudry Dress  Are only splendid Signs of Emptiness  But this is Scandal for all  Dublin  knows  That Playhouse deals not overmuch in Cloaths  Two Venders of the same Commodity will be a little too apt to depreciate each other's Goods therefore the Poet drew his Pen in their Defence and furnished forth the following  Prologue  spoke by Miss  Mackay  in the Character of  Lady Townley  in the  Provok'd Husband  As some poor 'Squire to Country Quarters sent  His Credit gone and all his Money spent  A Swarm of Duns each Morn attend his Door  Crying out  Money Faith we're very poor  Why ay  the 'Squire replies  but pray have Patience  Six Months Arrears comes with my next Acquittance  Just so I've told my Duns this many a Day  They'd all have Money when I got my Play  This Play was for Miss  Mackay  's Benefit    The other House we thank their honest Care  Have to their Cost engag'd the good  Lord Mayor  To send us as they thoughtthe Lord knows where  Yet we'll forgive them if they keep their Word  But that is more than they can yet afford  'Tis true alas we're scant in Cloaths while they  Abound in morethan they can ever pay  Our House is newThanks to our Benefactors  Old Smockalley  was then in a ruinous Condition    Nor do we envy those enslav'd Detractors  They may get one but Lord knows where get Actors  Aungierstrect  was afterwards built for the Company in  Smockalley    We may see this last Bard did not take the least Advantage of his Antagonist Their Lines were exactly even and eighteen Thrusts given on each Side and therefore neither could claim the Conquest tho' like Battles in  Flanders  each Side claimed the Victory and each General put on the Wreath of Conqueror  The Theatre in  Aungierstreet  was built by the voluntary Subscription of many of the illustrious Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdom The first Stone was laid by the Duke of  Dorset  then Lord Lieutenant but I think the Architect had more View to the Magnificent than Theatrical The Audience Part is ornamented with rich Embellishment that gives it a superb Countenance but no Disparagement to the Architect in other Buildings this might have been more convenient with less Cost But I believe the Contriver had an Eye more to  Ridottos  than the  Drama  If so indeed his Intentions were answered for in that Shape it may vie with that in the  Haymarket  in  London  Thrusting my own Opinion in this Manner might have the Air of Presumption if my Employment and Observation had not  taken up full thirty Years of my Time In other Buildings I would not pretend to give my Judgment on a Pigeonhouse or a Centrybox or give Directions in erecting a thatched Cabin or a Turnpike  Aungierstreet  Theatre opened  March  the th with the Comedy of  The Recruiting Officer  the Parts acted as follows  Captain Plume by Mr J Elrington  Justice Balance by Mr Layfield  Captain Brazen by Mr R Elrington  Worthy by Mr Watson  Kite by Mr Vanderbank  Bullock by Mr F Elrington  Since dead  st Recruit by Mr Reed  Now in his Majesty's Navy  d Recruit by Mr Butler  Died in  England  Silvia by Mrs Bellamy  Melinda by Mrs Wrightson  Lucy by Mrs Reynolds  Rose by Mrs Moreau  These were the main Body of the Theatrical Army in its first March tho' several Auxiliaries join'd them afterwards  The Theatre in  Smockalley  The proper Name is  Orangestreet  but it took the Appellation of  Smockalley  from Mother  Bungy  of infamous Memory and was in her Days a Sink of Sin but a Man being found murder'd in these bottomless Pits of Wickedness the Sheds were pulled down by the Populace the unclean Vermin were banish'd the Place purged of its Infamy handsome Dwellings now shew their Faces in a modest Garb and entertain modest and reputable Inhabitants and therefore I think ought to lose its old stain'd Name But if  Tyburn  were removed the Spot would be call'd  Tyburn  still  was built by a voluntary Subscription The Architect has  considered the Building more for the real Intention of the Proprietors I mean for Profit The  Cavea  or that Part where the Audience sit is much more convenient than that of  Aungierstreet  and will contain a fifth Part more in Number than the latter altho' it does not appear so to the Eye On the contrary the Stage is more cramp'd for want of Room which might have been otherwise at the first building  When I came first from  England  in the Year I brought over an experienc'd  Machinist  who alter'd the Stage after the Manner of the Theatres in  France  and  England  and formed a Machine to move the Scenes regularly all together but it is since laid aside as well as the Flies above which were made as convenient as the Theatre would admit However the present Manager has form'd it as regular and convenient as the Spot would allow of decorated it with all the Elegance of the  Theatres  Abroad with proper Scenery and Habits that her elder Sisters in  England  need not blush at the Figure she makes  This new Theatre opened with a Comedy call'd  Love makes a Man or The Fop's Fortune  The Parts played as follows  Don Antonio by Mr Dash  Don Charino by Mr Bourne  Carlos by Mr Ward  Don Lewis by Mr Wetherilt  Don Duart by Mr Cashel  Clody by Mr Sparks  Governor by Mr Redman  Sancho by Mr Barrington  Elvira by Miss Boucher  Lovisa by Mrs Ward  Angelina by Miss Barnes  Now  Martin  But so eager were they to open or to get Money that they began to play before the Backpart of the House was til'd in which the Town knowing they had not Half an Audience the first Night but mended leisurely by Degrees where we shall leave them on the mending Hand and walk to  CAPELSTREET  This Theatre was built like an aggrieved People in the State of Rebellion their Forces raised in a Hurry neither well cloath'd arm'd or paid their Fortifications so slightly thrown  up did not promise a long Defence though they had a Veteran at their Head that might have taught them Discipline had he taken proper Pains with his raw Soldiers or rather indeed had they been more capable of being taught But this hasty Building was erected in the great Cause of Liberty  The Love of Liberty with Life is giv'n  And Life itself's th' inferior Gift of Heav'n  This Company open'd under the Sanction of the Lord Mayor of  Dublin  and call'd themselves the  City Company of Comedians  Their first Play was  Shakespear  's  Merchant of Venice  Duke by Mr Rivers  Morochius by Mr Brouden  Antonio by Mr Townsend  Bassanio by Mr Marshal  Gratiano by Mr Hall  Lorenzo by Mr Corry  Shylock by Mr Wright  Tubal by Mr Bourne  Launcelot by Mr Morgan  Portia by Mrs Brouden  Nerissa by Mrs Phillips  Jessica by Miss Lewis  I shall leave the further Mention of this Theatre to the Memoirs of the worthy Projector of  it  Harlequin Phillips  and end with its Neighbour  PUNCH's THEATRE  O happy Manager whose Servants never disoblige or contradict his Will No clamouring for Parts or Pay No Envy reigns among them No Sycophants to corrupt his Ears with Falshoods or cringing Flatterers to tickle his Vices or swell his Pride and Vanity But all obey him without Selfinterest or ever trouble themselves whether they are naked or cloath'd or ever repine at the Success of each other's Performance or like the  Spaniards  A  Spanish  Bishop writes thus of the Conquest of  America  The first Conquerors of this large new World gave out that there were mighty Giants and warlike  Amazons  all of them a Race of Cannibals that fed upon human Flesh making War on each other for that Purpose But these Reports were spread to cover the Inhumanity of the  Spaniards  who put to Death with extreme Tortures above Six Millions of innocent naked harmless  Indians  pretending it was in the Service of Heaven to rob starve and murder the Image of their Creator when it has been proved their own Avarice was the Motive when Millions were put to Death a thousand Ways because they could not or would not discover their hidden Wealth  Thus it too often falls out among ourselves when a poor Wretch is halfladen with Injuries they make up the other Halfburden with Falshoods and very humanly throw on a Weight that intirely sinks him    lay Faults on the  Indians  to cover their own Cruelty Mr  Punch  's Theatre has been built and occupy'd by these decent and wellbehav'd Performers several Years It goes by the Name of the first Founder STRETCH as the Coffeehouses in  London  still go by the Names of  Tom  's  White  's and  Will  's tho' the Names of their present Masters may be  Jack Sam  or  Ned  However it intimates that the first were eminent in their Stations and it expresses Modesty in the Survivors in owning it by continuing  their  Names rather than their  own  Thus has this opulent City of  Dublin  every innocent Diversion that may unbend the Mind equal to any City of  Europe  leaving the  Italian  Opera out which can neither produce Mirth or Sorrow Pity or Compassion Yet here is Music in Perfection converted to a better Use than in  Britain  which produces a double Pleasurethe Charms of  Harmony  and the Means to relieve the  Poor  I have been in most Parts of the World in my Youth and in every Place of Note I have touch'd at as the Sailors term it have found the Natives of this Kingdom in Places of Trust and Power venerated and esteemed by all I  shall therefore conclude with two Lines of that celebrated  French  Author Monsieur  Voltaire  I have mentioned this Author in another Part of the Work as an  Exile  but have learn'd since that his Banishment is repealed and he is made  Historiographer  to the  French  King    Peuple malheureux doux genereux et vaillant  En tous lieux exiles mais par tout triomphant  "Illfated Race brave generous and true  "Tho' Exiles in each Clime thro' all subdue"  MEMOIRS of the principal Performers on the STAGE  JOSEPH ASHBURY  Esq  THIS worthy Gentleman was born in  London  the Year of an antient Family His Father married a near Relation of that great  Scholar  and  Soldier  Sir  Walter Raleigh  who was first Gentleman to that Duke of  Buckingham  that was kill'd by Lieutenant  Felton  in the Reign of King  Charles  the First The Gentleman I am about to give an Account of was sent very young to  The School of  Eton  was founded by that unfortunate King  Henry  the Sixth eminent to a Degree for producing Men of great Learning 'Tis seated on the delightful River of  Thomas  in  Buckinghamshire  overagainst  Windsor  in  Berkshire  it is called  EtonCollege  The Chapel is a handsome  Gothic  Pile with an Organ and Choir This Place is ranked as the first FreeSchool in the King's Dominions It seems by  Art  and  Nature  form'd for Study its shady Walks public or private large Gardens Orchards Groves and the limpid River are natural Calls for Learning  EtonSchool  near  Windsor  where he received a genteel Education being very well instructed in classical Learning After the Death of his Father his Friends procur'd him a Pair of Colours in the Army under the Duke of  Ormond  which was the first Time of his coming into  this Kingdom in the last Year of  Oliver Cromwell  's Administration  Mr  Ashbury  was one of the Number of Officers that seiz'd the Castle of  Dublin  when Governor  Jones  was made Prisoner and secur'd in Behalf of King  Charles  II He was made Lieutenant of Foot of a Company granted by that Monarch to the City of  Dublin  in the Year and the Duke of  Ormond  the then Lord Lieutenant made him one of the Gentlemen of his Retinue and DeputyMaster of the  Revels  under  John Ogilby  Esq  some time after  In the Year at the Death of the Master of the Revels through Mr  Ashbury  's Interest with the Duke of  Ormond  he was made Patentee and Master of the Revels in this Kingdom His first Wife was Sister to an eminent Actor of that Time Mr  Richards  by whom he had two Children who died in their Infancy and the Mother of them being a very infirm Woman was not long after the Death of her second Child before she left the World  Mr  Ashbury  continued a Widower many Years till fixing his Eyes upon Miss  Darling  a blooming young Gentlewoman Daughter to the Reverend Mr  Darling  Dean of  Emly  by this Lady he had two Sons the eldest Mr  Boyle Ashbury  Lieutenant in Brigadier  Bor  's Regiment and unfortunately killed in a Duel at  Sligoe  where he was then on Duty  June  the th The last of the Male Race Mr  Richard Ashbury  is Deputy  Athlone  Pursuivant and an eminent Undertaker  in  Capelstreet  The first Part of this Account I gathered from Mr  Joseph Ashbury  s own Mouth when I was a young Man under his Directions in this Kingdom about four Years before his Death when he liv'd at the  BowlingGreenHouse Oxmantown  since built upon then I believe the finest Spot of its Kind in the whole Universe  His only Daughter was married to Mr  Thomas Elrington  Mr  Ashbury  was not only the principal  Actor  in his Time but the best  Teacher  of the Rudiments of that Science in the three Kingdoms I speak not from my own Judgment but that of many others as Mr  Wilks  Mr  Booth  Mr  Keene  c To prove this give me leave to insert a Letter from Mr  Wilks  to Mr  Ashbury  concerning Mr  William Wilks  his Nephew  I was favoured with this Letter by Mr  Richard Ashbury  the Son    To  Joseph Ashbury  Esq  Master of the Revels  Dublin  I Have no Pretence to ask a Favour of Mr  Ashbury  but that he has a thousand times oblig'd me I take the Liberty therefore to recommend the Bearer my Nephew  Mr  William Wilks  the Nephew mentioned in this Letter came over here and play'd several Parts in the Old  Smockalley  Theatre and tho' young and genteel he was only the Shadow of his Uncle and his Name befriended him more than his Abilities He return'd to  England  after a Year's Probation here and was entered one of the Company in  Drurylane  at thirty Shillings a Week and died before he had reached his th Year or a higher Salary He was a good Scholar and had a tolerable Knack of  Rhyming to his  PHYLLIS  to you for your Countenance and Favour  He was bred an Attorney but is unhappily fallen in Love with that fickle Mistress the Stage and no Arguments can dissuade him from it I have refus'd to give him any Countenance in Hopes that Time and Experience might cure him But since I find him determined to make an Attempt somewhere no one I am sure is able to give him so just a Notion of the Business as Mr  Ashbury  and indeed I am proud to own that all the Success I have met with both with you and in  England  on the Stage has been intirely owing to the early Impressions I received from  You  If you find that my Nephew wants either Genius or any other necessary Qualification I beg dear Sir that you will freely tell him his Disabilities and then it is possible he may more easily be persuaded to return to his Friends and Business which I am inform'd he understands perfectly well  Before I had the Favour of yours honest  Jo Trefusis  Mr  Joseph Trefusis  was the original  Trapland  in  Love for Love  and a wellesteem'd low Comedian a Theatrical Term to distinguish that Branch from the Genteel and was famous for Dancing an aukward Country Clown He was an experienced  Angler  As he was fishing by the  Liffy  Side some Friends of his were going in a Boat in order to embark for  England Jo  seeing them called to them to take him in that he might see them safe on board He gave his FishingRod to a Friend on Shore to take care of till his Return but  Jo  it seems was prevailed upon by his Companions to make the Journey to  London  with them with his Fishingcloaths upon his Back not a second Shirt and but seven Shillings in his Pocket His Companions left him at  London  and Mr  Wilks  found him gazing at the Dial in the Square of  CoventGarden  He hardly knew him at first as Mr  Wilks  told me but by his particular Gait which was beyond Imitation When he asked him how he came there and in that Pickle  Hum ha why faith  Bobby reply'd  Jo I only came from  Dublin  to see what it was o'Clock at  Covent Garden However Mr  Wilks  newcloath'd him supply'd him with Money and sent him back as mentioned in the above Letter before he receiv'd Mr  Ashbury  's Letter to supply him  I believe was near his Journey's  End and I had taken care to furnish him with what was necessary for which I neither expect or desire any Return 'tis sufficient that you esteem it a Kindness and I wish it were in my Power to lay a more lasting Obligation upon Mr  Ashbury  or any of his Family My most humble Service to the dearest Part of youIn plain Termsyour Wifeto Mr  Elrington  and his  Fanny  and pray believe that I shall be ready on all Occasions to shew how much I am dear Sir your oblig'd and faithful humble Servant  ROBERT WILKS  London  Dec  When the Earl of  Wharton  was Lord Lieutenant some needy Courtier try'd all his Interest to be made Master of the Revels insomuch that Mr  Ashbury  was greatly alarm'd at it which was said to proceed from a Report of his Death Therefore in the th Year of his Age he embark'd for  England  to solicit the Queen  He arrived at  Chester  from whence he sent the following Letter to his Wife concerning the Affair  I received this from the same Hand with the other  Chester  October    My Dear  THIS is only to let you know that I am safely arrived at  Chester  where I had the good Fortune to meet with Sir  John Stanley  who was well pleased to see me After I had told him the Cause of my Journey relating to my Patent he bid me be assured he would render me all the good Offices in his Power and was of the Opinion it lay in the Will of the Duke of  Shrewsbury  our good Lord Lieutenant without giving our gracious Queen the least Trouble concerning it This Morning I had the Honour of a Visit from Mr  Kightly  and Sir  Richard Levinze  who are of the same Opinlon with Sir  John  and have both promised me their utmost Assistance Good Mr  Kightly  tells me he will put her Majesty  in mind of her old Master  Mr  Ashbury  taught the Queen when she was Princess  Anne  the Part of  Semandra  in  Mithridates  King of  Pontus  which was acted at Court by Persons of the first Rank in the BanquetingHouse  Whitehall  where Mr  Ashbury  was Prompter and conducted the Whole  as he was pleased to call me I am so well satisfy'd in the Affair that I would return to thee on the first Opportunity if I had not resolved to see my Sister and my Son  Tom Elrington  's Father and Mother  Thou knowest it is troublesome to me to write but to satisfy thee in thy longing Desire to hear from me I take the Trouble with Pleasure I remain thine for ever  JOSEPH ASHBURY  My Blessing to all my dear Children  Mr  Ashbury  suceeded Mr  Darling  as Steward of the  King'sInns  a Post of good Profit I had not the Pleasure of knowing this great Man but till the latter Part of his Life yet notwithstanding his great Age I have seen him perform several Parts with the utmost Satisfaction and tho' at his Years it could not be expected the Fire of Youth and Vigour should blaze out yet Truth and Nature might be seen in a just Light His Person was of an advantageous Height wellproportioned and manly and notwithstanding his great Age erect a Countenance that demanded a reverential Awe a full and meaning Eye piercing tho' not in its full Lustre and yet I have seen him read Letters and printed Books without any Assistance from Art a sweetsounding manly Voice without any Symptoms of his Age in his Speech I have seen him acquit himself in the Part of  Careless  in the  Committee  so well that his Years never struck upon Remembrance And his Person Figure and Manner in  Don Quixote  were inimitable The Use of a short Cloak in former Fashions on the Stage seem'd habitual to him and in Comedy he seemed to wear it in Imagination which  often produced Action tho' not ungraceful particular and odd to many of the Audience yet in Tragedy those Actions were left off and every Motion manly great and proper  Mrs  Ashbury  even in her noontide Sun had an amiable Person a sweet innocent modest winning Countenance and having so great a Master in the Art was ever just in Speech and Action without climbing to the Summit of Perfection yet I have seen her perform one Part that seem'd a finish'd Original where all since have appeared to me but excellent Copies if I may use the Term that is Mrs  Pinchwife  in  Wycherly  's Comedy of the  Country Wife  Joseph Ashbury  Esq  died  July  in the d Year of his Age retaining his Judgment to the last Moment of his Life Mrs  Ashbury  surviv'd him a few Years bewailing his Loss till she follow'd him to the Grave This great Man was Master of the Revels to Five Monarchs of  England  viz K  Charles  II K  James  II K  William  Q  Anne  and K  George  the First I shall lead him to his Grave with the following Poem on his lamented Death  As distant Thunder in a rolling Cloud  First murmurs inwardly then roars aloud  Till the dread Clap frights ev'ry mortal Ear  And strikes them with a just and panic Fear  Such was the sad distracted News which bore  The Tidings to us  Ashbury  's no more  The Muses speechless to his Shrine repair  Ev'n Art and Wit stand silent Mourners there  Yet bolder Zeal will Bands of Duty break  And Gratitude has Liberty to speak  True Passion too can Inspiration bring  'Twas Grief first taught the Nightingale to sing  From his as from some Hero's awful Tomb  Ev'n my dead Muse shall vital Warmth resume  When first in Learning  's  Orb his Lustreblaz'd  The World look'd up transported and amaz'd  His Words as if inspir'd Impression made  Ulysses'  Skill without his Craft display'd  His Counsels ne'er were varnish'd o'er with Art  With Policy he still did Truth impart  Spoke Oracles but always spoke his Heart  By Judgment's Compass ev'ry Course he steer'd  And watch'd the Signals ere the Storm appear'd  His Prudence o'er the Surges did prevail  With Ballast still proportion'd to his Sail  Precipitately ne'er assum'd a Trust  To promise slow but in Performance just  By Grace instructed and by Nature mild  Nor relish'd Life but when he reconcil'd  His Life and Aspect did just Patterns give  What Figures we should make and how to live  Mr ANTONY ASTON commonly called TONY  THIS Person was bred an Attorney in  England  but having a Smattering of Wit and Humour he left the Study of the Law for Parts on the Stage He strain'd sorth a Comedy which was acted on the Theatre in  Smockalley  call'd  Love in a Hurry  but with no Success He play'd in all the Theatres in  London  but never continued long in any his Way of living was peculiar to himself and Family resorting to the principal Cities and Towns in  England  with his  Medley  as he call'd it which consisted of some capital Scenes o Humour out of the most celebrated Plays His Company were generally compos'd of his own Family himself his Wife and Son between every Scene a Song or Dialogue of his own Composition fill'd up the Chinks of the slender Meal He pretended a Right to every Town he entered and if a Company came to any Place where he exhibited his Compositions he would use all his Art to evacuate the Place of these Interlopers as he called them He was never out of his Way or if he met with a sightly House when he was Itinerant he would soon find the Name Title and Circumstances of the Family curry them over with his humorous Verse and by that means get something to bear his Charges to his next Station His  Finances  like those of Kingdoms were sometimes at the Tide of  Flood  and as often at low  Ebb  In one where his Stream had left the Chanel dry yet ready to launch out on a trading Voyage without a Cargo or Provision he called up his Landlord to whom there was something due told him of his Losses in his present Voyage and being sent for to another Place desired he would lend him a small Sum upon his  Wardrobe  which he shew'd him in a large Box ten times  the Value of the Debt owing or the Sum borrow'd The honest Landlord seeing a proper Security easily comply'd gave him the Sum demanded lock'd up the Trunk put the Key in his Pocket and retired But as no Vessel can make a Voyage without Sails and other proper Materials he had contriv'd a false Bottom to this great Box took out the Stuffing and by Degrees sent off his Wardrobe by his Emissaries unperceiv'd And that the Weight should not detect him he filled up the Void with Cabbagestalks Bricks and Stones cloath'd in Rags to prevent moving when the Vehicle was to be taken the next Morning into the Landlord's Custody Every thing succeeded to his Wish and away went  Tony  but far wide of the Place he mentioned to mine Host A Week was the stated Time of Redemption which the Landlord saw elapse with infinite Satisfaction for he had a Bill of Sale of the Contents in the Trunk he open'd it with great Pleasure but when he saw the fine Lining he was motionless like a Statue carv'd by a bungling Hand He had recourse to Revenge A Bailiff with proper Directions was sent to the Place mentioned but if he had discover'd the least Wit in his Anger he might have thought  Tony  knew better than to tell him Truth I only mention this little Story to let the Reader know the Shifts the  Itinerant  Gentry are sometimes put to For  Tony  when his  Finances  were in Order and cur'd of the Consumption honestly paid him I have had this Tale  both from  Tony  and the Landlord who then kept the  BlackBoy  Inn at  Chelmsford  in  Essex  If  Tony  by chance ever came to a Town where a Company of  Showmen  as People oft call them had got in before him he presently declar'd War with them and his general Conditions of Peace were that they should act a Play for his Benefit that he might leave the Siege and march with his small Troop to some other Place And as he was a Person of Humour and a proper Assurance he generally like a Cat skimm'd off the fat Cream and left the lean Milk to those that stay'd behind I believe he is Travelling still and is as well known in every Town as the PostHorse that carries the Mail He shall make his  Exit  with the two following Lines  If various Dealers the same Goods exhibit  They wish each other dangling on a Gibbet  BARTON BOOTH  Esq  THIS excellent Tragedian was Son to  John Booth  Esq  of the County Palatine of  Lancaster  a Branch of the  Warrington  Family He was born in the Year in that County but soon after his Birth his Father and Family removed to  Westminster  and at that celebrated School the Son received his Education under the Correction as he call'd it of the great Dr  Busby  and Dr  Knipe  He  inform'd me the first Look he cast towards the Theatre was from the Applause he received in performing in the  Andria  of  Terence  in  Latin  at  WestminsterSchool  which perverted his Thoughts from the Pulpit for which his Father intended him At Seventeen he was chose out for the University and had Orders to prepare for his Journey but his Inclinations prevented the Designs of his Friends  He first apply'd to Mr  Betterton  then to Mr  Smith  Two celebrated Actors but they decently refus'd him for Fear of the Resentment of his Family But this did not prevent his pursuing the Point in View therefore he resolv'd for  Ireland  and safely arrived in  June  His first Rudiments Mr  Ashbury  taught him and his first Appearance was in the Part of  Oroonoko  where he acquitted himself so well to a crouded Audience that Mr  Ashbury  rewarded him with a Present of Five Guineas which was the more acceptable as his last Shilling was reduced to Brass as he inform'd me But an odd Accident fell out upon this Occasion It being very warm Weather in his last Scene of the Play as he waited to go on he inadvertently wiped his Face that when he enter'd he had the Appearance of a ChimneySweeper his own Words At his Entrance he was surpris'd at the Variety of Noises he heard in the Audience for he knew not what he had done that a little confounded him till he received an extraordinary Clap of Applause which settled his Mind The Play was desir'd  for the next Night of Acting when an Actress fitted a Crape to his Face with an Opening proper for the Mouth and shap'd in Form for the Nose but in the first Scene one Part of the Crape slip'd off  And Zounds  said he he was a little apt to swear  I look'd like a Magpie When I came off they Lampblack'd me for the rest of the Night  The Composition for blackening the Face are Ivoryblack and Pomatum which is with some Pains clean'd with fresh Butter    that I was flayed before it could be got off again  He remained here near Two Years and in that Time by Letters reconciled himself to his Friends in  England  and return'd with great Theatrical Improvement where he gradually stept to Perfection In he marry'd the Daughter of Sir  Wm Barkham  Bart an antient Family in the County of  Norfolk  who died without Issue in the Year  Pyrrhus  in the  Distrest Mother  plac'd him in the Seat of  Tragedy  and  Cato  fix'd him there and to reward his Merit he was join'd in the Patent tho' great Interest was made against him by the other  Patentees  who to prevent his soliciting his Patrons at Court then at  Windsor  gave out Plays every Night where Mr  Booth  had a principal Part Notwithstanding this Step he had a Chariot and Six of a Nobleman's waiting for him at the End of every Play that whipt him the Twenty Miles in three Hours and brought him back to the Business of the Theatre the next Night  He told me not one Nobleman in the Kingdom had so many Sets of Horses at Command as he had at that Time having no less than Eight the first Set carrying him to  Hounslow  from  London  Ten Miles and the next Set ready waiting with another Chariot to carry him to  Windsor  He had a vast Fund of Understanding as well as Goodnature and a persuasive Elocution even in common Discourse that would even compel you to believe him against your Judgment of Things Notwithstanding his Exuberance of Fancy he was untainted in his Morals In his younger Years he admir'd none of the Heathen Deities so much as  Jolly Bacchus  to him he was very devout yet if he drank ever so deep it never marr'd his Study or his Stomach But immediately after his Marriage with Miss  Santlow  whose wise Conduct Beauty and winning Behaviour so wrought upon him that Home and her Company were his chief Happiness he intirely contemn'd the Folly of Drinking out of Season and from one Extreme fell I think into the other too suddenly for his Appetite for Food had no Abatement I have often known Mrs  Booth  out of extreme Tenderness to him order the Table to be remov'd for fear of overcharging his Stomach  His profound Learning was extraordinary since he left School at Seventeen took to the Stage at Eighteen and by his own Confession that the Business of the Stage joined with his  Devotion to  Bacchus  had taken up most of his Time since yet I have seen him take a Classic and render it in such elegant  English  that no Translator would hardly excel I will set down his Character from a Paper call'd the  Prompter  by  Aaron Hill  Esq  whose Writings will be a living Monument of his own Merit  Mr  Booth  was a Man of a strong clear and lively Imagination His Conversation was lively and instructive He had the Advantage of a finish'd Education to improve and illustrate the bountiful Gifts of Nature Two Advantages distinguished him in the strongest Light from the rest of the Fraternity He had Learning to understand perfectly whatever it was his Part to speak and Judgment to know how far it agreed or disagreed with his Character Hence arose a peculiar Grace which was visible to every Spectator tho' few were at the Pains of examining into the Cause of their Pleasure He could soften or slide over with a kind of elegant Negligence the Improprieties in a Part he acted while on the contrary he would dwell with Energy upon the Beauties as if he exerted a latent Spirit which had been kept back for such an Occasion that he might alarm waken and transport in those Places only where the Dignity of his own good Sense could be supported with that of his Author A little Reflection upon this remarkable Quality will teach us to account for that manifest Languor which has  sometimes been observed in his Action and which was generally tho' I think falsly imputed to the Indolence of his Temper For the same Reason tho' in the customary Round of his Business he would condescend to some Parts in Comedy he seldom appear'd in any of them with much Advantage to his Character The Passions which he found in Comedy were not strong enough to excite his Fire and what seem'd Want of Qualification was only Absence of Impression He had a Talent of discovering the Passions where they lay hid in some celebrated Parts by the injudicious Practice of other Actors when he had discover'd he soon grew able to express them And his Secret for attaining this great Lesson of the Theatre was an Adaption of his Looks to his Voice by which artful Imitation of Nature the Variations in the Sound of his Words gave Propriety to every Change in his Countenance So that it was  Booth  's Excellence to be heard and seen the same whether as the pleas'd the griev'd the pitying the reproachful or the angry His Gesture or as it is commonly call'd his Action was but the Result and necessary Consequence of his Dominion over his Voice and Countenance for having by a Concurrence of Two such Causes impressed his Imagination with such a Stamp and Spirit of Passion his Nerves obey'd the Impulse by a kind of natural Dependency or relaxed  or braced successively into all that fine Expressiveness with which he painted what he spoke without Restraint or Affectation  As a Proof of Mr  Booth  's Learning I am desired to insert the  Latin  Inscription wrote by him on the Death of Mr  Smith  This Gentleman Mr  Smith  was zealously attach'd to the Interest of King  James  the Second and served in his Army as a Volunteer with Two Servants After the Abdication Mr  Smith  return'd to the Theatre by the Persuasion of many Friends and the Desire of the Town who admired his Performance The first Character he chose to appear in was that of  Wilmore  in the  Rover  his original Part in that Comedy but being informed that he should be maltreated on account of his Principles he gave Orders for the Curtain to drop if any Disturbance should come from the Audience Accordingly the Play began in the utmost Tranquillity but when Mr  Smith  entered in the First Act the Storm began with the usual Noise upon such Occasions an Uproar not unknown to all Frequenters of Theatres and by Time mightily improved by a particular Set that delight in that agreeable Harmony as pleasing to the Ear as a Sowgelder's Horn that sets all the Village Curs to imitate the Sound Mr  Smith  gave the Signal the Curtain dropp'd and the Audience dismiss'd No Persuasions could prevail upon him to appear on the Stage again till that great Poet Mr  Congreve  had wrote his Comedy of  Love for Love  which was in the Year more than three Years void from the above Accident This celebrated Author prevailed upon several Persons of the First Rank to move Mr  Smith  to appear in the Character of  Scandal  in that excellent Comedy But he yielded more to the Persuasions of his sincere Friends Mr  Betterton  and Mrs  Barry  and accepted the Part and his inimitable Performance added one Grace to the Play He took his Station in many Plays afterwards for I think three Years He died of a Cold occasino'd by a violent Fit of the Cramp for when he was first seiz'd he threw himself out of Bed and remained so long before the Cramp left him in that naked Condition that a Cold fell upon his Lungs a Fever ensu'd and Death releas'd him in three Days after  the  Actor  with a short Account of him as I receiv'd it from Mr  Benjamin Husband  Scenicus eximius  Regnante  Carolo Secundo  Bettertono  Coaetaneus Amicus  Nec non propemodum Aequalis  Haud ignobile stirpe oriundus  Nec Literarum rudis Humaniorum  Rem Scenicam  Per multos feliciter Annos administravit  Justoque moderamine morum suavitate  Omnium intra Theatrum  Observantiam extra Theatrum laudem  Ubique benevolentiam amorem sibi conciliavit  In English  An excellent Actor  Flourished in the Reign of  Charles the Second  Betterton  's Cotemporary and Friend  And very near him in Merit  Sprung from a genteel Family  And no Stranger to Literature  In the Management of the Theatre  Heacquitted himself many Years with deserved Success  And by a just Deportment and Sweetness of Temper  Gained the Respect of all within the Theatre  The Applause of those without  And everywhere claimed the Friendship  And Affection of Mankind  I shall give a Couple of Songs as a Specimen of his Taste in  English  Poetry among many that do not occur to my Memory The Source of them both sprung from his growing Passion for the amiable Miss  Santlow  before their Marriage  The First SONG  CAN then a Look create a Thought  Which Time can ne'er remove  Yes foolish Heart again thou'rt caught  Again thou bleed'st for Love  She sees the Conquest of her Eyes  Nor heals the Wounds she gave  She smiles whene'er my Blushes rise  And sighing shuns her Slave  Then Swain be bold and still adore her  Still the flying Fair pursue  Love and Friendship still implore her  Pleading Night and Day for you  The Second SONG  I  SWEET are the Charms of her I love  More fragrant than the Damask Rose  Soft as the Down of TurtleDove  Gentle as Winds when Zephyr blows  Refreshing as descending Rains  On Sunburnt Climes and thirsty Plains  II  True as the Needle to the Pole  Or as the Dial to the Sun  Constant as gliding Waters roll  Whose swelling Tides obey the Moon  From ev'ry other Charmer free  My Life and Love shall follow thee  III  The Lamb the flow'ry Thyme devours  The Dam the tender Kid pursues  Sweet  Philomel  in shady Bow'rs  With verdant Spring her Notes renews  All follow what they most admire  As I pursue my Soul's Desire  IV  Nature must change her beauteous Face  And vary as the Seasons rise  As Winter to the Spring gives Place  Summer th' Approach of Autumn flies  No Change on Love the Seasons bring  Love only knows perpetual Spring  V  Devouring Time with stealing Pace  Makes lofty Oaks and Cedars bow  And Marble Tow'rs and Gates of Brass  In his rude March he levels low  But Time destroying far and wide  Love from the Soul can ne'er divide  VI  Death only with his cruel Dart  The gentle Godhead can remove  And drive him from the bleeding Heart  To mingle with the Blest above  Where known to all his Kindred Train  He finds a lasting Rest from Pain  VII  Love and his Sister fair the Soul  Twinborn from Heav'n together came  Love will the Universe controul  When dying Seasons lose their Name  Divine Abodes shall own his Pow'r  When Time and Death shall be no more  Mr W BOWEN  HE was born in this Kingdom in the Year and play'd on the  Irish Theatre  several Years He had a loud strong Voice which gave him the Title of an Actor of Spirit Through the Interest of the late Duke of  Ormond  he got into the Revenue in  London  He was fiery to a Fault and passionate to his Prejudice which drew on his own Death by the unwilling Hands of Mr  Quin  Mr  Bowen  was too tenacious and could not brook being told that the late  Ben Johnson  excell'd in the Part of  Jacomo  in the  Libertine  Tho' it was given against him by the whole Company He immediately parted sent to Mr  Quin  in the Name of a Gentleman to a neighbouring Tavern when he enter'd  Bowen  shut the Door clapt his Back against it and drew his Sword Mr  Quin  mildly expostulated with him but all to no Purpose He threaten'd to pin him to the Wainscot if he did not draw that Moment which he did to defend his own Life with an Intention to disarm him But  Bowen  pressed so furiously upon him that he receiv'd the Wound which occasion'd his Death three Days after However when the Loss of Blood had weakened his Rage he confess'd his own Folly and Madness had justly drawn on his own Misfortune and at the Tryal Mr  Quin  was honourably acquitted Mr  Bowen  had several Children by his Wife and a Boy illegitimate who tho' he bore his Name had none of his Care and therefore lived a dissolute Life without the least Improvement from Education and justly gain'd the Nickname of  RuggedandTough  One Day a Clergyman in  St Clement Danes  a Church in the  Strand  was catechizing the Children of the Parish where  RuggedandTough  thrust among the rest  Rugged  's Dress was none of the cleanest which the good Parson observing call'd him the first to be examin'd I shall put the short Dialogue down just as I had it from an Earwitness since the Questions are short as well as the Answers they will not appear very tedious  Parson  What's your Name  Rug  RuggedandTough  Parson  Who gave you that Name  Rug  The Boys of our Alley Ld dn 'em for't  The good Parson was a little surpris'd no doubt and order'd him to wait till the rest of the Children were examin'd intending to polish Master  RuggedandTough  but  Tough  not liking to wait so long stole off unperceiv'd All I could learn of Mr  RuggedandTough  afterwards was that having a great Inclination to travel he contrived Means to do it at the Charge of the Government  Thus bad Beginning to bad Ending tends  And Vice in Nature Nature seldom mends  Mr JOHN BARRINGTON  THIS Gentleman was born of a good Family in the County of  Corke  He was bred to the Law but his stronger Genius led him to the Drama where he has prov'd himself one of its favourite Children I think his  first Commencement in the Drama was in  Violante  's Booth as it was then call'd in  George'sLane  He may be well esteem'd an excellent Comic Actor of infinite Humour a muchdesir'd pleasing Companion and what is not always to be met with a Person of Sincerity There is a very antient Family of the  Barringtons  in the County of  Essex  in  England  where they shew a Record that their Ancestor was instructed in the Christian Faith by the Preaching of St  Augustine  the Monk afterwards Bishop of  Canterbury  and receiv'd Baptism in the River of  Thames  by that Saint in the Year of Redemption This Account may probably be called a motly one but what of that A good Player from the Poet may instruct and as an old Author writes  A Verse may find him who a Sermon flies  And turn Delight into a Sacrifice  Mr SPRANGER BARRY  THIS Gentleman was born in  Dublin  He was marry'd very young and consequently set forward in the World perhaps with too little Consideration A lively Spirit and good Sense are not always prosperous or meet with that Success equal to their Merit Neither does the Employment of a Father always sit easy upon the Son Business is not  hereditary One may gain a Fortune by the same Employment that might be lost by the Descendent Our young Gentleman by frequent Attendance at the Theatre turned his Genius to the  Drama  Inclination and Fancy are two good Instructors and a Willingness to please is doing some Part of the Work A good Person and an excellent Voice are great Substantives for the Stage  The first Part he perform'd in this Kingdom was  Othello  the  Moor  of  Venice  To the surprising Satisfaction of the general Audience he seem'd a finish'd Actor dropt from the Clouds I hear that in  England  he has gained the Summit of Perfection I would say more upon the Subject but as he received the first Rudiments from me I shall be silent yet borrow a few Lines from the Poet that may give a Remembrance of his Person  Such Beauty as great Strength thinks no Disgrace  Smil'd in the manly Features of his Face  His tall strait Body amidst Thousands stood  Like some fair Pine the loftiest of the Wood  I don't think I can give the Reader a greater Pleasure upon this Occasion than to insert the following Letter upon Mr  Barry  's first Attempt on the Stage which may serve for a general Instruction to all on the Theatre  To Mr  Spranger Barry  from a Friend in the Country  AS I lately heard you were determin'd for the Stage my Affection for your Person and Concern for your Misfortunes gave Occasion to some Reflections which may possibly be of Use to you in this new Scene of Life In the Time of  Athenian  Elegance when Learning was in Taste when Liberty was the Blessing of the Public and the Parent of Arts which Excellence alone found Honour Capacity Employment and Merit Rewards the Stage grew suddenly from its Infancy to Maturity and from being encouraged became itself the Encourager of those Talents and Geniuses with which it was supply'd It was there that each Spectator was taught his particular Conduct by seeing his own Representation in the general Picture of Life where the Lights were thrown alone upon Virtue and the Shades upon Vice where Great and Eminent of every Age were set up for Imitation where every noble tender and exalted Sentiment was recorded and daily inculcated where Purity was invited Obscenity exiled and where the Heart was attached to Virtue by affectingly walking through all its Scenes of Misfortunes and lastly exulting in its final Reward No Institution less than divine could ever be of equal Efficacy or Advantage  For when Instruction becomes our Entertainment then only it is that Vice grows detestable and Virtue delightful from the Pleasure it brings And hence were the Sentiments of the  Grecian  Vulgar so exalted that an immoral Expression tho' naturally introduced in an immoral Character has been hiss'd off the Stage Shall we think then that where the Doctrine was so glorious the Preaching was dishonourable No sure To be an Actor then was not to be a  Mimic  no Trick of Gesture or Tone of Voice could avail Those of Distinction were to be by Nature the very Persons they represented they were to have the same Elevation of Soul the same Delicacy of Thought the same Morality of Life the same Humanity of Heart and Sweetness of Affections that could at once constitute the Patriot the Hero the Lover and the Friend The Words only belonged to the Author the Sentiments were by Nature their own and hence flowed that Aptness of Attitude that Ease in Elocution that expressive Look that eloquent Silence that Freedom of Action and that Harmony of the Whole which at once exalted melted and subdued a mighty Nation to Elegance and Virtue Where such an Actor was found he was justly esteem'd a Blessing to the Community As his Talents were the Admiration so his Person was the Delight of all People in his Life he was honoured and his Posterity provided  for You will now perhaps be tempted to wish that this was the Stage of the  Athenians  but Nature and Mankind are always the same and even on the  English  Theatre I have known some who gain'd more Encouragement and Respect as Actors than they deserv'd as Men But if the Members of your new Province have brought a Scandal on their Profession let it be your Study to retrieve it If I have any Judgment you are qualified to excel in this Way nor would I have you imagine that any will shun you in Private merely because you give them Pleasure and Entertainment in Public Let your Heart be the true Model of whatever is great or good in the Characters you represent Take Instruction with Pleasure and Applause with Humility and then fear not to be received as the Man of Worth and the Gentleman you have hitherto been esteemed I am c  Mr PETER BARDIN  WAS born in  Dublin  tho' of  French  Extraction He bent his Thoughts towards the  Stage  very early in Youth and having seen the Performance of the best Actors in  England  upon the  London  Stages where at various Times he has made one in most of the Theatres in that City if he has not improv'd it must be owing to himself His long Intercourse  of Theatrical Action has improv'd his Study and few Parts become amiss to him either as  Shakespear  says  for Tragedy Comedy History Pastoral PastoralComical HistoricalPastoral Scene undividable or Poem unlimited c  It does not become me to condemn or uphold his Conduct in private Life however I cannot avoid giving my Opinion that such Disputes that have fallen out need not trouble the Public in their public Diversions I own if a Person pays his Money for his Entertainment he ought to enjoy it quietly If a Cook at an Ordinary has spoil'd another Person's Dinner that Person I think has no Right to spoil mine more especially if I had made a Tinker's Bargain and paid for my Meal beforehand Give me Leave to add a printed Paper on the Subject whose Author has said much more than my Capacity will reach  A small Animadversion on a late Affair in the Playhouse  I Went the other Night to the Playhouse in full Expectation of seeing the  Rehearsal  perform'd in as high a Manner as was possible But to my great Surprize the Performance was interrupted and the Audience disappointed by a Concert of most unmusical Instruments in the Gallery The Cause of this Noise and Hurlyburly was soon found to be a private Dispute between somebody in the  Gallery and  Bardin  the Player which Dispute might with the Consent of the whole Theatre have subsisted seven Years so it had not offended a numerous and polite Audience  If a Player in his private Capacity offends me will this warrant my offending a thousand People at once Should I have a Dispute at Law or Play with Mr  Gck  must the whole Town for this Reason lose the Entertainment of the rarest King  Lear  and  Macbeth  that ever were seen in this or any other Country If  Bn  had done any unwarrantable and injurious Thing to a Gentleman  Bn  should have made proper and ample Satisfaction in his private Capacity for the Offence The Audience had no Right in nor Care for  Bn  but they certainly have for Prince  Volscius  he was their Player they had paid for him The Prince had managed his Horse with wondrous Dexterity and had an undoubted Right to have ridden him to the Battle There is nothing more mistaken than that Right which some People imagine they have in Theatres and other publick Places for in Truth their Right consists only in decently partaking of the Entertainment and where they think it deserves it giving a proper and timely Applause It is the same Right that a Man has in a Ferryboat that is if he behaves himself properly to be safely and pleasantly landed on the opposite Shore but if he disturbs the Passage and endangers the Boat the Ferryman and Passengers  will certainly join and throw him overboard A surly Swain at a Horserace fansying he had a Right to any Part of the Sod would needs ride directly in the Course the first of the Racers threw him and his Horse twenty Yards on the Ground and better had it been if he had died with his Horse on the Spot for he received a Lash from every Whip in the Field Every Gentleman properly habited has a Right to go to Court but if a Person having a Pique to a Battleax should breed an Uproar in the Leveeroom he would certainly have a Halberd in his Guts or be sent to the Black Hole There can be no Excuse for doing an Injury to a Multitude  I have often dined at a Twodish Ordinary where I had a Right to partake of each but if I should have taken it into my Head to have thrown one Dish at the Waiter and kick'd the other about the Floor I do verily believe I should have been kick'd down Stairs If a Gentleman Heaven defend us should have a Quarrel on his Hands with a Porter the Gentleman certainly has a Right to do himself Justice but I should think it somewhat untimely if he should knock the Fellow down when he had a Dozen of my Wine on his Back  Shakespear  who well understood the Decorum of Theatres gives strong Advice for proper Behaviour He speaks it to the Players but he meant it to the Spectators likewise tho' in his Modesty he held  it not meet so to set it down He directs them to be extremely careful not to create the least Noise or Disturbance in the House when the Play should be duly attended to He concludes that to disturb the House  is villainous and betrays a pitiful Ambition in the Fool that does it  I am Sirs  your humble Servant  How necessary it is we may see for Stageperformers to have a strict Guard on their Behaviour and I have said it before their own Conduct will make them esteemed or slighted will draw Regard or Insult To strengthen my own Opinion I shall insert a very small Paragraph from a very late NewsPaper  Naples August  One of the Lords of the Court has been banished for having publickly insulted upon the New Theatre one of the Singingwomen of the  Opera  But many Things are spoke without a Thought  That badly constru'd have Confusion brought  Mr JOHN BEAMSLY  THIS Person has had a large Experience of Time and Travel in  England  and  Ireland  for improving his  Theatrical Genius  He  is decent in many Parts and seldom offends in any is ever very perfect a Voice strong and intelligible not unharmonious and may rank in the File of good Actors either in  Tragedy  or  Comedy  Merit may shine in various Beams of Light  And diff'rent Men in diff'rent Roads are right  Mrs BULLOCK  THIS Gentlewoman was the Natural Daughter of the late perfect Comedian  Robert Wilks  Esq  by Mrs  Rogers  an Actress of Merit among great Stage Performers So parented one might have expected a finish'd Genius for the Stage She however pleas'd in several dramatic Characters assisted by a graceful Form and Figure In the Year she was join'd in Wedlock to Mr  Christopher Bullock  a very promising  Comedian  who died in the Road to Excellence  After various Turns of Fortune she came over to this Kingdom with her Daughter now Mrs  Dyer  Her Person may put us in mind of her Mother but she is a happy Stranger to any Failing of her's Mrs  Bullock  died in this Kingdom in the Year  A  Scion  oft proves diff'rent from the Root  And better Branches will yield better Fruit  Miss BELLAMY  THIS young and amiable Actress was born in this Kingdom in the Year She has a most admirable improving Genius therefore it will be no Wonder if she soon reaches the Top of Perfection She has a liberal open Heart to feel and ease the Distresses of the Wretched How amiable must blooming Beauty appear that forms the Mind with every moral Virtue She has lately left this Kingdom to the Regret of all Lovers of the  Drama  I cannot avoid upon this Occasion setting down a few Lines from a Poem on  Bellamy  the Motto from  Milton  Grace was in all her Steps Heav'n in her Eye  In ev'ry Gesture Dignity and Love  The Maid in Action just in Judgment strong  Exacts our Wonder and inspires our Song  From slavish Rules mechanic Forms unty'd  She soars with sacred Nature for her Guide  The Graceadorning Smile the feign'd Despair  The soft'ning Sigh the Souldissolving Tear  Each magic Charm lamented  Oldfield  knew  Inchanting  Bellamy  revives in you  'Tis thine O beauteous Maid the wond'rous Art  To search the Soul and trace the various Heart  With native Grace with unaffected Ease  To form the yielding Passions as you please  Oldmixon  Mrs  Oldmixon  a celebrated Singer from  England  now in  Dublin  Syrenvoice improv'd by Art  Steals softly on the Songenamour'd Heart  But ah how weak how feebly must she wound  The Maid whose chiefest Charm consists in Sound  Or should  Mechel  Mademoiselle  Mechel  an agreeable Dancer now performing in  Smockalley  Theatre  all languishing advance  Her Limbs dissolv'd in wellconducted Dance  The Soul untouch'd she may subdue the Sight  But breathing Wit with Judgment must unite  To give the Man of Reason unconfin'd Delight  COLLEY CIBBER  Esq  THIS great Actor as well as Author was once in this Kingdom many Years age which I gather'd from his saying he landed in the Night and when he ask'd what Place they were in was answer'd  Ringsend O then I am sure we are right  meaning the Answer a  a native Blunder But to rescue that Place from the Aspersion I am credibly inform'd it was the original Dwelling of a Person whose Surname was  Ring  and from him took its Denomination The Father of this Gentleman was a Native of  Holstein  Holstein  is a Dukedom of  Lower Saxony  in  Germany  One Part belongs to the King of  Denmark  the rest the Duke of  Holstein  It has two Imperial Cities The first  Lubeck  a large fair and rich Town accumulated by Trade and Navigation seated about two Miles from the  Baltick  Sea the other City is  Hamburgh  upon the  Elbe  one of the most opulent Marts in  Lower Germany  it being a free City and selfdependent It is very strongly fortify'd The River  Elbe  ebbs and flows with the Tide and wafts Ships of large Burden to the Port from all Parts of the World  a Statuary by Profession  without his Equal in this Kingdom The Figures over the Gate of  Bethlehem  or  Bedlam  as it is vulgarly call'd in  Moorfields  and the Pedestal or Base of the  Monument  Since this is a Pillar now the finest in the World and not generally known in this Kingdom I'll give a Description of it This noble Structure is erected near the Spot where the dreadful Fire began in the Year design'd by that great Architect Sir  Christopher Wren  It is a fluted Column Two hundred and two Feet high the greatest Diameter of the Shaft fifteen Foot the lower Part of the Pedestal Twentyeight Foot square and Forty Foot high built with  Portland  Stone finely polish'd the winding Staircase within containing Steps ten Inches and an half broad black Marble inclos'd in the spiral Round with Balustrades of Iron turn'd and ornamented Thirtytwo Foot from the Top is a square Balcony secured with Iron Rails with their Capitals and Bases gilt The Top of this noble Pillar is crown'd with a Flame gilt On the West Side of the square Pedestal  London  is described by the Figure of a Woman lamenting the Ruins of the City in Flames on one Side of her and fronting her  London  in all its Magnificence rebuilt This noble Sculpture was design'd and finish'd in Bassorelievo by  Caius Gabriel Cibber  Father to the Laureat This Pillar was begun in and finish'd in the Year at the Charge of the Public in Commemoration of that fatal Fire in on the Second Day of  September  which consum'd Houses Streets Churches and most of the public Structures The Top of the square Base is ornamented by large Dragons between them the Arms of  England  with Engines of War display'd  Time  with the rest of the Figures masterly finish'd with  London  represented in the Clouds in another Figure of a Woman looking on the City once more in her Glory form a noble Group that cannot be describ'd in Words The three other Squares are fill'd with Inscriptions relating to the fatal Accident tho' some Authors impute it to Design too long to mention here  were carv'd by him  Mr  Colley Cibber  the Son of this great  Artist  was born the Sixth of  November  in  London  but I shall refer the Reader to the  Apology  for his own Life printed for  G Faulkner  The excellent  Dramatic  Works of this Author are  Love's last Shift or The Fool in Fashion  Woman's Wit or The Lady in Fashion  Xerxes  a Tragedy    Love makes a Man or The Fop's Fortune  The Careless Husband  The Lady's last Stake or The Wife's Resentment  The Comical Lovers  She Wou'd and she Wou'd Not or The kind Impostor  Richard  the Third  The Rival Fools  Perolla and Izadora  a Tragedy  The Double Gallant or The Sick Lady's Cure  The Schoolboy  The Nonjuror  Venus and Adonis  a Masque set to Music    Myrtilla  a Masque    The Refusal or The Lady's Philosophy  Ximena or The Heroic Daughter  Caesar in Egypt  The Provok'd Husband or A Journey to London  Love in a Riddle  Damon and Phillida  Papal Tyranny in the Reign of King John  The Country Wake  Besides these  Dramatic  Pieces he has wrote innumerable Songs Prologues c several humorous Pamphlets the excellent  Apology for his own Life  and a Critic upon  Middleton  's Translation of  Cicero  As Envy seldom attacks any other Object but conspicuous Merit this Gentleman was generally attack'd by the Tribe of Scribblers his cotemporary Authors that  Like Villagecurs bark when their Fellows do  which he regarded not and if he ever seem'd to rouse it was like the Lion in Don  Quixot Rise stretch and pss in his Face  As to his Person he is strait and well made of an open Countenance even free from the conspicuous Marks of old Age Meet or follow him and no Person would imagine he ever bore the Burden of above two Thirds of his Years He is Head of a numerous Family and it might be said as a  German  Author writes of the  Nestorian  Lady  Malburges  of that Country  Mater ait natae Dic natae filia natam  Ut moneat natae plangere filiolam  "The aged  Mother  to her  Daughter  spake  "Daughter said she arise  "Thy Daughter to her Daughter take  "Whose Daughter's Daughter cries"  Mr THEOPHILUS CIBBER  THIS Gentleman came into the World on the Day of the great and destructive Storm in whose Rage rang'd over the greatest Part of  Europe  but I think most fatal to  England  He is Son to  Colley Cibber  Esq  that excellent Comedian the present Poet Laureat whose dramatic Works are so well known  Mr  Theophilus Cibber  receiv'd his Education at  Winchester  School His strong Genius for the  Theatre  brought him early upon the Stage where he has appear'd in full Lustre in the various Branches of Comedy and tho' he has  perform'd several Parts in Tragedy with Success in my Imagination the  Sock  sits easier upon him than the  Buskin  His first Wife mention'd in the Account of Mrs  Clive  was Miss  Johnson  by whom he had two Daughters The eldest I am inform'd has appear'd on the Stage with great Prospect of excelling first in the Part of  Juliet  in  Romeo  and  Juliet  by  Shakespear  His second Wife Miss  Arne  by whom he has no living Issue is arriv'd at the highest Pitch of Excellence in the amiable soft and tender  Mr  Theophilus Cibber  has appear'd twice as a dramatic Author  viz  first  Henry the Sixth  alter'd from  Shakespear  which was play'd in the Summerseason of without any Criticks laying hold of it His second Performance in the Drama was a Comedy call'd  The Lover  but as the Criticks were always ready arm'd to attack the Father they drew their Indignation on the Son with the false Imagination that the Father was the conceal'd Author But I am positively convinced to the contrary for that Gentleman to me refus'd the Sight of it before it appear'd on the Stage for the very Reasons he suspected that fell out accordingly However he wrote an  Epilogue  that was spoken by Mr  Theophilus  and his Wife that took away the Sting of the Revelrout and the Play was perform'd six Nights in the Year The  Epilogue  for its Singularity I shall insert here  EPILOGUE Spoken by the AUTHOR and his WIFE  Wife  NOW I suppose you'll find your Work is done  Did not I sayyou were your Father's Son  Be what it might your Play the Town wou'd game it  That your bare Name were half a Cause to damn it  Experience to your Cost will shew you now  Who wears the wiser Head your Wife or you  Author  Tho' all this shou'd be true my pretty Rogue  Yet what's all this dear  Jane  to th'  Epilogue  Wife  Why what's an  Epilogue  to such a Play  Will it be sav'd by ought that I can say  Author  No matter what's its Meritno my Dear  When many a Husband's Case has known Despair  A wheedling Wife has brought the Thing to bear  Wife  O I'm your humble Servant humble Sir  Now you're distress'd you my weak Head prefer  No Sir since you have had your Frolick pay it  When you have rais'd the Storm your Wife must lay it  Author  I'll give you Composition gentle Spouse  All my clear Benefit of my Thirdday's House  Wife  Which may amount tonot one single Souse  Author  Were mine alone the Case that may be true  Yet to your very Sex some Pity's due  They'll not with me destroy the Guiltless too  Wife  To the Audience  Gallants in this  I hope he has touch'd your Hearts  Let not me suffer for his weak Deserts  Do not to last Extremes your Censure drive  Give us at least an honest Chance to live  Our Fate is in your HandsIf you are brave  You'll think the Triumph less to ruin than to save  This Comedy the Author dedicated to his Wife in order to make a perfect Agreement between them He has also wrote several small Pieces in Verse and Prose occasionally besides several Letters in an odd Dispute between him and Mr  Thomas Sheridan  printed  here  and in  London  I shall not meddle with conjugal Affairs these short Memoirs would swell too large and the Belly out of Proportion for the Body appear dropsical and require Tapping  Then draw a Veil o'er what must be conceal'd  To hide those Faults that should not be reveal'd  Mrs CIBBER  THIS true and perfect Actress was Daughter to Mr  Arne  an eminent  Upholder  in  CoventGarden  Her first Appearance on the Stage was as a Singer her Voice and Judgment gain'd her universal Applause But when she commenced a speaking Actress she charm'd anew Her first Appearance was in the Part of  Zara  to the Admiration of every Spectator that had their auricular Faculties and since that has prov'd herself the Daughter of Nature in Perfection I shall add a  Prologue  wrote by the  Laureat  on her first appearing in the Part of  Zara  and leave her to enjoy her deserved Praise  Spoke by Mr CIBBER  THE  French  howe'er Mercurial they may seem  Extinguish Half their Fire by critic Phlegm  While  English  Writers Nature's Freedom claim  And warm their Scenes with an ungovern'd Flame  'Tis strange that Nature never should inspire  A  Racine  's Judgment with a  Shakespear  's Fire  Howe'er Tonight to promise much we're loth  Butyou've a Chance to have a Taste of both  From  English  Plays  Zara  's  French  Author fir'd  Confess'd his Muse beyond herself inspir'd  From rack'd  Othello  's Rage he rais'd his Style  And snatch'd the Brand that lights this tragic Pile  Zara  's Success his utmost Hopes outflew  And a twice twentieth weeping Audience drew  As for our  English  Friend he leaves to you  Whate'er may seem to his Performance due  No Views of Gain his Hopes or Fears engage  He  gives  a Child of Leisure to the Stage  Willing to try if yet forsaken Nature  Can charm with any one remember'd Feature  Thus far the Author speaksBut now the Player  With trembling Heart presents his humble Prayer  Tonight the greatest Venture of my Life  Is lost or sav'd as you receivea Wife  If Time you think may ripen her to Merit  With gentle Smiles support her wav'ring Spirit  Zara  in  France  at once an Actress rais'd  Warm'd into Skill by being kindly prais'd  O could such Wonders here from Favour flow  How would our  Zara  's Heart with Transport glow  But she alas by juster Fears opprest  Begs but your bare  Endurance  at the best  Her unskill'd Tongue would simple  Nature  speak  Nor dares  her  Bounds for false Applauses break  Amidst a thousand Faults her best Pretence  To pleaseis unpresuming Innocence  When a chaste Heart's Distress your Grief demands  One silent Tear outweighs a thousand Hands  If she conveys the pleasing Passions right  Guard and support her this decisive Night  If she mistakes or finds her Strength too small  Let interposing Pity break her Fall  In you it rests to save her or destroy  If she draws Tears from youI weepfor Joy  Mr OLIVER CASHEL  I Know little more of this Gentleman than that he was born in  Ireland  of a very antient reputable Family He commenced Actor in this Kingdom where he made but slow Progress as I have been inform'd He was recommended to the Manager in  Drurylam  by his Friend and Countryman Mr  Charles Macklin  who brought him from the  Bristol  Theatre where they both play'd the Summer before I think in the Year  The first Part he play'd on  Drurylam  Theatre was Sir  Julius Caefar  in Sir  Walter Ralegh  where his good Figure was his best Friend for Fear had made his Voice not his own if I may be allow'd that Term It is a Theatrical Observation that Fear in the first settingout Attempt on the Stage is not an il Omen for many that have set on without it  have play'd their best and never mended afterwards This Gentleman is one Proof of it for he got the better of his Fear proving a very good Theatrical Officer in a little Time  The first Dramatic Piece of Mr  Dryden  that great Poet was a Comedy call'd  The Wild Gallant  that met with so little Success as  Langbain  says "that if he had not a peculiar Force of Inclination to the  Drama  he would have been sufficiently discouraged from any farther Progress in Dramatic Writing"  And I hear since I have left  England  has so far excelled in Captain  Macheath  in the  Beggars Opera  which requires a good  Singer  to the Qualifications of a good  Actor  that his Merit has given this excellent Piece a large fresh Run in  Coventgarden  which he went to from  Drurylane  eight or nine Years ago  This Gentleman died at  Norwich  the capital City of the County of  Norfolk  He was taken speechless on the Stage in the Part of  Frankly  in a Comedy call'd  The Suspicious Husband  He was carried to his Lodgings where Physicians and Surgeons attended but to no Purpose for he expired in a few Hours in spight of the Doctor  Death eases Lovers sets the Captive free  And tho' a Tyrant offers Liberty  Mrs CATHARINE CLIVE formerly Miss RAFTOR  THIS celebrated natural Actress was the Daughter of Mr  William Raftor  a Gentleman born in the City of  Kilkenny  in  Ireland  The Father of her Father was possessed of a considerable Paternal Estate in the County where he was born but the Parent of our Actress being unhappily attach'd to the unfortunate King  James  the Second the late Revolution gave it among many others to the Crown Mr  James Raftor  her Brother went over to  Ireland  some Years ago in order to solicit for his Grandfather's Fortune but did not meet with Success  Mr  William Raftor  the Father was bred to the Law however when King  James  was in  Ireland  he enter'd into his Service and after the decisive Battle of the  Boyne  in the Year he follow'd his Master's Fortune and by his Merit obtain'd a Captain's Commission in the Service of  Lewis  the Fourteenth but gaining a Pardon with many other Gentlemen in his Condition he came to  England  where he married Mrs  Daniel  Daughter to an eminent Citizen on  Fishstreethill  with whom he had a handsome Fortune By her he had a numerous Issue  Miss  Catharine  was born in the Year She had an early Genius for the Stage for she told me when she was about twelve Years old Miss  Johnson  afterwards the first Wife of Mr  Theo Cibber  another rising Genius if Death had not overtaken her in her Prime of Youth and she used to tag after the celebrated Mr  Wilks  her own Words whenever they saw him in the Streets and gape at him as a Wonder  Miss  Raftor  had a facetious Turn of Humour and infinite Spirits with a Voice and Manner in finging Songs of Pleasantry peculiar to herself Those Talents Mr  Theo Cibber  and I we all at that Time living together in one House thought a sufficient Pasport to the  Theatre  We recommended her to the  Laureat  whose infallible Judgment soon found out her Excellencies and the Moment he heard her sing put her down in the List of Performers at twenty Shillings  per  Week But never any Person of her Age flew to Perfection with such Rapidity and the old discerning Managers always distinguish'd Merit by Reward Her first Appearance was in the Play of  Mithridates  King of  Pontus  in  Ismenes  the Page to  Ziphares  in Boy's Cloaths where a Song proper to the Circumstances of the Scene was introduced which she performed with extraordinary Applause But after this like a Bullet in the Air there was no distinguishing the Track till it came to its utmost Execution  I remember the first Night of  Love in a Riddle  which was murdered in the same Year a  Pastoral Opera wrote by the  Laureat  which the Hydraheaded Multitude resolv'd to worry without hearing a Custom with Authors of Merit when Miss  Raftor  came on in the Part of  Phillida  the monstrous Roar subsided A Person in the Stage Box next to my Post called out to his Companion in the following elegant Stile  Zounds  Tom  take Care or this charming little Devil will save all  In the Year she was marry'd to Mr  G Clive  Son to Mr Baron  Clive  I shall be silent in conjugal Affairs but in all my long Acquaintance with her I could never imagine she deserved ill Usage  I shall take Leave of this excellent Actress with the following Lines as every Part cannot fit the best Performers  Merit mistaken oft may lose its Way  And pore in Darkness with the Blaze of Day  Mademoiselle CHATEAUNEUF  THIS agreeable Dancer as she play'd  Polly  in the  Beggars Opera  c must come under my Cognizance She was born in  France  what Town or Province has stole from my Memory Her real Name was not what she bore She was in her Infancy an Orphan and Monsieur  Chateauneuf  took her from her Distresses and bred her up as his own Daughter Her Virtue never was tainted in most  Peoples Opinion but as our immortal  Shakespear  says  Be thou as chaste as Ice as pure as Snow  Thou shalt not 'scape Calumny  When I was instructing her in the Part of  Polly  she told me a Lady that Morning was surprised to hear from a Gentleman of her Acquaintance that she was taken for a Boy in Disguise This Gentleman it seems was a Person that would have been very willing to have been certain of the Distinction of Sexes  I told the Lady  said Miss  Chateauneuf I was very glad he knew no more of me  Which I think was a quick and witty Answer She was born the same Day that our young Hero the  Duke  came into the World  April    Since leaving this Kingdom she is marry'd to her supposed Father Monsieur  Chateauneuf  and now it is made her real Name This Intelligence I had from a Gentleman that lately came from  Bourdeaux  'Tis possible every body cannot tell where  Bourdeaux  lies It is a very fine City and Seaport the Capital of the Province of  Guicnne  It is graced with a Parliament a University and an Archbishop seated on the fine River  Garonne  and is esteemed one of the richest trading Cities in  France Ausonius  a celebrated  Latin  Poet owes his Birth to this Place Most Lovers of  Bacchus  very much commend the Growth of its Grape One of our  English  Monarchs  Richard  the Second drew here his first Breath This Dukedom was once an Attendant upon the Crown of  England  as tack'd to the Tail of  Eleanor  Heiress of  Poictiers  wedded to King  Henry  the Second which is my chief Reason for this Scrap of  Geography  There is also a very handsome Theatre in this City and the Country exceeding pleasant about it being in the South of  France  where he conversed  with them being at the Head of a Troop of Comedians of their own where he heard Madem  Chateauneuf  sing several  English  Songs by Desire of the Audience particularly the Song of  Rosy Wine  from the Masque of  Comus  altered from  Milton  Thus Midwife Time brings many Things to Light  That long lay hid within the Womb of Night  Mrs CHETWOOD  SHE was upon this Stage in the Year an agreeable  Actress  when the Part suited her Voice a tolerable  Dancer  and a pleasing  Colombine  Being Granddaughter to the present  Laureat  'tis no Wonder if she had a little Wit  But Wit and Wisdom seldom well agree  Wisdom would fetter what the Wit would free  Mr  DENIS DELANE  IS a Native of  Ireland  descended from an antient Family He received his Education in  Trinity  College  Dublin  a Fountain of Learning whose Streams have watered the Universe  He appeared first on the  Dublin  Stage and was very well received his Person and excellent Voice joined with his other Merits gained him the Esteem as he justly deserved However he set out for  London  where he was recommended to the Managers of  DruryLane  I think in the Year but their Company being brimful even to the running over the Managers did not give him the Encouragement that the Promise of his Voice and Person deserved Mr  Giffard  took hold of the Occasion and engaged him for his Theatre in  Goodman  's  Fields  where he had a better Opportunity of shining without any Rival Ray Mr  Quin  as I am inform'd who can distinguish Merit from his own superior Judgment prevailed upon him to leave that Corner of the Town and act on the same Stage with him  CoventGarden  Persons of the  Drama  may be compared to the  SwissCantons  willing to fight for those who give the best Pay therefore it is no Novelty to see them change Sides  Mr  Delane  is now marching under the Banner of  CoventGarden  He has an Estate in this Kingdom and came over last Year tho' I had not the Pleasure of seeing him I am informed he is inclining more to the Bulky since I saw him last which is a Recommendation to many capital Parts that may sit easy and give Pleasure when the Bloom of Youth is gone  Truncheons or Lawn do seldom Youth become  For distant War or Bishopricks at Home  Mr DYER  IS not only a useful but a very pleasing Actor his good Voice and easyacquired Manner gives him a Cast above many of his Cotemporaries being the best allowed Singer on the  Dublin  Theatre that is not a profess'd Singer I am no Friend to  Mimicry  yet if I could be pleased with that natural Qualification if I may be allowed to call it so I do not know one could give me more Pleasure than Mr  Dyer  for he can  take off  as the Theatrical Term expresses it not only every Actor Male and Female he has seen and heard worth mimicking but also Singers and Dancers foreign and domestic All these Qualifications join'd to a good Understanding will render him acceptable in any Theatre  A just Behaviour claims a due Regard  Tho' Modesty will fail to meet Reward  THOMAS ELRINGTON  Esq  THIS excellent  Actor  was born in  June  in  London  His Father having a numerous Issue put his Son Apprentice to an Upholder in  CoventGarden  where I was first acquainted with him He was early addicted to the Drama I remember when he was an Apprentice we play'd in several private  Plays together when we were preparing to act  Sophonisba  or  Hannibal  's  Overthrow  after I had wrote out my Part of  Massiva  I carried him the Book of the Play to study the Part of King  Masinissa  I found him finishing a Velvet Cushion and gave him the Book but alas before he could secrete it his Master a hot voluble  Frenchman  came in upon us and the Book was thrust under the Velvet of the Cushion His Master as usual rated him for not working with a  Mortbleu why a you not vark  Tom and stood over him so long that I saw with some Mortification the Book irrecoverably stitch'd up in the Cushion never to be retriev'd till the Cushion is worn to Pieces Poor  Tom  cast many a desponding Look upon me when he was finishing the Fate of the Play while every Stitch went to both our Hearts His Master observing our Looks turn'd to me and with Words that broke their Necks over each other for Haste abused both of us The most intelligible of his great Number of Words were  Jack Pudenges  and the like Expressions of Contempt  But our Play was gone for ever Another time we were so bold to attempt  Shakespear  's  Hamlet  where our 'Prentice  Tom  had the Part of the  Ghost  Father to young  Hamlet  His Armour was composed of Pasteboard neatly painted The  Frenchman  had Intelligence of what we were about and to our great Surprize and Mortification made one of our Audience The Ghost in its first Appearance is dumb to  Horatio  While these Scenes past the  Frenchman  only muttered between his Teeth and we were in Hopes his Passion would subside but when our Ghost began his first Speech to  Hamlet Mark me  he reply'd  Begar me vil marke you presently  and without saying any more beat our poor Ghost off the Stage through the Street while every Stroke on the Pasteboard Armour grieved the Auditors because they did not pay for their Seats insomuch that three or four ran after the Ghost and brought him back in Triumph with the avenging  Frenchman  at his Heels who would not be appeas'd till our  Ghost  promised him never to commit the Offence of Acting again A Promise made like many others never intended to be kept However in the last Year of his Time his rigid Master gave him a little more Liberty and our young Actor play'd different Parts till he was taken Notice of by Mr  Keene  an excellent  Player  at that Time He was introduced upon the Stage in the Part of  Oroonoko  where he met with a good Reception in the Year  The next Season he was invited over by  Joseph Ashbury  Esq  and in the Year wedded the Daughter of that worthy Gentleman by whom he had a numerous Issue particularly three Sons who are now alive the eldest Mr  Joseph Elrington  who makes a considerable Figure on the present Theatre here Mr  Richard Elrington  now of a Country Company in  England  and Mr  Thomas Elrington  the youngest first an Ensign now a Lieutenant in Colonel  Flemming  's Regiment in  Flanders  Mr  Elrington  the Father was a true Copy of Mr  Verbruggen  a very great Actor in Tragedy and polite Parts in Comedy but the former had an infinite Fund of what is called Low Humour upon the Stage I have seen him perform Don  Cholerick  in the  Fop's Fortune  with infinite Pleasure he entered into the true Humour of the Character equal to the Original Mr  William Penkethman  His Voice was manly strong and sweetly fullton'd his Figure tall and wellproportion'd His eldest Son Mr  Joseph Elrington  is most like him in Person and Countenance  This excellent Player succeeded his Fatherinlaw  Joseph Ashbury  Esq  in the Place of Steward of the  King'sInns  and the more to establish him in the Kingdom a Post was given him of fifty Pounds a Year in the  QuitRent Office  also  Gunner  to the Train of Artillery a Gift of the Lord  Mountjoy  Father to the present Earl of  Blessington  which at the Death of that noble Lord he got Permission to dispose of He was a Gentleman of Honour Humanity and extensive Goodnature of a facetious well manner'd Conversation a little too desirable for his Health from Company of the best Condition He was taken ill the very Day he was consulting a Plan for a new Theatre after the Form of that in  DruryLane London  with an eminent Builder of this City He went home where his Malady increas'd to a violent  Pleuritic Fever which never left him notwithstanding all the Physicians Art till he expir'd  July    He was interr'd in  St Michan  's Churchyard near the Remains of his Fatherinlaw  Joseph Ashbury  Esq  Mr  Elrington  had one Daughter marry'd to Mr  Wrightson  now in  England  with a Country Company I never saw her but have been inform'd she has many promising Theatrical Talents    I shall leave him to eternal Rest with the following Lines and a short Epitaph  Thus when our stated Time of Life is come  And Pow'r Almighty has pronounc'd our Doom  The best Physician's Art is shewn in vain  And Death's the Doctor that must end our Pain  EPITAPH On THOMAS ELRINGTON  Esq  THOU best of Actors here interr'd  No more thy charming Voice is heard  This Grave thy Coarse contains  Thy better Part which us'd to move  Our Admiration and our Love  Has fled its sad Remains  Tho' there's no monumental Brass  Thy sacred Relicks to encase  Thou wond'rous Man of Art  A Lover of the Muse divine  O  Elrington  shall be thy Shrine  And carve thee in his Heart  Mr  FRANCIS ELRINGTON  WAS born in  London  in the Year  He had a small Post in the Wardrobe under his Grace the Duke of  Montague  but hearing the Success of his elder Brother in  Ireland  he left his Post to follow the Call he had to the Stage By his Theatrical Observations in  England  he set out in  Ireland  with Success improving his Talents so well that he gave the utmost Satisfaction in many capital Parts His Grace the Duke of  Dorset  when Lord Lieutenant of  Ireland  gave him a Post in the Revenue which he faithfully executed and enjoy'd to his Death  He was in a languishing State of Health near two Years but the last Stroke he received at  Kilkenny  where Part of the Company were playing during the Time of the Camp being at  Bennet'sBridge  he was carried back to his House in  Drumcondralane  where after a few Days Struggle Death overcame him in  August  in the d Year of his Age of a  Polypus  A  Polypus  is an Excrescence or fleshy fungous Substance that grows in or about the Heart a slow but certain Death This Distemper is sometimes found in the thick Membrane of the Brain which proves fatal This Disease often seizes the Nose and other hollow Parts of the Body fixing its Fibres like the Root of a Plant which must be cut off and intirely eradicated or it will grow again  How many Ways has proud imperious Death  To plunder storm and steal away our Breath  to the Regret of all his Acquaintance  Mr RALPH ELRINGTON  IS the younger Brother of the late eminent Player  Thomas Elrington  Esq  born in  England  and came early upon the Stage tho' without any Countenance as I have been inform'd from his Friends and Relations Since his elder Brother's Death he has undertaken many of his Parts which he copies as near as possible  He was admired some Years ago as a good executing  Harlequin  Agility and Strength being two main Ingredients in the Composition of that motly Gentleman where  Heels  are of more Use than the  Head  In one of his Feats of Activity he was much hurt and was in some Danger of breaking his Neck to please the Spectators the Ears having little to do in such Entertainments yet this unlucky Spring met with universal Applause  I remember a Tumbler in the  Haymarket  Theatre in  London  by such an Accident beat the Breath out of his Body which raised such vociferous Applause that lasted longer than the vent'rous Man's Life for he never breathed more Indeed his Wife had this Comfort  when the Truth was known Pity succeeded to the Roar of Applause  Another Accident like this fell out in Dr  Faustus  a Pantomime Entertainment in  Lincoln'sInnFields  Theatre where a Machine in the Working broke threw the mock  Pierrot  down headlong with such Force that the poor Man broke a Plank on the Stage with his Fall and expired Another was so sorely maimed that he did not survive many Days and a third one of the softer Sex broke her Thigh But to prevent such Accidents for the future those Persons are represented by inanimate Figures so that if they break a Neck a Leg or an Arm there needs no Surgeon  Another Accident of the same Kind happened in  Smockalley  which gave me much Concern as having a Hand in the Contrivance The late Mr  Morgan  being to fly on the Back of a Witch in the  Lancashire Witches  thro' the Ignorance of the Workers in the Machinery the Fly broke and they both fell together but thro' Providence they neither of them were much hurt and such Care was taken afterwards that no Accident of that Kind  could  happen  When Danger's fled it dwells upon the Mind  And leaves the strong Impression still behind  Mr RICHARD ESTCOURT  THIS excellent Comedian was born at  Tewksbury  in the County of  Gloucester  in the Year where he received his Education in the  Latin  School of that Town He had an early Desire for the Stage for in the th Year of his Age he stole from his Father's House with a Country Company and at  Worcester  for fear of being known set out with the Part of  Roxana  in Woman's Apparel in  Alexander the Great  but his Father having Notice of it sent to secure the Fugitive who made his Escape in a Suit of Woman's Cloaths that he borrowed of one of the Itinerant Ladies and trudg'd it to  ChippingNorton  a Corporationtown in  Oxfordshire  twentyfive long Miles in one Day When he came to the Inn Beds were scarce and he was obliged to take up with that of the Daughter's behind the Bar The young Woman going to Bed found the wearied Traveller in a profound Sleep but observing the Shirt instead of a Shift she began to suspect her design'd Bedfellow and stooping to look on the Dress that lay upon the Ground she saw a Pair of Man's Shoes under the Bed that convinced her she might have been in an odd Situation if she had gone to Bed in the Dark She upon the Discovery instantly called in the People of the House and waked our drowsy Traveller The  Landlord had designed to carry him decently to the Horsepond till  Dick  made a true Confession of the whole Affair By Accident a Person of the Town of  Tewksbury  put up at the said Inn that Night who knew our young disguised Wanderer and that Knowlege signed his Pardon In two Days afterwards his Cloaths were brought him from  Worcester  accompanied with a Messenger from his Father who led him the Road home again  Soon after the Father went with him to  London  where he bound him fast to an Apothecary in  Hattongarden  He was too impatient to wait so long a Time for Liberty therefore he stretched his Bonds till they broke and after an  itinerant  Life two Years in  England  he went to try his Fortune in  Ireland  where he shone in an exalted theatrical Sphere for some Years when he returned to  London  where by his Wit and mimic Humour his Conversation was taken up by Persons of the highest Rank and Parts  He was made Providore of the  BeefStakeClub  and for a Mark of Distinction wore their Badge which was a small Gridiron of Gold hung about his Neck with a green silk Ribband This Club was compos'd of the chief Wits and great Men of the Nation  Mr  Estcourt  was the original Serjeant  Kite  and every Night of Performance entertained the Audience with Variety of little Catches and Flights of Humour that pleased all but his  Critics  He was a great Favourite with  the late Duke of  Marlborough  whose just Fame he celebrated in several outofthe way witty Ballads He was Author of a Comedy called  The Wife's Excuse or Cuckolds make themselves  and acted at the TheatreRoyal in the Year but as I have been informed with moderate Success Another little Piece was produced by him call'd  Prunella  a Burlesque upon the  Italian Operas  then stole into Fashion too much supported by the excellent Voice and Judgment of Mrs  Tofts  But such an odd MedleyMrs  Tofts  a mere  Englishwoman  in the Part of  Camilla  courted by  Nicolini  in  Italian  without understanding one single Syllable each other  said  or  sung  and on the other Hand  Valentini  courting amorously in the same Language a  Dutchwoman  that committed Murder on our good old  English  with as little Understanding as a  Parrot  Though it was reported a Lady of some Quality fell desperately in Love with  Nicolini  which occasioned the following Lines that were pinn'd to  Nicolini  's Coat in a Chocolatehouse  Soft thrilling Notes swell'd out with Art  May wound alas the fair one's Heart  Yet these  Italians  will not feel  The Wounds  they  give they cannot heal  Yet notwithstanding the Lashes given by  Estcourt  and others the enervating Weakness took more Hold like Folly and new Sects in  Religion Persecution but gains more Proselytes  This celebrated Comedian paid his Debt to Nature in the Year after leaving the Stage some Years Sir  Richard Steele  gives him this Character in his Lucubrations "An excellent Companion one who was perfectly Master of wellturned Compliments as well as smart Repartees which shews a ready Wit  The first Account of this eminent Performer I had from the late Mr  John Bowman  an Actor more than Half an Age on the  London Theatres  This Gentleman was born in the Year and died in the Year I have often heard him say he never remember'd that any Indisposition retarded his coming to the Theatre during his long Course of Life and this Declaration was made not a Month before he died He never met with Contempt in the latter Part of his Life and we may end with two Lines in  Jane Shore  Age sat with decent Grace upon his Visage  And worthily became his silver Locks  "  Mr JOHN EVANS  THIS Person was an Actor of very good Repute in this Kingdom join'd in the Management with Mr  Thomas Elrington  Mr  Thomas Griffith  c His Person was inclineable to the Gross therefore wanted Delicacy for the amiable Parts he had an excellent harmonious Voice and just Delivery but a little too indolent for much Study or Contemplation  In the last Year of the Reign of Queen  Anne  the Company of  Dublin  went down in the Summer Season to play at  Corke  One Evening Mr  Evans  was invited by some Officers of a Regiment then on Duty in that City to a Tavern Many Healths were propos'd and went round without Reluctance when it came to Mr  Evans  's Turn he proposed the Health of her Majesty Queen  Anne  which so much disgusted one of the Company tho' cloath'd in the Livery of his Royal Mistress that he ran down Stairs and sent up a Drawer to whisper Mr  Evans  who immediately put on his Sword and went after him without taking the least Notice to the Company He found his Antagonist in a Room in the Passage of the Tavern with the Door half open who courageously made a Thrust at Mr  Evans  which he put by with his left Hand at this Mr  Evans  drew thrust the Door wide open enter'd and soon drove his Opposer out to the Passage where he disarmed the doughty Hero before the Company above Stairs knew any thing of the Matter The rest of the military Gentlemen expressed an Abhorrence to the Treatment Mr  Evans  received and seemingly reconciled them on the Spot but notwithstanding when the Company return'd to  Dublin  the Person who sent the Challenge up Stairs at  Corke  being then returned also told his own Story in such a Manner that several warm Gentlemen of the Army were made to believe that Mr  Evans  had affronted the whole Body Military and when the  poor suppos'd Culprit came to his Business of the Theatre their Clamour in the Audience was so great that the House was dismiss'd and no Play to be acted till Mr  Evans  had asked public Pardon upon the Stage His high Spirit was with great Difficulty brought to submit but at last he consented I remember the Play was  The Rival Queens or The Death of Alexander the Great  the Part of  Alexander  to be acted by the Delinquent He came to ask Pardon before the Curtain When he address'd the Audience one Smart from the Pit cried out  Kneel you Rascal Evans  then collected in himself replied in the same Tone of Voice  No you Rascal I'll kneel to none but God and my Queen  A dangerous Paroxysm at such a Crisis However as there were many worthy Gentlemen of the Army who knew the whole Affair the newrais'd Clamour ceas'd and the Play went through without any Molestation and by Degrees Things return'd to their proper Chanel By this we may see it is some Danger for an Actor to be in the right  Three Years after this Affair Mr  Evans  went to the Theatre in  Lincoln'sInnFields  and in his Journey back to  Ireland  was taken ill of a Fever at the Town of  Whitchurch  in  Shorpshire  from whence he was removed for better Advice to  Chester  where he ended his Progress of Life in the st Year of his Age and was privately buried in the Cathedral without Monument Stone or Inscription  Thus may great Merit in Oblivion lie  And rest forgotten to Eternity  Mr WILLIAM ESTE  THIS Gentleman was related to the late Bishop of  Waterford  He died in the Prime of Youth in the Year 'Tis a Pity he took such Pains in getting the better of his Constitution but he succeeded at a Time when he might have made some Figure on the Stage He had Qualifications sufficient for Improvement some Learning a Person amiable a sweet Voice and sung not unpleasingly Notwithstanding the Neglect of himself depreciated his Merit He truly made out a Saying of that late great Comedian Mr  Wilks  "The Man that drinks a Glass of strong Liquor in a Morning for every one he swallows drives a Nail in his Coffin" Many a Genius has been drown'd in Drink I remember an Author whose sweet Writings will keep his Memory fragrant that was so much addicted to that Weakness that if there were no other Spirits to be come at he would empty a Lady's  Hungary  Waterbottle and yet the flowing Numbers of his Pen seem'd as if he had drank no other Liquid but what came from the pure Streams of  Helicon  I shall end this with  Shakespear  's Reflection from the Mouth of  Cassio in Othello  O that Men should put an Enemy in their Mouths to steal away their Brains O thou invisible Spirit of Wine if thou hast no Name to be known by let us call thee Devil  He died of a lingering Illness the th of  January    Mrs ELMY  HER maiden Name was  Mors  She was born in  England  but  when  or  where  I know not  Mr  Elmy  her Husband I know was born at  Norwich  but where he is now I believe neither she nor I can tell  She has been an Actress about seventeen Years  began  very young and was  enter'd  first in a Country Company She knows what she  does  as well as what she  says  She seems to have more Spirits  off  the Stage in a Chamber than she has  in  the public Theatre which is owing to her weak Voice but she means very well  there  I do not know her well enough to be any Judge of her Morals therefore I shall not speak of what I do not  know  and even this I have gathered more from  common  Fame than my own particular Knowlege Therefore I shall not say any more of her as Fame is a Gossip not always to be believed as  Hudibras  tells us  There is a tall longsided Dame  But wond'rous light ycleped  Fame  Two Trumpets she does sound at once  But both of clean contrary Tones  But whether both with the same Wind  Or one before or one behind  We know notonly this can tell  The one sounds vilely t'other well  And therefore vulgar Authors name  The one  Good  t'other  Evil Fame  Mr GEORGE FARQUHAR  SINCE this Gentleman owes his Birth to this Kingdom and on the  Irish  Stage commenced Actor I hope it will not be thought improper to give a short Account of him which I shall take from his Life that I collected several Years past to prefix to his Works The Materials I received from Mr  Wilks  who approved of them before they went to the Publisher  Mr  George Farquhar  was born in the North of  Ireland  of Parents that held no mean Rank in that Part of the Country who having a numerous Issue could bestow on him no other Fortune than a genteel Education As those who are bless'd with a poetical Genius always shew some Glimmerings of their Fancy in their Youth so he ere he arriv'd at his tenth Year gave several Specimens of a peculiar Turn that Way One of his juvenile Productions I shall here mention in which he discovered a Way  of Thinking as well as an Elegancy of Expression far beyond his Years  I took these Lines of Verse from the Mouth of Mr  Wilks  The pliant Soul of erring Youth  Is like soft Wax or moisten'd Clay  Apt to receive all heav'nly Truth  Or yield to Tyrant Ill the Sway  Shun Evil in your early Years  And Manhood may to Virtue rise  But he who in his Youth appears  A Fool in Age will ne'er be wise  He was educated in the University of  Dublin  where he acquired a considerable Reputation He began very early to apply himself to the Stage as an  Actor  following the Examples of  Lee  and  Otway  with our great  Shakespear  and with like Success who tho' all excellent dramatic Poets made but indifferent Actors However Mr  Farquhar  having the Advantage of a very good Person tho' with a weak Voice was never repulsed by the Audience but the following Accident made him determine to leave off the Occupation Playing the Part of  Guyomar  in the  Indian Emperor  who is supposed to kill  Vasquez  one of the  Spanish  Generals not remembring to change his Sword for a  Foil  Foils  are the Name of those Swords us'd in the  Theatre  with the Edges ground off and a blunted Point  in the Mock Engagement he wounded the Person that represented  Vasquez  tho' as it  fell out not dangerously nevertheless it put an End to his appearing on the Stage as an Actor  He was very young when he wrote his first Comedy of  Love and a Bottle  acted at the Theatre Royal in  Drurylane  He was peculiarly happy in the Choice of his Subjects which he took Care to adorn with Variety of Characters and Incidents He lash'd the Vices of the Age tho' with a merciful Hand His Plays were wrote in the following Order  Love and a Bottle  The Constant Couple This Piece was play'd Nights the first Season  Sir  Harry Wildair  the Sequel to the former Nights  Inconstant or The Way to Win Him Nights  Twin Rivals Nights  Recruiting Officer Nights  The Beaux Stratagem Nights  All acted at the TheatreRoyal in  Drurylane  His last Comedy he wrote in six Weeks with a settled Illness all the Time He perceived the Approaches of Death before he had finish'd the last Act and as he had often foretold died before the Run of the Play was over It was affirm'd by some of his near Acquaintance his unfortunate Marriage shorten'd his Days for his Wife by whom he had two Daughters through the Reputation of a great Fortune trick'd him into Matrimony This was chiefly  the Fault of her Love which was so violent that she was resolv'd to use all Arts to gain him Tho' some Husbands in such a Case would have proved mere Husbands yet he was so much charm'd with her Love and Understanding that he liv'd very happy with her Therefore when I say an unfortunate Marriage with other Circumstances conduced to the shortening of his Days I only mean that his Fortune being too slender to support a Family led him into a great many Cares and Inconveniencies For I have often heard him say  Mr  Wilks  's own Words    That it was more Pain to him in imagining that his Family might want a needful Support than the most violent Death that could be inflicted on him  Mr  Farquhar  was a Person of infinite Humour as I have been inform'd even in his last Indisposition He died in the Run of the  Stratagem  Mr  Wilks  often visited him in his Illness In one of these Visits Mr  Wilks  told Mr  Farquhar  that Mrs  Oldfield  thought he had dealt too freely with the Character of Mrs  Sullen  in giving her to  Archer  without a proper Divorce which was not a Security for her Honour  To salve that  reply'd the Author  I'll get a real DivorceMarry her myself and give her my Bond she shall be a real Widow in less than a Fortnight  While Mr  Farquhar  was in  Trinity  College  Dublin  he sent to a Gentleman to borrow  Burnet  's  History of the Reformation  but the Gentleman sent him Word he never lent any Book out of his Chamber but if he would come there he should make use of it as long as he pleas'd A little While after the Owner of the Book sent to borrow Mr  Farquhar  's Bellows he return'd him the Compliment  I never lend my Bellows out of my own Chamber but if he pleas'd to come there be should make use of them as long as he would  When he expir'd Mr  Wilks  took Care to bury him decently in  St Martin in the Fields  Among his Papers he found this short Note  Dear Bob  I have not any thing to leave thee to perpetuate my Memory but two helpless Girls look upon them sometimes and think of him that was to the last Moments of his Life Thine  G FARQUHAR"  Even the two last Lines he ever wrote seem'd to be playing with Words  Death  now appears to seize my latest Breath  But all my Miseries will end in  Death  Mr  Farquhar  attempted to play the Part of Sir  Harry Wildair  for his own Benefit as I am inform'd from a Gentleman that saw him in this Kingdom which answer'd his Design in gaining a crouded Audience but he executed the Part so lamely as an Actor that his Friends were asham'd for him Thus we see a  good  Poet may make but an  indifferent  Actor    The Mind diseas'd strikes Poison to the Heart  And baffles all the best Physician's Art  Mr FOOTE  AS I never had the Fortune to be present at this Gentleman's public Performance I cannot pretend to be a competent Judge of his Merit tho' I must own I have heard him launch out into  Mimicry  which might perhaps give Pleasure to others but I must own very little to me  I remember an Instance of this kind of  Satire  in my Youth that gave Satisfaction to some light Hearts but greater Disgust to the more judicious Sort of the Audience  Mr  George Powell  a reputable Actor with many Excellencies gave out that he would perform the Part of Sir  John Falstaff  in the Manner of that very excellent  English Roscius  Mr  Betterton  He certainly hit his Manner and Tone of Voice yet to make the Picture more like he mimick'd the Infirmities of Distemper old Age and the afflicting Pains of the Gout which that great Man was often seiz'd with Certainly  Mimicry  is a Gift from Nature and laudable if made use of like the antient  Mimes  who could dumbly describe every Passion of the Mind and tell a  Tale  without a  Tongue  But to mimic the Infirmities of Nature may well be term'd Incivility Barbarity and Inhumanity  I remember  D'Urfey  the late  Lyric  Poet stuttered extremely when in a Passion tho' he could speak an Oration read a Scene in a Play or sing any of his own Songs or Dialogues without the least Hesitation He came one Morning to the Rehearsal a little disturbed about a depending Benefit Play and ask'd in a Passion  Wh wh where wa wa was M M Mr  Wi Wilks The Drole  Penkethman  answered  H h he d d did n n not kn kn know  But the choleric Poet broke his Head for his Joke and it was with great Difficulty the Bard was appeased  Mimicry  as it now stands with us is like a Statue larger than the Life made for a certain Height and Distance while upon the Level with you its coarse Proportion seems monstrous and overdone Many excellent Comedians have had this natural Talent Mr  Rymer  that great Critic tells us that Mr  Mountford  was so excellently gifted that Way if we may call it Excellence that when he was Trainbearer to the late Chancellor  Jefferies  in the Reign of King  James  the Second at an Entertainment for the most eminent Lawyers his Master ordered him to come before him and plead a feigned Cause which he perform'd with great Eloquence and in his Pleadings to the Admiration of all present assum'd the Manner and Voice of several of the best Pleaders then at the  Bar  even some of those that were present at the Entertainment As I said before every thing of this kind must be overdone to make it the more ridiculous and Actors of great Merit  thus  mimick'd are liable to some little Disgrace which is neither Justice nor Goodnature I have seen Faces painted in a Scene of a Multitude which is generally used in  Drury lane  Theatre at the Coronation of  Anna Bullen  that make most ridiculous Figures so like to be known and yet the Persons they represent have nothing particularly faulty in their Countenance or Figures But the Painter was a merry  Italian  Wag and did it to shew his exuberant Fancy  But to return to Mr  Foote  He is a Gentleman of a good Family and seems to have some Claim to the Estate of the  Goodieres  One of that Family was not many Years past murdered by his own Brother at  Bristol  I believe he has  Merit  or a  Wou'dbeWit  would not have publish'd the following Lines in the Newspapers For I have observed those that have Merit are generally liable to bespattering Defamation However here are the Lines  On a PseudoPlayer  THOU Mimic of  Cibber  of  Garrick  thou Ape  Thou Fop in  Othello  thou Cypher in Shape  Thou Trifle in Person thou Puppet in Voice  Thou Farce of a Player thou Rattle for

Gentleman any Prejudice For Passion is the worst Persuader in the World For as the Poet says  Truth is too naked of all Art bereav'd  Since the World willwhylet them be deceiv'd  Mrs FURNIVAL  I Cannot tell when Mrs  Furnival  first commenced Actress but I know her Reputation for a Stageperformer was so great that a Person of high Birth and Station who had seen her act several capital Parts at the Theatre in  York  prevail'd on the Manager of  Drurylane  to send for her in the Year Accordingly I received a Commission for that Purpose which she approved of The first Part she acted at her Arrival in  London  was that of the  Scornful Lady  in a Comedy of  Beaumont  and  Fletcher  's that bears the Title I own it was a Character of my own choosing and for no other Reason but that the Play had slept since the Death of the inimitable Mrs  Oldfield  The Success did not intirely answer the Meaning of my Intention tho' she acquitted herself so well that there was a very good Actress in Prospect But the Parts in Tragedy were so taken up that her Talent that Way was never once try'd in the TheatreRoyal in  Drurylane  Therefore by the Advice of the same worthy Gentleman that was the Cause of her leaving  York  for  London  she left  London  for  Dublin  where her Merit was so conspicuous that her Loss is much regretted She is once more returned to  England  I believe without any other Advice but her own yet I fear she will be remember'd here till a better  Alicia  in  Jane  Shore  Lady  Macbeth Hermione  in the  Distress'd Mother  or  Zara  in the  Mourning Bride  with many other Parts rises up to outdo her  But what at first gives infinite Delight  When often seen hangs heavy on the Sight  DAVID GARRICK  Esq  THIS complete Actor was born in  Staffordshire  of an antient Family in that County had a genteel Education and was by his Father design'd for the Law I doubt not from his good Sense and Affability if he had continued in that honourable Society in  Lincoln'sInn  but he might have made a considerable Figure at the Bar and by his Elocution walk'd in the foremost Rank of eminent Orators  His Genius led him early to study Nature and leave the crabbed Tracts of the Law His facetious good Humour gained him Entrance behind the Scenes two or three Years in  Drurylane  before he commenced Actor where his excellent Understanding could profit by the Faults of others mend them and improve the Beauties  In the Year he set out in full Lustre at the Theatre in  Goodman'sFields  with the Part of  Richard  the Third and by the Force of Attraction drew even the Court to the  farthest Suburbs of  London  After making that remote Part of the Town as familiar to Courtiers and Quality as  Wapping  to Sailors he came with a Blaze of Light to  Drurylane  where he began with an Act of Charity worthy of his Humanity and Goodness by assisting the Widow of Mr  Harper  with a Sum that by good Management will make her Circumstances easy the rest of her Life She was at  Kilkenny  the Place of her Birth two Summers ago where I received this Account from her own Mouth The Part he perform'd was  Chamont  in the  Orphan  When this Gentleman was in this Kingdom last I was unfortunately seized by a stubborn Indisposition and his Goodnature prevailed upon the eminent Dr  Barry  to give me his Assistance But what need I repeat to those that are not blind that the Sun shines in Summer I shall end with two Copies of Verses that were printed at his first Arrival in the Newspapers at that Time  On Mr GARRICK  Cur in Theatrum  Cato  severe venisti  An ideo tantum veneras ut exires  MART  IN  Roman  Days once  Cato  the severe  With awful Brow went to the Theatre  But O instead of manly Fire and Rage  And all the true Pathetic of the Stage  He saw he heard the Rant the Droll the Stare  Saw Nature and the Passions murder'd there  Saw and retir'dBut shou'd he now revive  And see glad Nature in her  Garrick  live  He'd laugh at  Bayes  and weep with injur'd  Lear  Curse Tyrant  Richard  but applaud the Player  By Joy Rage Pity all the Passions mov'd  Garrick wou'd well by  Cato  be approv'd  The Wise the Virtuous  Cato  wou'd forbear  His rigid Censures and in Raptures swear  That by some Pow'r Divine the Stage was trod  And in the matchless Actor own the God  This great Actor is Author of Three Dramatic Pieces the  Lying Valet Miss in her Teens  and  Lethe  as also several wellwrote Prologues Epilogues Songs and Poems of a peculiar Turn of Wit I shall take Leave to insert one Song as a Specimen  To SYLVIA  IF Truth can fix thy wav'ring Heart  Let  Damon  urge his Claim  He feels the Passion void of Art  The pure and constant Flame  Tho' sighing Swains their Torments tell  Their sensual Love contemn  They only prize the beauteous Shell  But slight the inward Gem  Possession cures the wounded Heart  Destroys the transient Fire  But when the  Mind  receives the Dart  Enjoyment whets Desire  Your Charms each slavish Sense controul  A Tyrant's shortliv'd Reign  But milder Reason rules the Soul  Nor Time can break the Chain  By Age your Beauties will decay  Your Mind improves with Years  And when the Blossoms fade away  The rip'ning Fruit appears  May Heav'n and  Sylvia  grant my Suit  And bless each future Hour  That  Damon  who can taste the Fruit  May gather ev'ry Flow'r  THOMAS GRIFFITH  Esq  IS descended from an antient Family in  Wales  His Parents came to settle in  Dublin  where this Son was born in the Year He was put 'Prentice to a Mathematical Instrumentmaker but a livelyspirited Genius made him cast his Thoughts towards the Theatre when he saw a young Actress that had sufficient Charms to engage his Heart The Passion of Love is not to be controuled in Youth He marry'd her before he had serv'd a Third Part of his Time quitting his Mathematical Master and bent his Thoughts intirely to the Drama His Talent led him to Comedy of the merry Cast in which he gave great Pleasure to the Audience  His Wit and facetious Humour gained him many Friends of the best Sort and superior Rank In the Year the late Lord  Southwell  gave him a Post in the Revenue which he enjoyed till Death which fell out in  January  in his grand Climacteric two Days before the Night of his Benefit which was performed for the Widow his second Wife who was Daughter to the Rev Mr  Foxcroft  of  Portarlington  in the  Queen's County  a Gentlewoman of Merit and Virtue  Mr  Griffith  was not only a good Actor but a pleasing Poet in what he attempted His Person was well made tho' low in Stature I have seen a Bill of mock  Alexander  runs thus  The Part of  Alexander the Great  to be perform'd by  little Griffith  He was an excellent Companion and told a Story with a peculiar Grace and would often tell little Histories of  himself  even in Ridicule of  himself  I shall mention one I had from his own Mouth  After his commencing Actor he contracted a Friendship with Mr  Wilks  which Chain remained unbroke till the Death of that excellent Comedian Tho' Mr  Griffith  was very young Mr  Wilks  took him with him to  London  and had him enter'd for that Season at a small Salary The  Indian Emperor  being ordered on a sudden to be play'd the Part of  Pizarro  a  Spaniard  was wanting which Mr  Griffith  procur'd with some Difficulty Mr  Betterton  being a little indisposed would not venture out to Rehearsal for Fear of increasing his Indisposition to the Disappointment of the Audience who had not seen our young Stripling rehearse But when he came ready at the Entrance his Ears were pierc'd with a Voice not familiar to him He cast his Eyes upon the Stage where he beheld the diminutive  Pizarro  with a Truncheon as long as himself his own Words He steps up to  Downs  the Prompter and cry'd  Zounds  Downs  what sucking Scaramouch have you sent on there Sir  reply'd  Downs He's good enough for a  Spaniard  the Part is small Betterton  return'd  If he had made his Eyebrows his Whiskers and each Whisker a Line the Part would have been two Lines too much for such a Monkey in Buskins  Poor  Griffith  stood on the Stage near the Door and heard every Syllable of the short Dialogue and by his Fears knew who was meant by it but happy for him he had no more to speak that Scene When the first Act was over by the Advice of  Downs  he went to make his Excuse with  Indeed Sir I had not taken the Part but there was only I alone out of the Play I I  reply'd  Betterton  with a Smile  Thou art but the Tittle of an I Griffith  seeing him in no ill Humour told him  Indians  ought to be the best Figures on the Stage as Nature had made them  Very like  reply'd  Betterton but it would be a double Death to an  Indian  Cobler to be conquer'd by such a Weazle of a  Spaniard  as thou art And after this Night let me never see a Truncheon in thy Hand again unless to stir the Fire  This Story as I said before was of his own telling However he took his Advice laid aside the  Buskin  and stuck to the  Sock  in which he made a Figure equal to most of his Cotemporaries  Our Genius flutters with the Plumes of Youth  But Observation wings to steddy Truth  Mr HENRY GIFFARD  THIS Gentleman is descended from an antient Family originally in  Buckinghamshire  His Father had a numerous Issue he being the last of Eight Sons He was born in  London  in In the Year he was made a Clerk to the  SouthSea  Company in which Post he remained Three Years But having a strong Propensity to the Stage he first appeared in Public on the Theatre in  Bath  in and in two Years Probation he made such a Progress that the Manager of  Lincoln'sInnFields  Theatre invited him to join his Company where he continued two Years more From thence he went to try his Fortune in  Ireland  where his Merit soon brought him into the Management  During his Stay there he marry'd the Daughter of Mr and Mrs  Lydal  Persons that made very good Figures in the Theatre This Gentlewoman died in Childbed very young leaving behind her one Son born in his Father's House on the  NorthStrand  who is now an Actor in this Kingdom Some Years after Mr  Giffard  marry'd a second Wife who is now alive She has an amiable Person and is a wellesteemed Actress both in Tragedy and Comedy born if am not misinformed by her Mother the Widow  Lydal  in the Year  Mr  Giffard  and Spouse if I mistake not came over to  England  where they supported a Company of Comedians then under the Management of Mr  Odell  now DeputyLicenser of Plays under the Lord Chamberlain his Grace the Duke of  Grafton  Mr  Odell  from not understanding the Management of a Company as indeed how should any one that is not in some sort brought up to that Knowlege soon left it to Mr  Giffard  that did who in the Year caused to be built an intire new beautiful convenient Theatre by the same Architect with that of  CoventGarden  where Dramatic Pieces were performed with the utmost Elegance and Propriety Some Years after he was obliged to quit that Theatre I may say by Oppression and occupy'd the vacant Theatre in  Lincoln'sInnFields  But his Success did not answer his Merit From thence he transplanted himself into the TheatreRoyal in  DruryLane  Merit will sometimes fail of due Regard  And Virtue's Self must be its own Reward  Mr BENJAMIN HUSBAND  WAS born in  Pembrokeshire January  His Ancestors were an antient and reputable Family long seated in that County He fell in Love with the Tragic Muse very young but dangled after the Drama  full two Years sighing at great Expence before he was suffered to declare his Passion publicly Yet certainly he possessed most of the Requisites that compound a good Actor to assure Success But the Managers of those Theatrical Days were very cautious in their Proceedings no Persons were fit for  their  Stages without a visible Appearance at least of not displeasing And yet it was with some Difficulty he gained Permission to personate Sir  Walter Ralegh  in the  Earl of Essex  but he came off so well that the following PayDay he received a Week's Salary the usual Stipend of young Actors Ten Shillings a Week but unluckily the Death of good Queen  Mary  put a Stop to their Acting for near Six Months However when Permission was given to open the Theatres again Mr  Husband  soon gained better Parts and a larger Salary  In the Year Mr  Dogget  This truly great Comedian was born in  Castlestreet Dublin  a Circumstance overlook'd by the  Laureat  He left his Occupation as an Actor several Years before his Death and in his Will bequeathed to  WatermensHall  a Sum for ever sufficient to buy a Coat and Silver Badge to be row'd for on the  Thames  by 'Prentices every Year that have fulfilled their Indentures A humorous Poet wrote the following Lines upon the Occasion on a Glass Window at  Lambeth  the First of  August    Tom Dogget  the greatest sly Drole in his Parts  In Acting was certain a Master of Arts  A Monument leftno Herald is fuller  His Praise is sung yearly by many a  Sculler  Ten thousand Years hence if the World lasts so long  Tom Dogget  will still be the Theme of their  Song  Old Noll  with great  Lewis  and  Bourbon  forgot  And numberless Kings in Oblivion shall rot  being then in  Ireland  recommended Mr  Husband  to  Mr  Ashbury  as a very promising young Actor and fit for his Purpose He set out from  London  with Mr  Trefusis  I have mentioned  Jo Trefusis  before but shall add something here which I have learn'd from Mr  Husband Jo  was reputed the natural Son of  Oliver Cromwell  but I must own he did not seem to have any Resemblance of Features with his Father if we may judge by the Pictures and Gravings of the Protector  Jo  had a long Chin and naturally a most consummate foolish Face by Nature formed for suitable Characters yet a Person of infinite Humour and shrewd Conceits with a particular Tone of Voice and Manner that gave a double Satisfaction to what he said Adhering strictly to Honesty without Guile or Falshood which I suppose he inherited from his Mother he acquired the Appellative from all that knew him of  Honest Jo  A Character he bore with Justice  Jo  by the following Account of himself must have been very young on the Stage He entered a Volunteer on board the Ship where the Duke of  York  commanded in the Chanel in that memorable SeaEngagement with the  Dutch  Fleet commanded I think by  Van Tromp  in the Year When the Preparations were making for the Battle  Jo  tho' a Volunteer confess'd Fear began to invade him but when the Man at the Topmast Head cry'd a  Sail  then two  Sail  and after  Zounds a whole Wood Jo  's Terrors augmented But his Fears came to the full Height when a Sailor ask'd him If he had not performed on the Stage  Jo  reply'd in the Affirmative  Why then  reply'd the blunt Tarr  Tomorrow if you are not kill'd the first Broadside by Gd you will see the deepest and bloodiest Tragedy you ever saw in your Life  Jo  was so inimitable in dancing the Clown that General  Ingoldsby  was so well pleased that he sent him Five Guineas from the Box where he sat  Jo  dressed himself next Day and went to the Castle to return Thanks The General was hard to be persuaded it was the same Person but  Jo  soon convinc'd him by saying  Ise the very Mon an't please your Excellencey  and at the same time twirling his Hat as he did in the Dance with his consummate foolish Face and Scrape  Nay now I am convinced  reply'd the General laugh+ing  and thou shalt not show such a Face for nothing here  So gave  Jo  Five Guineas more which so well please him that he paid his Compliments in his aukward clownish Manner and as  Shakespear  says  Set the Table on a Roar  So Exit  Jo  and embarked for  Ireland  and was at Sea in that violent Storm when Brigadier  Fitzgerald  was cast away in the PacketBoat near  Hoath  where every Souperished but the Master of the Vessel However after much Difficulty and great Danger he landed safe in  Dublin  Mr  Husband  continued on the Stage with great Reputation as an Actor and a Gentleman of exact Conduct An Example truly worthy imitating  He afterwards passed and repassed from  England  to  Ireland  several Times till in the Year he was settled in this Kingdom for I believe the remaining Part of his Days fix'd in the Esteem of all that know him  The Lees of Life with Chearfulness he wears  And from an upright Mind no Death he fears  Mr CHARLES HULET  THIS Person performed one Season on the  Dublin  Stage He was born in the Year and was by his Father put 'Prentice to a Bookseller By reading of Plays in his Master's Shop he us'd to repeat Speeches in the Kitchen in the Evening to the Destruction of many a Chair which he substituted in the Room of real Persons in his Drama One Night as he was repeating the Part of  Alexander  with his wooden Representative of  Clytus  an old ElbowChair and coming to the Speech where the old General is to be kill'd this young mock  Alexander  snatch'd a  Poker  instead of a  Javelin  and threw it with such Strength against poor  Clytus  that the Chair was kill'd upon the Spot and lay mangled on the Floor The Death of  Clytus  made a monstrous Noise which disturbed the Master in the Parlour who called out to know the Reason and was answered by the Cook below  Nothing Sir but that  Alexander  has kill'd  Clytus  His Master Mr  Edmund Curll  Mr  Curll  was a Person of extraordinary Talents very pleasing in Conversation and could extract Gold from Dirt He had the Art of forming a Title to a Book beyond the rest of the  Craft  or even the Author themselves I have forgot how he came to stumble over Mr  Pope  for Mr  Curll  was a little purblind and lost his Sight some Years before his Death But Mr  Pope  in Revenge invited him to a Tavern under the Colour of Friendship Sack being a favourite Liquor with Mr  Curll  this great Poet had a Draught prepares in an antimonial Cup which the unsuspecting Book seller chearfully drank off to the Health of his good Friend Mr  Pope  But the Operation began to work before he could reach his own House with such violen Motions that the intended  Farce  was near ending in the  Tragedy  of Mr  Edmund Curll  The next Day to com+plete his Revenge Mr  Pope  published a humourous Account of the Murder of Mr  Curll  by Poison By this Poet and Bookseller to their Deaths declared fe War against each other and tho' the latter might b  put to his Shifts sometimes yet he often found Meat to  gall his Kibe Pope  in his  Dunciad  had made  Cur  a Demihero and has filthily bedaub'd him with Honours but enrag'd Wit like a Wasp disturb'd w  fly at harmless Passengers and leave their poisoned Sting behind  a Person  well noted in  London  from Mr  Pope'  commencing Physician finding his Inclination so strong for the Stage agreed to let him try his Fortune there He had a most extraordinary melodious Voice strong and clear and in the Part of  Macheath  in the  Beggar' Opera  he was allow'd to excel the Original Then he was an excellent  Mimic  if Excellency may be join'd to  Mimicry  He took a little too much Pride in the Firmness of his Voice for he had an odd Custom of stealing unperceiv'd upon a Person and with a  Hem  in his Ear deafen him for some time with  the Strength and Loudness of his Voice Yet this customary Folly for Folly it may be justly call'd prov'd his Fate for the last  Hem  he gave broke a BloodVessel which was the Cause of his Death in Twentyfour Hours after He was a great Benefactor to the  MaltTax  which in my Opinion was the Cause of that Mountain of Flesh he was loaded with  At the Time of his Death he was under Mr  Henry Giffard  at the Theatre in  Goodman'sFields  He was bury'd at the Charge of that Gentleman in  St Mary  's Church  Whitechapel  in the th Year of his Age We shall end with Mr  Hulet  in Mr  Giffard  's own Words  Mr  Charles Hulet  was endowed with great Abilities for a Player but laboured under the Disadvantage of a Person rather too corpulent for the  Hero  or the  Lover  but his Port well became  Henry  the Eighth  Falstaff  c and many other Characters both  Tragedy  and  Comedy  in which he would have been equally excellent had his Application and Figure been proportionable to his Qualifications which had he duly cultivated he would have become a very considerable Performer  What Machines are we poor Mortals that a Person should be kill'd with a  Hem    As in a Watch if the least Engine flies  The Work is stopp'd and the whole Movement dies  Mr BENJAMIN JOHNSON  COmmonly called  Ben Johnson  was bre  a Painter where his Employment led him to paint under his Master the Scenes for the Stage but he took more Pleasure in hearing the Actors rehearse than in his Pencil or Colours and as he us'd to say in his merry Mood  left the  Saint  's  St  Luke  was a Painter and those that follow that Art have chosen him for their Patron and make his Day a Time of Mirth and Jollity  Occupation to take that of a Sinner  He arrived to as great a Perfection in Acting as his great Namesake did in Poetry He seemed to be proud to wear that eminent Poet's double Name being more particularly great in all that Author's Plays that were usually performed  viz Wasp  in the Play of  BartholomewFair Corbaccio  in the  Fox Morose  in the  Silent Woman  and  Ananias  in the  Alchymist  He was but once in this Kingdom about fifty Years ago in the Summer Season I have heard him often give most extravagant Praises to one  Baker  a MasterPaver in  Dublin  for excelling in Sir  John Falstaff  the  Spanish Fryar  Sir  Epicure Mammon  in the  Alchymist  and many other Parts He would be studying in the Streets while he would be overlooking his Men at their Work One  Day two of his Men that were newly come under their Master and were Strangers to his Manner observing his Countenance Motions Gestures and talking to himself imagined their Master was mad  Baker  seeing his Men neglect their Work to gaze at him bid them in a hasty Manner  mind their Business  The CountryFellows for they but lately came from  Chester  went to work again but still with an Eye upon their Master The Part was Sir  John Falstaff  that  Baker  was rehearsing and when he came to the Fifth Act where the humourous Knight is supposed to see Sir  Walter Blunt  lie dead upon the StageHe gives a Look on one of his new Pavers and muttered loud enough to be heard with Eyes fix'd upon him  Who have we hereSir  Walter Blunt  There's Honour for you  The Fellow that was stooping rose on the Instant clapping hold of his Master  Wauns Ise blunt enough to take care of you Ise warrant you  So with the Help of his Companion they bound Mr  Baker  's Hands and Feet assisted by other People no wiser than themselves and notwithstanding their Master's Noise and Struggle they carried him home in that Condition with a great Mob at their Heels Mr  Johnson  informed me when he returned to  England  he gave Mr  Betterton  the Manner of  Baker  's playing  Falstaff  which that great Actor not only approv'd of but imitated and allowed the Manner was better than his  own Mr  Husband  gave me much the same Account of this Mr  Baker  Mr  Johnson  played to the last Year of his Life with the same standard Reputation and died in  August  in the th Year of his Age  He fell like Autumn Fruit that mellow'd long  Even wonder'd at because he dropt no sooner  OEDIPUS  Miss J JONES  THE Father of this young Gentlewoman was born in  Wales  a Branch of an antient and reputable Family in that Country but an unforeseen Misfortune falling upon him he made the Stage his Refuge and go+verned a Country Company many Years with Judgment Honesty and Reputation Miss  Jones  more by the Will of her Father than her own Inclinations was thrust on the Stage a mere Infant and now makes a very good Figure there But her Virtue and sober discreet Behaviour may be a Pattern for Imitation therefore I shall say no more but conclude that she deserves a better Fate  Our Guardian Angel is fair Innocence  And virtuous Actions are our best Defence  Mr THEOPHILUS KEEN  I Mention this Gentleman as receiving Instructions from the late  Joseph Ashbury  Esq  Mr  Keen  was an excellent Scholar and a very good Actor But having some Share in the Government of the Theatre in  Lincoln'sInnFields  under Mr  Rich  either for the Want of Performers or perhaps overlooking his Talents a Fault sometimes very good Actors of both Sexes are guilty of he stood for Parts something out of his Road as  Oroonoko Earl of Essex Edgar  in  King Lear  when in the Part of  Gloster  in the same Play and others of that Cast no Actor of his Time could excel him Altho' a very good Figure and Voice his Person wanted Elegance for the soft Characters  It was reported the ill Success of the Theatre when he was Sharer in Profit and Loss broke his Heart He died in the Year and was bury'd in the Body of the Church of  St ClementDanes  by a voluntary Subscription from both Houses It was what we term in  England  a Walking Funeral and there were upwards of Two hundred Persons in deep Mourning His Life was published by Mr  Savage  illegitimate Son to the Earl of  Rivers  Several  Wou'dbe Wits  wrote Copies of Verses upon his Death One I remember ending with this Line  And Death was found too  Sharp  for  Keen  Mr LAURENCE KENNEDY  THIS Gentleman is a Native of  Ireland  born in  Dublin  His good Figure agreeable Voice and genteel easy Carriage render him a pleasing Actor and we may expect from such Qualifications that Time may bring him to great Perfection All Arts are learned by Time Observation and Industry and when Choice guides Youth in any Occupation Nature seems to lead the Way  But many blunder on in various Ways  Some ill succeed while others merit Praise  Mr JOHN LEIGH  I Think was born in  Ireland  He commenced Actor however on the  Irish  Theatre He was a Person of some Education with a particular amiable Form and genteel Address insomuch that he gained the Appellative of  Handsome Leigh  A good Figure was the chief Advantage in the Parts he perform'd He was call'd from this Kingdom to fill up the Troop of Comedians rais'd to garison the New Theatre in  Lincoln'sInnFields  in the Year at its first Opening where he set forth the First Night in  Captain Plume  in the  Recruiting Officer  which occasioned the following Lines to be wrote on the Back of one of their Bills  'Tis right to raise Recruits for faith they're wanted  For not one acting Soldier's here 'tis granted  Mr  Leigh  I believe might have been in the good Graces of the FairSex  if his Taste had led him that Way  He was addicted to Poetry and produced a Comedy call'd  KensingtonGardens  acted at the Theatre in  Lincoln'sInnFields  in the Year which walk'd consumptively six Nights and then expir'd He also trimm'd up a Farce call'd  Hob's Wedding  taken from a Comedy call'd  The Country Wake  written by that

Or else c  The Author died in the th Year of his Age  A Time that should to true Perfection tend  But many promise well that never mend  Mr LEWIS LAYFIELD  WAS born in  England  has been in many Employments both by Sea and Land and was formerly very active and strong able to go through Fatigues As I do not know the Offices he bore in the Service I must be silent on that Head I remember him in  Drurylane  when I was in my Youth a nimble active  Scaramouch  before he was loaden with that Burden of Flesh he now carries about him At that Time he was such a Person as his eldest Son Mr  Robert Layfield  appears at present who is a very good Player in several Cast of Parts particularly  Serjeant Kite  c  Mr  Layfield  has been a main Pillar Time past in supporting the  Dublin  Theatre and therefore ought to be respected in his Decline but he is happily engaged for Life and of Consequence if Articles are binding will receive his Salary to the Day of his Death There are several Parts he might still perform with Satisfaction as  Hob Jobson  and many others for the Audience in wellesteemed Actors will 'bate them something of their Years for the Service they  have  done I do not know whether that Circumstance will have any Weight with the Managers here tho' it is an oldfashion'd Custom in  England  but different Nations different Customs  'Tis said the Natives of the Cape  GoodHope  It is a Custom with the Inland  Hottentots  who are not under the Eye of the  Dutch  at the  Cape  when they perceive their Relations drooping with Age and Infirmities either to carry them into some distant Wood for Beasts to devour or end them by Ax or Halter at Home and have a Saying among them  No Work no Meat    When Age is failing end it with a Rope  Mr WILLIAM MILWARD  THIS Gentleman was born at  Lichfield  in  Staffordshire  the th of  September  in the Year His Great Grandfather Sir  Thomas Milward  was Chief Justice of  WestChester  and raised a Troop of Horse in Defence  of that unhappy Monarch King  Charles  the First and was then a County Palatine which occasioned the  Rump Parliament  in the Year to vote their Charter void and I do not find it ever restor'd The Family were originally from  Derbyshire  The Father of our Actor a few Years after the Birth of his Son removed to  Uttoxeter  commonly called  Tociter  in the County of  Stafford  distant from  London  measured Miles formerly a Colony of the  Romans  He had his Education in a School of that Town accounted one of the best in that Part of the Country At fifteen his Father brought him to  London  where he was put Apprentice to an eminent Apothecary in  Norfolkstreet  in the  Strand  but he has often declared  there were so many Dangers in the Employment  that he could never like it The following Accident made him determine to leave it  He was ordered by his Master to carry his Prescriptions to a Gentleman and Lady ill of different Maladies at the same time the Labels were wrong directed but he did not discover this Mistake till the next Day when he carried other Medicines to the same Persons and by his Judgment in the Operation soon found out the Mistake He was greatly terrified but for fear of more he let fall the Phial he had in his Hand as by Accident ran back to his Master and told him what had been done The Master  ordered more proper Doses the Patients recovered and all was well  Mr  Milward  's first Essay in Acting was among young Gentlemen privately for their own Diversion In a small time after he mixt with a Country Company of Comedians where his Merit shone so bright that it open'd the Eyes of the Manager in  Lincoln'sInnFields  with whom he rose in that Theatre and  CoventGarden  to be placed in the foremost Rank of Perfection He died in the th Year of his Age in the very Meridian of an Actor then belonging to the Theatre in  Drurylane  Mr  Milward  shall make his  Exit  from this worldly Stage with an Epilogue spoke for the Benefit of his Widow which will better speak his Excellencies  WHEN  Roscius  died each gen'rous  Roman  wept  While  Cicero  's deathless Page his Plaudit kept  Such was the Harvest in that Golden Age  Who toil'd to till the Vineyard of the Stage  The  Romans  wept more gen'rous  Britons  ye  Dry up the Tears of  Milward  's Family  Your bounteous Cares beyond the Grave extend  Lo what a Scene dead Merit to befriend  For Merit sure he shar'd in ev'ry Part  Merit most rareIntegrity of Heart  Whate'er of Friendly Gen'rous Good he play'd  In Scenes of real Life he still display'd  Young  Hamlet  's Sable when he chose to wear  Young  Hamlet  's filial Piety was there  When the fond Lover  Phocyas  in the  Siege of Damascus  Phocyas  was his Part  Each tender Line sprang glowing from his Heart  Or when  Macduff  's dire Anguish was his Theme  The Husband and the Father bled in him  Well might he please when with each virtuous Thought  The Poet penn'd the Player's Breast was fraught  Such  Milward  was as such his early Grave  Calls down the Pity of the Fair and Brave  Cut off just at the Noontide of his Days  Just when he hop'd to have deserv'd your Praise  The Player steel'd to counterfeit the Tear  Distills an undissembled Eyedrop here  Whilst by this splendid Circle fir'd his Breast  With Emulation burns and claims his best  That his own  Manes  may like  Milward  's rest  Mr CHARLES MACKLIN  WAS born in the Kingdom of  Ireland  but left that Country very young He cast his Thoughts towards the Stage in  England  in his early Years The Science of Acting is not to be learn'd without great Labour and Study and not copying any Performer that went before him he has at length shone out a finish'd Original I never knew him undertake any Part but as in Painting I found some Strokes of Nature that gave fresh Touches to the Picture he was drawing  He rose gradually in the Theatrical Corps like the late Northern Star of  Russia  till he came to be chief Leader he regularly gained the Topmast Step and now is seated in the Throne of Perfection dispensing Laws to that Part of the Province where the SOCK is worn where he reigns sole Monarch and deservedly so since with long laborious Pains he has found out the true Rule of Reigning  Shylock  the  Jew  in the Merchant of  Venice  is so immitably counterfeited that we cannot say more than what a Gentleman said  extempore  on seeing him perform the Part  This is the  Jew  That  Shakespear  drew  This excellent Comedian is Author of a Play call'd  Henry  the VIIth or the  Popish Impostor  acted at the TheatreRoyal in  DruryLane  the Story of  Perkin Warbeck  The Piece in my Judgment is wellplann'd the Diction is not considered critically but no wonder since he was put upon the Subject and had but six Weeks from the first Line in Writing to the first Night in Acting The following OneAct Pieces have been performed with great Success but not printed  A  Will  or no  Will  or a new Case for the  Lawyers  A  Critic  on the  Suspicious Husband  or the  Plague of Envy  The  FortuneHunters  or the  Widow Bewitch'd  I shall conclude with two Lines wrote b a Gentleman in this Kingdom  This  Jew  this  Colonel Lopez Ben  has shown  He makes each various Character his own  Mrs  MACKLIN  MAY by her Judgment and Execution in the Parts she undertakes be equally ranked with the first Class of Actresses and in some Articles lead the Way She never sets up for a  Heroine  or attempts to appear in an improper Light she knows the Power of her own Talents and always shines with unborrow'd Light without the Danger of being eclipsed Her Propriety in Dress for the various Characters she performs is another Excellence that most of her Cotemporaries either pass over with very little Regard or not enough  In my Theatrical Course of above thirty Years I have not seen her Equal in many Parts  viz  the  Widow BlackAcre  in  Wycherly  's  PlainDealer  Mrs  Day  in the  Committee Widow Lackit  in  Southern  's  Oroonoko Lady Pliant  in  Congreve  's  DoubleDealer Doris  in  Aesop  by Sir  John Vanbrugh  Mrs  Amelet  in the  Confederacy  by the same Author Lady  Wishfort  in the  Way of the World  and a Number of other Characters that are wrote in the true Spirit of Comedy But a Vessel need not fail of arriving at the desired Port with the Care of so good a Pilot  We may find by these two Examples that  Ireland  has produced as complete Comedians as her Sister  England  But I shall give a few Lines the Sentiments of a young Gentleman in this City  To Mrs MACKLIN  WHILE  Macklin  charms the list'ning Throng  A nobler Subject warms my Song  Of Nature's sacred Name I'd sing  From whom her various Beauties spring  The swelling Sensethe genial Fire  The nameless Graces we admire  To hershe frankly did impart  A Clueto trace the mazy Heart  She gave her Witwith graceful Ease  And ev'ry Attribute to please  But knowthou finish'd Nymphto you  Nor Wondernor Applauseis due  For Charmswhich Nature only drew  Mr  JOHN MORRIS  WAS born in this Kingdom I understand his first Entrance on the Stage was under the Conduct of Mrs  Violante  With her he travelled to  England  and by various Changes has been in most of the Theatres in  London  as well as  Dublin  There are several old Mens Parts that he masterly executes He sings passingly is esteemed a good  Teague  and an excellent  Pierrot  He has a Brother of the same Calling  Dancing  is certainly one of the Appendages to Education that few polite People would be without yet if it mends the Manners it does not always mend the Mind but as  Othello  says  'Tis not to make me jealous  To say my Wife is fair feeds well loves Company  Is free of Speech sings plays and dances well  Where Virtue is these are most virtuous  Mr CHARLES MORGAN  WAS born in  London  in the Year His Father and Mother both belonging to the Stage at his Birth the Son play'd the Childrens Parts as soon as he could speak  plain He came into this Kingdom in the Year with his Parents where he made a great Progress in what is called low Comedy and gave great Hopes of Perfection if a lingering Consumptioh had not taken him off in the Flower of his Age I fear he took a little too much Freedom with his Constitution and by Perseverance made shift to get the better of it He died in  May  in the th Year of his Age The last Part he performed was  Beau Clincher  in the  Constant Couple  being the first Time of Mr  Sherridan  's appearing in the Character of  Sir Harry Wildair  where Mr  Morgan  notwithstanding his ill Habit of Body like a Taper in its last Blaze gave a brighter Flame than all that shone before This was  November  tho' he lingered on till the  May  following  Thus manly Health is often overcome  When its worst Woe is to be found at Home  Mr MOZEEN  I Think I know enough of him to imagine he is a very improving Actor He has many Requisites that may make out what I assert for him a good Person join'd to a genteel Education Judgment Voice and Understanding His Success already since he has had but three Years Experience shews us a larger Prospect of Advantage  He was born in  England  tho' of  French  Extraction and if it is any Honour to him had the muchtalk'dof Dr  Henry Sachevere  for a Sponsor  Mrs  Mozeen  formerly Miss  Edwards  knew a Child She sprung up under the Car  of that eminent Actress Mrs  Clive  I know Mrs  Mozeen  is an Adept in Music has a charming Manner and Voice If her innate Modesty keeps her back as an Actress Time may get the better of her Timidity Modesty may assume a proper Spirit when it is assured of being justly right in what is undertaken for Virtue has ever Courage and is its own Guardian  Virtue could see to do what Virtue would  By her own radiant Light tho' Sun and Moon  Were in the flat Sea sunk  Milton  Mr WILLIAM MYNITT  THIS Gentleman was born of a good Family at  Weobly  in  Herefordshire  in the Year where he received a good Schoo Education He was sent to  London  very young to be put into Business but his Friends or rather Relations who often prove our greates  Enemies neglecting his Fortune he turn'd hi Thoughts to the Drama However he had no the Vanity of most of the Theatrical young Heroes who jump at once into your  Othello  Oroonoko Hamlet  or  Captain Plume  but wisely weighing his own Talents step'd into the Part of  Polonius  in  Hamlet  where he gained such Applause that he resolv'd to put on the  Sock  with which he walked an easy Pace in the right Road to Perfection  His first Trial of Skill was at the Theatre in the  Haymarket  commonly called the  French House  where he gave such Strokes of Judgment that alarmed his best Antagonists From his beginning Encouragement he was solicited to add a promising Member to the Company of  Bath  where there is a regular Theatre and an Audience as difficult to be pleas'd as that in  London  being generally Persons of the highest Rank that frequent those Diversions in the Capital He had the good Fortune to give Satisfaction there insomuch that several Persons of Distinction and Taste promised to recommend him to one of the establish'd Theatres in  London  But a Company that Season setting out for  Ireland  he was resolv'd to accompany them and cultivate his Genius in this Kingdom His Knowlege in Music is some Addition to his Merit and in his Walk of Acting he may keep Pace with the best on both Sides the Water  I never saw Mrs  Mynitt  perform any Part but as she has an amiable Person and excellent Voice I have taken it upon Trust that she is an agreeable Actress both in Tragedy and Comedy But the Bulk of the Letters in the Bills are the distinguished Characteristics of  Merit It puts me in Memory of a  Mandarin  I saw at  Canton  in  China  who was lifted on a Throne of State to public View while a Dozen of his Slaves that bore him in Triumph through the Streets were covered with a Curtain and no more of their Persons seen but the regular Steps of their Feet  In ev'ry Region 'tis a Maxim try'd  Custom in spight of Reason will preside  Mr HENRY NORRIS alias JUBILEE DICKY  THIS natural Comedian was born in  Salisbury Court  in near the Spot where the Theatre was afterwards erected that went by the Name of  DorsetGarden  Theatre it being in Queen  Elizabeth  's Days the Gardens of the Palace belonging to the Earl of  Dorset  He play'd on the  Irish  Stage in Tho' a diminutive Figure there were many Parts that he excelled in  viz Barnaby Brittle  in the  Wanton Wife  c I remember when Mr  Norris  was in his Decline Mr  Cibber  se  made some Alterations in the Play and perform'd the Part himself Mrs  Oldfield  tha of Mrs  Brittle  But she complain'd she couk not perform it with that Spirit with him as she did with little  Norris  as she call'd him When asked her the Reason she reply'd  Cuckold  did not sit so easy on  Cibber  's Figure as it di  upon that of  Norris  's who seem'd form'd by Nature to be one  The Mother of this little great  Comedian  was one of the first Women that came on the Stage as an Actress for some Time after the Restoration of King  Charles  the Second young smoothfac'd Men perform'd the Womens Parts That humourous Monarch coming before his usual Time to  Shakespear  's  Hamlet  sent the facetious Earl of  Rochester  to know the Reason of their Delay who brought Word back That the  Queen was not quite shav'd Ods Fish  his usual Expression  I beg her Majesty's Pardon we'll wait till her  Barber  has done with her  Mr  Norris  married Mrs  Knapton  the Sister of the late Mr  Wilks  's first Wife by whom he had several Children The Females are since dead and resembled the Mother in Stature she being a very personable Woman but the Sons copied the Father our  Jubilee Dicky  which Nickname came for his inimitable humourous Performance of a Part so called in  The Constant Couple or A Trip to the Jubilee  He spoke Tragedy exceedingly knowing in the different Passions tho' he never perform'd any Part of the serious Cast for notwithstanding his Judgment on the  London  Theatres his Figure must have made the Sentiments ridiculous After the Death of that celebrated Author Mr  Addison  the merry Mr  Penkethman  at his Theatre at  Richmond  There are two  Richmonds  in  England  one in  Yorkshire  that gives the Title to that illustrious Family the other  Richmond  is Ten Miles from  London  It may rank with some Cities in  England  for its Extent but I know of none that can equal it in its fine Situation upon the noble River  Thames  its healthful Air beautiful various Prospects from the Hill and its increasing noble Buildings  play'd the Tragedy of  Cato  or rather defil'd those noble Sentiments of Liberty out of such merry Mouths  Norris  was ridiculously dressed for  Cato Penkethman Juba  low Comedians for the other Characters and the two Ladies supplied by Men of the same Cast Yet a blind Man might have borne with  Norris  in the  Roman Patriot  for he spoke it with all the Solemnity of a suffering Hero while  Penkethman  and the rest of the motley Tribe made it as ridiculous by Humour and Action And yet some of the first Rank in the Kingdom seemed highly diverted whilst others invoked the  Manes  of the dead  Roman  and  Briton  to rise and avenge their own Cause I remember the next Morning the following four Lines were pasted on the Door of the Playhouse  While Greatness hears such Language spoke  Where godlike Freedom's made a Joke  Let such mean Souls be never free  To taste the Sweets of Liberty  An illustrious Nobleman who had a Seat near  Richmond  seeing several People reading the  Lines as he was riding up the Hill stop'd and perused them and said in his usual grave Manner  I wish the Poetry had been better  Mr  Norris  died in the th Year of his Age His eldest Son may be remember'd here as an  Actor  some few Years ago on old  Smockalley  Stage but neither he nor his Brother who has likewise troubled several Country Stages in  England  resembled the Father in any Thing but Stature  Great Nature differs in the human Race  Some worthless Stems the Parentroots disgrace  Mrs ANNE OLDFIELD  THE Reason why I have thrust this celebrated Actress into my Account may be learn'd by the following Epistle  Dublin  May the th  SIR  WE find by the Newspapers you intend to give us the  History of the Stage  It is desir'd by several that you would be pleased to add Mrs  Oldfield  to the Number tho' we are all assured she never was in this Kingdom We know the Task is in your Power and you will oblige many that have a Regard for you  Yours c  Every Art has its Origin but when brought to full Perfection it is often in Danger of decaying and sometimes of being quite lost in Oblivion Painting on  Glass  in this Age is but a faint Copy of our Forefathers in that Art and the perdurable Cement of our antient  Castles  c is now unknown The Sun sets to rise again but  Oldfield  's Light is lost for ever  I was too young to view her first Dawn on the Stage but yet had the infinite Satisfaction of her Meridian Lustre a Glow of Charms not to be beheld but with a trembling Eye which held her Influence till set in Night  Mr  Farquhar  as I have been informed by herself brought her first to shine in Public He accidentally at a Tavern kept by a near Relation of Mrs  Oldfield  's heard a Person reading a Comedy in a Room behind the Bar with such a just Vivacity and Humour of the Characters as gave him infinite Surprize and Satisfaction His Curiosity was too prevalent to observe the Height of good Manners therefore he made a Pretence to go into the Room where he was struck dumb for some Time with her Figure and blooming Beauty but was more astonish'd at her Discourse and sprightly Wit Mr  Farquhar  press'd her to pursue her Amusement but was obliged to depart without that Satisfaction  Mr  Wilks  was at that Time in  Ireland  therefore he took some Pains to acquaint Sir  John Vanbrugh  who had some Share in the Theatre with the Jewel he had found thus by Accident It was some Time before she would be prevailed upon tho' she has merrily told me  I long'd to be at it and only wanted a little decent Intreaties  Alinda  in the  Pilgrim  was the first Part she was taken Notice of in which Sir  John Vanbrugh  alter'd and reviv'd upon her Account which is a Character of different Species of Passions and Variety where she charm'd the Play into a Run of many succeeding Nights  I remember in her full Round of Glory in Comedy she used to slight Tragedy She would often say  I hate to have a Page dragging my Tail about Why do they not give  Porter  these Parts She can put on a better Tragedy Face than I can  When  Mithridates  was revived it was with much Difficulty she was prevail'd upon to take the Part but she perform'd it to the utmost Length of Perfection and after that she seem'd much better reconcil'd to Tragedy What a majestical Dignity in  Cleopatra  and indeed in every Part that required it Such a finish'd Figure on the Stage was never yet seen In  Calista  the  Fair Penitent  she was inimitable in the Third Act with  Horatio  when she tears the Letter with  To Atoms thus  Thus let me tear the vile detested Falshood  The wicked lying Evidence of Shame  Her excellent clear Voice of Passion her piercing flaming Eye with Manner and Action suiting us'd to make me shrink with Awe and seem'd to put her Monitor  Horatio  into a Mousehole I almost gave him up for a troublesome Puppy and though Mr  Booth  play'd the Part of  Lothario  I could hardly lug him up to the Importance of triumphing over such a finish'd Piece of Perfection that seemed to be too much dignified to lose her Virtue  Even her Amours seemed to lose that Glare which appears round the Persons of the failing Fair neither was it ever known that she troubled the Repose of any Lady's lawful Claim and was far more constant than Millions in the conjugal Noose  She was of a superior Height but with a lovely Proportion and the Dignity of her Soul equal to her Form and Stature made up of benevolent Charity affable and goodnatur'd to all that deserv'd it Mr  Savage  Son to the Earl  Rivers  when he was persecuted by his unnatural Mother received from her evergiving bountiful Hand Fifty Pounds a Year during her Life and she was with Mr  Wilks  a main Means in saving him from an ignominious End  The Part of  Sophonisba  a Tragedy by Mr  Thomson  famed for many excellent Poems was reputed the Cause of her Death for in her Execution she went beyond Wonder to Astonishment From that Time her Decay  came slowly on and never left her till it conducted her to eternal Rest the d of  October  She left several charitable Legacies and very handsome Fortunes to her two Sons But let us see what better Writers say of this Phoenix of the Stage O that we might have another from her Ashes  You may read if you please what a  French  Author has wrote on this inimitable Actress as well as some Touches on our  English Drama  Sir  Roger Mostings  Baronet was passionately in Love with a famous Actress called Mrs  Oldfield  and notwithstanding her Indifference and even bad Usage could not be cur'dHe being at Supper with us when his Disgrace and Banishment were notified to him his greatest Concern was for his Mistress whom he must abandon His Grief and Love made him shed Tears His Order bore That he should retire to his Estate the next Day and therefore as the last Remedy for his Love he proposed instant Marriage to Mrs  Oldfield  which produced no other Effect than a mortifying Refusal  We may gather from this Author that the Passage mention'd was in the Year when the Rebel Lords suffer'd Death and Lord  Nithisdale  made his Escape from the  Tower  disguised by his Lady in her Habit Sir  Roger Mostings  then Commander in the Fourth Troop of Lifeguards spoke too freely in Favour of the imprison'd Noblemen that were concern'd in the Rebellion and therefore was order'd to leave the Court and retire to his Estate as also the Earl of  Nottingham  the Earl of  Ailesford  the Lords  Finche  and  Guernsey  my Lord  Portmore  the Earl of  Orkney  Lord  Windsor  and many others all depriv'd of their Posts and Places with the same Orders to retire to their Estates Sir  Roger  was esteemed one of the handsomest Men in the Kingdom witty wellbred and had a great Estate which proves that Mrs  Oldfield  despised Interest and would not give her Hand without her Heart  This amiable Woman was admitted  with Pleasure into the Company of Ladies of the first Rank for Birth and Virtue who seemed to take her Visits as an Honour done them It must be owned she is an incomparable sweet Girl She reconciled me to the  English  Stage Her Voice her Shape and all her Actions so charm'd me that I made the more Haste to learn the Language that I might understand her  The  English  are passionately fond of Dramatic Entertainments and I doubt if  France  can produce so many excellent Works of this kind as  Britain  and I have seen some superior to  Greece  or  Rome  They have their  Shakespear Dryden Otway Congreve Cibber Farquhar  and a numerous Train of excellent Tragic and Comic Poets that have the Force of moving the Soul with their Energy of Sentiments and Expression far beyond the Antients  I shall conclude this Account with an Abstract of a Copy of Verses wrote by Mr  Savage  illegitimate Son to Earl  Rivers  tho' the Author of that unfortunate Gentleman's Life seems to deny it I suppose because his  Name is not in the Titlepage But first her  Epitaph  Hic juxta requiescit  Tot inter poetarum laudata nomina  ANNA OLDFIELD  Nec ipsa minore laude digna  Quippe quae eorum opera  In scenam quoties prodivit  Illustravit semper nobilitavit  Nunquam ingenium idem ad partes diversissimas  Habilius fuit  Ita tamen ut ad singulas  Non facta sed nata esse videretur  In Tragoediis  Formae splendor oris dignitas incessus majestas  Tanta vocis suavitate temperabantur  Ut nemo esset tam agrestis tam durus spectator  Quin in admirationem totus raperetur  In Comoedia autem  Tanta vis tam venusta hilaritas tam curiosa  Felicitas  Ut neque sufficerent spectando oculi  Neque plaudendo manus  In  English  thus  Near this among the celebrated Poets  Rests the Body of  ANNE OLDFIELD  Herself not less deserving to be celebrated  For whenever on the Stage  Her Action illustrated and ennobled  Their Compositions  Never was one Genius so adapted to the most  Different Parts  She seemed born for each distinct  In TRAGEDY  Her noble Presence elevated Speech and  Majestic Gait tempered with so peculiar  Sweetness of Voice never failed to transport the  Most Rustic and Insensible into Admiration  In COMEDY  She discovered such a happy Air such a  Sprightly and becoming Gaiety  And so delicate an Address  That neither Eyes were satisfied with Seeing  Nor Hands weary of Applauding  A  POEM  to the Memory of Mrs  ANNE OLDFIELD  OLDFIELD  's no more and can the Muse forbear  O'er  Oldfield  's Grave to shed a grateful Tear  Shall she the Glory of the  British  Stage  Pride of her Sex and Wonder of the Age  Shall she who living charm'd th' admiring Throng  Die undistinguish'd and not claim a Song  No feeble as it is I'll boldly raise  My willing Voice to celebrate her Praise  And with her Name immortalize my Lays  Had but my Muse her Art to touch the Soul  Charm ev'ry Sense and ev'ry Pow'r controul  I'd paint her as she wasThe Form divine  Where ev'ry lovely Grace united shine  A Mien majestic as the Wife of  Jove  An Air as winning as the Queen of Love  In ev'ry Feature rival Charms should rise  And  Cupid  hold his Empire in her Eyes  A Soul with ev'ry Elegance refin'd  By Nature and the Converse of Mankind  Wit which could strike assuming Folly dead  And Sense which temper'd ev'ry thing she said  Judgment which ev'ry little Fault could spy  But Candour that would pass a Thousand by  Such finish'd Breeding so polite a Taste  Her Fancy always for the Fashion past  Whilst ev'ry social Virtue fir'd her Breast  To help the Needy succour the Distrest  A Friend to all in Misery she stood  And her chief Pride was plac'd in doing Good  But now my Muse the arduous Task engage  And shew the charming Figure on the Stage  Describe her Look her Action Voice and Mien  The gay Coquet soft Maid or haughty Queen  So bright she shone in ev'ry diff'rent Part  She gain'd despotic Empire o'er the Heart  Knew how each various Motion to controul  Sooth ev'ry Passion and subdue the Soul  As she or gay or sorrowful appears  She claims our Mirth or triumphs in our Tears  When  Cleopatra  's Form she chose to wear  We saw the Monarch's Mien the Beauty's Air  Charm'd with the Sight her Cause we all approve  And like her Lover give up all for Love  Antony  's Fate instead of  Caesar  's choose  And wish for her we had a World to lose  But now the gay delightful Scene is o'er  And that sweet Form must glad our World no more  Relentless Death has stop'd the tuneful Tongue  And clos'd those Eyes for all but Death too strong  Blasted that Face where ev'ry Beauty bloom'd  And to eternal Rest the graceful Mover doom'd  Mr PACK  IN the Remembrance of many was once on the Stage in this Kingdom to his no small Terror For a Storm at Sea he told me frighten'd him so much that the Anxiety of returning dwelt so strongly on his Mind that he could not appear half himself to the Public and to lessen his Seavoyage back again he went to  Dunaghadee  in the North of  Ireland  and embark'd for  Scotland  verifying the old Proverb  The farthest Way about is the nearest Way home  He first came upon the Stage as a Singer and being as they say a  smockfac'd Youth  used to sing the Female Parts in Dialogues with that great Master Mr  Leveridge  who has so many Years charm'd with his manly Voice But Mr  Pack  was excellent in many Parts as  Marplot  in the  Busy Body  Beau  Maiden  in  TunbridgeWalks  Beau  Mizen  in the  Fair Quaker of Deal  c  indeed Nature seem'd to mean him for those sort of Characters  He  had such an Antipathy to the Water that he would sooner choose to go from the  Haymarket  to  Lambeth  round the Bridge than just cross in a Boat I heard a certain Peer as much fam'd for his Wit as his Principles who died in the Service of  Spain  ask  Pack  if he would go with him to  France  for a Month  Yes  reply'd Mr  Pack if your Grace will get a Bridge built from  Dover  to  Calais  For Gads curse me if I ever set my Foot over Saltwater again    Mr  Pack  left the Stage in the Meridian of Life and set up a a Tavern the  Globe  near  Charingcross  overagainst the  Haymarket  where he died having no Wife or Issue I know not any Relation he left behind to lament his Death  Had Transportation been this Player's Doom  Conviction had brought sudden Death at Home  Mr WILLIAM PHILLIPS Harlequin  THIS extraordinary Person was born in  Wales  tho' he never knew one Word of his Mothertongue neither did I ever hear of the Schoolmistress that taught him  English  Yet he got perfect in two Parts and perform'd them both with Applause  viz  the  Welsh Collier  in the  Recruiting Officer  and the  Drunken Colonel  in the  Intriguing Chambermaid  But  his great Talent lay in the  Mimes  and  Pantomimes  Tho' the Art does not require much Rhetoric yet they should have  Heads  as well as  Heels  He was taught Tumbling and Slight of Hand by that great Master of Arts the stupendous Mr  Faux  and outdid his Master in several Tricks and was very happy at Invention in escaping to  Ireland  This great Man was taken up in  London  for Suspicion of Debt and dealt with the honest Officer in the following Manner He first call'd for Liquor in abundance and treated all about him to the no small Joy of the Bailiff who was rejoiced to have a Calf that bled so well as they term it  Harlequin  made the honest Bailiff believe he had six Dozen of Wine ready pack'd up which he would send for to drink while in Custody and likewise allow him Sixpence a Bottle for drinking it in his own Chamber Shoulderdab listen'd to the Proposal with Pleasure The Bailiff went to the Place as directed and return'd with Joy to hear that it should be sent in the Morning early Accordingly it came by a Porter sweating under his Load The Turnkey call'd to his Master and told him the Porter and Hamper were come in  Very well  says he  then let nothing but the Porter and Hamper out  The Porter perform'd his Part very well came heavily in with an empty Hamper and seem'd to go lightly out with  Philips  on his Back He was dishamper'd at an Alehouse near the Waterside cross'd the  Thames  and soon after embark'd for  Ireland  He was very fond of this Trick and would take Pride in his Project which was contriv'd long before he was taken to be ready on such an Emergency When this Scheme was concerted with the Porter he made this threatening Speech to him  Gd strike me plump  his usual Speech  if you are not as secret as the Sun at Noonday I'll broil you and eat you alive you Dog  Exit  Phillips  where he became a Sharer in  Smockalley  till he with his Namesake  broke the  Fraterhood  He was the first Projector of the Theatre in  Capelstreet  neither was he much to blame in this since a Sort of Manager for the Proprietors who knew as much of the Matter as a  Journeyman Taylor  does of  Bellfounding  by his inimitable Rhetoric persuaded his Employers that he and his Wife had too much Salary and yet the next Season gave twenty Times the Sum to prevent their Playing Yet  Phillips  open'd and got Money But to shew his Dexterity he played a  Harlequin  Trick and in one of his Deceits made his Escape with his Wife he had  here  who was no bad Actress back to  England  but did not forget to take more Money than his own along with himTravelling  is chargeable  But  Capelstreet  Theatre has been since occupied and is still ready on all Occasions  Thus Juglers Tricks are form'd to cheat the Eyes  And Knaves have found the Art to trick the Wise  Mrs PASQUALINO  WAS a very sightly Actress with a good Voice I have forgot her maiden Name which she first changed for  Ravenscroft  an Actor I am told of some Merit After his Demise being musically inclin'd she ty'd her  Fate to Signor  Pasqualino  an  Italian  eminent for his great Talents that Way She has left the Stage to follow the Fortune of her Spouse and I have been inform'd they were both lately in  Holland  Whereever he is he cannot fail of Reward from his Merit For  Music has Charms to sooth a savage Breast  To soften Rocks and bend the knotted Oak  I shall conclude with Mrs  Pasqualino  by inserting a few Lines of a Poet on her leaving the Stage tho' some Poets like some Painters do not draw exact Likenesses and are too prone to Flattery  Adieu unspotted Excellence adieu  Chaste spite of Censure spite of Envy true  Mature in Judgment far above thy Age  And what's more wond'rous virtuous on the Stage  Ah yet return nor rob us of Delight  Continue still to ravish with thy Sight  Whether in  Desdemona  's tender Strain  Or softer  Belvidera  you complain  Or in  Monimia  force the pitying Tear  Or in the Airs of  Millamant  appear  Or Lady  Betty Modish  you impart  In Characters assum'd a real Dart  Receive this Plaudit from th' admiring Muse  Nor Tribute to thy Merit paid refuse  And must we then the Loss of thee deplore  Shall we then see thy lovely Face no more  AdieuThe Stage is nearly its Decline  Since we must thee the Boast of it resign  Mr JAMES QUIN  THIS great and just Actor was born in  Kingstreet Coventgarden  the th of  February  tho' Numbers believe he owes his Birth to  Ireland  His Ancestors were of an antient Family in this Kingdom His Grandfather Alderman  Mark Quin  was Lord Mayor of the City of  Dublin  in the Year in the Reign of King  Charles  the Second the Father of our  Roscius  received a liberal Education in  Trinity  College  Dublin  from thence he went over to  Lincoln  's  Inn  to finish his Studies where he was called to the Bar but at the Death of his Father who left him a plentiful Estate he returned with his Son then an Infant to take Possession  Mr  James Quin  was educated under the Care of Dr  Jones  of  Dublin  a Person eminent for Learning till the Death of his Father in the Year Mr  Quin  was undoubted Heir to his Estate but through his Youth and Inexperience of the Courts a Suit of Law hung so long in  Chancery  till he unenabled to carry the Cause farther was obliged to drop it for want of proper Assistance I am inform'd a powerful Guider of the Law was his Antagonist and a Person has but a bad Chance to fight a Duel with a Fencingmaster  Our eminent Actor first appeared on the Stage in old  Smockalley  in the Part of  Abel  in the  Committee  I must take some little Pride when I declare I imagine myself the first that persuaded him not to smother his rising Genius in this Kingdom where at that Time there was no great Encouragement for Merit and try his Fortune in  London  whither by his kind and evertoberemember'd Recommendation I soon follow'd him  It is in some sort a Hardship to a rising Genius in the first Entrance to a regular establish'd Company The Parts are all supplied and like Underofficers in an Army they must wait for Preserment or do something extraordinary before they can expect it An Accident fell out that gave our young Actor a happy Opportunity  The Managers had an Order from the  Lord Chamberlain  to revive the Play of  Tamerlane  for the th of  November  which was got up with the utmost Magnificence The third Night the late Mr  Mills  who perform'd  Bajazet  was taken suddenly ill and with much Persuasion Mr  Quin  was prevailed upon to read the Part which was thought a great Undertaking for a young Actor of his Standing but to the Mortification of several Competitors he succeeded so well that the Audience gave him their general Applause through the whole Course of the Part The next Night he made himself perfect and performed it with redoubled Applauses of Approbation and was  complimented by several Persons of Distinction and dramatic Taste upon his early rising Genius  But as the Theatrical World is a Picture in Miniature of the Great Envy will shake her snaky Locks People of twice his Age thought his Progress a little too rapid for their Approbation His Temper took fire at the visible Depression he bore it some Time with Temper but the first Opportunity he engag'd with Mr  Rich  in  Lincoln'sInnFields  where by just Degrees he attained the highest Round of Perfection and not to take any Merit from other Performers was certainly the chief Pillar that supported all the Theatres whereever he has performed I will not take upon me to point out his Excellencies in any particular Part since he is excellent in all Therefore I shall end with the immortal  Shakespear  He is a Man take him for all in all  I ne'er shall look upon his Like again  The great Honour this Gentleman has received from the second Illustrious Person in the Kingdom in trusting the Royal Blood to his Care will better speak his Excellence than my weak Skill can do  Mr LACY RYAN  THIS Gentleman was once in  Ireland  with the celebrated Mr  Quin  and Mrs  Clive  in the Year He was born in  England  in the Year The first Part he was taken Notice of in was that of  Marcus  in  Cato  which was first acted in  In the Run of that celebrated Tragedy he was accidentally brought into a Fray with some of our  Tritons  on the  Thames  and in the Scuffle a Blow on the Nose was given him by one of these Waterbullies who neither regard Men nor Manners I remember the same Night as he was brought on the  Bier  after his suppos'd Death in the Fourth Act of  Cato  the Blood from the real Wound in the Face gush'd out with Violence that Hurt had no other Effect than just turning his Nose a little tho' not to Deformity yet some People imagine it gave a very small Alteration to the Tone of his Voice tho' nothing disagreeable He acquitted himself in many capital Parts both in Tragedy and Comedy to the Satisfaction of his Auditors and has been ever esteemed in the first Rank of Actors  Some few Years ago another unfortunate Accident befel him As he was going home to his House after his Night's Performance he was attack'd by a Street robber and making Resistance the Villain shot a Brace of PistolBullets  into his Mouth which broke some Part of his Jaw By the Help of a Lamp the Robber knew Mr  Ryan  as I have been inform'd begg'd his Pardon for his Mistake and ran off Of this Hurt too he recover'd after a long Illness and play'd with Success as before without any seeming Alteration of Voice or Face His Royal Highness upon this Accident sent him a handsome Present and others of the Nobility copy'd the laudable Example of the second illustrious Person in the three Kingdoms I shall say no more of Mr  Ryan  but that he is genteel and wellmade  This Gentleman has made several Excursions in the Region of Poetry particularly a Piece of one Act call'd  The Coblers Opera  which has often been performed with good Success  No Mark of Age in Face or Form appears  But Manhood bord'ring on the Vale of Years  Mrs REYNOLDS  THE Husband of this Person gathered a Company of Actors in the  Haymarket London  where they some Years ago met with Success for a Time but at last it fell topieces the Sinews being relax'd by an intemperate Constitution Mrs  Reynolds  was well esteem'd for a very good Performer in this Kingdom  but her Reputation seems  now  to be forgot She's to be pitied if it is not her own Fault  Scandal may heal like gaping Wounds in War  Yet leave behind the longdistinguish'd Scar  THOMAS SHERIDAN  Esq  THIS excellent Actor was born in this Kingdom Son to that very eminent the Reverend Dr  Sheridan  a Gentleman whose Memory will never be forgot while Learning holds the Reins to check the vicious Mind and guide us in the Paths of Virtue Men are but human Brutes poring in the Dark without some Light of Education Under such a Father and at such a Fountain of Learning as this Nursery of Erudition  Trinity  College no Wonder for our young Actor to rise in Perfection He was some Time in  Westminster  School and as his Mind led him to look early towards the Drama he had the Advantage of seeing the Regularity of the  British  Theatres which he does not only copy but many who have seen both find the Colours and Drapery so strong that at this Distance it stands in equal Goodness to the Original  To this Gentleman we owe the Decency that has been long wanting on the  Hibernian  Stage a Difficulty no one Person could have surmounted but himself and tho' Merit does  not always meet its proper Reward yet the Seeds of Flowers and Roots he had planted and sown in this theatrical Garden flourish sweet and amiable and like a Master in the Art Reward follows his Pains and Judgment in Culture  The Unmeritorious pass unobserved while Merit is commonly the Butt for Envy to empty her whole Quiver of poison'd Arrows at yet they generally fall short of their intended Mark I shall leave this Gentleman to his prosperous and deserved Success with the Character of  Envy  drawn by the inimitable Pen of Mr  Pope  Envy  will  Merit  as its Shade pursue  But like the Shadow proves the Substance too  For envy'd Wit like  Sol  eclips'd makes known  Th' opposing Body's Grossness not its own  When first that Sun toopow'rful Beams displays  It draws up Vapours which obscure its Rays  But ev'n those Clouds at last adorn its Way  Reflect new Glories and augment the Day  Mr LUKE SPARKS  MR  Sparks  was born in this Kingdom and has by incessant Attention to the Drama arrived to be a wellesteemed Person in the Business of the Theatre and there are many capital Parts in the Compass of his Power so  that he may be accounted a Person in the highest second Class I have seen him bear up the Burden of a leading Part to please the Audience without thinking of a better to stand in his Place He is equally useful in the  Buskin  and  Sock  and has the Advantage of a good Person and Voice join'd to diligent Study He is esteem'd an excellent Oeconomist which may be accounted a very valuable Disposition in the  theatrical World  there is something in the very Science of the Stage that urges on to pleasurable Expence I knew a Gentleman that call'd  London  the Body of Pleasure and the Theatre the Heart  Mr  Sparks  is now in  London  at the Fountain of theatrical Erudition and I make no doubt from his good Sense at his Return to his native Country he will meet with the proper Esteem his Merit deserves All or most People find Satisfaction in Novelty and a long Possession of the best Things is apt to depreciate them  'Tis Novelty that brightens all our Joys  Ev'n Beauty's Self by long Possession cloys  Mr ISAAC SPARKS  THERE are many Parts that become the Figure of this Person which is of a superior Height and Nature has bestowed upon him a Vein of Humour that gives Satisfaction  to the Audience I have not seen him act since his Return to his native Country but I am inform'd by very good Judges that he performs the Character of Sir  Samson Legend  in  Love for Love  to the utmost Perfection with many Characters of that Cast which will prove almost as useful in a Theatre as a Hero or a Lover  True Merit with magnetic Impulse draws  A willing Contribution of Applause  Mr CHARLES STORER  WAS born in  England  in the Town of  Lancaster  His strong Inclination for the Stage led him early to try his Fortune there where he has succeeded very well His good Understanding keeps him within the Bounds of his own Power which is the ready Road never to meet with Displeasure I think his Talent leads him to old Men in Comedy and the artificial Wrinkles in his Face seem to content him best which is something singular with young Persons in a Theatre For to appear pretty Fellows is generally the Aim of all young Attempters in the theatrical Province I have seen him give great Satisfaction in  Gomez  in the  Spanish Fryar Foresight  in  Love for Love  with other Parts of the same Cast And what in my Opinion shews the Strength  of his Judgment is that he was some Years before he entered into any establish'd Theatre Therefore he has followed the best Guide Nature which is ever sure to be right  Good Sense and Nature are not form'd by Art  But spring from secret Movements of the Heart  Mrs STORER formerly Miss CLARK  REcommends herself by her amiable Person Goodnature and her excellent sweet harmonious Manner in Singing therefore she is too much desired to shew her Excellence that Way to perform many Speaking Parts but where her exalted Talent is required And then whatever she says or sings thus properly introduced she doubly charms in I shall end with four Lines of a Poem on  Ranelagh  Gardens written last Summer in  London  Then  Storer  with her sweet inchanting Strains  Steals to our Hearts and o'er our Senses reigns  With ravish'd Ears we hear the pleasing Sounds  And heav'nly Joys the vaulted Roof resounds  GEORGE SWAN  Esq  IS a Gentleman of a good Family born in  England  He was made Manager of the Playhouse in  Aungierstreet  which I think was a difficult Attempt for a Gentleman almost a Stranger to the Affairs of a  Theatre  It is a very thinking Task and a Person of Pleasure must either drop his Pursuits of that Kind or sink in the boisterous Waves which will require all his Time and Art to steer his Vessel right As well may a Country Gentleman who never saw the Sea by Interest take the Command of a First Rate Man of War However this Person by a genteel Behaviour accompany'd with Affability joined with good Nature gained the Esteem of every one He played several Parts with a delicate Decency A Person of Distinction asked an Actor his Opinion of Mr  Swan  's Performance who reply'd  He played very well as a Gentleman  The Person replied  I should be very glad to see you play like one with all my Heart  I have heard Mr  Swan  has espoused a Lady of considerable Fortune in  England  I have been informed this Gentleman had a considerable Post at  CapeBreton  If it be true the Duration of his Office now Peace is concluded may not last him longer than the Government of the Theatre  which  he may know how to use to the best Advantage but the Management of a Theatre was a Task too hard for him  As well may Readers turn reverse the Book  Or reap the Harvest with a Pruninghook  Mr JOHN THURMOND  WAS an Actor of Repute in this Kingdom about Thirty Years past and stood in many capital Parts being then a Sharer in old  SmockAlley  Theatre with Mr  Thomas Elrington  c  To let you see how formerly even Tragedy Heroes were nowandthen put to their Shifts I'll tell you a short Story that befel Mr  Thurmond  It was a Custom at that Time for Persons of the First Rank and Distinction to give their BirthDay Suits to the most favoured Actors I think Mr  Thurmond  was honour'd by General  Ingoldsby  with his But his  Finances  being at the last Tide of Ebb the rich Suit was put in  Buckle  a Cant Word for Forty in the Hundred Interest One Night Notice was given that the General would be present with the  Government  at the Play and all the Performers on the Stage were preparing to dress out in the Suits presented The Spouse of  Johnny  as he was commonly called try'd all her Arts to persuade Mr  Holdfast  the  Pawnbroker  as it fell out his real Name  to let go the Cloaths for that Evening to be returned when the Play was over But all Arguments were fruitless nothing but the  Ready  or a Pledge of full equal Value Such People would have despised a  Demosthenes  or a  Cicero  with all their Rhetorical Flourishes if their Oratorian Gowns had been in Pledge Well what must be done The whole Family in Confusion and all at their WitsEnd Disgrace with her glaring Eyes and extended Mouth ready to devour Fatal Appearance At last  Winny  the Wife that is  Winnifrede  put on a compos'd Countenance but alas with a troubled Heart stepp'd to a neighbouring Tavern and bespoke a very hot  Negus  to comfort  Johnny  in the great Part he was to perform that Night begging to have the Silver Tankard with the Lid because as she said  a Covering and the Vehicle Silver would retain Heat longer than any other Metal  The Request was comply'd with the  Negus  carry'd to the Playhouse piping hotpopp'd into a vile earthen Mugthe Tankard  L'argent  travelled  Incog  under her Apron like the  Persian  Ladies veil'd popp'd into the Pawnbroker's Hands in exchange for the Suitput on and play'd its Part with the rest of the Wardrobe when its Duty was over carried back to remain in its old Depositorythe Tankard return'd the right Road and when the Tide flow'd with its Lunar Influence the stranded Suit was wasted into safe  Harbour again after paying a little for  dry Docking  which was all the Damage receiv'd  Mr  Thurmond  died in  London  when he was one of the Company in  DruryLane  Theatre a merry goodnatured Companion to the last  Thus Woman's Wit tho' some account it evil  With artful Wiles can overreach the Devil  Mrs THURMOND  HER maiden Name was  Lewis  born of reputable Parents at  Epsom  in  Surry  She was married to Mr  John Thurmond  the Son of the abovementioned He is a Person of a clean Head and a clear Heart and inherits the Mirth and Humour of his late Father  Mrs  Thurmond  has an amiable Person and good Voice She wisely left the Bustle and Business of the Stage in her full and ripe Performance and at that time left behind her but few that excell'd her Mr  Thurmond  contriv'd many profitable  Pantomimes  for the TheatreRoyal in  DruryLane  and was esteemed formerly a very good Stage Dancer but left the Practice before it left him  The flow'ry Bloom of  May  adorns the Stage  We shed our Lustre in declining Age  But yet how few observe the lab'ring Ant  To save a WinterStore when most they want  Mr VANDERBANK  WAS born in  England  in the Year His Father came originally from  Holland  Mr  Vanderbank  was brought up in the SeaService but not liking that inconstant Element he embarked on a Trading Theatre in  England  for some time till he made a Voyage to this Kingdom where he has remained these Twoandthirty Years He was as  Shakespear  says  Sunk in the Vale of Years  when I arrived here in and has not performed many Parts since that Time But I am informed both he and Mrs  Vanderbank  stood in high Esteem formerly but they have both left the Stage some time  Declining Age to sprightly Youth gives place  As these must do the next Theatric Race  Mr BENJAMIN VICTOR  I Might have in one respect omitted this Gentleman as he only performed for his own Diversion But as few Persons that are not profess'd Actors know better as I may say the Dignity of the  Theatre  than himself I hope he will excuse this mentioning him to the Public He was bred in  London  had a genteel Education and from a just Way of  Thinking and Acting has improved his Merits Tho' he does not make Poetry his Profession yet I have seen several correct little Poems of his As he has wrote many agreeable Pieces that have never come to the Press I shall beg Leave as a Taste to give one that has

Comedy of  Beaumont  and  Fletcher  Mrs VINCENT formerly Miss BINKS  WHEN I left  England  Seven Years ago was a very promising young Actress and I am informed from those that have seen her on the Stage  here  that she is greatly improved which I am apt to believe from the  Judgment of the Manager who would certainly give the best Parts to the best Performers 'Tis the Interest of all Theatrical Managers to perform every thing in the best Manner to do otherwise would be hurting themselves  That Teacher might be justly call'd a Fool  Who plac'd a Dunce in his first Class at School  ROBERT WILKS  Esq  THE Ancestors of this most excellent Comedian were seated many Ages in an affluent Inheritance at  Bromsgrove  Bromsgrove  is one of the chief trading Towns in the County for the finest Broad Cloths containing about wellbuilt Houses on the Brink of the River  Salwarp  measur'd Miles from  London  in  Worcestershire  where most of the chief Inhabitants bear the Name of  Wilks  The Grandfather of our excellent Comedian Judge  Wilks  in the Civil Wars rais'd a Troop of Horse at his own Expence for the Service of the unfortunate King  Charles  the First which was commanded by Col  Wilks  Brother to the Judge and Great Uncle to our Comedian  In that unnatural War the Family suffered greatly by Rapine and Persecution which was the main Motive that sent  Edward Wilks  Esq  with his Wife and the shatter'd Remains of an ample Fortune to  Dublin  for the Security of his Person c  Our great Comedian was born at  Rathfarnham  near  Dublin  in the Year His Father gave him a genteel Education He wrote an excellent fine masterly Hand with such Celerity that was surprising His Genius recommended him to Secretary  Southwell  who confirm'd him one of his Clerks when Eighteen Years of Age  His first Inclination to the  Theatre  proceeded from the Praises of Mr  Richards  then an Actor on the  Dublin  Stage Mr  Richards  lodg'd near Mr  Wilks  and being intimate with each other he used to hold the Book of the Play to hear if  Richards  was perfect in the Part he was then studying Mr  Wilks  used to read the introductive Speeches with such proper Emphasis Cadence and all the various Passions that the Encomiums given by Mr  Richards  began to fire his Mind for the  Drama  It was with very little Persuasion he ventured to act privately the  Colonel  in the  Spanish Fryar  at Mr  Ashbury  's the ensuing  Christmas  where he received such Approbation from that great Master as confirm'd his Intention  The first Part he played on the Theatre was  Othello  with the utmost Applause and as he told me pleased all but himself He went on with great Success for Two Years when his Friend Mr  Richards  Mr  Ashbury  informed me that Mr  Richards  was a very good Actor both in Tragedy and Comedy but not overhappy in his personal Appearance  advised him to try his  Fortune in  England  and gave him Letters of Recommendation to Mr  Betterton  who receiv'd him very kindly and entered him at Fifteen Shillings a Week  His first Appearance on the  English  Stage was in the Part of the young Prince in the  Maid's Tragedy  a very insignificant Character requiring little more than an amiable Figure Mr  Betterton  performed  Melantius  but when that veteran Actor came to address him on the Battlements to excuse himself for the Death of the King in the Play Mr  Wilks  affirmed to me that the Dignity of Mr  Betterton  struck him with such an Awe that he had much ado to utter the little he had to say Mr  Betterton  observing his Confusion said to him  Young Man this Fear does not ill become you a Horse that sets out at the Strength of his Speed will soon be jaded  However Mr  Wilks  soon shook off his Apprehensions and began to rise in the Esteem of the Audience and better Parts gained him a better Salary  He often assisted Mr  Harris  an eminent Dancingmaster at that time in teaching his Scholars and by his genteel Address gained the Affection of a young Lady Daughter to  Ferdinand Knapton  Esq  Steward of the New Forest in  Hampshire  and by Consent of the Father they were joined in Wedlock By this Gentlewoman he had one Son and Daughter the Son died in his Youth the Daughter was  married to Captain  Price  Mrs  Price  did not survive her Marriage above a Twelvemonth She expired childless in the Year the th Year of her Age  to whom he made up a Fortune of a thousand Pounds  Mr  Wilks  's Finances not well answering the State of an increasing Family he press'd for an Addition to his Salary which every Person but the  Manager  thought he deserved but his Request was not complied with  Mr  Ashbury  in  Ireland  hearing of his Discontent came over on Purpose to engage him He agreed with Mr  Wilks  for Sixty Pounds a Year and a clear Benefit which in those Times was much more than any other Actor ever had When he went to take his Leave of Mr  Betterton  the  Manager  was with him That great Actor expressed some Concern at his leaving the Company "I fansy said Mr  Betterton  that Gentleman pointing to the Manager if he has not too much Obstinacy to own it will be the first that repents your parting for if I foresee aright you will be greatly wanted here"  Mr  Wilks  told me this Speech gave him infinite Pleasure and made him resolve to search into himself to find out what Mr  Betterton  's known Judgment seemed to promise he might find Praise from an Adept in any Science will excite Emulation and with some People do more than Reward From this Time Mr  Wilks  grew more assiduous and thought every Moment lost that was not laid  out upon his Studies till he arrived at that supreme Excellence even now remembered by innumerable Judges of the  Drama  It was not long before the prophetic Words of Mr  Betterton  were fulfilled For the unfortunate Death of  Mountford  Mr  William Mountford  was accounted an excellent Comedian and Mr  Wilks  often confess'd he was the Glass that he ever adjusted himself by  Mr  Mountford  was basely murder'd by a Thrust thro' the Back while a false Friend held him in his Arms with a treacherous Embrace in  Norfolkstreet  in the  Strand  in the Year He was the Author of the following Plays  Injur'd Love or The Ambitious Father A Tragedy  The Successful Strangers A Comedy    Greenwich  Park A Comedy  The Life and Death of Dr  Faustus  with the Humours of  Harlequin  and  Scaramouch  An Entertainment of Three Acts  was the Sickness of all their genteel Comedies till his Parts could be supplied Mr  Wilks  therefore was immediately sent to with Proposals of Four Pounds a Week which was a Salary equal to Mr  Betterton  This was too advantageous an Offer to be refused therefore he prepared for his Journey privately Mr  Ashbury  was so unwilling to part with him that he procured an Order from the Duke of  Ormond  then Lord Lieutenant to prevent his going but a particular Friend giving him timely Notice thereof he went secretly to  Hoath  where a Boat waited to convey him on board and he landed safe in  England  The first Part he performed of  Mountford  's was  Palamede  Mr  Cibber  has from this Play of  Marriage Alamode  and the Comedy Part of  Secret Love  or the  Maiden Queen  compounded with some Ingredients of his own an excellent Comedy called the  Comical Lovers  in  Dryden  's  Marriage Alamode  a Comedy with such extraordinary Success as he often said it made him almost mad with Joy I need say no more of his Progress in Success than that he sailed in the full Tide of Fortune till he arrived safely to reign unrivalled to his Death  And as a Reward for his great Merit he was joined in the Patent granted by Queen  Anne  in the Year He was also Manager of the Whole and I shall not take from the Merit of others when I say From his sole Directions the Stage gained new Life and Reward followed the Industry For a continued Course of the Three Managers for more than Twenty Years the Stage was in full Perfection their GreenRooms  GreenRooms are the Chambers where the principal Performers retire till they are called to their Entrances where they are to go on the Stage  were free from Indecencies of every Kind and might justly be compared to the most elegant DrawingRooms of the Prime Quality No Fops or Coxcombs ever shew'd their Monkey Tricks there but if they chanc'd to thrust in were aw'd into Respect even Persons of the First Rank and Taste of both Sexes would often mix with the Performers without any  Stain to their Honour or Understanding And indeed Mr  Wilks  was so genteelly elegant in his Fancy of Dress for the Stage that he was often followed in his Fashion tho' in the Street his Plainness of Habit was remarkable  In  March  Mrs  Wilks  Mrs  Wilks  was interr'd in the Church of  CoventGarden  with the following Inscription on her Tomb wrote by her Husband  Beneath this Marble  Lies  Elizabeth Wilks  late Wife to  Robert Wilks  of this Parish Gent  The Purity of her Mind which appeared in all the  Duties of a virtuous Life made her a good Wife  Daughter Mother and Friend  Her Affection was like her Piety  Constant as unfeigned to her last Moment  In Memory of her Virtues  This Monument was erected by her Husband  She died the st of  March  in the d Year of her Age  left this World to the inconsolable Sorrow of her worthy Husband He continued unmarried upwards of Seven Years In the mean time he renewed his Acquaintance with Mrs  Fell  Relict of  Charles Fell  Esq  of an antient Family in  Lancashire  and married her This Gentlewoman's maiden Name was  Brown  of a reputable Family in  Sussex  I shall relate an unfortunate Accident concerning  John Brown  Esq  the Father of Mr  Wilks  's Second Wife which he informed me of This Gentleman lived near  Spelmonden  in  Kent  on a handsome Estate He took great Delight in Shooting One Day he went out with his Servant to his usual Diversion they sprung some Game that flew over a neighbouring Hedge he ordered his Servant to follow and observe them on the other Side while he would take care on the Side where he was The Hedge was of great Extent and Mr  Brown  went slowly by the Side in Expectation of the Game at last they came and he fired The Servant on the other Side of the Hedge did the same and unfortunately shot his Master in the Face only with Two Grains of Shot but alas one in each Eye that for ever deprived him of Sight Yet Mr  Wilks  inform'd me he was as chearful a Gentleman as ever he conversed with and would lead him to every particular Fruittree in his large Garden and nominate the Fruit they bore and that very Servant the  Innocent Guilty  as he call'd him lived with him at the Time I received this Account from Mr  Wilks    Mr  Wilks  's Excellence in Comedy was never once disputed but the best Judges extol him for the different Parts in Tragedy as  Hamlet Castalio  in the  Orphan Ziphares  in  Mithridates Edgar  in King  Lear Norfolk  in the  Albion Queens Piercy  in  Anna Bullen  Earl of  Essex Shore Macduff Moneses  in  Tamerlane Jaffeir  in  Venice Preserv'd  and a countless Catalogue of other Parts in Tragedy which he was allowed to perform in their full Perfection  He was not only perfect in every Part he acted but in those that were concerned with him in every Scene which often prevented Mistakes  But let me have recourse to other Pens for his Excellencies One writes thus  No sooner had Mr  Wilks  left the  Hibernian  Stage and appeared on the  British  but that sinking Theatre raised its drooping Head and what was reckoned almost a Scandal to belong to has ever since been by that great Man's Management and Justice raised to the greatest Theatre in the Universe  Female Tatler  The Person and Behaviour of Mr  Wilks  in the Part of  Essex  has no small Share in conducing to the Popularity of the Play  Tatler  N  o  Vol  This Performance  The Trip to the Jubilee  is the greatest Instance that we can have of the irresistible Force of proper Action Mr  Wilks  enters into the Part with so much Skill that the Gallantry the Youth and Gaiety of a young Man of a plentiful Fortune is looked upon with as much Indulgence on the Stage as in real Life  Tatler  N  o    In the Preface to the same Play the Author says "Whenever the Stage has the Misfortune to lose Mr  Wilks  that  Wildair  may go to the  Jubilee  "  In the Preface to the  Stratagem  the Author ends thus  The Reader may find some Faults in this Play which my Illness prevented the amending of but there is great Amends made in the Representation which cannot be matched no more than  the friendly and indefatigable Care of Mr  Wilks  to whom I chiefly owe the Success of the Play  Here is enough said to illustrate the personal Qualifications of this Gentleman as an Actor therefore let me attempt to delineate his Mind  His Purse was ever open to proper Objects of Charity and I have often seen Tears in his Eyes at the Relation of any Misfortune that befel others He was ever the first Proposer in any joint Charity from the Theatrical Stock and I am convinced has often prevailed upon their unwilling Liberality His Care of the Orphan Daughters of Mr  Farquhar  by giving them several Benefit Plays continued to the last of his Days and in losing him they have in Reality lost a Father But I hope his constant Stream of Bounty has placed them above Want In short his private Acts of Charity are numberless I shall add one in particular  A Gentleman a Native of  Ireland  whose Name is  Smith  who received a liberal Education in  TrinityCollege Dublin  brought a Tragedy to the Managers of the TheatreRoyal in  DruryLane  for their Approbation The Play was read and returned with Desire to make some Alterations for the next Season This postponing but ill agreed with our Author's Circumstances that loudly called for a speedy Supply Mr  Wilks  knowing the ill State of his Finances bought a Night of his Brother  ther Managers and gave it to Mr  Smith  for a Benefit Yet he did not think that susficient but used all his Interest to make it truly a Benefit and put a Hundred Guineas clear in the Author's Pocket with which he took Leave of his Benefactor and the Muses embarked for  Holland  where he put himself under the Tuition of the great  Boerhaave  at  Leyden  and in time profited so well that his great Master of Medicine sent him to  Petersburgh  at the Request of the  Czarina  where at his first Arrival a handsome Pension was settled upon him I have seen several Letters from this Gentleman to Mr  Wilks  a Copy of one I procured from his Widow which I shall give as a Note for the Singularity of it  Petersburgh  Jan  O S  My dear Friend  I Received yours with inexpressible Pleasure by Captain  Pawlet  with the Books How shall I thank you But no Matter  You desire I would give you an Account of myself  I am at this Instant alone in my Chamber wrapt up to my Nose in Furs before a Woodfire that might serve you in the Street for a Night of Rejoicing for Stoves I do not use on my Right of the Table my Ink and Paper on the Left a Bottle of good  Nantz  tho' I'm no Sot and yet the Moon and Stars shine bright without a Cloud large enough to cover a Tragedy Plume When Day appears I must see it with a Candle for my Windows will be covered with a cold Coat of Frost more of a thick  Substance  than the Glass and yet it is not three to one but Tomorrow's Sun's short Progress will uncloath 'em and leave 'em slark naked again If I were to appear before you fashionably dress'd you would take me for a  Russian  Bear I am so clumsily  befurr'd  not only  from Top to Toe  as  Hamlet  says but Head and Feet  I have Practice more than I desire this cold cold Weather and well paid A Physician to the Crown here never wants Practice I was sent for Yesterday to a Man that had been dead some Hours a Nobleman's Servant frozen to Death behind his Master's  Sled  but I left him to be bury'd first receiving my Fee and a Pint Glass of Brandy for I am not holy enough to work Miracles  I have a good Stomach and eat and drink well Here is no want of any thing but Warmth in our long Winter and Coolness in our short Summer being many Degrees different from you in both However we have our Winter Fires and Summer shady Groves and Bowers I have served my Time to the Language of the Country and it is now become my Servant My Royal Mistress is a good plump roundfac'd Lady and does me the Honour to ask me some Questions now we understand each other Were you here you would have but a small Share in Amours Love goes by Weight in  Russia  and those that thrive in Flesh succeed best A native Painter would draw  Venus  like an overgrown Hostess and  Harper  would make an excellent  Mars  in Picture lolling at the Feet of the fat  Cyprian  Goddess Were the wellgrown Bear here he would be  Bojar  or Lord at his first Landing My greatest Task is to keep sober amongst a Nation of Drunkards Captain  Pawlet  will bring you a few Furs with a small Quantity of Ermin the Product of  Russia  Were I settled in  Geeenland  I should do the same and land you a  Whale  or a  White Bear  You will receive them without any other Weight but themselves But who gave me these Furs this Affluence this Royal Mistress this happy Situation A Man just of your Age and Stature If you can't find him out ask my dear and worthy Friend Sir  Harry Wildair  and tell him at the same time the Grain was his and the Reaper with the Crop shall ever be at his Command c    This great and good Man continued to charm till the last of his performing on the  Stage He left this World the th of  September  and I must declare I have not yet seen his Equal in  Comedy  His disconsolate Widow caused the following Inscription to be put on his Monument in  St Paul's Coventgarden  This superexcellent Comedian by his own Request was interr'd at o'Clock at Night to avoid Ostentation yet to pay his Memory the greatest Honour that was ever done to a Subject the Gentlemen of the Choir belonging to the King's Chapel came voluntarily and performed ar  Anthem  prepared for the solemn Occasion  with the Arms of the  Wilks  's Family which are  Three Roses  and a  Rose  for the  Crest  His second Wife lies also in the same Vault lately deceased  Near this Place  In Hopes of a happy Resurrection  Lies the Body of  ROBERT WILKS  Esq  One of the Patentees of his Majesty's Theatre  A Man in private Life  For many amiable Qualities justly esteemed  In Public universally applauded  In the same Vault  United again in Death  Lies his beloved and loving Wife  MARY  Daughter of  John Brown  Esq  of  Spelmonden  In the County of  Kent  Relict of  Charles Fell  Esq  of  Swarthmorehall  In  Lancashire  An affectionate Wife and indulgent Mother  A kind Mistress and a faithful Friend  Her charitable Disposition to the Poor  Was at all times extended to the utmost of Her Power  And flowed from a Heart sensibly affected  With Compassion and Benevolence  There is no Issue left of this excellent Man to perpetuate his Memory but his good Deeds will last for ever I shall finish with two Lines of a Poem wrote upon his Death  Farewel O born with ev'ry Art to please  Politeness Grace Gentility and Ease  Mr HENRY WOODWARD  WAS born in the Year in  London  where he received a genteel Education He is a very thriving  Comedian  and a very peaceable Mimic for he never strikes first but if he receives the first Blow he generally returns it with double the Strength of his Adversary He is an excellent  Harlequin  and has what most of the motleycoat Gentry want an excellent Head to his Heels and if his black Mask should be thrown aside for a whole Age tho' Levity will hardly lie so long obscured yet as a just and pleasing Actor in Comedy  he can never want Encouragement anywhere if Theatres are in Use joined to his good Understanding and Pleasantry His Goodnature is ever conspicuous upon all proper Occasions cool in his Resentments and warm in his Friendships a Man fit for the World and the World for him and knows how to look on Fortune  Fortune a Goddess is to Fools alone  The Wise are always Masters of their own  Mr ROBERT WETHERILT  THIS Person was born at  Stamford  in  Lincolnshire  in the Year where his Father and Mother belonging to a Country Company were then playing He play'd as he inform'd me the Part of the  Duke of York  in  Richard the Third  before he could speak plain so that it may be said he was born an Actor He came with his Mother who was a wellesteemed Actress at that Time to  Drurylane  a Boy where he shewed his rising Genius first in the Part of  'Squire Richard  in the  Provok'd Husband  from thence he went to the Theatre in  Goodman'sFields  where he marry'd the Sister of Mr  Denis Delane  then of that Theatre  In the Year he came over into this Kingdom and may be well remember'd his Excellence in several Parts of Comedy having not yet been outdone I cannot avoid mentioning  a Passage in the Life of this truly good Comedian  While he and his Family belong'd to the TheatreRoyal in  Drurylane  after the Company had finish'd the Season of Playing in  London  which generally is at the End of  May  he with his Father and Mother went for the Summerseason to play at several Towns in  Lincolnshire  the Custom of many of both established Theatres When the Company were summon'd to meet in  London  at the usual Time the latter End of  August  to begin the Winterseason I receiv'd the following short Letter  Grantham  August  SIR  MR  Wetherilt  and his Wife beg you will excuse them to Mr  Wilks  their Son is at the Point of Death They beg an Answer Be pleas'd to direct to your humble Servant  R Stukely Apothecary  in Grantham Lincolnshire  The Meaning why I mention this Letter is that the Son the very Night this Letter was wrote in all Appearance expir'd was stripp'd and wash'd the Bed taken away and he laid stretch'd on a Mat with a Bason of Salt a common Custom in  England  placed on his Stomach the inconsolable Parents remov'd to another House the Coffin brought to the Son's  Chamber and the Windows all open About Eight at Night a Person was sent with a Light to watch the Corpse When she open'd the Door the first Object she perceiv'd was poor  Bob  as he was generally call'd by his Familiars sitting up with his Teeth trembling in his Head and well they might with Cold The Woman in her Fright dropp'd the Candle and scream'd out  The Devil the Devil  This Fright alarm'd another Woman below who ran upstairs to see what was the Matter In the mean time  Bob  with much ado had made a Shift to get from the Bed and taking up the Candle which lay upon the Floor unextinguish'd was creeping to the Door to call for Assistance as naked as from the Womb of his Mother which the two Women perceiving with joint Voices repeated again  A Ghost a Ghost the Devil the Devil  The Master of the House hearing this Uproar ran himself to know the Reason where poor  Bob  the suppos'd Devil and he soon came to a right Understanding He was put into a warm Bed to the unspeakable Joy of his desponding Parents and in ten Days after in  London viva voce  told me the whole Story of his Death  This Accident when real Death paid him a Visit work'd so strongly upon his forlorn Parents that they would not let his Corpse be coffin'd till five Days after he expir'd Vain Hope He died in in the th Year of his Age Both his Parents died soon after him I am sorry to end this Account with saying his  Company was so desirable that he had many Tryals of Skill with his Constitution He was buried in a very genteel Manner in the Round Churchyard  In Tryals of Drinking pray let me assure ye  I never intend to be one of the Jury  Mr THOMAS WALKER  THIS Person was born in the Year In his Youth he was a very promising Actor The Part of  Charles  in the  Nonjuror  a Comedy founded upon  Moliere  's  Tartuff  by Mr  Cibber  which was perform'd at the TheatreRoyal in  Drurylane  in the Year gave him the first Establishment as an Actor The Applause he gain'd from performing the Part of  Macheath  in the  Beggars Opera  was fatal to him He follow'd  Bacchus  too ardently insomuch that his Credit was often drown'd upon the Stage and by Degrees almost render'd him useless  He was the suppos'd Author of two dramatic Pieces  viz The Quakers Opera  and a Tragedy call'd  The Fate of Villainy  This Play he brought to  Ireland  in the Year and prevailed on the Proprietors to act it under the Title of  Love and Loyalty  The second Night was given out for his Benefit but not being able to pay in Half the Charge of the common Expences the Doors were order'd to be kept  shut But I remember few People came to ask the Reason However I fear this Disappointment hasten'd his Death for he survived it but three Days dying in the th Year of his Age a Martyr to what often stole from him a good Understanding  He who delights in Drinking out of Season  Takes wond'rous Pains to drown his manly Reason  Mr THOMAS WRIGHT  THIS Gentleman was born in the Year He is descended of a good Family and had a liberal Education It is with some Concern I say he had  once  a good Fortune  His first Appearance as an Actor in  London  was with Mr  Giffard  at the Theatre in  Goodman'sFields  from whence he removed with that Gentleman to  Lincoln'sInnFields  Theatre and from thence he was invited to the TheatreRoyal in  Drurylane  But receiving some ill Usage from Mr  Fleetwood  then Patentee he came over to this Kingdom in the Year where he appeared to great Advantage in several capital Characters He afterwards went out with a Country Company to several Parts of this Kingdom and is now as I am inform'd Head of a Company of Players in  England  In my Opinion his Deservings  might make him desirable in any regular Theatre he having a proper Person pleasing Voice and being always perfect in what he performs joined to a good Understanding to  feel  what he speaks  But various Causes various Minds employ  Some love to save while others would destroy  Mr JAMES WORSDALE  THIS facetious Person must not be forgot whose Performance as an Actor and a Poet has often diverted the Town He was taught the Use of the Pencil under that celebrated Painter Sir  Godfrey Kneller  I do not pretend to rescue him from the Lash of a Lady who has thought fit to correct him but this I know that I have been in his Company when his quick Imagination has struck out several Pieces of Humour that have given great Pleasure in his Manner of Singing To give one Instance of it He and I were together without any other Company when on the Back of a Playbill he struck out the following Song for his little Opera call'd  A Cure for a Scold  WHoe'er to a Wife  Is link'd for his Life  Is plac'd in a wretched Condition  Tho' plagu'd with her Tricks  Like a Blister she sticks  And Death is his only Physician Poor Man  And Death c  So the Cur who possest  A Bone of the best  Could lick it or leave it at Pleasure  But if to his Tail  'Tis ty'd without fail  He's harass'd and plagu'd without Measure Poor Cur  He's harass'd c  Now what convinces me of the quick Coinage of this Song is that the last Stanza was produced by the Accident of seeing a Dog run at that Instant by the Window with a Bone ty'd to his Tail follow'd by a hooting Mob  This may certainly be said of him that he had an inexhaustible Fund of Goodhumour Goodnature and Generosity and might have had a heavier Purse if he had not been so light of Heart I shall end with two Lines of his own with very little Variation  May be ever from Duns and from Bailiffs be freed  And shake a loose Leg on each Side of the  Tweed  Mr JOHN WATSON  IS a Person worthy of Imitation from his Oeconomy and Behaviour in private Life He belonged to the Stage from his Youth first as a  Prompter  but many Years as an Actor If he does not excel he is ever decent His long Continuance in the Business has made him perfect almost in every Character and such a Person must be extremely useful in a Theatre  He best can guide a Stranger in the Road  Who oft the mazy Labyrinth has trod  Mr JAMES WILLIAMS  MUST not be forgot since what he does he does well and in my Judgment were he put forward in some Parts in Low Comedy his Execution would not lose him any Reputation In one Ingredient to make up a Play I think him the best I have ever known that is a  Propertyman  Propertyman  is the Person that receives a Bill from the  Prompter  for what is necessary in every new or reviv'd Play as Purses Wine Suppers Poison Daggers Halters Axes and many more Implements of Execution with a Thousand other c c c    His bloodless Weapons only kill in Jest  And those that drink his Poisons fare the best  Mrs WOFFINGTON  THIS amiable Actress was born in  Dublin  of reputable Parents who gave her a genteel Education Her sprightly Genius led her early to the Stage where she made a rapid Progress Her first Establishment was in the Character of Sir  Harry Wildair  in this Kingdom which was the first Part she perform'd in  Coventgarden  Theatre and had a successive Progress of upwards of twenty Nights with universal Applause The Manager of that Theatre having some Dispute with her relating to Salary as I am inform'd she engag'd with the Manager of  Drurylane  where she has reign'd in full Perfection unrival'd in the Parts she undertakes till her late Reestablishment at  Coventgarden  As Merit too often creates Envy the little World the Theatre is not free from it This agreeable Actress in the Part of Sir  Harry  coming into the GreenRoom said pleasantly  In my Conscience I believe Half the Men in the House take me for one of their own Sex  Another Actress reply'd  It may be so but in my Conscience the other Half can convince them to the contrary  As the Theatre is the Test of other Peoples Wit why may they not find a little among themselves  I am informed she now shines in several capital Parts in Tragedy viz  Cleopatra  in  All for Love Jane Shore Monimia Calista  in the  Fair Penitent  c  I shall mention as my last Note an Accident that fell out at this Play the first Season it was perform'd in the Year which I gather'd from that Stage Chronicle Mr  John Bowman  Lothario  after he is kill'd by  Altamont  in the th Act lies dead by Proxy in the th raised on a Bier covered with Black by the  Propertyman  and the Face whitened by the Barber the Coat and Perriwig generally filled by one of the Dressers Most of the capital Actors in the establish'd Theatres have generally a Dresser to themselves tho' they are paid by the Manager to be ready on all Occasions for Stageguards Attendance c  Mr  Powell  played  Lothario  and one  Warren  his Dresser claimed a Right of lying for his Master and performing the dead Part of  Lothario  which he proposed to act to the best Advantage tho'  Powell  was ignorant of the Matter The Fifth Act began and went on as usual with Applause but about the Middle of the distressful Scene  Powell  called aloud for his Man  Warren  who as loudly replied from the Bier on the Stage  Here Sir Powell  who as I said before was ignorant of the Part his Man was doing repeated without Loss of Time  Come here this Moment you Son of a Whore or I'll break all the Bones in your Skin Warren  knew his hasty Temper therefore without any Reply jump'd off with all his Sables about him which unfortunately were tied fast to the Handles of the Bier and dragg'd after him But this was not all the Laugh and Roar began in the Audience till it frighten'd poor  Warren  so much that with the Bier at his Tail he threw down  Calista  Mrs  Barry  and overwhelm'd her with the Table Lamp Book Bones together with all the Lumber of the Charnelhouse He tugg'd till he broke off his Trammels and made his Escape and the Play at once ended with immoderate Fits of Laughter Even the grave Mr  Betterton  Smil'd in the Tumult and enjoy'd the Storm  But he would not let the  Fair Penitent  be play'd any more that Season till poor  Warren  's Misconduct was something forgot    I shall leave this Lady to proceed in her Path of Merit where she still leads with an  Epilogue  wrote purely for her Manner of Speaking And as  Prologues  and  Epilogues  are the most difficult Tasks of both Sexes on the Stage it is to be remark'd but few besides the capital Performers are trusted with them and a good Prologue and Epilogue have often help'd a bad Play out of the Mire or at least sent the Audience home a little better humour'd  EPILOGUE  Design'd for Mrs WOFFINGTON in the Character of a
