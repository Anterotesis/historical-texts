 DIRECTIONS FOR ROASTING  In the first place you must regulate your fire according to the Piece of meat you are to dress If it be a small or thin piece make a pretty little brisk fire but if it be a large joint let a very good fire be laid to cake Take care to keep your fire always clear and let your spit be very clean When the steam draws near the fire it is a sign that the meat is done enough but you will best judge of that from the time it was put down Observe that in frosty weather all kinds of meat take more time in dressing  To roast Venison  TAKE a haunch of venison and when you have spitted it lay over it a large sheet of white paper then a thin paste with another sheet of paper over it and tie it well to prevent the paste from falling  About five or six minutes before you take it up take off the paper and paste baste it with butter and dredge it with a little flour when you dish it up let it be accompanied with some good gravy in one sauceboat and sweet sauce in another If it be a large haunch it will take three hours roasting The neck and shoulder may be dressed the same way The sauce for venison may be either current jelly warmed or half a pint of red wine with a quarter of a pound of sugar simmered over a clear fire for seven or eight minutes or about half a pint of vinegar with a proportionate quantity of sugar simmered till it becomes of the consistence of a syrup  To roast Mutton  If it be a Chine or faddle of mutton you must raise the skin and then skewer it on again for that will prevent its being scorched Strip off the skin about a quarter of an hour before you take it up throw some flour on your meat together with a handful of salt and baste it with butter Roast mutton when served up may be accompanied with French beans broccoli potatoes cauliflower horseradish or water cressesN B Onion sauce is frequently used with a shoulder of mutton either roasted or boiled  To roast Mutton so as to make it eat like Venison  Having procured a fat hindquarter of mutton cut the leg in the shape of a haunch of venison lay it in a pan and pour over it a bottle of red wine in which it must lie twentyfour hours then put it on the spit and baste it with the same liquor and butter all the time it is roasting If you have a good quick fire your meat will be done in two hours You may send it to table with some good gravy in one bason and current jelly in another  To roast a Pig  Put into the belly of your pig a few sage leaves chopped a piece of butter a crust of bread grated and some pepper and salt sew it up spit it and lay it down to a large brisk fire Flour it all over very thick and continue to do so till the eyes begin to start As soon as you find the skin tight and crisp and that the eyes are dropped set two basons in the drippingpan to receive the gravy that comes from it When the pig is done enough put a lump of butter into a cloth and rub all over it till the flour is quite off then take it up into your dish and having cut off the head cut the pig in two down the back chop off the ears and place one upon each shoulder cut the under jaw in two and lay on each side melt some butter put it into the gravy that

knife separate the callapach from the callapee or the back from the belly part down to the shoulders so as to come at the entrails which take out and clean as you would those of any other animal and throw them into a tub of clean water taking great care not to break the gall but to cut it from the liver and throw it away Then separate each distinctly and put the guts into another vessel open them with a small penknife from end to end wash them clean and draw them through a woollen cloth in warm water to clear away the slime and then put them into clean cold water till they are used with the other part of the entrails which must all be cut up small to be mixed in the baking dishes with the meat This done separate the back and belly pieces entirely cutting away the four fins by the upper joint which scald peel off the loose skin and cut them into small pieces laying them by themselves  either in another vessel or on the table ready to be seasoned Then cut off the meat from the belly  art and clean the back from the lungs kidneys  and that meat cut into pieces as small as a wal  ut laying it likewise by itself After this you are  scald the back and belly pieces pulling off the  ell from the back and the yellow skin from the belly when all will be white and clean and with the kitchen cleaver cut those up likewise into pieces about the bigness or breadth of a card Put these pieces into clean cold water wash them out and place them in a heap on the table so that each part  ay lie by itself  The meat being thus prepared and laid separate or seasoning mix two third parts of salt or rather more and onethird part of Cayenne pepper black pepper and a nutmeg and mace pounded fine and mixed together the quantity to be proportioned to the size of the turtle so that in each dish there may be about three spoonfuls of seasoning to every twelve pounds of meat  Your meat being thus seasoned get some sweet herbs such as thyme savory c let them be dried and rubbed fine and having provided some deep dishes to bake it in which should be of the common brown ware put in the coarsest part of the meat at the bottom with about a quarter of a pound of butter in each dish and then some of each of the several parcels of meat so that the dishes may be all alike and have equal portions of the different parts of the turtle and between each laying of the meat strew a little of the mixture of sweet herbs all your dishes within an inch and a half or two inches of the top boil the blood of the turtle and put into it then lay on forcemeat balls made of veal or fowl highly seasoned with the same seasoning as the turtle put in each dish a gill of good Madeira wine and as much water as it will conveniently hold then break over it five or six eggs  to keep the meat from scorching at the top and over that shake a handful of shred parsley to make it look green when done put your dishes into and oven made not to make bread and in an hour and a half or two hours according to the size of your dishes it will be sufficiently done  GARDEN STUFF  In dressing all kinds of vegetables the cook must be particularly careful that they are properly cleansed before they are put into the pot To effect this take off the outer leaves and such as have received injury by the weather then examine the inner leaves with great nicety that there be no small snails or catterpillars between them which is frequently the case particularly in cabbages and savoys When you have done this wash them well in a pail or pan of water and put them in a cullender to drain Before you put your water that is to boil them into the saucepan examine the vessel carefully that it be clean and free from sand or grease You must likewise be very attentive to the time of their boiling for if they are done too much they will be spoiled All greens should have a little crispness which will not be the case if they are overboiled neither will they look so well or eat so sweet as when properly done  To boil Asparagus  First cut the white ends off about six inches from the head and scrape them from the green part downward very clean As you scrape them throw them into a pan of clean water and after a little soaking tie them up in small even bundles When your water boils put them in and boil them up quick but by overboiling they will lose their heads Cut a slice of bread for a toast and bake it brown on both sides When your grass is done take them up carefuily dip the toast in the asparagus water and lay  it in the bottom of your dish then lay the heads of  he asparagus on it with the white ends outwards  our a little melted butter over the heads cut an orange into small quarters and stick them between or garnish  To boil Artichokes  Wring off the stalks close to the artichokes  hrow them into water

them four double putting the two selvages together then the ends together and wash it the way the selvage goes to prevent their f  aying  then take clear water let it not be too hot for that makes them yellow and strain the water through a cloth then take the best soap a small quantity as your wash is put it upon a clean stick beat up your lather let it not be with a whisk because it will make the water yellow and leaves splinters in the water which will tear the muslins  After the lather is beat put in your foulest muslins one by one till you have put all in let them stand to soak then wash them one by one to  prevent tearing whilst the water is warm then squeeze them between both hands for fear of leaving the dirty suds in them As you wash them out shake them open into a dish then let your second lather be beat up as your first only let the water be hotter but not scalding hot wash them whilst they are warm and squeeze them as before then as to your third lather let your water be scalding hot but not boiling for that makes the water yellow then take a small quantity of powderblue put it in a cup and put water to it a little more than will wet it then shake the cup about afterwards pour it into the scalding water and stir it about till it is blue enough then take soap and beat up your lather as before and put the yellowest muslins in first then let them be covered over with a clean cloth You may wash them out whilst warm or let them stand all night to clear them  When you wash them out take care and wash the blue out then lay them in clear pumpwater if you have not time to starch them all at once put no more in your starch than you can finish in one day for lying in the starch makes them look yellow and streaky Let them be in water till you have time to finish them but do not excued two days  Most starchers boil their muslins but they should not because it wears them out but the scalding and letting muslins lie in the suds do them more good than a boil Likewise observe never to soap your muslins for washing out the soap will cause you to fray the muslins  To rince Muslins before you starch them  Take pumpwater in a clean pan then take a small quantity of blue in a cup and put a little  pumpwater to it shake it about in the cup and pour a little of it in the rinsingwater and stir it about put your whitest muslins in first one by one and in case any blue should settle rub them with your hand lightly in the water and it will come off and if any of your muslins be yellow you must make the rinsingwater a little bluer After you have rinsed them squeeze them one by one very hard because they will not take the starch if any water is left in them and pull them out with dry hands double them upon a clean dry cloth in order to starch them Some people starch them dry but they ought not for it makes them yellow and stiff and is very apt to fray them  To make Starch for the Muslins  Take a pint of pump water to a quarter of a pound of starch put the water in a skillet and put it over a clear fire till it is lukewarm then put in your starch keep it stirring slowly one way till it boils one boil and no more then pour it into a pan cover it with a plate till it is cold when it is cold take some upon your hand and some blue in the other hand then mix them together but make it not too blue for the less blue the better You need not make any more at a time keep it not above a week for that will make your muslins look yellow Take your muslins doubled as before one by one then spread the starch with your hand but not too thick first on one side and then on the other but not open it then blue the finest muslins first and then the thicker for the starch that comes out of the finest will starch the thick ones and the same starch that comes out of the muslins will starch aprons caps and handkerchiefs for thin starch is best for them because they must not be too stiff  When you have starched the muslins lay them in an earthen dish kneading them with your double fist till the starch sticks about your hands then squeezing them hard wipe them with a dry cloth after that open them and rub them slightly through your hands  When you have opened them and rubbed them take the two ends and so clap them between your hands pull them out very well to you and from you to prevent the fraying Be sure your hands are dry  If any of the starch remains on your hands it will fray the muslin dry them well and as you pull them out hold them against the light to see if they are clapped enough  If any thing looks shining that is the starch you must rub it over gently when they are clapped enough you will observe them to fly asunder and not stick to your hands but observe to clap very thick and very hard for if you let them dry they will be limber so that when you see no shining they are clapped enough You must never clap them single for that frays and tears them neither clap by the fire except in frosty weather for that spoils the colour  For the ironing of muslins pull them out double on the board as smooth and even as you can and so on till you finish about six one upon another then with your boxiron iron the under two first because that is the driest and should be pretty dry but not quite dry that you may iron them even and prevent fraying Let fine plain muslin be ironed upon a soft woollen cloth but if you have any that is coarse or thick you must first iron them upon a damp cloth and then afterwards upon your ironingcloth the wrong side  As for lawns in the washing and rinsing do them as you do muslins make a very thin starch  but not water starch dip them in and squeeze them out hard wipe them with a dry cloth very hard and clap them carefully for they are very apt to slip then fold them up and put them into a dry pan when they are clapped enough If you touch them with any wet it will leave a sort of thick look and so will muslins You may iron them on a damp cloth like the muslins but not with too hot an iron and also iron them on the wrong side as you do the thick muslins  You must not starch with starch left from other things therefore make fresh as before and see that the same be a little matter bluer than before  As for nightcaps aprons c you must starch them in very thin starch which comes from the muslins but it must be thicker than water starch a small matter of clapping serves them but observe that they are clear you must also pull them out towards the gathers to prevent the fraying them Every way double them and lay them on the board as even as you can and let them lie till they are pretty near dry then put them even and iron them on the wrong sides  To do lace the best way you must sew tape to each side of the lace then wash it amongst other muslins or by itself in three lathers and if it looks not white put it into warm buttermilk and let it lie a day then hang it to dry and then wash it out in two or three lathers but the lathers must be blue after which take it out and pin it upon your board by the tapes very even then take muslins the length of the lace and dip it in water starch and so lay it upon the lace till it dries observe not to squeeze any of the starch out of the muslin  When the lace is dry take off the tapes after which pick the purls and the foot very tenderly  If you open the purls you must make a round hardish pillow and lay paper on it which will shew the purls the plainer afterwards lay the lace upon the paper and with a long slender needle with a bit of wax at the head you may easily open them if they are well picked out at first after you have opened them lay them upon a board with a muslin over them and iron them with an iron not too hot  VARIOUS RECEIPTS  To take Iron Moulds or Stains of Claret Ink c out of Muslins Table Linen c  IF your muslins be ironmoulded take a chaffingdish of clear coals set a plate over it with some sorrel in it then put some salt upon the plate afterwards take some more sorrel in a bit of muslin and squeeze the juice upon it let it lie till it is very hot then take the stained place and squeeze it very hard then take fresh sorrel and salt and use it as before till the stain is gone out the minute you see the stain is out wash it in three or four lathers till it has done looking green  To get Spots of Ink out of Linen  Take the linen and let that part of it that the ink

there till it is cold and rub the stained places in the milk till you see they are quite out  SOAP  Be careful in chusing the oldest soap you can for that which is newmade not only spoils the colour of the linen but also does not go so far  How to wash Silk Stockings  Make a strong lather with soap and pretty hot then lay the stockings on a table take a piece of very coarse rough cloth roll it up and rub them with it as hard as you can turning them several times from one side to the other till they have passed through tree lathers then rinse them in three or four waters till not the least tincture of the soap remains and when you find them quite clear hang them up to dry without wringing wrong side outwards When they are about half dry take them down and pull them out with your hands into shape let them lie a while and  smooth them with your iron on the wrongside  RECEIPTS for PRESERVING and IMPROVING BEAUTY  To make a fine Pomatum for the Skin  HAVING cut two pounds of hog'slard

boil a pound of orangeflowers a little while and put them to the brandy save the water and with that make a syrup to sweeten it  Of Brewing Strong OCTOBER BEER  CARE in the first place must be taken that the malt be very clean and when it is ground it should stand four and twenty hours at least in the sacks  The quantity is five quarters of malt to three hogsheads of beer and eighteen pounds of hops unless the malt be pale dried then there must be added three or four pounds more  The choice of liquor for brewing is of considerable advantage the softest and cleanest water is the best  You are to boil your first liquor adding a handful or two of hops to it then before your strike it over to your malt cool it in as much liquor as will bring it to a temper not to scald the malt for it is a fault not to take the liquor as high as possible but not to scald  The next liquors do the same  And indeed all your liquors ought to be taken as high may be that is not to scald  When you let your wort from your malt into the underback put to it a handful or two of hops it will preserve it from that accident which brewers call Blinking or Foxing  In boiling your worts the first wort boil high or quick for the quicker the wort is boiled the better it is  The second boil more than the first and the third or last more than the second  In cooling lay your worts thin and let each be well cooled and care must be taken in letting them down into the tun that you do it leisurely to the end that as little of the foeces or sediment as  possible may pass with it which causes the fermentation to be fierce or mild for  Note  There is in all fermented liquors salt and sulphur and to keep these two bodies in a due proportion that the salt does not exalt itself above the sulphur consists a great Part of the art in brewing  When your wort is first let into your tun put but a little yeast to it and let it work by degrees quietly and if you find it works but moderate whip in the yeast two or three times or more till you find your drink well fermented for without a full opening of the body by fermentation it will not be perfectly fine nor will it drink clean or light  When you cleanse do it by a cock from your tun placed six inches from the bottom to the end that most of the sediment may be left behind which may be thrown on your malt to mend your smallbeer  When your drink is tunned fill your vessel full let it work at the bung hole and have a reserve in a small cask to fill it up and do not put any of the drink which will be under the yeast after it is worked over into your vessels but put it by itself into another cask for it will not be so good as your other in the cask  This done you must wait for the finishing the fermentation then stop it close and let it stand till the Spring for brewing ought to be done in the month of October that it may have time to settle and digest all the winter season  In the Spring you must unstop your venthole and thereby see whether your drink doth ferment or not for as soon as the warm weather comes your drink will have another fermentation which when it is over let it be again well stopped and stand till September or longer and then peg it if you find it pretty fine the hop well rotted and of a good taste for drinking  Another Way to brew Ale  Allow five bushels and a half of malt to half a hogshead of ale put into your mashingtub fortyfive gallons of liquor because onethird part of the liquor will be soaked up by the malt and a sixthpart will waste in boiling For the second wort put but a little more liquor than you intend to make drink and if you have a large quantity of malt you may make a third wort putting in liquor according to the quantity you would have  Another Way of brewing Strong and Small Beer  Let the water boil before you put it into the mashingvat and let it stand till the steam is off about one hogshead of water then take your malt and strew it in with a handbowl another keeping it stirring till it grows thick then put in more water and malt as before till you have got your quantity reserve some malt to cover the top about one inch thick let it stand three hours then draw it off at the bottom and pour it in at the top till it runs fine put your hops to the fine liquor and keep them stirring till your liquor is ready to boil then put them into the copper  Twenty bushels of malt will make two hogsheads of strong and four of small beer Ten pounds of hops are sufficient Or twenty bushels of malt will make four hogsheads of good ale and two of small beer but then you must put but eight pounds of hops to it and let it not boil above an hour and an half  Of cleaning and sweetening Casks  If your cask is a butt then with cold water first rinse out the lees clean and have ready boiling or very hot water which put in and with a long stale and a little birch fastened to its end scrub  the bottom as well as you can At the same time let there be provided another shorter broom of about a foot and a half long that wich one hand may be so employed in the upper and other parts as to clean the cask well So in a hogshead or other smaller vessel the one handed short broom may be used with water or with water and sand or ashes and be effectually cleansed the outside of the cask about the bunghole should be well washed least the yeast as it works over carries some of its filth with it  But to sweeten a barrel kilderkin firkin or pin in the great brewhouses they put them over the copperhole for a night together that the steam of the boiling water or wort may penetrate into the wood this way is such a furious searcher that unless the cask is new hooped just before it will be apt to fall in pieces  Another Way  We take a pottle or more of stone lime and put it into the cask on this pour some water and stop it up directly shaking it well about  Another  Having got a long linen rag dip it in melted brimstone light it at the end and let it hang pendant with the upper part of the rag fastened to the wooden bung this is a most quick sure way and will not only sweeten but help to fine the drink  Another  Or to make your cask more pleasant you may use the vintner's way thus Take four ounces of stone brimstone one ounce of burnt allum and two ounces of brandy melt all these in an earthen  it three pails of water bung it immediately with a wood or cork bung and shake it well about for a quarter of an hour and let it stand a day and night and it will bring off the red colour and alter the taste of the cask very much  To fine relish and strengthen Amber Beer  Take one gallon of wheat flour six pounds of molossus four pounds of Malaga raisins one gallon of malt spirits free of any burnt or other ill tang and two small handfuls of salt Make all up into dumplings and put them into the bunghole of the cask or butt It will cause a fermentation therefore do not stop up too soon  To cure a Butt of Ropy Beer  Mix two handfuls of beanflour with one handful of salt and it will answer the end very well  Another Way  Take some hops that have been well infused or stewed on purpose two hours mix these with the wort they were stewed in and some other strong wort and put into your beer  Another Way  Beat an ounce of allum very fine and mix it with two handfuls of horsebean flour and put it into your cask  To feed a Butt of Beer  Bake a rye loaf of twopence price with a pretty deal of nutmeg in it then cut it in pieces and put it in a bag of hops with some wheat and put them altogether into your cask  To cure Musty Drink  Run it through some hops that have been boiled in strong wort and afterwards work it with twoparts new drink to one of the musty old this is called Vamping and is a cure for musty fox'd or stinking beer  To feed and give a fine Flavour to a Barrel of Beer  Put six seabiscuits into a bag of hops and put it altogether into the cask  To fine Drink in twentyfour Hours  Put a piece of lime made from soft not hard chalk about as big again as a hen's egg which will disturb the liquor and cause it afterwards to be fine and draw off brisk at the last though flat before this quantity will do for a kilderkin  To recover a Kilderkin of stale Small Beer  Put two ounces of good hops and one pound of mellow fat chalk broke into about six pieces into the bunghole and immediately stop it up close In three days you may tap it and it will prove sound and pleasant to the last  SHERBET  To make Sherbet  HAVING pounded calves feet with part of a fillet of veal cleared from the fat put them into a  pot with a proportionable quantity of water and whitewine let them boil for a considerable time and take off the scum carefully When your meat comes to rags and there is only left a third part of the broth strain it through a cloth and skim off all the fat with two or three feathers Afterward turn the whole mess into a pan with a stick of cinnamon two or three cloves a little lemonpeel and as much sugar as will serve to make it a pleasant liquor Let all boil together clarify it with the white of an egg whip'd and pass it through the strainingbag When this liquor is to be kept for a long time it is requisite to allow two pounds of sugar for every quart of broth or juice of meat observing for the rest the former directions But at last the liquor is to be boiled to its pearled degree and put into bottles  METHEGLIN  To make White Metheglin  YOU must take sweetmarjoram sweetbriar buds strawberryleaves and violets of each two handfuls double violets if they are to be had broad thyme borage and agrimony of each two handfuls six or eight tops of rosemary the seeds of carraways coriander and fennel of each four spoonfuls and six or eight large blades of mace Boil all these ingredients in sixteen gallons of water for three quarters of an hour or better scum and strain the liquor and having stood till it is lukewarm put to it as much of the best honey as will make it bear an egg the breadth of a sixpence above the water then boil it again as long as any scum will rise and set it to cool when it is almost cold put in a pint of new ale yeast and when it has worked till you perceive the yeast to fall turn it up and suffer it to work in the cask till the yeast is done rising fill it up every day with some of the same liquor stopping it up Put into it in a bag  a couple of nutmegs sliced a few cloves mace and cinnamon all unbruised and a grain or two of musk  CYDER  To make Cyder  GET apples so thoroughly ripe that they will easily fall by shaking the tree the apples proper are Pippins Pomewaters Harveys or other apples of a watery juice either grind or pound them and squeeze them in a hairbag put the juice up into a seasoned cask  The cask is to be seasoned with a rag dipped in brimstone tied to the end of a stick and put it in burning into the bunghole of the cask and when the smoak is gone wash it with a little warm liquor that has run through a second straining of the murc or husk of the apples  Put into the cask when the cyder is in a bit of paste made of flour and tied up in a thin rag let it stand for a week and then draw it off from them the less into another seasoned cask  Some advise to put three or four pounds of raisins into a hogshead and two pounds of sugar to make it work the better  To make Royal Cyder  When the cyder is fine and past its fermentation but not stale put to each gallon of cyder a pint and a half of brandy or spirits drawn off from cyder and also half a pint of cyder sweets to every gallon of cyder more or less according to the tartness or harshness of the cyder The spirits  and sweets must be mixed together and mixed with an equal quantity of the cyder and then they are to be put into the cask of cyder and all stirred together with a stick at the bunghole for a quarter of an hour and the bunghole must be well stopped down and the cask rolled about ten or twelve times to mix them well together Let it stand for three or four months and you may either draw it or bottle it off  To recover any Cyder that is decayed although it be quite sour  From ahogshead of pale sour cyder draw out as much as by boiling with six pounds of brown sugar candy will make a perfect syrup Let the syrup stand till it is thoroughly cold pour it into the hogshead and stop it very close This will raise a fe  mentation but not a violent one There must be room in the vessel for the cyder to work and in a few days it will be fit to drink  To make Cyderkin or Water Cyder  After paring half a bushel of apples core them and boil them in a barre  of water till one third part is consumed strain it and put the liquor to a bushel or more of ground or stamp'd apples unboiled let them stand to digest for twentyfour hours press out the liquor and put

inner rind of fir also the rinds of walnuts madder redsaunders and elecampane Some make it of strong beer and spruce beer and where it is designed chiefly for its physical virtues some add watercresses brooklime and wild parsley with six handfuls of horseradish rasped to every hogshead according to their particular inclination or fancy  To make Orgeat  Take two ounces of melonseeds half

readers some General Rules in Cookery  I In all soups you must observe not to put in your thickening 'till your herbs are very tender  II When you boil any greens first soak them near two hours in water and salt or else boil them in water and salt in a copper by themselves with a great quantity of water Boil no meat with them for that discolours them  III Use no iron pans c for they are not proper but let them be copper brass or silver  IV When you fry any Fish first dip them in yolks of eggs and fry them rather in a stewpan over the fire and that will make them of a light gold colour  V White sauces being now more generally used than brown these are chiefly to be made so with cream and adding a little Champaign or French white wine and butter rolled up in flour  VI Parboil all your meats that you use for fricasees or else stewing them too long on the fire will make them hard  VII In roasting or boiling a quarter of an hour to every pound of meat at a steady fire is the best rule that can be given to do it to perfection  VIII When you beat almonds always put in orange flowerwater or rosewater to prevent their turning to oil which they are subject to  IX When you dress mutton pigeons c in blood always wring in some lemonjuice to keep it from changing  X When you grill any thing let it be over a stove of charcoal rather than seacoal it makes it eat sweeter and shorter turn your meat very often  FINIS
