LOVELACE  Esq  Tuesday Aug    _I HAVE been under such concern for the poor man whose exit I almost hourly expect and at the shocking scenes his illness and his agonies exhibit that I have been only able to make memoranda of the melancholy passages from which to draw up a more perfect account for the instruction of us all when the writingappetite shall return  IT is returned Indignation has revived it on receipt of thy letters of Sunday and yesterday by which I have reason to reproach thee in very serious terms that thou hast not kept thy honour with me And if thy breach of it be attended with such effects as I fear it will be I shall let thee know more of my mind on this head  If thou would'st be thought in earnest in thy wishes to move the poor lady in thy favour thy ludicrous behaviour at Smith's when it comes to be represented to her will have a very  consistent  appearance will it notIt will indeed confirm her in her opinion that the  grave  is more to be wishedfor by one of her serious and pious turn than a  husband  incapable either of reflexion or remorse just recovered as thou art from a dangerous at least a sharp illness  I am extremely concerned for the poor unprotected lady she was so excessively low and weak on Saturday that I could not be admitted to her speech And to be driven out of her lodgings when it was fitter for her to be in bed is such a piece of cruelty as he only could be guilty of who could act as thou hast done by such an angel  Canst thou thyself say on reflection that it has not the look of a wicked and hardened sportiveness in thee for the sake of a wanton humour only since it can answer no end that thou proposest to thyself but the direct contrary to hunt from place to place a poor lady who like a harmless deer that has already a barbed shaft in her breast seeks only a refuge from thee in the shades of death  But I will leave this matter upon thy own conscience to paint thee such a scene from my memoranda as thou perhaps wilt be moved by more effectually than by any other Because it is such a one as thou thyself must one day be a principal actor in and as I thought hadst very lately in apprehension And is the last scene of one of thy most intimate friends who has been for the four past days labouring in the agonies of death For Lovelace let this truth this undoubted truth be ingraven on thy memory in all thy gaieties That the life we are so fond of is hardly life a mere breathingspace only and that at the end of its longest date  THOU MUST DIE AS WELL AS BELTON  Thou knowest by Tourville what we had done as to the poor man's worldly affairs and that we had got his unhappy sister to come and live with him little did we think him  so very near his end and so I will proceed to tell thee that when I arrived at his house on Saturday night I found him excessively ill But just raised and in his elbowchair held up by his nurse and Mowbray the roughest and most untouched creature that ever enter'd a sick man's chamber while the maidservants were trying to make that bed easier for him which he was to return to his mind ten times uneasier than That could be and the true cause that the down was no softer to him  He had so much longed to see me his sister told me whom I sent for down to enquire how he was that they all rejoiced when I entered Here said Mowbray Here Tommy is honest Jack Belford  Where where said the poor man  I hear his voice cry'd Mowbray coming up stairs  In a transport of joy he would have raised himself at my entrance but had like to have pitched out of the chair And when recover'd call'd me his best friend his  kindest  friend but burst out into a flood of tears O Jack O Belford said he see the way I am in See how weak So  much  and so soon reduced Do you know me Do you know your poor friend Belton  You are not so much altered my dear Belton as you think you are But I see you are weak very weakAnd I am sorry for it  Weak weak indeed my dearest Belford said he and weaker in my mind if possible than in my body and wept bitterlyor I should not thus unman myself I who never feared  any thing  to be forced to shew myself such a  nursling  I am quite ashamed of myselfBut don't despise me dear Belford don't despise me I beseech thee  I ever honoured a man that could weep for the distresses of  others  and ever shall said I and such a one cannot be insensible to  his own    However I could not help being  visibly  moved at the poor fellow's emotion  Now said the brutal Mowbray do I think thee insufferable Jack Our poor friend is already a peg too low and here thou art letting him down lower and lower still This soothing of him in his dejected moments and joining  thy womanish tears with his is not the way I am sure it is not If our Lovelace were here he'd tell thee so  Thou art an impenetrable creature reply'd I unfit to be present at a scene thou wilt not be able to feel the terrors of till thou feelest them in thyself and then if thou hast  time for feeling  my life for thine thou behavest as pitifully as those thou thinkest  most  pitiful  Then turning to the poor sick man Tears my dear Belton are no signs of an  unmanly  but contrarily of a humane nature they ease the overcharged heart which would burst but for that kindly and natural relief  Give Sorrow  words  says  Shakespeare    The grief that does not speak  Whispers the o'erfrought heart and bids it break  I know my dear Belton thou usedst to take pleasure in repetitions from the poets but thou must be tasteless of their beauties now Yet be not discountenanced by this uncouth and unreflecting Mowbray for as Juvenal says  Tears are the prerogative of manhood    'Tis at least seasonably said my dear Belford it is kind to keep me in countenance for this  womanish weakness  as Mowbray has been upbraidingly calling it ever since he has been with me And in so doing whatever I might have thought in such high health as he enjoys has convinced me that bottlefriends feel nothing but what moves in that little circle  Well well proceed in your own way Jack I love my friend Belton as well as you can do yet for the blood of me I cannot but think that soothing a man's weakness is increasing it  If it be a weakness to be touched at great and concerning events in which our humanity is concerned said I thou mayest be right  I have seen many a man said the rough creature going up Holbournhill that has behaved more like a man than either of you  Ay but Mowbray reply'd the poor man those wretches have not had such infirmities of body as I have long laboured under to enervate their minds Thou art a shocking  fellow and ever wert But to be able to remember nothing in these moments but what reproaches me and to know that I cannot hold it long and what may  then  be my lot ifBut interrupting himself and turning to me Give me thy pity Jack 'tis balm to my wounded soul and let Mowbray sit indifferent enough to the pangs of a dying friend to laugh at us both  The harden'd fellow then retired with the air of a Lovelace only more stupid yawning and stretching instead of humming a tune as thou didst at Smith's  I assisted to get the poor man into bed He was so weak and low that he could not bear the fatigue and fainted away and I verily thought was quite gone But recovering and his doctor coming and advising to keep him quiet I retired and joined Mowbray in the garden who took more delight to talk of the living Lovelace and his levities than of the dying Belton and his repentance  I just saw him again on Saturday night before I went to bed which I did early for I was surfeited with Mowbray's frothy insensibility and could not bear him It is such a horrid thing to think of that a man who had lived in such strict terms of  amity  with another the proof does not come out so as to say  friendship  who had pretended so much love for him could not bear to be out of his company would ride a hundred miles an end to enjoy it and would fight for him be the cause right or wrong Yet now could be so little moved to see him in such misery of body and mind as to be able to rebuke him and rather ridicule than pity him because he was more affected by what he felt than he had seen a malefactor hardened perhaps by liquor and not softened by previous sickness on his going to execution  This put me strongly in mind of what the divine Miss HARLOWE once said to me talking of friendship and what my friendship to  you  required of me  'Depend upon it Mr Belford' said she that one day you will be convinced that what  you  call friendship is chaff and stubble and that nothing is worthy of that sacred name  'THAT HAS NOT VIRTUE FOR ITS BASE'  Sunday morning I was called up at six o' clock at his earnest request and found him in a terrible agony O Jack Jack said he looking wildly as if he had seen a spectreCome nearer me reaching out both armsCome nearer meDear dear Belford save me Then clasping my arm with both his hands and rearing up his head towards me his eyes strangely rolling Save me dear Belford save me repeated he  I put my other arm about himSave you from what my dear Belton Save you from whatNothing shall hurt youWhat must I save you from  Recovering from his terror he sunk down again O save me from myself said he Save me from my own reflections O dear Jack what a thing it is to die and not to have one comfortable reflection to revolveWhat would I give for one year of my passed lifeonly  one  yearand to have the same sense of things that I now have  I try'd to comfort him as well as I could But freelivers to freelivers are sorry deathbed comforters And he broke in upon me O my dear Belford said he I am told and I have heard you ridiculed for it that the excellent Miss Harlowe has wrought a conversion in you May it be so you are a man of sense O may it be so Now is your time Now that you are in full vigour of mind and body But your poor Belton alas kept his vices till they left him And see the miserable effects in debility of mind and despondency Were Mowbray here and were he to  laugh  at me I would own that this is the cause of my despair That God's  justice  cannot let his  mercy  operate for my comfort For Oh I have been very  very  wicked and have despised the offers of his grace till he has withdrawn it from me for ever  I used all the arguments I could think of to give him consolation and what I said had such an effect upon him as to quiet his mind for the greatest part of the day and in a lucid hour his memory served him to repeat those lines of Dryden grasping my hand and looking wistfully upon me  O that I less could fear to lose this being  Which like a snowball in my cowardband  The more 'tis grasp'd the faster melts away  In the afternoon of Sunday he was inquisitive after you and your present behaviour to Miss Harlowe I told him how you had been and how light you made of it Mowbray was pleased with your impenetrable hardness of heart and said Bob Lovelace was a good edgetool and steel to the back And such coarse but hearty praises he gave thee as an abandon'd man might  give  and only an abandon'd man could wish to  deserve    But hadst thou heard what the poor dying wisetoolate Belton said on this occasion perhaps it would have made thee serious an  hour or two  at least  When poor Lovelace is brought said he to a sickbed as I am now and his mind forebodes that it is impossible he should recover which  his  could not do in his late illness If it had he could not have behaved so lightly in itWhen he revolves his past misspent life his actions of offence to helpless innocents in Miss Harlowe's case particularly What then will he think of himself or of his past actions His mind debilitated his strength turned into weakness unable to stir or to move without help not one ray of hope darting in upon his benighted soul his conscience standing in the place of a thousand witnesses his pains excruciating weary of the poor remnant of life he drags yet dreading that in a few short hours his bed will be changed to worse nay to worst of all and that worst of all to last beyond time and to all eternity O Jack What will he then think of the poor transitory gratifications of sense which now engage all his attention Tell him dear Belford tell him how happy he is if he knows his own happiness how happy compared to his poor dying friend that he has recovered from his illness and has still an opportunity lent him for which I would give a thousand worlds had I them to give  I approved exceedingly of what he said as reflections suited to his present circumstances and inferred consolations to him from a mind so properly touched  He proceeded in the like penitent strain I have lived a very wicked life so have we all We have never made a conscience of doing all the mischief that either force or fraud put it in our power  o do We have laid snares for the innocent heart and have not scrupled by the tooready sword to extend as occasions offer'd the wrongs we did to the persons whom we had before injur'd in their dearest relations But yet I think in my heart that I have less to answer for than either Lovelace or Mowbray for I by taking to myself that accursed deceiver from whom thou hast freed me and who for years unknown to me was retaliating upon my own head some of the evils I had brought upon others and retiring and living with her as a wife was not party to half the mischiefs that I doubt they and Tourville and even You Belford committed As to the ungrateful Thomasm I hope I have met with my punishment in her But notwithstanding this dost thou not think that  such  an actionand  such  an actionand  such  an action and then he recapitulated several enormities in which led on by false bravery and the heat of youth and wine we have all been concerned Dost thou not think that these villainies let me call them  now  by their proper name joined to the wilful and gloriedin neglect of every duty that our better sense and education gave us to know were required of us as Men and Christians are not enough to weigh down my soul into despondencyIndeed indeed they are And now to hope for  mercy  And to depend upon the efficacy of that gracious attribute when that no less shining one of  justice  forbids me to hope How can II who have despised all warnings and taken no advantage of the benefit I might have reap'd from the lingring consumptive illness I have laboured under but left all to the last stake hoping for recovery against hope and driving off repentance till that grace is denyed me for oh my dear Belford I can now neither repent nor pray as I ought my heart is harden'd and I can do nothing but despair  More he would have said but overwhelm'd with grief and infirmity he bowed his head upon his pangful  bosom endeavouring to hide from the sight of the hardened Mowbray who just then enter'd the room those tears which he could not restrain  Prefac'd by a phlegmatic hem Sad very sad truly cry'd Mowbray who sat himself down on one side of the bed as I on the other His eyes half closed and his lips pouting out to his turn'dup nose his chin curdled to use one of thy descriptions leaving one at a loss to know whether stupid drowsiness or intense contemplation had got most hold of him  An excellent however uneasy lesson Mowbray said I by my faith it isIt may one day who knows how soon be our own case  I thought of thy yawning fit as described in thy letter of Aug For up started Mowbray writhing and shaking himself as in an aguefit his hands stretch'd over his headwith thy hoy hoy hoy yawningAnd then recovering himself with another stretch and a shake What's a clock cried he pulling out his watchAnd stalking by long tiptoe strides thro' the room down stairs he went and meeting the maid in the passage I heard him sayBetty bring me a bumper of claret thy poor master and this damn'd Belford are enough to throw a Hercules into the vapours  Mowbray after this amusing himself in our friend's library which is as thou knowest chiefly classical and dramatical found out a passage in Lee's Oedipus which he  ould needs have to be extremely apt and in he came full fraught with the notion of the courage it would give the dying man and read it to him 'Tis poetical and pretty This is it  When the  sun sets  shadows that shew'd at  noon  But small appear most long and terrible  So when we think fate hovers o'er our heads  Our apprehensions shoot beyond all bounds  Owls ravens crickets seem the watch of death  Nature's worst verman scare her godlike sons  Echoes the very leavings of a voice  Grow babling ghosts and call us to our graves  Each molehill thought swells to a huge Olympus  While we fantastic dreamers heave and puff  And sweat with our imagination's weight  He expected praises for finding this out But Belton turning his head from him Ah Dick said he these are not the reflections of a dying man What thou wilt one day feel if it be what I now feel will convince thee that the evils  before  thee and  with  thee are more than the effects of imagination  I was called twice on Sundaynight to him for the poor fellow when his reflections on his past life annoy him most is afraid of being left with the women and his eyes they tell me hunt and roll about for me Where's Mr BelfordBut I shall tire him out cries heyet beg of him to step to meyet don'tyet do were once the doubting and changeful orders he gave And they called me accordingly  But alas What could Belford do for him Belford who had been but too often the companion of his guilty hours who wants mercy as much as he does and is unable to promise it to himself tho' 'tis all he can bid his poor friend  rely  upon  What miscreants are we What figures shall we make in these terrible hours  If Miss HARLOWE's glorious  Example  on one hand and the  terrors of This  poor man's on the other affect me not I must be abandoned to perdition as I fear thou wilt be if thou benefittest not thyself from both  Among the consolatory things I urged when I was called up the last time on Sundaynight I told him That he must not absolutely give himself up to despair That many of the apprehensions he was under were such as the best men must have on the dreadful uncertainty of what was to succeed to this life 'Tis well observed said I by a poetical divine who was an excellent christian  The Rev Mr  Norris  of  Bemerton    That  Death could not a more sad retinue find  Sickness and pain before and darkness all behind  About eight o'clock yesterday Monday morning I found him a little calmer He asked me who was the author of the two lines I had repeated to him and made me speak them over again A  sad retinue  indeed said the poor man And then expressing his hopelessness of life and his terrors at the thoughts of dying and drawing from thence terrible conclusions with regard to his future state There is said I such a  natural  aversion to death in human nature that you are not to imagine that you my dear Belton are singular in the fear of it and in the apprehensions that fill the thoughtful mind upon its approach but you ought as much as possible to separate those  natural  fears which all men must have on so solemn an occasion from those  particular  ones which your justlyapprehended unfitness fills you with Lord Roscommon in his  Prospect of Death  which I dipped into last night from a collection in your closet and which I put into my pocket says and turning to the place  Merely to die no man of reason fears  For certainly we must  As we are born return to dust  'Tis the last point of many ling'ring years  But whither then we go  Whither we fain would know  But human understanding cannot shew  This makes us tremble  My Lord Roscommon therefore proceeded I had such apprehensions of this dark state as you have And the excellent divine I hinted at last night who had very little else but human frailties to reproach himself with and whose Miscellanies fell into my hands among my uncle's books in my attendance upon him in his last hours says  It must be done my soul But 'tis a strange  A dismal and mysterious change  When thou shalt leave this tenement of clay  And to an unknownsomewherewing away  When Time shall be Eternity and thou  Shalt bethou knowest not whatand livethou know'st not how  Amazing state no wonder that we dread  To think of death or view the dead  Thou're all wrapt up in clouds as if to thee  Our very knowlege had antipathy  Then follows what I repeated  Death could not a more sad retinue find  Sickness and pain before and darkness all behind  Alas my dear Belford inferr'd the unhappy deepthinker what poor creatures does this convince me we mortals are at bestBut what then must be the case of such a profligate as I who by a past wicked life have added force to these natural terrors If death be so repugnant a thing to human nature that  good  men will be startled at it what must it be to one who has lived a life of sense and appetite nor ever reflected upon the end which I now am within view of  What could I say to an inference so fairly drawn Mercy mercy  unbounded mercy  was still my plea tho' his repeated opposition of  justice  to it in a manner silenced it And what would I have given to have had rise to my mind one good one eminently good action to have remembered him of in order to combat his fears with it  I believe Lovelace I shall tire thee and that more with the subject of my letter than even with the length of it But really I think thy spirits are so offensively up since thy recovery that I ought as the melancholy subjects offer to endeavour by them to reduce thee to the standard of humanity And then thou canst not but be curious to know every thing that concerns the poor man for whom thou hast always expressed a great regard I will therefore proceed as I have begun If thou likest not to read it now lay it by if thou wilt till the like circumstances befal thee till like reflections from those circumstances seize thee and then take it up and compare the two cases together  AT his earnest request I sat up with him last night and poor man it is impossible to tell thee how easy and safe he thought himself in my company for the first part of the night  A drowning man will catch at a straw    the Proverb well says And a straw was I with respect to any real help I could give him He often awaked in terrors and once calling out for me Dear Belford said he Where are youOh There you areGive me your friendly handThen grasping it and putting his clammy halfcold lips to itHow kind I fear every thing when you are absent But the presence of a friend a sympathizing friendOh how comfortable  But about four in the morning he frighted me much He waked with three terrible groans and endeavoured to speak but could not presentlyand when he didJack Jack Jack five or six times repeated he as quick as thought now now now save me save me save meI am goinggoing indeed  I threw my arms about him and raised him upon his pillow as he was sinking as if to hide himself in the bedcloathsAnd staring wildly Where am I said he a little recovering Did you not see him turning his head this way and that horror in his countenance Did you not see him  See who See what my dear Belton  O lay me upon the bed again cry'd heLet me not die upon the floor Lay me down gently And stand by me Leave me not All all will soon be over  You are already my dear Belton upon the bed You have not been upon the floorThis is a strong delirium you are faint for want of refreshment for he had refused several times to take any thing Let me persuade you to take some of this cordial julep I will leave you if you will not oblige me  He then readily took it but said he could have sworn that Tom Metcalfe had been in the room and had drawn him out of bed by the throat upbraiding him with the injuries he had first done his sister and then him in the duel to which he owed that fever which cost him his life  Thou knowest the story Lovelace too well to need my repeating it But mercy on us if in these terrible moments all the evils we do rise to our affrighted imaginations If so what shocking scenes have I but still more hast thou to go through if as the noble poet says  If any sense at that sad time remains  The doctor ordered him an opiate this morning early which operated so well that he dosed and slept several hours more quietly than he had done for the two past days and nights tho' he had sleeping draughts given him before But it is more and more evident every hour that nature is almost worn out in him  MOWBRAY quite tired with this house of mourning intends to set out in the morning to find you He was not a little rejoiced to hear you were in town I believe to have a pretence to leave us  He has just taken leave of his poor friend intending to go away early An everlasting leave I may venture to say for I think he will hardly live till tomorrow night  I believe the poor man would not have been sorry had he left him when I arrived for 'tis a shocking creature and enjoys too strong health to know how to pity the sick Then to borrow an observation from thee he has by nature strong bodily organs which those of his soul are not likely to whet out and he as well as the wicked friend he is going to may last a great while from the strength of their constitutions tho' so greatly different in their talents if neither the sword nor the halter interpose  I must repeat That I cannot but be very uneasy for the poor lady whom thou so cruelly persecutest and that I do not think thou hast kept thy honour with me I was apprehensive indeed that thou wouldst attempt to see her as soon as thou gottest well enough to come up and I told her as much making use of it as an argument to prepare her for thy visit and to induce her to stand it But she could not it is plain bear the shock of it and indeed she told me that she would not see thee tho' but for one half hour for the world  Could she have prevailed upon herself I know that the sight of her would have been as affecting to thee as thy visit could have been to her when thou hadst seen to what a lovely skeleton for she is really lovely still nor can she with such a form and features be otherwise thou hast in a few weeks reduced one of the most  charming women in the world and that in the full bloom of her youth and beauty  Mowbray undertakes to carry This that he may be more welcome to you he says Were it to be sent unsealed the characters we write in would be Hebrew to the dunce I desire you to return it and I'll give you a copy of it upon demand for I intend to keep it by me as a guard against the infection of thy company which might otherwise perhaps some time hence be apt to weaken the impressions I always desire to have of the awful scene before me God convert us both  LETTER II Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Wednesdaymorn    o' Clock    I BELIEVE no man has two such servants as I have Because I treat them with kindness and do not lord it over my inferiors and damn and curse them by looks and words like Mowbray or beat their teeth out like Lovelace but cry Pr'ythee Harry do this and Pr'ythee Jonathan do that the fellows pursue their own devices and regard nothing I say but what falls in with these Here this vile Harry who might have brought your letter of yesterday in good time came not in with it till past eleven last night drunk I suppose and concluding that I was in bed as he pretends because he was told I sat up the preceding night brought it not to me and having over slept himself just as I had sealed up my letter in comes the villain with the forgotten one shaking his ears and looking as if he himself did not believe the excuses he was going to make I questioned him about it and heard his pitiful pleas and tho' I never think it becomes a gentleman to treat people insolently who by their stations are humbled beneath his feet yet could I not forbear to  Lovelace  and  Mowbray  him most cordially  And this detaining Mowbray who was ready to set out to thee before while I write a few lines upon it the fierce fellow who is impatient to exchange the company of a dying Belton for that of a too lively Lovelace affixed a  supplement  of curses upon the staring fellow that  was larger than my  book  Nor did I offer to take off the Bear from such a Mongrel since he deserved not of me on this occasion the protection which every master owes to a good servant  He has not done cursing him yet for stalking about the courtyard with his boots on the poor fellow dressing his horse and unable to get from him he is at him without mercy and I will heighten his impatience since being just under the window where I am writing he will not let me attend to my pen by telling thee how he fills my ears as well as the fellow's with hisHay Sir And Gd dn ye Sir And were you my servant ye dog ye And must I stay here till the midday sun scorches me to a parchment for such a mangey dog's drunken neglectYe lye Sirrah Ye lye I tell youI hear the fellow's voice in an humble excusatory tone tho' not articulately Ye lye ye dogI'd a good mind to thrust my whip down your drunken throat Damn me if I would not flay the skin from the back of such a rascal if thou wert mine and have dog'sskin gloves made of it for thy brother scoundrels to wear in remembrance of thy abuses of such a master  The poor horse suffers for this I doubt not for What now and Stand still and be damn'd to ye cries the fellow with a kick I suppose which he better deserves himself For these varlets where they can are Mowbrays and Lovelaces to man or beast and not daring to answer  him  is flaying the poor  horse    I hear the fellow is just escaped the horse better curryed than ordinary I suppose in half the usual time by his clanking shoes and Mowbray's silence letting me know that I may now write on And so I will tell thee that in the first place little as I as well as you regard dreams I would have thee lay thine to heart for I could give thee such an interpretation of it as would shock thee perhaps and if thou asketh me for it I will  Mowbray calls to me from the courtyard That 'tis a cursed hot day and he shall be fry'd by riding in the noon of it And that poor Belton longs to see me So I will only add my earnest desire that thou wilt give over all  thoughts of seeing the lady if when this comes to thy hand thou hast not seen her And that it would be kind if thoud'st come and for the last time thou wilt ever see thy poor friend share my concern  for  him and  in  him see what in a little time will be thy fate and mine and That of Mowbray Tourville and the rest of usFor what are ten fifteen twenty or thirty years to look back to In which period forward we shall all perhaps be mingled with the dust we sprung from  LETTER III Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  WednesdayMorn Aug    ALL alive dear Jack and in ecstasy Likely to be once more a happy man For I have received a letter from my beloved Miss HARLOWE in consequence I suppose of advices that I mentioned in my last from her sister And I am setting out for Berks directly to shew the contents to my Lord M and to receive the congratulations of all my kindred upon it  I went last night as I intended to Smith's But the dear creature was not returned at near ten o'clock And lighting upon Tourville I took him home with me and made him sing me out of my megrims I went to bed tolerably easy at two had bright and pleasant dreams not such a frightful one as that I gave thee an account of And at eight this morning as I was dressing to be in readiness against Will came back whom I had sent to enquire after his lady's return I had this letter brought me by a chairman  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Tuesday night    o'clock Aug    SIR  I HAVE good news to tell you I am setting out with all diligence for my father's house I am bid to hope that he will receive his poor penitent with a goodness peculiar to himself for I am overjoyed with the assurance of a thorough reconciliation thro' the interposition of a dear blessed friend whom I always loved and honoured  I am so taken up with my preparation for this joyful and longwishedfor journey that I cannot spare one moment for any other business having several matters of the last importance to settle first So pray Sir don't disturb or interrupt meI beseech you don'tYou may in time possibly see me at my father's at least if it be not your own fault  I will write a letter which shall be sent you when I am got thither and received Till when I am  c  CLARISSA HARLOWE  I dispatched instantly a letter to the dear creature assuring her with the most thankful joy  "That I would directly set out for Berks and wait the issue of the happy reconciliation and the charming hopes she had filled me with I poured out upon her a thousand blessings I declared that it should be the study of my whole life to merit such transcendent goodness And that there was nothing which her father or friends should require at my hands that I would not for  her  sake comply with in order to promote and complete so desirable a reconciliation"  I hurried it away without taking a copy of it and I have ordered the chariotandsix to be got ready and hey for M HallLet me but know how Belton does I hope a letter from thee is on the road And if the poor fellow can spare thee make haste I advise thee to attend this truly divine lady or else thou mayest not see her of months perhaps at least not while she is Miss HARLOWE And favour me with one letter before she sets out if possible confirming to me and accounting for this generous change  But what accounting for it is necessary The dear creature cannot receive consolation herself but she must communicate it to others How nobleShe would not see me in her adversity But no sooner does the sun of prosperity begin to shine upon her than she forgives me  I know to whose mediation all this is owing It is to Col Morden's She always as she says lov'd and honour'd him And he loved her above all his relations  I shall now be convinced that there is something in  dreams The ceiling opening is the reconciliation in view The bright form lifting her up through it to another ceiling stuck round with golden Cherubims and Seraphims indicates the charming little boys and girls that will be the fruits of this happy reconciliation The welcomes thrice repeated are those of her family now no more to be deemed implacable Yet are they a family too that my soul cannot mingle with  But then what is my tumbling over and over thro' the floor into a frightful hole  descending  as she  ascends  Ho only This it alludes to my disrelish to matrimony Which is a bottomless pit a gulph and I know not what And I suppose had I not awoke in such a plaguy fright I had been soused into some river at the bottom of the hole and then been carried mundified or purified from my past iniquities by the same bright form waiting for me upon the mossy banks to my beloved girl and we should have gone on cherubiming of it and carolling to the end of the chapter  But what are the black sweeping mantles and robes of my Lord M thrown over my face and what are those of the Ladies Oh Jack I have these too They indicate nothing in the world but that my Lord will be so good as to die and leave me all he has So rest to thy good natured soul honest Lord M  Lady Sarah Sadleir and Lady Betty Lawrance will also die and leave me swindging legacies  Miss Charlotte and her sisterwhat will become of themO they will be in mourning of course for their uncle and auntsThat's right  As to Morden's flashing through the window and crying Die Lovelace and be damn'd if thou wilt not repair my cousin's wrongs That is only that he would have sent me a challenge had I not been disposed to do the lady justice  All I dislike is This part of the dream For even in a dream I would not be thought to be threatened into any measure tho' I liked it ever so well  And so much for my prophetic dream  Dear charming creature What a meeting will there be between her and her father and mother and uncles What  transports what pleasure will this happy longwished for reconciliation give her dutiful heart And indeed now methinks I am glad she  is  so dutiful to them for her duty to parents is a conviction to me that she will be  as  dutiful to her husband Since duty upon principle is an uniform thing  Why pr'ythee now Jack I have not been so much to blame as thou thinkest For had it not been for me who have led her into so much distress she could neither have  received  nor  given  the joy that will now overwhelm them all So here rises great and durable good out of temporary evil  I knew they loved her the pride and glory of their family too well to hold out long  I wish I could have seen Arabella's letter She has always been so much eclipsed by her sister that I dare say she has signified this reconciliation to her with intermingled phlegm and wormwood and her invitation most certainly runs all in the rockwater style  I shall long to see the promised letter too when she is got thither which I hope will give an account of the reception she will meet with  There is a solemnity however I think in the style of her letter which pleases and affects me at the same time But as it is evident she loves me still and hopes soon to see me at her father's she could not help being a little solemn and halfashamed dear blushing pretty rogue to own her love after my usage of her  And then her subscription  Till when I am  CLARISSA HARLOWE As much as to say  after that  I shall be if not  your own fault  CLARISSA LOVELACE  O my best love My ever generous and adorable creature How much does this thy forgiving goodness exalt us bothI for the occasion given thee Thou for turning it so gloriously to thy advantage and to the honour of both  And if my beloved creature you will but connive at the imperfections of your adorer and not play the  wife  upon me If while the charms of Novelty have their force with me I should happen to be drawn aside by the intricacies of intrigue and of plots that my soul loves to  form and pursue and if thou wilt not be openeyed to the follies of my youth a transitory state every excursion shall serve but the more to endear thee to me till in time and in a very little time too I shall get above sense and then charmed by thy soulattracting converse and brought to despise my former courses what I now at distance consider as a painful duty will be my joyful choice and all my delight will centre in thee  MOWBRAY is just arrived with thy letters I therefore close my agreeable subject to attend to one which I doubt will be very shocking I have engaged the rough varlet to bear me company in the morning to Berks where I shall file off the rust he has contracted in his attendance upon the poor fellow  He tells me that between the dying Belton and the preaching Belford he shan't be his own man these three days And says that thou addest to the unhappy fellow's weakness instead of giving him courage to help him to bear his destiny  I am sorry he takes the unavoidable lot so heavily But he has been long ill and sickness enervates the mind as well as the body as he himself very significantly observed to thee  LETTER IV Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Wedn Evening  I HAVE been reading thy shocking letterPoor Belton what a multitude of lively hours have we passed together 'Twas a fearless chearful fellowWho'd ha' thought all should end in such dejected whimpering and terror  But why didst thou not comfort the poor man about the rencounter between him and that poltroon Metcalfe He acted in that affair like a man of true honour and as I should have acted in the same circumstances Tell him I say so and what happened he could neither help nor foresee  Some people are as sensible of a scratch from a pin's point as others from a push of a sword And who can say any thing for the sensibility of such fellows Metcalfe would resent for his sister when his sister resented not for herself Had she demanded her brother's protection and resentment that would have been  another man's matter  as Lord M phrases it But she herself thought her brother a coxcomb to busy himself undesired in her affairs and wished for nothing but to be provided for decently and privately in her lyingin and was willing to take the chance of  Maintenoning  his conscience in her favour  Madam Maintenon was reported to have prevailed upon Lewis XIV of France in his old age sunk as he was by ill success in the field to marry her by way of compounding with his conscience for the freedoms of his past life to which she attributed his public losses  and getting him to marry when the little stranger came for she knew what an easy goodnatured fellow he was And indeed if she  had  prevailed upon him it might have been happy for both as then he would not have fallen in with his cursed Thomasin But truly this officious brother of hers must interpose This made a trifling affair important And what was the issue Metcalfe challenged Belton met him disarmed him gave him his life But the fellow more sensible in his  skin  than in his  head  having received a scratch he was frighted it gave him first a puke then a fever and then he died That was all And how could Belton help thatBut sickness a long tedious sickness will make a bugbear of any thing to a languishing heart I see that And so far was Mowbray  apropos  in the verses from  Nat Lee  which thou hast transcribed  Merely to die no man of reason fears  is a mistake say thou or say thy author what ye will And thy solemn parading about the natural repugnance between life and death is a proof that it is  Let me tell thee Jack that so much am I pleased with this world in the main tho' in some points too the world to make a  person  of it has been a rascal to me so delighted am I with the joys of youth with my worldly prospects as to fortune and now newly with the  charming hopes given me by dear thrice dear and forever dear Miss HARLOWE that were I even sure that nothing bad would come hereafter I should be very loth very much  afraid  if thou wilt have it so to lay down my life and them together and yet upon a call of honour no man fears death less than myself  But I have not either inclination or leisure to weigh thy  leaden  arguments except in the  pig  or as thou wouldst say in the  lump    If I return thy letters let me have them again some time hence that is to say when I am married or when poor Belton is halfforgotten or when  time  has inrolled the honest fellow among those whom we have  so long  lost that we may remember them with more pleasure than pain and then I may give them a serious perusal and enter with thee as deeply as thou wilt into the subject  When I am married  said IWhat a sound has that  I must wait with patience for a sight of this charming creature till she is at her father's And yet as the but blossoming beauty as thou tellest me is reduced to a shadow I should have been exceedingly delighted to see her now and every day till the happy one that I might have the pleasure of beholding how sweetly hour by hour she will rise to her pristine glories by means of that state of ease and contentment which will take place of the stormy  past  upon her reconciliation with her friends and our happy nuptials  LETTER V Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  WELL but now my heart is a little at ease I will condescend to take some brief notice of some other passages in thy letters  I find I am to thank  thee  that the dear creature has avoided my visit Things are now in so good a train that I must forgive thee else shouldest thou have heard more of this new instance of disloyalty to thy general  Thou art continually giving thyself high praise by way of  opposition  as I may say to others gently and artfully blaming thyself for qualities thou wouldest at  the same time have to be thought and which generally are thought praiseworthy  Thus in the airs thou assumest about thy servants thou wouldst pass for a mighty humane mortal and that at the expence of Mowbray and me whom thou representest as kings and emperors to our menials Yet art thou always unhappy in thy attempts of this kind and never canst make us who know thee believe That to be a virtue in thee which is but the effect of constitutional phlegm and absurdity  Knowest thou not that some men have a native dignity in their manner that makes them more regarded by a look than either thou canst be in thy low style or Mowbray in his high  I am fit to be a prince I can tell thee for I reward well and I punish seasonably and properly and I am generally as well served as any man  The art of governing these underbred varlets lies more in the dignity of looks than in words and thou art a sorry fellow to think humanity consists in acting by thy servants as men must act who are not able to pay them their wages or had made them masters of secrets which if divulged would lay them at the mercy of such wretches  Now to me who never did any thing I was ashamed to own and who have more ingenuity than ever man had who can call a villainy by its right name tho' practised by myself and by my own readiness to reproach myself anticipate all reproach from others who am not such a hypocrite as to wish the world to think me other or better than I am It is my part to  look  a servant into his duty if I can Nor will I keep one who knows not how to take me by a nod or a wink and who when I smile shall not be all transport when I frown all terror If indeed I am out of the way a little I always take care to reward the varlets for bearing patiently my displeasure But this I hardly ever am but when a fellow is egregiously stupid in any plain points of duty or will be wiser than his master and when he shall tell me that he thought acting contrary to my orders was the way to serve me best  One time or other I will enter the lists with thee upon thy conduct and mine to servants and I will convince thee that what thou wouldst have pass for humanity if it be indiscriminately practised to all tempers will perpetually subject thee to the evils thou complainest of and  justly  too and that  he  only is fit to be a master of servants who can command their attention as much by a  nod  as if he were to  pr'ythee  a fellow to do his duty on one hand or to talk of  flaying  and  horsewhipping  like Mowbray on the other For the servant who being  used  to  expect  thy creeping style will always be master of his master and he who deserves to be treated as the other is not fit to be any man's servant nor would I keep such a fellow to rub my horse's heels  I shall be the readier to enter the lists with thee upon this argument because I have presumption enough to think that we have not in any of our dramatic poets that I can at present call to mind one character of a servant of either sex that is justly hit off So absurdly wise  some  and so sottishly foolish  others  and  both  sometimes in the  same  person  Foils  drawn from the lees or dregs of the people to set off the characters of their masters and mistresses nay sometimes which is still more absurd introduced with more wit than the poet has to bestow upon their principalsMere  stints  and  steels  to strike fire withOr to vary the metaphor to serve for whetstones to wit which  otherwise  could not be made apparentOr for engines to be made use of like the  machinery  of the ancien  poets or the still  more  unnatural Soliloquy to help on a sorry plot or to bring about a necessary eclaircissement to save the poet the trouble of thinking deeply for a better way to wind up his bottoms  Of this I am persuaded whatever my  practice  be to my own servants that thou wilt be benefited by my  theory  when we come to controvert the point For then I shall convince thee that the  dramatic  as well as  natural  characteristics of a good servant ought to be fidelity common sense chearful obedience and silent respect That wit in his station except to his companions would be sawciness That he should never presume to give his advice That if he ventured to expostulate upon any unreasonable  command or such a one as appeared to him to be so he should do it with humility and respect and take a proper season for it But such lessons do most of the dramatic performances I have seen give where servants are introduced as characters essential to the play or to act very significant or long parts in it which of itself I think a fault such lessons I say do they give to the footmens gallery that I have not wondered we have so few modest or good menservants among those who often attend their masters or mistresses to plays Then how miserably evident must that poet's conscious want of genius be who can stoop to raise or give force to a clap by the indiscriminative roar of the partycoloured gallery  But this subject I will suspend to a better opportunity that is to say to the happy one when my nuptials with my Clarissa will oblige me to increase the number of my servants and of consequence to enter more nicely into their qualifications  ALTHOUGH I have the highest opinion that man can have of the generosity of my dear Miss Harlowe yet I cannot for the heart of me account for this agreeable change in her temper but one way Faith and troth Belford I verily believe laying all circumstances together that the dear creature unexpectedly finds herself in the way I have so ardently wished her to be in and that this makes her at last incline to favour me that she may set the better face upon her gestation when at her father's  If this be the case all her sailing away and her fainting f  ts are charmingly accounted for Nor is it surprising that such a sweet novice in these matters should not know to what to attribute her frequent indispositions If this should be the case how shall I laugh at  thee  and when I am sure of her at the dear novice  herself  that all her grievous distresses shall end in a manchild which I shall love better than all the Cherubims and Seraphims that may come after though there were to be as many of them as I beheld in my dream in which a vast expanse of ceiling was stuck as full of them as it could hold  I shall be afraid to open thy next lest it bring me the account of poor Belton's death Yet as there are no  hopes of his recoveryBut what should I say unless the poor man were better fittedBut thy heavy sermon shall not affect me too much neither  I inclose thy papers And do thou transcribe them for me or return them for there are some things in them which at a proper season a  mortal  man should not avoid attending to And thou seemest to have entered deeply into the shocking subjectBut here I will end lest I grow too serious  THY servant called here about an hour ago to know if I had any commands I therefore hope that thou wilt have this early in the morning And if thou  canst  let me hear from thee do I'll stretch an hour or two in expectation of it Yet I must be at Lord M's tomorrow night if possible though ever so late  Thy fellow tells me the poor man is much as he was when Mowbray left him  Wouldst thou think that this varlet Mowbray is sorry that I am so near being happy with Miss Harlowe And 'egad Jack I know not what to say to it now the fruit seems to be within my reach But let what will come I'll stand to't For I find I can't live without her  LETTER VI Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Wedn Three o'clock  I WILL proceed where I left off in my last  As soon as I had seen Mowbray mounted I went to attend upon poor Belton whom I found in dreadful agonies in which he awoke as he generally does  The doctor came in presently after and I was concerned at the scene that passed between them  It opened with the dying man's asking him with melancholy earnestness If nothing if nothing at all could be done for him  The doctor shook his head and told him he doubted not  I  cannot  die said the poor man I cannot  think  of dying I am very desirous of living a little longer if I could but  be free from these horrible pains in my stomach and head Can you give me nothing to make me pass one week but  one  week in tolerable ease that I may die like a manIf I  must  die  But doctor I am  yet  a young man in the prime of my yearsYouth is a good subject for a physician to work upon Can you do nothing nothing  at all  for me doctor  Alas Sir replied his physician you have been long in a bad way I fear I fear nothing in physic can help you  He was then out of all patience What then is your art SirI have been a passive machine for a whole twelvemonth to be wrought upon at the pleasure of you people of the faculty I verily believe had I not taken such doses of nasty stuff I had been now a well manBut who the plague would regard Physicians whose art is to cheat us with hopes while they help to destroy us And who not one of you know any thing but by guess  Sir continued he fiercely and with more strength of voice and coherence than he had shewn for several hours before if you give  me  over I give  you  overThe only honest and certain part of the art of healing is Surgery A good Surgeon is worth a thousand of you I have been in Surgeon's hands often and have always found reason to depend upon their skill But  your  art Sir what is itbut to dawb dawb dawb load load load plaister plaister plaister till ye utterly destroy the appetite first and the constitution afterwards which you are calledin to help I had a companion onceMy dear Belford thou knewest honest Blomeras pretty a physician he would have made as any in England had he kept himself from excess in wine and women and he always used to say there was nothing at all but pickpocket parade in the Physicians art and that the best guesser was the best physician and I used to believe him too And yet fond of life and fearful of death what do we do when we are taken ill but call ye  in  And what do  ye  do when called in but nurse our distempers till from pigmies you make giants of themAnd then ye come creeping with solemn faces when ye are ashamed to prescribe or when the stomach won't bear its natural food by reason of your  poisonous potions  Alas I am afraid physic can do no more for him  Nor need it when it has brought to the brink of the grave the poor wretch who placed all his reliance in your cursed slops and the flattering hopes you gave him  The doctor was out of countenance but said If we could make mortal men  immortal  and  would not  all this might be just  I blamed the poor man yet excused him to the physician To die dear doctor when like my poor friend we are so desirous of life is a melancholy thing We are apt to hope too much not considering that the seeds of death are sown in us when we begin to live and grow up till like rampant weeds they choak the tender flower of life which declines in us as those weeds flourish We ought therefore to begin early to study what our constitutions will bear in order to root out by temperance the weeds which the soil is most apt to produce or at least to keep them down as they rise and not when the flower or plant is withered at the root and the weed in its full vigour expect that the medical art will restore the one or destroy the other when that other as I hinted has been rooting itself in the habit from the time of our birth  This speech Bob thou wilt call a  prettiness  or a WHITE BEARbut the allegory is just and thou hast not quite cured me of the Metaphorical  Very true said the doctor you have brought a good metaphor to illustrate the thing I am sorry I can do nothing for the gentleman and can only recommend patience and a better frame of mind  Well Sir said the poor angry man vexed at the doctor but more at death you will perhaps recommend the next in succession to the physician when  he  can do no more and I suppose will send your brother to pray by me for those virtues which you wish me  It seems the physician's brother is a clergyman in the neighbourhood  I was greatly concerned to see the gentleman thus treated and so I told poor Belton when he was gone But he continued impatient and would not be denied he said the liberty of talking to a man who had taken so many guineas of him for doing nothing or worse than  nothing and never declined one though he knew all the time he could do him no good  It seems the gentleman though rich is noted for being greedy after sees and poor Belton went on raving at the extravagant fees of English physicians compared with those of the most eminent foreign ones But poor man he like the Turks who judge of a general by his success out of patience to think he must die would have worshipped the doctor and not grudged three times the s  m could he have given him hopes of recovery  But nevertheless I must needs say that gentlemen of the faculty should be more moderate in their fees or take more pains to deserve them for generally they only come into a room feel the sick man's pulse ask the nurse a few questions inspect the patient's tongue and perhaps his water then sit down look plaguy wise and  write  The golden fee finds the ready hand and they hurry away as if the sick man's room were infectious So to the next they troll and to the next if men of great practice valuing themselves upon the number of visits they make in a morning and the little time they make them in They go to dinner and unload their pockets and sally out again to refill them And thus in a little time they raise vast estates for as Ratcliffe said when first told of a great loss which befel him It was only going up and down a hundred pair of stairs to fetch it up  Mrs Sambre Belton's sister had several times proposed to him a minister to pray by him but the poor man could not he said bear the thoughts of one for that he should certainly die in an hour or two after And he was willing to hope still against all probability that he might recover and was often asking his sister if she had not seen people as bad as he was who almost to a miracle when every body gave them over had got up again  She shaking her head told him she had But once saying that  their  disorders were of an acute kind and such as had a crisis in them he called her  smallhopes  and  Job  's  comforter  and bid her say  nothing  if she could not say more to the purpose and what was fitter for a sick man to hear And yet poor fellow he has no hopes himself as is plain by his desponding terrors one of which he fell  into and a very dreadful one soon after the doctor went  Wednesday    o'clock at night    THE poor man has been in convulsions terrible convulsions for an hour past O Lord Lovelace death is a shocking thing By my faith it isI wish thou wert present on this occasion It is not merely the concern a man has for his friend but as death is the common lot we see in  his  agonies how it will be one day with ourselves I am all over as if cold water were poured down my back or as if I had a strong ague fit upon me I was obliged to come away And I write hardly knowing whatI wish  thou  wert here  THOUGH I left him because I could stay no longer I can't be easy by myself but must go to him again  Eleven o'clock  POOR BeltonDrawing on apace Yet was he sensible when I went in Too sensible poor man He has something upon his mind to reveal he tells me that is the worst action of his life worse than ever you or I knew of him he says It  must  be then very bad  He ordered every body out but was seized with another convulsionfit before he could reveal it And in it he lies struggling between life and death But I'll go in again  One o'clock in the morning  ALL now must soon be over with him Poor poor fellow He has given me some hints of what he wanted to say but all incoherent interrupted by dying hiccoughs and convulsions  Bad enough it must be heaven knows by what I can gather Alas Lovelace I fear I fear he came  too soon  into his uncle's estate  If a man were to live always he might have some temptation to do base things in order to procure to himself as it would then be  everlasting  ease plenty or affluence But for the sake of ten twenty thirty years of poor life to be a villaincan that be worth while with a conscience s  inging him all the time too And when he comes to wind up all such agonizing reflections upon his past guilt All then appearing as nothing What he most valued most disgustful and not one thing to  think of as the poor fellow says twenty and twenty times over but what is attended with anguish and reproach  To hear the poor man wish he had never been born To hear him pray to be nothing after death Good God how shocking  By his incoherent hints I am afraid 'tis very bad with him No pardon no mercy he repeats can lie for him  I hope I shall make a proper use of this lesson Laugh at me if thou wilt but never never more will I take the liberties I have taken but whenever I am tempted will think of Belton's dying agonies and what my own may be  Thursday three in the morning  HE is now at the last gaspRattles in the throat Has a new convulsion every minute almost What horror is he in His eyes look like breathstained glass They roll ghastly no more are quite set His face distorted and drawn out by his sinking jaws and erected staring eyebrows with his lengthened furrowed forehead to double its usual length as it seems It is not it cannot be the face of Belton thy Belton and my Belton whom we have beheld with so much delight over the social bottle comparing notes that one day may be brought against us and make  us  groan as they very lately did  him  that is to say while he had strength to groan for now his voice is not to be heard all inward lost not so much as speaking by his eyes Yet strange how can it be the bed rocking under him like a cradle  Four o'clock  Alas he's gone That groan that  dreadful  groan  Was the last farewel of the parting mind  The struggling soul has bid a long adieu  To its late mansionFledAh whither fled  Now is all indeed overPoor poor Belton By this time thou knowest if thy crimes were above the size of God's mercies Now are every one's cares and attendance at an end Now do we thy friends poor Belton know the worst of thee as to this life Thou art released from insufferable tortures both of body and mind May those tortures and thy repentance expiate for thy offences and mayst thou be happy to all eternity  We are told that God desires not the death the  spiritual  death of a sinner And 'tis certain that thou didst deeply repent I hope therefore as thou wert not cut off in the midst of thy sins by the sword of injured friendship which more than once thou hadst braved the dreadfullest of all deaths next to Suicide because it gives no opportunity for repentance that this is a merciful earnest that thy penitence is accepted and that thy long illness and dreadful agonies in the last stages of it will be thy only punishment  I wish indeed I  heartily  wish we could have seen one ray of comfort darting in upon his benighted mind before he departed But all alas to the very last gasp was horror and confusion And my only fear arises from this That till within the four last days of his life he could not be brought to think he should die though in a visible decline for months and in that presumption was too little inclined to set about a serious preparation for a journey which he hoped he should not be obliged to take and when he began to apprehend that he could not put it off his impatience and terror and apprehension shewed too little of that reliance and resignation which afford the most comfortable reflections to the  friends  of the dying as well as to the  dying  themselves  But we must leave poor Belton to that mercy which we have all so much need of and for my own part do you Lovelace and the rest of the fraternity as ye will I am resolved I will endeavour to begin to repent of my follies while my health is sound my intellects untouched and while it is in my power to make some atonement as near to restitution as is possible to those I have wronged or missed And do ye  outwardly  and from a point of  false bravery  make as light as ye will of my resolution as ye are none of ye of the class of abandoned and stupid sots who endeavour to disbelieve the future existence which ye are afraid of I am sure you will justify me in your  hearts  if not by your  practices  and one day you will wish you had joined with me in the same resolution and will confess there is more good sense in it than now perhaps you will own  Seven o' clock Thursday morning  YOU are very earnest by your last letter just given me to hear again from me before you set out for Berks I  will therefore close with a few words upon the  only  subject in your letter which I can at present touch upon and this is the letter you give me a copy of from the lady  Want of rest and the sad scene I have before my eyes have rendered me altogether incapable of accounting for it in any shape You are in ecstasies upon it You have reason to be so if it be as you think Nor would I rob you of your joy But I must say that I am amazed at it  Surely Lovelace this surprizing letter cannot be a forgery of thy own in order to carry on some view and to impose upon me Yet by the style of it it cannot tho' thou art a perfect Proteus too  I will not however add another word after I have desired the return of this and have told you that I am  Your true Friend and Wellwisher  J BELFORD  LETTER VII Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Aug    Thursday morn  I Received thy letter in such good time by thy fellow's dispatch that it gives me an opportunity of throwing in a few paragraphs upon it I read a passage or two of it to Mowbray and we both agree that thou art an absolute master of the Lamentable  Poor Belton what terrible conflicts were thy last conflictsI hope however that he is happy And I have the more hope because the hardness of his death is likely to be such a warning to  thee  If it have the effect thou declarest it shall have what a world of mischief will it prevent How much good will it do How many poor wretches will rejoice at the occasion if they know it however melancholy in itself which shall bring them in a compensation for injuries they had been forced to sit down contented with But Jack tho' thy uncle's death has made thee a rich fellow art thou sure that the making good of such a vow will not totally bankrupt thee  Thou sayest I may laugh at thee if I will Not I Jack I do not take it to be a laughing subject And I am heartily concerned at the loss we all have in poor Belton And when I get a little settled and have leisure to contemplate the vanity of all sublunary things a subject  that will nowandthen in my gayest hours obtrude itself upon me it is very likely that I may talk seriously with thee upon these topics and if thou hast not got too much the start of me in the repentance thou art entering upon will go handinhand with thee in it If thou hast thou wilt let me just keep thee in my eye for it is an uphill work and I shall see thee at setting out at a great distance but as thou art a much heavier and clamsier fellow than myself I hope that without much puffing and sweating only keeping on a good round dogtrot I shall be able to overtake thee  Mean time take back thy letter as thou desirest I would not have it in my pocket upon any account at present nor read it once more  I am going down without seeing my Beloved I was a hasty fool to write her a letter promising that I would not come near her till I saw her at her father's For as she is now actually at Smith's and I so near her one short visit could have done no harm  I sent Will two hours ago with my grateful compliments and to know how she does How must I adore this charming creature For I am ready to think my servant a happier fellow than myself for having been within a pair of stairs and an apartment of her  Mowbray and I will drop a tear apiece as we ride along to the memory of poor Belton  As we ride along  I say For we shall have so much joy when we arrive at Lord M's and when I communicate to him and my cousins the dear creature's letter that we shall forget every thing grievous Since now their familyhopes in my reformation the point which lies so near their hearts will all revive it being an article of their faith that if I marry repentance and mortification will follow of course  Neither Mowbray nor I shall accept of thy  verbal  invitation to the funeral We like not these dismal formalities And as to the respect that is supposed to be shewn to the memory of a deceased friend in such an attendance why should we do any thing to reflect upon those who have made it a fashion to leave this parade to people whom they  hire for that purpose  Adieu and be chearful Thou canst now do no more for poor Belton wert thou to howl for him to the end of thy life  LETTER VIII Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Sat Aug    ON Thursday afternoon I assisted at the opening of poor Belton's will in which he has left me his sole Executor and bequeathed me a legacy of guineas which I shall present to his unfortunate sister to whom he has not been so kind as I think he ought to have been He has also left  l  apiece to Mowbray Tourville thyself and me for a ring to be worn in remembrance of him  After I had given some particular orders about the preparations to be made for his funeral I went to town but having made it late before I got in on Thursday night and being fatigued for want of rest several nights before and low in my spirits I could not help it Lovelace I contented myself to send my compliments to the innocent sufferer to inquire after her health  My servant saw Mrs Smith who told him she was very glad I was come to town for that the lady was worse than she had yet been  It is impossible to account for the contents of her letter to you or to reconcile those contents to the facts I have to communicate  I was at Smith's by seven yesterday Friday morning and found that the lady was just gone in a chair to St Dunstan's to prayers she was too ill to get out by six to Covent Garden church and was forced to be supported to her chair by Mrs Lovick They would have persuaded her against going but she said she knew not but it would be her last opportunity Mrs Lovick dreading that she would be taken worse at church walked thither before her  Mrs Smith told me she was so ill on Wednesday night that she had desired to receive the Sacrament and accordingly it was administred to her by the parson of the parish Whom she besought to take all opportunities of assisting her in her solemn Preparation  This the gentleman promised And called in the morning to enquire after her health and was admitted at the first word He staid with her about half an hour and when he came down with his face turned aside and a faltering accent  'Mrs Smith said he you have an  angel in your houseI will attend her again in the evening as she desires and as often as I think it will be agreeable to her'  Her increased weakness she attributed to the fatigues she had undergone by your means and to a letter she had received from her sister which she answered the same day  Mrs Smith told me that two different persons had called there one on Thursday morning one in the evening to inquire after her state of health and seemed as if commissioned from her relations for that purpose but asked not to see her only were very inquisitive after her visitors particularly it seems after  me  What could they mean by that after her way of life and expences and one of them inquired after her manner of supporting them to the latter of which Mrs Smith said she had answered as the truth was that she had been obliged to sell some of her cloaths and was actually about parting with more at which the inquirist a grave old farmerlooking man held up his hands and said Good Godthis will be sad sad news to somebody I believe I must not mention it But Mrs Smith says she desired he  would  let him co  e from whom he would He shook his head and said if she died the flower of the world would be gone and the family she belonged to would be no more than a common family  This man came from her  hereafter  I was pleased with the man's expression  You may be curious to know how she passed her time when she was obliged to leave her lodging to avoid you  Mrs Smith tells me  'That she was very ill when she went out on Monday morning and sighed as if her heart would break as she came down stairs and as she went through the shop into the coach her nurse with her as you had informed me before That she ordered the coachman whom she hired for the day to drive anywhither so it was  nto the air He accordingly drove her to Hamstead and thence  ate There she  lighted at the Bowlinggree    remely ill and having breakfasted ordered  coa  to drive very slowly anywhere H  ellhill  and put up at a public house there where she employed herself two hours in writing tho' exceedingly weak and low till the dinner she had ordered was brought in She endeavoured to eat but could not her appetite was gone quite gone she said And then she wrote on for three hours more After which being heavy she dozed a little in an elbowchair When she awoke she ordered the coachman to drive her very slowly to town to the house of a friend of Mrs Lovick whom as agreed upon she met there But being extremely ill she would venture home at a late hour altho' she heard from the widow that you had been there and had reason to be shocked at your behaviour She said She found there was no avoiding you She was apprehensive she should not live many hours and it was not impossible but the shock the sight of you must give her would determine her fate in your presence  'She accordingly went home She heard the relation of your astonishing vagaries with hands and eyes often lifted up and with the words Shocking creature Incorrigible wretch and Will nothing make him serious intermingled And not being able to bear an interview with a man so hardened she took to her usual chair early in the morning and was carried to the Templestairs whither she had ordered her nurse before her to get a pair of oars in readiness for her fatigues the day before made her unable to bear a coach and then she was rowed to Chelsea where she breakfasted and after rowing about put in at the Swan at BrentfordAight where she dined and would have written but had no conveniency either of tolerable pens or ink or private room and then proceeding to Richmond they rowed her back to Mortlack where she put in and drank tea at a house her waterman recommended to her She wrote there for an hour and returned to the Temple and when she landed made one of the watermen get her a chair and so was carried to the widow's friend as the night before where she again met the widow who informed her that you had been after her twice that day  'Mrs Lovick gave here there her sister's letter  See Letter XI  and  she was so much affected with the contents of it that she was twice very near fainting away and wept bitterly as Mrs Lovick told Mrs Smith dropping some warmer expressions than ever they had heard proceed from her lips in relation to her friends calling them cruel and complaining of ill offices done her and of vile reports raised against her  'While she was thus disturbed Mrs Smith came to her and told her that you had been there a third time and was just gone at half an hour after nine having left word how civil and respectful you would be but that you was determined to see her at all events  'She said It was hard she could not be permitted to die in peace That her lot was a severe one That she began to be afraid she should not forbear repining and to think her punishment greater than her fault but recalling herself immediately she comforted herself that her life would be short and with the assurance of a better'  By what I have mentioned You will conclude with me that the letter brought her by Mrs Lovick the superscription of which you saw to be written in her sister's hand could not be the letter on the contents of which she grounded  that  she wrote to you on her return home And yet neither Mrs Lovick nor Mrs Smith nor the servant of the latter know of any other brought her But as the women assured me that she actually  did  write to you I was eased of a suspicion which I had begun to entertain that you for some purpose I could not guess at had forged the letter from her of which you sent me a copy  On Wednesday morning when she received your letter in answer to hers she said Necessity may well be called the mother of InventionBut Calamity is the test of IntegrityI hope I have not taken an inexcusable stepand there she stopt a minute or two and then said I shall now perhaps be allowed to die in peace  I staid till she came in She was glad to see me but being very weak said she must sit down before she could go up stairs and so went into the backshop leaning upon Mrs Lovick And when she had sat down  'I am glad to see you Mr Belford said she I  must  say solet misreporters say what they will'  I wondered at this expression  Explained hereafter  but would not interrupt her  Oh Sir said she I have been grievously harassed Your friend who would not let me live with reputation will not permit me to die in peaceYou see how I amIs there not a great alteration in me within this weekBut 'tis all for the betterYet were I to wish for life I must say that your friend your barbarous friend has  hurt  me greatly  She was so very weak so shortbreath'd and her words and action so very moving that I was forced to walk from her the two women and her nurse turning away their faces also weeping  I have had Madam said I since I saw you a most shocking scene before my eyes for days together My poor friend Belton is no more He quitted the world yesterday morning in such dreadful agonies that the impression it has left upon me has  so weakened  my mindI was loth to have her think that my grief was owing to the weak state I saw her in for fear of dispiriting her  That is only Mr Belford interrupted she in order to  strengthen  it if a proper use be made of the impressionBut I should be glad since you are so humanely affected with the solemn circumstance that you could have written an account of it in the style and manner you are master of to your gay friend Who knows as it would have come  from  an associate and  of  an associate how it might have affected him  That I  had  done I told her in such a manner as had I believed some effect upon you  His behaviour in this honest family so lately said she and his cruel pursuit of me give but little hopes that any thing serious or solemn will affect him  We had some  alk about Belton's dying behaviour and I gave her several particulars of the poor man's impatience and despair to which she was very attentive and made fine observations upon the subject of procrastination  A letter and pacq  et were brought her by a man on horseback from Miss Howe while we were talking She retired upstairs to read it and while I was in discourse  with Mrs Smith and Mrs Lovick the doctor and apothecary both came in together They confirmed to me my fears as to the dangerous way she is in They had both been apprized of the new instances of implacableness in her friends and of your persecutions And the doctor said He would not for the world be either the unforgiving father of that lady or the man who had brought her to this distress Her heart's broke she'll die said he There is no saving her But how were I either the one or the other of the people I have named I should support myself afterwards I cannot tell  When she was told we were all three together she desired us to walk up She arose to receive us and after answering two or three general questions relating to her health she addressed herself to us to the following effect  As I may not said she see you three gentlemen together again let me take this opportunity to acknowlege my obligations to you all I am inexpressibly obliged to You Sir and to You Sir courtesying to the doctor and to Mr Goddard for your  more  than friendly your  paternal  care and concern for me Humanity in your profession I dare say is far from being a rare qualification because you are gentlemen  by  your profession But so much kindness so much humanity did never desolate creature meet with as I have met with from you both But indeed I have always observed that where a person relies upon Providence it never fails to raise up a new friend for every old one that falls off  This gentleman bowing to me who some people think should have been one of the last I should have thought of as my Executoris nevertheless such is the strange chance of things the only one I can choose and therefore I have chosen him for that charitable office and he has been so good as to accept of it For rich as I may boast myself to be I am rather so in  right  than in  fact  at this present I repeat therefore my humble thanks to you all three and beg of God to return to You and Yours looking to each an hundredfold the kindness and favour you have shewn me and that it may be in the power of You and of Yours to the end of time to confer  benefits rather than to be obliged to receive them This is a godlike power gentlemen I once rejoiced in it in some little degree and much more in the prospect I had of its being inlarged to me tho' I have had the mortification to experience the reverse and to be obliged almost to every body I have seen or met with But all originally thro' my own fault so I ought to bear the punishment without repining And I hope I doForgive these impertinencies A grateful heart that wants the power it wishes for to express itself suitably to its own impulses will be at a loss what properly to dictate to the tongue and yet unable to restrain its overflowings will force it to say weak and silly things rather than appear ingratefully silent Once more then I thank ye all three for your kindness to me And God Almighty make you that amends which at present I cannot  She retired from us to her closet with her eyes full and left us looking upon one another  We had hardly recovered ourselves when she quite easy chearful and smiling returned to us Doctor said she seeing we had been moved you will excuse me for the concern I give you and so will You Mr Goddard and You Mr Belford for 'tis a concern that only generous natures can shew and to such natures  sweet  is the pain if I may so say that attends such a concern But as I have some few preparations still to make and would not tho' in ease of Mr Belford's future cares which is and ought to be part of my study undertake more than it is likely I shall have time lent me to perform I would beg of you to give me your opinions You see my way of living and you may be assured that I will do nothing wilfully to shorten my life how long it may possibly be before I may hope to be released from all my troubles  They both hesitated and looked upon each other Don't be afraid to answer me said she each sweet hand pressing upon the arm of each gentleman with that mingled freedom and reserve which virgin modesty mixed with conscious dignity can only express and with a look serenely earnest Tell me how long you think I may hold it And believe me gentlemen the shorter  you tell me my time is likely to be the more comfort you will give me  With what pleasing woe said the doctor do you fill the minds of those who have the happiness to converse with you and see the happy frame you are in What you have undergone within a few days past has much hurt you And should you have fresh troubles of those kinds I could not be answerable for your holding itAnd there he paused  How long doctorI believe I  shall  have a little more rufflingI am afraid I shallBut there can happen only one thing that I shall not be tolerably easy underHow long then Sir  He was silent  A Fortnight Sir  He was still silent  Ten daysA weekHow long Sir with smiling earnestness  If I  must  speak Madam If you have not better treatment than you have lately met with I am afraidThere again he stopt  Afraid of what doctor Don't be afraidHow long▪ Sir  That a fortnight or three weeks may deprive the world of the finest flower in it  A fortnight or three weeks yet doctorBut God's will be done I shall however by this means have full time if I have but strength and intellect to do all that is now upon my mind to do And so Sirs I can but once more thank you turning to each of us for all your goodness to me and having letters to write will take up no more of your timeOnly doctor be pleased to order me some more of those drops They chear me a little when I am low and putting a fee into his unwilling handYou know the terms SirThen turning to Mr Goddard You'll be so good Sir as to look in upon me tonight or tomorrow as you have opportunity And you Mr Belford I know will be desirous to set out to prepare for the last office for your late friend So I wish you a good journey and hope to see you when that is performed  She then retired with a chearful and serene air The two gentlemen went away together I went down to the women and inquiring found that Mrs Lovick was this day to bring her twenty guineas more for some other of her apparel  The widow told me that she had taken the liberty to expostulate with her upon the  occasion  she had for raising this money to such great disadvantage and it produced the following short and affecting conversation between them  None of my friends will wear any thing of mine said she I shall leave a great many good things behind meAnd as to what I want the money fordon't be surprizedbut suppose I want it to purchase a house  You are all mystery Madam I don't comprehend you  Why then Mrs Lovick I will explain myself I have a man not a woman for my Executor And think you that I will leave to his care any thing that concerns my own personNow Mrs Lovick smiling do you comprehend me  Mrs Lovick wept  O fie proceeded the lady drying up her tears with her own handkerchief and giving her a kissWhy this kind weakness for one whom you have been so little a while acquainted with Dear good Mrs Lovick don't be concerned for me on a prospect which I have occasion to be pleased with but go tomorrow to your friends and bring me the money they have agreed to give you  Thus Lovelace is it plain that she means to bespeak her  last  house Here's presence of mind here's tranquillity of heart on the most affecting occasionThis is magnanimity indeedCouldst thou or could I with all our boist'rous bravery and offensive false courage act thusPoor Belton how unlike was thy behaviour  Mrs Lovick tells me that the lady spoke of a letter she had received from her favourite divine Dr Lewin in the time of my absence And of an answer she had returned to it But Mrs Lovick knows not the contents of either  When thou receivest this letter thou wilt see what will soon be the end of all thy injuries to this divine lady I  say  when thou receivest  it for I will delay it for some little time lest thou shouldst take it into thy head under pretence of resenting the disappointment her letter must give thee to molest her again  This letter having detained me by its length I shall not now set out for Epsom till tomorrow  I should have mentioned that the lady explained to me what the  one thing  was that she was afraid might happen to ruffle her It was the apprehension of what may result from a visit which Col Morden as she is informed designs to make  you    LETTER IX The Revd Dr  LEWEN  To Miss  CL HARLOWE    Friday Aug    PResuming dearest and everrespectable young lady upon your former favour and upon your opinion of my judgment and sincerity I cannot help addressing you by a few lines on your present unhappy situation  I will not look back upon the measures which you have either been  led  or  driven  into But will only say as to  those  that I think you are the least to blame of any young lady that was ever reduced from happy to unhappy circumstances and I have not been wanting to say as much where I hoped my freedom would have been better received than I have had the mortification to find it to be  What I principally write for now is to put you upon doing a piece of justice to yourself and to your sex in the prosecuting for his life I am assured his life is in your power the most profligate and abandoned of men as  he  must be who could act so basely as I understand Mr Lovelace has acted by you  I am very ill and am now forced to write upon my pillow my thoughts confused and incapable of method I shall not therefore aim at method But to give you in general my opinion and that is That your religion your duty to your family the duty you owe to your honour and even charity to your sex oblige you to give public evidence against this very wicked man  And let me add another consideration The prevention by this means of the mischiefs that may otherwise happen between your brother and Mr Lovelace or between the latter and your cousin Morden who is now I hear arrived and resolves to have justice done you  A consideration which ought to affect your conscience Forgive me dearest young lady I think I am now in the way of my duty and to be of more concern to you than that hard pressure upon your modesty which I know the appearance against him in an open Court must be of to such a lady as you And which I conceive will be your great difficulty But I know Madam that you have dignity enough to  become  the blushes of the most naked truth when necessity justice and honour exact it from you Rakes and Ravishers would meet with encouragement  indeed  and most from those who had the greatest abhorrence of their actions if violated modesty were never to complain of the injury it received from the villainous attempters of it  In a word the reparation of your family dishonour now rests in your own bosom and which only one of these two alternatives  can  repair to wit either to Marry or to prosecute him at Law Bitter expedients for a soul so delicate as yours  He and all his friends I understand sollicit you to the first And it is certainly now all the amends within his power to make But I am assured that you have rejected  their  sollicitations and  his  with the indignation and contempt that his foul actions have deserved But yet that you refuse not to extend to him the Christian forgiveness he has so little reason to expect provided he will not disturb you further  But Madam the prosecution I advise will not let your present and future exemption from fresh disturbance from so vile a molester depend upon his  courtesy  I should think so noble and so rightlyguided a spirit as yours would not permit that it should if you could help it  And can indignities of any kind be  properly pardoned  till we have it in  our power to punish them  To pretend to pardon while we are labouring under the pain or dishonour of them will be thought by some to be but the vaunted mercy of a pusilanimous heart trembling to resent them  The remedy I propose is a severe one but what pain can be more severe than the injury or how will injuries be believed to grieve us that are never honourably complained of  I am sure Miss Clarissa Harlowe however injured and oppressed remains unshaken in her sentiments of honour and virtue And although she would sooner die than  deserve  that her modesty should be drawn into question yet she will think no truth immodest that is to be uttered in the vindicated cause of innocence and chastity Little very little difference is there my dear young lady between a  suppressed  evidence and a  false  one  It is a terrible circumstance I once more own for a young lady of your delicacy to be under the obligation of telling so shocking a story in public Court But it is still a worse imputation that she should pass over so mortal an injury unresented  Conscience honour justice and the cares of heaven are on your side And modesty would by some be thought but an empty name should you refuse to obey their dictates  I have been consulted I own on this subject I have given it as my opinion that you ought to prosecute the abandoned man But without my reasons These I reserved with a resolution to lay them before you unknown to any body that the result if what I wish might be  your own    I will only add that the misfortunes which have befallen you had they been the lot of a child of my own could not have affected me more than yours have done My own child I love But I both love and honour you Since to love you is to love virtue good sense prudence and every thing that is good and noble in woman  Wounded as I think all these are by the injuries you have received you will believe that the knowlege of your distresses must have afflicted beyond what I am able to express  Your sincere Admirer and humble Servant  ARTHUR LEWEN  I just now understand that your sister will by proper authority propose this prosecution to you I humbly presume  that the reason why you resolved not upon this step from the first was that you did not know that it would have the  countenance and support of your relations    LETTER X Miss  CL HARLOWE  To the Rev Dr  LEWEN    Sat Aug    Reverend and Dear Sir  I Thought till I received your affectionate and welcome letter that I had neither father uncle brother left nor hardly a friend among my former favourers of your sex Yet knowing  you  so well and having no reason to upbraid myself with a faulty will I was to blame even although I had doubted the continuance of your good opinion to decline the tryal whether I had forfeited it or not and if I had whether I could not  honourably  reinstate myself in it  But Sir it was owing to different causes that I did not partly to  shame  to think how high in my happier days I stood in your esteem and how much I must be sunk in it since those so much nearer in relation to me gave me up partly to  deep distress  which makes the humbled heart diffident and made mine afraid to claim the kindred mind in yours which would have supplied to me in some measure all the dear and lost relations I have named  Then So loth as I sometimes was to be thought to want to make a  party  against those whom both duty and inclination bid me reverence So long  trailed  on between  hope and doubt  So  little mine own mistress  at one time so fearful of  making or causing mischief  at another and not being encouraged to hope by  your kind notice  that my application to you would be acceptableapprehending that my relations had engaged your  silence  at least  The stiff visit this good divine was prevailed upon to make her as mentioned Vol II p of which however she was too generous to remind him might warrant the lady to think that he had rather inclined to their party as the  parental side  than to hers    THESEBut why these unavailing retrospections now I  was  to be unhappyin order to  be  happy that is my hopeResigning therefore to That hope I will without any further preamble write a few lines if writing  to  you  I can write  but  a few in answer to the subject of your kind letter  Permit me then to say That I believe your arguments would have been unanswerable in almost every  other  case of This nature but in That of the unhappy  Clarissa Harlowe    It is certain that creatures who cannot stand the shock of  public shame  should be doubly careful how they expose themselves to the danger of incurring  private guilt  which may possibly bring them to it But as to  myself  suppose there were no objections from the declining way I am in as to my health and supposing I could have prevailed upon myself to appear against This man was there not room to apprehend that the end so much wished for by my friends to wit his condign punishment would not have been obtained when it came to be seen that I had consented to give him a clandestine meeting and in consequence of that had been weakly tricked out of myself and further still had not been able to avoid living under one roof with him for several weeks which I did not only without complaint but without  cause  of complaint  Little advantage  in a court  perhaps bandied about and jested profligately with would some of those pleas in my favour have been which  out of court  and to a  private  and  serious  audience would have carried the greatest weight against himSuch particularly as the infamous methods to which he had recourse  It would no doubt have been a ready retort from  every  mouth that I ought not to have thrown myself into the power of such a man and that I ought to take for my pains what had befallen me  But had the prosecution been carried on to  effect  and had he even been  sentenced to death  can it be thought that his family would not have had interest enough to obtain his pardon for a crime thought too lightly of though one of the greatest that can be committed against a creature valuing her honour above her lifeWhile I had been censured as pursuing with sanguinary views a man who offered me early all the reparation in his power to make  And had he been  pardoned  would he not then have been at liberty to do as much mischief as ever  I dare say Sir such is the assurance of the man upon whom my unhappy destiny threw me and such his inveteracy to my family which would then have appeared to be justified by their known inveteracy to  him  and by their earnest endeavours to take away his life that he would not have been sorry to have had an opportunity to confront me and my father uncles and brother at the Bar of a court of justice on such an occasion In which case would not on his acquittal or pardon resentments have been reciprocally heightened And then would my brother or my cousin Morden have been more secure than now  How do these considerations aggravate my fault My motives at first were not indeed blameable But I had forgotten the excellent caution which yet I was not ignorant of  That we ought not to do evil that good may come of it    In full conviction of the purity of my heart and of the firmness of my principles Why may I not thus called upon say what I am conscious of and yet without faulty pride since all is but a  duty  and I should be utterly inexcusable could I not justly say what I do In this full conviction he has offered me marriage He has avowed his penitence A  sincere  penitence I have reason to think it tho' perhaps not a  Christian  one And his noble relations kinder to the poor sufferer than her own on the same conviction and his own not ungenerous acknowlegements have joined to intercede with me to  forgive  and  accept  of him Altho' I cannot comply with the latter part of their intercession have not you Sir from the  best  rules and from the  divinest  example taught me to forgive injuries  The injury I have received from him is indeed of the highest nature and it was attended with circumstances of unmanly baseness and premeditation yet I bless God it has not tainted my mind it has not hurt my morals No thanks indeed to the wicked man that it has not No vile courses have followed it My will is unviolated The  evil respecting  myself  and not my  friends  is merely personal No credulity no weakness no want of vigilance have I to reproach myself with I have thro' grace triumphed over the deepest machinations I have escaped from him I have renounced him The man whom once I could have loved I have been enabled to despise And shall not  charity  complete my triumph And shall I not  enjoy  itAnd where would be my triumph if he  deserved  my forgivenessPoor man He has had a loss in losing me I have the pride to think so because I think I know my own heart I have had none in losing him  But I have  another  plea to make which alone would have been enough as I presume to answer the contents of your very kind and friendly letter  I know my dear and reverend friend the spiritual guide and director of my happier days I know that you will allow of my endeavour to bring myself to this charitable disposition when I tell you how near I think myself to that great and awful moment  in  which and even in the ardent preparation  to  which every sense of indignity or injury that concerns not the immortal soul ought to be absorbed in higher and more important contemplations  Thus much for  myself    And for the satisfaction of my  friends  and  favourers  Miss Howe is sollicitous to have all those letters and materials preserved which will set my whole story in a true light The good Dr Lewen is one of the principal of those friends and favourers  The warning that may be given from those papers to all such young creatures as may have known or heard of me may be more efficacious as I humbly presume to think to the end wished for than my appearance could have been in a court of justice pursuing a doubtful event under the disadvantages I have mentioned And if my dear and good Sir you are now on considering every thing of  this  opinion and I could  know  it I should consider it as a particular felicity being as sollicitous as ever to be justified in what I may in your eyes  I am sorry Sir that your indisposition has reduced you to the necessity of writing upon your pillow But how much am I obliged to that kind and generous concern for  me which has  impelled  you as I may say to write a letter containing so many paternal lines with such inconvenience to yourself  May the Almighty bless you dear and reverend Sir for all your goodness to me both of now and of long standing Continue to esteem me to the last as I do and will venerate you And let me bespeak your prayers the  continuance  I should say of your prayers for I doubt not that I have always had them And to them perhaps has in part been owing as well as to your pious precepts thro' my earlier youth that I have been able to make the stand I have made altho' every thing that you prayed for has not been granted to me by that Divine Wisdom which knows what is best for its poor creatures  My prayers for  you  are That it will please God to restore you to your affectionate flock and after as many years of life as shall be for  His  service and to  your own  comfort give us a happy meeting in those regions of blessedness which you have taught me as well by  example  as by  precept  to aspire to  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER XI Miss  ARAB HARLOWE  To Miss  CL HARLOWE    In answer to hers to her uncle  ANTONY  of  Aug    Monday Aug    Sister  CLARY  I Find by your letters to my uncles that they as well as I are in great disgrace with you for writing our minds to you  We can't help it sister Clary  You don't think it worth your while I find to press for the blessing you pretend to be so earnest about a second time You think no doubt that you have done your duty in asking for it So you'll sit down satisfy'd with That I suppose and leave it to your wounded parents to repent hereafter that they have not done  Theirs  in giving it to you at the  first  word and in making such enquiries about you as you think ought to have been made Fine encouragement  to inquire after a runaway daughter living with her fellow as long as he would live with her You repent also with your  full mind  as you modestly call it that you wrote to me  So we are not likely to be applied to any more I find in this way  Well then since This is the case sister Clary let me  with all humility  address myself with a proposal or two to you to which you will be  graciously  pleased to give an answer  Now you must know that we have had hints given us from several quarters that you have been used in such a manner by the villain you ran away with that his life would be answerable for his crime if it were fairly to be proved And by your own hints something like it appears to us  If Clary there be any thing but jingle and affecting period in what proceeds from your  full mind  and your  dutiful consciousness  and if there be truth in what Mrs Norton and Mrs Howe have acquainted us with you may yet justify your character to us and to the world in every thing but your scandalous elopement and the Law may reach the villain And could we but bring him to the gallows what a meritorious revenge would that be to our whole injured family and to the innocents he has deluded as well as the saving from ruin many others  Let me therefore know if you please whether you are willing to appear to do  Yourself  and  Us  and your  Sex  this justice If  not  sister Clary we shall know what to think of you for neither  you  nor  we  can suffer more than we have done from the scandal of your fall And if  you will  Mr Ackland and Counsellor Derham will both attend you to make  proper enquiries  and to take minutes of your story to found a process upon if it will bear one with as great a probability of success as we are told it may be prosecuted with  But by what Mrs Howe intimates this is not likely to be complied with for it is what she hinted to you it seems by her lively daughter but without effect  Vol VI Letter xxiv  and then again possibly you may not at present behave so  prudently in some certain points as to intitle yourself to public justice which if true the Lord have mercy upon you  One word only more as to the above proposalYour admirer Dr Lewen is clear in his opinion that you should prosecute the villain  But if you will not agree to this I have another proposal to make to you and that in the name of every one in the family which is that you will think of going to Pensylvania to reside there for some few years till all is blown over and if it please God to spare you and your unhappy parents till they can be satisfied that you behave like a true and uniform penitent at least till you are oneandtwenty you may then come back to your own estate or have the produce of it sent you thither as you shall choose A period which my papa fixes because it is the  custom  and because he thinks your  grandfather  should have fixed it and because let  me  add you have fully proved by your fine conduct that you were not at years of discretion at  eighteen  Poor doting tho' good old manYour grandfather he thoughtBut I would not be too severe  Mr Hartley has a widowsister at Pensylvania with whom he will undertake you may board and who is a sober sensible and wellread woman And if you were once well there it would rid your father and mother of a world of cares and fears and scandal and I think is what you should wish for of all things  Mr Hartley will engage for all accommodations in your passage suitable to your rank and fortune and he has a concern in a ship which will sail in a month and you may take your secretkeeping Hannah with you or whom you will of your newer acquaintance 'Tis presumed it will be of your own sex  These are what I had to communicate to you and if you'll oblige me with an answer which the hand that conveys this will call for on Wednesday Morning it will be very condescending  ARABELLA HARLOWE  LETTER XII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  ARABELLA HARLOWE

such a business as you mention  The Lord have mercy upon me indeed  For none else will  Surely I am believed to be a creature past all shame or it could not be thought of sending two  gentlemen  to me on such an errand  Had my mother required of me or would  modesty  have permitted you to enquire into the particulars of my sad story or had Mrs Norton been directed to receive them from me methinks it had been more fit and I presume to think more in every one's character too had they been required of me before such heavy judgment had passed upon me as has been passed  I know that this is Dr Lewen's opinion He has been so good as to inforce it in a kind letter to me I have answered his letter and given such reasons as I hope will satisfy  him  I could wish it were thought worth while to ask to see them  This letter was not asked for and the reverend gentleman's death which fell out soon after he had received it was the reason that it was not communicated to the family till it was too late to do the service that might have been hoped for from it    To your other proposal of going to Pensylvania this is my answerIf nothing happen within a month which may full as effectually rid my parents and friends of that world of cares and fears and scandals which you mention and if I am  then  able to be carried on board of ship I will chearfully obey my father and mother altho' I were sure to die in the passage And if I may be forgiven for saying so you shall set over me instead of my poor obliging but really unculpable Hannah your Betty Barnes to whom I will be answerable for all my conduct And I will make it worth her while to accompany me  I am equally surprized and concerned at the hints which both you and my uncle Antony give of  new  points of misbehaviour in meWhat can be meant by them  I will not tell you Miss Harlowe how much I am afflicted at your severity and how much I suffer by it and by your hardhearted levity of style because what I shall say may be construed into  jingle  and  period  and because I know it is  intended  very possibly for  kind  ends to mortify me All I will therefore say is That it does not lose its end if that be it  But nevertheless divesting myself as much as possible of all resentment I will only pray that heaven will give you for  your own  sake a kinder heart than at present since a kind heart I am convinced is a greater blessing to its possessor than it can be to any other person Under this conviction I subscribe myself my dear Bella  Your everaffectionate Sister  CL HARLOWE  LETTER XIII Mrs  JUDITH NORTON  To Miss  CL HARLOWE  In answer to hers of Thursday Aug    Tuesday Aug    My dearest young Lady  THE Letters you sent me I now return by the hand that brings you this  It is impossible for me to express how much I have been affected by them and your last of the th Indeed my dear Miss Clary you are very harshly used indeed you are And if you should be taken from us what grief and what punishment are they not treasuring up against themselves in the heavy reflections which their rash censures and unforgiveness will occasion them  But I find what your uncle Antony's cruel letter is owing to as well as one you will be still more afflicted by God help you my poor dear child when it comes to your hand written by your sister with proposals to you  It was finished to send you yesterday I know and I apprise you of it that you should fortify your heart against the contents of it  The motives which incline them all to this severity if wellgrounded would authorize any severity they could express and which while they believe them to be so both They and You are to be equally pitied  They are owing to the information of that officious Mr Brand who has acquainted them from some enemy of yours in the neighbourhood about you that visits are made you highly censurable from a man of a free character and an intimate of Mr Lovelace who is often in private with you sometimes twice or thrice a day  Betty gives herself great liberties of speech upon this occasion and all your friends are too ready to believe that things are not as they should be which makes me wish that let the gentleman's views be ever so honourable you could intirely drop acquaintance with him  Something of this nature was hinted at by Betty to me before but so darkly that I could not tell what to make of it and this made me mention it to you so  generally  as I did in my last  Your cousin Morden has been among them He is exceedingly concerned for your misfortunes and as they will not believe Mr Lovelace would marry you he is determined to go to Lord M's in order to inform himself from Mr Lovelace's own mouth whether he intends to do you That justice or not  He was extremely caressed by every one at his first arrival but I am told there is some little coldness between them and him at present  I was in hopes of getting a sight of this letter of Mr Brand's a rash officious man But it seems Mr Morden had it given him yesterday to read and he took it away with him  God be your comfort my dear Miss But indeed I am exceedingly disturbed at the thoughts of what may still be the issue of all these things I am  My beloved young Lady  Your most affectionate and faithful  JUDITH NORTON  LETTER XIV Mrs  NORTON  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Tuesday Aug    AFTER I had sealed up the inclosed I had the honour of a private visit from your aunt Hervey who has been in a very lowspirited way and kept her chamber for several weeks past and is but just got abroad  She longed she said to see me and to weep with me on the hard fate that had befallen her beloved niece  I will give you a faithful account of what passed between us as I expect that it will upon the whole administer hope and comfort to you  'She pity'd very much your good mamma who she assured me is obliged to act a part entirely contrary to her inclinations as she herself she owns had been in a great measure  'She said that the poor lady was with great difficulty withheld from answering your letter to her which had as was your aunt's expression almost broken the heart of every one That she had reason to think that she was neither consenting to your two uncles writing nor approving of what they wrote  'She is sure they all love you dearly but have gone 'so far that they know not how to recede  'That but for the  abominable league  which your brother had got everybody into he refusing to set out for Scotland till it was renewed and till they had all promised to take no step towards a reconciliation in his absence but by his consent and to which your sister's resentments kept them up all would before now have happily subsided  'That nobody knew the pangs which their inflexible behaviour gave them ever since you had begun to write to them in so affecting and humble a style  'That however they were not inclined to believe that you were either so ill or so penitent as you really are and still less that Mr Lovelace is in earnest in his offers of marriage  'She is sure she says that all will soon be well And the sooner for Mr Morden's arrival Who is very zealous in your behalf  'She wished to heaven that you would accept of Mr Lovelace wicked as he has been if he were now in earnest  'It had always she said been matter of astonishment to her that so weak a pride in her cousin James of making himself the  whole family  should induce them all to refuse an alliance with such a family as Mr Lovelace's was  'She would have it that your goingoff with Mr Lovelace was the unhappiest step for your honour and your interest that could have been taken for that altho' you would have had a severe tryal the next day yet it would probably have been the  last  and your pathetic powers must have drawn you off some friendshinting at your mamma at your uncle Harlowe at your uncle Hervey and herself'  But here I must observe that the regret that you did not trust to the event of that meeting may not in your present low way too much afflict you that it seems a little too evident from this opinion of your aunt's that it was not so absolutely determined that all compulsion was designed to be avoided since your freedom from it must have been owing to the party to be made among them by your persuasive eloquence and dutiful expostulation  'She owned that some of them were as much afraid of meeting you as you could be of meeting them'  But why so if they designed in the last instance to give you your way  She told me  'That Mrs Williams your mamma's former housekeeper had been with  her  to ask her opinion i  it would be taken amiss if she desired leave to go up to attend her  dearest young lady in her calamity  She referred her to your mamma but had heard no more of it  'Her daughter Miss Dolly she said had been frequently earnest with her on the same subject and renewed her request with the greatest fervor when your first letter came to hand  'Your aunt says that being then very ill she wrote to your mother upon it hoping it would not be taken amiss if she permitted Miss Dolly to go but that your sister as from your mamma answered her That now you seemed to be coming to and to have a due sense of your faults you must be left entirely to their own management  'Miss Dolly she said had pined ever since she had heard of Mr Lovelace's baseness being doubly mortified by it First on account of your sufferings next because she was one who rejoiced in your getting off and vindicated you for it And had incurred censure and illwill on that account especially from your brother and sister so that she seldom went to HarlowePlace'  Make the best use of these intelligences my dearest young lady for your consolation  I will only add that I am with the most fervent prayers for your recovery and restoration  Your everfaithful  JUDITH NORTON  LETTER XV Miss  CL HARLOWE  To Mrs  JUDITH NORTON    Thursday Aug    THE relation of such a conversation as passed between my aunt and you would have given me pleasure had it come some time ago because it would have met with a spirit more industrious than mine  now  is to pick out remote comfort in the hope of a favourable turn that might one day have rewarded my patient duty  I did not doubt my aunt's goodwill to me Her affection I did not doubt But shall we wonder that kings and princes meet with so little controul in their passions be they ever so violent when in a private family an aunt nay even a mother in that family shall choose to give up a once favoured child against their own inclinations rather than oppose an aspiring young man who had armed himself with the authority of a father who when once determined never would be expostulated with  And will you not  blame  me if I say that good sense that relationly indulgence must be a little offended at the treatment I have met with and if I own that I think that great rigor has been exercised towards me And yet I am now authorized to call it  rigor  by the judgment of two excellent sisters my mother and my aunt who acknowlege as you tell me from my aunt that they have been obliged to join against me contrary to their inclinations and that even in a point which concerns my eternal welfare  But I must not go on at this rate For may not the inclination my mother has given up be the effect of a too fond indulgence rather than that I merit the indulgence And yet so petulantly perverse am I that I must tear myself from the subject  All then that I will say further to it at this time is that were the intended goodness to be granted to me but a week hence it would possibly be too lateToo late I mean to be of the consolation to me that I would wish from it For what an inefficacious preparation must I have been making if it has not by this time carried me aboveBut above whatPoor mistaken creatureUnhappy selfdeluderthat finds herself above nothing Nor able to subdue her own faulty impatience  But in  deed  to have done with a subject that I dare not trust myself with if it come in your way let my aunt Hervey let my dear cousin Dolly let the worthy Mrs Williams know how exceedingly grateful to me their kind intentions and concern for me are And as the best warrant or justification of their good opinions since I know that their favour for me is founded on the belief that I loved virtue tell them that I  continued  to love virtue to my last hour as I presume to hope it may be said and assure them that I never made the least  wilful  deviation however unhappy I became for one faulty step which nevertheless was not owing to unworthy or perverse motives  I am very sorry that my cousin Morden has taken a resolution to see Mr Lovelace  My apprehensions on this intelligence are a great abatement to the pleasure I have in knowing that he still loves me  My sister's letter to me is a most afflicting oneSo  needlesly  so  ludicrously  tauntingBut for that part of it that is so I ought rather to pity her than to be so much concerned at it as I am  I wonder what I have done to Mr BrandI pray God to forgive both him and his informants whoever they be But if the scandal arise solely from Mr Belford's visits a very little time will confute itMean while the pacquet I shall send you which I sent to Miss Howe will I hope satisfy  you  my dear Mrs Norton as to my reasons for admitting his visits  My sister's taunting letter and the inflexibleness of my dearer friendsBut how do remoterbegun subjects tend to the point which lies nearest the heartAs newcaught bodily disorders all croud to a fractured or distempered part  I will break off with requesting your prayers that I may be blessed with patience and due resignation and with assuring you that I am and will be to the last hour of my life  Your equally grateful and affectionate  CL HARLOWE  LETTER XVI Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  In reply to hers of Friday Aug      Yarmouth Isle of Wight  Aug    My dearest Friend  I HAVE read the letters and copies of letters you favoured me with And I return them by a particular hand  I am extremely concerned at your indifferent state of health But I approve all your proceedings and precautions in relation to the naming of a man for an office that I hope will not require to be filled up for many many years  I admire and so we do all that greatness of mind which can make you so stedfastly despise thro' such inducements as no other woman could resist and in such desolate circumstances as you are in the wretch that ought to be so heartily despised and detested  What must the contents of those letters from your relations be which you will not communicate to me Fie upon them How my heart risesBut I dare say no moreTho' you yourself now begin to think they use you with great severity  Every body here is so taken with Mr Hickman and the more from the horror they conceive at the character of such a wretch as Lovelace that I have been teazed to death almost to name a day This has given him airs and did I not keep him to it he would behave himself as carelesly and as insolently as if he were sure of me I have been forced to mortify him no less than four times since we have been here  I made him lately undergo a severe penance for some negligences that were not to be passed over Not  designed  ones he said But that was a poor excuse as I told him For had they been  designed  he should never have come into my presence more That they were  not  shewed his want of thought and attention and those were inexcuseable in a man only in his probatory state  He hoped he had been more than in a  probatory  state he said  And therefore Sir might be more  careless  So you add  ingratitude  to  negligence  and make what you plead as  accident  that  itself  wants an excuse  design  which deserves none  I would not see him for two days and he was so penitent and so humble that I had like to have lost myself to make him amends For as you have said a resentment carried too high often ends in an amends too humble  I long to be nearer to you But that must not yet be it seems Pray my dear let me hear from you as often as you can  May heaven increase your comforts and restore your health are the prayers of  Your ever faithful and affectionate  ANNA HOWE  P S  Excuse me that I did not write before it was owing to a little coasting voyage I was obliged to give into  LETTER XVII Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Friday Aug    YOU are very obliging my dear Miss Howe to account to me for your silence I was easy in it as I doubted not that among such near and dear friends as you are with you was diverted from writing by some such agreeable excursion as that you mention  I was in hopes that you had given over at this time of day those very sprightly airs which I have taken the liberty to blame you for as often as you have given me occasion for it and that has been  very  often  I was always very grave with you upon this subject And while your own and a worthy man's future happiness are in the question I must enter into it whenever you forget yourself altho' I had not a day to live And indeed I am very ill  I am sure it was not your intention to take your future husband with you to the little island to make him look weak and silly among those of your relations who never before had seen him Yet do you think it possible for them however prepared and resolved they may be to like him to forbear smiling at him when they see him suffering under your whimsical penances A modest man should no more be made little in  his own eyes  than in the eyes of  others  If he be he will have a diffidence which will give an aukwardness to every thing he says or does And this will be no more to the credit of your choice than to that of the approbation he meets with from your friends or to his own credit  I love an obliging and even an  humble  deportment in a man to the woman he addresses It is a mark of his politeness and tends to give her that opinion of herself which it may be supposed bashful merit wants to be inspired with But if the lady exacts it with a high hand she shews not either her own politeness or gratitude altho' I must confess she does her courage I gave you expectation that I would be very serious with you  O my dear that had it been my lot as I was not permitted  to live single to have met with a man by whom I could have acted generously and unreservedly  Mr Lovelace it is now plain in order to have a pretence against me taxed my behaviour to him with stifness and distance You at one time thought me guilty of some degree of prudery Difficult situations should be allowed for which often make occasions for censure unavoidable I deserved not blame from  him  who made mine difficult And you my dear if I had had any other man to deal with or had he had but half the merit which Mr Hickman has should have found that my doctrine on this subject should have governed my practice  But to put myself out of the questionI'll tell you what I should think were I an indifferent bystander of these high airs of yours in return for Mr Hickman's humble demeanour  "The lady thinks of having the gentleman I see plainly would I say But I see as plainly that she has a very great indifference to him And to what may this indifference be owing To one or all of these considerations no doubt That she receives his addresses rather from motives of convenience than choice That she thinks meanly of  his  endowments and intellects at least more highly of  her own  Or she has not the generosity to use that power with moderation which his great affection for her puts into her hands"  How would you like my dear to have any of these things said  Then to give but the shadow of a reason for freelivers and freespeakers to say or to imagine that Miss Howe gives her hand to a man who has no reason to expect any share in her heart I am sure you would not wish that such a thing should be so much as supposed Then all the regard from you to come  afterwards  none to be shewn  before  must I should think be capable of being construed as a compliment to the  husband  made at the expence of the  wife's delicacy    There is no fear that attempts could be formed by the most audacious two Lovelaces there cannot be upon a character so revered for virtue and so charmingly spirited as Miss Howe's Yet to have any man encouraged to despise  a husband by the example of one who is most concerned to do him honour what my dear think you o  thatIt is but too natural for envious men and who that knows Miss Howe will not envy Mr Hickman to sco  at and to jest upon those who are treated with or will bear indignity from a woman If a man so treated have a true and ardent love for the woman he addresses h  will be easily overawed by her displeasure And this will put him upon acts of submission which will be called  meanness  And what woman of true spirit would like to have it said that she would impose any thing upon the man from whom she one day expected protection and defence that should be capable of being construed as a meanness or unmanly abjectness in his behaviour even to herselfNay I am not sure and I ask it of you my dear to resolve me whether in your own opinion it is no  likely that a woman of spirit will  despise  rather than  val  more the man who will take patiently an insult at he hands especially  before company  I have always observed that prejudices in  disfavour  a person at his first appearance fix deeper and are muc  more difficult to be removed  when  fixed than prejudice in  favour  Whether owing to envy or to that malignant principle so eminently visible in little minds whic  makes them wish to bring down the more worthy characters to their own low level I pretend not to determine When once therefore a woman of your good sense give room to the world to think she has not an high opinio  of the  lover  whom nevertheless she  entertains  it wi  be very difficult for her afterwards to make that wor  think so well as she would have it of the  husband  she ha  chosen  Give me leave to observe that to condescend with  dignity  and to command with such  kindness  and  sweetness manners  as should let the condescension while single b  seen and acknowleged are points which a wise woma  knowing her man  should aim at And a wise woman should think would choose to live single all her life rather than give herself to a man whom she thinks unwo  thy of a treatment so noble  But when a woman lets her lover see that she has the generosity to approve of and reward a wellmeant service that she has a mind that lifts her above the little captious follies which some too licentiously I hope attribute to the sex in general That she resents not if ever she thinks she has reason to be displeased with petulance or through pride Nor thinks it necessary to insist upon little points to come at or secure great ones perhaps not proper to be aimed at Nor leaves room to suppose she has so much cause to doubt her own merit as to put the love of the man she intends to favour upon disagreeable or arrogant tryals But lets reason be the principal guide of her actionsShe will then never fail of that true respect of that sincere veneration which she wishes to meet with and which will make her judgment after marriage consulted sometimes with a  preference  to a man's own at other times as a delightful  confirmation  of it  And so much my beloved Miss Howe for this subject  now  and I dare say  for ever  I will begin another letter byandby and send both togetherMean time I am  c  In the promised next letter the lady acquaints Miss Howe with Mr Brand's Report with her sister's proposals either that she will go abroad or prosecute Mr Lovelace she complains of the severe letter of her uncle Antony and her sister but in milder terms than they deserved  She sends her Dr Lewen's letter and the copy of her answer to it  She tells her of the difficulties she had been under to avoid seeing Mr Lovelace Gives her the contents of the letter she wrote to him Is afraid she says that it is a step that is not strictly right if allegory and metaphor be not allowable to one in her circumstances  She informs her of her cousin Morden's arrival and readiness to take her part with her relations of his designed interview with Mr Lovelace and tells her what her apprehensions are upon it  She gives her the purport of the conversation between her aunt Hervey and Mrs Norton And then adds  But were they ever so favourably inclined to me now what can they do for me I wish and that for their sakes more than for my own that they would yet relentBut I am very illI must drop my PenA sudden Faintness overspreads my heartExcuse my crooked writingAdieu my dearAdieu  Three o' clock Friday  ONCE more I resume my pen I thought I had taken my last farewell of you I never was so very oddly affected Something that seemed totally to overwhelm my facultiesI don't know how to describe itI believe I do amiss in writing so much and taking too much upon me But an active mind tho' clouded by bodily illness cannot be idle  I'll see if the air and a discontinued attention will help meBut if it will not don't be concerned for me my dearI shall be happy Nay I am more so already than of late I thought I could ever be in this lifeYet how this  body  clingsHow it incumbers  Seven o' clock  I could not send this letter away with so melancholy an ending as  you  would have thought it So I deferred closing it till I saw how I should be on my return from my airing And now I must say I am quite another thing So alertthat I could proceed with as much spirit as begun and add more preachment to your lively subject if I had not written more than enough upon it already  I wish you would let me give you and Mr Hickma  joy Do my dearI should take some to  myself  you would  My respectful compliments to all your friends as well to those I have the honour to know as to those I do not know  I HAVE just now been surprized with a letter from one whom I long ago gave up all thoughts of hearing from From Mr Wyerley I will inclose it You'll be surprized at it as much as I was This seems to be a m  whom I  might  have reclaimed But I could not love him Yet I hope I never treated him with arrogance Indeed my dear if I am not too partial to myself I think I refused him with more gentleness than you retain somebody else And this recollection gives me less pain than I should have had in the other case on receiving this instance of generosity that affects me I will also inclose the roug  draught of my answer as soon as I have transcribed it  If I begin another sheet I shall write to the end of it Wherefore I will only add my prayers for your hono  and prosperity and for a long long happy life and that when it comes to be wound up you may be as calm and as easy at quitting it as I hope in God I shall be Who am and will be to the latest moment  Your truly affectionate and obliged Servant  CL HARLOWE  LETTER XVIII Mr  WYERLEY  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Wednesday Aug    Dearest Madam  YOU will be surprised to find renewed at this distance of time an address so positively tho' so politely discouraged But however it be received I  must  renew it Every body has heard that you have been vilely treated by a man who to treat  you  ill must be the vilest of men Every body knows your just resentment of his base treatment That you are determined never to be reconciled to him And that you persist in these sentiments against all the intreaties of his noble relations against all the prayers and repentance of his ignoble self And all the world that have the honour to know  you  or have heard of  him  applaud your resolution as worthy of yourself worthy of your virtue and of that strict honour which was always attributed to you by every one who spoke of you  But Madam were all the world to have been of a different opinion it could never have altered mine I ever loved you I ever  must  love you Yet have I endeavoured to resign to my hard fate When I had so many ways in vain sought to move you in my favour I sat down seemingly contented I even wrote to you that I  would  sit down contented And I endeavoured to make all my friends and companions think I was But no body knows what pangs this selfdenial cost me In vain did the chace in vain did travel in vain did lively company offer themselves Tho' embraced each in its turn yet with redoubled force did my passion for you bring on my unhappiness when I looked into myself into my own heart for there did your charming image sit inthroned and you ingrossed  ne all  I truly deplore those misfortunes and those sufferings for your  own  sake which nevertheless encourage  me  to renew my bold hope I know not particulars I dare not inquire after them because  my  sufferings would be increased with the knowlege of what  yours  have been I therefore desire not to know more than what common report wounds my ears with and what is given me to know by your absence from your cruel family and from the sacred place where I among numbers of your rejected admirers used to be twice a week sure to behold you doing credit to that service of which your example gave me the highest notions But whatever be those misfortunes of whatsoever nature those sufferings I shall bless the occasion for  my own  sake tho' for  yours  curse the author of them if they may give me the happiness to know that this my renewed address may not be absolutely rejected Only give me hope that it may one day meet with encouragement if in the interim nothing happen either in my morals or behaviour to give you fresh offence Give me but hope of thisNot absolutely to  reject  me is all the hope I ask for and I will love you if possible still more than I ever loved youAnd that for your sufferings for well you deserve to be loved even to adoration who can for honour and for virtue's sake subdue a passion which common spirits I speak by cruel experience find invincible and this at a time when the black offender kneels and supplicates as I am well assured he does all his friends likewise supplicating for him to be forgiven  That you cannot forgive him not forgive him so as to receive him again to favour is no wonder His offence is against virtue That is a part of your essenceWhat magnanimity is this How just to yourself and to your spotless character Is it any merit to admire more than ever so exalted a distinguisher It is not I cannot plead it  What hope have I left may it be said when my address was  before  rejected now that your sufferings so  nobly borne  have with all  good judges  exalted your character Yet Madam I have to pride myself in this That while your friends not looking upon you in the just light I do persecute and banish you while your fortune and estate is withheld from you and threatened as I  know    to be withheld as long as the chicaning Law or rather the chicaneriers of its practicers can keep it from you While you are destitute of protection every body standing aloof either thro' fear of the injurer of one family or of the hardhearted of the other I pride myself I say to stand forth and offer my fortune and my life at your devotion With a  selfish  hope indeed I should be too great an hypocrite not to own this And I know how much you abhor insincerity  But whether you encourage that hope or not accept my best services I beseech you Madam And be pleased to excuse me for a piece of hone start which the nature of the case doubting the honour of your notice otherwise makes me choose to conclude withIt is this  If I am to be still the most unhappy of men let your pen by  one line  tell me so If I am permitted to indulge a hope however distant your  silence  shall be deemed by me the happiest indication of it that you can giveExcept that  still  happierthe happiest that  can  befal me a signification that you will accept the tender of that life and fortune which it would be my pride and my glory to sacrifice in your service leaving the reward to  yourself    Be your determination as it may I must for ever admire and love you Nor will I ever change my condition while you live whether you change yours or not For having once had the presumption to address  You  I cannot stoop to think of any other woman And this I solemnly declare in the presence of that God whom I daily pray to bless and protect you be your determination what it will with regard to dearest Madam  Your most devoted and everaffectionate and faithful Servant  ALEXANDER WYERLEY  LETTER XIX Miss  CL HARLOWE  To  ALEX WYERLEY  Esq  Sat Aug    SIR  THE generosity of your purpose would have commanded not only my notice but my thanks altho' you had  not  given me the alternative you are pleased to  call  artful  And I do therefore give you my thanks for your kind letter  At the time you distinguished me by your favourable opinion I told you Sir that my choice was the single life And most  truly  did I tell you so  When that was not permitted me and I looked round upon the several gentlemen who had been proposed to me and had reason to believe that there was not one of them against whose morals or principles there lay not some exception it would not have been  much  to be wondered at if FANCY  had  been allowed to give a preference where JUDGMENT was at a loss to determine  Far be it from me to say this with a design to upbraid you Sir or to reflect upon you I always wished you well You had reason to think I did You had the generosity to be pleased with the frankness of my behaviour to you as I had with that of yours to me And I am sorry to be now told that the acquiescence you obliged me with gave you so much pain  Had the option I have mentioned been allowed me  afterwards  as I not only wished but proposed things had not happened that did happen But there was a kind of fatality by which our whole family was impelled as I may say and which none of us were permitted to avoid But this is a subject that cannot be dwelt upon  As matters are I have only to wish for your own sake that you will encourage and cultivate those good motions in your mind to which many passages in your kind and generous letter now before me must be owing Depend upon it Sir that such motions wrought into habit will yield you pleasure at a  time  when nothing else can And at  present  shining out in your actions and conversation will commend you to the worthiest of our Sex For Sir the man who is good upon  choice  as well as by  education  has that quality in himself which ennobles the human race and without which the most dignified by birth or rank are ignoble  As to the resolution you so solemnly make not to marry while I live I should be concerned at it were I not morally sure that you may keep it and yet not be detrimented by it Since a few a very few days will convince  you that I am got above all human dependenceand that there is no need of that protection and favour which you so generously offer to Sir  Your obliged Wellwisher and humble Servant  CL HARLOWE  LETTER XX Mr  LOVELACE  To  J BELFORD  Esq  Monday noon Aug    ABOUT the time of poor Belton's interrment last night as near as we could guess Lord M Mowbray and myself toasted once  To the memory of honest Tom Belton  and by a quick transition to the living  Health to Miss Harlowe  which Lord M obligingly began and  To the happy reconciliation  and then we stuck in a remembrance  To honest Jack Belford  who of late we all agreed was become an useful and humane man preferring his friend's service to his own  But what is the meaning I hear nothing from thee  Mr Belford had not yet sent him his lastwritten letter His reason for which see p  And why dost thou not let me into the grounds of the sudden reconciliation between my beloved and her friends and the cause of the generous invitation which she gives me of attending her at her father's some time hence  Thou must certainly have been let into the secret by this time and I can tell thee I shall be plaguy jealous if there be any one thing pass between my Angel and Thee that is to be concealed from me For either I am a principal in this cause or I am nothing I have dispatched Will to know the reason of thy neglect  But let me whisper a word or two in thy ear I begin to be afraid after all that this letter was a stratagem to get me out of town and for nothing else for in the f  rst place Tourville in a letter I received this morning tells me that the lady is actually very illI am sorry for it with all my soul This thou'lt say I may think a reason why she cannot  set out as yet  But then I have heard on the other hand but last night that the family is as implacable as ever and my Lord and I expect this very afternoon a visit from Colonel Morden who undertakes  it seems to question me as to my intention with regard to his cousin  This convinces me that if she  has  apprised them of my offers to her they will not believe me to be in earnest till they are assured that I am so from my own mouth And then I understand that the intended visit is an officiousness of Morden's own without the desire of any of her friends  Now Jack what can a man make of all this My intelligence as to the continuance of her family's implacableness is not to be doubted and yet when I read her letter what can one say Surely the dear little rogue will not lie  I never knew her dispense with her word but once And that was when she promised to forgive me after the dreadful fire that had like to have happened at our mother's and yet would not see me next day and afterwards made her escape to Hamstead in order to avoid forgiving me And as she severely smarted for this departure from her honour given for it is a sad thing for good people to break their word when it is in their power to keep it one would not expect that she should set about deceiving again more especially by the  premeditation of writing  You perhaps will ask What honest man is obliged to keep his promise with a highwayman for well I know your unmannerly way of making comparisons But I say  every  honest man isAnd I will give you an illustration  Here is a marauding varlet who demands your money with his pistol at your breast You have neither money nor valuable effects about you and promise solemnly if he will spare your life that you will send him an agreedupon sum by such a day to such a place The question is If your life is not in the fellow's power  How he came by the power is another question for which he must answer with  his  life when caughtso he runs risque for risque  Now if he gives you  your life  does he not give think you a valuable consideration for the money you engage your honour to send him If not the sum must be exorbitant or your life is a very paltry one even in your own opinion  I need not make the application and I am sure that even thou thyself who never sparest me and thinkest thou knowest  my  heart by  thy own  canst not possibly put the case in a stronger light against me  Then why do good people take upon themselves to censure as they do persons  less  scrupulous than themselves Is it not because the latter allow themselves in  any  liberty in order to carry a point And can my not doing  my  duty warrant another for not doing  his  Thou wilt not say it can  And how would it sound to put the case as strongly once more as my greatest enemy would put it both as to  fact  and in  words  Here has that profligate wretch Lovelace broken his vow with and deceived Miss Clarissa HarloweA vile fellow would an enemy say But it is  like  him But when it comes to be said that the pious Miss Clarissa Harlowe has broken her word with and deceived Lovelace Good Lord would every one say Sure it cannot be  Upon my soul Jack such is the veneration I have for this admirable woman that I am shocked barely at putting the case and so wilt thou if thou respectest her as thou oughtest For thou knowest that men and women all the world over form their opinions of one another by each person's professions and known practices In this lady therefore it would be as unpardonable to tell a wilful untruth as it would be strange if I kept my wordIn Lovecases I mean for as to the rest I am an honest moral man as all who know me can testify  And what after all would this lady deserve if she has deceived me in this case For did she not set me prancing away upon Lord M's best nag to Lady Sarah's and to Lady Betty's with an erect and triumphing countenance to shew them her letter to me And I have received their congratulations upon it Well and now Cousin Lovelace cries one Well and now cousin Lovelace cries t'other I hope you'll make the best of husbands to so excellent and so forgiving a lady And now we shall soon have the pleasure of looking upon you as a reformed man added one And now we shall see you in the way we have so long wi  hed you to be in exulted the other  My cousins Montague also have been ever since rejoicing in the new relationship Their charming cousin and their lovely cousin at every wordAnd how dearly they will love herWhat lessons will they take from herAnd yet Charlotte who pretends to have the eye of an eagle was for finding out some mystery in the style and manner till I overbore her and laughed her out of it  As for Lord M he has been in hourly expectation of being sent to with proposals of one sort or other from the Harlowes And still will have it that such proposals will be made by Colonel Morden when he comes and that the Harlowes only put on a face of irreconcileableness till they know the issue of Morden's visit in order to make the better terms with us  Indeed if I had not undoubted reason as I said to believe the continuance of their antipathy to  me  and implacableness to  her  I should be apt to think there might be some foundation for my Lord's conjecture for there is a cursed deal of low cunning in all that family except in the angel of it who has so much generosity of soul that she despises cunning both name and thing  What I mean by all This is to let thee see what a stupid figure I should make to all my own family if my Clarissa has been capable as Gulliver in his abominable Yahoostory phrases it of saying the  thing that is not  By my soul Jack if it were only that I should be  outwitted  by such a novice at plotting and that it would make me look silly to my kinswomen here who know I value myself upon my contrivances it would vex me to the heart and I would instantly clap a featherbed into a coach and fix and fetch her away sick or well and marry her at my leisure  But Col Morden is come and I must break off  LETTER XXI Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Monday Night Aug    I Doubt you will be all impatience that you have not heard from me since mine of Thursday last You would be still more so if you knew that I had by me a letter readywritten  I went early yesterday morning to Epsom and found every thing disposed according to the directions I had left on Friday and at night the solemn office was performed Tourville was there and behaved very decently and with greater concern than I thought he would ever have expressed for any body  Thomasine they told me in a kind of disguise was in an obscure pew out of curiosity for it seems she was far from shewing any tokens of grief to see the last office performed for the man whose heart she had so largely contributed to break  I was obliged to stay till this afternoon to settle several necessary matters and to direct inventories to be taken in order for appraisement for every thing is to be turned into money by his will I presented his sister with the guineas the poor man left me as his executor and desired her to continue in the house and take the direction of every thing till I could hear from his nephew at Antigua who is  heir at law  He had left her but  l  altho' he knew her indigence and that it was owing to a vile husband and not to herself that she  was  indigent  The poor man left about  l  in money and  l  in two EastIndia bonds and I will contrive if I can to make up the poor woman's  l  and my guineas  l  to her and then she will have some little matter coming in certain which I will oblige her to keep out of the hands of a son who has compleated that ruin which his father had very near effected  I gave Tourville his  l  and will send you and Mowbray yours by the first order And so much for poor Belton's affairs till I see you  I got to town in the evening and went directly to Smith's I found Mrs Lovick and Mrs Smith in the backshop and I saw they had been both in tears They rejoiced to see me however and told me that the doctor and Mr Goddard were but just gone as was also the worthy clergyman who often comes to pray by her and all three were of opinion that she would hardly live to see the entrance of another week I was not so much surprised as grieved for I had feared as much when I left her on Saturday  I sent up my compliments and she returned that she would take it for a favour if I would call upon her in the morning by eight o'clock Mrs Lovick told me That she had fainted away on Saturday while she was writing as she had done likewise the day before and having received benefit then by a little turn in a chair she was carried abroad again She returned somewhat better and wrote till late yet had a pretty good night and went to Coventgarden church in the morning But came home so ill that she was obliged to lie down  When she arose seeing how much grieved Mrs Lovick and Mrs Smith were for her she made apologies for the trouble she gave themYou were happy said she before I came hither It was a cruel thing in me to come among honest strangers and to be sick and die with you  When they touched upon the irreconcileableness of her friends she said She had ill offices done her to them and they did not know how ill she was nor would they believe any thing she should write But yet she could not but sometimes think it a little hard that she should have so many near and dear friends living and not one to look upon herNo old servant no old friend she said to be permitted to come near her without being sure of incurring displeasure and to have such a great work to go thro' by herself a young creature as she was and to have every thing to think of as to her temporal matters and to order to her very interrment No dear mother said she to pray by me and bless meNo kind sister to sooth and comfort meBut come said she how do I know but all is for the bestIf I can but make a right use of the dispensationPray for me Mrs LovickPray for me Mrs Smith that I mayI have great need of your prayersThis cruel man has discomposed me His persecutions have given me a pain just hereputting her hand to her heart What a step has he made me take to avoid himWho can  touch pitch and not be defiled  He has made a bad spirit take possession of me I thinkBroken in upon all my duties And will not yet I doubt let me be at rest Indeed he is very cruelBut this is one of my trials I believe By God's grace I shall be easier tomorrow and especially if I have no more of his tormentings and if I can can get a tolerable night And I will sit up till eleven that I may  She said That tho' this was so heavy a day with her she was at other times within these few days past especially blessed with bright hours and particularly that she had nowandthen such joyful assurances which she hoped were not presumptuous ones that God would receive her to his mercy that she could hardly contain herself and was ready to think herself above this earth while she was in it And what inferred she to Mrs Lovick must be the state itself the very aspirations after which have often cast a beamy light thro' the thickest darkness and when I have been at the lowest ebb have dispelled the black clouds of despondencyAs I hope they soon will this spirit of repining  She had a pretty good night it seems and this morning went in a chair to St Dunstan's church  The chairmen told Mrs Smith that after prayers for she did not return till between nine and ten they carried her to a house in Fleetstreet where they never waited on her before And where dost think this wasWhy to an Undertaker's Good God what a woman is this She went into the backshop and talked with the master of it about half an hour and came from him with great serenity he waiting upon her to her chair with a respectful countenance but full of curiosity and seriousness  'Tis evident that she then went to bespeak her  house  that she talked of  See p    As soon as you can Sir  were her words to him as she got into the chair Mrs Smith told me this with the same surprize and grief that I heard it  She was so ill in the afternoon having got cold either at St Dunstan's or at chapel that she sent for the clergyman to pray by her and the women unknown to her sent both for Dr H and Mr Goddard Who were just gone as I told you when I came to pay my respects to her this evening  And thus I have recounted from the good women what passed to this night since my absence  I long for tomorrow that I may see her And yet 'tis such a melancholy longing as I never experienced and know not how to describe  Tuesday Aug    I WAS at Smith's at half an hour after seven They  told me that the lady was gone in a chair to St Dunstan's but was better than she had been in either of the two preceding days and said to Mrs Lovick and Mrs Smith as she went into the chair I have a good deal to answer for to you my good friends for my vapourish conversation of last night  If Mrs Lovick said she smiling I have no new matters to discompose me I believe my spirits will hold out purely  She returned immediately after prayers  Mr Belford said she as she entered the backshop where I was and upon my approaching her I am very glad to see you You have been performing for your poor friend a kind last office 'Tis not long ago since you did the same for a near relation Is it not a little hard upon you that these troubles should fall so thick to your lot But they are charitable offices And it is a praise to your humanity that poor dying people know not where to choose so well  I told her I was sorry to hear she had been so ill since I had the honour to attend her but rejoiced to find that now she seemed a good deal better  It will be sometimes better and sometimes worse replied she with poor creatures when they are balancing between life and death But no more of these matters just now I hope Sir you'll breakfast with me I was quite vapourish yesterday I had a very bad spirit upon me Had I not Mrs Smith But I hope I shall be no more so And today I am perfectly serene This day rises upon me as if it would be a bright one  She desired me to walk up and invited Mr Smith and his wife and Mrs Lovick also to breakfast with her I was better pleased with her liveliness than with her looks  The good people retiring after breakfast the following conversation passed between us  Pray Sir let me ask you said she if you think I may promise myself that I shall be no more molested by your friend  I hesitated For how could I answer for such a man  What shall I do if he comes againYou see how I amI cannot fly from him nowIf he has any pity left for the poor creature whom he has thus reduced let him  not comeBut have you heard from him lately And will he come  I hope not Madam I have not heard from him since Thursday last that he went out of town rejoicing in the hopes your letter gave him of a reconciliation between your friends and you and that he might in good time see you at your father's and he is gone down to give all his friends joy of the news and is in high spirits upon it  Alas for me I shall then surely have him come up to persecute me again As soon as he discovers that That was only a stratagem to keep him away he will come up and who knows but even  now  he is upon the road I thought I was so bad that I should have been out of his and every body's way before now for I expected not that this contrivance would serve me above two or three days and by this time he must have found out that I am not so happy as to have any hope of a reconciliation with my family and then he will come if it be only in revenge for what he will think a deceit  I believe I looked surprised to hear her confess that her letter was a stratagem only for she said You wonder Mr Belford I observe that I could be guilty of such an artifice I doubt it is not right But how could I see a man who had so mortally injured me yet pretending sorrow for his crimes and wanting to see me could behave with so much shocking levity as he did to the honest people of the house Yet 'tis strange too that neither you nor he found out my meaning on perusal of my letter You have seen what I wrote no doubt  I have Madam And then I began to account for it as an  innocent  artifice  Thus far indeed Sir it is  innocent  that I meant him no hurt and had a right to the effect I hoped for from it  and he had none to invade me But have you Sir that letter of his in which he gives you as I suppose he does the copy of mine  I have Madam And pulled it out of my lettercase  But hesitatingNay Sir said she be pleased to read my letter to yourselfI desire not to see  his  and see if you can be longer a stranger to a meaning so obvious  I read it to myselfIndeed Madam I can find nothing but that you are going down to Harloweplace to be reconciled  to your father and other friends And Mr Lovelace presumed that a letter from your sister which he saw brought when he was at Mr Smith's gave you the welcome news of it  She then explained all to me and that as I may say in six wordsA  religious  meaning is couched under it and that's the reason that neither you nor I could find it out  Read but for my  father's house Heaven  said she and for the interposition of my dear blessed friend suppose the  Mediation  of my  Saviour  which I humbly rely upon and all the rest of the letter will be accounted for  I read it so and stood astonished for a minute at her invention her piety her charity and at thine and my own stupidity to be thus taken in  And now thou vile Lovelace what hast thou to do the lady all consistent with herself and no hopes left for thee but to hang drown or shoot thyself for an outwitted triumpher  My surprize being a little over she proceeded As to the letter that came from my sister while your friend was here you will  soon  see Sir that it is the cruelest letter she ever wrote me  And then she expressed a deep concern for what might be the consequence of Col Morden's intended visit to you and besought me that if now or at any time hereafter I had opportunity to prevent any further mischief without detriment or danger to myself I would do it  I assured her of the most particular attention to this and to all her commands and that in a manner so agreeable to her that she invoked a blessing upon me for my goodness as she called it to a desolate creature who suffered under the worst of orphanage those were her words  She then went back to her first subject her uneasiness for fear of your molesting her again and said If you have any influence over him Mr Belford prevail upon him that he will give me the assurance that the short remainder of my time shall be all my own I have need of it Indeed I have▪ Why will he wish to interrupt me in my duty Has he not punished me enough for my preference of him to all his sex Has he not destroyed my same and my fortune And will not his causeless vengeance upon  me be complete unless he ruins my soul tooExcuse me Sir this vehemence But indeed it greatly imports me to know that I shall be no more disturbed by him And yet with all this aversion I would sooner give way to his visit tho' I were to expire the moment I saw him than to be the cause of any fatal misunderstanding between you and him  I assured her that I would make such a representation of the matter to you and of the state of her health that I would undertake to  answer for you  that you would not attempt to come near her  And for this reason Lovelace do I lay the whole matter before you and desire you will authorize me as soon as this and mine of Saturday last come to your hands to dissipate her fears  This gave her a little satisfaction and then she said that had I not told her I  could  promise for you she was determined ill as she is to remove somewhere out of my knowlege as well as out of yours And yet to have been obliged to leave people I am but just got acquainted with said the poor lady and to have died among perfect strangers would have completed my hardships  This conversation I found as well from the length as the nature of it had fatigued her and seeing her change colour once or twice I made that my excuse and took leave of her Desiring her permission to attend her in the evening and as often as possible for I could not help telling her that every time I saw her I more and more considered her as a beatified spirit and as one sent from heaven to draw me after her out of the miry gulph in which I had been so long immersed  And laugh at me if thou wilt but it is true that every time I approach her I cannot but look upon her as one just entering into a companionship with saints and angels This thought so wholly possessed me that I could not help begging as I went away her prayers and her blessing and that with the reverence due to an angel and with an earnestness like That which expecting intimates manifest when they seek to make an interest with a person who is just exalted into a prime degree of power by the favour of his prince  In the evening she was so low and weak that I took  my leave of her in less than a quarter of an hour I went directly home Where to the pleasure and wonder of my cousin and her family I now pass many honest evenings Which they impute to your being out of town  I shall dispatch my packet tomorrow morning early by my own servant to make you amends for the suspence I must have kept you in You'll thank me for that I hope but will not I am sure for sending your servant back without a letter  I long for the particulars of the conversation between you and Mr Morden The lady as I have hinted is full of apprehensions about it Send me back this packet when perused for I have not had either time or patience to take a copy of itAnd I beseech you enable me to make good my engagements to the poor lady that you will not invade her again  LETTER XXII Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Wednesday Aug    I HAVE a conversation to give you that passed between this admirable lady and Dr H which will furnish a new instance of the calmness and serenity with which she can talk of death and prepare for it as if it were an occurrence as familiar to her as dressing and undressing  As soon as I had dispatched my servant to you with my letters of the th th and yesterday the th I went to pay my duty to her and had the pleasure to find her after a tolerable night pretty lively and chearful She was but just returned from her usual devotions And Doctor H alighted as she entered the door  After enquiring how she did and hearing her complaints of shortness of breath which she attributed to inward decay precipitated by her late harasses as well from her friends as from you he was for advising her to go into the air  What will that do for me said she Tell me truly good Sir with a chearful aspect you know you cannot disturb me by it whether now you do not put on the  true  physician and despairing that any thing in medicine will help me advise me to the air as the last resourceCan you think the air will avail in such a malady as mine  He was silent  I ask said she because my friends who will possibly some time hence inquire after the means I used for my recovery may be satisfied that I omitted nothing which so worthy and so skilful a physician prescribed  The air Madam may possibly help the difficulty of breathing which has so lately attacked you  But Sir you see how weak I am You must see that I have been consuming from day to day and now if I can judge by what I feel in myself putting her hand to her heart I cannot continue long If the air would  very  probably add to my days tho' I am far from being  desirous  to have them lengthened I would go into it and the rather as I know Mrs Lovick would kindly accompany me But if I were to be at the trouble of removing into new lodgings a trouble which I think now would be too much for me and this only to  die  in the country I had rather the scene were to be shut up here For here have I meditated the spot and the manner and every thing as well of the minutest as of the highest consequence that can attend the solemn moments So Doctor tell me truly May I stay here and be clear of any imputations of curtailing thro' wilfulness or impatiency or thro' resentments which I hope I am got above a life that might otherwise be prolongedTell me Sir you are not talking to a coward in this respect indeed you are notUnaffectedly smiling  The doctor turning to me was at a loss what to say lifting up his eyes only in admiration of her  Never had any patient said she a more indulgent and more humane physicianBut since you are loth to answer my question directly I will put it in other words You don't  injoin  me to go into the air Doctor do you  I do  not  Madam Nor do I now visit you as a physician but as a person whose conversation I admire and whose sufferings I condole And to explain myself more directly as to the occasion of this day's visit in particular I must tell you Madam that understanding how much  you suffer by the displeasure of your friends and having no doubt but that if they knew the way you are in they would alter their conduct to you and believing it must cut them to the heart when too late they shall be informed of everything I have resolved to apprise them by letter stranger as I am to their persons how necessary it is for some of them to attend you very speedily For  their  sakes Madam let me press for your approbation of this measure  She paused and at last said This is kind very kind in you Sir But I hope that you do not think me so perverse and so obstinate as to have left till now any means unessayed which I thought likely to move my friends in my favour But now Doctor said she I should be too much disturbed at their grief if they were any of them to come or to send to me And perhaps if I found they still loved me wish to live and so should quit unwillingly that life which I am now really fond of quitting and hope to quit as becomes a person who has had such a weaningtime as I have been favoured with  I hope Madam said I we are not so near as you apprehend to that deplorable deprivation you hint at with such an amazing presence of mind And therefore I presume to second the doctor's motion if it were only for the sake of your father and mother that they may have the satisfaction if they  must  lose you to think they were first reconciled to you  It is very kindly very humanely considered said she But if you think me not so  very  near my last hour let me desire this may be postponed till I see what effect my cousin Morden's mediation may have Perhaps he may vouchsafe to make me a visit yet after his intended interview with Mr Lovelace is over of which who knows Mr Belford but your next letters may give an account I hope it will not be a fatal one to  any  bodyWill you promise me Doctor to forbear writing for two days only and I will communicate to you any thing that occurs in that time and then you shall take your own way Mean time I repeat my thanks for your goodness to meNay dear Doctor hurry not away from me so precipitately for he was going for fear of an offered fee I will no more affront you with tenders that have pained you for some time past  And since I must now from this kindly offered favour look upon you only as a friend I will assure you henceforth that I will give you no more uneasiness on that head And now Sir I know I shall have the pleasure of seeing you oftener than heretofore  The worthy gentleman was pleased with this assurance telling her that he had always come to see her with great pleasure but parted with her on the account she hinted at with as much pain and that he should not have forborn to double his visits could he have had this kind assurance as early as he wished for it  There are few instances of like disinterestedness I doubt in this tribe Till now I always held it for gospel That  friendship  and  physician  were incompatible things and little imagined that a man of medicine when he had given over his patient to death would think of any visits but those of ceremony that he might stand well with the family against it came to their turns to go thro' his turnpike  After the Doctor was gone she fell into a very serious discourse of the vanity of life and the wisdom of preparing for death while health and strength remained and before the infirmities of body impaired the faculties of the mind and disabled them from acting with the necessary efficacy and clearness The whole calculated for everyone's meridian but particularly as it was easy to observe for Thine and Mine  She was very curious to know further particulars of the behaviour of poor Belton in his last moments You must not wonder at my inquiries Mr Belford said she for who is it that is to undertake a journey into a country they never travelled to before that inquires not into the difficulties of the road and what accommodations are to be expected in the way  I gave her a brief account of the poor man's terrors and unwillingness to die And when I had done Thus Mr Belford said she must it always be with poor souls who have never thought of their long voyage till the moment they are to imbark for it  She made such other observations upon this subject as coming from the mouth of a person who will so soon be a companion for angels I shall never forget And indeed  when I went home that I might ingraft them the better on my memory I entered them down in writing But I will not let you see them until you are in a frame more proper to benefit by them than you are likely to be in one while  Thus far I had written when the unexpected early return of my servant with your packet yours and he meeting at Slough and exchanging letters obliged me to leave off to give its contents a readingHere therefore I close this letter  LETTER XXIII Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Tuesday morn Aug    NOW Jack will I give thee an account of what passed on occasion of the visit made us by Col Morden  He came on horseback attended by one servant and Lord M received him as a relation of Miss Harlowe's with the highest marks of civility and respect  After some general talk of the times and of the weather and such nonsense as Englishmen generally make their introductory topics to conversation the Colonel addressed himself to Lord M and to me as follows  I need not my Lord and Mr Lovelace as you know the relation I bear to the Harlowe family make any apology for entering upon a subject which on account of that relation you must think is the principal reason of the honour I have done myself in this visit  Miss Harlowe Miss Clarissa Harlowe's affair said Lord M with his usual forward bluntness That Sir is what you mean She is by all accounts the most excellent woman in the world  I am glad to hear that is your Lordship's opinion of her It is every one's  It is not only my opinion Col Morden proceeded the prateing peer but it is the opinion of all my family Of my sisters of my nieces and of Mr Lovelace himself  Col  Would to heaven it had been always Mr Lovelace's opinion of her  Lovel  You have been out of England Colonel a good  many years Perhaps you are not yet fully apprised of all the particulars of this case  Col  I have been out of England Sir about seven years My cousin Clary Harlowe was then about  twelve  years of age But never was there at  twenty  so discreet so prudent and so excellent a creature All that knew her or saw her admired her Mind and person never did I see such promises of perfection in any young lady And I am told nor is it to be wondered at that as she advanced to maturity she more than justified and made good those promisesThen as to fortunewhat her father what her uncles and what I myself intended to do for her besides what her grandfather had doneThere is not a finer fortune in the county  Lovel  All this Colonel and more than this is Miss Clarissa Harlowe and had it not been for the implacableness and violence of her family all resolved to push her upon a match as unworthy  of  her as hateful  to  her she had still been happy  Col  I own Mr Lovelace the truth of what you observed just now that I am not thoroughly acquainted with all that has passed between you and my cousin But permit me to say that when I first heard that you made your addresses to her I knew but of one objection against you That indeed a very great one And upon a letter sent me I gave her my free opinion upon the subject  Vol III P  But had it not been for that I own that in my private mind there could not have been a more suitable match For you are a gallant gentleman graceful in your person easy and genteel in your deportment and in your family fortunes and expectations happy as a man can wish to be Then the knowlege I had of you in Italy altho' give me leave to say your conduct there was not wholly unexceptionable convinces me that you are brave And few gentlemen come up to you in wit and vivacity Your education has given you great advantages your manners are engaging and you have travelled and I know if you'll excuse me you make better observations than you are governed by All these qualifications make it not at all surprising that a young lady should love you And that this love  joined to that indiscreet warmth wherewith my cousin's friends would have forced her inclinations in favour of men who are far your inferiors in the qualities I have named should throw her upon your protection But then if there were these two strong motives the one to  induce  the other to  impel  her let me ask you Sir If she were not doubly intitled to generous usage from a man whom she chose for her protector and whom let me take the liberty to say she could so amply reward for the protection he was to afford her  Lovel  Miss Clarissa Harlowe was intitled Sir to the best usage that man could give her I have no scruple to own it I will always do her the justice she so well deserves I know what will be your inference and have only to say That time past cannot be recalled Perhaps I wish it could  The Colonel then in a very manly strain set forth the wickedness of attempting a woman of virtue and character He said that men had generally too many advantages over the weakness credulity and inexperience of the fair sex who were too apt to be hurried into acts of precipitation by their reading inflaming novels and idle romances that his cousin however he was sure was above the reach of common seduction or to be influenced to the rashness her parents accused her of by weaker motives than  their  violence and the most solemn promises on  my part  But nevertheless  having  those motives and her prudence eminent as it was being rather the effect of  constitution  than  experience  a fine advantage however he said to ground an unblameable future life upon she might not be apprehensive of bad designs in a man she loved It was therefore a very heinous thing to abuse the confidence of such a lady  He was going on in this trite manner But interrupting him I said These general observations Colonel perhaps suit not this particular case But you yourself are a man of gallantry and possibly were you to be put to the question might not be able to vindicate every action of your life any more than I  Col  You are welcome Sir to put what questions you  please to me And I thank God I can both  own  and be  ashamed  of my errors  Lord M looked at  me  but as the Colonel did not by his manner seem to intend a reflexion I had no occasion to take it for one especially as I can as readily  own  my errors as he or any man can his whether  ashamed  of them or not  He proceeded As you seem to call upon me Mr Lovelace I will tell you without boasting of it what has been my general practice till lately that I hope I have reformed it a good deal  I have taken liberties which the Laws of Morality will by no means justify and once I should have thought myself warranted to cut the throat of any young fellow who should make as free with a sister of mine as I have made with the sisters and daughters of others But then I took care never to promise any thing I intended not to perform A modest ear should as soon have heard downright obscenity from my lips as matrimony if I had not intended it Young ladies are generally ready enough to believe we mean honourably if they love us and it would look like a strange affront to their virtue and charms that it should be supposed  needful  to put the question whether in your address you mean a wife But when once a man makes a promise I think it ought to be performed and a woman is well warranted to appeal to every one against the perfidy of a deceiver and is always sure to have the world of her side  Now Sir continued he I believe you have so much honour as to own that you could not have made way to so eminent a virtue without promising marriage and that very explicitly and solemnly  I know very well Colonel interrupted I all you would sayYou will excuse me I am sure that I break in upon you when you find it is to answer the end you drive at  I own to you then that I have acted very unworthily by Miss Clarissa Harlowe and I'll tell you further that I heartily repent of my ingratitude and baseness to her Nay I will say  still  further that I am so grosly culpable  as to her  that even to plead that the abuses and affronts I daily received from her implacable relations were in any  manner a provocation to me to act vilely by her would be a mean and low attempt to excuse myselfSo low and so mean that it would doubly condemn me And if you can say worse speak it  He look'd upon Lord M and then upon me two or three times And my Lord said My kinsman speaks what he thinks I'll answer for him  Lovel  I do Sir and what can I say more And what further in your opinion can be done  Col  Done Sir Why Sir in a haughty tone he spoke I need not tell you that reparation follows repe  tance And I hope you make no scruple of justifying your sincerity as to the one by the other  I hesitated for I relished not the manner of his speech and his haughty accent as undetermined whether to take proper notice of it or not  Col  Let me put this question to you Mr LovelaceIs it true as I have heard it is That you would many my cousin if she would have youWhat say you Sir  This wound me up a peg higher  Lovel  Some questions as they may be put imply  commands  Colonel I would be glad to know how I am to take yours And what is to be the end of your interrogatories  Col  My questions are not meant by me as commands Mr Lovelace The  end  is to prevail upon a gentleman to act  like  a gentleman and a man of honour  Lovel    briskly  And by what arguments Sir do you propose to prevail upon me  Col  By what arguments Sir prevail upon a gentleman to act like a gentlemanI am surprised at That question from Mr Lovelace  Lovel  Why so Sir  Col  WHY so Sir  angrily  Let me  Lovel    interrupting  I don't choose Colonel to be repeated upon in that accent  Lord M  Come come gentlemen I beg of you to be willing to understand one another You young gentlemen are so warm  Col  Not I my LordI am neither very young no  unduly warm Your nephew my Lord can make me be every thing he would have me to be  Lovel  And that shall be whatever you please to be Colonel  Col    fiercely  The choice be yours Mr Lovelace Friend or foe as you do or are willing to do justice to one of the finest women in the world  Lord M  I guess'd from both your characters what would be the case when you met Let me interpose gentlemen and beg you but to understand one another You  both shoot at one mark  and if you are patient will both  hit it  Let me beg of you Colonel to give no challenges  Col  Challenges my LordThey are things I ever was readier to accept than to offer But does your Lordship think that a man so nearly related as I have the honour to be to the most accomplished woman on earth  Lord M    interrupting  We all allow the excellencies of the ladyAnd we shall all take it as the greatest honour to be ally'd to her that can be conferred upon us  Col  So you ought my lordA perfect  Chamont  thought I  See  Otway  's Orphan    Lord M  So we  ought  Colonel And so we  do  And pray let  every one  do as he oughtand no  more  than he  ought  and you Colonel let me tell you will not be so hasty  Lovel    coolly  Come come Col Morden don't let this dispute whatever you intend to make of it go farther than with you and me You deliver yourself in very high terms Higher than ever I was talked to in my life  ut here beneath this roof 'twould be inexcusable for me to take that notice of it which perhaps it would become me to take elsewhere  Col  This is spoken as I wish the man to speak whom should be pleased to call my friend if all his actions  ere of a piece and as I would have the man speak whom I would think it worth my while to call my foe love a man of spirit as I love my soul But Mr Love  ce as my Lord thinks we aim at  one mark  let me say at were we permitted to be alone for six minutes I dare  we should soon understand one another perfectly well And he moved to the door  Lovel  I am intirely of your opinion Sir and will attend you  My Lord rung and stept between us Colonel return I beseech you said he for he had stept out of the room while my Lord held meNephew you shall not go out  The bell and my Lord's raised voice brought in Mowbray and Clements my lord's gentleman the former in his careless way with his hands behind him What's the matter Bobby What's the matter my Lord  Only only only stammer'd the agitated peer these young gentlemen are are are  young  gentlemen that's allPray Colonel Morden who again entered the room with a sedater aspect let this cause have a fair tryal I beseech you  Col  With all my heart my Lord  Mowbray whisper'd me What is the cause BobbyShall I take the gentleman to task for thee my boy  Not for the world whispered I The Colonel is a gentleman and I desire you'll not say one word  Well well well Bobby I have done I can turn thee loose to the best man upon God's earth that's all Bobby strutting off to the other end of the room  Col  I am sorry my Lord I should give your Lordship the least uneasiness I came not with such a design  Lord M  Indeed Colonel I thought you did by your taking fire so quickly I am glad to hear you say you did not How soon a little  spark kindles into a flame  especially when it meets with such combustible spirits  Col  If I had had the least thought of proceeding to extremities I am sure Mr Lovelace would have given me the honour of a meeting where I should have been less an intruder but I came with an amicable intentionTo reconcile differences rather than to widen them  Lovel  Well then Col Morden let us enter upon the subject in your own way I don't know the man I should sooner choose to be upon terms with than one whom Miss Clarissa Harlowe so much respects But I cannot bear to be treated either in word or accent in a menacing way  Lord M  Well well well well gentlemen this is somewhat like  Angry men make to themselves beds of nettles  and when they lie down in them are uneasy with every  body But I hope you are friends Let me hear you say you areI am persuaded Colonel that you don't know all this unhappy story You don't know how desirous my kinsman is as well as all of us to have this matter end happily You don't know do you Colonel that Mr Lovelace at all our requests is disposed to marry the lady  Col At all your requests  my LordI should have hoped that Mr Lovelace was disposed to do justice for the  sake  of justice and when at the same time the doing of justice was doing himself the highest honour  Mowbray lifted up his before halfclosed eyes to the Colonel and glanced them upon me  Lovel  This is in very high language Colonel  Mowbr  By my soul I thought so  Col High  language Mr Lovelace Is it not  just  language  Lovel  It is Colonel And I think the man that does honour to Miss Clarissa Harlowe does me honour But nevertheless there is a manner in speaking that may be liable to exception where the words without that manner can bear none  Col  Your observation in the general is undoubtedly just but  if  you have the value for my cousin that you say you have you must needs think  Lovel  You must allow me Sir to interrupt youIF have the value  I say  I haveI hope Sir when  I say  I  ave  that value there is no room for that  if  pronounced you pronounced it with an emphasis  Col  You have broken in upon me twice Mr Lovelace  am as little accustomed to be broken in upon as you are  be  repeated  upon  Lord M  Two barrels of gunpowder by my con  ence What a devil will it signify talking if thus you  to blow one another up at every wry word  Lovel  No man of honour my Lord will be easy to  e his veracity called in question though but by impli  ion  Col  Had you heard me out Mr Lovelace you would  e found that my  if  was rather an  if  of  inference  than  doubt  But 'tis really a strange liberty gentlemen of  free principles take who at the same time that they would resent unto death the imputation of being capable of telling an untruth to a Man will not scruple to break thro' the most solemn oaths and promises to a Woman I must assure you Mr Lovelace that I always made a conscience of my vows and promises  Lovel  You did right Colonel But let me tell you Sir that you know not the man you talk to if you imagine he is not able to rise to a proper resentment when he sees his generous confessions taken for a mark of basespiritedness  Col    warmly and with a sneer  Far be it from me Mr Lovelace to impute to you the baseness of spirit you speak of for what would that be but to imagine that a man who has done a very flagrant injury is not ready to shew his  bravery  in defending it  Mowbr  This is damn'd severe Colonel It is by Jove I could not take so much at the hands of any man breathing as Mr Lovelace before this took at yours  Col  Who are You Sir What pretence have you to interpose in a cause where there is an acknowleged guilt on one side and the honour of a considerable family wounded in the tenderest part by that guilt on the other  Mowbr    whispering to the Colonel  My dear child you will oblige me highly if you will give me the opportunity of answering your question And was going out  The Colonel was held in by my Lord And I brought in Mowbray  Col  Pray my good Lord let me attend this officious gentleman I beseech you do I will wait upon your Lordship in three minutes depend upon it  Lovel  Mowbray is this acting like a friend by me to suppose me incapable of answering for myself And shall a man of honour and bravery as I know Colonel Morden to be rash as perhaps in this visit he has shewn himself have it to say that he comes to my Lord M's house in a manner naked as to attendants and friends and shall not for That reason be rather borne with than insulted This moment my dear Mowbray leave us You have really no concern in this business and if you are my friend I desire you'll ask the Colonel pardon for interfering in it in the manner you have done  Mowbr  Well well Bob thou shalt be arbiter in this matter I know I have no business in itAnd Colonel  holding out his hand  I leave you to one who knows how to defend his own cause as well as any man in England  Col    taking Mowbray's hand at Lord M's request  You need not tell me  that  Mr Mowbray I have no doubt of Mr Lovelace's ability to defend his own cause were it a cause to be defended And let me tell you Mr Lovelace that I am astonished to think that a brave man and a generous man as you have appeared to be in two or three instances that you have given in the little knowlege I have of you should be capable of acting as you have done by the most excellent of her sex  Lord M  Well but gentlemen now Mr Mowbray is gone and you have both shewn instances of courage and generosity to boot let me desire you to lay your heads together amicably and think whether there be any thing to be done to make all end happily for the lady  Lovel  But hold my Lord let me say one thing now Mowbray  is  gone and that is that I think a gentleman ought not to put up tamely one or two severe things that the Colonel has said  Lord M  What the devil canst thou mean I thought all had been over Why thou hast nothing to do but to confirm to the Colonel that thou art willing to marry Miss Harlowe if she will have thee  Col  Mr Lovelace will not scruple to say  That  I suppose notwithstanding all that has passed But if you think Mr Lovelace I have said any thing I should  not  have said I suppose it is this That the man who has shewn so little of the  Thing  Honour to a defenceless unprotected woman ought not to stand so nicely upon the  empty name  of it with a man who is expostulating with him upon it I am sorry to have cause to say this Mr Lovelace but I would on the same occasion repeat it to a King in all his glory and surrounded by all his guards  Lord M  But what is all this but more  sacks upon the mill  more  coals upon the fire  You have a mind to quarrel both of you I see that Are you not willing Nephew are you not  most  willing to marry this lady if she can be prevailed upon to have you  Lovel  Damn me my Lord if I'd marry an Empress upon such treatment as this  Lord M  Why now Bob thou art more choleric than the Colonel It was  his  turn just now And now you see he is cool you are all gunpowder  Lovel  I own the Colonel has many advantages over me but perhaps there is one advantage he has not if it were put to the tryal  Col  I came not hither as I said before to seek the occasion But if it be offered me I won't refuse itAnd since we find we disturb my good Lord M I'll take my leave and will go home by the way of St Alban's  Lovel  I'll see you part of the way with all my heart Colonel  Col  I accept your civility very chearfully Mr Lovelace  Lord M    interposing again as we were both for going out  And what will this do gentlemen Suppose you kill one another will the matter be better'd or worsted by that Will the lady be made happier or unhappier do you think by either or both of your deaths Your characters are too well known to make fresh instances of the courage of either needful And I think if the honour of the lady is your view Colonel it can be no other way so effectually promoted as by marriage And Sir if  you  would use your interest with her it is very probable that  you  may succeed tho' no body else can  Lovel  I think my Lord I have said all that a man can say since what is passed cannot be recalled and you see Col Morden rises in proportion to my coolness till it is necessary for me to assert myself or even  he  would despise me  Lord M  Let me ask you Colonel Have you any way any method that you think reasonable and honourable to propose to bring about a reconciliation with the lady That is what we all wish for And I can tell you Sir it is not a little owing to her family and to their implacable usage of her that her resentments are heighten'd against my kinsman who however has used her vilely but is willing to repair her wrongs  Lovel  Not my Lord for the sake of her family nor for this gentleman's haughty behaviour but for  her own sake  and in full sense of the wrongs I have done her  Col  As to my haughty behaviour as you call it Sir I am mistaken if you would not have gone beyond it in the like case of a relation so meritorious and so unworthily injured And Sir let me tell you that if your motives are not Love Honour and Justice and if they have the least tincture of mean Compassion for  her  or of an unchearful assent on  your part  I am sure it will neither be desired or accepted by a person of my cousin's merit and sense nor shall I wish that it should  Lovel  Don't think Colonel that I am meanly compounding off a debate that I should as willingly go thro' with you as to eat or drink if I have the occasion given me for it But thus much I will tell you That my Lord that Lady Sarah Sadleir Lady Betty Lawrance my two cousins Montague and myself have written to her in the most solemn and sincere manner to offer her such terms as no one but herself would refuse and this long enough before Col Morden's arrival was dreamt of  Col  What reason Sir may I ask does she give against listening to so powerful a mediation and to such offers  Lovel  It looks like capitulating or else  Col  It looks not like any such thing to  me  Mr Lovelace who have as good an opinion of your spirit as man can have And what pray is the part I act and my motives for it Are they not in desiring that justice may be done to my cousin Clarissa Harlowe that I seek to establish the honour of  Mrs Lovelace  if matters can once be brought to bear  Lovel  Were she to honour me with her acceptance of That name Mr Morden I should not want you or any man to assert the honour of Mrs Lovelace  Col  I believe it But till she  has  honoured you with that acceptance she is nearer to me than to you Mr Lovelace And I speak this only to shew you that in the part I take I mean rather to deserve your thanks than your displeasure tho' against  yourself  were there occasion Nor ought you to take it amiss if you rightly weigh the matter For Sir whom does a lady want protection against but  her injurers And who has been her  greatest  injurerTill therefore she becomes intitled to your protection as  your wife  you yourself cannot refuse me some merit in wishing to have justice done  my cousin  But Sir you was going to say that if it were not to look like capitulating you would hint the reasons my cousin gives against accepting such an honourable mediation  I then told him of my sincere offers of marriage  'I made no difficulty I said to own my apprehensions that my unhappy behaviour to her had greatly affected her But that it was the implacableness of her friends that had thrown her into despair and given her a contempt for life'  I told him  'That she had been so good as to send me a letter to divert me from a visit my heart was set upon making her A letter on which I built great hopes because she assured me in it that she was  going to her father's  and that  I might see her there when she was received if it were not my own fault  '  Col  Is it possible And were you Sir thus earnest And did she send you such a letter  Lord M confirmed both and also that in obedience to her desires and that intimation I had come down without the satisfaction I had proposed to myself in seeing her  It is very true Colonel said I And I should have told you This before But your heat made me decline it for as I said it had an appearance of meanly capitulating with you An abjectness of heart of which had I been capable I should have despised  myself  as much as I might have expected  you  would despise me  Lord M proposed to enter into the proof of all this He said in his phraseological way  That one story was good till another was heard  That the Harlowe family and I 'twas true had behaved like so many  Orsons  to one another and that they had been very free with all our family besides That nevertheless for the lady's sake more than for theirs or even for  mine  he could tell me he would do greater things for me than they could ask if she could be brought to have me And that this he  wanted  to declare and would  sooner  have declared if he could have brought us sooner to patience and a good understanding  The Colonel made excuses for his warmth on the score of his affection to his cousin  My regard for her made me readily admit them And so a fresh bottle of Burgundy and another of Champagne being put upon the table we sat down in good humour after all this blustering in order to enter closer into the particulars of the case Which I undertook at both their desires to do  But these things must be the subject of another letter which shall immediately follow this if it do not accompany it  Mean time you will observe That a bad cause gives a man great disadvantages For I myself think that the interrogatories put to me with so much spirit by the Colonel made me look cursedly mean at the same time that it gave him a superiority which I know not how to allow to the best man in Europe So that literally speaking as a  good man  would infer guilt is its own punisher in that it makes the most lofty spirit look like the miscreant he isA  good man  I say So Jack  proleptically  I add  Thou  hast no right to make the observation  LETTER XXIV Mr  LOVELACE  In Continuation  Tuesday Afternoon Aug    I Went back in this part of our conversation to the day that I was obliged to come down to attend my Lord in the dangerous illness which some feared would have been his last  I told the Colonel  'What earnest letters I had written to a particular friend to engage him to prevail upon the lady not to slip a day that had been proposed for the private celebration of our nuptials and of my letters  See Vol V p  written to herself on that subject'  for I had stept to my closet and fetched down all the letters and draughts and copies of letters relating to this affair  I read to him  'several passages in the copies of those letters which thou wilt remember make not a little to my honour And I told him 'That I wished I had  kept copies of those to my friend on the same occasion by which he would have seen how much in earnest I was in my professions to her altho' she would not answer one of them'  And thou mayst remember that one of those four letters accounted to herself why I was desirous she should remain where I had left her  See Vol V p    I then proceeded to give him an account  'of the visit made by Lady Sarah and Lady Betty to Lord M and me in order to induce me to do her justice Of my readiness to comply with their desires and of their high opinion of her merit Of the visit made to Miss Howe by my cousins Montague in the name of us all to ingage her interest with her friend in my behalf Of my conversation with Miss Howe at a private assemblee to whom I gave the same assurances and besought her interest with her friend'  I then read the copy of the letter tho' so much to my disadvantage which was written to her by Miss Charlotte Montague Aug  See Vol VI p  intreating her alliance in the names of all our family  This made him ready to think that his fair cousin carried her resentment against me too far He did not imagine he said that either myself or our family had been so much in earnest  So thou seest Belford that it is but glossing over  one  part of a story and omitting  another  that will make a bad cause a good one at any time What an admirable Lawyer should I have made And what a poor hand would this charming creature with all her innocence have made of it in a court of justice against a man who had so much to  say  and to  shew  for himself  I then hinted at the generous annual tender which Lord M and his sisters made to his fair cousin in apprehension that she might suffer by her friends implacableness  And this also the Colonel highly applauded and was pleased to lament the unhappy misunderstanding between the two families which had made the Harlowes less fond of an alliance with a family of so much honour as this instance shewed ours to be  I then told him  'That having by my friend meaning thee who was admitted into her presence and who had always been an admirer of her virtues and had given me such advice from time to time in relation to her as I wished I had followed been assured that a visit from me would be very disagreeable to her I once more resolved to try what a letter would do and that accordingly on the th of August I wrote her one  'This Colonel is the copy of it I was then out of humour with my Lord M and the Ladies of my family You will therefore read it to yourself  See Vol VI p  '  This letter gave him high satisfaction You write here Mr Lovelace from your heart 'Tis a letter full of penitence and acknowlegement Your request is reasonableTo be forgiven only as you shall appear to deserve it after a time of probation which you leave to her to six Pray Sir did she return an answer to this letter  She did but with  reluctance  I own and not till I had declared by my friend that if I could not procure one I would go up to town and throw myself at her feet  I wish I might be permitted to see it Sir or to hear such parts of it read as you shall think proper  Turning over my papers Here it is Sir  See Vol VI p  I will make no scruple to put it into your hands  This is very obliging Mr Lovelace  He read it My charming cousinHow strong her resentmentsYet how charitable her wishes Good God that such an excellent creatureBut Mr Lovelace it is to your regret as much as to mine I doubt not  Interrupting him I swore that it was  So it ought said he Nor do I wonder that it should be so I shall tell you byandby proceeded he how much she suffers with her friends by false and villainous reports But Sir will you permit me to take with me these two letters I shall make use of them to the advantage of you both  I told him I would oblige him with all my heart And this he took very kindly as he had reason and put them in his pocketbook promising to return them in a few days  I then told him  'That upon this refusal I took upon  myself to go to town in hopes to move her in my favour and that tho' I went without giving her notice of my intention yet had she got some notion of my coming and so contrived to be out of the way And at last when she found I was fully determined at all events to see her before I went abroad' which I shall do said I if I cannot prevail upon her 'she sent me the letter I have already mentioned to you desiring me to suspend my purposed visit And that for a reason which amazes and confounds me because I don't find there is any thing in it And yet I never knew her once dispense with her word for she always made it a maxim that  it was not lawful to do evil that good might come of it  And yet in this letter for no reason in the world but to avoid seeing me to gratify a humour only has she sent me out of town depending upon the assurance she had given me'  Col  This is indeed surprising But I cannot believe that my cousin for such an end  only  or indeed for  any  end according to the character I hear of her should stoop to make use of such an artifice  Lovel  This Colonel is the thing that astonishes me and yet see hereThis is the letter she wrote meNay Sir 'tis her own hand  Col  I see it is and a charming hand it is  Lovel  You observe Colonel that all her hopes of reconciliation with her parents are from you You are her  dear blessed friend  She always talked of you with delight  Col  Would to heaven I had come to England before she left HarlowePlace Nothing of this had then happened Not a man of those whom I have heard that her friends proposed for her should have had her Nor you Mr Lovelace unless I had found you to be the man every one who sees you must wish you to be And if you  had  been that man no one living should I have preferred to you for such an excellence  My Lord and I both joined in the wish And 'faith I wished it most cordially  The Colonel read the letter twice over and then returned it to me 'Tis all a mystery said he I can make  nothing of it For alas her friends are as averse to a reconciliation as ever  Lord M  I could not have thought it But don't you think there is something very favourable to my nephew in this letterSomething that looks as if the lady would comply at last  Col  Let me die if I know what to make of it This letter is very different from her preceding oneYou returned an answer to it Mr Lovelace  Lovel  An answer Colonel No doubt of it And an answer full of transport I told her  'I would directly set out for Lord M's in obedience to her will I told her that I would consent to any thing she should command in order to promote this happy reconciliation I told her that it should be my hourly study to the end of my life to deserve a goodness so transcendent'  But I cannot forbear saying that I am not a little shocked and surprised if nothing more be meant by it than to get me into the country without seeing her  Col  That can't be the thing depend upon it Sir There must be more in it than That For were that all she must think you would soon be undeceived and that you would then most probably resume your intentionUnless indeed she depended upon seeing  me  in the interim as she knew I was arrived But I own I know not what to make of it Only that she does me a great deal of honour if it be me that she calls her  blessed friend whom she always loved and honoured  Indeed I ever loved her And if I die unmarried and without children shall be as kind to her as her grandfather was And the rather as I fear that there is too much of envy and selflove in the resentments her brother and sister endeavour to keep up in her father and mother against her But I shall know better how to judge of This when my cousin James comes from Edinburgh and he is every hour expected  But let me ask you Mr Lovelace What is the name of your friend who is admitted so easily into my cousin's presence Is it not Belford pray  Lovel  It is Sir a man of honour and a great admirer of your fair cousin  Was I right as to the  first  Jack The  last  I have  such strong proof of that it makes me question the  first  since she would not have been out of the way of my intended visit but for thee  Col  Are you sure Sir that Mr Belford is a man of honour  Lovel  I can swear for him Colonel What makes you put this question  Col  Only this That an officious pragmatical novice has been sent up to inquire into my cousin's life and conversation And would you believe it the frequent visits of this gentleman have been interpreted basely to her disreputationRead that letter Mr Lovelace and you will be shocked at every part of it  This cursed letter no doubt is from the young Levite whom thou Jack describedst as making inquiry of Mrs Smith about Miss Harlowe's character and visiters  Vol VI p    I believe I was a quarter of an hour in reading it For I made it tho' not a short one six times as long as it is by the additions of oaths and curses to every pedantic line Lord M too helped to lengthen it by the like execrations And thou Jack wilt have as much reason to curse it as we  You cannot but see said the Colonel when I had done reading it that this fellow has been  officious  in his malevolence for what he says is mere hearsay and that hearsay conjectural scandal without fact or the appearance of fact to support it so that an unprejudiced eye upon the face of the letter would condemn the writer of it as I did and acquit my cousin But yet such is the spirit by which the rest of my relations are governed that they run away with the belief of the worst it insinuates and the dear creature has had shocking letters upon it the pedant's hints are taken and a voyage to one of the colonies has been proposed to her as the only way to avoid Mr Belford and you I have not seen these letters indeed but they took a pride in repeating some of their contents which must have cut the poor soul to the heart and these joined to her former sufferingsWhat have you not Mr Lovelace to answer for  Lovel  Who the devil could have expected such consequences as these Who could have believed there could  be parents so implacable Brother and sister so envious And give me leave to say a lady so immoveably fixed against the only means that could be taken to put all right with every bodyAnd what now can be done  Lord M  I have great hopes that Col Morden may yet prevail upon his cousin And by her last letter it runs in my mind that she has some thoughts of forgiving all that's past Do you think Colonel if there should  not  be such a thing as a reconciliation going forward at present that her letter may not imply that if we  could  bring such a thing to bear with her friends she would be reconciled to Mr Lovelace  Col  Such an artifice would better become the Italian subtlety than the English simplicity Your Lordship has been in Italy I presume  Lovel  My Lord has read Boccacio perhaps and that's as well as to the hint he gives which may be borrowed from one of that author's stories But Miss Clarissa Harlowe is above all artifice She must have some meaning I cannot fathom  Col  Well my Lord I can only say That I will make some use of the letters Mr Lovelace has obliged me with And after I have had some talk with my cousin James who is hourly expected and when I have dispatched two or three affairs that press upon me I will pay my respects to my dear cousin and shall then be able to form a better judgment of things Mean time I will write to her for I have sent to inquire about her and find she wants consolation  Lovel  If you favour me Colonel with the damned letter of that fellow Brand for a day or two you will oblige me  Col  I will But remember the man is a parson Mr Lovelace an innocent one too they say Else I had been at him before now And these college novices who think they know every thing in their cloysters and that all learning lies in  books  make dismal figures when they come into the world among  men  and  women    Lord M Brand Brand  It should have been  Firebrand  I think in my conscience  Thus ended this doughty conference  I cannot say Jack but I am greatly taken with Col Morden He is brave and generous and knows the world and then his contempt of the parsons is a certain sign that he is one of  Us    We parted with great civility Lord M not a little pleased that we did and as greatly taken with the Colonel repeated his wish after the Colonel was gone that he had arrived in time to save the lady if that would have done it  I wish so too For by my soul Jack I am every day more and more uneasy about her But I hope she is not so ill as I am told she is  I inclose this  FireBrand  's letter as my Lord calls him I reckon it will rouze all thy phlegm into vengeance  I know not what to advise as to shewing it to the lady Yet perhaps she will be able to reap more satisfaction than concern from it knowing her own innocence in that it will give her to hope that her friends treatment of her is owing as much to misrepresentation as to their own natural implacableness Such a mind as her's I know would be glad to find out the shadow of a reason for the shocking letters the Colonel says they have sent her and for their proposal to her of going to some one of the colonies Confound them allBut if I begin to curse I shall never have doneThen it may put her upon such a defence as she might be glad of an opportunity to make and to shame them for their monstrous credulityBut this I leave to thy own fatheaded prudenceOnly it vexes me to the heart that even scandal and calumny should dare to surmise the bare possibility of any man's sharing the favours of a lady whom now methinks I could worship with a veneration due only to a divinity  Charlotte and her sister could not help weeping at the base aspersion When when said Patty lifting up her hands will this sweet lady's sufferings be at an endOh cousin Lovelace  And thus am I blamed for every one's faultsWhen her brutal father curses her it is I I upbraid her with her severe mother Her stupid uncle's implacableness is all mine Her brother's virulence and her sister's spite and envy are intirely owing to me This rascal Brand's letter is of my writingO Jack what a wretch is thy Lovelace  RETURNED without a letterThis damned fellow Will is returned without a letter Yet the rascal tells me that he hears you have been writing to me these two days  Plague confound thee who must know my impatience and the reason for it  To send a man and horse on purpose as I did My imagination chained to the belly of the beast in order to keep pace with him Now he is got to this place Now to that Now to London Now to thee  Now a letter given him whip and spur upon the return This town just entered not staying to bait That village passed by Leaves the wind behind him in a foaming sweat man and horse  And in this way did he actually enter Lord M's courtyard  The reverberating pavement brought me downThe letter Will The letter dogThe letter Sirrah  No letter SirThen wildly staring round me fists clenched and grinning like a maniac Confound thee for a dog and him that sent thee without oneThis moment out of my sight or I'll scatter thy stupid brains thro' the air snatching from his holsters a pistol while the rascal threw himself from the foaming beast and run to avoid the fate which I wished with all my soul thou hadst been within the reach of me to have met with  But to be as meek as a lamb to one who has me at his mercy and can wring and torture my soul as he pleases  What canst thou mean  to send back my varlet without a letterI will send away by daydawn another fellow upon another beast for what thou hast written and I charge thee on thy allegiance that thou dispatch him not back emptyhanded  LETTER XXV Mr  BRAND  To  JOHN HARLOWE  Esq  Inclosed in the preceding  Worthy Sir my very good Friend and Patron  I Arrived in town yesterday after a tolerable pleasant journey considering the hot weather and dusty roads  I put up at the Bull and Gate in Holborn and hastened to Coventgarden I soon found the house where the unhappy lady lodges And in the backshop had a good deal of discourse  Vol VI p  with Mrs Smith her landlady whom I found to be so  highly prepossessed  in her  favour  that I saw it would not answer your desires to take my informations  altogether  from her and being obliged to attend my patron who to my sorrow  Miserum est aliena vivere quadra  I find wants much waiting upon and is  another  sort of man than he was at college For Sir  inter nos honours change manners  For the  aforesaid causes  I thought it would best answer all the ends of the commission you honoured me with to engage in the desired scrutiny the wife of a  particular friend  who lives almost over against the house where she lodges and who is a gentlewoman of  character  and  sobriety  a  mother of children  and one who  knows  the  world  well  To her I applied myself therefore and gave her a short history of the case and desired she would very particularly enquire into the  conduct  of the unhappy young lady her  present way of life  and  subsistence  her  visiters  her  imployments  and suchlike for these Sir you know are the things whereof you wished to be informed  Accordingly Sir I waited upon the gentlewoman aforesaid this day and to  my  very great trouble because I know it will be to  yours  and likewise to all your worthy family's I must say that I do find things look a little more  darkly  than I hoped they would For alas Sir the gentlewoman's report turns not out so  favourable  for Miss's reputation as  I  wished as  you  wished and as  every one  of her friends wished But so it is throughout the world that  one false step  generally brings on  another  and peradventure  a worse  and  a still worse  till the poor  limed soul  a very fit epithet of the divine Quarles's is quite  entangled  and without infinite  mercy  lost for ever  It seems Sir she is notwithstanding in a very  ill state of health  In this both gentlewomen that is to say Mrs Smith her landlady and my friend's wife agree Yet she goes often out in a chair to  prayers  as it is said But  my friend's wife tells me that nothing is more common in London than that the frequenting of the church at morning prayers is made the  pretence  and  cover  for  private assignations  What a sad thing is this that what was designed for  wholsome nourishment  to the  poor soul  should be turned into  rank poison  But as Mr Daniel de Foe an ingenious man tho' a  dissenter  observes But indeed it is an old proverb only I think he was the first that put it into verse  God never had a house of pray'r  But Satan had a chapel there  Yet to do the lady  justice  nobody comes home with her Nor indeed  can  they because she goes forward and backward in a  sedan  or  chair  as they call it But then there is a gentleman of  no good character  an  intimado  of Mr Lovelace's who is a  constant  visiter of her and of the people of the house whom he  regales  and  treats  and has of consequence their  high good words    I have hereupon taken the trouble for I love to be  exact  in any  commission  I undertake to inquire  particularly  about this  gentleman  as he is called albeit I hold no man so but by his actions For as Juvenal says  Nobilitas sola est atque unica virtus  And this I did  before  I would sit down to write to you  His name is Belford He has a paternal estate of upwards of pounds by the year and is now in mourning for an uncle who left him very considerably besides He bears a very profligate character as to  women  for I enquired  particularly  about  That  and is Mr Lovelace's more especial  privado  with whom he holds a  regular correspondence  and has been often seen with Miss tête à tête at the  window  In no  bad way  indeed But my friend's wife is of opinion that all is not  as it should be  And indeed it is mighty strange to me if Miss be so  notable a penitent  as is represented and if she have such an  aversion  to Mr Lovelace that she will admit his  privado  into  her retirements  and see  no other company    I understand from Mrs Smith that Mr Hickman was to see her some time ago from Miss Howe and I am told by  another  hand You see Sir how diligent I have been to execute the  commissions  you had given me that he  had no  extraordinary opinion  of this Belford at first tho' they were seen together one morning by the opposite neighbour at  breakfast with Miss  And another time this Belford was observed to  watch  Mr Hickman's coming from her so that as it should seem he was mighty zealous to  ingratiate  himself with Mr Hickman no doubt to engage him to make a  favourable report to Miss Howe  of the  intimacy  he was admitted into by her unhappy friend who  as she is very ill  may  mean no harm  in allowing his visits for he it seems brought to her or recommended at least the doctor and apothecary that attend her But I think upon the whole it  looketh not well    I am sorry Sir I cannot give you a better account of the young lady's  prudence  But what shall we say  Uvaque conspectâ livorem ducit ab uvâ  as Juvenal observes  One thing I am afraid of which is That Miss may be under  necessities  and that this Belford who as Mrs Smith owns has  offered her money  which she  at the time  refused may find an opportunity to  take advantage  of those  necessities  And it is well observed by the poet that  Aegrè formosam poteris servare puellam  Nunc proce nunc auro forma petita ruit  And this Belford who is a  bold man  and has as they say the  look  of one may make good that of Horace with whose writings you are so well acquainted nobody better  Audax omnia perpeti  Gens humana ruit per vetitum nefas  Forgive me Sir for what I am going to write But if you could prevail upon the rest of your family to join in the scheme which  you  and her  virtuous sister  Miss Arabella and the archdeacon and I once talked of which is to persuade the unhappy young lady to go in some  creditable  manner to some one of the foreign colonies it might save not only her  own credit  and  reputation  but the  reputation  and  credit  of all her  family  and a great deal of  vexation  moreover For it is my humble opinion that you will hardly any of you injoy yourselves while this  once  innocent young lady is in the way of being so frequently heard of by you And this would put her  out of the way  both of  this Belford  and of  that Lovelace  and it might peradventure prevent as much  evil  as  scandal    You will forgive me Sir for this my  plainness  Ovid pleads for me  Adulator nullus amicus erit  And I have no view but that of approving myself a  zealous wellwisher  to  all  your worthy family whereto I owe a great number of obligations and very particularly Sir  Your obliged and humble Servant  ELIAS BRAND  Wedn Aug    P S  I shall give you  further hints  when I come down which will be in a few days and who my  informants  were but by  these  you will see that I have been very assiduous for the time in the task you set me upon  The  length  of my letter you will excuse for I need not tell you Sir what  narrative complex  and  conversation  letters such a one as  mine  require Every one to his  talent Letterwriting  is mine I will be bold to say and that my  correspondence  was much coveted at the University on that account But this I should not have taken upon me to mention only in defence of the  length  of my letter for nobody writes  shorter  or  pithier  when the subject is upon  common forms  onlyBut in apologizing for my  prolixity  I am  adding  to the  fault  if it were one which however I cannot think it to be the  subject  considered But this I have said before in other words So Sir if you will excuse my  postcript  I am sure you will not find fault with my  letter    I think I have nothing to add until I have the honour of attending you in  person  but that I am as above c c c  E B  LETTER XXVI Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Wednesday night Aug    IT was lucky enough that our two servants met at Hannah's  The windmill near Slough  which gave them so good an opportunity of exchanging their letters time enough for each to return to his master early in the day  Thou dost well to brag of thy capacity for managing servants and to set up for correcting our poets in their characters of this class of people  See Letter V of this Vol p  when like a mad man thou canst beat their teeth out and attempt to shoot them thro' the head for not bringing to thee what they had no power to obtain  You well observe  See p  that you would have made a thoroughpac'd Lawyer The whole of the conversationpiece between you and the Colonel affords a convincing proof that there is a black and a white side to every cause But what must the conscience of a partial whitener of his  own  cause or blackener of  another's  tell him while he is throwing dust in the eyes of his judges and all the time knows his own guilt  The Colonel I see is far from being a faultless man But while he sought not to carry his point by breach of faith he has an excuse which thou hast not But withrespect to him and to us all I can now with detestation of some of my own actions see that the taking advantage of another person's good opinion of us to injure perhaps to ruin that other is the most ungenerous wickedness that can be committed  Man  acting thus by  man  we should not be at a loss to give such actions a name But is it not doubly and trebly aggravated when such advantage is taken of an inexperienced and innocent young creature whom we pretend to love above all the women in the world and when we seal our pretences by the most solemn vows and protestations of inviolable honour that we can invent  I see that this gentleman is the best match thou ever couldest have had upon all accounts His spirit such another impetuous one as thy own soon taking fire vindictive and only differing in This that the cause he ingages in is a just one But commend me to honest brutal Mowbray who before he knew the cause offers his sword in thy behalf against a man who had taken the injured side and whom he had never seen before  As soon as I had run thro' your letters and that incendiary Brand's by the latter of which I saw to what cause a great deal of this last implacableness of the Harlowe family is owing I took coach to Smith's altho' I had been come from thence but about an hour and had taken leave of the lady for the night  I sent down for Mrs Lovick and desired her in the first place to acquaint the lady who was busied in her closet that I had letters from Berks In which I was informed  that the interview between Col Morden and Mr Lovelace had ended without ill consequences that the Colonel intended to write to her very soon and was interesting himself mean while in her favour with her relations that I hoped that this agreeable news would be a means of giving her good rest and I would wait upon her in the morning by the time she should return from prayers with all the particulars  She sent me word that she should be glad to see me in the morning and was highly obliged to me for the good news I had sent her up  I then in the backshop read to Mrs Lovick and to Mrs Smith Brand's letter and asked them If they could guess at the man's informant They were not at a loss Mrs Smith having seen the same fellow Brand who had talked with her as I mentioned in a former  Vol VI p  come out of a milliner's shop overagainst them which milliner she said had also been lately very inquisitive about the lady  I wanted no further hint but bidding them take no notice to the lady of what I had read I shot over the way and asking for the mistress of the house she came to me  Retiring with her at her invitation into her parlour I desired to know if she was acquainted with a young country clergyman of the name of Brand She hesitatingly seeing me in some emotion owned that she had some small knowlege of the gentleman Just then came in her husband who is it seems a petty officer in the excise and not an illbehaved man who owned a fuller knowlege of him  I have the copy of a letter said I from this Brand in which he has taken great liberties with my character and with That of the most unblameable lady in the world which he grounds upon informations that you Madam have given him And then I read to them several passages in his letter and asked What foundation she had for giving that fellow such impressions of either of us  They knew not what to answer But at last said that he had told them how wickedly the young lady had run away from her parents What worthy and rich people they were In what favour  he  stood with them and that they had imployed him to inquire after her behaviour visiters c  They said That indeed they knew very little of the young lady but that Curse upon their censoriousness it was but too natural to think that where a lady had given way to a delusion and taken so wrong a step she would not stop there That the most sacred places and things were but too often made a cloak for bad actions That Mr Brand had been informed perhaps by some enemy of mine that I was a man of very free principles and an  intimado  as he calls it of the man who had ruined her And that their cousin Barker a mantuamaker who lodged up one pair of stairs had often from her window seen me with the lady in her chamber talking very earnestly together And that Mr Brand being unable to account for her admitting my visits and knowing I was but a new acquaintance of hers and an old one of Mr Lovelace's thought himself obliged to lay these matters before her friends  This was the sum and substance of their tale O how I cursed the censoriousness of this plaguy triumvirate A parson a milliner and a mantuamaker The two latter not more by  business  led to adorn the person than generally by  scandal  to destroy the  reputations  of those they have a mind to exercise their talents upon  The two women took great pains to persuade me that they were people of conscienceOf consequence I told them too much addicted I doubted to censure other people who pretended not to their strictness for that I had ever found censoriousness narrowness and uncharitableness to prevail too much with those who affected to be thought more pious than their neighbours  That was not them they said and that they had since inquired into the lady's character and manner of life and were very much concerned to think any thing they had said should be made use of against her And as they heard from Mrs Smith that she was not likely to live long they should be sorry she should go out of the world a sufferer by their means or with an ill opinion of them tho' strangers to her The husband offered to write if I pleased to Mr Brand in vindication of the lady and the two women said they should be glad to wait upon her in person to beg her pardon for any thing she had reason to  take amiss from them because they were now convinced that there was not such another young lady in the world  I told them That the least said of the affair to the lady in her present circumstances was best That she was fond of taking all occasions to find excuses for her relations on their implacableness to her That therefore I should take some notice to her of the uncharitable and weak surmizes which gave birth to so vile a scandal But that I would have him Mr Walton for that is the husband's name write to his acquaintance Brand as soon as possible as he had offeredAnd so I left them  LETTER XXVII Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Thursday    o'Clock Aug    I AM just come from the lady whom I left chearful and serene  She thanked me for my communication of the preceding night I read to her such parts of your letters as I  could  read to her and I thought it was a good test to distinguish the froth and whiptsyllabub in them from the cream in what one  could  and could  not  read to a woman of so fine a mind since four parts out of six of thy letters which I thought entertaining as I read them to myself appeared to me when I would have read them to her most abominable stuff and gave me a very contemptible idea of thy talents and of my own judgment  She was far from rejoicing as I had done at the disappointment her letter gave you when explained  She said she meant only an innocent allegory that might carry instruction and warning to you when the meaning was taken as well as answer her own hopes for the time It was run off in a hurry She was afraid it was not quite  ight in  her  But hoped the end would excuse if it could not justify the means And then she again expressed a good deal of apprehension lest you should still take it into your head to molest her when her time she says is so  hort that she wants every moment of it repeating what  he had once said before That when she wrote she was  o ill that she believed she should not have lived till now  If she had thought she should she must have thought of an expedient that would have better answered her intentions hinting at a removal out of the knowlege of us both  But she was much pleased that the conference between you and Colonel Morden ended so amicably after two or three such violent sallies as I acquainted her you had had between you and said she must absolutely depend upon the promise I had given her to use my utmost endeavours to prevent further mischief on her account  She was pleased with the justice you did her character to her cousin  She was glad to hear that he had so kind an opinion of her and that he would write to her  I was under an unnecessary concern how to break to her that I had the copy of Brand's vile letter  Unnecessary  I say for she took it just as you thought she would as an excuse she wished to have for the implacableness of her friends and begg'd I would let her read it herself for said she the contents cannot disturb me be they what they will  I gave it her and she read it to herself a tear nowandthen ready to start and a sigh sometimes interposing  She gave me back the letter with great and surprising calmness considering the subject  There was a time said she and that not long since when such a letter as this would have greatly pained me But I hope I have now got above all these things for I can refer to your kind offices and Miss Howe's the justice that will be done to my memory among my friends There is a good and a bad light in which every thing that befals us may be taken If the human mind will busy itself to make the worst of every disagreeable occurrence it will never want woe This letter affecting as the subject of it is to my reputation gives me more pleasure than pain because I can gather from it that had not my friends been prepossessed by misinformed or rash and officious persons who are always at hand to flatter or sooth the passions of the affluent they could not have been so immoveably determined against me But now they are sufficiently cleared from every imputation of unforgiveness for while I appeared to them in the character of a vile hypocrite pretending  to true penitence yet giving up myself to profligate courses how could I expect either their pardon or blessing  But Madam said I you'll see by the date of this letter August that their severity  previous  to that cannot be excused by it  It imports me much replied she on account of my present wishes as to the office you are so kind to undertake that you should not think harshly of my friends I must own to you that I have been apt sometimes myself to think them not only severe but cruel Suffering minds will be partial to their own cause and merits Knowing their own hearts if sincere they are apt to murmur when harshly treated But if they are not  believed  to be innocent by persons who have a right to decide upon their conduct according to their own judgments how can it be helped Besides Sir How do you know that there are not about my friends as wellmeaning misrepresenters as Mr Brand really seems to be But be this as it will there is no doubt that there are and have been multitudes of persons as innocent as myself who have suffered upon surmises as little probable as those on which Mr Brand founds his judgment Your intimacy Sir with Mr Lovelace and may I say a character which it seems you have been less sollicitous formerly about justifying than perhaps you will be for the future and your frequent visits to me may well be thought to be questionable circumstances in my conduct  I could only admire her in silence  But you see Sir proceeded she how necessary it is for young people of our sex to be careful of our company And how much at the same time it behoves young gentlemen to be chary of their own reputation were it only for the sake of such of ours as they may mean honourably by and who otherwise may suffer in their good names for being seen in their company  As to Mr Brand continued she he is to be pitied and let me injoin you Mr Belford not to take up any resentments against him which may be detrimental either to his person or his fortunes Let his function and his good meaning plead for him He will have concern enough  when he finds every body whose displeasure I now labour under acquitting my memory of perverse guilt and joining in a general pity for me  This Lovelace is the lady whose life thou hast curtailed in the blossom of itHow many opportunities must thou have had of admiring her inestimable worth yet couldst have thy senses so much absorbed in the WOMAN in her charming person as to be blind to the ANGEL that shines out in such full glory in her mind Indeed I have ever thought myself when blest with her conversation in the company of a real angel And I am sure it would be impossible for me were she to be as beautiful and as crimsoned over with health as I have seen her to have the least thought of Sex when I heard her talk  Thursday three o'clock Aug    ON my revisit to the lady I found her almost as much a sufferer from joy as she had sometimes been from grief For she had just received a very kind letter from her cousin Morden which she was so good as to communicate to me As she had already begun to answer it I begg'd leave to attend her in the evening that I might not interrupt her in it  The letter is a very tender one * * * *  Here Mr Belford gives the substance of it upon his memory See the next letter And then adds  But alas all will be now too late For the decree is certainly gone out The world is unworthy of her  LETTER XXVIII Colonel  MORDEN  To Miss  CL HARLOWE    Tuesday Aug    My dear Cousin  PERMIT me to condole those misfortunes which have occasioned so unhappy a difference between you and the rest of your family And to offer my assistance to enable you to make the best of what has happened  You have fallen into most unworthy hands The letter I wrote to you from Florence  See Vol III p  I find came too late to have its hopedfor effect I am very sorry it did As I am that I did not come sooner to England in person  But forgetting past things let us look forward I have been with Mr Lovelace and Lord M I need not tell  you  it seems how desirous all the family are of the honour of an alliance with you nor how exceedingly earnest the former is to make you all the reparation in his power  I think my dear cousin that you cannot now do better than to give him the honour of your hand He says such just and great things of your virtue and so heartily condemns himself that I think there is great and honourable room for your forgiving him And the more as it seems you are determined against a legal prosecution  Your effectual forgiveness of him it is evident to me will accelerate a general reconciliation For at present my other cousins cannot persuade themselves that he is in earnest to do you justice or that you would refuse him if you believed he was  But my dear cousin there may possibly be something in this affair to which I may be a stranger If there be and you will acquaint me with it all that a  naturally  warm heart can do in your behalf shall be done  Nothing but my endeavour to serve you here has hitherto prevented me from assuring you of this by word of mouth For I long to see you after so many years absence I hope I shall be able in my next visits to my several cousins to set all right Proud spirits when convinced that they have carried resentments too high want but a good excuse to condescend And parents must  always  love the child they  once  loved  Mean while I beg the favour of a few lines to know if you have reason to doubt Mr Lovelace's sincerity For my part I can have none if I am to judge from the conversation that passed yesterday between him and me in presence of Lord M  You will be pleased to direct for me at your uncle Antony's  Permit me my dearest cousin till I can procure a happy reconciliation between you and your father and brother and uncles to supply the place to you of all those near relations as well as that of  Your affectionate Kinsman and humble Servant  WM MORDEN  LETTER XXIX Miss  CL HARLOWE  To  WM MORDEN  Esq  Thursday Aug    I MOST heartily congratulate you dear Sir on your return to your native country  I heard with much pleasure that you were come but I was both afraid and ashamed till you encouraged me by a first notice to address myself to you  How consoling is it to my wounded heart to find that you have not been carried away by that tide of resentment and displeasure with which I have been so unhappily overwhelmedBut that while my still nearer relations have not thought fit to examine into the truth of vile reports raised against me you have informed yourself and generously  credited  the information that my error was owing more to my misfortune than my fault  I have not the least reason to doubt Mr Lovelace's sincerity in his offers of marriage Nor that all his relations are heartily desirous of ranking me among them I have had noble instances of their esteem for me on their apprehending that my father's displeasure must have subjected me to difficulties And this after I had absolutely refused  their  pressing solicitations in their kinsman's favour as well as  his own    Nor think me my dear cousin blameable for refusing him I had given Mr Lovelace no reason to think me a weak creature If I  had  a man of his character might have thought himself warranted to endeavour to make ungenerous advantage of the weakness he had been able to inspire The consciousness of  my own  weakness in that case might have brought me to a composition with  his  wickedness  I can indeed forgive him But that is because I think his crimes have set me above him Can I be above the man Sir to whom I shall give my hand and my vows and with them a sanction to the most premeditated baseness No Sir let me say that your cousin Clarissa were she likely to live many years and  that  if she married not this man in penury and want despised and forsaken by all her friends puts not so high a value upon the conveniencies of  life nor upon life itself as to seek to reobtain the one or to preserve the other by giving  such  a sanction A sanction which  were she to perform her duty  would reward the violater  Nor is it so much from Pride as from Principle that I say this What Sir when Virtue when Chastity is the crown of a woman and particularly of a Wife shall your cousin stoop to marry the man who could not form an attempt upon  hers  but upon a presumption that she was capable of receiving his offered hand when he had found himself mistaken in the vile opinion he had conceived of her Hitherto he has not had reason to think me weak Nor will I give him an instance so flagrant that weak I am in a point in which it would be criminal to be  found  weak  One day Sir you will perhaps know all my story But whenever it is known I beg that the author of my calamities may not be vindictively sought after He could not have been the author of them but for a strange concurrence of unhappy causes As the Law will not be able to reach him when I am gone any other sort of vengeance terrifies me but to think of it For in such a case should my friends be  safe  what honour would his death bring to my memory If any of them should come to misfortune how would my fault be aggravated  God long preserve you my dearest cousin and bless you but in  proportion  to the consolation you have given me in letting me know that you still love me and that I have One near and dear relation who can pity and forgive me and then will you be  greatly  blessed is the prayer of  Your evergrateful and affectionate  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER XXX Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  In answer to bis letters of  August    Thursday Aug    I Cannot but own that I am cut to the heart by  this  Miss Harlowe's interpretation of her letter She ought never to be forgiven  She  a meek person and a penitent and innocent and pious and I know not what who can deceive with a foot in the grave  'Tis evident that she sat down to write this letter with a design to mislead and deceive And if she be capable of That at such a crisis she has as much need of  God  's forgiveness as I have of  hers  And with all her cant of  Charity  and  Charity  if she be not more sure of it than I am of her  real pardon  and if she take the thing in the light she ought to take it in she will have a few darker moments yet to come than she seems to expect  Lord M himself who is not one of those to speak in his own phrase  who can penetrate a millstone  sees the deceit and thinks it unworthy of her tho' my cousins Montague vindicate her And no wonder This cursed partial sex I hate 'em allby my soul I hate 'em all will never allow anything against an individual of it where ours is concerned And why Because if they censure deceit in another they must condemn their own hearts  She is to send me a letter after she is in heaven is she The devil take such  allegories  and the devil take thee for calling this absurdity an  innocent  artifice  I insist upon it that if a woman of her character at such a critical time is to be justified in such a deception a man in full health and vigour of body and mind as I am may be excused for all his stratagems and attempts against her And thank my stars I can now sit me down with a quiet conscience on that score By my soul I can Jack Nor has anybody who can acquit  her  a right to blame  me  But with some indeed everything  she  does must be good everything  I  do must be badAnd why Because she has always taken care to coax the stupid misjudging world like a  woman  While I have constantly defied and despised its censures like a  man    But notwithstanding all you may let her know from me that I will  not  molest her since my visits would be so shocking to her And I hope she will take this into her consideration as a piece of generosity that she could har  ly expect after the deception she has put upon me And let her further know that if there be anything in my power that will contribute either to her ease or honour I will obey her at the very first intimation however disgraceful or detrimental to myself All this to make her unapprehensive and that she may have nothing to pull her back  If her cursed relations could be brought as chearfully to perform  their  parts I'd answer life for life for her recovery  But who that has so many ludicrous images raised in his mind by thy aukward penitence can forbear laughing at thee Spare I beseech thee dear Belford for the future all thy own aspirations if thou wouldst not dishonour those of an angel indeed  When I came to that passage where thou sayst that thou considerest her  See p    as one sent from heaven to draw thee after herfor the heart of me I could not for an hour put thee out of my head in the attitude of Dame Elizabeth Carteret on her monument in WestminsterAbbey If thou never observedst it go thither on purpose and there wilt thou see this dame in effigie with uplifted head and hand the latter taken hold of by a Cupid every inch of stone one clumsy foot lifted up also aiming as the sculptor designed it to ascend but so executed as would rather make one imagine that the figure without shoe or stocken as it is tho' the rest of the body is robed was looking up to its corncutter The other riveted to its native earth bemired like thee  immersed  thou callest it beyond the possibility of unsticking itself Both figures thou wilt find seem to be in a contention the bigger whether it should pull down the lesser about its earsthe lesser a chubby fat little varlet of a fourth part of the other's bigness with wings not much larger than those of a butterfly whether it should raise the larger to a heaven it points to hardly big enough to contain the great toes of either  Thou wilt say perhaps that the dame's figure in  stone  may do credit in the comparison to thine both in grain and shape  wooden  as thou art all over But that the lady who in everything but in the trick she has played me so lately is truly an angel is but sorrily represented by the fat flank'd Cupid This I allow thee But yet there is enough in thy aspirations to strike my mind with a resemblance of thee and the lady to the figures on the wretched monument for thou oughtest to remember that prepared as she may be to mount to her native skies it is impossible for her to draw after her a heavy fellow who has so much to repent of and amend  But now to be serious once more let me tell you Belford that if the lady be really so ill as you write she is it will become you  No Roman style here  in a case so very affecting to be a little less pointed and sarcastic in your reflections For upon my soul the matter begins to grate me most confoundedly  I am now so impatient to hear oftener of her that I take the hint accidentally given me by our two fellows meeting at Slough and resolve to go to our friend Doleman's at Uxbridge whose wife and sister as well as he have so frequently pressed me to give them my company for a week or two There shall I be within two hours ride if anything should happen to induce her to see me For it will well become her piety and avowed charity should the worst happen The Lord of heaven and earth however avert that worst to give me that pardon from her  lips  which she has not denied me by  pen and ink  And as she wishes my reformation she knows not what good effects such an interview may have upon me  I shall accordingly be at Doleman's to morrow morning by eleven at furthest My fellow will find me there at his return from you with a letter I hope I shall have Joel with me likewise that I may send the oftener as matters fall out Were I to be  still nearer  or in town it would be impossible to withhold myself from seeing her  But if the worst happenas by your continual knelling I know not what to think of itYet once more Heaven avert that worstHow natural is it to pray when one cannot help one's selfTHEN say not in so many dreadful words what the event isOnly that you advise me to take a trip to Paris And that will stab me to the heart  I SO well approve of your generosity to poor Belton's sister that I have made Mowbray give up his legacy as I do mine towards her India Bonds When I come to town Tourville shall do the like and we will buy each a ring to wear in memory of the honest fellow with our own money that we may perform  his  will as well as our  own    My fellow rides the rest of the night I charge you Jack if you would save his life that you send him not back emptyhanded  LETTER XXXI Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Thursday night Aug    WHEN I concluded my last I hoped that my next attendance upon this surprising lady would furnish me with some particulars as agreeable as now could be hoped for from the declining way she is in by reason of the welcome letter she had received from her cousin Morden But it proved quite otherwise to  me  tho' not to  herself  for I think I never was more shocked in my life than on the occasion I shall mention presently  When I attended her about seven in the evening she told me that she had found herself since I went in a very petulant way Strange she said that the pleasure she had received from her cousin's letter should have had such an effect upon her But she had given way to a  comparative  humour as she might call it and thought it very hard that her nearer relations had not taken the methods with her which her cousin Morden had begun with by inquiring into her merit or demerit and giving her cause a fair audit before condemnation  She had hardly said this when she started and a blush overspread her face on hearing as I also did a sort of lumbering noise upon the stairs as if a large trunk were bringing up between two people And looking upon me with an eye of concern Blunderers said she they have brought in something two hours before the timeDon't be surprised Sir It is all to save  you  trouble  Before I could speak in came Mrs Smith O Madam said she What have you doneMrs Lovick entering made the same exclamation Lord have mercy upon me Madam cry'd I what have you doneFor she stepping at the instant to the door the women told me it was a coffinO Lovelace that thou hadst been there at the momentThou the causer of all these shocking scenes Surely thou couldst not have been less affected than I who have no guilt as to  her  to answer for  With an intrepidity of a piece with the preparation having directed them to carry it into her bedchamber she  returned to us They were not to have brought it in till after dark said shePray excuse me Mr Belford And don't you Mrs Lovick be concerned Nor you Mrs Smith Why should you There is nothing more in it than the unusualness of the thing Why may we not be as reasonably shocked at going to the church where are the monuments of our ancestors with whose dust we even  hope  our dust shall be one day mingled as to be moved at such a sight as this  We all remaining silent the women having their aprons at their eyesWhy this concern for nothing at all said sheIf I am to be blamed for anything it is for shewing too much solicitude as it may be thought for this earthly part I love to do everything for myself that I can do I ever did Every other material point is so far done and taken care of that I have had  leisure  for things of lesser moment Minutenesses may be observed where greater articles are not neglected for them I might have had this to order perhaps when less fit to order it I have no mother no sister no Mrs Norton no Miss Howe near me Some of you must have seen  this  in a few days if not now perhaps have had the friendly trouble of directing it And what is the difference of a few days to  you  when  I  am gratified rather than discomposed by itI shall not die the sooner for such a preparationShould not everybody make their will that has anything to bequeath And who that makes a will should be afraid of a coffinMy dear friends to the women I have considered these things do not give me reason to think  you  have not with such an object before you as you have had in  me  for weeks  How reasonable was all thisIt shewed indeed that she herself had well considered of it But yet we could not help being shocked at the thoughts of the coffin thus brought in The lovely person before our eyes who is in all likelihood so soon to fill it  We were all silent still the women in grief I in a manner stunned She would not ask  me  she said but would be glad since it had thus earlier than she had intended been brought in that her two good friends would walk in and look upon it They would be less shocked when it was  made more familiar to their eye than while their thoughts ran large upon it Don't you lead back said she a starting steed to the object he is apt to start at in order to familiarize him to it and cure his starting The same reason will hold in this case Come my good friends I will lead you in  I took my leave telling her she had done wrong very wrong and ought not by any means to have such an object before her  The women followed her in'Tis a strange Sex Nothing is too shocking for them to look upon or see acted that has but Novelty and Curiosity in it  Down I posted got a chair and was carried home extremely shocked and discomposed Yet weighing the lady's arguments I know not why I was so affectedexcept as she said at the unusualness of the thing  While I waited for a chair Mrs Smith came down and told me that there were devices and inscriptions upon the lid Lord bless me Is a coffin a proper subject to display fancy uponBut these great minds cannot avoid doing extraordinary things  LETTER XXXII Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Friday Morn Sept    IT is surprising that I a  man  should be so much affected as I was at such an object as is the subject of my former letter who also in my late uncle's case and poor Belton's had the like before me and the directing of it When she a  woman  of so weak and tender a frame who was to fill it so soon perhaps to fill it could give orders about it and draw out the devices upon it and explain them with so little concern as the women tell me she did to them last night after I was gone  I really was ill and restless all night Thou wert the subject of my execration as she of my admiration all the time I was quite awake And when I dozed I dreamt of nothing but of flying hourglasses deaths heads spades mattocks and Eternity the hint of her devices as given me by Mrs Smith running in my head  However not being able to keep away from Smith's I went thither about seven The lady was just gone out She had slept better I found than I tho' her solemn repository was under her window not far from her bedside  I was prevailed upon by Mrs Smith and her nurse Shelburne Mrs Lovick being abroad with her to go up and look at the devices Mrs Lovick has since shewn me a copy of the draught by which all was ordered And I will give thee a sketch of the symbols  The principal device neatly etched on a plate of white metal is a crowned serpent with its tail in its mouth forming a ring the emblem of Eternity and in the circle made by it is this inscription  CLARISSA HARLOWE  APRIL X  Then the year  AETAT XIX  For ornaments At top an hourglass winged At bottom an urn  Under the hourglass on another plate this inscription  HERE  the wicked cease from troubling And  HERE  the weary be at rest  Job iii  Over the urn near the bottom  Turn again unto thy rest O my soul For the Lord hath rewarded thee And why Thou hast delivered my soul from death mine eyes from tears and my feet from falling  Ps cxvi  Over this text is the head of a white lily snapt short off and just falling from the stalk and this inscription over that between the principal plate and the lily  The days of man are but as grass For he flourisheth as a flower of the field For as soon as the wind goeth over it it is gone and the place thereof shall know it no more  Ps ciii  She excused herself to the women on the score of her youth and being used to draw for her needleworks for having shewn more fancy than would perhaps be thought suitable on so solemn an occasion  The date April she accounted for as not being able  to tell what her closingday would be and as That was the fatal day of her leaving her father's house  She discharged the undertaker's bill after I was gone with as much chearfulness as she could ever have paid for the cloaths she sold to purchase this her  palace  For such the called it reflecting upon herself for the expensiveness of it saying That they might observe in  her  that pride left not poor mortals to the last But indeed she did not know but her father would permit it when furnished to be carried down to be deposited with her ancestors and in that case she ought not to discredit them in her  last appearance    It is covered with fine black cloth and lined with white satten soon she said to be tarnished by viler earth than any it could be covered by  The burialdress was brought home with it The women had curiosity enough I suppose to see her open That if she did open itAnd perhaps thou wouldst have been glad to have been present to have admired it too  Mrs Lovick said she took the liberty to blame her and wished the removal of such an objectfrom her  bedchamber  at least And was so affected with the noble answer she made upon it that she entered it down the moment she left her  To persons in health said she this sight may be shocking and the preparation and my unconcernedness in it may appear affected But to me who have had so gradual a weaningtime from the world and so much reason not to love it I must say I dwell on I indulge and strictly speaking I enjoy the thoughts of death For believe me looking stedfastly at the awful receptacle Believe what at this instant I feel to be most true That there is such a vast superiority of weight and importance in the thought of death and its hoped for happy consequences that it in a manner annihilates all other considerations and concerns Believe me my good friends it does what nothing else can do It teaches me by strengthening in me the force of the divinest example to forgive the injuries I have received and shuts out the remembrance of past evils from my soul  And now let me ask thee Lovelace Dost thou think that when the time shall come that thou shalt be obliged to launch into the boundless ocean of Eternity thou wilt be able any more than poor Belton was to act thy part with such true heroism as this sweet and tender blossom of a woman has manifested and continues to manifest  O no it cannot beAnd why cannot it beThe reason is evident She has no wilful errors to look back upon with selfreproachand her mind is strengthened by the consolations which flow from that religious rectitude which has been the guide of all her actions and which has taught her rather to choose to be a sufferer than an aggressor  This was the support of the divine Socrates as thou hast read When led to execution his wife lamenting that he should suffer being innocent Thou fool said he wouldst thou wish me to be guilty  LETTER XXXIII Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Friday Sept    HOW astonishing in the midst of such affecting scenes is thy mirth on what thou callest my  own aspirations  Never surely was there such another man in this world thy talents and thy levity taken togetherSurely what I shall send thee with this will affect thee If not nothing can till  thy own hour  comeAnd heavy will then thy reflections be  I am glad however that thou enablest me to assure the lady that thou wilt no more molest her that is to say in other words That after having ruined her fortunes and all her worldly prospects thou wilt be so gracious as to let her lie down and die in peace  Thy giving up to poor Belton's sister the little legacy and thy undertaking to make Mowbray and Tourville follow thy example is I must say to thy honour of a piece with thy generosity to thy Rosebud and her Johnny and to a number of other good actions in pecuniary matters altho' thy Rosebud's is I believe the only instance where a pretty woman was concerned of such a disinterested bounty  Upon my faith Lovelace I love to praise thee and often and often as thou knowest have I  studied  for occasions to do it Insomuch that when for the life of me I could not think of anything done by thee that deserved it I have taken pains to applaud the not ungraceful manner in which thou hast performed actions that merited the gallows  Now thou art so near I will dispatch my servant to thee if occasion requires But I fear I shall soon give thee the news thou apprehendest For I am just now sent for by Mrs Smith who has ordered the messenger to tell me that she knew not if the lady will be alive when I come  Friday Sept    two o' clock  at  Smith  's    I COULD not close my letter in such an uncertainty as must have added to your impatience For you have on several occasions convinced me that the suspense you love to  give  would be the greatest torment to you that you could  receive  A common case with all aggressive and violent spirits I believe I will just mention then your servant waiting here till I have written that the lady has had two very severe fits In the last of which whilst she lay they sent to the doctor and Mr Goddard who both advised that a messenger should be dispatched for me as her executor being doubtful whether if she had a third it would not carry her off  She was tolerably recovered by the time I came and the doctor made her promise before me that she would not attempt any more while so weak to go abroad for by Mrs Lovick's description who attended her the shortness of her breath her extreme weakness and the fervor of her devotions when at church were contraries which pulling different ways the soul aspiring the body sinking  ore her tender frame in pieces  So much for the present I shall detain Will no longer than just to beg that you will send me back this pacquet and the last Your memory is so good that once reading is all you ever give or need to give to anything And who but ourselves can make out our characters were you inclined to let anybody see what passes between us If I  cannot be obliged I shall be tempted to withhold what I write till I have time to take a copy of it  It may not be amiss to observe that Mr Belford's solicitude to get back his letters was owing to his desire of fulfilling the lady's wishes that he would furnish Miss Howe with materials to vindicate her memory    A letter from Miss Howe is just now brought by a particular messenger who says he must carry back a few lines in return But as the lady is just retired to lie down the man is to call again byandby  LETTER XXXIV Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Uxbridge  Sept    twelve o' clock at night    I Send you the papers with this You must account to me honestly and fairly when I see you for the earnestness with which you write for them And then also will we talk about the contents of your last dispatch and about some of your severe and unfriendly reflections  Mean time whatever thou dost don't let the wonderful creature leave us Set before her the sin of her preparation as if she thought she could depart when she pleased She'll persuade herself at this rate that she has nothing to do when all is ready but to lie down and go to sleep And such a lively fancy as hers will make a reality of a jest at any time  A  jest  I call all that has passed between her and me a mere jest to die forFor has she not from first to last infinitely more triumphed over me than suffered from me  Would the sacred regard I have for her purity even for her  personal  as well as  intellectual  purity permit I could prove this as clear as the sun Therefore tell the dear creature she must not be wicked in her piety There is a  too much  as well as a  too little  even in righteousness Perhaps she does not think of thatO that she would have permitted my attendance as obligingly as she does of thineThe dear soul used to love humour I remember the time that she knew how to smile at a piece of apropos humour And let me tell thee a smile upon the lips must have had its correspondent chearfulnesses in a heart so sincere as hers  Tell the doctor I will make over all my possessions and all my reversions to him if he will but prolong her life for one twelvemonth to come But for one twelvemonth JackHe will lose all his reputation with me and I shall treat him as Belton did his doctor if he cannot do this for me on so young a subject But  Nineteen  Belford  Nineteen  cannot so soon die of grief if the doctor deserve that name and so blooming and so fine a constitution as she had but three or four months ago  But what need the doctor have asked her leave to write to her friends Could he not have done it without letting her know anything of the matter That was one of the likeliest means that could be thought of to bring some of them about her since she is so desirous to see them At least it would have induced them to send up her favourite Norton But these plaguy solemn fellows are great traders in parade And for the hearts of them cannot get out of it be the occasion what it will They'll cram down your throat their poisonous drugs by wholesale without asking you a question and have the assurance to  own  it to be  prescribing  But when they are to do good they are to ask your consent  How the dear creature's character rises in every line of thy lettersBut it is owing to the uncommon occasions she has met with that she blazes out upon us with such a meridian lustreHow but for those occasions could her noble sentiments her prudent consideration her forgiving spirit her exalted benevolence and her equanimity in view of the most shocking prospects which set her in a light so superior to all her sex and even to the philosophers of antiquity have been manifested  I know thou wilt think I am going to claim some merit to myself for having given her such opportunities of signalizing her virtues But I am not for if I did I must share that merit with her implacable relations who would justly be intitled to  two thirds  of it at least And my soul disdains a partnership in anything with such a family  But this I mention as an answer to thy reproaches that I could be so little edified by perfections to which thou supposest I was for so long together daily and hourly a personal witnessWhen admirable as she was in all she  said and in all she did occasion had not at that time ripened and called forth those amazing perfections which now astonish and confound me  Hence it is that I admire her more than ever I did and that my love for her is less  personal  as I may say more  intellectual  than ever I thought it could be to woman  Hence also it is that I am confident would it please the Fates to spare her and make her mine I could love her with a purity that would draw on  my own  FUTURE as well as insure  her  TEMPORAL happinessAnd hence by necessary consequence shall I be the most miserable of all men if I am deprived of her  Thou severely reflectest upon me for my levity in the Abbey instance And I will be ingenuous enough to own that as thou seest not my heart there may be passages in every one of my letters which the melancholy occasion considered deserve thy most pointed rebukes But faith Jack thou art such a tragicomical mortal with thy leaden aspirations at one time and thy flying hourglasses and dreaming terrors at another that as Prior says  What serious is thou turn'st to farce  and it is impossible to keep within the bounds of decorum or gravity when one reads what thou writest  But to restrain myself for my constitutional gaiety was ready to run away with me again I will repeat I must ever repeat that I am most egregiously affected with the circumstances of the case And were this paragon actually to quit the world should never enjoy myself one hour together tho' I were to live to the age of Methusalem  Indeed it is to this  deep concern  that my very  levity  is owing For I struggle and struggle and try to buffet down these reflections as they rise and when I cannot do it I am forced as I have often said to try to make myself laugh that I may not cry for one or other I must do And is it not philosophy carried to the highest pitch for a man to conquer such tumults of soul as I am sometimes agitated by and in the very height of the storm to be able to quaver out an horselaugh  Your Seneca's your Epictetus's and the rest of your stoical tribe with all their apathynonsense could not  come up to this They could  forbear  wry faces Bodily pains they could well enough  seem  to support and that was all But the pangs of their own smittendown souls they could not  laugh  over tho' they could at the follies of others They read grave lectures but they  were  grave This high point of philosophy to laugh and be merry in the midst of the most soulharrowing woes when the heartstrings are just bursting asunder was reserved for thy Lovelace  There is something owing to constitution I own and that this is the laughingtime of my life For what a woe must that be which for an hour together can mortify a man of six or seven and twenty in high blood and spirits of a naturally gay disposition who can sing dance and scribble and take and give delight in them allBut then my grief as my joy is sharperpointed than most other mens and like what Dolly Welby once told me describing the parturient throes if there were not lucid intervalsif they did not come and gothere would be no bearing them  AFTER all as I am so little distant from the dear creature and as she is so very ill I think I cannot excuse myself from making her  one  visit Nevertheless if I thought her so nearWhat word shall I use that my soul is not shocked at and that she would be  too much discomposed  by a visit I would not think of itYet how can I bear the recollection that when she last went from me her innocence so triumphant over my premeditated guilt as was enough to reconcile her to life and to set her above the sense of injuries so nobly sustained that she should then depart with an incurable fracture in her heart and that  that  should be the last time I should ever see herHow how can I bear this reflection  O Jack how my conscience that gives edge even to  hy blunt reflections tears meEven this moment would I give the world to push the cruel reproacher from me by one gay interventionSick of myselfSick of the remembrance of my vile plots and of my  light  my  mom  n  ary  ecstasy Villainous burglar felon thief that I was which has brought upon me such  durable  and such  heavy  remorse what would I give that I had not been guilty of such barbarous and ungrateful perfidy to the most excellent of God's creatures  I would end methinks with one sprightlier linebut it will not beLet me tell thee then and rejoice at it if thou wilt that I am  Inexpressibly miserable  LETTER XXXV Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Sat morning Sept    I HAVE some little pleasure given me by thine just now brought me I see now that thou hast a little humanity left Would to heaven for the dear lady's sake as well as for thy own that thou hadst romaged it up from all the dark forgotten corners of thy soul a little sooner  The lady is alive and serene and calm and has all her noble intellects clear and strong But Nineteen will not however save her She says she will now content herself with her closetduties and the visits of the parishminister and will not attempt to go out Nor indeed will she I am afraid ever walk up or down a pair of stairs again  I am sorry at my soul to have this to say But it would be a folly to flatter thee  As to thy seeing her I believe the least hint of that sort now would cut off some hours of her life  What has contributed to her serenity it seems is That taking the alarm her fits gave her she has intirely finished and signed and sealed her last will Which she had deferred doing till this time in hopes as she said of some good news from HarlowePlace which would have occasioned the alteration of some passages in it  Miss Howe's letter was not given her till four in the afternoon yesterday at what time the messenger returned for an answer She admitted him to her presence in the diningroom ill as she then was and would have written a few lines as desired by Miss Howe but not being able to hold a pen she bid the messenger tell her that she hoped to be well enough to write a long letter by the next day's post and would not now detain him  Saturday six in the Afternoon  I CALLED just now and found the lady writing to Miss Howe She made me a melancholy compliment that she shewed me not Miss Howe's letter because I should soon have that and all her papers before me But she told me that Miss Howe had very considerately obviated to Colonel Morden several things which might have occasioned misapprehensions between him and me and had likewise put a lighter construction for the sake of peace on some of your actions than they deserved  She added That her cousin Morden was warmly engaged in her favour with her friends And one good piece of news Miss Howe's letter contained that her father would give up some matters which appertaining to her of right would make my executorship the easier in some particulars that had given her a little pain  She owned she had been obliged to leave off in the letter she was writing thro' weakness  Will says he shall reach you tonight I shall send in the morning and if I find her not worse will ride to Edgware and return in the afternoon  LETTER XXXVI Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Tuesday Aug    My dearest Friend  I Am at length returned to this place and had intended to wait on you in London But my mamma is very illAlas my dear she is very ill indeedAnd you are likewise very illI see  that  by yours of the thWhat shall I do if I lose two such near and dear and tender friends She was taken ill yesterday at our last stage in our return homeAnd has a violent surfeit and fever and the doctors are doubtful about her  If she should die how will all my pertnesses to her fly in my faceWhy why did I ever vex herShe says I have been all duty and obedienceShe kindly forgets all my faults and remembers everything I have been so happy as to oblige her in And this cuts me to the heart  I see I see my dear you are very badAnd I cannot bear it Do my beloved Miss Harlowe if you  can  be  better do for  my  sake  be  better and send me word of it Let the bearer bring me a line Be sure you send me a line If I lose you my more than sister and lose my mamma I shall distrust my own conduct and will not marry And why should ICreeping cringing in courtshipO my dear these men are a vile race of  Reptil  s  in  our day  and mere  Bears  in  their own  See in Lovelace all that was desirable in figure in birth and in fortune But in his heart a devilSee in HickmanIndeed my dear I cannot tell what anybody can see in Hickman to be always preaching in his favour And is it to be expected that I who could hardly bear controul from a mother should take it from a husbandFrom one too who has neither more wit nor more understanding than myself Yet He to be my instructorSo he will I suppose but more by the insolence of his will than by the merit of his counsel It is in vain to think of itI cannot be a wife to any man breathing whom I at present knowThis I the rather mention now because on my mother's danger I know you will be for pressing me the sooner to throw myself into another sort of protection should I be deprived of her But no more of this subject or indeed of any other for I am obliged to attend my mamma who cannot bear me out of her sight  Wednesday Aug    MY mother Heaven be praised has had a fine night and is much better Her fever has yielded to medicine And now I can write once more with freedom and ease to you in hopes that  you  also are better If this be granted to my prayers I shall again be happy I write with still the more alacrity as I have an opportunity given me to touch upon a subject in which you are nearly concerned  You must know then my dear that your cousin Morden has been here with me He told me of an interview he had on Monday at Lord M's with Lovelace and asked me abundance of questions about you and about that villainous man  I could have raised a fine flame between them if I would But observing that he is a man of very lively passions and believing you would be miserable if anything should happen to him from a quarrel with a man who  is known to have so many advantages at his sword I made not the worst of the subjects we talked of But as I could not tell untruths in his favour you must think I said enough to make him curse the wretch  I don't find well as they all used to respect Colonel Morden that he has influence enough upon them to bring them to any terms of reconciliation  What can they mean by itBut your brother is come home it seems So The honour of the houseThe reputation of the family is all the cry  The Colonel is exceedingly out of humour with them all Yet has he not hitherto it seems seen your brutal brotherI told him how ill you were and communicated to him some of the contents of your letter He admired  you  cursed  Lovelace  and raved against all your  family  He declared that they were all unworthy of you  At his earnest request I permitted him to take some brief notes of such of the contents of your letter to me as I thought I  could  read to him and particularly of your melancholy conclusion  See p      He says That none of your friends think you so ill as you are nor will believe itHe is sure they all love you and that dearly too  If they do their present hardness of heart will be the subject of everlasting remorse to them should you be taken from usBut now it seems barbarous wretches you are to  suffer within an inch of your life    He asked me questions about Mr Belford And when he had heard what I had to say of that gentleman and his disinterested services to you he raved at some villainous surmises thrown out against you by that officious pedant Brand Who but for his gown I find would come off poorly enough between your cousin and Lovelace  He was so uneasy about you himself that on Thursday the th he sentup an honest serious man  See p    one Alston a gentleman farmer to inquire of your condition your visiters c who brought him word that you was very ill and was put to great streights to support yourself But as this was told him by the gentlewoman of the house where you lodge who it seems mingled with it some tart  tho' deserved reflections upon your relations cruelty it was not credited by them And I myself hope it cannot be true for surely you could not be so  unjust  I will say to my friendship as to suffer any inconveniencies for want of money I think I could not forgive you if it were so  The Colonel as one of your trustees is resolved to see you put into possession of your estate And in the mean time he has actually engaged them to remit to him for you the produce of it accrued since your grandfather's death a very considerable sum and proposes himself to attend you with it But by a hint he dropt I find you had disappointed some people's littleness by not writing to them for money and supplies since they were determined to distress you and to put you at defiance  Like all the restI hope I may say that without offence  Your cousin imagines that before a reconciliation takes place they will insist that you shall make such a will as to that estate as they shall approve of But he declares he will not go out of England till he has seen justice done you by  everybody  and that you shall not be imposed on either by friend or foe  By  relation  or foe should he not have saidFor a friend will not impose upon a friend  So my dear you are to  buy your peace  if some people were to have their wills  Your cousin not  I  my dear tho' it was always my opinion  See Vol  i  p    says that the whole family is  too rich  to be either  humble considerate  or  contented  And as for himself he has an ample fortune he says and thinks of leaving it wholly to you  Had this villain Lovelace consulted his worldly interest only what a fortune would he have had in you even altho' your marrying him had deprived you of your paternal share  I am obliged to leave off here But having a good deal still to write and my mother better I will pursue the subject in another letter altho' I send both together I need not say how much I am and will ever be  Your affectionate c  ANNA HOWE  LETTER XXXVII Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Thursday Aug    THE Colonel thought fit once to speak it to the praise of Lovelace's  generosity  that  as a man of honour ought  he took to himself all the blame and acquitted you of the consequences of the precipitate step you had taken since he said as you loved him and was in his power he  must  have had advantages which he would  not  have had if you had continued at your father's or at any friend's  Mighty generous  I said were it as he supposed in such insolent reflecters the best of them who pretend to  clear  reputations which never had been  sullied  but by falling into their dirty acquaintance But in this case I added that there was no need of anything but the strictest truth to demonstrate Lovelace to be the blackest of villains You the brightest of innocents  This he catch'd at and swore that could he find that there were anything uncommon or barbarous in the seduction as one of your letters had indeed seemed to imply That is to say my dear anything  worse  than perjury breach of faith and abuse of a generous confidenceSorry fellows he would avenge his cousin to the utmost  I urged your apprehensions on this he  d from your last letter to me But he seemed capable of taking what I know to be real greatness of soul in an unworthy sense For he mentioned directly upon it the expectation your friends had that you should previous to any reconciliation with them appear in a court of justice against the villainIF you could do it with the advantage to yourself that I hinted might be done  And truly if I would have heard him he had indelicacy enough to have gone into the nature of the proof of the crime upon which they wanted to have Lovelace arraigned Yet this is a gentleman improved by travel and learningUpon my word my dear I who have been accustomed to the most delicate conversation ever since I  had the honour to know you despise this Sex from the gentleman to the peasant  Upon the whole I find that Mr Morden has a very slender notion of womens virtue in particular cases For which reason I put him down tho' your favourite as one who is not intitled  to cast the first stone    I never knew a man who deserved to be well thought of himself for his morals who had a slight opinion of the virtue of our Sex in general For if from the  difference  of  temperament  and  education  modesty chastity and piety too and these from  principle  are not to be found in our Sex preferably to the other I should think it a sign of a much worse nature in  ours    He even hinted as from your relations indeed that it is impossible but there must be some  will  where there is much  love  These sort of reflections are enough to make a woman who has at heart her own honour and the honour of her Sex to look about her and consider what she is doing when she enters into an intimacy with these wretches since it is plain that whenever she throws herself into the power of a man and leaves for him her parents or guardians everybody will believe it to be owing more to her good luck than to her discretion if there be not an end of her virtue And let the man be ever such a villain to her she must take into her own bosom a share of his guilty baseness  I am writing to general cases You my dear are out of the question Your story as I have heretofore said will afford a warning as well as an example  Vol  IV  p    For who is it that will not infer That if a person of your fortune character and merit could not escape ruin after she had put herself into the power of her  hyaena  what can a thoughtless fond giddy creature expect  Every man they will say is not a LOVELACETrue But then neither is every woman a CLARISSAAnd allow for the one and the other the example must be of general use  I prepared this gentleman to expect your appointment of Mr Belford for an office that we both hope he will have no occasion to act in nor anybody else for many very many years to come He was at first startled at it  But upon hearing your reasons which had satisfied me he only said That such an appointment were it to take place would exceedingly affect his other cousins  He told me he had a copy of Lovelace's letter to you imploring your pardon and offering to undergo any penance to procure it  See Vol  vi  p    and also of your answer to it  See Vol  vi  p      I find he is willing to hope that a marriage between you may still take place which he says will heal up all breaches  I would have written much moreOn the following particulars especially to wit Of the wretched man's hunting you out of your lodgings Of your relations strange  implacableness  I am in haste and cannot think of a word you would like better  just now  Of your last letter to Lovelace to divert him from pursuing you Of your aunt Hervey's penitential conversation with Mrs Norton Of Mr Wyerley's renewed address Of your lessons in Hickman's behalf so approveable were the man more so than he is But indeed I am offended with him at this instant and have been these two daysOf your sister's transportationprojectAnd of twenty and twenty other thingsBut am obliged to leave off to attend my two cousins Spilsworth and my cousin Herbert who are come to visit us on account of my mother's illnessI will therefore dispatch these by Rogers and if my mother gets well soon as I hope she will I am resolved to see you in town and tell you everything that now is upon my mind and particularly mingling my soul with yours how much I am and will ever be my dearest dear friend  Your affectionate  ANNA HOWE  Let Rogers bring one line I pray you I thought to have sent him this afternoon but he cannot set out till tomorrow morning early  I cannot express how much your staggering lines and your conclusion affect me  LETTER XXXVIII Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Sunday Evening Sept    I Wonder not at the impatience your servant tells me you express to hear from me I was designing to write you a long letter and was just returned from Smith's for that purpose but since you are so urgent you must be contented with a short one  I attended the lady this morning just before I set out for Edgware She was so ill overnight that she was obliged to leave her letter to Miss Howe unfinished But early this morning she made an end of it and had just sealed it up as I came She was so fatigued with writing that she told me she would lie down after I was gone and endeavour to recruit her spirits  They had sent for Mr Goddard when she was so ill last night and not being able to see him out of her own chamber he for the first time saw her  house  as she calls it He was extremely shocked and concerned at it and chid Mrs Smith and Mrs Lovick for not persuading her to have such an object removed from her bedchamber And when they excused themselves on the  little authority  it was reasonable to suppose they must have with a lady so much their superior he reflected warmly on those who had  more  authority and who left her to proceed in such a shocking and solemn whimsy as he called it  It is placed near the window like a harpsichord tho' covered over to the ground And when she is so ill that she cannot well go to her closet she writes and reads upon it as others would upon a desk or table But only as she was so ill last night she chooses not to see anybody in that apartment  I went to Edgware and returning in the evening attended her again She had a letter brought her from Mrs Norton a long one as it seems by its bulk just before I came But she had not opened it and said That as she was pretty calm and composed she was afraid to look into the contents lest she should be ruffled expecting now to hear of nothing that could do her good or give her  pleasure from that good woman's  dear hardhearted neighbours  as she called her own relations  Seeing her so weak and ill I withdrew nor did she desire me to tarry as sometimes she does when I make a motion to depart  By Mrs Smith I had some hints as I went away that she had appropriated that evening to some offices that were to save trouble as she called it after her departure and had been giving her nurse and Mrs Lovick and Mrs Smith orders about what she would have done when she  was gone  and I believe they were of a very delicate and affecting nature but Mrs Smith descended not to particulars  The Doctor had been with her as well as Mr Goddard and they both joined with great earnestness to persuade her to have her  house  removed out of her sight But she assured them that it gave her pleasure and spirits and being a necessary preparation she wondered they should be surprised at it when she had not any of her family about her or any old acquaintance on whose care and exactness in these  punctilio's  as she called them she could rely  The Doctor told Mrs Smith that he believed she would hold out long enough for any of her friends to have notice of her state and to see her and hardly longer and since he could not find that she had any certainty of hearing from or seeing her cousin Morden which made it plain that her relations continued inflexible he would go home and write a letter to her father take it as she would  She had spent great part of the day in intense devotions and tomorrow morning she is to have with her the same clergyman who has often attended her from whose hands she will again receive the Sacrament  Thou seest Lovelace that all is preparing that all will be ready and I am to attend her tomorrow afternoon to take some instructions from her in relation to my part in the office to be performed for her And thus omitting the particulars of a fine conversation between her and Mrs Lovick which the latter acquainted me with as well as another between her and the Doctor and Apothecary which I had a design this evening to give you they being  of a very affecting nature I have yielded to your impatience  I shall dispatch Harry tomorrow morning early with her letter to Miss Howe An offer she took very kindly as she is extremely solicitous to lessen that young lady's apprehensions for her on not hearing from her by Saturday's post And yet to write the truth how can her apprehensions be lessened  LETTER XXXIX Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Miss  HOWE    Saturday Sept    I Write my beloved Miss Howe tho' very ill still But I could not by the return of your messenger for I was then unable to hold a pen  Your mother's illness as by the first part of your letter gave me great distress for you till I read further You bewail it as it becomes a daughter so sensible May you be blessed in each other for many very many happy years to come I doubt not that even this sudden and grievous indisposition by the frame it has put you in and the apprehension it has given you of losing so dear a mother will contribute to the happiness I wish you For alas my dear we never know how to value the blessings we enjoy till we are in danger of losing them or have actually lost them And then what would we give to have them restored to us  What I wonder has again happened between you and Mr Hickman Altho' I know it not I dare say it is owing to some pretty petulance to some halfungenerous advantage taken of his obligingness and assiduity Will you never my dear give the weight You and all our Sex ought to give to the qualities of sobriety and regularity of life and manners in that Sex Must bold creatures and forward spirits for ever and by the best and wisest of us as well as by the indiscreetest be the most kindly used  My dear friends know not that I  have  actually suffered within  less  than  an inch of my life    Poor Mr Brand He meant well I believeI am afraid all will turn heavily upon him when he probably thought that he was taking the best method to oblige  But were he  not  to have been so light of belief and so weakly officious but had given a more favourable and it would be strange if I could not say a  juster  report things would have been nevertheless exactly as they are  I must lay down my pen I am very ill I believe I shall be better byandby The bad writing would betray me altho' I had a mind to keep from you what the event must soon  Now I resume my trembling pen Excuse the unsteady writing It  will  be so  I have wanted no money So don't be angry about such a trifle as money Yet am I glad of what you incline me to hope that my friends will give up the produce of my grandfather's estate since it has been in their hands Because knowing it to be my right and that  they  could not want it I had already disposed of a good part of it and could only hope they would be willing to give it up at my last request And now how rich shall I think myself in this my last stageAnd yet I did not want beforeIndeed I did notFor who that has many  superfluities  can be said to want  Do not my dear friend be concerned that I call it my  last stage  for what is even the long life which in high health we wish for What but as we go along a life of apprehension sometimes for our friends oftener for ourselves And at last when arrived at the old age we covet one heavy loss or deprivation having succeeded another we see ourselves stript as I may say of everyone we loved and find ourselves exposed as uncompanionable poor creatures to the slights to the contempts of jostling youth who want to push us off the stage in hopes to possess what we haveAnd superadded to all our own infirmities every day increasing Of themselves enough to make the life we wishedfor the greatest disease of all Don't you remember the lines of Howard which once you read to me in my ivybower  These are the lines the lady refers to  From death we rose to life 'Tis but the same  Thro' life to pass again from whence we came  With shame we see our PASSIONS can prevail  Where  Reason Certainty  and  Virtue  fail  HONOUR that empty name can death despise  SCORN'D LOVE to death as to a  refuge  flies  And SORROW waits for death with longing eyes  HOPE triumphs o'er the thoughts of death and FATE  Cheats fools and flatters the unfortunate  We fear to lose what a  small time  must waste  Till life itself grows the  disease  at last  Begging for life we beg for  more decay    And to be  long a dying  only pray    In the disposition of what belongs to me I have endeavoured to do everything in the justest and best manner I could think of putting myself in my relations places and in the greater points ordering my matters as if no misunderstanding had happened  I hope they will not think much of some bequests where wanted and where due from my gratitude But if they should what is done is done and I cannot now help it Yet I must repeat that I hope I hope I have pleased every one of them For I would not on any account have it thought that in my last disposition anything undaughterly unsisterly or unlike a kinswoman should have had place in a mind that is  so  truly free as I will presume to say from all resentment that it now overflows with gratitude and blessings for the good I  have  received altho' it be not all that my heart wished to receive Were it even an  hardship  that I was not favoured with more what is it but an hardship of half a year against the  most  indulgent goodness of eighteen years and an half that ever was shewn to a daughter  My cousin you tell me thinks I was off my guard and that I was taken at some advantage Indeed my dear I was not Indeed I gave no room for advantage to be taken of me I hope one day that will be seen if I have the justice done me which Mr Belford assures me of  I should hope that my cousin has not taken the liberties which you by an observation not unjust seem to charge him with For it is sad to think that the generality of that Sex should make so light of crimes which they justly hold so unpardonable in their own most intimate relations of oursYet cannot commit them without  doing such injuries to other families and individuals as they think themselves obliged to resent unto death when offered to their own families  But we women are too often to blame on this head since the most virtuous among us seldom make  virtue  the test of their approbation of the other Insomuch that a man may glory in his wickedness of this sort without being rejected on that account even to the faces of women of unquestionable virtue Hence it is that a libertine seldom thinks himself concerned so much as to save appearances And what is it not that our Sex suffers in their opinions on this very score And what have I more than many others to answer for on this very account in the world's eye  May my story be a warning to all how they prefer a libertine to a man of true honour and how they permit themselves to be misled where they mean the  best  by the specious yet foolish hope of subduing riveted habits and as I may say of altering naturesThe  more  foolish as experience might convince us that there is hardly one in ten of even tolerably happy marriages in which the wife keeps the hold in the  husband  's affections which she had in the  lover  's What influence then can she hope to have over the morals of an avowed libertine who marries perhaps for conveniency who despises the tie and whom it is too probable nothing but old age or sickness or disease the consequence of ruinous riot can reclaim  I am very glad you gave my cous  Sunday morning Sept    six o'clock    HITHER I had written and was forced to quit my pen And so much weaker and worse I grew that had I resumed it to have closed here it must have been with such trembling unsteadiness that it would have given you more concern for me than the delay of sending it away by last night's post can do So I deferred it to see how it would please God to deal with me And I find myself after a better night than I expected lively and clear and hope to give you a proof that I do in the continuation of my letter which I will pursue as currently as if I had not left off  I am glad you so considerately gave my cousin Morden favourable impressions of Mr Belford since otherwise  some misunderstanding might have happened between  them  For altho' I hope this gentleman is an altered man and in time will be a reformed one yet is he one of those high spirits that has been accustomed to resent  imaginary indignities  to  himself  when I believe he has not been studious to avoid giving  real offences  to  others  men of this cast acting as if they thought all the world was made to bear with them and they with nobody in it  Mr Lovelace you tell me thought fit to intrust my cousin with the copy of his letter of penitence to me and with my answer to it rejecting him and his suit And Mr Belford moreover acquaints me how much concerned Mr Lovelace is for his baseness and how freely he accused himself to my cousin This shews that the true bravery of spirit is to be above doing a vile action and that nothing subjects the human mind to such meannesses as to be guilty of wilful wrongs to our fellowcreatures How low how sordid are the submissions which elaborate baseness compels That that wretch could treat me as he did and then could so poorly creep to me to be forgiven and to be allowed to endeavour to repair crimes so wilful so black and so premeditated How my soul despised him for his meanness on a certain occasion of which you will one day be informed  Meaning his meditated second violence  See Vol  v  Letter  and his succeeding letters to her supplicating her pardon  And him whom one's heart despises it is far from being difficult to reject had one ever so partially favoured him once  Yet am I glad this violent spirit  can  thus creep that like a poisonous serpent he  can  thus coil himself and hide his head in his own narrow circlets because this stooping this abasement gives me hope that no further mischief will ensue  All my apprehension is what may happen when I am gone lest then my cousin or any other of my family should endeavour to avenge me and risk their own more precious lives on that account  If that part of Cain's curse were Mr Lovelace's  To be a fugitive and vagabond in the earth  that is to say if it meant no more harm to him than that he should be obliged to travel as it seems he intends tho' I wish him no  ill in his travels and I could know it then should I be easy in the hop'dfor safety of my friends from his skilful violence Oh that I could hear he was a thousand miles off  When I began this letter I did not think I could have run to such a length But 'tis to YOU my dearest friend and  you  have a title to the spirits you raise and support for they are no longer mine and will subside the moment I cease writing to you  But what do you bid me hope for when you tell me that if your mother's health will permit you will see me in town I  hope  your mother's health will be perfected as you wish but I dare not promise myself so great a favour so great a  blessing  I will call itAnd indeed I know not if I should be able to bear it now  Yet one comfort it is in your power to give me and that is Let me know and very speedily it must be if you wish to oblige me that all matters are made up between you and Mr Hickman to whom I see you are resolved with all your bravery of spirit to owe a multitude of obligations for his patience with your flightiness Think of this my dear proud friend and think likewise of what I have often told you That PRIDE in man or woman is an extreme that hardly ever fails sooner or later to bring forth its mortifying CONTRARY  May You my dear Miss Howe have no discomforts but what you make to yourself Those as it will be in your own power to lessen them ought to be your own punishment if you do not As there is no such thing as  perfect happiness  here since the busy mind will  make  to itself evils were it to  find  none you will pardon this limited wish strange as it may appear till you consider it For to wish you no infelicities either within or without you were to wish you what can never happen in this world and what perhaps ought not to be wished for if by a wish one  could  give one's friend such an exemption since we are not to live here always  We must not in short expect that our roses will grow without thorns But then they are useful and instructive thorns which by pricking the fingers of the too hasty plucker teach future caution at the same time that they  add sweets and poignancy too to enjoyments which are not overeasily attained  I  must  conclude  God for ever bless you and all you love and honour and reward you here and hereafter for your kindness to  Your everobliged and affectionate  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER XL Mrs  NORTON  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    In Answer to hers of Thursday Aug      Thursday Aug    I Had written sooner my dearest young lady but that I have been endeavouring ever since the receipt of your last letter to obtain a private audience of your mother in hopes of leave to communicate it to her But last night I was surprised by an invitation to breakfast at HarlowePlace this morning And the chariot came early to fetch me An honour I did not expect  When I came I found there was to be a meeting of all your family with Colonel Morden at HarlowePlace and it was proposed by your mother and consented to that I should be present Your cousin I understand had with difficulty brought this meeting to bear for your brother had before industriously avoided all conversation with him on the affecting subject urging That it was not necessary to talk to Mr Morden upon it who being a remoter relation than themselves had no business to make himself a judge of their conduct to their daughter their niece and their sister especially as he had declared himself in her favour adding That he should hardly have patience to be questioned by him on that head  I was in hopes that your mamma would have given me an opportunity of talking with her alone before the company met but she seemed studiously to avoid it I dare say however not with her inclination  I was ordered in just before Mr Morden came and was bid to sit downWhich I did in the window  The Colonel when he came began the discourse by  renewing  as he called it his solicitations in your favour  He set before them your penitence your ill health your virtue tho' once betrayed and basely used He then read to them Mr Lovelace's letter a most contrite one indeed  See Vol  vi  p    and your  highsoul'd  answer  See Vol  vi  p    for that was what he justly called it and he treated as it deserved Mr Brand's officious information of which I had before heard he had made them ashamed by representations founded upon inquiries made by Mr Alston  See p    of this Vol  whom he procured to go up on purpose to acquaint himself with your manner of life and what was meant by the visits of that Mr Belford  He then told them That he had the day before waited upon Miss Howe and had been shewn a letter from you to her  See p    and permitted to take some memorandums from it in which you appeared both by handwriting and the con  ents to be so very ill that it seemed doubtful to him if it were possible for you to get over it And when he read to them that passage where you ask Miss Howe  'What can be done for you now were your friends to be ever so favourable and wish for  their  sakes more than for your  own  that they would still relent' and then say 'You are very illYou must drop your penAnd ask excuse for your crooked writing and take as it were a last farewel of Miss Howe  Adieu my dear adieu  '  are your words  O my child my child said your mamma weeping and clasping her hands  Dear Madam said your brother be so good as to think you have more children than this ingrateful one  Yet your sister seemed affected  Your uncle Harlowe wiping his eyes O cousin said he if one thought the poor girl was  really  so ill  She  must  said your uncle Antony This is written to her private friend God forbid she should be quite lost  Your uncle Harlowe wish'd they did not carry their resentments too far  I begged for God's sake wringing my hands and with a bended knee that they would permit me to go up to you engaging to give them a faithful account of the way  you were in But I was chidden by your brother and this occasioned some angry words between him and Mr Morden  I believe Sir I believe Madam said your sister to her father and mother we need not trouble my cousin to read any more It does but grieve and disturb you My sister Clary seems to be ill I think if Mrs Norton were permitted to go up to her it would be right Wickedly as she has acted if she be truly penitent  Here she stopt and every one being silent I stood up once more and besought them to let me go And then I offered to read a passage or two in your letter to me of the th But I was taken up again by your brother and this occasioned still higher words between the Colonel and him  Your mamma hoping to gain upon your inflexible brother and to divert the anger of the two gentlemen from each other proposed that the Colonel should proceed in reading the minutes he had taken from your letter  He accordingly read  'Of your resuming your pen That you thought you had taken your last farewel and the rest of that very affecting passage in which you are obliged to break off more than once and afterwards to take an airing in a chair'  Your brother and sister were affected at this and he had recourse to his snuffbox And where you comfort Miss Howe and say  'You shall be happy'  It is more said he than she will let anybody else be  Your sister called you Sweet soul but with a low voice Then grew hardhearted again yet said Nobody could help being affected by your pathetic griefbut that it was your talent  The Colonel then went on to the good effect your airing had upon you to your good wishes to Miss Howe and Mr Hickman and to your concluding sentence That when the happy life you wish  her  comes to be wound up she may be as calm and as easy at quitting it as you hope in God you shall be Your mamma could not stand this but retired to a corner of the room and sobb'd and wept Your father for a few minutes could not speak tho' he seemed inclined to say something  Your uncles were also both affectedBut your brother  went round to each and again reminded your mamma that she had other children What was there he said in what was read but the result of the talent you had of moving the passions And he blamed them for choosing to hear read what they knew their abused indulgence could not be proof against  This set Mr Morden up again Fie upon you cousin Harlowe said heI see plainly to whom it is owing that all relationship and ties of blood with regard to this sweet sufferer are laid aside Such rigors as these make it difficult for a sliding virtue ever to recover itself  Your brother pretended the honour of the family and declared that no child ought to be forgiven who abandoned the most indulgent of parents against warning against the light of knowlege as you had done  But Sir and Ladies said I rising from my seat in the window and humbly turning round to each If I may be permitted to speak my dear Miss asks only for a blessing She begs not to be received to favour She is very ill and asks only for a last blessing  Come come goody Norton I need not tell you who said this you are up again with your lamentablesA good woman as you are to forgive so readily a crime that has been as disgraceful to your part in her education as to her family is a weakness that would induce one to suspect your virtue if you were to be encounter'd by a temptation  properly adapted    By some such charitable logic as this said Mr Morden is my cousin Arabella captivated I doubt not If to be uncharitable and unforgiving is to give a proof of virtue You Mr James Harlowe are the most virtuous young man in the world  I knew how it would be replied your brother in a passion if I met Mr Morden upon this business I would have declined it But you Sir to his father would not permit me so to do But Sir turning to the Colonel in no other presence  Then cousin James interrupted the other gentleman that which is  your  protection it seems is  mine  I am not used to bear defiances thusYou are my cousin Sirand the son and nephew of persons as dear as near to meThere he paused  Are we said your father to be made still more unhappy among ourselves when the villain lives that ought to be the object of everyone's resentment who has either a value for the family or for this ingrateful girl  That's the man said your cousin whom last Monday as you know I went purposely to make the object of mine But what could I say when I found him so willing to repair his crimeAnd I give it as my opinion and have written accordingly to my poor cousin that it is best for all round that his offer should be accepted And let me tell you  Tell me nothing said your father quite enraged of that very vile fellow I have a riveted hatred to him I would rather see the rebel die a hundred deaths were it possible than that she should give such a villain as him a relation to my family  Well but there is no room to think said your mamma that she will give us such a relation my dear The poor girl will lessen I fear the number of our relations not increase it If she be so ill as we are told she is let us send Mrs Norton up to herThat's the  least  we can doLet us take her however out of the hands of that Belford  Both your uncles supported this motion the latter part of it especially  Your brother observed in his illnatured way what a fine piece of consistency it was in you to refuse the vile injurer and the amends he offered yet to throw yourself upon the protection of his fast friend  Miss Harlowe was apprehensive she said that you would leave all you  could  leave to that pert creature Miss Howe So she called her if you should die  O do not do not suppose  that  my Bella said your poor mother I cannot think of parting with my ClaryWith all her faults she is my childHer reasons for her conduct are not heard It would break my heart to lose herI think my dear to your papa none so fit as I if you will give me leave to go up And Mrs Norton shall accompany me  This was a sweet motion and your father paused upon it Mr Morden offered his service to escort her Your uncles seemed to approve of it But your brother dash'd all  I hope Sir said he to his father I hope Madam to his mother that you will not endeavour to recover a faulty daughter by losing an unculpable son I do declare that if ever my sister Clary darkens these doors again I never will I will set out Madam the same hour you go to London on such an errand to Edinburgh and there I will reside and try to forget that I have relations in England so near and so dear as you are now all to me  Good God said the Colonel What a declaration is thisAnd suppose Sir and suppose Madam turning to your father and mother this  should  be the case Whether is it better think you that you should lose for ever such a daughter as my cousin Clary or that your son should go to Edinburgh and reside there upon an estate which will be the better for his residence upon it  Your brother's passionate behaviour hereupon is hardly to be described He resented it as promoting an alienation of the affection of the family to him And to such a height were resentments carried everyone siding with him that the Colonel with hands and eyes lifted up cried out What hearts of flint am I related toO cousin Harlowe to your father Are you resolved to have but one daughter Are you Madam to be taught by a son who has no bowels to forget that you are a mother  The Colonel turned from them to draw out his handkerchief and could not for a minute speak The eyes of everyone but the hardhearted brother caught tears from his  But then turning to them with the more indignation as it seemed as he had been obliged to shew a humanity which however no brave heart should be ashamed of I leave ye all said he fit company for one another I will never open my lips to any of you more upon this subject I will instantly make my will and in me shall the dear creature have the father uncle brother she has lost I will prevail upon her to take the tour of France and Italy with me nor shall she return till ye know the value of  such  a daughter  And saying this he hurried out of the room went into the courtyard and ordered his horse  Mr Antony Harlowe went to him there just as he was  mounting and said He hoped he should find him cooler in the evening for he till then had lodged at his house and that then they would converse calmly and everyone mean time would weigh all matters wellBut the angry gentleman said Cousin Harlowe I shall endeavour to discharge the obligations I owe to your civility since I have been in England But I have been so treated by that hotheaded young man who as far as I know has done more to ruin his sister than Lovelace himself and  this  with the approbation of you all that I will not again enter into  your  doors or  theirs  My servants shall have orders whither to bring what belongs to me from your house I will see my dear cousin Clary as soon as I can And so God bless you all together Only this one word to your nephew if you please That he wants to be taught the difference between courage and bluster and it is happy for him perhaps that I am  his  kinsman tho' I am sorry he is  mine    I wondered to hear your uncle on his return to them all repeat this because of the consequences it may be attended with tho' I hope it will not have bad onesYet it was considered as a sort of challenge and so it confirmed everybody in your brother's favour and Miss Harlowe forgot not to inveigh against that error which had brought on all these evils  I took the liberty again but with fear and trembling to desire leave to attend you  Before any other person could answer your brother said He supposed I looked upon myself to be my own mistress Did I want their consents and  courtship  to go up If he might speak his mind we were  fittest  to be togetherYet he wish'd I would not trouble my head about their familymatters till I was desired so to do  But don't you know brother said Miss Harlowe that the error of any branch of a family splits that family all in pieces and makes not only every common friend and acquaintance but even  servants  judges over bothThis is one of the blessed effects of my sister Clary's fault  There never was a creature so criminal said your father looking with displeasure at me who had not some weak heads to pity and side with her  I wept Your mamma was so good as to take me by the hand Come good woman said she come along with me You have too much reason to be afflicted at what afflicts Us to want additions to your grief  But my dearest young lady I was more touched for your sake than for my own For I have been low in the world for a great number of years and of consequence must have been accustomed to snubs and rebuffs from the affluent But I hope that patience is written as legibly on my forehead as haughtiness on that of any of my obligers  Your mamma led me to her chamber and there we sat and wept together for several minutes without being able to speak either of us one word to the other At last she broke silence asking me If you were really and indeed so ill as it was said you were  I answered in the affirmative and would have shewn her your last letter but she declined seeing it  I would fain have procured from her the favour of a line to you with her blessing I asked what was  intended  by your brother and sister Would nothing satisfy them but your final reprobationI insinuated how easy it would be did not your duty and humility govern you to make yourself independent as to circumstances but that nothing but a Blessing a  last  Blessing was requested by you And many other things I urged in your behalf The following brief repetition of what she was pleased to say in answer to my pleas will give you a notion of it all and of the present situation of things  She said  'She was very unhappy She had lost the little authority she once had over her other children thro' one child's failing and all influence over Mr Harlowe and his brothers Your father she said had besought her to leave it to him to take his own methods with you and as she valued him to take no step in your favour unknown to him and your uncles Yet she owned that they were too much governed by your brother They would however give way in time she knew to a reconciliation They designed no other for they all still loved you  'Your brother and sister she owned were very jealous of your coming into favour again Yet could but  Mr Morden have kept his temper and stood her son's first sallies who had carried his resentment so high having always had the family grandeur in view that he knew not how to descend the conferences so abruptly broken off just now would have ended more happily for that she had reason to think that a few concessions on your part with regard to your grandfather's estate and your cousin's engaging for your submission as from  proper  motives would have softened them all  'Mr Brand's account of your intimacy with the friend of the obnoxious man she said had for the time very unhappy effects for she had before that gained some ground But afterwards dared not nor indeed had inclination to open her lips in your behalf Your continued intimacy with that Mr Belford was wholly unaccountable accountable and as wholly inexcuseable  'What made the wish'dfor reconciliation she said more difficult was first that you yourself acknowleged yourself dishonoured and it was too well known that it was your own fault that you ever were in the power of so great a profligate of consequence that their and your disgrace could not be greater than it was Yet that you refused to prosecute the wretch Next that the pardon and blessing hoped for must probably be attended with your marriage to the man they hate and who hates them as much Very disagreeable circumstances she said I must allow to found a reconciliation upon  'As to her own part she must needs say That if there were any hope that Mr Lovelace would become a reformed man the letter her cousin Morden had read to them from him to you and the justice as she hoped it was he did your character tho' to his own condemnation his family and fortunes being unexceptionable and all his relations earnest to be related to you were arguments that would have weight with her could they have any with your father and uncles'  To my plea of your illness  'She could not but flatter herself she answered that it was from lowness of spirits and temporary dejection A young creature she said so very considerate as you naturally were and fallen so  low must have enough of that Should they lose you which God forbid the scene would then indeed be sadly changed for then those who now most resented would be most grieved all your fine qualities would rise to their remembrance and your unhappy error would be quite forgotten  'She wished you would put yourself into your cousin's protection intirely and have nothing more to say to Mr Belford'  And I would recommend it to your most serious consideration my dear Miss Clary whether now as your cousin who is your trustee for your grandfather's estate is come you should not give over all thoughts of Mr Lovelace's intimate friend for your executor more especially as that gentleman's interfering in the concerns of your family should the sad event take place which my heart akes but to think of might be attended with those consequences which you are so desirous in other cases to obviate and prevent And suppose my dear young lady you were to write one letter more to each of your uncles to let them know how ill you areAnd to a  their advice and offer to be governed by it in relation to the disposition of your estate and effects  I find they will send you up a large part of what has been received from that estate since it was yours together with your current cash which you left behind you And this by your cousin Morden for fear you should have contracted debts which may make you uneasy  They seem to expect that you will wish to live at your grandfather's house in a private manner if your cousin prevail not upon you to go abroad for a year or two  Friday morning  BETTY was with me just now She tells me that your cousin Morden is so much displeased with them all that he has refused to lodge any more at your uncle Antony's and has even taken up with inconvenient lodgings till he is provided with others to his mind This very much concerns them and they repent their violent treatment of him And the more as he is resolved he says to make you his heir general and his full and whole executrix  What noble fortunes still my dearest young lady await  you I am thoroughly convinced if it please God to preserve your life and your health that everybody will soon be reconciled to you and that you will see many happy days  Your mamma wished me not to attend you as yet because she hopes that I may give myself that pleasure soon with everybody's good liking and even at their desire Your cousin Morden's reconciliation with them which they are very desirous of I am ready to hope will include theirs with you  But if that should happen which I so much dread and I not with you I should never forgive myself Let me therefore my dearest young lady desire you to command my attendance if you find any danger and if you wish me peace of mind and no consideration shall withhold me  I hear that Miss Howe has obtained leave from her mother to see you and intends next week to go to town for that purpose and as it is believed to buy cloaths for her approaching nuptials  Mr Hickman's motherinlaw is lately dead Her jointure of  l  a year is fallen in to him and she has moreover as an acknowlegement of his good behaviour to her left him all she was worth which was very considerable a few legacies excepted to her own relations  These good men are uniformly good Indeed could not else  be  good and never fare the worse for being so All the world agrees he will make that fine young lady an excellent husband And I am sorry they are not as much agreed in her making him an excellent wife But I hope a lady of her principles would not encourage his address if whether she at present loves him or not she thought she could  not  love him or if she preferred any other man to him  Mr Pocock undertakes to deliver This but fears it will be Saturday night first if not Sunday morning  May the Almighty protect and bless you I long to see youMy dearest young lady I long to see you and to fold you once more to my fond heart I dare to say happy days are coming Be but chearful Give way to hope  Whether for this world or the other you  must  be happy Wish to live however were it only because you are so well fitted in mind to make everyone happy who has the honour to know you What signifies this transitory eclipse You are as near perfection by all I have heard as any creature in this world can be For here is your glory You are brightened and purified as I may say by your sufferingsHow I long to hear your whole sad yet instructive story from your own lips  For Miss Howe's sake who in her new engagements will so much want you for your cousin Morden's sake for your mother's sake if I must go no further in your family and yet I can say for all their sakes and for my sake my dearest young lady let your resumed and accustomed magnanimity bear you up You have many things to do which I know not the person who will do if you leave us  Join your prayers then to mine that God will spare you to a world that wants you and your example and altho' your days may seem to have been numbered who knows but that with the good King Hezekiah you may have them prolonged Which God grant if it be his blessed will to the prayers of  Your  JUDITH NORTON  LETTER XLI Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Monday Sept    THE lady would not read the letter she had from Mrs Norton till she had received the Communion for fear it should contain anything that might disturb that happy calm which she had been endeavouring to obtain for it And when that solemn office was over she was so composed she said that she thought she could receive any news however affecting with tranquillity  Nevertheless in reading it she was forced to leave off several times thro' weakness and a dimness in her sight of which she complained if I may say  complained  for so easy and soft were her complaints that they could hardly be called such  She was very much affected at divers parts of this letter  She wept several times and sigh'd often Mrs Lovick told me that these were the gentle exclamations she broke out into as she read  Her unkind her cruel brotherHow  unsisterly  Poor dear woman  seeming to speak of Mrs Norton  Her kind cousinO these flaming spirits  And then reflecting upon herself more than once  What a deep error is mineWhat evils have I been the occasion of    When I was admitted to her presence I have received said she a long and not very pleasing letter from my dear Mrs Norton It will soon be in your hands I am advised against appointing you to the office you have so kindly accepted But you must resent nothing of these things My choice will have an odd appearance to them But it is now too late to alter it if I would  I would fain write an answer to it continued she But I have no distinct sight Mr Belford no steadiness of fingersThis mistiness however will perhaps be gone byandbyThen turning to Mrs Lovick I don't think I am dying yetnot  actually  dying Mrs LovickFor I have no bodily painNo numbnesses no signs of immediate death I thinkAnd my breath which used of late to be so short is now tolerableMy head clear my intellects freeI think I cannot be dying yetI shall have agonies I doubtLife will not give up so blessedly easy I fearYet how merciful is the Almighty to give his poor creature such a sweet serenity'Tis what I have prayed forWhat encouragement Mrs Lovick so near one's dissolution to have it to hope that one's prayers are answered  Mrs Smith as well as Mrs Lovick was with her They were both in tears nor had I any more than they power to say a word in answer Yet she spoke all this as well as what follows with a surprising composure of mind and countenance  But Mr Belford said she assuming a still sprightlier air and accent let me talk a little to you while I am thus able to say what I have to say  Mrs Lovick don't leave us for the women were rising to goPray sit down and do you Mrs Smith sit  down tooDame Shelbourne take this key and open that upper drawer I will move to it  She did with trembling knees Here Mr Belford is my will It is witnessed by three persons of Mr Smith's acquaintance  I dare to hope that my cousin Morden will give you assistance if you request it of him My cousin Morden continues his affection for me But as I have not seen  him  I leave all the trouble upon  you  Mr Belford This deed may want forms and it does no doubt But the less as I have my grandfather's will almost by heart and have often enough heard that canvassed I will lay it by itself in this corner putting it at the further end of the drawer  She then took up a parcel of letters inclosed in one cover sealed with three seals of black wax This said she I sealed up last night The cover Sir will let you know what is to be done with what it incloses This is the superscription holding it close to her eyes and rubbing them  As soon as I am certainly dead this to be broke open by Mr Belford  Here Sir I put it placing it by the willThese folded papers are letters and copies of letters disposed according to their dates Miss Howe will do with those as you and she shall think fit If I receive any more or more come when I cannot receive them they may be put into this drawer pulling out and pushing in the lookingglass drawer You'll be so kind as to observe that Mrs Lovick and dame Shelburne to be given to Mr Belford be they from whom they will  Here Sir proceeded she I put the keys of my apparel putting them into the drawers with her papers All is in order and the inventory upon them and an account of what I have disposed of So that nobody need to ask Mrs Smith any questions  There will be no immediate need to open or inspect the trunks which contain my wearing apparel Mrs Norton will open them or order somebody to do it for her in your presence Mrs Lovick for so I have directed in my will They may be sealed up now I shall never more have occasion to open them  She then tho' I expostulated to the contrary caused me to seal them up with my seal  After this she locked the drawer where were her papers first taking out her book of  Meditations  as she called it saying She should perhaps have use for that and then desired me to take the key of that drawer for she should have no further occasion for that neither  All this in so composed and chearful a manner that we were equally surprised and affected with it  You can witness for me Mrs Smith and so can you Mrs Lovick proceeded she if any one ask after my life and conversation since you have known me that I have been very orderly have kept good hours and never have lain out of your house but when I was in prison and then you know I could not help it  O Lovelace that thou hadst heard her or seen her unknown to herself on this occasionNot one of us could speak a word  I shall leave the world in perfect charity proceeded she And turning towards the women Don't be so much concerned for me my good friends This is all but needful preparation and I shall be very happy  Then again rubbing her eyes which she said were misty and looking more intently round upon each particularly on meGod bless you all said she how kindly are you concerned for meWho says I am friendless Who says I am abandoned and among strangersGood Mr Belford don't be so  generously  humaneIndeed putting her handkerchief to her charming eyes you will make me less happy than I am sure you wish me to be  While we were thus solemnly engaged a servant came with a letter from her cousin MordenThen said she he is not come  himself  She broke it open but every line she said appeared two to her So that being unable to read it herself she desired I would read it to her I did so and wish'd it were more consolatory to her But she was all patient attention tears however often trickling down her cheeks By the date it was written yesterday and this is the substance of it  He tells her  'That the Thursday before he had procured a general meeting of her principal relations at her father's tho' not without difficulty her haughty  brother opposing it and when met rendering all his endeavours to reconcile them to her ineffectual He censures him as the most ungovernable young man he ever knew Some great sickness he says some heavy misfortune is wanted to bring him to a knowlege of himself and of what is due from him to others and he wishes that he were not  her  brother and  his  cousin Nor does he spare her father and uncles for being so implicitly led by him'  He tells her  'That he parted with them all in high displeasure and thought never more to darken any of their doors That he declared as much to her two uncles who came to him on Saturday to try to accommodate with him and who found him preparing to go to London to attend her and that notwithstanding their pressing intreaties he determined so to do and not to go with them to HarlowePlace or to either of their own houses and accordingly dismissed them with such an answer  'But that her noble letter as he calls it of Aug  See Letter  xxix  p    being brought him about an hour after their departure he thought it might affect them as much as it did him and give them the exalted opinion of her virtue and honour which was so well deserved and at the same time convince them of what they made such difficulty to believe to wit that you and all your relations were sollicitous to obtain the honour of her alliance on her own terms And that this induced him to turn his horse's head back to her uncle Antony's instead of forward towards London  'That accordingly arriving there and finding her two uncles together he read to them the affecting letter which left neither of the three a dry eye That the absent as is usual in such cases bearing all the load they accused her brother and sister and besought him to put off his journey to town till he could carry with him the blessings which she had formerly in vain solicited for and as they hoped the happy tidings of a general reconciliation  'That not doubting but his visit would be the more welcome to her if these good ends could be obtained  he the more readily complied with their desires But not being willing to subject himself to the possibility of receiving fresh insults from her brother he had given her uncles a copy of her letter for the family to assemble upon and desired to know as soon as possible the result of their deliberations  'He tells her that he shall bring her up the accounts relating to the produce of her grandfather's estate and adjust them with her having actually in his hands the arrears due to her from it  'He highly applauds the noble manner in which she resents your usage of her It is impossible he owns that you can either deserve her or to be forgiven But as you do justice to her virtue and offer to make her all the reparation now in your power and as she is so very earnest with him not to resent that usage and declares that you could not have been the author of her calamities but through a strange concurrence of unhappy causes and as he is not at a loss to know how to place to a  proper account  that strange concurrence he desires her not to be apprehensive of any vindictive measures from him  Nevertheless as may be expected  'he inveighs against you as he finds that she gave you no advantage over her But he forbears to enter further into this subject he says till he has the honour to see her and the rather as she seems so much determined against you However he cannot but say that he thinks you a gallant man and a man of sense and that you have the reputation of being thought a generous man in every instance but where the Sex is concerned In  such  he owns that you have taken inexcusable liberties And he is sorry to say that there are very few young men of fortune but who allow themselves in the same Both Sexes he observes too much love to have each other in their power Yet he hardly ever knew man or woman who was very fond of power make a right use of it  'If she be so absolutely determined against marrying you as she declares she is he hopes he says to prevail upon her to take as soon as her health will permit a little tour abroad with him as what will probably establish it since traveling is certainly the best physic for  all those disorders which owe their rise to grief and disappointment An absence of two or three years will endear her to every one on her return and everyone to her  'He expresses his impatience to see her He will set out he says the moment he knows the result of her family's determination which he doubts not will be favourable Nor will he wait long for that'  When I had read the letter thro' to the languishing lady And so my friends said she have I heard of a patient who actually died while five or six principal physicians were in a consultation and not agreed upon what name to give to his distemper The patient was an Emperor The Emperor Joseph I think  I asked If I should write to her cousin as he knew not how ill she was to hasten up  By no means she said since if he were not already set out she was persuaded that she should be so low by the time he could receive my letter and come that his presence would but discompose and hurry  her  and afflict  him    I hope however she is not so very near her end And without saying any more to her when I retired I wrote to Colonel Morden that if he expects to see his beloved cousin alive he must lose no time in setting out I sent this letter by his own servant  Dr H sent away  his  letter to her father by a particular hand this morning  Mrs Walton the milaner has also just now acquainted Mrs Smith that her husband had a letter brought by a special messenger from parson Brand within this halfhour inclosing the copy of one he had written to Mr John Harlowe recanting his officious one  And as all these and the copy of the lady's letter to Col Morden will be with them pretty much at a time the devil's in the family if they are not struck with a remorse that shall burst open the doublebarred doors of their hearts  Will engages to reach you with this late as it will be before you go to rest He begs that I will testify for him the hour and the minute I shall give it him It is just half an hour after ten  I pretend to be now by use the swiftest shorthand writer  in England next to yourself But were matter to arise every hour to write upon and I had nothing else to do I cannot write so fast as you expect And let it be remembered that your servants cannot bring letters or messages before they are written or sent  J BELFORD  LETTER XLII Dr  H  To  JAMES HARLOWE  senior  Esq  London  Sept    SIR  IF I may judge of the hearts of other parents by my own I cannot doubt but you will take it well to be informed that you have yet an opportunity to save yourself and family great future regret by dispatching hither some one of it with your last blessing and your lady's to the most excellent of her sex  I have some reason to believe Sir that she has been represented to you in a very different light from the true one And this it is that induces me to acquaint you that I think her on the best grounds absolutely irreproachable in all her conduct which has passed under my eye or come to my ear and that her very misfortunes are made glorious to her and honourable to all that are related to her by the use she has made of them and by the patience and resignation with which she supports herself in a painful lingering and dispiriting decay and by the greatness of mind with which she views her approaching dissolution And all this from proper motives from motives in which a dying saint might glory  She knows not that I write I must indeed acknowlege that I offered to do so some days ago and that very pressingly Nor did she refuse me from obstinacyShe seems not to know what that isBut desired me to forbear for two days only in hopes that her newlyarrived cousin who as she heard was soliciting for her would be able to succeed in her favour  I hope I shall not be thought an officious man on this occasion But if I am I cannot help it being driven to write by a kind of  parental  and irresistible impulse  But Sir whatever you do or permit to be done must  be speedily done for she cannot I verily think live a week And how long of that short space she may enjoy her admirable intellects to take comfort in the favours you may think proper to confer upon her cannot be said I am SIR  Your most humble Servant  RH  LETTER XLIII Mr  BELFORD  To  WILLIAM MORDEN  Esq  London  Sept    SIR  THE urgency of the case and the opportunity by your servant will sufficiently apologize for this trouble from a stranger to your person who however is not a stranger to your merit  I understand you are imploying your good offices with Miss Clarissa Harlowe's parents and other relations to reconcile them to the most meritorious daughter and kinswoman that ever family had to boast of  Generously as this is intended by you we  here  have too much reason to think all your solicitudes on this head will be unnecessary For it is the opinion of every one who has the honour of being admitted to her presence that she cannot live over three days So that if you wish to see her alive you must lose no time to come up  She knows not that I write I had done it sooner if I had had the least doubt that before now she would not have received from you some news of the happy effects of your kind mediation in her behalf I am SIR  Your most humble Servant  J BELFORD  LETTER XLIV Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  In Answer to Letter  xli  p      Uxbridge  Tuesday morn between    and    AND can it be that this admirable creature will so soon leave this cursed world For cursed I shall think it and more cursed myself when she is gone O Jack thou  who canst sit so cool and like Addison's Angel  direct  and even  enjoy  the storm that tears up my happiness by the roots blame me not for my impatience however unreasonable If thou knewest that already I feel the torments of the damned in the remorse that wrings my heart on looking back upon my past actions by her thou wouldst not be the devil thou art to halloo on a worrying conscience which without thy merciless aggravations is altogether intolerable  I know not what I write nor what I would write When the company that used to delight me is as uneasy to me as my reflections are painful and I can neither help nor divert myself must not every servant about me partake in a perturbation so sincere  Shall I give thee a faint picture of the horrible uneasiness with which my mind struggles And faint indeed it must be for nothing but outrageous madness can exceed it and  that  only in the apprehension of others since as to the sufferer it is certain that actual distraction take it out of its lucid intervals must be an infinitely more happy state than the suspense and anxieties that bring it on  Forbidden to attend the dear creature yet longing to see her I would give the world to be admitted once more to her beloved presence I ride towards London three or four times a day resolving  pro  and  con  twenty times in two or three miles and at last ride back and in view of Uxbridge loathing even the kind friend and hospitable house turn my horse's head again towards the town and resolve to gratify my humour let her take it as she will but at the very entrance of it after infinite canvasings once more alter my mind dreading to offend and shock her lest by that means I should curtail a life so precious  Yesterday in particular to give you an idea of the strength of that impatience which I cannot avoid suffering to break out upon my servants I had no sooner dispatched Will than I took horse to meet him on his return  In order to give him time I loiter'd about on the road riding up  this  lane to the one highway down  that  to the other just as my horse pointed all the way cursing my very being and tho' so lately looking  down  upon all the  world wishing to change conditions with the poorest beggar that cried to me for charity as I rode by himand throwing him money in hopes to obtain by his prayers the blessing my heart pants after  After I had saunteredabout an hour or two which seemed three or four tedious ones fearing I had slipt the fellow I inquired at every turnpike whether a servant in such a livery had not passed thro' in his return from London on a full gallop for woe had been to the dog had I met him on a sluggish trot And lest I should miss him at one end of Kensington as he might take either the Acton or Hamersmith road or at the other as he might come thro' the Park or not how many score times did I ride backwards and forwards from the palace to the Gore making myself the subject of observation to all passengers whether on horseback or on foot who no doubt wondered to see a welldressed and wellmounted man sometimes ambling sometimes prancing as the beast had more fire than his master backwards and forwards in so short a compass  Yet all this time tho' longing to espy the fellow did I dread to meet him lest he should be charged with fatal tidings  When at distance I saw any man galloping towards me my resemblanceforming fancy immediately made it to be him and then my heart bounded to my mouth as if it would have choaked me But when the person's nearer approach undeceived me how did I curse the varlet's delay and thee by turns and how ready was I to draw my pistol at the stranger for having the impudence to gallop which none but my messenger I thought had either right or reason to do For all the business of the world I am ready to imagine should stand still on an occasion so melancholy and so interesting to myself Nay for this week past I could cut the throat of any man or woman I see laugh while I am in such dejection of mind  I am now convinced that the wretches who fly from a heavy scene labour under ten times more distress in the intermediate suspense and apprehension than  they  can do who are present at it and see and know the worst so much greater are the evils we dread than those we see  And so able is fancy or imagination the more immediate offspring of the soul to outdo fact let the subject be either joyous or grievous  And hence as I conceive it is that all pleasures are greater in the  expectation  or in the  reflection  than in  fruition  as all pains which press heavy upon both parts of that unequal union by which frail mortality holds its precarious tenure generally are most acute in the  present tense  For how easy sit upon the  reflection  the heaviest misfortunes especially when surmountedBut  most  easy I confess those in which Body has more concern than Soul This however is a point of philosophy I have neither time nor head just now to weigh So take it as it falls from a madman's pen  Woe be to either of the wretches who shall bring me the fatal news that she is no more For it is but too likely that a shriekowl so hated will never whoot or scream again unless the shock that will probably disorder my whole frame on so sad an occasion by  unsteadying  my hand shall divert my aim from his head heart or bowels if it turn not against my own  But surely she will not she cannot yet die Such a matchless excellence  whose mind  Contains a world and seems for all things fram'd  could not be lent to be so soon demanded back again  But may it not be that thou Belford art in a plot with the dear creature who will not let me attend her to convince myself in order to work up my soul to the deepest remorse and penitence and that when she is convinced of the sincerity of both and when my mind is made such wax as to be fit to take what impression she pleases to give it she will then raise me up with the joyful tidings of her returning health and acceptance of me  What would I give to have it so And when the happiness of  hundreds  as well as the peace and reconciliation of several eminent families depend upon  her  restoration and happiness why should it not be so  But let me presume it will Let me indulge my former hope however improbable  I will  and  enjoy  it too And  let me tell thee how ecstatic my delight would be on the unravelling of such a plot as this  Do  dear  Belford let it be soAnd O my dearest and everdear Clarissa keep me no longer in this cruel suspense in which I suffer a thousand times more than ever I made thee suffer Nor fear thou that I will resent or recede on an eclaircissement so desirable For I will adore thee for ever and without reproaching thee for the pangs thou hast tortured me with confess thee as much my superior in noble and generous contrivances as thou art in virtue and honour  But once moreShould the worst happensay not what that worst isand I am gone from this hated islandGone for everAnd may eternalBut I am crazed alreadyand will therefore conclude myself  Thine more than my own And no great compliment neither  R L  LETTER XLV Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Tuesday    Sept    in the morn at Mr Smith's    WHEN I read yours of this morning I could not help pitying you for the account you give of the dreadful anxiety and suspense you labour under I wish from my heart all were to end as you are so willing to hope But it will not be and your suspense if the worst part of your torment as you say it is will soon be over but alas in a way you wish not  I attended the lady just now She is extremely ill Yet is she aiming at an answer to her Mrs Norton's letter which she began yesterday in her own chamber and has written a good deal but in a hand not like her own fine one as Mrs Lovick tells me but much larger and the lines crooked  I have accepted of the offer of a room adjoining to the widow Lovick's till I see how matters go but unknown to the lady and I shall go home every night for a few hoursI would not lose a sentence that I could gain  from lips so instructive nor the opportunity of receiving any command from her for an estate  In this my new apartment I now write and shall continue to write as occasions offer that I may be the more circumstantial But I depend upon the return of my letters or copies of them on demand that I may have together all that relates to this affecting story which I shall reperuse with melancholy pleasure to the end of my life  I think I will send thee Brand's letter to Mr John Harlowe recanting his base surmizes It is a matchless piece of pedantry and may perhaps a little divert thy deep chagrin Some time hence at least it may if not now  What wretched creatures are there in the world What strangely mixed charactersSo sensible and so foolish at the same time What a  various  what a  foolish  creature is man  Three o'clock  THE lady has just finished her letter and has entertained Mrs Lovick Mrs Smith and me with a noble discourse on the vanity and brevity of life which I cannot do justice to in the repetition And indeed I am so grieved for her that ill as she is my intellects are not half so clear as hers  A few things which made the strongest impression upon me as well from the sentiments themselves as from her manner of uttering them I remember She introduced them thus  I am thinking said she what a gradual and happy death God Almighty Blessed be his name affords me Who would have thought that suffering what I have suffered and abandoned as I have been with such a tender education as I have had I should be so long a dyingBut see how by little and little it has come to this I was first taken off from the power of  walking  Then I took a  coach  A coach grew too violent an exercise Then I took a  chair  The prison was a large DEATHSTRIDE upon meI should have  suffered longer else  Next I was unable to go to  Church  then to go  up  or  down stairs  Now hardly can move from one  room  to  another  and a  less room  will soon hold meMy  eyes  begin to fail me so that at times I cannot see to read distinctly and now I can hardly  write  or hold a penNext I presume I  shall know nobody nor be able to thank any of you I therefore now once more thank you Mrs Lovick and you Mrs Smith and you Mr Belford while I  can  thank you for all your kindness to me And thus by little and little in such a gradual sensible death as I am blessed with God dies away in us as I may say all human satisfactions in order to subdue his poor creatures to Himself  Thou mayst guess how affected we all were at this moving account of her progressive weakness We heard it with wet eyes for what with the womens example and what with her moving eloquence I could no more help it than they But we were silent nevertheless and she went on applying herself to me  O Mr Belford This is a poor transitory life in its best enjoyments We flutter about here and there with all our vanities about us like painted butterflies for a gay but a very short season till at last we lay ourselves down in a quiescent state and turn into vile worms And who knows in what form or to what condition we shall rise again  I wish you would permit me a young creature just turned of Nineteen years of age blooming and healthy as I was a few months ago now nipt by the cold hand of death to influence you in  these my last hours  to a life of regularity and repentance for any past evils you may have been guilty of For believe me Sir that now in this last stage very few things will bear the test or be passed as laudable if  pardonable  at our own Ear much less at a more tremendous one in all we have done or delighted in even in a life not very offensive neither as  we  may thinkOught we not then to study in our  full day  before the dark hours approach so to live as may afford reflections that will soften the agony of the last moments when they come and let in upon the departing soul a ray of Divine Mercy to illuminate its passage into an awful eternity  She was ready to faint and choosing to lie down I withdrew I need not say with a melancholy heart And when I was got to my newtaken apartment my heart was still more affected by the sight of the solemn letter the admirable lady had so lately finished It was communicated  to me by Mrs Lovick who had it to copy for me but it was not to be  delivered to me  till after her departure However I trespassed so far as to prevail upon the widow to let me take a copy of it which I did directly in character  I send it inclosed If thou canst read it and thy heart not bleed at thy eyes thy remorse can hardly be so deep as thou hast inclined me to think it is  LETTER XLVI Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE  To Mrs  NORTON    In Answer to Letter  xl  p    Begun on Monday Sept and by piecemeal finished on Tuesday but not sent till the Thursday following    My dearest Mrs  NORTON  I Am afraid I shall not be able to write all that is upon my mind to say to you upon the subject of your last Yet I will try  As to my friends and as to the sad breakfasting I cannot help being afflicted for  them  What alas has not my mother in particular suffered by my rashnessYet to allow so much for a sonso little for a daughterBut all now will soon be over as to me I hope they will bury all their resentments in my grave  As to your advice in relation to Mr Belford let me only say that the unhappy reprobation I have met with and my short time must be my apology nowI wish I  could  have written to my mother and my uncles as you advise And yet favours come  so  slowly from them  The granting of one request only now remains as a desirable from them Which nevertheless when granted I shall not be sensible of It is that they will be pleased to permit my remains to be laid with those of my ancestorsPlaced at the feet of my dear grandfather as I have mentioned in my will This however as they please For after all this vile body ought not so much to engage my cares It is a weaknessBut let it be called a  natural  weakness and I shall be excused especially when a reverential gratitude shall be known to be the foundation of it You know my dear woman how my grandfather  loved me And you know how much I honoured him and that from my very infancy to the hour of his death How often since have I wished that he had not loved me so well  I wish not now at the writing of this to see even my cousin Morden O my blessed woman My dear maternal friend I am entering upon a better tour than to France or Italy eitherOr even than to settle at my once beloved dairyhouseAll these prospects and pleasures which used to be so agreeable to me in health how poor seem they to me now  Indeed indeed my dear mamma Norton I shall be happy I  know  I shallI have charming forebodings of happiness alreadyTell all my dear friends for their comfort that I shallWho would not bear the punishments I have borne to have the prospects and assurances I rejoice inAssurances I might  not have had  were all my own wishes to have been granted me  Neither do I want to see even  you  my dear Mrs Norton Nevertheless I must in justice to my own gratitude declare that there  was  a time that your presence and comfortings would have been balm to my wounded mind could you have been permitted to come without incurring displeasure from those whose esteem it is necessary for you to cultivate and preserve But were you now even by consent and with reconciliatory tidings to come it would but add to your grief And the sight of one I so dearly love so happily fraught with good news might but draw me back to wishes I have had great struggles to get above And let me tell you for your comfort that I have not left undone anything that ought to be done either respecting  mind  or  person  no not to the minutest preparation So that nothing is left for  you  to do for me Every one has her direction as to the last officesAnd my desk that I now write uponO my dearest Mrs Norton All is providedAll is ready And all will be as decent as it should be  And pray let my Miss Howe know that by the time you will receive This and she  your  signification of the contents of it it will in all probability be too late for  her  to do me the inestimable favour as I should once have  thought it to see me  God will have no rivals in the hearts of those he sanctifies  By various methods he deadens all other sensations or rather absorbs them all in the love of Him  I shall nevertheless love  you  my mamma Norton and my Miss Howe whose love to me  has passed the love of women  to my latest hourBut yet I am now above the quick sense of those pleasures which once most delighted me And once more I say that I do not wish to see objects so dear to me which might bring me back again into sense and rival my  Supreme Love    TWICE have I been forced to leave off I  wished  that my last writing might be to You or to Miss Howe if it might not be to my dearest ma  Mamma  I would have wroteIs the word distinctMy eyes are  so  mistyIf when I apply to you I break off in halfwords do you supply themThe kindest are your dueBe sure take the kindest to fill up chasms with if any chasms there be  ANOTHER breaking offBut the new day seems to rise upon me with healing in its wings I have gotten I think a recruit of strength Spirits I bless God I have not of late wanted  Let my dearest Miss Howe purchase her wedding garmentsAnd may all temporal blessings attend the charming preparationBlessings  will  I make no question notwithstanding the little cloudinesses that Mr Hickman encounters with nowandthen which are but prognostics of a future golden day to him For her heart is good and her head not wrongBut great merit is coy and that coyness has not always its foundation in pride But if it should  seem  to be pride take off the skindeep covering and in her it is noble diffidence and a love that wants but to be assured  Tell Mr Hickman I write this and write it as I believe with my last pen and bid him  bear  a little at first and  forbear  and all the future will be crowning gratitude and rewarding love For Miss Howe has great sense fine judgment and exalted generosity and can such a one  be ingrateful or easy under those obligations which his assiduity and obligingness when he shall be so happy as to call her his will lay her under to him  As for me never bride was so ready as I am My wedding garments are boughtAnd tho' not fine or gawdy to the sight tho' not adorned with jewels and set off with gold and silver for I have no beholders eyes to wish to glitter in yet will they be the easiest the  happiest  suit that ever bridal maiden worefor they are such as carry with them a security against all those anxieties pains and perturbations which sometimes succeed to the most promising outsettings  And now my dear Mrs Norton do I wish for no other  O hasten good God if it be thy blessed will the happy moment that I am to be decked out in this allquieting garb And sustain comfort bless and protect with the allshadowing wing of thy mercy my dear parents my uncles my brother my sister my cousin Morden my everdear and everkind Miss Howe my good Mrs Norton and every deserving person to whom  they  wish well is the ardent prayer first and last of every beginning hour as the clock tells it me Hours now are days nay years of  Your now not sorrowing or afflicted but happy  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER XLVII Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Wedn morn Sept    half an hour after three    I Am  not  the savage which you and my worst enemies think me My soul is  too much  penetrated by the contents of the letter which you inclosed in your last to say one word more to it than that my heart has bled over it from every veinI will fly from the subjectBut what other can I choose that will not be as grievous and lead into the same  I could quarrel with all the world with thee as well as the rest obliging as thou supposest thyself for writing to me hourly How daredst thou tho' unknown to her to presume to take an apartment under the same roof with herI cannot bear to think that thou  shouldst be seen at all hours passing to and repassing from her apartments while  I  who have so much reason to call her mine and once was preferred by her to all the world am forced to keep aloof and hardly dare to enter the  city  where she is  If there be anything in Brand's letter that will divert me hasten it to me But nothing now will ever divert me will ever again give me joy or pleasure I can neither eat drink nor sleep I am sick of all the world  Surely it will be better when  all is over  when I know the  worst  the fates can do against meYet how shall I bear that  worst  O Belford Belford write it not to me but if it  must  happen get somebody else to write for I shall curse the pen the hand the head and the heart employed in communicating to me the fatal tidings But what is this saying when already I curse the whole world except herMyself most  In fine I am a most miserable being Life is a burden to me I would not bear it upon these terms for one week more let what would be my lot for already is there a hell begun in my own mind Never more mention to me let  her  or who will say it the  prison  I cannot bear itMay damnation seize quick the accursed woman who could set death upon taking that  large stride  as the dear creature calls itI had no hand in it But her relations her implacable relations have done the business All else would have been got over Never persuade me but it would The fire of youth and the violence of passion would have pleaded for me to good purpose with an individual of a Sex which loves to be addressed with passionate ardor even to tumult had it not been for that cruelty and unforgivingness which the object and the penitence considered have no example and have aggravated the heinousness of my faults  Unable to rest tho' I went not to bed till two I dispatch this ere the day dawnWho knows what this night this dismal night may have produced  I must after my messenger I have told the varlet I will meet him perhaps at Knightsbridge perhaps in Piccadilly and I trust not myself with pistols not only on his account but my own For pistols are  too ready  a mischief  I hope thou hast a letter ready for him He goes to thy lodgings first For surely thou wilt not presume to take thy rest in an apartment near hers If he miss thee there he flies to Smith's and brings me word whether in being or not  I shall look for him thro' the air as I ride as well as on horseback for if the prince of it serve  me  as well as I have served  him  he will bring the dog by his ears like another Habakkuk to my saddlebow with the tidings that my heart pants after  Nothing but the excruciating pangs the condemned soul feels at its entrance into the eternity of the torments we are taught to fear can exceed what I now feel and have felt for almost this week past and mayst thou have a spice of those if thou hast not a letter ready written for  Thy  LOVELACE  LETTER XLVIII Mr  BELFORD  In Continuation  Tuesday Sept    six o'clock    THE lady remains exceedingly weak and ill Her intellects nevertheless continue clear and strong and her piety and patience are without example Every one thinks this night will be her last What a shocking thing is that to say of such an excellence She will not however send away her letter to her Norton as yet She endeavoured in vain to superscribe it So desired me to do it Her fingers will not hold her pen with the requisite steadiness She has I fear written and read her last  Eight o'clock  SHE is somewhat better than she was The Doctor has been here and thinks she will hold out yet a day or two He has ordered her as for some time past only some little cordials to take when ready to faint She seemed disappointed when he told her she might yet live two or three days and said She longed for dismissionLife was not so easily extinguished she saw as some imagine  Death from grief  was she believed  the slowest of deaths  But God's will must be doneHer only prayer was now for submission to it For she doubted not but by the Divine  goodness she should be an happy creature as soon as she could be divested of these  rags of mortality    Of her own accord she mentioned you which till then she had avoided to do She asked with great serenity where you were  I told her where and your motives of being so near and read to her a few lines of yours of this morning in which you mention your wishes to see her your sincere affliction and your resolution not to approach her without her consent  I would have read more but she said Enough Mr Belford enoughPoor man Does his conscience begin to find himThen need not anybody to wish him a greater punishmentMay it work upon him to a happy purpose  I took the liberty to say that as she was in such a frame that nothing now seemed capable of discomposing her I could wish that you might have the benefit of her exhortations which I dared to say while you were so seriously affected would have a greater force upon you than a thousand sermons and how happy you would think yourself if you could but receive her forgiveness on your knees  How can you think of such a thing Mr Belford said she with some emotion My composure is owing next to the Divine goodness blessing my earnest supplications for it to the  not  seeing him Yet let him know that I now again repeat that I forgive himAnd may God Almighty clasping her fingers and lifting up her eyes forgive him too and perfect his repentance and sanctify it to himTell him I say so And tell him that if I could not say so with my whole heart I should be very uneasy and think that my hopes of mercy to myself were but weakly founded and that I had still in any harboured resentments some hankerings after a life which he has been the cause of shortening  The divine creature then turning aside her headPoor man said she I once could have loved him This is saying more than ever I could say of any other man out of my own family Would he have permitted me to have been an humble instrument to have made him good I think I could have made him happyBut tell him not  this if he be  really  penitentIt may too much affect himThere she paused  Admirable creatureHeavenly forgiverThen resumingBut pray tell him that if I could know that my death might be a means to reclaim and save him it would be an inexpressible satisfaction to me  But let me not however be made uneasy with the apprehension of seeing him I cannot  bear  to see him  Just as she had done speaking the minister who had so often attended her sent up his name and was admitted  Being apprehensive that it would be with difficulty that you could prevail upon that impetuous spirit of yours not to invade her dying hours and of the agonies into which a surprize of this nature would throw her I thought this gentleman's visit afforded a proper opportunity to renew the subject and having asked her leave acquainted him with the topic we had been upon  The good man urged That some condescensions were usually expected on these solemn occasions from pious souls like hers however satisfied with  themselves  for the sake of shewing the  world  and for  examplesake  that all resentments against those who had most injured them were subdued And if she would vouchsafe to a heart so truly penitent as I had represented Mr Lovelace's to be that  personal  pardon which I had been pleading for there would be no room to suppose the least lurking resentment remained and it might have very happy effects upon the gentleman  I have no lurking resentment Sir said sheThis is not a time for resentment And you will be the readier to believe me when I can assure you looking at me that even what I have most rejoiced in the truly friendly love that has so long subsisted between my Miss Howe and her Clarissa altho' to my last gasp it will be the dearest to me of all that is dear in this life has already abated of its fervor has already given place to supremer fervors And shall the remembrance of Mr Lovelace's  personal  insults which I bless God never corrupted that  mind  which her friendship so much delighted be stronger in these hours with me than the remembrance of a love as pure as the human heart ever boasted Tell therefore the  world  if  you please and if you think what I said to you before Mr Belford not strong enough tell the poor man that I not only forgive him but have  such  earnest wishes for the good of his soul and that from considerations of its immortality that could my penitence avail for more sins than my own my last tear should fall for Him by whom I die  Our eyes and hands expressed for us both what our lips could not utter  Say not then proceeded she nor let it be said that my resentments are unsubduedAnd yet these eyes lifted up to Heaven as witness to the truth of what I have said shall never if I can help it behold him moreFor do ye not consider Sirs how short my time is what much more important subjects I have to employ it upon and how unable I should be so weak as I am to contend even with the avowed penitence of a person in strong health governed by passions unabated and always violentAnd now I hope you will never urge me more on this subject  The minister said It were pity ever to urge this plea again  You see Lovelace that I did not forget the office of a friend in endeavouring to prevail upon her to give you her last forgiveness personally And I hope as she is so near her end you will not invade her in her last hours since she must be extremely discomposed at such an interview and it might make her leave the world the sooner for it  This reminds me of an expression which she used on your barbarous hunting her at Smith's on her return to her lodgings and that with a serenity unexampled as Mrs Lovick told me considering the occasion and the trouble given her by it and her indisposition at the time He will not let me die decently said the angelic suffererHe will not let me enter into my Maker's presence with the composure that is required in entering into the drawing room of an earthly prince  I cannot however forbear to wish that the heavenly creature could have prevailed upon herself in these her last hours to see you and that for my sake as well as yours  For altho' I am determined never to be guilty of the crimes which have till within these few past weeks blackened my former life and for which at present I most heartily hate myself yet should I be less apprehensive of a relapse if wrought upon by the solemnity which such an interview must have been attended with you had become a reformed man For no devil do I fear but one in your shape  IT is now eleven o'clock at night The lady who retired to rest an hour ago is in a sweet slumber as Mrs Lovick tells me  I will close here I hope I shall find her the better for it in the morning Yet alas how frail is hope How frail is life when we are apt to build so much on every shadowy relief altho' in such a desperate case as this sitting down to reflect we  must  know that it is  but  shadowy  I will inclose Brand's horrid pedantry And for once am aforehand with thy ravenous impatience  Mr Brand's recantationletters one directed to his friend Mr the other to his patron Mr John Harlowe are thought to be originals in their way But as they are long and as the reader has already been let into his singular character  See Vol  VI  p    and p    and his Letter p    of this Volume  and as this collection is run into an undesirable length they are omitted  LETTER XLIX Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Wedn morn Sept    AND is she somewhat betterBlessings upon thee without number or measure Let her still be better and better  Tell  me so at least if it be  not  so For thou knowest not what a joy that poor temporary reprieve that she will hold out yet a day or two gave me  But who told this hardhearted and deathpronouncing Doctor that she will hold it no longer By what warrant says he this What presumption in these parading solemn fellows of a college which will be my contempt to the latest hour of my life if this brother of it eminent  as he is deemed to be cannot work an ordinary miracle in  her  favour or rather in  mine    Let me tell thee Belford that already he deserves the  utmost  contempt for suffering this charming clock to run down so low What must be his art if it could not wind it up in a quarter of the time he has attended her when at his first visits the springs and wheels of life and motion were so good that they seemed only to want common care and oiling  I am obliged to you for endeavouring to engage her to see me 'Twas like a friend If she had vouchsafed me that favour she should have seen at her feet the most abject adorer that ever kneeled to justly offended beauty  What she bid you and what she  forbid  you to tell me the latter for  tender  considerations That she forgives me and that could she have made me a  good  man she could have made me a  happy  one That she even loved me At such a moment to own that she once loved me Never before loved any man That she prays for me That her last tear should be shed for me could she by it save a soul without  her  doomed to perditionO Belford Belford I cannot bear itWhat a dog what a devil have I been to so superlative a goodnessWhy does she not inveigh against meWhy does she not execrate meO the triumphant subduer Ever above meAnd now to leave me so infinitely below her  Marry and repair at any time  This wretch that I was was my plea to myself To give her a lowering sensibility to bring her down from among the stars which her beamy head was surrounded by that my wife so greatly above me might not too much despise meThis was part of my reptile envy owing to my  more  reptile apprehension of inferiorityYet from step to step from distress to distress to maintain her superiority and like the sun to break out upon me with the greater refulgence for the clouds that I had contrived to cast about herAnd now to escape me thusNo power left me to repair her wrongsNo alleviation to my selfreproachNo dividing of blame with her  Tell her O tell her Belford that her prayers and wishes her superlatively generous prayers and wishes  shall  not  be vain That I  can  and  do  repentand  long  have repentedTell her of my frequent deep remorsesIt was impossible that such remorse should not at last produce  effectual  remorsesYet she must not leave meShe must live if she would wish to have my contrition perfectFor what can despair produce  I WILL do everything you would have me do in the return of your letters You have infinitely obliged me by this last and by pressing for an admission for me tho' it succeeded not  Once more how could I be such a villain to so divine a creature Yet love her all the time as never man loved womanCurse upon my contriving genius Curse upon my intriguing head and upon my seconding heartTo sport with the same with the honour with the life of such an angel of a womanO my damn'd incredulityThat believing her to  be  a woman I must hope to  find  her a womanOn my incredulity that there could be such virtue virtue for  virtue  's sake in the Sex founded I my hope of succeeding with her  But say not Jack that she must leave us yetIf she recoverAnd if I can but reobtain her favour then indeed will life be life to meThe world never  saw  such an husband as I will make I will have no will but hers She shall conduct me in all my steps She shall open and direct my prospects and turn every motion of my heart as she pleases  You tell me in your letter that at eleven o'clock she had sweet rest and my servant acquaints me from Mrs Smith that she has had a good night What hopes does this fill me with I have given the fellow five guineas for his good news to be divided between him and his fellowservant  Dear dear Jack confirm this to me in thy nextFor Heaven's sake doTell the Doctor I will make him a present of a thousand guineas if he recover herAsk if a consultation be necessary  Adieu dear BelfordConfirm I beseech thee the hopes that now with sovereign gladness have taken possession of a heart that next to Hers is  Thine  LETTER L Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Wedn morn eight o'clock    Sept    YOUR servant arrived here before I was stirring I sent him to Smith's to inquire how the lady was and ordered him to call upon me when he came back I was pleased to hear she had had tolerable rest and as soon as I had dispatched him with the letter I had written overnight I went to attend her  I found her up and dress'd in a white satten nightgown Ever elegant but now more so than I had seen her for a week past her aspect serenely chearful  She mentioned the increased dimness of her eyes and the tremor which had invaded her limbs If this be dying said she there is nothing at all shocking in it My body hardly sensible of pain my mind at ease my intellects clear and perfect as ever What a good and gracious God have IFor this is what I always prayed for  I told her It was not so serene with you  There is not the same reason for it replied she 'Tis a choice comfort Mr Belford at the windingup of our short story to be able to say I have rather  suffered  injuries  myself  than  offered  them to  others  I bless God tho' I have been unhappy as the  world  deems it and once I thought more so than at present I do yet have I not wilfully made any one creature so I have no reason to grieve for anything but for the sorrow I have given my friends  But pray Mr Belford remember me in the best manner to my cousin Morden and desire him to comfort them and to tell them that all would have been the same had they accepted of my true penitence as I wish as and I trust the Almighty has done  I was called down It was to Harry who was just returned from Miss Howe's to whom he carried the lady's letter The stupid fellow being bid to make haste with it and return as soon as possible staid not till Miss Howe had it she being at the distance of five miles altho' Mrs Howe would have had him stay and sent a man and horse purposely with it to her daughter  Wednesday morning    o'Clock    THE poor lady is just recovered from a fainting fit which has left her at death's door Her late tranquility and freedom from pain seemed but a  lightening  as Mrs Lovick and Mrs Smith call it  By my faith Lovelace I had rather part with all the friends I have in the world than with this lady I never knew what a virtuous a holy friendship as I may call mine to her was before But to be so  new  to it and to be obliged to forego it so soon what an affliction Yet thank heaven I lose her not by  my own  faultBut 'twould be barbarous not to spare thee now  She has sent for the Divine who visited her before in order to pray with her  LETTER LI Mr  LOVELACE  To  J BELFORD  Esq  Kensington  Wednesday noon  LIKE Aesop's traveller thou blowest hot and cold life and death in the same breath with a view no doubt to distract me How familiarly dost thou use the words  dying dimness tremor  Never did any mortal ring so many changes on so few bells Thy true father I dare swear was a butcher or an undertaker by the delight thou seemest to take in scenes of horror and death Thy barbarous reflection that thou losest her not by thy own fault is never to be forgiven Thou hast but one way to atone for the torments thou givest me and that is by sending me word that she is better and will recover Whether it be true or not let me be told so and I will go abroad rejoicing and believing it and my wishes and imagination shall make out all the rest  If she live but one year that I may acquit myself  to  myself no matter for the world that her death is not owing to me I will compound for the rest  Will neither vows nor prayers save her I never prayed in my life put all the years of it together as I have done for this fortnight past And I have most sincerely repented of all my baseness to herAnd will nothing do  But after all if she recover not this reflection must be my comfort and it is  truth  That her departure will be owing rather to wilfulness to downright female wilfulness than to any other cause  It is difficult for people who pursue the dictates of a violent resentment to stop where first they designed to stop  I have the charity to believe that even James and Arabella Harlowe at first intended no more by the confederacy they formed against this their angel sister than to disgrace and keep her down lest sordid wretches their uncles should follow the example her grandfather had set to  their  detriment  Many a man who at first intended only to try if a girl would resent a petty freedom finding himself unchecked or only lightly and laughingly put by has been encouraged to attempt the last point and has triumphed where once he presumed not to make the most distant approach but with fear and trembling and previous study how to come off in case of a high resentment  To bring these illustrations home This lady I suppose in her resentment intended only at first to vex and plague me and finding she could do it to purpose her desire of revenge became stronger in her than the desire of life and now she is willing to die as an event which she supposes will cut my heartstrings asunder And still the more to be revenged puts on the Christian and forgives me  But I'll have none of her forgiveness My own heart tells me I do not deserve it and I cannot bear itAnd what is it but a mere  verbal  forgiveness as ostentatiously as cruelly given with a view to magnify herself and wound me deeper A little dear speciousBut let me stoplest I blaspheme  READING over the above I am ashamed of my ramblings But what wouldst have me doSee'st thou not that I am but seeking to run out of myself in hope to lose myself yet that I am unable to do either  If  ever  thou lovedst but half so fervently as I loveBut of that thy heavy soul is not capable  Send me word by thy next I conjure thee in the names of all her kindred saints and angels that she is living and  likely to liveIf thou sendest ill news thou wilt be answerable for the consequence whether it be fatal to the messenger or to  Thy  LOVELACE  LETTER LII Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Wednesday    o'Clock    DR H has just been here He tarried with me till the minister had done praying by the lady and then we were both admitted Mr Goddard who came while the doctor and the clergyman were with her went away with them when they went They took a solemn and everlasting leave of her as I have no scruple to say blessing her and being blessed by her and wishing when it came to be their lot for an exit as happy as hers is likely to be  She had again earnestly requested of the doctor his opinion how long it was  now  probable that she could continue And he told her that he apprehended she would hardly see tomorrow night She said She should number the hours with greater pleasure than ever she numbered any in her life on the most joyful occasion  How unlike poor Belton's last hours hers See the infinite difference in the effects on the same awful and affecting occasion between a good and a bad conscience  This moment a man is come from Miss Howe with a letter Perhaps I shall be able to send you the contents  SHE endeavoured several times with earnestness but in vain to read the letter of her dear friendThe writing she said was too fine for her grosser sight and the lines staggered under her eye And indeed she trembled so she could not hold the paper And at last desired Mrs Lovick to read it to her the messenger waiting for an answer  Thou wilt see in Miss Howe's letter how different the expression of the same impatiency and passionate love is when dictated by the gentler mind of a woman from that which results from a mind so boisterous and knotty as  thine For Mrs Lovick will transcribe it and I shall send itTo be read in this place if thou wilt  Miss  HOWE  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Tuesday Sept    O my dearest friend  WHAT will become of your poor Anna Howe I see by your writing as well as read by your own account which were you not very  very  ill you would have touched more tenderly how it is with youWhy have I thus long delayed to attend youCould I think that the comfortings of a faithful friend were as nothing to a gentle mind in distress that I could be prevailed upon to forbear visiting you so much as  once  in all this timeI as well as everybody else to desert and abandon my dear creature to strangersWhat will become of me if you be as bad as my apprehensions make you  I will set out this moment little as the encouragement is that you give me to do soMy mother is willing I shouldWhy O why was she not  before  willing  Yet she persuades me too lest I should be fatally affected were I to find my fears too well justified to wait the return of this messenger who rides our swiftest horseGod speed him with good news to meElseBut Oh my dearest dearest friend what elseOne line from your hand by himSend me but  one  line to bid me attend youI will set out the moment the very moment I receive itI am now actually ready to do soAnd if you love me as I love you the sight of me will revive you to my hopes But why why when I can think this did I not go up sooner  Blessed heaven deny not to my prayers my friend my monitress my adviser at a time so critical to myself  But methinks your stile and sentiments are too well connected too full of life and vigor to give cause for so much despair as the staggering pen seems to threaten  I am sorry I was not at home I  must  add thus much tho' the servant is ready mounted at the door when Mr Belford's servant came with your affecting letter I was at Miss Lloyd's My mamma sent it to me and I came home that instant But he was gone He would not stay it seems Yet I wanted to ask him an hundred thousand  questions But why delay I thus my messenger I have a multitude of things to say to you To advise with you about You shall direct me in every thing I will obey the holding up of your finger But if  you  leave mewhat is the world or any thing in it to  Your  ANNA HOWE  The effect this letter had on the lady who is so near the end which the fair writer so much apprehends and deplores obliged Mrs Lovick to make many breaks in reading it and many changes of voice  This  is  a friend said the divine lady taking the letter in her hand and kissing it worth wishing to live forO my dear Anna Howe How uninterruptedly sweet and noble has been our friendshipBut we shall one day I hope and that must comfort us both meet never to part again Then divested of the shades of body shall we be all light and all mindThen how unalloyed how perfect will be our friendship Our Love then will have one and the same adorable object and we shall enjoy it and each other to all Eternity  She said her dear friend was so earnest for a line or two that she would fain write if she could And she tried but to no purpose She could dictate however she believed and desired Mrs Lovick would take pen and paper Which she did and then she dictated to  her  I would have withdrawn but at her desire staid  She wandered a good deal at firstShe took notice that she didAnd when she got into a little train not pleasing herself she apologized to Mrs Lovick for making her begin again and again and said That third time should go let it be as it would  She dictated the farewel part without hesitation and when she came to the blessing and subscription she took the pen and dropping on her knees supported by Mrs Lovick wrote the conclusion but Mrs Lovick was forced to guide her hand  You will find the sense surprizingly intire her weakness considered  I made the messenger wait while I transcribed it I have endeavoured to imitate the subscriptive part  Wedn near    o'Clock    My dearest Miss Howe  YOU must not be surprizednor grievedthat Mrs Lovick writes for me Altho' I cannot obey you and write with my  pen  yet my  heart  writes by hersAccept it soIt is the nearest to obedience I can  And now what  ought  I to say What  can  I sayBut why should you not know the truth Since soon you mustvery soon  Know then and let your tears be those if of pity of  joyful  pity for I permit you to shed a few to imbalm as I may say a fallen blossomKnow then that the good doctor and the pious clergyman and the worthy apothecary have just now with joint benedictions taken their last leave of me And the former bids me hopeDo my dearest let me say  ope  for my enlargement before tomorrow sunset  Adieu therefore my dearest friend Be this your consolation as it is mine that in God's good time we shall meet in a blessed Eternity never more to partOnce more then adieu and be happyWhich a generous nature cannot be unless to its power it makes others so too  God for ever bless you prays dropt on my bended Knees altho' supported upon them  Your Grateful Obliged Affectionate Clar Harlowe  When I had transcribed and sealed this letter by her direction I gave it to the messenger myself who told me that Miss Howe waited for nothing but his return to set out for London  Thy servant is just come so I will close here Thou art a merciless master The two fellows are  battered  to death by thee to usea female word and all female words tho' we are not sure of their derivation have very significant meanings I believe in their hearts they wish the angel in the heaven that is ready to receive her and thee at thy proper place that there might be an end of their  flurries  another word of the same gender  What a letter hast thou sent mePoor Lovelaceis all the answer I will return  Five o' clock  Colonel Morden is this moment arrived  LETTER LIII Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Eight in the Evening  I Had but just time in my former to tell you that Colonel Morden was arrived He was on horseback attended by two servants and alit at the door just as the clock struck five Mrs Smith was then below in her backshop weeping her husband with her who was as much affected as she Mrs Lovick having left them a little before in tears likewise for they had been bemoaning one another joining in opinion that the admirable lady would not live the night over She had told them it was  her  opinion too from some numbnesses which she called the forerunners of death and from an increased inclination to doze  The Colonel as Mrs Smith told me afterwards asked with great impatience the moment he alit how Miss Harlowe was She answered Alive but she feared drawing on apace Good God said he with his hands and eyes lifted up Can I see her My name is Morden I have the honour to be nearly related to her Step up pray and let her know She is sensible I hope that I am here Who is with her  Nobody but her Nurse and Mrs Lovick a widow gentlewoman who is as careful of her as if she were her mother  And  more  careful too interrupted he or she is not careful at all  Except a gentleman be with her one Mr Belford continued Mrs Smith who has been the best friend she has had  If Mr Belford be with her surely I mayBut pray step up and let Mr Belford know that I shall take it for a favour to speak with him first  Mrs Smith came up to me in my new apartment I had but just dispatched your servant and was asking her nurse if I might be again admitted who answered that  she was dozing in the elbowchair having refused to lie down saying She should soon she hoped lie down for good  The Colonel who is really a fine gentleman received me with great politeness After the first compliments My kinswoman Sir said he is more obliged to you than to any of her own family For my part I have been endeavouring to move so many rocks in her favour and little thinking the dear creature so very bad have neglected to attend her as I ought to have done the moment I arrived and  would  had I known how ill she was and what a task I should have had with the family But Sir your friend has been excessively to blame and you being so  intimately  his friend has made her fare the worse for your civilities to her But is there no hope of her recovery  The doctors have left her with the melancholy declaration that there is none  Has she had good attendance Sir A skilful physician I hear these good folks have been very civil and obliging to her  Who could be otherwise said Mrs Smith weeping She is the sweetest lady in the world  The character said the Colonel lifting up his eyes and one hand that she has from every living creatureGood God How could your accursed friend  And how could her cruel parents interrupted IWe may as easily account for  him  as for  them    Too true returned he the vileness of the profligates of our sex considered whenever they can get any of the other into their power  I satisfied him about the care that had been taken of her and told him of the friendly and even  paternal  attendance she had had from Dr H and Mr Goddard  He was impatient to attend her having not seen her as he said since she was twelve years old and that then she gave promises of being one of the finest women in England  She  was  so replied I a very few months ago And tho' emaciated she will appear to you to have confirmed those promises For her features are so regular and exact her proportion so fine and her manner so inimitably  graceful that were she only skin and bone she must be a beauty  Mrs Smith at his request stept up and brought us down word that Mrs Lovick and her Nurse were with her and that she was in so sound a sleep leaning upon the former in her elbowchair that she neither heard her enter the room nor go out The Colonel begged if not improper that he might see her tho' sleeping He said That his impatience would not let him stay till she awaked Yet he would not have her disturbed and should be glad to contemplate her sweet features when she saw not him and asked If she thought he could not go in and come out without disturbing her  She believ'd he might she answer'd for her chair's back was towards the door  He said He would take care to withdraw if she awoke that his sudden appearance might not surprise her  Mrs Smith stepping up before us bid Mrs Lovick and the Nurse not stir when we entered And then we went up softly together  We beheld the lady in a charming attitude Dressed as I told you before in her virgin white she was sitting in her elbowchair Mrs Lovick close by her in another chair with her left arm round her neck supporting it as it were for it seems the lady had bid her do so saying She had been a Mother to her and she would delight herself in thinking she was in her Mamma's arms for she found herself drowsy perhaps she said for the last time she should ever be so  One faded cheek rested upon the good woman's bosom the kindly warmth of which had overspread it with a faint but charming flush the other paler and hollow as if already iced over by death Her hands white as the lily with her meandring veins more transparently blue than ever I had seen even hers veins so soon alas to be choaked up by the congealment of that purple stream which already so languidly creeps rather than flows thro' them her hands hanging lifelesly one before her the other grasped by the righthand of the kind widow whose tears bedew'd the sweet face which her motherly bosom supported though unfelt by the fair sleeper and either insensibly to the good woman or what she would not disturb  her to wipe off or to change her posture Her aspect was sweetly calm and serene And tho' she started nowandthen yet her sleep seemed easy her breath indeed short and quick but tolerably free and not like that of a dying person  In this heartmoving attitude she appeared to us when we approached her and came to have her lovely face before us  The Colonel sighing often gazed upon her with his arms folded and with the most profound and affectionate attention till at last on her starting and fetching her breath with greater difficulty than before he retired to a screen that was drawn before her  house  as she calls it which as I have heretofore observed stands under one of the windows This screen was placed there at the time she found herself obliged to take to her chamber and in the depth of our concern and the fulness of other discourse at our first interview I had forgotten to apprise the Colonel of what he would probably see  Retiring thither he drew out his handkerchief and drowned in grief seemed unable to speak But on casting his eye behind the screen he soon broke silence for struck with the shape of the coffin he lifted up a purplishcoloured cloth that was spread over it and starting back Good God said he what's here  Mrs Smith standing next him Why said he with great emotion is my cousin suffered to indulge her sad reflections with such an object before her  Alas Sir reply'd the good woman who should controul her We are all strangers about her in a manner And yet we have expostulated with her upon this sad occasion  I ought said I stepping softly up to him the lady again falling into a doze to have apprised you of this I was here when it was brought in and never was so shocked in my life But she had none of her friends about her and no reason to hope for any of them to come near her and assured she should not recover she was resolved to leave as little as possible especially as to what related to her person to her executor But it is not a shocking object to her tho' it be to every body else  Curse upon the hardheartedness of those said he who occasion'd her to make so sad a provision for herself What must her reflections have been all the time she was thinking of it and giving orders about it And what must they be every time she turns her head towards it These uncommon genius'sBut indeed she  should  have been controuled in it had I been here  The lady fetched a profound sigh and starting it broke off our talk and the Colonel then withdrew further behind the screen that his sudden appearance might not surprise her  Where am I said she How drowsy I am How long have I dozed Don't go Sir for I was retiring I am very stupid and shall be more and more so I suppose  She then offered to raise herself but being ready to faint thro' weakness was forced to sit down again reclining her head on her chairback and after a few moments I believe now my good friends said she all your kind trouble will soon be over I have slept but am not refreshed and my fingers ends seem numb'dhave no feeling holding them up'Tis time to send the letter to my good Mrs Norton  Shall I Madam send my servant post with it  O no Sir I thank you It will reach the dear woman too soon as she will think by the post  I told her this was not postday  Is it Wednesday still said she Bless me I know not how the time goes But very tediously 'tis plain And now I think I must soon take to my bed All will be most conveniently and with least trouble over thereWill it not Mrs LovickI think Sir turning to me I have left nothing to these last incapacitating hours Nothing either to say or to do I bless God I have not If I  had  how unhappy should I be Can you Sir remind me of any thing necessary to be done or said to make your office easy  If Madam your cousin Morden should come you would be glad to see him I presume  I am too weak to wish to see my cousin now It would but discompose me and him too Yet if he come while I  can  see I will see him were it but to thank him for  former favours and for his present kind intentions to me Has any body been here from him  He has called and will be here Madam in half an hour but he feared to surprise you  Nothing can surprise me now except my Mamma were to favour me with her last blessing in person That would be a welcome surprise to me even yet But did my Cousin come purposely to town to see me  Yes Madam I took the liberty to let him know by a line last Monday how ill you were  You are very kind Sir I am and have been greatly obliged to you But I think I shall be pained to see him now because he will be concerned to see me And yet as I am not so ill as I shall presently bethe sooner he comes the better But if he come what shall I do about that screen He will chide me very probably and I cannot bear chiding now Perhaps leaning upon Mrs Lovick and Mrs Smith I can walk into the next apartment to receive him  She motion'd to rise but was ready to faint again and forced to sit still  The Colonel was in a perfect agitation behind the screen to hear this discourse and twice unseen by his cousin was coming from it towards her but retreated for fear of surprising her too much  I stept to him and favoured his retreat she only saying Are you going Mr Belford Are you sent for down Is my Cousin come For she heard somebody step softly cross the room and thought it me her hearing being more perfect than her sight  I told her I believed he was and she said We must make the best of it Mrs Lovick and Mrs Smith I shall otherwise most grievously shock my poor cousin For he loved me dearly once Pray give me a few of the doctor's last drops in water to keep up my spirits for this one interview and that is all I believe that can concern me now  The Colonel who heard all this sent in his name and I pretending to go down to him introduced the afflicted gentleman she having first ordered the screen to be put as close to the window as possible that he might not see  what was behind it while he having heard what she had said about it was determined to take no notice of it  He folded the angel in his arms as she sat dropping down on one knee for supporting herself upon the two elbows of the chair she attempted to rise but could not Excuse my dear Cousin said she excuse me that I cannot stand upI did not expect this favour now But I am glad of this opportunity to thank you for all your generous goodness to me  I never my best beloved and dearest cousin said he with eyes running over shall forgive myself that I did not attend you sooner Little did I think you were so ill nor do any of your friends believe it If they did  If they did  repeated she interrupting him I should have had more compassion from them I am sure I should But pray Sir how did you leave them Are  you  reconciled to them If you are not I beg if you love your poor Clarissa that you will For every widen'd difference augments but my fault since  that  is the foundation of all  I had been expecting to hear from them in your favour my dear cousin said he for some hours when this gentleman's letter arrived which hastened me up But I have the account of your grandfather's estate to make up with you and have bills and draughts upon their banker for the sums due to you which they desire you may receive lest you should have occasion for money And this is such an earnest of an approaching reconciliation that I dare to answer for all the rest being according to your wishes if  Ah Sir interrupted she with frequent breaks and pauses I wish I wish this does not rather shew that were I to live they would have nothing more to say to me I never had any pride in being independent of them All my actions when I might have made myself  more  independent shew thisBut what avail these reflections nowI only beg Sir that You and  this  gentlemanto whom I am exceedingly obligedwill adjust those mattersaccording to the will I have written Mr Belford will excuse me but it was in truth more necessity than choice that made me think of giving him the trouble he so kindly accepts Had I had the happiness to see you my cousin sooneror to know that you still honoured me with your  regardI should not have had the assurance to ask this favour of  him  Buttho' the friend of Mr Lovelace he is a man of honour and he will make peace rather than break it And my dear cousin let me beg of youto contribute your part to itand remember that while I have nearer relations than my cousin Morden dear as you are and always were to me you have no title to avenge my wrongs upon Him who has been the occasion of them But I wrote to you my mind on this subject and my reasons and hope I need not further urge them  I must do Mr Lovelace so much justice answered he wiping his eyes as to witness how sincerely he repents him of his ingrateful baseness to you and how ready he is to make you all the amends in his power He owns  his  wickedness and  your  merit If he did not I could not pass it over tho' you  have  nearer relations For my dear cousin did not your grandfather leave me in trust for you And should I think myself concerned for your fortune and not for your honourBut since he is so desirous to do you justice I have the less to say and you may make yourself intirely easy on that account  I thank you thank you Sir said she All is now as I wished But I am very faint very low I am sorry I cannot hold up that I cannot better deserve the honour of this visit But it will not beAnd saying this she sunk down in her chair and was silent  Hereupon we both withdrew leaving word that we would be at the BedfordHead if any thing extraordinary happened  We bespoke a little repast having neither of us dined and while it was getting ready you may guess at the subject of our discourse Both joined in lamentation for the lady's desperate state Admired her manifold excellencies Severely condemned you and her friends Yet to bring him into better opinion of you I read to him some passages from your last letters which shew'd your concern for the wrongs you had done her and your deep remorse And he said It was a dreadful thing to labour under the sense of a guilt so irremediable  We procured Mr Goddard Dr H being not at home once more to visit her and to call upon us in his return  He was so good as to do so but he tarried with her not five minutes and told us That she was drawing on apace that he feared she would not live till morning and that she wished to see Colonel Morden directly  The Colonel made excuses where none were needed and tho' our little refection was just brought in he went away immediately  I could not touch a morsel and took pen and ink to amuse myself and oblige you knowing how impatient you would be for a few lines For from what I have recited you will see it was impossible I could withdraw to write when your servant came at half an hour after five or have an opportunity for it till now and  This  is accidental And yet your poor fellow was afraid to go away with the verbal message I sent importing as no doubt he told you that the Colonel was with us the Lady excessively ill and that I could not stir to write a line  Ten o'clock  THE Colonel sent to me afterwards that the lady having been in convulsions he was so much disordered that he could not possibly attend me  I have sent every half hour to know how she does And just now I have the pleasure to hear that her convulsions have left her and that she is gone to rest in a much quieter way than could be expected  Her poor cousin is very much indisposed yet will not stir out of the house while she is in such a way but intends to lie down on a couch having refused any other accommodation  LETTER LIV Mr  BELFORD  In Continuation  Soho  Six o'clock Sept    THE Lady is still alive The Colonel having just sent his servant to let me know that she inquired after me about an hour ago I am dressing to attend her Joel begs of me to dispatch him back tho' but with one line to gratify your present impatience He expects he says to find you at Knightsbridge let him make what haste he can back and if he has not a line or  two to pacify you he is afraid you will pistol him for he apprehends that you are hardly yourself I therefore dispatch this and will have another ready as soon as I can with particulars But you must have a little patience for how can I withdraw every half hour to write if I am admitted to the Lady's presence or if I am with the Colonel  Smith's      o'clock in the morning    THE Lady is in a slumber Mrs Lovick who sat up with her says she had a better night than was expected for altho' she slept little she seemed easy and the easier for the pious frame she was in all her waking moments being taken up in devotion or in an ejaculatory silence her hands and eyes often lifted up and her lips moving with a fervor worthy of these her last hours  Ten o'clock  THE Colonel being earnest to see his cousin as soon as she awaked we were both admitted We observed in her as soon as we entered strong symptoms of her approaching dissolution notwithstanding what the women had flattered us with from her last night's tranquility The Colonel and I each loth to say what we thought looked upon one another with melancholy countenances  The Colonel told her He should send a servant to her uncle Antony's for some papers he had left there and asked If she had any commands that wayShe thought not she said speaking more inwardly than she did the day before She had indeed a letter ready to be sent to her good Mrs Norton and there was a request intimated in it But it was time enough if it were signified to those whom it concerned when all was over However it might be sent then by the servant who was going that way And she caused it to be given to the Colonel for that purpose  Her breath being very short she desired another pillow and having two before this made her in a manner sit up in her bed and she spoke then with more distinctness and seeing us greatly concerned forgot her own sufferings to comfort us and a charming lecture she gave us tho' a brief one upon the happiness of a timely prepatation and upon the hazards of a late repentance when the mind as she observed was so much weakened as  well as the body as to render a poor soul unable to contend with its own infirmities  I beseech ye my good friends proceeded she mourn not for one who mourns not nor has cause to mourn for herself On the contrary rejoice with me that all my worldly troubles are so near their end Believe me Sirs that I would not if I might choose to live altho' the pleasantest part of my life were to come over again And yet Eighteen years of it out of Nineteen have been  very  pleasant To be so much exposed to temptation and to be so liable to fail in the trial who would not rejoice that all her dangers are overAll I wished was pardon and blessing from my dear parents Easy as my departure seems to promise to be it would have been still easier had I had that pleasure BUT GOD ALMIGHTY WOULD NOT LET ME DEPEND FOR COMFORT UPON ANY BUT HIMSELF  She then repeated her request in the most earnest manner to her  cousin  that he would not  heighten  her fault by seeking to avenge her death to  me  that I would endeavour to make up all breaches and use the power I had with my friend to prevent all future mischiefs  from  him as well as that which this trust might give me to prevent any  to  him  She made some excuses to her  cousin  for having not been able to alter her will to join him in the executorship with me and to  me  for the trouble she had given and yet should give me  She had fatigued herself so much growing sensibly weaker that she sunk her head upon her pillows ready to faint and we withdrew to the window looking upon one another but could not tell what to say and yet both seemed inclinable to speak But the motion passed over in silence Our eyes only spoke and that in a manner neither's were used to mine at least not till I knew this admirable creature  The Colonel withdrew to dismiss his messenger and send away the letter to Mrs Norton I took the opportunity to retire likewise and to write thus far And Joel returning to take it I now close here  Eleven o' Clock  LETTER LV Mr  BELFORD  In Continuation  THE Colonel tells me That he has written to Mr John Harlowe by his servant  'That they might spare themselves the trouble of debating about a reconciliation for that his dear cousin would probably be no more before they could resolve'  He asked me after his cousin's means of subsisting and whether she had accepted of any favour from  me  He was sure he said she would not from  you    I acquainted him with the truth of her parting with some of her apparel This wrung his heart and bitterly did he exclaim as well against you as against her implacable relations  He wished he had not come to England at all or had come time enough and hoped I would apprize him of the whole mournful story at a proper season He added that he had thoughts when he came over of fixing here for the remainder of his days But now as it was impossible his cousin could recover he would go abroad again and resettle himself at Florence or Leghorn  THE lady has been giving orders with great presence of mind about her body directing her nurse and the maid of the house to put her into her coffin as soon as she was cold Mr Belford she said would know the rest by her will  SHE has just now given from her bosom where she always wore it a miniature picture set in gold of Miss Howe She gave it to Mrs Lovick desiring her to fold it up in white paper and direct it  To Charles Hickman  Esq  and to give it to me when she was departed for that gentleman  She looked upon the picture before she gave it her  Sweet and everamiable friendcompanionsisterlover  said sheAnd kissed it four several times once at each tender appellation  YOUR other servant is comeWell may you be impatientWell may youBut do you think I can leave off in the middle of a conversation to run and set down what offers and send it away piecemeal as I writeIf I  could  must I not lose one half while I put down the other  This event is nearly as interesting to  me  as it is to  you  If you are more grieved than I there can be but one reason for it and that's at your heart I had rather lose all the friends I have in the world yourself included than this divine lady and shall be unhappy when ever I think of her sufferings and her merit tho' I have nothing to reproach myself upon the former  I say not this just now so much to reflect upon you as to express my own grief tho' your conscience I suppose will make you think otherwise  Your poor fellow who says that he begs for  his life  in desiring to be dispatched back with a letter tears this from me Else perhaps for I am just sent for down a quarter of an hour would make younot  easy  indeedbut  certain  And that in a  state  like yours to a  mind  like yours is a relief  Thursday afternoon    o'Clock    LETTER LVI Mr  BELFORD  To  RICHARD MOWBRAY  Esq  Thursday afternoon  Dear  Mowbray  I AM glad to hear you are in town Throw yourself the moment this comes to your hand if possible with Tourville in the way of the man who least of all men deserves the love of the worthy heart but most That of Thine and His Else the news I shall most probably send him within an hour or two will make annihilation the greatest blessing he has to wish for  You will find him between Piccadilly and Kensington most probably on horseback riding backwards and forwards in a crazy way or put up perhaps at some inn or tavern in the way a waiter possibly if so watching for his servant's return to him from me  His man Will is just come to me He will carry this to you in his way back and be your director Hie away in a coach or any how Your being with him may save either his or a servant's life See the blessed effects of triumphant libertinism Sooner or later it comes home to us and all concludes in gall and bitterness Adieu  J BELFORD  LETTER LVII Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  CURSE upon the Colonel and curse upon the writer of the last letter I received and upon all the world Thou to pretend to be as much interested in my Clarissa's fate as myself 'Tis well for one of us that this was not said to me instead of writtenLiving or dying she is mineand only mine Have I not earned her

LVIII Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Seven o'Clock Thursday Even Sept    I HAVE only to say at presentThou wilt do well to take a tour to Paris or whereever else thy destiny shall lead thee  JOHN BELFORD  LETTER LIX Mr  MOWBRAY  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Uxbridge  Sept    between    and    at night    Dear Jack  I SEND by poor Lovelace's desire for  particulars  of the fatal breviate thou sentest him this night He cannot bear to set pen to paper yet wants to know every minute passage of Miss Harlowe's departure Yet why he should I cannot see for if she is gone she is gone and who can help it  I never heard of such a woman in my life What great matters has she suffered that grief should kill her thus  I wish the poor fellow had never known her From first to last what trouble has she cost him The charming fellow has been half lost to us ever since he pursued her And what is there in one woman more than another for matter of that  It was well we were with him when your Note came You shewed your true friendship in your foresight Why Jack the poor fellow was quite beside himselfMad as any man ever was in Bedlam  Will brought him the letter just after we had joined him at the BohemiaHead where he had left word at the Rose at Knightsbridge he should be for he had been sauntering up and down backwards and forwards expecting us and his fellow Will as soon as he delivered it got out of his way and when he opened it never was such a piece of scenery He trembled like a devil at receiving it Fumbled at the seal his fingers in a palsy like Tom Doleman's his hand shake shake shake that  he tore the letter in two before he could come at the contents And when he had read them off went his hat to one corner of the room his wig to the otherDamnation seize the world and a whole volley of suchlike  execratious  wishes running up and down the room and throwing up the sash and pulling it down and smiting his forehead with his double fist with such force as would have felled an ox and stamping and tearing that the landlord ran in and faster out again And this was the distractionscene for some time  In vain was all Jemmy or I could say to him I offered once to take hold of his hands because he was going to do himself a mischief as I believed looking about for his pistols which he had laid upon the table but which Will unseen had taken out with him a faithful honest dog that Will I shall for ever love the fellow for it and he hit me a damned dowse of the chops as made my nose bleed 'Twas well 'twas he for I hardly knew how to take it  Jemmy raved at him and told him How wicked it was in him to be so brutish to abuse a friend and run mad for a woman And then he said he was sorry for it and then Will ventured in with water and a towel and the dog rejoiced as I could see by his looks that I  had it  rather than he  And so by degrees we brought him a little to his reason and he promised to behave more like a man And so I forgave him And we rode on in the dark to here at Doleman's And we all try'd to shame him out of his mad ungovernable foolishness For we told him as how she was but a woman and an obstinate perverse woman too and how could he help it  And you know Jack As we told him moreover that it was a shame to manhood for a man who had served twenty and twenty women as bad or worse let him have served Miss Harlowe never so bad should give himself such  obstropulous  airs because she would die And we advised him never to attempt a woman proud of her character and  virtue  as they call it any more For why The conquest did not pay trouble and what was there in  one woman more than another Hay you know JackAnd thus we comforted him and advised him  But yet his damned addled pate runs upon this lady as much now she's dead as it did when she was living For I suppose Jack it is no joke She is certainly and  bona fide  dead i'n't she If not thou deservest to be doubly damned for thy fooling I tell thee that So he will have me write for particulars of her  departure    He won't bear the word  dead  on any account A squeamish puppy How Love unmans and softens and enervates And such a  noble  fellow as this too Rot him for an idiot and an oaf I have no patience with the foolish  duncical  dogUpon my soul I have not  So send the account and let him howl over it as I suppose he will  But he must and shall go abroad And in a month or two Jemmy and you and I will join him and he'll soon get the better of this chickenhearted folly never fear and will then be ashamed of himself And then we'll not spare him tho'  now  poor fellow it were pity to lay him on so thick as he deserves And do thou till then spare all reflections upon him for it seems thou hast  worked  him unmercifully  I was willing to give thee some account of the hand we have had with the tearing fellow who had certainly been a lost man had we not been with him or he would have killed somebody or otherI have no doubt of it And  now  he is but very middling sits grinning like a man in straw curses and swears and is confounded gloomy and creeps into holes and corners like an old hedghog hunted for his grease And so adieu Jack Tourville and all of us wish for thee for no one has the influence upon him that thou hast  R MOWBRAY  As I promised him that I would write for the particulars abovesaid I write this after all are gone to bed and the fellow is to set out with it by daybreak  LETTER LX Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Thursdaynight  I MAY as well try to write since were I to go to bed I shall not sleep I never had such a weight of grief upon my mind in my life as upon the demise of this admirable woman whose soul is now rejoicing in the regions of light  You may be glad to know the particulars of her happy exit I will try to proceed for all is hush and still the family retired but not one of them and least of all her poor cousin I dare say to rest  At four o'clock as I mentioned in my last I was sent for down and as thou usedst to like my descriptions I will give thee the woeful scene that presented itself to me as I approached the bed  The Colonel was the first that took my attention kneeling on the side of the bed the lady's righthand in both his which his face covered bathing it with his tears altho' she had been comforting him as the women since told him in elevated strains but broken accents  On the other side of the bed sat the good Widow her face overwhelmed with tears leaning her head against the bed's head in a most disconsolate manner and turning her face to me as soon as she saw me O Mr Belford cried she with folded handsThe dear ladya heavy sob not permitting her to say more  Mrs Smith with clasped fingers and uplifted eyes as if imploring help from the Only Power which could give it was kneeling down at the bed's feet tears in large drops trickling down her cheeks  Her Nurse was kneeling between the widow and Mrs Smith her arms extended In one hand she held an ineffectual cordial which she had just been offering to her dying mistress her face was swoln with weeping tho' used to such scenes as this and she turned her eyes towards me as if she called upon me by them to join in the helpless sorrow a fresh stream bursting from them as I approached the bed  The maid of the house with her face upon her folded arms as she stood leaning against the wainscot more audibly expressed her grief than any of the others  The lady had been silent a few minutes and speechless as they thought moving her lips without uttering a word one hand as I said in her cousin's But when Mrs Lovick on my approach pronounced my name Oh Mr Belford said she in broken periods and with a faint inward voice but very distinct neverthelessNowNowI bless God for his mercies to his poor creature will all soon be overA fewA very few momentswill end this strifeAnd I shall be happy  Comfort here Sirturning her head to the ColonelComfort my cousinSeethe blameable kindnessHe would not wish me to be happyso  soon  Here she stopt for two or three minutes earnestly looking upon him Then resuming My dearest cousin said she be comfortedWhat is dying but the common lotThe mortal frame may  seem  to labourBut that is allIt is not so hard to die as I believed it to beThe preparation is the difficultyI bless God I have had time for ThatThe rest is worse to beholders than to meI am all blessed hopeHope itself  She  looked  what she said a sweet smile beaming over her countenance  After a short silence Once more my dear cousin said she but still in broken accents commend me most dutifully to my Father and MotherThere she stopt And then proceedingTo my Sister To my Brother To my UnclesAnd tell them I bless them with my parting breathfor all their goodness to meEven for their displeasure I bless themMost happy has been to me my punishment hereHappy indeed  She was silent for a few moments lifting up her eyes and the hand her cousin held not between his Then  O death  said she  where is thy sting  The words I remember to have heard in the Burialservice read over my Uncle and poor Belton And after a pause  It is good for me that I was afflicted  Words of Scripture I suppose  Then turning towards us who were lost in speechless sorrowO dear  dear  gentlemen said she you know not  what  foretastes  what  assurances  And there she again stopt and looked up as if in a thankful rapture sweetly smiling  Then turning her head towards meDo  you  Sir tell your friend that I forgive him And I pray to God to forgive himAgain pausing and lifting up her eyes as if praying that He wouldLet him know how happily I dieAnd that such as my own I wish to be his last hour  She was again silent for a few moments And then resumingMy sight fails meYour voices onlyfor we both applauded her christian her divine frame tho' in accents as broken as her own And the voice of grief is alike in all Is not this Mr Morden's hand pressing one of his with that he had just let go Which is Mr Belford's holding out the other I gave her mine God Almighty bless you both said she and make you bothin your last hourfor you  must  come to thishappy as I am  She paused again her breath growing shorter and after a few minutes And now my dearest cousin give me your handnearerstill nearerdrawing it towards her and she pressed it with her dying lipsGod protect you dear dear SirAnd once more receive my best and most grateful thanksAnd tell my dear Miss Howeand vouchsafe to see and to tell my worthy Mrs NortonShe will be one day I fear not tho' now lowly in her fortunes a Saint in HeavenTell them both that I remember them with thankful blessings in my last momentsAnd pray God to give them happiness here for many many years for the sake of their friends and lovers and an heavenly crown hereafter and such assurances of it as I have thro' the allsatisfying merits of my blessed Redeemer  Her sweet voice and broken periods methinks still fill my ears and never will be out of my memory  After a short silence in a more broken and faint accentAnd you Mr Belford pressing my hand may God preserve you and make you sensible of all your errorsYou see in me how All endsMay  you  beAnd down sunk her head upon her pillow she fainting away and drawing from us her hands  We thought she was then gone and each gave way to a violent burst of grief  But soon shewing signs of returning life our attention was again engaged and I besought her when a little recovered to complete in my favour her halfpronounced blessing She waved her hand to us both and bowed her head six several times as we have since recollected as if distinguishing every person present not forgetting the nurse and the maidservant the latter having approached the bed weeping as if crowding in for the divine lady's last blessing and she spoke faltering and inwardlyBlessblessblessyou AllAnd nowAnd nowholding up her almost lifeless hands for the last time ComeO comeBlessed LordJESUS  And with these words the last but halfpronounced expired Such a smile such a charming serenity overspreading her sweet face at the instant as seemed to manifest her eternal happiness already begun  O LovelaceBut I can write no more  I RESUME my pen to add a few lines  While warm tho' pulseless we pressed each her hand with our lips and then retired into the next room  We looked at each other with intent to speak But as if one motion governed as one cause affected both we turned away silent  The Colonel sighed as if his heart would burst At last his face and hands uplifted his back towards me Good Heaven said he to himself support meAnd is it thus O Flower of NatureThen pausingAnd must we no more  Never more  My blessed blessed cousin uttering some other words which his sighs made inarticulateAnd then as if recollecting himselfForgive me SirExcuse me Mr Belford and sliding by me anon I hope to see you SirAnd down stairs he went and out of the house leaving me a statue  When I recovered myself it was almost to repine at what I  then  called an unequal dispensation forgetting her happy preparation and still happier departure and that she had but drawn a common lot triumphing in it and leaving behind her every one less assured of happiness  tho' equally certain that it would one day be their own lot  She departed exactly at minutes after o'clock as by her watch on the table  And thus died Miss CLARISSA HARLOWE in the blossom of her youth and beauty And who her tender years considered has not left behind her her superior in extensive knowlege and watchful prudence nor hardly her equal for unblemished virtue exemplary piety sweetness of manners discreet generosity and true christian charity And these all set off by the most graceful modesty and humility yet on all proper occasions manifesting a noble presence of mind and true magnanimity So that she may be said to have been not only an ornament to her Sex but to Human nature  A better pen than mine may do her fuller justiceThine I mean O Lovelace For well dost thou know how much she excelled in the graces both of mind and person natural and acquired all that is woman And thou also canst best account for the causes of her immature death thro' those calamities which in so short a space of time from the highest pitch of felicity every one in a manner adoring her brought her to an exit so happy for herself but that it was so  early  so much to be deplored by all who had the honour of her acquaintance  This task then I leave to thee But now I can write no more only that I am a sympathizer in every part of thy distress except and yet it is cruel to say it in That which arises from thy guilt  One o' clock Friday morning  LETTER LXI Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Nine Friday morn  I HAVE no opportunity to write at length having necessary orders to give on the melancholy occasion Joel who got to me by six in the morning and whom I dispatched instantly back with the letter I had ready from last night gives me but an indifferent account of the state of your mind I wonder not at it but Time and nothing  else can will make it easier to you If that is to say you have compounded with your conscience else it may be heavier every day than other  TOURVILLE tells me what a way you are in I hope you will not think of coming hither The lady in her Will desires you may not see her Four copies are making of it It is a long one for she gives her reasons for all she wills I will write to you more particularly as soon as possibly I can  THREE letters are just brought by a servant in livery directed  To Miss Clarissa Harlowe  I will send copies of them to you The contents are enough to make one mad How would this poor lady have rejoiced to receive themAnd yet if she had she would not have been enabled to say as she nobly did  Page    That God would not let her depend for comfort upon any but Himself  And indeed for some days past she had seemed to have got above all worldly considerationsHer  fervent love even for her Miss Howe  as she acknowleged having given way to  supremer fervors  Page    LETTER LXII Mrs  NORTON  To Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Wednesday Sept    AT length my best beloved Miss Clary every thing is in the wished trainFor all your relations are unanimous in your favourEven your brother and sister are with the foremost to be reconciled to you  I knew it must end thusBy patience and persevering sweetness what a triumph have you gained  This happy change is owing to letters received from your physician from your cousin Morden and from Mr Brand  Colonel Morden will be with you no doubt before this can reach you with his pocketbook filled with moneybills that nothing may be wanting to make you easy  And  now  all our hopes all our prayers are that this good news may restore you to spirits and health and that so long withheld it may not come too late  I know how much your dutiful heart will be raised with the joyful tidings I write you and still shall more particularly tell you of when I have the happiness to see you Which will be by next Saturday at furthest perhaps on Friday afternoon by the time you can receive this  For this day by the general voice being sent for I was received by every one with great goodness and condescension and  intreated  for that was the word they were pleased to use when I needed  no  intreaty I am sure to hasten up to you and to assure you of all their affectionate regards to you And your father bid me say all the kind things that were in my  heart  to say in order to comfort and raise you up and they would hold themselves bound to make them good  How agreeable is this commission to your Norton My heart will overflow with kind speeches never fearI am already meditating what I shall say to chear and raise you up in the names of every one dear and near to you And sorry I am that I cannot this moment set out as I might instead of writing would they favour my eager impatience with their chariot but as it was not offered it would be presumption to have asked for it And tomorrow a hired chaise and pair will be ready but at what hour I know not  How I long once more to fold my dear precious young lady to my fond my  more  than fond my  maternal  bosom  Your Sister will write to you and send her letter with This by a particular hand  I must not let them see what I write because of my wish about the chariot  Your uncle Harlowe will also write and I doubt not in the kindest terms For they are all extremely alarmed and troubled at the dangerous way your doctor represents you to be in as well as delighted with the character he gives you Would to heaven the good gentleman had written  sooner  And yet he writes that you know not he has  now  written But it is all our confidence and our  consolation that he would not have written at all had he thought it too late  They will prescribe no conditions to you my dear young lady but will leave all to your own duty and discretion Only your brother and sister declare they will never yield to call Mr Lovelace brother Nor will your father I believe be easily brought to think of him for a son  I am to bring you down with me as soon as your health and inclination will permit You will be received with open arms Every one longs to see you All the servants please themselves that they shall be permitted to kiss your hands The pert Betty's note is already changed and she now runs over in your just praises What friends does prosperity make What enemies adversity It always was and always will be so in every state of life from the throne to the cottageBut let all be forgotten now on this jubilee change And may you my dearest Miss be capable of rejoicing in this good news as I know you  will  rejoice if capable of any thing  God preserve you to our happy meeting And I will if I may say so weary Heaven with my incessant prayers to preserve and restore you afterwards  I need not say how much I am my dear young lady  Your everaffectionate and devoted  JUDITH NORTON  An unhappy delay as to the chaise will make it Saturday morning before I can fold you to my fond heart  LETTER LXIII Miss  ARAB HARLOWE  To Miss  CL HARLOWE    Wedn morning Sept    Dear Sister  WE have just heard that you are exceedingly ill We all loved you as never young creature was loved You are sensible of That Sister Clary And you have been very naughtyBut we could not be angry always  We are indeed more afflicted with the news of your being so very ill than I can express For I see not but after this separation as we understand that your misfortune has been greater than your fault and that however unhappy you have demeaned yourself like the good young  creature you used to be we shall love you better if possible than ever  Take comfort therefore Sister Clary and don't be too much cast downWhatever your mortifications may be from such noble prospects overclouded and from the reflections you will have from within on your faulty step and from the sullying of such a charming character by it you will receive none from any of us And as an earnest of your Papa's and Mamma's favour and reconciliation they assure you by me of their Blessing and hourly prayers  If it will be any comfort to you and my mother finds this letter is received as we expect which we shall know by the good effect it will have upon your health she will herself go to town to you Mean time the good woman you so dearly love will be hastened up to you and she writes by this opportunity to acquaint you of it and of all our returning love  I hope you'll rejoice at this good news Pray let us hear that you do Your next grateful letter on this occasion especially if it gives us the pleasure of hearing you are better upon this news will be received with the same if not greater delight that we  used  to have in all your prettilypenn'd epistles Adieu my dear Clary I am  Your loving Sister and true Friend  ARABELLA HARLOWE  LETTER LXIV To his dear Niece Miss  CLARISSA HARLOWE    Wedn Sept    WE were greatly grieved my beloved Miss Clary at your fault but we are still more if possible to hear you are so very ill and we are sorry things have been carried so far  We know your talents my dear and how movingly you could write whenever you pleased so that nobody could ever deny you any thing and believing you depended on your pen and little thinking you were so ill and that you had lived so regular a life and were so truly penitent are much troubled every one of us your brother and all for being so severe Forgive my part in it my  dearest Clary I am your  SecondPapa  you know And you  used  to love me  I hope you'll soon be able to come down and after awhile when your indulgent parents can spare you that you will come to me for a whole month and rejoice my heart as you used to do But if thro' illness you cannot so soon come down as we wish I will go up to you For I long to see you I never more longed to see you in my life and you was always the darling of my heart you know  My brother Antony desires his hearty commendations to you and joins with me in the tenderest assurance that all shall be well and if possible better than ever for we now have been so long without you that we know the miss of you and even hunger and thirst as I may say to see you and to take you once more to our hearts Whence indeed you was never banished so far as our concern for the unhappy step made  us  think and  you  believe you were Your sister and brother both talk of seeing you in town So does my dear sister your indulgent mother  God restore your health if it be his will Else I know not what will become of  Your truly loving Uncle and Second Papa  JOHN HARLOWE  LETTER LXV Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Friday night Sept    past ten    I Will now take up the account of our proceedings from my letter of last night which contained the dying words of this incomparable lady  As soon as we had seen the last scene closed so blessedly  we left the body to the care of the good women who according to the orders she had given them that very night removed her into that last house which she had display'd so much fortitude in providing  In the morning between and o'clock according to appointment the Colonel came to me here He was very much out of order We went together accompanied by Mrs Lovick and Mrs Smith into the deceased's chamber  We could not help taking a view of the lovely corpse and admiring the charming serenity of her noble aspect The women declared they never saw death so lovely before and that she looked as if in an easy slumber the colour having not quite left her cheeks and lips  I unlocked the drawer in which as I mentioned in a  Page  former she had deposited her papers I told you in mine of Monday last that she had the night before sealed up with three black seals a parcel inscribed  As soon as I am certainly dead this to be broken open by Mr Belford  I accused myself for having not done it over night But really I was then incapable of any thing  I broke it open accordingly and found in it no less than eleven letters each sealed with her own seal and black wax one of which was directed to me  I will inclose a copy of it  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Sunday Evening Sept    SIR  I Take this last and solemn occasion to repeat to you my thanks for all your kindness to me at a time when I most needed countenance and protection  A few considerations I beg leave as  now  at your perusal of This from the dead to press upon you with all the warmth of a sincere friendship  By the time you will see This you will have had an instance I humbly trust of the comfortable importance of a pacified conscience in the last hours of one who  to  the last hour will wish your eternal welfare  The great Duke of Luxemburgh as I have heard on his deathbed declared That he would then much rather have had it to reflect upon that he had administered a cup of cold water to a worthy poor creature in distress than that he had won so many battles as he had triumphed forAnd as one well observes All the sentiments of worldly grandeur vanish at that unavoidable moment which decides the destiny of all men  If then Sir at the tremendous hour it be thus with the conquerors of armies and the subduers of nations let me in very few words many are not needed ask  What at That period must be the reflections of those if capable of reflection who have lived a life of sense and offence whose study and whose pride most ingloriously has been to seduce the innocent and to ruin the weak the unguarded and the friendless made still more friendless by  their  base seductionsOh Mr Belford weigh ponder and reflect upon it now that in health and in vigour of mind and body the reflections will most avail youWhat an ingrateful what an unmanly what a meaner than reptile pride is this  In the next place Sir let me beg of you for  my sake  who AM or as  now  you will best read it  have been  driven to the necessity of applying to you to be the Executor of my will that you will bear according to that generosity which I think to be in you with all my friends and particularly with my brother who is really a worthy young man but perhaps a little too headstrong in his first resentments and conceptions of things if any thing by reason of this trust should fall out disagreeably and that you will study to make peace and to reconcile all parties and more especially that you who seem to have a great influence upon your  still more  headstrong friend will interpose if occasion be to prevent  further  mischiefFor surely Sir that violent spirit may sit down satisfied with the evils he has already wrought and particularly with the wrongs the heinous and ignoble wrongs he has in me done to my family wounded in the tenderest part of its honour  To this request I have already your repeated promise I claim the observance of it therefore as a debt from you And tho' I hope I need not doubt it yet was I willing on this solemn this  last  occasion thus earnestly to reinforce it  I have another request to make to you It is only That you will be pleased by a particular messenger to forward the inclosed letters as directed  And now Sir having the presumption to think that an  useful  member is lost to society by means of the unhappy step which has brought my life so soon to its period let me hope that I may be an humble instrument in the hands of Providence to reform a man of your parts and abilities  and then I shall think that loss will be more abundantly repaired to the world while it will be by God's goodness my gain And I shall have this further hope that once more I shall have an opportunity in a blessed Eternity to thank you as I now repeatedly do for the good you have done to and the trouble you will have taken for  Sir  Your obliged Servant  CLARISSA HARLOWE  The other letters are directed To her Father To her Mother One to her two Uncles To her Brother To her Sister To her Aunt Hervey To her Cousin Morden To Miss Howe To Mrs Norton and lastly one to You in performance of her promise  that a letter should be sent you when she arrived at her Father's house  I will withhold this last till I can be assured that you will be fitter  o receive it than Tourville tells me You are at present  Copies of all these are sealed up and intitled  Copies of my Ten posthumous letters for  J Belford  Esq  and put in among the bundle of papers left to my direction which I have not yet had leisure to open  No wonder while able that she was always writing since thus only of late could she employ that time which heretofore from the long days she made caused so many beautiful works to spring from her fingers It is my opinion that there never was a lady so young who wrote so much and with such celerity Her thoughts keeping pace as I have seen with her pen she hardly ever stopp'd or hesitated and very seldom blotted out or altered It was a natural talent she was mistress of among many other extraordinary ones  I gave the Colonel his letter and ordered Harry instantly to get ready to carry the others  Mean time retiring into the next apartment we opened the Will We were both so much affected in perusing it that at one time the Colonel breaking off gave it to me to read on at another I gave it back to him to proceed with neither of us being able to read it thro' without such tokens of sensibility as affected the voices of each  Mrs Lovick Mrs Smith and her Nurse were still more touched when we read those articles in which they are respectively remembered But I will avoid mentioning the particulars except in what relates to the thread of my narration as I shall send you a copy of it in proper time  The Colonel told me he was ready to account with me for the moneys he had brought up from her friends which would enable me as he said directly to execute the legacyparts of it and he would needs at that instant force into my hands a paper relating to that subject I put it in my pocketbook without looking into it telling him That as I hoped he would do all in his power to promote a literal performance of the will I must beg his advice and assistance in the execution of it  Her request to be buried with her ancestors made a letter of the following import necessary which I prevailed upon the Colonel to write being unwilling myself so  early  at least to appear off  cious in the eye of a family which probably wishes not any communication with me  To  JAMES HARLOWE  jun  Esq  SIR  THE letter which the bearer of this brings with him will I presume make it unnecessary to acquaint you and my cousins with the death of the most excellent of women But I am requested by her Executor who will soon send you a copy of her last Will to acquaint her father which I choose to do by your means that in it she earnestly desires to be laid in the familyvault at the feet of her grandfather  If her father will not admit of it she has directed her body to be buried in the churchyard of the parish where she died  I need not tell you that a speedy answer to This is necessary  Her Beatification commenced yesterday afternoon exactly at minutes after six  I can write no more than that I am  Yours  c WM MORDEN  Friday morn Sept    By the time this was written and by the Colonel's leave transcribed Harry came booted and spurred his horse at the door and I delivered him the letters to the family with those to Mrs Norton and Miss Howe eight in all together with the above of the Colonel to Mr James Harlowe and gave him orders to make the utmost dispatch with them  The Colonel and I have bespoke mourning for our selves and servants  LETTER LXVI Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Sat ten o' clock  POOR Mrs Norton is come She was set down at the door and would have gone up stairs directly But Mrs Smith and Mrs Lovick being together and in tears and the former hinting too suddenly to the truly venerable woman the fatal news she sunk down at her feet in fits so that they were forced to breathe a vein to bring her to herself and to a capacity of exclamation And then she run on to Mrs Lovick and to me who entered just as she recovered in praise of the lady in lamentations for her and invectives against you But yet so circumscribed were her invectives that I could observe in them the woman welleducated and in her lamentations the passion christianized as I may say  She was impatient to see the corpse The women went up with her But they owned that they were too much affected themselves on this occasion to describe her extremely affecting behaviour  With trembling impatience she pushed aside the coffinlid She bathed the face with her tears and kissed her cheeks and forehead as if she were living It was  Her  indeed she said Her sweet young lady Her very self Nor had death which changed all things a power to alter her lovely features She admired the serenity of her aspect She no doubt was happy she said as she had written to her she should be But how many miserable creatures had she left behind herThe good woman lamenting that she herself had lived to be one of them  It was with difficulty they prevailed upon her to quit the corpse and when they went into the next apartment I joined them and acquainted her with the kind legacy her beloved young lady had left her But This rather augmented than diminished her concern She ought she said to have attended her in person What was the world to her wringing her hands now the child of her bosom and of her heart was no more Her principal consolation however was that she should not long survive her She hoped she said that she did not sin in wishing she might not  It was easy to observe by the similitude of sentiments shewn in This and other particulars that the divine lady owed to this excellent woman many of her good notions  I thought it would divert the poor gentlewoman and not altogether unsuitably if I were to put her upon furnishing mourning for herself as it would rouse her by a seasonable and necessary employment from that dismal lethargy of grief which generally succeeds the too violent anguish with which a gentle nature is accustomed to be torn upon the first communication of the unexpected loss of a dear friend I gave her therefore the thirty guineas bequeathed to her and to her son for mourning the only mourning which the fair testatrix has mentioned And desired her to lose no time in preparing her own as I doubted not that she would accompany the corpse if it were permitted to be carried down  The Colonel proposes to attend the herse if his kindred give him not fresh cause of displeasure and will take with him a copy of the Will And being intent to give the family some favourable impressions of me he will also at his own desire take with him the copy of the posthumous letter to me  He is so kind as to promise me a minute account of all that shall pass on the melancholy occasion And we have begun a friendship and settled a correspondence which but one incident can possibly happen to interrupt to the end of our lives And that I hope will not happen  But what must be the grief the remorse that will seize upon the hearts of this hitherto inexorable family on the  receiving of the posthumous letters and that of the Colonel apprizing them of what has happened  I have given orders to an undertaker on the supposition that the body will be permitted to be carried down and the women intend to fill the coffin with aromatic herbs  The Colonel has obliged me to take the bills and draughts which he brought up with him for the considerable sums accrued since the grandfather's death from the lady's estate  I could have shewn to Mrs Norton the copies of the two letters which she missed by coming up But her grief wants not the heightenings which the reading of them would have given her  I HAVE been dipping into the copies of the posthumous letters to the family which Harry has carried down Well may I call this admirable Lady divine They are all calculated to give comfort rather than reproach tho' their cruelty to her merited nothing but reproach But were I in any of their places how much rather had I that she had quitted scores with me by the most severe recriminations than that she should thus nobly triumph over me by a generosity that has no example  I will inclose some of them which I desire you to return as soon as you can  LETTER LXVII To the Everhonoured  JAMES HARLOWE  sen  Esq  Most dear Sir  WITH exulting confidence now does your emboldened daughter come into your awful presence by th  se lines who dared not but upon This occasion to look up to you with hopes of favour and forgiveness since when This comes to your hands it will be out of her power ever to offend you more  And now let me bless you my honoured papa and bless you as I write upon my knees for all the benefits I have received from your indulgence For your fond love to me in the days of my prattling innocence For the virtuous education you gave me And for the crown  of all the happy end which thro' Divine Grace by means of that virtuous education I hope by the time you will receive This I shall have made And let me beg of you dear venerable Sir to blot from your remembrance if possible the last unhappy eight months and then I shall hope to be remembered with advantage for the pleasure you had the goodness to take in your Clarissa  Still on her knees let your poor penitent implore your forgiveness of all her faults and follies more especially of that fatal error which threw her out of your protection  When you know Sir that I have never been faulty in my will That ever since my calamity became irretrievable I have been in a state of preparation That I have the strongest assurances that the Almighty has accepted my unfeigned repentance and that by this time you will as I humbly presume to hope have been the means of adding One to the number of the Blessed you will have reason for joy rather than sorrow Since had I escaped the snares by which I was intangled I might have wanted those exercises which I look upon now as so many mercies dispensed to wean me betimes from a world that presented itself to me with prospects too alluring And in that case too easily satisfied with  worldly  felicity I might not have attained to that blessedness which now on your reading of This I humbly presume thro' the Divine goodness I am rejoicing in  That the Almighty in His own good time will bring you Sir and my everhonoured mother after a series of earthly felicities of which may my unhappy fault be the only interruption and very grievous I know that must have been to rejoice in the same blessed state is the repeated prayer of Sir  Your now happy Daughter  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER LXVIII To the Everhonoured Mrs  HARLOWE    Honoured Madam  THE last time I had the boldness to write to you it was with all the consciousness of a selfconvicted  minal supplicating her offended judge for mercy and  pardon I now by these lines approach you with more assurance but nevertheless with the highest degree of reverence gratitude and duty The reason of my assurance my letter to my Papa will give And as I humbly on my knees implored  his  pardon so now in the same dutiful manner do I supplicate yours for the grief and trouble I have given you  Every vein of my heart has bled for an unhappy rashness which altho' involuntary as to the act from the moment it was committed carried with it its own punishment and was accompanied with a true and sincere penitence  God who has been a witness of my distresses knows that great as they have been the greatest of all was the distress that I knew I must have given to you Madam and to my Father by a step that had so very ugly an appearance in your eyes and his and indeed in all my family's A step so unworthy of  your  daughter and of the education you had given her  But HE I presume to hope has forgiven me and at the instant This will reach your hands I humbly trust I shall be rejoicing in the blessed fruits of His forgiveness And be This your comfort my everhonoured Mamma that the principal end of your pious care for me is attained tho' not in the way so much hoped for  May the grief which my fatal error has given to you both be the only grief that shall ever annoy you in this worldMay you Madam long live to sweeten the cares and heighten the comforts of my PapaMay my Sister's continued and if possible augmented duty happily make up to you the loss you have sustained in me And whenever my Brother and she change their single state may it be with such satisfaction to you both as may make you forget my offence and remember me only in those days in which you took pleasure in me And at last may a happy meeting with your forgiven penitent in the eternal mansions augment the bliss of her who purify'd by sufferings already when This salutes your hands presumes she shall be  The forever Happy  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER LXIX To  JAMES HARLOWE  jun  Esq  SIR  THERE was but one time but one occasion after the rash step I was precipitated upon that I could hope to be excused looking up to you in the character of a brother and a friend And NOW is that time and THIS the occasion Now at reading This will you pity your late unhappy sister NOW will you forgive her faults both supposed and real And NOW will you afford to her  memory  that kind concern which you refused to her before  I write my brother in the first place to beg your pardon for the offence my unhappy step gave to you and to the rest of a family so dear to me  Virgin purity should not so behave as to be suspected Yet when you come to know all my story you will find further room for pity if not for  more  than pity for your late unhappy sister  O that passion had not been deaf That misconception would have given way to enquiry That your rigorous heart if it could not itself be softened moderating the power you had obtained over every one had permitted other hearts more indulgently to expand  But I write not to give pain I had rather you should think me faulty still than take to yourself the consequence that will follow from acquitting me  Abandoning therefore a subject which I had not intended to touch upon for I hope at the writing of this I am above the spirit of recrimination let me tell you Sir that my next motive for writing to you in this last and most solemn manner is To beg of you to forego any active resentments which may endanger a life so precious to all your friends against the man to whose elaborate baseness I owe my worldly ruin  For ought an innocent man to run an  equal  risque with a guilty oneA  more  than equal risque as the guilty one has been long inured to acts of violence and is skilled in the arts of offence  You would not arrogate to yourself God's province  who has said  Vengeance is mine and I will repay it  If you would I tremble for the consequence For will it not be suitable to the Divine Justice to punish the  presumptuous  Innocent as you would be in this case in the  very  error and that by the hand of the  Selfdefending  GuiltyReserving  him  for a future day of vengeance for his accumulated crimes  Leave then the poor wretch to the Divine Justice Let your sister's fault die with her At least let it not be revived in blood Life is a short stage where longest A little time hence the now green head will be gray if it lives this little time And if Heaven will afford him time for repentance why should not  you  Then think my brother what will be the consequence to your dear parents if the guilty wretch who has occasioned to them the loss of a daughter should likewise deprive them of their best hope an only son more worth in the familyaccount than several daughters  Would you add my brother to those distresses which you hold your sister so inexcusable for having altho' from involuntary and undesigned causes given  Seek not then I beseech you to extend the evil consequences of your sister's error His conscience when it shall please God to touch it will be sharper than your sword  I have still another motive for writing to you in this solemn manner It is to intreat you to watch over your passions The principal fault I know you to be guilty of is the violence of your temper when you think yourself in the right which you would oftner be but for that very violence  You have several times brought your life into danger by it  Is not the man guilty of a high degree of selfpartiality who is less able to  bear  contradiction than apt to  give  itHow often with you has impetuosity brought on abasementA consequence too natural  Let me then caution you dear Sir against a warmth of temper an impetuosity when moved and you so  ready  to be moved that may hurry you into unforeseen difficulties and which it is in some measure a sin not to endeavour to  restrain God enable you to do it for the sake of your own peace and safety as well present as future And for the sake of your family and friends who all see your fault but are tender of speaking to you of it  As for me my brother my punishment has been seasonable God gave me grace to make a right use of my sufferings I early repented I never loved the man half so m  ch as I hated his actions when I saw what he was capable of I gave up my whole  heart  to a better hope God blessed my penitence and my reliance upon Him And now I presume to say I AM HAPPY  May Heaven preserve you in safety health and honour and long continue your life for a comfort and stay to your honoured parents And may you in the change of your single state meet with a wife as agreeable to every one else as to yourself and be happy in a hopeful race and not have one Clarissa among them to imbitter your comforts when she should give you  most  comfort But may my example be of use to warn the dear creatures whom once I hoped to live to see and to cherish of the evils with which this deceitful world abounds are the prayers of  Your affectionate Sister  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER LXX To Miss  HARLOWE    NOW may you my dear Arabella unrestrained by the severity of your virtue let fall a pitying tear on the past faults and sufferings of your late unhappy sister since Now she can never offend you more The Divine Mercy which first inspired her with repentance an  early  repentance it was since it preceded her sufferings for an error which she offers not to extenuate altho' perhaps it were capable of some extenuation has  now  at the instant that you are reading This as I humbly hope blessed her with the fruits of it  Thus already even while she writes in imagination purified and exalted she the more fearlesly writes to her sister and NOW is assured of pardon for all those little occasions  of displeasure which her frowarder youth might give you and for the disgrace which her fall has fixed upon you and upon her family  May you my sister continue to bless those dear and honoured relations whose indulgence so well deserves your utmost gratitude with those chearful instances of duty and obedience which have hitherto been so acceptable to  Them  and praiseworthy in  You  And may you when a suitable proposal shall offer fill up more worthily that chasm which the loss they have sustained in me has made in their family  Thus my Arabella my only Sister and for many happy years my Friend most fervently prays That Sister whose affection for you no acts of unkindness no misconstruction of her conduct could cancel And who NOW made perfect as she hopes thro' sufferings styles herself  The Happy  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER LXXI To  JOHN  and  ANTONY HARLOWE  Esqrs  Honoured Sirs  WHEN these lines reach your hands your late unhappy Niece will have known the end of all her troubles and as she humbly hopes will be rejoicing in the mercies of a gracious God who has declared that He will forgive the truly penitent of heart  I write therefore my dear Uncles and to you Both in one letter since your fraternal love has made you Both but as One person to give you comfort and not distress for however sharp my afflictions have been they have been but of short duration and I am betimes happily as I hope arrived at the end of a painful journey  At the same time I write to thank you both for all your kind indulgence to me and to beg your forgiveness of my last my  only  great fault to you and to my family  The ways of Providence are unsearchable Various are the means made use of by It to bring poor sinners to a sense of their duty Some are drawn by Love others are driven by Terrors to their Divine Refuge I had for Eighteen years out of Nineteen rejoiced in the favour and affection  of every one No trouble came near my heart I seemed to be one of those designed to be drawn by the silken cords of LoveBut perhaps I was too apt to value myself upon the love and favour of every one The merit of the good I delighted to do and of the inclinations which were given me and which I could not help having I was perhaps too ready to attribute to myself and now being led to account for the cause of my temporary calamities find I had a secret pride to be punished for which I had not fathomed And it was necessary perhaps that some sore and terrible misfortunes should befal me in order to mortify my pride and my vanity  Temptations were accordingly sent I shrunk in the day of tryal My discretion which had been so cry'd up was found wanting when it came to be weighed in an equal balance I was betrayed fell and became the byword of my companions and a disgrace to my family which had prided itself in me perhaps too much But as my fault was not that of a culpable will when my pride was sufficiently mortified altho' I was surrounded by dangers and intangled in snares I was not suffered to be totally lost But purified by sufferings I was fitted for the change I have NOW at the time you will receive This so newly and as I humbly hope so happily experienced  Rejoice with me then dear Sirs that I have weathered so great a storm Nor let it be matter of concern that I am cut off in the bloom of youth  'There is no inquisition in the grave whether we lived ten or an hundred years and the day of death is better than the day of our birth'  Once more dear Sirs accept my grateful thanks for all your goodness to me from my early childhood to the day the unhappy day of my error Forgive that errorAnd God give us a happy meeting in a blessed Eternity prays  Your most dutiful and obliged Kinswoman  CLARISSA HARLOWE  Mr Belford gives the Lady's posthumous letters to Mrs Hervey Miss Howe and Mrs Norton at length likewise But altho' every letter varies in style as well  as matter from the others yet as they are written on the same subject and are pretty long it is thought proper to abstract them  That to her Aunt Hervey is written in the same pious and generous strain with the others preceding seeking to give comfort rather than distress  'The Almighty I hope says she has received and blessed my penitence and I am happy Could I have been more than so at the end of what is called a happy life of or or years to come And what are or or years to look back upon when passedIn half of either of these periods what friends might I not have mourned for what temptations from worldly prosperity might I not have encountered with And in such a case immersed in earthly pleasures how little likelihood that in my last stage I should have been blessed with such a preparation and resignation as I have now been blessed with'  She proceeds as follows  'Thus much Madam of comfort to you and myself from this dispensation As to my dear parents I hope they will console themselves that they have still many blessings left which ought to balance the troubles my error has given them That unhappy as I have been to be the interrupter of their felicities they never till this my fault knew any  heavy evil  That afflictions patiently borne may be turned into blessings That uninterrupted happiness is not to be expected in this life That after all they have not as I humbly presume to hope the probability of the everlasting perdition of their child to deplore And that in short when my story comes to be fully known they will have the comfort to know that my sufferings will redound more to my honour than to my disgrace  'These considerations will I hope make their temporary loss of but  one  child out of  three  unhappily circumstanced too as she was matter of greater consolation than affliction And the rather as we may hope for a happy meeting once more never to be separated either by time or offences'  She concludes this letter with an address to her cousin Dolly Hervey whom she calls her amiable cousin and  thankfully remembers for the part she took in her afflictions  'O my dear Cousin let your worthy heart be guarded against those delusions which have been fatal to my worldly happinessThat pity which you bestowed upon  me  demonstrates a gentleness of nature which may possibly subject you to misfortunes if your eye be permitted to mislead your judgmentBut a strict observance of your filial duty my dearest cousin and the precepts of so prudent a mother as you have the happiness to have enforced by so sad an example in your own family as I have set will I make no doubt with the Divine Assistance be your guard and security'  The posthumous letter to Miss HOWE is extremely tender and affectionate She pathetically calls upon her  'to rejoice that all her Clarissa's troubles are now at an end That the state of temptation and tryal of doubt and uncertainty is now over with her and that she has happily escaped the snares that were laid for her soul The rather to rejoice as that her misfortunes were of such a nature that it was impossible she could be tolerably happy in this life'  She  'thankfully acknowleges the favours she had received from Mrs Howe and Mr Hickman and expresses her concern for the trouble she has occasioned to the former as well as to her and prays that all the earthly blessings they used to wish to each other may singly devolve upon  her  '  She beseeches her  'that she will not suspend the day which shall supply to herself the friend she will have lost in her and give to herself a still nearer and dearer relation'  She tells her  'That her choice a choice made with the approbation of all her friends has fallen upon a sincere an honest a virtuous and what is more than all a  pious  man a man who altho' he admires her person is still more in love with the graces of her mind And as those graces are improveable with every added year of life which will impair the transitory ones of person what a firm basis infers she has Mr Hickman chosen to build his love upon'  She prays  'That God will bless them together and that the remembrance of her and of what she has suffered may not interrupt their mutual happiness she desires them to think of nothing but what she Now is and that a time will come when they shall meet again never to be divided'  'To the Divine Protection mean time she commits her and charges her by the love that has always subsisted between them that she will not mourn too heavily for her and again calls upon her after  gentle tear which she will allow her to let fall in memory of their uninterrupted friendship to rejoice that she is so early released and that she is purified by her sufferings and is made as she assuredly trusts by God's goodness eternally happy'  The posthumous letters to Mr  LOVELACE  and Mr  MORDEN  will be occasionally inserted hereafter As will also the substance of that written to Mrs  NORTON  LETTER LXXII Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Sat Afternoon Sept    I Understand that thou breathest nothing but revenge against  me  for treating thee with so much freedom and against the accursed woman and her infernal crew I am not at all concerned for thy menaces against myself It is my design to make thee  feel  It gives me pleasure to find my intention answered And I congratulate thee that thou hast not lost that sense  As to the cursed crew well do they deserve the fire  here  that thou threatenest them with and the fire here  after  that seems to await them But I have this moment received news which will in all likelihood save thee the guilt of punishing the old wretch for her share of wickedness as thy agent But if that happens to her which is likely to happen wilt thou not tremble for what may befal the principal  Not to keep thee longer in suspense last night it seems the infamous woman got so heartily intoxicated  with her beloved liquor arrack punch at the expence of Colonel Salter that mistaking her way she fell down a pair of stairs and broke her leg And now after a dreadful night she lies foaming raving roaring in a burning fever that wants not any other fire to scorch her into a feeling more exquisite and durable than any thy vengeance could make her suffer  The wretch has requested me to come to her And lest I should refuse a common messenger sent her vile associate Sally Martin who not finding me at Soho came hither another part of her business being to procure the divine lady's pardon for the old creature's wickedness to her  This devil incarnate Sally was never so shocked in her life as when I told her the lady was dead  She took out her salts to keep her from fainting and when a little recovered she accused herself for her part of the injuries the lady had sustained as she said Polly Horton would do for hers and shedding tears declared that the world never produced such another woman She called her the ornament and glory of her Sex acknowleged that her r  in was owing more to their instigations than even savage as thou art to thy own vileness Since thou wert inclined to have done her justice more than once had they not kept up thy profligate spirit to its height  This wretch would fain have been admitted to a sight of the corpse But I refused her request with execrations  She could forgive herself she said for every thing but her insults upon the admirable lady at Rowland's Since all the rest was but in pursuit of a livelihood to which she had been reduced as she boasted from better expectations and which hundreds follow as well as she I did not ask her  By whom reduced    At going away she told me that the old monster's bruises are of more dangerous consequence than the fracture That a mortification is apprehended And that the vile wretch has so much compunction of heart on recollecting her treatment of Miss Harlowe and is so much set upon procuring her forgiveness that she is sure the news she has to carry her will hasten her end  LETTER LXXIII Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Sat Night  THY servant gives me a dreadful account of thy raving unmanageableness I wonder not at it But as nothing violent is lasting I dare say that thy habitual gaiety of heart will quickly get the better of thy frenzy And the rather do I judge so as thy fits are of the raving kind suitable to thy natural impetuosity and not of that melancholy species which seizes slower souls  For this reason I will proceed in writing to thee that my narrative may not be broken by thy discomposure and that the contents of it may find thee and help thee to reflection when thou shalt be restored  Harry is returned from carrying the posthumous letters to the family and to Miss Howe and that of the Colonel which acquaints James Harlowe with his sister's death and with her desire to be interred near her grandfather  Harry was not admitted into the presence of any of the family They were all assembled together it seems at Harloweplace on occasion of the Colonel's letter which informed them of the lady's dangerous way  See p  and were comforting themselves as Harry was told with hopes that Mr Morden had made the worst of her state in order to quicken their resolutions  It is easy then to judge what must be their grief and surprise on receiving the fatal news which the letters Harry sent in to them communicated  He staid there long enough to find the whole house in confusion the servants running different ways lamenting and wringing their hands as they run the female servants particularly as if some body poor Mrs Harlowe no doubt and perhaps Mrs Hervey too were in fits  All were in such disorder that he could get no commands nor obtain any notice of himself The servants seemed more inclined to execrate than welcome himO master O young man cry'd three or four together what dismal tidings have you broughtThey helped him to his horse which with great civility they had put up on  his arrival at the very first word And he went to an inn and pursued on foot his way to Mrs Norton's and finding her come to town left the letter he carried down for her with her son a fine youth who when he heard the fatal news burst out into a flood of tearsfirst lamenting the lady's death and then crying out What what would become of his poor motherHow would she support herself when she should find on her arrival in town that the dear lady who was so deservedly the darling of her heart was no more  He proceeded to Miss Howe's with the letter for her That lady he was told had just given orders for a young man a tenant's son to post to London to bring her news of her dear friend's condition and whether she should herself be encouraged by an account of her being still alive to make her a visit every thing being ordered to be in readiness for her going up on his return with the news she wished and prayed for with the utmost impatience And Harry was just in time to prevent the man's setting out  He had the precaution to desire to speak with Miss Howe's woman or maid and communicated to her the fatal tidings that she might break them to her young lady The maid was herself so affected that her old lady who Harry said seemed to be every where at once came to see what ailed her and was herself so struck with the communication that she was forced to sit down in a chair O the sweet creature said sheAnd is it come to thisO my poor NancyHow shall I be able to break the matter to my Nancy  Mr Hickman was in the house He hastened in to comfort the old ladyBut he could not restrain his own tears He feared he said when he was last in town that this sad event would soon happen But little thought it would be so very soonBut she is happy I am sure said he  Mrs Howe when a little recovered went up in order to break the news to her daughter She took the letter and her salts in her hand And Harry could perceive that they had occasion for them For the housekeeper soon came hurrying down into the kitchen  her face overspread with tearsHer young mistress had fainted away she saidNor did she wonder at itNever did there live a lady more deserving of general admiration and lamentation than Miss Clarissa Harlowe And never was there a stronger friendship dissolved by death than between her young lady and her She hurried with a lighted waxcandle and with feathers to burn under the nose of her young mistress which shewed that she continued in fits  Mr Hickman afterwards with his usual humanity directed that Harry should be taken care of all night it being then the close of day He asked him after my health He expressed himself excessively afflicted as well for the deprivation as for the just grief of the lady whom he so passionately loves But he called the departed lady an Angel of Light We dreaded said he tell your master to read the letter sentBut we needed not'Tis a blessed letter written by a blessed handBut the consolation she aims to give will for the present heighten the sense we all shall have of the loss of so excellent a creature Tell Mr Belford that I thank God I am not the man who had the unmerited honour to call himself her brother  I know how terribly this  great  catastrophe as I may call it since so many persons are interested in it affects  thee  I should have been glad to have had particulars of the distress which the first communication of it must have given to the Harlowes Yet who but must pity the unhappy mother  The answer which James Harlowe returned to Colonel Morden's letter of notification of his sister's death and to her request as to interrment will give a faint idea of what their concern must be Here follows a copy of it  To  WILLIAM MORDEN  Esq  Saturday Sept    Dear Cousin  I Cannot find words to express what we all suffer on the mournfullest news that ever was communicated to us  My Sister Arabella but alas I have now no  other  Sister was preparing to follow Mrs Norton up and I had resolved to escorte her and to have looked in upon the dear creature  God be merciful to us all To what purpose did the doctor write if she was so near her endWhy as everybody sa  s did he not send sooneror why at all  The most admirable young creature that ever swervednot one friend to be with herAlas Sir I fear my mother will never get over this shockShe has been in hourly sits ever since she received the fatal news My poor father has the go  t thrown into his stomach and heaven knowsO Co  in O SirI meant nothing but the honour of the family yet have I all the weight thrown upon meO this cursed Lovelace may I perish if he escape the deserved vengeance  The words thus inclosed were omitted in the transcript to Mr Lovelace    We had begun to please ourselves that we should soon see her hereGood heaven that her next entrance into this house after she abandoned us so precipitately should be in a coffin  We can have nothing to do with her Executor another strange step of the dear creature's He cannot expect we willnor if he be a gentleman will he think of acting Do You therefore be pleased Sir to order an undertaker to convey the body down to us  My mother says she shall be for ever unhappy if she may not in death see the dear creature whom she could not see in life Be so kind therefore as to direct the lid to be only halfscrewed downthat if my poor mother cannot be prevailed upon to dispense with so shocking a spectacle she may be obligedShe was the darling of her heart  If we know her will in relation to the funeral it shall be punctually complied with As shall every thing in it that is fit or reasonable to be performed and This without the intervention of strangers  Will you not dear Sir favour us with your presence at this melancholy time Pray doand pity and excuse what passed at our last meeting with that generosity which is natural to the Brave and the Wise Every one's respects attend you And I am Sir  Your inexpressibly afflicted Cousin and Servant  JA HARLOWE jun  Every thing that is Fit or Reasonable  to be performed repeated I to the Colonel from the above letter on his reading it to me That is every thing which she has directed that  can  be performed I hope Colonel that I shall have no contention with them I wish no more for  their  acquaintance than they do for  mine  But you Sir must be the mediator between them and me for I shall insist upon a literal performance in every article  The Colonel was so kind as to declare that he would join to support me in my resolution  LETTER LXXIV Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Sunday morn    o'Clock Sept    I Staid at Smith's till I saw the last of all that was mortal of the divine lady  As she has directed Rings by her Will to several persons with her hair to be set in crystal the afflicted Mrs Norton cut off before the coffin was closed four charming ringlets one of which the Colonel took for a locket which he says he will cause to be made and wear next his heart in memory of his beloved cousin  Between four and five in the morning the corpse was put into the herse the coffin before being filled as intended with flowers and aromatic herbs and proper care taken to prevent the corpse suffering to the eye from the jolting of the horse  Poor Mrs Norton is extremely ill I gave particular directions to Mrs Smith's maid whom I have ordered to attend the good woman in a mourning chariot to take care of her The Colonel who rides with his servants within view of the herse says that he will see my orders in relation to her inforced  When the herse moved off and was out of sight I locked up the lady's chamber into which all that had belonged to her was removed  I expect to hear from the Colonel as soon as he is got down by a servant of his own  LETTER LXXV Mr  MOWBRAY  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Uxbridge  Sunday morn    o'Clock    Dear Jack  I SEND you inclosed a letter from Mr Lovelace which tho' written in the cursed Algebra I know to be such a one as will shew what a  queer  way he is in for he read it to us with the air of a tragedian You will see by it what the mad fellow had intended to do if we had not all of us interposed He was actually setting out with a Surgeon of this place to have the lady opened and embalmedRot me if it be not my full persuasion that if he had her heart would have been found to be either iron or marble  We have got Lord M to him His Lordship is also much afflicted at the Lady's death His sisters and nieces he says will be ready to break their hearts What a rout's here about a woman For after all she was no more  We have taken a pailful of black bull's blood from him and this has lowered him a little But he threatens Colonel Morden he threatens you for your cursed reflections Cursed reflections indeed Jack and curses all the world and himself still  Last night his mourning which is full as deep as for a wife was brought home and his fellows mourning too And tho' o'clock he would put it on and make them attend him in theirs  Everybody blames him on this Lady's account But I see not for why She was a  vixen  in her virtue And her relations are ten times more to blame than he I will prove this to the teeth of them all If  they  could use her ill why should they expect  him  to use her wellYou or I or Tourville in his shoes would have done as he has done Are not all the girls forewarned  'Has he done by her as that Caitiffe  Miles  did to the farmer's daughter whom he tri  ked up to town s  pretty girl also just such another as B  b's Rosebud under a notion of waiting on a lady  Drill'd  her on pretending the lady was abroad Drank her lighthearted then carried her to a Play then it was too late you know to see the pretended lady Then to a Bagnio Ruined her as they call it and all the  same day Kept her on an ugly dog too a fortnight or three weeks then left her to the mercy of the people of the Bagnio never paying for any thing who stript her of all her cloaths and because she would not take on threw her into prison where she died in want and in despair'  A true story thou knowest JackThis fellow deserved to be damn'd But has our Bob been such a villain as thisAnd would he not have  married  this flintyhearted lady  So he is justified very evidently  Why then should such cursed quawms take himWho would have thought he had been such  poor blood  Now Rot the puppy to see him sit silent in a corner when he has tired himself with his mockmajesty and with his argumentation who so fond of  arguefying  as he and teaching his shadow to make mouths against the wainscotLordszounter if I have patience with him  But he has had no rest for these ten days That's the thingYou must write to him and pr'ythee coax him Jack and send him what he writes for and give him all his way There will be no bearing him else And get the lady buried as fast as you can and don't let him know where  This letter should have gone yesterday We told him it did But were in hopes he would not have inquired after it again But he raves as he has not any answer  What he  vouchsafed  to read of other of your letters has given my Lord such a curiosity as makes him desire you to continue your accounts Pray do But not in your hellish  Araback  and we will let the poor fellow only into what we think fitting for his present way  I live a cursed dull poking life here With what I so lately saw of poor Belton and what I now see of this charming fellow I shall be as crazy as he soon or as dull as thou Jack so must seek for better company in town than either of you I have been forced to read sometimes to divert me and you know I hate reading It presently sets me into a fit of drowsiness and then I yawn and stretch like a devil  Yet in Dryden's Palemon and Arcite have I just now met with a passage that has in it much of our Bob's case These are some of the lines  Mr Mowbray then recites some lines from that poem describing a distracted men and runs the parallel and then priding himself in his performance says  Let me tell you that had I begun to write as early as you and Lovelace I might have cut as good a figure as either of you Why not But boy or man I ever hated a book 'Tis a folly to lie I loved action my boy I hated droning and have led in former days more boys from their book than ever my master made to profit by it Kicking and cuffing and orchardrobbing were my early glory  But I am tired of writing I never wrote such a long letter in my life My wrists and my fingers and thumb ake damnably The pen is an hundred weight at the least And my eyes are ready to drop out of my head upon the paperThe cramp but this minute in my fingers Rot the goose and the goosequill I will write no more long letters for a twelvemonth to come Yet one word We think the mad fellow coming to Adieu  LETTER LXXVI Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Uxbridge  Sat Sept    Jack  I Think it absolutely right that my everdear and beloved lady should be opened and embalmed It must be done out of handthis very afternoon Your acquaintance Tomkins and old Anderson of this place whom I will bring with me shall be the surgeons I have talked to the latter about it  I will see every thing done with that decorum which the case and the sacred person of my beloved require  Every thing that can be done to preserve the charmer from decay shall also be done And when she  will  descend to her original dust or cannot be kept longer I will then have her  aid

she living Whose is she dead but mineHer cursed parents whose barbarity to her no doubt was the  true  cause of her death have long since renounced her She left  them  for  me  She chose  me

any part of her Will but by my express direction I will order every thing myself For am I not her husband And being forgiven by her am I not the chosen of her heart What else signifies her forgiveness  The two insufferable wretches you have sent me plague me to death and would treat me like a babe in strings Damn the fellows what can they mean by itYet that crippled monkey Doleman joins with them And as I hear them whisper they have sent for Lord MTo controul me I suppose  What can they mean by this usage of me Sure all the world is run mad but myself They treat me as they ought every one of

bring Anderson with me  To get her Will and every thing ready for my perusal and consideration  I will have possession of her dear heart this very night and let Tomkins provide a proper receptacle and spirits till I can get a golden one made for it  I will take her papers And as no one can do her memory justice equal to myself and I will not spare myself Who can better shew the world what she was and what a villain he that could use her ill And the world shall also see what implacable and unworthy parents she had  All shall be set forth in words at length No mincing of the matter Names undisguised as well as facts For as I shall make the worst figure in it myself and have a right to treat myself as nobody else shall Who will controul me Who dare call me to account  Let me know if the damned mother be yet the subject of the devil's own vengeanceif the old wretch be dead or alive Some exemplary mischief I must yet do My revenge shall sweep away that devil and all my opposers of the cruel Harlowe family from the fac  of the earth Whole he  ombs ought to be offered up to the Manes of my Clarissa Lovelace  Altho' her Will may in some respects cross mine yet I expect to be observed I will be the interpreter of hers  Next to mine hers shall be observed for she is my wife and shall be to all eternity I will never have another  Adieu Jack I am preparing to be with you I charge you as you value my life or your own do not oppose me in any thing relating to my Clarissa Lovelace  My temper is intirely altered I know not what it is to laugh or smile or be pleasant I am grown choleric and impatient and will not be controuled  I write this in characters as I used to do that nobody but you should know what I write For never was any man plagued with impertinents as I am  R LOVELACE  In a separate paper inclosed in the above  LET me tell thee in characters still that I am in a dreadful way just now My brain is all boiling like a caldron over a fiery furnace What a devil is the matter with me I wonder I never was so strange in my life  In truth Jack I have been a most execrable villain And when I consider all my actions by this angel of a woman and in her the piety the charity the wit the beauty I have  helped  to destroy and the good to the world I have thereby been a means of frustrating I can pronounce damnation upon myself How then can I expect mercy any where else  I believe I shall have no patience with you when I see you Your damned stings and reflections have almost turned my brain  But here Lord M they tell me is come Dn him and those who

look'd  Which never gale of life shall open more  And is it so Is it  indeed  soGood God Good GodBut they will no  let me write on I must go down to this officious peerWho the devil sent for him  LETTER LXXVII Mr  BELFORD  To  RICHARD MOWBRAY  Esq  Sunday Sept    in the Afternoon    I HAVE yours with our unhappy friend's inclosed I am glad my Lord is with him As I presume that his frenzy will be but of short continuance I most earnestly wish that on his recovery he could be prevailed upon to go abroad Mr Morden who is inconsolable has seen by the Will that the case was more than a common seduction and has dropt hints already that he looks upon himself on that account to be freed from his promises made to the dying lady which were that he would not seek to avenge her death You must make the recovery of his health the motive for urging him on this head for if you hint at his own safety he will not stir but rather seek the Colonel  As to the lock of hair you may easily pacify him as you once saw the angel with hair near the colour if he be intent upon it  At my Lord's desire I will write on and in my common hand that you may judge what is and what is not fit to read to Mr Lovelace at present But as I shall not forbear reflections as I go along in hopes to reach his heart on his recovery I think it best to direct myself to him still and that as if he were not disordered  As I shall not have leisure to take copies and yet am willing to have the whole subject before me for my own future contemplation I must insist upon a return of my letters some time hence Mr Lovelace knows that this is one of my conditions and has hitherto complied with it  Thy letter Mowbray is an inimitable performance Thou art a strange impenetrable creature But let me most earnestly  njure thee and the idle flutterer Tourville from what ye have seen of poor Belton's exit from our friend Lovelace's frenzy and the occasion of i  and from the terrible condition in which the wretched  clair lies to set about an immediate change of life and manners For my own part I am determined be your resolutions what they may to take the advice I give  As witness  J BELFORD  LETTER LXXVIII Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  O Lovelace I have a scene to paint in relation to the wretched Sinclair that if I do it justice will make thee seriously ponder and reflect or nothing can I will lead to it in order and that in my usual hand that thy compeers may be able to read it as well as thyself  When I had written the preceding letter not knowing what to do with myself recollecting and in vain wishing for that delightful and improving conversation which I had now for ever lost I thought I had as good begin the task which I had for some time past  resolved  to begin that is to say To go to church and see if I could not reap some benefit from what I should hear there Accordingly I determined to go to hear the celebrated preacher at St James's church But as if the devil for so I was then ready to conclude thought himself concerned to prevent my intention a visit was made me just as I was dressed which took me off from my purpose  Whom should this be from but Sally Martin accompanied by Mrs Carter the sister of the infamous Sinclair the same I suppose I need not tell you who keeps the Bagnio near Bloomsbury  These told me that the surgeon apothecary and physician had all given the wretched woman over but that she said She could not die nor be at rest till she saw me And they besought me to accompany them in the coach they came in if I had one spark of charity of  Christian  charity as they called it left  I was very loth to be diverted from my purpose by a request so unwelcome and from people so hated but at last went and we got thither by ten Where a scene so shocking presented itself to me that the death of poor desponding Belton is not I think to be compared with it  The old wretch had once put her leg out by her rage and violence and had been crying scolding cursing ever since the preceding evening that the surgeon had told her it was impossible to  her and that a mortification had begun to shew itself insomuch that purely in  compassion to their own  ears  they had been forced to send for another surgeon purposely to tell her tho' against his judgment and being a friend of the other to seem to convince  him  that he mistook her case and that if she would be patient she might recover But nevertheless her apprehensions of death and her antipathy to the thoughts of dying were so strong that their imposture had not the intended effect and she was raving crying cursing and even howling more like a wolf than a human creature when I came so that as I went up stairs I said Surely this noise this howling cannot be from the unhappy woman Sally said it was and assured me that it was nothing to the noise she had made all night and stepping into her room before me Dear  Madam  Sinclair said she forbear this noise It is more like that of a bull than a womanHere comes Mr Belford and you'll fright him away if you bellow at this rate  There were no less than eight of her cursed daughters surrounding her bed when I entered one of her partners Polly Horton at their head and now Sally her other partner and  Madam  Carter as they called her for they are all  Madams  with one another made the number Ten All in shocking dishabille and without stays except Sally Carter and Polly who not daring to leave her had not been in bed all night  The other seven seemed to have been but just up risen perhaps from their customers in the forehouse and their nocturnal Orgies with faces three or four of them that had run the paint lying in streaky seams not half blowz'd off discovering coarse wrinkled skins The hair of some of them of divers colours obliged to the blacklead comb where black was affected the artificial jet however yielding apace to the natural brindle That of others plaistered with oil and powder the oil predominating But every one's hanging about her ears and neck in broken curls or ragged ends and each at my entrance taken with one motion stroaking their matted locks with both hands under their coifs mobs or pinners every one of which was awry They were all slipshoed stockenless some only underpetticoated all their gowns made to cover straddling hoops hanging trolloppy and tangling  about their heels but has  ily wrapt round them as soon as I came up stairs And half of them unpadded shoulderbent pallidlipp'd seeblejointed wretches appearing from a blooming Nineteen or Twenty perhaps overnight haggard wellworn strumpets of Thirtyeight or Forty  I am the more particular in describing to thee the appearance these creatures made in my eyes when I came into the room because I believe thou never sawest any of them much less a group of them thus unprepared for being seen  Whoever has seen Dean Swift's Lady's DressingRoom will think this description of Mr Belford not only more natural but more decent painting as well as better justified by the design and by the use that may be made of it  I for my part never did before nor had I now but upon this occasion been thus  favoured  If thou  hadst  I believe thou wouldst hate a profligate woman as one of Swift's Yahoos or Virgil's obscene Harpyes squirting their ordure upon the Trojan trenchers since the persons of such in their retirements are as filthy as their mindsHate them as much as I do and as much as I admire and next to adore a truly virtuous and elegant woman For to me it is evident that as a neat and clean woman must be an angel of a creature so a sluttish one is the impurest animal in nature  But these were the veterans the chosen band for nowandthen flitted in to the number of half a dozen or more by turns subordinate sinners undergraduates younger than some of the chosen phalanx but not less obscene in their appearance tho' indeed not so much beholden to the plaistering fucus yet unpropt by stays squalid loose in attire fluggishhaired underpetticoated only as the former eyes half opened winking and pinking mispatched yawning stretching as if from the unwornoff effects of the midnight revel all armed in succession with supplies of cordials of which every one present was either taster or partaker under the direction of the Praetorian Dorcas who nowandthen popp'd in to see her slops duly given and taken  But when I approached the  old wretch  what a spectacle presented itself to my eyes  Her misfortune has not at all sunk but rather as I  thought increased her flesh rage and violence perhaps swelling her mus  ly features Behold her then spreading the whole tumbled bed with her huge quaggy carcase Her millpost arms held up her broad hands clenched with violence her big eyes goggling and flamingred as we may suppose those of a salamander her matted griesly hair made irreverend by her wickedness her clouted headdress being half off spread about her fat ears and brawny neck her livid lips parched and working violently her broad chin in convulsive motion her wide mouth by reason of the contraction of her forehead which seemed to be halflost in its own frightful furrows splitting her face as it were into two parts and her huge tongue hideously rolling in it heaving puffing as if for breath her bellowsshaped and variouscoloured breasts ascending by turns to her chin and descending out of sight with the violence of her gaspings  This was the spectacle as recollection has enabled me to describe it that this wretch made to my eye when I approached her bedside surrounded as I said by her s  ffragans and daughters who surveyed her with scouling frighted attention which one might easily see had more in it of horror and selfconcern and  selfcondemnation  too than of love or pity as who should say See what we ourselves must one day be  As soon as she saw me her naturally big voice more hoarsened by her ravings broke upon me O Mr Belford O Sir see what I am come toSee what I am brought toTo have such a cursed crew about me and not one of them to take care of meBut to let me tumble down  stairs  so distant from the room I went from so distant from the room I meant to go to O cursed be every careless devilMay this or worse be their fate every one of them  And then she cursed and swore more vehemently and the more as two or three of them were excusing themselves on the score of their being at that time as unable to help themselves as she  As soon as she had cleared the passage of her throat by the oaths and curses which her wild impatience made her utter she began in a more hollow and whining strain to  bemoan herself And here said sheHeaven grant me patience clenching and unclenching her hands am I to die thus miserablyof a broken leg in my old agesnatch'd away by means of my own intemperance Selfdo SelfundoneNo time for my affairs No time to repentAnd in a few hours OhOhwith another long howling OhUgho a kind of screaming key terminating it who knows who can tell  where  I shall beOh that indeed I never never had had a being  What could one say to such a wretch as this whose whole life has been spent in the most diffusive wickedness and who has more souls to answer for of both sexes than the best Divine in England ever savedYet I told her She must be patient That her violence made her worse And that if she would compose herself she might get into a frame more proper for her present circumstances  Who I interrupted she  I  get into a better frame  I  who can neither cry nor pray Yet already feel the torments of the damn'd What mercy can I expect What hope is left for meThen that sweet creature That incomparable Miss HarloweShe it seems is dead and goneO that cursed Man Had it not been for  him  I had never had This the most crying of all my sins to answer for And then she set up another howl  And  is  she deadIndeed dead proceeded she when her howl was overO what an angel have I been the means of destroyingFor tho' it was that wicked man's fault that ever she was in my house yet it was Mine and Yours and Yours and Yours Devils as we all were turning to Sally to Polly and to one or two more that he did not do her justice And That  That  is my curse and will one day be yours And then again she howled  I still advised patience I said that if her time was so short as she apprehended it to be the more ought she to endeavour to compose herself And then she would at least die with more ease to herselfand satisfaction to her friends I was  going  to sayBut the word  die  put her into a violent raving and thus she broke in upon me  Die  did you say Sir  Die  I  will not  I  cannot  dieI know not  how  to die  Die  SirAnd  must  I then dieLeave this worldI cannot bear itAnd  who brought  You  hither Sir her eyes striking fire at me Who brought you hither to tell me I must  die  SirI cannot I will not leave this world Let others die who wish for another who expect a betterI have had my plagues in This but would compound for all future hopes so as I may be nothing after This And then she howled and bellowed by turns  By my faith Lovelace I trembled in every joint and looking upon  her  who spoke This and roared Thus and upon the  company  round me I more than once thought myself to be in one of the infernal mansions  Yet will I proceed and try for thy good if I can shock thee but half as much with my descriptions as I was shocked by what I saw and heard  SallyPollySister Carter said she did you not tell me I might  recover  Did not the  surgeon  tell me I might  And so you  may  cry'd Sally Mr Garon says you may if you'll be patient But as I have often told you this blessed morning you are readier to take despair from your own fears than comfort from all the hope we can give you  Yet cry'd the wretch interrupting does not Mr Belford and to  him  you have told the truth tho' you won't to  me  Does not he tell me I shall  die  I cannot bear it I cannot bear the  thoughts  of dying  And then but that half a dozen at once endeavoured to keep down her violent hands would she have beaten herself as it seems she had often attempted to do from the time the surgeon popt out the word  mortification  to her  Well but to what purpose said I turning aside to her Sister and to Sally and Polly are these hopes given her if the gentlemen of the faculty give her over You should let her know the worst and then she  must  submit for there is no running away from death If she has any matters to settle put her upon settling them and do not by telling her she will live when there is no room to expect it take from her the opportunity of doing needful things Do the surgeons actually give her over  They do whispered they Her gross habit they say gives no hopes We have sent for both surgeons whom we expect every minute  Both the surgeons who are French for Mrs Sinclair has heard Tourville launch out in the praise of French Surgeons came in while we were thus talking I retired to the further end of the room and threw up a window for a little air being half poisoned by the effluvia arising from so many contaminated carcasses which gave me no imperfect idea of the stench of gaols which corrupting the ambient air give what is called the prisondistemper  I came back to the bedside when the surgeons had inspected the fracture and asked them If there were any expectation of her life  One of them whispered me There was none That she had a strong fever upon her which alone in such a habit would probably do the business and that the mortification had visibly gained upon her since they were there six hours ago  Will amputation save her Her affairs and her mind want settling A few days added to her life may be of service to her in both respects  They told me the fracture was high in her leg that the knee was greatly bruised that the mortification in all probability had spread halfway of the  Femur  And then getting me between them three or four of the women joining us and listening with their mouths open and all the signs of ignorant wonder in their faces as there appeared of selfsufficiency in those of the artists did they by turns fill my ears with an anatomical description of the leg and thigh running over with terms of art of the  Tarsus  the  Metatarsus  the  Tibia  the  Fibula  the  Patella  the  Os Tali  the  Os Tibiae  the  Tibialis Posticus  and  Tibialis Anticus  up to the  Os Femoris  to the  Acetabulum  of the  Os Ischion  the  Great Troch  nter Glutes Triceps Levidus  and  Little Rotators  in short of all the muscles cartilages and bones that constitute the leg and thigh from the great toe to the hip as if they would shew me that all their science had penetrated their heads no farther than their mouths while Sally lifted up her hands with a Laud bless me Are all Surgeons so learnedBut at last both the gentlemen declared That if she and her friends would consent to amputation they would whip off her leg in a moment  Mrs Carter asked To what purpose if the operation would not save her  Very true they said but it might be a satisfaction to the patient's friends that all was done that could be done  And so  e poor wretch was to be lanced and quartered as I may say for an experiment only And without any hope of benefit from the operation was to pay the surgeons for tormenting h  r  I cannot but say I have a mean opinion of both these gentlemen who tho' they make a figure it seems in their way of living and boast not only a French extraction but a Paris education never will make any in their practice  How unlike my honest English friend Tomkins a plain serious intelligent man whose art lies deeper than in words who always avoids parade and jargon and endeavours to make every one as much a judge of what he is about as himself  All the time the surgeons run on with their anatomical process the wretched woman most frightfully roared and bellowed which the gentlemen who shewed themselves to be of the class of those who are not affected with the evils they do not  feel  took no other notice of than by raising  their  voices to be  heard  as she raised  hers  Being evidently more sollicitous to increase their acquaintance and to propagate the notion of their skill than to attend to the clamours of the poor wretch whom they were called in to relieve tho' by this very means like the dog and the shadow in the fable they lost both aims with me for I never was deceived in one rule which I made early to wit  That the stillest water is the deepest  while the bubbling stream only betrays shallowness and that stones and pebbles lie there so near the surface to point out the best place to ford a river dryshod  As no body cared to tell the unhappy wretch what every one apprehended must follow and what the surgeons convinced me soon would I undertook to be the denouncer of her doom Accordingly the operators being withdrawn I sat down by the bedside and said Come Mrs Sinclair let me advise you to forbear these ravings at the carel  ssnes  of those who I find at the time could take no care of themselves and since the accident  has  happened  and cannot be remedied to resolve to make the best of the matter For all this violence but enrages the malady and you will probably fall into a delirium if you give way to it which will deprive you of that reason which you ought to make the best of for the time it may be lent you  She turned her head towards me and hearing me speak with a determined  voice  and seeing me assume as determined an  air  became more calm and attentive  I went on telling her that I was glad from the hints she had given to find her concerned for her past misspent life and particularly for the part she had had in the ruin of the most excellent woman on earth That if she would compose herself and patiently submit to the consequence of an evil she had brought upon herself it might possibly be happy for her yet Mean time continued I tell me with temper and calmness Why you was so desirous to see me  She seemed to be in great confusion of thought and turned her head this way and that and at last after much hesitation said Alas for me I hardly know  what  I wanted with you When I awoke from my intemperate trance and found what a cursed way I was in my conscience smote me and I was for catching like a drowning wretch at every straw I wanted to see everybody and anybody but those I did see everybody whom I thought could give me comfort Yet could I expect none from You neither for you had declared yourself my enemy altho' I had never done you harm For what Jackey in her old tone whining thro' her nose was Miss Harlowe to youBut  she  is happyBut oh what will become of  me  Yet tell me for the surgeons have told  you  the truth no doubt tell me Shall I do well again May I recover If I  may  I will begin a new course of life As I hope to be saved I will I'll renounce you allevery one of you looking round her and scrape all I can together and live a life of penitence and when I die leave it all to charitable usesI will by my soulEvery doit of it to charityBut this once lifting up her rolling eyes and folded hands with a wrymouthed earnestness in which every muscle and feature of her face bore its part  this one timeGood God of heaven and earth but this once this once repeating those words five or six times spare thy poor creature and every hour of my life shall be penitence and atonement Upon my soul it shall  Less vehement a little less vehement said IIt is not for me who have led so free a life as you but too well know to talk to you in a reproaching strain and to set before you the iniquity you have lived in and the many souls you have helped to destroy But as you are in so penitent a way if I might advise it should be to send for a good Clergyman the purity of whose lise and manners may make all these things come from him with a better grace than they can from me  How Sir What Sir interrupting me Send for a ParsonThen you indeed think I shall die Then you think there is no room for hopeA Parson SirWho sends for a Parson while there is any hope left The sight of a Parson would be death immediate to meI cannot cannot dieNever tell me of itWhat dieWhat cut off in the midst of my sins  And then she began to rave again  I cannot bear said I rising from my seat with a stern air to see a reasonable creature behave so outrageouslyWill this vehemence think you mend the matter Will it avail you any thing Will it not rather shorten the life you are so desirous to have lengthened and deprive you of the only opportunity you can ever have to settle your affairs for both worldsThis is but the common lot And if it will be  yours  soon looking at  her  it will be also  yours  and  yours  and  yours  speaking with a raised voice and turning to every trembling devil round her for they all shook at my forcible application and  mine  also And you have reason to be thankful that you did not perish in that act of intemperance which brought you to this For it might have been your neck as  well  as your leg and then you had not had the opportunity you now have for repentanceAnd the Lord have mercy upon you into what a State might you have awaked  Then did the poor wretch set up an inarticulate frightful howl such a one as I never before heard uttered as if already pangs infernal had taken hold of her and seeing  every one halffrighted and me motioning to withdraw O pity me pity me Mr Belford cried she her words interrupted by groans I find you think I shall die And  what  I may be and  where  in a very few hoursWho can tell  I told her it was in vain to flatter her It was my opinion she would not recover  I was going to readvise her to calm her spirits and endeavour to resign herself and to make the best of the opportunity yet left her but this declaration set her into a most outrageous raving She would have torn her hair and beaten her breast had not some of the wretches held her hands by force while others kept her as steady as they could lest she should again put out her newset leg So that seeing her thus incapable of advice and in a perfect phrensy I told Sally Martin that there was no bearing the room and that their best way was to send for a Minister to pray by her and to reason with her as soon as she should be capable of it  And so I left them and never was so sensible of the benefit of fresh air as I was the moment I entered the street  Nor is it to be wondered at when it is considered that to the various ill smells that will be always found in a close sickbed room since generally when the Physician comes the Air is shut out  This  of Mrs Sinclair was the more particularly offensive as to the scent of plaisters embrocations and ointments were added the stenches of spirituous liquors burnt and unburnt of all denominations For one or other of the creatures under pretence of colics gripes qualms or insurrections were continually calling for supplies of these all the time I was there And yet this is thought to be a genteel house of the sort And all the prostitutes in it are prostitutes of price and their visiters people of note  O Lovelace what lives do most of us Rakes and Libertines lead What company do we keep And for  such  company what society renounce or endeavour to make like these  What woman nice in her person and of purity in her mind and manners did she know what miry wallowers the generality of men of our class are in themselves and  constantly trough and sty with but would detest the thoughts of associating with such filthy sensualists whose favourite taste carries them to mingle with the dregs of stews brothels and commonsewers  Yet to such a choice are many worthy women betrayed by that false and inconsiderate notion raised and propagated no doubt by the author of all delusion  That a reformed Rake makes the best husband  We Rakes indeed are bold enough to suppose that women in general are as much Rakes in their  hearts  as the Libertines some of them suffer themselves to be taken with are in their  practice  A supposition therefore which it behoves persons of true honour of that Sex to discountenance by rejecting the address of every man whose character will not stand the test of that virtue which is the glory of a woman And indeed I may say of a man too Why should it not  How indeed can it be if this point be duly weighed that a man who thinks  alike of all the Sex  and knows it to be in the  power  of a wife to do him the greatest dishonour man can receive and doubts not her  will  to do it if opportunity offer and importunity be not wanting That  such  a one from  principle  should be a good husband to  any  woman And indeed little do innocents think what a total revolution of manners what a change of fixed habits nay what a conquest of a  bad nature  is required to make a man a good husband a worthy father and true friend from  principle  especially when it is considered that it is not in a man's own power to reform when he will  This  to say nothing of my own experience thou hast found in the progress of thy attempts upon the divine Miss Harlowe For whose remorses could be either deeper or more frequent and whose more transient  Don't be disgusted that I mingle such grave reflections as these with my narratives It becomes me in my present way of thinking to do so when I see in Miss Harlowe how all human excellence and in poor Belton how all inhuman libertinism and am near seeing in this abandon'd woman how all diabolical profligateness end And glad should I be for your own sake for your  splendid family's sake and for the sake of all your intimates and acquaintance that you were labouring under the same impressions that so  we  who have been companions in and promoters of one another's wickedness might join in a general atonement to the utmost of our power  I came home reflecting upon all these things more edifying to me than any Sermon I could have heard preached And I shall conclude this long letter with observing that altho' I left the wretched howler in a high phrensyfit which was excessively shocking to the bystanders yet her phrensy is the happiest part of her dreadful condition For when she is  herself  as it is called what must be her reflections upon her past profligate life throughout which it has been her constant delight and business devillike to make others as wicked as herself What must her terrors be a Hell already begun in her mind on looking forward to the dreadful State she is now upon the verge ofBut I drop my trembling pen  To have done with so shocking a subject at once we shall take notice That Mr Belford in a future letter writes that the miserable woman to the surprize of the operators themselves thro' hourly increasing tortures of body and mind held out so long as till Thursday Sept    And then died in such agonies as terrified into a transitory penitence all the wretches about her  LETTER LXXIX Colonel  MORDEN  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Sunday Night Sept    Dear Sir  ACcording to my promise I send you an account of matters here Poor Mrs Norton was so very ill upon the road that slowly as the herse moved and the chariot followed I was afraid we should not have got her to St Alban's We put up there as I had intended I was in hopes that she would have been better for the stop But I was forced to leave her behind me I ordered the servantmaid you was so considerately kind as to send down with her to be very careful of her and left the chariot to  attend her She deserves all the regard that can be paid her not only upon my cousin's account but on her own She is an excellent woman  When we were within five miles of Harloweplace I put on a handgallop I ordered the herse to proceed more slowly still the crossroad we were in being rough and having more time before us than I wanted for I wished not the herse to be in till near dusk  I got to my cousin's about o'clock You may believe I found a mournful house You desire me to be very minute  At my entrance into the court they were all in motion Every servant whom I saw had swelled eyes and looked with so much concern that at first I apprehended some new disaster had happened in the family  Mr John and Mr Antony Harlowe and Mrs Hervey were there They all helped on one another's grief as they had before each other's hardness of heart  My cousin James met me at the entrance of the hall His countenance expressed a fixed concern and he desired me to excuse his behaviour the last time I was there  My cousin Arabella came to me full of tears and grief O cousin said she hanging upon my arm I dare not ask you any questionsAbout the approach of the herse I suppose she meant  I myself was full of grief and without going farther or speaking sat down in the hall in the first chair  The brother sat down on one hand of me the sister on the other Both were silent The latter in tears  Mr Antony Harlowe came to me soon after His face was overspread with all the appearance of woe He requested me to walk into the parlour where as he said were all his fellowmourners  I attended him in My cousins James and Arabella followed me  A perfect concert of grief as I may say broke out the moment I entered the parlour  My cousin Harlowe the dear creature's Father as soon as he saw me said O cousin cousin of all our family you are the only one who have nothing to reproach yourself withYou are a happy man  The poor Mother bowing her head to me in speechless grief sat with her handkerchief held to her eyes with one hand The other hand was held by her sister Hervey between both hers Mrs Hervey weeping upon it  Near the window sat Mr John Harlowe His face and his body were turned from the sorrowing company His eyes were red and swelled  My cousin Antony at his reentering the parlour went towards Mrs HarloweDon'tdear sister said heThen towards my cousin HarloweDon'tdear brotherDon't thus give wayAnd without being able to say another word went to a corner of the parlour and wanting himself the comfort he would fain have given sunk into a chair and audibly sobbed  Miss Arabella followed her uncle Antony as he walked in before me and seemed as if she would have spoken to the pierced mother some words of comfort But she was unable to utter them and got behind her mother's chair and inclining her face over it on the unhappy lady's shoulder seemed to claim the consolation that indulgent parent used but then was unable to afford her  Young Mr Harlowe with all his vehemence of spirit was now subdued His selfreproaching conscience no doubt was the cause of it  And what Sir must their thoughts be which at that moment in a manner deprived them all of motion and turned their speech into sighs and groansHow to be pitied how greatly to be pitied all of them But how much to be cursed that abhorred Lovelace who as it seems by arts uncommon and a villainy without example has been the sole author of a woe so complicated and extensiveGod judge me asBut I stopThe man is your friendHe already suffers you tell me in his intellectRestore him heaven to ThatIf I find the matter come out as I  apprehend  it willIndeed her own hints of his usage of her as in her Will and in her first Letter to me are enoughNor think my beloved cousin thou darling of my heart that thy gentle spirit breathing charity and forgiveness to the vilest of men shall avail him  But once more I stopForgive me SirWho could behold such a scene who could recollect it in order to  describe it as minutely as you wished me to relate how this unhappy family were affected on this sad occasion every one of the mourners nearly related to himself and not be exasperated against the author of all  As I was the only person grieved as I was myself from whom any of them at that instant could derive comfort Let us not said I my dear cousin approaching the inconsolable Mother give way to a grief which however just can now avail us nothing We hurt ourselves and cannot recall the dear creature for whom we mourn Nor would you wish it if you knew with what assurances of eternal happiness she left the worldShe is happy MadamDepend upon it she is happy And comfort yourselves with that assurance  O cousin cousin cried the unhappy mother withdrawing her hand from her sister Hervey and pressing mine with it You know not what a child I have lostThen in a lower voice And  how  lostThat it is that makes the loss insupportable  They all joined in a kind of melancholy chorus and each accused him and herself and some of them one another But the eyes of all in turn were cast upon my cousin James as the person who had kept up the general resentment against so sweet a creature While he was hardly able to bear his own remorse Nor Miss Harlowe hers She breaking out into words How tauntingly did I write to her How barbarously did I insult her Yet how patiently did she take itWho would have thought she had been so near her endO brother brotherbut for  you  But for  you    Double not upon me said he my own woesI have every thing before me that has passedI thought only to reclaim a dear creature that had erred I intended not to break her tender heartBut it was the villainous Lovelace who did thatNot any of usYet cousin did she not attribute all to  me  I fear she didTell me only did she name  me  did she  speak  of me in her last hours I hope she who could forgive the greatest villain on earth and plead that he may be safe from our vengeance I  hope  she could forgive  me    She died blessing you all and justified rather than condemned your severity to her  Then they set up another general lamentation We see said her father Enough we see in her heartpiercing letters to us what a happy frame she was in a few days before her death But did it hold to the last Had she no repinings Had the dear child no heartburnings  None at allI never saw and never shall see so blessed a  departure  And no wonder for I never heard of such a  preparation  Every hour for weeks together was taken up in it Let this be our comfortWe need only to wish for so happy an end for ourselves and for those who are nearest to our hearts We may any of us be grieved for acts of unkindness to her But had all happened that once she wished for she could not have made a happier perhaps not so happy an end  Dear soul and dear sweet soul the Father Uncles Sister my cousin Hervey cried out all at once in accents of anguish inexpressibly affecting  We must for ever be disturbed for those acts of unkindness to so sweet a child cried the unhappy MotherIndeed indeed softly to her Sister Hervey I have been too passive much too passive in this caseThe temporary quiet I have been so studious all my life to preserve has cost me everlasting disquiet  There she stopt  Dear Sister  was all Mrs Hervey could say  I have done but half my duty to the dearest and most meritorious of children resumed the sorrowing motherNay  not  halfHow have we hardened our hearts against her  Again her tears choaked up the passage of her words  My  dearest dearest Sister  again was all Mrs Hervey could say  Would to Heaven proceeded exclaiming the poor mother I had but  once  seen her Then turning to my Cousin James and his SisterO my Son O my Arabella if WE were to receive as little mercy  And there again she stopt her tears interrupting her further speech Every one all the time remaining silent  their countenances shewing a grief in their hearts too big for expression  Now you see Mr Belford that my dearest cousin could be allowed all her meritWhat a dreadful thing is afterreflection upon a conduct so perverse and unnatural  O this cursed friend of yours Mr Belford This detested LovelaceTo him To him is owing  Pardon me Sir I will lay down my pen till I have recovered my temper  One in the Morning  IN vain Sir have I endeavoured to compose myself to rest You wished me to be very particular and I cannot help it This melancholy subject fills my whole mind I will proceed tho' it be midnight  About six o'clock the herse came to the outward gate The Parishchurch is at some distance but the wind sitting fair the afflicted family were struck just before it came into a fresh fit of grief on hearing the funeral bell tolled in a very solemn manner A respect as it proved and as they all guessed paid to the memory of the dear deceased out of officious love as the herse passed near the church  Judge when their grief was so great in expectation of it what it must be when it arrived  A servant came in to acquaint us with what its lumbering heavy noise up the paved inner courtyard apprized us of before  He spoke not He could not speak He looked bowed and withdrew  I stept out No one else could then stir Her brother however soon followed me  When I came to the door I beheld a sight very affecting  You have heard Sir how universally my dear cousin was beloved By the poor and middling sort especially no young lady was ever so much beloved And with reason She was the common patroness of all the honest poor in her neighbourhood  It is natural for us in every deep and sincere grief to interest all we know in what is so concerning to ourselves The servants of the family it seems had told  their  friends  and those  theirs  that tho' living their dear young lady could not be received nor looked upon her body was permitted to be brought home The space of time was so confined that those who knew when she died must easily guess near the time the herse was to come A herse passing thro' country villages and from London however slenderly attended for the chariot as I have said waited upon poor Mrs Norton takes every one's attention Nor was it hard to guess whose  this  must be tho' not adorned by escutcheons when the crossroads to Harloweplace were taken as soon as it came within six miles of it so that the Herse and the solemn Tolling of the Bell had drawn together at least fifty of the neighbouring men women and children and some of good appearance Not a soul of them it seems with a dry eye and each lamenting the death of this admired lady who as I am told never stirred out but somebody was the better for her  These when the coffin was taken out of the herse crouding about it hindered for a few moments its being carried in the young people struggling who should bear it and yet with respectful  whisperings  rather than clamorous  contention  A mark of veneration I had never before seen paid upon any occasion in all my travels from the underbred Many from whom noise is generally inseparable in all their emulations At last six maidens were permitted to carry it in by the six handles  The corpse was thus borne with the most solemn respect into the hall and placed for the present upon two stools there The plates and emblems and inscription set every one gazing upon the Lid and admiring The more when they were told that all was of her own ordering They wished to be permitted a sight of the corpse but rather mentioned this as their wish than their hope When they had all satisfied their curiosity and remarked upon the emblems they dispersed with blessings upon her memory and with tears and lamentations pronouncing her to be happy and inferring that were  She  not so what would become of Them While others ran over with repetitions of the good she delighted to do Nor were there wanting those among them who heaped curses upon the man who was the author of her fall  The servants of the family then got about the coffin They could not before And that afforded a new scene of sorrow But a silent one for they spoke only by their eyes and by sighs looking upon the lid and upon one another by turns with hands lifted up The presence of their young master possibly might awe them and cause their grief to be expressed only in dumb shew  As for Mr James Harlowe who had accompanied me but withdrew when he saw the croud he stood looking upon the lid when the people had left it with a fixed attention Yet I dare say knew not a symbol or letter upon it at that moment had the question been asked him In a profound reverie he stood his arms folded his head on one side and marks of stupefaction imprinted upon every feature  But when the corpse was carried into the lesser parlour adjoining to the hall which she used to call  her  parlour and put on a table in the middle of the room and the Father and Mother the two Uncles her Aunt Hervey and her Sister came in joining her Brother and me with trembling feet and eager woe the scene was still more affecting Their sorrow was heightened no doubt by the remembrance of their unforgiving severity And now seeing before them the receptacle that contained the glory of their family who so lately was driven thence by their indiscreet violence never never more to be restored to them no wonder that their grief was more than common grief  They would have withheld the Mother it seems from coming in But when they could not tho' undetermined before they all bore her company led on by an impulse they could not resist The poor lady but just cast her eye upon the coffin and then snatched it away retiring with passionate grief towards the window yet addressing herself with clasped hands as if to her beloved daughter O my child my child cried she thou pride of my hope Why was I not permitted to speak pardon and peace to theeO forgive thy cruel mother  Her Son his heart then softened as his eyes shewed besought her to withdraw And her woman looking in at that moment he called her to assist him in conducting  her lady into the middle parlour And then returning met his Father going out at the door who also had but just cast his eye on the coffin and yielded to my entreaties to withdraw  His grief was too deep for utterance till he saw his son coming in and then fetching a heavy groan Never said he was sorrow like my sorrowO Son Sonin a reproaching accent his face turned from him  I attended him thro' the middle parlour endeavouring to console him His Lady was there in agonies She took his eye He made a motion towards her O my dear said heBut turning short his eyes as full as his heart he hastened thro' to the great parlour And when there he desired me to leave him to himself  Her uncles and her sister looked and turned away looked and turned away very often upon the emblems in silent sorrow Mrs Hervey would have read to them the inscriptionThese words she did read  Here the wicked cease from troubling  But could read no further Her tears fell in large drops upon the plate she was contemplating and yet she was desirous of gratifying a curiosity that mingled impatience with her grief because she could  not  gratify it altho' she often wiped her eyes as they flowed  Judge you Mr Belford for you have great humanity how  I  must be affected Yet was I forced to try to comfort them All  But here I will close this letter in order to send it to you in the morning early Nevertheless I will begin another upon supposition that my doleful prolixity will not be disagreeable to you Indeed I am altogether indisposed for Rest as I mentioned before So can do nothing but write I have also more melancholy scenes to paint My pen if I may so say is untired These scenes are fresh in my memory And I myself perhaps may owe to you the favour of a reviewal of them with such other papers as you shall think proper to oblige me with when heavy grief has given way to milder melancholy  My servant in his way to you with this letter shall call at St Alban's upon the good woman that he may inform you how she does Miss Arabella asked me after her when I withdrew to my chamber to which she complaisantly  accompanied me She was much concerned at the bad way we left her in and said her mother would be more so  No wonder that the dear departed who foresaw the remorse that would fall to the lot of this unhappy family when they came to have the news of her death confirmed to them was so grieved for their apprehended grief and endeavoured to comfort them by her posthumous letters But it was still a greater generosity in her to try to excuse them to me as she did when we were alone together a few hours before she died and to aggravate more than as far as I can find she ought to have done the only error she was ever guilty of The more freely however perhaps exalted creature that I might think the better of her friends although at her own expence I am dear Sir  Your faithful and obedient Servant  WM MORDEN  LETTER LXXX Colonel  MORDEN  In Continuation  WHEN the unhappy mourners were all retired I directed the lid of the coffin to be unscrewed and caused some fresh aromatics and flowers to be put into it  The corpse was very little altered notwithstanding the journey The sweet smile remained  The maids who brought the flowers were ambitious of strewing them about it They poured forth fresh lamentations over her each wishing she had been so happy as to have been allowed to attend her in London One of them particularly who is it seems my cousin Arabella's personal servant was more clamorous in her grief than the rest and the moment she turned her back all the others allowed she had reason for it I enquired afterwards about her and found that this creature was set over my dear cousin when she was confined to her chamber by their indiscreet severity  Good heaven that they should treat and suffer thus to be treated a young lady who was qualified to give laws to all her family  When my cousins were told that the lid was unscrew'd they press'd in again all but the mournful Father and Mother as if by consent Mrs Hervey kissed her pale lips Flower of the world was all she could say and gave place to Miss Arabella who kissing the forehead of  her  whom she had so cruelly treated could only say to my cousin James looking upon the corpse and upon him O BrotherWhile he taking the fair lifeless hand kissed it and retreated with precipitation  Her two Uncles were speechless They seemed to wait each other's example whether to look upon the corpse or not I ordered the lid to be replaced and then they pressed forward as the others again did to take a last farewel of the casket which so lately contained so rich a jewel  Then it was that the grief of each found fluenter expression and the fair corpse was addressed to with all the tenderness that the sincerest love and warmest admiration could inspire by each according to their different degrees of relationship as if none of them had before looked upon her She was their very Niece both uncles said The injured Saint her uncle Harlowe The same smiling Sister ArabellaThe dear creature all of themThe same benignity of countenance The same sweet composure The same natural dignity  She  was questionless happy That sweet smile betokened  her  being so  Themselves  most unhappyAnd then once more the Brother took the lifeless hand and vowed Revenge upon it on the cursed author of all this distress  The unhappy parents proposed to take one last view and farewel of their once darling daughter The Father was got to the parlourdoor after the inconsolable Mother But neither of them were able to enter it The Mother said he must once more see the child of her heart or she should never enjoy herself But they both agreed to refer their melancholy curiosity till the next day and hand in hand retired inconsolable and speechless both their faces overspread with woe and turned from each other as unable each to behold the distress of the other  When all were withdrawn I retired and sent for my cousin James and acquainted him with his sister's request  in relation to the discourse to be pronounced at her interrment telling him how necessary it was that the Minister whoever he were to be should have the earliest notice given him that the case would admit  He lamented the death of the reverend Dr Lewen who as he said was a great admirer of his sister as she was of him and would have been the fittest of all men for that office  He spoke with great asperity of Mr Brand upon whose light enquiry after his sister's character in town he was willing to lay some of the blame due to himself  Mr Melvill Dr Lewen's assistant must he said be the man and he praised him for his abilities his elocution and unexceptionable manners and promised to engage him early in the morning  He called out his Sister and she was of his opinion So I left this upon them  They both with no little warmth hinted their disapprobation of you Sir for their sister's Executor on the score of your intimate friendship with the author of her ruin  You must not resent any thing I shall communicate to you of what they say on this occasion Depending that you will not I shall write with the greater freedom  I told them how much my dear cousin was obliged to your friendship and humanity The injunctions she had laid you under and your own inclination to observe them I said That you were a man of honour That you were desirous of consulting me because you would not willingly give offence to any of them and that I was very fond of cultivating your favour and correspondence  They said There was no need of an Executor out of their family and they hoped that you Sir would relinquish so  unnecessary  a trust as they called it My cousin James declared that he would write to you as soon as the funeral was over to desire that you would do so upon proper assurances that all that the Will prescribed should be performed  I said You were a man of resolution That I thought he would hardly succeed for that you made a point of honour of it  I then shewed them their Sister's posthumous Letter to you in which she confesses her obligations to you and regard for you and for your future welfare  See page  You may believe Sir they were extremely affected with the perusal of it  They were surprized that I had given up to you the proceed of her grandfather's estate since his death I told them plainly that they must thank themselves if any thing disagreeable to them occurred from their sister's devise deserted and thrown into the hands of strangers as she had been  They said they would report all I had said to their father and mother adding That great as their trouble was they found they had more still to come But if Mr Belford  were to be  the Executor of her Will contrary to their hopes they besought me to take the trouble of transacting every thing with you that a friend of the man to whom they owed all their calamity might not appear to them  They were extremely moved at the text their sister had chosen for the subject of the funeral discourse  See the Will page  I had extracted from the Will that article supposing it probable that I might not so soon have an opportunity to shew them the Will itself as would otherwise have been necessary on account of the interrment Which cannot be delayed  Monday morning between Eight and Nine  THE unhappy family are preparing for a mournful meeting at breakfast Mr James Harlowe who has had as little rest as I has written to Mr Melvill who has promised to draw up a brief Eulogium on the deceased Miss Howe is expected here byandby to see for the last time her beloved friend  Miss Howe by her messenger desires she may not be taken any notice of She shall not tarry six minutes was the word Her desire will be easily granted her  Her servant who brought the request if it were denied was to return and meet her for she was ready to set out in her chariot when he got on horseback  If he met her not with the refusal he was to stay here till she came I am Sir  Your faithful humble Servant  WILLIAM MORDEN  LETTER LXXXI Colonel  MORDEN  In Continuation  Monday Afternoon Sept    SIR  WE are such bad company here to one another that it is some relief to retire and write  I was summoned to breakfast about half an hour after nine Slowly did the mournful congress meet Each liftless and spiritless took our place with swollen eyes inquiring without expecting any tolerable account how each had rested  The sorrowing Mother gave for answer That she should never more know what Rest was  By the time we were well seated the bell ringing the outward gate opening a chariot rattling over the pavement of the courtyard put them into emotion  I left them and was just time enough to give Miss Howe my hand as she alighted Her maid in tears remaining in the chariot  I think you told me Sir you never saw Miss Howe She is a fine graceful young lady A fixed melancholy on her whole aspect overclouded a vivacity and fire which nevertheless darted nowandthen through the awful gloom I shall ever respect her for her love to my dear cousin  Never did I think said she as she gave me her hand to enter more these doors But living or dead my  Clarissa  brings me after her anywhither  She entered with me the little parlour The moment she saw the coffin she withdrew her hand from mine and with impatience pushed aside the lid As impatiently she removed the facecloth In a wild air she clasped her uplifted hands together and now looked upon the corpse now up to Heaven as if appealing her woes to that Her bosom heaved and flutter'd discernible thro' her handkerchief  and at last she broke silenceO SirSee you not hereSee you not herethe Glory of her SexThus by the most villainous of yoursThuslaid low  O my blessed Friend said sheMy sweet CompanionMy lovely Monitresskissing her lips at every tender invocation And is this AllIs it All of my CLARISSA's Story  Then after a short pause and a profound sigh she turned to me and then to her breathless friendBut  is  she  can  she be really deadO no noShe only sleepsAwake my beloved Friend My sweet claycold Friend awake Let thy Anna Howe revive thee my dear creatureby her warm breath revive thee And kissing her again Let my warm lips animate thy cold ones  Then sighing again as from the bottom of her heart and with an air as if disappointed that she answered not And can such perfection end thusAnd art thou really and indeed flown from thy Anna HoweO my unkind CLARISSA  She was silent a few moments and then seeming to recover herself she turned to meForgive forgive Mr Morden this wild frensyI am not myselfI never shall beYou know not the Excellence no not  half  the Excellence that is thus laid lowRepeating This cannot surely be All of my CLARISSA's Story  Again pausing One tear my beloved friend didst thou allow meBut this  dumb  sorrowO for a tear to ease my fullswoln heart that is just bursting  But why Sir why Mr Morden was she sent  hither  Why not to  me  She has no Father no Mother no Relations no not  one  They had all renounced her I was her sympathizing friendAnd had not I the best right to my dear creature's remainsAnd must Names without Nature be preferred to such a Love as mine  Again she kissed her lips each cheek her foreheadand sighed as if her heart would break  But why why said she was I withheld from seeing my dearest dear friend before she commenced AngelDelaying still and  too easily persuaded  to delay the friendly visit that my heart panted after what pain will this reflection give meO my blessed Friend Who knows  who knows had I come in time what my cordial comfortings might have done for thee  Butlooking round her as if she apprehended seeing some of the familyOne more kiss my Angel my Friend my evertoberegretted lost Companion And let me fly this hated house which I never loved but for thy sakeAdieu then my dearest CLARISSA  Thou  art happy I doubt not as thou assuredst me in thy last letterO may we meet and rejoice together where no villainous  Lovelaces  no hardhearted  Relations  will ever shock our innocence or ruffle our felicity  Again she was silent unable to go tho' seeming to intend it struggling as it were with her grief and heaving with anguish At last happily a flood of tears gushed from her eyesNowNowsaid she shall Ishall Ibe easier But for this kindly relief my heart would have burst asunderMore many more tears than these are due to my CLARISSA whose counsel has done for me what mine could not do for herBut why looking earnestly upon her her hands clasped and lifted upBut why do I thus lament the HAPPY And that thou art so is my comfort It is it is my dear creature kissing her again  Excuse me Sir turning to me who was as much moved as herself I loved the dear creature as never woman loved another Excuse my frantic grief How has the Glory of her Sex fallen a victim to villainy and to hardheartedness  Madam said I they All have itNow indeed they have it  And let them have itI should bely my Love for the friend of my heart were I to pity themBut how unhappy am I looking upon the Corpse that I saw her not before these Eyes were shut before these Lips were for ever closedOh Sir you know not the wisdom that continually flowed from these Lips when she spokeNor what a Friend I have lost  Then surveying the Lid she seemed to take in at once the meaning of the emblems And this gave her so much fresh grief that tho' she several times wiped her eyes she was unable to read the inscription and texts Turning  therefore to me Favour me Sir I pray you by a line with the description of these emblems and with these texts And if I might be allowed a lock of the dear creature's hair  I told her that her Executor would order both and would also send her a copy of her Will in which she would find the most grateful remembrances of her Love for her whom she calls  The Sister of her Heart    Justly said she does she call me so for we had but one heart but one soul between us And now my better half is torn from me  what shall I do  But looking round her on a servant's stepping by the door as if again she had apprehended it was some of the familyOnce more said she a solemn an everlasting adieuAlas for  me  a solemn an everlasting adieu  Then again embracing her face with both her hands and kissing it and afterwards the hands of the dear deceased first one then the other she gave me her hand and quitting the room with precipitation rush'd into her chariot and when there with profound sighs and a fresh burst of tears unable to speak she bowed her head to me and was driven away  The inconsolable company saw how much I had been moved on my return to them Mr James Harlowe had been telling them what had passed between him and me And finding myself unfit for company and observing that they broke off talk at my comingin I thought it proper to leave them to their consultations  And here I will put an end to this letter for indeed Sir the very recollection of this affecting scene has left me nearly as unable to proceed as I was just after it to converse with my cousins I am Sir with great truth  Your most obedient humble Servant  WILLIAM MORDEN  LETTER LXXXII Colonel  MORDEN  In Continuation  Tuesday morning Sept    THE good Mrs Norton is arrived a little amended in her spirits Owing to the very posthumous letters  as I may call them which you Mr Belford as well as I apprehended would have had fatal effects upon her  I cannot but attribute this to the right turn of her mind It seems she has been inured to afflictions and has lived in a constant hope of a  better  life and having no acts of unkindness to the dear deceased to reproach herself with is most considerately resolved to exert her  utmost  fortitude in order to comfort the sorrowing Mother  O Mr Belford how does the character of my dear departed cousin rise upon me from every mouthHad she been my own child or my sisterBut do you think that the man who occasioned this great this extended ruinBut I forbear  The Will is not to be looked into till the funeral rites are performed Preparations are making for the solemnity and the servants as well as principals of all the branches of the family are put into deep mourning  I have seen Mr Melvill He is a serious and sensible man I have given him particulars to go upon in the discourse he is to pronounce at the funeral But had the less need to do this as I find he is extremely well acquainted with the whole unhappy story and was a personal admirer of my dear cousin and a sincere lamenter of her misfortunes and death The reverend Dr Lewen who is but very lately dead was his particular friend and had once intended to recommend him to her favour  I AM just returned from attending the afflicted parents in an effort they made to see the corpse of their beloved child They had requested my company and that of the good Mrs Norton A last leave the Mother said she  must  take  An  effort  however it was and no more The moment they came in sight of the coffin before the lid could be put aside O my dear said the Father retreating I cannot I find I cannot bear itHad IHad IHad I never been hardheartedThen turning round to his Lady he had but just time to catch her in his arms and prevent her sinking on the floor O my dearest life said he This is too muchToo much indeedLet us let us retire Mrs Norton who attracted by the awful  receptacle had but just left the good Lady hastened to herDear dear woman cried the unhappy Parent flinging her arms about her neck Bear me bear me henceO my child my child My own Clarissa Harlowe Thou pride of my life so latelyNever never more must I behold thee  I supported the unhappy father Mrs Norton the sinking mother into the next parlour She threw herself on a settee there He into an elbowchair by her The good woman at her feet her arms clasped round her waist The two Mothers as I may call them of my beloved cousin thus tenderly engagedWhat a variety of distress in these woeful scenes  The unhappy father in endeavouring to comfort his lady loaded himself Would to God my dear said he would to God I had no more to charge myself with than you have  You  relented  You  would have prevailed upon  me  to relent  The greater my fault said she when I knew that displeasure was carried too high to acquiesce as I did What a barbarous parent was I to let two angry children make me forget that I was mother to a thirdTo  such  a third  Mrs Norton used arguments and prayers to comfort herO my dear Norton answered the unhappy lady You was the dear creature's  more natural  MotherWould to heaven I had no more to answer for than  you have  Thus the unhappy pair unavailingly recriminated till my cousin Hervey entered and with Mrs Norton conducted up to her own chamber the inconsolable Mother The two Uncles and Mr Hervey came in at the same time and prevailed upon the afflicted Father to retire with them to hisBoth giving up all thoughts of ever seeing more the child whose death was so deservedly regretted by them  Time only Mr Belford can combat with advantage such a heavy deprivation as this Advice will not do while the loss is recent Nature will have way given to it and so it ought till sorrow has in a manner exhausted itself and then Reason and Religion will come in seasonably with their powerful aids to raise the drooping heart  I see here no face that is the same I saw at my first arrival Proud and haughty every countenance then unyielding to intreaty Now how greatly are they humbledThe utmost distress is apparent in every protracted feature and in every bursting muscle of each disconsolate mourner Their eyes which so lately flashed anger and resentment now are turned to every one that approaches them as if imploring pity  Could ever wilful hardheartedness be more severely punished  The following lines of Juvenal are upon the whole applicable to this House and Family I have revolved them many times since Sunday evening  Humani generis mores tibi nôsse volenti  Sufficit una domus paucos consume dies  Dicere te miserum postquam illin  veneris aude  Let me add That Mrs Norton has communicated to the family the posthumous letter sent her This letter affords a foundation for  future  consolation to them but at  present  it has newpointed their grief by making them reflect on their cruelty to so excellent a Daughter Niece and Sister  This letter contains in substance  'Her thanks to the good woman for her care of her in her infancy for her good instructions and the excellent example she had set her with selfaccusations of a vanity and presumption which lay lurking in her heart unknown to herself till her calamities obliging her to look into herself brought them to light  'She expatiates upon the benefit of afflictions to a mind modest fearful and diffident  'She comforts her on her early death having finished as she says her  probatory course  at so early a time of life when many are not ripened by the Sunshine of Divine Grace for a better till they are or years of age  'I hope  says she  that my father will grant the request I have made to him in my last Will to let you pass the remainder of your days at my  Dairyhouse  as it used to be called where once I promised myself to be happy in you Your discretion prudence and oeconomy my dear good woman will make your presiding over the concerns of that house as beneficial to them as it can be convenient to you For  your  sake my dear Mrs Norton I hope they will make you this offer And if they do I hope you will accept of it for  theirs  '  She remembers herself to her fosterbrother in a very kind manner And charges her for his sake that she will not take too much to heart what has befallen her  She concludes as follows  'Remember me in the last place to all my kind wellwishers of your acquaintance and to those whom I used to call MY POOR They will be GOD'S Poor if they trust in Him I have taken such care that I hope they will not be losers by my death Bid them therefore rejoice and do You also my reverend comforter and sustainer as well in my darker as in my fairer days likewise rejoice that I am so soon delivered from the evils that were before me and that I am NOW when this comes to your hand as I humbly trust exulting in the mercies of a gracious God who has conducted me thro' the greatest trials in safety and put so happy an end to all my temptations and distresses And who I most humbly trust will in his own good time give us a joyful meeting in the regions of eternal blessedness'  I am dear Sir  Your faithful humble Servant  WM MORDEN  LETTER LXXXIII Colonel  MORDEN  In Continuation  Thursday Night Sept    WE are just returned from the solemnization of the last mournful Rite My cousin James and his Sister Mr and Mrs Hervey and  their  daughter a young Lady whose affection for my departed Cousin shall ever bind me to her my cousins John and Antony Harlowe myself and some other more distant relations of the names of Fuller and Allinson who to testify their respect to the memory of the dear deceased had put themselves in mourning selfinvited attended it  The Father and Mother would have joined in these last honours had they been able But they were both very much indisposed and continue to be so  The inconsolable Mother told Mrs Norton that the two Mothers of the sweetest Child in the world ought not on this occasion to be separated She therefore desired her to stay with her  The whole solemnity was performed with great decency and order The distance from Harloweplace to the Church is about half a mile All the way the corpse was attended by great numbers of people of all conditions  It was nine when it entered the church Every corner of which was cro  ded Such a profound such a silent respect did I never see paid at the funeral of princes An attentive sadness overspread the face of All  The Eulogy pronounced by Mr Melvill was a very pathetic one He wiped his own eyes often and made every body present still oftener wipe theirs  The auditors were most particularly affected when he told them that the solemn text was her own choice  He enumerated her fine qualities naming with honour their late worthy Pastor for his authority  Every enumerated excellence was witnessed to in different parts of the church in respectful whispers by different persons as of their own knowlege as I have been since informed  When he pointed to the pew where doing credit to Religion by her example she used to sit or kneel the whole auditory as one person turned to the p  w with the most respectful solemnity as if she had been herself there  When the gentleman attributed condescension and mingled dignity to her a buzzing approbation was given to the attribute throughout the church and a poor neat woman under my pew added  'That she was indeed all graciousness and would speak to any body'  Many eyes ran over when he mentioned her charities her welljudged charities And her reward was decreed from every mouth with interjections from some and these words from others  'The poor will dearly miss her'  The  chearful giver  whom God is said  to love  was allowed to be  her  And a young lady I am told said It was Miss Clarissa Harlowe's care to find out the unhappy upon a sudden distress before the sighing heart was overwhelmed by it  She had a set of poor people chosen for their remarkable honesty and ineffectual industry These voluntarily paid their last attendance on their benefactress and mingling in the church as they could croud near the eyle where the corpse was on Stands it was the less wonder that her praises from the Preacher met with such general and such grateful whispers of approbation  Some it seems there were who knowing her unhappy story remarked upon the dejected looks of the Brother and the drowned eyes of the Sister  'O what would they now give they'd warrant had they not been so hardhearted'  Others pursued as I may say the severe Father and unhappy Mother into their chambers at home  'They answered for their relenting now that it was too lateWhat must be their griefNo  wonder  they could not be present'  Several expressed their astonishment as people do every hour  'that a man could live whom such perfections could not engage to be just to her'  to be  humane  I may sayAnd who her rank and fortune considered could be so disregardful of his own  interest  had he had no other motive to be just  The good Divine led by his text just touched upon the unhappy step that was the cause of her untimely fate He attributed it to the State of things below in which there could not be absolute perfection He very politely touched upon the noble disdain she shewed tho' earnestly sollicited by a whole splendid family to join interests with a man whom she found unworthy of her esteem and confidence and who courted her with the utmost earnestness to accept of him  What he most insisted upon was the happy End she made and thence drew consolation to her relations and instruction to the auditory  In a word his performance was such as heightened the reputation which he had before in a very eminent degree obtained  When the corpse was to be carried down into the vault a very spacious one within the church there was great crouding to see the coffinlid and the devices upon it Particularly two gentlemen muffled up in cloaks pressed forward These it seems were Mr Mullins and Mr Wyerley Both of them prosessed admirers of my dear cousin  When they came near the coffin and cast their eyes upon the lid  'In that little space said Mr Mullins is included all human excellence'  And then Mr Wyerley unable to contain himself was forced to quit the church and we hear is very ill  It is said that Mr Solmes was in a remote part of the church wrapped round in a horseman's coat And that he shed tears several times But I saw him not  Another gentleman was there incognito in a pew near the entrance of the vault who had not been taken notice of but for his great emotion when he looked over his pew at the time the coffin was carried down to its last place This was Miss Howe's worthy Mr Hickman  My cousins John and Antony and their nephew James chose not to descend into the vault among their departed ancestors  Miss Harlowe was extremely affected Her  Conscience  as well as her Love was concerned on the occasion She would go down with the corpse of her dear her only Sister she said But her Brother would not permit it And her overwhelmed eye pursued the coffin till she could see no more of it And then she threw herself on the  eat and was near fainting away  I accompanied it down that I might not only satisfy myself but you Sir her Executor that it was deposited as she had directed at the feet of her grandfather  Mr Melvill came down contemplated the lid and shed a few tears over it I was  o well satisfied with his discourse and behaviour that I presented him on the solemn spot with a ring of some value and thanked him for his performance  And here I left the Remains of my beloved co  sin having bespoken my own place by the side of her coffin  On my return to Harloweplace I con  nted myself with sending my compliments to the sorrowing parents and retired to my chamber Nor am I ashamed to own that I could not help giving way to a repeated fit of humanity as soon as I entered it  I am Sir  Your most faithful and obedient Servant  WM MORDEN  P S  You will have a letter from my cousin James who hopes to prevail upon you to relinquish the Executorship It has not my encouragement  LETTER LXXXIV Mr  BELFORD  To  WILLIAM MORDEN  Esq  Saturday Sept    Dear Sir  I Once had thoughts to go down privately in order disguised to see the last solemnity performed But there was no need to give myself this melancholy trouble since your last letter so naturally describes all that passed that I have every scene before my eyes  You croud me Sir methinks into the silent slow processionNow with the sacred bier do I enter the awf  l porch Now meas  e I with solemn paces the ven  rable eyle Now emula  ive of a relationship to her placed in a near pew to the eyeattracting coffin do I listen to the moving Eulogy Now thro' the buz of gaping eyeswoln crouds do I descend into the clammy vault as a true Executor to see that part of her Will performed with my own eyes There with a soul filled with musing do I number the surrounding monuments of mortality and contemplate the present stillness of so many once busy vanities crouded all into one poor vaulted nook as if the living grudged room for the corps of those which when animated the earth the air and the waters could hardly find room for Then seeing her placed at the feet of him whose earthly delight she was and who as I find ascribes to the pleasure she gave him the prolongation of his own life  See Vol I p  sighing and with averted face I quit the solemn mansion the symbolic coffin and for ever the glory of her Sex and ascend with those who in a few years after a very short blaze of life will fill up other spaces of the same vault which now while they mourn only for her whom they jointly persecuted they press with their feet  Nor do your affecting descriptions permit me  here  to stop But ascended I mingle my tears and my praises with those of the numerous spectators I accompany the afflicted mourners back to their uncomfortable mansion and make one in the general concert of unavailing woe till  retiring as I imagine as  they  retire like them in reality I give up to new scenes of solitary and sleepless grief reflecting upon the perfections I have seen the end of and having no relief but from an indignation which makes me approve of the resentments of others against the  unhappy man  and those  equally unhappy relations of hers  to whom the irreparable loss is owing  Forgive me Sir these reflections and permit me with This to send you what you declined receiving till the Funeral was over  He gives him then an account of the money and effects which he sends him down by this opportunity for the Legatees at Harloweplace and in its neighbourhood which he desires him to dispose of according to the Will  He also sends him an account of other steps he has taken in pursuance of the Will and desires to know if Mr Harlowe expects the discharge of the funeral expences from the effects in his hands and the reinbursement of the sums advanced to the Testatrix since her Grandfather's death  These expeditious proceedings says he will convince Mr James Harlowe that I am resolved to see the Will completely executed and yet by my manner of doing it that I desire not to give unnecessary mortifications to the family since every thing that relates to them shall pass thro' your hands  LETTER LXXXV Mr  JAMES HARLOWE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  HarlowePlace  Friday Night Sept    SIR  I Hope from the character my worthy cousin Morden gives you that you will excuse the application I make to you to oblige a whole family in an affair that much concerns their peace and cannot equally concern any body else You will immediately judge Sir that This is the Executorship which my Sister has given you the trouble of by her Last Will  We shall all think ourselves extremely obliged to you if you please to relinquish this Trust to our own family  These reasons pleading for our expectation of this favour from you  First Because she never would have had the thought of troubling you Sir if she had believed any of her near relations would have taken it upon themselves  Secondly I understand that she recommends to you in the Will to trust to the honour of any of our family for the performance of such of the articles as are of a domestic nature We are  any  of us and  all  of us if you request it willing to stake our honours upon this occasion And all you can wish for as a man of honour is That the Trust be executed  We are the more concerned Sir to wish you to decline this office because of your short and accidental knowlege of the dear Testatrix and long and intimate acquaintance with the man to whom  she  owed her ruin and  we  the greatest loss and disappointment her manifold excellencies considered that ever befel a family  You will allow due weight I dare say to this plea if you make our case your own And so much the readier when I assure you that your interfering in this matter so much against our inclinations Excuse Sir my plaindealing will very probably occasion an opposition in some points where otherwise there might be none  What therefore I propose is Not that my Father should assume this Trust He is too much afflicted to undertake itNor yet myselfI might be thought too much concerned in interest But that it may be allowed to devolve upon my two uncles whose known honour and whose affection to the dear deceased nobody ever doubted And they will treat with you Sir thro' my Cousin Morden as to the points they will undertake to perform  The trouble you have already had will well intitle you to the legacy she bequeaths you together with the reimbursement of all the charges you have been at and allowance of the legacies you have discharged altho' you should not have qualified yourself to act as an Executor as I presume you have not  yet  done nor will  now  do  Your compliance Sir will oblige a family who have already distress enough upon them in the circumstance  that occasions this application to you and more particularly Sir  Your most humble Servant  JAMES HARLOWE jun  I send this by one of my servants who will attend your dispatch  LETTER LXXXVI Mr  BELFORD  To  JAMES HARLOWE jun  Esq  Saturday Sept    SIR  YOU will excuse  my  plaindealing in turn for I must observe that if I had not the just opinion I have o  the sacred nature of the office I have undertaken some passages in the letter you have favoured me with would convince me that I ought  not  to excuse myself from acting in it  I need name only one of them You are pleased to say That your uncles if the Trust be relinquished to them will  treat with me  thro' Colonel Morden  as to the points they will undertake to perform    Permit me Sir to say That it is the duty of an Executor to see  every point  performed that  can  be performed Nor will I leave the performance of mine to any other persons especially where a qualifying is so directly intimated and where all the branches of your family have shewn themselves with respect to the incomparable Lady to have b  t one mind  You are pleased to urge that she recommends to me the leaving to the honour of any of your family such of the articles as are of a  Domestic Nature  But admitting this to be so does it not imply that the  other  articles are  ll to obtain my careBut even these you will find by the Will she give not up and to Thee I refer you  I am sorry for the hints you give of a  opposition  where a  you say there might be none if I did not interfere I  not Sir why your animos  ty against a man who cannot be defended should be carried to such a height against one who never gave you offence And This only because he is acquainted with thee Man I will not say all I might say on  his occasion  As to the Legacy to myself I assure you Sir that neither my circumstances nor my temper will put me upon being a gainer by the Executorship I shall take pleasure to tread in the steps of the admirable Testatrix in all I may and rather will increase than diminish her Poor's Fund  With regard to the trouble that may attend the Execution of the Trust I shall not in honour to her memory value ten times more than This can give me I have indeed two other Executorships on my hands but they sit light upon me And survivors cannot better or more charitably bestow their time  I conceive that every article but that relating to the Poor's Fund may be performed in two month's time at furthest  Occasions of litigation or offence shall not proceed from me You need only apply to Col Morden who shall command me in every thing that the Will allows me to oblige your family in I do assure you that I am as unwilling to obtrude myself upon it as any of it can wish  I own that I have not yet proved the Will nor shall I do it till next week at soonest that you may have time for amicable objections if such you think fit to make thro' the Colonel's mediation But let me observe to you Sir  'That an Executor's power in such instances as I have exercised it is the same before the Probate as after it He can even without taking  that  out  commence  an action altho' he cannot  declare  upon it And these Acts of Administration make him liable to actions himself'  I am therefore very  proper  in the steps I have taken in part of the Execution of this sacred Trust and want not  allowance  on the occasion  Permit me to add That when you have perused the Will and coolly considered every thing it is my hope that you will yourself be of opinion that there can be no room for dispute or opposition And that if your family will join to expedite the Execution it will be the most natural and easy way of shutting up the whole affair and to have done with a man so causelesly as to his  own  particular the object of your dislike as is Sir  Your very humble Servant notwithstanding  JOHN BELFORD  The WILL To which the following Preamble written on a separate paper was stitched with black silk  To my EXECUTOR  'I Hope I may be excused for expatiating in divers parts of this solemn last Act upon subjects of importance For I have heard of so many instances of confusion and disagreement in families and so much doubt and difficulty for want of absolute clearness in the Testaments of departed persons that I have often concluded were there to be no other reasons but those which respect the peace of surviving friends that this Last Act as to its designation and operation ought not to be the Last in its composition or making but should be the result of cool deliberation and as is more  frequently  than  justly  said of a  sound mind  and  memory  which too seldom are to be met with but in  sound health  All pretences of insanity of mind are likewise prevented when a testator gives reasons for what he wills all cavils about words are obviated the obliged are assured and They enjoy the benefit for whom the benefit was intended Hence have I for some time past employed myself in penning down heads of such a disposition which as reasons offered I have altered and added to so that I never was absolutely destitute of a  Will  had I been taken off ever so suddenly These minutes and imperfect sketches enabled me as God has graciously given me time and sedateness to digest them into the form in which they appear'  I CLARISSA HARLOWE now by strange melancholy accidents lodging in the parish of St Paul CoventGarden being of sound and perfect mind and memory as I hope these presents drawn up by myself and written with my own hand will testify do this second day of September  A blank at the writing was left for this date and filled up on this day See p  in the year of our Lord  The date of the year is left blank for particular reasons  make and publish this my Last Will and Testament in manner and form following  In the first place I desire that my body may lie unburied three days after my decease or till the pleasure of my father be known conce  ning it But the occasion of my death not admitting  of doubt I will not on any account that it be opened and it is my desire that it shall not be touched but by those of my own Sex  I have always earnestly requested that my body might be deposited in the family vault with those of my ancestors If it might be granted I could now wish that it may be placed at the feet of my dear and honoured grandfather But as I have by one very unhappy step been thought to disgrace my whole lineage and therefore this last honour may be refused to my corpse in this case my desire is that it may be interred in the churchyard belonging to  he parish in which I sha  l die and that in the most private manner between the hours of eleven and twelve at night attended only by Mrs Lovick and Mr and Mrs Smith and their maidservant  But it is my desire that the same sees and dues may be paid which are usually paid for those who are laid in the best ground as it is called or even in the ChancelAnd I bequeath five pounds to be given at the direction of the churchwardens to twenty poor people the Sunday after my interrment and This whether I shall be buried here or elsewhere  I have already given verbal directions that after I am dead and laid out in the manner I have ordered I may be put into my coffin as soon as possible It is my desire that I may not be unnecessarily exposed to the view of any body except any of my relations should vouchsafe for the last time to look upon me  And I could wish if it might be avoided without making illwill between Mr Lovelace and my Executor that the former might not be permitted to see my corpse But if as he is a man very uncontroulable and as I am Nobody's he insist upon viewing  her d  ad  whom he ONCE before saw in a manner dead let his gay curiosity be gratified Let him behold and triumph over the wretched Remains of one who has been made a victim to his barbarous perfidy But let some good person as by my desire give him a paper whilst he is viewing the ghastly spectacle containing these few words only  "Gay cruel heart behold here the Remains of the once ruined yet now happy Clarissa HarloweSee what thou thyself must quickly beand REPENT"  Yet to show that I die in perfect charity with  all the world  I do most sincerely forgive Mr Lovelace the wrongs he has done me  If my father can pardon the error of his unworthy child so far as to suffer her corpse to be  eposited at the feet of her grandfather as above requested I could wish my misfortunes being so notorious that a short discourse might be pronounced  over my remains before they be interred The subject of the discourse I shall determine before I conclude this writing  So much written about what deserves not the least consideration and about what will be Nothing when this wri  ing comes to be opened and read will be excused when my present unhappy circumstances and absence from all my natural friends are considered  And NOW with regard to the worldly matters which I shall die possessed of as well as to those which of right appertain to me either by the Will of my said grandfather or otherwise Thus do I disp  e of them  In the first place I give and bequeath all the real estates in or to which I have any claim or title by the said Will to my overhonoured father James Harlowe  Esq  and that rather than to my brother and sister to whom I had once thoughts of devising them because if they survive my father those estates will assuredly vest in them or one of them by virtue of his favour and indulgence as the circumstances of things with regard to marriagesettlements or otherwise may require or as they may respectively me  i  by the continuance of their duty  The house late my grandfather's called  The Grove  and by him in honour of me and of some of my voluntary employments  my dairyhouse  and the furniture thereof as it now stands the pictures and large iron c  est of old plate excepted I also bequeath to my said father only begging it as a favour that he will be pleased to permit my dear Mrs Norton to pass the remainder of her days in that house and to have and enjoy the apartments in it known by the name of  The housekeeper's apartments  with the furn  ture in them and which plain and neat was bought for me by my grandfather who delighted to call me his housekeeper and which therefore in his lifetime I used as such The office to go with the apartments And I am the more earnest in this recommendation as I had once thought to have been very happy there with the good woman and because I think her prudent management will be as beneficial to my father as his favour can be convenient to her  But with regard to what has accrued from that estate since my grandfather's death and to the sum of nine hundred and seventy pounds which proved to be the moiety of the money that my said grandfather had by him at his death and which moiety he bequ  athed to me for my sole and separate use as he did the other moiety in like manner to my sister  See Vol I p  and which sum that I might convince my brother and sister that I wished not  for an independence upon my father's pleasure I gave into my father's hands together with the management and produce of the whole estate devised to meThese sums however considerable when put together I hope I may be allowed to dispose of absolutely as my Love and my Gratitude not confined wholly to my own family which is very wealthy in all its branches may warrant And which therefore I shall dispose of in the manner hereafter mentioned But it is my will and express direction that my father's account of the abovementioned produce may be taken and established absolutely and without contravention or question as he shall be pleased to give it to my cousin Morden or to whom else he shall choose to give it so as that the said account be not subject to litigation or to the controul of my Executor or any other person  My father of his love and bounty was pleased to allow me the same quarterly sums that he allowed my sister for apparel and other requisites and pleased with me then used to say that those sums should not he deducted from the estate and effects bequeathed  o me by my grandfather But having  mortally  offended him as I fear it may be said by one unhappy step it may be expected that he will reimburse himself those sumsIt is therefore my will and direction that he shall be allowed to pay and satisfy himself for all such quarterly or other sums which he was so good as to advance me from the time of my grandfather's death and that his account of such sums shall likewise be taken without questioning the money however which I left behind me in my escritoire being to be taken in part of those disbursements  My grandfather who in his goodness and favour to me knew no bounds was pleased to bequeath to me all the family pictures at his late house some of which are very masterly performances with command that if I died unmarried or if married and had no desc  ndents they should then go to that son of his if more than one should be then living whom I should think would set most value by them Now as I know that my honoured uncle John Harlowe  Esq  was pleased to express some concern that they were not left to him as eldest son and as he has a gallery where they may be placed to advantage and as I have reason to believe that he will bequeath them to my father if he survive him who no doubt will leave them to my brother I therefore bequeath all the said family pictures to my said uncle John Harlowe In these pictures however I include not one of my own drawn when I was about fourteen years of age which I shall hereafter in another article bequeath  My said honoured grandfather having a great fondness for the old family plate which he would never permit to be changed having lived as he used to say to see a great deal of it come into request again in the revolution of fashions and having left the same to me with a command to keep it intire and with power at my death to bequeath it to whomsoever I pleased that I thought would forward his desire which was as he expresses it that it should be kept  to the end of time  this family plate which is deposited in a large iron chest in the strong room at his late dwellinghouse I bequeath intire to my honoured uncle Antony Harlowe  Esq  with the same injunctions which were laid on me not doubting but he will confirm and strengthen them by his own last will  I bequeath to my evervalued friend Mrs Judith Norton to whose piety and care seconding the piety and care of my everhonoured and excellent mother I owe morally speaking the qualifications which for Eighteen years of my life made me beloved and respected the full sum of six hundred pounds to be paid her within three months after my death  I bequeath also to the same good woman thirty guineas for mourning for her and for her son my fosterbrother  To Mrs Dorothy Hervey the only sister of my honoured mother I bequeath the sum of fifty guineas for a ring and I beg of her to accept of my thankful acknowlegements for all her goodness to me from my infancy and particularly for her patience with me in the several alt  rcations that happened between my brother and sister and me before my unhappy departure from Harloweplace  To my kind and muchvalued cousin Miss Dolly Hervey daughter of my aunt Hervey I bequeath my watch and equipage and my best Mechlin and Brussels headdresses and ruffles also my gown and petticoat of flowered silver of my own work which having been made up but a few days before I was confined to my chamber I never wore  To the same young lady I bequeath likewise my harpsichord my chamberorgan▪ and all my musicbooks  As my Sister has a very pretty library and as my beloved Miss Howe has also her late father's as well as her own I bequeath all my books in general with the cases they are in to my said cousin Dolly Hervey As they are not illchosen for a woman's library I know that she will take the greater pleasure in them when her friendly grief is mellowed by time into a remembrance more sweet than painful because they were mine and because there are observations in many of them of my own wri  ing and some very judicious ones written by the truly reverend Dr Lewen  I also bequeath to the same young lady twentyfive guineas for a ring to be worn in remembrance of her true friend  If I live not to see my worthy cousin William Morden  Esq  I desire my humble and grateful thanks may be given to him for his favours and goodness to me and particularly for his endeavours to reconcile my other friends to me at a time when I was doubtful whether he would forgive me himself As he is in great circumstances I will only beg of him to accept of two or three trifles in remembrance of a kinswoman who always honoured  him  as much as he loved  her  Particularly of that piece of flowers which my uncle Robert his father was very earnest to obtain in order to carry it abroad with him  I desire him likewise to accept of the little miniature picture set in gold which his worthy father made me sit for to the famous Italian master whom he brought over with him and which he presented to me that I might bestow it as he was pleased to say upon the man whom one day I should be most inclined to favour  To the same gentleman I also bequeath my rose diamond ring which was a present from his good father to me and will be the more valuable to him on that account  I humbly request Mrs Annabella Howe the mother of my dear Miss Howe to accept of my respectful thanks for all her favours and goodness to me when I was so frequently a visiter to her beloved daughter and of a ring of twentyfive guineas price  My picture at whole length which is in my late grandfather's closet excepted in an article above from the family pictures drawn when I was near fourteen years of age about which time my dear Miss Howe and I began to know to distinguish and to love one anotherso dearlyI cannot express how dearlyI bequeath to that sister of my heart of whose friendship as well in adversity as prosperity when I was deprived of all other comfort and comforters I have had such instances as that our Love can only be exceeded in that State of Perfection in which I hope to rejoice with her hereafter to all Eternity  I bequeath also to the same dear friend my best diamond ring which is in the private drawer of my escritoire with other jewels As also all my finished and framed pieces of needlework the flowerpiece excepted which I have already bequeathed to my cousin Morden  These pieces have all been taken down as I have heard  Vol III p    and my relations will have no heart to put them up again but if my good mother chooses to keep back any one piece the above capital piece as it is called excep  ed not knowing but some time hence she may bear the sight of it I except that also from this general bequest and direct it to be presented to her  My wholelength picture in the Vandyke taste  Vol III p  that used to hang in my own parlour as I was permitted to call it I bequea  h to my aunt Hervey except my mother shall think fit to keep it herself  I bequeath to the worthy Charles Hickman  Esq  the locket with the minature picture which I have constantly worn and shall continue to wear near my heart till the approach of my last hour  See p of this Volume  of the lady  hom he best loves It must be the most acceptable present that can be made him next to the  hand  of the dear original And O my dear Miss Howe let it not be long before you permit his claim to the  latter  for indeed you know not the v  lue of a virtuous mind in that Sex and how preferable such a mind is to one distinguished by the more dazling flights of unruly wit altho' the latter were to be joined by that specious outward appea  ance which is tootoo often permitted to attract the hasty eye and susceptible heart  I make it my earnest request to my dear Miss Howe that sh  will not put herself into mourning for me But I desire her acceptance of a ring with my hair and that Mr Hickman will also accept of the like each of the value of fifteen guine  s  I bequeath to Lady Betty Lawrance and to her sister Lady Sarah Sadl  ir and to the right honourable Lord M and to their worthy nieces Miss Charlotte and Miss Martha Mon  ague each an enamelled r  ng with a cypher Cl H with my hair in crystal and round the inside of each the day month and year o  my death Each ring with brilliants to cost twenty guineas And this as a small token of the grateful sense I have of the honour of their good opinions and kind wishes in my favour and of their truly noble offer to me of a very considerable annual provision when they apprehended me to be intirely d  stitute of any  To the reverend and learned doctor Arthur Lewen by whose instructions I ha  e been equally delighted and benefited I bequeath twenty guineas for a Ring If it should please God to c  ll him to  imself before he can receive this small bequest it is my will that his worthy daughter may have the benefit of it  In token of the grateful sense I have of the civilities paid me by Mrs and Miss Howe's domestics from time to time in my visits there I bequeath thirty guineas to be divided among them as  heir dear young mistress shall think proper  To each of my worthy companions and friends Miss Biddy Lloyd Miss Fanny Alston Miss Rachel Biddulph and Miss Cartwright Campbell I bequeath five guineas for a ring  To my late maidservant Hannah Burton an honest faithful creature who loved  me  reverenced my  mother  and respected my  sister  and never sought to do any thing unbecoming of her character I bequeath the sum of fifty pounds to be paid within one month after my decease she labouring under ill health And if that ill health continue I commend her for farther assistance to my good Mrs Norton to be put upon my Poor's fund hereafter to be mentioned  To the Coachman Groom and Two Footmen and Five Maids at Harloweplace I bequeath ten pounds each To the Helper five pounds  To my Sister's maid Betty Barnes I bequeath ten pounds to shew that I resent not former disobligations which I believe were owing more to the insolence of office and to natural pertness than to personal illwill  All my wearing apparel of whatever sort that I have not been obliged to part with or which is not already bequeathed my linen excepted I desire Mrs Norton will accept of  The trunks and boxes in which my cloaths are sealed up I desire may not be opened but in presence of Mrs Norton or of some one deputed by her and of Mrs Lovick  To the worthy Mrs Lovick abovementioned from whom I have received great civilities and even maternal kindnesses and to Mrs Smith with whom I lodge from whom  also  I have received great kindnesses I bequeath all my linen and all my unsold laces to be divided equally between them as they shall agree or in case of disagreement the same to be sold and the money arising to be equally shared by them  And I bequeath to the same two good women as a further token of my thankful acknowlegements of their kind love and compassionate concern for me the sum of twe  ty guineas each  To Mr Smith the husband of Mrs Smith abovenamed I bequeath the sum of ten guineas in acknowlegement of his civilities to me  To Sarah the honest maidservant of Mrs Smith to whom having no servant of my own I have been troublesome I bequeath five guineas and ten guineas more in lieu of a suit of my wearingapparel which once with some linen I thought of leaving to her With this she may purchase what may be more suitable to her liking and degree  To the honest and careful wi  ow Ann Shelburne my nurse over and above her wages and the little customary perquisites  that may belong to her I bequeath the sum of ten guineas Hers is a careful and to persons of such humanity and tenderness a melancholy employment attended in the latter part of life with great watching and fatigue which is hardly ever enough considered  The few books I have at my present lodgings I desire Mrs Lovick to accept of and that she be permitted if she please to take a copy of my book of  meditations  as I used to call it being extracts from the best of books which she seemed to approve of although suited particularly to my own case As for the book itself perhaps my good Mrs Norton will be glad to have it as it is written all with my own hand  In the middle drawer of my escritoire at Harloweplace are many letters and copies of letters put up according to their dates which I have written or received in a course of years ever since I learned to write from and to my grandfather my father and mother my uncles my brother and sister on occasional little absences my late uncle Morden my cousin Morden Mrs Norton and Miss Howe and other of my companions and friends before my confinement at my Father's as also from the three reverend gentlemen Dr Blome Mr Arnold and Mr Tompkins now with God and the very reverend Dr Lewen on serious subjects As these letters exhibit a correspondence that no young person of my sex need to be ashamed of allowing for the time of life when mine were written and as many excellent things are contained in those written to me and as Miss Howe to whom most of them have been communicated wished formerly to have them if she survived me for these reasons I bequeath them to my said dear friend Miss Anna Howe and the rather as she had for some years past a very considerable share in the correspondence  I do hereby make constitute and ordain John Belford of Edgworth in the county of Middlesex  Esq  the sole Executor of this my Last Will and Testament having previously obtained his leave so to do I have given the reasons which induced me to ask this gentleman to take upon him this trouble to Miss Howe I therefore refer to her on this subject  But I do most earnestly beg of him the said Mr Belford that in the execution of this trust he will as he has repeatedly promised studiously endeavour to promote peace with and suppress resentments in every one so as that all farther mischiefs may be prevented as well  from  as  to  his friend And in order to this I beseech him to cultivate the friendship of my worthy cousin Morden who as I presume to hope when he  understands it to be my dying request will give him his advice and assistance in every article where it may be necessary and who will perhaps be so good as to interpose with my rela  ions if any difficulty should arise abou  carrying any of the articles of this my Last Will into execution and  o soften them in  o the wishedfor condescensionFor it is my earnest request to Mr B  lford that he will not seek by Law or by any sort of violence either by word or deed to extort the performance from  them  If the  e b  any articles of a merely domestic nature that my relations sha  ink unfit to be carried into execution such articles I leave  rely to my said cousin Morden and Mr Belford to vary or totally dispense with as they shall agree upon the matter or if they two diff  r in opinion they will be pleased to be determined by a third person to be chosen by them both  Having been pressed by Miss Howe and her mother to collect the particulars of my sad story and given expectation that I would in order to do my character justice with all my friends and companions but not having time before me for the painful task it has been a pleasure to me to find by extracts kindly communicated to me by my said Executor that I may safely trust my fame to the justice done me by Mr Lovelace in his letters to him my said Executor And as Mr Belford has engaged to contribute what is in his power towards a compilement to be made of all that relates to my story and knows my whole mind in this respect it is my desire that he will cause two copies to be made of this collection one to remain with Miss Howe the other with himself and that he will shew or lend his copy if required to my aunt Hervey for the satisfaction of any of my family but under such restrictions as the said Mr Belford shall think fit to impose that neither any other person's safety may be endangered nor his own honour suffer by the communication  I bequeath to my said Executor the sum of one hundred guineas as a grateful tho' insufficient acknowlegement of the trouble he will be at in the execution of the trust he has so kindly undertaken I desire him likewise to accept of twenty guineas for a ring And that he will reimburse himself for all the charges and expences which he shall be at in the execution of this trust  In the worthy Dr H I have found a physician a father and a friend I beg of him as a testimony of my gratitude to accept of twenty guineas for a ring  I have the same obligations to the kind and skilful Mr Coddard who attended me as my apothecary His very moderate  till I have discharged down to yesterday I have always thought it incumbent upon testators to shorten all they can the trouble of their executors I know I u  derrate the value of Mr Goddard's attendances when over and above what may accrue from yesterday to the hour that will finish all I desire fifteen guineas for a ring may be presented to him  To the reverend Mrwho frequently attended me and prayed by me in my last stages I also bequeath fifteen guineas for a ring  There are a set of honest indigent people whom I used to call  my poor  and to whom Mrs Norton conveys relief each month or at shorter periods in proportion to their necessities from a sum I deposited in her hands and from time to time recruited as means accrued to me but now nearly if not wholly expended Now that my fault may be as little aggravated as possible by the sufferings of the worthy people whom Heaven gave me a heart to relieve and as the produce of my Grandfather's estate including the moiety of the sums he had by him and was pleased to give me at his death as abovementioned together with what I shall further appropriate to the same use in the subsequent articles will as I hope more than answer all my legacies and bequests it is my will and desire that the remainder be it little or much shall become a fund to be appropriated and I hereby direct that it be appropriated to the like purposes with the sums which I put into Mrs Norton's hands as aforesaidAnd this under the direction and management of the said Mrs Norton who knows my whole mind in this particular And in case of her death or of her desire to be acquitted of the management thereof it is my earnest request to my dear Miss Howe that she will take it upon herself and at her own death that she will transfer what shall remain undisposed of at the  time  to such persons and with such limitations restrictions and provisoes as she shall think will best answer my intention For as to the management and distribution of all or any part of it while in Mrs Norton's hands or her own I will that it be intirely discretional and without account either to my Executor or any other person  Altho' Mrs Norton as I have hinted knows my whole mind in this respect yet it may be proper to mention in this last solemn Act that my intention is that this fund be intirely set apart and appropriated to relieve temporarily from the interest thereof as I dare say it will be put out to the best advantage or even from the principal if need be the honest industrious labouring poor only when sickness lameness unforeseen losses or other accidents disable them from following their lawful callings or to assist such honest people of large  families as shall have a child of good inclinations to put out to service trade or husbandry  It has always been a rule with me in my little donations to endeavour to aid and set forward the sober and industrious poor Small helps if seasonably afforded will do for such and so the fund may be of more extensive benefit an ocean of wealth will not be sufficient for the idle and dissolute whom therefore since they will be always in want it will be no charity to relieve if worthier creatures shall by that means be deprived of such assistance as may set the wheels of their industry going and put them in a sphere of useful action  But it is my express will and direction that let this fund come out to be ever so considerable it shall be applied only in support of the  temporary exigencies  of the persons I have described and that no one family or person receive from it at one time or in one year more than the sum of twenty pounds  It is my will and desire that the set of jewels which was my grandmother's and presented to me soon after her death by my grandfather be valued and the worth of them paid to my Executor if any of my family choose to have them or otherwise that they be sold and go to the augmentation of my poor's fundBut if they may be deemed an equivalent for the sums my father was pleased to advance to me since the death of my grandfather I desire that they may be given up to him  I presume that the diamond necklace solitaire and buckles which were properly my own presented by my mother's uncle Sir Josias Brookland will not be purchased by any one of my family for a too obvious reason in this case I desire that they may be sent to my Executor and that he will dispose of them to the best advantage and apply the money to the uses of my will  In the beginning of this tedious writing I referred to the latter part of it the naming of the subject of the discourse which I wished might be delivered at my funeral if permitted to be interred with my ancestors I think the following will be suitable to my case I hope the alteration of the words  her  and  sh  for  him  and  her  may be allowable  "Let not  her  that is deceived trust in vanity for vanity shall be  her  recompence  She  shall be accomplished before  her  time and  her  branch shall not be green  She  shall shake off  her  unripe grape as the vine and shall cast off  her  flower as the blighted olive  Job xv  "  But if I am to be interred in town let only the usual Burialservice be read over my corpse  If my body be permitted to be carried down I bequeath ten pounds to be given to the poor of the parish at the discretion of the churchwardens within a fortnight after my interrment  If any necessary matter be omitted in this my Will or if any thing appear doubtful or contradictory as possibly may be the case since besides my inexperience in these matters I am now at this time very weak and ill having put off the finishing hand a little too long in hopes of obtaining the last forgiveness of my honoured friends in which case I should have acknowleged the favour with a suitable warmth of duty and filled up some blanks which I left to the very last  p of this Volume  in a more agreeable manner to myself than now I have been enabled to doin case of such omissions and imperfections I desire that my cousin Morden will be so good as to join with Mr Belford in considering them and in comparing them with what I have more explicitly written and if after  that  any doubt remain that they will be pleased to apply to Miss Howe who knows my whole heart And I desire that their construction may be established And I hereby establish it provided it be unanimous and direct it to be put in force as if I had so written and determined myself  And Now O my blessed REDEEMER do I with a lively faith humbly lay hold of Thy meritorious Death and Sufferings hoping to be washed clean in Thy precious Blood from all my sins In the bare hope of the happy consequences of which how light do those sufferings seem grievous as they were at the time which I confidently trust will be a means by Thy Grace to work out for me a more exc  eding and eternal weight of glory  Clarissa Harlowe  Signed sealed published and declared the day and year abovewritten by the said Clarissa Harlowe as her Last Will and Testament contained in seven sheets of paper all written with her own hand and every sheet signed and sealed by herself in the presence of Us  John Williams  Arthur Bedall  Elizabeth Swanton  LETTER LXXXVII Colonel  MORDEN  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Sat Sept    I Have been employed in a most melancholy task In reading the Will of the dear deceased  The unhappy Mother and Mrs Norton chose to be absent on the affecting occasion But Mrs Harlowe made it her earnest request that every article of it should be fulfilled  They were all extremely touched with the preamble  The first words of the Will  'I Clarissa Harlowe now by strange melancholy accidents lodging'  c  drew tears from some sighs from all  The directions for her funeral in case she were or were not permitted to be carried down the mention of her orders having been given for the manner of her being laid out and the presence of mind so visible throughout the whole obtained their admiration expressed by hands and eyes lifted up and by falling tears  When I read the direction  'That her body was not to be viewed except any of her relations should vouchsafe for the last time to look upon her'  they turned away and turned to me three or four times alternately Mrs Hervey and Miss Arabella sobbed the Uncles wiped their eyes the Brother looked down the Father wrung his hands  I was obliged to stop at the words  'That she was  Nobody's  '  But when I came to the address to be made to the accursed man  'if he were not to be diverted from seeing  her  dead whom once before he had seen in a manner dead'  execration and either vows or wishes of revenge filled every mouth  These were still more fervently renewed when they came to hear read her forgiveness of even this man  You remember Sir on our first reading of the Will i  town the observations I made on the foul play which it is evident the excellent creature met with from this abandoned man and what I said upon the occasion I am not used to repeat things of that nature  The dear creature's noble contempt of the  Nothing  as she as nobly calls it about which she had been giving such particular directions to wit her Body and her apologizing for the particularity of those directions from the circumstances she was inhad the same and as strong an effect upon me as when I first read the animated paragraph and pointed by my eye by turns cast upon them all affected them all  When the article was read which bequeathed to the father the grandfather's estate and the reason assigned for it so generous and so dutiful the father could sit no longer but withdrew wiping his eyes and lifting up his hands at Mr James Harlowe who arose to attend him to the door as Arabella likewise didAll he could sayO Son SonO Girl Girlas if he reproached them for the parts they had acted and put him upon acting  But yet on some occasions this Brother and Sister shewed themselves to be true Willdisputants  Let tongue and eyes express what they will Mr Belford the reading of a Will where a person dies worth anything considerable generally affords a true test of love to the deceased  The cloaths the thirty guineas for mourning to Mrs Norton with the recommendation of the good woman for housekeeper at  The Grove  were thought sufficient had the article of  l  which was called monstrous been omitted Some other passages in the Will were called  flights and such whimsies as distinguish people of imagination from those of judgment    My cousin Dolly Hervey was grudged the Library Miss Harlowe said That as she and her sister never bought the same books she would take that to herself and would  make it up  to her cousin Dolly  one way or other    I intend Mr Belford to save you the trouble of interposingThe Library shall be my cousin Dolly's  Mrs Hervey could hardly keep her seat On  this  occasion however she only said That her late dear and  ever  dear niece was  too good  to her and  hers  But  at another  m  she declared with tears that she could not forgive  erself for a letter she wrote  See Vol  III  p    looking at Miss Arabella  whom it seems unknown to anybody she had consulted before she wrote it and which she said must have wounded a spirit that now she saw had been too deeply wounded before  O my aunt said Arabella no more of thatWho would have thought that the dear creature had been such a penitent  Mr John and Mr Antony Harlowe were so much affected with the articles in their favour bequeathed to them without a word or hint of reproach or recrimination that they broke out into self accusations and lamented that their sweet niece as they called her was now got above all grateful acknowlegement and returns  Indeed the mutual upbraidings and grief of all present upon those articles in which every one was remembered for good so often interrupted me that the reading took up above six hours But curses upon the accursed man were a refuge to which they often resorted to exonerate themselves  How wounding a thing Mr Belford is a generous and welldistinguished forgiveness What Revenge can be more effectual and more noble were Revenge intended and were it wished to strike remorse into a guilty or ingrateful heart But my dear cousin's motives were all Duty and Love She seems indeed to have been as much as mortal could be LOVE itself Love sublimed by a purity by a true delicacy that hardly any woman before her could boast of O Mr Belford what an Example would she have given in every station of life as Wife Mother Mistress Friend had her lot fallen upon a man blessed with a mind like her own  The  l  bequeathed to Mrs Norton the Library to Miss Hervey and the Remembrances to Miss Howe were not the only articles grudged Yet to what purpose did they regret the pecuniary bequests when the Poors fund and not themselves would have had the benefit had not those legacies been bequeathed  But enough passed to convince me that my cousin was absolutely right in her choice of an Executor out of the family Had she chosen one in it I dare say that her Will would have been no more regarded than if it had been  the Will of a dead King than that of Louis XIV in particular so flagrantly broken thro' by his nephew the Duke of Orleans before he was cold The only will of that Monarch perhaps which was ever disputed  But little does Mr James Harlowe think that while he is grasping at hundreds he will most probably lose thousands if he be my survivor A man of a spirit so selfish and narrow shall not be my heir  You will better conceive Mr Belford than I can express how much they were touched at the hint that the dear creature had been obliged to part with some of her cloaths  Silent reproach seized every one of them when I came to the passage where she mentions that she deferred filling up some blanks in hopes of receiving their last blessing and forgiveness  I will only add that they could not bear to hear read the concluding part so solemnly addressed to her Redeemer They all arose from their seats and crouded out of the apartment we were in And then as I afterwards found separated in order to seek that consolation in solitary retirement which tho' they could not hope for from their own reflections yet at the time they had less reason to expect in each other's company I am SIR  Your faithful and obedient Servant  WM MORDEN  LETTER LXXXV Mr  BELFORD  To the Right Honourable Lord  M  London  Sept    My Lord  I AM very apprehensive that the affair between Mr Lovelace and the late excellent Miss Clarissa Harlowe will be attended with further bad consequences notwithstanding her dying injunctions to the contrary I would therefore humbly propose that your Lordship and his other relations will forward the purpose your kinsman lately had to go abroad where I hope he will stay till all is blown over But as he will not stir if he know the true motives of your wishes the avowed inducement as I hinted once to Mr Mowbray may be such as respects  his own health both of person and mind To Mr Mowbray and Mr Tourville all countries are alike and they perhaps will accompany him  I am glad to hear that he is in a way of recovery But this the rather induces me to press the matter And I think no time should be lost  Your Lordship has heard that I have the honour to be the Executor of this admirable lady's last Will I transcribe from it the following paragraph  He then transcribes the article which so gratefully mentions this Nobleman and the Ladies of his family in relation to the rings she bequeaths them about which he desires their commands  LETTER LXXXVI Miss  MONTAGUE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  M Hall  Friday Sept    SIR  MY Lord having the gout in his righthand his Lordship and Lady Sarah and Lady Betty have commanded me to inform you that before your letter came Mr Lovelace was preparing for a foreign tour We shall endeavour to hasten him away on the motives you suggest  We are all extremely affected with the dear lady's death Lady Betty and Lady Sarah have been indisposed ever since they heard of it They had pleased themselves as had my sister and self with the hopes of cultivating her acquaintance and friendship after he was gone abroad upon her own terms Her kind remembrance of each of us has renewed tho' it could not heighten our regrets for so irreparable a loss We shall order Mr Finch our goldsmith to wait on you He has our directions about the rings They will be long long worn in memory of the dear testatrix  Everybody is assured that you will do all in your power to prevent  farther  ill consequences from this melancholy affair My Lord desires his compliments to you I am SIR  Your humble Servant  CH MONTAGUE  This collection having run into a much greater length than was wished it is thought proper to omit several Letters that passed between Colonel Morden Miss Howe Mr Belford and Mr Hickman in relation to the execution of the Lady's Will  c  It is however necessary to observe on this subject That the unhappy mother being supported by the two uncles influenced the afflicted father to overrule all his son's objections and to direct a literal observation of the Will and at the same time to give up all the sums which he was impowered by it to reimburse himself as also to take upon himself to defray the funeral expences  Mr Belford so much obliged Miss Howe by his steadiness equity and dispatch and by his readine  s to contribute to the directed collection that she voluntarily entered into a correspondence with him as the representative of her beloved friend In the course of which he communicated to her in confidence the Letters which passed between him and Mr Lovelace and by Colonel Morden's consent those which passed between that gentleman and himself  He sent with the first parcel of letters which he had transcribed out of shorthand for Miss Howe a letter to Mr Hickman dated the th of September in which he expresses himself as follows  'But I ought Sir in this parcel to have kept out one letter It is that which relates to the interview between yourself and Mr Lovelace at Mr Dormer's  See Vol  VI  Letter    In which Mr Lovelace treats you with an air of levity which neither your person your character nor your commission deserved but which was his usual way of treating every one whose business he was not pleased with I hope Sir you have too much greatness of mind to be disturbed at this letter should Miss Howe communicate it to you and the rather as it is impossible that you should suffer with her on that account'  He then excuses Mr Lovelace as a goodnatured man with all his faults and gives instances of his still greater freedoms with himself  To this Mr Hickman answers in his letter of the th  'As to Mr Lovelace's treatment of me in the letter you are pleased to mention I shall not be concerned at it  whatever it be I went to him prepared to expect odd behaviour from him and was not disappointed I argue to myself in all such cases as this as Miss Howe from her everdear friend argues  That if the reflections thrown upon me  are just  I ought not only to forgive them but to endeavour to profit by them  If unjust  that I ought to despise them and the reflecter too since it would be inexcusable to strengthen by anger an enemy whose malice might be disarmed by contempt  And moreover I should be almost sorry to find myself spoken well of by a man who could treat as he treated a lady who was an ornament to her sex and to human nature  'I thank you however Sir adds he for your consideration for me in this particular and for your whole letter which gives me so desirable an instance of that friendship which you honoured me with the assurances of when I was last in town and which I as cordially embrace as wish to cultivate'  Miss Howe in hers of the th acknowleging the receipt of the letters and papers and legacies sent with Mr Belford's letter to Mr Hickman assures him  'That no use shall be made of his communications but what he shall approve of'  He had mentioned with compassion the distresses of the Harlowe family  'Persons of a  pitiful nature  says she  may  pity them I am not one of those You I think pity the infernal man likewise while I from my heart grudge him his phrensy because it deprives him of that remorse which I hope on his recovery will never leave him At times Sir let me tell you that I hate your whole Sex for his sake even men of unblameable characters whom at those times I cannot but look upon as persons I have not yet  found out    'If my dear creature's personal jewels proceeds she be sent up to you for sale I desire that I may be the purchaser of them at the  highest  priceOf the necklace and solitaire particularly  'O what tears did the perusal of my beloved's Will cost meBut I must not touch upon the heartpiercing subject I can neither take it up nor quit it but with execration of the villain whom all the world must execrate'  Mr Belford in his answer promises that she shall be the purchaser of the jewels if they come into his hands  He acquaints her that the family had given Col Morden the keys of all that belonged to the dear departed That the unhappy mother had as the Will allows ordered a piece of needlework to be set aside for her and had desired Mrs Norton to get the little book of  Meditations  transcribed and to let her have the original as it was all of her dear daughter's handwriting and as it might when she could bear to look into it administer consolation to herself And that she had likewise reserved for herself her picture in the Vandyke taste  Mr Belford sends with this letter to Miss Howe the lady's memorandumbook and promises to send her copies of the several posthumous letters He tells her that Mr Lovelace being upon the recovery he had inclosed the posthumous letter directed for him to Lord M that his Lordship might give it to him or not as he should find he could bear it The following is a copy of that Letter  To Mr  LOVELACE    Thursday Aug    I Told you in the letter I wrote to you on  Tuesday  last  See p of this Volume  The Reader may observe by the date of this letter that it was written within two days of the allegorical one to which it refers and while the lady was labouring under the increased illness occasioned by the burries and terrors which Mr Lovelace had put her into to avoid the visit he was so earnest to make her at Smith'sSo early written perhaps that she might not be surprised by death into a seeming breach of her word  High as her Christian spirit soars in this letter the reader has seen in Letter  xlviii  and in other places that that exalted spirit carried her to still more divine elevations as she drew nearer to her end  that you should have another sent you when I had got to  my Father's house    I presume to say that I am  now  at your receiving of This arrived there and I invite you to follow me as soon as you can be  prepared  for so great a journey  Not to allegorize furtherMy fate is  now  at your perusal of this accomplished My doom is unalterably fixed And I am either a miserable or a happy being to all Eternity If  happy  I owe it solely to the Divine mercy  If  miserable  to your undeserved crueltyAnd consider now for your own sake gay cruel fluttering unhappy man consider whether the barbarous and perfidious treatment I have m  t with from you was worthy of the hazard of your immortal soul since your wicked views were not to be effected but by the wilful breach of the most solemn vows that ever were made by man and those aided by a violence and baseness unworthy of a human creature  In time then once more I wish you to consider your ways Your golden dream cannot long last Your present course can yield you pleasure no longer than you can keep off thought or reflection A hardened insensibility is the only foundation on which your inward tranquillity is built When once a dangerous sickness seizes you when once effectual remorse breaks in upon you how dreadful will be your condition How poor a triumph will you then find it to have been able by a series of black perjuries and studied baseness under the name of Gallantry or Intrigue to betray poor unexperienced young creatures who perhaps knew nothing but their duty till they knew youNot one good action in the hour of languishing to recollect not one worthy intention to revolve it will be all conscience and horror and you will wish to have it in your power to compound for annihilation  Reflect Sir that I can have no other motive in what I write than your good and the safety of other innocent creatures who may be drawn in by your wicked arts and perjuries You have not in my wishes for your future welfare the wishes of a suppliant wife endeavouring for her  own  sake as well as for  yours  to induce you to reform those ways They are wholly disinterested as undeserved But I should mistrust my own penitence were I capable of wishing to recompense evil for evilif black as your offences have been against me I could not forgive as I wish to be forgiven  I repeat therefore that I  do  forgive you And may the Almighty forgive you too Nor have I at the writing of this any other essential regrets than what are occasioned by the grief I have given to parents who till I knew you were the most indulgent of parents by the scandal given to the other  branches of my family by the disreputation brought upon my Sex and by the offence given to Virtue in my fall  As to myself you have only robbed me of what once were my favourite expectations in the transient life I shall have quitted when you receive This You have only been the cause that I have been cut off in the bloom of youth and of curtailing a life that might have been agreeable to myself or otherwise as had suited the designs and ends of Providence I have reason to be thankful for being taken away from the evil of supporting my part of a yoke with a man so  unhappy  I will only say that in all pr  bability every hour I had lived with him might have brought with it some new trouble And I am indeed through sharp afflictions and distresses indebted to you  secondarily  as I humbly presume to hope for so many years of glory as might have proved years of danger temptation and anguish had they been added to my mortal life  So Sir tho' no thanks to your  intention  you have done me  real service  and in return I wish you happy But such has been your life hitherto that you can have no time to lose in setting about your repentance Repentance to such as have lived only carelesly and in the omission of their regular duties and who never aimed to draw any poor creatures into evil is not so easy a task nor so much in our own power as some imagine How difficult a grace then to be obtained where the guilt is premeditated wilful and complicated  To say I once respected you with a preference is what I ought to blush to own since at the very time I was far from thinking you even a m  ral man tho' I little thought that you or indeed that any man breathing could be what you have proved yourself to be But indeed Sir I have long been greatly above you For from my heart I have despised you and all your ways ever since I saw what manner of man you were  Nor is it to be wondered that I should be able so to do when that preference was not grounded on ignoble motives For I was weak enough and presumptuous enough to hope to be a means in the hand of Providence to reclaim a man whom I thought worthy of the attempt  Nor have I yet as you will see by the pains I take o  this solemn occasion to awaken you out of your sensual dream given over all hopes of this nature  Hear me therefore O Lovelace as one speaking from the deadLose no timeSet about your repentance instantlyBe no longer the instrument of Satan to draw poor souls into those subtile snares which at last shall intangle your own feet Seek not to multiply your offences till they become beyond the  power  as I may say of the Divine Mercy to forgive since  justice  no less than  mercy  is an attribute of the Almighty  Tremble and reform when you read what is  the portion of the wicked man from God  Thus it is written  'The triumphing of the wicked is short and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment He is cast into a net by his own feetHe walketh upon a snare Terrors shall make him afraid on every side and shall drive him to his feet His strength shall be hungerbitten and destruction shall be ready at his side The firstborn of death shall devour his strength His remembrance shall perish from the earth and he shall have no name in the streets He shall be chased out of the world He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people They that have seen him shall say Where is he He shall s  y away as a dream He shall be chased away as a vision of the night His meat is the gall of asps within him He shall flee from the iron weapon and the bow of steel shall strike him thro' A fire not blown shall consume him The heaven shall reveal his iniquity and the earth shall rise up against him The worm shall feed sweetly on him He shall be no more rememberedThis is the fate of him that knoweth not God'  Whenever you shall be inclined to consult the Sacred Oracles from whence the above threatenings are extracted you will find doctrines and texts which a truly penitent and contrite heart may lay hold of for its consolation  May yours Mr Lovelace become such And may you be enabled to escape the fate denounced against the abandoned man and be intitled to the mercies of a longsuffering and gracious God is the sincere prayer of  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER LXXXVII Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  M Hall  Thursday Sept    EVER since the fatal seventh of this month I have been lost to myself and to all the joys of life I might have gone farther back than that fatal seventh which for the future I will never see anniversarily revolve but in fables only till that cursed day I had some gleams of hope now and then darting in upon me  They tell me of an odd letter I wrote to you  See his delirious letter p    I remember I did write But very little of the contents of what I wrote do I remember  I have been in a cursed way Methinks something has been working strangely retributive I never was such a fool as to disbelieve a Providence Yet am I not for resolving into judgments everything that temporarily chances to wear an avenging face Yet if we must be punished either here or hereafter for our misdeeds better  here  say I than  hereafter  Have I not then an interest to think my punishment already not only begun but completed since what I have suffered and do suffer passes all description  To give but one instance of the  retributive  Here I who was the barbarous

taken place but for my good and with a view to the safety of innocents she knew notAnd  when  was this letter written Was it not at the time at the very time that I had been pursuing her as I may say

last'Divine prophetess my golden dream is  already  over  'Thought and reflection  are  no longer to be kept off'  No  longer continues  that 'hardened insensibility' thou chargest upon me'Remorse  has  broken in upon me''Dreadful  is  my condition''It  is  all conscience and horror with meA thousand vulturs in turn are pr  ying upon my heart  But no more of these fruitless reflectionsSince I am incapable of writing anything else since my pen will  slide into this gloomy subject whether I will or not I will once more quit it nor will I again resume it till I can be more  its master  and my own  All I took pen to write for is however unwritten It was in few words to wish you to proceed with your communications as usual And why should you notSince in her evertobelamented death I know everything shocking and grievousAcquaint me then with all thou knowest which I do  not  know How her relations her cruel relations take it and whether now the barbed dart of afterreflection sticks not in their hearts as in mine up to the very feathers  I WILL soon quit this kingdom For now my Clarissa is no more what is there in it in the world indeed worth living forBut should I not first by some masterly mischief avenge her and myself upon her cursed family  The accused woman they tell me has broken her leg Why was it not her neckAll all but what is owing to her relations is the fault of that woman and of her hellborn nymphs  The greater the virtue the nobler the triumph  was a sentence for ever in their mouthsI have had it several times in my head to set fire to the execrable house and to watch at the doors and windows that not a devil in it escape the consuming flames Had the house stood by itself I had certainly done it  But it seems the old wretch is in the way to be rewarded without my help A shocking letter is received of somebody's in relation to herYours I supposeToo shocking for me they say to see at present  See p        They govern me as a child in strings Yet did I suffer so much in my fever that I am willing to bear with them till I can get tolerably well  At present I can neither eat drink nor sleep Yet are my disorders nothing to what they were For Jack my brain was on fire day and night And had it not been of the  asbestos  kind it had all been consumed  I had no distinct ideas but of dark and confused misery  It was all conscience and horror  indeed Thoughts of hanging drowning shooting then rage violence mischief and despair took their turns with me My lucid intervals  still worse giving me to reflect upon what I  was  the hour before and what I was likely to be the next and perhaps for lifeThe sport of enemies the laughter of fools and the hangingsleev'd gocarted property of hired slaves who were perhaps to find their account in manacling and abhorr'd thought in personally abusing me by blows and stripes  Who can bear such reflections as these To be made to  fear  only to such a one as me and to fear such wretches tooWhat a thing was this but  remotely  to apprehend And yet for a man to be in such a state as to render it necessary for his dearest friends to suffer this to be done for his own sake and in order to prevent further mischiefThere is no thinking of these things  I will  not  think of them therefore But will either get a train of chearful ideas or hang myself by tomorrow morning  To be a dog and dead  Were paradise to such a life as mine  LETTER LXXXVIII Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Wedn Sept    I Write to demand back again my last letter I own it was my mind at the different times I wrote it and whatever ailed me I could not  help  writing it Such a gloomy impulse came upon me and increased as I wrote that for my soul I could not forbear running into the Miserable  'Tis strange very strange that a man's conscience should be able to force his fingers to write whether he will or not and to run him into a subject he more than once at the very time resolved not to think of  Nor is it less strange that no new reason occurring he should in a day or two more so totally change his mind have his mind I should rather say so wholly illuminated by gay hopes and rising prospects as to be ashamed of what he had written  For on reperusal of a copy of my letter which fell into my hands by accident in the handwriting of my cousin  Charlotte who unknown to me had transcribed it I find it to be such a letter as an enemy would rejoice to see  This I know that were I to have continued but one week more in the way I was in when I wrote the latter part of it I should have been confined and in straw the next For I now recollect that all my distemper was returning upon me with irresistible violenceand that in spite of watergruel and soupe maigre  I own that I am still excessively grieved at the disappointment this admirable woman made it so much her whimsical choice to give me But since it has thus fallen out since she was determined to leave the world and since she actually ceases  to be  ought I who have such a share of life and health in hand to indulge gloomy reflections upon an event that is passed and  being  passed cannot be recalledHave I not had a specimen of what will be my case if I do  For Belford 'tis a folly to deny it I have been to use an old word quite  bestraught    Why why did my mother bring me up to bear no controul Why was I so educated as that to my very tutors it was a request that I should not know what contradiction or disappointment wasOught she not to have known what cruelty there was in her kindness  What a punishment to have my first very great disappointment touch my intellectAnd intellects once touchedBut that I cannot bear to think ofOnly thus far The very repentance and amendment wished me so heartily by my kind and cross dear have been invalidated and postponed who knows for how long the  amendment  at leastCan a madman be capable of either  Once touch'd therefore I must endeavour to banish those gloomy reflections which might  otherwise  have brought on the right turn of mind and this to express myself in Lord M's style that my wits may not be sent a  woollgathering    For let me moreover own to thee that Dr Hale who was my good  Astolfo  You read Ariosto Jack and has brought me back my  witjar  had much ado by starving diet by profuse phlebotomy by flaying blisters eyletholecupping a dark room a midnight solitude in a midday  sun to effect my recovery And now for my comfort he tells me that I may still have returns upon full moonsHorrible most horribleand must be as careful of myself at both Equinoctials as Caesar was warned to be of the ides of March  How my heart sickens at looking back upon what I was Denied the Sun and all comfort  All  my visiters lowborn tiptoe attendants Even those tiptoe slaves never approaching me but periodically armed with gallipots bolus's and cephalic draughts delivering their orders to me in hated whispers and answering other curtainholding impertinents inquiring how I was and how I took their execrable potions whisperingly too What a cursed stilllife thisNothing active in me or about me but the worm that never dies  Again I hasten from the recollection of scenes which  will  at times obtrude themselves upon me  Adieu Belford  But return me my last letterand build nothing upon its contents I  must  I  will  I have  already  overcome these fruitless gloominesses Every hour my constitution rises stronger and stronger to befriend me and except a tributary sigh now and then to the memory of my heart's beloved it gives me hope that I shall quickly be what I wasLife spirit gaiety and once more the plague of a Sex that has been my plague and will be every man's plague at one time or other of his life  I repeat my desire however that you will write to me as usual I hope you have good store of particulars by you to communicate when I can better bear to hear of the dispositions that were made for all that was mortal of my beloved Clarissa  But it will be the joy of my heart to be told that her implacable friends are plagued with remorse Such things as those you may  now  send me For company in misery is some relief especially when a man can think those he hates as miserable as himself  Once more adieu Jack  LETTER LXXXIX Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  I Am preparing to leave this kingdom Mowbray and Tourville promise to give me their company in a month or two  I'll give thee my route  I shall first to Paris and for amusement and diversion sake try to renew some of my old friendships Thence to some of the German courts Thence perhaps to Vienna Thence descend thro' Bavaria and the Tyrol to Venice where I shall keep the carnival Thence to Florence and Turin Thence again over mount Cenis to France And when I return again to Paris shall expect to see my friend Belford who by that time I doubt not will be all crusted and bearded over with penitence selfdenial and mortification a very anchorite only an itinerant one journeying over in hope to cover a multitude of his own sins by proselyting his old companion  But let me tell thee Jack if stock rises on as it has done since I wrote my last letter I am afraid thou wilt find a difficult task in succeeding should such be thy purpose  Nor I verily think can thy own penitence and reformation hold Strong habits are not so easily rooted out Old Satan has had too much benefit from thy faithful services for a series of years to let thee so easily get out of his clutches He knows what will do with thee A fine strapping Bona Roba in the Chartrestaste but welllimb'd clearcomplexion'd and Turkishey'd thou the first man with her or made to believe so which is the same thing how will thy frosty face shine upon such an object How will thy tristful visage be illumined by it A composition will be made between thee and the grand tempter Thou wilt promise to do him suit and service till old age and inability come And then will he in all probability be sure of thee for ever For wert thou to outlive thy present reigning appetites he will trump up some other darling sin or make a now secondary one darling in order to keep thee firmly attached to his infernal interests Thou wilt continue resolving to amend  but never amending till grown old before thou art aware  a dozen years after thou art old with everybody else  thy fortimebuilt tenement having lasted its allotted period he claps down upon thy grizzled head the universal trapdoor And then all will be over with thee in his own way  Thou wilt think these hints uncharacteristic from me But yet I cannot help warning thee of the danger thou art actually in which is the greater as thou seemest not to know it A few words more therefore on this subject  Thou hast made good resolutions If thou keepest them not thou wilt never be able to keep any But nevertheless the devil and thy time of life are against thee And six to one thou failest Were it only that thou hast  resolved  six to one thou failest And if thou dost thou wilt become the scoff of men and the triumph of devilsThen how will I laugh at thee For this warning is not from principle Perhaps I wish it were But I never lyed to man and hardly ever said truth to woman The first is what all free livers cannot say The second what every one can  I am mad again by JupiterBut thank my stars not gloomily soFarewel farewel farewel for the third or fourth time concludes  Thy  LOVELACE  I believe Charlotte and you are in private league together Letters I find have passed between her and you and Lord M I have been kept strangely in the dark of late But will soon break upon you all as the Sun upon a midnight thief Remember that you never sent me the copy of my Beloved's Will  LETTER XC Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  Friday Sept    JUST as I was sitting down to answer yours of the th to the th in order to give you all the consolation in my power came your revoking letter of Wednesday  I am really concerned and disappointed that your first was so soon followed by one so contrary to it  The shocking letter you mention which your friends withhold from you is indeed from me They may now I see shew you anything Ask them then for that letter if you think it worth while to read aught about the true mother of your mind  I WILL suppose that thou hast just read the letter thou callest shocking and which I intended to be so And let me ask What thou thinkest of it Dost thou not tremble at the horrors the vilest of women labours with on the apprehensions of death and future judgmentHow sit the reflections that must have been raised by the perusal of this letter upon thy yet unclosed eyletholes Will not some serious thoughts mingle with thy melilot and tear off the callus of thy mind as that may flay the leather from thy back and as thy epispastics may strip the parchment from thy plotting head If not then indeed is thy conscience feared and no hopes will lie for thee  Mr Belford then gives an account of the wretched Sinclair's terrible exit which he had just then received  If this move thee not I have news to acquaint thee with of another dismal catastrophe that is but within this hour come to my ear of another of thy blessed agents Thy TOMLINSONDying and in all probability before this can reach thee dead in Maidstone gaol As thou sayst in thy first letter  'something strangely retributive seems to be working'  This his case He was at the head of a gang of smugglers endeavouring to carry off run goods landed last Tuesday when a party of dragoons came up with them in the evening Some of his comrades fled M  c  Donald being surrounded attempted to fight his way thro' and wounded his man but having received a shot in his neck and being cut deeply in the head by a broadsword he fell from his horse was taken and carried to Maidstonegaol And there my informant left him just dying and assured of hanging if he recover  Absolutely destitute he got a kinsman of his to apply to  me and if in town to the rest of the confraternity for something not to  support  him was the word for he expected not to live till the fellow returned but to bury him  I never employed him but once and then he ruined my project I now thank Heaven that he did But I sent him three guineas and promised him more as from you and Mowbray and Tourville if he live a few days or to take his tryal And I put it upon you to make further inquiry of him and to give him what you think fit  His messenger tells me That he is very penitent That he weeps continually He cries out that he has been the vilest of men Yet palliates that his necessities made him worse than he should otherwise have been An excuse which none of  us  can plead But that what touched him most of all was a vile imposture he was put upon to serve a certain gentleman of fortune to the ruin of the most excellent woman that ever lived and who he had heard was dead of grief  Let me consider LovelaceWhose turn can be nextI wish it may not be thine But since thou givest me one piece of advice which I should indeed have thought out of character hadst thou not taken pains to convince me that it proceeds not from  principle  I will give thee another And that is  'Prosecute as fast as thou canst thy intended tour'  Change of scene and of climate may establish thy health While this gross air and the approach of winter may thicken thy blood and with the help of a conscience that is upon the struggle with thee and like a cunning wrestler watches its opportunity to give thee another fall may make thee miserable for thy life  I return your revoked letter Don't destroy it however The same dialect may one day come in fashion with you again  As to the family at HarlowePlace I have most affecting letters from Colonel Morden relating to their grief and distress You to whom the occasion is owing do well to rejoice in their compunction But as one well observes  Averse as they were to you they must and they would have been reconciled in time had you done her justice    I should be sorry if I could not say that what you have warned me of in  sport  makes me tremble in  earnest    I hope for this is a serious subject with me tho' nothing can be so with you that I never shall deserve by my apostasy to be the scoff of men and the triumph of devils  All that you say of the difficulty of conquering rooted habits is but too true Those and time of life are indeed too much against me But when I reflect upon the ends some untimely of those of our companions whom we have formerly lost upon Belton's miserable exit upon the howls and screams of Sinclair which are still in my ears and now upon your miserable Tomlinson and compare their ends with the happy and desirable end of the inimitable Miss Harlowe I hope I have reason to think my footing morally secure Your caution nevertheless will be of use however you might design it And since I know my weak side I will endeavour to fortify myself in that quarter by marriage as soon as I can make myself worthy of the confidence and esteem of some virtuous woman and by this means become the subject of your envy rather than of your scoffs  I have already begun my retributory purposes as I may call them I have settled an annual sum for life upon poor John Loftus whom I disabled while he was endeavouring to protect his young mistress from my lawless attempts I rejoice that I succeeded not in that as I do in recollecting many others of the like sort in which I miscarried  Poor Farley who had become a bankrupt I have set up again But have declared that the annual allowance I make her shall cease if I hear she returns to her former courses And I have made her accountable for her conduct to the good widow Lovick whom I have taken at a handsome salary for my housekeeper at Edgeware for I have let the house at Watford and she is to dispense the quarterly allotment to her as she merits  This good woman shall have other matters of the like nature under her care as we grow better acquainted And I make no doubt that she will answer my expectations and that I shall be both confirmed and improved by her conversation For she shall generally sit at my own table  The undeserved sufferings of Miss Clarissa Harlowe her exalted merit her exemplary preparation and her happy end will be standing subjects with us  She shall read  to  me when I have no company write  for  me out of books passages she shall recommend Her years turn'd of fifty and her good character will secure me from scandal and I have great pleasure in reflecting that I shall be better myself for making her happy  Then whenever I am in danger I will read some of the admirable lady's papers Whenever I would abhor my former ways I will read some of thine and copies of my own  The consequence of all this will be that I shall be the delight of my own relations of both sexes who were wont to look upon me as a lost man I shall have good order in my own family because I shall give the example myself I shall be visited and respected not perhaps by Lovelace by Mowbray and by Tourville because they cannot see me upon the  old  terms and will not perhaps see me upon the  new  but by the best and worthiest gentlemen clergy as well as laity all around me I shall look upon my past follies with contempt upon my old companions with pity Oaths and curses shall be for ever banished from my mouth In their place shall succeed conversation becoming a rational being and a gentleman And instead of acts of  offence  subjecting me perpetually to acts of  defence  will I endeavour to atone for my past evils by doing all the good in my power and by becoming an universal benefactor to the extent of that power  Now tell me Lovelace upon this faint sketch of what I hope to  do  and to  be  if this be not a scheme infinitely preferable to the wild the pernicious the dangerous ones both to body and soul which we have pursued  I wish I could make my sketch as amiable to you as it appears to me I wish it with all my soul For I always loved you It has been my misfortune that I did For this led me into infinite riots and follies which otherwise I verily think I should not have been guilty of  You have a great deal more to answer for than I have were it only in the temporal ruin of this admirable woman Let me now while yet you have youth and health and intellect prevail upon you For I am afraid very much afraid that such is the enormity of this single wickedness in depriving the world of such a shining light  that if you do not quickly reform it will be out of your power to reform at all and that Providence which has already given you the fates of your agents Sinclair and Tomlinson to take warning by will not let the principal offender escape if he slight the warning  You will perhaps laugh at me for these serious reflections Do if you will I had rather you should laugh at me for continuing in this way of thinking and acting than triumph over me as you threaten on my swerving from purposes I have determined upon with such good reason and from such good examples  And so much for this subject at present  I should be glad to know when you intend to set out I have too much concern for your welfare not to wish you in a thinner air and more certain climate  What have Tourville and Mowbray to do that they cannot set out with you They will not cove  my company I dare say and I shall not be able to endure theirs when you are gone Take them therefore with you  I will not however forswear making you a visit at Paris at your return from Germany and Italy But hardly with the hope of reclaiming you if due reflection upon what I have set before you and upon what you have written in your two last will not by that time have done it  I suppose I shall see you before you go Once more I wish you were gone This heavy islandair cannot do for you what that of the continent will  I do not think I ought to communicate with you as I used to do on this side the Channel Let me then hear from you on the opposite shore and you shall command the pen as you please and honestly the power of  J BELFORD  LETTER XCI Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Tuesday Sept    FATE I believe in my conscience spins threads for tragedies on purpose for thee to weave withThy Watford uncle poor Bel  on the fair Inimitable Exalted  creature and is she to be found in such a list the accursed woman and Tomlinson seem to have been all doomed to give thee a theme for the Dismal and the HorribleAnd by my soul as Lord M would phrase it  thou dost work it going    That's the horrid thing A man cannot begin to  think  but  causes  for thought croud in upon him The gloomy takes place and mirth and gaiety abandon his heart for ever  Poor M  c  DonaldI am really sorry for the fellowHe was an useful faithful solemn varlet who could act incomparably any part given him and knew not what a blush wasHe really took honest pains for me in the last affair which has cost him and me so dearly in reflection Often gravell'd as we both were yet was he never dauntedPoor M  c  Donald I must once more sayFor carrying on a solemn piece of roguery he had no equal  I was so solicitous to know if he were really as bad as thou hast a knack of painting everybody whom thou singlest out to exercise thy murdering pen upon that I dispatched a man and horse to Maidstone as soon as I had thine and had word brought me that he died in two hours after he had received thy three guineas And all thou wrotest of his concern in relation to the everdear Miss Harlowe it seems was true  I can't help it BelfordI have only to add that it is happy that the poor fellow lived not to be hanged as it seems he would have been For who knows as he had got into such a penitential strain what might have been in his dying speech  When a man has not  great  good to comfort himself with it is right to make the best of the  little  that may offer There never was any discomfort happened to mortal man but some little ray of consolation would dart in if the wretch was not so much a wretch as to  draw  instead of  undraw  the curtain to keep it out  And so much at this time and for ever for poor Capt Tomlinson as I called him  Your solicitude to get me out of this heavy changeable climate exactly tallies with everybody's here They all  believe that travelling will establish me Yet I think I am quite well Only these plaguy  new's  and  full's  and the  equinoctials  fright me a little when I think of them and that is always For the whole family are continually ringing these changes in my ears and are more sedulously intent than I can well account for to get me out of the kingdom  But wilt thou write often when I am gone Wilt thou then piece the thread where thou brokest it off Wilt thou give me the particulars of  their  distress who were my  auxiliaries  in bringing on the event that affects meNay  principals  rather Since say what thou wilt what did I do worth a woman's breaking her heart for  Faith and troth Jack I have had very hard usage as I have often saidTo have such a plaguy ill name given me pointed at screamed out upon run away from as a mad dog would be all my own friends ready to renounce me  Yet I think I deserve it all For have I not been as ready to give up myself as others are to condemn me  What madness what folly thisWho will take the part of a man that condemns himselfWho can He that pleads guilty to an indictment leaves no room for ought but the sentence Out upon me for an impolitic wretch I have not the art of the least artful of any of our Christian princes who every day are guilty of ten times worse breaches of faith and yet issuing out a manifesto they wipe their mouths and go on from infraction to infraction from robbery to robbery commit devastation upon devastation and destroyfor their  glory  And are rewarded with the names of  Conquerors  and are dubb'd  Le Grand  praised and even deified by orators and poets for their butcheries and depredations  While I a poor single harmless prowler at least  comparatively  harmless in order to satisfy my hunger steal but one poor lamb and every mouth is opened every hand is lifted up against me  Nay as I have just now heard I am to be  manifesto  d  against tho' no prince For Miss Howe threatens to have the case published to the whole world  I have a good mind not to oppose it and to write an  answer to it as soon as it comes forth and exculpate myself by throwing all the fault upon the old ones And this I have to plead supposing all that my worst enemies can allege against me were trueThat I am not answerable for all the extravagant and unforeseen consequences that this affair has been attended with  And this I will prove demonstrably by a case which but a few hours ago I put to Lord M and to the two Misses Montague This it is  Suppose  A  a miser had hid a parcel of gold in a  secret place  in order to keep it there till he could lend it out at extravagant interest  Suppose  B  in such great want of this treasure as to be unable to  live without it    And suppose  A  the  miser  has such an opinion of  B  the  wanter  that he would rather lend it to him than to any mortal living but yet tho' he has  no other  use in the world for it insists upon very unconscionable terms  B  would gladly pay  common  interest for it but would be undone in  his own  opinion at least and that is everything to him if he complied with the miser's terms since he would be sure to be soon thrown into  gaol  for the debt and made a  prisoner for life  Wherefore guessing being an arch penetrating fellow where the  sweet hoard  lies he  searches  for it when the miser is in a  profound sleep  finds it and runs away with it  B  in this case can be only a  thief  that's plain Jack  Here Miss Montague put in very smartlyA thief Sir said she that steals what is and ought to be dearer to me than my life deserves less to be forgiven than he who murders me  But what is this cousin Charlotte said I that is dearer to you than your life Your  honour  you'll sayI will not talk to a lady I never did in a way she cannot answer meBut in the instance for which I put my case allowing all you attribute to the phantom what honour is lost where the  will  is not violated and the person cannot help it But with respect to the case put how knew  we till the theft  was committed  that the miser did actually set so romantic a value upon the treasure  Both my cousins were silent and my Lord cursed me because he could not answer me and I proceeded  Well then the result is that  B  can only be a thief that's plainTo pursue therefore my case  Suppose this same miserly  A  on awaking and searching for and finding his treasure gone takes it so much to heart that he starves himself  Who but himself is to blame for thatWould either Equity Law or Conscience hang  B  for a murder  And now to apply said I  None of your applications cried my cousins both in a breath  None of your applications and be dn'd to you the passionate Peer  Well then returned I I am to conclude it to be a case so plain that it needs none looking at the two girls who tried for a blush apiece And I hold myself of consequence acquitted of the  death    Not so cried my Lord Peers are judges thou knowest Jack in the last resort For if by committing an unlawful act a capital crime is the consequence you are answerable for both  Say you so my good LordBut will you take upon you to say supposing as in the present case a Rape saving your presence cousin Charlotte saving your presence cousin Patty Is death the  natural  consequence of a RapeDid you ever hear my Lord or did you Ladies that it wasAnd if not the  natural  consequence and a lady will destroy herself whether by a lingering death as of grief or by the dagger as Lucretia did Is there more than one fault the  man  'sIs not the other  her  'sWere it not so let me tell you my dears chucking each of my blushing cousins under the chin we either have had no men so wicked as young Tarquin was or no women so virtuous as Lucretia in the space ofHow many thousand years my LordAnd so Lucretia is recorded as a single wonder  You may believe I was cry'd out upon People who  cannot answer will rave And this they all did But I insisted upon it to them and so I do to you Jack that I ought to be acquitted of everything but a common theft a private larceny as the lawyers call it in this point And were my life to be a forfeit to the Law it would not be for murder  Besides as I told them there was a circumstance strongly in my favour in this case For I would have been glad with all my soul to have purchased my forgiveness by a compliance with the terms I first boggled at And this I offered and my Lord and Lady Betty and Lady Sarah and my two cousins and all my cousins cousins to the fourteenth generation would have been bound for meBut it would not do The sweet miser would break her heart and die and how could I help it  Upon the whole Jack had not the lady died would there have been half so much said of it as there is Was I the cause of her death or Could I help it And have there not been in a million of cases like this nine hundred and ninetynine thousand that have not ended as this has endedHow hard then is my fateUpon my soul I won't bear it as I have done but instead of takeing guilt to myself claim pity And this since yesterday cannot be recalled is the only course I can pursue to make myself easy Proceed anon  LETTER XCII Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  BUT what a pretty scheme of life hast thou drawn out for thyself and thy old widow By my soul Jack I am mightily taken with it There is but one thing wanting in it and that will come of course Only to be in the commission and one of the quorum Thou art already provided with a clerk as good as thou'lt want for thou understandest Law and she Conscience A good Lord Chancellor between yeI should take prodigious pleasure to hear thee decide in a bastard case upon thy new notions and old remembrances  But raillery apart All gloom at heart by Jupiter altho' the pen and the countenance assume airs of levity  If after all thou canst so easily repent and reform as thou thinkest thou canst If thou canst thus shake off thy old sins and thy old habits And if thy old master will so readily dismiss so tried and so faithful a servant and permit thee thus calmly to enjoy thy new system no room for scandal all temptation ceasing And if at last thy reformation warranted and approved by time thou marriest and livest honestWhy Belford I cannot but say that if all these IF's come to pass thou standest a good chance to be a happy man  All I think as I told thee in my last is that the devil knows his own interest too well to let thee off so easily Thou thyself tellest me that we cannot repent when we will And indeed I found it so For in my lucid intervals I made good resolutions But as health turned its blyth side to me and opened my prospects of recovery all my old inclinations and appetites returned and this letter perhaps will be a thorough conviction to thee that I  am  as wild a fellow as ever or in the way to be so  Thou askest me very seriously If upon the faint sketch thou hast drawn thy new scheme be not infinitely preferable to any of those which we have so long pursuedWhy JackLet me reflectWhy BelfordI can't say but it is It is really as Biddy in the play says a good comfortable scheme  But when thou tellest me That it was thy misfortune to love me because thy value for me made thee a wickeder man than otherwise thou wouldst have been I desire thee to revolve this assertion And I am persuaded that thou wilt not find thyself in so right a train as thou imaginest  No false colourings no glosses does a true penitent aim at Debasement diffidence mortification contrition are all near of kin Jack and inseparable from a repentant spiritIf thou knowest not this thou art not got three steps out of threescore towards repentance and amendment And let me remind thee before the grand accuser comes to do it that thou wert ever above being a passive follower in iniquity Tho' thou hadst not so good an invention as he to whom thou writest thou hadst as active an heart for mischief as ever I met with in man  Then for improving an hint thou wert always a true  Englishman I never started a roguery that did not come out of  thy  forge in a manner ready anvilled and hammered for execution when I have sometimes been at a loss to make anything of it myself  What indeed made me appear to be more wicked than thee was that I being a handsome fellow and thou an ugly one when we had started a game and hunted it down the poor frighted puss generally chose to throw herself into my paws rather than into thine And then disappointed hast thou wiped thy blubberlips and marched off to start a new game calling me a wicked fellow all the while  In short Belford thou wert an excellent  starter  and  setter  The old women were not afraid for their daughters when they saw such a face as thine But when  I  came whip was the key turned upon their girls And yet all signified nothing for Love upon occasion will draw an elephant thro' a keyhole But for thy HEART Belford who ever doubted  that    Nor even in this affair that sticks most upon me and which my conscience makes such a handle of against me art thou so innocent as thou fansiest thyself Thou wilt stare at this But it is true and I will convince thee of it in an instant  Thou sayst thou wouldst have saved the lady from the ruin she met with Thou art a pretty fellow for this For  how  wouldst thou have saved her What methods didst thou  take  to save her  Thou knewest my designs all along Hadst thou a mind to make thyself a good title to the merit to which thou now pretendest to lay claim thou shouldest like a true knighterrant have sought to set the lady free from her inchanted castle Thou shouldst have apprised her of her danger have stolen in when the giant was out of the way or hadst thou the true spirit of chivalry upon thee and nothing else would have done have killed the giant and then something wouldst thou have had to brag of  'O but the giant was my friend He reposed a confidence in me And I should have betrayed my friend and his confidence'  This thou wouldst have pleaded no doubt But try this plea upon thy present principles  and thou wilt see what a caitiff thou wert to let it have weight with thee upon an occasion where a breach of confidence is more excuseable than to keep the secret  Thou canst not pretend and I know thou wilt not that thou wert afraid of thy life by taking such a measure For a braver fellow lives not nor a more fearless than Jack Belford I remember several instances and thou canst not forget them where thou hast ventured thy bones thy neck thy life against numbers in a cause of roguery and hadst thou had a spark of that virtue which now thou art willing to flatter thyself thou hast thou wouldst surely have run a risk to save an innocence and a virtue that it became every man to protect and espouse This is the truth of the case greatly as it makes against myself But I hate an hypocrite from my soul  I believe I should have killed thee at the  time  if I could hadst thou betrayed me thus But I am sure  now  that I would have thanked thee for it with all my heart and thought thee more a father and a friend than my real father and my best friendAnd it was natural for thee to think with so exalted a merit as this lady had that this would have been the case when consideration took place of passion or rather when that damn'd fondness for intrigue ceased which never was my pride so much as it is now upon reflection my curse  Set about defending thyself and I will probe thee still deeper and convict thee still more effectually that thou hast more guilt than merit even in this affair And as to all the others in which we have hunted in couples thou wert always the forwardest whelp and more ready by far to run away with me than I with thee Yet canst thou now compose thy horsemuscles and cry out How much more hast thou Lovelace to answer for than I haveSaying  nothing  neither when thou sayst this were it  true  For thou wilt not be tried when the time comes by  comparison    In short thou mayst at this rate so miserably deceive thyself that notwithstanding all thy selfdenial and mortification when thou closest thy eyes thou mayst perhaps open them in a place where thou thoughtest least to be  However consult thy old woman on this subject I  shall be thought to be out of character if I go on in this strain But really as to a title to merit in this affair I do assure thee Jack that thou less deservest praise than an horsepond And I wish I had the sousing of thee  I AM actually now employed in taking leave of my friends in the country I had once thoughts of taking Tomlinson as I called him with me But his destiny has frustrated that intention  Next Monday I think to see you in town and then you and I and Mowbray and Tourville will laugh off that evening together They will both accompany me as I expect  you  will to Dover if not cross the water I must leave you and them good friends They take extremely amiss the treatment you have given them in your last letters They say you strike at their understandings I laugh at them and tell them that those people who have  least  are the most apt to be angry when it is called in question  Make up all the papers and narratives you can spare me against the time The Will particularly I expect to take with me Who knows but that those things which will help to secure  you  in the way you are got into may convert  me  Thou talkest of a wife Jack What thinkest thou of our Charlotte Her family and fortune I doubt according to thy scheme are a little too high Will those be an objection Charlotte is a smart girl For piety thy present turn I cannot say much Yet she is as serious as most of her Sex at her time of lifeWould flaunt it a little I believe too like the rest of them were her reputation under covert  But it won't do neither now I think of itThou art so homely and so aukward a creature Hast such a boatswain like airPeople would think she had picked thee up in Wapping or Rotherhith or in going to see some new ship launched or to view the docks at Chatham or Portsmouth So gaudy and so clumsy Thy tawdriness won't do with CharlotteSo sit thee down contented Belford  Yet would I fain secure thy morals too if matrimony will do it  Let me seeNow I have it  Has not the widow Lovick a daughter or a niece It is not every girl of  fortune  and  family  that will go to prayers with thee  once or twice a day  But since thou art for takeing a wife to mortify with what if thou marriest the widow herselfShe will then have a double concern in thy conversion You and she may  tête à tête  pass many a comfortable winter's evening together comparing  experiences  as the good folks call them  I am serious Jack Faith I am And I would have thee take it into thy wise consideration  LETTER XCIII Mr  BELFORD  To Colonel  MORDEN    Thursday Sept    GIVE me leave dear Sir to address myself to you in a very serious and solemn manner on a subject that I must not cannot dispense with as I promised the divine lady that I would do everything in my power to prevent that further mischief which she was so very apprehensive of  I will not content myself with distant hints It is with very great concern that I have just now heard of a declaration which you are said to have made to your relations at HarlowePlace That you will not rest till you have avenged your cousin's wrongs upon Mr Lovelace  Far be it from me to offer to defend the unhappy man or even  unduly  to extenuate his crime But yet I must say that the family by their persecutions of the dear lady at first and by their implacableness afterwards ought  at least  to  share  the blame with him There is even great reason to believe that a lady of such a religious turn her virtue neither to be surprised nor corrupted her will inviolate would have got over a  mere personal  injury especially as he would have done all that was in his power to repair it and as from the application of all his family in his favour and other circumstances attending his sincere  and voluntary offer the lady might have condescended with greater glory to herself than if he had never offended  When I have the pleasure of seeing you next I will acquaint you Sir with all the circumstances of this melancholy story from which you will see that Mr Lovelace was extremely illtreated at first by the whole family this admirable lady excepted This exception I know heightens his crime But as his principal intention was but to try her virtue and that he became so earnest a suppliant to her for marriage and as he has suffered so deplorably in the loss of his reason for not having it in his power to repair her wrongs I presume to hope that much is to be pleaded against such a resolution as you are said to have made  I will read to you at the same time some passages from letters of his two of which one but this moment received will convince you that the unhappy man who is but now recovering his intellects needs no greater punishment than what he has from his own reflections  I have just now read over the  copies  of the dear lady's posthumous letters I send them all to you except that directed for Mr Lovelace which I reserve till I have the pleasure of seeing you Let me intreat you to read once more  that  to yourself and  that  to her brother  See p  which latter I now send you as they are in point to the present subject  I think Sir they are unanswerable Such at least is the effect they have upon me that I hope I shall never be provoked to draw my sword again in a private quarrel  To the weight these must needs have upon you let me add that the unhappy man has given no  new  occasion of offence since your visit to him at Lord M's when you were so well satisfied of his intention to repair his crimes that you yourself urged to your dear cousin  her  forgiveness of him  Let me  also  tho' I presume to hope there is no need when you coolly consider everything remind you of your own promise to your departing cousin relying upon which her last moments were the easier  My dear colonel Morden the highest injury was to  her  Her family all have a share in the  cause She  forgives it Why should we not endeavour to imitate what we admire  You asked me Sir when in town If a brave man could be a premeditatedly base oneGenerally speaking I believe Bravery and Baseness are incompatible But Mr Lovelace's character in the instance before us affords a proof of the truth of the common observation That there is no general rule but has its exceptions For England I believe as gallant a nation as it is deemed to be has not in it a braver spirit than his nor a man who has greater skill at his weapons nor more  calmness  with his skill  I mention not this with a thought that it can affect Col Morden who if he be not withheld by SUPERIOR MOTIVES as well as influenced by those I have reminded him of will tell me That this skill and this bravery will make him the more worthy of being called upon by him  To these SUPERIOR motives then I refer myself And with the greater confidence as a pursuit ending in blood would not at  this time  have the plea lie for it with  anybody  which sudden passion might have with  some  But would be construed by  all  to be a cool and deliberate act of revenge for an evil absolutely irretrievable An act which a brave and noble spirit such as the gentleman's to whom I now write is not capable of  Excuse me Sir for the sake of my executorial duty and promise keeping in eye the dear lady's  personal injunctions  as well as  written will  inforced by  letters posthumous  Every article of which solicitous as we  both  are to see it duly performed she would have dispensed with rather than farther mischief should happen on her account I am  Dear  SIR    Your affectionate and faithful Servant  JOHN BELFORD  The following is the posthumous letter to Col Morden referred to in the above  LETTER XCIV Superscribed To my beloved Cousin  WILLIAM MORDEN  Esq  To be delivered after my death  My dearest Cousin  AS it is uncertain from my present weak state whether if living I may be in a condition to receive as I ought the favour you intend me of a visit when you come to London I take this opportunity to return you while able the humble acknowlegements of a grateful heart for all your goodness to me from childhood till now And more particularly for your present kind interposition in my favourGod Almighty for ever bless you dear Sir for the kindness you endeavoured to procure for me  One principal end of my writing to you in this solemn manner is to beg of you which I do with the utmost earnestness that when you come to hear the particulars of my story you will not suffer  active  resentment to take place in your generous breast on my account  Remember my dear cousin that vengeance is God's province and he has undertaken to repay it nor will you I hope invade that provinceEspecially as there is no necessity for you to attempt to vindicate my fame since the offender himself before he is called upon has stood forth and offered to do me all the justice that you could have extorted from him had I lived And when your own person may be endangered by running an  equal  risque with a  guilty man    Duelling Sir I need not tell  you  who have adorned a public character is not only an usurpation of the Divine prerogative but it is an insult upon magistracy and good government 'Tis an impious act 'Tis an attempt to take away a life that ought not to depend upon a private sword An act the consequence of which is to hurry a soul all its sins upon its head into perdition endangering that of the poor triumpherSince neither intend to give to the other that  chance  as I may call it for the  Divine mercy in an opportunity for repentance which each presumes to hope for himself  Seek not then I beseech you Sir to aggravate my fault by a pursuit of blood which must necessarily be deemed a consequence of it Give not the unhappy man the merit were you assuredly to be the victor of falling by your hand At present he is the perfidious the ingrateful deceiver but will not the forfeiture of his life and the probable loss of his soul be a dreadful expiation for having made me miserable for  a few months  only and thro' that misery by the Divine favour happy to all Eternity  In such a case my cousin where shall the evil stop And who shall avenge on youAnd who on your avenger  Let the poor man's conscience then dear Sir avenge me He will one day find punishment more than enough from that Leave him to the chance of repentance If the Almighty will give him time for it why should you deny it himLet him still be the guilty aggressor and let no one say Clarissa Harlowe is now amply revenged in his fall or in the case of yours which Heaven avert that her fault instead of being buried in her grave is perpetuated and aggravated by a loss far greater than that of herself  Often Sir has the  more  guilty been the vanquisher of the  less  An Earl of Shrewsbury in the reign of Charles II as I have read endeavouring to revenge the greatest injury that man can do to man met with his death at BarnElms from the hand of the ignoble Duke who had vilely dishonoured him Nor can it be thought an unequal dispensation were it  generally  to happen that the usurper of the Divine prerogative should be punished for his presumption by the man whom he sought to destroy and who however  previously  criminal is put in this case upon a necessary act of selfdefence  May Heaven protect you Sir in all your ways and once more I pray reward you for all your kindness to me A kindness so worthy of  your  heart and so exceedingly grateful to  mine  That of seeking to make peace and to reconcile parents to a once beloved child uncles  to a niece late their favourite and a brother and sister to a sister whom once they thought not unworthy of that tender relation A kindness so greatly preferable to the vengeance of the murdering sword  Be a comforter dear Sir to my honoured parents as you have been to me And may we thro' the Divine goodness to us both meet in that blessed Eternity into which as I humbly trust I shall have entered when you read This  So prays and to her latest hour will pray my dear cousin Morden my Friend my Guardian but not my AvengerDear Sir remember That  Your everaffectionate and obliged  CLARISSA HARLOWE  LETTER XCV Colonel  MORDEN  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Sat Sept    Dear Sir  I AM very sorry that anything you have heard I have said should give you uneasiness  I am obliged to you for the letters you have communicated to me and still further for your promise to favour me with others occasionally  All that relates to my dear cousin I shall be glad to see be it from whom it will  I leave to your own discretion what may or may not be proper for Miss Howe to see from so free a pen as mine  I admire her spirit Were she a  man  do you think Sir  she  would at  this time  have your advice to take upon such a subject as that you write upon  Fear not however that your communications shall put me upon any measures that otherwise I should not have taken The wickedness Sir is of such a nature as admits not of aggravation  Yet I do assure you that I have not made any resolutions that will be a tie upon me  I have indeed expressed myself with vehemence upon the occasion Who could forbear to do so But it is not my way to resolve in matters of moment till opportunity brings the execution of my purposes within my reach  We shall see what manner of spirit this young man will be acted by on his recovery If he continue to brave and defy a family which he has so irreparably injuredIfBut resolutions depending upon future contingencies are best left to future determination as I just now hinted  Mean time I will own that I think my cousin's arguments unanswerable No  good  man but must be concluded by themBut alas Sir who is  good  As to your arguments I hope you will believe me when I assure you as I now do that your opinion and your reasonings have and will always have great and deserved weight with me And that I respect you still more than I did if possible for your expostulations in favour of the end of my cousin's pious injunctions to me They come from  you  Sir with the greatest propriety as her executor and representative and likewise as you are a man of humanity and a wellwisher to both parties  I am not exempt from violent passions Sir any more than your friend but then I hope they are only capable of being raised by other peoples insolence and not by my own arrogance If ever I am stimulated by my imperfections and my resentments to act against my judgment and my cousin's injunctions some such reflections as these that follow will run away with my reason Indeed they are always present with me  In the first place My own disappointment Who came over with the hope of passing the remainder of my days in the conversation of a kinswoman so beloved and to whom I had a double relation as her cousin and trustee  Then I reflect tootoo often perhaps for my engagements to her in her last hours that the dear creature could only forgive for  herself  She no doubt is happy But who shall forgive for a  whole family  in all its branches made miserable for their lives  That the more faulty her friends were as to  her  the more enormous his ingratitude and the more inexcusableWhat Sir was it not enough that she suffered what she did  for him  but the barbarian must make her suffer for her sufferings for  his sake    Passion makes me express this weakly Passion refuses strength sometimes where the propriety of a resentment  prima facie  declares expression to be needless I leave it to  you  Sir to give this reflection its due force  That the author of this diffusive mischief perpetrated it premeditatedly wantonly in the gaiety of his heart To  try  my cousin say you Sir To try the virtue of a Clarissa SirHad she then given him any cause to doubt her virtueIt could not beIf he averrs that she didI am indeed called uponBut I will have patience  That he carried her as now it appears to a vile brothel purposely to put her out of all human resource Himself out of the reach of all humane remorse And that finding her proof against all the common arts of delusion base and unmanly arts were there used to effect his wicked purposes  Once dead  the injured saint in her will says  he has seen her    That I could not know this when I saw him at M Hall That the object of his attempts considered I could not suppose there was such a monster breathing as he That it was natural for me to impute her refusal of him rather to transitory resentment to consciousness of human frailty and mingled doubts of the sincerity of his offers than to villainies which had given the irreversible blow and had at that instant brought her down to the gates of death which in a very few days inclosed her  That he is a man of defiance A man who thinks to awe everyone by his insolent darings and by his pretensions to superior courage and skill  That disgrace as he is to his name and to the character of a gentleman the man would not want his merit who in vindication of the  dishonoured  distinction should expunge and blot him out of the worthy list  That the injured family has a son who however unworthy of such a sister is of a temper vehement unbridled fierce unequal therefore as he has once indeed been found to a contention with this man The  loss of which son by a violent death on such an occasion by a hand so justly hated would complete the misery of the whole family And who nevertheless resolves to call him to account if I do not His very  misbehaviour  perhaps to such a sister stimulating his perverse heart to do her memory the  more signal  justice tho' the attempt might be fatal to him  Then Sir to be a witness as I am every hour to the calamity and distress of a family to which I am related everyone of whom however averse to an alliance with him while it had  not  taken place would no doubt have been soon reconciled to the admirable creature had the man to whom for his family and fortunes it was not a disgrace to be allied done her but common justice  To see them hang their pensive heads mope about shunning one another tho' formerly never used to meet but to rejoice in each other afflicting themselves with reflections that the last time they respectively saw the dear creature it was here or there at such a place in such an attitude and could they have thought that it would have been the  last  Everyone of them reviving instances of her excellencies that will for a long time make their very blessings a curse to them  Her closet her chamber her cabinet given up to me to disfurnish in order to answer now  too late  obliging the legacies bequeathed unable themselves to enter them and even making use of less convenient backstairs that they may avoid passing by the doors of her apartment  Her parlour locked up the walks the retirements the summerhouse in which she delighted and used to pursue her charming works  that  in particular from which she went to the fatal interview shunned or hurried by or over  Her perfections nevertheless called up to remembrance and enumerated Incidents and graces unheeded before or passed  ver in the groupe of her numberless perfections now brought into notice and dwelt upon  The very servants allowed to expatiate upon these praiseful topics to their principals Even eloquent in their praisesThe distressed principals listening and weeping Then to see them break in upon the zealous applauders by their impatience and remorse and throw abroad their helpless hands and exclaim then again to see them listen to hear more of her praises and weep againThey even encouraging the servants to repeat how they used to be stopt by strangers to ask after her and by those who knew her to be told of some new instances to her honourHow aggravating all this  In  dreams  they see her and  desire  to see her Always an angel and accompanied by angels Always clad in robes of light Always endeavouring to comfort  them  who declare that they shall never more know comfort  What an example she set How she indited How she drew How she wrought How she talked How she sung How she played Her voice music Her accent harmony  Her conversation how instructive how sought after The delight of persons of all ages of both sexes of all ranks Yet how humble how condescending Never were dignity and humility so illustriously mingled  At other times how generous how noble how charitable how judicious in her charities In every action laudable In every attitude attractive In every appearance whether fulldressed or in the housewife's more humble garb equally elegant and equally lovely  Like  or  resembling  Miss Clarissa Harlowe they now remember to be a praise denoting the highest degree of approveable excellence with everyone whatever person action or rank spoken of  The desirable daughter the obliging kinswoman the affectionate sister All envy now subsided the faithful the warm friend the affable the kind the benevolent mistressNot one fault remembered All their severities called cruelties Mutually accuseing  each other each him and herself and all to raise  her  character and torment themselves  Such Sir is the angel of whom the vilest of men has deprived the world You Sir who know more of the barbarous machinations and practices of this strange man can help me to still more inflaming reasons were they needed why a man  not perfect  may stand excused to the generality of the world if he should pursue his vengeance  But I will force myself from the subject after I have repeated that I have not yet made any resolutions that can bind me Whenever I do I shall be glad they may be such as may merit the honour of your approbation  I send you back the copies of the posthumous letters I see the humanity of your purpose in the transmission of them to me and I thank you most heartily for it I presume that it is owing to the same laudable consideration that you kept back the copy of that to the wicked man himself  I intend to wait upon Miss Howe in person with the diamond ring and such other of the effects bequeathed to her as are here I am SIR  Your most faithful and obliged Servant  WM MORDEN  Mr Belford in his answer to this letter farther inforces the lady's dying injunctions and rejoices that the Colonel has made no vindictive resolutions and hopes everything from his prudence and consideration and from his promise given to the dying lady  He refers to the seeing him in town an account of the dreadful ends of two of the greatest criminals in his cousin's affair  'This says he together with Mr Lovelace's disorder of mind looks as if Providence had already taken the punishment of these unhappy wretches into its own hands'  He desires a days notice of his coming to town lest otherwise he may be absent at the time  This he does tho' he tells him not the reason with a view to prevent a meeting between him and Mr Lovelace who may be in town as he apprehends about the same time in his way to go abroad  LETTER XCVI Colonel  MORDEN  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Tuesday Sept    Dear Sir  I Cannot help congratulating myself as well as you that we have already got thro' with the family every article of the Will where  they  have any concern  You left me a discretional power in many instances and in pursuance of it I have had my dear cousin's personal jewels valued and will account to you for them at the highest price when I come to town as well as for other matters that you were pleased to intrust to my management  These jewels I have presented to my cousin Dolly Hervey in acknowlegement of her love to the dear departed I have told Miss Howe of this and she is as well pleased with what I have done as if she had been the purchaser of them herself As that young lady has jewels of her own she could only have wished to purchase these for her beloved friend's sake  The grandmother's jewels are also valued and the money will be paid me for you to be carried to the uses of the Will  Mrs Norton is preparing by general consent to enter upon her office as housekeeper at  The Grove  But it is my opinion that she will not be long on this side Heaven  I waited upon Miss Howe myself as I told you I would with what was bequeathed to her and her mother If I make a few observations with regard to that young lady so dear to my beloved cousin you will not be displeased perhaps as you have not a personal acquaintance with her  There never was a firmer and nobler friendship in women than that which the wretched man has put an end to between my dear cousin and Miss Howe  Friendship  generally speaking Mr Belford is too fervent a flame for female minds to manage A light that but in few of their hands burns steady and often hurries the Sex into flight and absurdity Like other extremes it is hardly ever durable Marriage which is the highest  state of friendship generally absorbs the most vehement friendships of female to female and that whether the wedlock be happy or not  What female mind is capable of two fervent friendships at the same time  This I mention as a  general observation  But the friendship that subsisted between these two ladies affords a remarkable exception to it Which I account for from those qualities and attainments in  both  which were they more common would furnish more exceptions still in favour of the Sex Both had an  inlarged  and even a  liberal  education Both had minds thirsting after virtuous knowlege Great readers both Great writersAnd  early familiar writing  I take to be one of the greatest openers and improvers of the mind that man or woman can be imployed in Both generous High in fortune therefore above that dependence each on the other that frequently destroys the familiarity which is the cement of friendship Both excelling in  different ways  in which neither sought to emulate the other Both blessed with clear and distinguishing faculties with solid sense and from their first intimacy I have many of my lights Sir from Mrs Norton each seeing something in the other to  fear  as well as  love  yet making it an indispensable condition of their friendship each to tell the other of her failings and to be thankful for the freedom taken One by nature  gentle  the other  made so  by her  love  and  admiration  of her exalted friendImpossible that there could be a friendship better calculated for duration  I must however take the liberty to blame Miss Howe for her behaviour to Mr Hickman And I infer from it that even women of sense are not to be trusted with power  By the way I am sure I need not desire you not to communicate to this fervent young lady the liberties I take with her character  I dare say my cousin could not approve of Miss Howe's behaviour to this gentleman A behaviour which is talked of by as many as know Mr Hickman and her Can a  wise  young lady be easy under such censureShe  must  know it  Mr Hickman is really a very worthy man Everybody speaks well of him But he is gentledispositioned and he adores Miss Howe and Love admits not of an air of even due dignity to the object of it Yet will he hardly ever get back the reins he has yielded up unless she by carrying too far the power she seems at present too sensible of should when she has no favours to confer which he has not a right to demand provoke him to throw off the too heavy yoke And should he do so and then treat her with negligence Miss Howe of all the women I know will be the least able to support herself under it She will then be  more  unhappy than she ever made him For a man who is uneasy at home can divert himself abroad which a woman cannot so easily do without scandal  Permit me to take further notice as to Miss Howe that it is very obvious to me that she has by her haughty behaviour to this worthy man involved herself in one difficulty from which she knows not how to extricate herself with that grace which accompanies all her actions She intends to have Mr Hickman I believe she does not dislike him And it will cost her no small pains to descend from the elevation she has climbed to  Another inconveniency she will suffer from her having taught everybody for she is above disguise to think by her treatment of Mr Hickman much more meanly of him than he deserves to be thought of And must  she  not suffer dishonour in  his  dishonour  Mrs Howe is much disturbed at her daughter's behaviour to the gentleman He is very deservedly a favour  ite of hers But  another  failing in Miss Howe her mother has not all the authority with her that her daughter's good sense ought to permit her to have It is very difficult Mr Belford for people of  different  or  contrary  dispositions tho' no bad people neither to mingle REVERENCE with their  Love  for each other even where  Nature  has called for  Love  in the relationship  Miss Howe is  open generous noble  The Mother has not any of these fine qualities Parents in order to preserve their childrens veneration for them should take great care not to let them see anything in their conduct  or behaviour or principles which they themselves would not approve of in others  But after all I see that there is something so charmingly brilliant and frank in Miss Howe's disposition altho' at present visibly overclouded by grief that it is impossible not to love her even for her failings She  may  and I hope she  will  make Mr Hickman an obliging wife And if she do she will have an additional merit with me since she cannot be apprehensive of check or controul and may therefore by her  generosity  and  prudence  lay an obligation upon her husband by the performance of what is no more than her  duty    Her mother both  loves  and  fears  her Yet is Mrs Howe a woman of vivacity and ready enough I dare say to cry out when she is pained But alas she has as I hinted above  weakened her authority  by the  narrowness of her mind    Yet once she praised her daughter to me for the generosity of her spirit with so much  warmth  that had I not known the old lady's character I should have thought her generous  herself  And yet I have always observed that people even of narrow tempers are ready to praise generous onesAnd thus have I accounted for it that such persons generally find it to their purpose that all the world should be openminded but themselves  The old lady applied herself to me to urge to the young one the contents of the Will in order to hasten her to fix a day for her marriage But desired that I would not let Miss Howe know that she did  I took the liberty upon it to tell the young lady that I hoped that  her  part of a Will so soon and so punctually in almost all its other articles fulfilled would not be the only one that would be slighted  Her answer was She would consider of it And made me a courtesy with such an air as shewed me that she thought me more out of my sphere than I could allow her to think me had I been permitted to argue the point with her  I found both Miss Howe and her own servantmaid in deep mourning This it seems had occasioned a great debate at first between her mother and her Her mother had  the words of the Will on her side and Mr Hickman's interest in her view as her daughter had said that she would wear it for six months at least But the young lady carried her point  'Strange said she if I who shall mourn the heavy the irreparable loss to the last hour of my life should not shew my concern to the world for a few months'  Mr Hickman for his part was so far from uttering an opposing word on this occasion that on the very day that Miss Howe put on hers he waited on her in a new suit of mourning as for a near relation His servants and equipage made the same respectful appearance  Whether the mother was consulted by him in it I cannot say but the daughter knew nothing of it till she saw him in it She looked at him with surprize and asked him for whom he mourned  The dear and everdear Miss Harlowe he said  She was at a loss it seemsAt lastAll the world ought to mourn for my Clarissa said she but who Man that was her address to him thinkest thou to oblige by this appearance  It is more than  appearance  madam I love not my own sister worthy as she is better than I loved Miss Clarissa Harlowe I oblige  myself  by it And if I disoblige not you that is all I have to wish  She surveyed him I am told from head to foot She knew not at first whether to be angry or pleasedAt length I thought at first said she that you might have a bolder and freer motiveBut as my mamma says you may be a wellmeaning man tho' generally a little wrongheadedHowever as the world is censorious and may think us nearer of kin than I would have it supposed I must take care honest friend that I am not seen abroad in your company  But let me add Mr Belford that if this compliment of Mr Hickman or this  more  than compliment as I may well call it since the worthy man speaks not of my dear cousin without emotion does not produce a short day I shall think Miss Howe has less generosity in her temper than I am willing to allow her  You will excuse me Mr Belford I dare say for the particularities which you have invited and encouraged  Having now seen everything that relates to the Will of my dear cousin brought to a desirable issue I will set about making my own I shall follow the dear creature's example and give my reasons for every article that there may be no room for aftercontention  What but a fear of death a fear unworthy of a creature who knows that he must one day as surely die as he was born can hinder any one from making such a disposition  I hope soon to pay my respects to you in town Mean time I am with great respect dear SIR  Your faithful and affectionate humble Servant  WM MORDEN  LETTER XCVII Mr  BELFORD  To Miss  HOWE    Thursday Sept    Madam  I DO myself the honour to send you with This

I complied but I first took a copy of it As I have not told him that I have done so you will be pleased to forbear communicating of it to anybody but Mr Hickman That gentleman's perusal of it will be the same as if nobody but yourself saw it  One of the letters of Colonel Morden's which I inclose you will observe Madam is only a copy  Viz The preceding  The true reason for which as I will ingenuously acknowlege is some free but respectful observations which the Colonel has made upon you Madam for declining to carry into execution your part of your dear friend's last requests I have therefore in respect to that worthy gentleman having a caution from him on that head omitted those parts  Will you allow me Madam however to tell you that I myself could not have believed that my inimitable testatrix's own Miss Howe would have been the most backward in performing such a part of her dear friend's last Will as is intirely in her own power to performEspecially when that performance would make one of the most deserving men in England happy and whom I presume she proposes to honour with her hand  Excuse me Madam I have a most sincere veneration for you and would not disoblige you for the world  I will not presume to make remarks on the letters I send you Nor upon the informations I have to give you of the dreadful end of two unhappy wretches who were the greatest criminals in the affair of your adorable friend These are the infamous  Sinclair  and a person whom you have read of no doubt in the letters of the charming Innocent by the name of Captain  Tomlinson    The wretched woman died in the extremest tortures and despondency The man from wounds got in defending himself in carrying on a contraband trade Both accusing themselves in their last hours for the parts they had acted against the most excellent of women as of the crime they had most remorse for  Give me leave to say Madam that if your compassion be not excited for the poor man who suffers from his own anguish of mind as you will see by his letter and for the unhappy family whose remorse as you will see by Col Morden's is so deepyour terror must And yet I shall not wonder if the just sense of the irreparable loss you have sustained hardens a heart against pity which on a less extraordinary occasion would want its principal grace if it were not compassionate  I am Madam with the greatest respect and gratitude  Your most obliged and faithful humble Servant  J BELFORD  LETTER XCVIII Miss  HOWE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Sat Sept    SIR  I Little thought I ever could have owed so much obligation to any man as you have laid me under And yet what you have sent me has almost broken my heart and ruined my eyes  I am surprised tho' agreeably that you have so soon and so well got over that part of the trust you have engaged in which relates to the family  It may be presumed from the exits you mention of two of the infernal man's accomplices that the thunderbolt will not stop short of the principal Indeed I have some pleasure to think it seems rolling along towards the devoted head that has plotted all the mischief But let me however say that altho' I think Mr Morden not altogether in the wrong in his reasons for resenting as he is the dear creature's Kinsman and Trustee yet I think you very much in the right in endeavouring to dissuade him from it as you are her Executor and act in pursuance of her earnest request  But what a letter is that of the infernal man I cannot observe upon it Neither can I for very different reasons upon my dear creature's posthumous letters particularly on that to him Oh Mr Belford what numberless perfections died when my Clarissa drew her last breath  If decency be observed in his letters for I have not yet had patience to read above two or three of them besides this horrid one which I return you inclosed I may some time hence be curious to look by  their  means into the hearts of wretches which tho' they must be the abhorrence of virtuous minds will when laid open as I presume they are in them afford a  proper warning  to those who read them and teach them to  detest men of such profiigate characters    If your reformation be sincere you will not be offended that I except you not on this occasionAnd thus have I helped you to a criterion to try yourself by  By this letter of the wicked man it is apparent that  there are still wickeder women But see what a guilty commerce with the devils of your sex will bring those to whose morals ye have ruinedFor these women were once innocent It was  man  that made them otherwise The first bad man perhaps threw them upon worse men Those upon still worse till they commenced devils incarnateThe height of wickedness or of shame is not arrived at all at once as I have somewhere heard observed  But this man this monster rather for  him  to curse these women and to curse the dear creature's family implacable as the latter were in order to lighten a burden he voluntarily took up and groans under is  meanness  added to  wickedness  And in vain will he one day find his low plea of sharing with her friends and with those common wretches a guilt which will be adjudged him as all his own tho' they too may meet with their punishment As it is evidently begun in the first in their ineffectual reproaches of one another in the second as you have told me  This letter of the abandoned wretch I have not shewn to anybody not even to Mr Hickman For Sir I must tell you I do not as  yet  think it the same thing as only seeing it myself  Mr Hickman like the rest of his sex would grow upon indulgence One distinction from me would make him pay two to himself Insolent creepers or incroachers all of you To shew any of you a  favour  today you would expect it as a  right  tomorrow  I am as you see very open and sincere with you and design in another letter to be still more so in answer to your call and Colonel Morden's call upon me in a point that concerns me to explain myself upon to my beloved creature's Executor and to her  only tender  and  only worthy  relation  I cannot but highly applaud Colonel Morden for his generosity to Miss Dolly Hervey  O that he had arrived time enough to save my inimitable friend from the machinations of the vilest of men and from the envy and malice of the most selfish and implacable of brothers and sisters  ANNA HOWE  LETTER XCIX Miss  HOWE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Monday Oct    WHEN you question me Sir as you do and on a subject so affecting to me in the character of the representative of my bestbeloved friend and have in every particular hitherto acted up to that character you are intitled to my regard Especially as in your questioning of me you are joined by a gentleman whom I look upon as the dearest and nearest because worthiest relation of my dear friend And who it seems has been so severe a censurer of my conduct that your politeness will not permit you to send me his letter with others of his but a copy only in which the passages reflecting upon me are omitted  I presume however that what is meant by this alarming freedom of the Colonel's is no more than what you both have already hinted to me as if you thought I were not inclined to pay so much regard to my beloved creatures last Will in my own case as I would have others pay to it A charge that I ought not to be quite silent under  You have observed no doubt that I have seemed to value myself upon the freedom I take in declaring my sentiments without reserve upon every subject that I pretend to touch upon And I can hardly question that I have or shall in your opinion by my unceremonious treatment of you upon so short an acquaintance run into the error of those who wanting to be thought above hypocrisy and flattery fall into rusticity if not illmanners a common fault with such who not caring to correct constitutional failings seek to gloss them over by some  nominal  virtue when all the time perhaps it is native arrogance or at least a contracted rust that they will not because it would give them pain submit to have filed off  You see Sir that I can however be as free with myself as with you And by what I am going to write you will find me still more free And yet I am aware that such of my sex as will not assume some little dignity and  exact respect from yours will render themselves cheap and perhaps for their modesty and diffidence be repaid with scorn and insult  But the scorn I will endeavour not to deserve and the insult I will not bear  In some of the dear creature's papers which you have had in your possession and must again have for transcription you will find several friendly but severe reprehensions of me on account of a natural or at least an  habitual  warmth of temper which she was pleased to impute to me  I was thinking to give you her charge against me in her own words from one of her letters delivered to  me  with her own hands on taking leave of me on the last visit she honoured me with But I will supply that charge by confession of more than it imports to wit  'That I am haughty uncontroulable and violent in my temper'  This I say  'Impatient of contradiction'  was my beloved's charge  from anybody but her dear self she should have said  'and aim not at that affability that gentleness next to meekness which in the letter I was going to communicate she tells me are the peculiar and indispensable characteristics of a real fine lady who she is pleased to say should appear to be gallless as a dove and never should know what warmth or high spirit is but in the cause of Religion or Virtue or in cases where her own honour the honour of a friend or that of an innocent person is concerned'  Now Sir as I must needs plead guilty to this indictment do you think I ought not to resolve upon a Single LifeI who have such an opinion of your sex that I think there is not one man in an hundred whom a woman of sense and spirit can either  honour  or  obey  tho' you make us promise  both  in that solemn form of words which unites or rather  binds  us to you in marriage  When I look round upon all the married people of my acquaintance and see how  they  live and what  they  bear who live  best  I am confirmed in my dislike to the State  Well do your sex contrive to bring us up fools and idiots in order to make us bear the yoke you lay upon our  shoulders and that we may not despise you from our hearts as we certainly should if we were brought up as you are for your ignorance as much as you often make us do as it is for your insolence  These Sir are some of my notions And with these notions let me repeat my question  Do you think I ought to marry at all  If I marry either a sordid or an imperious wretch can I do you think live with him And ought a man of a contrary character for the sake of either of our reputations to be plagued with me  Long did I stand out against all the offers made me and against all the persuasions of my mother and to tell you the truth the  longer  and with the  more  obstinacy as the person my choice would have at first fallen upon was neither approved by my mother nor by my dear friend This riveted me to my pride and to my opposition For altho' I was convinced after a while that my choice would neither have been prudent nor happy and that the specious wretch was not what he had made me believe he was yet could I not easily think of any other man And indeed from the detection of him took a settled aversion to the whole sex  At last Mr Hickman offered himself a man worthy of a better choice He had the good fortune he thinks it so to be agreeable and to make his proposals agreeable to my mother  As to myself I own that were I to have chosen a Brother Mr Hickman should have been the man virtuous sober sincere friendly as he is But I wished not to marry Nor knew I the man in the world whom I could think deserving of my beloved friend But neither of our parents would let us live single  The accursed Lovelace was proposed warmly to  her  at one time and while she was yet but indifferent to him they by ungenerous usage of him for then Sir he was not known to be Beelzebub himself and by endeavouring to force her inclinations in favour first of one worthless man then of another in antipathy to him thro' her foolish brother's caprice turned that indifference from the  natural generosity of her soul into a regard which she never otherwise would have had for a man of his character  Mr Hickman was proposed to me I refused him again and again He persisted My mother his advocate My mother made my beloved friend his advocate too I told him my aversion to all men To him To matrimonyStill he persisted I used him with tyranny Led indeed partly by my temper partly by design hoping thereby to get rid of him till the poor man his character unexceptionably uniform still persisting made himself a merit with me by his patience This brought down my pride I never Sir was accounted very ungenerous nor quite ingrateful and gave me at one time an inferiority in my own opinion to him which lasted just long enough for my friends to prevail upon me to promise him encouragement and to receive his addresses  Having so done when the weatherglass of my pride got up again I found I had gone too far to recede My mother and my friend both held me to it Yet I tried him I vexed him an hundred ways and not so much neither with design to vex him as to make him hate me and decline his suit  He bore this however and got nothing but my pity Yet still my mother and my friend having obtained my promise made however not to  him  but to  them  and being well assured that I valued no man  more  than Mr Hickman who never once disobliged me in word or deed or look except by his foolish perseverance insisted upon the performance  While my dear friend was in her unhappy uncertainty I could not think of marriage And now what encouragement have IShe my monitress my guide my counsel gone for ever goneBy whose advice and instructions I hoped to acquit myself tolerably in the State into which I could not avoid entering For Sir my mother is so partially Mr Hickman's friend that I am sure should any difference arise she would always censure me and acquit him even were he ungenerous enough to remember me in his day  This Sir being my situation consider how difficult it  is for me to think of marriage Whenever we approve we can find an hundred good reasons to justify our approbation Whenever we dislike we can find a thousand to justify our dislike Everything in the latter case is an impediment Every shadow a bugbearThus can I enumerate and swell perhaps only  imaginary  grievances  'I must go whither he would have me to go Visit whom he would have me to visit Well as I love to write tho' now alas my grand inducement to write is over it must be to whom he pleases'  And Mrs Hickman who as Miss Howe cannot do wrong would hardly ever be able to do right Thus the tables turned upon me I am reminded of my brokenvowed obedience Madam'd up perhaps to matrimonial perfection and all the wedded warfare practised comfortably over between us for I shall not be passive under insolent treatment till we become curses to each other a byeword to our neighbours and the jest of our own servants  But there must be  hear  and  forbear  methinks some wise body will tell me But why must I be teazed into a State where that  must  be necessarily the case when now I can do as I please and wish only to be let alone to do as best pleases me And what in effect does my mother say  'Anna Howe you now do everything that pleases you You now have nobody to controul you You go and you come you dress and you undress you rise and you go to rest just as you think best But you must be happier still child'  As how Madam  'Why you must marry my dear and have none of these options but in everything do as your husband commands you'  This is very hard you will own Sir for such a one as me to think of And yet engaged to enter into that State as I am how can I help myself My mother presses me my friend my beloved friend writing as from the dead presses me and you and Mr Morden as Executors of her Will remind me the man is not afraid of me I am sure were I  the  man I should not have half his courage and I think I ought to conclude to punish him the only effectual way I have to do it for his perverse adherence and persecution as many other persons are punished with the grant of his own wishes  Let me then assure you Sir that when I can find in the words of my charming friend in her Will writing of her cousin Hervey that my grief for her is  mellowed by time into a remembrance more sweet than painful  that I may not be utterly unworthy of the passion a man of some merit has for me I will answer the request of my dear friend so often repeated and so earnestly pressed and Mr Hickman shall find if he continue to deserve my gratitude that my endeavours shall not be wanting to make him amends for the patience he has had and must still for a little while longer have with me And then will it be his own fault I hope not mine if our marriage answer not those happy  prognostics which filled her  generous  presaging mind  upon this view as she once for  my  encouragement and to induce me to encourage  him  told me  Thus Sir have I in a very free manner accounted to you as to the Executor of my beloved friend for all that relates to you as such to know and even for more than I needed to do against myself Only that you will find as much against me in some of  her  letters and so  losing  nothing I  gain  the character of  ingenuity  with you  And thus much for the double reprimand on my delaying my part of the performance of my dear friend's Will  And now let me remind you of one great article relateing to yourself while you are admonishing me on this subject It is furnished me by her posthumous letter to youI hope you will not forget that the most benevolent of her sex expresses herself as earnestly concerned for your thorough reformation as she does for my marrying You'll see to it then that her wishes are as completely answered in that particular as you are desirous they should be in all others  I have I own disobeyed the dear creature in one article and that is where she desires that I will not put myself into mourning I could not help it  I send this and mine of Saturday last together And will not add another word after I have told you that I think myself  Your obliged Servant  A HOWE  LETTER C Mr  BELFORD  To Miss  HOWE    Thursday night Oct    I Return you Madam my most respectful thanks for your condescending hint in relation to the pious wishes of your exalted friend for my thorough reformation  I will only say that it shall be my earnest and unwearied endeavour to make those generous wishes effectual And I hope for the Divine blessing upon such my endeavours or else I know they will be in vain  I cannot Madam express how much I think myself obliged to you for your further condescension in writing to me so frankly the state of your past and present mind in relation to the Single and Matrimonial Life If the lady by whom as the Executor of her inimitable friend I am thus honoured  has  sailings never were failings so lovely in womanHow much more lovely indeed than the virtues of many of her sex  I might have ventured into the hands of such a lady the Colonel's letter without transcription or omission That worthy gentleman exceedingly admires you and his caution was the effect of his politeness only and of his regard for you  I send you Madam a letter from Lord M to myself and the copies of three others written in consequence of that These will acquaint you with Mr Lovelace's departure from England and with other particulars which you will be curious to know  Be pleased to keep to yourself such of the contents as your own prudence will suggest to you ought not to be seen by anybody else  I am Madam with the profoundest and most grateful respect  Your faithful and obliged humble Servant  JOHN BELFORD  LETTER CI Lord  M  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  M Hall  Friday Sept    Dear Sir  MY kinsman Lovelace is now setting out for London proposing to see you and then to go to Dover and so embark God send him well out of the kingdom  On Monday he will be with you I believe Pray let me be favoured with an account of all your conversations for Mr Mowbray and Mr Tourville are to be there too and whether you think he is grown quite his own man again What I mostly write for is to wish you to keep Colonel Morden and him asunder and so to give you notice of his going to town I should be very loth thee should be any mischief between them as you gave me notice that the Colonel threatened my nephew But my kinsman would not bear that so nobody let him know that he did But I hope there is no fear For the Colonel does not as I hear threaten now For his own sake I am glad of that for there is not such a man in the world as my kinsman is said to be at all the weaponsAs well he was not he would not be so daring  We shall all here miss the wild fellow To be sure there is no man better company when he pleases  Pray do you never travel thirty or forty mile I should be glad to see you here at M Hall It will be charity when my kinsman is gone for we suppose you will be his chief correspondent Altho' he has promised to write to my nieces often But he is very apt to forget his promises To us his relations particularly God preserve us all Amen prays  Your very humble Servant  M  LETTER CII Mr  BELFORD  To Lord  M  London  Tuesday night Oct    My Lord  I Obey your Lordship's commands with great pleasure  Yesterday in the afternoon Mr Lovelace made me a visit at my lodgings As I was in expectation of one  from Colonel Morden about the same time I thought proper to carry him to a tavern which neither of us frequented on pretence of an halfappointment ordering notice to be sent me thither if the Colonel came And Mr Lovelace sent to Mowbray and Tourville and Mr Doleman of Uxbri  ge who came to town to take leave of him to let them know where to find us  Mr Lovelace is  too well  recovered I was going to say I never saw him more gay lively and handsome We had a good deal of bluster about some parts of the Trust I have engaged in and upon freedoms I had treated him with in which he would have it that I had exceeded our agreed on limits But on the arrival of our three old companions and a nephew of Mr Doleman's who had a good while been desirous to pass an hour with Mr Lovelace it blew off for the present  Mr Mowbray and Mr Tourville had also taken some exceptions at the freedoms of my pen and Mr Lovelace after his way took upon him to reconcile us and did it at the expence of all three and with such an infinite run of humour and raillery that we had nothing to do but laugh at what he said and at one another I can deal tolerably with him at my pen but in conversation he has no equal In short it was his day He was glad he said to find himself alive and his two friends clapping and rubbing their hands twenty times in an hour declared that now once more he was all himself the charmingst fellow in the world and they would follow him to the furthest part of the globe  I threw a bur upon his coat nowand then but none would stick  Your Lordship knows that there are many things which occasion a roar of applause in conversation when the heart is  open  and men are  resolved  to be merry which will neither bear repeating nor thinking of afterwards Common things in the mouth of a man we admire and whose wit has passed upon us for sterling become in a gay hour  uncommon  We watch every turn of such a one's countenance and are resolved to laugh when he smiles even before he utters what we are expecting to flow from his lips  Mr Doleman and his nephew took leave of us by Twelve Mowbray and Tourville grew very noisy by One and were carried off by Two Wine never moves Mr Lovelace notwithstanding a vivacity which generally helps on overgay spirits As to myself the little part I had taken in their gaiety kept me unconcerned  The clock struck Three before I could get him into any serious or attentive waySo natural to him is gaiety of heart and such strong hold had the liveliness of the evening taken of him His conversation you know my Lord when his heart is free runs off to the bottom without any dregs  But after that hour and when we thought of parting he became a little more serious And then he told me his designs and gave me a plan of his intended tour wishing heartily that I could have accompanied him  We parted about Four he not a little dissatisfied with me for we had some talk about subjects which he said he loved not to think of to wit Miss Harlowe's Will my Executorship papers I had in confidence communicated to that admirable lady with no unfriendly design I assure your Lordship and he insisting upon and I refusing the return of the letters he had written to me from the time that he had made his first addresses to her  He would see me once again he said and it would be upon very ill terms if I complied not with his request Which I bid him not expect But that I might not deny him everything I told him that I would give him a copy of the Will tho' I was sure I said when he read it he would wish he had never seen it  I had a message from him about Eleven this morning desiring me to name a place at which to dine with Him and Mowbray and Tourville for the last time And soon after another from Colonel Morden inviting me to pass the evening with him at the BedfordHead in CoventGarden And that I might keep them at distance from one another I appointed Mr Lovelace at the Eagle in SuffolkStreet  There I met him and the two others We began where we left off at our last parting and were very high with each other But at last all was made up and he  offered to forget and forgive everything on condition that I would correspond with him while abroad and continue the series which had been broken thro' by his illness and particularly give him as I had offered a copy of the Lady's Will  I promised him And he then fell to raillying me on my gravity and on my Reformationschemes as he called them As we walked about the room expecting dinner to be brought in he laid his hand upon my shoulder then pushed me from him with a curse walking round me and surveying me from head to foot then calling for the observation of the others he turned round upon his heel and with one of his peculiar wild airs Ha ha ha ha burst he out that these sourfaced proselytes should take it into their heads that they cannot be pious without forfeiting both their goodnature and good mannersWhy Jack turning me about pr'y thee look up manDost thou not know that Religion if it has taken proper hold of the heart is the most chearful  countenancemaker  in the worldI have heard my beloved Miss Harlowe say so And she knew or nobody did And was not  her  aspect a benign proof of the observation But by these wamblings in thy cursed gizzard and thy aukward grimaces I see thou'rt but a novice in it yetAh Belford Belford thou hast a confounded parcel of briars and thorns to trample over barefoot before Religion will illumine these gloomy features  I give your Lordship this account in answer to your desire to know if I think him the man he was  In our conversation at dinner he was balancing whether he should set out the next morning or the morning after But finding he had nothing to do and Colonel Morden being in town which however I told him not of I turned the scale and he agreed upon setting out tomorrow morning they to see him imbark and I promised to accompany them for a morning's ride as they proposed their horses but said that I must return in the afternoon  With much reluctance they let me go to my evening's appointment They little thought with whom For Mr Lovelace had put it as a case of honour to all of us whether  as he had been told that Mr Morden and Mr James Harlowe had thrown out menaces against him he ought to leave the kingdom till he had thrown himself in their way  Mowbray gave his opinion that he ought to leave it like a man of honour as he was and if he did not take those gentlemen to task for their opprobrious speeches that at least he should be seen by them in public before he went away else they might give themselves airs as if he had left the kingdom in fear of them  To this he himself so much inclined that it was with difficulty I persuaded him that as they had neither of them proceeded to a direct and formal challenge as they knew he had not made himself difficult of access and as he had already done the family injury enough and it was Miss Harlowe's earnest desire that be would be content with that he had no reason from any point of honour to delay his journey especially as he had so just a motive for his going as the establishing of his health and as he might return the sooner if he saw occasion for it  I found the Colonel in a very solemn way We had a good deal of discourse upon the subject of letters which had passed between us in relation to Miss Harlowe's Will and to her family  He has some accounts to settle with his banker which he says will be adjusted tomorrow and on Thursday he proposes to go down again to take leave of his friends and then intends to set out directly for Italy  I wish Mr Lovelace could have been prevailed upon to take any other tour than that of France and Italy I did propose Madrid to him But he laugh'd at me and told me that the proposal was in character from a Mule and from one who was become as grave as a Spaniard of the old cut at ninety  I expressed to the Colonel my apprehensions that his cousin's dying injunctions would not have the force upon him that were to be wished  They have great force upon me Mr Belford said he or one world would not have held Mr Lovelace and me thus long But my intention is to go to Florence not to lay my bones there as upon my cousin's death I told you I thought to do but to settle all my affairs in those  parts and then to come over and reside upon a little paternal estate in Kent which is strangely gone to ruin in my absence Indeed were I to meet Mr Lovelace either here or abroad I might not be answerable for the consequence  He would have engaged me for tomorrow But having promised to attend Mr Lovelace on his journey as I have mentioned I said I was obliged to go out of town and was uncertain as to the time of my return in the evening And so I am to see him on Thursday morning at my own lodgings  I will do myself the honour to write again to your Lordship tomorrow night Mean time I am my Lord  Your Lordship's c  LETTER CIII Mr  BELFORD  To Lord  M  Wedn night Oct    My Lord  I Am just returned from attending Mr Lovelace as far as Gad'sHill near Rochester He was exceeding gay all the way Mowbray and Tourville are gone on with him They will see him embark and under sail and promise to follow him in a month or two for they say there is no living without him now he is once more himself  He and I parted with great and even solemn tokens of affection but yet not without gay intermixtures as I will acquaint your Lordship  Taking me aside and clasping his arms about me  'Adieu dear Belford said he May you proceed in the course you have entered uponWhatever airs I give myself this charming creature has fast hold of me  here  clapping his hand upon his heart and I must either appear what you see me or be what I so lately wasO the divine creature'  lifting up his eyes  'But if I live to come to England and you remain fixed in your present way and can give me encouragement I hope rather to follow your example than to ridicule you for it This Will for I had given him a copy of it I will make the companion of my solitary  hours You have told me part of its melancholy contents and that and her posthumous letter shall be my study and they will prepare me for being your disciple if you hold on  '  You  Jack may marry continued he and I have a wife in my eye for youOnly thou'rt such an aukward mortal'  He saw me affected and thought to make me smile  'But we don't make ourselves except it be worse by our dress Thou art in mourning now as well as I But if ever thy ridiculous turn lead thee again to be Beaubrocade I will  bedizen  thee as the girls say on my return to my own fancy and according to thy own natural appearanceThou shalt doctor my soul and I will doctor thy body Thou shalt see what a clever fellow I will make of thee  'As for  me  I never  will  I never  can  marryThat I will not take a few liberties and that I will not try to start some of my former game I won't promiseHabits are not easily shaken offBut they shall be by way of weaning So  return  and  reform  shall go together  'And now thou sorrowful monkey what aileth thee'  I do love him my Lord  'AdieuAnd once more adieuembracing meAnd when thou thinkest thou hast made thyself an interest  out yonder  looking up then put in a word for thy Lovelace'  Joining company he recommended to me to write often and promised to let me quickly hear from him and that he would write to your Lordship and to all his family round for he said that you had all been more kind to him than he had deserved  And so we parted  I hope my Lord for all your noble family's sake that we shall see him soon return and reform as he promises  I return your Lordship my humble thanks for the honour of your invitation to M Hall The first letter I receive from Mr Lovelace shall give me the opportunity of embracing it I am my Lord  Your most faithful and obedient Servant  J BELFORD  LETTER CIV Mr  BELFORD  To Lord  M  Thursday morning Oct    IT may be some satisfaction to your Lordship to have a brief account of what has just now passed between Colonel Morden and me  We had a good deal of discourse about the Harlowefamily and those parts of the Lady's Will which still remain unexecuted after which the Colonel addressed himself to me in a manner which gave me some surprize  He flattered himself he said from my present happy turn and from my good constitution that I should live a great many years It was therefore his request that I would consent to be  his  Executor since it was impossible for him to make a better choice or pursue a better example than his cousin had set  His heart he said was in it There were some things in his cousin's Will and  his  analogous and he had named one person with me with whom he was sure I would not refuse to be joined and to whom he intended to apply for his consent when he had obtained mine  What is between cretchets thus Mr Belford omitted in the transcription of this Letter to Miss Howe  Intimating as far as I could gather that it was Mr Hickman son of Sir Charles Hickman to whom I know your Lordship is not a stranger For he said Every one who was dear to his beloved cousin must be so to him and he knew that the gentleman whom he had thoughts of would have besides my advice and assistance the advice of one of the most sensible ladies in England  He took my hand seeing me under some surprize You must not hesitate much less deny me Mr Belford Indeed you must not Two things I will assure you of That I have as I hope made everything so clear that you cannot have any litigation And that I have done so justly and I hope it will be thought so generously by all my relations that a mind like yours will rather have pleasure than pain in the Execution of this Trust And this is  what I think every honest man who hopes to find an honest man for his Executor should do  I told him that I was greatly obliged to him for his good opinion of me That it was so much every man's  duty  to be an honest man that it could not be selfpraise to say that I had no doubt to be found so But if I accepted of this Trust it must be on condition  I could name no condition he said interrupting me which he would refuse to comply with  This condition I told him was that as there was as great a probability of his being  my  survivor as I  his  he would permit me to name  him  for mine and in that case a week should not pass before I made my Will  With all his heart he said and the readier as he had no apprehensions of suddenly dying for what he had done and requested was really the effect of the satisfaction he had taken in the part I had already acted as his cousin's Executor and in my ability he was pleased to add As well as in pursuance of his cousin's advice in the Preamble to her Will to wit  'That this was a work which should be set about in full health both of body and mind'  I told him that I was pleased to hear him say that he was not in any apprehension of suddenly dying as this gave me assurance that he had laid aside all thoughts of acting contrary to his beloved cousin's dying request  Does it argue said he smiling that if I were to pursue a vengeance so justifiable in my own opinion I must be in apprehension of falling by Mr Lovelace's handI will assure you that I have no fears of that sortBut I know this is an ingrateful subject to you Mr Lovelace is your friend and I will allow that a  good  man may have a friendship for a  bad one  so far as to wish him well without countenancing him in his evil  I will assure you added he that I have not yet made any resolutions either way I have told you what force my cousin's repeated requests have with me Hitherto they have withheld meBut let us quit this subject  This Sir giving me a sealedup parcel is my Will It is witnessed I made no doubt of prevailing upon you to do me the requested favour I have a duplicate to leave with the other gentleman and an attested copy which I  shall deposit at my banker's At my return which will be in six or eight months at farthest I will allow you to make an exchange of yours if you will have it so I have only now to take leave of my relations in the country And so God protect you Mr Belford You will soon hear of me again  He then very solemnly embraced me as I did him And we parted  I heartily congratulate with your Lordship on the narrow escape each gentleman has had from the other For I apprehend that they could not have met without fatal consequences  Time I hope which subdues all things will subdue their resentments I am my Lord  Your Lordship's most faithful and obedient Servant  J BELFORD  Several other Letters passed between Miss Howe and Mr Belford relating to the disposition of the Papers and Letters to the Poor's Fund and to other articles of the Lady's Will Wherein the method of proceeding in each case was adjusted After which the Papers were returned to Mr Belford that he might order the two directed copies of them to be taken  In one of these letters Mr Belford requests Miss Howe to give the Character of the friend she so dearly loved  'A task he imagines that will be as agreeable to herself as worthy of her pen'  'I am more especially curious to know  says he  what was that particular disposition of her time which I find mentioned in a letter which I have just dipt into where her sister is enviously reproaching her on that score  See Vol  I  p    This information may perhaps enable me  says he  to account for what has often surprised me How at so tender an age this admirable lady became mistress of such extraordinary and such various qualifications'  This request produced the following Letter  LETTER CV Miss  HOWE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Thursday October    SIR  I Am incapable of doing justice to the character of my beloved friend and that not only from want of talents but from grief which I think rather increases than diminishes by time and which will not let me sit down to a task that requires so much thought and a greater degree of accuracy than I ever believed myself mistress of  And yet I so well approve of your motion that I will throw into your hands a few materials that may serve by way of supplement as I may say to those you will be able to collect from the papers themselves from Col Morden's letters to you particularly that of Sept  See Letter  xcv  and from the letters of the detestable wretch himself who I find  done her justice altho' to his own condemnation All these together will enable  you  who seem to be so great an admirer of her virtues to perform the task and I think better than any person I know But I make it my request that if you do anything in this way you will let me see itIf I find it not to my mind I will add or diminish as justice shall require  She was a wonderful creature from her  infancy  But I suppose you intend to give a character of her at those years when she was qualified to be an example to other young ladies rather than a history of her life  Perhaps nevertheless you will choose to give a description of her person And as you knew not the dear creature when her heart was easy I will tell you what yet in part you can confirm  That her shape was so fine her proportion so exact her features so regular her complexion so lovely and her whole person and manner was so distinguishedly charming that she could not move without being admired and followed by the eyes of every one tho' strangers who never saw her before Col Morden's letter above referred to will confirm this  In her dress she was elegant beyond imitation  Her stature rather tall than middling In her whole aspect and air a dignity that bespoke the mind that animated all  This  native  dignity as I may call it induced some superficial persons who knew not how to account for the reverence which involuntarily filled their hearts on her appearance to impute pride to her But she knew not what pride in the bad sense of the word was  You may throw in these sentences of hers if you touch upon this subject  'Persons of accidental or shadowy merit may be proud But inborn worth must be always as much above conceit as arrogance'  'Who can be better or more worthy than they should be And Who shall be proud of talents they give not to themselves'  'The darkest and most contemptible ignorance is that of not knowing one's self and that all we have and all we excel in is the gift of God'  'All human excellence is but comparativeThere are persons who excel us as much as we fancy we excel the meanest'  'In the general scale of beings the lowest is as useful and as much a link of the great chain as the highest'  'The excellence that makes every other excellence amiable is HUMILITY'  'There is but one Pride pardonable That of being above doing a base or dishonourable action'  Such were the sentiments by which this admirable young lady endeavoured to conduct herself and to regulate her conduct to others  And in truth never were affability and complacency graciousness some have called it more eminent in any person man or woman than in her to those who put it in her power to oblige them Insomuch that the benefited has sometimes not known which to prefer the grace bestowed or the manner in which it was conferred  It has been observed that what was said of Henry IV of France might be said of her manner of refusing a request That she generally sent from her presence the person refused nearly as well satisfied as if she had granted it  Then she was so nobly sincereYou cannot Sir expatiate too much upon her sincerity I dare say that in all her letters in all the wretch's letters her sincerity will not be found to be once impeachable altho' her calamities were so heavy the horrid wretch's wiles so subtle and her struggles to free herself from them so active  Severe as she always was in her reprehensions of a wilful and studied vileness yet no one accused her judgment or thought her severe in a wrong place For her charity was so great that she always chose to defend or acquit where the fault was not so flagrant that it became a piece of justice to condemn it  You must everywhere insist upon it that had it not been for the stupid persecutions of her relations she never would have been in the power of this horrid profligate And yet she was frank enough to acknowlege that were  person  and  address  and  alliance  to be allowably the  principal  attractives it would not have been difficult for her eye to mislead her heart  When she was last with me three happy weeks together in every visit he made her he left her more dissatisfied with him than before  In obedience to her friends commands on her coming to me she never would see him out of my company and would often say when he was gone  Sec Vol  I  p      'O my Nancy This is not THE man'  At other times  'Gay giddy creature he has always something to be forgiven for'  At others  'This man will much sooner excite one's Fears than attract one's Love'  And then would she repeat  'This is not THE manAll that the world says of him cannot be untrueBut what title have I to charge him who intend not to have him'  In short had she been left to a judgment and discretion which nobody ever questioned who had  either  she would have discovered enough of him to make her discard him for ever  Her ingenuity in acknowleging any error she was drawn into yon must also insist upon  'Next to not erring she used to say was the owning of an error And that the offering at an excuse in a blameable matter was the undoubted mark of a disingenuous or perverse mind'  Yet one of her expressions upon a like subject deserves to be remembred Being upbraided by a severe censurer upon a person's proving base whom she had frequently defended  'You had more penetration Madam than such a young creature as I can pretend to have But altho' human depravity may I doubt oftener justify the person who judges harshly than them who judge favourably yet will I not part with my charity altho' for the future I will endeavour to make it consistent with caution and prudence'  If you mention the beauties and graces of her pen you may take notice that it was always matter of surprize to her that the Sex are generally so averse as they are to writeing since the Pen next to the Needle of all employments is the most proper and best adapted to their genius's and this as well for improvement as amusement  'Who sees not would she say that those women who take delight in writing excel the men in all the graces of the familiar style The gentleness of their minds the delicacy of their sentiments improved by the manner of their Education and the liveliness of their imaginations qualify them to a high degree of preference for this employment While men of learning as they are called of mere learning however aiming to get above that natural ease and freedom which distinguish This and indeed every other kind of writing when they think they have best succeeded are got above or rather  beneath  all natural beauty'  And one hint you may give to the Sex if you please who are generally too careless in their orthography a consciousness of a defect in which generally keeps them from writingShe used to say  'It was a proof that a woman understood the derivation and sense of the words she used and that she stopt not at  sound  when she spelt accurately'  You may take notice of the admirable facility she had in learning languages That she read with great ease both Italian and French and could hold a conversation in either tho' she was not fond of doing so And that she was  not  be pleased to call it a fault That she had begun to apply herself to Latin  But that notwithstanding all her acquirements she was an excellent OECONOMIST and HOUSEWIFE And these qualifications you must take notice she was particularly fond of inculcating upon all her reading and writing companions of the Sex For it was a maxim with her  'That a woman who neglects the  Useful  and the  Elegant  which distinguish  her own Sex  for the sake of obtaining the learning which is supposed more peculiar to the  other  incurs more  contempt  by what she  foregoes  than she gains  credit  by what she  acquires  '  'Let our Sex therefore she used to say seek to make themselves mistresses of all that is excellent and not incongruous to their Sex in the  other  but without losing anything commendable in  their own  '  Perhaps you will not think it amiss further to observe on this head as it will shew that precept and example always went hand in hand with her That her Dairy at her grandfather's was the delight of every one who saw it and She of all who saw her in it For in the same hour whenever she pleased she was the most elegant dairymaid that ever was seen or the finest lady that ever graced a circle  Yet was this admirable creature mistress of all these domestic qualifications without the least intermixture of Narrowness She used to say  'That to define true generosity it must be called The happy medium between parsimony and profusion'  She was as much above Reserve as Disguise So communicative that no young lady could be in her company half an hour and not carry away instruction with her whatever was the topic Yet all sweetly insinuated nothing given with the air of prescription So that while she seemed to ask a question for informationsake she dropt in the needful instruction and lest the instructed unable to decide whether the thought which being started she the instructed could improve came primarily from herself or from the sweet instructress  The Goths and Vandals in those branches of science which she aimed at acquiring she knew how to dete  expose and all from Na  ure  Propriety  another woid for  Nature  was her Law  is the foundation of all true judgment  Her skill in Needleworks you will find mentioned perhaps in some of the letters That piece which she bequeaths to her cousin Morden is indeed a capital piece a performance so admirable that that gentleman's father who resided chiefly abroad was as is mentioned in her Will very desirous to obtain it in order to carry it to Italy with him to shew the curious of  other  countries as he used to say for the honour of  his own  that the cloister'd confinement was not necessary to make English women excel in any of those fine Arts which Nuns and Recluses value themselves upon  Her quickness at these sort of works was astonishing and a great encouragement to herself to prosecute them  Mr Morden's father would have been continually making her presents would she have permitted him And he used to call them and so did her grandfather tributes due to a merit so sovereign and not presents  I say nothing of her skill in Music and of her charming Voice when it accompanied her fingers tho' very extraordinary because she had her equals in both  If she could not avoid Cards without incurring the censure of particularity she would play but then she always declared against playing high  'Except for trifles she used to say she would not submit to  Chance  what she was already sure of'  At Other times  'She should make her friends a very ill compliment if she supposed they would wish to be possessed of what of right belonged to her and she should be very unworthy if she desired to make herself a title to what was theirs'  'High gaming in short she used to say was a sordid vice an immorality the child of avarice and a direct breach of that commandment which forbids us to covet what is our neighbour's'  You will have occasion to mention her Charities Her Will gives you hints of the peculiar nature of those Indeed for the prudent distribution of them she had neither example nor equal  You may if you desire to be particular in the account of them consult Mrs Norton upon this subject and when I see what she will furnish I shall perhaps make an addition to it  In all her Readings and in her Conversations upon them she was fonder of finding beauties than blemishes Yet she used to lament that certain writers of the first class who were capable of exalting virtue and of putting vice out of countenance too generally employed themselves in works of imagination only upon subjects merely speculative disinteresting and unedifying from which no good moral or example could be drawn  All she said and all she did was accompanied with a natural ease and dignity which set her above affectation or the suspicion of it For with all her excellencies she was forwarder to  hear  than  speak  and hence no doubt derived no small part of her improvement  You are curious to know the particular distribution of her Time which you suppose will help you to account for what you own yourself surprised at to wit how so young a Lady could make herself mistress of so many accomplishments  I will premise that she was from infancy inured to rise early in a morning by an excellent and as I may say a learned woman Mrs Norton to whose care wisdom and example she was beholden for the groundwork of her taste and acquirements which meeting with such a genius made it the less wonder that she surpassed most of her Age and Sex  She used to say  'It was incredible to think what might be done by early rising and by long days well filled up'  It may be added That had she calculated according to the practice of  too many  she had actually lived more years at  Sixteen  than  they  had at  Twentysix    She used to say  'That no one could spend their time properly who did not live by some Rule Who did not appropriate the hours as near as might be to particular purposes and employments'  In conformity to this selfset Lesson the usual distribution of the twentyfour hours when left to her own choice was as follows  For REST she allotted SIX hours only  She thought herself not so well and so clear in her intellects so  much alive  she used to say if she exceeded  this proportion If she slept not she chose to rise sooner And in winter had her fire laid and a taper ready burning to light it not loving to give trouble to servants  'whose harder work and later hours of going to bed she used to say required consideration'  I have blamed her for her greater regard to them than to herself But this was her answer  'I have my choice Who can wish for more Why should I oppress others to gratify myself You see what freewill enables one to do while imposition would make a light burden heavy'  Her First THREE Morning Hours  Were generally passed in her Study and in her Closetduties And were occasionally augmented by those she saved from Rest And in these passed her epistolary amusements  TWO Hours she generally allotted to Domestic Management  These at different times of the day as occasions required all the housekeeper's bills in ease of her mother passing thro' her hands For she was a perfect mistress of the four principal rules of arithmetic  FIVE Hours to her Needle Drawings Music  c  In these she included the assistance and inspection she gave to her own servants and to her sister's servants in the needleworks required for the family For her sister is a MODERN In these she also included Dr Lewen's conversationvisits with whom likewise she held a correspondence by letters That reverend gentleman delighted himself and her twice or thrice a week if his health permitted with these visits And she always preferred his company to any other engagement  TWO Hours she allotted to her Two first Meals  But if conversation or the desire of friends or the falling in of company or guests required it to be otherwise she never scrupled to oblige and would  borrow  as she called it from other distributions And as she found it very hard not to exceed in this appropriation she put down  ONE Hour mere to Dinnertime Conversation  To be added or subtracted as occasions offered or the desire of her friends required And yet found it difficult as she often said to keep this account even especially if Dr Lewen obliged them with his company at their table Which however he seldom did for being a valetudinarian and in a regimen he generally made his visits in the afternoon  ONE Hour to Visits to the neighbouring Poor  To a select number of whom and to their children she used to give brief instructions and good books And as this happened not every day and seldom above twice a week she had two or three hours at a time to bestow in this benevolent employment  The remaining FOUR Hours  Were occasionally allotted to supper to conversation or to reading after supper to the family This allotment she called  Her Fund  upon which she use to draw to satisfy her other debits And in this she included visits received and returned shews spectacles c which in a countrylife not occurring everyday she used to think a great allowance no less than  two  artificial days in  six  for amusements only And she was wont to say that it was hard if she could not steal time out of such a fund as this for an excursion of even two or three days in a month  If it be said that her relations or the young neighbouring ladies had but little of her time it will be considered that besides these four hours in the twentyfour great part of the time she was employed in her needleworks she used to converse as she worked And it was a custom she had introduced among her acquaintance that the young ladies in their visits used frequently in a neighbourly way in the winter evenings especially to bring their work with them and one of half a dozen of her select acquaintance used by turns to read to the rest as they were at work  This was her usual method when at her own command for  Six  days in the week  The SEVENTH DAY  She kept as it ought to be kept And as some part of it was frequently employed in works of mercy the hour she allotted to visiting the neighbouring poor was occasionally supplied from this day and added to her fund  But I must observe that when in her grandfather's lifetime she was three or four weeks at a time his housekeeper and guest as also at either of her uncles her usual distribution of time was varied But still she had an eye to it as nearly as circumstances would admit  When I had the happiness of having her for my guest for a fortnight or so she likewise dispensed with her rules In her accountbook since her evertobelamented death I have found this memorandum  'From  such a day  to  such a day  all holidays at my dear Miss Howe's'  At  er return'Account resumed  such a day  ' naming it and then she proceeded regularly as before  Once a week she used to reckon with herself when if within the hours contained in the six days she had made her account even she noted it accordingly If otherwise she carried the debit to the next week's account a  thus  Debtor to the article of benevolent visits  so many hours And so of the rest  But it was always an especial part of her care that whether visiting or visited she shewed in all companies an intire ease satisfaction and chearfulness as if she kept no such particular account and as if she did not make herself answerable to herself for her occasional exceedings  This method which to others will appear perplexing and unnecessary her early hours and custom had made easy and pleasant to her  And indeed as I used to tell her greatly as I admired her in all her methods I could not bring myself to this tho' I  had  to early hours and find the benefit of it might I have had the world for my reward  She used to answer  'I do not think ALL I do necessary for another to do Nor even for myself But when it is more pleasant to me to keep such an account than to let it alone why may I not proceed in my supererogatoriesThere can be no harm in it It keeps up  my attention to accounts which one day may be of use to me in more material instances Those who will not keep a  strict  account seldom long keep  any  I neglect not more useful employments for it And it teaches me to be covetous of time the only thing of which we can be  allowably  covetous since we live but once in this world and when gone are gone from it for ever'  O Mr Belford I can write no further on this subject For looking into the accountbook for other particulars I met with a most affecting memorandum which being written on the extreme edge of the paper with a fine pen and in the dear creature's smallest hand I saw not beforeThis it is written I suppose at some calamitous period  after  the day named in itHelp me to a curse to blast the monster who gave occasion for it  'APRIL The account concluded  'And with it all my worldly hopes and prospects'  I TAKE up my pen but not to apologize for my execrationOnce more I pray to God to avenge me of him I  Me  I sayFor mine is the lossHers the gain  O Sir You  did  not you  could  not know her as I knew her Never was such an excellenceSo warm yet so cool a friendSo much what I wish to be but never shall beFor alas my Stay my Adviser my Monitress my Directress is gone for ever gone  She honoured me with the title of  The sister of her heart  But I was only so in the Love I bore her A Love beyond a sister'sinfinitely beyond  her  sister's in the hatred I have to every mean and sordid action and in my Love of VirtueFor otherwise I am of a high and haughty temper as I have acknowleged before and very violent in my passions  In short she was the nearest perfection of any creature I ever knew She never preached to me lessons she practised not She lived the life she taught All humility meekness selfaccusing othersacquitting tho' the shadow of the fault hardly hers the substance theirs whose only honour was their relation to her  To lose such a Friend such a GuideIf ever my violence was justifiable it is upon this recollectionFor  she only lived to make me sensible of my failings but not long enough to enable me to conquer them as I was resolved to endeavour to do  Once more then let me execrateBut now violence and passion again predominateAnd how can it be otherwise  But I force myself from the subject having lost the purpose for which I resumed my pen  A HOWE  LETTER CVI Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Paris  Octob    Timor minae  Scandunt eodem quo dominus neque  Decedit aerata triremi  Post equitem sedet atra cura  IN a language so expressive as the English I hate the pedantry of tagging or prefacing what I write with Latin scraps and ever was a censurer of the mottomongers among our weekly and daily scribblers But these verses of Horace are so applicable to my case that whether on shipboard whether in my postchaise or in my inn at night I am not able to put them out of my head Dryden once I thought said well in these bouncing lines  Man makes his Fate according to his mind  The weak low spirit Fortune makes her slave  But she's a drudge when hector'd by the brave  If Fate weave common thread I'll change the doom  And with new purple weave a nobler loom  And in these  Let Fortune empty her whole quiver on me  I have a soul that like an ample shield  Can take in all and verge enough for more  Fate was not mine Nor am I Fate's  Souls know no conquerors  But in the first quoted lines considering them closely there is nothing but blustering absurdity In the other  the poet says not truth for CONSCIENCE is the Conqueror of Souls At least it is the Conqueror of mine And who ever thought it a narrow one  But this is occasioned partly by poring over the affecting Will and posthumous Letter What an army of texts has she drawn up in array against me in the latterBut yet Jack do they not shew me that two or three thousand years ago there were as wicked fellows as myselfThey doAnd that's some consolation  But the generosity of her mind display'd in both is what stings me most And the more still as it is now out of my power any way in the world to be even with her  I ought to have written to you sooner But I loiter'd two days at Calais for an answer to a letter I wrote to engage my former travelling valet De la Tour an ingenious ready fellow as you have heard me say I  have  engaged him and he is now with me  I shall make no stay here but intend for some of the Electoral courts That of Bavaria I think will engage me longest Perhaps I may step out of my way if I can be out of my way anywhere to those of Dresden and Berlin And it is not impossible that you may have one letter from me at Vienna And then perhaps I may fall down into Italy by the Tirol and so taking Turin in my way return to Paris where I hope to see Mowbray and Tourville Nor do I despair of you  This a good deal differs from the plan I gave you But you may expect to hear from me as I move and whether I shall pursue this route or the other  I have my former lodgings in the Rue St Antoine Which I shall hold notwithstanding my tour So they will be ready to accommodate any two of you if you come hither before my return And for this I have conditioned  I write to Charlotte and that is writing to all my relations at once  Do thou Jack inform me duly of everything that passesParticularly How thou proceedest in thy Reformationscheme How Mowbray and Tourville go on in my absence Whether thou hast any chance for a wife I am the more solicitous on this head because thou seemest to  think that thy Mortification will not be complete nor thy Reformation secure till thou art shackled How the Harlowes proceed in their penitentials If Miss Howe be married or near being so How honest Doleman goes on with his Empiric now he has dismissed his Regulars or they him and if any likelihood of his perfect recovery Be sure be very minute For every trifling occurrence relating to those we value becomes interesting when we are at a distance from them Finally prepare thou to piece thy broken thread if thou wouldst oblige  Thy  LOVELACE  LETTER CVII Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  London  Oct    I Write to shew you that I am incapable of slighting even the minutest requests of an absent and distant friend Yet you may believe that there cannot be any great alterations in the little time that you have been out of England with respect to the subjects of your inquiry Nevertheless I will answer to each for the reason above given and for the reason you mention that even trifles and chitchat are agreeable from friend to friend and of friends and even of those to whom we give the importance of deeming them our  foes    then as to my Reformationscheme as you call it I hope I go on very well I wish you had entered upon the like and could say so too You would then find infinitel  more peace of mind than you are likely ever otherwise to be acquainted with When I look back upon the sweep that has been made among us in the two or three past years and forward upon what may still happen I hardly think myself secure tho' of late I have been guided by other lights than those of sense and appetite which have hurried so many of our confraternity into worldly ruin if not into eternal perdition  I am very earnest in my wishes to be admitted into the  uptial State But I think I ought to pass some time as a probationary till by steadiness in my good resolutions I  convince some woman whom I could love and honour  and whose worthy example might confirm my morals that there is  one  Libertine who had the grace to reform before Age or Disease put it out of his power to sin on  The Harlowes continue inconsoleable and I dare say will to the end of their lives  Miss Howe is not yet married but I have reason to think will soon I have the honour of corresponding with her and the more I know of her the more I admire the nobleness of her mind She must be conscious that she is superior to half  our  Sex and to most of  her own  which may make her give way to a temper naturally hasty and impatient But if she meet with condescension in her man and who would not veil to a superiority so visible if it be not exacted with arrogance I dare say she will make an excellent wife  As to Doleman the poor man goes on trying and hoping with his Empiric I cannot but say that as the latter is a sensible and judicious man and not rash opinionative or oversanguine I have great hopes little as I think of Quacks and Nostrummongers in general that he will do him good if his case will admit of it My reasons are That the man pays a  regular  and  constant  attendance upon him Watches with his own eye every change and new symptom of his patient's malady Varies his applications as the indications vary Fetters not himself to rules laid down by the fathers of the art who lived many hundred years ago when diseases and the causes of them were different as the modes of living were different from what they are now as well as climates and accidents That he is to have his reward not in daily fees but after the first five guineas for medicines in proportion as the patient himself shall find amendment  As to Mowbray and Tourville what novelties can be expected in so short a time from men who have not sense enough to strike o  t or pursue new lights either good or bad Now especially that thou art gone who wert the soul of all enterprize and in particular  their  soul Besides I see them but seldom I suppose they'll be at Paris before you can return from Germany for they cannot live without you And you gave them such a specimen  of your recovered volatility in the last evening's conversation as equally delighted  them  and concerned  me    I wish with all my heart that thou wouldst bend thy course towards the Pyreneans I should then if thou writest to thy cousin Montague an account of what is most observable in thy tour put in for a copy of thy letters I wonder thou wilt not since then thy subjects would be as new to thyself as to  Thy  BELFORD  LETTER CVIII Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Paris  Oct    I Follow my last of the th on occasion of a letter just now come to hand from Joseph Leman The fellow is Conscienceridden Jack and tells me  'That he cannot rest either day or night for the mischiefs which he fears he has been and may still further be the means of doing'  He wishes  'if it please God and if it please  me  that he had never seen my Honour's face'  And what is the cause of his present concern as to his own peculiar what but  'the  slights  and  contempts  which he receives from every one of the Harlowes from those particularly he says whom he has endeavoured to serve as faithfully as his engagements to  me  would let him serve them And I always made him believe he tells me  poor weak soul as he was from his cradle  that serving me was serving both  in the longrun  But this and the death of his dear young lady is a grief he declares that he shall never  claw off  were he to live to the age of  MatthewSalem Althoff  and  howsomever  he is sure that he shall not live  a month to an end  being strangely pined and his stomach nothing like what it was And Mrs Betty being also now she  has got his love  very  cross and slighting  But thank his God for punishing her she is in a poor way  hersell    'But the chief occasion of troubling my Honour now is not his own griefs only  altho  they are very great but to prevent future mischiefs to me For he can assure me that Colonel Morden has set out from them all  with a full resolution to  have his will of me  And he is well assured that he said and swore to it  as how  he was resolved that he would either have my Honour's heart's blood or I should have his or  some suchlike sad threatenings  And that all the family rejoice in it and hope I shall  come short home  '  This is the substance of Joseph's letter and I have one from Mowbray which has a hint to the same effect And I recollect now that thou wert very importunate with me to go to Madrid rather than to France and Italy the last evening we passed together  What I desire of thee is by the first dispatch to let me faithfully know all that thou knowest on this head  I can't bear to be threatened Jack Nor shall any man unquestioned give himself airs in my absence if I know it that shall make me look mean in anybody's eyes That shall give my friends pain for me That shall put them upon wishing me to change my intentions or my plan to avoid him Upon such despicable terms as these thinkest thou that I could bear to live  But why if such were his purpose did he not let me know it before I left England Was he unable to work himself up to a resolution till he knew me to be out of the kingdom  As soon as I can inform myself where to direct to him I will write to know his purpose for I cannot bear suspense in such a case as this That solemn act were it even to be Marriage or Hanging which must be done tomorrow I had rather should be done today My mind tires and sickens with impatience on ruminating upon scenes that can afford neither variety nor certainty To dwell twenty days in expectation of an event that may be decided in a quarter of an hour is grievous  If he come to Paris altho' I should be on my tour he will very easily find out my  lodgings  For I every day see some or other of my countrymen and divers of them have I entertained  here  I go frequently to the Opera and to the Play and appear at Court and at all public places And on my quitting this city will leave a direction whither my letter  from England or elsewhere shall from time to time be forwarded Were I sure that his intention is  what Joseph Leman tells me it is I would stay here or shorten his course to me let him be where he would  I cannot get off my regrets on account of this dear Lady for the blood of me If the Colonel and I are to meet as he has done me no injury and loves the memory of his cousin we shall engage with the same sentiments as to the object of our dispute And that you know is no very common case  In short I am as much convinced that I have done wrong as he can be and regret it as much But I will not bear to be threatened by any man in the world however conscious of having deserved blame  Adieu Belford Be sincere with me No palliation as thou valuest  Thy  LOVELACE  LETTER CIX Mr  BELFORD  To  ROBERT LOVELACE  Esq  London  October    I Cannot think my dear Lovelace that Colonel Morden has either threatened you in those gross terms mentioned by the vile hypocritical and ignorant Joseph Leman or intends to follow you They are the words of people of that fellow's class and not of a gentleman Not of Colonel Morden I am sure You'll observe that Joseph pretends not to say that he heard him speak them  I have been very solicitous to sound the Colonel for your sake and for his own and for the sake of the injunctions of the excellent lady to me as well as to him on that subject He is and you will not wonder that he should be extremely affected and owns that he has expressed himself in terms of resentment on the occasion Once he said to me That had his beloved cousin's case been that of a common seduction and had she been drawn in by what Bishop Barnet calls The Delicacy of Intrigue her own infirmity or credulity contributing to her fall he could have forgiven you But in so many words He assured me that he had not taken any resolutions nor had he declared himself to the family in such a way as should bind him to resent On the contrary he has owned that  his cousin's injunctions have hitherto had the force upon him which I could wish they should have  He went abroad in a week after you When he took his leave of me he told me That his design was to go to Florence and that he would settle his affairs there and then return to England and here pass the remainder of his days  I was indeed apprehensive that if you and he were to meet something unhappy might fall out And as I knew that you proposed to take Italy and very likely Florence in your return to France I was very solicitous to prevail upon you to take the court of Spain into your plan I am still so And if you are not to be prevailed upon to do that let me intreat you to avoid Florence or Leghorn in your return as you have visited both heretofore At least let not the proposal of a meeting come from you  It would be matter of serious reflection to me if the  very fellow  this  Joseph Leman  who gave you such an opportunity to turn all the artillery of his masters against themselves and to play them upon one another to favour your plotting purposes should be the instrument in the devil's hand unwittingly too to avenge them all upon  you  For should you even get the better of the Colonel would the mischief end thereIt would but add remorse to your present remorse since the interview  must  end in death for he would not I am confident take his life at your hand The Harlowes would moreover prosecute you in a legal way You hate  them  and  they  would be gainers by  his  death Rejoicers in yoursAnd have you not done mischief enough already  Let  me  therefore and thro' me all your friends have the satisfaction to hear that you are resolved to avoid this gentleman Time will subdue all things Nobody doubts your bravery Nor will it be known that your plan is changed thro' persuasion  Young Harlowe talks of calling you to account This is a plain evidence that Mr Morden has not taken the quarrel upon himself for their family  I am in no apprehension of anybody but Colonel Morden I know it will not be a means to prevail upon you to oblige me to say that I am well assured that this gentleman is a skilful swordsman and that he is as cool  and sedate as skilful But yet I will add that if I had a value for my life he should be the last man except yourself with whom I would choose to have a contention  I have as you required been very candid and sincere with you I have not aimed at palliation If you seek not Colonel Morden it is my opinion he will not seek you For he is a man of principle But if you seek him I believe he will not shun you  Let me reurge It is the effect of my love for you that you know your own guilt in this affair and should not be again an aggressor It would be pity that so brave a man as the Colonel should drop were you and he to meet And on the other hand it would be dreadful that you should be sent to your account unprepared for it and pursuing a fresh violence Moreover seest thou not in the deaths of two of thy principal agents the handwriting upon the wall against thee  My zeal on this occasion may make me guilty of repetition Indeed I know not how to quit the subject But if what I have written added to your own remorse and consciousness cannot prevail all that I might further urge will be ineffectual  Adieu therefore Mayst thou repent of the past And may no new violences add to thy heavy reflections and overwhelm thy future hopes is the wish of  Thy true Friend  JOHN BELFORD  LETTER CX Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Munich  Nov    I Received yours this moment just as I was setting out for Vienna  As to going to Madrid or one single step out of the way to avoid Colonel Morden let me perish if I doYou cannot think me so mean a wretch  And so you own that he  has  threatened me but not in gross and ungentlemanly terms you say If he has threatened me like a gentleman I will  esent his threats like a gentleman But he has not done as a man of honour  if he has threatened me at all behind my back I would scorn to threaten any man to whom I  knew  how to address myself either personally or by pen and ink  As to what you mention of my guilt of the handwriting on the wall of a legal prosecution if he meet his fate from my hand of his skill coolness courage and suchlike poltroon stuff what can you mean by it Surely you cannot believe that such insinuations as those will weaken either my hands or my heartNo more of this sort of nonsense I beseech you in any of your future letters  He had not taken any resolutions you say when you saw him He  must  and  will  take resolutions one way or other very quickly for I wrote to him yesterday without waiting for this your answer to my last I could not avoid it I could not as I told you in that live in suspense I have directed my letter to Florence Nor could I suffer my friends to live in suspense as to my safety or otherwise But I have couched it in such moderate terms that he has fairly his option He will be the challenger if he take it in the sense in which he may so handsomely avoid taking it And if he does it will demonstrate that malice and revenge were the predominant passions with him and that he was determined but to settle his affairs and then  take his resolutions  as you phrase itYet if we are to meet for I know what  my  ption would be in  his  case on  such a letter  compla  as it is I wish  he  had a worse  I  a better cause It  ld be sweet revenge to him were I to fall by his han  But what should I be the better for killing him  I will inclose the copy of the letter I sent him  ON reperusing yours in a cooler mo  I cannot but thank you for your friendly love and  intentions My value for you from the first hour of  tance till now I have never found misplaced re  ng at least your  intention  Thou must however own a good deal of blunder of the overdo and underdo kind with respect to the part thou actedst between me and the beloved of my heart But thou art really an honest fellow and a sincere and warm friend I could almost wish I had not written to Florence till I had received thy letter now before me But  it is gone Let it go If he wish peace and to avoid violence he will have a fair opportunity to embrace the one and shun the otherIf nothe must take his fate  But be this as it may you may contrive to let young Harlowe know He is a menacer too that I shall be in England in March next at farthest  This of Bavaria is a gallant and polite court Nevertheless being uncertain whether my letter may meet with the Colonel at Florence I shall quit it and set out as I intended for Vienna taking care to have any letter or message from him conveyed to me there Which will soon bring me back hither or to any other place to which I shall be invited  As I write to Charlotte I have nothing more to add after compliments to all friends than that I am  Wholly Yours  LOVELACE  To  WILLIAM MORDEN  Esq  Inclosed in the above  Munich  Nov    SIR  I Have heard with a great deal of surprize that you have thought fit to throw out some menacing expressions against me  I should have been very glad that you had thought I had punishment enough in my own mind for the wrongs I have done to the most excellent of women and that it had been possible for two persons so ardently joining in one love especially as I was desirous to the utmost of my power to repair those wrongs to have lived if not on amicable terms in such a way as not to put either to the pain of hearing of threatenings thrown out in absence which either ought to be despised for if he had not spirit to take notice of them  Now Sir if what I have heard be owing only to warmth of temper or to sudden passion while the loss of all other losses the most deplorable to me was recent I not only excuse but commend you for it But if you are really  determined  to meet me on any other account which I own to you is not however what I wish it would be very blameable and very unworthy of the character I desire to  maintain as well with you as with every other gentleman to give you a difficulty in doing it  Being uncertain when this letter may meet you I shall set out tomorrow for Vienna where any letter directed to the posthouse in that city or to Baron Windisgratz's at the Favorita to whom I have commendations will come to hand  Mean time believing you to be a man too generous to make a wrong construction of what I am going to declare and knowing the value which the dearest of all creatures had for you and your relationship to her I will not scruple to assure you that the most acceptable return will be that Colonel Morden chooses to be upon an amicable rather than upon any other footing with  His sincere Admirer and humble Servant  R LOVELACE  LETTER CXI Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Lintz  Nov    Dec    I Am now on my way to Trent in order to meet Colonel Morden in pursuance of his answer to my letter inclosed in my last I had been at Presburgh and had intended to visit some other cities of Hungary But having obliged myself to return first to Vienna I there met with his letter Which follows  Munich  Nov    Dec    SIR  YOUR letter was at Florence four days before I arrived there  That I might not appear unworthy of your savour I set out for this city the very next morning I knew not but that the politeness of this court might have engaged beyond his intention a gentleman who has only his pleasures to pursue  But being disappointed in my hope of finding you here it becomes me to acquaint you that I have such a desire to stand well in the opinion of a man of your spirit that I cannot hesitate a moment upon the option which I am  sure Mr Lovelace in my situation thus called upon would make  I own Sir that I have on all occasions spoken of your treatment of my everdear cousin as it deserved It would have been very surprising if I had not And it behoves me now you have given me so noble an opportunity of explaining myself to convince you that no words fell from my lips of you merely because you were absent I acquaint you therefore that I will attend your appointment and would were it to the farthest part of the globe  I shall stay some days at this court and if you please to direct for me at M Klienfurt's in this city whether I remain here or not your commands will come safely and speedily to the hands of Sir  Your most humble Servant  WM MORDEN  So you see Belford that the Colonel by his ready his even eagerly expressed acceptance of the offered interview  was determined  And is it not much better to bring such a point as this to an issue than to give pain to friends for my safety or continue in a suspense myself as I must do if I imagined that another had aught against me  This was my reply  Vienna  Nov    Dec    SIR  I Have this moment the favour of yours I will suspend a tour I was going to take into Hungary and instantly set out for Munich And if I find you not there will proceed to Trent This city being on the confines of Italy will be most convenient as I presume to you in your return to Tuscany and I shall hope to meet you in it on the of December  I shall bring with me only a French valet and an English footman Other particulars may be adjusted when I have the honour to see you Till when I am Sir  Your most obedient Servant  R LOVELACE  Now Jack I have no manner of apprehension of the event of this meeting And I think I may say He seeks me not I him And so let him take the consequence  What is infinitely nearer to my heart is my ingratitude to the most excellent of womenMy  premeditated  ingratitudeYet all the while enabled to distinguish and to adore her excellencies in spite of the mean opinion of the Sex which I had imbibed from early manhood  But this Lady has asserted the worthiness of her Sex and most gloriously has she exalted it with me now Yet surely as I have said and written an hundred times there cannot be such another woman  But while my loss in her is the greatest of any man's and while she was nearer to me than to any other person in the world and once she herself wished to be so what an insolence in any man breathing to pretend to avenge her on  me  Happy happy thrice happy had I known how to value as I ought to have valued the glory of such a preference  I will aggravate to myself this aggravation of the Colonel's pretending to call me to account for my treatment of a lady so much  my own  lest in the approaching interview my heart should relent for one so nearly related to her and who means honour and justice to her memory and I should thereby give him advantages which otherwise he cannot have For I know that I shall be inclined to trust to my skill to save a man who was so much and so justly valued by her and shall be loth to give way to my resentment as a threatened man And in this respect only am I sorry for his skill and his courage lest I should be obliged in my own defence to add a chalk to a score that is already too long  INDEED indeed Belford I am and shall be to my latest hour the most miserable of beings Such exalted generosityWhy didst thou put into my craving hands the copy of her Will Why sentest thou to me the posthumous LetterWhat tho' I was earnest to see the Will Thou knewest what they  both  were  I  did not and that it would be cruel to oblige me  The meeting of twenty Colonel Mordens were there twenty to meet in turn would be nothing to me would not give me a moment's concern as to my own safety  But my reflections upon my vile ingratitude to so superior an excellence will ever be my curse  Had she been a Miss Howe to me and treated me as if I were an Hickman I had had a call for revenge and policy when I had intended to be an husband might have justified my attempts to humble her But a meek and gentle temper was hers tho' a true heroine whenever honour or virtue called for an exertion of spirit  Nothing but my cursed devices stood in the way of my happiness Remembrest thou not how repeatedly from the  first  I poured cold water upon her rising flame by meanly and ingratefully turning upon her the  injunctions  which  virgin delicacy  and  filial duty  induced her to lay me under before I got her into my power  See Vol  iii  p    See also Letters  xvixliiixliv  of the same Volume and many other places    Did she not tell me and did I not know it if she had not told me  that she could not be guilty of affectation or tyranny to the man whom she intended to marry  See Vol  v  p    It may be observed further that all Clarissa's occasional lectures to Miss Howe on that young lady's treatment of Mr Hickman prove that she was herself above affectation and tyrannySee more particularly the advice she gives to that friend of her heart Letter  xvii  p    of this Volume'O my dear' says she in this Letter  'that it had been my lot as I was not permitted to live single to have met with a man by whom I could have acted generously and unreservedly  c c  '  I knew as she once upbraided me that from the time I had got her from her father's house  I had a plain path before me  Vol  v  p    True did she say and I triumphed in the discovery that from that time  I had held her soul in suspense an hundred times  Vol  v  p    My Ipecacuanha trial alone was enough to convince an infidel that she had a mind in which love and tenderness would have presided had I permitted the charming buds to put forth and blow  Vol  iv  Letters  xxxvixxxvii    She  would have had no reserves  as once she told me  had I not given her cause of doubt  Vol  v  p    And did she not own to thee  that once she could have loved me and could she have made me good would have made me happy  See p    of this Volume  O Belford here was Love a Love of the noblest kindA Love as she hints in her posthumous Letter  See p    of this Volume  that  extended to the Soul and which she not only avowed in her dying hours but contrived to let me know it after death in that Letter filled with warnings and exhortations which had for their sole end my eternal welfare  The cursed women indeed endeavoured to excite my vengeance and my pride by preaching to me eternally her doubts her want of love and her contempt of me And my pride was at times too much excited by their vile insinuations But had it even been as they said well might she who had been used to be courted and admired by every desiring eye and worshiped by every respectful heartWell might  such  a woman be allowed to draw back when she found herself kept in suspense  as to the great qu  stion of all  by a designing and intriguing spirit pretending awe and distance as reasons for reiningin a fervor which if real cannot be reinedinDivine creature Her very doubts her reserves so justly doubting would have been my assurance and my gloryAnd what other trial needed her virtue What other needed a purity so angelic blessed with such a command of her passions in the bloom of youth had I not been a villainand a wanton a conceited a proud fool as well as a villain  These reflections sharpened rather than their edge by time rebated accompany me in whatever I do and whereever I go and mingle with all my diversions and amusements And yet I go into gay and splendid company I have made new acquaintance in the different courts I have visited I am both esteemed and sought after by persons of rank and merit I visit the colleges the churches the palaces I frequent the theatre Am present at every public exhibition and see all that is worth seeing that I had not seen before in the cabinets of the curious Am sometimes admitted to the toilette of an eminent toast and make one with distinction at the assemblées of othersYet can think of nothing nor of anybody with delight but of my CLARISSA Nor have I seen one woman with advantage to herself but as she resembles in stature air complexion voice or in some feature that charmer that only charmer of my soul  What greater punishment than to have these astonishing  perfections which she was mistress of strike my remembrance with such force when I have nothing left me but the remorse of having deprived myself and the world of such a blessing Nowandthen indeed am I capable of a gleam of comfort arising not ungenerously from the moral certainty which I have of her everlasting happiness in spite of all the machinations and devices which I set on foot to insnare her virtue and to bring down so pure a mind to my own level  For can I be at  worst  Avert that worst  O Thou  SUPREME  who only canst avert it  So much a wretch so very far abandon'd  But that I must ev'n in the horrid'st gloom  Reap intervenient joy at least some respite  From pain and anguish in  her  blissFor why  This very  soul must sufferNot  another    It  can't  be  mine  if it could envy her  Or at her happiness repine  IF I find myself thus miserable abroad I will soon return to England and follow your example I thinkturn hermit or some plaguy thing or other and see what a constant course of penitence and mortification will do for me There is no living at this rateDn me if there be  If any mishap should befal me you'll have the particulars of it from De la Tour He indeed knows not a word of English But every modern tongue is yours He is a trusty and ingenious fellow And if any thing happen will have some other papers which I shall have ready sealed up for you to transmit to Lord M And since thou art so expert and so ready at Executorships pr'ythee Belford accept of the office for Me as well as for my ClarissaCLARISSA LOVELACE let me call her  By all that's good I am bewitched to her memory Her very name with mine joined to it ravishes my soul and is more delightful to me than the sweetest music  Had I carried her I must still recriminate to any other place than to that accursed woman'sFor the potion was her invention and mixture and all the persistedin violence was at her instigation and at that of her wretched daughters  who have now amply revenged upon me their own ruin which they lay at my door    But this looks so like the confession of a thief at the gallows that possibly thou wilt be apt to think I am intimidated in prospect of the approaching interview But far otherwise On the contrary most chearfully do I go to meet the Colonel and I would tear my heart out of my breast with my own hands were it capable of fear or concern on that account  Thus much only I know that if I should kill him which I will not do if I can help it I shall be far from being easy in my mind  That  shall I never be more But as the meeting is evidently of his own seeking against an option fairly given to the contrary and I cannot avoid it I'll think of that hereafter It is but repenting and mortifying for all at once For I am as sure of victory as I am that I now live let him be as skilful a swordsman as he will Since besides that I am no unfleshed novice this is a sport that when provoked to it I love as well as my food And moreover I shall be as  calm and undisturbed  as the Bishop at his prayers While he as is evident by his letter must be actuated by revenge and passion  Doubt not therefore Jack that I shall give a good account of this affair Mean time I remain  Yours most affectionately  c LOVELACE  LETTER CXII Mr  LOVELACE  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  Trent  Dec    TOmorrow is to be the Day that will in all probability send either one or two ghosts to attend the Manes of my CLARISSA  I arrived here yesterday and inquiring for an English gentleman of the name of Morden soon found out the Colonel's lodgings He had been in town two days and left his name at every probable place  He was gone to ride out and I left  my  name and  where to be found And in the evening he made me a visit  He was plaguy gloomy That was not I But yet he told me that I had acted like a man of true spirit in my first letter and with honour in giving him so readily this meeting He wished I had in other respects and then we might have seen each other upon better terms than now we did  I said there was no recalling what was pass'd and that I wished some things had not been done as well as he  To recriminate now he said would be as exasperating as unavailable And as I had so chearfully given him this opportunity words should give place to business  Your  choice Mr Lovelace of Time of Place of Weapon shall be  my  choice  The two latter be yours Mr Morden The Time tomorrow or next day as you please  Next day then Mr Lovelace and we'll ride out tomorrow to fix the place  Agreed Sir  Well now Mr Lovelace do you choose the Weapon  I said I believed we might be upon an equal foot with the Single Rapier but if he thought otherwise I had no objection to a Pistol  I will only say replied he that the chances may be more equal by the Sword because we can neither of us be to seek in that And you'd stand says he a worse chance as I apprehend with a Pistol and yet I have brought two that you may take your choice of either For added he I never missed a mark at pistoldistance since I knew how to hold one  I told him that he spoke like himself That I was expert enough that way to embrace it if he chose it tho' not so sure of my mark as he pretended to be Yet the devil's in't Colonel if I who have slit a bullet in two upon a knife'sedge hit not my man So I have no objection to a Pistol if it be  your  choice No man I'll venture to say has a steadier Hand or Eye than I have  They may both be of use to you Sir at the Sword as well as at the Pistol The Sword therefore be the thing▪ if you please  With all my heart  We parted with a solemn sort of ceremonious civility And this day I called upon Him and we rode out together to fix upon the place And both being of one mind and hating to put off for the morrow what could be done today would have decided it then But De la Tour and the Colonel's valet who attended us being unavoidably let into the secret joined to beg we would have with us a Surgeon from Brixen whom La Tour had fallen in with there and who had told him he was to ride next morning to bleed a person in a fever at a lone cottage which by the Surgeon's description was not far from the place where we then were if it were not that very cottage within sight of us  They undertook so to manage it that the Surgeon should know nothing of the matter till his assistance was called in And La Tour being as I assured the Colonel a readycontriving fellow whom I ordered to obey him as myself were the chance to be in  his  favour we both agreed to defer the decision till tomorrow and to leave the whole about the Surgeon to the management of our two valets injoining them absolute secrecy And so rode back again by different ways  We fixed upon a little lone valley for the SpotTen tomorrow morning the TimeAnd Single Rapier the Word Yet I repeatedly told him that I value myself so much upon my skill in that weapon that I would wish him to choose any other  He said It was a gentleman's weapon and he who understood it not wanted a qualification that he ought to suffer for not having But that as to him one weapon was as good as another throughout all the instruments of offence  So Jack you see I take no advantage of him But my devil must deceive me if he take not his life or his death at my hands before eleven tomorrow morning  His valet and mine are to be present but both strictly injoined to be impartial and inactive And in return for my civility of the like nature he commanded  his  to be assisting to me if he fell  We are to ride thither and to dismount when at the place and his footman and mine are to wait at an appointed  distance with a chaise to carry off to the borders of the Venetian territories the survivor if one drop or to assist either or both as occasion may demand  And thus Belford is the matter settled  A shower of rain has left me nothing else to do And therefore I write this letter tho' I might as well have deferred it till tomorrow twelve o'clock when I doubt not to be able to write again to assure you how much I am  Yours  c LOVELACE  LETTER CXIII Translation of a Letter from  F J Dela Tour  To  JOHN BELFORD  Esq  near  SohoSquare London    Trent  December    N S  SIR  I Have melancholy news to inform you of by order of the Chevalier Lovelace He shewed me his letter to you before he sealed it signifying that he was to meet the Chevalier Morden on the th Wherefore as the occasion of the meeting is so well known to you I shall say nothing of it here  I had taken care to have ready within a little distance a Surgeon and his assistant to whom under an oath of secrecy I had revealed the matter tho' I did not own it to the two gentlemen so that they were prepared with bandages and all things proper For well was I acquainted with the bravery and skill of my Chevalier and had heard the character of the other and knew the animosity of both A postchaise was ready with each of their footmen at a little distance  The two Chevaliers came exactly at their time They were attended by Monsieur Margate the colonel's gentleman and myself They had given orders overnight and now repeated them in each other's presence that we should observe a strict impartiality between them And that if one fell each of us should look upon himself as to any needful help or retreat as the servant of the survivor and take his commands accordingly  After a few compliments both the gentlemen with the  greatest presence of mind that I ever beheld in men stript to their shirts and drew  They parried with equal judgment several passes My Chevalier drew the first blood making a desperate push which by a sudden turn of his antagonist missed going clear thro' him and wounded him on the fleshy part of the ribs of his right side which part the sword tore out being on the extremity of the body But before he could recover himself his adversary in return pushed him into the inside of the left arm near the shoulder And the sword by raking his breast as it passed being followed by a great effusion of blood the Colonel said Sir I believe you have enough  My Chevalier swore by Gd he was not hurt 'Twas a pin's point And so made another pass at his antagonist which he with a surprising dexterity received under his arm and run my dear Chevalier into the body Who immediately fell saying The luck is your's SirO my beloved ClarissaNow art thouInwardly he spoke three or four words more His sword dropt from his hand Mr Morden threw his down and ran to him saying in FrenchAh Monsieur you are a dead manCall to God for mercy  We gave the signal agreed upon to the footmen and they to the Surgeons who instantly came up  Colonel Morden I found was too well used to the bloody work for he was as cool as if nothing so extraordinary had happened assisting the Surgeons tho' his own wound bled much But my dear Chevalier fainted away two or three times running and vomited blood besides  However they stopped the bleeding for the present and we helped him into the voiture and then the Colonel suffered his own wound to be dressed and appeared concerned that my Chevalier was between whiles when he could speak and struggle extremely outrageousPoor gentleman he had made quite sure of victory  The Colonel against the Surgeons advice would mount on horseback to pass into the Venetian territories and generously gave me a purse of gold to pay the Surgeons desiring me to make a present to the footman and to accept  of the remainder as a mark of his satisfaction in my conduct and in my care and tenderness of my master  The Surgeons told him that my Chevalier could not live over the day  When the Colonel took leave of him Mr Lovelace said in French You have well revenged the dear creature  I have Sir said Mr Morden in the same language And perhaps shall be sorry that you called upon me to this work while I was balancing whether to obey or disobey the dear angel  There is a fate in it replied my ChevalierA cursed fateOr this could not have beenBut be ye all witnesses that I have provoked my destiny and acknowlege that I fall by a Man of Honour  Sir said the Colonel with the piety of a confessor wringing Mr Lovelace's hand snatch these few fleeting moments and commend yourself to God  And so he rode off  The voiture proceeded slowly with my Chevalier yet the motion set both his wounds bleeding afresh and it was with difficulty they again stopped the blood  We brought him alive to the first cottage and he gave orders to me to dispatch to you the pacquet I herewith send sealed up and bid me write to you the particulars of this most unhappy affair and to give you thanks in his name for all your favours and friendship to him  Contrary to all expectation he lived over the night But suffered much as well from his impatience and disappointment as from his wounds for he seemed very unwilling to die  He was delirious at times in the two last hours and then several times cried out Take her away Take her away but named nobody And sometimes praised some Lady that Clarissa I suppose whom he had called upon when he received his death's wound calling her Sweet Excellence Divine Creature Fair SuffererAnd once he said Look down blessed Spirit look downAnd there stopthis lips however moving  At nine in the morning he was seized with convulsions and fainted away and it was a quarter of an hour before he came out of them  His few last words I must not omit as they shew an ultimate composure which may administer some consolation to his honourable friends  Blessed  said he addressing himself no doubt to Heaven for his dying eyes were lifted upA strong convulsion prevented him for a few moments saying moreBut recovering he again with great fervor lifting up his eyes and his spread hands pronounced the word  Blessed  Then in a seeming ejaculation he spoke inwardly so as not to be understood At last he distinctly pronounced these three words  LET THIS EXPIATE  And then his head sinking on his pillow he expired at about half an hour after ten  He little thought poor gentleman his End so near So had given no direction about his body I have caused it to be embowelled and deposited in a vault till I have orders from England  This is a favour that was procured with difficulty and would have been refused had he not been an Englishman of rank A nation with reason respected in every Austrian governmentFor he had refused ghostly attendance and the Sacraments in the Catholic way May his Soul be happy I pray God  I have had some trouble also on account of the manner of his death from the Magistracy here Who have taken the requisite informations in the affair And it has cost me some money Of which and of my dear Chevalier's effects I will give you a faithful account in my next And so waiting at this place your commands I am SIR  Your most faithful and obedient Servant  F J DE LA TOUR  CONCLUSION  Supposed to be written by Mr BELFORD  WHAT remains to be mentioned for the satisfaction of such of the readers as may be presumed to have interested themselves in the fortunes of those other principals in the story who survived Mr Lovelace will be found summarily related as follows  The news of Mr LOVELACE's unhappy End was received with as much grief by his own relations as it was with exultation by the Harlowefamily and by Miss Howe His own family were  most  to be pitied because being sincere admirers of the inimitable Lady they were greatly grieved for the injustice done her and now had the  additional  mortification of losing the only male of it by a violent death  That his fate was deserved was still a heightening of their calamity as they had for that very reason and his unpreparedness for it but too much grounds for apprehension with regard to his future happiness While the other family from their unforgiving spirit and even the noble young Lady abovementioned from her lively resentments sound his death some little some temporary alleviation of the heavy loss they had sustained principally thro' his means  Temporary alleviation  we repeat as to the Harlowe family for THEY were far from being happy or easy in their reflections upon their own conduct  Mrs HARLOWE lived about two years and an half after the muchlamented death of her excellent daughter  Mr HARLOWE survived his Lady about half a year  BOTH in their last hours comforted themselves that they should be restored to their BLESSED daughter as they always from the time that they were acquainted with her happy  exit  called her  They both lived however to see their son  James  and their daughter  Arabella  married But not to take joy in either of their nuptials  Mr JAMES HARLOWE married a woman of family an orphan and is obliged at a very great expence to support her claim to estates which were his principal inducement to make his addresses to her but which to this day he has not recovered nor is likely to recover having very powerful adversaries to contend with and a Title to assert which admits of litigation and he not blessed with so much patience as is necessary to persons embarrassed in Law  What is further observable with regard to him is that the match was intirely of his own head against the advice of his father mother and uncles who warned him of marrying in this lady a Lawsuit for life His ungenerous behaviour to his wise for what she cannot help and for what is as much her misfortune as his has occasioned such estrangements between them she being a woman of spirit as were the Lawsuits determined and even more favourably than probably they will be must make him unhappy to the End of his Life He attributes all his misfortunes when he opens himself to the  few  friends he has to his vile and cruel treatment of his angelic sister He confesses these misfortunes to be just without having temper to acquiesce in the acknowleged justice One month in every year he puts on mourning and that month commences with him on the th of September during which he shuts himself up from all company Finally he is looked upon and often calls himself THE MOST MISERABLE OF BEINGS  ARABELLA's Fortune became a temptation to a man of Quality to make his addresses to her His Title an inducement with her to approve of him Brothers and Sisters when they are not Friends are generally the sharpest Enemies to each other He thought too much was done for her in the settlements She thought not enough And  for some years past they have so heartily hated each other that if either know a joy it is in being told of some new misfortune or displeasure that happens to the other Indeed before they came to an open rupture they were continually loading each other by way of exonerating themselves  to the additional disquiet of the whole family  with the  principal  guilt of their implacable behaviour and sordid cruelty to their admirable SisterMay the reports that are spread of this Lady's further unhappiness from her Lord's free life a fault she  justly  thought so odious in Mr Lovelace though that would not have been an insuperable objection with her to his addresses and of his public slights and contempt of her and even sometimes of his  personal abuses  which are said to be owing to her impatient spirit and violent passions be utterly groundlessFor what a heart must that be which would wish she might be as great a torment to herself as she had aimed to be to her Sister Especially as she regrets to this hour and declares that she shall to the last of her life her cruel treatment of that Sister and as well as her Brother is but too ready to attribute to  that  her own unhappiness  Mr ANTONY and Mr JOHN HARLOWE are still at the writing of this living But often declare That with their beloved niece they lost all the joy of their lives And lament without reserve in all companies the unnatural part they were induced to take against her  Mr SOLMES is also still living if a man of his cast may be said to live for his general behaviour and sordid manners are such as justify the aversion the excellent Lady had to him He has moreover found his addresses rejected by several women of far inferior fortunes great as his own are to those of the Lady to whom he was encouraged to aspire  Mr MOWBRAY and Mr TOURVILLE having lost the man in whose conversation they so much delighted shock'd and awakened by the several unhappy catastrophes before their eyes and having always rather  ductile  than  dictating  hearts took their friend Belford's advice Converted the remainder of their fortunes into Annuities for Life and retired the one into Yorkshire the other into Nottinghamshire of which counties they are natives  Their friend Belford managing their concerns for them and corresponding with them and having more and more hopes every time he sees them which is once or twice a year when they come to town that they will become more and more worthy of their names and families  It cannot be amiss to mention what became of the two sisters in iniquity  Sally Martin  and  Polly Horton  names so frequently occurring in the foregoing collection  After the death of the profligate Sinclair they kept on the infamous trade with toomuch success till an accident happened in the houseA gentleman of family killed in it in a fray contending with another for a newvamp'd face Sally was accused of holding the gentleman's arm while his more favoured adversary run him through the heart and then made off And she being try'd for her life narrowly escaped  This accident obliged them to break up housekeeping and not having been frugal enough of their illgotten gains lavishing upon one what they got by another they were compelled for subsistencesake to enter themselves as undermanagers at such another house as their own had been In which service soon after Sally died of a fever and surfeit got by a debauch And the other▪ about a month after by a violent cold occasioned thro' carelessness in a Salivation Two creatures who wanted not sense and had had what is deemed to be a good Modern Education their parents having lived reputably and once having much better hopes of them But who were in a great measure answerable for their miscarriages by indulging them in the fashionable follies and luxury of an age given up to those amusements and pleasures which are so apt to set people of but  Middle Fortunes  above all the useful employments of life and to make young women an easy prey to Rakes and Libertines  Happier Scenes open for the remaining characters for it might be descending too low to mention the untimely Ends of  Dorcas  and of  William  Mr Lovelace's wicked servant and the pining and consumptive ones of  Betty Barnes  and  Joseph Leman  unmarried both and in less  than a year after the happy death of their excellent young Lady  The good Mrs NORTON passed the small remainder of her life as happily as she wished in her beloved fosterdaughter's dairyhouse as it used to be called  As she wished  we repeatfor she had too strong aspirations after Another life to be greatly attached to This  She laid out the greatest part of her time in doing good by her advice and by the prudent management of the Fund committed to her direction Having lived an Exemplary Life from her Youth upwards and seen her Son happily settled in the world she departed with ease and calmness without pang or agony like a tired traveller falling into a sweet slumber Her last words expressing her hope of being restored to the Child of her Bosom and to her own excellent Father and Mother to whose care and pains she owed that good Education to which she was indebted for all her other blessings  The Poor's Fund which was committed to her care she resigned a week before her death into the hands of Mrs Hickman according to the direction of the Will and all the accounts and disbursements with it which she had kept with such an exactness that that Lady declares that she will follow her method and only wishes to do as well  Miss HOWE was not to be persuaded to quit her mourning for her dear friend until six months were fully expired And then she made Mr HICKMAN one of the happiest men in the world A woman of her fine sense and understanding married to a man of virtue and goodnature who had no past capital errors to reflect upon and to abate his joys and whose behaviour to  Mrs Hickman  is as affectionate as it was respectful to  Miss Howe  could not do otherwise They are already blessed with two fine children a Daughter to whom by joint consent they have given the name of her be  oved friend and a Son who bears that of his father  She has allotted to Mr Hickman who takes delight in doing good and that as much for its own sake as to oblige her  his part  of the management of the Poor's Fund to be accoun  able for it as she pleasantly says to  her  She has appropriated every Thursday morning for  her part  of  that management and takes so much delight in the task that she declares it is one of the most agreeable of her amusements And the more agreeable as she teaches every one whom she benefits  to bless the Memory of her departed Friend  to whom she attributes the merit of all  her own  charities as well as that of those which she dispenses in pursuance of her Will  She has declared That this Fund shall never fail while she lives She has even engaged her Mother to contribute annually to it And Mr Hickman has appropriated twenty pounds a year to the same In consideration of which she allows him to recommend four objects yearly to partake of it  Allows  is her style for she assumes the whole prerogative of dispensing this charity the  only  prerogative she does or has occasion to assume In every other case there is but  one will  between them and that is generally his or hers as either speak first upon any subject be it what it will MRS HICKMAN she sometimes as pleasantly as generously tells him must not  quite  forget that she was once MISS HOWE because if he had not loved her as such and with all her foibles she had never been Mrs  Hickman  Nevertheless she seriously on all occasions and that to others as well as to himself confesses that she owes him  unreturnable  obligations for his patience  with  her in HER Day and for his generous Behaviour  to  her in HIS  And still the more highly does she esteem and love him as she reflects upon his past kindness to her beloved friend and on that dear friend's good opinion of him Nor is it less grateful to her that the worthy man joins most sincerely with her in all those respectful and affectionate recollections which make the memory of the Departed precious to Survivors  Mr BELFORD was not so destitute of humanity and affection as to be unconcerned at the unhappy sate of his most intimate friend But when he reflects upon the untimely Ends of several of his companions but just mentioned in the preceding history  See Vol  VI  p    And p    and    of this Volume  On the shocking despondency and death of his poor friend  Belton  On the signal justice which overtook the wicked  Tomlinson    On the dreadful exit of the infamous  Sinclair  On the deep remorses of his more valued friendAnd on the other hand on the Example set him by the most excellent of her Sexand on her blessed preparation and happy departureAnd when he considers as he often does with awe and terror that his  wicked habits  were so  rooted  in his depraved heart that all  these Warnings  and this  lovely Example  seemed to be  but necessary  to enable him to subdue them and to reform and that such awakening Calls are hardly ever afforded to men of his cast or if they are but seldom attended with such happy effects in the Prime of Youth and in the full Vigour of ConstitutionWhen he reflects upon all these things he adores the Mercy which thro' these Calls has snatched him as a  brand out of the fire  And thinks himself obliged to make it his endeavour to find out and to reform any of those who may have been endangered by his means as well as to repair to the utmost of his power any damage or mischiefs which he may have occasioned to others  With regard to the Trust with which he was honoured by the inimitable Lady he had the pleasure of acquitting himself of it in a very few months to everybody's satisfaction even to that of the unhappy family who sent him their thanks on the occasion Nor was he at delivering up his accounts contented with resigning the Legacy bequeathed to him to the Uses of the Will So that the Poor's Fund as it is called is become a very considerable sum and will be a lasting bank for relief of objects who best deserve relief  There was but one Earthly Blessing which remained for Mr Belford to wish for in order morally speaking to secure to him all his other blessings and that was the greatest of all worldly ones a virtuous and prudent Wife So free a liver as he had been he did not think that he could be worthy of such a one till upon an impartial examination of himself he found the pleasure he had in his new resolutions so great and his abhorrence of his former courses so sincere that he was the less apprehensive of a deviation  Upon this presumption having also kept in his mind some encouraging hints from Mr Lovelace and having  been so happy as to have it in his power to oblige Lord M and that whole noble family by some services grateful to them the request for which from his unhappy friend was brought over among other papers with the dead body by De la Tour he besought that Nobleman's Leave to make his addresses to Miss CHARLOTTE MONTAGUE the eldest of his Lordship's two nieces And making at the same time such proposals of Settlements as were not objected to his Lordship was pleased to use his powerful interest in his favour And his worthy niece having no engagement she had the goodness to honour Mr Belford with her hand and thereby made him as completely happy as a man  can be  who has enormities to reflect upon which in a course of years the deaths of some of the injured parties and the irreclaimableness of others have put it out of his power to atone for  Happy is the man who in time of health and strength sees and reforms the errors of his waysBut how much more happy he who has no capital and wilful errors to repent ofHow unmixed and sincere must the joys of such a one come to him  Lord M added bountifully in his lifetime as did also the two Ladies his Sisters to the fortune of their worthy Niece And as Mr Belford has been blessed with a Son by her his Lordship at his death which happened just three years after the untimely one of his unhappy Nephew was pleased to devise to that Son and to his descendants for ever and in case of his death unmarried to any other children of his Niece his Hertfordshire estate  designed for Mr Lovelace  which he made up to the value of a moiety of his real estates bequeathing also a moiety of his personal to the same Lady  Miss PATTY MONTAGUE a fine young Lady to whom her Noble uncle at his death devised the other moiety of his real and personal estates including his Seat in Berkshire lives at present with her excellent Sister Mrs Belford to whom she removed upon Lord M's death But in all probability will soon be the Lady of a worthy Baronet of antient family fine qualities and ample fortunes just returned from his Travels with a character superior to the  very  good one he set out with A case  that very seldom happens altho' the  End of Travel is Improvement    Colonel MORDEN who with so many virtues and accomplishments cannot be unhappy in several Letters to the Executor with whom he corresponds from Florence having since his unhappy affair with Mr Lovelace changed his purpose of coming so soon to reside in England as he had intended declares That altho' he thought himself obliged either to accept of what he took to be a challenge as such or tamely to acknowlege that he gave up all resentment of his cousin's wrongs and in a manner to beg pardon for having spoken freely of Mr Lovelace behind his back and altho' at  the time  he owns he was not sorry to be called upon as he was to take either the one course or the other yet now coolly reflecting upon his beloved cousin's reasonings against Duelling and upon the price it had too probably cost the unhappy man he wishes he had more fully considered those words in his cousin's posthumous letter  'If God will allow him Time for Repentance why should you deny it him'  To concludeThe worthy Widow LOVICK continues to live with Mr Belford and by her prudent behaviour piety and usefulness has endeared herself to her Lady and to the Whole Family  POSTSCRIPT  THE Author of the foregoing Work has been favoured in the course of its Publication with many Anonymous Letters in which the Writers have  differently  expressed their wishes as to what they apprehended of the Catastrophe  Most of those directed to him by the gentler Sex turn in favour of what they call a  fortunate Ending  and some of them enamoured as they declare with the principal Character are warmly solicitous to have her  happy    These Letters having been written on the perusal of the first Four Volumes only before the complicated adjustment of the several parts to one another could be seen or fully known it may be thought superfluous now the whole Work is before the Public to enter upon this argument because it is presumed that the Catastrophe necessarily follows the natural progress of the Story But as the Notion of  Poetical Justice  seems to have generally obtained among the Fair Sex and must be confessed to have the appearance of Good Nature and Humanity it may not be amiss to give it a brief consideration  No can it be deemed impertinent to touch upon this subject at the Conclusion of a Work which is designed to inculcate upon the human mind under the guise of an Amusement the great Lessons of Christianity in an Age  like the present  which seems to expect from the Poets and Dramatic Writers that is to say from the Authors of Works of Invention that they should make it one of their principal Rules to propagate another Sort of Dispensation under the Name of  Poetical Justice  than that with which God by Revelation teaches us he has  thought fit to exercise Mankind whom placing here only in a State of  Probation  he hath so intermingled Good and Evil as to necessitate them to look forward for a more equal Distribution of both  The History or rather The Dramatic Narrative of CLARISSA is formed on this Religious Plan and is therefore well justified in deferring to extricate suffering Virtue till it meets with the Completion of its Reward  But we have no need to shelter our Conduct under the Sanction of Religion an Authority perhaps not of the greatest weight with modern Critics since we are justified in it by the greatest Master of Reason and the best Judge of Composition that ever was The learned Reader knows we must mean ARISTOTLE whose Sentiments in this matter we shall beg leave to deliver in the words of a very amiable Writer of our own Country  'The English Writers of Tragedy  says Mr Addison  Spectator Vol I No XL  are possessed with a Notion that when they represent a virtuous or innocent person in distress they ought not to leave him till they have delivered him out of his troubles or made him triumph over his enemies  'This  Error  they have been led into by a  ridiculous  Doctrine in  Modern Criticism  That they are obliged to an  equal distribution  of  Rewards  and  Punishments  and an impartial Execution of  Poetical Justice    'Who were the first that established this Rule I know not but I am sure it has no Foundation in NATURE in REASON or in the PRACTICE OF THE ANTIENTS  'We find that  in the dispensations of  PROVIDENCE Good and Evil happen alike to ALL MEN on this side the grave And as the principal design of Tragedy is to raise Commiseration and Terror in the minds of the Audience we shall defeat this great end if we always make Virtue and Innocence happy and successful  'Whatever crosses and disappointments a good man suffers in the  Body  of the Tragedy they will make but small impression on our minds when we know that  in the  last Act  he is to arrive at the end of his wishes and desires  'When we see him engaged in the depth of his afflictions we are apt to comfort ourselves because we are sure he will find his way out of them and that his grief how great soever it may be at present will soon terminate in gladness  'For this reason the antient Writers of Tragedy treated men in their  Plays  as they are dealt with in the  World  by making Virtue sometimes happy and sometimes miserable as they found it in the Fable which they made choice of or as it might affect their Audience in the most agreeable manner  'Aristotle considers the Tragedies that were written in either of those kinds and observes that those which ended unhappily had always pleased the people and carried away the Prize in the public disputes of the Stage from those that ended happily  This was at a time when the Entertainments of the Stage were committed to the Care of the Magistrates when the Prizes contended for were given by the State when of consequence the Emulation among Writers was ardent and when Learning was at the highest Pitch of Glory in that renowned Commonwealth  It cannot be supposed that the Athenians in this their highest Age of Taste and Politeness were less Humane less Tenderhearted than we of the present But they were not afraid of being moved nor ashamed of shewing themselves to be so at the distresses they saw well painted and represented In short they were of the opinion with the Wisest of men  That it was better to go to the House of Mourning than to the House of Mirth  and had Fortitude enough to trust themselves with their own generous grief because they found their hearts mended by it  Thus also Horace and the politest Romans in the Augustan Age wished to be affected  Ac ne forte putes me quae facere ipse recus  m  Cum recte tractant alii laudare maligne  Ille per extentum funem mibi posse videtur  Ire poeta meum qui pectus inaniter angit  Irritat mulcet falsis terroribus implet  Ut magus modo me Thebis modo ponit Atheni  ▪  Thus Englished by Mr Pope  Yet lest you think I railly more than teach  Or praise malignly  Arts  I cannot reach  Let me for once presume t'instruct the times  To know the  Poet  from the  Man of Rhymes    'Tis He who gives my breast a thousand pains  Can make me  feel  each passion that he feigns  Enragecomposewith more than magic Art  With  Pity  and with  Terror  tear my heart  And snatch me o'er the earth or thro' the air  To Thebes to Athens when he will and where    'Terror and Commiseration leave a  pleasing anguish  in the mind and fix the Audience in such a serious composure of thought as is much more lasting and delightful than any little transient Starts of Joy and Satisfaction  'Accordingly we find that more of our English Tragedies have succeeded in which the Favourites of the Audience sink under their calamities than those in which they recover themselves out of them  'The best Plays of this kind are  The Orphan Venice Preserved Alexander the Great Theodosius All for Love Oedipus Oroonoko Othello  c  'King  Lear  is an admirable Tragedy of the same kind as Shakespeare wrote it But as it is reformed according to the  chimerical notion  of Poetical  or as we may say AntiProvidential  Justice in my humble opinion it has lost half its beauty  Yet so different seems to be the Modern Taste from that of the Antients that the altered King Lear of Mr Tate is constantly acted on the English Stage in preference to the Original tho' written by Shakespeare himselfWhether this  strange  preference be owing to the false Delicacy or affected Tenderness of the Players or to that of the Audience has not for many years been tried And perhaps the former have not the courage to try the Public Taste upon it And yet if it were  ever  to be tried  Now  seems to be the Time when an  Actor  and a  Manager  in the  same person  is in being who deservedly engages the public savour in all he undertakes and who owes so much and is gratefully sensible that he does to that great Master of the human Passions    'At the same time I must allow that there are very noble Tragedies which have been framed upon the other Plan and have ended happily as indeed most of the good Tragedies which have been written since the starting of the abovementioned Criticism have taken  this turn As  The Mourning Bride Tamerlane  Yet in Tamerlane two of the most amiable characters Moneses and Aspasia suffer death    Ulysses Phaedra and Hippolytus  with most of Mr Dryden's I must also allow that many of Shakespeare's and several of the celebrated Tragedies of Antiquity are cast in the same form I do not therefore dispute against this way of writing Tragedies but against the Criticism that would establish This as the  only  method and by that means would very much cramp the English Tragedy and perhaps give a wrong bent to the Genius of our Writers'  Thus far Mr Addison  Our fair Readers are also desired to attend to what a celebrated Critic  R  pin on Aristotle's Poetics  of a neighbouring nation says on the nature and design of Tragedy from the Rules laid down by the same great Antient  'Tragedy says he makes man  modest  by representing the great Masters of the Earth humbled and it makes him  tender  and  merciful  by shewing him the  strange accidents of life  and the  unforeseen disgraces  to which the most important persons are subject  'But because Man is naturally timorous and compassionate he may fall into other extremes Too much Fear may shake his Constancy of Mind and too much Compassion may enfeeble his Equity 'Tis the business of Tragedy to regulate these two weaknesses It prepares and arms him against  Disgraces  by shewing them so frequent in the most considerable persons and he will cease to fear extraordinary accidents when he sees them happen to the  highest  And still more efficacious we may add the example will be when he sees them happen to the  best  part of mankind  'But as the End of Tragedy is to teach men nor to fear too weakly  common Misfortunes  it proposes also to teach them to spare their Compassion for Objects that  deserve it  For there is an  Injustice  in being  moved at the afflictions of those who  deserve to be miserable  We may see without pity Clytemnestra slain by her son Orestes in  Aeschylus  because she had murdered Agamemnon her husband and we cannot see Hippolytus die by the plot of his stepmother Phaedra in  Euripides  without Compassion because he died not but for being chaste and virtuous'  These are the great Authorities so favourable to the Stories that end unhappily Yet the Writer of the History of Clarissa is humbly of Opinion that he might have been excused referring to them for the vindication of  his  Catastrophe even by those who are advocates for the contrary opinion since the notion of  Poetical Justice  founded on the  Modern Rules  has hardly ever been more strictly observed in works of this nature than in the present performance if any regard at all be to be paid to the  Christian System  on which it is formed  For Is not Mr  Lovelace  who could persevere in his villainous views against the strongest and most frequent convictions and remorses that ever were sent to awaken and reclaim a wicked manIs not this great this wilful Transgressor condignly  punished  and his punishment brought on thro' the intelligence of the very Joseph Leman whom he had corrupted  See Vol  vii  p    and by means of the very women whom he had debauched  Idem p    Is not Mr  Belton  who has an uncle's  hastened  death to answer for  Idem p    Are not the  whole Harlowe family  Is not the vile  Tomlinson  Are not the infamous  Sinclair  and her  wretched Partners  And even the wicked  Servants  who with their eyes open contributed their parts to the carrying on of the vile schemes of their respective principals  Are they not All likewise exemplarily punished  On the other hand Is not Miss HOWE for her noble Friendship to the exalted Lady in her calamitiesIs not Mr HICKMAN for his unexceptionable Morals and Integrity of LifeIs not the repentant and not ungenerous  BELFORDIs not the worthy NORTON  made signally happy  And who that are in earnest in their Profession of Christianity but will rather envy than regret the triumphant death of CLARISSA whose Piety from her early Childhood whose diffusive Charity whose steady Virtue whose Christian Humility whose Forgiving Spirit whose Meekness whose Resignation HEAVEN  only  could reward  It may not be amiss to remind the Reader that so early in the work as Vol II p the dispensations of Providence in her distresses are justified by herself And thus she ends her Reflections"I shall not live alwaysMay my Closing Scene be happy"  She had her wish It was happy    The Length of the piece has been objected to by some who had seen only the first four Volumes and who perhaps looked upon it as a mere  Novel  or  Romance  and yet of  these  there are not wanting works of equal length  They were of opinion that the Story moved too slowly particuarly in the first and second Volumes which are chiefly taken up with the Altercations between Clarissa and the several persons of her Family  But is it not true that those Altercations are the Foundation of the whole and therefore a necessary part of the work The Letters and Conversations where the Story makes the slowest progress are presumed to be  characteristic  They give occasion likewise to suggest many interesting  Personalities  in which a good deal of the Instruction essential to a work of this nature is conveyed And it will moreover be remembred that the Author at his first setting out apprised the Reader that the Story was to be looked upon as the Vehicle only to the Instruction  To all which we may add that there was frequently a necessity to be very circumstantial and minute in order to preserve and main  ain that Air of Probability which is necessary to be maintained in a Story designed to represent real Life and which is rendered extremely busy and  active by the plots and contrivances formed and carried on by one of the principal Characters  In a word  If  in the History before us it shall be found that the Spirit is duly diffused throughout that the Characters are various and natural well distinguished and uniformly supported and maintained  If  there be a variety of incidents sufficient to excite Attention and those so conducted as to keep the Reader always awake the Length then must add proportionably to the pleasure that every Person of Taste receives from a welldrawn Picture of Nature But where the contrary of all these qualities shock the understanding the extravagant performance will be judged tedious tho' no longer than a FairyTale  FINIS  ERRATA  VOL V p l  dele  have  p l  dele  in  p l  after
