Royal Highness GEORGE PRINCE of WALES  SIR  THE Author of these Fables flatters himself that the Principles of a steadfast Loyalty imbided in his earliest days from the example and instruction of a Father who had the Honour to serve your ROYAL HIGHNESS'S illustrious Ancestors near fifty years in a Military station Principles ripened and established by a conviction that the Public  welfare

rout  For goddesses have had their day  To be as modern ladies gay  Two females mostly known by name  One VIRTUE call'dthe other FAME  Disputed who should lead or follow  Into the presence of APOLLO  The matter after verbal fight  Was brought before the God of light  When FAME remark'd for nimble tongue  Addressing first complain'd of wrong  Shall I declaim'd the winged fair  Who boast such eyes so fine an air  With almost ev'ry beauty grac'd  Be thus in competition plac'd  With such a formal homely creature  Without one fashionable feature  Shall I to whom the  Great  resort  Whom  Monarchs  have been proud to court  Provoking fate midst War's alarms  To gain possession of my charms  Precedence yield to one so mean  Amongst the  great  so seldom seen  Whom rustic  cots  can better please  Than dear inchanting  palaces  The very thought is fill'd with shame  And judgment gives in right of FAME  She paus'dAPOLLO then desir'd  Such answer as the cause requir'd  Which VIRTUE thus with modest grace  An easy shape and cherub face  Declar'd before the court in brief  Thence justly claiming fit relief  This girlish female God of day  To knaves and fools a frequent prey  Of high connections boasts in vain  Light phantoms of her idle brain  Greatness you'll ownwithout my care  A baseless castle in the air  And rural  cots  where I resort  Much nobler than a vicious  court  'Tis true she posts the world around  And fills it with a mighty sound  O'er mankind rules in various spheres  And leads them captive by the ears  Yet what of this when oft she flies  To propagate the grossest lies  And wounds in blackest guilt's defence  The cause of spotless innocence  Here then let ill tim'd diff'rence end  On worth and justice I depend  The judge who heard with much respect  His sentence pass'd to this effect  Spoke all his thoughts without disguise  Th' impartial CAMDEN of the skies  VIRTUE no doubt may justly claim  Precedence from contending FAME  Tho' monumental falshoods pass  With fools because engrav'd on brass  Tho' villains of gigantic size  In marble statues vainly rise  Tho' titles coronets and state  Like gewgaws deck th' unworthy  great  Tho' venal authors gild a name  Which sacred truth would brand with shame  A cheated people's loud huzzas  With all the farce of earthly praise  By VIRTUE unsupported fail  And vanish like the passing gale  Then madam FAME deceitful beauty  'Tis fit that you confess your duty  For tho' exalted by a throne  You cannot long exist alone  Virtue observe I recommend  As kindest parent truest friend  Beneath whose just and gentle sway  You'll live 'till time itself decay  I look into the womb of time  And view a yet unnotic'd clime  By Neptune's azure flood enclos'd  Where harrass'd freedom safe repos'd  Shall gain you with a gracious smile  To live as friends in BRITAIN'S isle  To beam your lustre round her throne  And mark her monarch all your own  FABLE II THE NILE AND THE SEA  LIFE a dependant chain appears  With links to join its sev'ral spheres  Shew judging reason when you will  One plac'd on high there's higher still  'Till strain'd progression mounts the sky  And melts in vast infinity  Pride like a prism such tints reveals  As Wisdom's naked eye conceals  How idly vain then mortal man  Whose fleeting life is but a span  Tho' rais'd on Fortune's boldest wing  A rich a brave a happy king  Who thinks with selfsufficient spirit  All centers in his boundless merit  Who void of gratitude and sense  Disclaims parental PROVIDENCE  Whence all above and all below  Wealth happiness and courage flow  The king of rivers sev'nmouth NILE  Which yearly floods the neighbouring soil  Which loads with grain the teeming earth  And gives a thousand harvests birth  Once like a human Coxcomb thought  His pow'r alone those blessings wrought  What is he cried the thirsty Sea  In competition set with me  My springs my streams support its tide  Whose mighty gulph must unsupplied  Turn to a wild and barren shore  The boasting watry world no more  To scatter blessings round I reign  And fertilize a vast domain  Which wisely annual homage pays  In fit returns of grateful praise  While yonder congregated flood  Does none or very little good  And yet its haughty billows rise  As if to brave th' unheeding skies  What  stoic  here could check a smile  To hear the SEA compar'd with NILE  The selfsufficient river spoke  In sounds like clouds of thunder broke  'Till ev'n its CROCODILES began  To vie with huge LEVIATHAN  And thought they must in reason be  Of greater size and quality  Old OCEAN heard and tho' disdain  Had best repaid a speech so vain  He chose with condescension mild  Thus to rebuke his eldest child  Restrain presuming brook thy pride  Though thou and all thy springs were dry'd  Thy petty tribute hardly miss'd  In glory I should still exist  Who gives the SUN'S exhaling beams  The moisture to supply thy streams  Who gives the fleecy clouds their rain  To sprinkle thirsty earth again  Thou but return'st what I have lent  To form a fruitful continent  Rais'd in thy own opinion high  Thou think'st not that beyond the sky  There dwells a Pow'r a gen'ral source  Who gave the elements their course  Who gave the lower world its birth  Of water framing it and earth  Who fix'd to each the proper bound  And mantled them with Aether round  Who mark'd the glorious Sun his way  Who bid it shine and give the day  Who spangled o'er with gems of light  The mild  cerulean  robe of night  Who gave in his omnipotence  To beasts their strength to man his sense  Who cloath'd the birds with plumed grace  Who fishes form'd a scaly race  Who fix'd the seasons varying round  With diff'rent fruits and emblems crown'd  The eyeenliv'ning pregnant Spring  With vegetation on its wing  The bridegroom Summer deck'd with flow'rs  And blooming Nature's strongest pow'rs  Autumn in golden honours clad  The peasant's humble hopes to glad  Hoar Winter with its chilly train  Of earthrefreshing frosts and rain  'Tis PROVIDENCE which all bestows  No atom selfexistent grows  'Twas PROVIDENCE created me  And hence was form'd a source for thee  'Tis PROVIDENCE that gives again  Thy borrow'd waters to the main  'Tis PROVIDENCE suspends them high  Condens'd in clouds 'twixt earth and sky  'Tis PROVIDENCE with boundless pow'rs  That melts them to propitious show'rs  From PROVIDENCE all blessings flow  Which animated beings know  'Tis PROVIDENCE which reigns thro' all  Which guides and shields this earthly ball  Content with thy exalted state  Learn wisdomand be truly great  Remember thy majestic flood  Th' ETERNAL gave for others good  Not for thyself alone design'd  But to enrich and bless mankind  Perform on Nature's stage thy part  Well satisfied with what thou art  Wisely support thy rank and spirit  By aiming at superior merit  Nor vainly seeking higher stile  In claiming more be less than NILE  Like human fools who with such care  Build baseless castles in the air  Which rise at magic Folly's call  And with the breath of Reason fall  Thus venerable OCEAN said  And sunk beneath the waves his head  FABLE III THE JUST LION  A FOX impell'd by hunger's cries  Had made a LAMB his sacrifice  When just as ev'ry thing was fit  To revel on his dainty bit  A lordly PANTHER passing by  Beheld it with voracious eye  And being nobly born of course  The FOX'S dinner seiz'd by force  With this remarkTho' peasants starve  PEERS as they please should always CARVE  REYNARD thro' fear must needs obey  So lick'd his chaps and slunk away  Yet still tho' not in body strong  His feeling heart would bear no wrong  To LEO'S court with speed he flew  There standing in the Monarch's view  Stated at full th' oppressive case  With simple truth and piteous face  Concluding thusMy Prince I know  Will most impartial justice show  Wherefore to his decision I  Submit my life and property  The weak the nameless and the poor  Where VIRTUE reigns must be secure  The LION heard with honest wonder  And cried If I permit such plunder  The monarchy of BEASTS will then  Degen'rate into that of MEN  But other views shall guide my sway  And ev'ry rank our laws obey  Summon LORD PANTHERstraight he came  And boldly answer'd to his name  Confess'd the injur'd FOX'S charge  In all its sev'ral points at large  Yet confidently seem'd to think  That vulgar creature's meat and drink  Should to indulge his want or whim  Just as he chose belong to HIM  You know my LIEGE continues he  I'm one of noble progeny  Who if occasion urg'd me could  Alliance prove to  Royal  blood  Shall paltry REYNARD dare complain  Nor meet as sure he ought disdain  Titles  and  rank  are my defence  But what can save his  insolence  For my own part I am content  His crime should be his punishment  Then let him gracious LIEGE I pray  This once go unchastis'd away  The LION worthy of his place  With sparkling eye and awful grace  Spoke thus and bade his court attend  This PANTHER once my valu'd friend  Convicted thus of proud oppression  By evidence and selfconfession  Howe'er he thinks the action light  I banish from my heart and sight  Shall Noble Birth from justice save  Shall titles serve to screen a Knave  Shall Subjects be afraid to speak  And shall the strong devour the weak  The chain of prudent order broke  Authority becomes a joke  And thus applied howe'er sublime  PREEMINENCE becomes a CRIME  It never shall my friends be said  When dust entombs this Royal Head  To stain our Name in future years  That LEO shelter'd lawless PEERS  Subjects observe what I decide  To shame and sting dishonest pride  This PANTHER on the FOX shall wait  Six tedious months in servile state  And when occasion gives the charge  Still watch for prey or hunt at large  But ne'er presume to taste a bit  'Till REYNARD graciously thinks fit  SELFKNOWLEDGE thus a friend may be  And blunt the edge of TYRANNY  May teach him that the lordly part  Is seated in a noble heart  Which rather would itself endure  Some pangs of WANT than rob the POOR  If e'er to shame our laws and sense  I meet again such violence  Justice shall doom severer fate  To punish the licentious great  Nor will I mark me Subjects own  Ought noble but the Good alone  FABLE IV THE MOUNTAIN AND CLOUD  A Mountain which might justly vie  With ATLAS to support the sky  For ages had with boundless pride  O'erlook'd the plains on either side  And thought from his prodigious birth  He ought to rule their humbler earth  Tho' grac'd with corn and fruit and flocks  In contrast to his barren rocks  On which instead of ought that grows  Hung tempests dark and endless snows  One sullen carehis folly's doom  Still rankled in his flinty womb  That while the radiant source of day  Beam'd o'er the vales with kindly ray  An envious cloud eclipsing light  Wrapp'd his majestic head in night  Impatient of suppos'd disgrace  And fond to show his hideous face  Like some amongst the human kind  To all their grossest failings blind  Who selfsufficiently reveal  What prudence wisely would conceal  He thunder'd forth his plaint aloud  Against the dark impending cloud  How long foul vapour wilt thou dare  To shroud my brows and taint my air  Shall I who raging tempests sconr  Tho' on the wings of light'ning borne  Shall I whose strength can never fail  Tho' ev'n a deluge should assail  Be thus obscur'dvile cloud away  And give me to the eye of day  Stung with this insolent address  The CLOUD repliedI must confess  Gigantic neighbour what you speak  Declares that you tho' great are weak  What worth or beauty canst thou show  That's equal to the plains below  What lab'ring oxen till thy soil  What harvests pay the peasants toil  What fruits what herbage grace thy sides  What useful river o'er thee glides  What forests nod upon thy brows  Ne'er ruffled by industrious ploughs  Why steril mass of rugged stone  With skin of thriftless moss o'ergrown  Shouldst thou proclaim thy giant size  As if from thence desert could rise  Or make objections to my shade  Suspended o'er thy tow'ring head  Without reflecting 'tis the fate  Attending on superior state  To have or me or some such other  Perhaps a tempestbreeding brother  Around by way of caution glide  To check the swell of monst'rous pride  While humble and contented plains  An emblem of their village swains  With justice claim in being less  A larger share of happiness  In their obscure unenvied station  Than in thy cloud topt exaltation  Which 'spite of all the strength you boast  In sudden ruin may be lost  Thus spake the CLOUD as if inspir'd  And with a passing gale retir'd  When straight a subterraneous sound  Like distant thunder bellow'd round  The MOUNTAIN felt convulsive pain  And trembling shook thro' ev'ry vein  FABLE V THE EAGLE AND JAY  AN EAGLE whom we soon might prove  Descended from the bird of JOVE  Had we or time or cause to trace  The progress of his royal race  Diminish'd fame and weaken'd sway  By placing friendship on a JAY  A bird who like dissembling man  Play'd well the game of  Cat  in  Pan  Not one of all the feather'd kind  So nicely knew the Monarch's mind  Not one with such persuasive art  Could learn the fecrets of his heart  Nor gain with much superior sense  And loyalty such confidence  This prattling fav'rite often slew  In quest of news which false or true  He whisper'd to his master's ear  Whose greatest weakness was to hear  The JAY to serve each selfish end  Appear'd a very sanguine friend  Would oft lament that subject hearts  Were pregnant with destructive arts  That nothing could but watchful eyes  Prevent deep laid conspiracies  Declar'd he knew that many birds  Were noted for disloyal words  Who therefore ought to feel disgrace  In banishment from court and place  Urging his Prince with rig'rous claws  To put in force Tyrannic laws  With mischiefworking hints like these  He rous'd such groundless jealousies  That ev'ry night the Eagle's dreams  Were haunted with seditious schemes  His tortur'd fancy often view'd  By diff'rent deaths his life pursued  His sceptre broke his throne o'erturn'd  His race destroy'd and palace burn'd  'Till made by perturbation sour  He felt each pain of thorny pow'r  And bow'd beneath the cumbrous weight  Of friendless solitary state  With one sole blessing that the JAY  Paid faithful homage to his sway  His truest friends perceiv'd him shy  Suspicion gloom'd his piercing eye  A speechless cold and distant state  Made loyalty and love abate  Disorder crept throughout his realm  While he sat trembling at the helm  Yet none presum'd to ask the reason  Lest  Freedom  might be construed  Treason  At length the Monarch wearied out  Began to entertain some doubt  Whether his friend might not improve  On trifles thro' excessive love  As apprehension oft has made  A giant of an empty shade  Possess'd of this incog he flew  And wisely took a gen'ral view  Some plaints he heard but soon descry'd  They sprung from his suspicious pride  And met upon the whole content  Where'er his pleasing course he bent  To find himself thro' ev'ry wood  On ev'ry plain and ev'ry flood  Tho' censur'd in his regal part  Still monarch of each subject heart  At length as with returning night  He homeward wing'd his rapid flight  Skirting along a lonely wood  Near which an ancient castle stood  From its declining mossclad wall  By trembling age prepar'd to fall  A well known voice assail'd his ear  He curv'd his course and drawing near  Perceiv'd the JAY in this address  The deep designing knave confess  You think me loyal as I pay  My courtly visits ev'ry day  But penetration ne'er will deem  Us leveehunters what we seem  And on my word Sir FALCON know  My friendship is but outward show  Were I the honest truth to own  I wish to see you mount the throne  Our EAGLE'S but a silly fowl  Not two degrees above an Owl  Without the least pretence on earth  To royalty except his birth  Then let us find some specious cause  Suppose our liberties and laws  To seize his crown and in his stead  To place it on your abler head  I have a tongue both quick and loud  Let me harangue the gaping croud  With promisessure bait for fools  Who serve as politician's tools  I'll bring about a revolution  To mend our shatter'd constitution  With honest rage the Eagle warm'd  And with deathdealing talons arm'd  Pounc'd unperceiv'd upon the JAY  And snatch'd his Felonlife away  This sacrifice to justice made  The injur'd EAGLE wisely said  I find at length this prudent truth  That choice of friends to age or youth  Is from the cottage to the court  A matter of the last import  From me let future Monarchs learn  By their own senses to discern  Nor exercise unsafe command  By KNOWLEDGE gain'd at SECOND HAND  FABLE VI THE FARMER AND SPARROWS  A FARMER saw with much regret  Some SPARROWS in his field of wheat  And taking up a plunder'd ear  Exclaim'd in rage What havock's here  For this have I manur'd the soil  And till'd it with laborious toil  These feather'd Epicuresa curse  To each industrious Farmer's purse  I'll try without the least delay  To kill to maim or fright away  The thing no sooner said than done  He brought with double charge his gun  Then Plund'rers cried resign your breath  To leaden messengers of Death  And as his thoughtless rage inspir'd  Amongst the corn and birds he fir'd  Six victims fella joyful sight  He ran and seiz'd them with delight  Aha he cries at length y'are caught  Your dainties have been dearly bought  From hence your brother thieves may know  Justice is sure tho' sometimes slow  One SPARROW who had yet some breath  Replied You triumph in our death  We lie before your vengeful eyes  No doubt a pleasing sacrifice  Yet foolish mortal see and own  The unthought mischief you have done  Much more tho' rashly meant for good  Than twenty times our number cou'd  Besides surviving friends will more  Revenging us invade your store  What does your reason then avail  If only weigh'd in passion's scale  We lose a doubtful life 'tis true  But certain good is lost to you  The FARMER look'd when lo he saw  Full fourscore yards of earless straw  For such a tract the shot had made  He saw with grief and sighing said  I am a fool I own the name  I doubly feel the loss and shame  And find the man by passion wrought  Who turns to action sudden thought  Instead of profit or content  Will find occasion to repent  Then why should anger reason fetter  Reflection would have taught me better  FABLE VII THE KNIGHT ERRANT  IN former times much worse they were  Than those which give us vital air  For always be it understood  The present are both great and good  There liv'd so says our tale a wight  Whom scruples made an ERRANT KNIGHT  A more romantic headed ass  Than QUIXOTE CHARLES or HUDIBRAS  Who in his moral feelings nice  Resolv'd to quell the monster VICE  A greater Hydra ten degrees  Than THAT destroy'd by HERCULES  Arm'd as he fancied Capapie  With Reason and Morality  Stronger tho' light to take the field  Than AJAX' boasted sev'nfold shield  A court he sought as proper soil  To exercise his pious toil  SINCERITY devoid of state  Conducted to the palace gate  And seeking entrance gave her name  CORRUPTION ask'd from whom she came  Which told he shook his hoary head  And with a shrug important said  Admittance there could only be  For those of highest quality  Yet stretching forth his itching palm  With features and expression calm  He hinted favour to the KNIGHT  If soften'd by a PERQUISITE  Our HERO thinking once let in  His work of glory might begin  Straight let some golden logic drop  That CERBERUS might have a sop  But ah in vain at ev'ry door  CORRUPTION met him as before  Tho' PROTEUS like in various guise  To cheat his unsuspecting eyes  For none of all the courtly tribe  Would move he found without a bribe  Wearied at length and what is worse  Incumber'd with an empty purse  He cried "Was VIRTUE never here"  One answer'd "Is he friend a PEER  Or COMMONER of large estate  We know him not unless he's great"  DISCRETION strove in vain t' asswage  Our Hero fill'd with fireey'd rage  Who fiercely swift destruction vow'd  To VICE and all her train aloud  His furious speech a  lordly  wag  Immediately pronounc'd  Scan Mag  And threaten'd with a special warrant  The person of our poor KNIGHT ERRANT  Who rather dreading such a case  Resolv'd to fly the ticklish place  From COURT he sought a lady's ROUTE  And conquest hop'd beyond a doubt  He stood and saw with painful eye  The spotted witches circling fly  And said More devastation springs  From four ill painted pasteboard kings  Than e'er was spread o'er publick good  By any Tyrant since the flood  At length a COUNTESSnothing new  Secur'd a PAM to save her Loo  Which gave occasion to the KNIGHT  To speak at large against the bite  When one and all the gamesters said  He merited a broken head  But said Through grace and he might thank it  They'd only toss him in a blanket  Not satisfied he sought the city  And said on Change 'twas wond'rous pity  That mankind for each other made  Should try to overreach in trade  That merchandize could only be  A source of sordid usury  That moral feelings were discarded  And darling Gain alone regarded  That as the sage  Socrates  by Virtue aw'd  Call'd MARKETS once the seat of FRAUD  So still he added to their shame  They merited the hateful name  A Broker of the HEBREW nation  A knave by nature and vocation  Who knew his own defective heart  Assum'd the irritative part  Declar'd that man who could defame  And taint the Trader's spotless name  That others might be kept in awe  Deserv'd the sharpest lash of law  Thus having sounded an alarm  Each conscious Knave began to warm  A hum of mischievous intent  Ran thro' the sons of Cent per Cent  Till once again our KNIGHT defeated  Before an host of foes retreated  And wiser grown than heretofore  Resolv'd to combat VICE no more  The moral hence we hope is plain  That mankind are so blind or vain  So whirl'd by whim by passions tost  All but the name of Virtue's lost  That good example's more prevailing  Than all enthusiastic railing  And that the man's an ERRANT KNIGHT  Who strives with  gen'ral  VICE to fight  FABLE VIII THE BEAU AND BUTTERFLY  THUS speaks an Adage somewhat old  "TRUTH  is not to be always told  "  What eye but struck with outward show  Admires the pretty thing a BEAU  Which both by Art and Nature made is  The sport of sense the toy of ladies  A mortal of this tiney mold  In cloaths of silk adorn'd with gold  And dress'd in ev'ry point of sight  To give the world of taste delight  Prepar'd to enter his Sedan  A Birthday picture of a Man  Cried out in vain soliloquy  Was ever creature form'd like me  By Art or Nature's nicest care  Made more compleat and  Debonnair  I see myself with perfect joy  Of human kind the  Je ne sçai quoy  In ev'ry thing I rival FRANCE  In fashion wit and sprightly dance  So charming are my shape and parts  I'm form'd for captivating hearts  The proudest toast when in the vein  I take at once by  Coup de main  Mort de ma vie  'tis magic all  I look and vanquish'd Women fall  One of the race of BUTTERFLIES  An insect far more nice than wise  Who from his sunny couch of glass  Had listen'd to the two legg'd Ass  With intermeddling zeal replied  Unequal'd follymatchless pride  Shalt thou a patchwork creature claim  More lovely shape or greater name  Than one of us Assert thy right  Stand naked in my critic sight  To parent Earth at once resign  The produce of her golden mine  Give to the worm her silken store  The di'mond to GOLCONDA'S shore  Nor let the many teeth you want  Be plunder'd from the Elephant  Let native locks adorn thy head  Nor glow thy cheeks with borrow'd red  Give to the OSTRICH back his plume  Nor rob the CAT of her perfume  Here to the BEAVER yield at once  His fur which crowns thy empty sconce  In short appear thro' ev'ry part  No more nor less than what thou art  Then little better than an APE  Will show thy metamorphos'd shape  While BUTTERFLIES to death retain  The beauties they from Nature gain  You'll say perhaps our sojourn here  Is less by half than half a year  That churlish Winter surely brings  Destruction to our painted wings  I grant the truthnow answer me  Can Beaus outlive adversity  Will Milliners and Taylors join  To make a foppish  Beggar  fine  'Tis certain Noof glitter made  You surely vanish in the shade  Compar'd then who will dare deny  A BEAU is less than BUTTERFLY  FABLE IX SOCRATES AND THE BEAU  A  Grecian  Smart or Buck or Beau  GREECE had her Coxcombs too we know  Would needs his puny wit engage  With SOCRATES the moral SAGE  This dupe to fashion's flimzy rules  Like some we knowexisting fools  RELIGION deem'd and even Sense  Against POLITENESS an offence  Despis'd as vain all learned knowledge  Which youth derives from school or college  And said Time only flew to waste  Unless with pleasure wing'd and taste  Full of himself with eager pace  He sought the Sage's dwelling place  Which found like all the forward kind  He left his complaisance behind  Push'd boldly in when lo his fight  Was struck with unforeseen delight  To catch the philosophic Ass  Contemplating a looking glass  Friend SOCRATES the witling cries  Good morningshall I trust these eyes  Can gravity like yours enjoy  So insignificant a toy  I thought a mirror only fit  Where beauty holds the place of wit  A plaything for the young and gay  To fool their vacant hours away  Yet holdperhaps unusual graces  The eye of Contemplation traces  I'll take myself a nicer view  And give so great a man his due  He cock'd  his  glassfor ev'ry Beau  Us'd such two thousand years ago  Then criedYe Gods how fine a creature  What harmony of limb and feature  What eagle eyes how grave a beard  Was ought more perfect ever rear'd  Tho' in the CLOUDS  A Comedy of Aristophanes  you've made me gay  'Tis now but simple truth to say  For elegance of shape and cloaths  You're foremost of Athenian Beaus  Untouch'd with idle hasty passion  By this ironic fool of fashion  The man can bear all rubs in life  Who bore like him a scolding wife  The MORALIST look'd up and smil'd  Then said I must instruct you child  You starenay think me not absurd  You're but a CHILD upon my word  Know Sir that years exceeding twenty  Nor partial fortune shedding plenty  That titles person dress nor gait  Can dignify with man's estate  Beyond all honours show or pelf  Is both  to know  and  rule thyself  This  Mirrour  can if well applied  Assisting Reason checking Pride  Much more instructive lessons teach  Than Folly and her train can reach  Deign sprightly Sir to take a view  'Twas chiefly made for such as you  Soon as it struck Sir FOPLING'S eyes  Distended features show'd surprize  And well to own a truth they might  At such a mortifying sight  For lo the glass beyond a doubt  Had turn'd the reptile inside out  He saw with pain his brainless scull  Of gewgaws and of fashions full  And found that Vice in ev'ry part  Had putrified his wretched heart  Says SOCRATES Good friend what now  Why sits amazement on your brow  Had you but striv'n to deck your mind  Nor all your care to dress confin'd  A fairer prospect then had been  In such a kind reflector seen  Time yet is yoursemploy it better  Nor be to common sense a debtor  Let kind reflection justly tell  The happy art of living well  An art if I can ought discern  Fine Gentlemen want much to learn  The Beau abash'd retir'd in haste  Both disappointed and disgrac'd  FABLE X THE SWALLOW AND PIKE  'TIS common amongst human kind  All errors but our own to find  Nay oft we lay severest blame  When guilty of the very same  What magic pow'r can dim our sight  Or make us look thro' partial light  SELFAPPROBATION thee I call  The dear delusive source of all  The HYPOCRITE with sainted face  Will still hypocrisy disgrace  Lifts up in pray'r his hands and eyes  Unblushing to th' insulted skies  While earthincumber'd thought remains  Fast bound below in worldly chains  Yet calls devotion impious art  Which flows not pure and from the heart  The GAMESTER cries that shame should fix  Her brand upon dishonest tricks  To slip a card or cog a die  He calls the blackest infamy  Yet stake with him he's nothing loth  Whene'er he can to practise both  The ENVIOUS man affects surprize  To hear of grudging hearts or eyes  Tho' all he sees another gain  Infects his worthless mind with pain  NARCISSA'S husband six weeks dead  E'en widow like she chose to wed  AMELIA heard cried Fie for shame  And in a fortnight did the same  LIBERIA whose abandon'd life  With modesty holds constant strife  Exclaims What shame do those deserve  Who cannot keep a just reserve  Thus CENSURE like a shuttlecock  Is bandied round the human flock  And always takes its boldest wing  From those who best deserve its sting  The setting SUN with Eastward beams  Now lightly sparkled o'er the streams  When eager in pursuit of food  An hungry  Swallow  skim'd the flood  Myriads of Flies must death endure  To gorge the feather'd Epicure  Who rather sated with his prey  Turn'd serious work to wanton play  And in his gambols needs must try  How near the water he could fly  So near the rash advent'rer went  To that precarious element  That from his rushencircled bed  A greedy PIKE rais'd up his head  And darting as the SWALLOW pass'd  Catch'd his unthinking victim fast  A pinion broke then let him float  Within the compass of his throat  While thousands and ten thousand flies  Buzz'd loud thanksgiving to the skies  That such an hungry monster's doom  Should be to find a living tomb  The wounded bird made his defence  By thus pretending innocence  What have I done good lordly PIKE  To merit thus your dread dislike  It was beneath your rank to follow  A poor and inoffensive SWALLOW  So mild and tender in his nature  As ne'er to hurt a mortal creature  Audacious wretch the PIKE replied  Of guilt convicted soon as tried  How dares thy coward cunning try  To shelter life with sophistry  Why o'er this river didst thou skim  Was it for profit slave or whim  Didst thou not dare before these eyes  To gorge innumerable Flies  Insects whose right to life tho' small  Equals the greatest of us all  Whose tender fibres crush'd retain  As quick and deep a sense of pain  Besides  my  darling Fish must be  Depriv'd of these unfit for me  Like me thou hast no other right  But greater strength and appetite  If I'm a murd'rer in thy view  The Flies may call thee murd'rer too  Yet still we only follow Man  To prey on what and whom we can  Thus pleading Nature's gen'ral law  He gave the morsel to his maw  FABLE XI THE BIRTH DAY  THE morn was come the brilliant morn  On which Fame said my LORD was born  The courtly SUNwho more polite  Contributed unusual light  The vegetable world was seen  Exhibiting more vivid green  The feather'd songsters tun'd their throats  To louder and more jocund notes  All Nature smil'd and look'd more gay  To honour the auspicious day  Nor could she reason must confess  Do for a TITLED mortal less  Whom twentyone indulgent years  Had ripen'd for the HOUSE of PEERS  At such an aera custom pays  A world of compliments and praise  Mere phantoms of external show  Which from the lip of int'rest flow  For let the selfsame wond'rous man  So worshipp'd by a servile clan  Be stripp'd of titles and estate  He's then no longer good nor great  The BIRTH DAY levee now were come  And marshall'd in the drawing room  A medly of most curious creatures  As diff'rent in designs as features  Here fawning  Priests  with looks demure  In hopes to get a better  cure  Appear'd to grace the friendly croud  And very lowfor livings bow'd  On t' other side the sons of law  Their rev'rence make with distant awe  No counsel sure wou'd ever grudge  A scrape or twoto be a  Judge  Ev'n thy disciples MARS beset  The youthful rising coronet  But where is he the race can shun  When thou Preferment bid'st him run  Thy magic spur can quicken all  To circle round this earthly ball  To combat dangers cares and strife  Nay some to hazard fame with life  Amongst the rest one suitor came  A stranger scarcely known by name  Who acting on a diff'rent plan  Declar'd himself the HONEST MAN  This rustic blade approach'd the peer  I've reach'd he said my ninetieth year  Three score of which young Lord have I  Been tenant to your family  Then let me first with kindness prove  Your patronage and noble love  Tho' plain my coat my heart I trust  Hath ever been in action just  I boldly ask what these conceal  And hope to win what they would steal  Your favournot for selfish end  But more to show myself your friend  I ask not wealth for common sense  Hath made me rich in competence  I ask not titles they must shame  My humble parts and humble name  But ask a boon which you may grant  Nor for another suit or want  Age bows my body to the grave  Remaining time I wish to save  Thus hasting off this stage of strife  Will you bestow some years of life  The youthful Peer whose heart was good  And full as noble as his blood  In sentiments as rank sublime  Perhaps the CARLISLE of his time  Replied I understand thee not  What pow'r have I to change thy lot  Of life or deathyet what is mine  I promise freely shall be thine  I've heard thy worth and dare afford  To bind it with my solemn word  Oh noble youth return'd the fire  May heav'n thy virtuous mind inspire  Each worthy deed of thine will be  A year of added life to me  Thus I may ask without a crime  To lengthen out with joy my time  His Lordship hear'd with smiling face  Then rush'd into a kind embrace  And cried Good father thy request  Shall live for ever in this breast  And far as mortal frailty reaches  I'll practise what thy wisdom teaches  Nor will I specious show regard  But worth in honest men reward  And keep my favours there confin'd  Where virtues ornament the mind  He saidthe levee shrunk away  Like night before the rising day  FABLE XII THE LION AND FOX  A LION full of youthful blood  Who rul'd at large a spacious wood  Whom flatterers had often told  No spear could pierce no toil could hold  Like some amongst the human kind  Was plagu'd with an  ambitious  mind  By birth possess'd with ample store  He sigh'd and vainly wish'd for more  And restless deem'd his royal lot  Pent up within too small a spot  Possess'd of this in waking dreams  He laid ten thousand frantic schemes  Projected conquests far and wide  Extended rule on ev'ry side  Saw savage nations fall before him  And many thousands more adore him  Nay saw in his unbounded plan  His sceptre sway the tyrant man  At length vouchsafing to impart  The mighty purpose of his heart  A FOX who many years had been  Chief actor in each busy scene  And therefore well knew how to fix  The real worth of politics  Who warm'd with patriotic zeal  Preferr'd to gain the common weal  Presum'd without disguise to ask  That he might share his Prince's task  Or haply cool by timely truth  The  ardour  of impetuous youth  Why thus my friend the LION cries  Beyond myself I mean to rise  And more t'exalt my present state  Henceforth to be surnam'dthe GREAT  Thou know'st the forest which lies south  Beyond the Golden Valley's mouth  With awful caves and choice of sport  Where TYGER keeps his mimic court  I'll seize by force the vast domain  To add new strength and grace my reign  From thence with most resistless force  March to the sable river's course  Hurl haughty LEOPARD from his throne  And make that plenteous realm my own  Then our victorious banners wave  'Till ELEPHANT becomes my slave  Inferior princes at my call  Must homage pay and prostrate fall  Thus when a world salutes me King  And boundless nations tribute bring  I'll turn towards my native soil  And there enjoy my glorious toil  The FOX replied Your royal name  My Liege and your immortal fame  Join'd to your happy kingdom's good  I tender dearly as my blood  This forces truth upon my tongue  And pardon claims should I be wrong  Look round and see with calm content  The realm you govern by descent  With Heav'n's best gifts supremely bless'd  With plenty crown'd and joy and rest  See happiness thro' ev'ry part  Diffus'd to glad your princely heart  Each beast with pleasure howls your praise  And views you with admiring gaze  What then should more a  King  rejoice  Than  Loyalty  's approving voice  I know great sir that young in life  Unpractis'd too in martial strife  Ambition  cries Your mighty paw  Should keep the prostrate world in awe  But let the restless source of care  Be banish'd from your bosom far  That fever of an heated mind  To yours and gen'ral safety blind  Suppose for once the fairest view  Which FAME and FORTUNE could pursue  Suppose success with rapid force  Should urge you o'er a downhill course  That ev'ry wind and ev'ry stream  Should waft you tow'rds your golden dream  Nay grant beyong the utmost scope  Of warmest wish and boldest hope  Ten thousand cares unknown before  Surrounding will perplex you more  Our history like that of man  Will contradict your dang'rous plan  For jealous eyes must still pursue  Your conquests with malicious view  Compulsion sage experience shows  An origin of restless foes  And limbs beyond the body grown  May overweigh perhaps your  throne  Next let Reflection's eye advance  And view with care precarious chance  The fate of war in ballance hung  May speak with most persuasive tongue  Let Fancy like a faithful scout  Bring to your sight a total rout  Behold your scatter'd warriors fly  Or vanquish'd in the battle die  With fell revenge the conqu'rors burn  To waste your kingdom in return  On ev'ry side your subjects fall  What pow'r can banish'd life recall  See  Desolation  's dreary face  Glare horrible in ev'ry place  By no restrictive rulers aw'd  See  Famine Murder  stalk abroad  See all which seen makes Nature shrink  And learn my prince betimes to think  You judge perhaps an active mind  In peaceful times too much confin'd  And think with Glory's dreams possess'd  That all but war is slothful rest  Yet  monarchs  in the calmest hour  May show the brightest beams of pow'r  To frame new wholesome laws or give  Due influence to those which live  To banish vice and always be  The bounteous friend of industry  To hold the worthy in regard  And cherish merit with reward  Is sure a safer milder way  To FAME which never can decay  Than that which martial glory leads  While wounded Nature groaning bleeds  This truth my Royal Lord receive  And as you know my love believe  War combats Reason Virtue Sense  Unless declar'd for  selfdefence  In such a case the heart must warm  While  Nature  bids the weakest arm  Repelling wrong protecting  right  Your subjects will with pleasure fight  And bravely dare  Death  's darkest frown  To save their  freedom  and your  crown  Then Sir to grace your royal blood  Shine truly GREAT in being GOOD  FABLE XIII THE PHILOSOPHER AND RATTLE  A Solemn port a brow austere  Abstracted pride and mind severe  Contempt by looks and language shown  For all opinions but its own  Cloaths made to contradict the fashion  Of any age and ev'ry nation  With conversation most sublime  Which calls amusement waste of time  Have often seem'd yet ne'er could be  Nature's best guide  Philosophy  A wight of this sequester'd stamp  Who long had o'er the midnight lamp  With less of profit than of pains  Begloom'd his mind and rack'd his brains  Defrauding Nature of her due  In constant search of something new  'Till overloaded with the weight  Of knowledge Reason left her seat  For as the body so the head  May possibly be overfed  And haply wanting proper vent  May turn to  poison nourishment  A wight like this relates our tale  Who weigh'd each thought in Logic's scale  Once met perchance a sprightly child  With youth and pleasure almost wild  Who shaking his new  rattle  ran  And thus address'd this learned man  As children free from selfish care  Like those enjoyments best they share  See here good Sir the pretty thing  Mama has bought her  little king  Come take it in your hand and play  As I dolook youhere's the way  So freely spoke the prattling boy  And thought to give our Stoic joy  Who took his bauble with a frown  ThenFrom the cottage to the crown  'Tis folly all alike he cries  How few endeavour to be wise  Nor is it strange since youth are taught  An idle vacancy of thought  By parents giving approbation  To implements of dissipation  Like this on ev'ry slight pretence  Which flatt'ring  Fancy  murder  Sense  He said and with contempt profound  His hand discharg'd it to the ground  The boy in simple wonder gaz'd  His little heart shrunk back amaz'd  A doubtful cloud o'erhung each eye  He knew not which to laugh or cry  But soon the RATTLE found a tongue  To answer such indignant wrong  For be it known that injur'd wood  Can scold as well as flesh and blood  Why how now whence such surly looks  Thou overbearing man of books  I dare assert and speak with reason  That all things have their proper season  And toys like me are well design'd  To entertain a childish mind  My name perhaps begets disdain  In one like you of knowledge vain  But pause a whilelike PROTEUSI  The force of various shapes can try  And play my parts on Nature's stage  To please all ranks and ev'ry age  Sometimes like Glory's brightest gem  To  kings  I come a diadem  Before the  Curate  's eyes I'm drawn  In form of most attractive lawn  The  Lawyer  with ambition big  Admires me in a  Judge  's wig  The  Soldier  I can vanquish soon  In pleasing shape of a battoon  The  Merchant  having bought and sold  Retiring finds me in his gold  To  Turtle  turn'dI still secure  Each gormandizing  Epicure  I hit the Bacchanalian's vein  In sparkling flasks of brisk champaign  The  Beau  I catch as well as brute  When chang'd into a birthday suit  A  A  famous racehorse  GIMCRACK to the racing crew  I skim the plain and they pursue  The ALLEY knaves I catch in flocks  Transform'd to precious rising stocks  Convey'd in fair CORINNA'S smiles  My shade her lover's care beguiles  The ladies too in ev'ry state  By diff'rent forms I captivate  Sometimes I catch the fair one's view  With plunder of enchanting  loo  Now chang'd to di'mond solitaire  VANINA gives me all her care  A coronet and equipage  In me another's heart engage  A fourth admits me through her eyes  In form of oaths and vows and sighs  Both young and old both high and low  Alike to me attachment show  Ev'n you with all your learning sense  Against my pow'r have no defence  For howsoe'er in words you battle  Your  summum bonum's  but a RATTLE  FABLE XIV THE COCK AND POINTER  COURAGE which serves a worthy end  The virtuous and the wise commend  Who likewise judge by certain rule  That headlong rashness marks a fool  Making such worth as might adorn  The source of perils pain and scorn  A COCK who oft in bloody fray  Had borne the VICTOR'S prize away  Tho' not without indented scars  Heroic signals of his wars  By frequent conquests grew so vain  That glory turn'd his martial brain  And made the images of fight  Haunt all his wishes day and night  A feather'd QUIXOTE fit for battle  With men with windmills or with cattle  For if he might his prowess show  He valued not what kind of foe  One day an honest POINTER went  With humble competence content  To scrape the dunghill for a bone  Which having hid he thought his own  The COCK observ'd with jealous eye  Crow'd clapp'd his wings and drawing nigh  Declar'd by all the pow'rs of fate  No thief should plunder his estate  The DOG by converse gentle made  Gave smooth reply tho' not afraid  And said With diff'rent tastes we're born  I feed on  flesh  you relish  corn  What variance then should make us jar  I hate I own the thoughts of war  And would in social concord rest  With ev'ry kind of bird and beast  Save when my master's net or gun  Requires in search of game to run  The COCK replied A coward still  Can find evasions if he will  Know that my just resentment soon  Shall teach thee distance vile poltroon  No less a  Spaniard  in thy heart  Than in thy name and outward part  Thus learnso saying slapp'd a stroke  You'll find it reptile more than joke  The DOG unhurt kept scratching on  And only bade the COCK begone  Who sure of conquest struck some blows  Which wounded PONTO'S tender nose  Whose patience lost a single bite  Concluded the unequal fight  Sir CHANTICLEER scream'd out and dy'd  A Martyr to his foolish pride  FABLE XV THE CYNIC AND FASHION  SOME think on ev'ry slight pretence  That snarling shows a fund of sense  And therefore shrewdly never fail  Reason or none to mouth and rail  As if the scope of moral thought  Lay all compriz'd in finding fault  It happen'd so that one of these  A thorough bred DIOGENES  That sprightly damsel FASHION met  And lectur'd thus the gay Coquette  'Tis true I know fantastic madam  Thou foe to all the race of ADAM  Thou thing of nothing gaudy moppet  No better than a dress'd up puppet  I know thy pow'r thy matchless pride  That reason has the weaker side  Yet dare I speak my thoughts aloud  Tho' Fancy sways the senseless crowd  And show that all thy flimzy rules  Are cobweb bands to fetter  fools  How dar'st thou trifler as thou art  Presume to rule the human heart  To captivate the thoughtless eyes  And warp the nobler faculties  Degrading sense and studious care  With empty taste and idle air  Thy proselytes a coxcomb train  Of outward show alone are vain  Who still to real merit blind  Enslav'd by dress neglect the mind  Say what avails thy splendid show  Tho' colours rival IRIS' bow  Tho' jewels from the INDIAN mine  Arrang'd in nicest order shine  Tho' ev'ry quarter of the globe  Should join thy person to enrobe  Thy proper title still must be  The Weathercock of  Vanity  FASHION with sly and gentle look  Receiv'd this  cynical  rebuke  Then smiling  shrewdly thus  replied  There are more sorts than one of  Pride  A weed so rankin every college  It chokes fair science learning knowledge  Look inward surly friend and see  If such a monster dwells in thee  Let objects in due form arise  And sense obey impartial eyes  While prejudice invades the mind  'Tis ever obstinate or blind  Think you grave Sir that wisdom shows  With better grace in shapeless cloaths  That Virtue speaks with stronger note  In longer or in shorter coat  That learning dare not show its face  Beneath a little harmless lace  Must piety upon her back  Still wear a formal robe of black  Can none expire in honour's bed  But martial spirits bound in red  'Tis all a farce and none but fools  Would judge by such contracted rules  You've boldly charged me home with treason  Against the sacred power of reason  But wherefore so all things on earth  From some good purpose draw their birth  And rightly manag'd serve to bless  Yet when perverted by excess  Slaves of irrational abuse  They lose their beauty worth and use  Thus I by prudence first was made  A friend to industry and trade  My purposes will proof endure  I please the  rich  to feed the  poor  I rule the great with my commands  And set to work unnumber'd hands  From my inconstant temper springs  To subjects wealth and pow'r to kings  Divided between land and sea  Millions derive support from me  Indeed when mimic folly breaks  Discretion's bounds and wildly takes  My shape I always feel disgrace  With painful blushes tinge my face  To see forgetting diff'rent spheres  Mechanics boldly apeing peers  To see fine ladies Abigails  Drag silken trains like Peacocks tails  To see the wife of homely cit  Attempt the stile of courtly wit  To see an ALDERMAN advance  In capers newly brought from FRANCE  To see a  flaunting semstress  come  To figure at a lady's drum  To see a draggled prentice sent  With cards of illspelt compliment  To see the sordid slave of vice  A LONDON merchant trade with DICE  To see all these and many more  Which life affords in ample store  May raise your censure or compassion  But call them MADNESS friend not FASHION  FABLE XVI THE ROYAL DOVE  EXAMPLE streaming from the great  Thro' each department of a state  Should as untainted snow be fair  And spread around with virtuous care  For be it either good or bad  Most ranks are fashionably mad  An EAGLE who had seen with pain  Licentiousness extend its reign  Whose more than usual patriot eye  Saw most in birds of  quality  Saw marriage like compulsive tether  His lords and ladies link together  With scarce a spark of love to light  The scanty space of wedding night  Who saw gallants and mistresses  The sev'ral parties better please  Who saw destructive cards and dice  In triumph lead domestic vice  Who saw a love of foreign fashions  With endless idle dissipations  Infect bats owls and carrion crows  As well as gaudy wellplum'd beaus  Who saw discretion yield to pride  But chiefly on the female side  Kindly resolv'd by wisdom led  A partner for his royal bed  That subjects looking to the throne  From Virtues there might form their own  The proselyte of prudent love  He fix'd his choice upon a DOVE  Whom Nature had with partial care  Created good as well as fair  With open hand Benevolence  The child of Virtue and of Sense  Dispers'd her various bounties round  With multitudes of blessings crown'd  A constant and engaging mate  She smooth'd her consort's cares of state  Whose captive heart each coming day  Own'd more and more her gentle sway  Which never aim'd at any pow'r  But that of sweet'ning ev'ry hour  Mothers from her might fully prove  The raptures of maternal love  And sure no offspring ever could  Bring more of joy or public good  Mild condescension smooth'd her brow  And taught ill judging pride to bow  Whene'er she coo'd the subjects hung  With rapture on her tuneful tongue  And those were ever most admir'd  Who catch'd that goodness she inspir'd  Each couple like the ROYAL PAIR  Still sympathiz'd in joy and care  Till HYMEN with peculiar grace  Was seen to smile in ev'ry place  Ev'n fickle wanton Sparrows now  Would fashionably keep their vow  Perfect in ev'ry scene of life  Review'd as mother friend or wife  The truly ROYAL DOVE was seen  To act to coo to look the QUEEN  With charming form and gentle mind  Almost the CHARLOTTE of her kind  FABLE XVII THE ROMAN AND BARBARIAN  WHEN ROME was in her height of glory  So find we in historic story  Struck with her universal fame  A travelling BARBARIAN came  Who wish'd in all her parts to see  That boasted seat of liberty  A CITIZEN engag'd to show  The stranger all he wish'd to know  O'er all her sev'n proud hills they stray'd  And various observations made  The ROMAN pointing to his guest  Those prospects which he fancied best  There view our CAPITOL he cries  Stupendous subject of surprize  Where sits our SENATE framing law  To keep the conquer'd world in awe  Examine with punctilious care  This spacious AMPHITHEATRE  Where thronging nations may find room  Such is its large capacious womb  Behold with reverence profound  Our vast PANTHEON'S sacred round  Where wisely suited to the place  Our imag'd Gods give hallow'd grace  Behold this Column tow'ring high  Which seems to emulate the sky  Those BATHS superbseecurious sight  Are fram'd for profit and delight  View hence the sun his lustre beam  To gild majestic TYBER'S stream  By which our plenteous city gains  The produce of unnumber'd plains  Look round in short on ev'ry part  Then freely speak and from your heart  If Art and Nature so combin'd  With elegance and grandeur join'd  E'er struck your ravish'd eyes before  Your footsteps trod the ROMAN shore  Here the BARBARIAN for that name  Those proud monopolists of Fame  The ROMANS gave with partial sneer  To all beyond their native sphere  Admitted on a curious view  The sev'ral observations true  Yet seem'd to say that solid sense  Ne'er doated on magnificence  Did all says he this grandeur come  By lawful means to lordly ROME  For why should many nations groan  To deck a city not their own  Were she by emulative trade  In wealth and pow'r superior made  Did she not gain her boasted charms  By rapine and the force of arms  Could all her pompous marks of state  Avert th' unerring shafts of fate  For once she must her ruin mourn  Like other empires in her turn  Could pow'r and grandeur time defy  Nor ROMANS like BARBARIANS die  Could they procure a better lot  In future worlds when here forgot  Could they on life's precarious stage  But add one scene to failing age  Could they from sickness take its pains  Or harmonize disorder'd brains  Could they with kind instructive art  Inform the head and mend the heart  Could they the hours mispent recal  And shed Divine Content on all  The world might then with justice come  And worship your unrival'd ROME  But as it isexcuse a truth  Not the less certain tho' uncouth  Since sure it cannot be denied  They only serve to pamper pride  FABLE XVIII THE POLITIC LION  IN life no error more appears  Than ill adapted characters  Who would not either laugh or cry  The contrast of philosophy  To see a valiant soldier loll  And slumber in a Prebend's stall  Devoid of Piety and Knowledge  Who shames EELIGION and the COLLEGE  His morals nought but outward show  And shines a most irrev'rend beau  What other feelings strike the heart  To see the grave PHYSICIAN'S part  Disgrac'd by those as oft is seen  Who good mechanics might have been  To see a genius form'd for trade  A blund'ring  Pettyfogger  made  To see a farming country Squire  Sent up a silent Knight o' th' shire  To see a Poet or Musician  Commencing shallow Politician  In short to see as sense must own  So many men turn'd upside down  And Reason's dictates cast aside  By Folly Avarice or Pride  When each man in a proper place  Might act his part with decent grace  A LION who with sov'reign sway  The forest rul'done council day  Among the subject beasts declar'd  That he and they must stand prepar'd  A most tremendous war to wage  Demanding wisdom strength and rage  Let all he cries take proper spheres  And all who march be volunteers  In ev'ry enterprize we find  There's nothing like a willing mind  You BRUIN whom we henceforth call  Our Mustermaster General  Collect our  Warriors  with such speed  As suits a time of pressing need  For this the wisest means pursue  Ourself  will take the grand  review  His royal Mandate spread about  All royal beasts began their route  The HARE and ASS with others came  Thro'  Duty  more than love of  Fame  Whom when the cynic Bear beheld  With savage laugh he shook the field  Then said with an ironic sneer  Oh welcome valiant creatures here  What Monarchs shrink at war's alarms  When such as you cry outTo arms  Heroes  for boundless conquest made  Of nothing but disgrace afraid  The bashful couple in dismay  Held down their heads and slunk away  Too often modest worth and sense  Give place to harden'd impudence  Just then the LION passing by  Beheld them with indulgent eye  And having kindly ask'd their cases  Declar'd they should be fix'd in places  Which certainly tho' not so great  As many others in the state  Had still their worth and were of use  Beyond the reach of proud abuse  Then turning to the BEAR he cry'd  How durst you Sir indulge your pride  If you had been as wise as strong  Your sense would then have check'd your tongue  Good subjects must be dear to me  Whether of high or low degree  Indeed should I so grossly err  Unworthy creatures to prefer  Should I so far from prudence wander  To make an ASS or HARE commander  My subjects might with cause complain  And stigmatize my simple reign  But while I with impartial spirit  Pay due regard to honest merit  While just gradation forward leads  And beasts are valu'd for their deeds  They'll well perform their sev'ral parts  And I reign Monarch of their hearts  Those creatures you so much disdain  When thus dispos'd shall credit gain  The  Stentor  ass shall loudly rattle  And bray with martial soundTo battle  And on occasion help to bear  Provisionswhile this nimble Hare  Shall serve for which you'll all confess  She's well design'd to go express  To scout and watch with curious eye  The motions of our  enemy  Thus or my judgment is outwitted  Their bus'ness and their pow'rs are fitted  In movements of a grand machine  Small wheels as well as great are seen  So may the least in any nation  Be put into an useful station  And PUBLIC good will flourish most  Where each supplies his proper post  FABLE XIX THE CHARIOTEER  A CHARIOTEER not one of those  Who gallop'd in OLYMPIC shows  But one who on NEWMARKET'S sod  Was worship'd as a DemiGod  Who out of any thing could hatch  The praise or profit of a MATCH  Inspir'd with most heroic glee  High mounted on a VIS A VIS  Which to a second he could drive  Or turn with any man alive  Was posting on a glowing pace  For Time and he were match'd a race  His brother CHARIOTEER the Sun  His daily course had almost run  Impatient for an ev'ning's nap  In gentle THETIS' watry lap  When driving up a steepy hill  Which somewhat check'd impatient will  As horses be they e'er so good  Are still no more than flesh and blood  It chanc'd our rattlepated wit  O'ertook an easy jogging  cit  Of whom he ask'd in modish stile  Damn it old boy how many mile  To such a place and have I pow'r  To reach itGeeupin an hour  An hourold Slow and Sure replies  Tis near the rate a Pigeon flies  And tho' your tits are high bred things  I cannot yet discern their wings  Their gaping mouths with foam o'erspread  And

gainbelieve me friend  By slower pace your journey's end  The mettled blade of spirit proud  Disdain'd advice and laugh'd aloud  Then swore politely by the Gods  Old Shaver must have ta'en the odds  Exulting thus whipp'd sharp his cattle  Who sprung and made the carriage rattle  Scarce had he gone three hundred yards  Ere adverse fate his course retards  A failing wheel with crashing noise  The speed of sanguine hope destroys  And on the ground in full career  Lays low th' astonish'd CHARIOTEER  Who curs'd the chance in modish phrase  And star'd around with stupid gaze  The sober CIT came jogging on  And saw dismounted PHAETON  He saw the prostrate ruin lie  On which he cast a leering eye  And thus address'd with taunting sneer  I did not think to catch you here  Tho' as you drove so very fast  I thought to overtake at last  Thus you young Sir like many more  In Fortune rich in Reason poor  Drive headlong on nor ever think  How near you are to danger's brink  If ever you have been at school  You might have learn'd this useful rule  For young or old for grave or gay  Wisely to keep the middle way  A common Proverb has decreed  The more we haste the worse we speed  Yet some with prudence still at strife  Post neck or nothing on thro' life  But softfarewelfor more delay  Will too much check my stinted way  The sun declining loses light  I wish you luckless friend good night  FABLE XX THE ANGEL AND HERMIT  A STATESMAN who as records tell  Could vie in fame with MACHIAVEL  Had serv'd his country sev'ral years  With able head in diff'rent spheres  And strange to tell had play'd his part  Ev'n  Envy  own'd with honest heart  Tho' sometimes stung with partial blame  To cramp if not to taint his fame  A certain tho' a cruel case  Sad consequence and tax of place  At length impatient of the weight  Which hangs on those who guide a state  His mind its secret wishes bent  In solitude to seek content  Soon as Reflection had inspir'd  The pleasing prospect he retir'd  Fix'd on a lonely rural spot  And chang'd his palace for a cot  His levees for th' illustrious dead  Whom in their living works he read  All equipage was drop'd of course  Or shrunk into a single horse  On whom he rode for sake of health  Which Wisdom owns the richest wealth  Art had not with affected grace  Deform'd this native lovely place  Where variegated prospects grew  Successively to charm the view  Where Nature thro' the landscape smil'd  A picture beautifully wild  Where Study found a still retreat  And Virtue seem'd to fix her seat  One day reclining in a shade  By overspreading poplars made  Dispos'd at large to ruminate  Our voluntary HERMIT sate  And safe he thought from list'ning ear  Thus prais'd his calm contented sphere  Hail a sequester'd stateall hail  On woodcrown'd hill or flow'ry vale  Where mind and body both advance  Their faculties by temperance  Where smiling Health around us sails  Enbosom'd in refreshing gales  Where FACTION with discordant voice  No more can interrupt my joys  Where ENVY with her pois'nous tongue  No more can taint my fame with wrong  Where smiling fairfac'd heartless friends  No more will haunt for selfish ends  Where Treach'ry darkest fiend of Hell  Will never seek my humble cell  Thrice happy thou sequester'd state  Who but the frantic would be great  How mean to be AMBITION'S slave  Ambition Virtue's certain grave  How many years of toilsome life  Imbitter'd by continual strife  Tho' with unbounded honours grac'd  Have I unthinking run to waste  Oh welcome then the calmer reign  Of sage reflection with her train  Of rational and mild delights  With healthful days and peaceful nights  Which solitude thy charms declare  Untainted by corroding care  Let vain idolaters of Fame  Pay homage to a sounding name  Let them enjoy the smiles of things  With titles stars and silken strings  Let Soldiers tread the martial field  And teach their vanquish'd foes to yield  Let them possess the savage joy  Like raging tempests to destroy  Let Merchants toil from coast to coast  In search of what they worship most  And brave all perils of the main  In search of theemost pow'rful Gain  Let Lawyers wrangleStatesmen scheme  The fabric of a golden dream  My part in bustling scenes is o'er  And Fortune can afflict no more  Thrice happy then sequester'd state  Who but the frantic would be great  Here as he endedfrom a cloud  Which serv'd him for a silver shroud  A lightencircled ANGEL came  Who hail'd the HERMIT by his name  Then said I've heard thy full pretence  To solitude and abstract sense  Which shows no more in Reason's eye  Than unsubstantial sophistry  If man is form'd of social kind  The duties of his station bind  To play an active part in life  Howe'er perplex'd with cares and strife  Withdrawing to inglorious rest  Is indolence or fear at best  A profitless and mean escape  Unworthy of the human shape  'Tis own'd that crowns are painful things  That care may haunt the best of Kings  Yet making many millions blest  Must calm the mind and give it rest  Can any feel such joy of heart  As they who act a  Patriot  part  There lies the worth of being great  And true preeminence of state  In solitude you seem to say  That VIRTUE rules with settled sway  But know that passions in restraint  Amidst  temptations  form the  saint  A  sot  if unsupplied with wine  Must drunkenness perforce resign  A  thief  by locks and bars shut out  May boast of honesty no doubt  Yet characters like these I trust  Are neither sober deem'd nor just  Suppose your worth and what more hard  Had fail'd to meet a just reward  That errors of capricious pow'r  Darken'd your welldevoted hour  Suppose thro' hate or want of sense  Some schemes were cross'd on false pretence  Should Reason give resentment scope  Creating thence  a misanthrope  Of ev'ry Vice which man has tried  None's worse than overbearing PRIDE  Accustom'd to direct her helm  Why should you leave your native realm  In danger to be tempesttost  Perhaps her pilot wanting lost  With love of rural ease inspir'd  If like the ROMAN you retir'd  Prepar'd with patriot Love to stand  The bulwark of your native land  So far with Reason on your side  Retirement might be justified  Yet those whose talents most excel  Should study most the public weal  No meaner wretch can Nature own  Than he who lives for SELF alone  FABLE XXI THE PROUD ASS  APERT and selfsufficient ASS  Not half so wise as BALAAM'S was  Who pass'd a round of daily care  In hawking goods from  fair  to  fair  Through ervy was so void of sense  He scorn'd a decent competence  For such tho' born an abject slave  His more than tender master gave  One day a pamper'd steed pass'd on  Deck'd out in rich caparison  A mettled creature full of fire  And shap'd like his ARABIAN sire  At whom our ASS with mournful sigh  Strait cast a tearencircled eye  Then turning to his owner said  How dearly do I earn my bread  Not that I bear too great a load  Nor often feel your painful goad  But then unkindly you neglect  To gain me as you might  respect  Pray what's yon  prancer  more than me  To merit so much finery  Where'er he comes the Hostler shows  Attention to his gaudy cloaths  The freshest hay supplies his rack  A currycomb runs o'er his back  And best of wheaten straw is spread  Beneath his hoofs to form a bed  While I with paltry pannier clad  The very thought would make one mad  Tho' doom'd to labour still more hard  Can never meet with just regard  If beauty be his foremost claim  I justly may produce the same  Allowing for these certain words  That "feathers fine make finest birds"  Then master if you'd have me live  A saddlecloth with trimmings give  Upon this head such bridle place  As may adorn this comely face  A net were well to strike the sight  No matter whether green or white  Besides 'twould guard my tender thighs  In summer from perplexing flies  With ribbands plait my tail and mane  So let me just importance gain  Or soon expect that settled grief  Will weigh me down beyond relief  For sure no other means can save  Your faithful creature from the grave  The PEDLAR foolish as his beast  Complied with all the fond request  And deck'd the ASS with simple care  Then led him to a crouded FAIR  Where gazing hundreds stop'd his way  And kept the rareeshow at bay  Our longear'd  Beau  assuming state  Would mimic too the managed gait  While many a rude and painful thump  Saluted him from head to rump  Much laughter and a world of jokes  Accompanied the merry strokes  Some curses too from either side  Were vented on his foolish pride  Till terrified he bray'd aloud  Submission to the shouting crowd  And promis'd thenceforth to appear  In trappings suited to his sphere  A maxim some of human kind  Would worthy heir observance find  For pride betrays each forward fool  To all the stings of ridicule  FABLE XXII THE LAWYER AND FOX  IT happen'd once a son of law  Who kept three market towns in awe  Who in his most important look  All LITTLETON convey'd and COOKE  Tho' neither had he ever read  To furnish out a tricking head  For Nature gave sufficient art  To play the pettifogging part  One Golden Rule who practis'd long  "To do no rightnor suffer wrong"  Resolv'd to war against the FOX  Who nightly stole his feather'd flocks  Shall REYNARD cried old  Nisi Prius  Not plunder only but defy us  Shall such a thief my poultry fleece  My Ducks my Turkies Hens and Geese  Nay more last night his maw to cram  He robb'd me of a fatted Lamb  I'm now resolv'd to set a trap  And should I catch the slipp'ry chap  With oaken towel first I'll bang him  And then upon a gibbet hang him  The FOX so matters came to pass  Who with strict zeal kept MICHAELMAS  By eating GOOSEupon its Eve  Went slyly laughing in his sleeve  To pick up oneoh harden'd sinner  For his and spouse's annual dinner  The morning clock with drowsy tone  Upon its bell had just struck one  In dreamless balmy slumbers blest  Ev'n village curs were lull'd to rest  No longer flow'd the murm'ring rill  Which serv'd to work a neighb'ring mill  Love wakeful God no vigil kept  And HODGE forgetting MOPSY slept  Silence and darkness most profound  Enwrapp'd the fearless village round  When REYNARD reach'd the LAWYER'S yard  And ran direct O Fortune hard  Where lay the trap there found too late  The iron grasp of cruel fate  He struggled vainly to get loose  And curs'd his foolish Love of GOOSE  The morn at length in saffron robe  Came gayly smiling o'er the globe  Attended by the jocund hours  And all her vivifying pow'rs  When from his roost descending low  Sir CHANTICLEER prepar'd to crow  The captive saw when in dismay  He scream'd and wing'd his fearful way  Dame PARTLETT heard the dire alarm  Sure signal of approaching harm  Obey'd the well known faithful sound  And like its echo flutter'd round  Ducks Geese and Turkies join'd the cry  With such prevailing energy  That from his bed the LAWYER rose  With haste which disregarded cloaths  And ran directly to the place  Where culprit lay in doleful case  Whom when he saw with raptur'd eyes  I've caught thee then at last he cries  And will myself both judge and jury  Let loose upon thee all my fury  Thou murd'rous rogue infernal thief  Of all consummate villains chief  For nothing that I know of good  But basely shedding helpless blood  A ling'ring fate shall stop thy breath  And give thee inch by inch to death  Poor REYNARD heard the dreadful doom  And wish'd the LAWYER in his room  He trembled yet resolv'd to die  With most heroic dignity  And now beyond the verge of Hope  He gave his tongue its utmost scope  Shall I he cried sustain abuse  Nor let tho' bound resentment loose  Be silent while a monster talks  Because upon two legs he walks  And boasts of something Reason nam'd  Which all his actions have disclaim'd  A monster shameful to his kind  To ev'ry honest feeling blind  With tongue of guile with heart of flint  And soul of villainy the  mint  What you Sir LAWYER thieving call  In FOXES is no crime at all  Impell'd by Nature we pursue  Our destin'd game with honest view  To satisfyand what more right  The urgent calls of appetite  Nor seek with avaricious skill  For sake of sordid gain to kill  Besides no FOX e'er robs his brother  But mankind plunder one another  And such as you are doubly curst  Of all the human robbers worst  Who find in ev'ry case a flaw  And JUSTICE put to flight by LAW  If then of right you make a plea  For partial sentence pass'd on me  Resign at once your ill got pelf  And much more justly hang yourself  FABLE XXIII THE CONQUEROR AND CAPTIVE  SUCCESS intoxicates the brain  And sometimes makes the wisest vain  Who that examines age or youth  Can controvert so plain a truth  That sees false Fame or solid pelf  So much increase important self  That LILLIPUTIAN worth can rise  A mighty BROBDIGNAG in size  Thence mild benevolence is lost  And tyrant pride assumes its post  It happen'd oncesuppose the time  The regal titles and the clime  There reign'd a Prince of mighty pow'r  Who having much still wanted more  Who Frenchman like with envious eye  Beheld the realms of liberty  And still for war would frame pretence  Of glory stain'd or self defence  Behold him to the field burst forth  An emblem of the boist'rous North  When with its most tempestuous gales  It desolates hills woods and dales  His oft try'd martial prowess spread  Through neighb'ring states a gen'ral dread  An ape of mighty CAESAR'S name  He went he saw and overcame  O'er bulwark'd towns he made his way  While ravish'd conquest own'd his sway  One kingdom gain'd the next he view'd  With eyes ambitious and pursu'd  FORTUNE that vain capricious dame  Who eager seem'd to urge his fame  Like other ladies then most pleas'd  When most sollicited and teas'd  With partial grace still deign'd to bless  His boldest actions with success  Whose only business was to fight  Whate'er the cause or wrong or right  Till glutted he at length declined  T' indulge the fever of his mind  Yet fond of pomp and madly vain  He brought in his triumphant train  SIX CAPTIVE KINGS sad spoil of war  To draw like beasts his splendid car  The day was fix'd when such a sight  He thought would give the throng delight  By various means most subjects strove  To show their loyalty and love  Arches  were rais'd and trophies plac'd  In ev'ry spot which might be grac'd  The VICTOR almost deified  By popular applause and pride  Could scarce vouchsafe to cast his eye  On any thing beneath the sky  And silently appear'd to say  All Nature must admit my sway  At length a downward look he gave  And chanc'd to view one ROYAL SLAVE  Who turning ey'd with thought profound  The chariot wheel that circled round  The placid smile which o'er his face  Had shed a mild peculiar grace  The easy air and just disdain  With which he wore his golden chain  Alarm'd the VICTOR who demanded  What his attention so commanded  My mind the Captive cries is bent  To calm misfortunes with content  As in that circling wheel I see  Of life the brief epitome  The part which now is highest must  One single turn replace in dust  So thou tho' present laurels bloom  May ere thy bones shall reach the tomb  By some inverted stroke of fate  Have cause to mourn thy fallen state  Without a friend to sooth thy care  None follow  Tyrants  in despair  While vulture Conscience stings thy mind  For endless wrongs to human kind  The greatest Prince should learn this truth  That sure as age succeeds to youth  So Time devouring swallows all  Empires themselves but rise to fall  However glorious and renown'd  Since life is but a varying round  Swift as an arrow to the heart  Conviction sent her pointed dart  Pride wish'd indeed to stop its course  But yielded to resistless force  And said that she would taint no more  The bosom of the Conqueror  Who from the CAR descending gave  His hand to ev'ry ROYAL SLAVE  Unloos'd their shackles and declar'd  His pow'r should henceforth be their guard  Should stand a barrier to the weak  And all oppression's fetters break  The CAPTIVES struck due homage paid  And for their kind deliverer pray'd  More careful now of native blood  The unshaken friend of peace he stood  Disbanded Conquest with her train  For virtues of a Patriot reign  And long the royal pleasure prov'd  Of being much less  fear'd  than  lov'd  FABLE XXIV THE MAGPYE AND LARK  A MAGPYE who with constant rattle  Could fast as any gossip prattle  A forward pert conceited elf  Enraptur'd with delightful self  Beheld a LARK who sung hard by  With much contempt and scornful eye  The songster heard with patient ears  A multitude of daily sneers  And bore them all howe'er absurd  Nor answer'd once the coxcomb bird  But like a wise domestic did  Whate'er his tender master bid  No business minded but his own  And studied grateful songs alone  No SPARTAN in the pilf'ring art  Could play with more success his part  Than did the MAGPYE when set free  To bear young master company  Whate'er his bill and strength could take  He bore away for mischief's sake  For things thus lost if servants fought  'Twas happiness supreme he thought  His mistress too he told of all  Which in the kitchen could befall  What sweethearts were admitted there  How long they staid and what their fare  Nor could the maidens undescried  A secret dish of tea provide  Nay rather tattler like than fail  He'd soon invent a curious tale  One morning all he thought at rest  The greatest knaves are fools at best  In triumph to the LARK he cries  What ho you warbler of the skies  If any spirit fir'd your heart  How could you act this humdrum part  Thus idly pass an useless age  Within the limits of your cage  And only strain with empty note  Your most unprofitable throat  While I'm so active in the house  I scarcely miss a stirring mouse  I see I hear and straight unfold  Whate'er may make our mistress scold  Who loves you know or right or wrong  To exercise her  ceaseless  tongue  And when I've made a hideous pother  Flings me some nice tit bit or other  Besides it is my constant plan  To steal and hide whate'er I can  Then shrewdly tell the servant's name  I wish to brand with loss and shame  Thus little short as I can see  Of human wit and policy  My happy talents are display'd  Of nothing but our CAT afraid  While you so little notice claim  Scarce once a week I hear your name  And like the wild ones of your breed  Have no regale but sod or seed  A servant maid at morning's break  By Love or Conscience kept awake  Heard MAGGY'S tale when fir'd with rage  She flew directly to his cage  Then seiz'd him and with many a thump  Convey'd him underneath the pump  Where dous'd and drench'd almost to death  While yet he drew some doubtful breath  Tattler LARDELLA cry'd take that  Then threw him to the hungry CAT  The LARK who heard but did not see  This boaster's sad catastrophe  Reflected thus designing Knaves  To sordid selfish passions slaves  Assisted by dishonest guile  'Tis true may shine in life awhile  But where at length is all their gain  Enjoying sweets to purchase pain  To boast I find with vicious pride  Of useful talents misapplied  A knavish heart and tattling tongue  From whence arises social wrong  Will haply bring or soon or late  Repentance with untimely fate  On no ambitious purpose bent  With competence and ease content  I envy not the brightest parts  Devoted to pernicious arts  Let me enjoy the songster said  An honest Heart and peaceful Head  FABLE XXV THE FINE LADY AND THE SUN  WRETCHES there are and many too  Whose wishes only  self  pursue  Let partial Fortune deign to grant  Whate'er their whims or passions want  They value not should mankind all  To sure and swift perdition fall  A female more than HELEN fair  Whose beauty was her fav'rite care  Assaulted by meridian heat  Sought out in vain a cool retreat  The glowing air now grown intense  Thro' each apartment gave offence  Which caus'd her so relates our tale  Against the SUN himself to rail  I wonder says the dainty dame  That such a vile obnoxious flame  So rude to fashionable eyes  Should ev'ry day ascend the skies  Or quitting of a distant sphere  Be suffer'd to approach so near  Spotless as new descended snow  In Winter's happy time I show  But when the Summer's heat takes place  Six horrid FRECKLES shame my face  Nor dare I paintoh dire vexation  For fear of dreadful  perspiration  I wish kind heav'n eternal night  Adorn'd with milder candlelight  Would rule the world with kindly sway  And banish telltale useless day  Who hears from love so sweet a sound  As when with friendly darkness crown'd  No needless blushes then disgrace  With aukward shame a lady's face  How often does this Sun advance  To spoil a game of cards or dance  What jewels can so brightly blaze  Outlust'red by his rival rays  What charms so faultless can appear  When his revealing light is near  Which never suffers friendly art  To play with kind disguise its part  'Tis hence that nymphs upon the green  Are to the most advantage seen  And rural beauties oft outvie  A Wldgrveor a Cvnty  Oh that a kind eclipse would take  His pow'r away for Beauty's sake  And with a mild nocturnal robe  Cloath for  my  life at least the Globe  Or if ye Gods he still must rise  Confine him to mechanic eyes  What soul of spirit can endure  To share him with the vulgar poor  The list'ning Sun who heard from high  Wing'd on a beam this just reply  Know brainless creature void of sense  Thy railing cannot give offence  The course of Nature's perfect frame  Is proofagainst thy feeble blame  Yet to chastise thy empty prate  And end this frothy pert debate  Hear then and own thy vacant heart  Prompts thee to play an ideot part  Think'st thou variety is shown  To please or profit thee alone  Think'st thou the seasons go and come  Like ladies from or to a  drum  That Earth and Water Sky and Air  Are only form'd to make thee fair  Thou say'st that I am Beauty's foe  Whence comes the Rose's healthful glow  Who paints to thy delighted view  The LILLY white the VIOLET blue  Who gives the fragrant PINK perfume  Who bids the gaudy TULIP bloom  Whose pow'r the tillage can adorn  With golden crops of wavy corn  Who animates each rural scene  And mantles o'er the fields with green  Whatever grows or walks or flies  Without my kind assistance dies  Ev'n thou vain child of common clay  Without my vivifying ray  Disrob'd of all thy trinkets must  Return with speed to parent dust  There by thy modish friends forgot  Soon as the poorest slave to rot  Thou little dost who so much swerve  From common sense advice deserve  Yet hear unworthy as thou art  While I assume the friendly part  And counsel give of such a kind  As may correct thy fickle mind  May set thy fetter'd reason loose  And free thy mind from selfabuse  Instead of lovers at thy toilet  Who only beauty praise to spoil it  Who flutter round like tainting flies  To make thy rifled sweets their prize  Give up to some deserving mate  Thy single fruitless dang'rous state  Become in time a virtuous wife  And learn to taste a prudent life  For time inverted in its flight  For slothful day and vicious night  For rambling visits cards and dice  For pleasures bought at VIRTUE'S price  Let some domestic useful care  Thy well applied attention share  Yet think not that I mean to say  Thou can'st not be with prudence gay  For pleasures most sincere we find  Where prudence is with virtue join'd  Behold thy lisping infants rise  To fill with joy maternal eyes  On such the truest bliss depends  In them see husband parents friends  Behold like tender plants they shoot  Cherish their blossoms into fruit  To rip'ning morals pay regard  Repress the bad the good reward  Join in their sports and always try  To give a taste of industry  Let calm correction wanted prove  That justice guides parental love  And rather give thy heart some pain  Than hold the reins of pow'r in vain  Bless'd in his love and form'd to bless  Make thine thy husband's happiness  If any ruffle should arise  For storms may gloom the brightest skies  Smile him with gentle looks to peace  And bid unruly passions cease  Last shunning empty lavish pride  Be ev'ry day in dress a bride  These rules pursu'd thy sight must be  In proper seasons fond of me  And night will only then seem best  When weary Nature calls for rest  FABLE XXVI THE LION BEAR AND APE  IT happen'd as in human kind  A LION to his errors blind  No more than battle to the strong  Does wisdom to the great belong  Admir'd an APE a flatt'ring sprite  Who prais'd his actions wrong or right  Who when it thunder'd kindly swore  'Twas nothing to his Monarch's roar  When lightning flash'd along the sky  'Twas nothing to his piercing eye  And vow'd that his majestic face  Put human nature to disgrace  For which the sycophant in short  Was Laureat made and went to Court  While haughty distance curb'd a BEAR  Who lov'd his PRINCE with honest care  Because the undissembling creature  As rough in temper as in feature  By loyalty and prudence taught  Still plainly utter'd what he thought  Some wholesome truths would oft advance  Ne'er found in GALLIC complaisance  And often like a Patriot would  Remind his King of PUBLIC GOOD  Attended by this contrast pair  The Lion went to take the air  When as along a wood they stray'd  Sir APE fresh protestations made  Declar'd his head his heart and all  Were ready at the Monarch's call  Come Danger from each point he cries  That the winds blow thro' wintry skies  Let Fate with all its terrors crown'd  Spread all her strongest toils around  Fearless 'twould be my greatest pride  To shed my blood in crimson tide  And bravely fall no more to rise  Before my Royal Master's eyes  But wherefore this since conquests tell  How much he is invincible  The whisking of whose dreadful tail  Can stoutest hearts with fear assail  Whose mortal fangs and tusks defy  All nature turn'd his enemy  Let ev'ry beast then chorus join  To hail a MONARCH so divine  The BEAR heard all yet nothing said  But jog'd along and shook his head  At length appear'd from neighb'ring plain  Of hunters a terrific train  The startled beasts who saw too late  The near approach of frowning fate  No time had left to shape their course  Before assail'd with hostile force  At the first glimpse our valiant APE  Up a huge tree made swift escape  And left as his securest way  His Prince he thought an easy prey  Cowards themselves who cannot fly  Will rather fight than tamely die  No wonder then heroic hearts  In such a case should play their parts  BRUIN with fatal grasp display'd  Much merit in the fighting trade  Press'd out by force th' unwilling breath  Embracing many foes to death  Impregnable the LION stood  Till cover'd with his hunters' blood  Who hopeless on th' approach of night  Gave up a long and doubtful fight  Taught by the royal beast to yield  And leave him master of the field  Soon as the APE beheld from high  A vanquish'd harmless enemy  He reach'd the ground with nimble pace  Ten thousand bows and fawning face  Gave LEO joy of warlike fame  Of safety and a deathless name  Then wanting words to suit his praise  Concluded with three loud huzzas  Liplove could now deceive no more  His monarch with tremendous roar  Full in the BEAR'S delighted view  The sycophantic coward slew  Then cried Henceforth no fawning slave  No fairfac'd flatt'ring heartless knave  Shall ever royal favour share  Henceforth 'tis thinemy trusty BEAR  The prince or subject who depends  On flatt'ring or professing friends  When Danger with tempestuous gales  In most tremendous form assails  Will find the sunshine minions fly  The clouds of dark adversity  FABLE XXVII THE COCK AND PEACOCK  A PEACOCK which as oft you've heard  In classic times was JUNO'S bird  Of rich and gaudy plumage proud  Assum'd precedence o'er the croud  And coxcomb like not knowing whether  True merit lay in heart or feather  He exercis'd his taunting wit  On whom and when he thought most fit  One luckless day his spirits high  As CHANTICLEER was passing by  An honest bird who never tried  To fawn and flatter empty pride  With insolence of word and look  His haughty restless mind he broke  Why how now GINGER what's the matter  That you presum'd to make such clatter  You strut and crow and clap your wings  'Till all our master's courtyard rings  Such rude behaviour such a noise  The pleasure of my life destroys  I seldom raise my tuneful note  To shame thy most discordant throat  Else all the birds would soon agree  To sing my praise and banish thee  Besides you shamefully neglect  To pay my worship due respect  Be prudent then nor more provoke  That rage which yet has turn'd to joke  Thy crimes or know thou wilt expose  Thy safety to a world of foes  Tho' I alone beyond dissembling  Can set thy paltry heart a trembling  He said and turning with disdain  Display'd his rich embroider'd train  Which shone an emblem of the skies  Adorn'd with ARGUS' hundred eyes  The COCK like every bird of sense  Still slow to give or take offence  For some time heard with patience cool  This gaudy shallowpated fool  The censure on his voice and air  He rightly judg'd beneath his care  But touch'd upon the master string  Of CouragePassion straight took wing  His feathers rose and o'er his head  The crimson tinge of rage was spread  Shall my fair name receive a blot  He cries from such an empty sot  Shall I who in the mortal pit  My blood have shed to thee submit  Whate'er their show I like not birds  Made merely up of looks and words  Prepare and stand upon thy guard  I seldom strike but always hard  He flew with such a willing mind  At once he smote the PEACOCK blind  Who fell to earth and prostrate lay  Of pain and shame the hapless prey  Which seen the gen'rous victor cried  Unhappy wretch I'm satisfied  Thy eyes have paid the forfeit due  Henceforth dwell peace 'twixt me and you  To conquer gratifies the brave  Whose second pleasure is to save  For this I'll prove a tender friend  And sooth the loss I cannot mend  But let thy fate henceforth advise  The race of FOPLINGS to be wise  All who like thee in show delight  Most justly merit loss of sight  FABLE XXVIII THE WASPS AND BEES  A BEE the leader of its hive  As great as any BEE alive  Of enterprizing disposition  A warrior and a politician  As once he took his humming flight  Upon a cowship chanc'd to light  And while from golden cup he drew  Luxurious draughts of honey dew  A jealous WASP with words like these  Abus'd in him the race of BEES  Why how now thou maroding elf  Thou dost not surely know thyself  Else couldst thou not pretend to range  From clime to clime in search of change  And plunder all the fields along  Where'er thou com'st or right or wrong  But BEES indeed both great and small  Are little less than robbers all  A poor dependent set of knaves  To undeserving mankind slaves  Who think their citadel of straw  Should keep the INSECT world in awe  Hence let me warn thee from this spot  Which Nature has ordain'd my lot  Or else tho' thousands should protect  Some dreadful punishment expect  Annihilation without trace  Of you or any of your race  The BEE with sullen wonder heard  And fearless weigh'd each single word  Thrice he in vain essay'd to speak  Thrice could not teeming silence break  Just pride the pow'r of speech restrain'd  For tho' he felt he still disdain'd  To enter singly in the lift  With such a vile antagonist  So spread his pinions and retreated  In haste as if he'd been defeated  Great thoughts at once the WASP inspire  To see his hated foe retire  His nest he sought with eager haste  And being in the center plac'd  Declar'd with how much spirit he  Had guarded public property  When he had told the sanguine tale  Which pride imagin'd could not fail  High in the rolls of deathless FAME  To blazon his immortal name  Debates which made no little clatter  Arose about th' important matter  Some prais'd while some express'd dislike  Worth cannot all opinions strike  The young and forward wasps agreed  Some honours should be strait decreed  For less 'twas thought they could not render  To such a spirited defender  One glibber tongu'd than all the rest  Thus plausibly harangued the nest  I know not why my valiant friends  Since justice on ourselves depends  Maroding BEES uncheck'd should roam  While fearful we remain at home  Do we not boast as nimble wings  As mighty hearts as deadly stings  Glory invites with friendly call  Shall we not own the summons all  Forth let us fly and strait engage  Our mortal foes with martial rage  If none of greater merit claim  The foremost post in paths of FAME  Boldly in front myself I'll place  And danger's first approaches face  Live with immortal honour crown'd  Or bravely fall a WASP renown'd  My friends replies an aged Sire  Fools only specious show admire  Sound policy and solid sense  Will ponder still the consequence  In states we find as private life  There's little got by illtim'd strife  Perhaps I may appear too stoic  To censure measures so heroic  But know you'll find on coolest thought  Ev'n HONEY may be dearly bought  Kind Nature yields sufficient store  To feed us all what need we more  We may be happy if we please  As peaceful WASPS or peaceful BEES  But if we plunge ourselves in war  We cannot tell the end of care  Let INSECTS what they have enjoy  And monster MAN his kind destroy  This sage advice however right  Was treated with a gen'ral slight  Mean while the BEES a message sent  To know their  waspish  foes intent  Whether submission should release  From threaten'd war and give them peace  Or resolute in bold defiance  On Fortune they would fix reliance  Remonstrance to the  Quixote  train  Of prideswell'd insects prov'd in vain  They bade the Herald wing his flight  And say their wishes were to fight  That blows that wounds that death alone  With horrors and distress unknown  In that or any other age  Their kindled fury could asswage  The BEES determin'd to chastise  This haughty slight of compromize  A war began and Fortune sate  Three summer months in doubtful state  On which to turn the fav'ring gale  Suspending nicely Conquest's scale  While many stingless champions lay  To hungry spiders easy prey  Till both sides wearied thought it best  For that campaign at least to rest  Their suff'rings in the field were great  Yet home produc'd a sharper fate  For now the flow'ry time was o'er  Design'd to furnish Winter's store  In vain they sought the russet fields  The year declin'd no nurture yields  Pale Famine gave a gen'ral shock  On finding Glory all their stock  Our warriors wounded to the heart  Breath'd out despair on either part  Forgot the trivial cause of strife  So hanging o'er the verge of life  Agreed to curse ambitious Pride  Sad counsellorand starving dy'd  FABLE XXIX THE POET AND PEN  WELL sung the BARD that some "in  spite  Of Nature and their stars will write  "  Proofs rise on proofs that ev'ry age  Mounts DUNCES upon Learning's stage  Who write and write and write away  For empty fame or solid pay  On Deaths Births Marriages compose  Whole reams of flimsyVerse or Prose  With selfapplause admire their wit  Whene'er

And almost a Chamelion grown  I'm taught to live on air alone  The rats and mice may when they please  My cupboard haunt nor hurt my cheese  My russet coat which once was black  Hangs piecemeal o'er

this reply  Truth Scribbler may thy charge deny  Convicted folly seeks excuse  The best of things admit abuse  And often so against our wills  Appears the injur'd race of Quills  Of men and their caprice the slaves  We serve the turn of  Fools  and  Knaves  Fools  always think that they command  Our movements with a master's hand  And  Knaves  affecting Virtue's cause  Assail through us her wisest laws  The Author who would merit fame  Whose wishes grasp a lasting name  Distinguish'd in his works should be  By genius sense and honesty  Without the last the former two  Are glitt'ring serpents fair to view  Which flatter with a spangled skin  While deadliest poison lurks within  Did I or any other quill  Endeavour to mislead thy will  Had I the power to turn aside  Thy confidence and forward pride  'Tis true thou hast not wanted care  To make thy labours popular  And never miss'd occasion fit  To shew thy politicks and wit  To praise or censure ever prone  Where profit mark'd a cause thy own  Thou hast not fail'd to join the cry  And bawl out  Wilkes  and  Liberty  Yet rated as a babbling hound  Contempt thy vain endeavours crown'd  You think you write you print in vain  And torture me with fruitless pain  'Tis not each wight who chinks a rhime  That shines the CHURCHILL of his time  Tho' hebut hush the hand of Death  Shuts  Censure's lips and stops her breath  Could'st thou with noble heart and mind  Like LYTTELTON inform mankind  From whom with ease and vigour flows  The elegance of verse and prose  Could'st thou on Fancy's rapid wing  In strains like nervous MASON sing  Like him range Nature's ample field  And such enchanting prospects yield  Could'st thou with elegiac GRAY  In slowly sad funereal lay  Such passionquelling truths impart  As charm at once and mend the heart  Or could'st thou on the  comic  stage  Like sprightly COLMAN shew the age  The rustic fop and jealous fool  With justice turn'd to ridicule  Then Genius taking proper bent  Had made thy pen an ornament  Shall DUNCES blot with Gothic rage  A  Virgil  's or a  Milton  's page  In mad  revenge  for want of  toste  Lay the fair field of  Science  waste  Suppress thy

Yet controvert a PROVIDENCE  Who see the glorious Sun arise  To light our Globe and gild the skies  Who view those countless gems which grace  The boundless blue Aethereal space  Who hear the

Wisdom's precepts turn aside  Loform'd on Nature's noblest plan  How discontent how vain is man  How groundless in ill plac'd desires  As opposite as frosts and fires  Let Seasons vary as they will  Some cares some faults perplex him still  The scorching Summer burns his ground  Next Rains descend and then he's drown'd  His situation always such  Heav'n sends too little or too much  WISDOM too

axioms fail  Disguis'd in ALLEGORIC tale  Oft with success she plays her part  And tickling Fancy steals the heart  Then let the Muse in masquerade  Invoke the friendly  blueey'd  Maid  Her strains attend each proud ingrate  Nor murmur at unerring Fate  For tho' portentous clouds should low'r  And tempests shake thy present hour  The storm may pass and on its wings  Bear from thy breast ten thousand stings  And humble Hope and pious Love  Draw down protection from above  Yet howsoe'er thy Fortune sails  With fav'ring tides and prosp'rous gales  With caution steer towards thy port  Nor 'midst surrounding dangers sport  A MOUSE whose silky fur could show  Less fair the purest  Alpine  snow  Had long a fav'rite cupboard haunted  For sustenance which Nature wanted  Nor ever with voracious mind  At lack of various food repin'd  But bless'd with crusts of bread and cheese  Enjoy'd content and liv'd at ease  One nightone most important night  Allur'd by DIAN'S silv'ry light  The

baited trap  The dainty seiz'd and bless'd that star  Which led to such delicious fare  Admir'd the thought which taught to roam  From tasteless mouldy scraps at home  Then prais'd with joy the happier lot  Of this unknown luxurious spot  As fools the present moment prize  Nor forward deign to cast their eyes  The little  Captive  thought no less  Than lasting perfect happiness  And on reflection grew quite vain  To think its allsufficient brain  Alone with matchless sense profound  This more than golden mine had found  How blind all other Mice it cries  MYSELF am  wisest  of the  wise  Now gorg'd with most delicious cate  It finds surrounding bars too late  From top to bottom fearstruck flies  Attempts to creep attempts to rise  But finding it in vain to try  For home despis'd

ev'ry side  The captive too elate with pride  Grew more distinguishing and nice  Than any of the tribe of MICE  Indulg'd excess nor ever thought  Of what the pleasing change had wrought  But like a petted darling child  With misapplied indulgence wild  To beauty gave the total merit  Of all it did or could inherit  And vainly said of ev'ry bliss  My worth deserves much more than this  For wishes with enjoyment grew  Experience proves this maxim true  'Till fretted Fortune thus pursued  By folly and ingratitude  Resolv'd in just and settled state  To show a sad reverse of fate  Each day

JUSTICE shall all his actions guide  With Mercy smiling at her side  When hostile force provokes to war  You MARS shall guide his rapid car  And NEPTUNE you shall smooth the tides  O'er which his
