and  internal  Violence  Invasions  from Abroad or  Dissentions  at Home The Rage of foreign  War  or domestic  Faction  After a dangerous and exhausting War Victory hath at length restored Peace to our bleeding Country But in vain the  Sword of War is sheathed if in Time of Peace the Poignard of  Licentiousness  and  Faction  is drawn and madly level'd by many of our Countrymen at the Breasts of their FellowSubjects  To prevent the fatal Consequences of this deluded or deluding Spirit is the Purpose of this Essay In which the Writer will endeavour to trace the present State of Things to its general Foundations By pointing out the real Basis and genuine Characteristics of true Liberty by unmasquing the Pretences and laying open the secret  Sources  and distinctive  Marks  of  Licentiousness  and  Faction  As the political Principles here laid down and inforced will be found strictly connected with Religion and Morals no Apology will be made for endeavouring to establish the public Happiness of Mankind on the solid Basis of  Virtue  which is the  End  of  Religion itself  In this Point the Writer confirms himself on the Authority of an excellent and learned Prelate whose  political Researches were of like Tendency  "As the Sum of human Happiness is supposed to consist in the Goods of Mind Body and Fortune I would fain make my Studies of some Use to Mankind with Regard to each of these three Particulars and hope it will not be thought faulty or indecent in any Man of what Profession soever to offer his Mite towards improving the  Manners  I will add the  Religion Health  and  Prosperity  of his FellowCreatures  Dr  Berkley  's Misc p  "  SECT II Of the Nature of Civil Liberty  TO some it will doubtless appear a superfluous Labour to fix the true Idea of  civil Liberty  in a Country which boasts itself  free  Yet the Writer esteems it a necessary though obvious Task Not only that he may appeal to his Idea of it thus established but also because in the  Conduct  at least if not in the  Writings  of his Countrymen it seems to have been sometimes mistaken  The  natural Liberty  of Man considered merely as a solitary and savage Individual would generally lead him to a full and unbounded Prosecution of all his Appetites Some Savages there are though few who live nearly if not altogether in this  brutal  State of  Nature  These last Expressions it must be confessed are inadequate to their Subject For such a State of Man is worse than that of Brutes and in the strict Sense is also  contrary  to  Nature  For Brutes are endowed with unerring Instincts which Man possesseth not Therefore such a solitary and wretched State is strictly  unnatural  because it prevents the Exertion of those Powers which his  Nature  is  capable  of  attaining  But those  Powers Society  alone can  call forth  into  Action  Man is therefore formed for  Society  That is Man is formed for Intercourse with Man Hence through the natural Developement of the human Powers a Variety of new  Wants  a Necessity for mutual  Aids  and distinct  Properties  must arise From these a new  Accession  as well as a frequent  Disagreement  and  Clashing  of  Desires  must inevitably ensue Hence the Necessity of  curbing  and  fixing  the  Desires  of Man in the social State by such  equal Laws  as may compel the  Appetites  of each  Individual  to yield to the  common Good  of  all  From this salutary  Restraint civil Liberty  is derived Every natural Desire which might in any Respect be inconsistent with the general Weal is given up as a voluntary Tax paid for the higher more lasting and more important  Benefits  which we reap from  social Life  SECT III Of Licentiousness and Faction  FROM the Nature of civil Liberty thus delineated the Nature of  Licentiousness  will easily be fixed Being indeed no other than  "Every Desire carry'd into Action which in any Respect violates those equal Laws established for the common Benefit of the Whole"  Thus an  unlimited Indulgence  of Appetite which in the  savage  State is called  natural Liberty  in the  social  State is stiled  Licentiousness  And  Licentiousness  when its immediate Object is That of  "thwarting the Ends of civil Liberty"  is distinguished by the Name of  Faction  SECT IV Unassisted Laws no permanent Foundation of Civil Liberty  THESE Remarks are obvious and clear to every Man possessed of the common Degrees of Understanding Let us now consider  "What are the  permanent Foundations  of civil Liberty"  That is in other Words  "What are the effectual Means by which every Member of Society may be uniformly sway'd impelled or induced to sacrifice his private Desires or Appetites to the Welfare of the Public"  This is a Subject which deserves a particular Elucidation because in our own Country and our own Times it seems to have been  much  and  dangerously  mistaken  It hath been affirmed as a first Principle by certain Writers and hath been artfully or weakly suggested by others  "that the  coercive Power of human Laws is sufficient to sustain itself That the Legislator or Magistrate hath properly no Concern with the private Opinions Sentiments or Operations of the Mind And that  Actions  alone fall under the legal Cognizance of those in Power"  The Author of the  Fable of the Bees  hath boldly laid down this which as a ruling Principle pervades his whole Work He professes himself the Friend of Liberty He derides private Virtue as the Offspring of Flattery begotten upon Pride He discards Religion as a political Fable he treats the Principle of Honour as an empty Chimera he recommends private Vices as public Benefits  Fable of the Bees  passim  and having thus level'd the whole Fabric of  Manners  and  Principles  what do you think is the grand Arcanum of his Policy for the Prevention of such Crimes as would indanger the Grandeur and Stability of the State Why  "severe  Laws rugged Officers Pillories WhippingPosts Jails and Gibbets"  Essay on Charity Schools  This Principle of the Sufficiency of human Laws to sustain their own Efficacy and Power without Regard to the Opinions or Principles of Men hath been at least indirectly held forth by other Writers  An Author who although a  sincere  was certainly an  imprudent  Friend of Liberty speaks in the following ambiguous Stile which if not designed to impress the Principle here called in Question is at least very liable to be interpreted into it  "It is foolish to say that Government is concerned to meddle with the  private Thoughts  and Actions of Men while they injure neither the Society nor any of its Members Every Man is in Nature and Reason the  Judge  and  Disposer  of his own  domestic Affairs  and according to the  Rules  of  Religion  and  Equity  every Man must carry  his own Conscience  So that neither has the Magistrate a Right to  direct  the  private Behaviour  of Men nor has the Magistrate or any Body else any Manner of Power to  model  People's  Speculations  no more than their  Dreams  Government being intended to  protect  Men from the  Injuries  of one another and not to direct them in  their own Affairs  in which  no one is interested but themselves  it is plain that their  Thoughts  and  domestic Concerns  are  exempted  entirely from its Jurisdiction In Truth Men's  Thoughts  are not subject to  their own Jurisdiction"  "Let People alone  and they will  take Care of themselves  and do it  best  And if they do not a sufficient  Punishment  will  follow  their  Neglect  without the  Magistrate's Interposition  and  Penalties  It is plain that such busy Care and officious  Intrusion  into the  personal Affairs  or  private Actions Thoughts  and  Imaginations  of Men has in it more  Craft  than  Kindness  To  quarrel  with any Man for his  Opinions Humours  or the Fashion of his Cloaths is an  Offence  taken without being given"    "True and impartial Liberty is therefore the Right of every Man to pursue the  natural reasonable  and  religious  Dictates of his own Mind To  think what he will  and  act as he thinks  provided he  acts not  to the  Prejudice  of another  Cato  's Letters No  "  These Expressions are crude inaccurate and ambiguous leaving the thoughtful Reader at a Loss for the Author's precise and determined Meaning For first they may possibly imply  "that the Magistrate hath no Right to violate the Laws of what is commonly called  religious Toleration  or  christian Liberty  but that every Man hath an unalienable Right to worship God in that  Manner  which accords to the Dictates of his own Conscience"  In this Sense they are rational and true  And to this Truth the Writer hath more than once born public Testimony  See Vol of Sermons Serm  But secondly they may imply  "that Thoughts Speculations Opinions Principles however received and imbibed by the Mind of Man have no Connexion with his Actions at most no Connexion so necessary and strong as to give the Magistrate a Right to  regulate  them by  any Means  whatever That no Direction is to be given either to the  grown  or the  infant Mind  that as every Member of Society hath a Right to hold what Opinions and Principles he pleaseth so he hath the same Privilege to communicate them to his  Family  and  Children  That they are to think what they will because Thoughts and Opinions are a private and personal Affair That the Magistrate is only concerned to regulate their Actions"  This is not only a possible Interpretation but in all Appearance the more natural of the two For it is not here once suggested by this Author that  Opinions  have any  Influence  on  Actions  but rather that they concern  nobody  but  Him  who  holds  them 'Tis true he speaks of them as being  reasonable  and  religious  But if they be the mere Result of private and fortuitous Thought unaided by the Regulations of civil Policy I see not why they may not more probably be  unreasonable  and  irreligious  Because they are more likely to be model'd by  ruling Appetites  than  rational Deduction  At the same Time it is but Justice to this Author to say that he certainly meant not like the Author of the  Fable of the Bees  to discard all  moral  Principles as groundless and chimerical whatever his Intentions were with Regard to  Religion  But his Expressions are  ambiguous  and have been laid hold of by Men of the most libertine Opinions Therefore in  whatever Sense they were  written  it is necessary to oppose them in that Sense in which they have been  received  And farther this is certain That the Principle implied in this second Interpretation hath passed into a general Maxim in this Kingdom among those who pique themselves on  unlimited Freedom  of  Thought  These Men have long and openly derided every  Regulation  of  Opinion  and  Principle  have discarded all  moral  and  religious Instruction  under the despised Idea of  Prejudice of Education  have laid it down as their fundamental Maxim  "that you are to think what you will Only to act honestly"  Not attending to that essential Connexion which subsists between  Thoughts Opinions Principles  and ACTIONS  Doubtless any Society of Men aiming at the Establishment of civil Liberty have a Right to unite themselves on what Conditions they please But it is the Purpose of this Essay to prove by Reasonings confirmed by Facts that a free Community  built on the Maxims above delivered cannot be of  long Duration  That the mere  coercive Power  of  human Laws  is not sufficient to  sustain itself  That there is a strong and unalterable  Connexion  between  Opinions  and  Actions  That a certain  Regulation  of Principles is necessary to check the selfish Passions of Man and prevent  Liberty  from degenerating into  Licentiousness  And that  "a certain System of Manners and Principles mutually supporting each other and pervading the whole Community are the only permanent Foundation on which true civil Liberty can arise"  The natural Appetites Passions and Desires of Man are the universal Fountain of his Actions Without the Impulse which he receives from  those  he would be at once unfeeling and inactive Consequently according to the State and Character of his Desires his Actions will  naturally  be good or evil innocent useful or destructive  Were these Desires universally coincident with the Welfare and Happiness of others no coercive Power would be wanting as the Means of producing and securing perfect Liberty  But the acknowledged Necessity of penal Laws affords an incontestable Proof that the  unbridled Desires  of Man are utterly inconsistent with the Welfare and Happiness of his Fellow Creatures  Whatever Means therefore are most effectual in curbing and  subduing  the selfish  Desires  of Man are the most effectual Means of  regulating  his  Actions  and establishing civil Liberty on its most permanent Foundations  The mere coercive Power of human Laws without an assistant Regulation of the Passions and Desires is utterly inadequate to the great Ends either of  private  Happiness or  public  Liberty  It cannot produce  private  Happiness to the Individual because while it leaves his Mind open to be  infested  by every  unruly  Passion  that may arise it  forbids  him the  Gratification  Thus it sets the distracted Soul at Variance with itself The best Consequence that can be hoped for is a continued Conflict of  Fear  and  Appetite  of a  Dread  of human  Laws  warring with inordinate and  selsish Passions  It cannot be a  permanent  Foundation of public Liberty because while the Passions are thus left without an inward Controul they will often be too strong for  Fear  even where a legal Punishment is the certain Consequence For as they are suffered to subsist in their full Vigour and when kindled in the Soul are blind and headlong they will often carry away the whole Man will bear him down in their Gratification even to unavoidable Destruction  Still farther and chiefly Human Power cannot penetrate the secret Recesses of the Soul nor reach the dark Intentions of the Heart of Man nor always be of Weight to combat the Strength of Individuals  Hence  Cunning  will often  evade  and  Force  will often  defy  the coercive Power of the bestformed Laws Thus  public Wisdom  must give Way to  private Gratification  the  Innocent  must become a  Prey  to the  Guilty  that is in other Words  Liberty  must be  destroyed  and  Licentiousness  must  triumph  SECT V Virtuous Manners and Principles the only permanent Foundation of civil Liberty  WHAT then are the  permanent Foundations  on which perfect Liberty can ariseI answer it can only arise on the Power of such a System of  Manners  and  Principles  effectually impressed on the human Mind as may be an  inward Curb  to every inordinate Desire or rather such as may so frame and model the Human Heart that its ruling Desires  may correspond coincide or coalesce with all the great and essential Appointments of public Law  The Nature of Man admits of this Improvement though not in a perfect yet in a considerable Degree He is born with Appetites suited to his own Preservation and the Continuance of his Species Beyond this he is by Nature at once  selfish  and  social compassionate  and  resentful docile  either to  Good  or  Evil  and hence capable of acquiring  new Habits  new Passions new Desires either to the  Welfare  or  Destruction  of his FellowCreatures  Virtuous Manners  I call such acquired Habits of Thought and correspondent Action as lead to a steady Prosecution of the general Welfare  Virtuous Principles  I call such as tend to confirm these Habits by superinducing the Idea of  Duty  Virtuous Manners are a permanent Foundation for civil Liberty because they  lead the Passions and Desires themselves to coincide with the Appointments of public Law The infant Mind is pregnant with a Variety of Passions But it is in the Power of those who are intrusted with the Education of Youth in a considerable Degree to determine the Bent of the nascent Passions to fix them on salutary Objects or let them loose to such as are pernicious or destructive  Here then lie the first Foundations of civil Liberty In forming the Habits of the youthful Heart to a  Coincidence  with the  general Welfare  In checking every rising Appetite that is contrary to This and in forwarding every Passion that may promote the Happiness of the Community In implanting and improving Benevolence SelfControul Humility Integrity and Truth in preventing or suppressing the contrary Habits of Selfishness Intemperance Pride Dishonesty and Falsehood In teaching the young Mind to  delight  as far as is possible in  every Virtue for its own Sake In a Word in so forming the Pleasures and Displeasures of the opening Heart that they may coalesce and harmonize with the Laws of public Freedom  Above all  This  will give Stability to civil Liberty if the social Passions of Individuals can be so far extended as to include the Welfare of the  whole  Community as their  chief  and  primary  Object This Affection is distinguished by the Name of  public Spirit  or the  Love  of our  Country  the highest Passion that can sway the human Heart considered as a permanent Foundation of true Liberty  But in some Minds the selfish Passions are strong and the social ones weak or wanting And in the best formed Heart incidental Temptations may arise and overturn its preestablished Habits Therefore it is a necessary Measure for the Security of private Virtue and public Freedom that  virtuous Principles  be likewise implanted in the Heart Such Principles  I mean as may  strengthen  the good Habits of Thought and Action already contracted by superinducing the Idea of  Duty  Of these there are but  three  which can sway the Manners of Men and confirm the Foundation of civil Liberty These are  Religion Honour  and natural  Conscience  The first has the  Deity  for its Object the second the  Applause  of  Men  the third the  Approbation  of our own  Heart  The Frame and Situation of Man admits of no other  Principle  from whence the Idea of  Duty  can arise  The Principle of  Religion  tends to this End of confirming civil Liberty as it induces the Idea of  Duty  and urges the Performance of it on the Belief of a just omnipotent and allseeing GOD who approves and condemns will reward or punish according as our Thoughts and Actions are Good or Evil  But as the Means of rendering  Religion  a firm  Ally  and  Support  of  Liberty  it is necessary that their  Dictates  should be  coincident  That is that the Thoughts and Actions which Religion prescribes as Duties and forbids as Sins should coincide with the Dictates and Appointments of public Law In free Countries this is the natural State of Religion which commonly either bends to the established Laws of the Community or moulds them into its own Genius and Complexion  The Principle of  Honour  affords a concomitant Support of civil Liberty when properly directed It works by a powerful and universal Passion  "our Fondness for the Applause of Men"  But in free Countries this Principle is much more liable to abuse than that of Religion Because it is apt be be warped by the fashionable and ruling Manners of the Times For whatever is fashionable is apt to draw Respect and Applause Whatever is unfashionable is for the present intitled only to Contempt Hence the Principle of  Honour  becomes  fluctuating  and  uncertain  in its Nature and therefore in its  Effects  A  Regulation  of this Principle therefore is of the most important Consequence because if left to its own fantastic Dictates it will often  endanger  instead of  strengthening  the Foundations of public Freedom  The third Principle that of natural  Conscience  which tends to confirm the Establishment of Liberty is founded in the Approbation of our own Heart This Principle is in one Respect independent on the other two but in another Respect seems to stand intimately related to them It is independent of them as it neither looks out for the Approbation of God nor the Applause of Men It seems intimately related to them because on a strict Examination of the human Frame as well as the History of Mankind it appears generally to be the Result of the  one  or  other  or  both  We transplant the acknowledged  Approbation  of  Heaven  and the  Applause  of  Men  into our own  Heart  and from this through the fertile Power of  Association  springs a new Principle of  SelfApprobation  and  SelfReproof  as an additional  Regulator  of our Thoughts and Actions  'Tis true many Writers have resolved the  particular  Dictates of natural Conscience into an  unchangeable  Principle of Right and Wrong arising universally in the human Heart There is no Doubt but the  general  Principle of SelfApprobation or SelfRebuke ariseth in an  universal  Manner in some Degree or other But as it appears from the History of human Nature that the  particular  Dictates of this Conscience  vary  with the other received Principles of the Mind it is not necessary to debate or dwell on this speculative Point We may take it as a Truth confirmed by Facts that the  particular  Dictates of natural  Conscience  will generally be founded on those of  Religion  and  Honour  Hence then it appears that this Principle of Conscience stands in Need of a  Guide  in the same Degree as those Principles on which it is founded If it be founded on the  Religion  of a free State it will generally  coincide  with the Principles of  Freedom  If its Foundations are laid in the mere Principle of  Honour  its Dictates will be  fantastic  as those of its Parent and will therefore require a parallel  Regulation  Each of these Principles singly taken is of Power in  some  Degree or other to strengthen the Basis of civil Liberty On their  united  Influence added to the Force of preestablished Habits of Thought and Manners public Freedom might seem to arise on immoveable and everlasting Foundations  But as the Nature of Man even in his most virtuous State is  imperfect  and  inconsistent  so in Spite of the most salutary Institutions some  Defects  will intrude Hence from an unavoidable Alloy of  Vice civil Liberty must ever be  imperfect  A certain Degree of Licentiousness that is of private Will opposing the Public will always mix itself and in some Degree contaminate the Purity of every Commonwealth  Yet while virtuous Manners and Principles clearly predominate in their Effects a State may still be justly called  free  But in Proportion as these Manners and Principles decay and their Contraries rise into Power and Action public Freedom must necessarily decline For in that Case the Passions and Powers of the human Mind are all set in Conspiracy against the Dictates of public Law Hence unbridled Passions will have their Course every Man's Heart and Hand will be set against his Brethren and the general Cement of Society which bound all together being thus dissolved even without any external Violence offered the Commonwealth through its  internal Corruption  must fall in Pieces  SECT VI An Objection considered  DOubtless it will be objected nay it  hath  been objected by the Patrons of unlimited Freedom of Thought that This is indeed a System of  Slavery  that it is building civil Liberty on the  Servitude  of the  Mind  and shackling the infant Soul with  early Prejudice  In Answer to this plausible Objection the Writer replies what he hath elsewhere advanced  Sermons on Education c p c  "That a Prejudice doth not imply as is generally supposed the Falsehood of the Opinion instilled but only that it is taken up and held without its proper Evidence Thus the infant Mind may be prejudiced in Favour of  Truth  as well as  Falsehood  and neither can the one or the other thus instilled be properly called more than an  Opinion"  Farther The infant Mind cannot remain in a State of Indifference and Inaction either with Regard to Habits of Conduct or Principles and Opinions Habits Impressions Beliefs Principles of one Kind or other the growing Mind will inevitably contract from its Communication with Mankind If therefore rational Habits and Principles be not infused in order to preclude Absurdities it is Odds but Absurdities will get the Start and preclude all rational Habits and Opinions The Passions and the Reason of a Child will put themselves in Action however wretched and inconsistent in the same Manner as his Limbs will make an Effort towards  walking  however awkward and absurd The same Objection therefore that lies against instilling salutary Habits and Principles will arise against teaching him to  walk erect  This being indeed a Violation of the natural  Freedom  of the  Body  as the other is of the natural  Liberty  of the Passions and  the  Mind  The Consequences too are of the same Nature For sure a Child left to the Direction of his own Appetites and Reason would stand the same Chance to grovel in Absurdities as to crawl on Hands and Knees and wallow in the Mire  Neither is there any Difference with Respect to the real and internal Freedom of the Mind between  Opinions instilled  and  Opinions caught by Accident  For in Truth the Mind cannot be  compelled  to receive any Habit of Thought Principle or Opinion These may indeed be offered to the infant Mind but the Reception of them is its own voluntary Act and is equally so whether they be presented by fortuitous Incidents or designed Instruction All the Difference is that in the first Case such a System of Habits and Opinions will certainly arise as tend to the Destruction of Society In the second such a System of Habits and Opinions may be infused into the free Mind as  will lay a sure and lasting Foundation of public Liberty and Happiness  Nay if any Difference could arise with Respect to the true  Freedom  of the  Mind  surely  That Mind  ought in the Eye of Reason to be adjudged  most free  which adopts a System of Thought and Action founded on the  Wisdom  of the agreeing  Society  rather than  That  which is suffered to be incurably tainted with the  vague  and  random  Conceptions of  untutor'd Infancy  This at le  st is consonant with the old Stoic Principle that  "The wise Man alone is free  Solus Sapiens liber  "  Much hath been said in our Times indeed concerning the Force of  unassisted  human  Reason  The Writer would not willingly either flatter or degrade its Powers But to Him it appears that they are superficially informed of the Frame and Tenor of the human Mind who think that  mere Reason  as it exists in Man is more than a Power of discerning  and chusing the  properest Means  for obtaining his  desired Ends  whether these Ends be  Good  or  Evil  The Passions preestablished Habits and infused Principles of the Soul are the universal Motives to human Action Where these point not to an  End desired  Reason may indolently exercise its Eye but can never find nor create an Object of Force sufficient to put the Powers of the Soul and Body in Motion Hence human Reason must always receive its particular Cast and Colour from the preestablished Passions Habits and Principles will ever form its ruling Ideas of Good and Evil Right and Wrong Just and Unjust from these great Fountains of human Action  The History of human Nature confirms this Truth Hence it is that this boasted human Reason is indeed so poor and unprofitable a Possession being warped and moulded into that particular Form which the varying Accidents of Climate Soil established Manners Religion  Policy bodily Frame or prevailing Passions and Principles chance to give it  Hence then it appears that the private Freedom of the infant Mind is not  violated  but only  directed  to its  best End  by early and salutary Instruction Hence it appears to be the proper Destination of Man that he shall not be left to the Follies of his own weak Understanding and nascent Passions that he shall not be left  fortuitously  to imbibe the Maxims of corrupt Times and Manners Maxims which setting aside all Regard to their speculative Truth or Falsehood do lead to the Dissolution of Law and Freedom But that he shall be conducted voluntarily to adopt those Habits and Principles which have been consecrated by the Approbation of the best and wisest Men in every Age and Nation such in particular as are suitable to the Laws the Customs the Genius of his own free Country such in a Word as are a  secure Foundation  of  public Liberty  SECT VII A Confirmation of these Principles drawn from the History of free States  st Of Sparta  THESE Reasonings founded on the Nature and Constitution of Man will receive a strong and unanswerable Confirmation from the History of free States Hence we shall obtain the clearest Evidences of Fact that while virtuous Manners and Principles retained their Efficacy and Power civil Liberty remained unshaken That as these decayed Liberty declined That as soon as these were lost Liberty was no more Licentiousness crept in Faction triumphed and overwhelmed these degenerate States in one common Ruin  To this Purpose I shall briefly analyze the Genius of the three most eminent  Republics  that are recorded in Story Those of SPARTA ATHENS and ROME The Events are sufficiently known to those who are conversant in ancient History But the fundamental and leading  Causes  of these Events deserve a particular Investigation They will form a concurrent Proof of the Principles here given  The Republic of SPARTA claims the first Place both on Account of its Antiquity and Perfection By its Perfection is meant not the moral Perfection of its  particular Institutions  but of the  Means  and  Principles  by which  These  Institutions were secured  The leading Institutions which LYCURGUS fixed as the Essence of his Commonwealth were these which follow  He established a Senate of  twentyeight  as an  intermediate Power  between that of  Prince  and  People  He made an equal Partition of Lands and Goods among the free Members of the Community He introduced the Use of Iron Money instead of Gold and Silver He banished or  prevented all the Arts of Commerce Elegance and Luxury He ordained that all the Members of the Society should eat together and partake alike of the same coarse Fare He established an occasional Community of Wives So that a Wife was not so much the Property of her Husband as of the Republic to the End of Population With a parallel View he ordained a Kind of Community of Children By This no Father had the Care of his own Child which on its Birth was immediately delivered over to the Officers of the State and was either preserved or destroyed according to their Decree A continued Attention to the Preservation of the State and an unremitted Preparation and Readiness for defensive War formed the chief Employment of the  Spartan  State He committed the Cultivation of their Lands to a large Body of Slaves who dwelt in the surrounding Country were deprived of all the natural Rights  of Men and were often laid in Wait for and butchered in cold Blood by the young Men of SPARTA  This Enormity practised with Impunity by the young Men of Sparta hath been held unaccountable But seems to have been allowed on the same warlike Principle with That other Allowance  "of stealing Victuals"  Both were probably established as the Means of preparing them for the Exercise of  Stratagem  in War  These were the public and essential Institutions of the Spartan Republic Many of them strange in their Nature Yet formed for long Duration through the Means and Principles on which they were established Which we shall find to be consistent with and corroborative of the Principles of civil Liberty above laid down  The first and best Security of civil Liberty hath been shewn to consist  "in impressing the infant Mind with such Habits of Thought and Action as may correspond with and promote the Appointments of public Law"  This Security was laid by LYCURGUS in the  deepest and most effectual Manner by the Mode of  Education  which he prescribed to the  Spartan  Youth  No Father had a Right to educate his Children according to the Caprice of his own Fancy They were delivered to public Officers who initiated them early in the Manners the Maxims the Exercises the Toils in a Word in all the mental and bodily Acquirements and Habits which  corresponded  with the  Genius  of the  State  Family Connexions had no Place The first and leading Object of their Affection was the general Welfare This Tuition was carefully continued till they were enrolled in the List of  Men  To secure the Manners thus acquired they were prohibited from travelling into other Countries lest they should catch Infection from ill Example On the same Foundation all Visits from Strangers were forbidden  Plutarch in Lycurgo  Thus were they strongly and  unalterably possessed with the  Love  of their  Country  These severe Manners were confirmed by all the Principles that could strengthen them in the Mind of Man  The Principle of  Religion  laid at the very Foundation of the State For LYCURGUS expressly modeled his Commonwealth on the Pretence of a divine Authority He declared to the People that its essential Institutions were given him by the Oracle of DELPHI which he went on Purpose to consult  Plutarch in Lycurgo  Again after he had modeled his Republic he repaired once more to the sacred Tripod and enquired  "whether the God approved of the Laws he had established"  The Answer was in the Affirmative And this Reply LYCURGUS sent to SPARTA  Ib  This Principle was so intimately blended with that of the State that their  Kings  were at the same Time the  High Priests  of the Community  Ib  The Religion  and Power of an Oath was so strongly impressed on their Minds that LYCURGUS trusted the future Execution of his Laws to  That  Oath which the People took on his last Departure from the City  Plutarch in Lycurgo  An Oath which proves that the Religion of the Country was not at Variance with the Appointments of the State because it obliged them never to depart from the Institutions of LYCURGUS  The Principle of  Honour  was not at Variance but  cooperated  with and  sustained  That of  Religion  PLUTARCH is very particular on their early and continued Encouragement of this Principle Their Songs which made a Part of their Education tended to inflame their Minds with honest Ambition  "Their Subject was generally the  Praise  of such Men as had dy'd in Defence of their Country or in  Derision  of Those who had shrunk from the public Service The  old  Men talked high of what they had  done The  younger  Part echo'd back their Song declaring their Resolution not to disgrace the Valour of their Forefathers  Plutarch in Lycurgo  "  The Principle of natural  Conscience  was so intimately interwoven with those of their  Religion  and  Honour  that it affords a striking Proof how far natural Conscience depends on these other Principles If natural Conscience were in itself a wellregulated and  sufficient Guide  could any Thing have been more odious to its Dictates than  Prostitution Adultery Thieving  and  Assassination  Yet all these did the severe  Spartans  practise not only  without Remorse  but with  SelfApprobation  the infant Mind being beforehand modeled to this  preposterous  System of  imagined Duty  For on the very ruling Principles of the State their Daughters were debauched their Wives were common their Victuals were stolen their Slaves were murdered  Ib  Thus was the famed Republic of  Sparta  strongly fortify'd by the united and concurrent Power of  Manners  and  Principles  all pointing to the  same  End the  Strength  and  Duration  of the  State  Of Manners and Principles which in their particular Application seemed to sacrifice the Happiness of Individuals to the Preservation of the Whole And while they were most  abhorrent  from the Maxims of  improved  human Nature  secured  the Institutions of a  savage  Policy  From this View of the  Spartan  Commonwealth these farther Remarks may naturally arise  It hath been Matter of Surprize to those who have written on this famed Republic  "by what Means LYCURGUS should be able to perswade the  Spartans  not only to change the Form of their Government but to quit their private Possessions their Manner of Life the Use of Money the Advantages of Commerce the Property of their Wives  the Care of their Children and adopt a contrary System so abhorrent from the Desires of civilized Man"  And indeed supposing the  Fact  it should seem a Paradox utterly unaccountableThe true Solution seems of a quite different NaturePLUTARCH leads me to it  "There is so much Uncertainty saith he in the Accounts which Historians have left us of LYCURGUS that scarce any Thing is asserted by one which is not contradicted by others Their Sentiments are quite different as to the Family he came of the Voyages he undertook the Place and Manner of his Death But most of all when they speak of the Laws he made and the Commonwealth he foundedThey cannot be brought to agree as to the very  Age  when he livedTIMAEUS conjectures that there were two of his Name and in different Times but that the one being more famous than the other Men gave to Him the Glory of both their Exploits  Plutarch in Lycurgo  "  Hence it appears that the true History of this Lawgiver was lost in the Darkness of fabulous and obscure Ages And that as to the Beginnings of this Commonwealth we have nothing to depend on but the traditionary Rumours of a barbarous and lying Period Now this seems to be fairly weighed down by the internal Evidence arising from the Nature of the Establishment itself For it was indeed  "the Establishment of barbarous Manners carried into Permanency by political Institutions"  That Mankind should be  carry'd back  to  This  from a State of  Humanity  and  Civilization  that they should quit private Property Money Commerce Decency domestic Comforts Wives and Children and give them up to the Possession of the Public is a Contradiction to all the known Powers and Passions of the human Mind To effect a  Change  of  Government only  is a Work sufficient for the Abilities of  the greatest Legislator But to overturn all the preestablished Habits of the Head and Heart to destroy or reverse all the fixed Associations Maxims Manners and Principles of a whole civilized Community were a Labour which might well be ranked among the most extravagant Legends of fabulous GREECE  On the other Hand to  bring forward  a Tribe of untaught Savages  one Degree  towards  Civilization  and  there  to  fix  themto assign equal Portions of Land to those among whom Lands laid in Commonto introduce Iron Money where  no Money  had been in Useto prohibit Commerce where Commerce was almost unknownto make the Girls dance naked in Public where they had never known the decent Use of Cloathsto allow of Theft and Homicide under certain Limitations where  Both  had been practised without Limitationto make Wives at Times a public Property where promiscuous Concubinage had prevailed  to give Children a public Education where no Education had taken PlaceThese might all seem the natural and practicable Efforts of a  Pagan  Legislator  Thus the Formation of the  Spartan  Republic seems clearly accounted for A Tribe of untaught Savages were brought forward by LYCURGUS one Degree towards Civilization and Humanity and There fixed by severe Institutions  The Fate of AGIS their patriot King confirms this Solution He with a Degree of public Virtue seldom seen in any Station attempted to bring back the corrupt State to its first rigorous Institutions But That which LYCURGUS could establish among untaught Savages AGIS found impracticable among a corrupted People He was seized imprisoned and murdered by a Faction in his Attempt to restore Freedom to a degenerate Republic  If the Argument here alledged be just concerning the first Institution of this  Republic it follows what indeed seems probable in its own Nature that the strongest political Institutions may be formed on the savage State of Man In this Period the Legislator hath few or no prior Institutions to contend with and therefore can form a System of Legislation consistent with itself in all its Parts While the Lawgiver who reforms a State already modeled and corrupted must content himself with such partial Regulations as the Force of prior Establishments and public Habits will admit  The long united State of this Republic afford a Proof against a political Maxim commonly received  "That Divisions are necessary to a free State and that inward Tranquillity is a certain Symptom of its approaching Ruin"  For from the History of SPARTA it appears that during the Space of at least five hundred Years intestine Divisions were unknown This common and mistaken Maxim adopted by almost all political  Writers  Among others by MACHIAVEL and MONTESQUIEU  hath been founded on a Supposition that where Opinion is  free  it must ever be  divided  The  Spartan  Commonwealth presents a clear Proof of the Reverse That Opinion may be  free  yet still  united  But this  free Union  can only be the happy Effect of an early and rigorous Education by which the growing Minds of the Community are voluntarily led by public Institutions into  one common Channel  of  Habit Principle  and  Action  PLUTARCH tells us that the Effect of this entire Union was so conspicuous in SPARTA that  "the Commonwealth resembled  one  great and powerful Person  actuated by one Soul  rather than a State composed of  many  Individuals  In Lycurgo  "  It appears that the Institutions of the  Spartan  Republic were admirably calculated for each other's Support while  their perfect Union was maintained And further that when an Inroad was made into any one of them the Ruin of the Whole was inevitable  "Its Institutions were admirably calculated for each other's Support while their perfect Union was maintained"  Because they tended strongly to prevent the  first Inroads  of  Temptation  to the  Mind  the very  first Impulses  of  selfish Passion  The equal Partition of Lands and Goods took away all Hope of Superiority in Wealth The Introduction of Iron Money rendered Wealth cumbersome and untractable The Prohibition of Commerce prevented the Materials of Luxury The Banishment of elegant Arts prevented the first Conception of them Their public Meals eaten in common cut off the Hope nay prevented the Desire of all private Indulgence of the Palate the Disorders of Intemperance To secure these rigid Institutions the public Education of their Children was ordained lest private Passion  should mix its Alloy with the rigorous Appointments of the State Thus the Republic was so round and compact in all its Parts that it might seem to defy the Attacks of the most powerful Enemy  "But supposing an Inroad made into any one of its capital Institutions the Ruin of the Whole was inevitable"  For its several Parts receiving their Strength from each other were therefore mutually  dependent  and the Whole being an austere Contradiction to the natural Appetites of Man the least Inroad of Indulgence naturally led on to more forcible Temptations Thus  Inequality  of Possessions brought in  Wealth  and  Poverty Wealth  brought in  Luxury Poverty  gave Birth to  Envy  and  Avarice  Licentiousness and Faction thus crept in and the Fall of SPARTA was  inevitable  Yet even amidst the  Decays  of this Republic the Force of a rigorous Education essentially mixed with the Principles of  the State was still conspicuous The Power of Manners and Maxims thus imbibed was so untractable even in the declining Periods of the  Spartan  Commonwealth that PHILOPAEMEN after many fruitless Attempts to annihilate its Influence declared  "that the only effectual Method of destroying SPARTA must be in  dissolving  the  Education  of their  Youth  Plutarch in Philopaem  "  This Analysis is clearly confirmed by PLUTARCH in the following Passages  "Since we may blame the Legislators of common Rank who through Want of Power or Wisdom commit Mistakes in the Formation of fundamental Laws how much more may we censure the Conduct of NUMA who for the Reputation of his Wisdom only being called by the general Voice of an unsettled People to be their King did not in first Place constitute Laws for the Education of Children and Discipline of  Youth For Want of which Men become seditious and turbulent and live not peaceable in their Families and Tribes But when they are inured from their Cradle to good Principles and imbibe from their Infancy the Rules of Morality they receive such Impressions of Virtue as convinces them of that Advantage which mutual Concord brings to a Commonwealth This with many others was one of the Policies of LYCURGUS And was of singular Force in the Confirmation and Establishment of his Laws"    "Hence the  Spartans  having sucked in these Principles with their Milk were possessed with a most reverend Esteem of all his Institutions So that the Fundamentals of his Laws continued in Force for above five hundred Years without any Violation  Comparison of NUMA and LYCURGUS  "  Such then was the Force of concurrent Manners and Principles all centering on one Point impressed on the infant Mind  and continued by a Variety of rigorous InstitutionsThus the Strength of the  Spartan  Republic like the firmcompacted Weight of the  Macedonian Phalanx  bore down every opposing Power  SECT VIII Of the Republic of Athens  WE have seen the Force of Manners Principles in the strong Formation the  Unanimity  and  Continuance  of the  Spartan  State We shall now see the Effects of the  Want  of Manners and Principles in the weak Establishment the unceasing  Factions  and early  Dissolution  of the Commonwealth of ATHENS  It appears above that LYCURGUS probably forming his People in the first and earliest Period of Civilization was thus enabled to establish a perfect Republic SOLON on the contrary having a  corrupted  People to  reform  could only institute such a Kind of Government as their  preestablished  Habits Vices and Forms of Polity could admit  Here we discover the Foundation of that striking Remark of SOLON himself  "That he gave not the  Athenians  the  best  Laws that could be  given  but the  best  they were  capable  of  receiving  Plut Solon  "  The first and ruling Defect in the Institution of this Republic seems to have been  "the total Want of an established Education suited to the Genius of the State"  There appears not to have been any public regular or prescribed Appointment of this Kind beyond what Custom had accidentally introduced 'Tis true that the Parents often had Masters to instruct their Children in the  gymnastic  Arts and in  Music  Which last in the ancient Acceptation of the Word included  Poem  as well as  Melody  'Tis farther true that the Poems thus taught  their Children included often the great Actions but withal the Vices of Gods and ancient Heroes  See a Dissertation on Music and Poetry Sect v  Yet in this first and ruling Circumstance in the Institution of a free State the Parents were much at Liberty to do as seemed good to them Hence a dissimilar and discordant System of Manners and Principles took Place while some youthful Minds were imbibed with proper and  virtuous  Principles some with  no  Principles and some with  vicious  Principles with such as must therefore on the Whole tend to shake the Foundations of true Freedom  The second ruling Defect in the Constitution of this Republic was the Establishment of an unmixed and absolute Democracy This naturally arose from the  licentious  State of  Manners  and  Prinples  which SOLON found already prevalent among the  People  A  virtuous  People would have been content to have  shared  the legislative Power with the higher Ranks of the Commonwealth But a  licentious  People naturally grasped the Whole as the likliest Means in their deluded Eye of gratifying their own unbridled Passions From this partial Distribution of Power the State was blindly ruled by the Dregs of the Community For  All  who were of Ability to maintain a  Horse  were admitted to the Rank of  Magistracy  Plut in Solon  And all who were  admitted  to the Rank of  Magistracy  were  excluded  from any Share in the  legislative Power  Ib  Hence it followed that  "All they who possessed the  Legislative Power  were such as were  not  of  Ability  to  maintain  a  Horse"    "Do not you despise said SOCRATES to his Pupil ALCIBIADES who was afraid to speak in Presence of the  Athenian  People do not you despise That  Cobler  I do reply'd the Youth Do not you rejoyned the Philospher equally contemn that  Cryer  and yon  TentMaker  ALCIBIADES confessing that he did then said SOCRATES "Is not the Body of the  Athenian People  composed of Men  like these  And therefore when you  despise  the  Individuals  why should you fear the  Whole  Aeliani Var Hist L ii C  "  A hopeful Tribe of  Legislators  and such as might naturally be supposed to give Rise to that Licentiousness Discord and Ruin in which they were soon swallowed up  From this weak and imperfect Establishment founded on the Caprices of an ignorant unprincipled and  licentious Populace  all the subsequent  Factions  which ended in the  Ruin  of this  Republic  are clearly derived  Even SOLON the original Legislator outlived the Commonwealth he had formed On his Departure from ATHENS  Factions  immediately arose PISISTRATUS the first ruling Demagogue  led  the  People  obtained a Guard seized the Castle and  established  a  Tyranny  Plut in Solon  We need go no farther into the History of this Republic for a Discovery of the Causes of its final Ruin It is true that an imperfect Semblance of Liberty often appeared amidst the Factions of succeeding Times It is true that Wealth and Luxury contributed to hasten the Fall of ATHENS It is true that PERICLES and ALCIBIADES in their Turn while they seemed to polish the Manners inflamed the Vices of the Populace and led them on to the certain Destruction of the State But for the Ruin of this Commonwealth we need not have Recourse to the Inroads of Wealth or Luxury as the Causes of its Dissolution It resembled a beautiful  Edifice  founded in  Sand  and  Rubbish  Where an  uneducated  an  unprincipled  a  licentious Populace  ruled the State That State was destined to the convulsive Struggles of  Faction  while it lived and then to a  speedy Death  SECT IX Of the Commonwealth of Rome  LET us now pass to a Review of the Commonwealth of ROME In the History and Fate of which we shall find most abundant Proof of the Truths here laid down concerning the Power of Manners and Principles in the Preservation or the Dissolution of public Freedom  MONTESQUIEU remarks finely in his Discourse on this Republic that  "more States have perished thro' a Violation of Manners than thro' a Violation of Laws  Grandeur c  "  The Reason though he does not assign it appears evident on the Principles here given He who violates established  Manners  strikes at the general  Foundation  he who violates  Law  strikes only at a particular Part of the  Superstructure  of the State  In the Republic of SPARTA we have seen the original State of Manners and Principles conspiring strongly to the  Preservation  of the Republic In that of ATHENS we have seen the original State of Manners and Principles tending no less clearly to its  Dissolution  In analysing the original State of Manners and Principles in the  Roman  Commonwealth we shall find a different and  intermediate  State of Things mixing the  Strength  of the  Spartan  with the  Weakness  of the  Athenian  Institutions tending first to  enlarge  and  aggrandize  the Republic and in the End to  corrupt  and  destroy  it  The Manners and Principles of early ROME which tended to enlarge and aggrandize the Republic were A  Love  of their  Country  instilled into their rising Youth Formed chiefly on the Power of  Custom  and more particularly on the  warlike  Genius of the State Their Annals abound with so many Instances of this grand Passion that present Times stand amazed and with Difficulty credit their Story  This Passion founded on an  early  though  not  a  prescribed  Education was so strengthened by their  religious  System that till the fatal Entrance of the Doctrine of EPICURUS no  Roman  was ever known to have violated his Oath  See Montesq Grand des Rom C x Polyb L  Their Principle of  Honour  coincided with that of their Religion It was so strong at the Time of the first Formation of the Republic that the Punishment of  Disgrace  was judged sufficient to deter the People from a Violation of the Laws  "When a Delinquent was cited before the People saith LIVY the  Valerian  Law ordained only that he should be branded as  infamous  Liv Hist L  "  From the Truths laid down above it appears that the Principle of natural  Conscience  must of Course cooperate with these for the Confirmation of civil Freedom The Force of this Principle is no less conspicuous in the early Periods of  Roman  Liberty It arose even into a ferocious Pride of Virtue independent of all outward Testimony which hath distinguished the great Names of ancient ROME from Those of every other People upon Earth  To these we must add the  Equality  of Property the  Mediocrity  of Possession the  Simplicity  of Life which prevailed in early ROME all these were the Outworks that guarded the internal Strength of Manners and Principles and seemed like the Institutions of SPARTA to promise an Eternity of Freedom  But in Spite of all these Foundations of civil Liberty there were three fatal Circumstances admitted into the very Essence of the Republic which contained the  Seeds  of  certain Ruin  While the  Tree  seemed to  flourish  in its full Growth and Vigour  These  like  CankerWorms  lay  eating  at the Root  The first of these was the Neglect of instituting public Laws by which the  Education  of their Children might have been  ascertained  This is justly charged by PLUTARCH as a capital Defect in NUMA's Legislation  See above Sect vii  This Defect when once admitted into the Essence of the State could not easily be rectify'd in succeeding Times The Principle could only have been effectually infused at the general Formation of the whole Mass In Consequence of this Error in the first Concoction the supporting Principles of Freedom were vague and fluctuating For Want of this  preventing  Power the incidental Vices of a Parent were naturally transmitted to his Children and thence to future Ages The rigorous Education of SPARTA was a strong Check to the Proneness of human Nature towards Degeneracy and Corruption Through This every incidental Vice dy'd with its first Possessor While the more lax Institution of the  Roman  Republic suffered every original Taint in Manners  and Principles to be transfused into and to contaminate succeeding Times  The second of these was  "Their Principle of  unlimited Conquest"  Their early Passion for War arose from their  Necessities  On their first Establishment they had neither  Territory  nor  Commerce  They lived by  Plunder  Hence the  ruling Genius  of the  State  was  warlike  Their warlike Genius was  unchecked  by any other Principle Hence unremitted Exercises unceasing Improvements in Discipline increasing Valour and Ferocity arose Thus they attempted to subdue and thus they subdued the World  But such an Empire is utterly  untenable Valour  may  acquire  but cannot  maintain  it The  Body  of such a State is too enormous to be effectually animated by the  Soul  This is a Cause of Ruin so clear that it hath met every Writer's Observation and therefore needs no farther Proof  The third Principle of inevitable Destruction which seems to have been inwrought into the very Essence of the  Roman  Republic was the fatal Principle of  Change  This is a Cause not so obvious and therefore may require a farther Investigation  MONTESQUIEU hath justly observed that one Cause of the  Roman Greatness  was  "their  adopting  any Institution or Custom of other Nations whom they conquer'd provided it was better than their own  Grandeur c C i ii  "  It seems to have escaped the Observation of this great Writer that the same Principle of  Adoption  carried through every Period of the Republic led the Way to its final  Ruin  For altho' in the early Periods when Manners were simple and concurrent Principles were strong this Spirit of  Adoption  was confined to Customs that were  better  than their own yet in the succeeding Periods  when Manners grew more relaxed and Principles were weakened the same Spirit of  Adoption  opened a Door for the Admission of  Customs  that were  pernicious  Thus the Admission of  Change  which in the virtuous Ages led to the  Greatness  in succeeding Times brought on the  Destruction  of the Republic  The sagacious Romans soon found the Consequences of this Defect They saw that through a Want of original  preventive  and salutary Institutions bad Manners were creeping insensibly on the State Hence the Creation of the  Censors  had its Rise An Office which immediately took Cognizance of the Manners of the  Citizens  But this high Office was ineffectual in its End because it had not Power universally to  prevent but  only in Part to  remedy  the Evil Hence while  particular  and  detected Offences  only could be punished by the  Censor  the  Hearts  and  Manners  of the People were laid open to a  general Corruption  from the fatal Principle of  Novelty  and  Adoption  The Danger arising from this Principle manifestly increased with the increasing Empire That  Identity  and  Integrity  of Manners and Principles which is the Soul and Security of every free State gave Way to Manners and Principles wholly  dissimilar  New Maxims of Life new Principles of Religion and Irreligion of Honour and Dishonour of Right and Wrong picked up indiscriminately among the Nations which they conquered by Degrees infused themselves into the Heads and Hearts of the  Roman  Citizens  Here then we see the original Foundation of all the Misery and Ruin which ensued On the Conquest of the  luxurious immoral  and  unprincipled  Tribes of GREECE the  Romans  having no  preventive Remedy  in the Essence of their State of Course  adopted  the  Luxury  the  Immoralities  the  Irreligion  of the conquered People  "It seems to me says the excellent MONTESQUIEU that the  Epicurean  Sect which made its Way into ROME towards the Close of the Republic contributed much to corrupt the Hearts of the  Romans  The  Greeks  had been infatuated with it before them accordingly they were sooner corrupt POLYBIUS tells us that in His Time no  Greek  could be trusted on the Security of his Oath whereas a  Roman  was inevitably bound by it  Grandeur c C x  "  He adds  "CYNEAS having discoursed on the  Epicurean  System at the Table of PYRRHUS FABRICIUS wished that all the Enemies of ROME might hold the  Principles  of  such a Sect  Ib  "  Thus as in the early Periods of the Commonwealth they had adopted the  Virtues  in the later Times they assumed the  Vices  of the conquered Nations Thus by unperceived Gradations the same Principle  "The Admission of  Change  first led to the  Greatness  and then to the  Ruin  of the Republic"  All the particular Consequences that followed were  occasional  and  inevitable  The Rapacity the Factions the civil Wars the enormous Profligacy of Individuals the horrible Calamities of the StateAll these are finely pursued by MONTESQUIEU and were no more than the natural and incidental Effects of this general Cause  "The Loss of Manners and Principles"  Hence the  Progress  and  Retreat  of the  Roman Power  resembled the  Flow  and the  Ebb  of a vast Ocean which rowzed from its Bed by central Concussions  overwhelmed  and  forsook  the  Earth  SECT X How far these Facts can properly be apply'd to the political State of Great Britain  THOUGH the Study of History be often instructive and useful yet in one Respect it becomes the Source of frequent Error even when it is written with Impartiality and Truth This ariseth from a mistaken Application of historical Facts Errors of this Kind are apt to creep into all Reasonings on every Subject where Men and Manners are concerned But they are liable to infect  political  Reasonings above all others  As the political Interests of Men form the principal Subject of History the Reasoner on this Subject hath Recourse to Facts as the best Support of his Argument Yet the Politician seems of all others most liable to be mistaken in the Application of History to his own  Purpose because the political Connexions and Interests of Men are above all others  complicated  and  various  Hence as no two political Constitutions were ever the  same  in  all  their Circumstances though  similar  in  many  so all Arguments drawn from a  partial  Resemblance must be inadequate and inconclusive unless when it appears that no other Circumstances took Place by which That  partial  Resemblance might be  counteracted  and its Effects destroyed  Yet it hath been a Practice too common among political Reasoners from a  partial  Resemblance between two States to infer a  total  one and because they have been  like  in  some  Respects to draw Conclusions as if they had been  like  in  all  Much Caution therefore is necessary in the Application of historical Facts Without This we shall run into perpetual Error Let us then remark some of the most  essential  Circumstances in which the Constitution of the  British  State  differs from those of SPARTA ATHENS and ROME and then draw such Conclusions as may be consistent with these Distinctions  We may lay it down as a fundamental Truth generally acknowledged that the  political  Constitution of GREAT BRITAIN in its  main Outline  is  better modeled  than those of SPARTA ATHENS or ROME The legislative and executive Powers are more equally balanced and more clearly distinguished Now if Laws could support themselves it would follow that this political State must  therefore  be of  longer Duration  But as it hath been made appear that the Duration of free States depends not so much on their mere  Form  as on the  Manners  and  Principles  which support them so nothing can be decided concerning the  Duration  of the  British  State from its mere  external Model  The  Christian  Religion established in BRITAIN is in its own Nature far  superior to that of these ancient Commonwealths The absolute Perfection and glorious Attributes of the Deity the great Principle of universal Charity the particular Duties of Man to Man thence resulting the Sanctions of future Reward and Punishment all these tend to purify and exalt the Soul far beyond the Rites of ancient Paganism For This even in its best Forms was ever built on the History and Examples of deify'd Men whose Lives had often been blotted with the most flagrant Crimes and therefore could never exalt the Heart of Man beyond this weak Principle of ElevationBut as the  Power  of a  Religion  depends not only on its  excellent Genius  but on its being  effectually impressed  on the Mind so no Consequence can be justly drawn from the mere  unapply'd  Excellence of its Nature  That  SelfConsistence  and perfect  Unity  of Parts which distinguished the Republic of SPARTA cannot be expected nor  found in that of BRITAIN For the first was the entire Work of a single Legislator struck out at one Heat all its Institutions conspiring to one End and centering like the Radii of a Circle in one single Point To This the outward Form of Government the internal State of Education of Religion Manners and Principles were uniformly subordinate But at the Time of the  Revolution  which was the first Aera of BRITAIN'S Freedom many prior Institutions and Establishments both in Religion and Policy Manners and Principles had taken Place These had been formed on the fortuitous Events of Time and had resulted from a Variety of contending Parties of  Power  fluctuating at different Periods between the  Kings  the  Nobles  the  Priesthood  and the  People  All these it was impossible for human Art to remove and newmodel without shaking the State to its Foundations Hence though the Form of the  British  Constitution civil and religious be of  unrivaled Excellence yet in its very Birth it came attended with unalterable WeaknessIt wanted that general SelfConsistence that entire Unity of Parts as well as of established Habits Manners and Principles suited to the Genius of the State which was the very Spirit and Support of the  Spartan  Commonwealth In this Circumstance it appears likewise inferior to the  Roman  Commonwealth yet perhaps superior to that of  Athens  The  British  System of Polity and Religion perfect in its leading Parts but imperfectly united and supported is not upheld in its native Power like that of SPARTA by correspondent and effectual Rules of Education The Fundamental Laws of our Country the Principles and Duties of Christianity are indeed occasionally explained and taught in a certain Manner and Degree But it is in the Power of every Private Man to educate his Child not only without a Reverence for These but in an absolute Contempt  of them It is much in every Parent's Option whether he will impress his Childrens Hearts with such Habits and Principles as accord to the Genius of the State or with Impunity suffer them to contract such Manners and Opinions as tend to its Dissolution A Circumstance pregnant with Danger to this free State For hence Manners and Principles its chief Support are liable to be incurably perverted in the Heart at that Time of Life in which alone they can be effectually impressed  In the important Circumstance of  "the Admission of  Change"  or the  "Principle of  Adoption"  the  British  Constitution is contrary to That of SPARTA and nearly on a Level with Those of ATHENS and ROMEForeign Commerce foreign Travel new Manners new Principles new Modes of Dress of Amusement of Luxury are here adopted with a Degree of Avidity almost unboundedHappy would the Writer esteem his  Labours if this Principle which  in some Respects  hath tended so much to the  Improvement  of his Country could in any Degree be checked by his weak Admonitions from  degenerating  into a  Cause  of its  Destruction  The last Circumstance of Note here to be remarked is  "The Difference of Character among the several  Ranks  of the Community in these ancient free States and That of  Britain"  In Point of  Knowledge  and  Ability  the Difference was great between the  Nobles  and the  People  in these ancient States In BRITAIN the  Nobles  and the  People  in their  legislative  Capacity are fairly on a  Level  When ALCIBIADES addressed the legislative Body of the  Athenian  People he addressed  Coblers Brasiers Tanners TentMakers  When the People of ROME retired in Discontent to the sacred Mountain they were appeased by the Fable of the  Belly Head  and  Hands  A  Lord  of Parliament would make but a sorry Figure  who should come armed with  such  an  Apologue  for the  Conviction  of a  British  House of  Commons  Again In each of these ancient Republics the collective Body of the  People  were much of one uniform Character being Inhabitants of the same City and nearly on a Level with Respect to Employment and Property In ATHENS they were all  Artisans  or  Tradesmen  In SPARTA and ROME they were all  Soldiers  A low Degree of Knowledge was their general Lot For much Knowledge can only be acquired by much Leisure which their Occupations did not allow The People of SPARTA were intentionally virtuous Those of ATHENS were corrupt Those of ROME were of a mixed Character As these free States voted not by Representatives the Presence of the People was necessary in all Decisions of a public Nature Hence such a People from their Ignorance Wants collective Presence and Pride of Power must ever and suddenly be  swayed by the Eloquence of public Demagogues  But the  collective  Body of the People of BRITAIN are of a Nature and Character less uniform and essentially different They may properly be divided into two Classes  "The  People  of the  Kingdom"  and  "the  Populace  of its  Cities"  The  Populace  of its  Cities  resemble Those of ATHENS in most Things except only that they are not possessed of the  legislative Power  For the  People  of ATHENS were  "a Body of  Labourers  and  Mechanics  who earned their Bread with the Sweat of their Brows too generally ignorant and illeducated too generally prosligate in Manners and void of Principle"  But the  People  of this  Kingdom  in their  collective  Body are upon the Whole of a quite different Character For under this Title are properly comprehended  "all Those who send Representatives for the Counties to Parliament"  This Catalogue  will include the landed  Gentry  the beneficed Country  Clergy  many of the more considerable  Merchants  and Men in  Trade  the substantial and industrious  Freeholders  or  Yeomen  A collective Body of Men with all their incidental Failings as  different  in Character from the  Populace  of any great  City  as the  Air  of RICHMOND HILL from that of BILLINGSGATE or WAPPING  SECT XI Of the general State of Manners and Principles about the Time of the Revolution  AT this famed Period it is evident that the Manners and Principles of the Nation did upon the Whole tend to the Establishment of  Liberty  otherwise Liberty had not been established This Revolution was perhaps the noblest public  Reform  that ever was made in any State And such a Reform nothing but the  Prevalence  of  upright Manners  and  Principles  could have  effected  The  religious  Principle of  Protestant Christianity  seems to have taken the Lead even of the Love of civil Freedom The Dread of  Popery  was at least equal to That of  arbitrary Power  The national  Honour  and  Conscience  on the whole coincided with and confirmed the  Christian  Principle These three united Powers raised Liberty to the brightest Throne she ever sat on A Throne which nothing but their  Contraries  can  shake  Yet notwithstanding the unrivaled Excellence of this civil and religious Establishment there could be little Hope of its immediate and perfect Efficacy Declaimers may express their Wonder that a System so perfect should not at once attain its End But they who take a nearer View of the Manners and Principles of those Times will rather say that the Tumults and Dissentions which instantly arose were in their own Nature  inevitable  The Manners of the Times tho' in the Main favourable to Liberty were mixed with a gross Alloy of  private Licentiousness  And hence factious Measures of Course arose from the Prospect of Power or Gain  See  Estimate  V i Part  The preceding Age had caught a strong Tincture of  Vice  from the prevalent Example of a debauched Court The  Education  of Children was still left in an  imperfect  State This great Revolution having confined itself to the Reform of  public  Institutions without ascending to the first great Fountain of political Security  "the private and effectual Formation of the  infant  Mind"  The  religious  Principle though chiefly consonant with the new Constitution and indeed its leading Support was in  Part  at  Variance  with itA numerous Body of  Papists  held a whole System of Principles diametrically opposite to its most essential DictatesAnother Body of Protestant  Jacobites  were at War with the Principles of the State For they held an hereditary and unalienable Right of Kings founded on certain  mistaken  Passages of the sacred ScripturesA third Body of Men though they allowed the Necessity and Justice of the Revolution on the Principle of an  Abdication  yet still retained an Opinion at Variance with the State They asserted an  independent Hierarchy  vindicated a religious  Intolerance  and on some misconstrued Passages of Scripture affirmed the Duty of a  passive Obedience  without LimitationA fourth Body was That of some bigoted  Dissenters  who not content with a religious Toleration which had been justly granted them aimed on a mistaken Principle of Religion to erect their own System upon the Ruins of the established ChurchAll these Parties held  religious Principles  at  Variance  with the  Laws  of  Freedom  The Principle of  Honour  tho' in many and great Instances cooperating with that of Religion yet when not founded on it was often at  Variance  with it This Principle as it hath appeared in modern Times was in its Origin chiefly  Military  Hence it hath generally taken Cognizance of Actions not as they are  just  or  unjust  but merely as they are  splendid  or  mean brave  or  cowardly  Thus it overlooks all Laws both human and divine Hence unbounded Contempt of Enemies furious PartyRage unlimited Resentment and Revenge  were  and still  are  its favourite Dictates Thus it hath come to pass that Honour often forbids what Religion approves and approves what Religion forbids This uncontrouled and dangerous Principle mixed itself with the licentious Manners of the Times Hence Attachments Resentments and PartyRage arose and were persisted in essentially contradictory to the Principles of Freedom  Consonant with what hath been above delivered the Principle of  Conscience  did not  correct  but  followed  one or other of these various Principles according to their Predominance and Power And  These  being incurably discordant among themselves the national Ideas of Right and Wrong Just and Unjust which were formed on  These  could not but prove themselves of the like  motley  and  disagreeing  Complexion  Here then we behold the natural and unavoidable Source of all the Dissentions that disgraced the Reigns of King WILLIAM and Queen ANNE And while some affect to wonder how so generous a System of Religion and Polity so noble a Constitution in Church and State could fail to produce private Virtue and public Happiness we now obtain an additional Proof of the irresistable Power of  preestablished Manners  and  Principles  when at  Variance  with the  Laws  of  Freedom  We may see even to Demonstration  that the  Animosities  of  Those Times  were  not incidental  but  inevitable  SECT XII Of the Changes in Manners and Principles through the succeeding Times  THE Accession of GEORGE the First seemed the Aera of perfect Freedom And if an excellent King at the Head of an unrivaled Constitution could have secured Liberty it had now been fixed on immoveable Foundations  The Alloy of  licentious Manners  and  contradictory Principles  which had tarnished the preceding Reign still maintained their Influence But the declared and zealous Advocates for Liberty now assumed the Reins of Power and began more effectually to combat those  false Principles  which were at  Enmity  with the  State  Would to God these intentional Friends of public Liberty had been as much the Friends of private Virtue and Religion They would not then have undermined the Foundations while they were building the Superstructure of civil Freedom  The Seeds of Irreligion had for some Time been privately fermenting But they did not break forth into open Growth till about this Period'Tis remarkable that BURNET  Conclusion of his History  enumerating the Dangers by which the State was threatened in the Year makes no Mention of  Irreligion  as an Evil worth being obviated But soon after this Pestilence came on with a terrible Swiftness and Malignity  The slavish Principle of absolute  NonResistance  and an  independent Hierarchy  were still prevalent in Part especially among the  Clergy  To combat  these  and expose them to the public Contempt certain Writers were encouraged by Those  in Power A vigorous and effectual Attack was made on the Advocates for Despotism But in their Zeal against Tyranny these Writers supplanted Freedom  They assailed  Superstition  with such Weapons as destroyed  Religion  They opposed  Intolerance  by Arguments and Ridicule which tended to sweep away all public  Establishments  While they only aimed perhaps to contend for  Freedom  of  Thought  they unwarily sapped the Foundation of all salutary  Principles  See the Div Leg of Moses Dedication Vol ii p c  CATO's  Letters  and the  Independent Whig  among many other Tracts of less Note seem palpable Instances of this Truth The one was written in Defence of  civil  the other of  religious  Liberty Yet both tended in their general Tour to relax those Principles by which alone Freedom either civil or religious can be sustained By their intemperate Insults on religious Institutions by their public and  avowed Contempt of all Opinions Principles or if you please Prejudices instilled into the infant Mind as the necessary Regulators of human Conduct By exalting unaided human Reason far beyond the Rank she holds in Nature By debasing all those Assistances which the Wisdom of Ages had prescribed and consecrated as the necessary Means of correcting her vague and wandering Dictates  While These Authors made this illjudged and perhaps undesigned Attack on the Foundations of civil Liberty others made a still bolder and more fatal Inroad and opened a wider Door for  Licentiousness  by an Attack on  Christianity  itself  In this List of Enemies to their Country it must be a Mortification to every Friend of Virtue and Liberty to find the noble Author of the  Characteristics  His Morals were unblemished his Love of Virtue and Freedom indisputable But by confounding two Things which he saw  accidently united  though in their Nature  essentially distinguished  he polluted his  Arguments  against  Intolerance  with the grossest  Buffoonries  on  Christianity  There is no Doubt but that the current Reasonings of the Times had brought him to a Habit of Belief that all This was harmless Pastime To this Purpose he seems to speak himself  "'Tis certain that in Matters of Learning and Philosophy the Practice of  pulling down  is  pleasanter  and affords more  Entertainment  than that of  building  and  setting up  In the literate warring World the  springing  of  Mines  the  blowing up  of Towers Bastions and Ramparts of Philosophy with  Systems Hypotheses Opinions  and  Doctrines  into the Air is a  Spectacle  of all other the most naturally  rejoicing  Miscell iii Chap  "  These intemperate Sallies of Gaiety may serve as a Comment on the Passage already cited from CATO's  Letters  They are a clear and concurrent Indication of the  ruling Principle of the Times when  Opinions  and  Doctrines  began to be derided as Things  indifferent  The noble Writer was naturally led to embrace this growing Error of the Times by a too flattering Opinion which he had imbibed concerning unassisted human Nature as being sufficient of itself to establish the unerring Practice of Virtue unless beforehand sophisticated by servile Institutions  The noble Writer indeed attempts a Vindication of this licentious Conduct by an Appeal to the Practice of ancient GREECE and ROME There he tells us  "Philosophy  had a free Course and was permitted as a  Balance  against  Superstition  And while some Sects such as the  Pythagorean  and latter  Platonic  joined in with the Superstition and Enthusiasm of the Times the EPICUREAN the  Academic  and  others  were allowed to use all the Force of  Wit  and  Raillery  against it  Letter on Enthusiasm  "  This hath a plausible  Appearance Yet I am perswaded the noble Author would have looked grave had he been put in Mind of the Remark which FABRICIUS made on the  Epicurean  Sect  "that he wished  such Principles  to all the  Enemies  of ROME  See above p  "  Or had he recollected that when the  irreligious  System of EPICURUS prevailed in GREECE and ROME these  unprincipled  and  profligate  States were on the  Eve  of their  Destruction  Soon after the Author of the  Characteristics  another more dissolute Writer appeared on the public Stage I mean the Author of  "The Fable of the Bees"  This Gentleman as hath been observed above leveled his Artillery on the whole Fabric of  Morals  and  Religion  His System was diametrically opposite to that of Lord SHAFTESBURY The one was founded on the  unaided Excellence  the other on the  incurable Depravity  of  human Nature  But now the vagrant Spirit of Irreligion  was Abroad and the most inconsistent Productions were greedily swallowed provided only they  disgraced  CHRISTIANITY  The Avidity with which these Compositions were received soon emboldened a succeeding Writer to make a formal Attack on the Religion of his Country  Christianity as old as the Creation  now appeared In which the Gospel was grosly misrepresented insulted and disgraced and in Compliance with the ruling Malady of the Times that  poor  and  sickly  Creature  "unassisted  Human Reason"  was vainly exalted to the  Throne  of ETERNAL TRUTH  Other inferior Workmen in this patriot Amusement of blowing up the Religion of their Country such as WOOLSTON and MORGAN I pass unnoticed  In a succeeding Period and down to the present Time the Evil hath increased and been compleated For now not only  revealed  but  natural  Religion hath been publicly attacked in the Writings  of Lord BOLINGBROKE An Author who stands convicted of designed Profligacy even on his own Confession  "Some Men there are  the Pests  of  Society I think them  who pretend a great Regard to Religion in general but who take every Opportunity of declaiming publicly against that System of Religion or at least that Church Establishment which is received in BRITAIN  Dissert on Parties Let xii  "  You See this patriot Writer proclaims his Abhorrence even of Those who assault the  OutWorks  of Religion And then with Modesty unparallel'd proceeds to blow up the  Citadel  The last of these patriot Worthies by which the present Age stands distinguished is the Author of  "Essays philosophical and moral"  Who disdaining the vulgar Practice of a particular Attack  undermines  all the  Foundations  of  Religion revealed  and  natural  and with a Pen truly  Epicurean  dissolves at once all  the  Fears  of the  Guilty  the  Comforts  of the  Afflicted  and the  Hopes  of the  Virtuous  Such then hath been the Progress of this public Evil which hath proceeded almost without  Cognizance  from the Magistrate Instead of  That  it is well known that some of these public Enemies of their Country and Mankind were formerly pensioned and others privately encouraged by Those in Power How This came to pass and aggravated the growing Evil it is now necessary to point out  We have seen above that a Foundation was laid for this in an illconducted Opposition to the Enemies of Freedom They who were employed to sweep away  false Principles  imprudently struck at  all Principles  But beyond This a famous Minister assumed and long held the Reins of Power There seems not the least Foundation for the Charge laid against him by his Enemies  "That his Design was to inslave his Country"  Neither had he any  natural Inclination to corrupt Practices Yet he rather chose to rule by These than to resign his Power Nay perhaps he thought this corrupt System the only one which under the Circumstances of Those Times could support that illustrious Family which was brought in as the happy Support of Liberty Farther perhaps he judged This the only possible Expedient for prolonging a  Peace  which He thought  necessary  till Time should wear out the false Principles on which the expelled Family still held their Influence in the Minds of the PeopleFrom  some  or  all  of these Motives He not only  gave Way  to Corruption but  encouraged  it To this End  Religion  was  discountenanced  And  Christian Principle  which would have been the firmest  Friend  of  Liberty  was  discarded  as the  Enemy  of  Corruption  In the mean Time  Trade Wealth  and  Luxury  increased These in their  Extreme  having an unalterable Tendency  to a Dissolution of Manners and Principles went Hand in Hand with the Progress of Corruption which in its most improved State this mistaken Minister left as a lasting Legacy to his Country  See an Estimate c Vol ii p c  The Effects of this established System of Corruption did not immediately appear But about the Year fiftyseven they came to their  Crisis  advancing with the Appearances even of  public Ruin  That powerful Correctress NECESSITY gave a  temporary Union  to all Parties and a  temporary Restoration  to the  State  See ib Vol i p the last  But from the Deduction of Causes here given it was natural to expect that as soon as  Danger  ceased  Faction  would arise  It follows also that it must arise on Foundations widely different from Those in the Reigns of WILLIAM and ANNE For the Dissentions of these  past  Times were chiefly founded in  false Principles  Those of the  present  Age on a  Want of Principle  For the false Principles which disgraced the Protestants of the last Age are vanished The mistaken Interpretations of Scripture on which the  Jacobite  the  Tory  the  bigoted Dissenter  founded their various Pretensions and Attempts are  now  held in general Derision A Preacher of whatever religious Congregation who should  now  advance these obsolete StateHeterodoxies would be the Contempt of his wiser Audience  Nay what is more these false Principles tending to Despotism are generally banished even from the Breasts of the Clergy except only a very few of the most aged For the Bishops being appointed by the Patrons of Liberty have been such as held Principles consistent with the Freedom of the State And much Caution having been required of them and used by them in the Appointments of their Clergy the general Complexion  of this Body hath changed from That of being the  Enemies  to That of being the  Friends  of Freedom  Much it were to be wished that along with the  Tares  the  Wheat  had not also perished But the general System of  Manners  being  relaxed  though  refined  See the Estimate Part i  and  Education  still left more and more  imperfect  the Principle of  Religion  being unhappily  destroyed  among certain Ranks and  weakened  among  others  Ib  That of  Honour  being thus left to its own  false  and  fantastic  Dictates  Ib  and  Conscience  naturally following the  Whims  of its  untutored  Parent  Licentiousness  and  Faction  founded on a  Want  of  Principle  cannot but arise and stand among the  "leading Characters  of the  present Times"  SECT XIII Among what Ranks Licentiousness and Faction may most probably be expected  THOUGH this Want of Principle must naturally infect every Rank of Men in a certain Degree yet some Ranks stand more exposed to it than others  And that we may give as little Offence as possible while we speak the Truth let it be observed that all Orders of Men being born with an equal Tendency to Virtue or Vice their adopting the One or falling into the Other depends chiefly on the Temptations to which their  Rank  exposes them  Let us consider the Temptations to Licentiousness and Faction to which the  leading Ranks  stand exposed  Wealth and Power give Opportunities of Indulgence Indulgence naturally inflames AppetiteFlattery awakens contempt and Contempt weakens the Fear  of Offence or ShameLaws which bind little Men are often too weak for Great onesLeisure when not dignify'd by suitable Accomplishments ends in Idleness and Idleness is the Parent and the Nurse of licentious Folly To such Temptations do the  Great  stand exposed in the important Article of  Manners  With Respect to the  Principle  of  Religion  their present Situation is no less unfavourable Dissolute Opinions flatter their disordered Passions Nor will they ever want Sycophants to present this alluring Bait to their DesiresThe Maxims of Irreligion are now so generally established among Those with whom the young Men of Fashion converse that they must be peculiarly fortunate if they escape the  Infection  Wherever This Taint is given the Principles of  Honour  and  Conscience  become vague and ineffectual if considered as the Supports of Liberty Certain  Delicacies  of  personal  Conduct they may produce but can never rise to an  unbiassed and steady Prosecution of the  public Welfare  Another Circumstance unfavourable to the  public  Virtue of the higher Ranks presents itself Their Situation leads them to  expect  and to  claim  the great and  lucrative Offices  of the State I need not  here  point out how strongly This tends to betray them into the Extremes of selfish Views Ambition PartyRage Licentiousness and Faction  See the Estimate c Vol i Part  Add to all these Considerations their frequent and longcontinued Meetings in the Capital A Circumstance which from the powerful Effects of  free Communication  cannot but inflame all these Causes of political Dissention  If we next examine the State of the  Populace  of the great Cities we shall find that Their Situation naturally exposes them to such Temptations as lead to factious Conduct when not early fortify'd by a virtuous Education They  are often urged by  Want  of which  Discontent  and  Envy  are the inevitable Effects They are let loose to every Impulse of Appetite by frequent Opportunity and Secrecy of Action They are tempted by wicked Examples inflamed by evil Communication and intoxicating Liquors And though the industrious Mechanic may sometimes escape the Infection yet the Life of the  uninstructed Poor  in great Cities is too commonly a horrid Compound of Riot and Distress Rapacity and Thieving Prostitution and Robbery Wickedness and Despair  Now if this Body of Men be indeed what Candour itself cannot deny  "too generally ignorant and illeducated too generally profligate in Manners and void of Principle"  it follows that like  "the  Athenian Populace  of old they must be liable to the  Seduction  of artful Men  the ready  Tools  of every unprincipled  Leader  who may choose to misguide them to the Ends of  Licentiousness  and  Faction  But  "The  PEOPLE  of  GREAT BRITAIN as above distinguished  See p  are of a Character essentially different from both These The landed  Gentry  the Country  Clergy  the more considerable  Merchants  and Men in Trade the substantial and industrious  Freeholders  and  Yeomen"  possess a  middle  State of Life which guards them from many of those Temptations that surround the  higher  and the  lower  Ranks Their  imaginary  Wants are  fewer  than those of the  Great  Their  real  Wants are  fewer  than those of the  Poor  Hence Their Appetites are less inflamed to EvilTheir Education generally seconds this happy Situation in a certain Degree Though imperfect it is commonly more consistent with the main Outlines of public Law than that of the superior or inferior RanksTheir Principles of Religion confirm this Education They stand not generally exposed to the Infection of dissolute Opinions  Their Sentiments of  Honour  and  Conscience  are most commonly built on the  Doctrines  of  Christianity  Their  Numbers  and their  Station  conspire to  exclude  them from a  general Claim  to the lucrative Offices of the State Their  collective Knowledge  is of sufficient Reach to prevent their  general Seduction  to the Purposes of  Licentiousness  Their  Dispersion  and rural Life prevent those continued and unrestrained Communications which are alike fatal to private and public Virtue  Let not the Writer be misunderstood There are Examples of Integrity and Dishonour of Virtue and Vice among all Degrees of Men He only points out the Circumstances which naturally tend upon the Whole to form the several Ranks into these distinct Characters  From this View of the several Ranks it follows that although  "The  People  of this Kingdom"  must inevitably partake of the various Manners and Principles of the  Great  and the  Populace  with which  they at Times communicate though they be subject to the common Failings of Men and to the  incidental  Inroads of Licentiousness from  higher  and  lower  Lifeyet upon the Whole and considered as one  collective Body  they stand comparatively clear of many Temptations to Vice and therefore must naturally be least exposed to the Influence of  Licentiousness  and  Faction  One Consequence arising from their  Dispersion  must not pass unnoticed It not only prevents the general Depravation of their Manners and Principles but likewise prevents their  uniting  in large  Bodies  upon all  slight  Occasions Hence though they are apt to  doubt  nay to be  alarmed  on the  factious Clamours  of the  Capital  yet they are not rowzed into  Action  but on  singular  and  important  Emergencies  To conclude They are a  great  but  quiescent  Power on whose  collective Knowledge  and  Integrity  the Freedom and Fate of this Nation must  finally  depend In  the last Age through the Influence of  false Principles  preestablished or infused they had wellnigh shaken the Foundations of Liberty  See above p  In the present  these  mistaken Principles being  no more  They are now  "the firmest  Bulwark  of BRITAIN's  Freedom"  SECT XIV Of the most effectual Means of detecting Licentiousness and Faction  WHERE Faction is founded on false  Principles  it is easily  detected  because it is generally  avowed  It implies no moral  Depravity  but only an  Error  of the Mind And he who holds this  Error  is not naturally  ashamed  of it because he holds it as a  Truth  But where Faction is founded on Licentiousness and Want of Principle it  cannot be so easily detected For as it implies a moral Depravity it will naturally attempt to  veil  itself and to this End will assume the  Garb  and  Appearance  of  Freedom  The favourite Subject of its Clamours will be the  Misconduct  of Those who  govern  And in a Country where Liberty is justly ranked among the greatest national Blessings the most plausible Pretence of Faction will be  "to load the executive Power with the Charge of Despotism"  In every free State there will frequently occur certain Subjects and Measures  "of  doubtful Expediency"  These in the wide Field of political Contention may justly be stiled  "the  debateable Grounds"  On these doubtful Points even the Friends of Liberty may sometimes differ Therefore the Patrons of Faction will naturally lay hold on these as the most successful and effectual Means of State Distraction Because Thus they may hope to mingle  with and to pass for the Friends of Freedom  When therefore such doubtful Measures become the Subject of political Contention it may be difficult to determine from the mere Circumstance of  Opinion who  are the Friends of Liberty and  who  the Abettors of Faction Because in these Points there may be an incidental Difference of Opinion even among the Friends of Liberty themselves  A much surer Determination may be formed on the  Manner  and  Conduct  of the  dissenting Party  For the Friend of Liberty having no selfish Views will be rational honest equitable in the Prosecution of his Wishes He who is actuated by the Spirit of Licentiousness and Faction will be irrational dishonest iniquitous  Let us then endeavour to particularize these distinctive  Marks  or  Characters  Thus shall we best be able to determine  "who  are the  Friends  of  Liberty  and  who  the  Abettors  of  Licentiousness  and  Faction"  SECT XV Of the Characteristic Marks of Liberty  THESE which follow are perhaps some of the clearest  Characteristics  of the Spirit of  Liberty  By which the Friends of public Freedom though dissentient from any Measure of Government will be evidently distinguished  Each  of these Marks may seem  decisive  even when  separately  viewed But to do Justice to this Argument it will be necessary to consider and  weigh  them in  Union  because as they in Part  depend  on  each other  they will  illustrate each other  and at once  receive  and  give  additional  Confirmation    "The Friend of Liberty will endeavour to preserve that just Balance of divided Power established by Law for the Security of Freedom"  Because the  public Welfare  is the leading Object of his Wishes and can only be effectually  obtained by the Preservation of such a Balance  This will be the general Aim and End of the true Friend of Liberty This  End  will be prosecuted by  suitable Means  and its  Reality  will be  confirmed  and  illustrated  by these which follow    "He will be attached to Measures without respecting Men"  Because the Passions and Interests of Individuals ought to yield to the public Weal    "He will be generally selfconsistent both in Speech and Action"  Because the public Welfare being the uniform Object of his Pursuits This can only be steadily and effectually promoted on clear and uniform Principles    "He will not attempt to inflame an ignorant Populace against their legal Governors"  Because an ignorant Populace are in all Cases unqualify'd to decide on the Measures of Government    "His Debates either in the Senate or from the Press will be void of undistinguishing  and injurious Imputations on any whole Bodies of Men who may differ from him in Opinion"  Because Truth and the public Welfare being his desired End he will clearly seé that  others  have the same Right of  approving  as  Himself  hath of  disapproving  the Measures of Government    "He will not industriously and indiscriminately defame the private Characters of the Individuals who differ from him in Opinion"  Because Calumny thrown on Individuals is a still more aggravated Crime than That which is promiscuously aimed at Bodies of Men  SECT XVI Of the first characteristic Mark of Licentiousness and Faction  THOUGH we have seen that the Patrons of Faction will attempt to mix and confound themselves with the  Friends of Liberty yet in Spite of their Pretences they will be detected by the following characteristic Marks which will stand in  clear Opposition  to Those of  Freedom  These like the former may seem sufficiently decisive even when  separately  viewed But to do Justice to this Argument it will in the same Manner be necessary to  consider  and  weigh  them in  Union  Because as they in Part  depend  on  each other  they will  illustrate each other  and at once  receive  and  give  additional  Confirmation    "The Leaders of Faction being naturally of the higher Ranks  See above Sect xiii  would aim to establish an  aristocratic Power  and  inslave  both  Prince  and  People  to their own Avarice and Ambition"  Thus if any Set of Men had in  former  Times been in Power and while in Power had oppressed embarrassed Majesty  had threatened the Prince with a general Resignation had thus intimidated him to their own Purposes had by these Means usurped the  legal Prerogatives  of the  Crown  and apply'd them rather to the Support of their own  Influence  than to the  public Welfare  If the  legal Privileges  of the  People  had fared no better in their HandsIf These too had been swallowed up in the great Gulph of aristocratic PowerIf the Members of the lower House while they seemed to be the free Representatives of the People had been in Truth a great Part of them no more than the  commissioned Deputies  of their  respective Chiefs  whose Sentiments they declared and whose Interests they pursued  If such a Set of Men as soon as they had lost their Influence should now rail at the Privileges of the Crown as the Engines of Despotism though they had been formerly allowed by the Wisdom of the State as the occasional Securities of Freedom  If they should now absurdly magnify and exalt the Privileges of the lower House beyond the Limits prescribed by a free ConstitutionIf their Pretence should be the Vindication of the People's Rights while their real Motive was  "the  Restoration  of their own  exorbitant Power  founded on an  expected Majority  of their own  Dependents"  If this Conduct was pursued by any Set of Men they would stand convicted of a  clear Mark  of  Licentiousness  and  Faction  Such  would be their main  End  or  Purpose  And this  End  would be pursued by  suitable Means  These Means considered in  Union  would still farther confirm and illustrate the End they aimed at And these Means would be such as follow  SECT XVII A second Mark of Licentiousness and Faction  "THE Patrons of Faction would be attached to Men to the Neglect of Measures"  If the same Men when formerly in Power should have obstinately adhered to each other in every public Debate and Opinion should have execrated every Man as the Enemy of his Country who dissented even in the slightest Article of political Belief  If on any sudden Change in the Fountain of Power a more generous System of Government should have taken PlaceIf the  Sovereign  had aimed to unite all  honest Men  of  all Parties  and had invited them to cooperate for the Welfare of their Country  If these Men determined still to engross all public Power should threaten the Sovereign as they had effectually  threatened his royal Predecessor with a general Resignation  If their Leaders should be taken at their Word and unexpectedly stripped of all Power and Influence  If on This the Clamours of their attendant Populace should arise  See Sect xix  and for the Sake of the public Tranquillity Overtures should be made by the Prince to the DiscontentedIf the  same Principle  should still predominate and  Demands  in Favour of  Men  should be the  leading Object  of  Accommodation  If these Demands should be not only irrational in their Kind but exorbitant and oppressive in their Degree requiring a  general Restoration  of All the Discontented and a  general Dismission  of all who were in Power tho' of known Fidelity to their King and Country  If such should be the Conduct of any Set of Men they would stand evidently convicted of Licentiousness and Faction  SECT XVIII A third Mark of Licentiousness and Faction  "THE Patrons of Faction would be  selfcontradictory  and  inconsistent  not only on  different  but on  parallel  Occasions"  Thus if the  Exercise  of a  Privilege  should be quietly  allowed  to  one  Officer of State and by the  same Persons  should be  clamoured against  in his  Successor  The Persons thus  acquiescing  and  clamouring  by  Turns  would stand convicted of a  selfcontradictory  and  inconsistent  Conduct And without deciding on the Propriety or Impropriety of the Privilege in Question would carry upon them a clear Mark of Licentiousness and Faction  Again if a certain Mode of political  Influence  on  Dependents  was generally exercised among all the Ranks of a free CountryIf the same Persons already  characterized should  now condemn  This as a  despotic  Measure in the  Servants  of the  Crown  which They themselves  formerly  exercised when in  Power  and still  continue  to exercise towards their  private Dependents  These Gentlemen would betray a very notable Inconsistence in their Conduct And therefore without any Decision on the  Rectitude  of such a general  Practice  would stand convicted of an undeniable Mark of Licentiousness and Faction  SECT XIX A fourth Mark of Licentiousness and Faction  "THE Patrons of Faction would endeavour to delude and inflame an ignorant and licentious Populace against their legal Governors"  A blind and unprincipled Populace have ever been the most effectual Engines of Sedition And above all Those of the  Capital  being near to the grand Scene of political Contention must ever be a ready and dangerous Engine in the Hands of Licentiousness and Faction  But in a Nation like this to make the  Populace  of the  Capital  a more successful Instrument of Sedition a Degree of Art would be necessary For it appears above that the  People  of this  Kingdom  and the  Populace  of its  Cities  are of a Character essentially  opposite  to each other That the  one  is collectively  knowing  and  upright  the  other  collectively  ignorant  and  immoral  See above Sect xiii  The first Step therefore that  Faction  would take as the surest Method for Success would be to  confound  the  one  with the  other  and dignify  "the  Clamour  of the  Populace"  by stiling it  "the  VOICE  of the  PEOPLE"  The Fury of such a Populace thus awakened by Vanity Vice and Ignorance would arise in a Variety of Shapes  If an Order of the Senate should be given for the Burning of a  Paper  legally declared seditious such a  Populace  would be incited to rescue it from the Fire And they who had thus incited them would boast that it was rescued by the Hands of  "the  PEOPLE"  Every talking Demagogue who should oppose the Measures of Government would be artfully and indiscriminately obtruded on such an ignorant  Populace  as a  Patriot  or a  Heroe  And They who had thus obtruded him would boast that he was the  Favourite  of  "the  PEOPLE"  Every distinguished Friend to the Measures of Government would be artfully obtruded on such a Populace as the Enemy of his Country And They who had thus obtruded him would boast that he was the  Detestation  of  "the  PEOPLE"  Every Act of the Legislature which contradicted the Passions or partial Interests of such a  Populace  or their  Leaders  would be branded by them as arbitrary  and oppressive And they would boast that it was branded by the  Voice  of  "the  PEOPLE"  If daily or periodical Papers of Intelligence were circulated from the Capital through the Nation and These were open to the Admission of every Thing which private Pique Passion or Interest might suggest they would of Course become the general Repositories of popular Slander And as  Malice  is always more eager to  accuse  than injured  Innocence  to  defend  these Slanders would often seem to  preponderate  in the public Ear And hence would be boasted by Those who raised them as the prevailing  Voice  of  "the  PEOPLE"  Thus  hatched  by  Licentiousness  FACTION would attain to its  enormous Growth  The  unprincipled  among the  Great  would form the  Head  the  unprincipled  among the  Populace  would form the  Body  of this  rapacious Monster  SECT XX A fifth Mark of Licentiousness and Faction  "THE Abettors of Faction would throw injurious and undistinguishing Imputations on every Body of Men who differed from them in Opinion"  Having thus gained an ignorant and licentious Populace as the Trumpets of Sedition the Patrons of Faction would leave no Means untry'd to load their Adversaries with the most envenomed Calumny  Thus if any mistaken Principle had formerly been maintained but was now generally forsaken and derided a Faction could not be detected by any clearer Mark than by its Attempt to conjure up the Ghost of this  departed  Principle in order to alarm and terrify not only the  Populace  but the PEOPLE  If on This Pretence any Men should attempt to revive Animosities which Time had bury'dshould attempt to divide and distract the Subjects of an  united  Kingdom whose  common Welfare  depended on their  Union  should revile all Men without Distinction who were born in a  certain District  and indiscriminately endeavour to exclude them from a Participation of those public Trusts Honours and Emoluments to which with the rest of their FellowSubjects they might stand intitled by their  Capacity  or  Virtue  Who would not discover in this  unequal Conduct  a clear and distinctive Mark of Licentiousness and Faction  Again If ever there had been a Time when All who presumed to  dissent  in any Degree from those in Power were indiscriminately and unjustly branded with the Name of  Jacobite  or  Tory  and if These very Men who had bestowed such Appellations should  now  deal them as freely round on All who  assent  to Those  in PowerThis were surely a clear Indication that the Spirit of Faction were abroad  But if in the Course of political Revolutions some of these Men's  former Adherents  should  now  be their  Adversaries  and some  former Adversaries  should  now  be their  Adherents  another  characteristic  Circumstance would arise For Those whom they had once  reviled  they would now  applaud  as being the  Friends  of  Liberty  and Those whom they had formerly  applauded  they would now  revile  as having become  Jacobites  or  Tories  Such a Conduct and such  Names  thus  arbitrarily imposed  however speciously coloured over by the  Pretence  and  Cry  of  Liberty  might seem to stand with all impartial Judges as a clear  Mark  of  Licentiousness  and  Faction  The Views of such Men would be still more apparent should they insinuate that the  Prince  received Those very Men as his Ministers and Favourites whose Principles  tended to the  Subversion  of his  Throne  and  Family  This Insinuation indeed would not so much merit  Detestation  as  Contempt  and  Ridicule  SECT XXI A sixth Mark of Licentiousness and Faction  "THE Abettors and Instruments of Faction would promiscuously calumniate the private Characters of the principal individuals of the opposing Party"  It was the just Observation of an ancient Writer that  "the Wicked is an Abomination to the Righteous and the Righteous an Abomination to the Wicked"  Yet the Measures which these two Parties take in their Treatment of each other are essentially differentThe  good  Man never maliciously  stabs  the  Reputation  of his Neighbour The  wicked  Man  on the contrary delights in this  most practicable  but  most atrocious  of all  Mischiefs  Invenomed Hints ambiguous Imputations private Crimes darkly alledged but void of all FoundationThese are the deadly Weapons of the abandoned but cunning Defamer  Here then is a secure and ample Field for every profligate Minister of Faction Here  "he tosseth about Arrows Firebrands and Death and cries am I not in Sport"  If a Prince whose Words and Actions might justly be given as an Example of Integrity to all his Subjects should be ambiguously accused of such Things as his Honour would abhor  If such a Prince should be indirectly charged with Ignorance for not distinguishing in a Point of Law which even some of the ablest Lawyers in his Kingdom had not attended to  If neither the Virtues nor the Condescension of a Queen could protect her  from the Insults of Those whom she had never injured  If any other Branch of a royal Family should be basely traduced by the grossest and most audacious Calumnies studiously contrived to inflame an ignorant and unbridled Populace  If the Servants of the Crown and Members of the Legislature who had legally exerted themselves in Defence of their injured Sovereign should in their private Character be impudently vilify'd misrepresented and abused and even their unoffending Families traduced with study'd and unexampled Virulence  If neither Age nor Virtue should be a Security against the Arrows of public CalumnyIf a MAN of the most distinguished Worth in private Life a known and zealous Friend of public Liberty one of the Ornaments of his Age and Country should be overwhelmed by a Load of the most unprovoked and malicious Slander merely because he had dared to assert  his own Right of private Judgment in Opposition to the Opinion of another  If these Outrages should be publicly  committed  by  some  and  winked  at or  countenanced  or  patronized  by  others  surely all honest Men ought to joyn in declaring their Abhorrence of such atrocious Acts of Licentiousness and Faction perpetrated in Defiance of All  Laws  both  human  and  divine  SECT XXII Some Objectious obviated  SHOULD it be objected to the Writer that while he blames the Practice in others▪ He indiscriminately characterizeth whole Bodies of Men who dissent from public Measures he would reply that the Accusation is groundless For he hath expressly distinguished Those who  dissent  on  Principles  of  Liberty  from such as  dissent  on  Motives  of  Licentiousness  and  Faction  Should it be objected that he hath attacked even  private  Characters in the Way of indirect Description This Accusation would be equally illfounded For all personal Peculiarities are avoided save only the single Facts alluded to as the Proofs of his Allegations These were essentially necessary for the Support of the Argument and relate not to  private  Life but to  public  and  political  Conduct  Should it be objected that he hath indirectly censured Those whose Conduct he had formerly applauded He replies that he never was attached to  Men  but  Measures  Should it be objected that some of these characteristic Marks may seem to involve Men of good Morals in private Life He would reply that the Affections of  good  Men in  private  Life may not  always  extend to the  Public  Should it be objected that some of these characteristic Marks may seem to involve Men who have been eminently serviceable to their Country in public Stations He would reply that He ever hath been and ever will be proud to do Justice to Merit when exercised in any public Station  Should it be objected that he questions the Conduct of Those only who are now out of Power He would reply that he formerly questioned their Conduct with the same Freedom when in the Fulness of their Power And that his Reasons in both Instances were the same because in both Instances he judged their general Conduct to be  essentially  illfounded narrow selfish reprehensible  SECT XXIII Of the most effectual Means of checking the Growth of Licentiousness and Faction  THUS the Writer hath endeavoured to lay open the Foundations and Characters of Licentiousness and Faction He now proceeds to consider the most effectual Means of checking them in their Progress of restoring internal Uhanimity and securing public Freedom  In every national Malady of this Nature there are two Kinds of Remedies essentially distinct The one is palliative and temporary the other is radical and lasting  The palliative Remedies ought to be first apply'd because it will appear that they are the only Means by which we can come at Those which are radical  'Tis evident then that the first Advance towards a Cure of this national  Evil must arise from the steady Conduct of the Prince For Faction unopposed and led on by the higher Ranks will never cease in its Demands till it terminates in the Possession of an unbounded aristocratic Power This is a Power which nothing but the Courage and Steadiness of the Prince can possibly contend with Because the final Object of such a Faction will always be  "Those high and lucrative Offices of State which are in  His  sole  Disposal"  If a Sovereign once gives Way to the Storms in which such a Faction will involve him his Peace and Freedom together with Those of his People are inevitably destroyed On the contrary if amidst all the Tumults of Sedition he discovers an unalterable Firmness and Fortitude founded in upright Intentions and real Virtue the Rage of hopeless Faction will by Degrees subside and a Prospect of better Times will open upon  Him  and his  People  This general Truth  might  be  commented  on But at present the Writer can with Satisfaction leave it to the impartial  Public  to find a  more instructive  and LIVING COMMENT  SECT XXIV Of a second Remedy  THE next Remedy which can effectually aid the Firmness of the Prince must be the Steadiness of the Minister in discouraging as far as in him lies the Inroads of  Venality  and  Corruption  This is a large Topic and fitter for a Book than a Section However what is most essential to the present Subject may be briefly touched on  A plausible Objection then is here to be obviated For a late Writer hath very calmly and systematically attempted to prove the universal and unconditional Necessity of political Corruption in all free Governments  See a free Inquiry into the Nature and Origin of Evil Let v  What follows is the Foundation of his Argument  "All human Government is the Offspring of Violence and Corruption and must inherit the Imperfection of both its Parents  Origin of Evil p  "  "All Governments must be administered by the same Violence and Corruption to which they are indebted for their Origin  Ib p  "  "Corruption  therefore  must always increase in due Proportion to the Decrease of arbitrary Power since where there is less Power to command Obedience there must be more Bribery to purchase it or there can be no Government carry'd on at all  Ib p  "  Such is the Sum of this Gentleman's Argument To which the following Observations are offered as a Reply  There have been two different Pictures given of  Man  by different Writers diametrically opposite to each other By some the human Species hath been represented  as a natural Society of Angels by others as a Crew of Devils Both these Representations have arisen from a partial View of Mandkind▪ One Party regarding his  social  Qualities only the other overlooking These and fixing on the Appetites which are commonly called the  felfish  Were Mankind of the first of these Characters they would need no Law Were they of the latter no Law could unite or bind them The Truth is they are a Mixture of Both As they have the several Modes of SelfLove for the Preservation of the Individual so by  proper Culture  they gain Habits of Benevolence Religion social Prudence the Love of honest Reputation and sometimes even a Regard for the general Welfare of the Society to which they belong As these social Passions and Regards are strong or weak frequent or uncommon the Character of a Nation is good or bad honest or corrupt upright or profligate  A Variety of Proofs hath been given of these different Degrees of moral Character in the preceding Parts of this Essay  See above Sect vii c  But that we may not seem to build on a Principle which this Author admits not we hear him virtually declaring all This himself in another Part of his Book  "Here  He Man  has an Opportunity given him of  improving  or  debasing  his Nature in such a Manner as to render himself  fit  for a Rank of  higher Perfection  and Happiness or to  degrade  himself to a State of  greater Imperfection  and Misery  Origin of Evil p  "  Again he speaks of a  Reformation  of  Manners  as a Thing  practicable  And recommends it as the only Remedy for political Evil  Ib  But while he treats of the absolute  Necessity  of political Corruption all the  better Part  of  Man  is  hid  his  Imperfections  and  Vices  alone are  set  in  View  During the Progress of this Argument if it deserves that  Name we hear of nothing but  "such imperfect and  vicious  Creatures as  Men tyrannizing  over  others  as imperfect and  vicious  as themselves  Origin of Evil p  "  We have nothing presented to us but  "Pride Avarice and Cruelty on one Side Envy Ignorance and Obstinacy on the other Injustice and SelfInterest on both  Ib  "  In a Word Mankind are represented as an  abandoned  and  incurable  Race utterly  void  of all  good  Qualities and such as  "must be always bribed or beat into Obedience  Ib p  "  Here then this Maxim of the absolute and unconditional Necessity of Political Corruption appears in all its Nakedness and Deformity For it is founded on  "the supposed incurable Wickedness of Man"  An Error too glaring to need a Confutation and which there is still the less Occasion to confute because this Author himself admits the contrary  It follows then that his leading Proposition is as false in itself as it is pernicious to Society that  "Corruption must always increase in due Proportion to the Decrease of arbitrary Power"  Because Virtue and Religion upright Manners and Principles properly instilled may much better supply Corruption's Place  Were it necessary to pursue this Gentleman through all the Windings of his political Labyrinth and trace him to the End of his Course where he suddenly starts up in the Form of a severe Moralist there could not perhaps be exhibited a more striking Instance of SelfContradiction in the whole Compass of literary DebateAt present I shall only remark that this Essay was published in the Year at a Time when the System of political Corruption much needed some Kind of Apology because its fatal Effects began to gla  e too strongly upon the Nation to be longer doubted Hence though we should not inquire  "who  the Author is"  we may give a  shrewd Guess  "what  political School  he was  bred  in"  On this Foundation therefore it appears that every upright Minister ought as far as possible to check the Progress of Corruption And tho' at Times he may be embarassed and under a  political  Necessity  of yielding 'tis clearly both his Duty and his Interest to oppose this dangerous and encroaching Spirit in the leading Outlines of his public Conduct  It is his Duty both because Corruption can only flourish on the Ruins of Virtue and Religion good Morals and Principles without which public Liberty is essentially destroy'd and because Corruption tends inevitably and invariably to weaken the public Administration of Government by filling every high Department with the Venal the Ignorant the Selfish the Dishonest  See Estimate Part ii  It is both his Duty and Interest because  Licentiousness  and its Attendants  Venality  and  Faction  are of an  insatiable  Appetite The more the Venal are fed they grow more importunate If you gorge one of These to the full and thus lay him to sleep ten will rise in his Place every one more clamourous than the first  The Minister therefore both in Consideration of his own Peace and the public Welfare ought as far as possible to obviate this Evil in its  Beginnings  fortify  Himself  as well as the  State  with the  Honest  the  Firm  and the  Capable  resist to the utmost the exorbitant Demands of  Venality  Thus  Faction  will either  bark  itself  asleep  or  die despairing  SECT XXV Of some concomitant Remedies  LET us now consider what might be in the Power of the  Legislature  and the  Magistrate  immediately to effect  'Tis generally acknowledged that Power naturally follows Property Therefore exorbitant Property in Individuals must always be unfavourable to civil Liberty must always tend to produce Licentiousness and Faction because it throws  exorbitant Power into the Hands of Individuals And the greater the  Inequality  between the  Poor  and  Rich  the more the  one  will ever be under the  Influence  of the  other  It should seem then to be the  particular  Interest even of the most  Wealthy  if they be the real Friends of Liberty'tis certainly the  general  Interest of a  free Community  that some legal Limitation of Property should take Place I speak not of the Probability but the Expediency of such a Measure  It follows that some  Regulation  in Respect to  Boroughs  would be of great Importance For in Boroughs contrary to all sound Policy  "Power is lodged without annexed Property"  The natural Consequence is that  "this illplaced Power will be seized by Those who are possessed of exorbitant Property"  Thus Power settles on its natural Foundation But a Foundation in this Instance most dangerous to Freedom as it leads to the  Establishment of an Aristocracy In This Instance too I speak not of the Probability but the Expediency of the Measure  The Limitation of extended Conquest and Empire might seem an Object worthy the Attention of the highest PowersROME perished by its Avidity of unbounded Empire Colonies when peopled beyond a certain Degree become a Burthen to the Mother Country They exhaust her Numbers they distract her Attention they divide her compacted Strength Such Extent of Colonies as may be necessary to maintain the Empire of the Seas will always be a just Object of  British  Regard More than this sound Policy perhaps could hardly dictate  This Limitation is of more Importance as it would naturally set Bounds to another Excess I mean That of Trade and Wealth This the Writer knows is of all other Topics the most unpopular Notwithstanding which he presumes to persist in what appears to Him a demonstrative  Truth that  "exorbitant Trade and Wealth are most dangerous to private Virtue and therefore to public Freedom"  The Topic is too large to be here insisted on He therefore refers to what he hath already written on this Subject  See Estimate Part iii passim  which hath been much clamoured against indeed but never confuted  For the Conviction of Those who chuse rather to attend to  present  than  future  Consequences the following Circumstance may deserve Notice Much hath been said  "on the Cause of the present exorbitant Price of Provisions and general Distress of the Poor"  Every Cause hath been assigned except the true one which seems to be  "the sinking Value of Money arising necessarily from the exorbitant Increase of Trade and Wealth"  If this be so it follows that the Evil is incurable excepting only by a general Augmentation of the Wages of the PoorNow This which is the necessary Effect of the Exorbitancy of Commerce naturally tends by the increased Price of Manufactures to the Destruction of Commerce If the Exorbitancy of Trade should still run higher this Evil will be aggravated in Proportion The Consequences which must follow are such as the Writer chuseth not to enlarge on because he knows the Spirit of the Times would not bear it  The immediate Care of upright Manners and Principles might seem an Object worthy the strictest Attention both of the Legislature and Magistrate  To this End if the growing Spirit of  Novelty  and  Adoption  could by any Means be checked it would be a Work attended with the most salutary Consequences The Writer would not willingly be thought chimerically to adopt all the Rigours of the  Spartan  State But could wish to see a Law enacted parallel to That of LACEDAEMON by which their raw and unexperienced Youth were prohibited from bringing Home the new Follies and Vices of foreign Countries picked up in a premature and too early Travel  See Estimate Vol ii Part i Sect  He would by no Means discourage the  Freedom  of the  Press  Yet sure its  Licentiousness  might seem an Object of the Magistrate's Regard The Search of Truth is good But to search for This in the  Hoards of  Irreligion  is like searching for  Hope  in PANDORA'S  Box  where the sole Reward of Industry can only be  Pestilence Despair  and  Death  National Virtue never was maintained but by national Religion He therefore who shakes the essential Principles of Religion undermines the Virtue of his FellowSubjects and therefore deserves to feel the Rigour of the Law as a determined  Enemy  of his  Country  This may seem a practicable Remedy But how to destroy those irreligious Writings which already lie exposed on Stalls and Counters or deposited in private Libraries like so many Heaps of Poison for the Gratification of Vice and the Destruction of VirtueOr how to pluck from the Minds of Men those poisoned Arrows which these Authors have already planted thereThat were a  Task indeed  The Shaft is already flown and cannot be recalled And this Nation thro' succeeding Times will have Cause to say  "Haeret Lateri lethalis Arundo"  Immoral Writings  should seem no less the Object of the Magistrate's Attention Tho' These may not shake the  Principles  yet they inevitably corrupt the  Manners  of a Nation  Personal Defamation  or Calumny thrown on  private  Characters is another Evil which seems rising at present with unheardof Aggravations Two  slagrant  Instances of This Enormity the Writer will pass unnoticed lest he should seem to insult over the  Exiled  or the  Dead  In these two Kinds of modern Profligacy  immoral Writings  and  personal Calumny  there is one professed Author now said to be living in this Kingdom with Impunity who in a better policed State would ere this have felt the full Weight of that public Punishment and Infamy which is due to an Enemy of Mankind This Man supposed to be one  C  first writ a Volume of execrable  Memoirs  for the Corruption of Youth and Innocence Since That a  Reverie  or  Dream  which  Hunger  and  Malice  probably conspired to suggest replete with the most impudent Falsehoods and injurious Calumnies on Individuals for the Entertainment of  base  and  envious  Minds  SECT XXVI Of the chief and essential Remedy  ALL these may be regarded as temporary and concomitant Supports of Freedom But the chief and essential Remedy to Licentiousness and Faction the fundamental Means of the lasting and secure Establishment of civil Liberty can only  "lie in a general and prescribed Improvement of the Laws of Education"  We have seen above that upright Manners and Principles are the only Basis of true Liberty that the infant Mind if left to its own untutored Dictates inevitably wanders into such Follies and Vices as tend to the Destruction of itself and others We have seen that the early and continued Culture of the Heart can alone produce such upright Manners and Principles as are necessary to check and subdue the selfish Passions of the Soul and that Liberty  can only arise from a general Subordination of These to the public Welfare We have seen these Truths confirmed by an Appeal to the State of three famed Republics which by Turns  arose  and  fell  on the very Principles here delivered We have seen the Defects as well as Excellencies of our own public Constitution both  civil  and  religious  That its Form is excellent and unrivaled but that the practical  Application  of this unrivaled Excellence is attended with Defects incurable That it hath all along been inevitably counterworked by Manners and Principles discordant with its Genius and discordant with each other That for Want of a prescribed Code of Education to which all the Members of the Community should legally submit the Manners and Principles on which alone the State can rest are ineffectually instilled are vague fluctuating and selfcontradictory  Nothing then is more evident than that some Reform in this great Point is  necessary for the Security of public Freedom Till this be effected in Spite of all temporary Remedies Licentiousness and Faction tho' checked for a Time will ever be gathering new Strength and returning to the Charge with redoubled Fury  This Reform to some may appear easy to effect By others it will be derided as wholly impracticable Perhaps the Truth may lie between these two Opinions To throw the Manners and Principles of a Nation into any new Channel is certainly a Work of no small DifficultyOn the other Hand we seem to have many Materials lying round us ready to be converted into the Means of this great Work A pure and rational Religion a generous System of Policy founded on that Religion Manners tho' apparently degenerating yet by no Means generally profligate much true Religion Integrity and Honour among the  middle  Ranks many Instances of  domestic Worth  among the  higher  and in Spite of the  Temptations that surround the  Great  true  Piety  and the  moral Virtues  adorning the  most exalted Station  Therefore without dreaming of the perfect Republic of PLATOand fairly acknowledging the incurable Defect of our political State in not having a correspondent and adequate Code of Education inwrought into its first Essencewe may yet hope that in a secondary and inferior Degree something of this Kind may be still  inlaid  It cannot have that perfect Efficacy as if it had been originally  of the Piece  Yet if well conducted it may strengthen the weak Parts and  alleviate  Defects though not compleatly  remove  them  Among  what Ranks  in the Writer's Opinion these  Defects  in  Education  chiefly  lie  may be sufficiently collected from some of the preceding Sections But as to the most  effectual Methods  of  relieving  these  Defects  he pretends not at present to attempt so great a Subject  This however he is well perswaded of that till something of the Kind be attempted and performed all the laboured Harangues that can be given from the  Bench  the  Pulpit  or the  Press  will be of little Avail They may tend  occasionally  to  obviate  some of the  Evils  of  Licentiousness  but never can  radically cure them  SECT XXVII The Conclusion  THESE Remedies however  just  in their  Nature  can only be  effectual  through a proper Application And this can only lie  "in a zealous and unfeigned Union of the  Honest  among all  Ranks  and  Parties  for the  Accomplishment  of  these Ends  against the Patrons and Instruments of Licentiousness and Faction"  This Union at first View seems of such a Nature as could hardly need to be inforced Yet it is frequently retarded by several Circumstances  Among the  Great  this rational Union is often counteracted by the Ties of false Honour a dangerous Principle which we have already noted as being productive of PartyRage and Faction  See above p  This Principle even in honest Minds will sometimes prevail over the Dictates of Religion and private Virtue On this false Foundation political Connexions are often maintained in Defiance of a just Sense of public Utility While the unhappy Man who acts on this mistaken Motive is inwardly rent by two contrary and contending Powers Severe Moralists may perhaps discard such a Character from the List of the  Honest  But it should seem that he is rather an Object of Clemency than Indignation Remove but the unhappy Prejudice from his Breast  And such a Character would press forward among the first towards the  Goal  of  public Virtue  Again This rational and salutary Union may be retarded by Connexions of  Friendship Gratitude  or  Blood  This Cause tends to confirm and extend the Influence of the former  Fathers powerful Friends  and  Patrons  connect themselves with Parties and cleave to them on a mistaken Principle  Sons obliged Friends  and  Dependents  are naturally inlisted in their Party and are rivetted in it not only by  false Honour  but  Education Gratitude Affection  How peculiarly unfortunate is this Circumstance that the  generous Passions  should ever become the  Adversaries  of  public Virtue  The same false Attachment to Friends Patrons and Relations naturally prevails in a certain Proportion among the middle Ranks of the Kingdom Their Interests Passions and Prejudices are not so immediately concerned as Those of the higher Ranks and therefore 'tis natural  to suppose that their mutual Attachments of mistaken Honour or private Affection will upon the Whole be more moderate and less culpable Yet still while these false Attachments are prevalent among the  Great  the  People  must in some Degree catch the Infection from the various Relations which they bear to their Superiors Hence untractable Prejudices arise and are maintained While  Measures  are less regarded than the  Party  which  adopts  them  But besides This another Circumstance ariseth which inevitably tends to  disunite  and  distract  the  Honest  among the  People  even when their personal Attachments are conquered by their Integrity Their  Dispersion  in the Country hath already been remarked as a Circumstance worthy of Attention Here it meets us again as a Cause of their frequent  Disunion  We have seen how naturally under the present State of Things every factious Clamour that riseth in the Capital is transmitted with aggravated Circumstances through the  whole Kingdom  See above Sect xix p  And the People of the Villages being easy of Belief because not suspecting the abandoned Profligacy of these  TownDefamers  are apt to receive every insinuated  personal Slander  as a  Truth  These Calumnies being seldom contradicted by the injured Party take Root in the Minds of the less knowing Hence Doubts arise Surmises and Dislikes are spread Facts though void of all Foundation are alledged and persisted in the more credulous Part are misled Thus an honest People are divided and not only a  Province  or a  Village  but even an  House  often set at Variance within itself  These Contentions  sometimes  arise to a Degree which is ridiculous And have formerly been so described  without Exception  by the Tools of Faction Notwithstanding This every Friend of Liberty ought to grieve if a  free  an  honest  and a  sensible  PEOPLE should ever desist were it possible  to debate on Affairs of Government Tho' they may be occasionally alarmed and misled on slight Occasions yet their mature and collective Judgment on important Subjects will  seldom  be  erroneous  On this Foundation MONTESQUIEU'S Remark is solid  "Tell me not that such a People will sometimes  reason ill"  'Tis sufficient  "that  they reason  L'Esprit des Loix  "  The Guilt and ill Consequences then arise from the malevolent Clamours of the Capital transmitted thence to the Provinces These Clamours though not of Power to seduce an  honest  PEOPLE into actual Sedition are yet often sufficient to  alarm  and  divide  them  See above Sect xiii p  Much Caution therefore ought to be used by the Inhabitants of the  Country  how they give Credit to the  political  Rumours of the  Town  which are seldom spread without Design and are in general spread most industriously by the Malevolent They who act on good Principles  are apt to trust to the native Force of Truth The Patrons of Falsehood are conscious of a Defect  here  and therefore endeavour to supply it by a misapply'd Diligence and Cunning  One Mark of Licentiousness and Faction is peculiarly applicable to these Clamours from the Metropolis If they are fraught with  personal Calumny  and attack private Characters they assuredly come from the  Enemies  of  Virtue  and  Freedom  All These therefore a  sensible  and  honest  PEOPLE will learn to  suspect  and  deride  This Foundation once laid they will not be far from a  general Union  against the  hidden Designs  of  Licentiousness  and  Faction  In Conclusion therefore let the  Honest  among every  Rank  and  Party  recollect that their first and highest Obligations are to God their King and Country That every  subordinate  Connexion ought to  yield  to  These  That true  Honour  can never be at  Variance  with the Laws of  Religion  and  Virtue  That if any  Desertion  be  shameful  it is the  Desertion  from  Truth  and the Welfare of their  Country  If any  Attachment  be  honourable  it is an impartial  Attachment  to the  public Weal  unbiassed by private Affections and Regards If any  Acknowledgment  be the certain Mark of a  great  and  ingenuous  Mind it is the  Acknowledgment  of  its own Errors  or those of a  Patron Friend  or  Ancestor  These Remarks the Writer submits to the Impartiality and Candor of his Countrymen desiring that they may be regarded as his Mite thrown in towards the Accomplishment of the Sovereign's Wish on his Accession to the Throne that of  "founding the Liberty and Happiness of this Kingdom on the solid Basis of  Religion  and  Virtue  and uniting ALL HONEST MEN in the steady Prosecution of this great Purpose  THE END  By the same AUTHOR With all
