 THE PROPHECY of FAMINE A SCOTS PASTORAL BY C CHURCHILL INSCRIBED TO JOHN WILKES  Esq  Carmina tum melius cum venerit IPSE canemus  Dr KING OXON  LONDON Printed for the AUTHOR And Sold by G KEARSLY in Ludgatestreet MDCCLXIII  THE PROPHECY of FAMINE A SCOTS PASTORAL  WHEN CUPID first instructs his darts to fly  From the sly corner of some cookmaid's eye  The stripling raw just enter'd in his teens  Receives the wound and wonders what it means  His heart like dripping melts and new desire  Within him stirs each time she stirs the fire  Trembling and blushing he the fair one views  And fain would speak but can'twithout a MUSE  So  to the sacred mount he takes his way  Prunes his young wings and tunes his infant lay  His oaten reed to rural ditties frames  To flocks and rocks to hills and rills proclaims  In simplest notes and all unpolish'd strains  The loves of nymphs and  eke  the loves of swains  Clad as your nymphs were always clad of yore  In rustic weedsa cookmaid now no more  Beneath an aged oak LARDELLA lies  Green moss her couch her canopy the skies  From aromatic shrubs the  roguish  gale  Steals  young  perfumes and wafts them thro' the vale  The youth turn'd swain and skill'd in rustic lays  Fast by her side his am'rous descant plays  Herds lowe Flocks bleat Pies chatter Ravens scream  And the full chorus dies adown the stream  The streams with music freighted as they pass  Present the fair LARDELLA with a glass  And ZEPHYR to compleat the lovesick plan  Waves his light wings and serves her for a fan  But when maturer Judgment takes the lead  These childish toys on Reason's altar bleed  Form'd after some  great man  whose name breeds awe  Whose ev'ry sentence Fashion makes a law  Who on mere credit his vain trophies rears  And founds his merit on our servile fears  Then we discard the workings of the heart  And nature's banish'd by  mechanic  art  Then deeply read our reading must be shewn  Vain is that knowledge which remains unknown  Then OSTENTATION marches to our aid  And  letter'd  PRIDE stalks forth in full parade  Beneath their care behold the work refine  Pointed each sentence polish'd ev'ry line  Trifles are dignified and taught to wear  The robes of Antients with a Modern air  NONSENSE with  Classic  ornaments is grac'd  And passes current with the stamp of TASTE  Then the  rude  THEOCRITE is ransack'd o'er  And  courtly  MARO call'd from MINCIO's shore  Sicilian muses  on our mountains roam  Easy and free as if they were at home  NYMPHS NAIADS NEREIDS DRYADS SATYRS FAUNS  Sport in our floods and trip it o'er our lawns  Flow'rs which once flourish'd fair in GREECE and ROME  More fair revive in ENGLAND's meads to bloom  Skies without cloud exotic suns adorn  And roses blush but blush without a thorn  Landscapes unknown to  dowdy  Nature rise  And new creations strike our wond'ring eyes  For bards like these who neither sing nor say  Grave without thought and without feeling gay  Whose numbers in one even tenor flow  Attun'd  to pleasure and  attun'd  to woe  Who if  plain  COMMONSENSE her visit pays  And mars one couplet in their happy lays  As at some Ghost affrighted start and stare  And ask the meaning of her coming there  For bards like these a wreath shall MASON bring  Lin'd with the softest down from FOLLY's wing  In LOVE's PAGODA shall they ever doze  And GISBEL kindly rock them to repose  My lord  to letters as to  faith  most true  At once their patron and example too  Shall  quaintly  fashion his lovelabour'd dreams  Sigh with sad winds and weep with weeping streams  Curious  in grief for  real  grief we know  Is curious to dress up the tale of woe  From the green umbrage of some DRUID's seat  Shall his own works in his own way repeat  Me  whom no muse of heav'nly birth inspires  No judgment tempers when rash genius fires  Who boast no merit but mere knack of rhime  Short gleams of sense and satire out of time  Who cannot follow where  trim  fancy leads  By  prattling  streams o'er  flow'rempurpled  meads  Who often but without success have pray'd  For  apt  ALLITERATION's  artful aid    Who would but cannot with a master's skill  Coin fine new epithets  which mean no ill    Me  thus uncouth thus ev'ry way unfit  For  pacing  poesy and  ambling  wit  TASTE with contempt beholds nor deigns to place  Amongst the lowest of her favour'd race  Thou NATURE art  my  goddessto thy law  Myself I dedicate  hence  slavish awe  Which bends to fashion and obeys the rules  Impos'd at first and since observ'd by fools  Hence  those vile tricks which mar fair NATURE's hue  And bring the sober matron forth to view  With all that artificial tawdry glare  Which virtue scorns and none but strumpets wear  Sick of those pomps those vanities that waste  Of toil which critics now mistake for  taste    Of false refinements sick and labour'd ease  Which Art too thinly veil'd forbids to please  By Nature's charms inglorious truth subdued  However plain her dress and haviour rude  To  northern  climes my happier course I steer  Climes where the Goddess reigns throughout the year  Where undisturb'd by Art's  rebellious  plan  She rules the  loyal Laird  and  faithful clan    To that rare soil where virtues clust'ring grow  What mighty blessings doth not ENGLAND owe  What  waggonloads  of courage wit and sense  Doth each revolving day import from thence  To us she gives disinterested friend  Faith without fraud and STUARTS without end  When we prosperity's rich trappings wear  Come not her gen'rous sons and take a share  And if by some disastrous turn of fate  Change should ensue and ruin sieze our state  Shall we not find safe in that hallow'd ground  Such refuge as the HOLY MARTYR found  Nor less our debt in SCIENCE tho' denied  By the weak slaves of prejudice and pride  Thence  came the RAMSAYS names of worthy note  Of whom one paints as well as t'other wrote  Thence  HOME disbanded from the sons of pray'r  For loving plays tho' no  dull  DEAN was there  Thence issued forth at great MACPHERSON's call  That  old new Epic Pastoral  FINGAL  Thence  simple bards by simple prudence taught  To this  wise  town by simple patrons brought  In simple manner utter simple lays  And take with simple pensions simple praise  Waft me some muse to TWEDE's inspiring stream  Where all the little loves and graces dream  Where slowly winding the dull waters creep  And seem themselves to own the power of sleep  Where on the surface Lead like feathers swims  There let me bathe my yet unhallow'd limbs  As once a SYRIAN bath'd in JORDAN's flood  Wash off my native stains correct that blood  Which mutinies at call of  English  pride  And deaf to prudence rolls a  patriot  tide  From solemn thought which overhangs the brow  Of patriot care when things are God knows how  From nice trim points where HONOUR slave to rule  In compliment to folly plays the fool  From those gay scenes where mirth exalts his pow'r  And easy Humour wings the laughing hour  From those soft better moments when desire  Beats high and all the world of man's on fire  When mutual ardours of the melting fair  More than repay us for whole years of care  At  Friendship's  summons will my WILKES retreat  And see  once seen before  that  antient  seat  That  antient  seat where majesty display'd  Her ensigns  long before the world was made  Mean narrow maxims which enslave mankind  Ne'er from its bias warp thy settled mind  Not dup'd by party nor opinion's slave  Those faculties which bounteous Nature gave  Thy honest spirit into practice brings  Nor courts the smile nor dreads the frown of Kings  Let  rude licentious  Englishmen comply  With tumult's voice and curse they know not why  Unwilling to condemn thy soul disdains  To wear vile faction's arbitrary chains  And strictly weighs in apprehension clear  Things as they are and not as they appear  With thee GOODHUMOUR tempers lively WIT  Enthron'd with JUDGMENT CANDOUR loves to sit  And Nature gave thee open to distress  A heart to pity and a hand to bless  Oft have I heard thee mourn the wretched lot  Of the poor mean despis'd insulted  Scot    Who might calm reason credit idle tales  By rancour forg'd where prejudice prevails  Or starves at home or practises thro' fear  Of starving arts which damn all conscience here  When  Scriblers  to the charge by int'rest led  The fierce  NorthBriton  foaming at their head  Pour forth invectives deaf to candour's call  And injur'd by one alien rail at all  On  Northern Pisgah  when they take their stand  To mark the weakness of that  Holy Land    With needless truths their libels to adorn  And hang a nation up to public scorn  Thy gen'rous soul condemns the frantic rage  And hates the faithful but illnatur'd page  The  Scots  are poor cries surly English pride  True is the charge nor by themselves denied  Are they not then in strictest reason clear  Who wisely come to mend their fortunes here  If by low supple arts successful grown  They sapp'd our vigour to increase their own  If mean in want and insolent in pow'r  They only fawn'd more surely to devour  Rous'd by such wrongs should REASON take alarm  And e'en the MUSE for public safety arm  But if they own ingenuous virtue's sway  And follow where true honour points the way  If they revere the hand by which they're fed  And bless the donors for their daily bread  Or by vast debts of higher import bound  Are always humble always grateful found  If they directed by PAUL's holy pen  Become discreetly all things to all men  That all men may become all things to them  Envy may hate but justice can't condemn  "Into our places states and beds they creep"  They've sense to get what we want sense to keep  Once be the hour accurs'd accurs'd the place  I ventur'd to blaspheme the chosen race  Into those traps which men  call'd  PATRIOTS laid  By specious arts unwarily betray'd  Madly I leagu'd against that sacred earth  Vile parricide which gave a parent birth  But shall I meanly error's path pursue  When heav'nly TRUTH presents her friendly clue  Once plung'd in ill shall I go farther in  To make the oath was rash to keep it sin  Backward I tread the paths I trod before  And calm reflection hates what passion swore  Converted blessed are the souls which know  Those pleasures which from true conversion flow  Whether to reason who now rules my breast  Or to pure faith like LYTTLETON and WEST  Past crimes to expiate be my present aim  To raise new trophies to the SCOTTISH name  To make what can the proudest Muse do more  E'en faction's sons her brighter worth adore  To make her glories stamp'd with honest rhimes  In fullest tide roll down to latest times  Presumptuous wretch and shall a  Muse  like thine  An  English Muse  the meanest of the nine  Attempt a theme like this Can her weak strain  Expect indulgence from the mighty THANE  Should he from toils of government retire  And for a moment fan the poet's fire  Should he of sciences the moral friend  Each  curious  each  important  search suspend  Leave  unassisted  HILL of herbs to tell  And  all the wonders of a Cockleshell    Having the Lord's good grace before his eyes  Would not  the  HOME step forth and gain the prize  Or if this wreath of honour might adorn  The humble brows of one in  England  born  Presumptuous still thy daring must appear  Vain all thy tow'ring hopes whilst I am here  Thus spake a  form  by silken smile and tone  Dull and unvaried for the LAUREAT known  FOLLY's chief friend DECORUM's eldest son  In ev'ry party found and yet of none  This  airy substance  this  substantial shade  Abash'd I heard and with respect obey'd  From themes too lofty for a bard so mean  Discretion  beckons to an humbler scene  The restless fever of ambition laid  Calm I retire and seek the sylvan shade  Now be the  Muse  disrob'd of all her pride  Be all the glare of verse by  Truth  supplied  And if plain nature pours a simple strain  Which BUTE may praise and OSSIAN not disdain  OSSIAN  sublimest simplest  Bard of all  Whom  English Infidels  MACPHERSON  call    Then round my head shall honour's ensigns wave  And pensions mark me for a willing slave  Two boys whose birth beyond all question springs  From great and glorious tho' forgotten kings  Shepherds of  Scottish  lineage born and bred  On the same bleak and barren mountain's head  By niggard nature doom'd on the same rocks  To spin out life and starve themselves and flocks  Fresh as the morning which enrob'd in mist  The mountain top with usual dulness kiss'd  JOCKEY and SAWNEY to their labours rose  Soon clad I ween where nature needs no cloaths  Where from their youth enur'd to winter skies  Dress and her vain refinements they despise  JOCKEY whose manly highbon'd cheeks to crown  With freckles spotted flam'd the golden down  With mickle art could on the bagpipes play  E'en from the rising to the setting day  SAWNEY as long without remorse could bawl  HOME's madrigals and ditties from FINGAL  Oft at his strains all natural tho' rude  The  Highland Lass  forgot her want of food  And whilst she  scratch'd  her lover into rest  Sunk pleas'd tho' hungry on her SAWNEY's breast  Far as the eye could reach no tree was seen  Earth clad in russet scorn'd the lively green  The plague of Locusts they secure defy  For in three hours a grashopper must die  No living thing whate'er its food feasts there  But the Camaelion who can feast on air  No birds except as birds of passage flew  No bee was known to hum no dove to coo▪  No streams as amber smooth as amber clear  Were seen to glide or heard to warble here  Rebellion's spring which thro' the country ran  Furnish'd with bitter draughts the steady clan  No flow'rs embalm'd the air but one white rose  Which on the tenth of June by instinct blows  By instinct blows at morn and when the shades  Of drizly eve prevail by instinct fades  One and but one poor solitary cave  Too sparing of her favours nature gave  That one alone hard tax on Scottish pride  Shelter at once for man and beast supplied  Their snares  without  entangling briers spread  And thistles arm'd against th' invader's head  Stood in close ranks all entrance to oppose  Thistles now held more precious than the rose  All Creatures which on nature's earliest plan  Were form'd to loath and to be loath'd by man  Which ow'd their birth to nastiness and spite  Deadly to touch and hateful to the sight  Creatures which when admitted in the ark  Their Saviour shunn'd and rankled in the dark  Found place  within  marking her noisome road  With poison's trail  here  crawl'd the bloated Toad  There  webs were spread of more than common size  And halfstarv'd spiders prey'd on halfstarv'd flies  In quest of food Efts strove in vain to crawl  Slugs pinch'd with hunger smear'd the slimy wall  The cave around with hissing serpents rung  On the damp roof unhealthy vapour hung  And FAMINE  by her children always known    As proud as poor here  fix'd her  native  throne    Here  for the sullen sky was overcast  And summer shrunk beneath a wintry blast  A native blast which arm'd with hail and rain  Beat unrelenting on the naked swain  The boys for shelter made behind the sheep  Of which those shepherds ev'ry day  take keep    Sickly crept on and with complainings rude  On nature seem'd to call and bleat for food  JOCKEY  Sith  to this cave by tempest we're confin'd  And within  ken  our flocks under the wind  Safe from the pelting of this perilous storm  Are laid  emong  yon thistles dry and warm  What Sawney if by shepherd's arts we try  To mock the rigour of this cruel sky  What if we tune some merry roundelay  Well dost thou sing nor ill doth Jockey play  SAWNEY  Ah Jockey ill advisest thou  I wis    To think of songs at such a time as this  Sooner shall herbage crown these barren rocks  Sooner shall fleeces cloath these ragged flocks  Sooner shall want sieze shepherds of the south  And we forget to live from hand to mouth  Than Sawney out of season shall impart  The songs of gladness with an aching heart  JOCKEY  Still have I known thee for a silly swain  Of things past help what boots it to complain  Nothing but mirth can conquer fortune's spite  No sky is heavy if the heart be light  Patience is sorrow's salve what can't be cur'd  So Donald right  areeds  must be endur'd  SAWNEY  Full silly swain  I wot  is Jockey now  How did'st thou bear thy MAGGY's falshood how  When with a foreign loon she stole away  Did'st thou forswear thy pipe and shepherd's lay  Where was thy boasted wisdom then when I  Applied those proverbs which you now apply  JOCKEY  O she was  bonny  all the Highlands round  Was there a rival to my MAGGY found  More precious tho' that precious is to all  Than the rare medicine which we Brimstone call  Or that choice plant so grateful to the nose  Which in I know not what far country grows  Was MAGGY unto me dear do I rue  A lass so fair should ever prove untrue  SAWNEY  Whether with pipe or song to charm the ear  Thro' all the land did JAMIE find a peer  Curs'd be that year by ev'ry honest Scot  And in the shepherd's calendar forgot  That fatal year when JAMIE hapless swain  In evil hour forsook the peaceful plain  JAMIE when our young Laird discreetly fled  Was seiz'd and hang'd till he was dead dead dead  JOCKEY  Full sorely may we all lament that day  For all were losers in the deadly fray  Five brothers had I on the Scottish plains  Well dost thou know were none more hopeful swains  Five brothers there I lost in manhood's pride  Two in the field and three on gibbets died  Ah  silly swains to follow war's alarms  Ah  what hath shepherd's life to do with arms  SAWNEY  Mention it notthere saw I strangers clad  In all the honours of our ravish'd  Plaid    Saw the FERRARA too our nation's pride  Unwilling grace the aukward victor's side  There fell our choicest youth and from that day  Mote  never Sawney tune the merry lay  Bless'd those which fell curs'd those which still survive  To mourn  fifteen  renew'd in  fortyfive    Thus plain'd the boys when from her throne of turf  With boils emboss'd and overgrown with scurf  Vile humours which in life's corrupted well  Mix'd at the birth not abstinence could quell  Pale FAMINE rear'd the head her eager eyes  Where hunger e'en to madness seem'd to rise  Speaking aloud her throes and pangs of heart  Strain'd to get loose and from their orbs to start  Her hollow cheeks were each a deepsunk cell  Where wretchedness and horror lov'd to dwell  With double rows of useless teeth supplied  Her mouth from ear to ear extended wide  Which when for want of food her entrails pin'd  She op'd and cursing swallow'd nought but wind  All shrivell'd was her skin and here and there  Making their way by force her bones lay bare  Such filthy sight to hide from human view  O'er her foul limbs a tatter'd Plaid she threw  Cease cried the Goddess cease despairing swains  And from a parent hear what Jove ordains  Pent in this barren corner of the isle  Where partial fortune never deign'd to smile  Like nature's bastards reaping for our share  What was rejected by the lawful heir  Unknown amongst the nations of the earth  Or only known to raise contempt and mirth  Long free because the race of Roman braves  Thought it not worth their while to make us slaves  Then into bondage by that nation brought  Whose ruin we for ages vainly sought  Whom still with unslack'd hate we view and still  The pow'r of mischief lost retain the will  Consider'd as the refuse of mankind  A mass till the last moment left behind  Which frugal nature doubted as it lay  Whether to stamp with life or throw away  Which form'd in haste was planted in this nook  But never enter'd in Creation's book  Branded as traitors who for love of gold  Would sell their God as once their King they sold  Long have we born this mighty weight of ill  These vile injurious taunts and bear them still  But times of happier note are now at hand  And the full promise of a better land  There  like the  Sons of Israel  having trod  For the fix'd term of years ordain'd by God  A barren desart we shall sieze rich plains  Where milk with honey flows and plenty reigns  With some few natives join'd some  pliant  few  Who worship int'rest and our track pursue  There shall we tho' the wretched people grieve  Ravage at large nor ask the owner's leave  For us the earth shall bring forth her increase  For us the flocks shall wear a golden fleece  Fat Beeves shall yield us dainties not our own  And the grape bleed a nectar yet unknown  For our advantage shall their harvests grow  And  Scotsmen  reap what they disdain'd to sow  For us the sun shall climb the eastern hill  For us the rain shall fall the dew distil  When to our wishes NATURE cannot rise  ART shall be task'd to grant us fresh supplies  His brawny arm shall drudging LABOUR strain  And for our pleasure suffer daily pain  TRADE shall for us exert her utmost pow'rs  Her's all the toil and all the profit our's  For us the oak shall from his native steep  Descend and fearless travel thro' the deep  The sail of COMMERCE for our use unfurl'd  Shall waft the treasures of each distant world  For us sublimer heights shall science reach  For us their Statesmen plot their Churchmen preach  Their noblest limbs of counsel we'll disjoint  And mocking new ones of our own appoint  Devouring WAR imprison'd in the north  Shall at our call in horrid pomp break forth  And when his chariot wheels with thunder hung  Fell Discord braying with her brazen tongue  Death in the van with Anger Hate and Fear  And Desolation stalking in the rear  Revenge by Justice guided in his train  He drives impetuous o'er the trembling plain  Shall at our bidding quit his lawful prey  And to meek gentle gen'rous Peace give way  Think not my sons that this so bless'd estate  Stands at a distance on the roll of fate  Already big with hopes of future sway  E'en from this cave I scent my destin'd prey  Think not that this dominion o'er a race  Whose former deeds shall time's last annals grace  In the rough face of peril must be sought  And with the lives of thousands dearly bought  Nofool'd by cunning by that happy art  Which laughs to scorn the blund'ring hero's heart  Into the snare shall our kind neighbours fall  With open eyes and fondly give us all  When ROME to prop her sinking empire bore  Their choicest levies to a foreign shore  What if we seiz'd like a destroying flood  Their widow'd plains and fill'd the realm with blood  Gave an unbounded loose to manly rage  And scorning mercy spar'd nor sex nor age  When for our interest too mighty grown  Monarchs of warlike bent possess'd the throne  What if we strove divisions to foment  And spread the flames of civil discontent  Assisted those who 'gainst their king made head  And gave the traitors refuge when they fled  When restless GLORY bad her sons advance  And pitch'd her standard in the fields of France  What if disdaining oaths an empty sound  By which our nation never shall be bound  Bravely we taught unmuzzled war to roam  Thro' the weak land and brought cheap laurels home  When the bold traitors league for the defence  Of Law Religion Liberty and Sense  When they against their lawful Monarch rose  And dar'd the Lord's Anointed to oppose  What if we still rever'd the banish'd race  And strove the Royal Vagrants to replace  With fierce rebellions shook th' unsettled state  And greatly dar'd tho' cross'd by partial fate  These facts which might where Wisdom held the sway  Awake the very stones to bar our way  There  shall be nothing nor one trace remain  In the dull region of an English brain  Bless'd with that  Faith  which mountains can remove  First they shall  Dupes  next  Saints  last  Martyrs  prove  Already is this game of fate begun  Under the sanction of my Darling Son  That Son whose nature royal as his name  Is destin'd to redeem our race from shame  His boundless pow'r beyond example great  Shall make the rough way smooth the crooked straight  Shall for our ease the raging floods restrain  And sink the mountain level to the plain  DISCORD whom in a cavern under ground  With massy fetters our late Patriot bound  Where her own flesh the furious Hag might tear  And vent her curses to the vacant air  Where that she never might be heard of more  He plantedLOYALTY to guard the door  For better purpose shall Our Chief release  Disguise her for a time and call her PEACE  Lur'd by that name fine engine of deceit  Shall the weak ENGLISH help themselves to cheat  To win our love with honours shall they grace  The old adherents of the STUART race  For pointed out no matter by what name  TORIES or JACOBITES are still the same  To sooth our rage the temporising brood  Shall break the ties of truth and gratitude  Against their Saviour venom'd falshoods frame  And brand with calumny their WILLIAM's name  To win our grace rare argument of wit  To our untainted faith shall they commit  Our saith which in extremest perils tried  Disdain'd and still disdains to change her side  That Sacred Majesty they all approve  Who most enjoys and best deserves their Love  FINIS
