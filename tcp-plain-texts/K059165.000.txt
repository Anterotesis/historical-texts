 MEMOIRS OF SOME TRANSACTIONS DURING The late MINISTRY OF  Robert  E of  Oxford  LONDON  Printed for  T Warner  at the  BlackBoy  in  PaterNosterRow    Price One Shilling  MEMOIRS OF SOME TRANSACTIONS DURING The late MINISTRY c  VVHEN there is such a general Expectation of some great Matter to be made appear against the Person these Sheets relate to and much Pains is taken to calumniate and misrepresent him to the World it may not be amiss to give the World some true State of his Case that none may be impos'd upon thro' Ignorance how far soever Malice may carry some  The Matter draws towards a Crisis the Question will soon be transferr'd from between Party and Party to a Bar of Justice and the Blood of an  English  Nobleman is to be the Subject of the Pleadings and Defence  The Earl of  Oxford  seems to resolve to appear and to stand in his own Defence I advance one thing without Doors in Defence of his Case in general before the Particulars come to be enquired into If it be just to say of my Lord  Bolingbroke  that he knows himself to be guilty why else did he fly It will be as reasonable to say of my Lord of  Oxford  he is satisfied in his own Innocence why else does he stay  Besides the Opinion his Lordship has of his own Innocence it must be acknowledg'd his Lordship pays the greatest Honour to the  British  Nobility that is possible to do and perhaps more than was ever done before that however the Turns of  the Government since his Administration may have given Impressions of things very different from what were in his Time and as it might be suggested very much to his Disadvantage nay however Interest may seeem to run even in a very strong Stream against him yet that he pays such a profound Respect to the unspotted Honour of the Peerage as to cast his Life into their Hands at a Time when Thoughts less generous might be apt to entertain some Fears of the Impressions which Party might have made on the Minds of the Nobility at a Time when it is scarce to be said that any other Sett of Men in the Nation are entirely free  Either my L  O  must have some surprizing Evidence in himself of his own Innocence and not only so but of his being able to set that Innocence in a clear Light to the World or else he makes the greatest Compliment to the Nobility of  Britain  that ever Man made He supposes their Lordships untainted  with the Prejudice of the Times and that nothing can byafs their Minds nothing artfully prepossess their Judgments that they cannot be blinded by any humane Infirmities moved by any Passions imposed upon by the Perswasions or affected by private Views of any kind that they cannot be hurry'd by popular Winds or Storms from whatever Corner they may blow whether of Faction Tumult Envy or Ambition But that they will move in a direct Path of Justice guided by Truth without the least Deviation or Inclination one Way or other either from Parties Persons Interest or Power of any kind whatsoever  Besides this his Lordship seems to pay a most dutiful and honourable Regard to the personal Justice Clemency and Honour of His Majesty declaring by thus putting himself on his Trial at such a Juncture as this that he firmly depends upon His Majesty's Royal Virtue that nothing will on the King's Part be offered or encouraged to byass or lead to  awe or any Way influence the Judgment that shall be given in his Case that shall not so much as be imagined that the Votes of the Peers one Way or other shall in the least affect them in their Interest or in the Favour of His Majesty  It must be acknowledged that in this his Lordship acts from a Principle of great Justice and Duty as well to His Majesty as to the House of Peers and no Man can say without manifest Injury to his Majesty or to that Honourable House that he so much as believes his Lordship will be the worst treated for that dutiful and generous Behaviour  Without Doors we cannot say it will be the same it were to be wished the People who shew such a Warmth in their Desires to bring on the Trial of this Lord would shew the like Disposition to having him fairly acquitted if his Innocence shall appear as they seem to shew for his Destruction on a Presumption of his Guilt  It is now come to the great Question Nothing less than his Life or his Death is the Case If we were to make a Judgment of him by the Opinions and Tempers of Men without Doors it would be easy to conclude what should be his Fate and his Courage must be thought greater than his Discretion to put himself upon his Tryal which makes the Honour done to the Justice and Impartiality of His Majesty and the Peers of which mention is made already be the greater  Yet we would hope that seeing it is now brought this length Men will begin to be more serious and forbear to importune the Justice of the Nation by their Invectives and indecent Treatment My Lord has appealed from the Clamours of the People to the Justice and Honour of the Peers and being thus in the Hands of Justice what is there that Men can desire more They who occupy their Pens or Tongues now to blacken defame or reproach  him openly challenge the House of Peers reproach their Justice and villify that August Assembly as if not disposed to do Justice in the Case when it comes before them As his Lordship has thrown himself upon the Honour and Justice of the Peers and put his Life and Honour into their Lordships Hands so should we do and not either lead or direct them which would be in the grossest Manner to suspect their Proceedings  The Clamours which have hitherto been made on this Account have been as the Authors pretended only to have Men impeached and we have seen Writers tell the Government  They expect it  It is now done we hope they will be satisfy'd and not tell the House of Peers whether they shall acquit or condemn This must be left in their own Breasts and there is no Doubt but they will act as Justice and their own Honour shall direct and of this we must all wait the Issue  That we may attend this great Event with less Curiosity and Impatience it may be proper to state the Facts of this noble Lord's Conduct as they appear at present in those very Cases wherein he is so much impugned and attack'd that when People have cool Thoughts about them they may be disposed to read them over perhaps when they have done so they will be the backwarder to blame the House of Peers if they should not find it as they may expect  In the latter End of King  William  's Reign we found Mr  Harley  chosen Speaker of the House of Commons He was in the Session before one of those Members who stood firm to the Resolution of disbanding the Army having always an Opinion that the Security of the Prince was sufficiently provided for in the Affection of his faithful Commons and that all the Dangers which as was then pretended appeared from the growing Power of  France  were far less  and easier to be struggled with in any Incident which might happen than those which might proceed from a standing Force of Mercenaries to be kept up in Time of Peace by which very thing this Kingdom had more than once been in great Danger of having her Liberty overwhelmed and the worst of Slavery entailed upon her and that therefore the War being over the Nation ought to take effectual Care of their own Liberties and to limit the Number of the Forces to such and no more as might be thought sufficient for the publick Safety  It was not altogether so agreeable to His Majesty's Thoughts at that Time as could have been wish'd and especially the Regiment of  Dutch  Guards were exceedingly desired by the King but it could not be The Members declar'd That it was not from a Jealousy or Disrespect for the Person of His Majesty who they were throughly satisfied would neither himself or by his Permission ever suffer an Army to oppress them  but that the Precedent would be dangerous to Posterity when the Successors of His Majesty might perhaps make a fatal Use of that Advantage of which he would make no Advantage at all  It was reported at that Time that Mr  Harley  was chosen against the Measures of the Court and that the King was disobliged by him to the last Degree on Account of the aforesaid breaking of the Forces But His Majesty himself removed the Scandal of that Rumour by assuring Mr  Harley  that he was very well satisfy'd with him and indeed the Principles upon which the  English  Gentlemen went at that Time were so evidently essential to the preserving their Liberties that the King himself who was a great Patron of Liberty was perfectly satisfy'd with the thing afterwards and likewise with the Persons expressing a very particular Esteem for Mr  Harley  to the Time of his Death which happened soon after  At the Accession of the Queen to the Crown Her Majesty was pleased to chuse Her Ministry among a Sett of Men who there was some Reason to have expected other Conduct from them to Her Majesty at least the Queen expected it but they who knew them better were not so much disappointed in them as Her Majesty was  It imports not to record their Failings farther than thus to let Posterity know they began to precipitate the Crown in many Cases to a Degree that must in Time have been fatal  In all these Cases Mr  Harley  signalized himself by that famous Stand which he made in Behalf of the Liberties of his Country of which those who shared in the Advantage cannot entirely forget the Particulars Those who were nearest the  Queen  and most faithful to Her Interest finding the Influence he had in the House was of use to them on many Accounts began about this  Time to see he was a Person necessary to keep a closer Correspondence with and having found the  Queen  of the same Opinion he was received into the Cabinet Measures and the nicest Affairs communicated to him  In this Station he obtain'd upon the Opinion not only of the Persons who he necessarily was embark'd with as the late E of  Godolphin  the Duke of  M  and some others but of the  Queen  more especially who with my L  Godolphin  had a singular Esteem for him  It was easy for Mr  Harley  in this Scituation to convince Her Majesty of the absolute Necessity She was in of changing Her Measures and of dismissing a furious Faction who began to be odious to the People by their pushing the Government upon such things as tended to embroil Her Majesty with Her best Subjects and make the War abroad which was then newly entred into be either impracticable or unsuccessful by  reason of the Discontents at Home which were rising to a great Height among the People and sometimes between the Two Houses of Parliament themselves  In the Pursuit of this Council the Advantage whereof the whole Kingdom feels to this Day the  Queen  was pleased to dismiss Sir  Edward Seymour  's Party so they were call'd and fill up the Houshold with such a Ministry as the present Age pretends to be very well satisfy'd in the prime Ministry as it is call'd resting in the late Lord Treasurer  Godolphin  the Army in the D of  M    h  and Mr  Harley  was made Secretary of State in the Room of the E of  N    m  Sir  Charles Hedges  keeping the Seals as the other Secretary of State as he was before  Thus the Introduction of that Ministry was the Work of Mr  Harley  and it was to his Counsels that they ow'd their being established in the full Administration of Affairs which whilst they carry'd on with Unanimity of Councils and without  Jealousy of one another were administred with great Satisfaction to Her Majesty and all Her People at Home as well as with glorious Successes abroad during this Time the Animosities among the good People began exceedingly to abate the Remembrances of  Occasional Bills Tackings  c wore much off of the Minds of the People and the Court generally discouraging the Breaches among the  Queen  's Subjects an open and free Administration was carry'd on by which Room was left for all Her Majesty's Subjects of whatever Party to restore themselves to Her Favour by their Merit and to wipe out the Remembrances of any Miscarriages by a future dutiful Behaviour A Method of Government exceedingly agreeable to the  Queen  as it would had it gone on have been in Time healing to the Nation  But this happy Scheme was not alike pleasing to all and some who had Cravings in Nature to satisfy which were not so consistent with this disinterested Manner of Management  began to be uneasy at the Apprehensions of letting in the Mob as it was call'd into their Affairs The Interest in Her Majesty which as it was call'd was not a thing of so little Value to be laid open and Her Favour and Confidence to be made Common to the People They found that as they had made it a Property so their Success gave them an Advantage above all that went before them by seeming to make themselves necessary to Her Majesty This Point was carried on to such an Extremity the Sweetness of governing even their Sovereign alluring that finding Mr  Harley  inflexible and that he would not join in such narrow Measures but desir'd that the  Queen  might Reign for Her self and all Her Subjects have Access to Her that She might be fully apprized of all Her Affairs and act as well by Knowledge as Advice Finding this was the Scheme he had laid and that it was directly opposite to their own and would in the End overthrow it They from that Time  entred into Measures either to supplant him in Her Majesty's Favour or in his Employment  The first notwithstanding many Misrepresentations and mean Steps taken they could not effect the last they brought to pass for a Season  It seems that they brought the last to pass with Difficulty and it was evident to them as also to others that as her Majesty parted not with Mr  Harley  without great Reluctance so that altho' he was dismiss'd from the Office of her principal Secretary that yet he had access to her Person and had opportunity to communicate such Councils as occasion offer'd having the Honour from that time of a Confidence with his Sovereign which those who had Power to displace him had then no Share in  This Favour of his Prince was much encreased by some foul things which had been discover'd to her Majesty to have been practised upon him in order to render him suspected to  be concern'd in the Treason of Mr  Gregg  and more especially by some Steps which were privately taken by some Persons in order by Fear of Death or Hope of Mercy to induce the said  Gregg  when under Sentence of Death to accuse Mr  Harley  and as her Majesty receiv'd the Account of those Designs with Tokens of great Displeasure and even of Detestation so the Declaration which the Criminal gave even just before his Execution of the Innocence of Mr  Harley▪  as it was a particular Satisfaction to the Queen so it confirm'd the Opinion her Majesty had conceived of Mr  Harley  as a Person proper to be entrusted and fit to be employed in her Service  It might have been useful to have descended to the Particulars of this Matter and to the Persons likewise but another time may be thought more proper this suffices to shew that there was at that time a horrid Conspiracy against the Life of this noble Lord how far it has been carried on or revived since▪ and whether  it be by the same Hands or not will likewise appear the Time being approaching when there may be reason to lay the blackest part of this Transaction open to the View of the Sun  Mean time it is worth notice that as the Persons concerned would not have failed to have accepted the Evidence of Mr  Gregg  against Mr  Harley  if he had either known any thing whereof to accuse him or had been prevailed with to have forged any Accusation in order to have saved his Life yet some of them were not backward to depretiate the dying Words of the same Man when it appeared they tended to clear the Person who they desired rather should have been accused discovering thereby such a Partiality as her Majesty was pleased to take notice of to be as criminal in its Degree as the Design aforesaid against his Life  It's strange  said she once upon that Occasion  that they would not have us believe the Man now he acquits Mr  Harley  when they would have believed him if he had accused him  and  that they will not believe the  Man's dying Words when it is evident they would have laid great Weight upon them if he had lived  her Majesty was pleased likewise many times when this Affair was upon any Occasion mention'd to her to express her Concern that any Methods so unchristian and unjust should be taken by Persons so near Her to destroy an innocent Person  Yet could not this put a Stop to the Enemies of Mr  Harley  who it seems were restless in their own Scituation while they observed his to be so near her Majesty's Person as would upon all Occasions interrupt the farther Designs which they had calculated for their own Advantage in being single and uninterrupted in the Administration and therefore tho' they could not impose upon her Majesty in the Case abovemention'd of Mr  Gregg  they left not any Stone unturn'd to keep the People of their own Party deceived and to have it by PamphletWritings and private Emissaries suggested throughout the Kingdom that Mr  Harley  was guilty of  Gregg  's  Treason tho' nothing could be proved that ever justified so much as a Suspicion And altho'  Gregg  himself who could never have been convicted but by his own Confession had been induced by Mr  Harley  to make that Confession so that Mr  Harley  seemed that way to have been the very Instrument of detecting him more fully and by consequence of his Death a Provocation sufficient to make any one expect that if he could have saved his Life at Mr  Harley  's Expence he would have made no Difficulty of the Exchange and not a little the Reason of that  low Step  some Persons otherwise Persons of Honour took to bring it to pass which it may be believed they would not for their own Sakes have been seen in if they had thought it could have failed of Success  But  Gregg  tho' a Traytor would not be a Murtherer Whether they were not so who endeavoured to make him so will be tryed at another Tribunal  As these things concurr'd to improve that Interest which Mr  Harley  had in her Majesty's Favour so it made way for and not a little contributed to the Breaches which followed and the Impressions they made in her Majesty in Prejudice of those Men who were concern'd were such as were not easily wiped out Her Majesty who was a Princess of exceeding Piety believing that Men who could stoop to such wicked and even bloody Methods to remove a Person out of the Way of their Administration would stick at few things that could occur and were ill qualify'd to bring about the Blessing of Her Reign in the Felicity of Her People which was Her utmost Desire  But things were not yet brought to Maturity nor the Grievance of the Administration come to its Height and several things were yet to happen which should concur with the Impressions Her Majesty had received before to lessen the Pleasure She took in the Services of some about  Her and consequently make Way for their Remove But as these do not concern Mr  Harley  they shall be no otherwise mentioned than as they served to introduce the Revolution which followed  It was in the Year when Mr  Harley  was dismiss'd from the Office of  Secretary of State  and Mr  Boyle  now Lord  Carleton  succeeded him in that Place a modest inoffensive Gentleman and concerned neither one way or other in the Brigues abovementioned And now it was thought they who had the Administration would have gone on in their Business without any Interruption that they had none to disturb them but that he who they pretended would have supplanted them being laid aside they were out of Danger and it may be said of them that they were weak enough to think thus themselves but they soon found themselves deceived and that the very Persons who had push'd them upon the Breach with Mr  Harley  on pretence of supplanting them with the Queen were in a  strong Confederacy or Plot to supplant them with the People and by the Consequence thereof with the Queen and wanted nothing but to remove Mr  Harley  from them to make way for the Execution of their Design as the Person whose Interest in the Queen as well as his Capacity to disappoint them they above all other thought to be dangerous to them  It is with the more Reason that it is said they thought by the Consequence of supplanting the Ministry they should effectually supplant them with the Queen because having made the Experiment in the Case of Mr  Harley  that the Queen might be prevailed on by their new Method of treating her Majesty to part with Ministers tho' She was not dissatisfied with them they concluded they might take the same Method and bring her Majesty to the Necessity so they undutifully called it of parting with others And that this is true in Fact that this was their View at that Time is proved by a  Letter written by a noble Lord then in the Ministry who when their Plot broke out had the Weakness or Want of Decency to write a Letter to the Dof  R  into  Scotland  wherein he treats her Majesty and Ministry both in the Words following  'I would not have you be bullied by the CourtParty for the Queen her self cannot support that Faction long'  This was strange Language from a Secretary of State actually in Office and eminently discovered that the Charge publickly laid against Mr  Harley  of a Design to supplant the Ministry should have been laid on another Hand who now publickly viewed a Design not only of supplanting the Ministry who he called a Faction but of bringing the Queen into such a Condition as not to be able to support them  It became soon evident that the Persons who this noble Lord called a Faction were no other than the late Earl of  Godolphin  and his Grace the  Dof  M  The One at that Time at the Head of the Army the Other of the Treasury as by their farther open Declarations in the Election of the next Parliament appeared in which the Juncto to the WhigNobleMen embarkt in this Design were called openly joined with the malecontented Party so the high Church were then nay even with the Jacobites against the Ministry villifying and exposing the said Lord and Duke and especially a certain Dutchess in a Manner far exceeding all that unjustifiable Rudeness that has been made use of since that Time  This however obliged her Majesty to concern her self in the matter and to let the Juncto see that She was able to support her Servants and that She would not be reduced to the Necessity they boasted of the Consequence of this was that they were effectually disappointed and afterwards made no Difficulty to make their separate Peace with her Majesty and her Ministry To which Transaction Fame refers us for an  eminent Original of abandoning Allies  c  for it was observable that when they made their own Peace they left all their Confederates to the Discretion of the Ministry  But this Matter had another Effect for which Reason it is made a necessary Part of this Account  viz  that in the interval of this Breach much was discovered of the Infirmity to say no worse of it of both Sides and while they were villifying one another to render their Designs black in the View of the People they really as it often happens in lesser Cases made the Persons on both Sides look less in the Esteem of the World than they did before there was much Dirt cast on both Sides in the Quarrel and it cannot be said that it was all wiped off in the Reconciliation nor did the Breach leave either Side in the same Station of her Majesty's Esteem as it found them  Her Majesty was a strict Observer at that Time of every Article of the Conduct of either Side and it made  no small Impression on her Mind that She found both Sides were to make a Property of her Authority and that She was to be reduced to a Necessity of acting their Measures which Side soever prevailed From which just Observation tho' her Majesty sound it needful to support the Ministry then in her Service against those who so openly affronted her Administration as well as her Person in opposing them at that Time yet from that Time her Majesty entertained Thoughts of a general Change in her Measures and resolved to set her self free as soon as might be from the unhappy Necessity which it seems it was so easie to reduce her to  viz  of not being able to support her own Administration  This was perfectly agreeable to the Scheme formerly proposed by Mr  Harley  to the Lord  Godolphin  and often explain'd to her Majesty before that Time  viz  to restore her Majesty to an entire Freedom of acting that all her Affairs should be explained to and laid before her Majesty that She  should no more wear the Crown without the Scepter that the Doors should be opened to all Her Subjects and a free Access to Her Person be given to all that Cases of Consequence might not come cover'd with the Representations of the Ministers but every thing be laid fairly before the  Queen  that She might act with open Eyes see for Her self and give to not receive Commands from Her Ministry Her Majesty had with some Regret received the former Importunities of some about Her in the Case of placing or displacing of Persons and especially that unpleasant uncomely as well as undutiful Expression of  I cannot serve Your Majesty unless  c and began to be tir'd with some Peoples personal Conduct whose Services were otherwise very acceptable to Her and their Fidelity entirely unsuspected  There were two other things which Her Majesty could not avoid taking a particular Notice of in this Breach and the future Conduct of these very Persons make it very much to the  present Purpose to mention it here  viz  That the said  Juncto  made no Scruple in order to displace the said Lord and Duke to bring the most known prosess'd  Jacobites  as well of the Nobility as of the Commons as well in  Scotland  as in  England  into their Confederacy and even to Vote for them in the Election of the Parliament then chusing and many of them were actually elected by the Interest of the said Whig  Juncto  the Names are easy to be given That they made no Difficulty of displacing the D of  M    h  from the Command of the Army and thought there would be no Danger to the Confederacy in it at all and Her Majesty was inform'd that they went so far as to sound the  Dutch  either to see how they would approve of a Change or to prepare them not to be surpriz'd at it The like things having been censured in such rude Terms by the same Persons who then for their own private Ends engag'd in them Her Majesty could not but call to mind the Circumstances and look on the Persons  with some Resentment when they came to speak of the same things as trayterous ungrateful perfidious and the like  These and such as these were the things which pav'd the Way for the new Turn which soon after happened in which Mr  Harley  acted consonant to what he had from the first propos'd laying before Her Majesty such Measures as were calculated for quieting not disturbing the Administration not proposing such Change of Parties and such Turnings out of Persons as afterwards happened no such thing being in View till the Combinations of certain Persons in Places and who acted upon the old Principle of reducing the  Queen  to the Necessity of acting as they desired oblig'd Her Majesty to do it  It is not needful to enter into the Detail of the Conduct of others but this Passage cannot be omitted  viz  that the Evening of that Day when the  Treasurer  the Earl of  Godolphin  was displaced a general Meeting  of the Persons in that Interest was held at Mr  B  House where it was laid down as a Maxim that the new Managers could no Way support the Undertaking that they could never be able to keep up the publick Credit raise Money or carry on the War but would soon plunge the  Queen  in such inextricable Difficulties as that She would be forc'd to come back to them and therefore it was their Business one and all to resolve not to come into the  Queen  's Measures in order to distress Her new Ministers and so oblige Her to dismiss them  How openly they pursued this Resolution is well known as also how Mr  Harley  now made Chancellor of the  Exchequer  and one of the Commissioners of the  Treasury  surmounted all the Difficulties which they cast in the Way supply'd the Money kept up the Credit and run into no Plunges as was suggested by which they were no less surprized than disappointed all this is recent and known  It is named here to shew where began the Mischief of the Change this Meeting of the late Managers was neither more or less than forming themselves into a Faction against the  Queen  and Her new Measures which though it did not produce the Necessity upon the  Queen  of changing Her Ministry again as they expected yet it did put the new Managers upon making use of other Hands than they intended to which Point of Circumstance all that has since happened may be traced back as to its proper and only Original for had that Faction not been formed or had they not when formed absolutely rejected the  Queen  's Offers of Accommodation and of keeping them in their Places nothing is more true than that all things had gone on in the usual Course of the Administration by the same Methods to the same Purpose and almost by the same Persons as before  But Sathan hindered  and the Conduct of the outed Party was very singular on that Occasion  It occurr'd to them naturally that the Parliament in being would take some Step in their Favour and that they should be able to spread the Uneasiness much farther if not throughout the Kingdom and it offered as a Foundation of forming a new Interest in their Favour this pass'd a while and their Friends in the City falling upon the new Ministry with some Attempts of another Nature it was evident they supported those Attempts by their Dependance on their Interest in the Parliament and so open they were in their Politicks on this Occasion that they were not backward to say The Parliament would unravel the new Measures and the  Queen  could go on no farther than the next Session The Ministry were too vigilant not to see the Design nor was Mr  Harley  ignorant how far they might probably go to make good their Threats This made it absolutely necessary to dissolve the Parliament the Inclination of the People also to the Change now beginning  to appear more than it had done before and the new Elections appearing to be generally on the Side of the Change the Resolutions of the Party mention'd above began to waver their Interest separate and in fine the new Ministry after this met with less Difficulty and Obstruction in their Affairs though not with less ill Treatment from particular Persons and from the Party in the City especially where the Ferment went too high to be spoken of in a narrow Compass and where the Measures taken to ruin the Publick Credit were such though unsuccessful as has not been ever practis'd before and gave Her Majesty great Cause to resent them even on the whole Party  In this Juncture Mr  Harley  was snatch'd from the Administration by an unparallell'd Attempt upon his Life at first it surpriz'd every one as it began to be thought the Attempt of the aforesaid Party or some set on Work by them but it soon appear'd the single Act of an enrag'd  Frenchman  the  Marquiss de Guiscard  made desperate by being detected of a Treasonable Correspondence with  France  who assassinated Mr  Harley  at the Council Table stabbing him into the Breast with a Penknife and repeating the Blow a second Time not knowing that the Penknife was broke and the Blade left in the Wound he gave him a Contusion with the Handle by the next Blow more dangerous and painful than the first What mov'd this  Scelerat  to such an horrid Act the apprehending him wounding him his Imprisonment and Death in the Prison of  Newgate  are needless in this Account being also made publick at that Time by other Writers  None could be blamed for being of the Opinion till the Particulars appear'd that this Blow was given by the Procurement of the other Party because it suited so exactly with the Language given publickly the Person of Mr  Harley  at that Time as well in the City as elsewhere that it was confess'd by themselves the Suspicion  was just But the Horror of the Fact so touch'd those who had a Sense of Humanity that the Generality even of the Enemies of the new Ministry could not refrain expressing themselves with some Warmth against it and it assisted for some time to the treating him with something less Indecency than before and not only so but the Affairs of the Government gaining upon the Opposers every Day the new Measures began to be better relish'd among the People than before  Soon after the Recovery of Mr  Harley  and his Conduct in the publick Affairs having satisfy'd Her Majesty that his Qualifications for the Employment were equal to the Weight of such an Employ the Commission for the  Treasury  was dissolved and Mr  Harley  was made Lord  High Treasurer  of  Great Britain  Her Majesty doing him the Honour to give Him the Staff with Her own Hand and at the same Time to sign a Patent creating him  Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer  and soon  after created him also  Knight of the Garter  These things are needful to mention because they are the Sum of all the Advantages which he can be said to share out for himself having not his Enemies being Judges accumulated Honour or Profits as has been usual by Persons in great Posts and this may be said without Boasting that no personal Avarice no aggrandizing of his Family no getting of Grants either to himself or to his Family has been or with Justice can be charged on him though by the Share he enjoy'd of His Royal Mistress's Favour it might be suppos'd that he could not want Opportunity for many things which might have been as profitable as the most craving Temper might be satisfy'd with  The new Parliament being met the Lower House appeared enclin'd dutifully to oblige Her Majesty in every thing consistent with their Liberties and with the publick Good  and the  Queen  never desiring any thing of them which shock'd their Affections to their Country's Safety and Advantage This mutual Rectitude of Principle created a perfect Harmony between Her Majesty and the House every thing offered by the House to Her Majesty met with a gracious Reception and ready Grant and every thing laid before them by the  Queen  was so just and so clear that the House with an entire Confidence came into Her Majesty's Measures cheerfully and with the greatest Alacrity imaginable  This Harmony was a great Disappointment to the Party who opposed the Ministry and was chiefly owing to the exact Adhering to such Measures in the Administration as could admit no substantial Objection for it could not be said that the other People were not vigilant to take Hold of every thing that might have given them any just Advantage The  Treasurer  as far as he directed any thing took  Care to keep it within the ordinary Rules of Business and particularly knowing what Men he had to do with took Care to have every thing transacted in full Council and to be duly minuted in the Books He kept to the Principle first laid down of having the  Queen  see with Her own Eyes and after duly debating things in Her Presence to have every thing directed by Her Majesty with Consent of Her own Knowledge that Her Majesty might have no Occasion to say as had been too much the Case formerly that She left things to such and such Persons and had been ill serv'd  The  Treasurer  likewise took especial Care to have all Business transacted in the proper Offices and sign'd by the Hands whose Province it was thereby restoring the Administration to its natural Course and delivering the Government from the Grievance of a  PRIME MINISTER  and this is evident now even to the Surprize of his Enemies who having suppos'd that the  Treasurer  transacted  every thing as had been the general Belief and for which all along the Party loaded him with infinite Aspersions find now that he really managed nothing separately and rather employ'd himself to preserve the Oeconomy of the Administration and see the publick Business distributed into the proper Hands and then leaving those Hands to discharge their Duty than interposing his own Authority or encroaching upon the Province of the Ministers  Perhaps this Truth is so new and the contrary has been so generally received that it will not immediately meet with that Credit that ought to be expected to a thing so manifest but when it shall appear that in unravelling the Administration of those Times nothing can be found transacted by him but what was the particular Duty of his Office as  Treasurer  and that on the contrary every Minister of State did the Duty of his Place and acted to the full what was his particular Province to  act and that consequently they cannot fasten such things upon the Treasurer as it was hoped he might be charged with  I say  if this should not be the Case it will be a full Confirmation of what is said here that he rather directed every Man to his Duty than acted in their Province himself It was his Complaint during the Administration of others that they engrossed the Business into their Hands that the Secretaries and Privy Council were but Agents and were made use of for Form only and that the  Queen  being surrounded by them all Access to her Person was cut off and it was his profess'd Intention that it should be otherwise in his Administration and if this is not made sufficiently evident to those who are now so narrowly inspecting his Conduct by the Manner in which they will find all Business transacted there is another Proof which will occur to every Understanding  viz  the Power the other Ministers of State and Men of Intreigue obtained hereby with the Queen by which they afterwards took upon them to  oppose his Councils and at last effectually supplanted him  If it had been true that every thing had been done by him as it was unjustly said by his Enemies it could not have been true that his Management was ill approved of by the Queen and other Men entrusted distinct from him and who when he opposed them appeared to have a greater Interest in her Majesty than he had till at length they obliged him either to come into their Measures which in regard to the Good of his Country he could not comply with or to withdraw from them and quit the Administration which he  very happily for himself  chose to do  In this Conduct consists so much his present Safety that we see some of his Enemies very much disappointed in that they cannot find him in several Parts of the Management of things which they thought were all his own and it is surprising to find how far this Opinion of his being the  Fac Totum  in all the Administration  had prevailed and the Enemies of the Treasurer are under some Confusion by their not finding all Business directed by him It is manifest that they had entertained a Notion that the Queen was wholly governed by him that She did nothing her self and nothing but by his Direction which is so evidently untrue that it appears her Majesty not only acted without him but even contrary to him in many things till at last She was pleased to enter wholly into the Measures of other Men and when he could not be prevailed upon to join in those Measures thought fit to act quite without him▪ This however unexpected will shew that what has often been said to the Queen her self is now confirmed  viz  that the Treasurer bore the Load of many things which he had no concern in and indeed this was evidently one Reason why he drew out of the Administration of which and of whose Mistakes tho' he did not approve he was sure to bear the Scandal  It is not to the Purpose to enter here into the Reasons why the Treasurer rejected the Measures proposed to him by these new Men whether they were consistent with the publick Good or the Queen's Safety and Honour is fitter for them to defend than for him to enquire into it suffices to say they were such as the Treasurer thought were not for her Majesty's Service and that therefore he declined the public Affairs rather than go on upon those Foundations It is effectually proved by the Circumstance of his Dismiss also that the Administration consisted of several Parts and was not engrossed  as was suggested  by the Treasurer in an arbitrary manner The Discontents of other Men having been carried to such a Length as to affront him even in the Execution of his Office and to reject all the Offers of an Accommodation or Reconciliation which the Treasurer frequently made to them that the public Business might not be hindred It is likewise to be observed that in these Offers of Reconciliation the Treasurer  always represented the absolute Necessity there was of having every Office do its own Business and the Administration to run in the due Course according to the ordinary Administration without any suggesting the Superintendency of a prime Minister or so much as claiming any Reserve to himself being willing to confine himself to the Sphere of his Office with more Strictness than any of them desired  It was not the least Affliction to the Treasurer that he found the Avarice of some Men in Office and the Ambition of others to be made great sooner than ordinary began early to offer Obstructions to the public Business and that he was frequently ill used by those who he thought had Reason to treat him otherwise particularly by a certain  Esq  that he was not made a Peer so soon as he was willing to be so as also that when he was honoured with the Peerage it was but a Viscount and yet more that when some Garters were disposed he was not gratified This was  the more afflicting because that when this Person was at first by the Treasurer's Interest recommended to her Majesty for the Office which he was entrusted with the Treasurer believed he would have acted from Principles of Zeal for her Majesty's Service and a generous Concern for the Church and Nation in all he did without making his private Advancement the Sum of his Desires and pushing that Particular so far as to insult his Friends for the Delay however necessary that Delay would be to the Queen's Service who found it necessary to make use of his Service longer in the House of Commons and gave him Assurances at the same time that the Delay should be no Detriment to his Rank so that it only affected his Impatience not his Ambition which was an exceeding Aggravation of his Mistake shewing at what rate he esteemed his Mistress's Service and the Public Good which to a Minister of State should always go before his own Advancement  The Treasurer failed not upon all Occasions to represent to this Person and to his Friends the evil Consequences of dividing from the  Queen's  Service by dividing against one another but was always treated with Disrespect and with much Passion The necessary Concerts in publick Matters were much hindred by these things and it was scarce possible to go on in the Execution of Matters determined in the Council to be done all Confidence being hereby destroyed and the Harmony necessary in carrying on so much Business where so much Opposition was to be expected being thus broken it is not to be wondred at if it gave infinite Advantages to those who made that Opposition of which the Treasurer failed not in making just Representations as well to the Persons themselves as to her Majesty likewise who often spoke of the same with Regret  But it was all to no Purpose the Treasurer found the Heat encrease rather than abate and that it particularly  bent its Fury at such things which altho' they were particular to the Province of Treasurer he had thought fit to do without communicating his Schemes to him tho' at the same time they thought fit to carry on the Negotiations and Treaties abroad in many Cases without communicating their Measures to him and sometimes hardly to the Queen herself The Treasurer has been loth to mention the mean Reasons given for their quarrelling with him about the Scheme for Payment of the great Debt the Nation was engaged in  viz  that they should have gotten Money by it but since the secret Committee have thought fit to publish that Part of it which the Treasurer formerly laid before her Majesty whereby it is no longer a Secret it may serve to convince Mankind that the disinterested Conduct of the Treasurer in the Administration and his resolving to make no private Gain out of the Ruins of his Country was not the least Part of his Management which those Men disliked or  the least Reason why they behaved so uneasily to him  But to dwell no longer on this Part those who knew the Difficulties with which the Treasurer struggled in the Matters of Credit and of Money and the Opposition the Party whom the Queen had dismiss'd made to every Step that was taken to restore it could not but wonder that these Men who at the same Time confess themselves unequal to the Work should not be content to contribute no Assistance to it but should on the contrary so much obstruct things and encourage the Opposition of others as their Breaches one with another were known to do  The Treasurer had baffled the Designs of those who had endeavoured to prevent his remitting Money to the Army and the establishing the Credit of the Publick and notwithstanding at his Entrance into the Office he found the Exchequer exhausted the Bank refusing to advance Money upon such Securities as the  Government was able to offer had the Army at the same time in the Field which some People were not ashamed to own they expected should mutiny for their Pay yet he had mastered all these Difficulties and gave good Reason to believe that he would have gone thro' every other Obstruction and it was not a little afflicting to him to find his Opposers among those who he had by his Interest and Recommendation brought into Business  Yet as things are now like to go it is no little Satisfaction to him that if there has been any criminal Negotiations set on Foot any favouring the Pretender any Measures entred into to the Prejudice of the Succession of the House of  Hanover  these things must be found among those Parts of their Conduct which they were pleased to transact by themselves and to which they did not vouchsafe to admit the Treasurer as not being so much at that Time in their Confidence and as they acted these things by themselves so they must answer  for them by themselves if the present Government think fit to call them to Account for it the Treasurer having had no Concern in any thing of that Nature and is persuaded that no Man had the Assurance to make an Offer of any thing of that kind to her Majesty and that if they had that the  Queen  would have resented it with the utmost Indignation  The Obstruction these things gave to the publick Administration had divers other Effects and particularly it gave Encouragement to the outed Party in their vigorous Opposition of all her Majesty's Measures which they carried up to such a height as to expect the House of Peers would be brought to their Side and tho' the Treasurer had a firm Satisfaction in the Peers that they would not be imposed upon in these things yet seeing the Numbers appear'd something equal and that the Party discovered some Assurance of carrying their Point Her Majesty resolving not to run the Venture chose to make a Number of Lords for ballancing his  Enemies a Practice allowed by the Law and undoubtedly in the Prerogative however clamoured very much in the present Case and notwithstanding which as was evident by the Sequel the Treasurer's Opinion appear'd to be founded on a right Judgment of things  viz  that they were safe in the Votes of the Peers who were already in the House the Question being carried in the House by one Voice more than the Number of new Lords then created The Warmth of those People who at this Time pushed at the new Ministers may be judged of by that other Incident which attended at this Time  viz  That the OccasionalBill was at this Time brought in by them which they had always opposed before and which it seems was now submitted to in Favour of the E of  N's  Scheme who declared himself against the Administration from this Time for Reasons so mean as  requires not to be remembred and who however forgot not to  a good Capitulation with those  surrendred to and to gain this  Point of the Whiggs which they had always till now withstood but neither the E of  N  insisting on such high Terms for so mean an Advantage as the best Service he could do them nor the Easiness of the Whiggs at that Time to part with the Dissenters on such cheap Terms were by far so wonderful as the Satisfaction with which the Dissenters stood and lookt on while the Fetters and Mannacles of this new Law were fastened upon them it cannot be doubted that secret Engagements were entered into between the Parties to take off this Law again by Parliament when an Occasion should offer When that Occasion shall be said to offer Time must shew All the Use which Her Majesty made of these things was to see to what a Length those who resolved to oppose her Measures were come and what Sacrifices they would make to bring about their Schemes but these things moved Her not at all  It was far more afflicting to her Majesty to see Her Servants clashing with one another in the Execution of Her Commands and to see the Endeavours used by Herself and those who adhered to Her Pleasure ineffectual to the putting a Stop to it yet even these Evils tho' dangerous to the Administration had their Effect for the bringing about the great Event which now came on the Stage concurring with the Measures of the Whiggs so far as to make it be still more and more Her  Majesty's  Opinion that it was absolutely necessary to put an End to the War  The Treasurer's Opinion was not material on the Subject of a Peace the  Queen  having declared that it was Her firm Resolution if possible to be done upon just Conditions to put an End to the War but the Treasurer was more convinced of the Necessity as well as Justice of Her  Majesty's  said Resolution when he saw not only the Warmth wherewith the  opposite Party opposed the  Ministry  even in carrying on the War but the Divisions apparently breaking into the Administration by the Power of those who set up a new Faction in the Ministry and by the Influence they had not only upon the  Queen  but upon the Members of Parliament and upon some useful People in most Offices under her  Majesty  Yet the Treasurer took no Steps in the Affair of the Peace till the  French  having made Proposals of Peace to Her Majesty it came before him to consider whether those Proposals were such as might lay a Foundation for a solid Negotiation The Treasurer took nothing from them otherwise than  ad Referendum  neither entered into any secret Negotiation without Her  Majesty's  Direction and Knowledge What any other Person might do being employed or directed by this new Faction the Treasurer accounts not for any more than he does for many of the Orders and Directions given to the Persons  employed abroad to carry it on  in which he had no Concern  The Treasurer cannot but hope that the present Enquiry which is making into these things will serve to his Vindication in that Part wherein he suffers in the general Scandal of other Mens actings as if all things had been directed by him the contrary is evident in many other Cases besides that of the Peace wherein his Part of the Negotiations seemed rather to be to set to Rights the Mistakes made by others and to put them in the Way of a regular Negotiation after the most remiss and disconcerted Conduct had brought them into Confusion as was many times the Case If the Treaty suffered by those Steps and if the  French  were vigilant to make Advantage of the People who they found acted with less Regularity than in a Case of such Consequence they had Reason to expect the Treasurer has the Satisfaction of seeing that the Advantages so made are the less by  the Part he acted in that Matter and not the more  The Truth of what is said of the Treasurer not being Master of the Measures by which the said new Faction then acted was evident from their obtaining without his Consent or Knowledge an Order from Her  Majesty  to pay the Sum of Twenty Eight Thousand Thirty Six Pounds Five Shillings for Arms  c  on the Account of the Expedition to  Canada  which Sum the Treasurer scrupled to pay for such Reasons as are well known to be just among which one was that he had Reason to believe the said Demand was a Fraud that the Money was to be applyed to private Use and that the greatest Part if not all was not to be employed in the Service for which it was pretended to be asked which Reason likewise caused the Treasurer to withdraw himself out of that matter and to refuse for some time before to meet with those who transacted it  Neither will it be of any Force to say that the Breaches did not take Effect till toward the End of that Administration and that the Treasurer was the sole Director for the first Three Years as some insinuate to take off the Force of these Remarks for it is certain that tho' the open Discovery of these Divisions and their breaking out into a Flame did not appear without Doors till after the Peace was finished yet the fatal Influence of them began even at the Beginning of the  Ministry  the Interest began to divide in  Feb  and the Treasurer refused to meet in several Congresses of  their Allies  because he found them carrying on criminal Intreagues for the defrauding the Public and enriching themselves by the Spoils of their Country  It would expose the new Faction aforesaid should it be made publick how they treated the  Treasurer  for refusing to corrupt his Hands and stain his Integrity with betraying his Sovereign to those who he  foresaw would betray all to their voratious Avarice how he was never to be forgiven the Omission of such a Step and that they would by no Means be thought to have Justice from him if they were hinder'd from making a Prey of their Country  It is because he strives not to load any Man much less those who he fears have already too much Guilt to answer for that he forbears to enter into the detecting those Practices which he then abhorr'd it is enough to mention what those Men too well know the Truth of  viz  That from the Beginning he found their Measures too much calculated for private Advantage without that disinterested Aim at the publick Service which the Duty of Ministers of State requir'd and that according to his Duty he with Plainness and Sincerity  told them  his Thoughts of it in order to their reforming the Principle from which they acted  told the Queen of it  in order to prevent  Her Majesty's  being impos'd upon  and being able to do no more  withdrew from them  in those things which he did not approve as in particular that Affair of the Money demanded for the Expedition to  Canada  In which Affair the  Treasurer  has the Satisfaction of making it appear that he did not come into the Fraud and that notwithstanding the Importunity of the Persons he resisted their Demand of the Money till such repeated Orders were sent him to comply with it from  Her Majesty  as he had no Power to withstand and likewise has had the Satisfaction to find that since these things  Her Majesty  had an Opportunity to see the Cheat more openly detected by his Means and to know that whatever was suggested by the  Treasurer  of a design'd Fraud in that Case was true  But what was yet more wonderful was that the Persons concern'd were not asham'd to vindicate themselves in this Practice and to suggest  that they ought to be allow'd to do such things signifying also their great Resentment at the  Treasurer  as if they were wrong'd by him in being restrain'd from those things which no honest Man could allow  The Peace having been effectually set on Foot in the Year met with unexpected Opposition at Home and as it was thought that those of the Allies who seem'd to appear most active against it Abroad were mov'd to do so by the Impressions which they receiv'd from hence it was by  Her Majesty  's Command made his Province to set on Foot such Negotiations in such Foreign Courts as were necessary in order to undeceive the Princes and States Abroad as often as they had receiv'd ill Impressions of  Her Majesty  's Intentions and to set Her Measures in a true Light before them that no Misconstructions might be made of Her sincere Desires to act in Concert with them and for their Interests and consequently no fatal Misunderstandings  might happen in which might separate the Allies one from another which would be a Means to make the Advantages which might be obtain'd by an unanimous Treaty either less in themselves or difficult to obtain and it is not to be wonder'd if the  Treasurer  should afterwards in the Account of these things which he laid before  Her Majesty  in the Year say That during the first Year of the Peace  his Hands were full of negotiating the Peace in all Courts abroad  seeing the Conduct of these Men and the Mistakes they made made it often difficult as well as troublesome to reconcile their Measures and to distinguish between what they had done and what  Her Majesty  intended to have had them do  As to what was offer'd at Home against the Negotiations of the Peace  Her Majesty  took little Notice of nor did it make any other Impression on Her than to convince Her more and more of the Necessity She was under of finishing the War and  confirming Her Opinion in the Reasonableness of Her Negotiations The Opposition made about that Time to the publick Administration as well of the Treasury as of the military Affairs gave  Her Majesty  still less Disturbance for the  Treasurer  having been supported by the needful Funds which the Parliament with great Duty and Application dispatch'd to  Her Majesty  's Satisfaction easily surmounted the Difficulties which some endeavour'd to cast in his Way in the procuring Money to carry on the publick Affairs and the  Queen  's Business now began to be on a better Foot than ever The Party who from the Beginning had oppos'd  Her Majesty  's Measures at Home and embarrass'd them Abroad began to lose Courage and to give it over finding the  Queen  resolved to pursue Her just Designs and Her Servants in a Capacity to support Her Administration which they had been very positive in their Assurances to the Foreign Courts in Alliance with the  Queen  could not be brought to pass and on the Miscarriage  whereof the Sum of their Affair depended  As the said Assurances to the Foreign Courts had created much Difficulties to the Ministers and had made the Negotiations very precarious so when the Failure of those Assurances appear'd as it did very evident by the withdrawing of some Persons from the Kingdom and by the Submission of several active People at Home and by the dutiful and cheerful Concurrence of the Parliament then sitting in which all the Difficulties which could be started by the malecontent Party were clear'd up to the full Satisfaction of the said Parliament who evidently came into the Peace and even into the Manner or Terms of it I say on the Failure of those Assurances given from hence to some Foreign Courts and such necessary Steps as were taken by the  Treasurer  to assure those Courts of the Sincerity of  Her Majesty  's Intentions Many of those Courts appear'd satisfy'd and things went on in a free and open  Negotiation abroad for a while with more Success and less Difficulty than before  Yet even in this Part in which they could contribute so little did the Persons abovementioned give the publick Affairs all imaginable Obstruction and make the  Treasurer  's Work thereby exceedingly difficult by their frequent breaking in upon Measures acting rashly and without Concert and perhaps sometimes without sufficient Directions or Orders in things of the nicest Nature in which the  Treasurer  's Interest with them was so small as that whatever he could say to them on that Head was to very little Effect and for that Reason as likewise because he was willing to do nothing which should render Her Majesty uneasy or obstruct Her Service he gave them as little Obstruction as posssible  But as Men who agree but ill in the right Management of their Office are likely to agree worse with  themselves so the  Treasurer  had frequently his Hands full with the lesser Broils which they raised one among another and which either by their own Application or by Her Majesty's Order it was often made his Province to reconcile  It would take up much Time to speak of these Matters and especially of the Conduct of the  Secretary  then Mr  St John  before at and after his having the Dignity of the  Peerage  granted him by Her Majesty in which many are Witnesses to the Treatment the  Treasurer  receiv'd from the Passion of that Gentleman and his Friends as it relates to the Delay of his Advancement at first and his being ill satisfy'd with the Degree of it when granted The Particulars of which though Her Majesty's Conduct was so just and supported with such Reasons as could not but be submitted to by all his Friends yet were receiv'd by him with such Resentment at the  Treasurer  as it has not been usual for Men of like Station  to meet with or for Ministers of State to give to one another  It cannot be doubted but this Conduct as it obstructed the publick Affairs on one Hand so it expos'd them much on the other lessen'd the Esteem of the Persons as well as the Power of Her Majesty's Servants and brought the Administration into Contempt both at Home and Abroad and which was still worse exceedingly disturbed Her Majesty divided Her Esteem this Way or that as Her Majesty found to Day this Person to Morrow that acting up to or below the Duty of their Station distracted the publick Councils and oftentimes caus'd Her Majesty to shift Her Service out of one Hand and into another which gave much Dissatisfaction to the  Queen  in several things and Her Majesty failed not oftentimes to signify Her Displeasure at these things which it was much more easy for Her Majesty to do than to find a Remedy for them  This caus'd the  Treasurer  after things were brought to a length not to be otherwise accommodated and after he had in vain by long Letters as well as by frequent speaking to the other Persons prest them to a stricter and quieter Application to their Duty to represent these things to Her Majesty in the plainest and best Terms he could giving Her Majesty an Account of the distinct Circumstances She then stood in with reference to the said uneasy Persons as also of the Scituation of Her Affairs at that Time and how Her Administration then appear'd by their Management to be encumber'd with Difficulties not easy to get through but yet ending with proposing due Remedies for the Evils which attended it  It is true one of the best Remedies for the said Evils had been an Unanimity of Councils and adjoining all the  Queen  's Servants together in a strict Friendship to one another and a mutual Discharge of their Duty  to Her Majesty that each acting in their proper Sphere or particular Province with a clear and disinterested View to Her Majesty's Service might go on in a good Understanding with one another and a perfect Harmony of Desires for the publick Good and a just Subservience to Her Majesty's Pleasure  To this Purpose the  Treasurer  as well in his Letter to the Lord  Bolingbroke  as in several Papers and Schemes which he gave in by Her Majesty's Command to regulate these Mischiefs always adher'd to the first Opinion which he had profess'd in the Time of the former Administration and of which mention has been made  viz  That every Minister should confine himself to his especial Province concurring therein to the general Interest of the Sovereign and endeavouring always to lay before Her Majesty a true State of Her Affairs should then act with Subservience to Her Commands and in Concert with one another for Her Interest and Service This the  Treasurer  always back'd with just Representations of what was the particular Province of the Person he wrote to and not without earnestly pressing him to enter into just Measures for the Discharge of the Matters immediately before them and with Schemes for the carrying on the publick Business so as to make it easy to the  Queen  and to themselves  Instead of just Returns to these he was continually attack'd with Quarrels and Complaints new and private Schemes of their own some of which were form'd upon Principles that he could not in Duty comply with and upon his rejecting such Schemes but especially upon his prevailing with  Her Majesty  to enter so far into the redressing these things as to make a Nomination of Officers different from their Proposals by a Scheme of the  Treasurer  's upon thi  Step I say he was treated ever with Outrage nor could they be ever brought to any Rules or Mesures in Concert with the whole Ministry ever after till the  Treasurer  to his great Satisfaction withdraw  out of publick Business and obtain'd the Favour of  Her Majesty  to be dismiss'd from an Administration in which he had so little Influence as not to be able to do his Duty and yet so great an Unhappiness as to be charged with all the Mistakes which other Men made  The  Treasurer  cannot but think the timely Dismiss he receiv'd being the last Favour his Royal Mistress liv'd to do him was the most happy Turn from Heaven that befel him through the whole Course of his Life seeing it will testify for him in any Examination which may hereafter be made into these things that the Mistakes which may have been made in the Time of his Administration have happen'd rather from the Want of Power in him to prevent them than from his having the governing Influence in the Ministry as has been suggested that his Part of the Negotiations abroad has been rather to rectify what they had done amiss than to act by himself and that no irregular  Steps have been taken by him no unwarrantable Practices no evil Council given by him and that his only Misfortune next to his having been supposed to be the Author of evil Councils has been that he has not been able to prevent the Effects of them or to deliver the  Queen  from them whose Illness many cannot but still believe receiv'd not a little Encrease from the Trouble these things gave  Her Majesty  and the Grief of seeing the irreconcileable Clashings of Her Servants  But to go back to the Peace It seems in all the Speeches about the Transaction of that Affair the Objections lie rather against the Methods taken to bring it to pass than against the Illegality of the Ministers being employ'd to bring the War to an End which nevertheless seems to be the previous Question and here we find that the proper Enquiry was as to the  Treasurer  Whether he has acted legally in obeying the  Queen  's Commands or not If any of the Ministers with or without  his Knowledge and Consent enter'd upon Measures in carrying on the Treaty unjustifiable by the Laws of the Land their separate Management will questionless appear the plainer and the  Treasurer  when every Man shall answer for himself will still be the more openly vindicated from the Aspersion mention'd above of having the Direction of the whole Affair in himself  As  Her Majesty  found Reasons to resolve to put an End to the War Her Minister whether ther enter'd into  Her Majesty  's Reasons or not would find themselves oblig'd to enter into Her Measures for the bringing it to pass whether the Reasons which mov'd  Her Majesty  to this Resolution were Her own or were rais'd from the Counsel given to Her by any Person in whom  Her Majesty  repos'd so much Confidence as to be prevail'd with by their Advice whether  Her Majesty  was mov'd by the Tendency so natural to Her and the Compassion mov'd in Her Breast  by the Expence of the Blood of Her People some having said this was the first and only Motive but supposing it was by the Counsel of Her Servants from other Motives and be those Motives what they will it seems no Part of the present Defence of the late  Treasurer  unless there appear'd some Ground for a Charge upon him as being the Person who advis'd counsell'd or mov'd  Her Majesty  to it or to enter into any Measures with  France  for that Purpose which on the strictest View of all that yet appears in publick does not seem to be so much as pretended to  While then it remains unenquir'd into who first mov'd  Her Majesty  to enter into Measures for making a Peace and the  Queen  's undoubted Prerogative empower'd  Her Majesty  to enter into and finish Negotiations to that Purpose It seems that all the Enquiries into the Correspondence between  Her Majesty  's first Resolutions and the subsequent Measures will necessarily be plac'd to the Account  of such Intervention of Accidents as caus'd  Her Majesty  to change Her Thoughts and that the Ministry cannot justly be charged to bring to pass those Resolutions and those Changes by Way of Intriegue or with Design to carry on the Treaty with the more Disguise this would be to make the  Queen  's Servants guilty of betraying the  Queen  in the most infamous Manner and exposing the Honour of  Her Majesty  's Word in a most gross and unjustifiable Manner and if any such thing could be prov'd the  Treasurer  would have no other Work before him than to publish his Detestation of such Practices and wash his Hands of the Guilt  On the other Hand it is humbly conceiv'd That all such Expressions as are insisted on by some in the  Queen  's Letters Messages or Speeches to the Allies or their Ministers in which Her Majesty declar'd Her Resolution to carry on the War to make no separate Treaty to procure just Satisfaction to Her Allies  c  are to be expounded by the  Grand Alliance  and to be built upon the Supposition That Her Allies acted according to all their Engagements with  Her Majesty  in the said Alliance otherwise  Her Majesty  would be understood to oblige Herself to all that might be contain'd in those Expressions whether Her Allies continu'd to discharge their Part or no and in the Consequence of such an Opinion the  Queen  might at length be alone in the War under the literal Obligation of those Letters Speeches  c  But it was the Opinion of the  Queen  at that Time and of many of Her Servants That the Allies particularly the  States  and the  Emperor  had not done their Part in the War and had not discharg'd their Engagements to  Her Majesty  and even the Parliament themselves in the Representation of the  House of Commons  to the  Queen  Reference being had thereto did confirm that Opinion nay  Her Majesty  found that no Complaint from hence had the desir'd Effect  to oblige the said Powers to act in another Manner but were productive only of Memorials and Letters extenuating or justifying themselves and in these things are said more particularly to be form'd  Her Majesty  's first Resolutions  Nor was this a Transaction of that Day only it had been thus before And this  Her Majesty  had long been acquainted with in the Time of the Earl of  Godolphin  's Administration when as has been credibly said his Lordship having frequently pressed those Allies to perform the Conditions of the  Grand Alliance  and to furnish their  Quota's  and  Contingents  as by the several Conventions and Stipulations subsequent to the said Treaty of  Grand Alliance  they were oblig'd to do receiv'd for Answer more than once and that to  Her Majesty  's great Grief That their  State  was empoverish'd that they were able to do no more and that unless his Lordship meaning the then  Treasurer  would supply the extraordinary Charge they could not carry on the War  and must make their own Peace on the best Conditions they could or to this Effect If these things then were justifiable on the Part of any of  Her Majesty  's Allies they were much more to be defended on the Part of  Her Majesty  and Her Servants though they were led by these things in the Method they were to take with the same Allies even by a natural Return  Likewise in the Methods taken by some of the Allies to reject and render ineffectual the Treaty for a Peace when it was set on Foot at  Ʋtrecht  and to put an End to it by the Operations of the Campaign  Her Majesty  thought She saw so resolv'd a Combination not against a Peace only but even against a Treaty without enquiring whether it might have been concluded to Advantage or no which combination  Her Majesty  thought was not only inconsistent with but contrary to the express Declaration of the  States  of their being desirous of Peace that  Her Majesty  and likewise Her Servants were  of Opinion That  Her Majesty  was justly disengag'd from all that had been said promised or stipulated between them before and was not at Liberty only but bound by the strictest of all the Obligations which a good Prince could be bound by to provide for the Safety and Ease of Her own Subjects by a Peace whether in Conjunction with or separate from those Allies in the mean Time nevertheless providing as well as possible for the Satisfaction of all Her Allies if they thought fit to come into Her Measures for their own and the general Satisfaction  This may appear more especially from the Instructions given to his Grace the Duke of  Ormond  when he went over  General of Her Majesty  's  Forces  wherein his Grace's Orders begin thus  You are with all possible Diligence to repair to the  Hague  and to acquaint the  Pensionary  That having appointed you to command our Army in the  Netherlands  we have given you Orders  to see him before you go to put your self at the Head of the Troops You are to express to him the Resolution we are in of pressing the War with all possible Vigour until the Enemy shall agree to such Terms of Peace as may be safe and honourable for us and for our Allies  You are farther to say to this Minister That you are prepar'd to live in a perfect good Correspondence with all the Generals of the Allies and particularly with those of the  States  and that you hope you shall find the same Inclination on their Part to which his the  Pensionary  good Offices will extremely contribute You are after this Introduction to desire the  Pensionary  to inform you what Plan has been agreed upon for the Operations of the Campaign  The Duke it seem is of Opinion that when his Grace came to the  Hague  and pursuant to these Instructions communicated the  Queen  's Pleasure as well to the  Pensionary  as to the  Deputies  of the Council of State they declin'd him receiv'd the Proposals in a manner less obliging than  Her Majesty  thought She  had Reason to expect and it is evident that they refus'd to communicate their Measure to him but referr'd him to the Deputies in their Army as may be seen in the Account given to the Publick by his  Grace  in his Book Entitul'd  Vid pag or  The Couduct of the Duke of  Ormond  This Quotation is needful in order to state the Case as it then appear'd to  Her Majesty  's Servants at the Time when Proposals came over from  M de Torcy  in the King of  France  's Name in order to set on Foot a Negotiation for a Peace and which by the  Grand Alliance  Her Majesty was not prohibited receiving and consequently the Ministers could not be blam'd for receiving it in  Her Majesty  's Name if in the Pursuit of the Negotiations which have follow'd they have acted illegally that must appear upon due Examination and must lie upon those who it can be prov'd by good Evidence were guilty  The  Treasurer  's Part in these things can lie only in the general Transaction  viz  The approving of the entring upon the Treaty the particular Negotiation not being his Province except that his Share abovemention'd which seem'd to be rather the Necessity he found sometimes to rectify the Mistakes which some by their private Divisions and their other Practices had run themselves into than that he manag'd any Part of the Treaty But the whole Affair was transacted in the Council or by the  Secretary of State  or by the  Queen  through them both  Moreover it recurs back to what is observed before That such was the growing Breach among the  Queen  's Servants at this Time that not being in Terms of Peace with one another they were ill qualify'd to consult one another in the Affair of making Peace abroad it is hop'd for their Sakes they have made no Slips if it should be otherwise their Enemies will not fail to make their Advantage thereof But as to the  Treasurer  it is evident that as it was not his Province to correspond with the  Ministers  abroad so he is not to answer for those that did  It may seem strange that in carrying on this Account of the  Conduct of this Minister  who Fame has so often spoken of as at the Head of all Affairs it has not yet occurr'd to speak of the  Pretender  or so much as once to mention such a Person but that he seems to lie out of the Question as much as if there were no such Person in the World and this is the more wonderful because of the Pains which has been taken in the World to load the  Treasurer  with the Guilt of this among the rest and even to assure the World that this among other things would be prov'd upon him as clear as the Sun at Noon Day notwithstanding which some of his Enemies acknowledge now that even in all the Examinations into that Matter that they do not see that one Step in Favour of the  Pretender  can be prov'd upon him neither do we find yet that  those appointed to examine into it have charg'd him with any thing of that kind  The most which the Examinations which have been taken of that Matter seem to import amount to no more than this That some People in the Ministry knew of or conniv'd at his being permitted to reside in the Dominions of the Duke of  Lorrain  But all of them grant that in all the Negotiations they were strictly enjoin'd to insist upon his being oblig'd to quit the Dominions of  France  so that they do not pretend to any thing done in the Treaty in his Favour or of that kind that could be useful to his Design nor is it alledg'd that the Obligations laid on the  French  King not any Ways to aid or assist him or to admit his Return are not as full and as pungent as Words could express which Treaty therefore being so calculated to remove the  Pretender  from the Assistance of the  French  and from his Dominions seem'd to answer all the Ends of the  most fixed and resolv'd Enemies to his Interest not valuing whether he might think fit to go seeing if the  French  King kept his Word inviolably his near Residence in  Lorrain  would be of small Advantage to him and if otherwise his remoter Residence could have been no more Obstruction to him than the Difference of a few Days in his Journey when he should have been recall'd adding withal that at the remoter Distance of  Rome  or  Venice  he would with much greater Ease have remov'd without Notice and been able to have pass'd  incognito  whenever he had any Design so to do than he can do where he now is  So that on the whole As in the Treaty they took effectual Care to tie up the  French  King from giving any Assistance to the  Pretender  and put the Necessity upon him of banishing him for ever from his Dominions the  Queen  seem'd to have done all that was of Movement to be done and if any one conniv'd at the Place of his Residence in Favour  of his pretending to the Crown of  Great Britain  such an one was so far guilty of a trayterous Confederacy with the  Pretender  It is observ'd by some that the Affair of the  Pretender  was the Province of the Abbot  Gautier  who was a  French  Minister residing here during the Negotiations but it dose not yet appear or at least we do not find that any thing was transacted for him but what related to the Place where he should go and that so as he might not be surpriz'd by the  Emperor  and even this seems to have been left undecided and that the  Queen  afterwards finding it was the Occasion of Uneasiness among Her People did earnestly press to have him remov'd all which can afford but small Ground to suggest as is done That the  Ministry  had a reserv'd Design to make him King of  Britain  This however not at all affecting the  Treasurer  had not been mention'd in this Place but to remind  the Reader of the Injury the  Treasurer  receiv'd during the Time of these Negotiations as well as since in being openly reflected on as in the Interest of the  Pretender  whereas upon the narrowest Scrutiny it is believ'd it will appear that not one Step has been at any time taken by him or that the least Shadow of any thing will be found that looks like favouring that Person's Interest On the other Hand it is apparent That the  Treasurer  has all along been hated and malign'd by the  Jacobite  Party here as their greatest and most dangerous Enemy that they openly rejoic'd when he was dismiss'd from the high Station which he acted in before and that as soon as the first Division among the  Ministry  appear'd they eminently shew'd themselves against the  Treasurer  and in the Interest of the other which was a Testimony of the best kind  namely of the Enemy  in Behalf of the  Treasurer  and signified that if they had any Hopes of their Interest in any Side it was in those who were now opposing the  Treasurer  to the utmost These things if any thing will do it may open the Eyes of some Men to see the Injustice they have done to the  Treasurer  in these things and how injuriously he has been all along treated by them  The  Treasurer  standing in this Posture with respect to the  Ministry  at Home in cannot be suppos'd but that many things in the Transaction of the  Peace  were actually done not without his Consent only but that he entirely declin'd to intermeddle with those things which he did not approve It was no doubt the Duty of the  Plenipotentiaries  to leave such Articles as they could not legally adjust to the Parliament of  Great Britain  to ratify or reject and therefore the VIII and IX Articles of the Treaty of Commerce which related to the taking off of  Duties  on several  Merchandizes  imported could not be finally concluded or otherwise settled than by referring them to the Parliament by whom the several  Duties  being appropriated  to particular Purposes could alone be taken off But when these things came to be laid before the Parliament it seems it was Subject of great Complaint against the  Treasurer  that he was unwilling or declin'd to have the  Ministry  espouse the making those Articles effectual whereas it was the  Treasurer  's Opinion That the  Ministry  should entirely leave the Merchants to act as they thought fit and leave the House to act at the Merchants Requests and as their own Wisdome should direct them the  Ministry  standing entirely neuter  But this likewise he was overrul'd in and the rest of the  Ministers  thinking themselves oblig'd to support at Home what they had transacted Abroad brought in their whole Strength into the Debate and making it a Party Affair lost it in the  House of Commons  by that very Means and no other In all which Matter the  Treasurer  remain'd passive and unconcern'd though with this Injustice also on him  viz  That he suffer'd the Reproaches of the Whigs for espousing  the  Bill of Commerce  and of the other Part of the  Ministry  for not espousing it  It would be endless to go through the Detail of these particular Cases in which the Province of the  Treasurer  was no other than to bear infinite Calumny for those Follies which he had no Share in but had not Power to prevent and this made him frequently say That  he was out of Office near a Year before he was out of Place  and indeed for some of the last Months that he remain'd in the Place he had little to do in the publick Affairs but to complain of this injurious Usage  viz  That he was oblig'd to see things done that he could not approve of and then to hear them call'd his Doing  Under these Unhappinesses he became an humble Petitioner to  Her Majesty  either to deliver him from these Men or to dismiss him from the Service At first he prevail'd to their great Uneasiness to have a new Settlement of Great Officers made  which as he knew it overthrew the Schemes which the other People had laid so he had Hopes it would at length put the Affairs in a Course of Management as would retrieve the Confusion they were at that time in This was when  Her Majesty  appointed the Duke of  Shrewsbury  Lieutenant of  Ireland  Lord  Finlater  to be Chancellor of  Scotland  the Earl of  Marr  third Secretary of State Lord  Dartmouth  Lord Privy Seal and Mr  Bromley  Secretary of State in Lord  Dartmouth  's Room Sir  William Wyndham  Chancellor of the  Exchequer  and the Duke of  Ormond  to command in chief in  Britain  It is impossible to express the Outrage of the other Persons who now own'd they look'd but like a FACTION in the  Ministry  but gave out threatning Speeches plentifully that they would soon destroy this new Scheme The Trouble likewise which this gave to the  Queen  Herself cannot be spoken of without Grief especially when it must be remembered how near it was to that fatal Distemper  which remov'd  Her Majesty  to a Throne uncapable of such Perturbation and Dissatisfaction  It was not indeed very long e're  Her Majesty  perceiv'd that they would never cease attacking Her on these Heads and began something to yield to their Importunities which the  Treasurer  perceiving renew'd his Applications to  Her Majesty  to the same Purpose as before And in this Interval it was that he receiv'd  Her Majesty  's Command to lay before Her a true State of Her Affairs which Command he cheerfully obey'd in Hopes the doing so might either fortify  Her Majesty  's Resolutions in the Model of Administration lately enter'd upon or replace himself in that Recess from Business and from the Scandal of other Mens Mistakes which he so much desir'd  This Account the  Treasurer  laid before Her Majesty the  th  of  June  the Title whereof was as follows  A brief Account of publick Affairs since August the th to this present th of June To which is added The State of Affairs Abroad as they relate to this Kingdom with some humble Proposals for securing the future Tranquillity of Her Majesty's Reign and the Safety of Her Kingdoms  Together with this Account the  Treasurer  sent  Her Majesty  the following Letter and in a few Days after the  Queen  did him the Honor of granting his humble Petition  viz  of laying the  Staff  at  Her Majesty  's Feet The Letter as follows  May it please Your Majesty  I Presume in Obedience to Your Royal Commands to lay before Your Majesty a State of Your Affairs Though I have very much contracted it from the Draught I made and the Vouchers from  whence it is taken yet I find it swell under my Pen in Transcribing being willing to put every Thing before Your Majesty in the clearest Light my poor Understanding can attain to It was necessary to lay it before Your Majesty in the Series of Time from the Beginning to this present Time and when that is compleatly laid before You it remains only for me to beg God to direct Your Majesty  And as to my self do with me what You please place me either as a Figure or a Cypher displace me or replace me as that best serves Your Majesty's Occasions You shall ever find me with the utmost Devotion and without any Reserve  MADAM  Your most Dutiful most Faithful most Humble most Obedient Subject and Ʋnworthy Servant  OXFORD  Thus ended a troublesome Administration of a few Years in which the  Treasurer  may truly say He enjoy'd the Place but never could execute the Office and though it is true that he had all the Envy and bore the Weight of all the evil Conduct of other Men yet nothing can be truer than that they not only influenc'd the publick Affairs distinctly from him but that they carry'd every thing their own Way even over the Belly of the  Treasurer  and had the particular Direction of those things of which he had the Scandal for all their ill Management lies at his Door in the Esteem of his Enemies and is to this Hour improv'd to his Hurt as much as some  Men  are able  It was as has been said but a short while after this Representation to  Her Majesty  that the  Queen  thought fit to accept the  Treasurer  's Cession of the  Staff  a certain Evidence that their Influence had a prevailing Force with  Her Majesty  who would never else have consented to admit such  Men  into Her Administration who it had been prov'd had defrauded the Publick of above Pounds in Money but just before and who had so evidently been detected in that Fraud by him who  Her Majesty  suffer'd to lay down  From hence it is argu'd That the Knowledge of these things was one Reason why the  Queen  after the  Treasurer  was actually displaced had yet such a Prepossession against those  Men  that to their inexpressible  Mortification Her Majesty  gave the Office of  Lord Treasurer  to his Grace the Duke of  Shrewsbury  a Person in the last Scheme of the  Treasurer  and therefore hated mortally by the new Faction  so we must still call them  and a Person in whose Advancement they were more confounded than before  Had the  Queen  immediately entred into the  Measures of those Men  who perswaded Her to dismiss the  Treasurer  She would certainly have likewise receiv'd their Friends into such Places as they had determin'd for  them and then a few  Months  longer would have discover'd what they aimed at The  Treasurer  how ill an Opinion soever he had of their Capacity had nevertheless this Hope That they would not take any Step in Favour of the  Pretender  but always kept himself in Readiness to have detected them in the first Steps they should have made that Way  But  Her Majesty  's Distemper and Death intervening surpriz'd them all put an End to all their projected Schemes at once and among the rest had this one Unhappiness that it prevented the late  Treasurer  and depriv'd him of the Opportunity of convincing  Her Majesty  by the Consequences of the fatal Tendency of these Councils and how naturally they would embroil Her Affairs both at Home and Abroad  Upon the present Enquiries made by the Authority of Parliament into these Matters it seems that some of these Men have not Confidence enough in the Justice of their own Measures  to defend them in a Parliamentary Manner but have retir'd for the present whether it shall be constru'd to signify their pleading guilty to the Charge shall not be enter'd into here but certain it is that they must know the  Treasurer  may have something to say to them which they are not very well dispos'd to hear  The  Treasurer  not doubting the Justice of those who the Laws of this Nation have made Judges of these things  APPEARS  and manifests thereby his Readiness to cast his Life his Honour and his Fortunes upon the Honour and Impartiality of the Peerage of  Great Britain  as being assur'd that nothing shall be there laid upon him which cannot be fixt by the Testimony of good Witnesses and that he shall not be censur'd by their Lordships for those Transactions which have been the Work of other Hands and that he shall not only have full Scope given him for clearing up his Innocence in all the Points charged against him but likewise a  Liberty to bring to open View the Steps which have been taken by his Enemies not only towards the Ruin of their Country but also towards vindicating themselves by laying their own Crimes at his Door in which Defence no question not only all these things will be placed in a fuller and clearer Light but many other things be brought into View which have hitherto been either concealed or very ill understood  FINIS
