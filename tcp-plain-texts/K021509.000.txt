little and I'll ease you of your wares I'll warrant you Well thank Heaven we're arrived in a chearful country at last  looking about  Bless me What a charming air And what a charming appetite it gives one I have scarcely swallowed any thing but dust for these three weeks but here ends our tedious journeyYonder is the city of Messina and hard by resides the man my master is in search ofWhy my master has left Savoy to seek this interview with poor dead Julia's jealous husband I am yet to learnOh Here he comes  Enter  CARLOS  Carlos  At length Valoury the hurry of travelling is overyou now will have time to recover your fatigue  Valoury  Yes Signor Carlos and to lose my appetite I hope for the one is as irksome a companion as the other  Carlos  Would my distrestes could be as easily removed as yoursThe shade of my departed Julia haunts me at every turn and her injured memory calls aloud for vengeance  Valoury  Ah Sir if grief or resentment could restore her to life I'd starve myself into a passion with pleasure but as that is impossible might I advise you Signor I should recommend a temperate meal or two before we proceed any further  Carlos  Temperate Valoury can anguish insupportable be temperate Listen to the story of my heartThat Julia the hapless wife of the imperious Count Montoni whom thou saw'st interr'd at Palermo  Valoury  And a melancholy sight it was Signor CarlosI remember I was just sitting down to an excellent barbacue smoking hot when the procession passed the window but so it is whenever a man is upon the point of being happy some cursed thing or other always interferes to chill his prospects  Carlos  Think Valoury of an attachment begun almost in childhood and improved with growing years when love's soft wishes were sanctioned by reason and dear expectation nourished by consenting friends  Valoury  What then was the cause of your losing her  Carlos  Her father's avarice and ambition This proud indignant Lord the Count Montoni with large possessions and extended power was  captivated with my Julia's blooming charms and do I live to repeat it tore her from me in the moment when she was to have been mine for ever  Valoury  But how came the Lady to consent  Carlos  There thou hast touched the cord of anguish in my breast  that  drove me from my native home to seek in solitude a calm which alas Valoury thy master's heart can never more experience  that  brings me back again on the wings of rage and vengeance to demand atonement for wrongs too great to be endured  With great energy  Valoury  Bless me Sir Has any thing happened lately  Carlos  Yes from the amiable Constantia the only surviving sister of my hapless love I learn by papers found since her decease that the most infernal arts were put in practice by the Count and his adherents to bend the timid fair one to their cruel purpose  Valoury  Mercy on me My hair stands on end They hinted too at Palermo that the Lady's death was sudden and extraordinary  Carlos  By basest forgery she was induced to believe I had already been wedded to another  Valoury  To another indeed As if Gentlemen of your prudent turn of mind did not think one wife at a time quite sufficient  Carlos  But the hour of retribution is at hand meanwhile bear this letter to ConstantiaHer father old Fractioso is one of the Chief Magistrates in the city I would on no account that he should hear of my return therefore be careful to deliver it into her own hands  Valoury  Trust it to me Signor and Dad shall know no more of the business than an ExMinister does of the Cabinet or a fashionable husband of his wife's bedchamber  Carlos  From her you may learn tidings of my friend Hilario whose return from Germany I expect about this time and I know notwithstanding her father's obstinate prohibition Constantia is not insensible to his deserts  Valoury  And a charming Gentleman he is would he were herehis chearfulness would drive away your honour's melancholysorrow with him is like a bad Signet it squeezes the surface but leaves no impression  Sound of horns  Carlos  Hark Here come the Falconers with their Hawkswe must not be seen retirebe expeditious and meet me at the Hotel  Valoury  At the Hotelah Sir you need not doubt my expedition for sure no love sick girl in Europe can be more sharp set than is your honor's very hungry humble servant  Exeunt severally  Enter  MONTAUBAN  in a Falconer's dress with Hawks c  A train of Sportsmen all in shewy apparel with high plumes of feathers  SONG  MONTAUBAN  Heighlo Heighlo The morning is up  And the gallant Falconers abroad  We've each of us had a stirrupping cup  And of game we'll bring home a load  Uncouple the Spaniels and let the dogs try  See the Partridge there on the wing  Quick quick Jolly Falconer let the hawks fly  'Tis a pleasure fit for a king  Then mark the swift Hawksee him now make his stoop  Ah Down goes the game Call him in then La leup La leup  II  Barons of old and Princes so high  Loved Hawking as their lives  The health of the field and the Falconer's cry  Drown'd even the pipes of their wives  Our Hawks they are a Gallantie show  With rings and feathers so fine  The Falconer laughs at sports below  And cries "the air is mine"  What Sportsmen to joys then inferior wou'd stoop  When the summit of sporting is Hawking La leup La leup  Enter  COUNT MONTONI  Count  Montauban draw near thy activity and diligence are commendableare the Hawks strong and eager  Montauban  Well my Lordno doubt we shall have sport  Count  Methinks I shall not sport todaydismiss thy followers awhileI would confer with thee in private  The train go off  Montauban  How shall your vassal repay this condescension  Count  Thou know'st Annette I think Constantia's woman  Montauban  I do my Lord  Count  And toy'st with her occasionally  Montauban  The damsel has charms and I admire them nothing more  Count  I do not mean to chide thee gentle Montauban nor thwart thy amorous pursuits they may perchance enable thee to do me service  Montauban  O Let me fly to execute your commands  Count  Then thus it is I have reason to suspect that Constantia holds secret correspondence with Carlos my avowed and mortal foe the man who in life's childish thoughtless hour stole my wife's affections for whose sake she shun'd my embraces and notwithstanding her father forced her to be mine withheld from me a husband's lawful rights and died the sullen vestal she had lived  Montauban  You astonish me my Lord  Count  Exert thy influence with this forward waiting woman caress cajole do any thing thou canst to discover if possible these dark proceedings for know thy master's peace his fame his honor nay his life may be at stake  Montauban  Forbid it Heaven  Count  Hast thou seen Bernardo my trusty Steward lately  Montauban  Not these two days as I thinkhe seemed wrapt up in thought and deeply pensive  Count  Did he so I do not wonder at it for indeed I dread his presence  aside  He has done me signal service and I mean as suits my character and station to give him due reward  Montauban  Your Lordship's ever bountiful and good  Count  I thought to have met him herehe will not be tardy to attendI tremble at the interviewyet how avoid itit shall be so  aside  tho' Bernardo is deserving of my warmest gratitude  yet the load of obligation bears so hard upon my nature I cannot will not see him face to face till opportunity afford him ample recompence  Montauban  Such ever is the case with noble minds  Count  Do thou go forwardmeet him on the waygive him this ring as earnest of my friendshiptell him we shall meet anonmeanwhile he'll rest assured my favour shall go hand in hand with his desert to latest lifehaste thee good Montauban  Exit Montauban  Count  alone  Right glad I am this meeting is awhile delay'd for tho' I have gone too far to recede tho' injured pride and wounded honor demand from the offender due expiation and though I am certain Bernardo has used every precaution to secure us from discovery yet such are the weak workings of my mind there is a something which I cannot shake off that makes me shudder at the thought of seeing him  Going  Enter  CARLOS  Carlos  Pardon me Count Montoni if I thus intrude upon your privacy and dare to interrupt your progress  Count  Ha My detested rival  aside  I see you dare invade the privilege of decorum and intrude upon me like a lawless robber  Carlos  Spare your opprobrious epithetit recoils upon yourselfwho wa'st that robb'd me of my heart's best joy The lov'd companion of my early yearsthe allotted partner of my future life Who was't that basely practised on a timid female and in conjunction with a sordid parent led her  to pronounce unwilling vows and meanly triumphed o'er a forced consent  Count  I scorn your imputation and despise your vanity thus idle coxcombs when their schemes are baffled and the light froth that flatters giddy girls are in more ripen'd years seen through and slighted they know not how to bear their humbled pride but fly to falsehood and abuse for shelter  Carlos  Infamous evasion  Count  Golearn to check this habit of conceit learn to endure the freaks of female minds and condescend to think the gallant Carlos tho' in the zenith of his youth's career may sometimes suffer from a jilting mistress while men with less desert may prove more fortunate  Carlos  Your levity Count Montoni is contemptible and your insinuation ungenerous as unjustdid I not soon as I heard the gentle maid had yielded to your solicitation and as I then thought from worldly motives abandoned the heart she once had deigned to prize did I not tear myself from my friends my family my home quit the fond scenes where I had been so blest and with a bosom bleeding at every pore leave you to the uninterrupted enjoyment of your nuptial happiness  Count  Why then return to brave me unprovoked and interrupt domestic grief My wife is now no more you can no longer plume yourself upon her favour or attack the sacred honor of a husband  Carlos  Heaven grant me patience Must I then repeat the wrongs thou hast done me and sting thy hardened bosom with reproach  Count  Go onI'm proof against a ruffian's foul invective  Carlos  draws  Draw then and with thy sword defend what with thy tongue thou can'st not  Count  'Tis well I am prepar'd else had thy murderous intent been gratified  Drawing  Carlos  Base slanderer But words are useless I come not to remonstrate but to punish  Count  Have at thee then assassin as thou art  They fight  Enter  BERNARDO  Bernardo  What do I see My Lordmy Lordis this the method to secure your wishes  Count  Bernardo  sinks his sword  Then I must pauseno power on earth but thee could stay my arm  Carlos  I see you are now protected but mark me Count my justice shall not sleep till treachery like thine feel the resentment it deserves  Exit  Count  Speaking after him  Take my defiance with thee Bernardo thou art welcome Indeed thou art I did not think we should have met so soon  Bernardo  Not so soon my Lord I came hither by your own appointment  Count  True I sent a message to thee by Montauban but no matterthis rencontre has determined mewe have no time to loseI had some compunction but now rage and jealousy resume their sway  Bernardo  Let them not transport you too far  we have hitherto proceeded with discretion but caution still is necessary  Count  The funeral at Palermo will lull suspicion  Bernardo  No doubt my Lord it willbut this intruder Carlos must be guarded against  Count  Vile miscreant His officious return has fixed my wavering resolution and nerv'd my trembling handtonight at the castle let us meet  Bernardo  We will my Lord  Count  Provide thee a torcha spadethe dagger shall be mine  Bernardo  I shall not fail  Count  Gives him a casket  My trusty Bernardo take this casket it contains jewels that belonged towhat shall I term her They now are yoursI am resolvedOh love what art thou to revenge  Exeunt  SCENE II  A Room in  FRACTIOSO's  HouseLarge door in back SceneLarge window likewise with dressing table  c c  under it  Enter  FRACTIOSO  and  ANNETTE  Fractioso  Hah Whatwhenhowa

something to communicateWhat sort of a person is he  Annette  He looks like a servant  Fractioso  Ay an humble servant I suppose  Annette  Humble indeed I never saw a saucier fellow since I was born

I'll take care to damp his appetiteOh here he comesDo you Constantia stand at that end of the room  Enter  ANNETTE  and  VALOURY  gnawing a bone and walking up to  FRACTIOSO  in an impudent manner

underlings need stay for for I fancy I leave both knave and fool behind me  Bouncing out  Valoury shews the letter to Constantia as soon as she is gone so as not to be seen by Fractioso  Constantia  Advancing near  Now Sir let us draw near to him that we may not be overheard  Fractioso  Keep away childWhy shou'd we fear being overheardCome sirrah what have you to tell us  Valoury  trying in vain

dollarthe greatest coxcomb in all Messina  Valoury  And the most impudent dog in all Italyhe once gave me such a slap on the shoulder  Slaps Fractioso rudely on the shoulder and as he turns to resent it passes the letter to Constantia on the opposite side as he turns  Fractioso  Why rascal scoundrelhow dare you treat me with such familiarity  Valoury  I ask pardon It's a way I have I only meant to enforce my argumentbut I have donemy errand is completedmute as if your Honour was an underling  Exit  Fractioso  Get out of my house you impudent ragamuffin This fellow's coming here had certainly more meaning in it than I have been able to discover  aside  This is all your doing Madam HeadstrongOne daughter had the perverseness to die on purpose to plague me and you seem determined to live on the same system  Constantia  O Sir think on my poor sister's hard fate let that be a lesson to you Had she married the man of her choice she might now have been alive to thank you for it  Fractioso  The man of her choice What that pauper Carlos the intimate friend of the prating puppy Hilario that you would throw yourself away upon But I'll take care to prevent it Today you shall be lock'd up and

my daughter under lock and key  Annette  Not in that room I hope Sir for they say since poor Madam Julia's death evil spirits have walked there  Fractioso  Evil tongues have talked there more likelyGive me the key directly  Annette  I must change my ground  aside  To be sure Sir here it is  fumbling to get the key off  If a young Lady will be obstropolous why she ought to be locked up  Constantia  What are you against me too  Annette  'Tis every one's duty to be against you when you run headlong to destruction Shall I open the door Sir  Fractioso  Ay do child I see you are a good sensible girl and more discreet than I thought you  Annette  The very words my grandmother used to make use of poor old woman Your honor always puts me in mind of her  trying the key  Fecks I believe the keyhole is stopt up  Fractioso  Stopt is it Well go and look for something to clear itYou'll find a file Annette in the breakfast chamberNonow I think of it I'll go myself for the teachest was

I can open the door now Miss Constantia will you take a peep at your prison  Constantia  Are you really what you seem Annette  Annette  I follow the way of the world ma'am but dont mind a little confinement it's only a prelude to matrimonylook in and see if there are any spirits  Opens the door and  HILARIO  comes out in a travelling cap  CONSTANTIA  screams  Hilario  Am I so frightful then my dearest Constantia Does this travelling equipage make me look like an hobgoblin  Constantia  In the name of wonder when did you arrive  Hilario  Not an hour agoI passed thro' Italy on a gallopcrossed the bay in a storm landed at the quay in a whirlwind and flew like lightning to visit my adorable without waiting for my toilette as you see though many a trim barber eyed me wishfully as I scoured along the street as who should say "would I might take your worship by the nose"  Constantia  But how Hilario did you gain admittance  Hilario  By the assistance of this my better angel she that pretended to take your father's part  Annette  Yes Ma'am I always take the blind side and so I'll fasten the door on the inside  Bolts the Stagedoor  Constantia  But Hilario my friend it will be impossible for you to continue here  Hilario  But Constantia my love it will be impossible for me to continue any where else  Constantia  Will you listen to me  Hilario  For ever so you don't desire me to leave you after having scampered across the Continent  like a greyhound it were hard to be turned out like a mongrel besides it would be so ungrateful to your indulgent papa who has thus kindly left us together  Constantia  Mark what poor Carlos writes  reads  "I am returned to Messina for the sole purpose of avenging my Julia's deathshould you see Hilario tell him I am desperate and may stand in need of his assistance"  Hilario  A very pretty summons Because he's desperate he supposes I must be mad and you my Constantia in return for the hole you have made in my heart want to have a bullet popt thro' my noddle  Constantia  Unkind Hilario You know the sincerity of my character though fully tinctured with my sex's levity I am above the little artifices which they generally adoptnotwithstanding your eccentricities I am convinced of the goodness of your nature and believe me it possesses all my esteem  Hilario  For that dear confession let me but touch the tip of the nail of your forefinger  kissing her hand  and command me all over the world  Constantia  Fly then to your friendconjure him to relinquish his designstell him my sister's wrongs are buried with her in the grave and say his interference may renew our sorrows never can redress them  Hilario  I fly at your desire  going to the door  but holdI believe I must fly through the keyhole for Daddy Cautious has double lock'd the  prison  noisewithout  Zounds somebody is at the door  Fractioso  without  Constantia Annette  Annette  As I live it is the old one again What shall we do If you return into the other room he'll search it and we must let him into thisfor heaven's sake Sir get up the chimney or out of the window  Hilario  Then another old one that you may have heard of must assist medo you think I can climb like a squirrel or fall upon my legs like a cat  Fractioso  Annette open the door  Hilario  Do as he tells you and rely upon me if I can't tumble out of window I can tumble in which will be a much safer experiment only prepare yourselves with a good scream to honor my entree  Fractioso  Annette I tell you open the door  Annette  Coming Sirmy Lady and I have been taking a little nap  As just awaked  Hilario opens the window then puts his leg out as if mounted on a ladder affecting drunkenness and speaking to persons in the street  Hilario  Take away the ladder my boysI have done with you  Annette opens the bolt of the door and just as Fractioso enters Hilario tumbles from the window into the room oversetting the dressing table c  getting up  Here I am old trustyI was determined to make you a visit and finding your doors lock'd against me I made bold to come in at the window  Fractioso  That wicked dog Hilario Oh you villain I'll have you laid by the heels that I will  Hilario  That's right father take care of my heelsyou see I have taken care of my head already  Fractioso  You're a housebreakeryou want to plunder my property and run away with my child  Hilario  Damn your propertyI'll have none of it and as for your sweet child I adore her and you too old surlyI'll adore you too  Taking hold of him  Fractioso  Help Help He will murder me and ruin the women Constantia why don't you run for assistance  Constantia  Lord Sir there's no occasion to be in such a panicit's only a drunken frolic I dare say the gentleman will do us no harm  Fractioso  mimicking her  I dare say you'll think it no harm let the gentleman do what he will  Annette  Right Sirthere your honour put me in mind of my poor old grandmother again  Fractioso  And this is the fellow you wou'd give me for a soninlaw  Hilario  Yes I am he HolofernesI am the Very fellowCome give us your blessing old boy and who knows but in good time you may have a supply of young ones

out and drives him off  Fractioso  Murder I shall be suffocated Help to turn him out  returns and adjusts himself  Mercy on me There is no security for one either at home or abroadAll the bolts in the world can't keep a forward girl in the house or hankering fellow out of it  Constantia  Dear papa you do not indeed you do not pursue the right method to secure my duty or your own peace Would parents treat their children as friends instead of keeping them at a severe distance the social communication of each  other's sentiments would enable one party to give better advice and induce the other more readily to accept it  TRIO  Annette  Trust to me  Constantia  Depend on me  We'll your confidence reward  Anentte  Lock and keyno hold can be  Both  Honor is the surest guard  Fractioso  Safer still

where'er they go  Fractioso  Must distract where'er they go  SCENE III  The outside of an old Castle with large gates closed a turret door is visible in the interior of the Castlea hole in the wall that appears to lead to a subterraneous passageThe whole wears an appearance of great antiquity and ruins  Enter  CLODDY  with a quantity of hares patridges c  Cloddy  Well done Cloddy Thee didsn't lay thy snares last night for nothingBy the dickens here's as pretty a bunch of preserved property as any justice would wish to see at his table and a  pretty round sum it will bring me when I ha' got it safe housedfor our old rich citizens do so like a titbit especially when it is prohibitedand why should they not They call me a poacher mayhap so I bewhat thenso be other people Its my belief as how its a pretty general trade  SONG  CLODDY  In poaching all mankind delight  Late and early  Prizing dearly  Every scheme by day or night  To wiredraw one another  Friends to trap the wit will try  He tips the wink and cocks his eye  And while he looks so woundy sly  Makes game e'en of his brother  Smoke the joke  What fool so dull  Always grinning  Mouthing chinning  Let us quiz  His ugly phiz  Giggling whilst he's grinning  See Miss and Madam lay their snares  Painted faces  Studied graces  All for catching unawares  Flights of gamesome lovers  Madam plays the Harpsicols  And squalls affected rigmarols  While Miss in dancing reels and drolls  New steps fer lures discovers  Head and tail  Along she'll sail  Down the middle  Turn and sidle  With a hitch and capering itch  To the true Scotch fiddle  Od so Here's somebody coming I must run into my old hiding place yonderthat hole under the Castle wallit has used to be a rare snug place but o' late I ha' heard so many strange noises near about I fear there be other people hiding as well as myselfrabbit it here they come  Retreats into a hole under the wall  Enter  CARLOS  and  HILARIO  Carlos  So my poor friend after the father had generously locked you into his daughter's apartmenthe cooly turned you neck and heels out of his own street door  Hilario  Faith something very like it or notwithstanding my attachment to your person my love for another person's person would have made me a truant to friendship  Carlos  Impossible  Hilario  Impossible is it that a man should prefer being safe in a warm house playing bopeep with the bright eyes of his mistress to scampering across a cold country for a game at pistols with his friend's rival  Carlos  Notwithstanding your pleasantry I am convinced you would go a great way to serve me  Hilario  Yes and not a little way to serve myselfyour kindnesses to me and our early  friendship will I trust never be forgottenyou certainly stand secondthat is after the ladies in my accountbut I myself am at the top of the page and you know its the fashion now to take care of number  One  Carlos  True my friend and number  One  is at present tolerably secureI have already had a rencontre with this dread adversary  Hilario  Already I hope you are not wounded  Carlos  Sorely  Hilario  Bless me Carlos Where is it  Carlos  In the heart Hilariodeepincurablea surgeon's skilful hand may ease the poniard's stroketime's healing finger is ineffectual here  Hilario  I am sorry for it How much kinder the old greybeard is to meas he totters round me with a grin I whip his scythe from his hand and cut off my sorrows in the middle  Carlos  Enviable vivacity Had not relendess fortune mark'd me for the child of woe I might have shared in all your chearfulness  Hilario  My dear friend take comfortlet us return to the citythese desolate old ruins don't seem to promise much entertainment they've made me grave already  Carlos  To me the world is all a voidJulia my once destined Julia's lost for ever  As they go out a bell tolls in the Castle  Whence came that dismal sound  Hilario  From that dismal castle I supposelet us begonethe toll of a bell always makes me nervous  Carlos  I thought this dreary spot had been uninhabitedwho could have occasioned it  Hilario  Who Gaffer Belzebub to be sure who the devil else would live in such a placeI shall retirehe's not fit company for me  Carlos  Perhaps it is some person in distress some lonely hermit sinking beneath the pressure of disease  Hilario  Or perhaps some robber who having  tenderly  murdered the lonely hermit  kindly  resolves to give him christian burial  Bell tolls again  Carlos  AgainI am resolved to see further into this business  Hilario  And I am determined to remain totally in the darkCarlos I'm off  Carlos  Will you leave me Hilario Can you desert your friend  Hilario  What did you say Desert you neverI may be at times a little  apprehensive  but I never can forsake my friendwas the whole court of Lucifer armed against my Carlos dam'me but I'd have a tustle with some of the cloven blacklegs  Carlos  Come thensuppose we try whether these antique gates will yield to our attack  Hilario  Move onif the worst comes to the worst it will be only bringing an old house about our earsit won't doold Ebony has fastened them with his own claw  Trying to open them  Carlos  going towards the place where Cloddy is  Let us search narrowly round the mouldering walls time may perhaps have made some opening in them  a light appears  Softlydost thou observe a light in yonder turret  Hilario  alarmed  A light To be sure I did  the devils are at workI think we had better leave them to themselves  Carlos  observing the light  Mark It moves alongnow it disappears  Hilario  I'm glad of itwe've seen enough however don't be afraidI'll stick close by you  Carlos  discovering Cloddy  Here is actually a hole seemingly under the wall who knows but it may afford a passage into the castleHeavens something living is concealed in it  Hilario  Be upon your guard Carlosdon't venture init may be a wolf or a tiger  Carlos  bringing out Cloddy  Then it must be a man tiger However be it what it may I'll drag it forthShew thyself fellow and say what brings thee here  Cloddy  Brings me here Why ise only fetching a walk  Hilario  Fetching a walk What in a hole in the wall Zounds

be that  Carlos  Does any body live there Answer this minute or it shall be your last  Cloddy  alarmed  O lud O lud Noa Nobody lives there but the rooks and ravens To be sure they ha'had some visitors lately and by their cawing and croaking I dont think they much like their company  Carlos  What company are you talking of  Cloddy  Why spirits and hobgoblins I believe for I never heard such shrieking and squeaking in all my born days  Hilario  Shrieking and squeaking Hadn't we better get more assistance Carlos  Carlos  What avails human assistance if we are to encounter supernatural foes Did you ever see as well as hear any thing extraordinary  Cloddy  Yes one night when I was taking a walk  Hilario  What walking again friend Well what did you see  Cloddy  Why I feed a light in the South tower and soon after a sort of a kind of an apparition appeared and when I cried out it called me fool  Hilario  Ay claim'd relationship  Carlos  What was it like  Cloddy  Therelook there it be again  A person with a dark lanthorn muffled up looks out from a turretwindow and then retires shutting the window  Carlos  Something mysterious is certainly going onI am determined to unravel it  Hilario  I hate mysteries confoundedly However I dont speak because I want to flinchBut it is so ill bred to pry into family secrets  Sound of bugle horns  Carlos  Somebody is approachingWe have no time to lose  Cloddy  Its Master Montauban with the sportsmenI must be off  Carlos  Off fellowfor what reason who are you  Cloddy  I be Cloddy own brother to sister Annette and she be the same to me  Hilario  How brother to my Guardianangel Come to my arms my ally from the hole in the wallAnnette assisted me and therefore you and I will fetch a walk together  Cloddy  Wounds An'you be sister's friend I'll do any thing you like and if you want to peep into that old castle I believe I can shew you a way under the wall but you must stoop very low and mayhap creep upon allfours  Carlos  No matterpoint out the pathnothing can deter us  Horns again  Time presses awayaway  Hilario  I wish with all my soul we were fifty leagues away from this place  Exit thro' the hole in the wall  Enter  MONTAUBAN  and  SPORTSMEN  GLEE  What shall he have who sported best  A shout of joy from all the rest  The honest heart no doubts will start  But join the strain before we part  The Horn the Horn the echoing Horn  Shall rouse the Sportsmen ev'ry morn  On you the palm will fall Sir  No not on one but all Sir  Huzza Huzza  The loud Huzza  Now sends us all content away  END OF ACT I  ACT II  SCENE I  An old room hung with antique tattered tapestrytwo doors exactly alike in the back scene covered with the same tapestryA window over them the stage to be a little darken'd  Enter the  COUNT  muffled in a cloak and  BERNARDO  Count  At length my friend the hour of retribution comes and love insulted claims its sacrificethe time the place occasionall conspire while secrecy secures revenge  Bernardo  Would I could say ought to stay your purpose  Count  Impossible 'tis now too lateIs not this favour'd rival come to vaunt his valour Shall we restore the idol of his panting heart and be ourselves the victims of his triumph  Bernardo  Never my lordher destiny is fix'd  Count  Yet spite of the rage which fires an injur'd husband's breast resisted pity will at times intrudefear too appals and dread remorse the very figures fashion'd in these antient hangings with ghastly eyeball seem to frown upon us  Bernardo  Weak imagery of the brain which quick decision must effacetrust me my Lord we have little leisure to deliberate  Count  What mean'st thou Bernardo  Bernardo  Not an hour ago waiting as is my duty for your Lordship's presence a deep ton'd  bell fixed unknown to me in the interior of the Castle was on a sudden by our mourner sounded  Count  Indeed  Bernardo  At first I thought 'twas fancy but being repeated I flew to trace the cause and instant cut the rope  Count  'Twas well  Bernardo  Soon after the outward gates were by rude hands attempted to be forced  Count  Thou alarm'st me  Bernardo  With speed I mounted to the turret and descried some strangers in close conference  Count  Didst thou know them  Bernardo  The day declining prevented more discoveryThe sportsmen returning from the field forced them to retire  Count  Who could they be No matterapprehension will but prompt our purposeher doom's inevitablebut thenthe remains  Bernardo  All is preparedthe coffin is at hand  Count  agitated  So ready BernardoYet wherefore delaydanger may

my Lord as quick as the dark windings of this dreary mansion will permit me  Exit  Count  alone  The night advances fast wherefore this inward pang this struggle of nature Come wounded pride love slighted scornedcome suffering honour aid this weak heart  and give it manly resolutionhush was not that a sigh a deepened sigh How soon the last must follow let me seize this solitary interval to take one final look silent unobservedalas the dim light that glooms around scarce shews the dismal path  Exit thro' door  Enter  CARLOS  with a dark lanthorn and  HILLARIO  with a broken piece of a shieldthey ascend from a cavern  Hilario  Carlos Carlos Carlos softlyyou go too fastthank heaven at last we have emerged from that horrid cavernzounds I am as damp as a new newspaper and as musty as old cheese out of a wine cellar  Carlos  In truth Hilario it is somewhat surprising after the extraordinary occurrences without the walls of this old castle we should as yet be able to make no discoveries within a solemn silence seems to reign around and nothing save the hollow murmur of the wind strikes on the listening ear  Hilario  A murmur of another kind struck upon my ear  Carlos  What mean you  Hilario  You shall hearbut come a little further from that cursed cavern you know after having trampt about these diabolical apartments for half an hour together we agreed to separate at the end of a long gallery and took different routs  Carlos  We did soand the distant glimmer of light from this lanthorn which I found standing on the pavement led me to the dismal recess where we again metbut proceed  Hilario  The fact is that old Ebony has been more attentive to me than to your worship  Carlos  Will you be serious one moment  Hilario  Serious upon my soul I don't think I shall ever be otherwise I am terrified to death I cou'd as soon raise the devil as a grin  Carlos  Torture me not with suspensebut tell me all  Hilario  That I will if I can find breath to go thro' with itfirst I descended several steps of a dark narrow passageat the bottom I heard a door open then the patting of a man's foot whether cloven or not I can't saysoon after I saw a light so I made a pause and said to myself now dont be frightened Hilarionow dont tremble my dear fellow but summon up all your courage and boldly run away  Carlos  Would I had been there instead of you  Hilario  Would you had with all my heart tho' I defy you to run fasterbut in the attempt I fell plump on my face and in scrambling to get up I clawed hold of this broken bit of a shield There seems something like letters scratch'd upon it  Carlos  Letters Hilario Try then to decypher them  Hilario  gives him the Shield  No try yourself I have got such a mumbling in my mouth and my teeth so chatter that  Carlos  Heavens what's this I see  reads  "Julia wife to the Count ofwas forced to this Castlethe marble hallthe dreary vaultOh pity and remember"  drops the shield  'tis the labour of my Julia's  hand the unavailing record of her hapless fate Oh my foreboding heart she has been murdered  Hilario  I'm all over in a cold perspiration we had better get into the open airit may save us from a fit of the agueI feel die quaking already  Carlos  Never will I quit this gloomy edifice till I discover my poor Julia's sad remains dreadful ideathe mangled relicks of her beauteous form  Hilario  Dreadful indeed who knows but our forms may be mangled in the same manner  Carlos  Was it for this I left my friends my home To abandon the dear object of my earliest vows to coward fraud and ruffian violence Gods I shall run distracted  Hilario  Be advised Carloslet us retire  Carlos  not attending to him  No faithful monitor to warn her unsuspecting youthno arm to shield her helpless innocenceheh what noise was that  Hilario  What the perspiration is coming again  Carlos  It sounded like a groan  Hilario  Dear Sir dont frighten one more than there is occasion  Carlos  Mark meobserve that windowdo

and buried a Coffin  shuts door  and I dare say the sexton will be here before I can say my pray'rs mum here he comes  a stamping without  Enter  BERNARDO  with a spade and dagger  Bernardo  calling in a low voice  Count Count  Hilario  He mistakes me for somebody else  Bernardo  Your excellence  Hilario  Its an excellent mistake however  Bernardo  Where are you  Hilario  in a feigned low voice  Heere  Bernardo  I have brought the spade and dagger as you ordered  Hilario  Give them to me  Bernardo  putting one in each hand  You feel cold  Hilario  Yesits so hot  Bernardo  Hot its a dreadful nightbut all will soon be over I'll enter the recess the back way and lead the victim down the steps into the marble hall'tis yours to give the blow  Hilario  I will I will  Bernardo  Till then farewell  Exit  Hilario  the spade in one hand the dagger in the other  Give the blow gad if I dont take great care I shall get the blow I shiver from head to heel like a topsail in a storm This murderloving villian has kindly indulged me with two instruments one to kill myself with and the other to dig my own grave  Enter  COUNT  Count  Bernardo why do you loiter so Is this a time for delay what silent do you shrink at last Give me the meansI'll do the rest myself faithless coward  Snatches the dagger and goes out  Hilario  solus  Faithless coward aye so it seems else shou'd I leave poor

dozen lacqueys at my back with a flambeau in each hand If a man must be executed I think the more parade the better  Exit thro' door  SCENE III  A large antique hall with black marble pillars on each side distant from the wingsan open arch at the back discovering a stone staircase leading from an upper appartment  Enter  COUNT  with dagger  Count  What could Bernardo mean He seem'd fix'd and motionless He will not sure betray  me impossible  a noise of opening locks  hark the door openshe leads her downthe dreadful scene approachesI'll conceal myself awhile  Retires behind pillars  Bernardo with a lighted torch in his hand leads Julia down the staircase into the marble hall  Bernardo  My duty is discharg'dlady I take my leave  Julia  Oh Bernardo do not leave me thus tho' in the lone recess where I have been so long confined without one succouring friend to cheer my solitude tho' when you daily brought my scanty pittance a gloomy silence mark'd your short'ned stay now I conjure you grant my last request ere suffering nature sink to long oblivion say why am I now brought sorth  Bernardo  I but obey the mandate of my lord your husband  Julia  My husband say my tyrant murderer  Bernardo  I must not listen to such epithets  Julia  Did he not under pretence of riding for my health entice me to this sequestered spot attended only by yourself Did he not on a sudden force me from my horse drag me thro' various dark apartments and lodge me in that vaulted room from whence you now have led me  Bernardo  Lady he is here  Exit returns  Julia  calling after him  Oh stayprotect medo not abandon a poor helpless female to such detested hands  Count  advancing the dagger concealed  'Tis well MadamI see your haughty spirit still continuessoftness might have subdued my feeble  natureand woman's tears might have produced a womanish compassion  Julia  Fear not ferocious manno tears can soften thy obdurate heart nor will compassion find a votary there  Count  Once again I'll deign to ask what punishment you think your conduct merits  Julia  Talk'st thou of conduct can'st thou mention wrongs Thou who hast injured me beyond descriptionstabbed my fair fame robbed

doom'd his child to misery and death  Count  Art thou then prepared  Julia  If innocence and purity of mind be preparation then am I ready If with a heart susceptible  of every soft emotion to have lavished all the tenderness of growing years on one whom I am taught to think unworthy whilst a hated tyrant holds me at his disposal be the height of human woe then is the grave my only refuge  Count  To make that grave more welcome know illfated fair thy minion was not false  Julia  exclaiming  Not false not wedded to another  Count  Nodevoted but to thee he wanders o'er the earth a wretched exile  Julia  You have pierced me to the soulnow draw thy murderous steelthou can'st not wound me more  Count  To save you from a disgraceful union I plann'd this honest artificeto save myself from

conscience to the rage of disappointed maliceCarlos you have saved my life now protect my fameconduct me to my father's housethere alone my harrass'd mind can be at peace  Carlos  Forgive the impetuosity of a man torn  with contending passionsagitated at once by love resentment by hope and by despairyour fame has ever been dearer to me than my own let us then quit this scene of horror and restore my injur'd Julia to her paternal roof  Julia  Attempt not Carlos to accompany me homeyou know how much my father is incensed against youshould we be seen together 'twill give such colour to the Count's calumny as may prove injurious to us bothfor the whole story will so crowd upon his mind  Hilario  Egad so it willthen the tables may be turn'd upon us and Ebony make us appear as black as himselfnow leave every thing to me Fractioso and allI am the man for the old one if Lady Julia will trust herself to my care I'll undertake to convey her unseen to the apartment of her sister my adored Constantia and then we can manage her return to life with all proper decorum  Julia  Lead on  Carlos  Must we then part so soon Oh Julia form'd for the enjoyment of social tenderness my heart is doom'd to suffer unceasing disappointment At least let me conduct you safely thro' the arched vaults and narrow passages that fill this melancholy pilethen will I pursue the guilty Count and consign him to the vengeance of offended laws  Julia  Take with thee Carlos all the love I dare to offer every anxious with I freely can bestow  Hilario  And as you don't want any of my courage I'll take it all with me to guard my precious chargeand then fire and tow let me  see who will dare to come within arm's length of us  Carlos  What is to be done with the owner of your trophy there  Hilario  Ay the rascal in the poundwe must take him with us and secure his evidence by promise of pardon  Carlos  But notwithstanding your  courage  Hilario 'twill be as prudent to have some officers of justice to assist us  Hilario  Certainlyfor the most dauntless spirit may be sometimes seized with a cold perspirationbut never mindmove onI'll lead the way  brandishing his sword  follow close if you please tho' and we shall sooner be out of this cursed old den of Philistines  Exit  SCENE IV  A  ROOM  in  FRACTIOSO's HOUSE  Enter  ANNETTE  hastily  Annette  Where can my young Lady be gone I have search'd for her all over the houseshe must certainly have gone abroadand she may thank me for the opportunityhow astonish'd she will be when she knows what I have overheard I must say my talent for listening has been of great service to me in life and has help'd me to unravel a number of mysteries  SONG  A sweet scented courtier once gave me a kiss  And promised me mountains if I would be his  But soon I found courtiers were callous to shame  And mountains and molehills with them were the same  TO BE SPOKEN  For that very night when I was at my favourite amusement listening I heard a rustling of silks upon the staircase there was my spark making love to my Lady's maid rigged out in an old cast off of her mistresses so  Soon I found courtiers were callous c  II  A widow whose tears were unceasingly shed  For her spouse her protector her all that was dead  Made me wonder the dame should such sorrow survive  Till I found that she had a kind cousin alive  TO BE SPOKEN  For calling one day with some bombazeen to renew her weeds with I overheard a parley in the back drawing room  "come widow don't carry on this farce any longer its troublesome to be squeezing out tears from morning to night marry me at once you know my meritI managed your late husband's business the last five years of his life"  No longer I wonder'd the dame should survive  When I found that she had a kind cousin alive  III  A maiden of sixty so pure and so prim  As tall as a maypole and nearly as slim  Protested her pleasures in life were all o'er  At length I perceived she'd one comfort in store  TO BE SPOKEN  For being invited to a snug dish of tea and a little scandal I chanced to go somewhat sooner than I was expected and passing her chamber I heard the corner cupboard unlock and the following soliloquy  "Come to my heart my best supporter man faithless man has slighted and deceived me you are the only warm friend I have"  So I plainly perceived tho' laid flat on the floor  Life still has one comfort for maids of three score  Enter  CONSTANTIA  Constantia  Annette what can have detained Hilario so long  Annette  What can have detained you so long I have something to tell you of the utmost importance  Constantia  What mean you For heav'n's sake be explicithas any thing happened to him  Annette  Yes Ma'amto him and to her and to me and to all the world  Constantia  If you

do you find delight in torturing your unhappy mistress  Annette  I torture you my dear young Lady I had rather torment a dozen lovers from morning till night than give you one moment's uneasiness but I am so confounded and so overjoyed and so perplexed and so  Constantia  What can be the matter  Annette  Why then as I hope for one husband at least I have some reason to think that my Lady Julia is not dead  Constantia  How My sister alive  Annette  You shall hearjust now as I was standing in the passage thinking of nothing and peeping as I now and then do in a little pocket looking glass who should whisk by me but the Count Montoni  Constantia  What of him  Annette  He look'd alarm'd and confused and I am convinced he didn't know what he was about  Constantia  Why so  Annette  Because he took no more notice of me than if I had been the meerest dowdy in all Messinaso I was determined to go and listen at the door of your father's library where they were lock'd up together  Constantia  Well  Annette  At first I heard some muttering about an old Castle and then the words  "Carlos and murder"  Constantia  "Carlos and murder"  Alas my poor Hilario no wonder you are not returned  Anette  Don't be uneasy MadamI am certain no mischief has happened for I heard the old Gentleman exclaim  "Julia not dead then Carlos must be laid hold of"  and so Ma'am I ran to acquaint you with the news  Constantia  If you love me Annette steal softly back again and try if you can discover any thing further  Annette  I will my dear Ladylistening is my forteand for sounds shew me who has a finer ear than myself  Exit  Constantia  My sister still living Can it be possible Some dreadful mystery remains to be discoveredoh Julia how deplorable must have been your situation  SONG  CONSTANTIA  In the cup of female life  Pleasure swims precarious  Ah Welladay  Every draught to maid or wife  Flows with sorrows various  Ah Lackaday  Fear our infant peace destroys  Cold restraint our youth annoys

alivethat the great burial was all a flam and that she was found secreted in an old castle under the protection of Signor Carlos her first lover who he says aided by Constantia and Hilario were the authors of the whole contrivance  Cloddy  Odratten I don't believe itI believe that black dog I used to see on the parapet was the real poacher he and the Count depend on't were the knaves that laid the snares  Annette  So I thinkand therefore I have ventured abroad this dark night at my lady's desire in hopes I may be able to see Madam Julia who they say is still at the castle and give her intelligence of the plots that are carrying on against her at this moment  Cloddy  Oh Ho So then I find your great folks can carry on their plots in the dark as well as us little ones  Annette  Yes the old Gentleman at the instigation of the Count has summoned the city guard to their assistance and ordered the gallies to row round the lighthouse in case Carlos and his friend should put off to sea for he has resolved this very night to arrest and convey them to prison Come with me brotherthere is not a moment to lose  Noise without  Cloddy  Nonor a moment to find neither for here are the

consider itbut I cant help saying I wish it could be supported in broad day with a warm sun over our headsnothing can be so dreadful as the shrieking of owls and the croaking of frogs when one must climb battlements and dive into caverns  Count  Undoubtedlyand unless fame and property were at stake  Fractioso  There it iswas it not for one's property I should not much care  Count  Who knows to what lengths the conspirators may godetection may make them desperate  Fractioso  Zounds so it maythat rascal Hilario is one of the gang I warrantHe's a most desperate dog believe me  Count  No doubt he is  Fractioso  That fellow and his friend Carlos have been my torment these five years on and off They come in at a window to one daughter and lock another up in a Castlelook ye Count I can't say I ever doubted you and now I am convinced that Constantia Carlos Juliathat damn'd Hilario and all of them have joined in a conspiracy to rob and murder usfor if they bring dead people to life they can

move off there's more room for the young to move on that's my comfort  Enter six soldiers  HILARIO  as one in uniform with large mustachios  Hilario  Stay my sweetmy dear comrades don't leave me here in the cold  Serjeant  Peace you ungrateful varletwas'nt it at your own request and thro' the interest of good Montauban that your punishment of being a galleyslave for life was remitted on condition of your serving as a soldier and now would you still grumble  Hilario  I tell you I dont understand the exercise  Serjeant  Don't you then we'll teach it you comeproceed  They go thro' the ceremony of relieving guard Hilario does it awkwardly and is left as Centinel on duty  Serjeant  going  At your peril quit your post  Exit with soldiers  Hilario  solus  Now don't I cut a pretty figure whiskered up to the eyes like a turk and loaded with arms like a baggage waggonIf I stay I shall be flogged for not knowing my duty Suppose I run awayno I'll be  shot  if I doI know the worst on'tto submit like my betters in office to be cut up a littlehere's an habitation for the future soninlaw to a Grandee no furnitureno state apartments  examines centry box  However here's a good lock and key to the premises and they pay no taxesbut shall I never see my brave friend Carlos again nor embrace my divine Constantianono more salutes for me but with a drawn sword or a musquetah poor poor Hilario  walks about flourishing his arms  Enter  CLODDY  Cloddy  So so there's the ship I seeall ready to sailay ay I knew as how there was some infamous poaching going forwardbut I'll expose the old curmudgeonI'll

Centinel how do you do  Hilairo  Zounds this is Annette's brother  he don't know me in my regimentalshe may be useful  aside  well how are you Its very cold indeedso let's get warm by shaking hands you're a fine fellow  they shake hands  Cloddy  Yes and an honest fellow toofor when so be I sees mischief going forward that I've no hand in I always tries to prevent it  Hilario  Echoing  Yes you have no hand in it and therefore tries to prevent it  Cloddy  Yesnow do you see that vessel down in the harbourit belongs to that old piece of totteration Fractiosohe that is the Vicelegate  Hilario  Rota Scrota and so forth I know himwell what is he going to do with that vessel  Cloddy  I'll tell youhe has gotten a house in the remote part of the country among the mountains on the seacoastand he is going to take his daughter there and all his plate and his jewels and every thing he can carry away  Hilario  What can be his motive for that  Cloddy  Why they says he don't like the Count Montoni her husband as well as he was used and they have had words together and I suppose he thinks if he doesn't secure the property himself the Count will do it for him  Hilario  Likely enoughbut hasn't he another daughter  Cloddy  Yes but she has no husband to make any claims and to take care that she never shall he has sent her to a convent  Hilario  To a convent has he  Cloddy  Sure enoughto keep her out of the way of a most mischevous fellow one Hilariodo you know him he's the wickedest dog  Hilario  Ay that he isI know him as well as I do myselfbut see here's the old man coming  Cloddy  There he is an old rogueleading his daughter to be banishedod rabbit itsister can know nothing of this flightI doubt she ha' been off her listening or she'd raise the whole city with her clackhow a' name

as clever as you're honest  Cloddy  I tell you what centinelI wou'd do any thing to serve her because why when I accidentally tumbled down once and killed a large covey of partridges she interfered with her father and saved me from a dangerous sorethroat  shews his meaning with his hand  oh you old hard hearted bit of justice  runs out  Enter  FRACTIOSO  leading in  JULIA  followed by a Servant

life is worth a year's purchase  Julia  Had Carlos been so inconsiderate as to entertain improper hopes the letter you have just now obliged me to write to him must have extinguished them allOh Sir why did I write but to oblige my fatherwhere do I wish to live and die but under his protecting roof Let me not however be torn from my loved sister the partner of  my infancy the only companion of my happy days I ever now can cherish  Fractioso  Your sister is safe enough in a cloistershe has no husband to frighten her poor fatherdon't you remember how fierce the Count look'd at our last interview he knit his brows and said "Ough I will have my wife"then you cried" nono" then he replied "blood and oons I will have her dowry" then I too cried "no no"so I'm determined to hide both you and the property where they will be safe from a furious husband and an artful lover  Julia  Oh Sir Consider your distress'd child  Fractioso  Yes and I'll consider my distressed selfI should not be surprized if they were to try to lock me up likewise in an old castletherefore dispatchcome on board while there is nobody to interruptnay no demurringwho knows but that dog Hilario may have made his escape and

upon it himself  Annette  Who made such an attempt good Bernardo who cou'd be base enough to attack so precious a life as yours  Bernardo  Who that monster the Count Montoni  Annette  What your friend and patron  Bernardo  The samefinding me resolv'd no longer to assist his criminal designs against the lady Julia and her father and dreading my discoverery of the past he would have secured my silence by the dagger's point  Annette  That's one way indeed of making one hold one's tongue  Bernardo  I luckily averted the blow and wou'd have aveng'd it but the disappointed assassin took refuge in a boat that was waiting for him on the beach and has I suppose fled his country for ever  Annette  In my mind his country is very much obliged to him It would be lucky if all countries  could get rid of their secret enemies in the same way  Bernardo  I am determined now to make every atonement in my power  Annette  Indeed I think it's high timeSo then my friend your assertion respecting the guilt of Carlos was a  mistake  and the business at that old castle was  Bernardo  O name it nothorror and remorse o'erwhelm mewou'd I cou'd see Signor Fractioso he knows not that Carlos whom he despised and rejected has been the saviour of his daughter's life  Fractioso peeps thro' a hole in the centry box  Annette  None but such an obstinate simpleton as my master could have been so imposed

deliver'd him my sister's letter  Annette  Ah the one her barbarous father forced her to write to him  Constantia  Forced indeed Annette'twas the only alternative he left her to save herself from being again committed to the power of her tyrant husband  Annette  When Carlos read the cruel mandate commanding him never to think of her more oh I shall never forget himhe pausedthen read it againthen tore himself away saying he would seek refuge in some happier clime  Constantia  I trust his friend Hilario knows of his retreat  Enter  MONTAUBAN  hastily  Montauban  Lady if you have any

sure no I don'tI take you for a gentleman an honourable gentleman but a burnt child you know  Fisherman  What have you too been hurt There is a poor wounded Signor hard by that I have been taking care of for some days past  Valoury  A wounded Signor What is he called  Fisherman  I think I saw on the back of a letter he is always reading the name of Carlos  Valoury  Carlos What Carlos He that is in love with the Lady Juliahe that is the rival of the Count Montonihe that is master to the sweetest and best looking servant that ever had an appetitewhere is he Let me see himI am his faithful followerand have come here on purpose to make him laugh and be merry  Fisherman  Then you are come to very little purpose He's wounded both in body and mind I fear in spite of my skill he'll not be long above water  Valoury  Above water Why what's the matter What has happened  Fisherman  All I know you shall hearreturning from fishing the other evening I saw land out of an open boat two men of decent appearance more so than either you or I  Valoury  surveying himself  Speak for yourself if you pleasebut go on  Fisherman  I overheard one say "This retired place will suit" The other replied "It willand the event will prove who best deserv'd her" Well they walked into a woodI followed to see what it all meantdirectly they drew their swords and after a round or two one unknown gentleman fell and the other fled leaving him for dead  Valoury  And the other was the Count beyond all doubtoh the butcher But where is my poor master Shew me to him  Fisherman  I am only going down to the shore to prepare my tackle ready for the next tide and if you'll follow me in a few minutes I'll direct you to where the poor gentleman passes most of his time He is sadly out of sorts that's the truth of it But my skill perhaps may do something  Exit  Valoury  alone  I'll fated master Wounded both in body and mindhowever I'll raise my own spirits lest I shou'd damp hisoh this love They manage those matters much better in England that's the country for people to marry in  SONG  O what a country for people to marry in  Love and its comforts they never miscarry in  Miss wants a husband and

seen in the middle thro' which the sea is disernible  CARLOS  discovered writing on a stone part of the ruins his arm bound up  Carlos  "Here died Carlos who lived but for Julia"that is my epitaphthere the pensive moralist or chance wanderer may read the little story of my fate Those who loved me will shed a tear of recollection to my memory those who but profess'd it may pass the stone unmovedoh Julia could I have believed you would have used  me thus  takes out a letter  can it be her hand It is it isalas what can so deeply wound the heart or so fatally unstring each nerve of life

praised we are met once more Sir  Carlos  We are and perhaps for the last time my faithful Valouryyour are come to lay your master's ashes in the silent tomblook there  Pointing to ruins  Valoury  looking  Therewhy what's that hole surely it is not a grave  Carlos  Why not what place so proper to terminate my woes Time's beckoning hand amid these mouldering ruins seems to invite decaying nature here to seek her last repose  Valoury  Mercy forbid  Carlos  Here is my death blowfixed determinedall will soon be over  shews Julia's letter  see'tis Julia's hand'tis she has sealed my doom  Valoury  Dear Sir don't mind what the ladies writedo let me lead you to the fisherman's hut think how much more comfortable even that will be than to remain amongst these broken bits of stone so hard that not even an ostrich could digest them  Carlos  Valoury observe my final requestI  thought e're this to have met the triumph of my toils but lingering strength still keeps me on the brink of fatedespair must speed the blow  aside  when you shall behold me disfigured motionless and pale when that cold house shall take its tenant in convey this stone to the spotstrew some damp earth on your departed master then fix the monument and turn away  Valoury  Lord your honour don't talk so dolefully  Carlos  One thing beside shou'd chance conduct the fair one to these lonely ruins point out the undeckt stone tell her one tear will not degrade her honour or incenseI can no more my eyes grow dim my strength fails  Sinks on Valoury's shoulder  Valoury  Alas my dear master I am like an April day I wish to smile but am forced to weep my faithful services were acceptable when you was happy I hope they will be doubly usefull now in your distress  A ship appears in sight and salutes It must be the same vessel that sailed from the quay in st Scene  There Sirdo you hear that Do cheer up a littlewho knows but that vessel may bring you comfort  Carlos  What comfort can it bring to me misfortune has clouded all my youthful prospects and flatt'ring hope beam'd forth one transient ray only to fix a gloom more permanent  Sailors shout without  Valoury  Hear your Honour how joyous they are no doubt they're friends  Carlos  Perhaps not noise and uproar are often the forerunners of vice and profligacylet us  retreat however and shelter ourselves behind these ivy'd towers  They retire behind ruins  Enter  HILARIO  and  JULIA  followed by sailors  Hilario  Away you roguesaway you've steered right and I have rewarded you  Exeunt sailors  So our person is arrived and all our moveables are safewell charming lady isn't this better than the Black Mountains they say Carlos is in this part of the coastit would have been full as gallant if he had come down to the strand to receive our person on landing  Julia  Alas I know not whymy heart forbodes some new misfortune I shudder at the recollection of the unfeeling letter my father forced me to write to himwhy did the country people tell us he was buried among these ruins  Hilario  Only a figurative expression as we authors term it He was always fond of poking in odd holes and corners so the bumkins call it burying himself aliveCarlos holloa Carlos  calling and looking round  Gad was ever lady in so whimsical a situation Her lover hid amongst piles of old rubbish and her father lock'd up in a watchboxCarlos Carhah what the devil's

for Julia"  Looking on the stone but pretending not  Julia  Has any thing happened have you hurt yourself  Hilario  I have indeed  rubbing his legs  This stone's so cursed sharpDon't you go near itIt will cut you thro' and thro'  Julia  You seem greatly agitated What inscription is that  going up to the stone sees and reads it  He's dead he's dead  screaming  Almighty powers the measure of my woes is now compleat  Hilario  Have patience dearest lady  Julia  E'en this I cou'd have borne Hilario had your friend's dying moments witnessed my unshaken constancy and ever growing lovebut to suppose me base perfidiouswith his last breath perhaps to curseOh 'tis too much I can't support it  Hilario  Madam I have little comfort to bestowyet let me say that grief when tempered with reason honours alike the living and the dead  Julia  more agitated  Here will I pass my drooping hours of life and weary heaven with pray'rs for Carlos  Clasps her hands in a kind of frenzy  Hilario  trying to raise her  Rise hapless lady be advised  Julia  with wild resignation and trying to get up  Yeslet me risesuperior to my fate let me assert the rights of natureno brutal Lord no tyrant father shall restrain me

themdown with them hah hah what have you to say now my valiant centinel Here's the little decrepid old gentleman come againI perceive you're still in indifferent Company  Hilario  to Carlos  Zounds

us allhe had got another wife before  Hilario  Huzza and I suppose he has as many castles as wives to conceal them in  Fractioso  Will nobody stop that fellow's mouth I tell you I have delivered him over to the hands of justice and Julia is her own mistress again and free to do every thing that shall command  Annette  A very great indulgence indeed  Fractioso  Yes and therefore I command her on pain of a nunnery to give her handto Carlos  he has saved her life and now let him preserve it  Julia and Carlos advancing  Don't say a wordI hate all speechifying except my own  Annette  Most people

daughters my two plagues at oncecome here you imp of mischieftake Constantia with a very small dowryjust to keep you cool and comfortablearn't you a pretty fellow with your Rota Scrota and  Hilario  Yes I believe I amI always said I shou'd be soninlaw to a grandee at lastMy dear Constantia's silence gives me room to speak  Fractioso  Aye and your dear Constantia's tongue will keep your's silent if possible when you're marriedI never knew any of the sex that fail'dAnnette doesn't that put you in mind of your old grandmother too Zounds here are the natives coming down upon us we'll let them partake of our joy  Julia  Words are inadequate to speak my feelings Raised from the depth of woe to the highest pinnacle of human happiness I scarce believe the wonderful transitionA short time past my heart was fettered and every sentiment of nature shrunk from actionnow all the energies of life spring forth anew and duty love and friendship rush upon meOh may each varied character be well sustained that in the partial bosoms of approving friends my future conduct may invite affection and secure esteem  FINALE  Chorus  Since the gladsome hour at length arrives  Which affliction from remembrance drives  We may hope with faithful friends and wives  To be happy all our lives  SOLO  Ev'ry joy that's worth possessing  Friendship chearing love caressing  Life's invaluable blessing  Nature's dear domestic scene  Shall with all its sweets surrounding  Sweets that nurture no chagrin  Sprightly song and jest abounding  Witness that the heart's serene  For the gladsome hour at length arrives  Which affliction from remembrance drives  So we hope with faithful friends and wives  To be happy all our lives  MONTAUBAN  Age a kind indulgence shewing  While on youth its gifts bestowing  Will their grateful hearts o'erflowing  Feel its early warmth renewed  CONSTANTIA  Youth with native ardour firing  Love and duty both conspiring  Every vengeful thought retiring  Is by generous care subdued  Since the gladsome hour at length arrives  Which affliction from remembrance drives  Save the Bard who for your favour strives  And be happy all your lives  FINIS  EPILOGUE  Spoken by Mrs MATTOCKS  LOVE'S influence drawn from scenes of former years  Why not pourtray it as it now appears  Annette no morethe Italian confidante  Suppose me now an old French gouvernante  With coaxing cringe my pupil's heart to charm  Discoursing fond and freelyarm in arm  She in the bloom of life and height of taste  A yard of feather and an inch of waist  Waist did I say I meant to mend my phrase  The spot which was the summit of the stays  "Young Charles" she sighsnothe old Peer his brother  "I love the onethen marry with the other  "His withered hands so terrible to touch  "But then the Coronet upon his crutch  "Delightful thought That puts an end to sorrow  "I'll have him if papa consent tomorrowi  What glomwing love must spring from such a channel  They can't be cold who're always wrap'd in flannel  Turn we to courtship in a different strain  An ancient Venus and a youthful swain  The Fair if won a mine of wealth would prove  The hero poor in every thing but love  A crumplin she head shrunk between her shoulders  Mount on her back attracting all beholders  With Koscius  o cap and zone to bind  The neck before the prominence behind  Her tiny person and her cumb'rous pack  Look like a drum girt round a drummer's back  The six foot stripling firm in every joint  Whose button'd trowsers brush the elbows point  Whose muslin foldings all his chin enclose  Meeting the pondrous hat that veils his nose  With mouth scarce visible you'd think our beau  The man in armour at my Lord Mayor's show  "Marry me ma'am he cries and take your swing  "Dam'me I love you dearlythat's the thing  "Who can such charming accents disapprove  "My heart's too tenderI was form'd for love  The little Lady all on tiptoe stands  He stoopsshe springsand so they join their hands  If such of modern love the blissful state  Who would not choose the love that's out of date  Some bright exceptions still we trust then are  Th' auspicious nuptials of the Royal Pair  May bring old fashion'd feelings into vogue  And shame the satire of our Epilogue  Long may they live with fond delight to prove  Life's sweetest joys flow from connubial love  PLAYS c PRINTED FOR TN LONGMAN  The
