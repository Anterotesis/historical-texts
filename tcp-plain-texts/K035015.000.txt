 CONSTANTINE A TRAGEDY  Price One Shilling and Sixpence  CONSTANTINE A TRAGEDY As it is ACTED at the THEATREROYAL IN  COVENTGARDEN  LONDON  Printed for A MILLAR overagainst  Catherinestreet  in the  Strand  MDCCLIV  To the RIGHT HONOURABLE The Earl of CHESTERFIELD  My Lord  I Did not dare so coldly was this Play received by the Town to ask Leave in the usual Forms to dedicate it to your Lordship Its Fate was early determined and in such a Manner that I very little flatter myself it can be worthy of your Lordship's Patronage or may presume to boast it was once honoured with your Approbation But as I may probably never have another Opportunity certainly not in this Kind of writing of publicly professing my Respect my Esteem I had almost said my Affection for your Lordship may I not be forgiven if I thus dedicate not the Play but its Author not his Poetry but his Understanding and his Heart  WITH Sentiments such as these I dare assure your Lordship you shall not be insulted with the usual too civil Language of Dedications Yet I confess I would gladly recover the Name of Dedications to its antient Dignity before they were prostituted most absurdly prostituted by the Author of the  Pharsalia  when he dedicated to a Tyrant a Poem in Defence of Liberty I  confess I mean to praise for honest Praise is not only one of the warmest Incitements to Virtue but its most honourable Reward Great Minds will receive it with their natural Greatness and only little Spirits have an Affectation of refusing it The Task I own is not without Difficulty but when the Original is marked with strong and pleasing Lines of Life a meaner Hand may preserve the Likeness The Integrity of his Colouring if I may be allowed the Expression is of more Consequence than the Glow and Richness of it Dedications would then be like Pictures in Miniature which the future Historian might draw out into larger Proportion Grace and Dignity  LET me then have the Honour of informing your Lordship's Historian that although your Youth perhaps was spent among Pleasures not illsuited to that gayer Season of Life neque tu choreas sperne puer yet it was not lost among its too frequent Dissipations Ancient and modern Languages with an accurate and critical Knowledge of the English Tongue its Harmony Copiousness and Variety of Expression are not to be acquired without much Application Nor could the greatest natural  Abilities not even your own my Lord have appeared in the most important Debates of the House of Lords with such superior Strength of Reasoning with Eloquence in the true Character of Eloquence at once pleasing and powerful had they not been improved by all Advantages of Education  TO such Abilities were intrusted the Honour and Interest of the Nation in Embassies abroad and the most important Employments at Home How happily for IRELAND was the Possessor of them sent thither as Lord Lieutenant in that dangerous Crisis the late Rebellion One Part of the Nation the natural Enemies of his Majesty's Government were to be awed by Power tempered with Lenity the other were to be restrained in their Zeal of Loyalty which though sometimes shewn perhaps with too much Warmth hath ever been their Glory and their Boast How happily the Goodness of your Lordship's Heart was mixed with the Wisdom of your Councils the Gratitude of the whole People will for ever acknowledge Long may you enjoy their Wishes their Prayers for your Happiness Long may you enjoy the Consciousness of your own Integrity that nobly  refused a Vote of Credit and an Offer of raising a Body of Forces which you wisely foresaw would be an useless Expence to the Kingdom What must be the Firmness and Generosity of that Spirit which is not to be seduced by Gold intimidated by Danger or corrupted by Views of enlarging its Power  YOUR Lordship now seems determined and surely the gallant Veteran deserves his Dismission to retire from all public Business Permit my Lord this honest Dedication for well you know that Flattery would not desire it to attend you to your Retreat and with it be pleased to accept the sincerest Respect of  My LORD  Your Lordship's most obliged and most obedient Servant PHILIP FRANCIS  THE PROLOGUE  O'ER a soft Tale of well imagin'd Woes  The willing Tear with feeble Transport flows  But when the Muse in her own Griefs appears  The storied Sorrows of a thousand Years  A nobler Tribute than our Tears we pay  Our Passions hear her and our Hearts obey  Such Scenes tonightOh for a Muse of Fire  Great  Shakespear  thine our Author to inspire  Then fierce Ambition Guilt Despair and Rage  And frantic Jealousy should shake the Stage  Tyrants and Slaves her equal Wrath should find  Her Furies haunt them and revenge Mankind  But where's the modern Spirit can sustain  The Weight of Greece or draw the Roman Scene  Their Heroes seem of some superior State  Great in their Virtues in their Vices great  Here wild Ambition Earth and Heaven defies  And thereOh glorious Fate the Patriot greatly dies  Yet if with modest Hope our Author aim  At your Applausefor your Applause is Fame  Let him tonight your wonted Candour find  Oh be the Critic's Eye a little blind  And if to You ye Fair he pours his Heart  To your Distresses gives his tenderest Art  To Beauty Virtue and to You he sues  As you inspir'dOh patronize his Muse  EPILOGUE  Spoken by Miss BELLAMY  WELL you expectso says the Taste in Vogue  To these sad Scenes a laughing Epilogue  But I'm untaught in every comic Grace  Wit's bolder Mirth or Humour's various Face  Nor shall I dare with your lov'd mimic Art  Take

 As for our Playmethinks this tragic Plot  Might furnish precious Hints for you know what  To leave an Empresstho' so wondrous chaste  With a young Lovertwo full Hours at least  In our frail Times this dangerous tete a tete  In the first Acthad made the Play complete  And then the Moralye whose happy Lives  Are bless'd with rare Discretionin your Wives  When Trifleslight as Airshall turn your Heads  Ah shun that naughty Trickof separate Beds  Besides the midnightreconciling Billing  Ah think how near was  CONSTANTINE  to killing  But hush our Bard  If should he hear us laughing wont he say  Your flippant Mirthgood Ma'ammay damn my Play  Then for my Sakebut I'm in such a Fright  WellI'll give out the Playfor Monday Night  A New EPILOGUE  Written by a Person of DISTINCTION  Miss BELLAMY's Illness prevented her speaking it  IN all this Scene of Treason Swords and Death  My Fright has almost ta'en away my Breath  And yet our Bard insists that I must say  Something for him and something for his Play  Most of the Fairones sure must be contented  And must approve the Part I've represented  Who think these Characters no Stain to Life  The duteous Daughter and the tender Wife  Who taste the highest Blessings while they prove  The Husband's Fondness and the Parent's Love  Tho' I confess there are of our sweet Sex  Who form'd to please transform themselves to vex  Rebels to gentlest Sway Foes to Restriction  Whose chiefest Bliss is plac'd in Contradiction  Who think Obedience to the milder Will  Of a kind Parent smells of Childhood still  And that the Father should not be obey'd  Not half an Hourafter the Portion's paid  To such alone whose virtuous Bosoms prove  Paternal Fondness or connubial Love  Our Author freely offers up his Cause  And let those generous Passions stand for Laws  By them he will be try'd if they acquit  He's safe if they condemn he must submit  Dramatis Personae  CONSTANTINE  Mr  Barry    MAXIMIAN  Mr  Sparks    AURELIAN  Mr  Smith  ALBINUS  Mr

ridiculous after the ill Success of this Play upon the Stage to tell the Reader I took Part of the Fable and the Translation if I remember rightly of ONE only Line from a French Tragedy called MAXIMIAN But all Concealments of this Kind are disingenuous  CONSTANTINE  ACT I SCENE I  The  EMPEROR  's Palace  AURELIAN  and  MARCELLUS  meeting  AURELIAN  SPEAK have I Leave to see her  MARCELLUS  Yes my Lord  AURELIAN  But when How soon For did the Hour Marcellus  Ride on the Tempest's Wing the Speed of Light  Its Swiftness were too slow Yet yet she comes not  MARCELLUS  What can these Transports mean Are these Emotions  To tell the Empress that her Lord returns  With Conquest to her Arms Did Friendship send you  Its Messenger of Love Did CONSTANTINE  AURELIAN  He sent me not  MARCELLUS  My Lord  AURELIAN  Nor do I come  A Messenger of Conquest Joy or Love  MARCELLUS  Then my worst Fears are true Th' impetuous Passion  Flames forth again again MAXIMIAN's Daughter  AURELIAN  Is she not all her Sex's Pride would aim at  Their various Arts of charming  MARCELLUS  Dear my Lord  Tho' she were fairer than th' ideal Beauty  That warms the Lover's Hopes or Poet's Fancy  Yet shall the bright Temptation best Excuse  For human Frailty melt away all Faith  Allegiance Honour Duty Oh remember  AURELIAN  What That she now is wedded to another  Another breathes my Transports o'er her Bosom  Sighs out my Love and drinks with raptur'd Ear  The Vows that once were mine If thou couldst charm  The Madman's Ravings bid the Heart be still  When Passion shakes us or with Words of Wisdom  Pour on the feverish Sense the Balm of Health  I then might listen to thee  MARCELLUS  Is this AURELIAN  The Pride of Rome Th' Example of her Youth  But I confess this Language well befits  Your Commerce with MAXIMIAN a Spirit made of Fire  Whose fierce Ambition and whose fell Revenge  He knows no other Passions vex his Soul  As adverse Winds and meeting Tides at Sea  Roll the wild Waves on Heaps  AURELIAN  Revenge Ambition  Whence can they rise What Motives to enflame them  Does he not share with our great Emperor  All but the Name of Empire and its Cares  What would a Father's Heart howe'er ambitious  More than to see the Homage of the Nations  Paid to his Daughter's Virtues to her Beauty  MARCELLUS  Her Greatness only brings to his Remembrance  His own was lost when our late Emperor  Forc'd him to give her Hand to CONSTANTINE  And happily for Europe wrested from him  Th' imperial Power Since when his Rage beholds  His Son as the Usurper of his Throne  Then in his Zeal for the old Gods of Rome  He hates him as a Christian Should he tempt  Your Youth to join with his Despair your Virtue  I know the rich Reward  AURELIAN  Look where she comes  A rich Reward indeed I pray you leave me  And at some better Leisure every Secret  Of Confidence and Friendship shall be yours    Exit  MARCELLUS  AURELIAN  And is it mineye Powers why am I destin'd  To throw Disorder o'er that loveliest Form  To fill those Eyes with weeping and that Breast  With Anguish beyond Thought  Enter  FULVIA  FULVIA  AURELIAN welcome  Say to my Heart my CONSTANTINE is well  Give me the storied War the Battle's Rage  Tho' my Soul tremble at it Shew my Hero  In all the bleeding Pride of glorious Danger  How terribly adorn'd But ah my Fears  You do not feel my Transports Downcast Eyes  Horror is in thy Face  AURELIAN  'Tis in my Heart  FULVIA  Where is my Lord my Emperor Oh speak  Is he a Conqueror Comes he Home in Triumph  AURELIAN  Fame Honour Conquest bind their Wreaths of Glory  Around his sacred Temples and he comes  T' enjoy his Triumphs in his FULVIA's Arms  FULVIA  Why would you thus alarm me I'm a Woman  In Tenderness and Love in all Things else  A Roman Spirit and MAXIMIAN's Daughter  Still there's a Fearis it too big for Utterance  Heaves at your Heart Such Silence speaks all Fears  AURELIAN  Could my Despair could my Distraction tell you  What my Heart feels this Moment how it bleeds  Your Pity would forgive me tho' I stain  Your Father's venerable Name with Blood  Tho' I accuseNoHonour Faith and Loyalty  They only shall accuse him  FULVIA  Stop not thus  Let not my Fears grow impious in their Wildness  My Fatherthere th' alarming Tale began  MAXIMIAN  AURELIAN  Too impatient to resume  Th' imperial Purple he so late resign'd  Thinking the little Fame my Youth hath gain'd  My Interest with the Legions my Command  So near the Person of my royal Master  Might aid his Purpose with unbounded Hand  Threw out Ambition's Glories to my View  With half the Throne of Universal Empire  FULVIA  While CONSTANTINE your Emperorwhile he lives  Where slept this fierce Desire or Power so long  What wakes it now to Madness  AURELIAN  When the Rage  Of Battle ceas'd and Victory no longer  Stood hovering o'er us with uncertain Wing  My Lord MAXIMIAN ask'dalmost demanded  The Government of these new German Conquests  For his once favourite Freedman CAIUS LUCIUS  FULVIA  That gloomy Fierceness that unpitying Soldier  But then my Lord  AURELIAN  Perhaps with some Impatience  Refus'd the warm Request Grief Shame and Anger  The Consciousness of Greatness and the Pride  That saw the Soldiers mourn for his Disgrace  The Time the Place each Circumstance deep smote  Your Father's Heart and wak'd Ambition's Fires  Tho' long but ill suppress'd Hence the Proposal  But when he saw my Soul start back with Horror  And sicken at the Pomp of bad Ambition  He shew'd me thee that allexcelling Form  Love threw his Colours o'er it oh forgive me  To turn my Faith to Treason  FULVIA  Hold my Lord  Such Insolence of Language Who am I  AURELIAN  The Empress of the World the sacred Awe  Of grateful Nations of imperial Rome  The Pride the JoyYou are the Wife of CONSTANTINE  Yet oh remember there was once a Time  When other Loves approach'd you when MAXIMIAN  Approv'd my Passion authoris'd my Vows  And gave my Wishes Leave to gaze upon you  FULVIA  No more What Proofs of this black Deed My Father  Source of my Life'Tis Parricide to think it  AURELIAN  The Doubt becomes your Piety Behold  This Sword A fatal Witness  FULVIA  'Tis not that  My Lord's first Gift his bridalmorning Present  I must not dare not think it or 'twas given you  For some blest Purpose to protect my Lord  When Oh too prodigal of Life he thinks not  That Life is Love's and mine  AURELIAN  With this he arm'd  My fearful Hand with this he bad me strike  How shall I say the Heart your Love delights in  Then loud he cried possess my Daughter's Beauties  And share the World with me I took it trembling  Lest he might find some Slave so lost to Honour  As to obey his Guiltiness  FULVIA  My Lord  If I have wrong'd your Virtue by suspecting  Yet Nature claims her Rights and awful bids me  Not trust too lightly to an Accusation  That brands a Father's everhonour'd Name  With Perfidy and Treason O my CONSTANTINE  Is this thy Day of Triumph This Return  For all thy Toils to bless a thankless World  How shall thy FULVIA meet thee Shall her Heart  With other Pantings than with those of Love  Receive its Lord and tremble in his Arms  AURELIAN  Oh stop these soft Complainings Even this Hour  Death sits upon its Wings and fierce Revenge  Lashes its Speed this Moment must determine  A Father's Fate or  FULVIA  Husband's How determine  Am I the dire Reward the Prize of Blood  Horror on Horror of my Husband's Blood  Ye Powers who make this Trial of my Weakness  But oh what Form of PrayerHeaven must not hear me  Daughter or Wifein Love or Nature impious  In either Name a Force that pulls my Heartstrings  AURELIAN  Each Instant I expect him for he comes  To regulate the Honours of the Day  Meet him with Smiles with unsuspecting Looks  Throw your Caresses round him and awake  With Nature's Voice th' Affections she inspires  FULVIA  Meet him with Smiles Thou cruel cold Adviser  No with these Tears for what can stop their flowing  Or with the louder Sorrows of Distraction  'Till Nature hear my Cries thro' all her Works  AURELIAN  Oh yet with calmer Temper Sooth him melt him  With Prayers with Tears and when you urge him strongest  Seem most to doubt to disbelieve to think  'Twas but a Start of Passion of Ambition  That Madness of the Brave Let your Success  Insure the Peace of Nations of the World  And give you down to Fame a nobler Story  Than yet your Sex can boast    Exit  AURELIAN  FULVIA  alone  What Fame What Story  To violate th' eternal Laws of Nature  Her dearest first Relations Child and Parent  To be myself th' Accuser or behold  My wedded LordOh yet forbid it Love  Stabb'd in my Arms reproaching me in Death  A perjur'd faithless Wife Distraction guide me  Where the Heart cannot chuse and Reason dares not  Enter a  MESSENGER  MESSENGER  Madam my Lord MAXIMIAN    Exit  FULVIA  alone  Now my Soul  Meet this new Trial firmly this Dissembling  That talks in Smiles when the sad Heart's in Tears  Enter  MAXIMIAN  FULVIA  kneeling to him  Witness this pious Tender of my Duty  How gladly I behold my Father's Presence  Thus may I ever see the laurel'd Wreath  Circling his Brows with Glory Sure my Lord    She rises  Ah whence that Coldness that averted Look  The fierce and hardy Germans are a Conquest  Worthy the ancient Majesty of Rome  MAXIMIAN  How did they dare rebel Ye Powers immortal  Who form'd th' imperial City to its Greatness  How are we fall'n The Majesty of Rome  Shall it be deem'd a Conquest to have quell'd  A single Nation This Day's idle Pomp  Be number'd with the Triumphs we have seen  When the World sunk beneath us But our Eagles  That us'd to soar with Empire on their Wings  Now bend their Flight like Birds of meaner Plume  To stoop at worthless Triumphs while our Emperor  FULVIA  aside  Now now the Cloud is opening into Thunder  MAXIMIAN  His Thoughts are HeavenwardIn his holy Zeal  For this new Sect this Christian Superstition  He has transferr'd th' eternal Seat of Empire  From where the Gods had fix'd it to this City  Now honour'd with his Name Allsovereign JOVE  Where are the Thunders that assert thy Godhead  The Temples where we offer'd to thy Name  The Vows of human Kind can'st thou behold them  Defil'd polluted and not pour thy Wrath  Upon his Head this Emperor of Christians  FULVIA  Oh spare the dreadful Image Gracious Heaven  Throw your own Shield of Safety o'er his Life  Protect him from the Schemes of fierce Ambition  Unhallow'd Vengeance and the midnight Treason  That dares not rise to the fair Face of Day  MAXIMIAN  What would our Empress mean  FULVIA  Oh shall the Sword  It was a Soldier's Present to a Soldier  To Deeds of Honour was it ever sacred  Nor in the wild tumultuous Hour of Fight  E'er stain'd its Lustre with a Coward's Blood  But with distinguish'd Slaughter swept the Field  And shall MAXIMIAN for less noble Purpose  Unsheath its Terrours He who oft hath led  The Roman War to Conquest He whose Life  Should guard the Life of EmpireShall my Father  MAXIMIAN  Coward AURELIAN Base betraying Christian    Aside  Who dares accuse me  FULVIA  Sir your Daughter must not  MAXIMIAN  My Daughter No my Empress as it seems  The Wife of CONSTANTINE Thou young Ingratitude  Can'st thou forgetBut I'll not bid the Gods  Th' avenging Gods remember how I've lov'd thee  Go Parricide betray thy Father's Age  To Cruelty and Tortures When my Heart  Shall burst in Death when my strong Sinews crack  In agonizing Anguish let your Eye  Delighted see my Torments and your Ear  Enjoy my Groans  FULVIA  Oh save me save me Nature  From the dire Scene from Horrors to distract me  But I'll offend no more for even my Grief  Distraction and Despair shall speak the Language  Of Duty and of Love Yet hear them speak  And then imagine that last Night in Sleep  I saw my Father's Hand bath'd deep in Blood  His Son's his Emperor's Blood How did I rend  The Air with Shrieks and on his bleeding Corse  Pour my distracted Sorrows While my Tears  Flow'd fastthey flow'd in no unreal Streams  Such as you see them now  MAXIMIAN  I see the Visions  Of a disorder'd Fancy that has form'd  Its own wild Images of Grief and Terrour  If there be aught more real in thy Story  Give me to know the Slave who dares accuse me  FULVIA  Accuse What Accusation Shall MAXIMIAN  The Glory once th' Example of the Brave  Be in his Age accus'd and Oh for ever  Be number'd with the Guilty and their Crimes  Better be lost to Fame for ever lost  No Eye to weep your Memory not even mine  Mine shall be clos'd in Death or wildest Horrour  Sit gazing on its open Sense for ever  MAXIMIAN  Wild as the Dreams of Madness Tell me Madam  But I'll not chide you for th' unkind Suspicions  These visionary Terrours have inspir'd  They too shall pass away in this Day's Triumph  And Peace return to thy affrighted Spirit  FULVIA  Oh never never These imagin'd Terrors  To me are real Anguish and Despair  Oh hear me Sir    Throwing herself on her Knees    Your Purposeshould it prosper  What Horrors shall alarm your waking Sense  Dwell on your Sleep and fright your Dreams to Madness  The Tempests of the Night shall rage within you  And when you hear the Thunder cold pale Fear  Shall sit upon your Heart shall stop its Beatings  And freeze the Stream of Life O CONSTANTINE    Rising  While we are meditating Death your Love  Perhaps is forming some fond generous Scheme  To make your FULVIA happy and to crown  Her Father's Days with Glory  MAXIMIAN  Ha Can CONSTANTINE  Add to MAXIMIAN's Glory Did there need  This second Outrage Are my old Years thus  O Curse of Age insulted by my Child  FULVIA  Am I your Child Will you and Nature own me  MAXIMIAN  Wer't thou not every Joy to every Sense  That pours the Passions here And now Ungrateful  Yet you can weepThose Tearscan they be false ones  How gladly would thy Father's Love believe them  How gladly think thou Fondness of my Soul  Some Villain's Arts have wrought upon thy Weakness  To do this Act of Outrage on my Heart  FULVIA  Have I then wrong'd youHow my Soul rejoices  In the sweet Hope These these the Tears of Joy  They they alone shall witness for my Truth  They only shall implore Forgiveness for me  MAXIMIAN  I do believe them they are Nature's Truth  And thou the purest Bliss my Prayers e'er ask'd  Or Heaven's large Bounty gave me Pray retire  Dry these illomen'd Tears Rely upon me  MAXIMIAN never can forget his Honour  Never forget a Father's Tenderness    Leads her out returns and speaks  Then all is lost Revenge Ambition Empire  Or henceforth to be held by vile Dependance  On a weak Girl's Affection by dissembling  He who has led to War the Fate of Nations  And sway'd th' Imperial SceptreO MAXIMIAN  How are thy Glories wither'd Is it Fear  Let me not think itCan the Love of Life  A poor precarious casual Hour of Breathing  Subdue me thus No 'tis some nobler Passion  Unsated Rage and Vengeance on the Slave  Whose Christian Fears betray'd me If ALBINUS  Should he betray me too my Fame my Life  But that's a Triflemy Revenge is lost  Enter  ALBINUS  MAXIMIAN  without looking back    Who's there  ALBINUS  My everroyal Lord  MAXIMIAN  turning from  ALBINUS  ALBINUS  Start at the Presence of a Friend What Power  Can thus controul the Senses My Confusion  It doubles on meTo be seen surpriz'd  Thus in my Soul's Disorderin its Weakness  ALBINUS  I've stood thus long my Lord in silent Wonder  MAXIMIAN  There's an unsleeping Spirit here ALBINUS  That ceaseless talks to Memory and tells me  I was an Emperor once  ALBINUS  A truly great one  MAXIMIAN  'Tis in my Dreams It lives among my Slumbers  While Fancy wild Creation's various Mistress  Forms my full Court and bids them bend the Knee  As if my Frowns were Death The Lictors Fasces  Th' applauding Senate and Praetorian Guards  Start at my Nod to execute to strike  At my great Bidding But the glorious Vision  Dazzling the Eye of Fancy when I wake  Melts into Air and I'm again a Slave  ALBINUS  What Power can shake that Temper which unmov'd  Rul'd the fierce Hour of Fight like Ocean's God  Who sits upon the Storm and guides its Raging  MAXIMIAN  War is no more O Rome thy Arts are lost  The honour'd Name of Soldier and his Glory  To shine in Arms to dare the Front of Danger  And follow Fortune through the doubtful Field  Our Emperor needs thee not His holy Warfare  To quell the Passions and subdue the Heart  His Triumphs need thee not  ALBINUS  Call back my Lord  These Wanderings into Reason  MAXIMIAN  Why to Reason  Will it not tell me I'm a Subject now  To me as hateful as the Name of Slave  Will it not tell me that I dare not punish  A Villain who betrays me  ALBINUS  Sir AURELIAN  MAXIMIAN  And shall the Gods of Rome behold me kneel  Beneath the Throne of CONSTANTINE his Name  Darts like a burning Fever thro' my Veins  And shall I enter into vile Debate  To clear my insulted Honour God of Vengeance  Why did I trust thy Causefor it was thine  To any other Hand I should myself  Have struck the destin'd Sacrifice at thine  And great Ambition's Altar  ALBINUS  Hark his Trumpets  He now is entering the triumphal Gate  We must prepare to meet him  MAXIMIAN  Yes and join  The universal Shout that calls him Lord  Hail'd by his Christian Priests right holy Flatterers  The Conqueror of the World While I O Torture  Beneath whose Name in War he rose to Empire  Upon whose Ruins he has built his Fame  Must wait upon his Fortune and appear  To grace his Chariotwheels and swell his Triumphs  ALBINUS  Let us not lose my Lord this noble Heat  In idle Threats and Rashness Yet ere Night  Something may be resolv'd of glorious Danger  Worthy MAXIMIAN of his Fortune worthy  When the same rapid Moment in its Flight  Shall form and execute  MAXIMIAN  Despair shall execute what Hope had form'd  Fall swift ye Shades of Night and all ye Powers  Who wing the midnight Darkness whom the Sun  With this his garish Light rebukes appals  Inspire our

Oh were it possible should bid the Nations  Unite in mutual Amity and Peace  That all the Blessings bounteous Nature gives  To different Climes as sure her Wisdom meant  Should be enjoy'd by all Take care AURELIAN  That every Honour due to great Deservings  Be paid these noble Prisoners Tho' the Chance  Of War be fall'n upon them yet like us  They fought their Country's Cause Let us remember  How long their Valour held the doubtful Field  And numbering o'er our Wounds let them instruct us  To reverence their Misfortunes  AURELIAN  Such a Conquest  Where nor the Vanquish'd mourn their Loss of Honor  Nor Kings their Sceptres nor the World its Freedom  Is worthy Caesar's Fortune    Pointing to them    While the Nations  From farthest India to the western Isles  Pour at your Feet the Homage of their Treasures  Rome sends a nobler Tribute Vows and Praise  Omens of glorious Hope in which she sees  Her once victorious Ardor rise renew'd  Thro' many a distant Age from this Day's Triumph  CONSTANTINE  Too long my Friend has the wild Waste of War  Rag'd o'er the Earth Oh were the scept'red Warriors  Whose Lust of Empire sets the World in Arms  Were they to see the Widow's keen Affliction  Or hear the Mother's Shrieks in her Despair  What could Ambition answer But in Peace  See where its fairest Image comes to meet us    seeing the Empress    With all its Blessings round her  Enter  FULVIA MAXIMIAN ALBINUS  O my FULVIA  Next to my People's Happiness and Glory  Thou art my Wreath of Victory the Crown  Of all my Triumphs Honour Fame and War  Shall witness for my Heart its tenderest Joys  Dwell in thy Arms thou purest Bliss of Love  FULVIA  My Lord my Emperorall other Words  Wrong my full Joy my Love  CONSTANTINE  'Tis Eloquence  Beyond all Power of Words It is the Language  My Heart best understands and talks to thine  Now by the dear Delight of gazing on thee  I swear the Rage of War its wildest Tumults  Have but endear'd this soft Return of Love  This Meeting of our Hearts But ah my FULVIA  Whence is that Air of Sadness Fear and Sorrow  Are pale upon thy Cheek And now a Tear  Stands trembling on the Lustre of thy Eye  FULVIA  Amidst the general Joy to pour my Soul  To call you mine the World's great Master mine  His Conquests Triumphs mine nay more his Love  Is such Excess of Blissyet oh forgive me  Thou Lord of all my Thoughts if aught illomen'd  Fancy or Fear a Woman's weaker Passions  Should mix themselves with thee  CONSTANTINE  But that I know  Thou Softness of thy Sex thy gentle Spirit  What might I think What Terrors must alarm me  Yet tell me tell th' Impatience throbbing here  Is it within the wide Command of Empire  To calm these tender Fears For what is Empire  Why have I conquer'd why this Day of Triumph  But that my FULVIA may accept its Glories  Laid at her Feet in Homage to her Beauties  FULVIA  Her matron Virtue rather and her Love  They may accept may feel the Joys of Greatness  Because the Gift is yours Yet midst its Glories  Can I be perfect happy while I see  Your cold Looks there    Pointing to  MAXIMIAN  While my divided Heart  Divided between Tenderness and Duty  Trembles for both  MAXIMIAN  aside to  ALBINUS  Ay now she tells him all  Now she describes O welldissembled Terrors  The fearful Deed now she protests her Love  And now with pious Seemings Goddess Nature  Dares she profane thy Name and call me Father  Pleads for my LifeO young Hypocrisy  CONSTANTINE  to  FULVIA  With what Delight  Has my Soul listen'd to thy pious Sorrows  Nor shall they plead in vain My Lord MAXIMIAN  What can I pay you back in rich Return  For Transports such as these You gave her to me  You made her Beauties made her Virtues mine  And bless'd my Soul with Love If large Ambition  Its scept'red Honours its imperial Sway  Can speak me grateful take divide them with me  Besides th' unhappy Gift I late denied you  Resume the sacred Purple let the World  Rul'd by your Wisdom learn the Arts of Peace  Or conquer'd by your War make Rome immortal  MAXIMIAN  There was a Time my Lord I thought Ambition  The Spirit of the Gods the Soul of Heroes  But these white Years which Time hath pour'd upon me  Have quench'd its Ardors These warwearied Limbs  Wish for Repose to lay their feeble Strength  Beneath the peaceful Shade which this Day's Triumph  Spreads o'er the Earth there in an old Man's Warfare  To talk of freezing Nights and burning Days  The Toils of Glory Sieges Marches Battles  And animate our Youth to Deeds of Honour  Be now my sole Ambition  FULVIA  to  CONSTANTINE  Tell my Heart  How to express these Transports or let Love  In its own Language thus in this Embrace  Pour forth at once its Gratitude and Joy  CONSTANTINE  With equal Rapture equal Joy inspir'd  My Soul meets thine Thus could I hold thee ever  Transported thus and gazing o'er thy Beauties  With Wonder as with Love But let us not  With impious Carelessness forget his Praise  By whose right Arm we conquer'd In his Temple  The only God of Victory we'll offer  The banner'd Trophy and the Spoils of War  In monumental Praise Then turn to Earth  Our future Cares with Liberty and Peace  Best Use of sovereign Power to bless Mankind    Exit  CONSTANTINE FULVIA AURELIAN  MAXIMIAN ALBINUS  MAXIMIAN  Was it of such slight Moment to provoke me  Did he so little dread MAXIMIAN's Anger  That he has granted to a Woman's Tear  What he denied to me For this the Legions  Whom I had led to Conquest saw me bend  My Spirit to the Earth confess his Power  Saw me refus'd a light unvalued Trifle  Scarce worth a Woman's Tears  ALBINUS  But now in Recompence  He offers half his Empire  MAXIMIAN  No 'twas Insult  You saw it plain contemptuous purpos'd Insult  His Insolence of Triumph that his Courtiers  His Christians might enjoy their Master's Pride  And my Dishonour But it seems in Recompence  He offers half his Empire Could his Word  Make me despotick Monarch of Creation  His Gift I would disdain it My Ambition  Shall it from him receive its sullied Honours  ALBINUS  This talking Heat this loose Intemperance  Is this MAXIMIAN's Vengeance But be sure  Suspicion is abroad it marks your Steps  Would you insure these Threats which now are Air  Keep your Eye constant let no Passion shake it  No Colour change your Cheek open your Face  In Smiles and let your Tongue flow loose in Flattery  Go to their Christian Temple  MAXIMIAN  What to hear  Their sainted Hymns in pious Harmony  Thrill'd thro' a Eunuch's Throat Their holy Minstrelsy  Suits not my Taste Give me a Soldier's Musick  Sung by the Voice of War with Discords in it  Or must I hear our Roman Jove blasphem'd  His Godhead ridicul'd in cold Harangues  That talk I know not what of holy Patience  That must forgive the Man who dares to wrong me  Doctrines for Slaves and Cowards  ALBINUS  Yet my Lord  What if the Empress we may well expect it  Or should AURELIAN tell this fatal Secret  We must with Boldness meet the Accusation  And throw it back upon them If my Lord  You would have Vengeance  MAXIMIAN  IfI will ALBINUS  This Christian Emperor and his favourite Slave  Shall he enjoy his Perfidy in Safety  ALBINUS  Yet would you kill him where he feels most sensibly  Beyond the Pains of his own fancied Hell  Strike at his Friendship his highboasted Loyalty  Make CONSTANTINE suspect him nay believe him  A Villain and a Traytor There are Witnesses  There are my Lord for Things impossible  What think you of MARCELLUS  MAXIMIAN  What His Friend  ALBINUS  His Friend And then who better can betray him  Who better be suppos'd to know his Heart  Not to amuse you longerThis his Friend  And some of higher Note bold Roman Spirits  Fond of the ancient Privilege of Triumphs  And high in Mirth which I had rais'd with Wine  With lavish Wit condemn'd the Emperor's Conduct  In the late War and ridicul'd his Conquests  I had them seiz'd confin'd them told the Emperor  With some Expressions some loose Hints of Treason  Which Men in Wine might possibly forget  MAXIMIAN  Methinks I see your Purpose and it charms me  ALBINUS  I shall by CONSTANTINE's Command examine them  If fair and friendly Methods fail to win them  Tortures shall make them speak as I shall prompt them  Then with some wellwrought Circumstance of Jealousy  MAXIMIAN  Of Jealousy  ALBINUS  What other Power can make him  Suspect the Man he loves Or will he listen  To other Crimes Ambition shall be Virtue  And Treason seem Ambition Then my Lord  All other Passions have their Hours of Thinking  And hear the Voice of Reason This alone  Breaks at the first Suspicion into Frenzy  And sweeps the Soul in Tempests  MAXIMIAN  But its Pangs  Those you forgetDo they not rend the Heart  Shall I not hear him groan  ALBINUS  You shall my Lord  For all its fiery Seeds are in his Temper  When Honour Justice Reason bid him act  No Being firmer but in all his Passions  The Whirlwind's Wildness is not more inconstant  When he you must remember and AURELIAN  This boasted Friend were Rivals for your Daughter  Friendship Esteem and oftenvow'd Affection  In the first Start of Jealousy were lost  Will he rage less when the imperial Greatness  Shall add its Pride when the wrong'd Husband's Honour  Brings all its nice Suspicions to enflame him  MAXIMIAN  And when my Eye when my Revenge is sated  With gazing on his Pangs when his full Sense  Can entertain no more of Pain and Anguish  Then in the Triumph of my Soul to tell him  His Wife was innocentAh Who was innocent  ALBINUS  Is this MAXIMIAN This th' unshaken Spirit  Let not the Soldier see it let not Rome  Who thinks you like her Gods above all Weakness  MAXIMIAN  Yet tell me can I say to my Revenge  Be thou my Daughter To this fierce Ambition  Bequeath my Power or bid it to inherit  My Name and Honours Can his deepest Groans  Charm my transported Soul like those sweet Sounds  That call'd me Father She is all my Children  ALBINUS  You are my Lord the Master of your Fate  It was not mine th' Ambition or the Vengeance  That prompted this great Deed not mine the Glory  Had it succeeded to restore O Jove  Thy violated Shrines and to Mankind  The Worship of their Reason uncontroul'd  By slavish Fears and illimagin'd Terrors  Nor mine the Danger if this muchlov'd Daughter  MAXIMIAN  All that is left me of the Name of Father  ALBINUS  In some loose House of Dalliance should betray you  I am not known thus honour'd with your Friendship  I pay to CONSTANTINE a Courtier's Flattery  Am thought a Favourite and Oh profess  Forgive me Gods a Worship I detest  I shall not trembling kneel before his Throne  And live with Infamy or die a Traytor  MAXIMIAN  First perish all Affections every Instinct  That breathes these Feelings thro' the Parent's Heart  'Tis past the Conflict's over and Ambition  Methinks I see the radiant Goddess come  And like a Soldier's Mistress to my Arms  Painted with Blood how fiercely sweet her Beauties  This Night ALBINUS you command the Palace  And when he sleepsOh shall MAXIMIAN kill  A sleeping Enemy Is this the Soldier  Is this th' Ambition that would rule the World  Oh Shame Shame Shame What End however glorious  Can justify such Means But not my Cause  'Tis thine O Rome thy everliving Fame  The Capitol and all its throned Gods  They strike the Blow they bid the Victim bleed    Exeunt  ACT III  FULVIA  WITH what paternal Tenderness he sooth'd me  With every dear Assurance that his Heart  Abhorr'd such Cruelty Then earnest press'd me  To ask the Emperor to make AURELIAN  Commander of his Guards Now now my Soul  Whence are the ceaseless Fears that shake thee thus  Whence are these strange Forebodings  Enter  CONSTANTINE  CONSTANTINE  Why my FULVIA  While the full Voice of Triumph o'er thy Name  Swells higher into Rapture while the Bowl  Pours forth its purple Spirits to thy Beauties  Why seek this Solitude Why shun the Joys  That you alone inspire How has my Love  Unwittingly offended Does MAXIMIAN  Why startled at his Name Does he believe  My Friendship insincere Why does your Eye  Gaze with so soft an Earnestness upon me  And now it melts into a mingled Stream  Of Tenderness and Sorrow  FULVIA  'Tis because  This is perhaps my last last Look of Tenderness  And all the rest is Sorrow  CONSTANTINE  By our Friendship  Its mutual Trust and Confidence of Heart  Or shall I urge the Husband's sacred Rights  No I disclaim all Rights but those of Love  Then in the Name of all its chaste Endearments  Its holy Raptures its mysterious Joys  Tell me thy Fears tell me thy Sorrows FULVIA  I have a Right of Love to share them with you  FULVIA  Why did I move you thus O Sir forgive me  It may be 'tis the Weakness of my Sex  But they who hate our Faith revile its Worship  And treat its pure Simplicity with Scorn  Are they fit Guardians of your sacred Person  The Lord of our Religion When I see  These Worshippers of Jove whose dire Example  Can justify even Treason can my Heart  Even in thy Arms in your's and Love's Protection  Can it speak Peace and Safety to its Fears  CONSTANTINE  How amiable those Fears Tho' form'd by Fancy  Their Colouring is of Love Yet are they not    Turning to her  Whate'er their Gods the noblest Worth of Rome  And in their Breasts that great Divinity  Their Country's Love  FULVIA  Let them enjoy your Bounty  Let every Honour their Ambition aims at  Reward their Worth But not to them alone  Your Life's expos'd This everopen Palace  Even to the meanest boldest of Mankind  Unfolds its Gates  CONSTANTINE  Are they not all my Subjects  What have I done What Acts of Tyranny  What violated Laws what bold Oppressions  Invade their Rights that I should fear their Presence  O Misery of Princes when they dread  Whom most they ought to love You know my FULVIA  You know your Power is Sovereign o'er my Will  Yet pr'ythee do not make a Coward of me  Oh spare my Fame nor brand it with Ingratitude  To them by whom that Fame may be immortal  FULVIA  Yes thou Unkind these TearsI will obey you  Shall flow no more My Heart shall beat no more  I will repress these Terrors will not start  Even at the Shrieks of MurderOh my Brain  See there my Lord It hovers o'er your Head  A Poniard streaming Blood The goary Drops  Glare thro' the midnight Darkness Earth and Heaven  That HandO Nature universal Parent  Whose is that Hand Does Mercy dwell in Heaven  I'll gaze no moreOh hide me in thy Bosom  Lest my Brain turn and I run mad for ever  CONSTANTINE  aside  Sure this is more than Fancy more than Fear  They are the Words of Fate Awake look up▪  All shall be well But these the Sons of Riot  Whose bold Intemperance hath alarm'd you thus  Shall they not feel my RageBe sure ye shall  The Vengeance of my Love    Turning back as if speaking to them  FULVIA  And can their Groans  When Life is on the Rack and stretch'd with Pain  Their Tortures ease my Heart Think you these Tears  I would restrain them flow for their Intemperance  Does not this Wildness this Distraction tell you  What my Tongue cannot utter  CONSTANTINE  If the Danger  Be mine alone and aim not at my Love  Let it descend in Thunders on my Head  Let it appear in any other Form  Than in thy GriefsThere my Soul sinks in Weakness  And in thy Fears I feel my Heart a Coward  FULVIA  And yet a little longer hear Oh hear me  Is there not one among our Christian Chiefs  Loyal as brave the rising Hope of Rome  The Glory of the War the Soldier's Praise  The Soul of all their Actions Would you give them  A General worthy of them or in War  To lead them on to Conquest or in Peace  With liberal Spirit to reward their Toils  Give the Command of the Praetorian Cohorts  To your AURELIAN and in him alone  You place a Guard of Virtues round your Person  CONSTANTINE  Oh why those Tears You do not need their Aid  To bid my Heart obey you Could you doubt  I must reproach you could you doubt your Power  And did you doubt my Love But the Request  Is due to my AURELIAN and to Friendship  Enter  MAXIMIAN  MAXIMIAN  Friendship A Commerce between Fools and Knaves  Of sordid Flattery and weak Believing  Had not the gracious Gods in Mercy sav'd you    To  CONSTANTINE  FULVIA  Sav'd him From what  MAXIMIAN  His Friends From the dire Schemes  Of deepest Hell for where where else can Treason  That aims its Dagger at the Life of Princes  Where else can it inhabit  FULVIA  Sir of Treason  That aims its Dagger at the Life of Princes  CONSTANTINE  Why do you thus oppress her Sex's Weakness  You fright her gentle Spirit into Frenzy  FULVIA  to  CONSTANTINE  Now let me claim your Promise Let AURELIAN  Command the Palaceguards Let him assemble  All who are firm to Honour and Allegiance  All who are true to Loyalty  MAXIMIAN  AURELIAN  Command the Palaceguards  FULVIA  Is he not honest  Why do you start Is he not true to Honour  Does he not love my Lord Is he not loyal  MAXIMIAN  So I once thought MARCELLUS He seem'd honest  Of Honour much he talk'd of Friendship much  He was AURELIAN's Friend and much of Loyalty  O CONSTANTINE thy Clemency of Temper  How has it been abus'd Now Sir let Justice  Assume a firmer Spirit As for me  Tho' my own Blood were tainted tho' the Child  Of all my Loveshould she fall off from Goodness  In spite of Nature's powerful Throbbings here  This Hand should vindicate thy Wrongs and mine  CONSTANTINE  What strange Insinuation Can a Father  Delighted view such Images of Horrour  No more my Lord of this mysterious Language  Enter  ALBINUS  Or you ALBINUS give me all the Story  Its every Circumstance its deepest Guilt  ALBINUS  My Lord MAXIMIAN  CONSTANTINE  Why do'st look at him  Why with that Air of Anger and Reproach  ALBINUS  Because it better had become his Wisdom  To thank high Heaven in Silence for your Safety  Than thus to rend your Heart where it must feel  Most sensibly the Pangs of Love and Friendship  CONSTANTINE  Friendship and Love Why are they nam'd with Traytors  In my AURELIAN's Friendship for MARCELLUS  I feel for his Distress But why my Love  They did not dare'tis impious to believe it  They did not dare to violate that Temple  Where Virtue dwells with Beauty But MARCELLUS  What had his Age his Wisdom with such Crimes  Could his AmbitionNo some secret Villain  Of bolder HopesBy Heaven that Look confirms it  Oh give him to my Rage my Vengeance give him  The Justice of my Love  Fulvia  aside  Alas my Father  CONSTANTINE  to  FULVIA  Why do you tremble thus Why does your Eye  Melt into Tears Thy Husband's Love is round thee  His Arms thy soft Security ALBINUS  Give me his Name nor let me ask again  ALBINUS  There is my LordWhy is it mine to name him  In horrid Violation of all Faith  Allegiance Gratitude  FULVIA  to  ALBINUS  ALBINUS stop  This dreadful Preparation Hear him not    To  CONSTANTINE  Or ere you hear resolve no Act of Blood  Shall stain this Day of Triumph Oh let Mercy  Add to its pious Joys an holier Sacrifice  Than could we set Arabia's Hills on Fire  And wast their mingled Odours up to Heaven  CONSTANTINE  Each Moment that delays my just Resentment  Is a new Wrong an Injury to thee    Turning to  ALBINUS  ALBINUS  My Lord  CONSTANTINE  No more nor trifle with my Anger  ALBINUS  Then hearO Virtue Honour hear it not  This Traytor's Namethis Traytor isAURELIAN  CONSTANTINE  Ye sacred Powers of Friendship hover o'er me  MAXIMIAN speak to my astonish'd Spirit  My FULVIA tell me 'tis impossible  Or say what Crimes what Horrors I've committed  That Honour Wisdom Virtue sure AURELIAN  Possess'd them all should arm themselves against me  But shall the Oaths of Traytors they who own'd  The purpos'd Guilt of Murder shall their Oaths  Weigh down a Life of Friendship Tell me Sir  For I will know what Hellinvented Arts  Thus wrong the Man I love  ALBINUS  What Arts my Lord  I hope my Honesty is unsuspected  CONSTANTINE  Who shall be unsuspected Who is honest  If my AURELIAN's false  MAXIMIAN  Here CONSTANTINE  Thy guardian Genius cries aloud beware  No farther tempt your Fate inquire no more  This is the utmost Limit of your Happiness  Here you may stop with Honour all beyond  Is Misery and Shame  CONSTANTINE  looks at  ALBINUS  as commanding him to speak    ALBINUS  Sir I obey you  But 'tis a Tale so full of Fear and Wonder  Perhaps of Falshood too that I could wish  No other Ear might hear it  CONSTANTINE  to  MAXIMIAN  Good my Lord  Leave us alone My FULVIA's gentle Spirit  Will gladly quit the Scene One little Hour    Turning to the Empress  How sadly due to Justice and to Friendship  And all the rest is yours is Love's and yours    He leads her out  MAXIMIAN  aside  'Tis now your Cause ye Gods and see it prospers    As  MAXIMIAN  is going out he seems strongly agitated gazing earnestly after his Daughter    CONSTANTINE  observing it  Starting confus'd The stern MAXIMIAN tremble  While from the fiery Fierceness of his Eye  A Look of wild Compassion at the Empress  Shot forth its Softness  ALBINUS  Tho' MAXIMIAN's Manners  Are of the sterner Kind he has an Heart  No Father softer To behold his Daughter  In such unwonted Agonies of Sorrow  CONSTANTINE  Oh she is all her Sex's Tenderness  I've known her weep to hear a wellfeign'd Tale  Of one who fell from Honour If AURELIAN  If he's a Traytor are they not most lovely  These pious Sorrows of Esteem and Friendship  ALBINUS  Friendship Esteem I thought were manly Virtues  Too firm for Woman's wayward wandering Spirit  But if the Empress Sir  CONSTANTINE  The Empress Sir  Why is she nam'd Why these licentious Hints  Against her Sex Say wherefore is her Name  Insulted with their Weakness with their Frailties  ALBINUS  Insulted Sir Long may you think her virtuous  Long may she live untainted unsuspected  CONSTANTINE  Untainted Unsuspected Think her virtuous  Roman take heed Tho' I believe thee honest  And love that Soldier's Plainness in thy Manners  Yet dare not for thy LifeBy my just Rage  Thy Life shall answer for a Thought that wrongs her  ALBINUS  Sir I obey you gladly for I know not  A greater Curse to any honest Heart  Than to think ill of others  CONSTANTINE  Ill of whom  Not of my Wife my FULVIA Is she not  A noble Proof where Men may see and wonder  At Woman's perfect Worth Still still thy Looks  Are darken'd o'er with some mysterious Mischief  You are a Christian Truth is your Religion  You are a Soldier Honour's your Profession  You were my Father's Friend he lov'd esteem'd you  By his great Name by every sacred Power  If aught be sacred now Allegiance Honour  Let me conjure thee tell me thy worst Meanings  ALBINUS  It was my Sense of Honour and Allegiance  That prompted me thus far Were I a Courtier  I might have learn'd not thus abrupt and bold  With silken Language to have cloth'd my Purpose  But Sir I am a Soldier rough and simple  And now in plain blunt Honesty must tell you  Yet if the distant Fear can shake you thus  Will not the glaring Certainty of Shame  CONSTANTINE  What uninvented unimagin'd Tortures  Have I to dread My Heart is on the Rack▪  ALBINUS  Would I could give it Ease Alas my Lord  You saw MAXIMIAN saw the Agitation  That shook his Frame It was the Father's Fondness  Labouring to disbelieve against Conviction  But such the Proofssure they were strong indeed  If he condemn'd if he could think her guilty  And yet a moment's Pause There is a Circumstance  That throws its Lightits Light of Hope around us  Did she this Morning Sir the Empress ask you  To make AURELIAN Captain of your Guards  CONSTANTINE  She did  ALBINUS  Your Wife your Empress Sir your FULVIA  CONSTANTINE  What means this passion'd Repetition She  FULVIA my Wife  ALBINUS  To place him near your Person  Sure not with much Intreaties  CONSTANTINE  Yes most earnest  ALBINUS  Then Hell's Intelligence is true  CONSTANTINE  Now tell me  Why did you ask  ALBINUS  What did I ask my Lord  In this Confusion Memory no longer  Holds its firm Seat  CONSTANTINE  I'll tell you then You ask'd me  Whether my Wife with strong Intreaties press'd me  To make AURELIAN Captain of my Guards  ALBINUS  Oh my dear Lord forget it lest th' Idea  Murder your sweetest Slumbers and unfix  The seated Throne of Reason for they swore  When sure the Soul speaks Truth in Death's last Pangs  When wide Eternity was opening on them  They swore your Wife had promis'd even with Tears  With every Art and Subtlety of Woman  To make the bold Request  CONSTANTINE  Why wherefore bold  ALBINUS  I cannotmust not tell youSir they swore  That his Attendance on your sacred Person  Might with more Ease more frequent Opportunity  CONSTANTINE  Ha dare not for thy Soul One added Thought  Carries such Ruin such Perdition with it  ALBINUS  And yet what Harm my Lord Their frequent Meetings  No Doubt were pious ones to give Success  To our new Faith and propagate its Doctrines  Such as this Mornbut that perhaps was Zeal  'Twas Friendship's Warmth to tell of your Return  CONSTANTINE  What of this Morning Where What frequent Meetings  ALBINUS  Here in the Palace two full Hours at least  The Empress was in private with AURELIAN  Jocund he seem'd as one who gain'd some Point  Of highest Moment Doubtless then he urg'd  Th' unwary Princess to this bold Request  And such his Form such Shews of manly Virtue  CONSTANTINE  His Form Why that deceive her But this Morning  See her in private two long Hours and more  Leave his Command leave that officious Zeal  With which he ever waited on our Person  Leave them for what For a religious Council  For holy pious Meetings  ALBINUS  Dear my Lord  CONSTANTINE  She was most just most faithful to her Promise  With more than Woman's Arts with Tears Distraction  With frenzy'd Terrors with the Shrieks of Murder  With fancy'd VisionsAll ye Powers of Hell  Where could she learn Where was she practis'd thus  ALBINUS  In Truth 'tis somewhat strange Yet still my Lord  Appearances most probable are oft  Most false Truth is of simpler Kind  And unperplex'd with Circumstance AURELIAN  Has every Shew of Worth is brave and wise  And tho' he lov'd the Empress 'twas before  That Marriage made her yours  CONSTANTINE  Oh well remember'd  Yes we were Rivals once and sure his Passion  Flam'd high as mine impetuous even to Madness  He lov'd to Madnessfor he lov'd like me  Fool that I was dull Fool I thought his Friendship  Conquer'd his Love but oh that Thought how vain  My own Heart proves Amidst these wildest Transports  My Reason hates my Glory sickens at her  Yet still my Soul's in Love With lavish Tongue  She dwelt upon his Praise"The Soldier's Pride  " The rising Hope of Rome"O blushless Wanton  Thy Tears thy Terrours now want no explaining  Nor those strong Cries for Mercy  ALBINUS  Most amazing  Is't possible These Transports for a Woman  A false one too To see you thus afflicted  O'ercomes thy Soldier's Firmness  CONSTANTINE  What Affliction  Thou see'st it not 'Tis in my Heart my Head  'Tis in my Brain Thro' every beating Pulse  It drinks my vital Blood Thro' every Sense  It pours the gushing Sorrow fast upon me  ALBINUS  Had I suspected you could feel it thus  Were it not better have conceal'd her Riots  Her loosest most luxurious  CONSTANTINE  Villain hold  Is this a Scene and for an Husband's Eye  By Hell thou dost insult me Hence begone  Yet stay thy natural Fierceness may assist me  If thou did'st ever know an Art of Cruelty  Or if from Nature thou abhor'st all Mercy  Aid my Revenge▪ and let AURELIAN feel  Arrest him seize him drag him to his Fate  That he may feel if possible the Pangs  That rend my Heart And thou O Jealousy  Invok'd arise from thy profoundest Hell  To no mean Scenes of Horrour art thou call'd  Arise and with thee bring thy kindred Fiends  Revenge and Murder I'll employ them all  Vengeance and Blood O Woman Woman Vengeance    Exeunt  ACT IV  MAXIMIAN ALBINUS  ALBINUS  AND yet such Horrors I have fill'd his Heart with  Methinks even I could pity him See him start  Distraction in his Look and wildest Rage  Even when he weeps for still he weeps her Name  His softest Transport's Madness Then he swears  As with a Moment's Interval of Reason  'Tis all a Lie and with a Lover's Rapture  Talks o'er her Form her Beauties and her Virtue  MAXIMIAN  These Intervals of Reason may be dangerous  ALBINUS  Rather like Lightnings flashing o'er a Storm  They shew the Danger and insure its Terrours  His Jealousy sagacious SelfTormentor  Prevents all farther Witness Every Look  Each trivial Circumstance of Joy or Sadness  That careless Innocence throws off the Heart  Are now by painful Memory treasur'd up  And brought in Proof with Shadows with Suspicions  Light as a Madman's Dreamings  MAXIMIAN  But AURELIAN  How does he brook his Prison  ALBINUS  Struck with Wonder  He saw th' imperial Order to arrest him  Then cried"O CONSTANTINE most gracious Master  " The Hand of Blood is on thee and AURELIAN  " It was my Guilt conceal'd the fatal Secret  " I am indeed thy Murderer" While the Soldiers  Stood wondering round I took him at his Word  And call'd him Murderer with a chosen Party  Then dragg'd him to his Dungeon  MAXIMIAN  There to lie  Where never Sunbeam pierc'd the solid Gloom  Where rattling Chains and Doors that grind the Hinge  To let in new Distress make hideous Concert  There let my Vengeance find him But ALBINUS  The Emperor must not see his Wife  ALBINUS  He shall not  We will not trust his Weakness or her Power  MAXIMIAN  I will not trust his Rage Do not his Passions  Start from his Soul in Tempests Should he kill her  ALBINUS  My Lord he dares not see her Look he comes  Despair and Grief and ShameNo deeper Darkness  Dwells on the Face of Night than on his Heart  Stand and observe him here  Enter  CONSTANTINE  CONSTANTINE  Is there no Cure  For Ills like these No wond'rous Art to heal  These Agonies of Sense To endless Ages  Mark'd out a Thing of VilenessOh my Heart  I must not dare to name Shall all my Glories  They are already lostMy Honours Triumphs  Lost by a Woman's Falshood I who thought her  The Excellence of Virtue as of Beauty  That no unhallow'd ThoughtO Woman Woman  Tainted her Breastto me so icy chaste  My Love's pure Kiss was cold upon her Lip  Even then her hot Imagination glow'd  With lewd luxurious Wishes Hell and Devils  MAXIMIAN  If Duty Sir and Friendship may approach you  CONSTANTINE  talking to himself  Her DeathWhat can her Death Oh poor Attonement  For what I feela thousand Deaths at once  Seeing  MAXIMIAN  Where is my Wife my Wife O Memory  Reflexion Reason ye were given to heal  The wounded Spirit not increase its Anguish  But tell me how she looks Her faded Cheek  Has it not lost that holiest Blush of Innocence  Bear with my WeaknessThere was once a Time  Had Virtue worn the perfect Form of Beauty  Or cloath'd it in an Angel's Robe of Radiance  It would have look'd like her Is she not chang'd  Is she not alter'd much Haste bring her hither    To  ALBINUS  I will myself mark the first Starts of Shame  The guilty Colours that must taint her Cheek  ALBINUS  aside  Oh would he stab her now and give our Cause  With somewhat better Grace to call him Tyrant    Exit  CONSTANTINE  to  MAXIMIAN  as he is going out    Come back my Lord you shall yourself be Witness  Tho' my firm Nerves will tremble when I see her  And my Eye start with Horrour yet unheard  She shall not be condemn'd  MAXIMIAN  Has a Father's Love  Condemn'd his Child and were the Proofs so weak  To need a second Trial Then my Lord  Is your Heart firm Its Beatings all secur'd  Her Eye still holds its Lustre Beauty still  Grows fresh upon her Cheek When she shall weep  When she shall wind her Sorrows round your Heart  When Love's soft Language melting from her Lip  Charms you to hear to pity to believe her  Your Soul may in its Rage reproach upbraid her  And in its Rage forgive her  CONSTANTINE  Ha Forgive her  The very Thought is Insult Oh should Mercy  Fairest of heavenly Beings descend to Earth  Such as when offering to the Throne of Grace  The Sins of Humankind she weeps their Pardon  Here she should weep in vain  MAXIMIAN  aside  This only Means  Ye Powers instruct assist me to preserve her  Your own best Gift But Sir her Fate is mine  And should she die by any other Hand  My great Revenge were lost Could a Plebeian  Assume a Nobleness his Birth denied him  And kill his only Child his lov'd VIRGINIA  To save the humble Honours of his House  And shall MAXIMIAN's Name be stain'd with Vileness  Thro' Ages tainted with a Wanton's Frailty  And shall he trust his Vengeance to another  CONSTANTINE  There is a savage Justice in thy Purpose  Horridly pleasing I allow your Claim  But will you Sir be faithful to your Trust  Search deep into the bosom'd Seats of Pain  Where Life resides Wilt thou when Art grows tir'd  Renew its languid Rage When the keen Sense  Grows dull with suffering wilt thou wake its Feelings  Thro' every trembling Nerve Wilt thou do this  MAXIMIAN  aside  My Lord I will Dear Nature hear it not  Or see the pious Meaning of my Vow  CONSTANTINE  Then take her to your Wrath enjoy her Pangs  And charm me with the Story If the Story  Return my Lord can charm me sure the Sight  Will give a fierce Delight a gloomy Transport  I will assist you Sir Our mutual Wrongs  Shall animate inspire relieve each other  Vary her Pains and draw them slowly out  Then both together strike one Roman Blow  And both run mad for ever  MAXIMIAN  kneeling to  CONSTANTINE  Here my Lord  Behold me kneel this Knee that never bow'd  But to imperial JOVE supreme of Gods  And him the fireey'd Power of War Oh hear me  CONSTANTINE  No every Moment that hath seen her wrong me  Impatient waits for Vengeance  Enter  FULVIA  behind    FULVIA  Ha for Vengeance  My Father on his Knee Then all's discover'd  Now to preserve him or to share his Fate  She kneels on the other Side of  CONSTANTINE  MAXIMIAN  starts and rises    FULVIA  Mercynot Justice is the Throne of Princes  For what is Power tho' boundless and almighty  A Deity of Awefulness and Fear  But in the Whirlwind of its Wrath when flies  The burning Shaft if Mercy's saving Hand  Arrest its Flight then then we kneel and worship  And mix our Praise with Gratitude and Love  CONSTANTINE  to  MAXIMIAN  Did she not talk of Heaven and heavenly Beings  FULVIA  Not hear Not look upon me What's my Crime  To ask his Life The Author of my Being  Is this a Fault Then why great Parent Nature  Why hast thou pour'd with such abundant Hand  Thy filial Instincts thro' the Vast of Air  The howling Desart and the Ocean Stream  Is he not still my Father tho' his Crimes  Be such as CONSTANTINE alone can pardon  For CONSTANTINE is sure the Prince of Mercy  CONSTANTINE  Is it in all the Stories of her Sex  To make this possible Accuse her Father  Add Parricide to Shame  MAXIMIAN  She has discover'd  By some dark Means that all her Guilt is known  And conscious that in me she must expect  A Roman Father's Wrath she would destroy  The Object of her Fears Then boldly hopes  To win the Heart of Love to hear her Vows  To doubt believe forgive  FULVIA  Oh Sir  MAXIMIAN  Away  My Soul disclaims thy Father knows thee not  FULVIA  Take take my Life 'tis yours I here resign  Th' unhappy Gift but Oh in Pity spare  My Innocence my yet untainted Name  Let not our holy Matrons hate my Memory  Or the light Wanton dare by my Example  Indulge her Wanderings By my Mother's Virtue  She was her Sex's Chastity and Honour  Will she not rise in Horrour from her Tomb  Fill the wild Air with shrieking and demand  Her muchwrong'd Daughter's Fame  CONSTANTINE  to  MAXIMIAN  Bid them drag forth  Ling'ring in Death freshbleeding from the Rack  Then fitted for the Arms the base AURELIAN    Exit  MAXIMIAN  Oh all ye Powers immortal see she starts  At Mention of his Name Spite of her Art  Spite of the desperate Spirit of her Sex  When first surpriz'd in Guilt th' unwilling Blush  Glows on her Cheek and flashes from her Heart  FULVIA  No more of Tears no more of Woman's Weakness  In her own Strength my Soul shall take her Flight  Above my Sex's Weakness True I started  At Mention of his Name for then I saw  First saw the dreadful Train of Death and Treason  That spreads around your Life your Fame your Empire  CONSTANTINE  For me thy Fears My Danger For my Fame  Swear itOh could'st thou swear 'till I believ'd thee  FULVIA  Oaths would debase the Dignity of Virtue  Else I could swear by Him the Power who cloth'd  The Sun with Light and gave yon starry Host  Their chaste unsullied Lustre by the Fire  Which burns unceasing on that sacred Altar  Where firstO Memoryour Loves were plighted  CONSTANTINE  If you have aught to plead but Oaths and Tears  Let me not kill thee uncondemn'd unheard  Answer me Speak unhesitating speak  How his Name trembles on my TongueAURELIAN  When did you see him last  FULVIA  This Morning Sir  Some Hours ere your Return  CONSTANTINE  Why Wherefore see him  What for some holy some religious Purpose  Or was it to rejoice for my Return  FULVIA  No thou Insulter no For thy Return  What has it brought me home but Wrongs and Outrage  Yet for AURELIAN's Sake  CONSTANTINE  Ha For his Sake  FULVIA  Sure not for thine who dare insult me thus  I condescend to tell you that he came  In Loyaltyin Friendship to inform me  Of such intended Horrorsthat the Sword  Which ten successive Emperors had worn  Our first great CAESAR wore it and with Glory  For with it Honour Victory and Fame  Were girded on his Thigh  CONSTANTINE  You do not mean  The Sword I gave MAXIMIAN Did I not  Tho' then I mark'd it not yet sure I saw  AURELIAN wear it Was it not a Pledge  Of Friendship to your Father Did he give it  Why For what Purpose give it to AURELIAN  FULVIA  O dire Necessity But I must tell you  Fierce in Resentment of your late Refusal  And burning to resume th' Imperial Throne  Unwillingly resign'dO tell me Nature  How to proceedmay I invoke thy Name  And call my Father Murderer Shall his Child  Open the bloody Volume of the Law  Her Voice call forth the Ministers of Justice  CONSTANTINE  aside  MAXIMIAN's Plots were ever stain'd with Blood  His desperate Ambition his Resentment  But to accuse his Daughter Can her Shame  For it must break my Heartnot torture his  FULVIA  Look thro' my Life is there a Witness there  To vouch this Guilt against me Or can Nature  At once start forward to th' Extremes of Vice  Look thro' the Days thro' every tender Hour  Since first our Loves began did not my Heart  Number with thine its Beatings All its Joys  I shar'd with you its Sorrows were my own  Are these the Proofs of Falshood Even in Justice  Reflect upon AURELIAN's early Worth  CONSTANTINE  Take heed be cautious for you tread on Fires  FULVIA  Is not his Life a Copy drawn from yours  By Friendship's warmest Hand You were his Fame  His Glory his Ambition even his Virtue  When late the Sword of War with swift Descent  Was falling on your Life did not AURELIAN  Oppose his Bosom to the Stroke Is this  Is this to be a Traitor This his Crime  CONSTANTINE  'Tis sacred Reason all and heavenly Truth  If she be falsehow innocent she looks  The Sun is made of Darkness and the Stars  Are rayless as the Dust If she be false  Then Heaven that pour'd these thousand Graces round her  Marrs its own loveliest Work and mocks all Truth  Oh FULVIA whither has my Heart been wandering  From Love and Friendship Happiness and Thee  But Love impatient to resume his Bliss    Embracing her  Rushes with wonted Transports to thy Arms  Nor will he coldly wait to ask Forgiveness  But in the calmer Temper of my Joys  I will implore and kneel and weep for Pardon  Swearing by Beauty's Power no Thought hereafter  Of cursed Jealousy or base Suspicion  Shall stain thy brightest Image in my Heart  FULVIA  Again I melt to Tears the gushing Rapture  Unutterable else breaks forth in weeping  Be these EmbracesOh believe them chaste ones  My worst Resentments these the only Marks  I e'er shall think my Lord was once unkind  CONSTANTINE  Thou Wonder of all Goodness as of Beauty  But now even now

not fled Why should he fly  His Innocence  CONSTANTINE  Oh FULVIA was he innocent  Whence then his Flight  ALBINUS  My Lord we found this Paper  In his Apartment Seeing the Address  We did not dare to open it  CONSTANTINE  "To the Empress"  Why should he write to Her What direful Omen  What Presage this that on my trembling Limbs  Hangs these cold fearful Drops    Reads then lets the Paper drop  FULVIA  What Passion thus  Shakes your firm Frame Your Eye now fix'd in Horror  Stands motionless and now its straining Sense  Starts into Wildness Whence that rending Sigh  Of vehement Distress

save him  " And CONSTANTINE must die This Night he dies"    Throws away the Paper  Ye Powers shall this Intelligence be lost  Angels and Ye who guard the Throne of Princes  This Night be watchful o'er your sacred Charge  This Night with stronger Pinions hover o'er him  Let not Ambition or Revenge approach him  Now now they enter now they rush upon him  Ye conscious Stars that view the impious Scene  Dart all your baleful Influence and blast  Yon lifted Arm But oh the conscious Stars  The smiling Fiends and weeping Angels see it  The Lord of Empire dies    Falls into the Arms of her Attendants and is carried out  ALBINUS  aside  Now by the God  Who thus inspires her 'tis a glorious Vision  Methinks I see it too  Enter  MAXIMIAN  MAXIMIAN  Where is the Emperor  Retir'd to his Apartment  ALBINUS  Yes my Lord  MAXIMIAN  Retir'd alone What hinders then ALBINUS  But that I rush upon him and at once  Strike for Revenge and Empire How th' Idea  Glows thro' my Blood My Rage already stabs him  ALBINUS  My Lord another Hour  MAXIMIAN  Another Hour  What To behold my Daughter at my Feet  Imploring me to save her Fame her Innocence  Thou canst not judge of Nature's Workings here  Thou

Imperial Throne  Suppose it vacantROME hath seen her Emperors  And of no Godlike Strain O Fortune Fortune  If I durst follow where thy Favour leads  Down down thou swelling Spirit proud Ambition  Nor let thy wandering Fires mislead my Reason    Exit  FIFTH ACT  MAXIMIAN  and  ALBINUS  ALBINUS  YOU see the strong Necessity  MAXIMIAN  I do  And thank thy friendly Care  ALBINUS  That Moment's Rashness  It was notless my Lordwith sure Destruction  Had blasted all our Hopes But now your Fortune  Comes smiling forward All your Friends engag'd  To catch th' Alarm and spread its Terrors round  I have dispatch'd MARCELLUS to the Legions  To hold them firm and promise them such Presents  MAXIMIAN  Larger than NERO gave with the rich Plunder  Of this new Town its Temples Shrines and Saints  And all their Worshippers But why MARCELLUS  A Trust of such ImportanceWhy a Christian  A Traitor to his Country and its Gods  ALBINUS  You know my Lord how numerous these Enthusiasts  Thro' all our Troops you know his Influence o'er them  My Life upon his Truth or were he false  He could not hurt us now The Palace ours  Its sleeping CONSTANTINE andhark my Lord    It thunders  Are not the Gods who roll these awful Sounds  Are they not ours  MAXIMIAN  Yes 'Tis the Voice of JOVE  Speaking his own Omnipotence Again  That Peal of Glory These wellomen'd Thunders  Like Drums and Trumpets in the Day of Battle  Shall drown the Cries of Death  ALBINUS  Seize the glad Omen  There lies your Way to Empire and to Fame  Go and return an Emperor  MAXIMIAN  An Emperor  Oh for a Moment to enjoy th' Idea  To see the Roman Senate once the Dread  The Gods of Earth to see the haughty Flatterers  As insolent as abject kneel before me  Then with a Look to kill like CAIUS MARIUS  To nod a Senator to Death or Exile  AURELIAN then thy Perfidy  ALBINUS  My Lord  MAXIMIAN  I thank thee Friend it was an idle Rapture  But yet transporting too Now fare thee well  Tho' my Heart's high in Hope yet should I fail  Be this our last Embrace  ALBINUS  My Lord my Sovereign  MAXIMIAN  Of Friendship and Esteem This pealing Thunder  Calls me again Yes CONSTANTINE I go  To prove whose Gods are mightier yours or mine  Your newly fabled Race or those who rais'd  Old Rome to Glory Ha Look there ALBINUS  Do my Eyes dazzle and my old Brain turn  A stream of sulphur'd FireSee where it rolls  And now 'tis dash'd by a strong Wave of Blood  Spectres and hideous Fiends and shapeless Forms  With ghastly Smiles invite me to go on  And now they dart their Hissings thro' my Brain  ALBINUS  Your agitated Fancy'tis no more  Perhaps some wandering Phantoms of the Night  MAXIMIAN  How little do they know MAXIMIAN's Soul  Were all the Crimes of HumanKind upon it  Thus would I plunge into the burning Wave  And breast the fiery Surge to seize my Vengeance    Exit as to  CONSTANTINE's  Apartment    ALBINUS  What could it mean Such strongly imag'd Terrors  More than Imagination shook his Brain  But all is silent yet Ye rapid Moments  That carry Doubt and Fear upon your Flight  How slowly do ye move What Noise was that  MAXIMIAN  returns    MAXIMIAN  Is there Light i'th' Chamber  ALBINUS  No my Lord  He bad me leave him to his Shame and Darkness    Exit  MAXIMIAN  ALBINUS  Why this Return Was it not most illomen'd  Why did I trust his old unsinewed Arm  I ought myselfit is not yet too late  Should he awakethe double Noise may wake him  By all the Gods MAXIMIAN's Voice and loud  MAXIMIAN  behind the Scenes  This for Ambition this for my Revenge  This for my Daughter's Wrongs  ALBINUS  O glorious Sounds  Worthy the Voice of Jove  Enter  MAXIMIAN  his Sword bloody    MAXIMIAN  'Tis done Behold  The Blood that ere these humbler Christian Doctrines  Drew its rich Stream from Jove  ALBINUS  All hail MAXIMIAN  Master of human Kind  MAXIMIAN  He struggled strongly  For thrice he rose when this old faithful Arm  Not yet by Years nor Idleness enfeebled  Thrice struck my Victim down as in the Field  When younger Spirits filled my glowing Veins  I smote the Gaul who with gigantick Strength  Defied the Tents of Rome  ALBINUS  An Act of Glory  Rome's Annals make immortal But that Sword  AURELIAN gave you in Exchange for yours  Left in the Bed beyond a thousand Witnesses  Will prove the Deed upon him then at Leisure  Under the legal Forms of Public Justice  You may command his Death  MAXIMIAN  I'll leave it there  I brought it forth to see what richer Drops  Fed the proud Heart whose Insolence once aw'd me  Whose Spirit tow'r'd above me Oh ALBINUS  I am almost asham'd even yet to tell you  How oft as if in some superior Presence  My Soul hath bow'd before him and my Blood  Run awstruck to my Heart  ALBINUS  Well has this Night  Repaid his Insolence But now my Lord  Retire to Rest and when th' Alarm begins  Be not too suddenly awak'd Then rouze you  In all your wonted Majesty Assume  Th' Imperial Purple as your proper Right  And join with pious Zeal the Public Sorrows  Order his Funeral with a Pomp of Honours  And rank him with the Gods  MAXIMIAN  This vile Dissembling  When shall my Soul resume its native Greatness  And yet Tiberius blush'd even Nero wept  And mightiest Caesar in his Height of Empire  Trembled with Art before the Roman Talker  Spite of these great Examples let MAXIMIAN  Rise like the Sun and hold his Course of Glory  With Majesty unclouded unobscur'd  Then shew at Evening like the setting God  A larger Orb tho' with less Heat it shine    Exit  ALBINUS  This is the Hour of Rest but not for me  Not 'till another Death secure my Safety  This fond old Man shall for an idle Tear  Drop'd from a Woman's Eye forget my Services  She must not livewhy should the wretched live    Looking at her entering  And such thou arta very Wretch indeed  But thou art near the End of thy Afflictions    Exit  FULVIA CORNELIA  CORNELIA  They were the Groans of Death its sharpest Pangs  And wafted on the hollow Gloom of Night  Broke thro' th' affrighted Air  FULVIA  Then then CORNELIA  The Majesty of Nations and their Praise  Expiring groan'd in Death yet Heaven could roll  Its idle Noise and the pale Lightnings flash'd  Their harmless Fires perhaps with impious Light  Directed to the Deed He died CORNELIA  And thought his FULVIA false  CORNELIA  Ah yet retire  As we advance among these pathless Terrors  Your Eye grows wilder and in broken Pantings  Your quick Breath heaves Should you see aught more dreadful  Will not Imagination catch its Horrors  Strike the weak Sense and fright it into Madness  FULVIA  No my CORNELIA no I'll not run mad  What tho' my Brain's on Fire my glowing Eyes  Just starting from their Orbs and every Sense  Confus'd and wild yet why should I run mad  'Tis not to tear this Hair to shriek with Pain  To rend these Eyeballs from their bleeding Rings  And dash them rayless to their native Earth  That can express my Griefs Why then run mad  CORNELIA  Ye pitying Powers  FULVIA  You talk'd of pathless Terrors  Is not Despair my Guide and see CORNELIA  Faithful it points to yonder open Door  There Treason enter'd there the Man of Blood  And there I'll enter too  Blood Blood CORNELIA See the gory Steps  Where Murder stalk'd along Now now ye Powers  In Mercy Justice Anger Pity strike  This Head devoted lest in desperate Frenzy  I should give Way to Horror and perform  The ever damning Deed of SelfDestruction  Enter  ALBINUS  CORNELIA  to  ALBINUS  If you have ever known where Pity dwells  That drops the tender Tears o'er others' Woes  If you've an human Heart oh Sir assist me  FULVIA  breaking away from  CORNELIA  Or as you seem a Daemon of the Night  Presiding o'er the Terrors you have rais'd  If you know aught of my lov'd Lord Oh tell me  If you are privy to his Death Oh tell me  Give me his mangled Corse deform'd with Wounds  Besmear'd with Blood and Death's own Paleness on it  I'll o'er it play a Scene of such wild Sorrows  Such Frenzy such Distraction as shall charm you  To shed a human Tear and think of Pity  ALBINUS  Of that I question But my present Hours  Have other Cares This Night your Lord your Emperor  Began to be immortal Ere he went  To take his Throne among his kindred Gods  We shall tomorrow deify his Virtues  He left a Present for his muchlov'd FULVIA  That noble Choice of Death  Enter a Soldier with a Dagger and a Bowl of Poison  FULVIA  Oh truly welcome  Thou Freedom of the Soul at whose great Bidding  Th' immortal Spirit wings its gladsome Way  Throws off its Earth and sports without its Weight  In yonder Fields of Light There mine perhaps  May meet my Lord cloth'd with ethereal Brightness  How the World shrinks with all its vast Ambition  Its little Greatness at a Thought like this    Taking the Bowl  Now thou immortal Spirit of my Lord  In whatsoever Orb of Light enthron'd  Look down upon me your suspected FULVIA  This to our second Nuptial Day in Heaven    As she is going to drink  CONSTANTINE  enters with  AURELIAN MARCELLUS  c    Guards seize  ALBINUS  CONSTANTINE  Is it then given me ye allgracious Powers  Once more to gaze upon thy Beauty's Wonders  While Lovefor oh the Rage of Jealousy  Even Madness self was Lovenow cover'd o'er  With Blushes with Confusion kneels before thee    He kneels  FULVIA  Restor'd to Life Can Miracles do this  CONSTANTINE  rises    'Tis he 'tis he My living Lord my Emperor  For oh my Heart I feel thy wonted Transports  Which he alone the Lord of Love inspires  CONSTANTINE  Oh excellent in Goodness My AURELIAN  Behold and wonder at the bright Perfection    To  FULVIA  He too forgives O generous Proof of Friendship  The Outrage to his Virtue See MARCELLUS  And know my Safety thence ALBINUS thought him  Firm to their Cause and sent him to the Legions  To gain their Strength He thence returned at Night  Came by the secret Way to my Apartment  And told to my astonish'd Ears such Horrors  Then begg'd in Proof of his Fidelity  To lay a Slave who was this Morn condemn'd  In th' Imperial Bed MAXIMIAN's Rage  Declares the rest  FULVIA  MAXIMIAN's Sir MAXIMIAN's  CONSTANTINE  pointing to  ALBINUS  Hence with that Slave and bear him to his Fate  ALBINUS  carried out    FULVIA  But Sir my FatherSpeak Oh Look upon me  Oh Hear these speechless Sorrows hear and pity me  CONSTANTINE  With all the fearful Tenderness of Love  With Eyes that flow in Pity with a Tongue  That faulters to pronounce itcan I speak it  The Justice of the World demands his Fate    As commanding him to go  MARCELLUS tho' I know th' ungrateful Office  FULVIA  kneeling  Oh for his Sake th' eternal Power of Mercy  Who when thy great Heart's quell'd by Age or Sickness  Shall hear thy Weakness hear thy Cries of Pain  Give me my Father's Life This Day has join'd  My Fame to his Misfortunes Should he perish  Oh will it not be said that I betray'd him  And can you Sir behold me can you make me  A Name of horrid Parricide for ever  To all succeeding Times Unnumber'd Ages  Shall curse your FULVIA's Memory    To  MARCELLUS  Stay oh stay  I see soft Pity drop the saving Tear    To  MARCELLUS  A little Moment moreand CONSTANTINE  Becomes a God of Mercy  CONSTANTINE  Is there a Strength in Man that can resist  The Power of Beauty when it pleads its Tears  Go my AURELIAN and relieve his Terrors  Sooth his Despair his disappointed Rage  Assure him of his Life nor Life alone  But grac'd with Honors worthy of our Friendship  My FULVIA shall be Mistress of his Fate    Exit  AURELIAN  FULVIA  Angels of Mercy hear the sacred Sounds  That bid my Father live  And thou O Love in all thy golden Records  For it is thine preserve this Act of Wonder  And on thy purple Pinions waft it wide  O'er Earth and Heaven the Glory of thy Reign  Enter  MAXIMIAN  and  AURELIAN  at the Top of the Stage    MAXIMIAN  speaking as he comes forward  Well then the Gods have otherwise decreed  And be it so MAXIMIAN shall appear  I thank thee Jove the Trial's worthy of me  In his own Strength superior to his Fortune  And CAESAR's haughty Clemency    To  AURELIAN  Lead on  FULVIA  My Father  MAXIMIAN  How that Name comes o'er my Heart  She kneels and weeps Art thou so wondrous good  Can'st thou forgive me FULVIA call me Father  And give me back thy Love Did not my Rage  Accuse thy Innocence and blast thy Fame  FULVIA  It was Ambition's Rage no more remember'd  But even Ambition shall be satisfied  Greatness and Power for CONSTANTINE hath spoke it  Duty and Love shall wait upon your Age  'Till Time with lenient Hand shall lay it down  In honourable Death 'till Fame shall crown  Your Life and that last Hour with equal Glory  MAXIMIAN  If Life could pass away in the Delight  Of fondly gazing on thee could th' Idea  Of that full Sway which aw'd the western World  Be ever from my Memory could I forget  I was an Emperor once dispensing Fame  Greatness and Honors round me then perhaps  I might forget I liv'd to be forgiven  And bow'd me to the Power that gave me Life  CONSTANTINE  It shall not need  MAXIMIAN  Indeed my Lord it shall not  MAXIMIAN better shall consult his Glory  Your Father Sir depos'd me not by War  By the fair Fortune of th' embattled Field  But by his better Arts and skill in Treaties  Arts which I boasted not but yet it joy'd  My gloomy Soul to think I should repay them  With equal Vengeance Thence my haughty Spirit  Stoop'd to the Baseness of a midnight Murder  You now would give me Lifeto crown that Gift  An honourable Share of Power and Greatness  Now mark a Generosity above thee  Take from this Hand th' unrival'd Throne of Power  The undivided Empire of the World    Stabs himself  For my last Groan gives you the Universe  CONSTANTINE  Oh FULVIAbut I'll not insult thy Sorrows  By talking Comfort to them Yet remember  Why we are placed thus high not to exempt us  From human Woes but that the World may learn  A nobler Fortitude by our Example  To wake the Soul to Virtue and impart  A warmer Spirit to the languid Heart  The
