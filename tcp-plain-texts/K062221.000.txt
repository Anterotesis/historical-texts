 YARICO TO INKLE AN EPISTLE  By the AUTHOR of the ELEGY  Written among the RUINS of an ABBEY  LONDON  Printed for J DODSLEY in PallMall  MDCCLXVI  Price One Shilling  AN EPISTLE  WITH Falsehood lurking in thy sordid Breast  And Perj'ry's Seal upon thy Heart imprest  Dar'st Thou Oh Christian brave the sounding Waves  The treach'rous Whirlwinds and wideyawning Graves  Regardless of my Woes securely go  No cursefraught Accents from these Lips shall flow  My fondest Wish shall catch thy flying Sail  Attend thy Course and urge the fav'ring Gale  May ev'ry Bliss thy God confers be thine  And all thy Share of Woe compris'd in mine  One humble Boon is all I now implore  Allow these Feet to print their kindred Shore  Give me Oh Albion's Son again to roam  For Thee deserted my delightful Home  To view the Groves that deck my native Scene  The limpid Stream that graceful glides between  Retrieve the Fame I spurn'd at Love's Decree  Ascend the Throne which I forsook for Thee  Approach the Bow'rwhy starts th' unbidden Tear  Where once thy YARICO to Thee was dear  The Scenes the Hand of Time has thrown behind  Return impetuous to my busy Mind  'What hostile Vessel quits the roaring Tide  'To harbour here its tempestbeaten Side  'Behold the Beach receives the shipwreck'd Crew  'Oh mark their strange Attire and pallid Hue  'Are these the Christians restless Sons of Pride  'By Av'rice nurtur'd to Deceit allied  'Who tread with cunning Step the Maze of Art  'And mask with placid Looks a canker'd Heart  'Yet note superior to the num'rous Throng  'Ev'n as the Citron humbler Plants among  'That YouthLo Beauty on his graceful Brow  'With nameless Charms bids ev'ry Feature glow  'Ah leave fair Stranger this unsocial Ground  'Where Danger broods and Fury stalks around  'Behold thy Foes advancemy Steps pursue  'To where I'll screen Thee from their fatal View  'He comes he comes th' ambrosial Feast prepare  'The Fig the Palmjuice nor th' An√¢na spare  'In spacious Canisters nor fail to bring  'The scented Foliage of the blushing Spring  'Ye graceful Handmaids dress the roseate Bow'r  'And hail with Music this auspicious Hour  'Ah no forbearbe ev'ry Lyre unstrung  'More pleasing Music warbles from his Tongue  'Yet utter not to me the Lover's Vow  'All all is thine that Friendship can bestow  'Our Laws my Station check the guilty Flame  'Why was I born ye Powers a Nubian Dame  'Yet see around at Love's enchanting Call  'Stern Laws submit and vain Distinctions fall  'And Mortals then enjoy Life's transient Day  'When smit with Passion they indulge the Sway  'Yes crown'd with Bliss we'll roam the conscious Grove  'And drink long Draughts of unexhausted Love  'Nor Joys alone thy Dangers too I'll share  'With Thee the Menace of the Waves I'll dare  'In vainfor smiles his Brow deep Frowns involve  'The sacred Ties of Gratitude dissolve  'See Faith distracted rends her comely Hair  'His fading Vows while tainted Zephyrs bear'  Oh Thou before whose seraphguarded Throne  The Christians bow and other Gods disown  If wrapt in Darkness thou deny'st thy Ray  And shroud'st from Nubia thy celestial Day  Indulge this fervent Pray'r to Thee address'd  Indulge tho' utter'd from a sable Breast  May gath'ring Storms eclipse the chearful Skies  And mad'ning Furies from thy Hell arise  With glaring Torches meet his impious Brow  And drag him howling to the Gulf below  Ah noMay Heav'n's bright Messengers descend  Obey his Call his every Wish attend  Still o'er his Form their hov'ring Wings display  If he be blest these Pangs admit Allay  Me still her Mark let angry Fortune deem  So thou may'st walk beneath her cloudless Beam  Yet oft to my wrapt Ear didst Thou repeat  That I suffic'd to frame thy Bliss compleat  For Love's pure Flame I took thy transient Fires  We fondly credit what the Heart desires  I hop'd alas to breathe thy native Air  And vie in Splendor with the British Fair  Ascend the speedy Car enchas'd with Gold  With Robes of Silk this pearldeck'd Form infold  Bid on this jetty Hand the Diamond glow  And chosen Rubies sparkle from my Brow  Deluded Sex the Dupes of Man decreed  We splendid Victims at his Altar bleed  The grateful Accents of thy candy'd Tongue  Where artful Flatt'ry too persuasive hung  Like Flow'rs adorn'd the Path to my Disgrace  And bade Destruction wear a smiling Face  Yet form'd by Nature in her choicest Mould  While on thy Cheek her blushing Charms unfold  Who could oppose to Thee stern Virtue's Shield  What tender Virgin would not wish to yield  But Pleasure on the Wings of Time was born  And I expos'd a Prey to grinning Scorn  Of lowborn Tradersmark the Hand of Fate  Is YARICO reduc'd to grace the State  Whose impious Parents an advent'rous Band  Imbrued with guiltless Blood my native Land  Ev'n snatch'd my Father from his regal Seat  And stretch'd him breathless at their hostile Feet  Illfated Prince The Christians sought thy Shore  Unsheath'd the Sword and Mercy was no more  But Thou fair Stranger cam'st with gentler Mind  To shun the Perils of the wrecking Wind  Amidst thy Foes thy Safety still I plan'd  And reach'd for galling Chains the Myrtle Band  Nor then unconscious of the secret Fire  Each Heart voluptuous throb'd with soft Desire  Ah pleasing Youth kind Object of my Care  Companion Friend and ev'ry Name that's dear  Say from thy Mind canst thou so soon remove  The Records pencil'd by the Hand of Love  How as we wanton'd on the flow'ry Ground  The looserob'd Pleasures danc'd unblam'd around  Till to the Sight the growing Burden proy'd  How Thou o'ercam'stand how alas I lov'd  Too fatal Proof since Thou with Av'rice fraught  Didst basely urge ah shun the wounding Thought  That tender Circumstancereveal it not  Lest torn with Rage I curse my fated Lot  Lest startled Reason abdicate her Reign  And Madness revel in this heated Brain  That tender Circumstanceinhuman Part  I will not weep tho' Serpents gnaw this Heart  Frail frail Resolve while gushing from mine Eye  The pearly Drops these boastful Words belie  Alas can Sorrow in this Bosom sleep  Where strikes Ingratitude her Talons deep  When he I still adore to Nature dead  For Roses plants with Thorns the nuptial Bed  Bids from the widow'd Couch kind Peace remove  And cold Indiff'rence blast the Bow'r of Love  What Time his Guardian Pow'r I most requir'd  Against my Fame and Happiness conspir'd  And do I live to breathe the barb'rous Tale  His faithful YARICO expos'd to Sale  Yes basely urg'd regardless of my Pray'rs  Ev'n while I bath'd his venal Hand with Tears  What most for Pity call'dI can no more  My future Childto swell his impious Store  All all Mankind for this will rise thy Foe  But I alas alone endure the Woe  Alone endure the fest'ring Hand of Care  The bleeding Soul and Swoonings of Despair  Was it for this I left my native Plain  And dar'd the Tempest brooding on the Main  For this unlock'd seduc'd by Christian Art  The chaste Affections of my Virgin Heart  Within this Bosom fan'd the constant Flame  And fondly languish'd for a Mother's Name  Lo every Hope is poison'd in its Bloom  And Horrors watch around this guilty Womb  With Blood illustrious circling thro' these Veins  Which ne'er was chequer'd with Plebeian Stains  Thro' Ancestry's long Line ennobled Springs  From famecrown'd Warriors and exalted Kings  Must I the Shafts of Infamy sustain  To Slav'ry's purposes my Infant Train  To catch the Glances of his haughty Lord  Attend obedient at the festive Board  From Hands unscepter'd take the scornful Blow  Uproot the Thoughts of Glory as they grow  Let this pervade at length thy Heart of Steel  Yet yet return nor blush Oh Man to feel  Ah guide thy Steps from yon expecting Fleet  Thine injur'd YARICO relenting meet  Bid her recline woestricken on thy Breast  And hush her raging Sorrows into Rest  Ah let the Youth that sent the cruel Dart  Extract the Point invenom'd from her Heart  The Peace he banish'd from this Mind recall  And bid the Tears he prompted cease to fall  Then while the Stream of Life is giv'n to flow  And sable Hue o'erspread this youthful Brow  Or curl untaught by Art this woolly Hair  So long so long to me shalt Thou be dear  Say lovely Youth flow all my Words in vain  Like Seeds that strew the rude ungrateful Plain  Say shall I ne'er regain thy wonted Grace  Ne'er stretch these Arms to catch the wish'd Embrace  Enoughwith newawak'd Resentment fraught  Assist me Heav'n to tear him from my Thought  No longer vainly suppliant will I bow  And give to Love what I to Hatred owe  Forgetful of the Race from whence I came  With Woe acquainted but unknown to Shame  Hence vile Dejection with thy plaintive Pray'r  Thy bended Knee and still descending Tear  Rejoin rejoin the palecomplexion'd Train  The Conflict's pastand I'm myself again  Thou Parent Sun if e'er with pious Lay  I usher'd in thy worldreviving Ray  Or as thy fainter Beams illum'd the West  With grateful Voice I hymn'd Thee to thy Rest  Beheld with wond'ring Eye thy radiant Seat  Or sought thy sacred Dome with unclad Feet  If near to thy bright Altars as I drew  My votive Lamb thy holy Flamen slew  Forgive That I irrev'rent of thy Name  Dar'd for thy Foe indulge th' unhallow'd Flame  Ev'n on a Christian lavish'd my Esteem  And scorn'd the sable Children of thy Beam  This Poniard by my daring Hand imprest  Shall drin the ruddy Drops that warm my Breast  Nor I alone by this immortal Deed  From Slav'ry's Laws my Infant shall be freed  And Thou whose Ear is deaf to Pity's Call  Behold at length thy destin'd Victim' fall  Behold thy oncelov'd Nubian stain'd with Gore  Unwept extended on the crimson Floor  These Temples clouded with the Shades of Death  These Lips unconscious of the ling'ring Breath  These Eyes uprais'd ere clos'd by Fate's Decree  To catch expiring one faint Glimpse of Thee  Ah then thy YARICO forbear to dread  My fault'ring Voice no longer will upbraid  Demand due Vengeance of the Pow'rs above  Or more offensive still implore thy Love  FINIS
