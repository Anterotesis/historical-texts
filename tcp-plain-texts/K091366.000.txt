POEMS  THE AUTHOR'S APOLOGY  MY works are advertis'd for sale  And censures fly as thick as hail  While my poor scheme of publication  Supplies the dearth of conversation  What will the  World  sayThat's your cry  Who is this  World  and what am I  Once but thank heaven those days are o'er  And persecution reigns no more  One  man  one  hardy man alone  Usurp'd the critic's vacant throne  And thence with neither taste or wit  By powerful catcall from the pit  Knock'd sarce and play and actor down  Who pass'd the sentence thenthe Town  So now each upstart puny elf  Talks of the  world  and means  himself  Yet in the circle there are those  Who hurt e'en more than open foes  Whose friendship serves the talking turn  Just simmers to a kind concern  And with a wond'rous soft expression  Expatiates upon indiscretion  Flies from the Poems to the Man  And gratifies the favourite plan  To pull down other's reputation  And build their own on that foundation  The Scholar grave of taste discerning  Who lives on credit for his learning  And has no better claim to wit  Than carping at what others writ  With pitying kindness friendly fear  Whispers conjectures in your ear  "I'm sorry and he's much to blame  "He might have publish'dbut his name  "The thing might please a few no doubt  "As handed privately about  "It might amuse a friend or two  "Some partial friend like me or you  "But when it comes to press and print  "You'll find I fear but little in't  "He stands upon a dangerous brink  "Who totters o'er the sea of ink  "Where reputation runs aground  "The author cast away and drown'd  "And then'twas wilful and absurd  "So well approv'd so well preferr'd  "Abruptly thus a place to quit  "A place which most his genius hit  "The theatre for Latin wit  "With critics round him chaste and terse  "To give a plaudit to his verse"  Latin I grant shews college breeding  And some schoolcommonplace of reading  But has in  Moderns  small pretension  To real wit or strong invention  The excellence you critics praise  Hangs on a curious choice of phrase  Which pick'd and chosen here and there  From prose or verse no matter where  Jumbled together in a dish  Like Spanish olio fowl flesh fish  You set the classic hodgepodge on  For pedant wits to feed upon  Your wou'dbe Genii vainly seek  Fame from their Latin verse or Greek  Who would for that be most admir'd  Which blockheads may and have acquir'd  A mere mechanical connection  Of favourite wordsa bare collection  Of phraseswhere the labour'd cento  Presents you with a dull memento  How  Virgil Horace Ovid  join  And club together half a line  These only strain their motley wits  In gathering patches shreds and bits  To wrap their barren fancies in  And make a classic Harlequin  Were I at once impower'd to shew  My utmost vengeance on my foe  To punish with extremest rigour  I could inflict no pennance bigger  Than using him as learning's tool  To make him Usher of a school  For not to dwell upon the toil  Of working on a barren soil  And lab'ring with incessant pains  To cultivate a blockhead's brains  The duties there but ill befit  The love of letters arts or wit  For whosoe'er tho' slightly sips  Their grateful flavour with his lips  Will find it leave a smatch behind  Shall sink so deeply in the mind  It never thence can be eras'd  But rising up you call it  Taste  'Twere foolish for a drudge to chuse  A gusto which he cannot use  Better discard the idle whim  What's  He  to  Taste  or  Taste  to  Him  For me it hurts me to the soul  To brook confinement or controul  Still to be pinion'd down to teach  The syntax and the parts of speech  Or what perhaps is drudging worse  The links and joints and rules of verse  To deal out authors by retail  Like penny pots of  Oxford  ale  Oh 'tis a service irksome more  Than tugging at the slavish oar  Yet such  his  task a dismal truth  Who watches o'er the bent of youth  And while a paltry stipend earning  He sows the richest seeds of learning  And tills  their  minds with proper care  And sees them their due produce bear  No joys alas his toil beguile  His  own  lies fallow all the while  "Yet still he's in the road you say  "Of learning"Why perhaps he may  But turns like horses in a mill  Nor getting on nor standing still  For little way his learning reaches  Who reads no more than what he teaches  "Yet you can send advent'rous youth  "In search of letters taste and truth  "Who ride the highway road to knowlege  "Through the plain turnpikes of a college"  TrueLike wayposts we serve to shew  The road which travellers shou'd go  Who jog along in easy pace  Secure of coming to the place  Yet find return whene'er they will  The  Post  and its direction still  Which stands an useful unthank'd guide  To many a passenger beside  'Tis hard to carve for others meat  And not have time one's self to eat  Tho' be it always understood  Our appetites are full as good  "But there have been and proofs appear  "Who bore this load from year to year  "Whose claim to letters parts and wit  "The world has ne'er disputed yet  "Whether the flowing mirth prevail  "In  Wesley  's song or humorous tale  "Or happier  Bourne  's expression please  "With graceful turns of classic ease  "Or  Oxford  's wellread poet sings  "Pathetic to the ear of kings  "These have indulg'd the muse's flight  "Nor lost their time or credit by't  "Nor suffer'd fancy's dreams to prey  "On the due business of the day  "Verse was to them a recreation  "Us'd but by way of relaxation"  Your instances are fair and true  And genius I respect with you  I envy none their honest praise  I seek to blast no scholar's bays  Still let the graceful foliage spread  Its greenest honours round their head  Blest if the Muses' hand entwine  A sprig at least to circle mine  ComeI admit you tax me right  Prudence 'tis true was out of sight  And you may whisper all you meet  The man was vague and indiscreet  Yet tell me while you censure me  Are you from error found and free  Say does your breast no bias hide  Whose influence draws the mind aside  All have their hobbyhorse you see  From Tristram down to you and me  Ambition splendour may be thine  Ease indolence perhaps are mine  Though prudence and our nature's pride  May wish our weaknesses to hide  And set their hedges up before 'em  Some sprouts will branch and straggle o'er 'em  Strive fight against her how you will  Nature will be the mistress still  And though you curb with double rein  She'll run away with us again  But let a man of parts be wrong  'Tis triumph to the leaden throng  The fools shall cackle out reproof  The very ass shall raise his hoof  And he who holds in his possession  The single virtue of discretion  Who knows no overflow of spirit  Whose want of passions is his merit  Whom wit and taste and judgment flies  Shall shake his noddle and  seem  wise  PART OF HOMER'S HYMN TO APOLLO Translated from the Greek  GOD of the Bow Apollo thee I sing  Thee as thou draw'st amain the sounding string  Th' immortal pow'rs revere with homage low  And ev'ry godhead trembles at thy bow  All but Latona She with mighty Jove  Eyes thee with all a tender parent's love  Closes thy quiver thy tough bow unbends  And high amid th' aethereal dome suspends  Then smiling leads thee her allglorious son  To share the mighty Thunderer's awful throne  Goblets of nectar thy glad fire prepares  And thee his fairest noblest son declares  While ev'ry god sits rapt Latona's breast  Beats with superior joy and hails her son confest  Thrice blest Latona from thee Goddess sprung  Diana chaste and Phoebus everyoung  Delos and ortygia are mentioned as different Islands in the original  Her in Ortygia's isle and Him you bore  At Cynthius' hill on Delos' seagirt shore  Where the tall palm uprears its lovely head  And clear Inopus laves the slow'ry mead  O Phoebus where shall I begin thy praise  Well can'st thou rule the poet's artless lays  Oft on the craggy rock or mountain hore  By riverside or on the sea's hoarse shore  Wand'ring wellpleas'd with music's magic sound  And airs divine thou charm'st the region round  Say shall I sing how first on Delos' shore  Thee glorious progeny Latona bore  Here several verses containing nothing but a mere list of the names of Islands are omitted    How first from other isles beset with grief  In vain thy tortur'd mother sought relief  Each to her outcast woe denied abode  Nor durst one isle receive the future god  At length to Delos came the lab'ring fair  And suppliant thus besought her needful care  Delos receive Apollo and O raise  A glorious temple to record his praise  Then shall He govern thee with gentle sway  And only Phoebus shall thine isle obey  What though no flocks nor herds nor juicy vine  Nor plants of thousand natures shall be thine  Swift to the temple of the Bowyerking  Bowyerking  and  Bowyergod  are expressions frequently used by Dryden in his version of the first Iliad to signify Apollo    Oblations rich shall ev'ry nation bring  For ever from thy altars shall arise  The fragrant incense of burntsacrifice  No longer then regret thy barren soil  Receive the God and live by other's toil  She spake with inward rapture Delos smil'd  And sooth'd the suppliant pow'r with answer mild  Latona mighty Caeus' daughter fair  Full willingly wou'd Delos ease thy care  Full willingly behold her barren earth  Witness the glories of Apollo's birth  The mighty God wou'd raise my lowly name  And consecrate his native isle to fame  One fear alone distracts my beating heart  That fear O Goddess list while I impart  Second to none amid th' aethereal skies  Apollo soon all terrible shall rise  All nations shall adore the mighty God  And kings and kingdoms tremble at his nod  Haply for ah dire fears my soul infest  And fill with horror my tumultuous breast  Soon as the glorious Godhead shall be born  My desert region will he view with scorn  Indignant spurn me curse my barren soil  And plunge into the waves my hated isle  Triumphant then to happier climes remove  There fix his shrine plant there his sacred grove  Whelm'd in the briny main shall Delos lay  To all the finny brood a wretched prey  But O Latona if to quell my fear  You'll deign a solemn sacred oath to swear  That here the God his glorious seat shall hold  And here his sapient oracles unfold  Your sacred burthen here Latona lay  Here view the Godhead bursting into day  Thus Delos pray'd nor was her pray'r denied  But soon with solemn vows thus ratified  Witness O heaven and earth O Stygian lake  Dire adjuration that no God may break  In Delos shall Apollo's shrine be rear'd  Delos his best belov'd most honour'd most rever'd  Thus vow'd Latona Delos hail'd her earth  Blest in the glories of Apollo's birth  Nine hapless days and nights with writhing throes  And all the anguish of a mother's woes  Latona tortur'd lay in sorrowing mood  Around her many a sistergoddess stood  Alost in heaven imperial Juno sat  And view'd relentless her unhappy fate  Lucina too the kind assuaging pow'r  That tends the lab'ring mother's childbed hour  And mitigates her woes in golden clouds  High on Olympus' top the Goddess shrouds  Her large full eyes with indignation roll  And livid envy seiz'd her haughty soul  That from Latona's loins was doom'd to spring  So great a son the mighty Bowyerking  The milder pow'rs that near the lab'ring fair  View'd all her pangs with unavailing care  Fair Iris sent the many colour'd maid  To gain with goodly gifts Lucina's aid  But charg'd her heed lest Juno shou'd prevent  With prohibition dire their kind intent  Fleet as the winged winds the flying fair  With nimble pinion cut the liquid air  Olympus gain'd apart she call'd the maid  Then sought with many a pray'r her needful aid  And mov'd her soul when soon with dovelike pace  Swiftly they measur'd back the viewless airy space  Soon as to Delos' isle Lucina came  The pangs of travail seiz'd Latona's frame  Her twining arms she threw the palm around  And prest with deepindented knee the ground  Then into day sprung forth the jolly boy  Earth smil'd beneath and heaven rang with joy  The Sister Pow'rs that round Latona stood  With chaste ablutions cleans'd the infantgod  His lovely limbs in mantle white they bound  And gently drew a golden swathe around  He hung not helpless at his mother's breast  But Themis fed him with an heavenly feast  Pleas'd while Latona views the heavenly boy  And fondly glows with all a mother's joy  The lusty babe strong with ambrosial food  In vain their bonds or golden swathes withstood  Bonds swathes and ligaments with ease he broke  And thus the wondring Deities bespoke  "The lyre and sounding bow and to declare  "The Thund'rer's counsels be Apollo's care"  He spake and onwards all majestic strode  The Queens of Heaven awestruck view'd the God  Delos beheld him with a tender smile  And hail'd enrich'd with gold her happy isle  Her happy isle Apollo's native seat  His sacred haunt his bestbelov'd retreat  Grac'd with Apollo Delos glorious shines  As the tall mountain crown'd with stately pines  Now stony Cynthus wou'd the God ascend  And now his course to various islands bend  Full many a fane and rock and shady grove  River and mountain did Apollo love  But chiefly Delos The Ionians there  With their chaste wives and prattling babes repair  There gladly celebrate Apollo's name  With many a solemn rite and sacred game  The jolly dance and holy hymn prepare  And with the Caestus urge the manly war  If when their sacred feast th' Ionians hold  Their gallant sports a stranger shou'd behold  View the strong nerves the brawny chiefs that brace  Or eye the softer charms of female grace  Then mark their riches of a thousand kinds  And their tall ships born swift before the winds  So goodly to the sight wou'd all appear  The fair assembly Gods he wou'd declare  There too the Delian Virgins beauteous choir  Apollo's handmaids wake the living lyre  To Phoebus first they consecrate the lays  Latona then and chaste Diana praise  Then heroes old and matrons chaste rehearse  And sooth the raptur'd heart with sacred verse  Each voice the Delian maids each human sound  With aptest imitation sweet resound  Their tongues so justly tune with accents new  That none the false distinguish from the true  Latona Phoebus Dian lovely fair  Blest Delian nymphs Apollo's chiefest care  All hail and O with praise your poet crown  Nor all his labours in oblivion drown  If haply some poor pilgrim shall enquire  "O virgins who most skilful smites the lyre  "Whose lofty verse in sweetest descant rolls  "And charms to extasy the hearers souls  O answer a blind bard in Chios dwells  In all the arts of verse who far excells  Then o'er the earth shall spread my glorious fame  And distant Nations shall record my name  But Phoebus never will I cease to sing  Latona's noble son the mighty Bowyerking  Thee Lycia and Maeonia thee great Pow'r  The blest Miletus' habitants adore  But thy lov'd haunt is seagirt Delos' shore  Now Pytho's stony soil Apollo treads  And all around ambrosial fragrance sheds  Then strikes with matchless art the golden strings  And ev'ry hill with heavenly musick rings  Olympus now and the divine abodes  Glorious he seeks and mixes with the Gods  Each heavenly bosom pants with fond desire  To hear the lofty verse and golden lyre  Drawn by the magic sound the VirginNine  With warblings sweet the sacred minstrel join  Now with glad heart loud voice and jocund lays  Full sweetly carol bounteous heaven's praise  And now in dirges sad and numbers slow  Relate the piteous tale of human woe  Woe by the Gods on wretched mortals cast  Who vainly shun affliction's wintry blast  And all in vain attempt with fond delay  Death's certain shaft to ward or chase old age away  The Graces there and smiling Hours are seen  And Cytherea laughterloving queen  And Harmony and Hebe lovely band  To sprightliest measures dancing hand in hand  There of no common port or vulgar mien  With heavenly radiance shines the HuntressQueen  Warbles responsive to the golden lyre  Tunes her glad notes and joins the virgin choir  There Mars and Mercury with awkward play  And uncouth gambols waste the livelong day  There as Apollo moves with graceful pace  A thousand glories play around his face  In splendor drest he joins the festive band  And sweeps the golden lyre with magic hand  Mean while Latona and imperial Jove  Eye the bright Godhead with parental love  And as the Deities around him play  Well pleas'd his goodly mien and awful port survey  The translator when he begun this piece had some thoughts of giving a complete English version of all Homer's Hymns being the only parts of his works never yet translated but to say nothing of his opinion of this specimen of his translation fearing that this species of poetry though it has its beauties and does not want admirers among the learned would appear far less agreeable to the mere English reader he desisted They who would form the justest idea of this sort of composition among the ancients may be better informed by perusing Dr Akenside's most classical Hymn to the Naiads than from any translation of Homer or Callimachus    TO * * * * About to publish a volume of Miscellanies Written in the year  SINCE now all scruples cast away  Your works are rising into day  Forgive though I presume to send  This honest counsel of a friend  Let not your verse as verse now goes  Be a strange kind of measur'd prose  Nor let your prose which sure is worse  Want nought but measure to be verse  Write from your own imagination  Nor curb your Muse by Imitation  For copies shew howe'er exprest  A barren genius at the best  But Imitation's all the mode  Yet where one hits ten miss the road  The mimic bard with pleasure sees  Mat Prior's unaffected ease  Assumes his style affects a story  Sets every circumstance before ye  The day the hour the name the dwelling  And mars a curious tale in telling  Observes how  easy  Prior flows  Then runs his numbers down to prose  Others have sought the filthy stews  To find a dirty

Wherein resembling Milton's Muse  Milton like thunder rolls along  In all the majesty of song  While his low mimics meanly creep  Not quite awake nor quite asleep  Or if their thunder chance to roll  'Tis thunder of the mustard bowl  The stiff expression phrases strange  The epithet's preposterous change  Forc'd numbers rough and unpolite  Such as the judging ear affright  Stop in mid verse Ye mimics vile  Is't thus ye copy Milton's style  His faults religiously you trace  But borrow not a single grace  How few say whence can it proceed  Who copy Milton e'er succeed  But all their labours are in vain  And wherefore soThe reason's plain  Take it for granted 'tis by those  Milton's the model mostly chose  Who can't write verse and won't write prose  Others who aim at fancy chuse  To wooe the gentle Spenser's Muse  This poet fixes for his theme  An allegory or a dream  Fiction and truth together joins  Through a long waste of flimsy lines  Fondly believes his fancy glows  And image upon image grows  Thinks his strong Muse takes wond'rous flights  Whene'er she sings of peerless wights  Of dens of palfreys spells and knights  'Till allegory Spenser's veil  T' instruct and please in moral tale  With him's no veil the truth to shroud  But one impenetrable cloud  Others more daring fix their hope  On rivaling the fame of Pope  Satyr's the word against the times  These catch the cadence of his rhymes  And borne from earth by Pope's strong wings  Their Muse aspires and boldly flings  Her dirt up in the face of kings  In these the spleen of Pope we find  But where the greatness of his mind  His numbers are their whole pretence  Mere strangers to his manly sense  Some few the sav'rites of the Muse  Whom with her kindest eye she views  Round whom Apollo's brightest rays  Shine forth with undiminish'd blaze  Some few my friend have sweetly trod  In Imitation's dangerous road  Long as Tobacco's mild perfume  Shall scent each happy curate's room  Oft as in elbowchair he smokes

And the severity of Taste  Has laid the walk of genius waste  Fancy's a flight we deal no more in  Our authors creep instead of soaring  And all the brave imagination  Is dwindled into declamation  But still you cry in sober sadness  "There is discretion e'en in madness"  A pithy sentence which wants credit  Because I find a poet said it  Their verdict makes but small impression  Who are known liars by profession  Rise what exalted flights it will  True genius will be genius still  And say that horse wou'd you prefer  Which wants a bridle or a spur  The mettled steed may lose his tricks  The jade grows callous to your kicks  Had Shakespeare crept by modern rules  We'd lost his Witches Fairies Fools  Instead of all that wild creation  He'd form'd a regular plantation  A garden trim and all inclos'd  In nicest symmetry dispos'd  The hedges cut in proper order  Nor e'en a branch beyond the border  Now like a forest he appears  The growth of twice three hundred years  Where many a tree aspiring shrouds  Its airy summit in the clouds  While round its root still love to twine  The ivy or wild eglantine  But Shakespeare's allcreative fancy  "Made others love extravagancy  "While cloudcapt nonsense was their aim  "Like Hurlothrumbo's mad lord Flame"  Truewho can stop dull imitators  Those younger brothers of translators  Those insects which from genius rise  And buzz about in swarms like flies  Fashion that sets the modes of dress  Sheds too her influence o'er the press  As formerly the sons of rhyme  Sought Shakespeare's fancy and sublime  By cool correctness now they hope  To emulate the praise of Pope  But Pope and Shakespeare both disclaim  These low retainers to their fame  What task can dulness e'er affect  So easy as to write  correct  Poets 'tis said are sure to split  By too much or too little wit  So to avoid th' extremes of either  They miss their mark and follow neither  They so exactly poise the scale  That neither measure will prevail  And mediocrity the Muse  Did never in her sons excuse  'Tis true their tawdry works are grac'd  With all the charms of modern taste  And every senseless line is drest  In quaint expression's tinsel vest  Say did you never chance to meet  A monsieurbarber in the street  Whose ruffle as it lank depends  And dangles o'er his fingers' ends  His olivetan'd complexion graces  With little dabs of Dresden laces  While for the body Monsieur Puff  Wou'd think e'en dowlas fine enough  So fares it with our men of rhymes  Sweet tinklers of poetic chimes  For lace and fringe and tawdry cloaths  Sure never yet were greater beaux  But fairly strip them to the shirt  They're all made up of rags and dirt  And shall these wretches bards commence  Without or spirit taste or sense  And when they bring no other treasure  Shall I admire them for their measure  Or do I scorn the critic's rules  Because I will not learn of fools  Although Longinus' fullmouth'd prose  With all the force of genius glows  Though Dionysius' learned taste  Is ever manly just and chaste  Who like a skilful wise physician  Diffects each part of composition  And shews how beauty strikes the soul  From a just compact of the whole  Though judgment in Quintilian's page  Holds forth her lamp for ev'ry age  Yet  Hypercritics  I disdain  A race of blockheads dull and vain  And laugh at all those empty fools  Who cramp a genius with dull rules  And what their narrow science mocks  Damn with the name of Het'rodox  These butchers of a poet's fame  While they usurp the critic's name  Cry"This is tastethat's my opinion"  And poets dread their mock dominion  So have you seen with dire affright  The petty monarch of the night  Seated aloft in elbow chair  Command the prisoners to appear  Harangue an hour on watchmen's praise  And on the dire effect of frays  Then cry "You'll suffer for your daring  "And dn you you shall pay for swearing"  Then turning tell th' astonish'd ring  I sit to represent the  KING  The HARE and TORTOISE A FABLE  GENIUS blest term of meaning wide  For sure no term so misapply'd  How many bear thy sacred name  That never felt a real flame  Proud of the specious appellation  Thus fools have christen'd inclination  But yet suppose a genius true  Exempli gratiâ  me or you  Whate'er he tries with due attention  Rarely escapes his apprehension  Surmounting ev'ry opposition  You'd swear he learnt by intuition  Shou'd he rely alone on parts  And study therefore but by starts  Sure of success whene'er he tries  Should he forego the means to rise  Suppose your watch a Graham make  Gold if you will for value sake  Its springs within in order due  No watch when going goes so true  If ne'er wound up with proper care  What service is it in the wear  Some genial spark of Phoebus' rays  Perhaps within your bosom plays  O how the purer rays aspire  If Application fans the fire  Without it Genius vainly tries  Howe'er sometimes it seems to rise  Nay Application will prevail  When braggart parts and Genius fail  And now to lay my proof before ye  I here present you with a story  In days of yore when time was young  When birds convers'd as well as sung  When use of speech was not confin'd  Merely to brutes of human kind  A forward Hare of swiftness vain  The Genius of the neighb'ring plain  Wou'd oft deride the drudging croud  For Geniuses are ever proud  He'd boast his flight 'twere vain to follow  For dog and horse he'd  beat them hollow  Nay if he put forth all his strength  Outstrip his brethren  half a length  A Tortoise heard his vain oration  And vented thus his indignation  Oh Puss it bodes thee dire disgrace  When I defy thee to the race  Come 'tis a match nay no denial  I lay my shell upon the trial  'Twas done and done all fair a bet  Judges prepar'd and distance set  The scamp'ring Hare outstript the wind  The creeping Tortoise lagg'd behind  And scarce had pass'd a single pole  When Puss had almost reach'd the goal  Friend Tortoise quoth the jeering Hare  Your burthen's more than you can bear  To help your speed it were as well  That I should ease you of your shell  Jog on a little faster pr'ythee  I'll take a nap and then be with thee  So said so done and safely sure  For say what conquest more secure  Whene'er he wak'd that's all that's in it  He could o'ertake him in a minute  The Tortoise heard his taunting jeer  But still resolv'd to  persevere  Still drawl'd along as who should say  I'll win like Fabius by delay  On to the goal securely crept  While Puss unknowing soundly slept  The bets were won the Hare awake  When thus the victor Tortoise spake  Puss tho' I own thy quicker parts  Things are not always done by starts  You may deride my awkward pace  But  slow and steady  wins the race  The SATYR and PEDLAR  WORDS are so Wollaston defines  Of our ideas merely signs  Which have a pow'r at will to vary  As being vague and arbitrary  Now  damn'd  for instanceall agree  Damn'd  's the  superlative degree  Means  that  alone and nothing more  However taken heretofore  Damn'd  is a word can't stand alone  Which has no meaning of its own  But signifies or bad or good  Just as its neighbour's understood  Examples we may find enough  Damn'd  high  damn'd  low  damn'd  fine  damn'd  stuff  So fares it too with its relation  I mean its substantive  damnation  The wit with metaphors makes bold  And tells you he's  damnation  cold  Perhaps that metaphor forgot  The selfsame wit's  damnation  hot  And here a fable I remember  Once in the middle of December  When ev'ry mead in snow is lost  And ev'ry river bound with frost  When families get all together  And feelingly talk o'er the weather  Whenpox on the descriptive rhyme  In short it was the winter time  It was a Pedlar's happy lot  To fall into a Satyr's cot  Shiv'ring with cold and almost froze  With pearly drop upon his nose  His fingers' ends all pinch'd to death  He blew upon them with his breath  "Friend quoth the Satyr what intends  "That blowing on thy fingers ends  "It is to warm them thus I blow  "For they are froze as cold as snow  "And so inclement has it been  "I'm like a cake of ice within"  Come quoth the Satyr comfort man  I'll chear thy inside if I can  You're welcome in my homely cottage  To a warm fire and mess of pottage  This said the Satyr nothing loth  A bowl prepar'd of sav'ry broth  Which with delight the Pedlar view'd  As smoaking on the board it stood  But though the very steam arose  With grateful odour to his nose  One single sip he ventur'd not  The gruel was so wond'rous hot  What can be donewith gentle puff  He blows it 'till its cool enough  Why how now Pedlar what's the matter  Still at thy blowing quoth the Satyr  I blow to cool it cries the Clown  That I may get the liquor down  For though I grant you've made it well  You've boil'd it fir as hot as hell  Then raising high his cloven stump  The Satyr smote him on the rump  "Begone thou double knave or fool  "With the same breath to warm and cool  "Friendship with such I never hold  "Who're so  damn'd  hot and so  damn'd  cold  The CIT'S COUNTRY BOX  Vos sapere solos aio bene vivere quorum  Conspicitur nitidis

Grecian lore  While Sophocles his scenes are grown  E'en as familiar as our own  No more shall Taste presume to speak  From its enclosures in the Greek  But all its fences broken down  Lie at the mercy of the town  Critic I hear thy torrent rage  "'Tis blasphemy against that stage  "Which Aeschylus his warmth design'd  "Euripides his taste refin'd  "And Sophocles his last direction  "Stamp'd with the signet of perfection"  Perfection 'tis but a word ideal  That bears about it nothing real  For excellence was never hit  In the first essays of man's wit  Shall  ancient  worth or  ancient  fame  Preclude the Moderns from their claim  Must they be blockheads dolts and fools  Who write not up to Grecian rules  Who tread in buskins or in socks  Must they be damn'd as Heterodox  Nor merit of good works prevail  Except within the classic pale  'Tis stuff that bears the name of knowlege  Not current half a mile from college  Where half their lectures yield no more  Besure I speak of times of yore  Than just a niggard light to mark  How much we all are in the dark  As rushlights in a spacious room  Just burn enough to form a gloom  When Shakespeare leads the mind a dance  From France to England hence to France  Talk not to me of time and place  I own I'm happy in the chace  Whether the drama's here or there  'Tis nature Shakespeare every where  The poet's fancy can create  Contract enlarge annihilate  Bring past and present close together  In spite of distance seas or weather  And shut up in a single action  What cost whole years in its transaction  So ladies at a play or rout  Can flirt the universe about  Whose geographical account  Is drawn and pictur'd on the mount  Yet when they please contract the plan  And shut the world up in a fan  True Genius like Armida's wand  Can raise the spring from barren land  While all the art of Imitation  Is pilf'ring from the first creation  Transplanting flowers with useless toil  Which wither in a foreign soil  As conscience often sets us right  By its interior active light  Without th' assistance of the laws  To combat in the moral cause  So Genius of itself discerning  Without the mystic rules of learning  Can from its present intuition  Strike at the truth of composition  Yet those who breathe the classic vein  Enlisted in the mimic train  Who ride their steed with double bit  Ne'er run away with by their wit  Delighted with the pomp of rules  The specious pedantry of schools  Which rules like crutches ne'er became  Of any use but to the lame  Pursue the method set before 'em  Talk much of order and decorum  Of probability of fiction  Of manners ornament and diction  And with a jargon of hard names  A privilege which dulness claims  And merely us'd by way of fence  To keep out plain and common sense  Extol the wit of antient days  The simple fabric of their plays  Then from the fable all so chaste  Trick'd up in antientmodern taste  So mighty gentle all the while  In such a sweet descriptive stile  While Chorus marks the servile mode  With fine reflection in an ode  Present you with a perfect piece  Form'd on the model of old Greece  Come pr'ythee Critic set before us  The use and office of a chorus  What silent why then I'll produce  Its services from antient use  'Tis to be ever on the stage  Attendants upon grief or rage  To be an arrant gobetween  Chiefmourner at each dismal scene  Shewing its sorrow or delight  By shifting dances left and right  Not much unlike our modern notions  Adagio  or  Allegro  motions  To watch upon the deep distress  And plaints of royal wretchedness  And when with tears and execration  They've pour'd out all their lamentation  And wept whole cataracts from their eyes  To call on rivers for supplies  And with their  Hais  and  Hees  and  Hoes  To make a symphony of woes  Doutless the Antients want the art  To strike at once upon the heart  Or why their prologues of a mile  In simplecall ithumble stile  In unimpassion'd phrase to say  "'Fore the beginning of this play  "I hapless Polydore was found  "By fishermen or others drown'd"  Or "I a gentleman did wed  "The lady I wou'd never bed  "Great Agamemnon's royal daughter  "Who's coming hither to draw water"  Or need the Chorus to reveal  Reflexions which the audience feel  And jog them left attention sink  To tell them how and what to think  Oh where's the Bard who at one view  Cou'd look the whole creation through  Who travers'd all the human heart  Without recourse to Grecian art  He scorn'd the modes of imitation  Of altering pilfering and translation  Nor painted horror grief or rage  From models of a former age  The bright original he took  And tore the leaf from nature's book  'Tis Shakespeare thus who stands alone  But why repeat what  You  have

nature's self will tell  No pleasing pow'rs distortions e'er express  And nicer judgment always loaths excess  In sock or buskin who o'erleaps the bounds  Disgusts our reason and the taste confounds  Of all the evils which the stage molest  I hate your fool who overacts his jest  Who murders what the poet finely writ  And like a bungler haggles all his wit  With shrug and grin and gesture out of place  And writes a foolish comment with his face  Old Johnson once tho' Cibber's perter vein  But meanly groupes him with a num'rous train  With steady face and sober hum'rous mien  Fill'd the strong outlines of the comic scene  What was writ down with decent utt'rance spoke  Betray'd no symptom of the conscious joke  The very man in look in voice in air  And tho' upon the stage appear'd no Play'r  The word and action should conjointly suit  But acting words is labour too minute  Grimace will ever lead the judgment wrong  While sober humour marks th' impression strong  Her proper traits the fixt attention hit  And bring me closer to the poet's wit  With her delighted o'er each scene I go  Wellpleas'd and not asham'd of being so  But let the generous Actor still forbear  To copy features with a Mimic's care  'Tis a poor skill which ev'ry fool can reach  A vile stagecustom honour'd in the breach  Worse as more close the disingenuous art  But shews the wanton looseness of the heart  When I behold a wretch of talents mean  Drag private foibles on the public scene  Forsaking nature's fair and open road  To mark some whim some strange peculiar mode  Fir'd with disgust I loath his servile plan  Despise the mimic and abhor the man  Go to the lame to hospitals repair  And hunt for humour in distortions there  Fill up the measure of the motley whim  With shrug wink snuffle and convulsive limb  Then shame at once to please a trifling age  Good sense good manners virtue and the stage  'Tis not enough the Voice be found and clear  'Tis modulation that must charm the ear  When desperate heroines grieve with tedious moan  And whine their sorrows in a seesaw tone  The same soft sounds of unimpassioned woes  Can only make the yawning hearers doze  The voice all modes of passion can express  That marks the proper word with proper stress  But none emphatic can that actor call  Who lays an equal emphasis on  all  Some o'er the tongue the labour'd measures roll  Slow and delib'rate as the parting toll  Point ev'ry stop mark ev'ry pause so strong  Their words like stageprocessions stalk along  All affectation but creates disgust  And e'en in speaking we may seem  too  just  Nor proper Thornton can those sounds appear  Which bring not numbers to thy nicer ear  In vain for them the pleasing measure flows  Whose recitation runs it all to prose  Repeating what the poet sets not down  The verb disjointing from its friendly noun  While pause and break and repetition join  To make a discord in each tuneful line  Some placid natures fill th' allotted scene  With lifeless drone insipid and serene  While others thunder ev'ry couplet o'er  And almost crack your ears with rant and roar  More nature  and finer strokes are shown  In the low whisper than tempestuous tone  And Hamlet's hollow voice and fixt amaze  More powerful terror to the mind conveys  Than he who swol'n with big impetuous rage  Bullies the bulky phantom off the stage  He who in earnest studies o'er his part  Will find true nature cling about his heart  The modes of grief are not included all  In the white handkerchief and mournful drawl  A single look more marks th' internal woe  Than all the windings of the lengthen'd Oh  Up to the Face the quick sensation flies  And darts its meaning from the speaking Eyes  Love transport madness anger scorn despair  And all the passions all the soul is there  In vain Ophelia gives her flowrets round  And with her straws fantastic strews the ground  In vain now sings now heaves the desp'rate sigh  If phrenzy sit not in the troubled eye  In Cibber's look commanding sorrows speak  And call the tear fast trick'ling down my cheek  There is a fault which stirs the critic's rage  A want of due attention on the stage  I have seen actors and admir'd ones too  Whose tongues wound up set forward from their cue  In their own speech who whine or roar away  Yet seem unmov'd at what the rest may say  Whose eyes and thoughts on diff'rent objects roam  Until the prompter's voice recal them home  Divest yourself of hearers if you can  And strive to speak and be the very man  Why should the wellbred actor wish to know  Who sits above tonight or who below  So 'mid th' harmonious tones of grief or rage  Italian squallers oft disgrace the stage  When with a simp'ring leer and bow profound  The squeaking Cyrus greets the boxes round  Or proud Mandane of imperial race  Familiar drops a curt'sie to her grace  To suit the dress demands the actor's art  Yet there are those who overdress the part  To some prescriptive right gives settled things  Black wigs to murd'rers feather'd hats to kings  But Michael Cassio might be drunk enough  Tho' all his features were not grim'd with snuff  Why shou'd Pol Peachum shine in satin cloaths  Why ev'ry devil dance in scarlet hose  But in stagecustoms what offends me most  Is the slipdoor and slowlyrising ghost  Tell me nor count the question too severe  Why need the dismal powder'd forms appear  When chilling horrors shake th' affrighted king  And guilt torments him with her scorpion sting  When keenest feelings at his bosom pull  And fancy tells him that the seat is full  Why need the ghost usurp the monarch's place  To frighten children with his mealy face  The king alone shou'd form the phantom there  And talk and tremble at the vacant chair  If Belvidera her lov'd loss deplore  Why for twin spectres bursts the yawning floor  When with disorder'd starts and horrid cries  She paints the murder'd forms before her eyes  And still pursues them with a frantic stare  'Tis pregnant madness brings the visions there  More instant horror would enforce the scene  If all her shudd'rings were at shapes unseen  Poet and Actor thus with blended skill  Mould all our passions to their instant will  'Tis thus when feeling Garrick treads the stage  The speaking comment of his Shakespear's page  Oft as I drink the words with greedy ears  I shake with horror or dissolve with tears  O ne'er may folly seize the throne of taste  Nor dulness lay the realms of genius waste  No bouncing crackers ape the thund'rer's fire  No tumbler float upon the bending wire  More natural uses to the stage belong  Than tumblers monsters pantomime or song  For other purpose was that spot design'd  To purge the passions and reform the mind  To give to nature all the force of art  And while it charms the ear to mend the heart  Thornton to thee I dare with truth commend  The decent stage as virtue's natural friend  Tho' oft debas'd with scenes profane and loose  No reason weighs against it's proper use  Tho' the lewd priest his sacred function shame  Religion's perfect law is still the same  Shall They who trace the passions from their rise  Shew scorn her features her own image vice  Who teach the mind it's proper force to scan  And hold the faithful mirror up to man  Shall their profession e'er provoke disdain  Who stand the foremost in the mortal train  Who lend reflection all the grace of art  And strike the precept home upon the heart  Yet hapless Artist tho' thy skill can raise  The bursting peal of universal praise  Tho' at thy beck Applause delighted stands  And lists Briareus' like her hundred hands  Know fame awards thee but a partial breath  Not all thy talents brave the stroke of death  Poets to ages yet unborn appeal  And latest times th' Eternal Nature feel  Tho' blended here the praise of bard and play'r  While more than half becomes the Actor's share  Relentless death untwists the mingled fame  And sinks the player in the poet's name  The pliant muscles of the various face  The mien that gave each sentence strength and grace  The tuneful voice the eye that spoke the mind  Are gone nor leave a single trace behind  To GEORGE COLMAN Esq A FAMILIAR EPISTLE  Written  Jan  From Tiffington in Derbyshire  FRIENDSHIP with most is dead and cool  A dull inactive stagnant pool  Yours like the lively current flows  And shares the pleasure it bestows  If there is ought whose lenient pow'r  Can sooth affliction's painful hour  Sweeten the bitter cup of care  And snatch the wretched from despair  Superior to the sense of woes  From friendship's source the balsam flows  Rich then am I possest of thine  Who know that happy balsam mine  In youth from nature's genuine heat  The souls congenial spring to meet  And emulation's infant strife  Cements the man in future life  Oft too the mind wellpleas'd surveys  Its progress from its childish days  Sees how the current upwards ran  And reads the child o'er in the man  For men in reason's sober eyes  Are children but of larger size  Have still their idle hopes and fears  And HobbyHorse of riper years  Whether a blessing or a curse  My rattle is the love of verse  Some fancied parts and emulation  Which still aspires to reputation  Bad infant fancy plume her flight  And held the laurel full to sight  For vanity the poet's sin  Had ta'en possession all within  And he whose brain is versepossest  Is in himself as highly blest  As he whose lines and circles vie  With heav'ns direction of the sky  Howe'er the river rolls its tides  The cork upon the surface rides  And on Ink's Ocean lightly buoy'd  That cork of vanity is Lloyd  Let  me  too use the common claim  And souse at once upon my name  Which some have done with greater stress  Who know me and who love me less  Poets are very harmless things  Unless you teaze one till he stings  And when affronts are plainly meant  We're bound in honour to resent  And what tribunal will deny  An injur'd person to reply  In these familiar emanations  Which are but writing conversations  Where thought appears in dishabille  And fancy does just what she will  The sourest critic wou'd excuse  The vagrant sallies of the Muse  Which lady for Apollo's blessing  Has still attended our caressing  As many children round her sees  As maggots in a Cheshire cheese  Which I maintain at vast expence  Of pen and paper time and sense  And surely 'twas no small miscarriage  When first I entered into marriage  The poet's title which I bear  With some strange castles in the air  Was all my portion with the fair  However narrowly I look  In Phoebus's  valorum  book  I cannot from enquiry find  Poets had much to leave behind  They had a copyhold estate  In lands which they themselves create  A foolish title to a  fountain  A right of common in a  mountain  And yet they liv'd amongst the great  More than their brethren do of late  Invited out at feasts to dine  Eat as they pleas'd and drank their wine  Nor is it any where set down  They tipt the servants half a crown  But pass'd amid the waiting throng  And pay'd the porter with a song  As once a wag in modern days  When all are in these bribing ways  His shillings to dispense unable  Scrap'd half the fruit from off the table  And walking gravely thro' the croud  Which stood obsequiously and bow'd  To keep the fashion up of tipping  Dropt in each hand a golden pippin  But there's a difference indeed  'Twixt ancient bards and modern breed  Tho' poet known in Roman days  Fearless he walk'd the public ways  Nor ever knew that sacred name  Contemptuous smile or painful shame  While with a foolish face of praise  The folks wou'd stop to gape and gaze  And half untold the story leave  Pulling their neighbour by the sleeve  While th' index of the finger shews  Thereyonder's Horacethere he goes  This finger I allow it true  Points at us modern poets too  But 'tis by way of wit and joke  To laugh or as the phrase is  smoke  Yet there are those who're fond of wit  Altho' they never us'd it yet  Who wits and witlings entertain  Of Taste Virtù and Judgment vain  And dinner grace and gracecup done  Expect a wond'rous deal of fun  YesHe at bottomdon't you know him  "That's He that wrote the last new poem  "His Humour's exquisitely high  "You'll hear him open by and by"  The man in print and conversation  Have often very small relation  And he whose humour hits the town  When copied fairly and set down  In public company may pass  For little better than an ass  Perhaps the fault is on his side  Springs it from modesty or pride  Those qualities asham'd to own  For which he's happy to be known  Or that his nature's strange and shy  And diffident he knows not why  Or from a prudent kind of fear  As knowing that the world's severe  He wou'd not suffer to escape  Familiar wit in easy shape  Left gaping fools and vile repeaters  Should catch her up and spoil her features  And for the child's unlucky maim  The faultless parent come to shame  Well but methinks I hear you say  Write then my friendWrite whata Play  "The theatres are open yet  "The market for all sterling wit  "Try the strong efforts of your pen  "And draw the characters of men  "Or bid the bursting tear to flow  "Obedient to the fabled woe  "With Tragedy's severest art  "Anatomize the human heart  "And that you may be understood  "Bid nature speak as nature shou'd"  That talent George tho' yet untried  Perhaps my genius has denied  While you my friend are sure to please  With all the pow'rs of comic ease  Authors like maids at fifteen years  Are full of wishes full of fears  One might by pleasant thoughts be led  To lose a trifling maidenhead  But 'tis a terrible vexation  To give up with it reputation  And he who has with Plays to do  Has got the devil to go through  Critics have reason for their rules  I dread the censure of your fools  For tell me and consult your pride  Set Garrick for a while aside  How cou'd you George with patience bear  The critic prosing in the play'r  Some of that calling have I known  Who hold no judgment like their own  And yet their reasons fairly scan  And separate the wheat and bran  You'd be amaz'd indeed to find  What little wheat is left behind  For after all their mighty rout  Of chatt'ring round and round about  'Tis but a kind of clockwork talking  Like crossing on the stage and walking  The form of this tribunal past  The play receiv'd the parts all cast  Each actor has his own objections  Each character new imperfections  The man's is drawn too course and rough  The lady's has not smut enough  It want's a touch of Cibber's ease  A higher kind of talk to please  Such as your titled folks would chuse  And Lords and Ladyship's might use  Which stile whoever would succeed in  Must have small wit and much good breeding  If this is dialogue  ma foi  Sweet Sir say I  pardonnez moi  As long as life and business lasts  The actors have their several casts  A walk where each his talents shews  Queens Nurses Tyrants Lovers Beaux  Suppose you've found a girl of merit  Who'd shew your part in all its spirit  Take the whole meaning in the scope  Some little lively thing like Pope  You rob some others of a feather  They've worn for thirty years together  But grant the cast is as you like  To actors which you think will strike  Tomorrow thenbut as you know  I've ne'er a Comedy to shew  Let me a while in conversation  Make free with yours for application  The arrow's flight can't be prevented  Tomorrow then will be presented  The JEALOUS WIFE Tomorrow Right  How do you sleep my friend tonight  Have you no pitpat hopes and fears  Roastbeef and catcalls in your ears  Mabb's wheels across your temples creep  You toss and tumble in your sleep  And cry aloud with rage and spleen  "That fellow murders all my scene"  Tomorrow comes I know your merit  And see the piece's fire and spirit  Yet friendship's zeal is ever hearty  And dreads the efforts of a party  The coach below the clock gone five  Now to the theatre we drive  Peeping the curtain's eyelet through  Behold the house in dreadful view  Observe how close the critics sit  And not one bonnet in the pit  With horror hear the galleries ring  Nosy Black Joke God save the King  Sticks clatter catcalls scream  Encore  Cocks crow pit hisses galleries roar  E'en  cha' some oranges  is found  This night to have a dreadful sound  'Till decent sables on his back  Your prologuizers all wear black  The prologue comes and if its mine  Its very good and very fine  If not I take a pinch of snuff  And wonder where you got such stuff  That done agape the critics sit  Expectant of the comic wit  The fiddlers play again pellmell  But histthe prompter rings his bell  Down there hats offthe curtain draws  What follows isthe just applause  PROLOGUE To the JEALOUS WIFE  Spoken by Mr GARRICK  THE JEALOUS WIFE a Comedy poor man  A charming subject but a wretched plan  His skittish wit o'erleaping the due bound  Commits flat trespass upon tragic ground  Quarrels upbraidings jealousies and spleen  Grow too familiar in the comic scene  Tinge but the language with heroic chime  'Tis Passion Pathos Character Sublime  What round big words had swell'd the pompous scene  A king the husband and the wife a queen  Then might Distraction rend her graceful hair  See sightless forms and scream and gape and stare  Drawcansir death had rag'd without controul  Here the drawn dagger there the poison'd bowl  What eyes had stream'd at all the whining woe  What hands had thunder'd at each  Hah  and  Oh  But peace the gentle prologue custom sends  Like drum and serjeant to beat up for friends  At vice and folly each a lawful game  Our author flies but with no  partial  aim  He read the manners open as they lie  In nature's volume to the general eye  Books too he read nor blush'd to use their store  He does but what his betters did before  Shakespeare has done it and the Grecian stage  Caught truth of character from Homer's page  If in his scenes an honest skill is shewn  And borrowing little much appears his own  If what a master's happy pencil drew  He brings more forward in dramatic view  To your decision he submits his cause  Secure of candour anxious for applause  But if all rude his artless scenes deface  The simple beauties which he meant to grace  If an invader upon others land  He spoil and plunder with a robber's hand  Do justice on himAs on fools before  And give to  Blockheads  past one  Blockhead  more  The Nightingale the Owl and the Cuckow A FABLE  Addressed to DAVID GARRICK Esq On the report of his retiring from the stage Dec  CRITICS who like the scarecrows stand  Upon the poet's common land  And with severity of sense  Drive all imagination thence  Say that in truth lies all sublime  Whether you write in prose or rhyme  And yet the truth may lose its grace  If blurted to a person's face  Especially if what you speak  Shou'd crimson o'er the glowing cheek  For when you throw that slaver o'er him  And tumble out your praise before him  However just the application  It looks asquint at adulation  I would be honest and sincere  But not a flatterer or severe  Need I be surly rough uncouth  That folks may think I love the Truth  And She good dame with Beauty's Queen  Was not at all times naked seen  For every boy with Prior knows  By accident she lost her cloaths  When Falshood stole them to disguise  Her misbegotten brood of lies  Why shou'd the prudish Goddess dwell  Down at the bottom of a well  But that she is in piteous fright  Lest rising up to mortal sight  The modest world shou'd fleer and flout her  With not a rag of cloaths about her  Yet she might wear a proper dress  And keep her essence ne'ertheless  So Delia's bosom still will rise  And fascinate her lover's eyes  Tho' round her ivory neck she draws  The decent shade of specious gauze  I hear it buzz'd about the table  What can this lead toSirs  A FABLE  When Birds allow'd the Eagle's sway  E'er Eagles turn'd to fowls of prey  His Royal Majesty of Air  Took Music underneath his care  And for his queen and court's delight  Commanded Concerts ev'ry night  Here every Bird of Parts might enter  The Nightingale was made Praecentor  Under whose care and just direction  Merit was sure to meet protection  The Lark the Blackbird and the Robin  This concert always bore a bob in  The best performers all were in it  The Thrush Canarybird and Linnet  But Birds alas are apt to aim  At things to which they've smallest claim  The staring Owl with hideous hoot  Offer'd his service for a flute  The Cuckow needs would join the band  "The Thrush is but a paultry hand  "And I can best supply that place  "For I've a shake a swell a grace"  The Manager their suit preferr'd  Both tun'd their pipes and both were heard  Yet each their several praises miss'd  For both were heard and both were hiss'd  The Cuckow hence with rancour stirr'd  A kind of  periodic  bird  Of nasty hue and body scabby  No wouldbe playwright half so shabby  Reviles abuses and defames  Screams from a branch and calls hard names  And strikes at Nightingale or Lark  Like Lisbon russians in the dark  The Owl harangues the gaping throng  On  Pow'rs  and excellence of song  "The Blackbird's note has lost its force  "The Nightingale is downright hoarse  "The Linnet's harsh the Robin shrill  "The Sparrow has prodigious skill"  At length they had what they desir'd  The skilfull Nightingale retir'd  When Folly came with wild Uproar  And Harmony was heard no more  TWO ODES  I take the liberty of inserting the two following Odes though I cannot with strict propriety print them as my own composition The truth is they were written in concert with a friend to whose labours I am always happy to add my own I mean

 The Ideot Moria on the banks of Seine  Unto an antic fool hight Andrew bore  Long she paid him with disdain  And long his pangs in silence he conceal'd  At length in happy hour his lovesick pain  On thy blest Calends April he reveal'd  From their embraces sprung  Ever changing ever ranging  Fashion Goddess ever young  II  Perch'd on the dubious height She loves to ride  Upon a weathercock astride  Each blast that blows around she goes  While nodding o'er her crest  Emblem of her magic pow'r  The light Cameleon stands confest  Changing it's hues a thousand times an hour  And in a vest is she array'd  Of many a dancing moonbeam made  Nor zoneless is her waist  But fair and beautiful I ween  As the cestoscinctur'd Queen  Is with the Rainbow's shadowy girdle brac'd  II  She bids pursue the

blood and youth his lusty veins inspire  From Tottipontimoy He came  Who knows not Tottipontimoy thy name  The bloodyshoulder'd Arab was his Sire  The Author is either mistaken in this place or has else indulged himself in a very unwarrantable poetical licence Whitenose was not the Sire but a Son of the Godolphin Arabian See my Calendar HEBER  His Whitenose He on sam'd Doncastria's plains  Resign'd his fated breath  In vain for life the struggling courser strains  Ah who can run the race with death  The tyrant's speed or man or steed  Strives all in vain to fly  He leads the chace he wins the race  We stumble fall and die  II  Third from Whitenose springs  Pegasus with eagle wings  Light o'er the plain as dancing cork  With many a bound he beats the ground  While all the Turf with acclamation rings  He won Northampton Lincoln Oxford York  He too Newmarket won  There Granta's Son  Seiz'd on the Steed  And thence him led so fate decreed  To where old Cam renown'd in poet's song

assay'd  His hand a taper switch adorns his heel  Sparkles refulgent with elastick steel  The whiles he wins his whiffling way  Prancing ambling round and round  By hill and dale and mead and greenswerd gay  Till sated with the pleasing ride  From the lofty Steed dismounting  He lies along enwrapt in conscious pride  By gurgling rill or crystal fountain  III  Lo next a Bard secure of praise  His selfcomplacent countenance displays  His broad Mustachios ting'd with golden die  Flame like a meteor to the troubled air  Proud his demeanor and his eagle eye  O'erhung with lavish lid yet shone with glorious glare  The grizzle grace  Of bushy peruke shadow'd o'er his face  In large wide boots whose ponderous weight  Would sink each wight of modern date  He rides well pleas'd So

mane  The Courser quits the plain  Alost in air see see him bear  The Bard who shrouds  His Lyrick Glory in the clouds  Too fond to strike the stars with lofty head  He topples headlong from the giddy height  Deep in the Cambrian Gulph immerg'd in endless night  IV  O Steed Divine what daring spirit  Rides thee now tho' he inherit  Nor the pride nor selfopinion  Which elate the mighty Pair  Each of Taste the fav'rite minion  Prancing thro' the desert air  By help mechanick of Equestrian Block  Yet shall he mount with classick housings grac'd  And all unheedful of the Critick Mock  Drive his

name shall live  indeed sir you say true but how infamously how scorn'd and contemn'd in the eyes and ears of the best and gravest Romans that you think not on you never so much as dream of that Are these the fruits of all my travail  and expences Is this the scope and aim of thy studies Are these the hopeful courses wherewith I have so long flattered my expectation from thee Verses Poetry Ovid whom I thought to see the pleader become Ovid the playmaker  Ovid ju  No sir  Ovid se  Yes sir I hear of a tragedy of yours coming forth for the common players there call'd Medea By my housholdgods if I come to the acting of it I'll add one tragic part more than is yet expected to it believe me when I promise it What shall I have my son a stager now an enghle for players a gull a rook a shotclog to make suppers and be laugh'd at Publius I will set thee on the funeral pile first  Ovid ju  Sir I beseech you to have patience  Lup  Indeed Marcus Ovid these players are an idle generation and do much harm in a state corrupt young gentry very much I know it I have not been a tribune thus long and observ'd nothing besides they will rob us us that are magistrates of our respect bring us upon their stages and make us ridiculous  to the plebeians they will play you or me the wisest men they can come by still only to bring us in contempt with the vulgar and make us cheap  Tuc  Th'art in the right my venerable cropshin they will indeed the tongue of the oracle never twang'd truer Your courtier cannot kiss his misstress's slippers in quiet for 'em nor your white innocent gallant pawn his

the rogues libertines flat libertines They forget they are i' the statute the rascals they are blazon'd there there they are trick'd they and their pedigrees they need no other heralds I wiss  Ovid se  Methinks if nothing else yet this alone the very reading of the public edicts should fright thee from commerce with them and give thee distaste enough of their actions But this betrays what a  student you are this argues your proficiency in the Law  Ovid ju  They wrong me sir and do abuse you more That blow your ears with these untrue reports I am not known unto the open stage Nor do I traffick in their theatres Indeed I do acknowledge at request Of some meer friends and honourable Romans I have begun a poem of that nature  Ovid se  You have sir a poem and where is't That's the Law you study  Ovid ju  Cornelius Gallus borrowed it to read  Ovid se  Cornelius Gallus There's another gallant too hath drunk of the same poison and Tibullus and Propertius But these are gentlemen of means and revenues now Thou art a younger brother and hast nothing but thy bare exhibition which I protest shall be bare indeed if thou forsake not these unprofitable bycourses and that timely too Name me a profest poet that his poetry did ever afford him so much as a competency I your god of poets there whom all of  you admire and reverence so much Homer he whose wormeaten statue must not be spewed against but with hallow'd lips and groveling adoration what was he what was he  Tuc  Marry I'll tell thee old swaggerer he was a poor blind rhyming rascal that liv'd obscurely up and down in booths and taphouses and scarce ever made a good meal in his sleep the whoreson hungry beggar  Ovid se  He says well Nay I know this nettles you now but answer me is't not true You'll tell me his name shall live and that now being dead his works have eternis'd him and made him divine but could this divinity feed him while he liv'd could his name feast him  Tuc  Or purchase him a senator's revenue could it  Ovid se  I or give him place in the commonwealth worship or attendants make him be carried in his litter  Tuc  Thou speakest sentences old Bias  Lup  All this the Law will do young sir if you'll follow it  Ovid se  If he be mine he shall follow and observe what I will apt him to or I profess here openly and utterly to disclaim him  Ovid ju  Sir let me crave you will forego these moods I will be any thing or study any thing I'll prove the unfashion'd body of the Law Pure elegance and make her rugged'st strains Run smoothly as Propertius' elegies  Ovid se  Propertius' elegies good  Lup  Nay you take him too quickly Marcus  Ovid se  Why he cannot speak he cannot think out of poetry he is bewitch'd with it  Lup  Come do not misprise him  Ovid se  Misprize I marry I would have him use some such words now they have some touch some taste of the Law He should make himself a stile out of these and let his Propertius' elegies go by  Lup  Indeed young Publius he that will now hit the mark must shoot through the Law we have no other planet reigns and in that sphere you may sit and sing with angels Why the Law makes a man happy  without respecting any other merit a simple scholar or none at all may be a lawyer  Tuc  He tells thee true my noble Neophyte my little grammaticaster he does it shall never put thee to thy mathematicks metaphysicks philosophy and I know not what suppos'd

thou wilt have my favour abandon these idle fruitless studies that so bewitch  witch thee Send Janus home his backface again and look only forward to the law intend that I will allow thee what shall

held loose the reigns of pow'r  The trampled Law had lost its ancient force  And Right confounded miss'd her even course  'Twas thus when VALOIS France's sceptre bore  Scepter'd indeed but now a king no more  Not glory's minion now the voice of fame  Swell'd the loud trumpet to the hero's name  His laurels withered and all blasted now  Which conquest hung upon his infant brow  Whose progress Europe mark'd with conscious fear  Whose loss provoked his country's common tear  When the long train of all his virtues known  The North admiring call'd him to the throne  In second rank the light which strikes the eyes  Rais'd to the first grows dim and feebly dies  From war's stern soldier active firm and brave  He sunk a monarch pleasure's abject slave  Lull'd with soft ease forgetful all of state  His weakness totter'd with a kingdom's weight  While lost in sloth and dead to glorious fame  The sons of riot govern'd in his name  QUELUS St MAIGRIN deathcemented pair  JOYEUSE the gay and D' ESPERNON the fair  The careless king in pleasure plung'd with these  In lust intemperate and lethargic ease  Mean time the GUISES fortunate and brave  Catch'd the fair moment which his weakness gave  Then rose the fatal League in evil hour  That dreadful rival of his waning pow'r  The people blind their sacred Monarch brav'd  Led by those Tyrants who their rights enslav'd  His friends forsook him helpless and alone  His servants chas'd him from his royal throne  Revolted Paris deaf to kingly awe  Within her gates the crouding stranger saw  Through all the city burst rebellion's flame  And all was lost when virtuous BOURBON came  Came full of warlike ardour to restore  That light his prince deluded had no more  His active presence breath'd an instant flame  No longer now the sluggish sons of shame  Onward they press where glory calls to arms  And spring to War from Pleasure's silken charms  To Paris gates both kings advance amain  Rome felt th' alarm and trembled haughty Spain  While Europe watching where the tempest falls  With anxious eyes beheld th' unhappy walls  Within was DISCORD with her hellborn train  Stirring to war the League and haughty MAYNE  The people and the church and from on high  Call'd out to Spain rebellion's prompt ally  DISCORD dread monster deaf to human woe  To her own subjects an avengeful foe  Bloody impetuous eager to destroy  In man's misfortune founds her hateful joy  To neither party ought of mercy shown  Wellpleas'd she stabs the dagger in her own  Dwells a fierce tyrant in the breast she fires  And smiles to punish what herself inspires  West of the city near those borders gay  Where Seine obliquely winds her sloping way  Scenes now where pleasure's soft retreats are found  Where triumphs art and nature smiles around  Then by the will of fate the bloody stage  For war's stern combat and relentless rage  Th' unhappy VALOIS bad his troops advance  There rush'd at once the generous strength of France  A thousand heroes eager for the fight  By sects divided from revenge unite  These virtuous BOURBON leads their chosen guide  Their cause confederate and their hearts allied  It seem'd the army felt one common flame  Their zeal religion cause and chief the sameame  The sacred Louis fire of BOURBON's race  From azure skies beside the throne of grace  With holy joy beheld his future heir  And ey'd the Hero with paternal care  With such as prophets feel a blest presage  He saw the virtues of his ripening age  Saw Glory round him all her laurels deal  Yet wail'd his errors tho' he lov'd his zeal  With eye prophetic he beheld e'en now  The crown of France adorn his royal brow  He knew the wreath was destin'd which they gave  More will'd the Saint the light which shines to save  Still HENRY's steps mov'd onward to the throne  By secret ways e'en to himself unknown  His help from Heaven the Holy Prophet sent  But hid the arm his wise indulgence lent  Left sure of conquest he had slack'd his flame  Nor grappl'd danger for the meed of fame  Already MARS had donn'd his coat of mail  And doubtful Conquest held her even scale  Carnage with blood had mark'd his purple way  And slaughter'd heaps in wild confusion lay  When VALOIS thus his part'ner king addrest  The sigh deepheaving from his anxious breast  "You see what fate what humbling fate is mine  "Nor yet alonethe injury is thine  "The dauntless League by hardy Chieftains led  "Which hisses faction with her Hydra head  "Boldly consederate by a desperate oath  "Aims not at me alone but strikes at both  "Tho' I long since the regal circle wear  "Tho' thou by rank succeed my rightful heir  "Paris disowns us nor will homage bring  "To me their present you their future king  "Thine well they know the next illustrious claim  "From law from birth and deeds of loudest fame  "Yet from that throne's hereditary right  "Where I but totter wou'd exclude thee quite  "Religion hurls her furious bolts on thee  "And holy councils join her firm decree  "ROME tho' she raise no soldier's martial band  "Yet kindles war thro' every awestruck land  "Beneath her banners bids each host repair  "And trusts her thunder to the Spaniard's care  "Far from my hopes each summer friend is flown  "No subjects hail me on my sacred throne  "No kindred now the kind affection shows  "All fly their king abandon or oppose  "Rich in my spoils with greedy treacherous haste  "While the base Spaniard lays my country waste  "Midst foes like these abandon'd and betray'd  "France in her turn shall seek a foreign aid  "Shall Britain's court by secret methods try  "And win ELIZA for a firm ally  "Of old I know between each pow'rful state  "Subsists a jealous and immortal hate  "That London lifts its tow'ring front on high  "And looks on Paris with a rival eye  "But I

"And arm Britannia for an injur'd king  "To Albion hence and let thy happier name  "Plead the king's cause and raise their generous flame  "My foes' defeat upon thy arm depends  "But from thy virtues I must hope for friends"  Thus spoke the king while HENRY's looks confest  The jealous ardour which inflam'd his breast  Left others' arms might urge their glorious claim  And ravish from him half the meed of fame  With deep regret the Hero number'd o'er  The wreaths of glory he had won before  When without succours without skill's intrigue  Himself with CONDE shook the trembling League  When those command who hold the regal sway  It is a subject's virtue to obey  Resolv'd to follow what the King commands  The blows suspended fell not from his hands  He rein'd the ardour of his noble mind  And parting left the gather'd wreaths behind  Th' astonish'd army felt a deep concern  Fate seem'd depending on the Chief's return  His absence still unknown the pentup foe  In dire expectance dread the sudden blow  While VALOIS' troops still feel their hero's flame  And virtue triumphs in her HENRY'S name  Of all his fav'rites none their chief attend  Save MORNAY brave his soul's familiar friend  MORNAY of steady faith and manners plain  And truth untainted with the flatt'rers strain  Rich in desert of valour rarely tried  A virtuous champion tho' on error's side  With signal prudence blest with patriot zeal  Firm to his church and to the public weal  Censor of courtiers but by courts belov'd  Rome's fierce assailant and by Rome approv'd  Across two rocks where with tremendous roar  The foaming ocean lashes either shore  To Dieppe's strong port the Hero's steps repair  The ready sailors ply their busy care  The tow'ring ships old ocean's lordly kings  Aloft in air display their canvas wings  Not swell'd by Boreas now the glassy seas  Flow'd calmly on with Zephyr's gentle breeze  Now anchor weigh'd they quit the friendly shore  And land receding greets their eyes no more  Jocund they sail'd and Albion's chalky height  At distance rose full fairly to the sight  When rumbling thunders rend th' affrighted pole  Loud roar the winds and seas tempestuous roll  The livid lightnings cleave the darken'd air  And all around reigns horror and despair  No partial fear the Hero's bosom knows  Which only trembled for his country's woes  It seem'd his looks toward her in silence bent  Accus'd the winds which cross'd his great intent  So CAESAR striving for a conquer'd world  Near Epire's banks with adverse tempests hurl'd  Trusting undaunted and securely brave  Rome's and the world's fate to the swelling wave  Tho' leagu'd with POMPEY NEPTURE'S self engage  Oppos'd his fortune to dull Ocean's rage  Mean time that GOD whose power the tempest binds  Who rides triumphant on the wings of winds  That GOD whose wisdom which presides o'er all  Can raise protect or crush this earthly ball  From his bright throne beyond the starry skics  Beheld the Hero with considering eyes  GOD was his guide and 'mid the tempest's roar  The tossing vessel reach'd the neighbouring shore  Where Jerfey rises from the ocean's bed  There heavenconducted was the Hero led  At a small distance from the shore there stood  The growth of many years a shadowy wood  A neighbouring rock the calm retirement saves  From the rude blasts and hoarseresounding waves  A grotto stands behind whose structure knows  The simple grace which nature's hand bestows  Here far from court remov'd a holy Sage  Spent the mild evening of declining age  While free from worldly toils and worldly woe  His only study was himself to know  Here mus'd regretting on his mispent days  Or lost in love or pleasure's flowry maze  No gusts of folly swell the dangerous tide  While all his passions to a calm subside  The bubble life he held an empty dream  His food the simple herb his drink the stream  Tranquil and calm he drew his aged breath  And look'd with patience t'ward the port of death  When the pure soul to blissful realms shall soar  And join with GOD himself to part no more  The GOD he worshipp'd ey'd the zealous Sage  And bless'd with wisdom's lore his silver'd age  Gave him the skill of prophecy to know  And from fate's volume read events below  The Sage with conscious joy the Prince address'd  And spread the table for his royal guest  The prompt repast which simple nature suits  The stream's fresh water and the forest's roots  Not unaccustom'd to the homely fare  The Warrior sat for oft from busy care  From courts retir'd and pomp's fastidious pride  The Hero dar'd to throw the king aside  And in the rustic cot wellpleas'd partook  Of labour's mean repast and chearful look  Found in himself the joys to kings unknown  And self depos'd forgot the lordly throne  The world's contention to their minds supplies  Much converse wholsome to the good and wise  Much did they talk of woes in human life  Of Christian kingdoms torn with jarring strife  The zeal of MORNAY like a stubborn fort  Attach'd to Calvin stood his firm support  HENRY still doubting sought th'indulgent skies  That lights' clear ray might burst upon his eyes  "Must then said he the truth be always found  "To mortals weak with mists encompas'd round  "Must I still err my way in darkness trod  "Nor know the path which leads me to my GOD  "If all alike he will'd us to obey  "The GOD who will'd it had prescrib'd the way  "Let us not vainly GOD'S designs explore  "The Sage reply'd be humble and adore  "Arraign not madly heav'n's unerring laws  "For faults where mortals are themselves the cause  "These aged eyes beheld in days of yore  "When Calvin's doctrine reach'd the Gallic shore  "Then tho' with blood it now distains the earth  "Creeping in shade and humble in the birth  "I saw it banish'd by religion's laws  "Without one friend to combat in the cause  "Thro' ways oblique I saw the phantom tread  "Slow winding and asham'd to rear her head  "'Till at the last upheld by pow'rful arms  "'Midst cannon's thunder and 'mid war's alarms  "Burst forth the Monster in the glare of light  "With tow'ring front full dreadful to the sight  "To scoul at mortals from her tyrant seat  "And spurn our altars at her impious feet  "Far then from courts beneath this peaceful cot  "I wail'd Religion's and my Country's lot  "Yet here to comfort my declining days  "Some dawn of hope presents its chearful rays  "So new a worship cannot long survive  "Which man's caprice alone has kept alive  "With that it rose with that shall die away  "Man's works and Man are bubbles of a day  "The GOD who reigns for ever and the same  "At pleasure blasts a world's presumptuous aim  "Vain is our malice vain our strength display'd  "To sap the city his right hand hath made  "Himself hath fix'd the strong foundations low  "Which brave the wreck of time and hell's "inveterate blow  "The Lord of Lords shall bless thy purged sight  "With bright effulgence of diviner light  "On thee Great Prince his mercies he'll bestow  "And shed that Truth thy bosom pants to know  "THAT GOD hath chose thee and his hand alone  "Safe through the war shall lead thee to a throne  "Conquest already for his voice is fate  "For thee bids Glory ope her golden gate  "If on thy sight the Truth unnotic'd falls  "Hope not admission in thy Paris' walls  "Tho' splendid Ease invite thee to her arms  "O shun Great Prince the Syren's poison'd charms  "O'er thy strong passions hold a glorious reign  "Fly love's soft lap break pleasure's silken chain  "And when with efforts strong all foes o'erthrown  "A League's great conqueror and what's more Your "Own  "When with united hearts and triumph's voice  "Thy people hail thee with one common choice  "From a dread siege to fame for ever known  "To mount with glory thy paternal throne  "That time Affliction shall lay by her rod  "And thy glad eyes shall seek thy father's GOD  "Then shalt thou see from whence thy arms prevail  "Go PrinceWHO TRUSTS IN GODcan never "fail"  Each word the Sage's holy lips impart  Falls like a flame on HENRY'S generous heart  The Hero stood transported in his mind  To times when GOD held converse with mankind  When simple virtue taught her heav'nborn lore  And Truth commanding bid e'en kings adore  His eager arms the reverend Sage embrace  And the warm tear fast trickled down his face  Untouch'd yet lost awhile in deep surprise  Stood MORNAY brave for still on MORNAY'S eyes  Hung error's mist and GOD'S high will conceal'd  The gifts from him to HENRY'S breast reveal'd  His wisdom idly wou'd the world prefer  Whose lot tho' rich in virtues was to err  While the wrapt Sage fulfilling GOD'S beheft  Spoke inspiration to the Prince's breast  Hush'd were the winds within their caverns bound  Smooth flow'd the seas and nature smil'd around  The Sage his guide the Hero sought his way  Where the tall vessels safe at anchor lay  The ready sailors quit the friendly strand  Hoist the glad sails and make for Albion's land  While o'er her coast his eyes admiring range  He prais'd in silence Britain's happier change  Where laws abus'd by foul intestine foes  Had erst entail'd a heap of dreadful woes  On prince and people on that bloody stage  Where slaughter'd heroes bled for civil rage  On that bright throne from whence descended springs  Th' illustrious lineage of a hundred kings  Like HENRY long in adverse fortune school'd  O'er willing English hearts a WOMAN rul'd  And rich in manly courage female grace  Clos'd the long lustre of her crouded race  ELIZA then in Britain's happiest hour  Held the just balance of contending pow'r  Made English subjects bow the willing knee  Who will not serve and are not happy free  Beneath her sacred reign the nation knows  No sad remembrance of its former woes  Their flocks securely graz'd the fertile plain  Their garners bursting with their golden grain  The stately ships their swelling sails unfurl'd  Brought wealth and homage from the distant world  All Europe watch'd Britannia's bold decree  Dreaded by land and monarch of the sea  Wide o'er the waves his fleet exulting rode  And fortune triumph'd over Ocean's GOD  Proud London now no more of barbarous fame  To arms and commerce urg'd her blended claim  Her pow'rs in union leagû'd together sate  King Lords and Commons in their threefold state  Though separate each their several interest draw  Yet all united form the stedfast law  All three one body's members firm and fit  Make but one pow'r in strong conjunction knit  Pow'r to itself of danger often found  But spreading terror to its

ToApothecary  WHEN once a man so far is gone  To wet his lips at Helicon  Not all the hellebore which you  Buy in the Lord knows what to do  His head can settle or restore  His reason as it was before  Talk about physic what you will  And magnify the doctor's skill  Mention the names of all the college  Thole shining miracles of knowledge  Or more to justify your praise  Call in the learn'd of former days  Let Mead Friend Boorehave Ratcliffe join  Their mightyknowing heads to thine  Consult together and survey  The whole  Materia Medica  The various powers of med'cine state  And find out virtues or create  Try all old ways if they won't do  Experimentally try new  And when all's ended rest assur'd  Poetic madness can't be cur'd  When haughty Caelia's vain desires  Inflame her brain and fancy fires  When on her bed she sits elate  And takes it for a throne of state  And with a sceptre made of straw  Keeps the subjected world in awe  Or when Clarissa hapless fair  With downcast eye and pensive air  Treads her lone cell and now complains  Of broken vows and perjur'd swains  Now blames her own too easy heart  Which took the base deluder's part  Or when the poet's rowling eye  Proclaims his hour of phrenzy nigh  When on imaginary horse  From pole to pole he takes his course  Or of fantastick trophies proud  Bestrides some easypacing cloud  Or wildly running thro' the streets  Pours couplets out to all he meets  Can Addington with all his care  The shatter'd seat of sence repair  When Madness now my worthy friend  I must insist that you'll attend  For of distinctions fond I'm grown  And so will make one of my own  A nice distinction not a jot  It matters whether true or not  For he proceeds on surest grounds  Who when he can't convince confounds  And to the credit of his brain  Puzzles the cause he can't maintain  When Madness of all sorts and sizes  From bodily disease arises  Whether the blood half froze remains  And scarce moves lab'ring thro' the veins  Or overhot with sanguine pride  Impetuous rolls her rapid tide  If the mind is no more affected  Than as with body 'tis connected  Physic may then of service prove  Abate the grief perhaps remove  But if the body and the brain  Only t'oblige the mind complain  And the distemper's in the heart  It is beyond the reach of art  But to distinguish farther still  Read it or not just as you will  Or if you read commend or blame  To me old boy 'tis all the same  Say if you please perhaps say true  This nothing is to me or you  Or say what observation says  Of many great men nowadays  Of most indeed that I am one  Of great distinction judgment none  But once more to return for this  You'll read in a parenthesis  Tho' I had left you in the dark  By leaving out the usual mark  All kinds of Madness we shall find  Ev'n those which spring out of the mind  More readily a cure admit  Than that which flows from Love of Wit  In other phrenzies pain's endur'd  The patient wishes to be cur'd  If e'er some lucid interval  The scatter'd rays of sense recal  Whereas the poet's highest pleasure  And frequently his only treasure  In Madness lies his joys still vary  Joys real or imaginary  As his head turns and he's most blest  When most with Madness he's possest  Phoebus himself that we may quote  Example of undoubted note  Phoebus who well is known to be  Of Physic God and Poetry  When first he found by symptoms sure  His brain affected thought of cure  Try'd ev'ry way but try'd in vain  To settle his distracted brain  Convinc'd at length that nought would do  The useless drugs aside he threw  And smiling to the list'ning croud  This maxim he declar'd aloud  A maxim since most sacred had  No Poet's  WISE  who is not  MAD  A TALE  VENUS of laughter queen and love  The greatest demirep above  Who scorn'd restriction hated custom  Knew her own sex too well to trust 'em  Proceeded on the noble plan  At any rate to have her man  Look'd on decorum as mere trash  And liv'd like *** and ***  From Paphos where they her revere  As much as we do Caelia here  Or from Cythera where her altars  Are deck'd with daggers truelove halters  Garters yclept and other trophies  Which prove that man in love an oaf is  According to appointment came  To see CAECILIA tuneful dame  Whose praise by Dryden's Ode is grown  Bright and immortal as his own  And who hath been for many years  The chief directress of the spheres  Thomas who rode behind the car  And for a flambeau held a star  Who in the honest way of trade  Hath forg'd more horns and cuckold's made  Than Vulcan and his brawny dolts  Ever for Jove forg'd thunderbolts  Slipt gently down and ran before 'em  Ringing the bell with due decorum  But truth to say I cannot tell  Whether it Knocker was or Bell  This for vertù an anecdote is  Which us'd to give CAECILIA notice  When any lady of the sky  Was come to bear her company  But this I'm sure be which it will  Thomas perform'd his part with skill  Methinks I hear the reader cry  His part with skill why You or I  Or any body else as well  As Thomas sure could ring a bell  Nor did I ever hear before  Of skill in knocking at a door  Poor lowliv'd creature I suppose  Nay and am sure you're one of those  Who at what door soe'er they be  Will always knock in the same key  Thinking that Bell and Knocker too  Were found out nothing else to do  But to inform the house no doubt  That there was somebody without  Who if they might such favour win  Would rather chuse to be within  But had our servants no more sense  Lord what must be the consequence  Error would error still pursue  And strife and anarchy ensue  Punctilio from her altar hurl'd  Whence she declares unto the world  Whate'er by fancy is decreed  Thro' all her niceties must bleed  For if there was not to be found  Some wholesome difference of sound  But the same rap foretold th' approach  Of him who walk'd or rode in coach  A poor relation now and then  Might to my lord admittance gain  When his good lordship hop'd to see  Some rascal of his own degree  And what is more unhappy still  The stupid wretch who brings a bill  Might pass thro' all the motley tribe  As free as one who brings a bribe  My lady too might pique her grace  Wich carriage stiff and formal face  Which she deceiv'd had taken care  For some inferior to prepare  Or might some wretch from Lombardstreet  With greater ease and freedom meet  Than sense of honour will admit  Between my lady and a cit  Those evils wisely to prevent  And root out care and discontent  Ev'ry gay smart who rides behind  With rose and bag in taste refin'd  Must musick fully understand  Have a nice ear and skilful hand  At ev'ry turn be always found  A perfect connoissour in sound  Thro' all the gamut skilful fly  Varying his notes now low now high  According as he shifts his place  Now hoarsely grumbling in the base  Now turning tenor and again  To treble railing his shrill strain  So to declare where'er he be  His master's fortune and degree  By the distinguishing address  Which he'll upon the door express  Thomas whom I have nam'd before  As ringing at CAECILIA'S door  Was perfect master of this art  And vers'd alike in ev'ry part  So that Caecilia knew before  Her footman came unto the door  And in due form had told her so  That Madam VENUS was below  The doors immediate open flew  The GODDESS without more ado  Displaying beauty's thousand airs  Skim'd thro' the hall and trip'd up stairs  CAECILIA met her with a smile  Of great delight when all the while  If her false heart could have been seen  She wish'd she had at Cyprus been  But ladies skill'd in forms and arts  Don't in their faces wear their hearts  And those above like those below  Deal frequently in outside show  And always to keep up parade  Have a smile by them readymade  The forms which ladies when they meet  Must for goodmanners' sake repeat  As  humble servant how d'you do  And in return  pray how are you  Enrich'd at ev'ry proper space  With due integuments of lace  As Madam Grace and Goddeship  Which we for brevity shall skip  Happily past in elbowchair  At length our ladies seated are  Indiff'rent subjects first they chusc  And talk of weather and the news  That done they sit upon the state  And snarl at the decrees of fate  Invectives against Jove are hurl'd  And They alone should rule the world  Dull politicks at length they quit  And by illnature shew their wit  For hand in hand too well we know  These intimates are said to go  So that where either doth preside  T'other's existence is implied  The man of wit so men decree  Must without doubt illnatur'd be  And the illnatur'd scarce forgets  To rank himself among the wits  Malicious VENUS who by rote  Had ev'ry little anecdote  And most minutely could advance  Each interesting circumstance  Which unto all intrigues related  Since Jupiter the world created  Display'd her eloquence with pride  Hinted observ'd enlarged applied  And not the reader to detain  With things impertinent and vain  She did as ladies do on earth  Who cannot bear a rival's worth  In such a way each tale rehearse  As good made bad and bad made worse  CAECILIA too with saintlike air  But lately come from evening pray'r  Who knew her duty as a saint  Always to pray and not to faint  And rain or shine her church ne'er mist  Prude devotee and methodist  With equal zeal the cause promoted  Misconstru'd things and words misquoted  Misrepresented misapplied  And inspiration being her guide  The very heart of man dissected  And to his principles objected  Thus amongst us the sanctified  In all the spirituals of pride  Whose honest consciences ne'er rested  Till of carnalities diverted  They knew and felt themselves t'inherit  A double portion of the spirit  Who from one church to t'other roam  Whilst their poor children starve at home  Consid'ring they may claim the care  Of Providence who sent them there  And therefore certainly is tied  To see their ev'ry want supplied  Who unto preachers give away  That which their creditors should pay  And hold that chosen vessels must  Be generous before they're just  And that their charity this way  Shall bind o'er heaven their debts to pay  And serve their temp'ral turn no doubt  Better than if they'd put it out  Whilst nought hereafter can prevent  Their sure reward of cent per cent  Who honest labour scorn and say  None need to work who love to pray  For heaven will satisfy their cravings  By sending of Elijah's ravens  Or rain down when their spirits fail  A dish of manna or a quail  Who from Moorfields to Tottenham Court  In furious fits of zeal resort  Praise what they do not understand  Turn up the eye stretch out the hand  Melt into tears whilstblows  The twang of nonsense thro' his nose  Ordeals in speculation  Orhums his congregation  Ortalks with the lord of hosts  with pillars and with posts  Who strictly watch lest Satan shou'd  Roaring like lion for his food  Ensnare their feet his fatal trap in  And their poor souls be taken napping  Who strictly fast because they find  The flesh still wars against the mind  And flesh of saints like sinner's must  Be mortified to keep down lust  Who four times in the year at least  Join feast of love to love of feast  Which tho' the profligate and vain  In terms of blasphemy prophane  Yet all the ceremony here is  Pure as the mysteries of Ceres  Who God's elect with triumph feel  Within themselves salvation's seal  And will not must not dare not doubt  That heav'n itself can't blot it out  After they've done their holy labours  Return to scandalize their neighbours  And think they can't serve heav'n so well  As with its creatures filling hell  So that inflam'd with holy pride  They save themselves damn all beside  For persons who pretend to feel  The glowings of uncommon zeal  Who others scorn and seem to be  Righteous in very great degree  Do 'bove all others take delight  To vent their spleen in tales of spite  And think they raise their own renown  By pulling of a neighbour's down  Still lying on with most success  Because they charity profess  And make the outside of religion  Like Mahomet's inspiring pigeon  To all their forgeries gain credit  'Tis enough sure thatsaid it  But what can all this rambling mean  Was ever such a hodgepodge seen  VENUS CAECILIA Saints and Whores  Thomas Vertù

ROSCIAD  IF at a Tavern where you'd wish to dine  They cheat your palate with adulterate wine  Would you resolve me critics for you can  Send for the master up or chide the man  The man no doubt a knavish business drives  But tell me what's the master who connives  Hence you'll infer and sure the doctrine's true  Which says no quarter to a foul Review  It matters not who vends the nauseous slop  Master or prentice we detest the shop  Critics of old a manly liberal race  Approv'd or censur'd with an open face  Boldly persu'd the free decisive task  Nor stabb'd conceal'd beneath a ruffian's mask  To works not men with honest warmth severe  Th' impartial judges laugh'd at hope or fear  Theirs was the noble skill with gen'rous aim  To san true genius to an active flame  To bring forth merit in its strongest light  Or damn the blockhead to his native night  But as all states are subject to decay  The state of letters too will melt away  Smit with the harlot charms of trilling sound  Softness now wantons e'en on Roman ground  Where Thebans Spartans sought their honour'd graves  Behold a weak enervate race of slaves  In classic lore deep science language dead  Tho' modern witlings are but scantly read  Prosessors  The author takes this opportunity notwithstanding all insinuations to the contrary to declare that he has no particular aim at a gentleman whose abilities he sufficiently acknowledges  fail not who will loudly bawl  In praise of either with the want of all  Hail'd mighty critics to this present hour  The tribune's name surviv'd the tribune's pow'r  Now Quack and Critic differ but in name  Empirics frontless both they mean the same  This raw in Physic that in Letters fresh  Both spring like warts excrescence from the flesh  Half form'd half bred in printers' hireling schools  For all professions have their rogues and fools  Tho' the pert witling or the coward knave  Casts no reflection on the wise or brave  Yet in these leaden times this idle age  When blind with dulness or as blind with rage  Author 'gainst author rails with venom curst  And happy He who calls out blockhead first  From the low earth aspiring genius springs  And sails triumphant born on eagle wings  No toothless spleen no venom'd critic's aim  Shall rob thee Churchill of thy proper fame  While hitch'd for ever in thy nervous rhyme  Fool lives and shines out fool to latest time  Pity perhaps might wish a harmless fool  To scape th' observance of the critic school  But if low malice leagu'd with folly rise  Arm'd with invectives and hedg'd round with lies  Should wakeful dulness if she ever wake  Write sleepy nonsense but for writing sake  And stung with rage and piously severe  Wish bitter comforts to your dying ear  If some small wit some fixlin'd verseman rakes  For quaint reflections in the putrid jakes  Talents usurp'd demand a censor's rage  A dunce is dunce proscrib'd in ev'ry age  Courtier physician lawyer parson cit  All all are objects of theatric wit  Are ye then Actors privileg'd alone  To make that weapon ridicule your own  Professions bleed not from his just attack  Who laughs at pedant coxcomb knave or quack  Fools on and off the stage are fools the same  And every dunce is satire's lawful game  Freely you thought where thought has free'st room  Why then apologize for what to whom  Though Gray'sInn wits with author squires unite  And selfmade giants club their labour'd mite  Though pointless satire make its weak escape  In the dull babble of a mimic ape  Boldly pursue where genius points the way  Nor heed what monthly puny critics say  Firm in thyself with calm indifference smile  When the wise Vet'ran knows you by your stile  With critic scales weighs out the partial wit  What I or You or He or no one writ  Denying thee thy just and proper worth  But to give falshood's spurious issue birth  And all selfwill'd with lawless hand to raise  Malicious slander on the base of praise  Disgrace eternal wait the wretch's name  Who lives on credit of a borrow'd fame  Who wears the trappings of another's wit  Or fathers bantlings which he could not get  But shrewd Suspicion with her squinting eye  To truth declar'd prefers a whisper'd lye  With greedy mind the proffer'd tale believes  Relates her wishes and with joy deceives  The World a pompous name by custom due  To the small circle of a talking few  With heartfelt glee th' injurious tale repeats  And sends the whisper buzzing through the streets  The prude demure with sober saintlike air  Pities her neighbour for she's wondrous fair  And when temptations lie before our feet  Beauty is frail and females indiscreet  She hopes the nymph will every danger shun  Yet prays devoutlythat the deed were done  Mean time sits watching for the daily lie  As spiders lurk to catch a simple fly  Yet is not scandal to one sex consin'd  Though men would fix it on the weaker kind  Yes this great lord creation's master man  Will vent his malice where the blockhead can  Imputing crimes of which e'en thought is free  For instance now your Rosciad all to me  If partial friendship in thy sterling lays  Grows all too wanton in another's praise  Critics who judge by ways themselves have known  Shall swear the praise the poem is my own  For 'tis the method in these learned days  For wits to scribble first and after praise  Critics and Co thus vend their wretched stuff  And help out nonsense by a monthly puff  Exalt to giant's forms weak puny elves  And descant sweetly on their own dear selves  For works per month by learning's midwives paid  Demand a puffing in the way of trade  Reserv'd and cautious with no partial aim  My Muse e'er sought to blast another's fame  With willing hand cou'd twine a rival's bays  From candour silent where she cou'd not praise  But if vile rancour from no matter who  Actor or mimic printer or Review  Lies oft o'erthrown with ceaseless venom spread  Still hiss out scandal from their Hydra head  If the dull malice boldly walk the town  Patience herself wou'd wrinkle to a frown  Come then with justice draw the ready pen  Give me the works I wou'd not know the men  All in their turns might make reprisals too  Had all the patience but to read them through  Come to the utmost probe the desperate wound  Nor spare the knife where'er infection's found  But Prudence Churchill or her sister Fear  Whispers forbearance to my fright'ned ear  Oh then with me forsake the thorny road  Left we should flounder in some FleetDitch Ode  And sunk for ever in the lazy flood  Weep with the Naiads heavy

Save your lov'd mistress from a ruffian's rage  See how she gasps and struggles hard for life  Her wounds all bleeding from the butcher's knife  Critics like surgeons blest with curious art  Should

asham'd to bow  To these inscribe my rude but honest lays  And feel the pleasures of my conscious praise  Not that I mean to court each letter'd name  And poorly glimmer from reflected fame  But that

the way  "If wither'd ENVY strive to hurt  "With lies with impudence and dirt  "You only pay a common tax  "Which fool and knave and dunce exacts  "Be this thy comfort this thy joy  "Thy strength is

in this collection and it is now done merely to oblige several subscribers who have particularly desired it  Written in the year  I  AH me unhappy state of mortal wight  Sith Envy's sure attendant upon fame  Ne doth she rest from rancorous despight  Until she works him mickle woe and shame  Unhappy he whom ENVY thus doth spoil  Ne doth she check her ever restless hate  Until she doth his reputation foil  Ah luckless imp is he whose worth elate  Forces him pay this heavy tax for being great  II  There stood an ancient mount yclept Parnass  The fair domain of sacred poesy  Which with fresh odours everblooming was  Besprinkled with the dew of Castaly  Which now in soothing murmurs whisp'ring glides  Wat'ring with genial waves the fragrant soil  Now rolls adown the mountain's steepy sides  Teaching the vales full beauteously to smile  Dame NATURE'S handywork notform'd by lab'ring toil  III  The MUSES fair these peaceful shades among  With skilful fingers sweep the trembling strings  The air in silence listens to the song  And TIME forgets to ply his lazy wings  Palevisag'd CARE with foul unhallow'd feet  Attempts the summit of the hill to gain  Ne can the hag arrive the blissful seat  Her unavailing strength is spent in vain  CONTENT sits on the top and mocks her empty pain  IV  Oft PHOEBUS self left his divine abode  And here enshrouded in a shady bow'r  Regardless of his state lay'd by the God  And own'd sweet music's more alluring pow'r  On either side was plac'd a peerless wight  Whose merit long had fill'd the trump of FAME  This FANCY'S darling child was SPENSER hight  Who pip'd full pleasing on the banks of Tame  That no less sam'd than He and MILTON was his name  V  In these cool bow'rs they live supinely calm  Now harmless talk now emulously sing  While VIRTUE pouring round her sacred balm  Makes happiness eternal as the spring  Alternately they sung now SPENSER 'gan  Of jousts and tournaments and champions strong  Now MILTON sung of disobedient man  And Eden lost The bards around them throng  Drawn by the wond'rous magic of their princes' song  VI  Not far from these Dan CHAUCER antient wight  A lofty seat on Mount Parnassus held  Who long had been the Muses' chief delight  His reverend locks were silver'd o'er with eld  Grave was his visage and his habit plain  And while he sung fair nature he display'd  In verse albeit uncouth and simple strain  Ne mote he well be seen so thick the shade  Which elms and aged oaks had all around him made  VII  Next SHAKESPEARE sat irregularly great  And in his hand a magic rod did hold  Which visionary beings did create  And turn the foulest dross to purest gold  Whatever spirits rove in earth or air  Or bad or good obey his dread command  To his behests these willingly repair  Those aw'd by terrors of his magic wand  The which not all their pow'rs united might withstand  VIII  Beside the bard there stood a beauteous maid  Whose glittering appearance dimm'd the eyen  Her thinwrought vesture various tints display'd  FANCY her name ysprong of race divine  Her mantle  Wimpled  A word used by Spenser for  hung down  The line inclosed within Commas is one of Fairfax's in his translation of Tasso  wimpled low her silken hair  Which loose adown her wellturn'd shoulders stray'd  'She made a net to catch the wanton air'  Whose lovesick breezes all around her play'd  And seem'd in whispers soft to court the heav'nly maid  IX  And ever and anon she wav'd in air  A sceptre fraught with allcreative pow'r  She wav'd it round Eftsoons there did appear  Spirits and witches forms unknown before  Again she lifts her wonderworking wand  Eftsoons upon the flow'ry plain were seen  The gay inhabitants of fairie land  And blithe attendants upon MAB their queen  In mystic circles danc'd along th' inchanted green  X  On th' other side stood NATURC goddess fair  A matron seem'd she and of manners staid  Beauteous her form majestic was her air  In loose attire of purest white array'd  A potent rod she bore whole pow'r was such  As from her darling's works may well be shown  That often with its soulenchanting touch  She rais'd or joy or cause the deepfelt groan  And each man's passions made subservient to her own  XI  But lo thick fogs from out the earth arise  And murky mists the buxom air invade  Which with contagion dire infect the skies  And all around their baleful influence shed  Th' infected sky which whilom was so fair  With thick Cimmerian darkness is o'erspread  The sun which whilom shone without compare  Muffles in pitchy veil his radiant head  And fore the time soregrieving seeks his wat'ry bed  XII  ENVY the daughter of fell Acheron  The flood of deadly hate and gloomy night  Had left precipitate her Stygian throne  And thro' the frighted heavens wing'd her flight  With careful eye each realm she did explore  Ne mote she ought of happiness observe  For happiness alas was now no more  Sith ev'ry one from virtue's paths did swerve  And trample on religion base designs to serve  XIII  At length on blest Parnassus seated high  Their temple circled with a laurel crown  SPENSER and MILTON met her scowling eye  And turn'd her horrid grin into a frown  Full fast unto her Sister did she post  There to unload the venom of her breast  To tell how all her happiness was crost  Sith others were of happiness possest  Did never gloomy hell send forth like ugly pest  XIV  Within the covert of a gloomy wood  Where fun'ral cypress starproof branches spread  O'ergrown with tangling briers a cavern stood  Fit place for melancholy  Drearyhead  Gloominess  drearyhead  Here a deformed monster joy'd to won  Which on fell rancour ever was ybent  All from the rising to the setting sun  Her heart pursued spite with black intent  Ne could her iron mind at human woes relent  XV  In flowing sable stole she was yclad  Which with her countenance did well accord  Forth from her mouth like one thro' grief gone mad  A frothy sea of nauseous foam was ponr'd  A ghastly grin and eyes asquint display  The rancour which her hellish thoughts contain  And how when man is blest she pines away  Burning to turn his happiness to pain  MALICE the monster's name a foe to God and man  XVI  Along the floor black loathsome toads still crawl  Their gullets swell'd with poison's mortal bane  Which ever and anon they spit at all  Whom hapless fortune leads too near her den  Around her waist in place of silken zone  A lifedevouring viper rear'd his head  Who no distinction made 'twixt friend and foen  But death on ev'ry side fierce brandished  Fly reckless mortals fly in vain is  Hardyhead  Courage  hardyhead  XVII  Impatient ENVY thro' th' aetherial waste  With inward venom fraught and deadly spite  Unto this cavern steer'd her panting haste  Enshrouded in a darksome veil of night  Her inmost heart burnt with impetuous ire  And fell destruction sparkled in her look  Her ferret eyes flash'd with revengeful fire  A while contending passions utt'rance choke  At length the fiend in furious tone her silence broke  XVIII  Sister arise see how our pow'r decays  No more our empire Thou and I can boast  Sith mortal man now gains immortal praise  Sith man is blest and Thou and I are lost  See in what state Parnassus' Hill appears  See PHOEBUS' self two happy bards atween  See how the God their song attentive hears  This SPENSER hight that MILTON well I ween  Who can behold unmov'd sike hearttormenting scene  XIX  Sister arise ne let our courage droop  Perforce we will compel these mortals own  That mortal force unto our force shall stoop  ENVY and MALICE then shall reign alone  Thou best has known to file thy tongue with lies  And to deceive mankind with specious bait  Like TRUTH accoutred spreadest forgeries  The fountain of contention and of hate  Arise unite with me and be as whilom great  XX  The Fiend obey'd and with impatient voice  "Tremble ye bards within that blissful feat  "MALICE and ENVY shall o'erthrow your joys  "Nor PHOEBUS self shall our designs defeat  "Shall We who under friendship's seigned veil  "Prompted the bold archangel to rebel  "Shall we Who under show of sacred zeal  "Plung'd half the pow'rs of heav'n in lowest hell  "Such vile disgrace of us no mortal man shall tell  XXI  And now more hideous render'd to the sight  By reason of her raging cruelty  She burnt to go equipt in dreadful plight  And find fit engine for her forgery  Her eyes inflam'd did cast their rays askance  While hellish imps prepare the monster's car  In which she might cut thro' the wide expanse  And find out nations that extended far  When all was pitchy dark ne twinkled one bright star  XXII  Black was her chariot drawn by dragons dire  And each fell serpent had a double tongue  Which ever and anon spit flaming fire  The regions of the tainted air among  A lofty seat the sistermonsters bore  In deadly machinations close combin'd  Dull FOLLY drove with terrible uproar  And cruel DISCORD follow'd fast behind  God help the man 'gainst whomsuch caitiff foes are join'd  XXIII  Aloft in air the rattling chariot flies  While thunder harshly grates upon its wheels  Black pointed spires of smoke around them rise  The air depress'd unusual burthen feels  Detested sight in terrible array  They spur their fiery dragons on amain  Ne mote their anger suffer cold delay  Until the wish'dfor region they obtain  And land their dingy car on Caledonian plain  XXIV  Here eldest son of MALICE long had dwelt  A wretch of all the joys of life forlorn  His fame on double falsities was built  Ah worthless son of worthless parent born  Under the shew of semblance fair he veil'd  The black intentions of his hellish breast  And by these guileful means he more prevail'd  Than had he open enmity profest drest  The wolf more safely wounds when in sheep's cloathing  XXV  Him then themselves at ween they joyful place  Sure sign of woe when such are pleas'd alas  Then measure back the air with swifter pace  Until they reach the foot of Mount Parnass  Hither in evil hour the monsters came  And with their new companion did alight  Who long had lost all sense of virtuous shame  Beholding worth with poisonous despight  On his success depends their impious delight  XXVI  Long burnt He sore the summit to obtain  And spread his venom o'er the blissful seat  Long burnt He sore but still He burnt in vain  Mote none come there who come with impious feet  At lenth at unawares he out doth spit  That spite which else had to himself been bane  The venom on the breast of MILTON lit  And spread benumbing death thro' every vein  The Bard of life bereft fell senseless on the plain  XXVII  As at the banquet of Thyestes old  The sun is faid t' have shut his radiant eye  So did he now thro' grief his beams withhold  And darkness to be felt o'erwhelm'd the sky  Forth issued from their dismal dirk abodes  The birds attendant upon hideous night  Shriekowls and ravens whose fell croaking bodes  Approaching death to miserable wight  Did never mind of man behold sike dreadful sight  XXVIII  APOLLO wails his darling done to die  By foul attempt of ENVY'S fatal bane  The MUSES sprinkle him with dew of Castaly  And crown his death with many a living strain  Hoary PARNASSUS beats his aged breast  Aged yet ne'er before did sorrow know  The flowers drooping their despair attest  Th' aggrieved rivers querulously flow  All nature sudden groan'd with sympathetic woe  XXIX  But lo the sky a gayer livery wears  The melting clouds begin to fade apace  And now the cloak of darkness disappears  May darkness ever thus to light give place  Erst griev'd APOLLO jocund looks resumes  The NINE renew their whilom chearful song  No grief PARNASSUS' aged breast consumes  Forth from the teeming earth new flowers sprong  The plenteous rivers flow'd full peacefully along  XXX  The stricken Bard fresh vital heat renews  Whose blood erst stagnate rushes thro' his veins  Life thro' each pore her spirit doth infuse  And FAME by MALICE unextinguish'd reigns  And see a Form breaks forth all heav'nly bright  Upheld by one of mortal progeny  A Female Form yclad in snowy white  Ne half so fair at distance seen as nigh  DOUGLAS and TRUTH appear ENVY and LAUDER die  POEMATA  PROLOGUS  EST Schola Rhetorices celebrat quam crebra juventus  Et tumido inflatos ejicit ore sonos  Quà quisque assumit tragicas

And leaves the world to darkness and to me  Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight  And all the air a solemn stillness holds  Save where the beetle wheels his drony flight  And drowsy

heap the shrine of luxury and pride  With incense kindled at the Muse's flame  Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife  Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray  Along the cool sequester'd vale of life  They kept the noiseless tenor of their way  Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protect  Some frail memorial still erected nigh  With uncouth rhimes and shapeless sculpture deck'd  Implores the passing tribute of a sigh  Their name their years spelt by th' unletter'd Muse  The place of fame and elegy supply  And many a holy text around she strews  That teach the rustic moralist to die

longing ling'ring look behind  On some fond breast the parting soul relies  Some pious drops the closing eye requires  Ev'n from the tomb the voice of nature cries  Ev'n in our ashes live their wonted fires  For thee who mindful of th' unhonour'd dead  Dost in these lines their artless tale relate  If chance by lonely contemplation led  Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate  Haply some hoaryheaded swain may say  "Oft have we see him at the peep of dawn  "Brushing with hasty steps the dews away  "To meet the sun upon the upland lawn  Heu quis enim dubiâ hâc dulcique excedere vitâ

auspicious nuptials the following little piece was written merely with a view of manifesting such their loyalty and gratitude to the best of monarchs and most candid encourager of theatrical exhibitions The reader as well as the spectator will easily discover that the author has paid but little attention to the nature of dramatic composition in the conduct of this piece and indeed in the representation the labours of the poet and the composer appeared very inferior to the elegant taste of the managers in the decoration  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  DAMAETAS  DAMON  PRIEST  SYLVIA  PHOEBE  DELIA  ARCADIA A DRAMATIC PASTORAL  SCENE I A view of the country  Shepherds and Shepherdesses  CHORUS  SHepherds buxom blith and free  Now's the time for jollity  SYLVIA  AIR  Hither haste and bring along  Merry tale and jocund song  To the pipe and tabor beat  Frolic measures with your feet  Ev'ry gift of time employ  Make the most of proffer'd joy  Pleasure hates the scanty rules  Portion'd out by dreaming fools  CHORUS  Shepherds buxom blith and free  Now's the time for jollity  A dance of Shepherds c  SYLVIA  RECITATIVE  Rejoice ye happy swains rejoice  It is the heart that prompts the voice  Be sorrow banish'd far away  Thyrsis shall make it holyday  Who at his name can joy suppress  Arcadianborn to rule and bless  DAMON  And hark from rock to rock the sound  Of winding horn and deepmouch'd hound  Breaking with rapture on the ear  Proclaims the blithsome Phoebe near  See where she hastes with eager pace  To speak the joys that paint her face  SCENE II Opens to a prospect of rocks  Huntsmen Huntresses c coming down from them  PHOEBE  Hither I speed with honest glee  Such as befits the mind that's free  Your chearful troop blith youth to join  And mix my social joys with thine  Now may each nymph and frolic swain  O'er mountain steep or level plain  Court buxom health while jocund horn  Bids echo wake the sluggard morn  AIR  When the morning peeps forth and the zephyr's cool gale  Carries fragrance and health over mountain and dale  Up ye nymphs and ye swains and together we'll rove  Up hill down the valley by thicket or grove  Then follow with me where the welkin resounds  With the notes of the horns and the cry of the hounds  Let the wretched be slaves to ambition and wealth  All the blessing we ask is the blessing of health  So shall innocence' self give a warrant to joys  No envy disturbs no dependence destroys  Then follow with me where the welkin resounds  With the notes of the horn and the cry of the hounds  O'er hill dale and woodland with rapture we roam  Yet returning still find the dear pleasures at home  Where the chearful good humour gives honesty grace  And the heart speaks content in the smiles of the face  Then follow with me where the welkin resounds  With the notes of the horn and the cry of the hounds  DAMAETAS  RECITATIVE  Small care my friends your youth annoys  Which only looks to present joys  SYLVIA  Though the white locks of silver'd age  And long experience hail thee sage  Ill suits it in this joy to wear  A brow so overhung with care  Better with us thy voice to raise  And join a whole Arcadia's praise  DAMAETAS  With you I joy that Thirsis reigns  The guardian o'er his native plains  But praise is scanty to reveal  The speaking blessings all must feel  DAMON  True all must feelbut thankless too  Nor give to virtue virtue's due  My grateful heart shall ever shew  The debt I need not blush to owe  AIR  That I go where I list that I sing what I please  That my labour's the price of contentment and ease  That no care from abroad my retirement annoys  That at home I can taste the true family joys  That my kids wanton safely o'er meadows and rocks  That my sheep graze secure from the robber or fox  These are blessings I share with the rest of the swains  For it's Thyrsis who gave them and Thyrsis maintains  DAMAETAS  RECITATIVE  Perish my voice if e'er I blame  Thy duty to our guardian's name  His active talents I revere  But eye them with a jealous fear  Intent to form our bliss alone  The generous youth forgets his own  Nor e'er his busy mind employs  To find a partner of his joys  So might his happy offspring own  The virtues which their sire hath shewn  AIR  With joy the parent loves to trace  Resemblance in his children's face  And as he forms their docil youth  To walk the steady paths of truth  Observes them shooting into men  And lives in them life o'er again  While active sons with eager flame  Catch virtue at their father's name  When full of glory full of age  The parent quits this busy stage  What in the sons we most admire  Calls to new life the honour'd fire  SYLVIA  RECITATIVE  O prudent Sage forgive the zeal  Of thoughtless youth With thee I feel  The glories now Arcadia shares  May but embitter future cares  Oh mighty Pan attend Arcadia's voice  Inspire direct and sanctify his choice  AIR  So may all thy sylvan train  Dryad nymph and rustic faun  To the pipe and merry strain  Trip it o'er the russet lawn  May no thorn or bearded grass  Hurt their footsteps as they pass  Whilst in gambols round and round  They sport it o'er the shaven ground  Though thy Syrinx like a dream  Flying at the face of day  Vanish'd in the limpid stream  Bearing all thy hopes away  If again thy heart should burn  In caressing  Blest and blessing  May'st thou find a wish'd return  CHORUS  O mighty Pan attend Arcadia's voice  Inspire direct and sanctify his choice  A dance of huntsmen and huntresses  DAMAETAS  RECITATIVE  Peace shepherds peace with jocund air  Which speaks a heart unknown to care  Young Delia hastes The glad surprize  Of rapture flashing from her eyes  Enter DELIA  DELIA  AIR  Shepherds shepherds come away  Sadness were a sin today  Let the pipe's merry notes aid the skill of the voice  For our wishes are crown'd and our hearts shall rejoice  Rejoice and be glad  For sure he is mad  Who where mirth and good humour and harmony's found  Never catches the smile nor lets pleasure go round  Let the stupid be grave  'Tis the vice of the slave  But can never agree  With a maiden like me  Who is born in a country that's happy and free  DAMAETAS  RECITATIVE  What means this rapture Delia Shew  Th' event our bosoms burn to know  DELIA  Now as I trod yon verdant side  Where Ladon rolls its silver tide  All gayly deck'd in gorgeous state  Sail'd a proud barge of richest freight  Where sat a nymph more fresh and fair  Than blossoms which the morning air  Steals persume from the modest grace  Of maiden blush bespread her face  Hither it made and on this strand  Pour'd its rich freight for shepherds' land  Ladon for this smooth flow thy tide  The precious freight was Thyrsis' bride  DAMAETAS  RECITATIVE  Stop shepherds if aright I hear  The sounds of joy proclaim them near  Lets meet them friends I'll lead the way  Joy makes me young again today  SCENE III A view of the sea with a vessel at a distance  Here follows a PASTORAL PROCESSION to the wedding of THYRSIS  PRIEST  RECITATIVE  Mighty Pan with tender care  View this swain and virgin fair  May they ever thus impart  Just return of heart for heart  May the pledges of their bliss  Climb their knees to share the kiss  May their steady blooming youth  While they tread the paths of truth  Virtues catch from either side  From the bridegroom and the bride  CHORUS  May their steady blooming youth  While they tread the paths of truth  Virtues catch from either side  From the bridegroom and the bride  FINIS
