 OF STAGE TYRANTS  AN EPISTLE TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE  PHILIP  Earl of  Chesterfield  Occasion'd by the  Honest YorkshireMan  being rejected at  DruryLane  PLAYHOUSE and since Acted at other  Theatres  with Universal Applause  By Mr  CAREY    Magnum hoc ego duco  Quod placui  Tibi  qui turpi secernis honestum  Non patre praeclaro sed vita et pectore puro  Hor Serm  LONDON  Printed for  J Shuckburgh  and  L Gilliver  in  FleetStreet J Jackson  in  PallMall  and  J Leake  at  Bath  And sold by  A Dodd  without  TempleBar E Nutt  and  E Cook  at the  RoyalExchange    AN EPISTLE To the Right Honourable  PHILIP  Earl of  Chesterfield  c  _O CHESTERFIELD My Patron and my Pride  In whom does all that's Great and Good reside  Noble by Birth by Liberal Arts refin'd  Delight of Heav'n and Darling of Mankind  The publick Patriot and the private Friend  To hated Indolence no more impute  The Muse's Silence if hereafter mute  She quits her former Toils for future Ease  And checks that Genius which perhaps might please  'Tis Time my fruitless Labours to decline  When all Men's Works can climb the Stage but mine  When in my stead behold a motley Herd  Of upstart Witlings to my self preferr'd  Not so when  Booth Wilks Cibber  rul'd the Stage  Dramatick Ornaments of this our Age  My small Attempts to please were then approv'd  And not for ev'ry trifling  Farce  remov'd  Booth  ever shew'd me  Friendship  and  Respect    And  Wilks  wou'd rather forward than reject  Ev'n  Cibber  Terror to the Scribbling Crew  Would oft Sollicit me for something New  Now Younger Rulers Younger Authors take  These handy Hirelings can in half a Day  Steal a new Ballad FARCE from some old PLAY  To mangled Scraps of many an Ancient Tune  Tagg Feetless Jingle Jarring and Jejune  The jaded Play'rs with equal haste rehearse  'Till Sing Song limps to Horrid Hobbling Verse  Tho' Blunder follows Blunder Line by Line  The 'Squire is taught to think  'tis wond'rous Fine    It suits his Taste he gives his plaudit Voice  And shews his Understanding in his Choice  Framing Conceptions both of Men and Things  Just as Sir  Figg  directs his LeadingStrings  Sir  Figg  grand Master of the double Sneer  Who when He most deceives seems most Sincere  Dissembler Born but much improv'd by Art  A Friendly Aspect an Infernal Heart  The Mischievous the Busy  Go between  Easy 'Squire  Amb'sAce  and sly  Harlequin    Who like two wrangling Counsellors at Bar  But yet in Private like dear Friends caress  And form Designs poor Players to distress  Woe to the Stage if once their Schemes Succeed  Actors will then be Abject Slaves indeed  Poets had better lay their Pens aside  Than tamely truckle to Stage Tyrant's Pride  Who Vain and Partial keep Old Authors down  To force their own Low Trump'ry on the Town  Why to such Wretches should I yeild my Cause  So lately honour'd with so much Applause  My little Ballads still on ev'ry Tongue  Are in politest Conversation Sung  Nor can severest Censure trace one Line  That tends to Vice in any Verse of mine  To please and yet instruct is all my Aim  Let Venal Poetasters boast the same  Whose utmost Views are to corrupt the Taste  To sooth the Vicious and to shock the Chaste  And quite estrang'd to any Sense of Shame  Make Women speak what Rakes wou'd blush to name  Then in Excuse plead Nothing else goes down  A wretched Compliment upon the Town  Wretched as falseThe Town's not so deprav'd  Were Authors and were Actors less enslav'd  Could one good Piece be suffer'd to appear  The Town wou'd gladly lend a candid Ear  Prefer pure Nature and the simple SCENE  To all the  Monkey Tricks  of  Harlequin  The  Man of Taste  proves this Assertion true  We want what's rational as well as New  But this Declension of the  British  Stage  BOOTH  Britain's Roscius  justly did presage  That Rules Dramatic Humour Taste and Wit  Must to that Monster  Pantomime  submit  Yet  Pantomime  in all its Grandeur drest  Is but a pompous  PuppetShew  at best  Then farewell Stage be Bus'ness now my Boast  With what was Irksome once Delighted most  Pleas'd and contented with my little Store  I scorn to prostitute my Muse for more  Alas What Fame what Gain can I propose  When others Father fast as I compose  To such a pitch is pert Presumption grown  'Tis well if this Poor Piece be thought my own  So when long since in simple Sonnet Lays  I made the 'Prentice Sing his  Sally  's Praise  Tho' rude the Numbers yet the Subject mov'd  Immortal ADDISON the Song approv'd  Then Prejudice with Envy did combine  Because 'twas Good 'twas thought too Good for mine  So common Fame did various Authors chuse  To  Namby Pamby  Offspring of my Muse  Till POPE who ever prov'd to Truth a Friend  With Gen'rous Ardour did my Cause defend  Trac'd me obscure and in Detraction's Spite  Display'd me in a more conspicuous Light  To mention more wou'd prove a needless Task  Why shou'd they not be mine That's all I ask  Because I'm Chearful Unreserv'd and Free  Can nothing Good or New proceed from me  What have I done injurious to Mankind  My Works must be to other Men assign'd  Well let 'em go I all my Right resign  Entirely Easy had they ne'er been mine  Yet this Reflection consolates my Fate  I see my Error e'er it proves too late  No more half Maz'd I hurry thro' the Town  With Magazines of Projects in my Crown  While Pyrate Printers rob me of my Gain  And reap the labour'd Harvest of my Brain  Like other Men I walk a common Pace  Nor run through  London  one continued Race  But know When Where and What I am to do  You'll think tis strange  My Lord  but yet 'tis true  Thrice welcome Sweet Tranquillity of Mind  I now a Treasure in Contentment find  Can labour or relax when e'er I please  And boast I've once enjoy'd a moment's Ease  Of all a Moderate Man can wish possest  But most in such a Godlike  Patron  blest  Beneath the Sacred Sanction of whose Name  I build my present Peace my future Fame  FINIS
