 THE LETTERS  THE Occasional Miscellany IN PROSE and VERSE  CONSISTING OF A VARIETY of LETTERS Written originally to a YOUNG GENTLEMAN Who DESIGN'D to go into  HOLY ORDERS  With a SPECIMEN of SACRED POETRY and SERMONS  Omne tulit Punctum qui miscuit utile dulci  HOR  VOL I  By  JOHN WALLIS  A M  late of  Queen  's  College Oxford  NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE Printed by JOHN GOODING on the  Si      TO  Her Grace the Dutchess  OF RICHMOND and LENOX  Madam  TO fly to the BEAU∣TIFUL the GOOD and the GREAT as to GUARDIANANGELS for Protection has been the Practice of  humble  Adven∣turers for Fame in all Ages  but which of  these  Virtues out shines the other in your GRACE requires a nicer Judgment than mine to de∣termine I can only di∣stinguish that they give a kind of Glory and Lustre to each other I can only say they are so eminently conspicuous together as to make your GRACE'S Person  seem  to the wondering Eye like a Paradise and your Soul a Cherubim within to guard it I can only  discover to the World a Part of your GRACE'S Ex∣cellencies and that too ac∣cording to the Measure of my own Weakness Like those who have survey'd some Celestial Luminary or Constellation I can on∣ly tell of a new and shining World above me but not all the Riches and Glories of the Place  THERE are some of your GRACE'S Virtues of  a publick Nature such as Candour Benevolence and Generosity which display themselves in such an ami∣able Variety of Lights that not to perceive them or to deny them to be YOUR'S would be as ungrateful as not to perceive or to deny the SUN'S Existence at the same Time that we feel its beneficial and extensive In∣fluence The noble Man∣ner in which your GRACE seems to enjoy Riches  would almost tempt one to think that FORTUNE if I may so speak had con∣sulted REASON when she bestow'd them on YOU since the World has more Cause to wish you the Ad∣dition than envy you the Abundance  For Merit hence is heard  Amidst its Blushes dawning Arts arise  The gloomy Clouds which Ignorance or Fear  Spread o'er the Paths of Virtue are dispell'd  Servility retires and ev'ry Heart  With  publick  Cares is warm'd  YOUR GRACE'S Encou∣ragement of Learning is the more extraordinary at a Time when many think they but too well recom∣pence an Author if they honour him with a barren PraiseI have the publick Voice to attest what I have now advanced concerning your GRACE and there∣fore I hope I shall not be suspected of uttering those  obliging Falshoods which many of our Moderns can do without blushing  AND here MADAM I am proud that I cannot flatter if I say YOUR pri∣vate Virtues have deserv'd to be set as an Example to a lessdegenerate lesstaint∣ed Age They approach so near to Singularity in ours that I can hardly make a Panegyrick to your GRACE without a Satyr  on many others And therefore this is a Theme that I must cast in Shades and leave your GRACE to the Testimony and Satis∣faction of your own Mind which tho' a silent Enco∣mium is still the best This epistolary Address keeps its Distance and goes no farther than my Heart There it is I feel all the Transport and Joy imaginable when I see Virtue encourag'd and  Learning patronis'd and re∣warded by your GRACE'S noble Family That it may long enjoy the full Vintage of its flowing Ho∣nours is the sincere and earnest Wish of  Madam  Your  Grace  's Most obedient Most humble and Most devoted Servant  JOHN WALLIS  THE PREFACE  Written by a  FRIEND  THE Author of these Vo∣lumes is too well convinc'd of his own Weakness to be pleas'd with any thing he has writ∣ten and he has so little of the SelfOpinion of a Writer in him that he has impos'd the Task upon another to say something concern∣ing  his Work After a Review of so considerable a Body of Men as the Clergy he has modestly at∣tempted to shew why the Number of good Orators among them is so inconsiderable why so few so very few of those who are bred to the Church become Masters of the Force and Charms of Eloquence  THO' he may not have pointed out all the several Reasons that might be assign'd for it yet in Obe∣dience to a young Gentleman's Com∣mands who design'd to go into HOLY ORDERS he has very freely let him into his Sentiments about every Particular relating to  this Subject And he enter'd the more boldly upon the Enquiry from this Consideration that no Embellishment of Stile could be expected from him in a Letter Epistolary Writing must resemble a natural Conversation tho' it may be a little better than what the Generality of People are suppos'd to speak Extempore as a PICTURE may be like tho' handsomer than the Original  IN a Disquisition of so much Im∣portance he thought it no ill Me∣thod to exhibit the most material Accomplishments requir'd in a DI∣VINE and the Blemishes he ought  carefully to beware of and to set in the most conspicuous Point of View obvious Examples for Illustration∣sake He has endeavour'd to pro∣duce such Instances of Offenders both in Eloquence and Morals as may convince any impartial Person that by proper Means Coxcomb after Coxcomb may be gently led off the sacred Stage and persuaded to part with every glaring Particu∣larity which drew them into the Ministry or the Pulpit to be laugh'd at Some Men have a strange In∣clination to branch out into Ex∣tremes and will be dilating them∣selves into the Ridiculous unless some benevolent Hand takes the  Trouble to prune their Luxurian∣ces to pare away the Redundancies of Fancy till they are left in the becoming Simplicity of Action and Delivery  HAD some of our modern Preach∣ers but the least Spark of Emula∣tion in them they would blush to find the little Progress they have made in the Study of Eloquence at an Age in which many others have succeeded so well as to be able to give Sweetness to the Eye Charm to the Tongue and Grace to Mo∣tion and to point their Arguments with all the Life and Spirit with all the Edge and Flame that Wit  or Judgment or Example could give them  'TIS strange indeed to see how differently the VANITY of Preach∣ers runs 'Tis the Boast of many a one of but a raw Fancy and un∣taught unpractis'd Ear which has not had an Opportunity to form itself and become truly musical that by his Genius alone and a na∣tural Rapidity of Stile and Thought and an elaborate Freedom and Faci∣lity of Action he is able to carry all the Affections of his Hearers be∣fore him Others again with a wonderous affected Air lisp in the Pulpit as in their Cradles and their  pretty stammering Tongues which nothing besides their Ignorance can excuse speak continually in wretch∣ed Pun and Quibble And even a later Race scarce free of this In∣firmity and aiming at a false Su∣blime with crowded Simile and mix'd Metaphor become rather ri∣diculous in endeavouring to disco∣ver the Pains they have taken to be oratorical  THE Way of Form and Method in many of the Sermons we hear preach'd has so little Force towards the winning our Attention that 'tis apter to tire us than the Metre of the old Ballad of  The Children in  the Wood  We no sooner hear the Text given out the Subject divided and subdivided with  first  of the  first  and so forth as Order requires than instantly we begin a Strife with Nature which otherwise might surprize us in the soft Fetters of Sleep to the great Disgrace of the Preacher and Scandal of the Au∣dience  THE Manner of dividing a Dis∣course into plain FIRSTS and SE∣CONDS only is of late grown so much out of Fashion I think that 'tis the unpolish'd CountryOrator alone almost who presents his Au∣dience with a DIVISIBLE DIS∣COURSE  The wellbred CourtDivine exhorts in POLITE ESSAY and is asham'd to bring his simple TWOS and THREES concerning HELLTORMENTS before a fa∣shionable Assembly  THE Truth of all this may easily be apprehended by those who know any thing of the present State of PulpitEloquence or are in the least fitted to judge of the Manner of the common Preachers of the Times  WHOEVER has been an Obser∣ver of Action and Grace in Preach∣ing must of Necessity have disco∣ver'd  the great Difference in this Respect between such Persons as have had the Assistance of Nature and a simple rude Education only and such as have had the Advantage of forming themselves under the best Masters at OXFORD or CAM∣BRIDGE There are some Men indeed so happily form'd by Na∣ture herself that with the greatest Simplicity or Rudeness of Educa∣tion they have still something of a natural Grace and Comeliness in their Action and Delivery And there are others of a better Educa∣tion who by a wrong Aim and in∣judicious Affectation of Grace are of all People the farthest remov'd  from it 'Tis undeniable however that the Perfection of Grace in Preaching can be found only among the People of a liberal Education And even among the graceful of this kind those still are found the gracefullest who early in their Youth have learn'd their Exercises under the best and ablest Masters such as a  An eminent Tutor at QUEEN's College OXON  FOTHERGILL or a  A Tutor at St JOHN's College CAMBRIDGE  RUTHERFORTH  'TIS remark'd that by the Help of Imitation and the Force of Example merely such a Comeli∣ness  of Language and Delivery is acquir'd with such apt Motions and Freedom of Action as on all ordinary Occasions may enable a Man to de∣mean himself prettily enough in the Pulpit But when upon farther Occasion Trial is made in an extra∣ordinary Way when Sermons of the genteeler kind are to be preach∣ed 'twill easily appear who of the Preachers have been form'd by the most excellent Rudiments and Ma∣sters and who on the other Side have wanted the Opportunity and Means of forming themselves after the better Models Methinks I can distinguish the Man of liberal Education and pregnant Genius  by the fine Drapery and beautiful Colouring of his Stile which al∣ways has a certain Fullness without Grossness is gentle yet lively and strong and such that its Excellency lies in its equally partaking a mo∣derate Share of both kinds I ob∣serve 'tis attended with a Colouring which appears handsome not from the Daubing of Paint but the Flush of Health  I AM sensible that other Topicks than what my Friend's Letters are upon would have been more to the Liking of some People For Hu∣man Nature is so form'd that he  who flatters Men for his own In∣terest pleases more than he who has no View but Publick Benefit And some Men there are of so con∣fus'd a Thought and so irregularly form'd within themselves that 'tis no more than natural for them to be displeas'd and to find Fault with the bestnatur'd and most benevo∣lent Performances but about such our Author need not be under the least Concern as to what their Sen∣timents of him may be so long as he has the Countenance and En∣couragement of the most worthy of his ProfessionA Man that should pursue Learning even with the dis∣interested  Spirit of a  AMID the Van of PERSIA was a Youth  Nam'd TERIBAZUS not for golden Stores  Not for wide Pastures travers'd o'er with Herds  With bleating Thousands or with bounding Steeds  Nor yet for Pow'r nor splendid Honour fam'd  Rich was his Mind in ev'ry Art divine  And through the Paths of Science had he walk'd  The Votary of Wisdom In the Years  When tender Down invests the ruddy Cheek  He with the MAGI turn'd the hallow'd Page  Of ZOROASTRES then his tow'ring Soul  High on the Plumes of Contemplation soar'd  And from the lofty BABYLONIAN Fane  With learn'd CHALDEANS trac'd the mystick Sphere  There number'd o'er the vivid Fires that gleam  Upon the dusky Bosom of the Night  Nor on the Sands of GANGES were unheard  The INDIAN Sages from sequester'd Bow'rs  While as Attention wonder'd they disclos'd  The Pow'rs of Nature whether in the Woods  The fruitful Glebe or Flow'r or healing Plant  The limpid Waters or the ambient Air  Or in the purer Element of Fire  The fertile Plains where great SESOSTRIS reign'd  Mysterious EGYPT next the Youth survey'd  From ELEPHANTIS where impetuous NILE  Precipitates his Waters to the Sea  Which far below receives the sev'nfold Stream  Thence o'er th' IONICK Coast he stray'd nor pass'd  MILETUS by which once enraptur'd heard  The Tongue of THALES nor PRIENE's Walls  Where Wisdom dwelt with BIAS nor the Seat  Of PITTACUS along the LESBIAN Shore  Here two melodious Numbers charm'd his Ear  Which flow'd from ORPHEUS and MUSAEUS old  And thee O Father of immortal Verse  MAEONIDES whose Strains through ev'ry Age  Time with his own eternal Lip shall sing  Back to his native SUSA then he turn'd  His wand'ring Steps"  Vide Mr  GLOVER'  's  LEONIDAS  L    TERIBAZUS would need more than all the Abi∣lities  of that noble PERSIAN to con∣vince the worthless Part of the  World of his Discretion unless he had made some Improvement in the Pleasures of the Palate in Wealth and Luxury  IT will evidently appear that from the Beginning of this episto∣latory Work he has vary'd his Stile according to the Nature of the Sub∣ject  he is upon and has taken the Liberty now and then to depart a little from the Course of it that he might introduce a greater Variety of Sentiments indulge his Corre∣spondent with agreeable Digressions to entertain and relieve his Juvenile Mind whose Improvement Plea∣sure and Instruction he had solely in View  WHATEVER some Men may think the Letters are real and not precise and formal Treatises de∣sign'd for the Press tho' 'tis be∣come indeed so common a Prac∣tice among Authors to feign a Cor∣respondency and give the Title of  Private Letters to Pieces address'd to the Publick that I should not at all wonder if some People look'd upon these Epistles merely as fictitious like those of SENECA to his Friend LUCILIUS or those of ancient Sophists Grammarians or Rhetoricians  IT will be expected perhaps that I should say something with re∣gard to the POEM of THE ROYAL PENITENT and THE EXHORTA∣TION The Design of these is to shew the Advantage that SACRED has over PROPHANE POETRY The Treasures of it are almost in∣finite and it fares with those that  study it as with a Traveller when he ascends a rising Ground every new Step enlarges his Horizon and presents new Countries new Plea∣sures to his Eye Our Northern Island will in Time I hope burn with as many Altars to the SACRED MUSE as did formerly in CYPRUS DELPHOS or any of those warmer GRECIAN Climates to VENUS and APOLLO  THE SUBSCRIBERS NAMES  A  MArk Anesley

DEAR SIR  I  AM glad to hear of your Resolu∣tion to enter into the Service of GOD you could not possibly chuse a better Master provided you are but sufficiently qualified to serve such a Master well and to acquit yourself with Honour in the Exercise of the ministerial Office All the Duties and Qualifications which are requisite to the Pastoral Charge seem to me to be summon'd up in these few Words of the Apostle St PAUL to  TIMOTHY  Tim ii  Study to shew thyself ap∣prov'd unto GOD a WORKMAN that needeth not be ashamed rightly dividing the WORD of TRUTH  For by being approved unto GOD does not probably signify more than the  pleasing  him  fearing loving  and  honouring  him does that is by leading a religious and virtuous Life according to the Rules of the Gospel thus  Rom xvi  APELLES is said to be  approv'd in  CHRIST and he is said to be the  the good the upright or approv'd Man not he who commendeth himself but whom the LORD  Cor x  commendeth By being  a Workman that needeth not be ashamed  I take to be meant such an one who is skilful in his Profession one that is qualify'd with compe∣tent Learning and Skill for the Discharge of the Pastoral Office for a Minister that wants these Qualifications  had need to be ashamed  because 'tis a very great Shame for any Workman whatsoever to work or practise in that Profession or Calling which he does not understand for a Man cannot  have the Face so much as to excuse his Ignorance in that Matter which he professes to know By  rightly dividing the Word of Truth  I understand the teaching sound and orthodox Doctrine the interpreting the Scripture truly and genuinely without heretical false erroneous or whimsical Glosses which St PAUL does so often caution against in many Places of his EPISTLES For  dividing  the WORD signifies teaching or inter∣preting it being a Metaphor probably taken from the JEWISH Sections or Divisions of the LAW one Division of which was read and commented upon every SabbathDay so that to  divide  the WORD came to signify the interpreting commenting or preaching upon such a Division of it  A GOOD Life then according to the APOSTLE is a Duty which is particularly incumbent upon us of the Clergywe must study to approve our∣selves unto GOD Colours artfully spread upon Canvas may entertain the Eye but never affect the Heart and he who takes no Care to add to the natural Graces of his Eloquence any excellent  Qualities may be allow'd still to amuse as a PICTURE but not to triumph over the Affec∣tions of his Auditors The Eloquence of a bad Man is so involv'd in Smoke that it does not ap∣pear in half its Beauty but that of a good Man shews itself in such a Variety of corresponding a∣greeable Lights that it shines as it were in an universal Blaze his Sermons receive a Lustre from his Life and his Delivery tho' not so graceful as that of a TILLOTSON has however the Power of charming Without this irradiating Power the proudest Divine ought to know whatever he may think to the contrary that his finest Sentiments both in his PulpitHarangues and in common Conversation are uninform'd and dead 'Tis the good the upright the approved Man only can deliver his Discourse or his Opinion with Dignity can rouse a desponding or check an outrageous Sinner can chastise the Enormities of the Age or applaud Virtue Innocence and Integrity For how can the vicious Preacher be warm in exhort∣ing to Devotion How can he be vehement in re∣claiming the Reprobate How can be gracefully  recommend Piety and Virtue How can he be successful in soothing the afflicted or desponding Christian 'Tis impossible that a Hearer should ever be impress'd with Sorrow with Hatred with Detestation of Sin with Dread of Punishment 'tis impossible to move him to Penitence to Tears and Contrition unless the Preacher shall appear possess'd of all these good Dispositions which he aims to awaken in others A wicked Clergyman is a ridiculous Character there is never a SUNDAY he goes to Church but his Congregation are Wit∣nesses of his Folly and Impudence he never ascends the ROSTRUM but he undergoes a severe Trial and every Time he reads PRAYERS 'tis renew'd For there is scarcely any one who hears him that has not a quicker a more piercing Eye to the Defects of his Life than the Beauties of his Delivery so that of whatsoever Complection his Immoralities may be they cast a Cloud over all his Excellencies I must own indeed he that hath made but one false Step or committed one single Error in Life is not immediately pronounc'd a Stranger to Virtue and Goodness the goodnatured  World always throws the Mantle of Cha∣rity over it because 'tis impossible for frail Man to be free from all Fault I have known it an Advantage to many that they have committed Mistakes in their first setting out in the World because they have thus improv'd their Caution and Prudence and the Remembrance of former Mis∣carriages has put them upon repairing little Slips with extraordinary Success To desire indeed to be free from all Fault whilst we are frail Men is an extravagant Pitch of Arrogance and as often to stumble against the same Stone and not to learn Caution even when the Event chastises our Rashness is even far beneath the Character of a Man  As there is nothing so distasteful to an Au∣dience as a bad Clergyman so there is nothing they so much adore as a good one They are struck with the Beauty of INWARD CHARACTER the Harmony and Numbers of the HEART the just Regulation of the AFFECTIONS which form the Manners of an ORATOR  I SHALL therefore enter into a more particular Discussion of those Virtues or moral Qualifications which the ROMAN Orator stiles the HAND∣MAIDS of ELOQUENCE and which we of this Profession are under an indispensible Obligation to practise if we would approve ourselves unto GOD or our Hearers as eloquent DIVINES  THE first Virtue I shall mention as more par∣ticularly necessary for us to practise is HUMI∣LITY There is not indeed any Degree of Meanness in the Pastoral Office which should en∣gage Clergymen to be more condescensive than others for they have rather Reason to value them∣selves upon the Dignity of it But such is the Na∣ture of their Employ that it being their Business to assist and instruct Persons of all Ranks and Qua∣lities as well the POOR as the RICH 'tis im∣possible without a considerable Degree of Humi∣lity and Condescension that they should in any tolerable Measure perform their Duty We must with as much Sincerity and Application instruct the poorest Child in our Parish in the Principles of  Religion as if we had in Charge the Son of CAESAR We must with as great Readiness visit in their Sickness the poor Almsman and Beggar in their squalid Cotrage as we do those great Per∣sons that lie expiring in Pomp and Splendor 'Tis an intolerable Arrogance for us upon a great Preferment to put on a Mein of Grandeur and a supercilious Carriage and to despise those poorer Labourers in the Gospel who have met with a less bountiful Reward If any Clergyman were to set a Value upon himself it should be upon the conscientious Discharge of his Office for the ELDER only  that ruleth well is worthy of  DOUBLE HONOUR for the Church must never value herself upon her Patrimony because her best and purest Ages were when she inherited nothing but Persecution and we find in Scripture an Abun∣dance of Commendations and Blessings upon good and faithful Pastors but it is for  feeding  the SHEEP and not for the WEIGHT of their FLEECE And it is as great a Fault in a Clergy∣man to be proud of great Parts and Learning not only because these are the Gists of GOD as well  as other Things but because these Qualifications when accompanied with Pride do very little good nay commonly a great deal of Mischief in GOD's Church for the learnedest Men tho' good are not always the most successful Pastors tho' PAUL plants and APOLLOS waters yet it is GOD that gives the Increase a painful and industrious tho' less learned Minister may gain more Souls to CHRIST than the most learned GAMALIELS for oftentimes poor ignorant Wretches which stand unaffected by all the rational Strength of some great Doctors of the Law are rous'd up to Repentance and a Sense of Religion by the weak Performances of some of the meanest of the Sons of the Prophets  THERE is a pretty remarkable Story of a COUNTRY CLERGYMAN which as perhaps you have not heard I shall here insert and for a Matter of Fact This Gentleman had a Son who being deficient in point of Learning was refused DEACON'S ORDERS by a certain worthy PRE∣LATE a few Years ago it was such a Grief to  him that he went personally to his Lordship and begg'd hard that his Son might not return with such a Slur to the University and be discouraged from making better Use of his Time  MY LORD said the Clergyman be pleas'd but to admit my Son to DEACON'S ORDERS and I will engage that he shall appear before your Lordship the next Time with a better Stock of Learning and approve himself not unworthy of your future Favour When I was about his Age I got into ORDERS tho' but indifferently furnish'd with Learning for I had been very remiss in my Studies A few Years after be∣ing promoted to a Living I found my Pa∣rishioners mostly DISSENTERS which for a while made me a little dissatisfy'd Now your Lordship may perhaps wonder how I did to manage them being not overburthen'd at my first setting out with Divinity Why my LORD I took this Method which effectually answer'd my Desire Whenever I had any Oc∣casion of speaking with them either at my own House or any other Place my Carriage  towards them was never divested of good Man∣ners and I never made my Company distasteful to them on the Score of Opinion I frequent∣ly had them to spend an Evening with me and our Discourse was chiefly confin'd to such Things as fall in Countrymens' Way By these Means and doing them all the good Turns in my Power I had much of their Company and can now with Comfort say that of all the DISSENTERS in my Parish that went to the MEETING I have not one now that goes to it they all come as duly to Church as the rest of my PeopleThis my LORD was my Case and I leave it to your Lordship's Candour and Consideration  The good Bishop I have been told was so pleased with this Country Clergyman's honest Simplicity and plain Dealing that he obliged him and ordain'd his Son  THIS STORY if duly consider'd is enough to quell the Pride of those Clergymen who un∣measurably value themselves upon their Learning and great Preferment and look upon others only  as the Caterpillars in the Vineyard Such Endow∣ments single of themselves are no Qualifications for a Christian Ministry and they may as well be possess'd by the proud Priests of BAAL or BAC∣CHUS by Pagan FLAMENS or Mahometan MUFTIES  So true is it that Men who excel in other Re∣spects nay shine in other Lights of Life are fre∣quently more deficient in that Address that mild Humanity which wins the Affections of Mankind than in Talents to raise themselves to honourable Stations The  haughty  and  dogmatical  are often substituted in the Room of the  friendly benevolent  and  obliging  As to the Objection that we might perhaps be overbold with GREATNESS and make Acquaintance with it in too familiar a Man∣ner if it was  humble  and  condescensive  I answer it may be just with respect to those Gentlemen whose only Qualifications lie in Form and Distance but not to those of real Merit A becoming Freedom Simplicity and Openness of Behaviour methinks when extended to Men of Sense and Prudence will  never lessen Greatness at all but rather like the regular APERTURES of a BUILDING add Beauty to the WHOLE without diminishing the Strength of any PART of it  THE superior Clergy should be the Support and Ornament of the Priesthood they are placed in higher Orbs not that like METEORS their ominous Blaze should be the Gaze and Terror of their less happy Brethren but that like STARS they may illuminate and beautify animate and impregnate the inferior World For they like THEM should have an enlarg'd Prospect a swift and constant Motion a bountiful and benign In∣fluence    BUT  Man proud Man  Drest in a little brief Authority  Most ignorant of what he's most assur'd  His glassy Essence like an angry Ape  Plays such fantastick Tricks before high Heav'n  As makes the Angels weep  SHAKESPEARE  A LARGE Share of this INDECORUM of Behaviour belongs to those I believe who have contracted the Reverse of Affability and civil Manners in their INFANCY For PRIDE is a Passion which instead of being restrain'd is usually indulged in Children So that 'tis indeed no Wonder if the Effects of it are very unfortu∣nately felt in SOCIETY For it will be hard perhaps for one to give a Reason why that Tem∣per which was used to delight in Insult over Ser∣vants or Inferiors in a Kitchen or a Nursery should not afterwards be the Occasion of equal Mischief in the Publick itself  IT has been known likewise to be perfectly reigning in those who have long indulg'd them∣selves in an habitual Moroseness in a COLLEGE∣LIFE There are certain Negligences or PEC∣CADILLOS in Behaviour towards Inferiors con∣tracted  there  which sometimes reduce Gentlemen into a perfect Apathy towards others that are not their Equals in Birth or Fortune or Learning or Preferments ever afterwards When we go to an  University we find that as FORTUNE holds the GLASS Things have quite different Faces in the Imaginations of many of the graver sort of Academicks We find that there is scarce one in five of the FELLOWS of a COLLEGE can be tolerably civil to any Gentleman of less Rank than a NOBLEMAN a GENTLEMANCOMMONER or a GRADUATE Hence 'tis that others catch the Infection Noblemen or GentlemenCom∣moners will only keep Company with the FEL∣LOWS or with one another a Graduate with a Graduate or Men of the same standing So that by these foolish Distinctions the poor SCHOLAR or SERVITOR in a tatter'd Gown tho' of ever so much Merit has rarely but very rarely the Benefit of keeping Company with his Superiors which I must own I mention with Concern as 'tis a great Disadvantage to Youth when they first go to an University and would gladly learn MANNERS as well as SCIENCES If a poor Scholar should happen to neglect or forget the Ceremony of putting off his CAP in passing one of the FELLOWS in the COLLEGEQUADRANGLE  'tis a thousand to one but he is made to fast that Day by being put out of COMMONS or else he perceives his Mistake not only  in  his Dinner but  at  it likewise For if the proud Gentleman that thinks himself slighted should happen to sit PROVOSTPLACE as they call it he sits at the Head of his Table in all the Agonies of conceal'd Illnature and his Discourse is made up of half Sentences and dark Allusions both disagreeable and unintelligible to all present so that the Scholars that wait at Table can only stare each other wildly in the Face and stand with a mali∣cious Sneer wishing the Dinner was over and in∣wardly commiserating the Condition of one ano∣ther When Gentlemen of such a saturnine Com∣plection retire from the Exercise of magisterial Authority over a few poor Scholars and enter in∣to Life their Behaviour is commonly attended with a great many disagreeable Sullennesses towards their Inferiors or Dependants upon the slightest Displeasure nay whether in or out of Humour they have contracted such an Aversion to tatter'd Robes that for the most part they fly the Society  of the POOR Such Men forget that they give the World the same Advantage over their RE∣PUTATION which a more criminal Conduct would do  Hae Nugoe seria ducunt in Mala  THE young Gentleman therefore that goes to an University has great Need of Counsel and Di∣rection I would have him consult GOD in the first Place and next the most humble the most devout and experienc'd Tutor and Companions he can find out For he stands in a Place where many Ways meet and if he takes the Wrong he will certainly wander far and it may be never re∣cover the right He may float a long long while upon the BILLOWS of PRIDE and FOLLY before he recovers the Haven of WISDOM and HUMILITY  How considerable a Part of Happiness is lost by those who seem by the Eminence of their Condition to be above  ordinary  human Commerce  and who affect a sort of distant Strangeness towards their Inferiors will be easily apprehended by one who is not exceedingly illnatur'd Such a re∣ferv'd uncommunicative unfriendly Greatness must of all others be the most distasteful and gloomy State Nor can it possibly be esteem'd other than sound and thorough Wretchedness a grating and disgustful Feeling without the least Mixture of any thing soft gentle or agreeable How great must be the Shocks of Disappointment the Stings of Affront and the Agonies of a work∣ing Antipathy against the multiply'd Objects of Offence to the haughty proud Man who with a severe Aspect and a pompous lofty Tone of Au∣thority guards his Greatness as a gruff Bully does a Mistress Wherever such a Creature turns him∣self which ever Way he casts his Eye every thing around him must appear ghastly and horrid every thing hostile and as it were  bent  against a private and single Being who is thus divided by PRIDE from every thing  beneath  him and has nothing soft or pleasing from the Side of FRIEND∣SHIP in the INFERIOR WORLD How little  does such a Mortal know the Extent and Power and Pleasure of HUMILITY and to what an heroick Pitch a Soul may rise which feels the thorough Force of it Never was Humility prac∣tised but with increasing Joy which makes the Practiser still more in Love with the fair Act It leaves behind it the Perception of a delicious Ease and an Overflowing of soft and pleasing Sensation I would to GOD that enormous Pride and Distance did never appear among us that Humi∣lity and a just Reverence for Mankind and Civi∣lity and affable Manners did alway take place We should then feel nothing but the enlivening Influence of the benevolent and obliging the cour∣teous and unreserv'd Temper which is a perfect Stranger to the untoward Delights of a dissocial Community  I SHALL conclude this Epistle lest I should fall under the Imputation of being prolix with ar∣dently wishing that all of US may be able to say with DAVID  Psal cxxxi  LORD I am not highmind∣ed  I have no proud Looks I do not exercise myself in great Matters which are too high for me But I refrain my SOUL and keep it low as a CHILD that is weaned from his MOTHER yea my SOUL is even as a weaned Child  Our SAVIOUR has so often pronounc'd the  hum∣blest  Man the  greatest  in the Kingdom of Heaven he has so often promis'd the  first  Place and the  greatest  Exaltation to the  lowest  Condescensions he was himself so illustrious an Example of Lowliness of Mind of Poverty of Spirit and the APOSTLE has so expresly asserted his  Phil ii  JOY and CROWN to be the Reward of his HUMILITY that I can never think DEAR SIR that we can ever rise to a more eminent Height than that to which the Imitation of this Virtue of our LORD and MASTER will advance US  I am  c  LETTER II  DEAR SIR  ANOTHER Virtue we are particularly to practise is PATIENCE for I am sure no Order of Men in the World have more Occasion to exercise it If we should give way to Passion and Peevishness our whole Life would be one continual Fret We had need of a great deal of Patience in the Instruction and Admonition of those that are under our Care to see what slow Progress they make in the Know∣ledge of divine Truths how perverse the younger  sort are to learn their Duty and how refractory and stubborn the elder are to retain their vicious Habits with how great a Facility even Chil∣dren can apprehend any thing that is lewd and wicked and how dull and stupid their very Parents are whilst we are preaching to them what is good how that when we speak to them in Demonstra∣tion and Power making out to them as clear as the SUN the Agreeableness the Pleasure and Happiness of a virtuous Course of Life and the inevitable Misery of a bad one and when to this we farther add the Efforts of a pious Zeal and the Charms of a grateful Eloquence and yet not∣withstanding all this to make no more Impression upon their Hearts than the STROKES do upon the harden'd ANVILWe had need be con∣siderable Masters of this Virtue when we find how many Men are become our Enemies because we tell them the Truth that when we preach up Re∣ligion and Virtue we are look'd upon as so many knavish Cheats and Impostors by the Atheistical and Prophane whilst we endeavour to maintain the Unity and Apostolick Government of our  Church whilst we warn Men of the great Danger of an unreasonable Separation we are traduced by the resolv'd Schismatick as the Agents of ROME and the Advocates only of a more covert and dis∣guis'd Popery that when we teach the Quiet and Peaceableness of Primitive Christianity the Guilt and Danger of Faction and Rebellion to think we should be censur'd for the Miscarriages of some this Way as the Mercenaries of Government and the Promoters of a despotick Power To think farther yet how the INFERIOR CLERGY should be set up as the Mark of Ridicule and Contempt that they should have Reason to complain of more Grievances than their Superiors can boast of Im∣munities that no Injustices are so frequently com∣mitted nor so hardly redress'd as what are done to them that they should in many Places be the Sport of the Gentry and be liable to all the un∣mannerly Mirth of the Commonalty that their very Name should pass for a Jest and every thing tho' never so nauseously silly when they are the Subject presently commence Wit and go for a Thing that is well saidNow to be able to con∣flict  with these and many more Grievances and Difficulties in the Exercise of our Office we must be arm'd with a great deal of PATIENCE and wait for a Recompence in another World for our SUFFERINGS here THIS and this only has kept up the Spirits of my Neighbour EULALIUS  EULALIUS may be said now to be one of your very rich Clergymen not worth a Groat who is little known and much esteem'd by his few Friends thankful for what Mercies he receives and humble under Chastisement He is despis'd by the World for his Poverty and pities the World for its Weakness is a Friend to Mankind and an Enemy to nothing but Vice A LADY of his Acquaintance told him one Day she was sorry he had the Misfortune of being so  poorly  provided for in the Church and ask'd him if he had no better  Chance  for Preferment  CHANCE MISFOR∣TUNE and  good  or  bad  Luck MADAM re∣plied he are Words without a Meaning or they signify the Direction of PROVIDENCE If you have no Meaning in these Words you  tell me you are sorry for nothing if you have 'tis impious for 'tis thinking the Source of MERCY cruel But as I think better of you I take them to be Words of Course He who depends on Providence can never want a Support But say we are neglected and all our Endeavours for a decent Support prove fruitless He who considers that Death will soon relieve him will by that Reflection not be dismay'd but find his Constancy supported  WE'RE  all but  ACTORS  on the World's great Stage  Some play without some with an Equipage  Death drops the Curtain and the Farce is o'er  And all Distinctions cease' twixt  Rich  and  Poor  WERE the good and virtuous of Mankind MADAM wholly prosperous in this Life did Goodness never meet with Opposition or Merit lie under a Cloud where would be the Trial Victory or Crown of VIRTUE Where would the Virtues have their Theatre or whence their  Names Where would be TEMPERANCE or SELFDENIAL Where PATIENCE MEEKNESS MAGNANIMITY Whence would these have their Being What Merit ex∣cept from Hardship What VIRTUE without a Conflict  EULALIUS tho' in these low Circumstances is often telling his Friends that he is very  happy    Dulces pendent circum Oscula Nati  Casta Pudicitiam servat Domus  Virg Georg l  and that he looks upon his Condition to be for the  best  which puts me in mind of a Gentleman who coming from IRELAND to ENGLAND and go∣ing into the PacketBoat and the EnteringRope breaking fell into the Pinnace and broke his Leg "Well said he 'tis all for the better" His Friends ask'd him how he could think break∣ing his Leg attended with the Loss of his Voyage  c  could be for the better  PRO∣VIDENCE  VIDENCE replied he knows best I am still of Opinion 'tis for the better  He was car∣ried back the PacketBoat sail'd founder'd in her Passage and but one Man was sav'd  AND here 'tis pleasant to observe that tho' the Pavilion of the ALMIGHTY be thick Clouds and he walks upon the Wings of the Wind tho' his Providence be a great Abyss and the Swiftness and Secrecy of his Actings elude our Search and baffle our Enquiries so that we cannot discern when he acts by PREROGATIVE when by LAW yet as is plain from this Relation he does frequently exert a supernatural Force and Virtue for our Preservation  A LOW Condition in the World seems to all my Friend a terrible Misfortune its Sound is so and that's all Life methinks is various enough and if one Livelihood fails another may succeed If one Rank of Life cannot be supported a Clergyman may flourish very well in another 'Tis but descending a Step lower and the Event  would abundantly atone for the Condescension 'Tis well known the MERCANTILE WORLD is indebted to an ingenious poor Clergyman to his neglected Merit for the curious Invention of the STOCKING FRAME being out of Bread and ignorant of any Means of Subsistence by DI∣VINITY he liv'd for some Time upon what his Wife got by KNITTING and by curiously ob∣serving the playing of the Needles whilst she was at Work he framed in his Mind the famous Mo∣del of the Frame which has since prov'd of such singular Advantage to that Branch of the BRITISH Manufactures that it affords good Bread to Thou∣sands  I REMEMBER a little Story of a Gentleman of GASCOIGNE who inherited two thousand Crowns ayear from his Father commenced MAR∣QUIS at PARIS and being a very volatile Ge∣nius soon got the better of his Fortune and was reduced to the lowest Ebb of Wretchedness Yet in the Midst of it he never lost his Spirit and Courage or impotently repin'd at what was not  to be remedy'd But with the small Pittance he had left purchased a MULE and turn'd WA∣TERCARRIER Some Time after which as he was trafficking his Merchandize up and down the Streets he happened to meet two of his old Companions who would have avoided him for fear of giving him Pain at being caught in such an Equipage But he prevented them sprung forward to salute them with his usual Freedom and when they seem'd to pity his ill Fortune briskly interrupted them by sayingThat he had Forty thousand Crowns Worth of Water in the SEYNE but for want of Servants he was obli∣ged to sell it himself  I AM afraid very few among us in Distress dis∣play such a Fortitude and Greatness of Soul our Pride will not suffer us to do it and we rather chuse to have that very Pride wounded every Day in our Lives by laying ourselves open to the rich Man's Contumely to Insults and new Grievance in intreating Obligations to endure which with PATIENCE should be beneath the Spirit of the  SACRED ORATOR As to all other Sufferings we may rejoice in them with EULALIUS and with our BLESSED LORD endure the CROSS and despise the SHAME  I am  DEAR SIR  Yours  c  LETTER III  DEAR SIR  WE of this Profession are likewise obliged to shew forth a sincere LOVE of GOD and not to take the RICHES or the PLEASURES of the World for our MASTERS For Men that have devoted themselves to this Employ have set themselves one Remove out of the World GOD has received them into his immediate Service and they are cre∣ated as it were the DOMESTICKS of HEAVEN Therefore we must always demonstrate an extraor∣dinary  Love to our peculiar Master we must endeavour to have the greatest and noblest Con∣ceptions of his Power and Goodness and to pro∣pagate the same in others we must be zealous of his Honour to vindicate with Intrepidity and Bold∣ness his holy Name and Word from Blasphemy and those Things which are consecrated to his Ser∣vice from Prophanation we must afford all the Advice and Encouragement we can for Men to ob∣serve his Commands and dissuade them to the ut∣most from the Violation of them We must like∣wise

Quards and without being mov'd at what they did or said arriv'd on the QUIRINAL HILL Having duly perform'd this Sacrifice in that Place and returning with the same steady Countenance and Pace he reenter'd the Capitol in full Con∣fidence that those GODS whose Worship even the Fears of Death could not force him to abandon would be propitious to him The GAULS were either astonished at his surpri∣zing Boldness or mov'd by a Sense of Religion which that People do by no Means neglect  C FABIUS  DORSO in the Time of the Siege of the RO∣MAN Capitol to the great Astonishment of his  Countrymen as well as the Enemy could come down from the Citadel amidst the Darts of the GAULS and perform a Yearly Sacrifice peculiar to the FABIAN Family on the QUIRINAL HILL And shall WE the peculiar Ministers of Heaven be less careful of performing the Sacrifice of Praise and Thanksgiving to our LORD and Master in his Temple than a private ROMAN Nobleman the holy Rites of his Family We must for so honourable a Master's Sake endeavour to do all the Good we can to the Souls he has com∣mitted to our Charge to draw them out of the Snares of the Devil and to lead them into the Way of Salvation to grieve at their Miscarriages and to rejoice at their Amendment to endeavour to our utmost to promote Piety and true Religion to enlarge the Confines of the Gospel and the King∣dom of our BLESSED LORD  AND so likewise as to RICHES which the vain World so courts and admires we must not take them for our MASTERS but with a de∣cent Humility condescend to be easy in the Situa∣tion  we are in and endeavour rather by our De∣serts to invite Preferments to us than make any Tendency to them We must not when we are advanced to the most plentiful Station in the Church only fill our Bosoms with the Fruits and raise Families upon its Revenues nor yet if we meet with Disappointments must we be impatient but study to live decently creditably and con∣tentedly according to our Conditions  I

prodigious great Conquest but a good Conscience and a fair Character continued in his former Poverty and la∣borious Way of Life the same Man being both the Pattern and strict Guardian of publick Moderation When the Senate would have assign'd him a considerable Share of Land he was content with the same Quantity which he had given others which was but four Acres often using this Expression  That he was a bad Citizen who could not be contented with what satisfied others  Here he built a CountryHouse which he called after his Name and when the SABINES whom he had conquer'd a little before happen'd to come and finding him roasting TURNIPS in it offer'd him a large Sum of Gold which they had brought him as a Present he said  I had rather eat these Turnips out of Earthen Dishes and rule over those who are possessed of that Gold  After∣wards the elder CATO had some Estates in the Neighbourhood of this House whither he used to come frequently and upon seeing this poor little Cottage and the small Farm which this great Man after three Triumphs had cultivated with his own Hands and at the same Time calling to Mind a Life led in the most abstemious Manner he dispos'd his Mind to the

Comparison with Riches and think that there can be no real Greatness or distinguish'd Merit without a Flow of Wealth and Preferment to attend to the Narration that Historians give us of these eminent Heathens  Respicere Exemplar Vitae Morumque jubebo  Doctum Imitatorem et  VERAS  hinc ducere Voces  Hor de Arte Poet  THE private Conversation which pass'd be∣tween C FABRICIUS and King PYRRHUS who wanted to make a Trial of his Constancy and SelfDenial is so remarkable that I shall here set Part of it down  C FABRICIUS said the KING as I sincerely desire to have all the rest of the ROMANS for my Friends so especially I do you whom I esteem to excell all others for your Conduct both in Civil and Military  Affairs Yet I am sorry to see that you want one thing for your Circumstances are too nar∣row to enable you to keep up the Porte becoming Men of Quality I will not suffer this Frown of FORTUNE to make you uneasy any longer for I will give you such Plenty of Gold and Silver in Money and Plate as will set you above the most opulent ROMAN in point of Riches Because I am persuaded that nothing can be more worthy my princely Station and Fortune than relieving the oppressive Poverty of Men of Merit who have preferred Glory to the heaping up of Riches I look upon this as a most glorious Act as an Act by which a Prince raises the most illustrious Monuments of his Royal Magnificence and offers the most solemn and acceptable Sacrifice to the Gods Therefore if you will allow me to assist you with my Riches I shall esteem it as a Benefit receiv'd rather than bestow'd  To which C FABRICIUS after a short Si∣lence answered  MY POVERTY is so far  from being a Burthen or Inconvenience to me that on the contrary whenever I compare my∣self to the Rich my Condition seems to be in∣finitely happier and I number myself amongst those few whose Lot it is to enjoy all the Fe∣licity possible in this Life and when thus rank'd I feel the greatest inward Delight and am thankful for my Poverty For while I deem it idle and foolish to covet Superfluity and my little Field when well cultivated and laid out affords me all Necessaries I know not for what Purpose I ought to be solicitous about greater Wealth For all Nourishment is most pleasant to me when season'd with Hunger and all Drink grateful when I am adry I procure myself easy and quiet Sleep by Labour If my Cloaths keep out Cold I am satisfied with them In HousholdFurniture I like that best which is most fit and convenient for the Use to which it is applied and at the same Time cheapest Wherefore I should be doubly un∣just if I should accuse FORTUNE for not having afforded me more Riches than my  NATURE requires which neither inspires me with a Desire of Superfluities or Dexterity to procure them  THEREFORE with this Indigence of mine I look upon myself as richer than the most opu∣lent of other Men nay than even you yourself for I have so much that I can desire no more as to you would you have come over to ITALY if you had not thought yourself poor notwith∣standing you possess EPIRUS and other Do∣minions Ay but say you Wealth fairly en∣ables us to do Good to others and my Poverty puts it out of my Power to help any one But truly this gives me no more Trouble than that I am not more than ordinary furnish'd with other Things that GOD hath not granted me un∣common KNOWLEDGE nor the Art of PRO∣PHECY for the Benefit of those who want them nor many other excellent Endowments And if I employ the Talents I possess for the Interest of my native State and Friends if by assisting every Man in every respect that I am  capable I suffer my good Offices to extend to all I think hitherto I am free from Crime on this Score Nor can you in Justice call these Things mean and trifling which you pretend to set so high a Value upon and are so ready to purchase at the Expence of great Treasure  WE are informed that the KING having heard him talk in this Manner desisted from far∣ther Trial of his Virtue at that Time But next Day he ordered FABRICIUS to be called to him and in order to frighten him having placed an ELEPHANT behind a Curtain at their Backs as they were discoursing together the Curtain was drawn up all of a sudden at the Command of the King and the Beast laid his Trunk on FABRICIUS'S Head and set up a terrible Noise and braying But the undaunted HERO turn'd about very calmly and smiling said  Your Gold could not tempt me Yesterday nor hath your Beast frighted me Today  THE same FABRICIUS whose whole SideBoard of Plate consisted only of a Silver Saltseller and a little Dish which stood on a Stool of CornelWood when the SAMNITE Embassadors brought him Money and fine Furniture carried his Hands wide open to his EARS thence to his EYES NOSE MOUTH THROAT and at last down to his BELLY saying  While I can govern THESE I shall want nothing but do ye car∣ry back the MONEY to them who need it  PARE away VANITY and AMBITION dear Sir and there is no solid and natural Contentment but may be had with the smallest Income or Preferment If we have not a stately BRICK HOUSE and the costliest Sort of Furniture we may perhaps have as convenient a little Cottage as C FABRI∣CIUS or M CURIUS had with decent Ne∣cessaries in it and if we have not a Bottle of PORT or FALERNIAN we may have Plenty of Spring Water which is every whit as clear and wholsome as if it darted from the Breasts of a MARBLE NYMPH or the Urn of a RIVER GOD  IF we cannot be moderate in our Desires no Greatness can satisfy or content us still if we could mount up a little higher in the Church if we could get that RECTORY or that DEANERY or that BISHOPRICK we would be happy we would obtain all our Wishes But yet at last when we have got up to the very Top of the PEAK of TENERIFF to the very Summit of Preferment we are in exceeding great Danger of breaking our Necks downwards but in no Possi∣bility of ascending upwards into the Seat of Tran∣quillity above the Moon The first ambitious Men in the World the OLD GIANTS are said to have made an Attempt of scaling HEAVEN in Despight of the GODS and that they cast OSSA upon OLYMPUS and PELION upon OSSA two or three Mountains

I just now mention'd that fight∣ing  for one Territory after another was his con∣stant Amusement to the last Gasp without ever arriving at the MERRY HOUR which he pro∣pos'd as the Issue of all his Victories for he was knock'd in the Head at storming of a City and like a true restless Hero died in his Vocation  Frenshem Suppl Liv Hist  What SIR do you propose in this Expe∣dition against the

restless in their Cures and struggling for Wealth and Grandeur as CHIL∣DREN do for RATTLES are as weak as PYRRHUS and weaker than Children The harmless BABES indeed are innocently amus'd with the tinkling of the BELLS but the Amuse∣ment of the ECCLESIASTICK INFANTS is attended both with the Loss of Time and Reputa∣tion they are in a continual Hunt after Baubles till the End of the Lottery of Life approaches till the last Minute like the last BENEFITTICKET upon the WHEEL puts a Stop to their Career  I OFTEN look upon these aged CHILDREN or GAMBLERS for Preferment in the same merry Light

they may not seem to want Activity or Life and Spirit to be engaged in the busy Scenes of Life like DIOGENES  who upon the Approach of PHILIP of MA∣CEDON with an Army towards CORINTH and the Inhabitants running in great Consterna∣tion with Materials for its Defence took his TUB which was his Dwelling and with great Industry roll'd it up and down the CRANEUM the usual Place of his Residence before the City and being ask'd the Reason of his whimsical Labour an∣swer'd  He did it that he might not be the only idle Person among so many that were in ACTION  BUT to be serious We of the CLERGY ought of all Men to shew a CONTEMPT of worldly Things we must not ambitiously aspire to great Preferment nor indecently progg and solicit for any by a criminal LOWLINESS or sawning Obsequiousness of Behaviour by a servile Submission and falling into the corrupt Taste and Pleasures of great People tho' I know they are reckon'd essential Qualities and Accomplishments for a Man that would nowadays rise in the World But 'tis observable that those that arrive at Pre∣ferment  this Way would gladly forget the Steps of that detestable LADDER by which they ascended into it and eagerly wish that others would forget it too like a STREAM running as soon as it enlarges itself as far it can from its little FOUN∣TAIN and labouring as it were by its Circlings and Wanderings to conceal the MEANNESS of its RISE  'Tis a common Proof  That  LOWLINESS  is young Ambition's Ladder  Whereto the Climber upwards turns his Face  But when he once attains the upmost Round  He then unto the Ladder turns his Back  Looks in the Clouds scorning the base Degrees  By which he did ascend *  I am  c  SHAKESPEARE  LETTER IV  DEAR SIR  AS we of this Profession must not take the RICHES so neither must we take the PLEASURES of the World for our MASTERS We must not prefer them to that intellectual Pleasure and divine Peace which is attainable by Men alone and denied to Beings of a lower Class Any Man may see the great Dispro∣portion there is between the resin'd Pleasures of conscious Innocence and sensual Gratifications unless he has parted with his noblest Prerogative  his REASON and by intemperate and disorder∣ly Living made thinking his Torment The PLEASURE of SENSE that is not resin'd by Virtue is like a LANDFLOOD impetuous muddy and irregular it leaves nothing behind it but a Group of Impurity But the PLEASURE of VIRTUE is like a STREAM which runs in∣deed within its Banks but it runs smooth and clear and is as pure as the limpid FOUNTAIN from whence it flows  PURITY of Heart is of all others the most excellent as well as the most elevated Virtue and therefore a poor GREEK MAIDEN being ask'd what FORTUNE she would bring her Hus∣band answer'd truly and bravely  I will bring him what is more valuable than any Trea∣sure a Heart unspotted and that Portion of Virtue without a Stain which was all that descended to me from my PARENTS  THE wild ACADEMICKS give ample Testi∣mony of the Slavery and Wretchedness of Vice  They may extoll their criminal Delights to the Skies and point their Wit as sharply as they please against a virtuous regular Conduct but when they come afterwards to pay the necessary Tribute to their commanding Pleasures we hear their pathetick Moans and find the inward Dis∣cord and Calamity of their Lives We may of∣ten read in their Looks the dolorous Confession in behalf of Virtue and see in their very Eyes how the Case stands  Nam veroe Voces tum demum Pectore ab imo eliciuntur  WHO can express the Horrors that flow in upon the Men of Pleasure when cool Reflection brings their guilty Scenes to View How sharp are the Upbraidings of an offended Conscience What in∣ward Perturbations and Agonies distract the Mind As that poisonous

Convulsion in the Face whereby a Person seems to die laughing so are the Smiles that sensual Gratifications and LoveIntrigues produce but false and hollow at the best and at last fatal  I HAVE somewhere read of an unlucky Mistake made by one of the FRENCH BISHOPS an intriguing Gentleman among the Ladies who writing to a certain young DUTCHESS at PARIS and at the same Time to the CARDINAL DE  FLEURY directed one Letter for the other That for the DUTCHESS which the CARDINAL receiv'd was as follows  I have just now wrote to his OLD EMI∣NENCE my charming QUEEN to intreat his Leave to return to PARIS I make no Doubt but he will grant it As for the rest the Air is so pure here that I have acquir'd so good a State of Health that I reckon I shall be able to give you most sensible Proofs of it when I come to have the Happiness of seeing you  YOU may guess how the PRELATE was sur∣priz'd when he read the following Answer which the CARDINAL immediately sent him  HIS OLD EMINENCE advises you to ex∣tinguish your Passion His Majesty orders you to continue in your Diocese till further Orders and requires that your Life and Conversation may be as pure as the Air you breathe and that you make no other Use of your good State  of Health but to discharge the Duties of your FUNCTION  WE of this Profession must also be very mode∣rate in the Enjoyment of those other good Things which GOD has allotted us such as our DIET DRESS and CLOATHING When People see a Clergyman labouring and toiling among a Squadron of Dishes grunting under the Load and Repletion of the strongest Meats panting almost in vain for Breath but quite in vain for Thought and reminded only of his Existence by the unsa∣voury Returns of an OLIO what Good can they expect from such inglorious Work  WHAT  Life in all that ample Body say  What heavenly Particle inspires the Clay  DISTEMPERS of all Complections are the just Rewards of such a Sensualist the neverfailing Trophies of such a CULINARY DIVINE who eats according to the Laws of some eminent Epi∣cure at PONTACK'S and has no Relish for plain  Beef and Pudding but must have his fricasseed Frogs and his Ortalans The Calamity would not be so great if the Offspring of such a Compound Piece of Clay were no Sufferers but his Children are commonly a Race of palefaced spindle∣shank'd LILLIPUTIANS to see the most vi∣gorous of whom it would make one's Heart ach A single Regiment would put Fifty Thousand of them to Flight  THERE is also a Decency and Moderation to be observ'd in our Attire Dress and Cloathing A Gentleman in a Gown and Cassock must be a little Soul who converses no higher than a LOOK∣INGGLASS ESSENCES and PERUKES and a fantastick Dress he may help to make up the Shew of the World who flutters about with a frizzled Headpiece is sleek with Perfumes and shines in flowing Robes of Paduasoy but must not be reckon'd among the rational Inhabitants of it  LET the voluptuous the fantastick and the finical be as extravagant as they please they must  at the same Time discover their Inconsistency and live in Contradiction to that Principle on which in the Pulpit they pretend to ground their highest Entertainment when in passionate Strains they preach up the Beauty and Charms of an abstemious Life and Temperance in Attire This I would call the LEPROSY of ELOQUENCE for un∣doubtedly such Leprosies are the worst of any I would advise such leprous ORATORS to ac∣custom themselves a little to the Exercise of SELFDISSECTION and to afford themselves a little Time to think in private for their own particular Benefit and Use  Et verae Numerosque Modosque edicere Vitae  and not be so often retir'd as they are and yet never be  by themselves  IT must be confess'd indeed that few Things make a Man appear more despicable or more

tread in the rugged Tract even when there is little Occasion for it DESIRE must be fre∣quently confin'd within the Circle prescrib'd by CUSTOM only when there would be really no Harm with Decency to indulge it For tho' in the very Road to Virtue there are several PRIM∣ROSEPATHS to use the Expression of LAERTES in SHAKESPEARE which may invite the Step without leading absolutely out of the Road itself  or offering any indecent Prospect to the View yet the World expects a CLERGYMAN should tread the direct Road without going to the Right or Left for fear he should wander too far or trip in the Circumflex  ALTHOUGH a Fondness for the Entertain∣ments of the STAGE is the prevailing Temper of the Age we live in yet it would but ill become us to give any Encouragement to them For the false Notions of Honour there propagated the agreeable Shade which is cast over unlawful Love and the Ridicule and Contempt with which all Se∣riousness and Religion is generally treated makes me think it too dangerous for the young and un∣becoming the old The Gay the Polite and the Witty may perhaps run the Rigg upon us the Toupees may laugh at us and the Ladies frown upon us if we do not make a Party with them to the Playhouse but we must not regard that I am indeed asham'd to tell you that a Man may read the COMEDIES of the ancient HEATHENS with less Offence to his Modesty and Virtue than  those of modern CHRISTIANS A vicious Sen∣timent in a theatrical Performance at ATHENS would have cost the Poet his Liberty or Life When EURIPIDES made one of his Actors say  Riches are the supreme Good and with Reason excite the Admiration of Gods and Men  the whole Theatre rose upon him and he had been banished immediately if he had not desired Patience till the End of the Play where the Speaker of this Sentence perishes miserably Were the Stage under proper Regulations it would be a rational and agreeable Entertainment and I cannot see why a Clergyman as well as ano∣ther Person might not then go to a Play it might then as much help as it now hinders the the Cause of VIRTUE  WE must never frequent GAMINGHOUSES to play at BILLIARDS  c  but fly from the Infection of them with Horror 'tis really my Opinion that this single Depravity puts Thousands of People in the Kingdom to greater Expence  than would maintain the SCIENCES in all their Glory  GAMING was so much disesteem'd among the greatest of Men formerly that the King of PARTHIA is reported to have sent a Bale of golden Dice to DEMETRIUS on Purpose to upbraid his Inconstancy And COBILON the LACEDEMONIAN being sent to CORINTH for obtaining a mutual League and Friendship between those two Cities when he saw the Captains and Senators of CORINTH playing at Dice returned without doing any Thing saying that he would not so much as tarnish the Glory of the SPAR∣TANS as that it should be said they had made a League with GAMESTERS  I AM far from being an Enemy to the Enter∣tainment of a CONCERT I even think Musick a Science peculiarly necessary amongst us to soften our rugged Genius to prepare the Way to Polite∣ness and Goodbreeding In HOMER we read of a HARPER to whom ALCINOES and  ULYSSES willingly lent their Ears In VIR∣GIL JOPAS both sings and plays while DIDO and AENEAS give Attention Such is the Force of Musick that ORPHEUS assuaged the Tem∣pest of the ARGONAUTS with a Song and if there be any Authority in FABLES we find that tho' ARGUS had his Head guarded with a hundred Eyes yet they were all charm'd asleep with the Sound of one single PIPE  Musick has Charms to soothe and tamethe horrid Savage  Rocks and Desarts are respondent to the Voice  CICERO's Orat for ARCHIAS  But even this Taste for musical Diversions a Man may encourage with too great Profusion and he may become a Dupe to Sounds to the Prejudice of his Understanding  THO' I am for taking the highest Care to ex∣hilerate Religion yet I would by no Means en∣courage your going to  dance c  at ASSEM∣BLIES Dancing may be a very necessary Qua∣lification  for Youth as it gives a Person a genteel Carriage and an easy graceful Behaviour but I don't know of any Business a Gentleman in Holy Orders has with it When CYRUS the GREAT demanded the Advice of his Counsellors about the best Method of keeping a Nation which he had conquer'd in Subjection he was advis'd to let SINGERS and DANCERS be introduced a∣mongst them and let their Youth be brought up in learning the LUTE and they would soon languish into Foppery and Effeminacy and lose all Sense of Liberty This will always be the Case whenever like the  FAR unlike in Manners to the

of ST ASAPH  DRUM∣MOND or a  Prebendary of WORCESTER  TOTTIE  CAUTIOUSNESS and Circumspection in our taking a GLASS at a Tavern or at our own Houses is a Duty which is also more particularly incumbent upon us of the CLERGY'Tis true our SAVIOUR exhorts us to CHEARFULNESS and GOOD HUMOUR in the strongest Man∣ner and under the most familiar and pleasant  Images Even the first MIRACLE he ever wrought carries with it a certain agreeable Fe∣stivity and Alacrity And old NESTOR in HOMER as sage a Soul as he was could take a cherruping Glass and be very merry    Which AUSONIUS translates  Concussit quamvis potantem  NESTORA  Clamor  But we may sometimes by our imprudent Free∣doms betray weaker Christians into real Sin they for Instance by keeping the same Com∣pany or the same Hours which we do may act very wickedly for 'tis not to be supposed that they should have so much Metaphysicks as to di∣stinguish between an unseasonable Sitting for Dis∣coursesake or for Drink We must therefore abridge ourselves of many little Liberties which other Men lawfully take both in our Words and Behaviour in Company We must avoid not only Guilt but Scandal too because Scandal may do  as much Mischief in our Profession as Guilt and Men will be as far from imitating our Practice or practising our Doctrines if they believe us to be immoral as if we were really so We must at∣temper our Discourse over a GLASS with a de∣cent Chearfulness and as it were a pleasant un∣affected Seriousness For by this we may even then probably obtain the Conversion of some misguided Persons who are averse to our Com∣munion only for the general Neglect of this or at least we shall gain their better Opinion and we ourselves shall not be the worse Men for it I confess the wicked Hypocrisy of those pretended godly Ministers in CROMWELL'S Days that were carrying on Rebellion and Sacrilege with so much sanctimonious Preciseness has entailed such a lasting Scandal upon the outward Form of GODLINESS as hath made good Men ever since very cautious of using it but in Opposition to them we have perhaps carried the Point too far on the other Side we have given them Occa∣sion to censure some of our FREEDOMS as we have done their PRECISENESS Very worthy  of our Attention is the Behaviour of ARISTIP∣PUS ARISTIPPUS wore neither the formal Beard nor the sour severe Aspect of an IN∣STRUCTOR but mingling himself in all Com∣panies artfully pick'd Occasions as if by Chance to rectify an Error or prevent a Vice by this Means his Virtue became the Fashion and Men were reformed from Vice while they thought they were only growing polite  BECAUSE 'tis always expected DEAR SIR that Men of a liberal Education should be no Strangers to GOOD BREEDING we must by no Means neglect the Culture of that social Vir∣tue A VIRTUE that has all the Heightening of Embellishment and Gracefulness 'Tis Bene∣volence brought into Action with all the Assem∣blage of Propriety and Excellence 'Tis the Friend of Society and the Polish of Science It regulates Life and Conduct refines upon Happiness en∣larges the Circle of Enjoyment and is the Im∣provement of Pleasure It obliges us to behave with Decency and Elegance and quickens our At∣tention  to the good Qualities of others COM∣PLAISANCE is indeed its Resemblance but only as a SHADOW is of a SUBSTANCE It is only the Varnish the Masque of it GOOD BREEDING is the real Ornament of the Soul made visible and set in the fairest Point of Light Our modern Complaisance like false WIT has something glaring in it which strikes the Injudici∣ous with a kind of Admiration but like false WIT has no other Effect on People of Sense than to produce Ridicule and Contempt  THE Design of SCHOOLS the Use of UNI∣VERSITIES the Benefit of CONVERSATION should all in some Measure centre in this great PointGOOD BREEDING No one can be properly call'd a Gentleman who has not made Use of every Opportunity to enrich his own Ca∣pacity and settle the Elements of good Behaviour which he may improve at Leisure There are Numbers of Persons of our Profession who may justly claim Reputation for a single Excellence that in all others are defective and inconsiderable  for the Want of this general Accomplishment A Variety of Incidents agree to make the Want of it very common Bad Principles of Education when at SCHOOL an ill Choice of Acquaintance at entering into the UNIVERSITY the unhappy Bluntness of TUTORS who undertake to inform us and an untoward Disposition of our own But the Frequency or Confirmation of an Evil should never discourage us from endeavouring to sur∣mount it and if it is grown quite desperate there is the more Necessity for opposing it with the greater Vigour I must own that little Od∣dities and Singularities of Behaviour in a Gentle∣man of a liberal Education whose Mind is very much accustom'd to a Habit of Study and Thoughtfulness may be sometimes excused with Candour and Indulgence they may be only like Spots perhaps in the SUN or Asperities in a DIAMOND or may be as MOLES and DIMPLES which hinder not a Face from being beautiful tho' that Beauty be not regular or of the Number of those amiable Imperfections which we see in the  FAIR SEX and which we pass over without a strict Examination when they are accompanied with greater Graces  THERE is another Particular in my Opinion DEAR SIR of no small Consequence to the Sup∣port of our Character and that is to retain in our Memory our poor KINDRED and RELATIONS tho' never so remote for nothing is more unbe∣coming a Clergyman than a Forgetfulness either of his poor Friends or his Parents which is always imputed to an affected disdainful Superiority and Pride  A GENTLEMAN who was on the Road of ALGIERS some Years ago was an Eye and Ear Witness of the following StoryOne Day as some Christian Captives who had been ransom'd were going to be discharg'd the TownCruizers brought in a  Swedish  Vessel one of them hearing it was of that Nation and being from thence him∣self was very desirous to see the Crew when to his great Surprize he saw his own Father who  was Master of the Ship in Company the Son knew the Father but the Father who had lost him when a Youth many Years knew not the Son having given him up as dead long before not hearing any thing of him The Son soon made himself known to the Father who em∣braced him with great Tenderness but their Un∣happiness to meet in that Place was grievous to them both The young Man address'd himself to his Father in this Manner  The Slavery you are going into will be insupportable to you and soon put an End to your Life the Thoughts of which is Death to me I have been here a great many Years and know the Country the People and their Work if they will accept of me in your Room I will go back into Slavery and you shall go Home again I know if it should please GOD to enable you I shall be re∣deem'd if not GOD'S Will be done  The Moors readily accepted the Exchange so the Fa∣ther returned Home and the Son back in his Stead into Slavery  GELON the Son of HIERO King of SYRACUSE who after living upwards of Fifty Years died before his Father from a Moderation and Affection very uncommon among Men chose rather to want his Kingdom for EVER than be de∣priv'd of his Father whom he honour'd with a strict Duty and Obedience to the last Minute of his Life  JUSTIN in his History gives us a Descrip∣tion of Filial and Parental Affection which is ex∣tremely moving and pathetick 'Tis that Part where he is speaking of the approaching Death of AGATHOCLES

JACOB is attended with every Circumstance of FRATERNAL LOVE and Regard and deserves our most serious Conside∣ration  AND when JOSEPH'S Brethren saw that their Father was dead they said JOSEPH will peradventure hate us and will certainly requite us all the Evil which we did unto himAnd they sent Messengers unto JOSEPH saying Thy Father did command before he died say∣ing So shall ye say unto JOSEPH Forgive I pray thee now the Trespass of thy Brethren and their Sin for they did unto thee Evil and now we pray thee forgive the Trespass of the Servants of the GOD of thy Father And  JOSEPH  wept  when they  spake  unto him And his Brethren also went and fell down be∣fore his Face and they said Behold we be thy ServantsAnd JOSEPH said unto them Fear not for am I in the Place of GODBut as for you ye thought Evil against me but GOD meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this Day to save much People alive Now therefore fear ye not I will nourish YOU and your LITTLE ONES And he  comforted  them and spake  kindly  unto them  Gen l to    I am  DEAR SIR  Yours c  LETTER V  DEAR SIR  ANOTHER Virtue which we are par∣ticularly obliged to practise is CHA∣RITY We know the APOSTLE recommended Charity as the Principal of all Christian Virtues the Top and Height of our Re∣ligion he prefers it not only before FAITH and HOPE but even sets it beyond MARTYRDOM itself  If I give my Body to be burnt and have not Charity  c  We therefore that are the Preachers of Righteousness and the Propagators  of this blessed Religion must be eminently cha∣ritable in our Censures of other Men we must hope all Things of them believe the best not mistrust worse than does plainly appear excuse as far as possible their Failures and draw a Veil over their Infirmities we are conscious of that they may not be espied by others If there should be any so uncharitable as without Reason to censure our Behaviour so as to endeavour to lessen us in the Opinion of our Parishioners we must remember that Scandal never fails to recoil with double Force on the Authors 'tis a noxious but transitory Va∣pour which vanishes at the first Appearance of Light we must reprove them gently but not use them with Inhumanity and should they still keep pecking at us it will not be worth our while to inflict any heavy ecclesiastical Censure upon them SPIRITUALCOURTOFFICERS like knavish PHYSICIANS seek Employment enough for themselves and would be glad to see every Parish in a Diocese always diseas'd that Men might ap∣ply to them for Cure Besides our Enemies may be such that they may not deserve our Concern  so as to feel the Weight of our Indignation and the Vengeance of a Spiritual Court  A MERCHANT who resided sometimes at BENCOLEN bought a tame ELEPHANT there whom he suffer'd to go at large This Animal used to walk about the Streets in as civil and fa∣miliar a Manner as any of the Inhabitants and won∣derfully delighted himself in visiting the Shops particularly those which sold Herbs and Fruit where he was always well receiv'd excepting only by a Couple of brutal Coblers who dwelt in that Quarter These Fellows without any Reason took Offence at the generous Creature and had once or twice attempted to wound his PROBOSCIS with their Awls The noble Animal who knew it was beneath him to crush them did not disdain to chastise them He fill'd his large Muscular Trunk with a considerable Quantity of Water not the cleanest and advancing to them as usual cover'd them at once with a dirty Flood The Fools were laugh'd at and the Vengeance ap∣plauded  A NOBLE MASTIFF being once attack'd by a Parcel of little yelping Curs and scorning to encounter such Reptiles contented himself with pssing upon them as they crept at his Heels  WISE Men have upon all Occasions treated Slan∣derers with Contempt DIOGENES hearing a vociferous Assassin of Characters exclaiming against PLATO and charging him with a Thousand Faults told him with great Spirit and Justness  SIR your Malice is all thrown away you will no more be believed in speaking Evil of him than I should be if I spoke Good of you  And PELOPIDAS made a very proper Answer to some who to curry Favour with him impeach'd certain brave Soldiers of having spoke disrespec∣tively of him behind his Back  It may be said he but you will give me Leave to act according to the best Evidence I have as for their Actions I have been EyeWitness of them and as to their Words I have only heard what you have been pleased to tell me  WE must retain kind and easy Thoughts of those my Friend who differ in Judgment from us especially upon the Score of Religion to think as far as may be that they do it upon unfeign'd Conviction of Conscience and for the Sake GOD's Glory but however we must have a very great Care of unchurching whole Countries and Nations by the Blast of one cholerick ExpressionNor are we only obliged to this MENTAL CHARITY which will cost us nothing but to be also  liberally  charitable and bountiful of those good Things GOD has bless'd us with Of which there are two principal Branches HOSPITALITY and ALMS The Apostle does in two Places recommend HOSPITALITY to the CLERGY TIM iii and TITUS i in that early Time of the Church when the Revenues were so miserably small and therefore undoubtedly 'tis a Duty much more in∣cumbent upon us in these Ages when we are more amply provided for This has been always looked upon by the HEATHENS as a most generous Virtue and the Want of it a Note of Barbarity  AXYLUS  hospitable rich and good  Near fair  ARISBA  's Walls his native Place  He

in the Practice of HOSPITALITY  ALIKE  he thwarts the hospitable End  WHO  drives the free or stays the hasty Friend  True Friendship's Laws are by this Rule exprest  Welcome the coming speed the parting Guest  THE Doors of the noble  Roman  POPLICOLA were always open'd on the Outside to save the People the common Civility of asking Entrance where all were equally admitted where nothing that was reasonable was denied where even Mis∣fortune was a powerful Recommendation nay  I may add where Want itself was a powerful Me∣diator and next to Merit  TO strike a friendless or helpless Person the Stranger the Poor and Needy was reckon'd a cruel and barbarous Action in HOMER's Days When ULYSSES in the Disguise of a Beggar was struck by ARTINOUS the other Suiters tho' represented as profligate Persons are shock'd at and condemn the Action  Ill fits the Stranger and the Poor to wound  Unblest thy Hand If in this low Disguise  Wanders perhaps some Inmate of the Skies  They curious

To  JOVE  their Cause and their Revenge belongs  He  wanders  with them and he  feels  their Wrongs  HOM Odyss l v  THE Use of HOSPITALITY formerly was to entertain chiefly Travellers upon the Road be∣fore the World was generally provided with Houses of publick Entertainment but since its Office is to accommodate Persons of a lower Rank with more grateful Provision than their Fortunes can attain to to afford a free Recourse to decayed Per∣sons to eat with us whose Condition is not so ab∣ject as to take up with a formal ALMS and with the Remainder of our ample Provisions to let the POOR have a convenient Sustenance There are likewise several CANONS of the CHURCH to enforce this LIBERALITY but generally our LIBERAL EDUCATION makes us very seldom defective this Way unless it be some few of our Order that are sunk to the lowest Degree of Baseness whom neither GOD's Word nor Shame nor the Contempt of all good Men can work upon  WE must likewise to our Abilities be chari∣table to the POOR and this is our Duty to do in common with other Christians but then we have  higher Obligations to it because we must recom∣mend the Doctrines we preach more effectually by our EXAMPLE but chiefly because the Endow∣ments of the CHURCH do in some Measure be∣long to the POOR and for some Ages of Christia∣nity the Poor had a FOURTH PART to their Share of the ECCLESIASTICAL REVENUE  THE POOR are as it were the ORPHANS of HEAVEN they have a Demand on us as well as others for the Necessaries of Life and besides there is an Authority due to Distress and as none of human Race is above the Reach of Sorrow so none should be above hearing the Voice of it The Heathen Poet in commending the Charity of DIDO to the TROJANS spoke like a Christian  Non ignara Mali miseris succurrere disco  When sharp Misery to use an Expression of the divine SHAKESPEARE's has worn a Man to the Bone when his Eyes have lost all their Spirit  when his Hair and Beard is become wild and ne∣glected and every Muscle of his Face expressive of Famine and Despair when he is so depressed by Calamities as not to be able to look upwards or hope for Comfort nay unwilling to receive it as if so painful a Being was not worth preserving and Death the only Relief that was truly to be wish'd for every generous Heart must bleed methinks that HUMANITY should be liable to so much Woe and Wretchedness And there are in the World Persons of such great Merit such fine Qualities reduced to this melancholy Circum∣stance by such a Series of strange Accidents that one would think they were left by PROVI∣DENCE on Purpose for Objects on which the SON of FORTUNE should exercise his Huma∣nity and Virtue And believe me in serving any of these poor unhappy People we would find a more sensible Pleasure than can possibly arise from all the monied Bliss of Bags and Coffers the Splen∣dour of Equipage or the Excess of the Epicure's Table  THERE are some Persons indeed who rather chuse to fatten as Vagrants than sweet away their Lives in honest Labour and Industry and there are others with artificial Sores and artificial Legs who counterfeit the Dress and Guise of Wretched∣ness so well that no Painter can help them to a Circumstance which can heighten the Image but these have no Right to our Charity they are worth no Body's Notice but the Legislature's and as I think they are a publick Nuisance Mankind has a sort of Demand on every Magistrate to have it remov'd out of the Way But he must be of a savage Nature that would turn such Objects of Commiseration away with Contempt who have the strongest Claim for Compassion and Assistance such as those who are unable to support themselves by any Business or Employment such as those whose natural Pride and Modesty will not suffer them to complain who pine in secret without a Chance for Relief without a Friend to assist them or the most distant Hope of better Days who perhaps are forced to appear gay and smiling in the Midst of Agony and sit mournful Spectators  of the Profusion of others in Trifles which would be a comfortable Support and Happiness to them such as those who are compell'd to throw them∣selves on the Mercy of their FellowCreatures and trust entirely to Providence for their Preservation Were there no Divine Command that enjoin'd us to look upon these as Persons who had a natural Right to all we could spare we should beside I think reckon it our highest Glory to make them easy  THE History of PERU assures us that their INCAS esteem'd above all their Titles that the highest which call'd them LOVERS of the POOR A Name more glorious than the FAELIX PIUS and AUGUSTUS of the ROMAN Emperors which were Epithets of Flattery deserv'd by few of them  SOME of our polite Moderns have contracted such a Reverse of what we call URBANITY or civil Manners to the POOR that to see or meet a Person in Distress is offensive The very Aspect  of one in Need is a Disturbance to them and they are sure always to hate at first Sight This inhu∣mane barbarous savage Temper is the immediate Opposite to that noble Affection which the good EUMAEUS in HOMER had for the POOR and the helpless Stranger  MY  present Labours Food and Drink procure  And more the Pleasure to relieve the  POOR  Odyss l xv v  MY  Heart has learnt to glow  For other's Good and melt at other's Woe  Odyss l xviii v  'TIS  mine with Food the Hungry to supply  And cloath the Naked from th' inclement Sky  Odyss l xvi v  BY JOVE  the Stranger and the Poor are sent  And what to those we give to  JOVE  is lent  Odyss l vi v  AMONG the unhappy Wretches that lie in TARTARUS VIRGIL places the COVETOUS who only brood over their Treasures  Nec Par∣tem posuere suis  and give no Part of it to their FellowCreatures who stand in Need of it adding likewise that the Offenders this Way are the most numerous of any  THE poor WIDOW mentioned in Holy Writ threw her MITE into the TREASURY indeed a small Matter in itself but her own Want made it a great Proof of her charitable Disposition re∣trenching her own Subsistence and the Necessaries of Life to contribute to the Relief of the Neces∣sities of others  How does St PAUL magnify the CHARITY of the Churches of MACEDONIA  Cor viii  In a great Trial of Affliction the Abundance of their Joy and their deep Poverty abounded to the Riches of their LIBERALITY For to their Power  I bear Record yea and beyond their Power they were willing of themselves  DR HOUGH the late Bishop of WORCESTER was actuated by a secret celestial Influence to un∣dervalue the splendid Incumbrances the Over∣flowings of CHURCHREVENUES to diffuse Joy and Gladness thro' the tortur'd anxious Soul loaded with Affliction to support a falling Family to give Encouragement to the diligent Hand to preserve the Portion of the helpless Orphan and to raise the Head of the aged Widow the mourn∣ing Husband and the unhappy Stranger The Lowliness the Humanity the Sweetness of Dr HOUGH'S Temper prompted him daily to exert some noble Inclination or other for the Service of his FellowCreatures and made his Superiority in the Church not only a Blessing to Mankind but also the Source of innumerable Satisfactions an Ocean of Joys to himself Such is the Ef∣fulgence of the Reputation he has left behind him so great the Dignity of his CHARITABLE CHARACTER that it may challenge Time to con∣sume  the Trophies it has rear'd while every Monu∣ment erected by Art or Labour must yield to Age and moulder into Dust  THUS much for the MORAL QUALIFI∣CATIONS which we of the Clergy are under an indispensible Obligation to practise if we would approve ourselves unto GOD or our Hearers as eloquent Divines How a Clergyman is to be qua∣lified as to LEARNING  c  or that he may be an able Speaker or a WORKMAN that needeth not be ashamed I shall point out to you in our fu∣ture Correspondence  I am  DEAR SIR  Yours  c  LETTER VI  DEAR SIR  I SHALL now touch upon some general Qua∣lifications which all that are of the Body of the Clergy especially in these Ages of Li∣terature ought to be furnish'd with And first a moderate Skill in PHILOSOPHY is requisite in our Profession LOGICK I think is undeniably necessary for every one who pretends to Learning and Skill in the Arrangement and Disposition of his Sentiments or Ideas And if we would become Masters of fine Reasoning we must not only ap∣ply  ourselves closely to the Study of LOGICK but also take Care that the Aristotelian Authors we read be of the right sort This Country never produced a more modest useful or entertaining one to begin with in my Opinion than Dr WATTS He steers to the Coasts of this kind of Philosophy with as much Caution as if he was afraid of splitting upon the Rock of some unwar∣rantable Desire And what I reckon is very much to his Praise he never grows trifling or troubles us with what is of no Importance and has this Excellency beside which few Authors of this Rank have he writes in a Manner that is very taking and intelligible to young Gentlemen and furnishes them with all the necessary Materials for their Improvement  I HAVE always thought that LOGICK would go down more glibly with most of our young Students especially in some Colleges if they were not cramm'd so much with it I am sensible it would suit more with their Inclinations and they would not so often mutiny and declare War against  venerable CRACKENTHORP and BURGESDI∣CIOUS A Man who has a Genius and whose Profession should lead him to the Study of Divi∣nity should not methinks spend so much of his Time in Altercation as they do who grow grey almost in studying the Wiles and Subtilties of it But as to this Matter I resign my Judgment with entire Condescension to my Superiors I shall only add that to me there appears to be a great Deal of Difference between the Practice of ARISTOTLE and our modern Schoolmen He by the same mental Eye with which he took in the Power and Quality of every Object in Nature likewise survey'd the Properties of ELOQUENCE which at the same Time had but a second Place in his Esteem but the others who are such dear Lovers of Disputation dwell almost upon that single Province they want the Prudence and good Sense of ARISTOTLE tho' in this single Point they outdo him in Practice and Application  MR  Vide  OCILVY's Description of ASIA  c  Fol Edit p  OCILVY in his Description of PERSIA  tells us that the PERSIANS have all ARISTOTLE'S Works translated into ARABICK and call him DANJA PIALA that is the CUP of the WORLD for as we may use the CUP to refresh ourselves so we may likewise to Inebriation so according to their Opinion we may use and mis∣use Philosophy for they say that strong Liquor and Philosophy make good Orators but Excess of both makes  wise  Men  Fools  A MODERATE Skill in ETHICKS and the vulgar METAPHYSICKS PHYSIOLOGY and the MATHEMATICKS is also requisite DEAR SIR in our ProfessionMORALITY gives a Rationale a demonstrative Rectitude or Pravity of the Virtues and Vices we are speaking to it adds a mighty Gust especially to those of a philosophical Palate which a bare ScriptureReasoning has no Effect upon The vulgar METAPHYSICKS is essential to Divinity as 'tis handled in later Ages without some Portion of it we cannot be able to dispute or write or talk Divinity in pro∣per Terms PHYSIOLOGY and the MATHE∣MATICKS  seem the most remote from our Profession and yet we may see of what Conse∣quence they are to Divinity from reading Mr BOYLE'S LECTURES How strong how for∣cible is Truth physically and mathematically de∣monstrated how guarded and fortified is our Re∣ligion on all Hands how keen and poignant is every Argument cutting and mauling the Adver∣sary and driving him out of all his Entrench∣ments The most copious and solid the most compact and nervous Preachers which this Nation ever had were some of the Writers of these Lectures  THERE is also this Advantage arising from Physical and Mathematical Knowledge besides that of clearing up a Man's Thoughts and giving him a just Taste of right and wrong Reasoning it makes the Human Mind generally sensible of its own Worth and Excellence and perceive that 'tis intimately ally'd to that of the Divinity which must afford it a ravishing Satisfaction The very Reflection upon the Power and Nature of GOD  makes a good Man emulous of imitating his divine Perfections neither does he think that he is placed here as an idle Spectator when he observes the Dependance of the Parts of each System of the Creation and of the several Systems upon one another and how they all contribute to proclaim the Wisdom of that ALMIGHTY BEING that gave them Existence  How does such a Genius as  Vicar of  Farrington  in  Hampshire  c and Fellow of the Royal Society  Dr HALES break forth from amidst the Darkness that involves Hu∣man Understanding He appears like one of ano∣ther Species The Plan of this habitable Globe lies open to him he seems not unacquainted with the general Laws that govern it and while with the Transport of a Philosopher he beholds and admires the glorious Work he is capable of paying at once a more devout and rational Ho∣mage to his MAKER His EXAMPLE me∣thinks should inspire us with a generous Ambiti∣on should engage us to endeavour to improve  our Faculties and to exercise them conformable to the Rank we now hold among reasonable Beings and the Hope we have of being one Day advanced to a more exalted Station  WE of this Profession ought also to be qualify'd with a considerable Knowledge in the HOLY SCRIPTURES Our BLESSED LORD gives it as a Command to all Men to search the  John v  Scrip∣tures And St PAUL tells TIMOTHY  Tim iii  that the Scriptures are only able to make him wise unto Salvation We see how excellently learned all the Apostles were this Way whilst they ne∣glected the Use of other Literature Which is a∣bundantly sufficient to shew that we of the Clergy ought to make the Study of the Scriptures our chiefest Concern It is requisite therefore for us to be competent Masters of the PHRASEOLOGY of Scripture to be able to express divine Truths in ScriptureTerms thereby to avoid the frequent Mistakes which are incident to human Expressions  and to raise the Affections and warm the Hearts of devout Christians which this Eloquence does in∣finitely beyond all the little Arts of a prophane Rhetorick We must study the Scriptures to be able to alledge apposite Examples from thence of the Truths we are enforcing and to bring Proofs and Assertions of the same Truths out of the SA∣CRED ORACLES which to good Men are more undeniable than all the Demonstrations of REASON We must study the Scriptures to be able to understand some difficult Passages therein which are apt to lie uneasy upon our Minds till we have discovered the Sense of them which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest to their own Destruction and which Persons under our Care are often wont to ask our Information in We must also study them to be able to understand the Types and Prophecies of our BLESSED SAVIOUR to see how those formerly unintelligible Ceremonies of the Law are but expiatory Rites and receive their full Completion in the great Sacrifice of the SON of GOD how all the dusky Prophesies clear up and concenter in him what a World of strange fortui∣tous  Events hit in and conspire together to make out the Predictions concerning HIM 'Tis requi∣site that we should study the Scripture that we may be Masters of its CHRONOLOGY which alone of all other History affords the firm Grounds to that Art to be able to defend it against or reconcile it with the Oppositions of prophane Authors And lastly that we may be able to solve those seeming Contradictions which atheisti∣cal Men pick up in it to expose its Credit And as an Assistance to do this the better we must have a competent Skill in the GREEK and HEBREW LANGUAGES which these holy Books were wrote in to consider the Words and Construction of the original Text and what Variation the common Interpreters do make from it to find the Use of those and other synonimous Words in other Places to consider the particular Idioms Metaphors Transitions  c  in these Languages and by this Means oftentimes a very mean Knowledge in those Tongues may give a good and true Interpretation of a Place which has been blunder'd upon by very great Criticks  WE ought likewise to have â compleat Know∣ledge in CONTROVERSIAL DIVINITY Be∣sides the Controversies which we are to manage with ATHEISTS and INFIDELS by reason of the woful Divisions of Christianity which is crum∣bled into so many Sects 'tis the Duty of our Order to maintain the Truth against so many er∣roneous Opposers There are some of these that strike at the very Fundamentals of Religion and the main Articles of Faith such as are chiefly the SOCINIANS and PAPISTS others that en∣tertain very erroneous Opinions concerning the Discipline and Government of the Church as the ANABAPTISTS INDEPENDENTS and PRES∣BYTERIANS Now 'tis requisite we should have an Insight into all these Controversies to be able to answer all the Objections which such Men bring against our Religion to confute their Opinions with Arguments either brought from SCRIP∣TURE REASON or ANTIQUITY or all of them to know what Cavils and Exceptions they raise against the Arguments of our Divines and to prove upon them the Invalidity of such Replies  to shew what fallacious and jejune Interpretations they put upon Scripture and what Distortions and Falsifications they use towards ancient Writers Thus we must be every way prepared for our De∣fence and have every Weapon ready to enter the Lists with them and then when we are attack'd we cannot be thrown into any Confusion or Per∣plexity by their Grimace and Tone which I have always observ'd are mighty Helps to Dulness and are frequently made Use of by dull Fellows of all Persuasions  BUT tho' nothing can be so necessary as to have always ready those Arms which at the same Time can discover every controversial Quirk and defend us from those who would entangle us in the Snares of their questionary Debates yet when∣ever we have Occasion to speak of GOD or his ATTRIBUTES we ought to be inwardly af∣fected and in our outward Expressions appear to be so with the unmeasurable Distance there is be∣tween a most perfect and omnipotent CREATOR and a mere impotent CREATURE 'Tis not  without some Indignation as well as Astonishment that I see some among us who little considering what GOD is and what they themselves are pre∣sume to talk of him and his Attributes as freely and unpremeditately as if they were talking of a GEOMETRICAL FIGURE or a MECHANICAL ENGINE So that the least presumptuous Dis∣course of the Nature and Perfections of that un∣parallel'd Being as if they were Objects their In∣tellects can grasp and scruple not to dogmatise about those abstruse Subjects as freely as about other Things that are confessedly within the Reach of human Reason or perhaps are to be found among the more familiar Objects of Sense  HOW often do we hear Mr PUZZLE even from the Pulpit discourse of GOD and his AT∣TRIBUTES as if he comprehended the Height the Breadth and Depth of his Wisdom and knew the Extent of his Greatness and Power and all his Perfections With an Air of Confidence he tells us of such and such Things being consistent or inconsistent with the Deity how he is under  such and such a Necessity as if he were of the CabinetCouncil of the KING of KINGS If Mr PUZZLE is not too wise in his own Conceit to consult his Bible he will there see how vain and foolish and presumptuous 'tis to be engaged in such deep Researches  The SECRET THINGS be∣long unto the LORD but those Things which are revealed belong unto us and to our Chil∣dren for ever that we may do all the Words of this Law" is the Reflection of MOSES When I apply'd mine Heart to know Wis∣dom says the WISE MAN and to see the Business done upon the Earth Then I beheld all the Work of GOD that a Man cannot find out the Work that is done under the SUN Be∣cause tho' a Man labour to seek it out yet he shall not find it yea further tho' a wise Man think to know it yet shall he not be able to find it  SEEK not out the Things says the wise Son of SIRACK that are too hard for thee neither search the Things that are above thy Strength  But what is commanded thee think thereupon with Reverence for it is not needful for thee to see with thine EYES the Things that are in secret Be not curious in unnecessary Matters for more Things are shewn unto thee than Men understand For many are deveiv'd by their own vain Opinion and an evil Suspicion hath overthrown their Judgment Canst thou says JOB by searching find out GOD Canst thou find out the Almighty to Perfection It is as high as HEAVEN what canst thou do deeper than HELL what canst thou know  THE fallen ANGELS are describ'd by MIL∣TON in his PARADISE LOST as touch'd with a Curiosity like Mr PUZZLE'S of discovering the Measures of the DIVINE OECONOMY amidst the Horror and Melancholy they were in and un∣able to find out either the Antecedents or the Con∣sequents the Beginning or the End of it  OTHERS  apart sat on a Hill retir'd  In Thoughts more elevate and reason'd high  Of Providence Foreknowledge Will and Fate  Fixt Fate Freewill Foreknowledge absolute  And found no End in wandering Mazes lost  HOWEVER Mr PUZZLE may please himself with an Opinion of his own Wisdom he cannot with all his boasted Reason account for the Ways of NATURE even for the meanest of her Produc∣tions Can he tell me why the VIOLET is array∣ed in Purple why the SUNFLOWER glows wiih Yellow and the LILLY appears in White Can he so much as form a Conjecture by what surprizing Chymistry Nature from the same Soil extracts the delicious but different Juices of innu∣merable sorts of FRUITS Can he even tell me how the APPLE and CHERRY become round the PEAR and FIG oblong How the WAL∣NUT acquires a Shell that is broke with Difficulty whilst the MULBERRY growing near it has a Skin so tender that it scarce endures the Touch Can he tell me why GRAPES hang in Clusters why some Fruits on aspiring lofty Trees some on Bushes and others on the Ground If these  Things which seem so trifling are beyond the Reach of HUMAN UNDERSTANDING how great must be Mr PUZZLE'S Folly Assurance and Presumption when he takes upon him to com∣prehend the Ways and Dispensations of the Al∣mighty and insolently dares pretend to know the Extent of his Wisdom and Power and his other glorious Perfections This is more than an honest Heathen durst do who thought our Words ought to be few and those becoming the tardy Appre∣hensions of Men concerning the wise Dispositions of Providence and the Perfections of an omnipo∣tent Creator  SICUT  aeguum est Homini de Potestate Deorum timide et pauca dicannus  Cic Orat pro lege Manilia  WE ought to have my Friend a moderate In∣sight into CASUISTICAL POINTS We that have undertaken the Pastoral Charge have frequent∣ly under our Care heedless Persons that will run unadvisedly into Sin which they do not know to  be such and scrupulous Persons who forbear ma∣ny good and innocent Actions for fear of offend∣ing or whose Consciences trouble them when they have committed them Therefore 'tis requisite we should in some Measure be conversant in CASU∣ISTICAL DIVINITY to be able to understand how Circumstances create or improve the Pravity or Goodness of moral Actions what are the exact Boundaries of Vice and Virtue by what Manner Sins are aggravated or mitigated how Obligations are made confirm'd or vacated how far Oaths are obligatory and in what Sense imposed and taken how far 'tis lawful to comply with superior Authority and for the Sake of Peace and Union These Things we ought to be able readily to deter∣mine for the Sake of those who may frequently be supposed to seek Advice from us  WE must also have a competent Knowledge in ECCLESIASTICAL HISTORY and the Wri∣tings of the FATHERS WE who are the DE∣FENDERS of the FAITH ought to know how it has been deliver'd down to us what Opposition  has been made against it by SCEPTICKS and how it has been defended by the ORTHODOX what Afflictions have happened to the Church by persecuting EMPERORS and what Privileges it has gain'd by the pious and religious what great and holy BISHOPS have graced their respective SEES by their LEARNING WISDOM and PIETY and how many others have been the TORMENT of their DIOCESES and the PEST of the CHURCH WE must be conversant likewise in the divers COUNCILS of the several Ages to see with what Alacrity those HOLY FATHERS came from all Parts of the World to defend their Religion and to give an Account of their traditionary Faith in their respective Districts down from the apostolical Times what a pious Zeal they shewed and what learned Speeches they made against the heretical Innovations what ex∣cellent Explications of Faith they form'd and what admirable Canons and Laws of the Church WE must carefully study the Writings of the AN∣CIENT FATHERS especially the APOLOGE∣TICAL POLEMICAL and PRACTICAL to  know what admirable Vindications of Christianity they made against the malicious Imputationss of the PAGANS how by a wonderful Strength of Reason and Learning they overturn'd the very Foundation of the ETHNICK THEOLOGY made the Doctrine of the CROSS triumph over all the Glories of this World and even bore down the HEATHENS by the Force of their own RHETORICK to see the Heresies of the VA∣LINTINIANS MANICHEES ARIANS and others perfectly struck thro' with the Pens of these admirable Writers and lastly to find in their PRACTICAL TRACTS such a Force and such a Warmth as is inimitable in these later Ages that one may plainly have a Taste of the very Souls of these good Men in their Writings  I am  DEAR SIR  Yours  c  LETTER VII  DEAR SIR  WE of this Profession must endea∣vour to make ourselves Masters of a nervous sweet and musical STILE For 'tis not enough that we are barely heard but we must temper our Thoughts with the softest Harmony of Words that we may convince the Reason and move the Passions of our Hearers  Vide  Longin Sect  Harmonious Composition has not only a natural  Tendency to please and to persuade but inspires an Audience to a wonderful Degree with generous Ardour and Passion Fine Notes in Musick have a surprizing Effect on the Passions of Men Do they not fill the Breast with an inspir'd Warmth and lift the Heart into heavenly Transport The very Limbs receive Motion from the Notes and the Hearer tho' he has no Skill at all in Musick is sensible however that all its Turns make a strong Impression on his Body and Mind The Sounds of any musical Instrument are in themselves insig∣nificant yet by the Changes of the Air the Agree∣ment of the Chords and Symphony of the Parts they give extraordinary Pleasure as we daily ex∣perience to the Minds of an Audience Yet these are only spurious Images and faint Imitations of the persuasive Voice of Man and far from the genuine Effects and Operations of human Nature  WHAT an Opinion therefore may we justly form of fine Composition the Effect of that Har∣mony which Nature has implanted in the Voice of Man Does it not by an elegant Structure and  marshalling of Sounds convey the Passions of the Speaker into the Breasts of his Audience Does it not seize their Attention and by framing an Edi∣fice of Words to suit the Sublimity of Thoughts delight and transport and raise those Ideas of Dignity and Grandeur in others which it shares itself  'TIS the Judgment of the  CICERO  de Orat Lib    ROMAN Orator that to use one's self much to reading and writing is the only Way in the World to arrive at a Per∣fection and Grace of Stile We must therefore carefully read the best Authors and hear with the utmost Attention the most celebrated Preachers and be as studious of observing the Beauties of a charming Discourse as a FLORIST would the Colours of a fine AURICULA or a Botanist the Form of a curious PLANT All this I confess is very troublesome but give me the Genius that is thus exercised this is the Soil that Eloquence will thrive and flourish in As a TREE that is a good  Bearer shoots out into Expressions of Kindness and bends beneath its own precious Load to the Hand of the Gatherer when the Ground about it is meliorated and enrich'd with Culture So the Eloquence of a  cultivated  Genius will immediately break out into Swanlike Musick and flow from his Lips with such delicious Sweetness as to fill his Audience with Melody and Rapture  HORACE that great Judge of fine Writing bids us place before our Eyes the great polite An∣cients of ATHENS as Mirrors and Exemplars to form to elevate and enoble our Stile and Senti∣ments by  Vos Exemplaria  GRAECA  Nocturna versate Manu versate diurna  THIS my Friend must be our Ambition this should be the fix'd and lasting Scope of all our Labours we must spare no Pains to educate our Stile and Thoughts to Grandeur and im∣pregnate them with the noble Language and ge∣nerous  Ideas of others that our own Compositions may receive a kind of beautiful Glow and Flavour from theirs  NOR is an Imitation of the finest Pieces or copying out those bright Originals of ATHENS or ROME or our own or neighbouring Nations to be look'd upon as Plagiarism but as consistent with the nicest Honour Was not  I us'd says CICERO to translate a Book of PLATO's and ZENOPHON's by which I acquir'd this Advantage that in rendering the GREEK I had read over into Latin I not only fell upon the most elegant and yet the most usual Ex∣pressions but was in the Course of my Translations led into an Imitation of their Manner and to introduce some new Words into the Language of my Countrymen which I took Care should be just and apropo'  Vid  CICERO  de Orat Lib    CICERO the Imitator of ZENOPHON and PLATO Was not  Longin  Sect  HERODOTUS the constant Imitator of HO∣MER Did not  STESICHORUS was Inventor of the LYRICK CHORUS He was born according to SUIDAS in the  th  OLYMPIAD  If he had kept within due Bounds says QUINCTILIAN he seems to have been able to come the nearest to a Rivalship with HOMER  Vid  QUINCTIL  Instit  STESICHORUS and ARCHI∣LOCHUS  imitate him more than HERODOTUS And did not  IT was a common Report in the Age that PLATO lived in that BEES dropt Honey on his Lips as he lay in the Cradle And 'tis said that the Night before he was placed under the Tuition of SOCRATES the Philosopher dreamed he had embraced a young SWAN in his Bosom who after his Feathers were fullgrown stretch'd out his Wings and soar'd to an immense Height in the Air singing all the Time with an inexpressible Sweetness This shews at least what a great Opinion they then entertain'd of his Eloquence since they thought its Appearance worthy to be usher'd into the World with Omens and Prognosticks  PLATO more than all of them who from the copious HOMERICK Fountain has drawn a Thousand Rivulets to cherish and improve his own Productions HOMER had engross'd the Admiration of the learned World and wore the Laurels without a Rival the divine PLATO there∣fore was inspired with a noble Emulation to contend the Prize with him and tho' he did not succeed in his own Way yet he had noble Success in ano∣ther  for the Stile of his Prose has a poetical Sweetness Majesty and Elevation and he is justly esteem'd the HOMER of Philosophers The ROMAN Orator was so great an Admirer of him that he said  If JUPITER convers'd with Men he would talk in the Language of PLATO  A GREATER Prize than the Glory and Re∣nown of the celebrated ANCIENTS and MO∣DERS can never be contended for where Vic∣tory crowns with neverdying Applause when even a Defeat in such a Competition is attended with Honour and Advantage PLATO in all Probability had never written so smoothly de∣licately and poetically and with the nicest Deco∣ration had not his Godlike Spirit carried him for∣wards in the noblest Career to the Imitation of HOMER Neither do I think that CICERO had ever been the Sovereign of Forensian Pleading or that his Eloquence had been so exquisitely and beautifully finished had he not like a youthful Champion been ambitious of entering the Lists with the GREEKS and by applying himself en∣tirely  to the Imitation of those excellent Models united in his Manner the Force of DEMO∣STHENES the delicious Copiousness of PLATO the Sweetness of ISOCRATES and the divine Simplicity of ZENOPHON By this Means he so fertiliz'd his Genius that his Eloquence seems to pour itself forth not like the Streams of a little RIVULET but the Rapidity of a FLOOD  IF DEAR SIR Men of our Profession were but inspired with an Ambition and Thirst of ex∣celling one another in the Arts of fine Composi∣tion or emulous of imitating the Stile and Man∣ner of the best Writers this Nation affords their Reasoning would be much closer their Stile more harmonious and agreeable to the Ear and their Sentiments have more of the Spirit and Flavour of Divinity 'Tis evident that some in their Sermons rather than take Pains make Use of sordid and blemish'd Terms others again curtail and mince their Periods and a third fort shamefully spin them out into a vast Extent whereby their Life and Spirit evaporate and all their Strength is lost  by being quite overstretch'd Numerous Instances might be produced to prove this out of modern Sermons published by Men of no small Note and very sober Understandings  THAT a judicious  Vid  LONGIN Sect  Choice of proper and magnificent Terms has wonderful Effects in win∣ning upon and entertaining an Audience cannot I think be denied For 'tis from hence that the greatest Writers derive with indefatigable Care the Grandeur the Beauty the Solemnity the Weight the Strength and the Energy of their Expressions This cloaths a Composition in the most beautiful Dress makes it shine like a PIC∣TURE in all the Gaiety of Colour and in a Word it animates our Thoughts and inspires them with a kind of vocal Life But tho' fine Words are indeed the peculiar Light in which our Thoughts must shine yet they should not every where swell and look big For vulgar Terms are sometimes much more significant than the most ornamental  can possibly be They are easily understood be∣cause borrowed from common Life and what is most familiar to us soonest engages our Belief Some Writers very frequently make Use of com∣mon and vulgar Terms that have not the least Air of Elegance to recommend them yet by mu∣sically disposing and artfully connecting such Terms they cloath their Periods in a kind of Pomp and Exaltation and dexterously conceal their intrinsick Lowness  'TIS observable that some of our modern Preachers are more happy in the Stile than in the Sentiments of their Sermons Their Language is very often noble and sonorous but the Sense either very trifling or else so obscur'd by the sounding Phrases hard Metaphors and forced Expressions in which 'tis cloathed that 'tis difficult to find it out For my Part I should prefer a noble Sentiment that is depress'd with homely Language infinitely before a vulgar one that is blown up with all the Sound and Pomp of Expression Sublime Thoughts either by Means of a great Affinity they bear to  the Springs and Movements of our Souls or by their own superlative Lustre always outshine the Artifices of Rhetorick whose Appearance they cover with a Veil of superior Beauties For as the STARS are quite dimm'd and obscur'd when the SUN breaks out in all its blazing Rays so pompous Phrases and towering lofty Expressions are entirely overshadowed by the superior Splen∣dor of noble Sentiments  To the Formation of a Stile our Reading and Imitation if they be of the right sort must prin∣cipally contribute Whatever Sermons we hear or however polite and agreeable their Characters may be who preach them if the Authors we read or imitate are of another kind we shall find our Pa∣late strangely turn'd their Way We are unhap∣pier in this respect for being Scholars and Imi∣tators if our Studies and Patterns be ill chosen Nor can I for this Reason think it proper to call a Man  wellread  who reads and imitates many Authors since he must of Necessity have more ill Models than good and be more stuffed with  Bombast ill Fancy and wry Thought than fill'd with solid Sense and just Imagination  THO' to pass a right Judgment upon Compo∣sitions is generally the Effect of a long Experi∣ence and the last Improvement of Study and Ob∣servation yet since you request it I shall give you my Opinion concerning as many Authors in our Profession as I think it needful for you to read at present and you may single out which you please for your Imitation  IF you would have your Understanding charm∣ed your Affections captivated and your Passions directed and restrained by the Powers of Rheto∣rick you must read DR TILLOTSON There is Gracefulness there is Strength there is Spirit there is Dignity in all he says Such a divine Power and Energy I think never display'd itself in so easy and genteel a Flow and Command of Sentiment and Expression as the Sermons of this excellent Prelate  DR SOUTH has brought in a Species of Elo∣quence in his Sermons that is almost peculiar to himself and rarely to be met with among our Di∣vines He abounds with Turns of Wit which are inexpressibly fine and is prodigiously dextrous at Irony or Sneer His Strokes of Raillery are vastly genteel apposite and proper In Matters of Controversy with what Humour does he ri∣dicule his Adversaries and with what Dexterity does he sting in the Midst of a Smile How skil∣ful at managing an Argument Wit is not exclu∣ded by the Importance of the Subject nor its Weight lessen'd by the Humour  DR SCOT's Book of THE CHRISTIAN LIFE is admirably well written wherein we meet with the simple Language of Truth which tho' unadorn'd and without Pomp is pure and perspi∣cuous  THERE are lively Strokes of Passion and nu∣merous Beauties in  Archbishop of  York  DR SHARP's Sermons such  as shew the inherent Greatness of his Soul He strikes with powerful Might at the Adversaries of our Religion is enflamed with a servent and yet peace∣able Vehemence and Ardour His Stile particu∣larly excells in Smoothness and an easy and peace∣able Flow of the Words and yet it has such an Elevation as to excite an extraordinary Emotion in those especially who are to be brought over by soft and gentle Insinuation  BISHOP PEARSON'S Book on the CREED is a compleat and delicate Performance tho' he launches out into the Depths of Divinity and soars to the sublimest Eminence yet he never drops like many others unfortunately down but still preserves his own intrinsick Grandeur His Arguments run rapidly along immediately strike the Imagination inflame us with the Warmth and Fire of his own Genius and carry all before them by the Weight and Solemnity of Thought and Expression  THERE is something extraordinary something  more than humanly great in Dr ATTERBURY's Sermons And for this Reason has the inimi∣table and godlike Mr POPE unmov'd by Par∣tiality and unbiass'd by Envy awarded the Law∣rels to this great Author which flourish still green and will flourish as long as the Name of POPE has an harmonious Sound to an ENGLISH Ear To write in a Language that is graceful and proper that is distinguish'd by certain masterly Touches and an artful Polish that would have shone in the Days of ATTICK Elegance is the peculiar Cha∣racter of Dr ATTERBURY  IN passing their Judgment of Dr CLARK'S Sermons Men commonly muster his Imperfec∣tions so that the Remembrance of his Faults sticks indelibly in their Minds and that of his Ex∣cellencies is quickly worn out For my Part tho' I cannot by any Means be blind or partial to his Faults I have always thought that his Sermons are very grand and beautiful Compositions not like those of a low and grov'ling Genius who  never endangers himself by aiming at Grandeur but still goes on in the same uniform secure Track The whole Universe is scarce sufficient for the ex∣tensive Reach and piercing Speculation of Dr CLARK'S Understanding His lofty Genius is frequently aspiring to prodigious and amazing Heights which expose him to sudden Falls and such Falls sometimes work the Good of Men And besides in the Judgment of the best Cri∣ticks what is truly grand in the Midst of some Faults is preferable to that which has nothing extraordinary in its best Parts correct however throughout and faultless  FOR a smooth and polite Stile Mr SEED is very much admir'd That Theology of the Schools which he found undower'd as it were unattended and in a Dishabille he has enrich'd with all the Wealth the Pride and Ornament of Language He gives us some fine SIMILIES and ALLUSIONS which were they not too  much  BY too eager a Pursuit of Elegance says LONGINUS a Subject becomes dry and insipid And those Persons conti∣nues he commonly fail in this Particular who by an ill ma∣nag'd Zeal for a neat correct and above all a sweet Stile are hurried into a heavy nauseous Affectation  Vid  LONGIN  Sect    crowded would be very taking and agreeable like STARS they would cast a kind of Blaze about them they would illuminate and give a Lustre to his Sermons  THERE are very few Genius's that write more gracefully or copiously than  The present Bishop of  Oxford  Dr SECKER and he has this peculiar Talent that besides an extra∣ordinary Gravity a Spirit of Benevolence and Chearfulness glows in his Compositions which gives them a matchless Dignity not only persuades but even throws an Audience into Transport  I DO not know of an Author that meets with more general Applause than  Archdeacon of  Carlisle  Mr LAW Per∣sons  of different Humours Ages Professions and Inclinations all agree in the same joint Approba∣tion of his Writings which Union of Assent gives them an indisputable Title to our Esteem  WHEN you have a competent Share of ac∣quir'd as well as natural Taste my Friend you may easily discover the Value of any Performance yourself from a bare Recital of it For if it is in∣trinsically good the Mind is naturally elevated by it and so sensibly affected with its lively Strokes that it swells with Transport and an inward Pride as if what had been only heard had been the Pro∣duct of its own Invention But if we find that it transports not the Soul nor exalts our Thoughts that it calls not up into our Minds Ideas more en∣larged than what the mere Sound of the Words convey but on attentive Examination its Dignity lessens and declines we may conclude that what∣ever pierces no deeper than the Ears can never deserve our Applause or Imitation  THESE few Authors I have named to you ac∣cording  to their Time and Age have provided us with the richest ORE To their eternal Honour they have attempted to throw off the horrid Dis∣cord of antiquated Prose false Grandeur Impo∣tence and Puerility of Sentiments They have happily broken the Ice for those who are to follow them and who treading in their Footsteps may at Leisure heighten and polish the ENGLISH Language lead the Ear and Understanding to finer Pleasure and find out the true perma∣nent harmonious Idiom which alone can satisfy a just Judgment and godlike Apprehension  WHENEVER we are engaged in Compositions of the genteeler kind such as require Grandeur of Stile and exalted Sentiments it will then be of excellent Use to raise in ourselves such Reflections as theseHow in this Case would Dr TILLOT∣SON or Dr SOUTH have rais'd their Thoughts How would Dr SHARP Dr PEARSON or Dr ATTERBURY For these celebrated Preach∣ers being propos'd by us for our Pattern and Imitation will in some Degree lift up our Souls to  the Standard of their own Genius It will be yet of greater Use if to the preceeding Reflections we add theseWhat would Dr SECKER or Mr LAW think of this Piece Or what Judgment would they pass upon it How would they have express'd themselves It is really a noble Enterprize to frame such a Theatre and Tribunal to sit on our own Compositions and submit them to a Scrutiny in which such eminent Writers must preside as our Judges and be at the same Time our Evidence By this Method we must inevitably arrive at such a Perfection of Stile as to be able to give the ENGLISH Language its due MUSCLING as the PAINTERS say of a good PIECE its due Body and Proportion and also the natural Orna∣ments of Correctness Simplicity and Grace But of this more in my next Letter  I am  DEAR SIR  Yours  c  LETTER VIII  DEAR SIR  TO give Majesty Sweetness Politeness to a Discourse to make it strike to give it the finishing Touches of Eloquence to work it up with as much of the Pathetick as is needful we must have a moderate Skill in POE∣TRY A Man must be so much of a Poet at least as to be able to diversify his Stile with the finest FLOWERS of Sentiment and Expression But they must not run thro' the whole of a Discourse but only such particular Places as that they may  serve like JEWELS and DISTINCTIONS in DRESS For the finical Ornaments of a Dis∣course and a continued Affectation of Excellence gives Disgust 'tis not only unpleasant to the Ear but also to the Intellectual Faculties The same Observation holds as to our other Senses we are less pleas'd with those FLOWERS and PLANTS that have too high a Perfume and Fragrance than those that have but a moderate Scent and one would rather chuse to smell at the ROSE than the MUSKCRANESBILL Even in the hand∣ling FRUIT there is a Degree of Softness and Smoothness So a Sermon or Discourse if it has an undiversify'd Height'ning and Embellishment of Stile affords no lasting Pleasure Besides if it have all the Advantage of Poetical Colouring it ought to have some Shade that that which is illuminated may cast a greater Lustre  IF we would embellish our Stile by the Sub∣stance as it were and Groundcolouring of Poe∣tical Sublimity and Grandeur we must apply our∣selves diligently to the Study of the HOLY SCRIP∣TURES  It would be worth our while to digest them so in our Minds as to have them almost by Heart For we should have both nobler Senti∣ments and Expressions if we apply'd sacred to prophane Eloquence  THE Effect and Beauty of SACRED POE∣TRY you will perceive in some Measure tho' im∣perfectly from the two following SPECIMENS I have chose the Pathetick Kind and study'd to re∣present the Amiableness of Virtue by such Foils and Contrarieties as DAVID the Man after GOD'S own Heart furnishes us with and which serve as Graces if I may so speak in poetical Limning and render this Musick of the Passions more sera∣phick powerful and enchanting Had this been attempted by some abler Hand you would have been led with Delight and Rapture Anxiety and Concern by Turns thro' the Labyrinth of the Affections and interested whether you would or no in the Passions of the ROYAL PENITENT And in the EXHORTATION annexed you would presently have understood the Reality of  those Charms in the SACRED WRITINGS which by my weak Endeavours perhaps you will imagine not to be half so commanding natural and so powerful or capable of pleasing a judicious polite Ear and Muselike

how permanent is Pain  Reason unthron'd rebellious Passion's Sway  The fatal Produce of a lustful Day  Th' Anointed Head how vicious Joys expose  A Soul in Anguish and a King in Woes  LIGHT Spots on Ermine are conspicuous shewn  And doubly glare the Follies of a Throne  How then thy Crimes O DAVID shall we scan  Thou greatest Monarch Thou most Godlike Man  Or how the Frailty of our Frame confess  When GOD's distinguish'd Favourites thus trans∣gress  THE Sun adown the Steep of Heav'n had roll'd  And fring'd the purple Clouds with Skirts of Gold  When shunning Grandeur and the Noise of State  On the high Turrets of the Royal Seat  DAVID the Sweets of deep Reflection sought  Indulging all the Luxury of Thought  ON SION'S Mount the CedarFabrick stood  The ruin'd Honours of the TYRIAN Wood  Hence stretch'd his Eye around his large Domain  And much he joy'd him in his ample Reign  Pleas'd cou'd the Present with the Past compare  The Regal Glories with the Rural Care  The Rural Care fair BETHLEM's Hill renew'd  Which gently rising in the South he view'd  Life's Steps from that distinguish'd Day could trace  When tho' the youngest of the Sons of JESSE  He first was destin'd by the Sacred Oil  To splendid Cares and Eminence of Toil  How did he once the Bear and Lion slay  While yet a Swain to save the fleecy Prey  At ELAH how a beardless Strippling dare  The grim gigantick Terror of the War  Harsh whizz'd the Sling and with a thund'ring Sound  He fell enormous o'er a Length of Ground  AND now resolv'd he as new Scenes he chose  How still new Labours and new Dangers rose  To Envy doom'd a Sacrifice to fall  How twice he 'scap'd the vengeful Hand of SAUL  And how he foil'd the proud GOLIAH'S Arms  To merit MERAB'S falsely promis'd Charms  HE next the Wonders of his Sword admir'd  When gaily bold by MICHAEL'S Beauty fir'd  Two Hundred Foreskins of the Foe he paid  A double Dow'ry for the Royal Maid  The Royal Maid the daring Youth approv'd  Met her new Lord and unreserv'd she lov'd  NOR yet was the relentless Father won  By the True Subject or the Duteous Son  The thirsted Blood still sought he to attain  By Fraud by Force but Fraud and Force were vain  The faithful MICHAEL bade her Spouse depart  Mourn'd him as sick with all the Woman's Art  But thro' a Window secretly convey'd  To seek at RAMAH holy SAMUEL's Aid  THENCE fled He the devoted Life to save  Now to ADULLAM now ENGEDDI'S Cave  To PARAN'S Desart or the ZIPHITE's Wood  To Woods to Caves to Desarts SAUL pursu'd  TRUSTING a Foe before a Father's Wrath  He sought Protection in the Land of GATH

AKISH gave him ZICLAG's Town  And well the Hero merited the Boon  Till SAUL at GILBOA fell and by his Side  The Prince the other Half of DAVID dy'd  Much He the Father mourn'd but more the Son  He found a Sceptre but the Friend was gone  AND now what Wars He waged what Labours bore  Ere ISRAEL's Crown at Ease the Monarch wore  Employ'd his Thoughts while ISHBOSHETH in vain  Labour'd a lineal Title to maintain  Murder'd he fell who ill aspir'd to rule  A Traitor's Victom and a Party's Tool  The hated Crime the Murd'rers' Lives atone  And DAVID mounts the uncontested Throne  AMAZING Toils

Distinguish'd Glory and peculiar Grace  SION He sees by his victorious Hand  The Seat of Worship and of Empire stand  The PHILISTINES and AMLECK dread his Sword  And vanquish'd EDOM owns Him as her Lord  MOAB's proud Sons a forc'd Submission bring  And SYRIA mourns in Blood the Rashness of her King  Before His Arms the Strength of AMMON falls  And haughty HANAN trembles in his Walls  Repents the Insult that his Pride return'd  The Friend provok'd and proffer'd Kindness scorn'd  FEAR'D by his Foes by his Allies caress'd  Lov'd by his GOD and by his People bless'd  Remain'd there ought to fear

Pleasures terminate in Woe  URIAH's Garden near the Palace laid  Where twining Trees a private Arbour made  Yet from aloft the piercing Eye might trace  With Ease the Secrets of the close Recess

Luxuriant Beauty in the fraudful Shade  Her comely Limbs the curling Stream embrac'd  And flow'd but limpid flow'd around her Waste  To the King's View her snowy Charms were bare  He saw her naked and he own'd her fair  Fair  IT was necessary here to evade the Grossness of Expres∣sion which is so frequently to be met with amongst most of the prophane Poets except the GREEKS who were a People remarkable for Decency of this kind There is a pretty In∣stance of this Manner in AESCHYLUS's Tragedy of AGA∣MEMNON where the CHORUS says      I neither saw nor speak what follow'd next  But  CALCHAS

and Fallings now the Faintings and Languishings now the Terrors and Astonish∣ments of Despair venting themselves in such high amazing Strains as in the st Psalm Mr  Dean of  Armagh  DANIEL'S Paraphrase of it is extremely beautiful Part of which runs thus  GREAT GOD with conscious Blushes lo I come  To cry for Pardon or receive my Doom  But oh I die when I thine Anger meet  Prostrate I lay my Body at thy Feet  How can I dare to ask for a Reprieve  Must I still sin and will my GOD forgive  Thy Justice cannot let thy Mercy flow  Strike then oh strike and give the deadly Blow  Do I still live and do I live to prove  The inexhausted Tokens of thy Love  This UNEXAMPLED GOODNESS wounds me more  Than e'en the Wrath I merited before  Oh I am all a Blot the foulest Shame  Has stain'd my Scepter and disgrac'd my Name  A Name which once I could with Honour boast  But now the Father of his People's lost  THO' darkly thy mysterious Prophet spake  While from his Lips the fatal Message brake  Fix'd and amaz'd I stood confounded whole  Too soon his dreadful Meaning reach my Soul  Thou art the Man  has fix'd a deadly Smart  Thou art the Man  lies throbbing at my Heart  I amwhate'er thine Anger can express  Nor can my Sorrow make my Follies less  Rais'd and exalted to the first Degree  Thy heav'nly Will had made the Monarch free  The fond Restraint of Man I scorn'd to own  But grasp'd the full Possession of a Crown  Indulg'd in Ease I rul'd without Controul  And to its utmost Wish enjoy'd my Soul  Vain Boast of Pow'r which vanish'd into Air  Since I forgot the LORD who plac'd me there  Was it for this thou gave the glorious Land  And thy own Flock committed to  my  Hand  "Was I the Shepherd to go first astray  Till Innocence itself became a Prey  Ah no the Fault was mine I stand alone  Be thine the Praise who plac'd me on the Throne  The Guilt the Folly and the Shame my own  How vile must I appear how lost a Thing  The worst of Tyrants and no more a King  O do not thou my abject State despise  But let my Soul find Favour in thine Eyes  WHENE'ER the horrid Deed I backward trace  My Soul rolls inward and forgets her Peace  Waking I dream and in the silent Night  A frightful Vision stalks before my Sight  The pale URIAH walks his dreadful Round  He shakes his Head and points to every Wound  O foul Disgrace to Arms who now will go  To fight my Battles and repell the Foe  Unhurt the Coward may to Ages stand  The Brave alone can die by my Command  "Oh hold my Brain to wild Distraction wrought  I will not cannot bear the painful Thought  Oh do not fly me for thy Mercy's Sake  Turn thee oh turn and hear the wretched speak  Ev'n selfcondemn'd thy kneeling Servant save  And raise a drooping Sinner from the Grave  SPEAK mighty GOD and bid thy Servant live  Let my charm'd Ears but hear the Word  forgive  My joyful Muse shall bear the Tidings round  While list'ning Worlds shall catch the grateful Sound  Thus other Sinners shall obedient prove  And taught by me shall wonder at thy Love  BUT oh if stricter Justice must be done  If my relentless Fate comes driving on  I stand the Mark whatever is decreed  Be ISRAEL safe but let its Monarch bleed  "On  me  on  me  thy utmost Vengeance take  But spare my People for thy Mercy's Sake  Oh let JERUSALEM to Ages stand  Build thou her Walls and spread her wide Command  So shall thy Name for ever be ador'd  And future Worlds like me shall bless the LORD  IN every Page of the Royal Psalmist's Com∣positions there are such pathetick and exalted Expressions of FEAR and LOVE HOPE and TRUST and DELIGHT in the Deity that 'tis no Wonder if such a genuine and sublime Peni∣tence was able to cover a MULTITUDE of SINS In the CLOSET he seems to be something more indeed than Man his Prayers are offer'd with that Fervency of Zeal that they are like the Incense of an ANGEL or SAINT in Glory  WHAT SONG of TRIUMPH was ever writ in higher or more exalted Strains than that of  GIVE Ear O ye HEAVENS says he and I will speak and hear O EARTH the Word of my MouthMy DOCTRINE shall drop as the RAIN My SPEECH shall distill as the DEW as the small RAIN upon the ten∣der HERB and as the SHOWERS upon the GRASSBecause

the Works of Omnipotence in a magnifi∣cent Light and paints the Deity in all his Majesty and Splendor as in that Description of the Creation of LIGHT and the EARTHLY GLOBE which has been already applauded by  Vid  LONGIN on the Sublime Part Section  LONGINUS  The  BOILEAU undertook the Defence of this Passage and bravely defended it against HUET and LE CLERC who pretended that LONGINUS never saw it tho' he has actually quoted it and that he never read MOSES tho' he has done so exemplary a Piece of Justice to his Merit and left so candid an Acknowledgement of it  Vid BOILEAU  's Works in four Vols    to and Mr  SMITH  's Translation of  LONGINUS  where he has a Note upon this Passage  JEWISH LEGISLATOR says he having conceived a just Idea of the Power of GOD has nobly expressed it in

SORROW flowing in such a  natural prevailing PATHOS as in the Prophet JEREMY One would think that every Letter was wrote with a TEAR every WORD was the NOISE of a BREAKING HEART and that the Author was one that never breath'd but in SIGHS nor spoke but in a GROAN  WHEN in turning over the sacred Page I read of SIMEON waiting for and expecting DEATH as weary LABOURERS do the EVENING SHADES or the REWARD of their WORK when I read St PAUL with humble Impatience expressing his devout Desire of Death and Dissolution I must own my Soul glows with Desires to die the  DEATH of the RIGHTEOUS to breathe itself forth not in a GROAN but an EJACULATION  WHEN the same St PAUL appears before the CORINTHIANS and discourses to them on the RESURRECTION and before his Judges FESTUS and AGRIPPA and harangues upon TEMPERANCE and the DAY of JUDGMENT how full of Life and Spirit how full of the Pathe∣tick is his Diction Are not his very JUDGES drawn as it were by an ENGINE into Compas∣sion and Gentleness and made to shudder with FEAR and TREMBLING By the Dignity of the Subject and the Strength of his Arguments AGRIPPA was rous'd and alarm'd and almost persuaded to turn CHRISTIAN This great APOSTLE even in the Opinion of  THERE is a strong Probability that LONGINUS says his ingenious Translator was not only acquainted with the Writings of the Old Testament but with those also of the New since to a Manuscript of the latter in the VATICAN Library there is prefix'd a Passage from some of this Author's Writings which is preserv'd there as an Instance of his Judgment He is drawing up a List of the greatest Ora∣tors and at the Close he says And further PAUL of TAR∣SUS the chief Supporter of an Opinion not yet established FABRICIUS I own has been so officiously kind in his BIELIOTHECA GRAECA  L    c  as to attribute these Words to Christian Forgery but for what Reason I cannot conjecture If for any of real Weight and Im∣portance certainly he ought not to have conceal'd them from the World  IF LONGINUS ever saw any of the Writings of St PAUL he could not but entertain an high Opinion of him Such a Judge must needs applaud so masterly an Orator For where is the Writer that can vie with him in sublime and pathetick Eloquence DEMOSTHENES could rouse up the ATHENIANS against PHILIP and CICERO strike Shame and Confusion into the Breasts of ANTHONY or CATALINE and did not the Eloquence of St PAUL tho' bound in degrading Fetters make the oppressive the abandon'd FELIX tremble and almost persuade AGRIPPA in spite of all his Prejudice to be a Christian HOMER after his Death was look'd upon as more than human and Temples were erected to his Honour and was not St PAUL admir'd as a God even whilst he was on Earth when the Inhabitants of LYSTRA would have sacrificed to him Let his Writings be examin'd and judg'd by the severest Test of the severest Criticks and they cannot be found deficient nay they will appear more abundantly stock'd with sublime and pathetick Thoughts with strong and beau∣tiful Figures with nervous and elegant Expressions than any other Composition in the World  Vid  Mr  SMITH  's Preface to his Translat of  LONGIN  p    LONGINUS  eminently distinguish'd himself by his inimitable Quickness and Sublimity of Stile  THE HOLY SCRIPTURE with regard to the divine Original and Principle of its Laws and as to the Weight of Authority and Extent of Utility is preferable to all the Volumes in the World In the SACRED PAGE we are taught not by Disputations endless and full of Quibbling  but by the Authority and Command of the AL∣MIGHTY to hold fast our Integrity to subdue our Passions to check all our Affections to re∣strain our very THOUGHTS our EYES our HANDS from all Manner of EVIL The Vices the Frauds of Mankind are threatned to be punish∣ed with Perdition Ignominy with Chains with Stripes with Banishment from the Presence of the DEITY and with ETERNAL DEATH But we see that sincere that just and honest Endea∣vours are to be crown'd with Honours and Re∣wards  GLORY and IMMORTALITY The HOLY SCRIPTURE in short is above all Pa∣negyrick 'Tis very truly and emphatically stiled by the APOSTLE THE GIFT OF GOD the Mother of all Eloquence 'Tis not to be equall'd either for the Flow and Copiousness of the Ex∣pression or the Grandeur of the Subject by the most eloquent of the Heathens Every Sentence is lofty and sublime and casts as it were a GLORY round it  I am  DEAR SIR  Yours  c  LETTER IX  DEAR SIR  WE of this Profession ought to have a becoming Smoothness of Deli∣very and a lively spirited Man∣ner of Expression There are some Men so harsh so clownish so effeminate in their Tone of Voice so stuttering so drawling and spiritless in their Expression so ungraceful aukward and slovenly in their Manner of speaking that they can never be heard discoursing even on the most important Subjects with Pleasure  AND here we may perceive the Capital Mistake of those who are entrusted with the Education of Youth they frequently advise Parents to breed up their Sons to the Church without ever consulting their Abilities or Inclinations The forming of Youth was reckon'd a Matter of that Consequence by the polite ATHENIANS that the Education of their Children was under the Direction of particu∣lar INSPECTORS and CENSORS accountable to the STATE And indeed it requires the great∣est Delicacy and Strength of Mind to perform so difficult and arduous a Task as it ought 'Tis exceedingly hard in the Beginning especially to pry into the Souls of young Persons and discover the different Bent of Genius in each not to say that the DAWN of Genius is often as flattering as the SERENITY of an APRIL MORNING or the Bloom of a forward FLOWER seen and admired one Moment and lost in the next  A Master or Tutor ought above all Things to have a special Attention to the Cast of Genius with which Nature has endow'd his Pulpils or  Scholars For we perceive that in the ARTS the same Schools as it were furnish and the same CRAFTSMEN and MECHANICKS form Scholars in the several Arts each unlike the one to the other yet all of them excellent in their Kind therefore the Tutor or Teacher ought to accom∣modate his Manner to the several Capacities of Youth He must try what becomes them best what Lenghts they can go with regard to their Voice their Strength their Lungs and if he finds they have any thing downright averse in their Natures for the Attainments necessary in our Pro∣fession or any thing shocking in their Manner of speaking which the Refinements of Art and Study cannot remedy he should advise them to turn their Views to some other Way of Life and not unmercifully beat and flog out of them as is the Practice of but too many the few Grains of Ge∣nius Nature has given them An ingenuous Mind will sooner be wrought upon by mild Treat∣ment than by Violence and Rigour which rather seem a Discharge of the Master's Spleen and Pas∣sion than intended for the Scholar's Advantage  There is a certain Hesitancy and Bashfulness in some Natures which must not be check'd but push'd forward with as much Care and Diligence as a skilful ARTIST in GARDENING would the Circulation of an EXOTICK PLANT in his GREENHOUSE or a TREE in his ORCHARD that is a bashful Bearer SEVERITY should never be made Use of till all gentler Me∣thods have been tried and found unsuccessful then indeed it may be practis'd as the ultimate Remedy but then too with Discretion so as to carry nothing of Revenge along with it so as to be no greater than Necessity requires and to con∣tinue no longer than till it produces either Amend∣ment or discovers an utter Incapacity for Learn∣ing  I MUST own the Master is not always to blame for recommending Youth that are a little thick∣skull'd have slender Parts and slow Apprehen∣sions to go into our Profession because I be∣lieve 'tis sometimes the Parents' Fault their take a particular Liking to it and therefore de  e their  Sons may be of it But in so great so important and weighty an Affair of Life Parents ought to consider the Capacities of their Children more than their own Inclinations Yet Masters are so far to blame as when they cannot keep their Tem∣per and bear the Tediousness of learning those with Patience who have none of the quickest Parts They ought to wait the Issue of their Hopes how∣ever long it may be deferr'd There are many excellent Tempers says an ingenious Person which are worthy to be nourished and cultivated with all possible Diligence and Care that were never design'd to be acquainted with ARISTOTLE TULLY or VIRGIL and there are as many who have Capacities for understanding every Word those great Persons have writ and yet were not born to have any Relish of their Writings Such therefore as I intimated before should be sent to some Mechanick Way of Life without respect to their Birth if Nature design'd them for nothing higher for 'tis no Guilt to be an honest plain TRADESMAN or MECHANICK But before they go to what they have the most natural Pro∣pensity  to let them be allur'd to Habits of Virtue and their Minds train'd to a Sense of Honour and Religion whilst they are in the Simplicity of their native Innocence full of Shame and capable of any Impression from that Grace of Soul and let not the Sparks of Virtue be extinguish'd in them for Want of Patience Care and Culture the most excellent Natures are soon depreciated and spoil'd by Negligence and Impatience and Want of proper Application to exalt them into good Habits  PLANTS and VEGETABLES are cultivated into the Production of finer Fruit than they would yield without that Care NATURAL HISTORIANS tell us that no Fruit grew originally among us besides HIPS and HAWS ACORNS and PIGNUTS with other Deli∣cacies of the like Nature that our Climate of itself and without Culture can make no farther Advances towards a PLUMB than to a SLOE and carries an APPLE to no greater Perfection than a CRAB that our MELONS our PEACHES  our FIGS our APRICOCKS and CHERRIES are Strangers among us imported in different Ages and naturaliz'd in our ENGLISH GAR∣DENS by Culture and that they would all de∣generate and fall away into the Trash of our own Country if they were wholly neglected by the PLANTER and not cultivated but left to the Mercy of our SUN and SOIL Nei∣ther I think can we hope to model a ten∣der conscious Spirit into Acts of Virtue with∣out the same Method as is used to improve the VEGETABLE WORLD to cut TIMBER or give new Shape to a Piece of STONE or MARBLE  OUR modern forward SLIPS of Quality put forth nothing but BLOSSOMS and continue a kind of overgrown Children all their Lifetime The Reason is YOUNG MASTER is not suffer'd by the FOND MAMMA to be too much plagued with going to SCHOOL for fear of breaking his Spirits making him bookish and so fit for nothing but to make a PARSONHow do these Sparks  behave themselves in the Prime of Life In RE∣LIGION they are generally FREETHINKERS in the worst Sense of the Word from the want of an early pious Education in POLITICKS they are Slaves to the Party whose Principles they were brought up in in MORALS they are loose and above all other Evils detest SOLITUDE and MATRIMONY the first because it would make them converse with themselves and the latter be∣cause it might lead them into the Company of a Person towards whom they know not how to be∣have  viz  that of A MODEST WOMAN  As to a PUBLICK or PRIVATE EDUCATION 'tis not yet determined I think which is most eli∣gible sometimes the one and sometimes the other is preferr'd according to the Fancy of People of fine Taste As in ancient PERSIA the Youth of Quality was put to a polite MEDE for Education so the Child of Distinction about ********* is happy in having his ************** for his publick or private Tutor As young Master is only design'd for a fine Gentleman it  would give an unhappy Biass to his InfantMind to make a good found PROTESTANT an orthodox CHRISTIAN or a loyal SUBJECT of him the Child to be sure is too young to imbibe the Prin∣ciples of Disobedience to his GOD or his PRINCE from the Policies and Maxims of a ******** Teacher there is no Need to make LOYALTY of either Kind habitual to it or to take Care that DISLOYALTY do not become so in its Stead  BUT if you were to demand my Opinion con∣cerning a publick or private Education which ought to have the Preference I should tell you that the Youth who is like a weak BARK which in boisterous SEAS and WINDS carries too much SALL and too little Ballast whose JUDGMENT is weak and unsteady and whose PASSIONS are light and violent as HURRICANES ought un∣questionably to have a private Education but se∣dater Tempers a publick one It ought no more to derogate from the Excellency of the latter be∣cause of the Miscarriages of some unhappy Na∣tures than some few SHIPWRECKS ought to  discredit NAVIGATION or the failing of some few TRADERS disparage ART and INDUS∣TRY 'tis enough that the experienced and skilful the careful and diligent do generally sail success∣fully What valuable Treasures have been deriv'd to Posterity from those famous Schools of PY∣THAGORAS SOCRATES ZENO PLATO ARISTOTLE instituted at ATHENS and those of POLYBIUS CARNEADES DIOGE∣NES CRITOLAUS and others set up at ROME by whose noble Precepts and Instructions were formed the learned and eminent Heroes of Anti∣quity that have done Honour to Human Nature and left such Tracts of Glory behind them as distinguish the Years in which they acted their Parts from the ordinary Course of Time  BUT to resume As there is a Manner of speaking in which nothing shocks an Audience nothing can disgust nothing can displease it a Manner in which there is nothing that is uncouth harsh or untunable nothing that is aukward rus∣tick or slovenly nothing that is drowsy dry  and spiritless we must follow that and endeavour to speak quickly smoothly and gently For an Audience of all Things cannot endure to hear a SERMON drawlingly preached or the Divine Ser∣vice negligently slubber'd over read in a lifeless cool dispassionate Manner or yet spoke with puf∣fing and swelling Such is the Effect of a feeling Manner of speaking that it becomes as it were the PICTURE of our own Minds and conciliates the Esteem and Attention of our Hearers The COMMON PRAYER especially makes a deeper Impression upon them when they perceive in us a proper Fervour and Emotion of Soul For as no MATTER is so combustible as to kindle with∣out the Application of Fire so no one's Mind is so susceptible of the Power of DEVOTION as to catch its Blaze unless we when we read Pray∣ers appear to be so affected as to be all of a Flame ourselves In short a becoming PATHOS and Energy of Diction animates an Audience with uncommon Life and Spirit and gives mere Words the Force as it were of Inspiration  How pathetick and beautiful is URANIUS'S Manner of reading the COMMON PRAYER HE reads the whole Service so distinctly so emphatically so fervently that 'tis next to an Impossibility to be unattentive Peoples' Eyes and Thoughts cannot wander as they usually do when some others read but are con∣fin'd to their Prayers their Minds are really affected and fervent Wishes accompany their Words For HE reads the CONFESSION with such a resign'd Humility the ABSOLU∣TION with such a comfortable AUTHORITY the THANKSGIVINGS with such a religious JOY as makes his HEARERS feel those Af∣fectons of the Mind that HE himself does they seem transported in their Addresses to the ALMIGHTY and as it were in HEAVEN  I would propose this Clergyman as a Pattern to all those of our Profession who murder the DIVINE Service by their Manner of reading it The EXAMPLE of such an excellent Reader would make those that are afraid of  stretching their Mouths and spoiling their Lungs learn to read with Clearness Loudness and Strength and others that affect a rakish negligent Air by folding their Arms and lol∣ling on their Book would be taught by HIM a decent Behaviour and a comely Erection of Body Those that read so fast as if im∣patient of their Work may learn by HIM to speak deliberately There are another Sort of Persons whom we may call PINDARICK READERS as being confin'd to no set Mea∣sure these pronounce five or six Words with great Deliberation and the five of six subsequent ones with as great Celerity The first Part of a Sentence with a loud exalted Voice and the latter Part with a low submissive one Some∣times again with one sort of Tone and imme∣diately after with a very different one These Gentlemen might learn of my admir'd READ∣ER URANIUS an Evenness of Voice and Delivery and all who are innocent of these Af∣fectations but read with such an Indifferency as if they did not understand the Language or  were reading a BALLAD or NEWS PAPER may be inform'd by HIS EXAMPLE of the Art of reading Prayers movingly and fervently how to place the Emphasis and give the pro∣per Accent to each Word and how to vary the Voice according to the Nature of the Sentence  How great an Influence would the Service of our Church have on the People containing the best Prayers that ever were compos'd and that in Terms most affecting most humble and most expressive of our Wants and Depen∣dance on the Subject of our Worship dispos'd in a most proper Order and void of all Con∣fusion what Influence I say would these Prayers have were their exalted Sense not de∣preciated by the dispassionate Indolence of the Readers here complain'd of but deliver'd in the Manner that URANIUS does with a due Emphasis and apposite rising and Variation of Voice the Sentence concluded with a gentle Ca∣dence and in a Word with such an Accent and Turn of Speech as is peculiar to Prayer  WE of this Profession my Friend ought to keep clear of the INDECENCIES of AFFEC∣TATION in Preaching For Affectation fills the Mouths of Men with Bombast and Fustian and gives them such Sentiments as proceed rather from a lofty Swelling and Tumor than a true Greatness of Mind and such an ungraceful Action Dress and Delivery as makes them perfectly ridiculous GERYO has furnished himself with a well comb'd Toupee and an immutable Countenance has got a Jauntee Air opposes his Front to the Ladies stares sedately between every Sentence nor will he give over this his surprizing Rhetorick till he has star'd every one of his fair Audience out of Countenance  DIABLINTES has got it into his Head that the WHITE GLOVE is a great Help to a po∣lite Preacher if used with Skill and Judgment The displaying a fine Glove as white as Lilly when the Hand waves gently along with a soft smooth Period adds an irresistable Force says DIABLINTES to whatever you deliver gives  it the Stamp of Sublime and makes it appear with an inimitable Grace and Elegance Instead of pushing your Adversary Home in a Contro∣versial Sermon continues he with MODE and FIGURE MAJOR and MINOR there is no more necessary but to make an Extension of that Hand on which you wear your Preaching Glove and you'll infallibly be adjudged Victor by your Auditors  SANDROCOTUS holds the thumping the CUSHION as a powerful Auxiliary in the Pulpit The thumping it every now and then may sup∣ply a Pause says he express JOY ANGER or several other Passions according to the Action or Manner you use in thumping it A late celebra∣ted Preacher adds he who generally had the good Fortune to please on any Emergency in the Pulpit had immediate Recourse to the EXPRES∣SIVE THUMP and seldom without Success  CYZICENUS thinks he charms both the great and small Vulgar with the Assistance of a beauti∣ful  WHITE HANDKERCHIEF Whenever he is like to be at a Loss he never makes a HUM or HA but whips from under his Gown his DE∣CLAMATORY HANDKERCHIEF in so pretty genteel and elegant a Manner that it immedi∣ately causes a Redundancy of Wit he tells you Fluency of Words Propriety of Expression and Impetuosity of Diction  c  WE see a thousand Absurdities committed DEAR SIR by these finical affected Coxcombs which the very Vulgar I am sure would be a∣sham'd of and the most illiterate Hearer condemn  But if any one be surpriz'd says the ROMAN ORATOR that these Things are discerned and mark'd by the most vulgar Audience he need but only reflect how great and incredible the Force of Nature is in every Thing especially in this for every Man has within him a cer∣tain tacit Sense which enables him to distinguish what is right or wrong in Arts and Sciences and this without Instruction and Information If this Observation holds good with regard to  Pictures Statues and other Works in critici∣zing which they have less Assistance from Na∣ture 'tis much more evident in the Judgment they form upon Words Harmony and Deli∣very because this is a Judgment implanted in the Senses that are common to all Mankind 'Tis a Faculty which Nature never meant that any rational Creature should be absolutely with∣out  CICERO  de Orat Lib    THE common People are not such stupid Clod Pates tho' they want Politeness but they can judge of the Refinement of those Pleasures which Nature has dictated I have I assure you seen both Wit and Pleasantry and Discernment among them and as perfect as is needful to their Cir∣cumstance  A CERTAIN LORD taking a Walk with a Gentleman near a Country Village saw a poor BOY dragging a CALF Home with both his Hands  You shall see says my LORD laugh∣ing  I'll make the Boy leave his Calf  sup∣posing the Boy would have pull'd off his HAT to him but being disappointed  Sirrah says he don't you see me and d'ye keep your Hat on" "A'n't please your LORDSHIP to hold my Calf reply'd the Boy I'll pull it off but at present you see I have my Hands full  AN illiterate COUNTRY FARMER once took a Fancy to hear the LATIN DISPUTES of DOCTORS at an UNIVERSITY He was ask'd what Pleasure he could take in viewing such Com∣batants when he could never know so much as which of the Parties got the better  For that Matter reply'd the FARMER I a'n't such a Fool neither but I can see who's the first that puts the other in a Passion  Nature herself dictated this Lesson to the Farmer that he who had the better of the Argument would be easy and wellhumour'd but he who was unable to support his Cause by Reason would naturally lose his Temper and grow violent  I HAVE seen low and uncultivated Minds sur∣prizingly affected on beholding those noble Pieces of Painting the celebrated CARTOONS of RAPHAEL at HAMPTON COURT To see the silent Eloquence the earnest enforcing Look the devout Gesture of St PAUL preaching is not a dumb Entertainment to the Eye of the Vulgar but a speaking Image to their Minds that awa∣kens every drowsy Sentiment in them and hur∣ries them by an amazing and imperceptible Vio∣lence thro' every Passion represented on the living CANVAS  WHAT draws together the numerous Crowds of the small and great VULGAR in LONDON to hear  Dr HERRING  HIS GRACE OF CANTERBURY the BRITISH CICERO harangue in the Pulpit but the Rapture which his Language never fails to inspire and that Softness of Delivery and mo∣dest Action which engages the Attention and charms every Faculty There is indeed so much  Spirit so much Force so much Passion in his Eyes his Features and his Air nay his very Hands have an artless Meaning in them so power∣ful is the Torrent of weighty wellchosen Expres∣sions so entire his Sentiments so just so new with so unaffected so manly a Glow that there is not a

thrown into Confusion and Silence on barely hearing the long Catalogue of his Father's Crimes The Man who excells in Preaching is generally the more sensible of its Difficulty he is under the greatest Concern how to answer the Expectation of his Hearers But the Man who can compass nothing worthy of his Profession worthy of the Name of a Preacher or worthy the Attention of his Hearers is seldom under any Concern he has not the Grace either to blush at or to avoid Indecencies Some in∣deed put on a demure Look and counterfeit an  Air of Bashfulness and Modesty but then it sits upon them with so little Ease and Grace that an Audience presently detects the Cheat and detests it For there is as much Difference between a na∣tural Shame a real Emotion of Soul and a coun∣terfeit one as there is between the LIGHT that glitters in a DIAMOND and that which faintly imitates it in a PEBBLE  THUS far Dear Sir of a Clergyman's LEARN∣ING and Skill in DIVINITY and ELOQUENCE  That he may be a Workman that needeth not be ashamed  To be an excellent Preach∣er I know requires the Study and Practice of a Man's Life a peculiar Genius and a noble Stock of Nature but all of us since we are fre∣quently requir'd to speak in Publick should ar∣rive at such a Degree of Learning and Eloquence as to speak in proper and handsome Terms to ex∣press ourselves with Clearness and with so much Gracefulness at least as our Matter may not suffer by our Language nor our Language by our De∣livery  livery But it will be highly useful besides this to adorn our Discourse with the more SELECT PHRASES and refin'd Forms of Speech which will make it relish better especially to the Au∣ditors of the better Breeding to illustrate it when Occasion requires with easy and decent Meta∣phors not fordily mean nor prodigiously vast to be able to command the Use of natural and elegant SIMILITUDES for ILLUSTRATION and not for VARNISH to know what Words to use to aggravate and what to extenuate with a Regard had always to Truth and Sobriety to de∣lineate a VIRTUE or a VICE a GOOD or a BAD MAN in such proper and natural Colours as may raise the Esteem or Aversion the Love or Hatred of our Auditors to them at Pleasure if we can arrive to this then we shall in a true Sense DOMINARI IN CONCIONIBUSbe LORDS over the Affections of our Hearers which if we take Care to join with orthodox sound Doctrine and good Reasoning we shall then have the same Advantage for VIRTUE which the DEVIL has  against it that is we shall have all the Warmth of of MENS' PASSIONS pleading for it  I am  DEAR SIR  Yours  c  THE POSTSCRIPT  DEAR SIR  I Shall now shew you by way of POSTCRIPT what is requir'd to make a CLERGYMAN an ORTHODOX TEACHER "right∣ly dividing the WORD of TRUTH" Now to do this he must be lawfully called to the MI∣NISTRY He cannot divide the WORD rightly if he have a wrong Title to do it if he do it upon his own Head or upon insufficient Authority Now I think 'tis sufficiently prov'd even to the silencing GAINSAYER that the only ordinary  lawful Call into the Ministry is by EPISCOPAL ORDINATION For we find no Ordination in Scripture but what was made by the APOSTLES and whom they had before ordain'd Bishops as is clear by the Example of PAUL BARNABAS and TITUS and never any Ordination by PRESBYTERS was ever so much as dreamt of till of late Years and that was only to serve a Turn at GENEVA Therefore all that come rightly into the Clergy must come this Way 'Tis not the being of a pert confident Humour or a popular noisy Eloquence that gives a Man a Commission to divide the WORD of TRUTH but this lawful Means which CHRIST has insti∣tuted this is the only DOOR which our BLES∣SED LORD has made to come into the CHURCH and then he has made the Consequence that they who come in otherwise are THIEVES and ROB∣BERS Without a lawful ORDINATION a Man has no more Title to the PRIESTHOOD than he has to the CROWN and the Crime of each Pre∣sumption is equally great only the Laws are more fevere against the one than the other But when  GOD took the Execution into his Hands the Case was otherwise for when KORAH DATHAN and ABIRAM usurp'd the Priesthood they found as dreadful a Punishment as ever any Trai∣tor since  LIVY in his  LIVY  's Hist Vol    L    History tells us that the Fa∣mily of the POTITII who had the Privilege of performing the Priestly Office at the Altar of HERCULES called the ARA MAXIMA ha∣ving by the Advice of APPIUS the Censor in∣structed some publick Servants in the solemn Rites of their Function with a Design to commit the Ex∣ercise of their Office to them as their Delegates an amazing Effect ensued and one says the Hi∣storian that may justly deter from making any Alteration in Religion for tho' there were at that Time twelve Families of the POTITII and thirty Persons above the Age of fourteen Years they all dy'd within the Space of one Year thereafter and the whole Race became extinct Nor is it only  observ'd continues he that the Name of the POTITII perish'd upon this Occasion but also that APPIUS the Censor some Years after by the lasting Resentment of HEAVEN entirely lost the Sight of his Eyes  HE must be no SCHISMATICK If a Man comes into the Church ever so regularly yet if he schismatically makes a Separation from it he is no orthodox Teacher he does not righty divide the Word of Truth because he takes wrong Measures to do it he has  o Commission to be a Teacher out of the Church his Orders do not qualify him to set up Altar against Altar but he acts as hei∣nously as if he preach'd the Gospel without any Orders at all Our BLESSED SAVIOUR in the whole Tenour of his Doctrine preaches up Peace and Unity in his dying Speech to his Disciples he says  Peace I leave with you my Peace I give unto you  The APOSTLE does with all the pathetical Endearments imaginable engage us to UNITY  If there be any CONSOLATION in CHRIST says he if there be any COMFORT  in LOVE  c  fulfill ye my Joy that ye be all likeminded  NOBLE was that ANSWER of a certain PRE∣LATE and worthy of a Christian Bishop to a PRIME MINISTER'S Letter containing a Re∣proof for holding some orthodox Opinions which the Minister did not likeA BISHOP whose  Conscience cannot reproach him who likes the Place of his Residence and has no Ambition to live within the Sunshine of a Court need fear nothing of what your LORDSHIP can write to him As a NOBLEMAN I pay you Respect as a MINISTER of State I have nothing to do with you as a CHRISTIAN I am ac∣countable to GOD alone 'Tis before his TRI∣BUNAL I hope to render myself acceptable where we must both of us appear shortly And it behoves you my LORD to take heed lest you should not find there the same Favour as in the COURTS of MEN  HE must not be an HERETICK one that  holds an erroneous FAITH concerning the funda∣mental Parts of Religion concerning the DIVI∣NITY the INCARNATION SATISFACTION of our LORD concerning the DEITY of the HOLY GHOST and the Necessity of his GRACE such an one is so far from being a right Divider of the Truth that he teaches a false Religion and another Gospel such an one ought not to con∣tinue a Member of CHRIST'S Flock much less a Teacher and Pastor of it  HE must not be an obstinate Defender of any false or erroneous Doctrine of lesser Moment For let the Doctrine be of ever so small Moment 'tis still an Opposition against the Truth 'tis a con∣fronting of GOD's WORD and an innovating in the Doctrine of the CATHOLICK CHURCH Besides 'tis very dangerous to have a Teacher of such erroneous Opinions because 'tis very natural for the People to imbibe them from him and they may be tempted in Time for the Esteem they have for their Pastor to make a formal Schism  FOR a MINISTER to be an ORTHODOX TEACHER he must not teach uncertain Truths The APOSTLE bids us exhort with sound Doc∣trine not to build with HAY and STUBBLE and he himself came with DEMONSTRATION as well as POWER and the other Apostles taught what they had heard and seen which ought to be well consider'd by those Divines who value them∣selves upon their newfangled NOSTRUMS in DIVINITY and finespun Inventions in this Science For Divinity is a Thing which is recom∣mended most by Antiquity Our FAITH was but once delivered to the SAINTS and so leaves no Room for the Wits of later Ages But if Men must be shewing their Parts and giving the World a Cast of their rare Inventions they have a large Scope for it elsewhere but by all Means they ought to spare DIVINITY  HE ought to ground his Doctrine upon SCRIP∣TURE and the EXPLICATION of the CA∣THOLICK CHURCH TO teach Doctrines with∣out the Confirmation of Scripture is to teach the  Doctrines of Men and to explain Scripture other∣wise than the Church of GOD has done in all Ages is always Presumption and frequently Heresy All Doctrines and Explications of Faith espe∣cially were superabundantly sifted by ancient Councils and Writers when they were Matter of Debate for so many Ages and therefore we ought to stick to their Notions and Expressions of these facred Truths who are suppos'd to understand them better than any single modern Divine who has only convers'd with his own Thoughts Now to remedy this we ought to study DIVI∣NITY first out of the HOLY SCRIPTURE and next out of the FATHERS who let some Men say what they will were Men of very good Sense and talk very intelligibly and tho' the SOCI∣NIANS and REMONSTRANTS may have more of Method Closeness and Subtilty they have that which makes Alloy for all this a great deal more of HERESY  AND now my Friend I can perceive 'tis Time to put an End to  this  Epistolary Correspon∣dence  I have taken the Liberty you see to laugh upon some Occasions and if I have either laugh'd wrong or been impertinently serious I can be content to be laugh'd at in my Turn for my Humour does not very much incline me to melan∣cholly Reflections I have very freely and with∣out the least Reserve given you my Sentiments concerning the necessary Qualifications of a Mini∣ster of the Gospel as he is a CHRISTIAN a PASTOR and a CATHOLICK and I pray GOD if you go into HOLY ORDERS you may do your Duty in all these Respects But a Good Life ought to be the Principal of your Aim for a wicked Life is the worst of HERESIES and a Minister may do more Mischief to Religion by one ill Action than Good by a Hundred fine Sermons Nay we undo all we preach by an ill Practice for Men have Reason to think that That Doctrine should not have any Influence upon their Lives which they see has none upon our own To me indeed it seems surprizing that an im∣moral Clergyman can have the Considence to ap∣pear or preach in Publick for all his Declamati∣ons  against Vice are but so many Libels against himself and every Time he gets up into the Pul∣pit he is but doing a PUBLICK PENANCE to the whole Congregation Let me intreat you therefore steadily to adhere to the Practice of Vir∣tue dare to oppose yourself to the licentious Customs of a degenerate Age wherever you go and by a good Example endeavour to stem the Torrent of Vice Don't blush to own your Obli∣gations daily and hourly to that great Being who fills the Universe with the wondrous Exertions of his Wisdom and Power give him your highest Esteem your highest Reverence and supreme Regard Let your Devotion to him spring from Love and Gratitude and never mention his Name without a respectful and humble Awe regard his Favour as the highest Blessing and endeavour to imitate and follow the bright Example which the BLESSED AUTHOR of our Religion has set before us Believe me my DEAR FRIEND there is no Comparison between a wicked and a good Life A good Life stor'd with every moral and religious  Virtue resembles HEAVEN methinks its CAN∣NOPY stuck with STARS and CONSTELLATI∣ONS A Clergyman who is conscious of having done his Duty enjoys a most refin'd and rational Delight but he who wants the Secret Witness of an approving Conscience is never seen to have that serene Composure and Selfcomplacency which becomes a Minister of CHRIST  In a Word let your Countenance be open and your Bosom close let your Beneficence be attended with a Familiarity so circumscrib'd as to impress Love and Respect and let all your Acti∣ons appear consistent with the Dignity of your Profession that you may be upon Earth a true Image of the Deity by giving all Mankind cer∣tain and impartial Marks of your Probity and pa∣ternal Love for the People under your Care whose Hearts if you gain you possess the most precious of all Treasures A Treasure which that brave ROMAN  Flaminium Martiale  A POSTHUMIUS ALVINUS  habeba  eoque Provinciam sortiri cupientem  L CAECILIUS METELLUS  Pontifex Maximus dicta mulcta prohibuit negans fas esse Fla∣mini a Sacris recedere cujus Facti posterioribus quoque Tempori∣bus probata Ratio est  When A POSTHUMIUS ALVINUS the High Priest of MARS presented himself to draw Lots for the Provinces L CAECILI∣US METELLUS the Pontifex Maximus declared it unlawful for him to be absent from his sacred Function and expressly forbad him to leave it under the Pain of sining him This be∣came a Precedent among the ROMANS which was observ'd ever after  Frenshem Suppl Liv Hist L    c    L CAECILIUS METELLUS look∣ed  upon as sacred and obliged even the High Priest of MARS A POSTHUMIUS ALVINUS to Residence and would by no Means dispense with his Absence from the Charge committed to him  As a frequent Consideration of the Nature of our HIGH OFFICE will be a continual Encou∣ragement for us to do our Duty I shall conclude all with an excellent Observation of St CHRY∣SOSTOM to this Purpose  THEREFORE has the LORD chosen us to be the LIGHTS of the World and the LEAVEN of the  LUMP to be MASTERS and TEACHERS of other Christians to be as it were AN∣GELS associating with Men on Earth as MEN conversing with Children as those of a spiritual Nature with the gross animal and carnal so that by our Conversation they might reap an extraordinary Advantage  I am  DEAR SIR  Yours  c

Time it may testify Respect Our cheering Ad∣dresses to mourning Friends says a GREEK POET are wont to be as welcome as Calms to a tossed Mariner Even the Son of GOD himself when his Trial and Agony fell upon him was glad of a strengthening Angel  TEARS are as just a Debt to the Death of our Friends as their Death is to Nature JUPI∣TER  in HOMER bemoans the Death of his SARPEDON and APOLLO mourns

the World and hu∣man Chances should steel you enough against the like Strokes How many FuneralMatches had your Eyes seen ere Death knock'd at your Friend's Door But he might you will say have liv'd longer True so he might have dy'd sooner What Reason have we to think that too hastily taken away which was payable as soon as we receiv'd it If his Mortality displeas'd you you should have mourn'd when it began not when it ends Why do we grieve for a Wound which no Grief can relieve or remedy Why bear we not that in another which we must come to ourselves 'Tis for none but our MAKER to be eternal Lie we not all under an unchangeable  Law under an eternal Ordinance to be  born  and  die  THE SNOW and ICE of WINTER may lie crowded together a While and hold out for a Month or two but the SPRING will be sure to melt it all Should we chance to pass over our Youth and Virility safe yet OLD AGE will con∣sume us at last  WE come into this World as CHILDREN are sent to SCHOOL not to live there alway but to learn somewhat and then be gone We scramble up from lower to higher Forms from our Childhood to an Age of Constancy and Gra∣vity but we must be gone when we have learn'd enough to fit and prepare us for Heaven and the sooner we grow fit the sooner we are taken away Virtue protects not the Body but glorifies the Soul As Flowers of the fairest Hue and Glasses of the finest Mould wither and break soon∣est So we commonly see them that excell in Virtue to be shortest liv'd when the ungodly and dissolute  are in no Peril of Death but are fat and frolick∣some lusty and strong When the MOWER or REAPER cometh Weeds and Flowers Corn and Cockle high and low Spires ripe and unripe Ears are cut down alike So deals the SICKLE of DEATH with us of what Age of what Rank soever it makes bold to pare us away The GREAT LORDS of the Earth after all their painted Glory and stern ruffling are brought down to the Ghastliness and Dust of Death Nay mighty States and Kingdoms expire those awful Monarchies that spread so far are shrunk to nothing Heaven and Earth look for a Day of Dissolution  WHEN all are rated for POLLMONEY what Pride what Partiality nay what Folly were it to grumble and seek Exemption Death is a Tri∣bute which all pay why then should we grieve and whine when we are called upon for it Why should we think to slip the COLLAR alone The only Salve for a Necessity is a willing Compliance with it What should we do but give up a  Game of our own Accord which is so sure to be lost  AND as it avails not to quarrel with a Law of Necessity so it becomes us not to to quarrel with the Will of GOD  We must says a RABBIN be as bold as LEOPARDS as swift as EAGLES as nimble as HARTS and as valiant as LYONS to do the Will of our Father which is in Hea∣ven  And is it not HE that kills and maketh alive that brings us down to the Grave and that raises us up Shall Sun and Moon and Stars and Elements submit to that high CREATOR and shall Man alone who owes him most Service spurn at his Decrees As that CENTURION in Sacred Writ could say of his Domesticks  If he call'd a Servant he came presently if he sent him forth he went  so should we behave our∣selves to our heavenly Master If he keeps us here below in our Pilgrimage we must be con∣tent to trudge still if he calls us away to himself we must be ready to go What fearful Judgments were pronounced on ELI and all his House yet  he puts them up with this mild Acknowledgment  It is the LORD let him do what seemeth him good what should a Servant do but fulfill his Lord's Pleasure  Nay 'tis not only a Lord but a FATHER that determineth of us Even Children are many Times handled more severely of their loving Parents than they would be 'tis for their Good tho' they discern it not The Course which our heavenly Father takes with us is no less beneficial however it may  gripe  and startle our sensual Part Had a STONE or a STAFF hit us we would look angrily about and prepare to revenge ourselves on the Assaulter but should we find the Blow given us by a Friend or by a great Man we depended upon and that it was rather given in Love and Familiarity than Spleen or Grudge we would be calm immediately and excuse our Choler and count it a Courtesy not a Wrong So when temporal Crosses annoy us the Death of our dear Associates the Loss of our Goods the Blemishes of our good Name in all this would we call to Mind that 'tis but a Friend's Blow but the fatherly Stroke of a merciful GOD  how soon would it restrain us from repining how soon bring us into the PSALMIST'S Tune  O GOD thy Rod and thy Staff are so far from bruising and vexing mine Heart that they bring me Comfort 'tis a Sign of thy Favour and Familiarity that I am thus touch'd  THE Savage INDIANS that were demanded by our late Discoverers what they mean't in wor∣shipping the SUN had this Reason at Hand "Because it brought DEATH upon them" They thought it a Device and Ordinance that could suit with none but the Power and Goodness of a Deity  YOU Sir are depriv'd of one that was deser∣vedly dear to you but let GOD be dearer whose high Pleasure it was to take him from this World to himself What hath HE taken but what HE once gave you Why should HE not receive for ever what HE lent you but for a Time Ah how fond are we of our own Vexation Like  ulcerous  Limbs how do we shrink at every Touch Many Comforts cannot erect us so much as one  Grief is able to cast us down We are greedy of that which we want and as unthankful for that which we have Something is gone we once had and we afflict ourselves for it when there were more Reason it should quiet than heighten our Grief that we once had it For that we had it was a Benefit for which we are owing to GOD and it would best become us to think of paying our Debt to our bountiful LORD Lo he asketh nothing but our PATIENCE but our PEACE Peace with our∣selves and Peace with HIM There is more left us than we have lost and why will we lose what∣soever we have because we have not a Thing that we have lost For that which we have left is wil∣fully lost while we take no Joy in it What In∣jury do we to our own Happiness if we place it in Things which we want Never shall we want Matter of Dejection if we go to Work thus Every MISER'S Coffer and every MERCHANT'S Ship every full Table and every wellfurnish'd House we come short of will bring us in a plen∣tiful Harvest of Perplexity But I beseech you SIR to turn your Eyes rather on that which GOD  hath done for you to bethink yourself how many Comforts are left you to season this particular Loss How can you think him dead who in the bright Echo of his Reputation is still remaining with you LAELIUS could cheer himself that his SCIPIO was to him alive stillalive in his glo∣rious Virtues alive in his renowned Name 'Twas not the INNOCENT'S Death DAVID bemoan'd but the REBEL'S When SOCRATES saw his WIFE storming that such a  good  Man should die unjustly what says he Would'st thou rather have me die a Malefactor  IF SIR you find your Heart bleed with such a Meditation"Ah what a Friend hath GOD "taken from me" Let a sweeter one heal it again "What a Friend had I given me" Whenever you look upon the Greatness of your Loss it must bring to your Mind the Greatness of your Debt and GOD'S great Kindness in bestow∣ing such a Friend upon you How unthankful is he who so remembereth the Loss of a Benefit that he forgets the Receit Shall we receive Good at  GOD'S Hand and not Evil too Were it not far better we should submit ourselves to the Will of GOD than the Will of GOD should be squar'd to ours Do we fondly presume that we know what is better for us or wish ourselves better than GOD doth How oft have we delighted in hurtful and perilous Things How oft have our vain Long∣ings brought Mischief upon us On the other Side what gracious Tokens of his Goodwill hath GOD shewn us When HE took our Flesh and liv'd among us and died for us was not his Goodwill towards Men proclaim'd aloud And is not his Will the same in laying the Cross on us as in bearing it for us Had HE not the same tender Love and gracious Aim in both of doing us good If we reckon it for our Good that GOD would suffer so much for us we may believe it for our Good too that HE would have ourselves suffer a little All HIS Attributes are vast and infinite HIS Power Wisdom and Love nor is He thus alone in HIMSELF but this to us HE loves us better than we love ourselves infinitely better And HE seeks our Good more and is more able  and skilful to effect itinfinitely more What therefore comes in our Heads when we bemoan our Mishaps Do we think GOD deceiv'd or spiteful Do we think HIS Arm shorten'd that HE cannot prevent an Evil Far be such Thoughts from a Christian's Heart It comes not from any Weakness Malice or Imprudence in HIM that we are vex'd thus but from HIS infinite Power Wisdom and Goodness and who are we that like the old GIANTS we should fight with Heaven and attempt to pull GOD from his Throne and wring his Sceptre out of his Hand Oh let us give HIM Leave who made us for his Glory to rule us at his Will To that Glory HE will assuredly bring us if we be guided by his Will and Counsel in the Way to it A Passenger at SEA takes not upon him to steer and order the SHIP that wafts him but leaves that to the Pilot and Master and in a Storm obeys his Direction most and stirs not a Foot against his Will but casts out the dearest Things that he has at his Bid∣ding What think you my Friend hath GOD less Skill to govern the WORLD than the SHIP∣MAN  his Bark That which we would do for a Man who is to land us on Earth shall we not do for a GOD who would bring us to Heaven Our Crosses are sent us either by an angry GOD or a favouring one if they are sent in Favour why do we spurn at a Benefit If in Displeasure what should we do but appease it with an humble Sub∣mission GOD'S Anger will be the sooner ap∣peas'd if we can meet his chast'ning Hand not only with Silence and Sufferance but even with Consent and Joy and Thanksgiving The old GERMANS well understood this who taught their Children when their Fingers were cut or scorch'd to cry "GOD be thanked" What heard we from our distressed LORD in the Garden of GETH∣SEMANI "Not my Will O Father but thine "be done" And should not this affect us as much as the rueful Spectacle did that HEBREW Host which were besieging the MOABITES They no sooner saw the King's Son offer'd up for a Sa∣crifice but they departed amaz'd and vex'd When the Son of GOD himself becometh a Burnt∣offering and sacrificeth his Will to the Will of  his Father shall it not work as fierce an Indigna∣tion within us against our own Stubbornness We solace ourselves in all our Extremities to see other Men suffering with us and should we not think it a more abundant Comfort to see our blessed LORD a Sharer with us in Sorrow and Sufferance Shall we leave HIM to climb up to his CROSS alone and shall we suffer nothing at all with him but run away from the very Shadow of a threaten∣ing Affliction of a seeming Distress  WHY SIR should we grieve immoderately to see our Friends going from hence who have the ANGELS to convey their Souls and to gather up their Bodies at the last Day nay CHRIST himself bearing them Company in all their Way Why went he down to the Grave with us but to save us from the Danger and Horror of it If 'tis an unpleasant Thing to follow the SON of GOD yet in any case let us not fly from him If we dare not imitate how dare we resist him When we might be like him why do we thus abhor his Resemblance Oh wretched Ingratitude GOD  stampeth upon us the Image of his beloved Son and we that will not be like CHRIST in Sufference become like LUCIFER in Pride nay methinks we become worse for LUCIFER thought not himself better than his GOD And we as if we were faultless refuse the Stripes which our innocent JESUS bore  HOWEVER we find ourselves stated indeed it becomes us to bear our Crosses contentedly For if we see a deep Stain of Guilt within us wer't not an high Insolence to be loth to suffer justly when CHRIST had those bitter Storms of Sorrow upon him who never did amiss On the other Side if we find no Indictments in our own Hearts nothing to implead or accuse us we are the more encouraged to be like him who was crucify'd without a Cause If our own Guilt brought not our Affliction upon us let not Impatience bring any Guilt on our Affliction  SHOULD we have met our SAVIOUR as that CIRENIAN did fainting under his CROSS and  desiring us to carry it a while for him nay should he have laid that precious Burthen upon our Shoulders with his own Hands would we churlishly have put it from us would we have pleaded Excuse or Impatience would we not have carried it away in Joy and Triumph and have thought ourselves happy to have been cru∣cify'd on the same Tree with the SON of GOD Lo this very Honour we may come to without going to Mount CALVARY for it GOD puts our Strength to a Trial with his own Hand im∣poseth this or that particular Cross on us a Cross far lighter than that our LORD bore why do we refuse and abhor it  THE SON of GOD was wounded and pierced for me by the bloody Hands of ungodly Ruffians why should not I suffer a gracious GOD to touch me why should I not be struck by so good and gentle a Hand  WHEN the Disciples were tossed at SEA and felt a new Tempest within themselves to see a  Man walking on the liquid Waves on Word from their MASTER'S Mouth quells them all "Be of good Comfort it is I" It is I have called this Storm upon you it is I can appease it it is I have taken away the Serenity of the Hea∣vens it is I can restore it againIf HE makes us  sore  says JOB he can bind us up if he wounds us his Hands can make us whole Let us there∣fore wait on him for a SALVE from whom our SORES come  'TIS true SIR you have lost an excellent Friend But what is the Almighty Hand of your heavenly Father any whit shorten'd Hath HE lock'd up all his Care of you in  this  URN No cast your Care upon him for he careth for you You never saw the Righteous forsaken of Men oft enough but never never of GOD  BUT you are not I hope so fix'd on the Me∣ditation of your own Loss but you remember also that to him to die was Gain Yes it was inexpressible Felicity to be taken away from a  World in which we are immerg'd in Labour and Sorrow For what is the Life we doat on but a Stage of Folly but a Sea of Mifery which how smoothly soever we sail over yet many a Rock many a Gulph will cross our Way many a Storm will toss us and many a Rover fright us ere we unlade our Bottom in the wish'dfor Haven That very Period of Life which we long for which we are so glad to arrive at our OLD AGE what is it else but a loathsome Prison Even now when we are nearest to Death our buried Griefs and Maladies begin to revive as RIVERS run in a broader Stream when they are ending their Course  BUT if we look into the Mysteries of our tender Age we shall find that our young Infants at their Birth begin to weep in their Sleep seem to laugh He that deplored the Entrance of his Life with Tears consecrates the Image of Death with Smiles as if he foresaw the Anxieties of the one and the Sweetness of the other  WISELY therefore did GOD and Nature ap∣point that Souls as yet rude and ignorant should be infus'd into our Bodies and kept senseless in the clos'd Womb for fear of loathing so harsh a Pri∣son which ORPHEUS thought was nothing else but a Punishment laid upon us like that the old Tyrants used when they tied the Dead and Living together for thus says he the pure and immortal Soul is serv'd when she is yoked with a rotten corruptible and crazy Body And what divorced Soul that carries her Intellect with her would glad∣ly return this foul Way again to lie pent in a dark and polluted Womb to be depriv'd so many Months of the Light of Heaven so many Years of the Use of Reason to run through so many sordid Necessities of Nature so many Mockeries of Fortune to take up again the Madness of Infancy the Terrors of Childhood the Dangers of Youth the Cares of Virility and the Griefs of old Age I cannot believe any Man hath liv'd so happy as to wish his whole Life again repeated  NONE I dare say would desire to recover Life  but such as deserv'd it not but such as had abus'd itHad Death methinks no Comforts attend∣ing upon it the very Troubles of Life might be enough to render it sweet as WEARINESS gives a Relish to REST  IT made ARTABANUS laugh to see XERXES so foolishly weeping when from a steep Hill he took a View of his numerous Army he fell into such passionate Moans that such a Multitude e∣nough to turn the World upside down must be gone from it so soon it griev'd him that they whom himself was precipitating into a present Danger of Death and sacrificing streight up to the Madness of his Ambition should be all dead within an hundred Years O XERXES there had been more Reason for thee to have bemoan'd so long a Stay in so cross a World Hadst thou discern'd as clearly from that high Mount their human Anxieties as thou didst their human Bo∣dies the Advantages of Death would rather have dry'd thy Tears than the Suddenness drawn them out  'TWERE as easy methinks to find a moiling Collier with a white and unsully'd Face as a mor∣tal Man not stain'd with some Tincture of Grief Pick out the bravest Darlings of Fortune take one of those that had the very Sirname of HAP∣PY and GREAT take a SYLLA or an ALEX∣ANDER or a JULIUS CAESAR even they that commanded all had their Lives perplex'd and their Deaths violent Look on AUGUSTUS whose publick Reign seem'd a perpetual Calm found he not many deep Vexations at Home the want of natural Issue the Miscarriage of adopted What Joy could he take among the Treacheries of Some the Libels of others to see his nearest Kinswoman lewd and loose his only Successor hateful and unworthy What farther Instance need I seek You see Dear Sir even in this Loss that which was one of your greatest Joys become an Occasion of your just Heaviness  SUPPOSE now a Man deep in Debt for which he was bound to pay yearly a grievous and un∣reasonable Use how glad would he be to get out  of his Creditor's Lurch to see the main Debt clear'd and the Bond cancell'd For the Principal being pay'd the biting Interest ceases And is not this the common Condition of the Sons of Men We have our Bodies from Earth our Souls immedi∣ately from GOD both these are lent us but we pay a hard Interest in the mean Time The bo∣dily Pangs that press us Hunger and Thirst Cold and Heat Sickness and Labour and all the Variety of corporal Distresses what are all these but InterestMoney to be daily paid till the Prin∣cipal be restor'd till the Body return to the Earth from whence it came On the other Side the Fears and Cares and Sorrows and all the trouble∣some Passions of the Soul must be paid too for the Use of it till the Spirit returns to GOD that gave it How do we wrong ourselves if we come not gladly out of such chargeable Debts When SOCRATES had drunk his last Hemlock he bad them prepare a Sacrifice for AESCULAPIUS for the Medicinal GOD he took his Death as a Re∣medy that would cure all his Griefs  INFAMY is one of those Evils that sticks clo∣sest unto us and yet in Death it begins to lose its Sting Who talketh now in a virulent Manner of an Od We speak not of the Dead but with a Kind of Reverence Even they who while they liv'd could get nothing but Grudge and En∣vy once dead are prais'd extoll'd and wish'd for again  IN the Judgment of the WISE MAN  the Day of our Death is better than the Day of our Birth  Better without Question to the virtu∣ous good Man who hath all his Tears and Troubles wiped away and better in some Measure for the vicious too for tho' it ends not his Misery yet it puts an End to his Misdoings And is it not a Kindness to wrest a Poniard from one that would do nothing but stab himself to deny Money to a gaming BORROWER that would do nothing but cast it way 'Tis no less Courtesy to take away Life from him that abuses it We reckon that good which brings us Profit and is not Death beneficial we meet not the King with such aw'd  and compos'd Thoughts as we do a dead CORSE The very Sight of another's Funeral doth us good it causing the Remembrance or Reflection of our own and therefore the CATAJAN PRIESTS call the People to publick Prayers with a Trum∣pet made of the Bones of the Dead and deck their Bodies with Beads and Jewels of the same Stuff and drink commonly out of a Skull  BUT if from our private Condition we turn our Eyes to the publick Face of the Times we are cast upon have we not Cause to count the Dead happy 'Tis one of our greatest Comforts in publick Calamities to see our Friends and dear Associates freed from them and shelter'd in some safe Retreat Were we got into some hideous Desart and environed there with roaring and ve∣nomous Beasts on one Side a fierce Tyger ready to fly upon us on the other Lyons or Bears with bent and erected Paws gaping for us here a Cluster of Serpents spitting their Fire and Venom there a Troop of Savages brandishing their Clubs or preparing their Arrows to lay us dead what  would we give to be gone from such ill Neigh∣bours Why are we not here in a woeful a Plight Within outrageous Passions encompass us about and tear our Hearts with restless Desires abroad Misfortune and Misery and the proud Man's Contumely wound us daily Religion pure and undefiled Religion as practised in the primitive Ages of the Church is it not grown a very Jest and become the Scorn of Idiots Nay do wise Heads shew a better Example Do they accustom themselves to entertain their Friends and Acquaintance with Discourse about another World Do they mingle the Praises of GOD with the Feasts and Joys of Life Do they retire to their Country Dwellings to contemplate the Variety and Riches of Divine Wisdom and Bounty in those natural Scenes of Pleasure which the Country affords and do they now and then invite their Companions to join with them in offering Hallelujahs to GOD on this Account No sacred Themes are not  now  the Business of Conversation nor are common Friendships any way useful or serviceable to the great End of Life Riot and Luxury or  sordid Profit and Interest or else Folly Trifling and Impertinence are the Ties the Bonds of mo∣dern Confederacies the Ligaments of Christian nay of Protestant Societies The Oracles of God or Things serious are such unfashionable Topicks of Discourse such unusual nay I may add unwelcome Subjects of Entertainment every where that the Company deserves now to be praised which is only barren and unprofitable not hurtful and wherein we suffer no greater Loss than that of our Time  I WISH says Dr LUCAS in his excellent Essay upon Happiness that whatever Men talk of a Treasure in  another  World they do not now and then think it wisest to have their Por∣tion in  this  How many are there who making a Profession of living by Faith and looking for the blessed Hope and Appearance of CHRIST do yet live as if all the Business of Life were to get and enjoy as much of  this  World as they can who professing themselves the Disciples of the Son of GOD whose Heart  was lowly his Fortune mean and his Ap∣pearance humble do yet lay out their Time their Labour their Wealth on this one Design to make such a Shew such a Figure in the World as may render them the Gaze the Envy of the Neighbourhood they live in Such a tender Concern for such an eager Pur∣suit after temporal Things cannot flow from nay nor consist with Purity of Heart and Po∣verty of Spirit the Love of GOD and a De∣sire of Heaven  WHAT an excellent Thing must we think that to be which frees us from such a degenerate World which even rectifies the crooked Partialities of For∣tune and makes us as good as those that trode upon us We are not therefore to reckon it as an Injury of Fortune but as a Degree of Grace and Favour unto us that our Course is finish'd a little sooner than we were aware of For 'tis as if a TRAVELLER in a rainy wintry Day should get safe and well to his Journey's End or his Inn ere  Sunset which others cannot attain till the dark Night hath overtaken them  IN a cold severe WINTER we think long till it be pass'd over till the warm SPRING and SUM∣MER arrive and why should not we be as glad to have the Hardships of this Life exchang'd for the Joys of a better  WERE a Man necessarily to cross a deep and dangerous RIVER what Madness were it in him to grieve or complain that he had met with a BRIDGE or a BOAT to waft him over They are methinks as foolish who quarrel with Death for what is it else but a Bridge or Boat to waft us to the opposite Shore o'er a Flood we must needs pass from a brittle and frail Life to a glo∣rious and immortal one  WE are not to judge of Death by that which it carries us from but by that which it brings us to To get a Kingdom or poorer Territory we venture our Lives and what is a Spot of Earth to the  Kingdom of Heaven What can we reckon Death but our gainfullest Hour that adds so much to our Felicity as it takes from our Life The sooner we die the longer we are happy  SEE you not how the poor KINE that are turn'd out in Winter will be clinging to the STABLE or BARNDOOR where they know there is better Food The World starves and pines us and why run we from Death's Door where Fulness of Joy lies ready for us Why mourn we hopelessly for a mouldering Body which is in so sure a Hope of a Resurrection  WE see that those Men who are any thing skill'd in the Nature and Motion of heavenly Bo∣dies are not amaz'd or troubled at the yearly ECLIPSES of the SUN and MOON because they know all these obscur'd Planets will quickly re∣cover their Light and shine out as clearly as ever they did And we why should we shrink or shudder to see the Eyes of our Friends clos'd up in Darkness who know these sullen Eclipses are to last but a While that after a little Interposition  of Dust these hid and obscure Bodies shall shine out as the STARS in Heaven  WHEN that huge PERSIAN Army we read of in Story was setting forward to invade GREECE MILTIADES the ATHENIAN General cal∣ling his thin Troops together presented them with a Cocksight imagining that would put Courage into them and the Device took as he wish'd for they seeing such an invincible Stoutness and eager Combat in a Couple of Birds that they would never yield till both lay dead on the Ground snatch'd up their Weapons and march'd on de∣spising Danger and Death WE CHRISTIANS have not Birds and Beasts but reasonable Men to give us an Example of Fortitude in bearing the Loss of our Friendsour Relativesour other selves We see DAVID wiping his Eyes when his Child was dead we see JOB breathing out the Praises of GOD when a violent Wind had blown all his Sons and Daughters away we see that brave DAME in the Book of MACCABEES hearing the Cries of her murder'd Sons with as much Delight as a musical Song Nay PAGANISM is able to  shew us a TIBERIUS a PAULUS a MARTIUS a CATO a GALLIENUS at ROME a PERICLES a XENOPHON an ANAXAGORAS in other Places so manfully bearing the Death of their domestick Friends and Children that they have gone presently about their Business sat in the SenateHouse and kept their Garlands upon their Heads and told the World they knew they were mortal Men they had begotten And we that know more shall we bear less Will not these Heathens be eternal Monuments of our Shame if we lie groveling in Sorrow and raise not up our dejected Hearts  THE sweet and long Acquaintance you had Dear Sir with him whose Loss you lament the upright and innocent Course of his Life as it gives you the more Hope of his present Happiness so it gives you the less Reason to bewail his Dissolu∣tion His Life was not a mere Calm but a gentle Breeze it did not consist in mere Rest and Quiet but a delightful Motion Even in his Retirement he could employ all the Vigour of his Mind use∣fully  and delightfully nay that very Solitude which would have been the Prison and  anish∣ment of the busy Worldling wa  is  aradise Most undoubtedly if a righteous and unblemish'd Life if a sure Faith in his precious Redeemer if the Fear of GOD and a fruitful Use of his Ordi∣nances could bring him to Heaven he is become an abiding Citizen of that NEW JERUSALEM O if he had but Liberty to whisper a few Words into your Ear would he not thus expostu∣late  My dear Friend What do you bewail My Departure from you Why look where I am in whose soft Bosom I lie how glorious how secure I am become Is it your own Mis∣hap that afflicts you It will be but for a Mo∣ment I am but gone before and you shortly will follow me and all those I left with you  Numbers of our Friends saith St CYPRIAN expect us above let us therefore Dear Sir g  sp and long for an happy Meeting that we may be join'd in Glory with those with whom we are join'd in Affection  I am  c  FINIS
