 THE CITIZEN of the WORLD OR LETTERS FROM A CHINESE PHILOSOPHER Residing in LONDON TO HIS FRIENDS in the EAST  VOLUME the SECOND  LONDON Printed for the AUTHOR AND Sold by J NEWBERY and W BRISTOW in St Paul's Churchyard J LEAKE and W FREDERICK at Bath B COLLINS at Salisbury and A M SMART and Co at Reading MDCCLXII  THE EDITOR's PREFACE  THE schoolmen had formerly a very exact way of computing the abilities of their Saints or authors Escobar for instance was said to have learning as five genius as four and gravity as seven Caramuel was greater than he His learning was as eight his genius as six and his gravity as thirteen Were I to estimate the merits of our Chinese Philosopher by the same scale I would not hesitate to state his genius still higher but as to his learning and gravity these I think might safely be marked as nine hundred and ninety nine within one degree of absolute frigidity  Yet upon his first appearance here many were angry not to find him as ignorant as a Tripoline ambassador or an Envoy from Mujac They were surprized to find a man born so far from London that school of prudence and wisdom endued even with a moderate capacity They expressed the same surprize at his knowlege that the Chinese do at ours  Le Comte Vol p  How comes it  said they  that the  Europeans so remote from China think with so much justice and precision They have never read our books they scarcely know even our letters and yet they talk and reason just as we do  The truth is the Chinese and we are pretty much alike Different degrees of refinement and not of distance mark the distinctions among mankind Savages of the most opposite climates have all but one character of improvidence and rapacity and tutored nations however separate make use of the very same methods to procure refined enjoyment  The distinctions of polite nations are few but such as are peculiar to the Chinese appear in every page of the following correspondence The metaphors and allusions are all drawn from the East Their formality our author carefully preserves Many of their favourite tenets in morals are illustrated The Chinese are always concise so is he Simple so is he The Chinese are grave and sententious so is he But in one particular the resemblance is peculiarly striking the Chinese are often dull and so is he Nor has my assistance been wanting We are told in an old romance of a certain knight errant and his horse who contracted an intimate friendship The horse most usually bore the knight but in cases of extraordinary dispatch the knight returned the favour and carried his horse Thus in the intimacy between my author and me he has usually given  me a lift of his Eastern sublimity and I have sometimes given him a return of my colloquial ease  Yet it appears strange in this season of panegyric when scarce an author passes unpraised either by his friends or himself that such merit as our Philosopher's should be forgotten While the epithets of ingenious copious elaborate and refined are lavished among the mob like medals at a coronation the lucky prizes fall on every side but not one on him I could on this occasion make myself melancholly by considering the capriciousness of public taste or the mutability of fortune but during this fit of morality lest my reader should sleep I'll take a nap myself and when I awake tell him my dream  I imagined the Thames was frozen over and I stood by its side Several booths were erected upon the ice and I was told by one of the spectators that FASHION FAIR was going to begin He added that every author who would carry his works there might probably find a very good reception I was resolved however to observe the humours of the place in safety from the shore sensible that ice was at best precarious and having been always a little cowardly in my sleep  Several of my acquaintance seemed much more hardy thin I and went over the ice with intrepidity  Some carried their works to the fair on fledges some on carts and those which were more voluminous were conveyed in waggons Their temerity astonished me I knew their cargoes were heavy and expected every moment they would have gone to the bottom They all entered the fair however in safety and each soon after returned to my great surprize highly satisfied with his entertainment and the bargains he had brought away  The success of such numbers at last began to operate upon me If these cried I meet with favour and safety some luck may perhaps for once attend the unfortunate I am resolved to make a new adventure The furniture frippery and fireworks of China have long been fashionably bought up I'll try the fair with a small cargoe of Chinese morality If the Chinese have contributed to vitiate our tastle I'll try how far they can help to improve our understanding But as others have driven into the market in waggons I'll cautiously begin by venturing with a wheelbarrow Thus resolved I baled up my goods and fairly ventured when upon just entering the fair I fancied the ice that had supported an hundred waggons before cracked under me and wheelbarrow and all went to the bottom  Upon awaking from my reverie with the fright I cannot help wishing that the pains taken in giving  this correspondence an English dress had been employed in contriving new political systems or new plots for farces I might then have taken my station in the world either as a poet or a philosopher and made one in those little societies where men club to raise each others reputation But at present I belong to no particular class I resemble one of those solitary animals that has been forced from its forest to gratify human curiosity My earliest with was to escape unheeded through life but I have been set up for halfpence to fret and scamper at the end of my chain Tho' none are injured by my rage I am naturally too savage to court any friends by fawning Too obstinate to be taught new tricks and too improvident to mind what may happen I am appeased though not contented Too indolent for intrigue and too timid to push for favour I amBut what signifies what am I      LETTERS FROM A CITIZEN of the WORLD TO HIS FRIENDS in the EAST  LETTER LXIII  From Lien Chi  l  tangi to Hingpo by the way of Moscow  GENEROSITY properly applied will supply every other external advantage in life but the love of those we converse with it will procure esteem and a conduct resembling real affection but actual love is the spontaneous production of the mind no generosity can purchase no rewards encrease nor no liberality continue it the very person who is obliged has it not in his power to force his lingring affections upon the object he should love and voluntarily mix passion with gratitude  Imparted fortune and wellplaced liberality may procure the benefactor goodwill may load the person obliged with the sense of the duty he lies under to retaliate this is gratitude and simple gratitude untinctured with love is all the return an ingenuous mind can bestow for former benefits  But gratitude and love are almost opposite affections love is often an involuntary passion placed upon our companions without our consent and frequently conferred without our previous esteem We love some men we know not why our tenderness is naturally excited in all their concerns we excuse their faults with the same indulgence and approve their virtues with the same applause with which we consider our own While we entertain the passion it pleases us we cherish it with delight and give it up with reluctance and love for love is all the reward we expect or desire  Gratitude on the contrary is never conferred but where there have been previous endeavours to excite it we consider it as a debt and our spirits wear a load till we have discharged the obligation Every acknowledgment of gratitude is a circumstance of humiliation and some are found to submit to frequent mortifications of this kind proclaiming what obligations they owe merely because they think it in some measure cancels the debt  Thus love is the most easy and agreeable and gratitude the most humiliating affection of the mind we never reflect on the man we  love  without exulting in our choice while he who has bound us to him by  benefits  alone rises to our idea as a person  to whom we have in some measure forfeited our freedom Love and gratitude are seldom therefore found in the same breast without impairing each other we may tender the one or the other singly to those we converse with but cannot command both together By attempting to encrease we diminish them the mind becomes bankrupt under too large obligations all additional benefits lessen every hope of future return and bar up every avenue that leads to tenderness  In all our connexions with society therefore it is not only generous but prudent to appear insensible of the value of those favours we bestow and endeavour to make the obligation seem as slight as possible Love must be taken by stratagem and not by open force We should seem ignorant that we oblige and leave the mind at full liberty to give or refuse its affections for constraint may indeed leave the receiver still grateful but it will certainly produce disgust  If to procure gratitude be our only aim there is no great art in making the acquisition a benefit conferred demands a just acknowledgment and we have a right to insist upon our due  But it were much more prudent to forego our right on such an occasion and exchange it if we can for love We receive but little advantage from repeated protestations of gratitude but they cost him very much from whom we exact them in return exacting a grateful acknowledgement is demanding a debt by which the creditor is not advantaged and the debtor pays with reluctance  As  Mencius  the Philosopher was travelling in the pursuit of wisdom night overtook him at the foot of a gloomy mountain remote from the habitations of men Here as he was straying while rain and thunder conspired to make solitude still more hideous he perceived a hermit's cell and approaching asked for shelter Enter cries the hermit in a severe tone men deserve not to be obliged but it would be imitating their ingratitude to treat them as they deserve Come in examples of vice may sometimes strengthen us in the ways of virtue  After a frugal meal which consisted of roots and tea Mencius could not repress his curiosity to know why the hermit had retired from mankind the actions of whom taught the truest lessons of wisdom Mention not the name of man cries the hermit with indignation here let me live retired from a base ungrateful world here among the beasts of the forest I shall find no flatterers the lion is a generous enemy and the dog a faithful friend but man base man can poison the bowl and smile while he presents it  You have been used ill by mankind  interrupted the philosopher shrewdly Yes returned the hermit on mankind I have exhausted my whole fortune and this staff and that cup and those roots are all that I have in return  Did you bestow your fortune or did you only lend it  returned Mencius I bestowed it undoubtedly replied the other for where were the merit of being a money lender  Did they ever own that they received it  still adds the philosopher A thousand times cries the hermit they every day loaded me with professions of gratitude for obligations received and solicitations  for future favours  If then  says Mencius smiling  you did not lend your fortune in order to have it returned it is unjust to accuse th  m of ingratitude they own'd themselves obliged you expected no more and they certainly earn'd each favour by frequently acknowledging the obligation  The hermit was struck with the reply and surveying his guest with emotion I have heard of the great Mencius and you certainly are the man I am now fourscore years old but still a child in wisdom take me back to the school of man and educate me as one of the most ignorant and the youngest of your disciples  Indeed my son it is better to have friends in our passage through life than grateful dependants and as love is a more willing so it is a more lasting tribute than extorted obligation As we are uneasy when greatly obliged gratitude once refused can never after be recovered the mind that is base enough to disallow the just return instead of feeling any uneasiness upon recollection triumphs in its new acquired freedom and in some measure is pleased with conscious baseness  Very different is the situation of disagreeing friends their separation produces mutual uneasiness Like that divided being in fabulous creation their sympathetic souls once more desire their former union the joys of both are imperfect their gayest moments tinctured with uneasiness each seeks for the smallest concessions to clear the way to a wished for explanation the most trifling acknowledgement the slightest accident serves to effect a mutual reconciliation  But instead of pursuing the thought permit me to soften the severity of advice by an European story which will fully illustrate my meaning  A fidler and his wife who had rubbed through life as most couples usually do sometimes good friends at others not quite so well one day happened to have a dispute which was conducted with becoming spirit on both sides The wife was sure she was right and the husband was resolved to have his own way What was to be done in such a case the quarrel grew worse by explanations and at last the fury of both rose to such a pitch that they made a vow never to sleep together in the same bed for the future This was the most rash vow that could be imagined for they still were friends at bottom and besides they had but one bed in the house however resolved they were to go through with it and at night the fiddlecase was laid in bed between them in order to make a separation In this manner they continued for three weeks every night the fiddlecase being placed as a barrier to divide them  By this time however each heartily repented of their vow their resentment was at an end and their love began to return they wished the fiddlecase away but both had too much spirit to begin One night however as they were both lying awake with the detested fiddlecase between them the husband happened to sneeze to which the wife as is usual in such cases bid God bless him  Ay but  returns the husband  woman do you say that from your heart  Indeed  I do my poor Nicholas cries his wife I say it with all my heart  If so then  says the husband  we had as good remove the fiddlecase  LETTER LXIV  From the same  BOOKS my son while they teach us to respect the interests of others often make us unmindful of our own while they instruct the youthful reader to grasp at social happiness he grows miserable in detail and attentive to universal harmony often forgets that he himself has a part to sustain in the concert I dislike therefore the philosopher who describes the inconveniencies of life in such pleasing colours that the pupil grows enamoured of distress longs to try the charms of poverty meets it without dread nor fears its inconveniencies till he severely feels them  A youth who has thus spent his life among books new to the world and unacquainted with man but by philosophic information may be considered as a being whose mind is filled with the vulgar errors of the wise utterly unqualified for a journey through life yet confident of his own skill in the direction he sets out with confidence blunders on with vanity and finds himself at last undone  He first has learned from books and then lays it down as a maxim that all mankind are virtuous or vicious in excess and he has been long  taught to detest vice and love virtue warm therefore in attachments and stedfast in enmity he treats every creature as a friend or foe expects from those he loves unerring integrity and consigns his enemies to the reproach of wanting every virtue On this principle he proceeds and here begin his disappointments upon a closer inspection of human nature he perceives that he should have moderated his friendship and softened his severity for he often finds the excellencies of one part of mankind clouded with vice and the faults of the other brightened with virtue he finds no character so sanctified that has not its failings none so infamous but has somewhat to attract our esteem he beholds impiety in lawn and fidelity in fetters  He now therefore but too late perceives that his regards should have been more cool and his hatred less violent that the truly wise seldom court romantic friendships with the good and avoid if possible the resentment even of the wicked every moment gives him fresh instances that the bonds of friendship are broken if drawn too closely and that those whom he has treated with disrespect more than retaliate the injury at length therefore he is obliged to confess that he has declared war upon the vicious half of mankind without being able to form an alliance among the virtuous to espouse his quarrel  Our booktaught philosopher however is now too far advanced to recede and though poverty be the just consequence of the many enemies his conduct has created yet he is resolved to meet it without shrinking philosophers have described  poverty in most charming colours and even his vanity is touched in thinking that he shall shew the world in himself one more example of patience fortitude and resignation  Come then O Poverty for what is there in thee dreadful to the  WISE  temperance health and frugality walk in thy train cheerfulness and liberty are ever thy companions Shall any be ashamed of thee of whom Cincinatus was not ashamed the running brook the herbs of the field can amply satisfy nature man wants but little nor that little long come then O Poverty while kings stand by and gaze with admiration at the true philosopher's resignation  The goddess appears for Poverty ever comes at the call but alas he finds her by no means the charming figure books and his warm imagination had painted As when an eastern bride whom her friends and relations had long described as a model of perfection pays her first visit the longing bridegroom lifts the veil to see a face he had never seen before but instead of a countenance blazing with beauty like the sun he beholds deformity shooting icicles to his heart such appears Poverty to her new entertainer all the fabric of enthusiasm is at once demolished and a thousand miseries rise upon its ruins while Contempt with pointing finger is foremost in the hideous procession  The poor man now finds that he can get no kings to look at him while he is eating he finds that in proportion as he grows poor the world turns its back upon him and gives him leave to act the philosopher in all the majesty of solitude it might be agreeable enough to play the philosopher  while we are conscious that mankind are spectators but what signifies wearing the mask of sturdy contentment and mounting the stage of restraint when not one creature will assist at the exhibition Thus is he forsaken of men while his fortitude wants the satisfaction even of selfapplause for either he does not feel his present calamities and that is natural  insensibility  or he disguises his feelings and that is  dissimulation  Spleen now begins to take up the man not distinguishing in his resentments he regards all mankind with detestation and commencing manhater seeks solitude to be at liberty to rail  It has been said that he who retires to solitude is either a beast or an angel the censure is too severe and the praise unmerited the discontented being who retires from society is generally some goodnatured man who has begun life without experience and knew not how to gain it in his intercourse with mankind Adieu  LETTER LXV  From Lien Chi Altangi to Fum Hoam first president of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin in China  I Formerly acquainted thee most grave  Fum  with the excellence of the  English  in the art of healing The  Chinese  boast their skill in pulses the  Siamese  their botanical knowledge but the  English  advertising physicians alone of being the great restorers of health the dispensers of youth and  the insurers of longevity I can never enough admire the sagacity of this country for the encouragement given to the professors of this art with what indulgence does she foster up those of her own growth and kindly cherish those that come from abroad Like a skilful gardener she invites them from every foreign climate to herself Here every great exotic strikes root as soon as imported and feels the genial beam of favour while the mighty metropolis like one vast munificent dunghill receives them indiscriminately to her breast and supplies each with more than native nourishment  In other countries the physician pretends to cure disorders in the lump the same doctor who combats the gout in the toe shall pretend to prescribe for a pain in the head and he who at one time cures a consumption shall at another give drugs for a dropsy How absurd and ridiculous this is being a mere jack of all trades Is the animal machine less complicated than a brass pin Not less than ten different hands are required to make a pin and shall the body be set right by one single operator  The  English  are sensible of the force of this reasoning they have therefore one doctor for the eyes another for the toes they have their sciatica doctors and inoculating doctors they have one doctor who is modestly content with securing them from bugbites and five hundred who prescribe for the bite of mad dogs  The learned are not here retired with vicious modesty from public view for every dead wall is covered with their names their abilities their amazing  cures and places of abode Few patients can escape falling into their hands unless blasted by lightening or struck dead with some sudden disorder it may sometimes happen that a stranger who does not understand  English  or a countryman who cannot read dies without ever hearing of the vivifying drops or restorative electuary but for my part before I was a week in town I had learned to bid the whole catalogue of disorders defiance and was perfectly acquainted with the names and the medicines of every great man or great woman of them all  But as nothing pleases curiosity more than anecdotes of the great however minute or trifling I must present you inadequate as my abilities are to the subject with some account of those personages who lead in this honourable profession  The first upon the list of glory is doctor  Richard Rock  F U N This great man is short of stature is fat and waddles as he walks He always wears a white threetailed wig nicely combed and frizzed upon each cheek Sometimes he carries a cane but a hat never it is indeed very remarkable that this extraordinary personage should never wear an hat but so it is he never wears an hat He is usually drawn at the top of his own bills sitting in his armchair holding a little bottle between his finger and thumb and surrounded with rotten teeth nippers pills pacquets and gallypots No man can promise fairer nor better than he for as he observes  Be your disorder never so far gone be under no uneasiness make yourself quite easy I can cure you  The next in fame though by some reckoned of equal pretensions is doctor  Timothy Franks  F O G H living in a place called the  Old Bailey  As  Rock  is remarkably squab his great rival  Franks  is as remarkably tall He was born in the year of the christian aera and is while I now write exactly sixtyeight years three months and four days old Age however has no ways impaired his usual health and vivacity I am told he generally walks with his breast open This gentleman who is of a mixed reputation is particularly remarkable for a becoming assurance which carries him gently through life for except doctor  Rock  none are more blest with the advantages of face than doctor  Franks  And yet the great have their foibles as well as the little I am almost ashamed to mention it Let the foibles of the great rest in peace Yet I must impart the whole to my friend These two great men are actually now at variance yes my dear  Fum Hoam  by the head of our grandfather they are now at variance like mere men mere common mortals The champion  Rock  advises the world to beware of bog trotting quacks while  Franks  retorts the wit and the sarcasm for they have both a world of wit by fixing on his rival the odious appellation of  Dumplin Dick  He calls the serious doctor  Rock Dumplin Dick  Head of  Confucius  what profanation  Dumplin Dick  What a pity ye powers that the learned who were born mutually to assist in enlightening the world should thus differ among themselves and make even the profession ridiculous Sure the world is wide enough at least for two great personages to figure in men of science should leave controversy to the little world  below them and then we might see  Rock  and  Franks  walking together hand in hand smiling onward to immortality  Next to these is doctor  Walker  preparator of his own medicines This gentleman is remarkable for an aversion to quacks frequently cautioning the public to be careful into what hands they commit their safety by which he would insinuate that if they do not employ him alone they must be undone His public spirit is equal to his success Not for himself but his country is the gallypot prepared and the drops sealed up with proper directions for any part of the town or country All this is for his country's good so that he is now grown old in the practice of physic and virtue and to use his own elegance of expression  There is not such another medicine as his in the world again  This my friend is a formidable triumvirate and yet formidable as they are I am resolved to defend the honour of  Chinese  physic against them all I have made a vow to summon doctor  Rock  to a solemn disputation in all the mysteries of the profession before the face of every  Philomath  student in astrology and member of the learned societies I adhere to and venerate the doctrines of old  Wangshuho  In the very teeth of opposition I will maintain  See Du Halde vol II fol p  That the heart is the son of the liver which has the kidneys for its mother and the stomach for its wife  I have therefore drawn up a disputation challenge which is to be sent speedily to this effect  I  Lien Chi Altangi  D N R P  native of  Honan  in  China  to  Richard Rock  F U N native of  Garbagealley  in  Wapping  defiance Though Sir I  m perfectly sensible of your importance though no  ranger to your studies in the paths of nature yet  ere may be many things in the art of physic with  hich you are yet unacquainted I know full well  doctor thou art great  Rock  and so am I Wherefore I challenge and do hereby invite you  a trial of learning upon hard problems and  otty physical points In this debate we will  almly investigate the whole theory and practice of  edicine botany and chymistry and I invite all  he philomaths with many of the lecturers in me  icine to be present at the dispute which I hope  ill be carried on with due decorum with proper  ravity and as befits men of erudition and sci  nce among each other But before we meet face  face I would thus publickly and in the face of  e whole world desire you to answer me one  uestion I ask it with the same earnestness with  hich you have often solicited the public answer  e I say at once without having recourse to our physical dictionary which of those three disor  ers incident to the human body is the most fa  l the  syncope parenthesis  or  apoplexy  I beg your  ply may be as public as this my demand  The day after this was published the editor received an answer  which the doctor seems to be of opinion that the apoplexy is  ost fatal  I am  hereafter may be your admirer or your rival  Adieu  LETTER LXVI  To the same  NDULGENT nature seems to have exempted this island from many of those epidemic  tils which are so fatal in other parts of the  world A want of rain but for a few days beyond the expected season in China spreads famine desolation and terror over the whole country the winds that blow from the brown bosom of the western desart are impregnated with death in every gale but in this fortunate land of Britain the inhabitant courts health in every breeze and the husbandman ever sows in joyful expectation  But tho' the nation be exempt from real evils think not my friend that it is more happy on this account than others They are afflicted it is true with neither famine nor pestilence but then there is a disorder peculiar to the country which every season makes strange ravages among them it spreads with pestilential rapidity and infects almost every rank of people what is still more strange the natives have no name for this peculiar malady tho' well known to foreign physicians by the appellation of  Epidemic terror  A season is never known to pass in which the people are not visited by this cruel calamity in one shape or another seemingly different tho' ever the same one year it issues from a baker's shop in the shape of a sixpenny loaf the next it takes the appearance of a comet with a fiery tail a third it threatens like a flatbottomed boat and a fourth it carries consternation at the bite of a mad dog The people when once infected lose their relish for happiness saunter about with looks of despondence ask after the calamities of the day and receive no comfort but in heightening each others distress It is insignificant how remote or near how weak or powerful the object of terror may be when once they resolve to fright  nd be frighted the meerest trifles sow consternation and dismay each proportions his fears not  o the object but to the dread he discovers in  he countenance of others for when once the  ermentation is begun it goes on of itself tho'  he original cause be discontinued which first  et it in motion  A dread of mad dogs is the  epidemic terror  which now prevails and the whole nation is at present actually groaning under the malignity of  ts influence The people sally from their houses with that circumspection which is prudent in  uch as expect a mad dog at every turning The  hysician publishes his prescription the beadle  repares his halter and a few of unusual bravery  rm themselves with boots and buff gloves in  rder to face the enemy if he should offer to at  ack them In short the whole people stand  ravely upon their defence and seem by their  resent spirit to shew a resolution of not being  amely bit by mad dogs any longer  Their manner of knowing whether a dog be  ad or no somewhat resembles the ancient Eu  opean custom of trying witches The old wo  an suspected was tied hand and foot and thrown  to the water If she swam then she was instantly  arried off to be burnt for a witch if she sunk  en indeed she was acquitted of the charge but  rown'd in the experiment In the same manner  crowd gather round a dog suspected of mad  ess and they begin by teizing the devoted animal  n every side if he attempts to stand upon the  efensive and bite then is he unanimously found  uilty for  a mad dog always snaps at every thing    if on the contrary he strives to escape by running away then he can expect no compassion  for mad dogs always run straight forward before them  It is pleasant enough for a neutral being like me who have no share in those ideal calamities to mark the stages of this national disease The terror at first feebly enters with a disregarded story of a little dog that had gone through a neighbouring village that was thought to be mad by several that had seen him The next account comes that a mastiff ran through a certain town and had bit five geese which immediately run mad foamed at the bill and died in great agonies soon after Then comes an affecting history of a little boy bit in the leg and gone down to be dipt in the salt water when the people have sufficiently shuddered at that they are next congealed with a frightful account of a man who was said lately to have died from a bite he had received some years before This relation only prepares the way for another still more hideous as how the master of a family with seven small children were all bit by a mad lap dog and how the poor father first perceived the infection by calling for a draught of water where he saw the lap dog swimming in the cup  When epidemic terror is thus once excited every morning comes loaded with some new disaster as in stories of ghosts each loves to hear the account though it only serves to make him uneasy so here each listens with eagerness and adds to the tidings with new circumstances of peculiar horror A lady for instance in the country of very weak nerves has been frighted by the barking of a dog and this alas too fre  ently  happens The story soon is improved  d spreads that a mad dog had frighted a lady  distinction These circumstances begin to grow  rrible before they have reached the neighbour  g village and there the report is that a lady  quality was  bit  by a mad mastiff This ac  unt every moment gathers new strength and  ows more dismal as it approaches the capital  d by the time it has arrived in town the lady is  scribed with wild eyes foaming mouth run  ng mad upon all four barking like a dog bi  g her servants and at last smothered between  o beds by the advice of her doctors while the  d mastiff is in the mean time ranging the whole  untry over slavering at the mouth and seek  g whom he may devour  My landlady a good natured woman but a  tle credulous waked me some mornings ago  fore the usual hour with horror and astonish  ent in her looks she desired me if I had any  gard for my safety to keep within for a few  ys ago so dismal an accident had happened as  put all the world upon their guard A mad  g down in the country she assured me had  a farmer who soon becoming mad ran into  own yard and bit a fine brindled cow the  w quickly became as mad as the man began  foam at the mouth and raising herself up  lked about on her hind legs sometimes barking  e a dog and sometimes attempting to talk  e the farmer Upon examining the grounds  this story I found my landlady had it from  e neighbour who had it from another neigh  ur who heard it from very good authority  Were most stories of this nature thoroughly ex+amined it would be found that numbers of suc  as have been said to suffer were no way injured and that of those who have been actually bitten not one in a hundred was bit by a mad dog▪ Such accounts in general therefore only serve t  make the people miserable by false terrors and sometimes fright the patient into actual phrenzy by creating those very symptoms they pretended to deplore  But even allowing three or four to die in a season of this terrible death and four is probably too large a concession yet still it is not considered how many are preserved in their health and in their property by this devoted animal's services▪ The midnight robber is kept at a distance▪ the insidious thief is often detected the health+ful chace repairs many a worn constitution and the poor man finds in his dog a willing assistant eager to lessen his toil and content with the smallest retribution  A dog says one of the English poets "is an honest creature and I am a friend to dogs" O  all the beasts that graze the lawn or hunt the forest a dog is the only animal that leaving his fellows attempts to cultivate the friendship o  man to man he looks in all his necessities with a speaking eye for assistance exerts for him al  the little service in his power with chearfulness and pleasure for him bears famine and fatigue with patience and resignation no injuries can abate his fidelity no distress induce him to forsake his benefactor studious to please and fearing to offend he is still an humble stedfas  pendant and in him alone fawning is not flat  y How unkind then to torture this faithful  eature who has left the forest to claim the pro  ction of man how ungrateful a return to the  usty animal for all its services  Adieu  LETTER LXVII  From Lien Chi Altangi to Hingpo by the way of Moscow  THE Europeans are themselves blind who describe fortune without sight No first rate beau  ever had finer eyes or saw more clearly they  o have no other trade but seeking their fortune  ed never hope to find her coquet like she flies  om her close pursuers and at last fixes on the  odding mechanic who stays at home and minds  business  I am amazed how men can call her blind  en by the company she keeps she seems so very  cerning Wherever you see a gamingtable be  ty sure fortune is not there wherever you see  house with the doors open be very sure for  ne is not there when you see a man whose  cketholes are laced with gold be satisfied fortune  not there wherever you see a beautiful woman  od natured and obliging be convinced fortune  never there In short she is ever seen accom  nying industry and as often trundling a wheel  row as lolling in a coach and six  If you would make fortune your friend or to personize her no longer if you desire my son to be rich and have money be more eager to saw than to acquire when people say  Money is to b  got here and money is to be got there  take no notice mind your own business stay where you are and secure all you can get without stirring▪ When you hear that your neighbour has picked up a purse of gold in the street never run out into the same street looking about you in order to pick up such another or when you are informed that he has made a fortune in one branch of business never change your own in order to be his rival Do not desire to be rich all at once but patiently add farthing to farthing Perhaps you de+spise the petty sum and yet they who want a farthing and have no friend that will lend them it think farthings very good things  Whang  th  foolish miller when he wanted a farthing in hi  distress found that no friend would lend becaus  they knew he wanted Did you ever read th  story of  Whang  in our books of Chinese learning he who despising small sums and grasping at all lost even what he had  Whang  the miller was naturally avaricious nobody loved money better than he or more re+spected those that had it When people would ta  of a rich man in company  Whang  would say  know him very well he and I have been long ac+quainted he and I are intimate he stood for  child of mine but if ever a poor man was mentioned he had not the least knowledge of th

and indulged him with  e wished for vision He dreamed that under  a certain part of the foundation of his mill there was concealed a monstrous pan of gold and diamonds buried deep in the ground and covered with a large flat stone He rose up thanked the stars that were at last pleased to take pity on his sufferings and concealed his good luck from every person as is usual in money dreams in order to have the vision repeated the two succeeding nights by which he should be certain of its veracity His wishes in this also were answered he still dreamed of the same pan of money in the very same

Chi Altangi to Fum Hoam first president of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin in China  THE People of  London  are as fond of walking as our friends at  Pekin  of riding one of the principal entertainments of the citizens here in summer is to repair about nightfall to a garden not far from town where they walk about shew their best cloaths and best faces and listen to a concert provided for the occasion  I accepted an invitation a few evenings ago from my old friend the man in black to be one of a party that was to sup there and at the appointed hour waited upon him at his lodgings There I found the company assembled and expecting my arrival Our party consisted of my friend in superlative finery his stockings rolled a black velvet waistcoat which was formerly new and his grey wig combed down in imitation of hair A pawnbroker's widow of whom by the bye my friend was a professed admirer dressed out in green damask with three gold rings on every finger Mr  Tibbs  the secondrate beau I have formerly described together with his lady  n flimsy silk dirty gauze instead of linnen and an hat as big as an umbrello  Our first difficulty was in settling how we should set out Mrs  Tibbs  had a natural aversion to the water and the widow being a little in flesh as warmly protested against walking a coach was therefore agreed upon which being too small to carry five Mr  Tibbs  consented to sit in his wife's lap  In this manner therefore we set forward being entertained by the way with the bodings of Mr  Tibbs  who assured us he did not expect to see a single creature for the evening above the degree of a cheesemonger that this was the last night of the gardens and that consequently we should be pestered with the nobility and gentry from  Thamesstreet  and  Crookedlane  with several other prophetic ejaculations probably inspired by the uneasiness of his situation  The illuminations began before we arrived and I must confess that upon entring the gardens I found every sense overpaid with more than expected pleasure the lights every where glimmering through the scarcely moving trees the fullbodied consort bursting on the stillness of the night the natural consort of the birds in the more retired part of the grove vying with that which was formed by art the company gayly dressed looking satisfaction and the tables spread with various delacacies all conspired to sill my imagination with the visionary happiness of the  Arabian  lawgiver and lifted me into an extasy of admiration Head of  Confucius  cried I to my friend this is fine this unites rural beauty with courtly magnificence if we except the virgins of immortality that hang on every tree and may be  plucked at every desire I don't see how this falls short of  Mahomet  's  Paradise  As for virgins cries my friend it is true they are a fruit that don't much abound in our gardens here but if ladies as plenty as apples in autumn and as complying as any  hoüry  of them all can content you I fancy we have no need to go to heaven for Paradise  I was going to second his remarks when we were called to a consultation by Mr  Tibbs  and the rest of the company to know in what manner we were to lay out the evening to the greatest advantage Mrs  Tibbs  was for keeping the genteel walk of the garden where she observed there was always the very best company the widow on the contrary who came but once a season was for securing a good standing place to see the waterworks which she assured us would begin in less than an hour at farthest a dispute therefore began and as it was managed between two of very opposite characters it threatned to grow more bitter at every reply Mrs  Tibbs  wondered how people could pretend to know the polite world who had received all their rudiments of breeding behind a compter to which the other replied that tho' some people sat behind compters yet they could sit at the head of their own tables too and carve three good dishes of hot meat whenever they thought proper which was more than some people could say for themselves that hardly knew a rabbet and onions from a green goose and gooseberries  It is hard to say where this might have ended had not the husband who probably knew the  impetuosity of his wife's disposition proposed to end the dispute by adjourning to a box and try if there was any thing to be had for supper that was supportable To this we all consented but here a new distress arose Mr and Mrs  Tibbs  would sit in none but a genteel box a box where they might see and be seen one as they expressed it in the very focus of public view but such a box was not easy to be obtained for tho' we were perfectly convinced of our own gentility and the gentility of our appearance yet we found it a difficult matter to persuade the keepers of the boxes to be of our opinion they chose to reserve genteel boxes for what they judged more genteel company  At last however we were fixed tho' somewhat obscurely and supplied with the usual entertainment of the place The widow found the supper excellent but Mrs  Tibbs  thought every thing detestable come come my dear cries the husband by way of consolation to be sure we can't find such dressing here as we have at lord Crump's or lady Crimp's but for Vauxhall dressing it is pretty good it is not their victuals indeed I find fault with but their wine their wine cries he drinking off a glass indeed is most abominable  By this last contradiction the widow was fairly conquered in point of politeness She perceived now that she had no pretensions in the world to taste her very senses were vulgar since she had praised detestable custard and smacked at wretched wine she was therefore content to yield the victory and for the rest of the night to listen and improve It is true she would now and then forget herself and confess she was pleased but  they soon brought her back again to miserable refinement She once praised the painting of the box in which we were sitting but was soon convinced that such paltry pieces ought rather to excite horror than satisfaction she ventured again to commend one of the singers but Mrs  Tibbs  soon let her know in the style of a connoisseur that the singer in question had neither ear voice nor judgment  Mr  Tibbs  now willing to prove that his wife's pretensions to music were just entreated her to favour the company with a song but to this she gave a positive denial for you know very well my dear says she that I am not in voice to day and when one's voice is not equal to one's judgment what signifies singing besides as there is no accompanyment it would be but spoiling music All these excuses however were overruled by the rest of the company who though one would think they already had music enough joined in the intreaty But particularly the widow now willing to convince the company of her breeding pressed so warmly that she seemed determined to take no refusal At last then the lady complied and after humming for some minutes began with such a voice and such affectation as I could perceive gave but little satisfaction to any except her husband He sat with rapture in his eye and beat time with his hand on the table  You must observe my friend that it is the custom of this country when a lady or gentleman happens to sing for the company to sit as mute and motionless as statues Every feature every limb must seem to correspond in fixed attention  and while the song continues they are to remain in a state of universal petrefaction In this mortifying situation we had continued for some time listening to the song and looking with tranquility when the master of the box came to inform us that the waterworks were going to begin At this information I could instantly perceive the widow bounce from her seat but correcting herself she sat down again repressed by motives of good breeding Mrs  Tibbs  who had seen the waterworks an hundred times resolving not to be interrupted continued her song without any share of mercy nor had the smallest pity on our impatience The widow's face I own gave me high entertainment in it I could plainly t  d the struggle she felt between good breeding and curiosity she talked of the waterworks the whole evening before and seemed to have come merely in order to see them but then she could not bounce out in the very middle of a song for that would be forfeiting all pretensions to high life or highlived company ever after Mrs  Tibbs  therefore kept on singing and we continued to listen till at last when the song was just concluded the waiter came to inform us that the waterworks were over  The waterworks over cried the widow the waterworks over already that's impossible they can't be over so soon It is not my business replied the fellow to contradict your ladyship I'll run again and see he went and soon returned with a confirmation of the dismal tidings No ceremony could now bind my friend's disappointed mistress she testified her displeasure in the openest manner in short she now began to find  fault in turn and at last insisted upon going home just at the time that Mr and Mrs  Tibbs  assured the company that the polite hours were going to begin and that the ladies would instantaneously be entertained with the horns Adieu  LETTER LXIX  From the same  NOT far from this city lives a poor tinker who has educated seven sons all at this very time in arms and fighting for their country and what reward do you think has the tinker from the state for such important services None in the world his sons when the war is over may probably be whipt from parish to parish as vagabonds and the old man when past labour may die a prisoner in some house of correction  Such a worthy subject in China would be held in universal reverence his services would be rewarded if not with dignities at least with an exemption from labour he would take the left hand at feasts and mandarines themselves would be proud to shew their submission The  English  laws punish vice the  Chinese  laws do more they reward virtue  Considering the little encouragement given to matrimony here I am not surprized at the discouragements given to propagation Would you believe it my dear  Fam Hoam  there are laws made which even forbid the peoples marrying each other By the head of  Confucius  I jest not  there are such laws in being here and yet their lawgivers have neither been instructed among the  Hottentot    nor imbibed their principles of equity from the natives of  Anamaboo  There are laws which ordain that no man shall marry a woman against her own consent This though contrary to what we are taught in  Asia  and though in some measure a clog upon matrimony I have no great objection to There are laws which ordain that no woman shall marry against her father and mother's consent unless arrived at an age of maturity by which is understood those years when women with us are generally past childbearing This must be a clog upon matrimony as it is more difficult for the lover to please three than one and much more difficult to please old people than young ones The laws ordain that the consenting couple shall take a long time to consider before they marry this is a very great clog because people love to have all rash actions done in a hurry It is ordained that all marriages shall be proclaimed before celebration this is a severe clog as many are ashamed to have their marriage made public from motives of vicious modesty and many afraid from views of temporal interest It is ordained that there is nothing sacred in the ceremony but that it may be dissolved to all intents and purposes by the authority of any civil magistrate And yet opposite to this it is ordained that the priest shall be paid a large sum of money for granting his sacred permission  Thus you see my friend that matrimony here is hedged round with so many obstructions that  those who are willing to break through or surmount them must be contented if at last they find it a bed of thorns The laws are not to blame for they have deterred the people from engaging as much as they could It is indeed become a very serious affair in  England  and none but serious people are generally found willing to engage The young the gay and the beautiful who have motives of passion only to induce them are seldom found to embark as those inducements are taken away and none but the old the ugly and the mercenary are seen to unite who if they have any posterity at all will probably be an illfavoured race like themselves  What gave rise to those laws might have been some such accidents as these It sometimes happened that a miser who had spent all his youth in scraping up money to give his daughter such a fortune as might get her a mandarin husband found his expectations disappointed at last by her running away with his footman this must have been a sad shock to the poor disconsolate parent to see his poor daughter in a one horse chaise when he had designed her for a coach and six what a stroke from Providence to see his dear money go to enrich a beggar all nature cried out at the profanation  It sometimes happened also that a lady who had inherited all the titles and all the nervous complaints of nobility thought sit to impair her dignity and mend her constitution by marrying a farmer this must have been a sad shock to her inconsolable relations to see so fine a flower snatched from a flourishing family and planted  in a dunghill this was an absolute inversion of the first principles of things  In order therefore to prevent the great from being thus contaminated by vulgar alliances the obstacles to matrimony have been so contrived that the rich only can marry amongst the rich and the poor who would leave celibacy must be content to encrease their poverty with a wife Thus have their laws fairly inverted the inducements to matrimony nature tells us that beauty is the proper allurement of those who are rich and money of those who are poor but things here are so contrived that the rich are invited to marry by that fortune which they do not want and the poor have no inducement but that beauty which they do not feel  An equal diffusion of riches through any country ever constitutes its happiness Great wealth in the possession of one stagnates and extreme poverty with another keeps him in unambitious indigence but the moderately rich are generally active not too far removed from poverty to fear its calamities nor too near extreme wealth to slacken the nerve of labour they remain still between both in a state of continual fluctuation How impolitic therefore are those laws which promote the accumulation of wealth among the rich more impolitic still in attempting to increase the depression on poverty  Bacon the English philosopher compares money to manure if gathered in heaps says he it does no good on the contrary it becomes offensive but being spread though never so think over the  surface of the earth it enriches the whole country Thus the wealth a nation possesses must expatiate or it is of no benefit to the public it becomes rather a grievance where matrimonial laws thus confine it to a few  But this restraint upon matrimonial community even considered in a physical light is injurious As those who rear up animals take all possible pains to cross the strain in order to improve the breed so in those countries where marriage is most free the inhabitants are found every age to improve in stature and in beauty on the contrary where it is confined to a  cast  a  tribe  or an  b  rd  as among the Gaurs the Jews or the Tartars each division soon assumes a family likeness and every tribe degenerates into peculiar deformity From hence it may be easily inferred that if the mandarines here are resolved only to marry among each other they will soon produce a posterity with mandarine faces and we shall see the heir of some honourable family scarce equal to the abortion of a country farmer  These are a few of the obstacles to marriage here and it is certain they have in some measure answered the end for celibacy is both frequent and fashionable Old batchelors appear abroad without a mask and old maids my dear  Fum Hoam  have been absolutely known to ogle To confess in friendship if I were an Englishman I fancy I should be an old batchelor myself I should never find courage to run through all the adventures prescribed by the law I could submit to court my mistress herself upon reasonable terms but to court her father her mother and  a long tribe of cousins aunts and relations and then stand the butt of a whole country church I would as soon turn tail and make love to her grandmother  I can conceive no other reason for thus loading matrimony with so many prohibitions unless it be that the country was thought already too populous and this was found to be the most effectual means of thinning it If this was the motive I cannot but congratulate the wise projectors on the success of their scheme Hail O ye dimsighted politicians ye weeders of men 'Tis yours to clip the wing of industry and convert Hymen to a broker 'Tis yours to behold small objects with a microscopic eye but to be blind to those which require an extent of vision 'Tis yours O ye discerners of mankind to lay the line between society and weaken that force by dividing which should bind with united vigour 'Tis yours to introduce national real distress in order to avoid the imaginary distresses of a few Your actions can be justified by an hundred reasons like truth they can be opposed by but a few reasons and those reasons are true Farewel  LETTER LXX  From Lien Chi Altangi to Hinpgo by the way of Moscow  AGE that lessens the enjoyment of life encreases our desire of living Those dangers which in the vigour of youth we had learned to despise assume now terrors as we grew old Our caution  encreasing as our years encrease fear becomes at last the prevailing passion of the mind and the small remainder of life is taken up in useless efforts to keep off our end or provide for a continued existence  Strange contradiction in our nature and to which even the wise are liable If I should judge of that part of life which lies before me by that which I have already seen the prospect is hideous Experience tells me that my past enjoyments have brought no real felicity and sensation assures me that those I have felt are stronger than those which are yet to come Yet experience and sensation in vain persuade hope more powerful than either dresses out the distant prospect in fancied beauty some happiness in long perspective still beckons me to pursue and like a losing gamester every new disappointment encreases my ardour to continue the game  Whence my friend this encreased love of life which grows upon us with our years whence comes it that we thus make greater efforts to preserve our existence at a period when it becomes scarce worth the keeping Is it that nature attentive to the preservation of mankind encreases our wishes to live while she lessens our enjoyments and as she robs the senses of every pleasure equips imagination in the spoil Life would be insupportable to an old man who loaded with infirmities feared death no more than when in the vigour of manhood the numberless calamities of decaying nature and the consciousness of surviving every pleasure would at once induce him with his own hand to terminate the scene of misery but happily the contempt of death forsakes  him at a time when it could only be prejudicial and life acquires an imaginary value in proportion as its real value is no more  Our attachment to every object around us encreases in general from the length of our acquaintance with it I would not chuse says a  French  philosopher to see an old post pulled up with which I had been long acquainted A mind long habituated to a certain set of objects insensibly becomes fond of seeing them visits them from habit and parts from them with reluctance from hence proceed the avarice of the old in every kind of possession They love the world and all that it produces they love life and all its advantages not because it gives them pleasure but because they have known it long  Chinvang the Chaste ascending the throne of China commanded that all who were unjustly detained in prison during the preceding reigns should be set free Among the number who came to thank their deliverer on this occasion there appeared a majestic old man who falling at the emperor's feet addressed him as follows "Great father of China behold a wretch now eightyfive years old who was shut up in a dungeon at the age of twentytwo I was imprisoned though a stranger to crime or without being even confronted by my accusers I have now lived in solitude and darkness for more than fifty years and am grown familiar with distress As yet dazzled with the splendour of that sun to which you have restored me I have been wandring the streets to find some friend that would assist or relieve or remember me but my friends my family and relations  are all dead and I am forgotten Permit me then O Chinvang to wear out the wretched remains of life in my former prison the walls of my dungeon are to me more pleasing than the most splendid palace I have not long to live and shall be unhappy except I spend the rest of my days where my youth was passed in that prison from whence you were pleased to release me  The old man's passion for confinement is similar to that we all have for life We are habituated to the prison we look round with discontent are displeased with the abode and yet the length of our captivity only encreases our fondness for the cell The trees we have planted the houses we have built or the posterity we have begotten all serve to bind us closer to earth and embitter our parting Life sues the young like a new acquaintance the companion as yet unexhausted is at once instructive and amusing 'tis company pleases yet for all this it is but little regarded To us who are declined in years life appears like an old friend its jests have been anticipated in former conversation it has no new story to make us smile no new improvement with which to surprize yet still we love it destitute of every agreement still we love it husband the wasting treasure with encreased frugality and feel all the poignancy of anguish in the fatal separation  Sir Philip Mordaunt was young beautiful sincere brave an Englishman He had a complete fortune of his own and the love of the king his master which was equivalent to riches Life opened all her treasure before him and promised a long succession of future happiness He came tasted of the entertainment but was disgusted even in  in the beginning He professed an aversion to living was tired of walking round the same circle had tried every enjoyment and found them all grow weaker at every repetition "If life be in youth so displeasing cried he to himself what will it appear when age comes on if it be at present indifferent sure it will then be execrable This thought embittered every reflection till at last with all the serenity of perverted reason he ended the debate with a pistol Had this selfdeluded man been apprized that existence grows more desirable to us the longer we exist he would have then faced old age without shrinking he would have boldly dared to live and served that society by his future assiduity which he basely injured by his desertion Adieu  LETTER LXXI  From Lien Chi Altangi to Fum Hoam first president of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin in China  IN reading the newspapers here I have reckoned up not less than twentyfive great men seventeen very great men and nine very extraordinary men in less than the compass of half a year These say the gazattes are the men that posterity are to gaze at with admiration these the names that fame will be employed in holding up for the astonishment of succeeding ages Let me see fortysix great men in half a year amounts just to ninetytwo in a year I wonder how posterity will be able to remember them all or whether the people in future times will have any other business to mind but that of getting the catalogue by heart  Does the mayor of a corporation make a speech he is instantly set down for a great man Does a pedant digest his common place book into a folio he quickly becomes great Does a poet string up trite sentiments in rhyme he also becomes the great man of the hour How diminutive soever the object of admiration each is followed by a crowd of still more diminutive admirers The shout begins in his train onward he marches toward immortality looks back at the pursuing crowd with selfsatisfaction catching all the oddities the whimsies the absurdities and the littlenesses of conscious greatness by the way  I was yesterday invited by a gentleman to dinner who promised that our entertainment should consist of an haunch of venison a turtle and a great man I came according to appointment The venison was fine the turtle good but the great man insupportable The moment I ventured to speak I was at once contradicted with a snap I attempted by a second and a third assault to retrieve my lost reputation but was still beat back with confusion I was resolved to attack him once more from entrenchment and turned the conversation upon the government of China but even here he asserted snapped and contradicted as before Heavens thought I this man pretends to know China even better than myself I looked round to see who was on my side but every eye was fixed in admiration on the great man I therefore at last thought proper to sit silent and act the pretty gentleman during the ensuing conversation  When a man has once secured a circle of admirers he may be as ridiculous here as he thinks proper  and it all passes for elevation of sentiment or learned absence If he transgresses the common forms of breeding mistakes even a teapot for a tobaccobox it is said that his thoughts are fixed on more important objects to speak and act like the rest of mankind is to be no greater than they There is something of oddity in the very idea of greatness for we are seldom astonished at a thing very much resembling ourselves  When the Tartars make a Lama their first care is to place him in a dark corner of the temple here he is to sithalf concealed from view to regulate the motion of his hands lips and eyes but above all he is enjoined gravity and silence This however is but the prelude to his apotheosis a set of emissaries are dispatched among the people to cry up his piety gravity and love of raw flesh the people take them at their word approach the Lama now become an idol with the most humble prostration he receives their addresses without motion commences a god and is ever after fed by his priests with the spoon of immortality The same receipt in this country serves to make a great man The idol only keeps close sends out his little emissaries to be hearty in his praise and straight whether statesman or author he is set down in the list of fame continuing to be praised while it is fashionable to praise or while he prudently keeps his minuteness concealed from the public  I have visited many countries and have been in cities without number yet never did I enter a town which could not produce ten or twelve of those little great men all fancying themselves  known to the rest of the world and complimenting each other upon their extensive reputation It is amusing enough when two of those domestic prodigies of learning mount the stage of ceremony and give and take praise from each other I have been present when a German doctor for having pronounced a panegyric upon a certain monk was thought the most ingenious man in the world till the monk soon after divided this reputation by returning the compliment by which means they both marched off with universal applause  The same degree of undeserved adulation that attends our great man while living often also follows him to the tomb It frequently happens that one of his little admirers sits down big with the important subject and is delivered of the history of his life and writings This may properly be called the revolutions of a life between the fireside and the easychair In this we learn the year in which he was born at what an early age he gave symptoms of uncommon genius and application together with some of his smart sayings collected by his aunt and mother while yet but a boy The next book introduces him to the university where we are informed of his amazing progress in learning his excellent skill in darning stockings and his new invention for papering books to save the covers He next makes his appearance in the republic of letters and publishes his folio Now the colossus is reared his works are eagerly bought up by all the purchasers of scarce books The learned societies invite him to become a member he disputes against some foreigner with a long Latin name conquers in the controversy is complimented by several authors of  gravity and importance is excessively fond of eggsauce with his pig becomes president of a literary club and dies in the meridian of his glory Happy they who thus have some little faithful attendant who never forsakes them but prepares to wrangle and to praise against every opposer at once ready to encrease their pride while living and their character when dead For you and I my friend who have no humble admirer thus to attend us we who neither are nor ever will be great men and who do not much care whether we are great men or no at least let us strive to be honest men and to have common sense  LETTER LXXII  To the same  THERE are numbers in this city who live by writing new books and yet there are thousands of volumes in every large library unread and forgotten This upon my arrival was one of those contradictions which I was unable to account for Is it possible said I that there should be any demand for new books before those already published are read Can there be so many employed in producing a commodity with which the market is already overstocked and with goods also better than any of modern manufacture  What at first view appeared an inconsistence is a proof at once of this people's wisdom and refinement Even allowing the works of their ancestors better written than theirs yet those of the moderns  acquire a real value by being marked with the impression of the times Antiquity has been in the possession of others the present is our own let us first therefore learn to know what belongs to ourselves and then if we have leisure cast our reflections back to the reign of  Shonou  who governed twenty thousand years before the creation of the moon  The volumes of antiquity like medals may very well serve to amuse the curious but the works of the moderns like the current coin of a kingdom are much better for immediate use the former are often prized above their intrinsic value and kept with care the latter seldom pass for more than they are worth and are often subject to the merciless hands of sweating critics and clipping compilers the works of antiquity were ever praised those of the moderns read the treasures of our ancestors have our esteem and we boast the passion those of cotemporary genius engage our heart although we blush to own it The visits we pay the former resemble those we pay the great the ceremony is troublesome and yet such as we would not chuse to forego our acquaintance with modern books is like sitting with a friend our pride is not flattered in the interview but it gives more internal satisfaction  In proportion as society refines new books must ever become more necessary Savage rusticity is reclaimed by oral admonition alone but the elegant excesses of refinement are best corrected by the still voice of studious enquiry In a polite age almost every person becomes a reader and receives more instruction from the press than the pulpit The preaching Bonse may instruct the illiterate  peasant but nothing less than the insinuating address of a fine writer can win its way to an heart already relaxed in all the effeminacy of refinement Books are necessary to correct the vices of the polite but those vices are ever changing and the antidote should be changed accordingly should still be new  Instead therefore of thinking the number of new publications here too great I could wish it still greater as they are the most useful instruments of reformation Every country must be instructed either by  writers  or  preachers  but as the number of readers encreases the number of hearers is proportionably diminished the writer becomes more useful and the preaching Bonse less necessary  Instead therefore of complaining that writers are overpaid when their works procure them a bare subsistance I should imagine it the duty of a state not only to encourage their numbers but their industry A Bonse is rewarded with immense riches for instructing only a few even of the most ignorant of the people and sure the poor scholar should not beg his bread who is capable of instructing a million  Of all rewards I grant the most pleasing to a man of real merit is fame but a polite age of all times is that in which scarce any share of merit can acquire it What numbers of fine writers in the latter empire of Rome when refinement was carried to the highest pitch have missed that fame and immortality which they had fondly arrogated to themselves How many Greek authors who wrote at that period when Constantinople was  the refined mistress of the empire now rest either not printed or not read in the libraries of Europe Those who came first while either state as yet was barbarous carried all the reputation away Authors as the age refined became more numerous and their numbers destroyed their fame It is but natural therefore for the writer when conscious that his works will not procure him fame hereafter to endeavour to make them turn out to his temporal interest here  Whatever be the motives which induce men to write whether avarice or fame the country becomes most wise and happy in which they most serve for instructors The countries where sacerdotal instruction alone is permitted remain in ignorance superstition and hopeless slavery In England where there are as many new books published as in all the rest of Europe together a spirit of freedom and reason reigns among the people they have been often known to act like fools they are generally found to think like men  The only danger that attends a multiplicity of publications is that some of them may be calculated to injure rather than benefit society But where writers are numerous they also serve as a check upon each other and perhaps a literary inquisition is the most terrible punishment that can be conceived to a literary transgressor  But to do the English justice there are but few offenders of this kind their publications in general aim at mending either the heart or improving the common weal The dullest writer talks of virtue and liberty and benevolence with  esteem tells his true story filled with good and wholesome advice warns against slavery bribery or the bite of a mad dog and dresses up his little useful magazine of knowledge and entertainment at least with a good intention The dunces of France on the other hand who have less encouragement are more vicious Tender hearts languishing eyes Leonora in love at thirteen extatic transports stolen blisses are the frivolous subjects of their frivolous memoirs In England if a bawdy blockhead thus breaks in on the community he sets his whole fraternity in a roar nor can he escape even though he should fly to nobility for shelter  Thus even dunces my friend may make themselves useful But there are others whom nature has blest with talents above the rest of mankind men capable of thinking with precision and impressing their thought with rapidity Beings who diffuse those regards upon mankind which others contract and settle upon themselves These deserve every honour from that community of which they are more peculiarly the children to such I would give my heart since to them I am indebted for its humanity Adieu  LETTER LXXIII  From Hingpo to Lien Chi Altangi by the way of Moscow  I Still remain at  Terki  where I have received that money which was remitted here in order to release me from captivity My fair companion still  improves in my esteem the more I know her mind her beauty becomes more poignant she appears charming even among the daughters of  Ci  cassia  Yet were I to examine her beauty with the art of a statuary I should find numbers here that far surpass her nature has not granted her all the boasted  Circassian  regularity of feature and yet she greatly exceeds the fairest of the country in the art of seizing the affections Whence have I often said to myself this resistless magic that attends even moderate charms though I regard the beauties of the country with admiration every interview weakens the impression but the form of Zelis grows upon my imagination I never behold her without an encrease of tenderness and respect Whence this injustice of the mind in preferring imperfect beauty to that which nature seems to have finished with care whence the infatuation that he whom a comet could not amaze should be astonished at a meteor When reason was thus fatigued to find an answer my imagination pursued the subject and this was the result  I fancied myself placed between two landscapes this called the  region of beauty  and that  the valley of the graces  the one adorned with all that luxuriant nature could bestow the fruits of various climates adorned the trees the grove resounded with music the gale breathed perfume every charm that could arise from symmetry and exact distribution were here conspicuous the whole  ering a prospect of pleasure without end  The v  lley of the graces  on the other hand seemed by  no means so inviting the streams and the groves appeared just as they usually do in frequented countries no magnificent parterres no consort in the grove the rivulet was edged with weeds and the rook joined its voice to that of the nightingale All was simplicity and nature  The most striking objects ever first allure the traveller I entered the region of beauty with encreased curiosity and promised myself endless satisfaction in being introduced to the presiding goddess I perceived several strangers who entered with the same design and what surprised me not a little was to see several others hastening to leave this abode of seeming felicity  After some fatigue I had at last the honour of being introduced to the goddess who represented Beauty in person She was seated on a throne at the foot of which stood several strangers lately introduced like me all regarding her form in extasy  Ah what eyes what lips how clear her complexion how perfect her shape  at these exclamations Beauty with downcast eyes would endeavour to counterfeit modesty but soon again looking round as if to confirm every spectator in his favourable sentiments sometimes she would attempt to allure us by smiles and at intervals would bridle back in order to inspire us with respect as well as tenderness  This ceremony lasted for some time and had so much employed our eyes that we had forgot all this while that the goddess was silent We soon however began to perceive the defect  what  said we among each other  are we to have  nothing but languishing airs soft looks and inclinations of the head will the goddess only deign to satisfy our eyes  Upon this one of the company stepped up to present her with some fruits he had gathered by the way She received the present most sweetly smiling and with one of the whitest hands in the world but still not a word escaped her lips  I now found that my companions grew weary of their homage they went off one by one and resolving not to be left hehind I offered to go in my turn when just at the door of the temple I was called back by a female whose name was  Pride  and who seemed displeased at the behaviour of the company  Where are you hastening  said she to me with an angry air  the goddess of beauty is here  I have been to visit her Madam replied I and find her more beautiful even than report had made her  And why then will you leave her  added the female I have seen her long enough returned I I have got all her features by heart Her eyes are still the same Her nose is a very fine one but it is still just such a nose now as it was half an hour ago could she throw a little more mind into her face perhaps I should be for wishing to have more of her company  What signifies  replied my female  whether she has a mind or not has she any occasion for a mind so formed as she is by nature If she had a common face indeed there might be some reason for thinking to improve it but when features are already perfect every alteration would but impair them A fine face is already at the point of perfection and a fine lady should endeavour to keep it so the impression it would  receive from thought would but disturb its whole oeconomy  To this speech I gave no reply but made the best of my way to the valley of the Graces Here I found all those who before had been my companions in the region of beauty now upon the same errand  As we entered the valley the prospect insensibly seemed to improve we found every thing so natural so domestic and pleasing that our minds which before were congealed in admiration now relaxed into gaiety and goodhumour We had designed to pay our respects to the presiding goddess but she was no where to be found One of our companions asserted that her temple lay to the right another to the left a third insisted that it was straight before us and a fourth that we had left it behind In short we found every thing familiar and charming but could not determine where to seek for the Grace in person  In this agreeable incertitude we passed several hours and though very desirous of finding the goddess by no means impatient of the delay Every part of the valley presented some minute beauty which without offering itself at once stole within the soul and captivated us with the charms of our retreat Still however we continued to search and might still have continued had we not been interrupted by a voice which though we could not see from whence it came addressed us in this manner  "If you would find the goddess of Grace seek her not under one form for she assumes a thousand Ever changing under the eye of inspection her variety rather than her figure is pleasing In contemplating her beauty the eye glides over every perfection with giddy delight and capable of fixing no where is charmed with the whole  Vultus nimium lubricus aspici Hor  She is now Contemplation with solemn look again Compassion with humid eye she now sparkles with joy soon every feature speaks distress her looks at times invite our approach at others repress our presumption the goddess cannot be properly called beautiful under any one of these forms but by combining them all she becomes irresistibly pleasing  Adieu  LETTER LXXIV  From Lien Chi Altangi to Fum Hoam first president of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin in China  THE Shops of London are as well furnished as those of Pekin Those of London have a picture hung at their door informing the passengers what they have to sell as those at Pekin have a board to assure the buyer that they have no intentions to cheat him  I was this morning to buy silk for a nightcap immediately upon entering the mercer's shop the master and his two men with wigs plaistered with  powder appeared to ask my commands They were certainly the civillest people alive if I but looked they flew to the place where I cast my eye every motion of mine sent them running round the whole shop for my satisfaction I informed them that I wanted what was good and they shewed me not less than forty pieces and each was better than the former the prettiest pattern in nature and the fittest in the world for nightcaps My very good friend said I to the mercer you must not pretend to instruct me in silks I know these in particular to be no better than your mere flimsy  Bungees That may be  cried the mercer who I afterwards found had never contradicted a man in his life  I can't pretend to say but they may but I can assure you my Lady Trail has had a sacque from this piece this very morning  But friend said I though my Lady has chosen a sacque from it I see no necessity that I should wear it for a nightcap  That may be  returned he again  yet what becomes a pretty Lady will at any time look well on a handsome Gentleman  This short compliment was thrown in so very seasonably upon my ugly face that even tho' I disliked the silk I desired him to cut me off the pattern of a nightcap  While this business was consigned to his journeyman the master himself took down some pieces of silk still finer than any I had yet seen and spreading them before me  There  cries he  there's beauty my Lord Snakeskin has bespoke the fellow to this for the birthnight this very morning it would look charmingly in waistcoats  But I don't want a waistcoat replied I  Not want a waistcoat  returned the mercer  then I would advise you to buy one when waistcoats are wanted you may depend  upon it they will come dear Always buy before you want and you are sure to be well used as they say in Cheapside  There was so much justice in his advice that I could not refuse taking it besides the silk which was really a good one encreased the temptation so I gave orders for that too  As I was waiting to have my bargains measured and cut which I know not how they executed but slowly during the interval the mercer entertained me with the modern manner of some of the nobility receiving company in their morning gowns  Perhaps Sir  adds he  you have a mind to see what kind of silk is universally worn  Without waiting for my reply he spreads a piece before me which might be reckoned beautiful even in China  If the nobility  continues he  were to know I sold this to any under a Right Honourable I should certainly lose their custom you see my Lord it is at once rich tastey and quite the thing  I am no Lord interrupted I  I beg pardon  cried he  but be pleased to remember when you intend buying a morning gown that you had an offer from me of something worth money Conscience Sir conscience is my way of dealing you may buy a morning gown now or you may stay till they become dearer and less fashionable but it is not my business to advise  In short most reverend  Fum  he persuaded me to buy a morning gown also and would probably have persuaded me to have bought half the goods in his shop if I had stayed long enough or was furnished with sufficient money  Upon returning home I could not help reflecting with some astonishment how this very man with such a confined education and capacity was  yet capable of turning me as he thought proper and molding me to his inclinations I know he was only answering his own purposes even while he attempted to appear solicitous about mine yet by a voluntary infatuation a sort of passion compounded of vanity and good nature I walked into the snare with my eyes open and put myself to future pain in order to give him immediate pleasure The wisdom of the ignorant somewhat resembles the instinct of animals it is diffused in but a very narrow sphere but within that circle it acts with vigour uniformity and success  Adieu  LETTER LXXV  From the same  FROM my former accounts you may be apt to fancy the English the most ridiculous people under the sun They are indeed ridiculous yet every other nation in Europe is equally so each laughs at each and the Asiatic at all  I may upon another occasion point out what is most strikingly absurd in other countries I shall at present consine myself only to France The first national peculiarity a traveller meets upon entering that kingdom is an odd sort of a staring vivacity in every eye not excepting even the children the people it seems have got it into their heads that they have more wit than others and so stare in order to look smart  I know not how it happens but there appears a sickly delicacy in the faces of their finest women This may have introduced the use of paint and paint produces wrinkles so that a fine lady shall look like an hag at twentythree But as in some measure they never appear young so it may be equally asserted that they actually think themselves never old a gentle Miss shall prepare for new conquests at sixty shall hobble a rigadoon when she can scarce walk without a crutch she shall affect the girl play her fan and her eyes and talk of sentiments bleeding hearts and expiring for love when actually dying with age Like a departing philosopher she attempts to make her last moments the most brilliant of her life  Their civility to strangers is what they are chiefly proud of and to confess sincerely their beggars are the very politest beggars I ever knew in other places a traveller is addressed with a piteous whine or a sturdy solemnity but a French beggar shall ask your charity with a very genteel bow and thank you for it with a smile and a shrugg  Another instance of this people's breeding I must not forget An Englishman would not speak his native language in a company of foreigners where he was sure that none understood him a travelling Hottentot himself would be silent if acquainted only with the language of his country but a Frenchman shall talk to you whether you understand his language or not never troubling his head whether you have learned French still he keeps up the conversation fixes his eye full in your face and asks  a thousand questions which he answers himself for want of a more satisfactory reply  But their civility to foreigners is not half so great as their admiration of themselves Every thing that belongs to them and their nation is great magnificent beyond expression quite romantic every garden is a paradise every hovel a palace and every woman an angel They shut their eyes close throw their mouths wide open and cry out in rapture Sacre What beauty O Ciel what taste mort de ma vie what grandeur was ever any people like ourselves we are the nation of men and all the rest no better than twolegged barbarians  I fancy the French would make the best cooks in the world if they had but meat as it is they can dress you out five different dishes from a nettletop seven from a dock leaf and twice as many from a frog's haunches these eat prettily enough when one is a little used to them are easy of digestion and seldom overload the stomach with crudities They seldom dine under seven hot dishes it is true indeed with all this magnificence they seldom spread a cloth before the guests but in that I cannot be angry with them since those who have got no linnen on their backs may very well be excused for wanting it upon their tables  Even religion itself loses its solemnity among them Upon their roads at about every five miles distance you see an image of the Virgin Mary dressed up in grim headcloaths painted cheeks and an old red petticoat before her a lamp is often  seen burning at which with the saint's permission I have frequently lighted my pipe Instead of the Virgin you are sometimes presented with a crucifix at other times with a wooden Saviour fitted out in complete garniture with sponge spear nails pincers hammer beeswax and vinegarbottle Some of these images I have been told came down from heaven if so in heaven they have but bungling workmen  In passing through their towns you frequently see the men sitting at the doors knitting stockings while the care of cultivating the ground and pruning the vines falls to the women This is perhaps the reason why the fair sex are granted some peculiar privileges in this country particularly when they can get horses of riding without a sidesaddle  But I begin to think you may find this description pert and dull enough perhaps it is so yet in general it is the manner in which the French usually describe foreigners and it is but just to  force  a part of that ridicule back upon them which they attempt to lavish on others  Adieu  LETTER LXXVI  From the same  THE two theatres which serve to amuse the citizens here are again opened for the winter The mimetic troops different from those of  the state begin their campaign when all the others quit the field and at a time when the Europeans cease to destroy each other in reality they are entertained with mock battles upon the stage  The dancing master once more shakes his quivering feet the carpenter prepares his paradise of pasteboard the hero resolves to cover his forehead with brass and the heroine begins to scour up her copper tail preparative to future operations in short all are in motion from the theatrical lettercarrier in yellow cloaths to Alexander the Great that stands on a stool  Both houses have already commenced hostilities War open war and no quarter received or given Two singing women like heralds have begun the contest the whole town is divided on this solemn occasion one has the finest pipe the other the finest manner one curtesies to the ground the other salutes the audience with a smile one comes on with modesty which asks the other with boldness which extorts applause one wears powder the other has none one has the longest waist but the other appears most easy all all is important and serious the town as yet perseveres in its neutrality a cause of such moment demands the most mature deliberation they continue to exhibit and it is very possible this contest may continue to please to the end of the season  But the Generals of either army have as I am told several reinforcements to lend occasional assistance If they produce a pair of diamond buckles at one house we have a pair of eyebrows  that can match them at the other If we outdo them in our attitude they can overcome us by a shrug if we can bring more children on the stage they can bring more guards in red cloaths who strut and shoulder their swords to the astonishment of every spectator  They tell me here that people frequent the theatre in order to be instructed as well as amused I smile to hear the assertion If I ever go to one of their playhouses what with trumpets hallowing behind the stage and bawling upon it I am quite dizzy before the performance is over If I enter the house with any sentiments in my head I am sure to have none going away the whole mind being filled with a dead march a funeral procession a catcall a jigg or a tempest  There is perhaps nothing more easy than to write properly for the English theatre I am amazed that none are apprenticed to the trade The author when well acquainted with the value of thunder and lightning when versed in all the mystery of sceneshifting and trapdoors when skilled in the proper periods to introduce a wirewalker or a waterfall when instructed in every actor's peculiar talent and capable of adapting his speeches to the supposed excellence when thus instructed knows all that can give a modern audience pleasure One player shines in an exclamation another in a groan a third in a horror a fourth in a start a fifth in a smile a sixth faints and a seventh figets round the stage with peculiar vivacity that piece therefore will succeed best where each has a proper opportunity of shining the actor's business is not so much to adapt  himself to the poet as the poet's to adapt himself to the actor  The great secret therefore of tragedywriting at present is a perfect acquaintance with theatrical  ah  's and  oh  's a certain number of these interspersed with  gods tortures racks  and  damnation  shall distort every actor almost into convulsions and draw tears from every spectator a proper use of these will infallibly fill the whole house with applause But above all a whining scene must strike most forcibly I would advise from my present knowledge of the audience the two favourite players of the town to introduce a scene of this sort in every play Towards the middle of the last act I would have them enter with wild looks and outspread arms there is no necessity for speaking they are only to groan at each other they must vary the tones of exclamation and despair through the whole theatrical gamut wring their figures into every shape of distress and when their calamities have drawn a proper quantity of tears from the sympathetic spectators they may go off in dumb solemnity at different doors clasping their hands or slapping their pocketholes this which may be called a tragic pantomime will answer every purpose of moving the passions as well as words could have done and it must save those expences which go to reward an author  All modern plays that would keep the audience alive must be conceived in this manner and indeed many a modern play is made up on no other plan This is the merit that lifts up the heart like opium into a rapture of insensibility and can dismiss the mind from all the fatigue of thinking this is the eloquence that shines in many  a long forgotten scene which has been reckoned excessive fine upon acting this the lightening that flashes no less in the Hyperbolical tyrant  who breakfasts on the wind  than in little Norval  as harmless as the babe unborn  Adieu  LETTER LXXVII  From the same  I HAVE always regarded the spirit of mercy which appears in the Chinese laws with admiration An order for the execution of a criminal is carried from court by slow journies of six miles a day but a pardon is sent down with the most rapid dispatch If five sons of the same father be guilty of the same offence one of them is forgiven in order to continue the family and comfort his aged parents in their decline  Similar to this there is a spirit of mercy breathes through the laws of England which some erroneously endeavour to suppress the laws however seem unwilling to punish the offender or to furnish the officers of justice with every means of acting with severity Those who arrest debtors are denied the use of arms the nightly watch is permitted to repress the disorders of the drunken citizens only with clubs justice in such a case seems to hide her terrors and permits some offenders to escape rather than load any with a punishment disproportioned to the crime  Thus it is the glory of an Englishman that he is not only governed by laws but that these are  also tempered by mercy a country restrained by severe laws and those too executed with severity as in Japan is under the most terrible species of tyranny a royal tyrant is generally dreadful to the great but numerous penal laws grind every rank of people and chiefly those least able to resist oppression the poor  It is very possible thus for a people to become slaves to laws of their own enacting as the Athenians were to those of Draco  'It might first happen says the historian that men with peculiar talents for villainy attempted to evade the ordinances already established their practices therefore soon brought on a new law levelled against them but the same degree of cunning which had taught the knave to evade the former statutes taught him to evade the latter also he flew to new shifts while justice pursued with new ordinances still however he kept his proper distance and whenever one crime was judged penal by the state he left committing it in order to practise some unforbidden species of villainy Thus the criminal against whom the threatenings were denounced always escaped free while the simple rogue alone felt the rigour of justice In the mean time penal laws became numerous almost every person in the state unknowingly at different times offended and was every moment subject to a malicious prosecution'  In fact penal laws instead of preventing crimes are generally enacted after the commission instead of repressing the growth of ingenious villainy only multiply deceit by putting it upon new shifts and expedients of practising with impunity  Such laws therefore resemble the guards which are sometimes imposed upon tributary Princes apparently indeed to secure them from danger but in reality to confirm their captivity  Penal laws it must be allowed secure property in a state but they also diminish personal security in the same proportion There is no positive law how equitable soever that may not be sometimes capable of injustice When a law enacted to make theft punishable with death happens to be equitably executed it can at best only guard our possessions but when by favour or ignorance justice pronounces a wrong verdict it then attacks our lives since in such a case the whole community suffers with the innocent victim if therefore in order to secure the effects of one man I should make a law which may take away the life of another in such a case to attain a smaller good I am guilty of a greater evil to secure society in the possession of a bauble I render a real and valuable possession precarious And indeed the experience of every age may serve to vindicate the assertion No law could be more just than that called  lesae Majestatis  when Rome was governed by Emperors It was but reasonable that every conspiracy against the administration should be detected and punished yet what terrible slaughters succeeded in consequence of its enacting proscriptions stranglings poisonings in almost every family of distinction yet all done in a legal way every criminal had his trial and lost his life by a majority of witnesses  And such will ever be the case where punishments are numerous and where a weak vicious  but above all where a mercenary magistrate is concerned in their execution such a man desires to see penal laws encreased since he too frequently has it in his power to turn them into instruments of extortion in such hands the more laws the wider means not of satisfying justice but of satiating avarice  A mercenary magistrate who is rewarded in proportion not to his integrity but to the number he convicts must be a person of the most unblemished character or he will lean on the side of cruelty and when once the work of injustice is begun it is impossible to tell how far it will proceed it is said of the Hyena that naturally it is no way ravenous but when once it has tasted human flesh it becomes the most voracious animal of the forest and continues to persecute mankind ever after A corrupt magistrate may be considered as a human Hyena he begins perhaps by a private snap he goes on to a morsel among friends he proceeds to a meal in public from a meal he advances to a surfeit and at last sucks blood like a vampyre  Not into such hands should the administration of justice be entrusted but to those who know how to reward as well as to punish it was a fine saying of Nangfu the emperor who being told that his enemies had raised an insurrection in one of the distant provinces Come then my friends said he follow me and I promise you that we shall quickly destroy them he marched forward and the rebels submitted upon his approach All now thought that he would take the most signal revenge but were surprized to see the captives  treated with mildness and humanity How cries his first minister is this the manner in which you fulfil your promise your royal word was given that your enemies should be destroyed and behold you have pardoned all and even caressed some I promised replied the emperor with a generous air to  destroy  my enemies I have fulfilled my word for see they are enemies no longer I have made  friends  of them  This could it always succeed were the true method of destroying the enemies of a state well it were if rewards and mercy alone could regulate the commonwealth but since punishments are sometimes necessary let them at least be rendered terrible by being executed but seldom and let justice lift her sword rather to terrify than revenge  Adieu  LETTER LXXVIII  From the same  I HAVE as yet given you but a short and imperfect description of the Ladies of England Woman my friend is a subject not easily understood even in China what therefore can be expected from my knowledge of the sex in a country where they are universally allowed to be riddles and I but a stranger  To confess a truth I was afraid to begin the description lest the sex should undergo some new revolution before it was finished and my picture  should thus become old before it could well be said to have ever been new Today they are lifted upon stilts tomorrow they lower their heels and raise their heads their cloaths at one time are bloated out with whalebone at present they have laid their hoops aside and are become as slim as mermaids All all is in a state of continual fluctuation from the Mandarine's wife who rattles through the streets in her chariot to the humble sempstress who clatters over the pavement in ironshod pattens  What chiefly distinguishes the sex at present is the train As a Lady's quality or fashion was once determined here by the circumference of her hoop both are now measured by the length of her tail Women of moderate fortunes are contented with tails moderately long but ladies of true taste and distinction set no bounds to their ambition in this particular I am told the Lady Mayoress on days of ceremony carries one longer than a bellwether of Bantam whose tail you know is trundled along in a wheelbarrow  Sun of China what contradictions do we find in this strange world not only the people of different countries think in opposition to each other but the inhabitants of a single island are often found inconsistent with themselves would you believe it this very people my Fum who are so fond of seeing their women with long tails at the same time dock their horses to the very rump  But you may easily guess that I am no way displeased with a fashion which tends to encrease a demand for the commodities of the East and is so  very beneficial to the country in which I was born Nothing can be better calculated to encrease the price of silk than the present manner of dressing A lady's train is not bought but at some expence and after it has swept the public walks for a very few evenings is fit to be worn no longer more silk must be bought in order to repair the breach and some ladies of peculiar oeconomy are thus found to patch up their tails eight or ten times in a season This unnecessary consumption may introduce poverty here but then we shall be the richer for it in China  The man in black who is a professed enemy to this manner of ornamenting the tail assures me there are numberless inconveniencies attending it and that a lady dressed up to the fashion is as much a cripple as any in Nankin But his chief indignation is levelled at those who dress in this manner without a proper fortune to support it He assures me that he has known some who would have a tail though they wanted a petticoat and others who without any other pretensions fancied they became ladies merely from the addition of three superfluous yards of ragged silk I know a thrifty good woman continues he who thinking herself obliged to carry a train like her betters never walks from home without the uneasy apprehensions of wearing it out too soon every excursion she makes gives her new anxiety and her train is every bit as importunate and wounds her peace as much as the bladder we sometimes see tied to the tail of a cat  Nay he ventures to affirm that a train may often bring a lady into the most critical circumstances for should a rude fellow says he offer  to come up to ravish a kiss and the lady attempt to avoid it in retiring she must necessarily tread upon her train and thus fall fairly upon her back by which means every one knows her cloaths may be spoiled  The ladies here make no scruple to laugh at the smallness of a Chinese slipper but I fancy our wives at China would have a more real cause of laughter could they but see the immoderate length of an European train Head of Confucius to view a human being crippling herself with a great unwieldy tail for our diversion backward she cannot go forward she must move but slowly and if ever she attempts to turn round it must be in a circle not smaller than that described by the wheeling crocodile when it would face an assailant And yet to think that all this confers importance and majesty to think that a lady acquires additional respect from fifteen yards of trailing taffety I can't contain ha ha ha this is certainly a remnant of European barbarity the female Tartar dressed in sheepskins is in far more convenient drapery Their own writers have sometimes inveigh'd against the absurdity of this fashion but perhaps it has never been ridiculed so well as upon the Italian theatre where Pasquarielo being engaged to attend on the countess of Fernambroco having one of his hands employed in carrying her muff and the other her lapdog he bears her train majestically along by sticking it in the waistband of his breeches  Adieu  LETTER LXXIX  From the same  A Dispute has for some time divided the philosophers of Europe it is debated whether arts and sciences are more serviceable or prejudicial to mankind They who maintain the cause of literature endeavour to prove their usefulness from the impossibility of a large number of men subsisting in a small tract of country without them from the pleasure which attends the acquisition and from the influence of knowledge in promoting practical morality  They who maintain the opposite opinion display the happiness and innocence of those uncultivated nations who live without learning urge the numerous vices which are to be found only in polished society enlarge upon the oppression the cruelty and the blood which must necessarily be shed in order to cement civil society and insist upon the happy equality of conditions in a barbarous state preferable to the unnatural subordination of a more refined constitution  This dispute which has already given so much employment to speculative indolence has been managed with much ardour and not to suppress our sentiments with but little sagacity They who insist that the sciences are useful in  refined  society are certainly right and they who maintain that  barbarous  nations are more happy without them are right also but when one side for this reason attempts to prove them as universally  useful to the solitary barbarian as to the native of a crowded commonwealth or when the other endeavours to banish them as prejudicial to all society even from populous states as well as from the inhabitants of the wilderness they are both wrong since that knowledge which makes the happiness of a refined European would be a torment to the precarious tenant of an Asiatic wild  Let me to prove this transport the imagination for a moment to the midst of a forest in Siberia There we behold the inhabitant poor indeed but equally fond of happiness with the most refined philosopher of China The earth lies uncultivated and uninhabited for miles around him his little family and he the sole and undisputed possessors In such circumstances nature and reason will induce him to prefer a hunter's life to that of cultivating the earth He will certainly adhere to that manner of living which is carried on at the smallest expence of labour and that food which is most agreeable to the appetite he will prefer indolent though precarious luxury to a laborious though permanent competence and a knowledge of his own happiness will determine him to persevere in native barbarity  In like manner his happiness will incline him to bind himself by no law Laws are made in order to secure present property but he is possessed of no property which he is afraid to lose and desires no more than will be sufficient to sustain him to enter into compacts with others would be undergoing a voluntary obligation without the expectance of any reward He and his countrymen are tenants not rivals in the same  inexhaustible forest the encreased possessions of one by no means diminishes the expectations arising from equal assiduity in another there are no need of laws therefore to repress ambition where there can be no mischief attending its most boundless gratifications  Our solitary Siberian will in like manner find the sciences not only entirely useless in directing his practice but disgusting even in speculation In every contemplation our curiosity must be first excited by the  appearances  of things before our reason undergoes the fatigue of investigating the  causes  Some of those appearances are produced by experiment others by minute enquiry some arise from a knowledge of foreign climates and others from an intimate study of our own But there are few objects in comparison which present themselves to the inhabitant of a barbarous country the game he hunts or the transient cottage he builds make up the chief objects of his concern his curiosity therefore must be proportionably less and if that is diminished the reasoning faculty will be diminished in proportion  Besides sensual enjoyment adds wings to curiosity We consider few objects with ardent attention but those which have some connection with our wishes our pleasures or our necessities A desire of enjoyment first interests our passions in the pursuit points out the object of investigation and reason then comments where sense has led the way An encrease in the number of our enjoyments therefore necessarily produces an encrease  of scientific research but in countries where almost every enjoyment is wanting reason there seems destitute of its great inspirer and speculation is the business of fools when it becomes its own reward  The barbarous Siberian is too wise therefore to exhaust his time in quest of knowledge which neither curiosity prompts nor pleasure impells him to pursue When told of the exact admeasurement of a degree upon the equator at Quito he feels no pleasure in the account when informed that such a discovery tends to promote navigation and commerce he finds himself no way interested in either A discovery which some have pursued at the hazard of their lives affects him with neither astonishment nor pleasure He is satisfied with thoroughly understanding the few objects which contribute to his own felicity he knows the properest places where to lay the snare for the sable and discerns the value of furrs with more than European sagacity More extended knowledge would only serve to render him unhappy it might lend a ray to shew him the misery of his situation but could not guide him in his efforts to avoid it Ignorance is the happiness of the poor  The misery of a being endowed with sentiments above its capacity of fruition is most admirably described in one of the fables of Locman the Indian moralist "An elephant that had been peculiarly serviceable in fighting the battles of Wistnow was ordered by the god to wish for whatever he thought proper and the desire should be attended with immediate gratification The elephant thanked his benefactor on bended knees  and desired to be endowed with the reason and the faculties of a man Wistnow was sorry to hear the foolish request and endeavoured to dissuade him from his misplaced ambition but finding it to no purpose gave him at last such a portion of wisdom as could correct even the Zendavesta of Zoroaster The reasoning elephant went away rejoicing in his new acquisition and though his body still retained its ancient form he found his appetites and passions entirely altered He first considered that it would not only be more comfortable but also more becoming to wear cloaths but unhappily he had no method of making them himself nor had he the use of speech to demand them from others and this was the first time he felt real anxiety He soon perceived how much more elegantly men were fed than he therefore he began to loath his usual food and longed for those delicacies which adorn the tables of princes but here again he found it impossible to be satisfied for though he could easily obtain flesh yet he sound it impossible to dress it in any degree of perfection In short every pleasure that contributed to the felicity of mankind served only to render him more miserable as he found himself utterly deprived of the power of enjoyment In this manner he led a repining discontented life detesting himself and displeased with his ill judged ambition till at last his benefactor Wistnow taking compassion on his forlorn situation restored him to the ignorance and the happiness which he was originally formed to enjoy"  No my friend to attempt to introduce the sciences into a nation of wandering barbarians is only  to render them more miserable than even nature designed they should be A life of simplicity is best fitted to a state of solitude  The great lawgiver of Russia attempted to improve the desolate inhabitants of Siberia by sending among them some of the politest men of Europe The consequence has shewn that the country was as yet unfit to receive them they languished for a time with a sort of exotic malady every day degenerated from themselves and at last instead of rendering the country more polite they conformed to the soil and put on barbarity  No my friend in order to make the sciences useful in any country it must first become populous the inhabitant must go through the different stages of hunter shepherd▪ and husbandman then when property becomes valuable and consequently gives cause for injustice then when laws are appointed to repress injury and secure possession when men by the sanction of those laws become possessed of superfluity when luxury is thus introduced and demands its continual supply then it is that the sciences become necessary and useful the state then cannot subsist without them they must then be introduced at once to teach men to draw the greatest possible quantity of pleasure from circumscribed possession and to restrain them within the bounds of moderate enjoyment  The sciences are not the cause of luxury but its consequence and this destroyer thus brings with it an antidote which resists the virulence of its own poison By asserting that luxury introduces the sciences we assert a truth but if with those who reject the utility of learning▪ we  assert that the sciences also introduce luxury we shall be at once false absurd and ridiculous  Adieu  LETTER LXXX  From Lien Chi Altangi to Hingpo by the way of Moscow  YOU are now arrived at an age my son when pleasure dissuades from application but rob not by present gratification all the succeeding period of life of its happiness Sacrifice a little pleasure at first to the expectance of greater The study of a very few years will make the rest of life compleatly easy  But instead of continuing the subject myself take the following instructions borrowed from a modern philosopher of China  A translation of this passage may also be seen in Du Halde Vol II Fol p and This extract will at least serve to shew that fondness for humour which appears in the writings of the Chinese  "He who has begun his fortune by study will certainly confirm it by perseverance The love of books damps the passion for pleasure and when this passion is once extinguished life is then cheaply supported thus a man being possessed of more than he wants can never be subject to great disappointments and avoids all those meannesses which indigence sometimes unavoidably produces  "There is unspeakable pleasure attending the life of a voluntary student The first time I read  an excellent book it is to me just as if I had gained a new friend When I read over a book I have perused before it resembles the meeting with an old one We ought to lay hold of every incident in life for improvement the trifling as well as the important It is not one diamond alone which gives lustre to another a common coarse stone is also employed for that purpose Thus I ought to draw advantage from the insults and contempt I meet with from a worthless fellow His brutality ought to induce me to selfexamination and correct every blemish that may have given rise to his calumny  "Yet with all the pleasures and profits which are generally produced by learning parents often find it difficult to induce their children to study They often seem dragged to what wears the appearance of application Thus being dilatory in the beginning all future hopes of eminence are entirely cut off If they find themselves obliged to write two lines more polite than ordinary their pencil then seems as heavy as a millstone and they spend ten years in turning two or three periods with propriety  "These persons are most at a loss when a banquet is almost over the plate and the dice go round that the number of little verses which each is obliged to repeat may be determined by chance The booby when it comes to his turn appears quite stupid and insensible The company divert themselves with his confusion and sneers winks and whispers are circulated at his expence As for him he opens a pair of large heavy eyes stares at all about him and even offers to join in the laugh  without ever considering himself as the burthen of all their good humour  "But it is of no importance to read much except you be regular in your reading If it be interrupted for any considerable time it can never be attended with proper improvement There are some who study for one day with intense application and repose themselves for ten days after But wisdom is a coquet and must be courted with unabating assiduity  "It was a saying of the ancients that a man never opens a book without reaping some advantage by it I say with them that every book can serve to make us more expert except romances and these are no better than instruments of debauchery They are dangerous fictions where love is the ruling passion  "The most indecent strokes there pass for turns of wit intrigue and criminal liberties for gallantry and politeness Assignations and even villainy are put in such strong lights as may inspire even grown men with the strongest passion how much more therefore ought the youth of either sex to dread them whose reason is so weak and whose hearts are so susceptible of passion  "To slip in by a backdoor or leap a wall are accomplishments that when handsomely set off enchant a young heart It is true the plot is commonly wound up by a marriage concluded with the consent of parents and adjusted by every ceremony prescribed by law But as in the body of the work there are many passages that offend good  morals overthrow laudable customs violate the laws and destroy the duties most essential to society virtue is thereby exposed to the most dangerous attacks  "But say some the authors of these romances have nothing in view but to represent vice punished and virtue rewarded Granted But will the greater number of readers take notice of these punishments and rewards Are not their minds carried to something else Can it be imagined that the art with which the author inspires the love of virtue can overcome that crowd of thoughts which sway them to licentiousness To be able to inculcate virtue by so leaky a vehicle the author must be a philosopher of the first rank But in our age we can find but few first rate philosophers  "Avoid such performances where vice assumes the face of virtue seek wisdom and knowledge without ever thinking you have found them A man is wise while he continues in the pursuit of wisdom but when he once fancies that he has found the object of his enquiry he then becomes a fool Learn to pursue virtue from the man that is blind who never makes a step without first examining the ground with his staff  "The world is like a vast sea mankind like a vessel sailing on its tempestuous bosom Our prudence is its sails the sciences serve us for oars good or bad fortune are the favourable or contrary winds and judgment is the rudder without this last the vessel is tossed by every billow and will find shipwreck in every breeze In a  word obscurity and indigence are the parents of vigilance and oeconomy vigilance and oeconomy of riches and honour riches and honour of pride and luxury pride and luxury of impurity and idleness and impurity and idleness again produce indigence and obscurity Such are the revolutions of life" Adieu  LETTER LXXXI  From Lien Chi Altangi to Fum Hoam first president of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin in China  I Fancy the character of a poet is in every country the same fond of enjoying the present careless of the future his conversation that of a man of sense his actions those of a fool of fortitude able to stand unmoved at the bursting of an earthquake yet of sensibility to be affected by the breaking of a teacup such is his character which considered in every light is the very opposite of that which leads to riches  The poets of the west are as remarkable for their indigence as their genius and yet among the numerous hospitals designed to relieve the poor I have heard of but one erected for the benefit of decayed authors This was founded by pope Urban VIII and called the retreat of the incurables intimating that it was equally impossible to reclaim the patients who sued for reception from poverty or from poetry To be sincere were I to send you an account of the lives of the western poets either antient or modern I fancy  you would think me employed in collecting materials for an history of human wretchedness  Homer is the first poet and beggar of note among the antients he was blind and sung his ballads about the streets but it is observed that his mouth was more frequently filled with verses than with bread Plautus the comic poet was better off he had two trades he was a poet for his diversion and helped to turn a mill in order to gain a livelihood Terence was a slave and Boethius died in a jail  Among the Italians Paulo Burghese almost as good a poet as Tasso knew fourteen different trades and yet died because he could get employment in none Tasso himself who had the most amiable character of all poets has often been obliged to borrow a crown from some friend in order to pay for a month's subsistence he has left us a pretty sonnet addressed to his cat in which he begs the light of her eyes to write by being too poor to afford himself a candle But Bentivoglio poor Bentivoglio chiefly demands our pity His comedies will last with the Italian language he dissipated a noble fortune in acts of charity and benevolence but falling into misery in his old age was refused to be admitted into an hospital which he himself had erected  In Spain it is said the great Cervantes died of hunger and it is certain that the famous Camoens ended his days in an hospital  If we turn to France we shall there find even stronger instances of the ingratitude of the public Vaugelas one of the politest writers and one of the  honestest men of his time was sirnamed the Owl from his being obliged to keep within all day and venture out only by night through fear of his creditors His last will is very remarkable after having bequeathed all his worldly substance to the discharging his debts he goes on thus But as there still may remain some creditors unpaid even after all that I have shall be disposed of in such a case it is my last will that my body should be sold to the surgeons to the best advantage and that the purchase should go to the discharging those debts which I owe to society so that if I could not while living at least when dead I may be useful  Cassander was one of the greatest geniuses of his time yet all his merit could not procure him a bare subsistence Being by degrees driven into an hatred of all mankind from the little pity he found amongst them he even ventured at last ungratefully to impute his calamities to providence In his last agonies when the priest entreated him to rely on the justice of heaven and ask mercy from him that made him  If God  replies he  has shewn me no justice here what reason have I to expect any from him hereafter  But being answered that a suspension of justice was no argument that should induce us to doubt of its reality let me entreat you continued his confessor by all that is dear to be reconciled to God your father your maker and friend  No  replied the exasperated wretch  you know the manner in which he left me to live  and pointing to the straw on which he was stretched  and you see the manner in which he leaves me to die  But the sufferings of the poet in other countries is nothing when compared to his distresses here the names of Spencer and Otway Butler and Dryden  are every day mentioned as a national reproach some of them lived in a state of precarious indigence and others literally died of hunger  At present the few poets of England no longer depend on the Great for subsistence they have now no other patrons but the public and the public collectively considered is a good and a generous master It is indeed too frequently mistaken as to the merits of every candidate for favour but to make amends it is never mistaken long A performance indeed may be forced for a time into reputation but destitute of real merit it soon sinks time the touchstone of what is truly valuable will soon discover the fraud and an author should never arrogate to himself any share of success till his works have been read at least ten years with satisfaction  A man of letters at present whose works are valuable is perfectly sensible of their value Every polite member of the community by buying what he writes contributes to reward him The ridicule therefore of living in a garret might have been wit in the last age but continues such no longer because no longer true A writer of real merit now may easily be rich if his heart be set only on fortune and for those who have no merit it is but fit that such should remain in merited obscurity He may now refuse an invitation to dinner without fearing to incur his patron's displeasure or to starve by remaining at home He may now venture to appear in company with just such cloaths as other men generally wear and talk even to princes with all the conscious superiority of wisdom Though he cannot boast of fortune here yet he can bravely assert the dignity of independence Adieu  LETTER LXXXII  From the same  I HAVE interested myself so long in all the concerns of this people that I am almost become an Englishman I now begin to read with pleasure of their taking towns or gaining battles and secretly wish disappointment to all the enemies of Britain Yet still my regard to mankind fills me with concern for their contentions I could wish to see the disturbances of Europe once more amicably adjusted I am an enemy to nothing in this good world but war I hate fighting between rival states I hate it between man and man I hare fighting even between women  I already informed you that while Europe was at variance we were also threatened from the stage with an irreconcileable opposition and that our singing women were resolved to sing at each other to the end of the season O my friend those fears were just They are nor only determined to sing at each other to the end of the season but what is worse to sing the same song and what is still more insupportable to make us pay for hearing  If they be for war for my part I should advise them to have a public congress and there fairly squall at each other What signifies sounding the trumpet of defiance at a distance and calling in the town to fight their battles I would have them come boldly into one of the most open and frequented streets face to face and there try their still in quavering  However this may be resolved I am that they shall not touch one single piece of silver more of mine Though I have ears for music thanks to heaven they are not altogether asses ears What Polly and the Pickpocket tonight Polly and the Pickpocket tomorrow night and Polly and the Pickpocket again I want patience I'll hear no more My soul is out of tune all jarring discord and confusion Rest rest ye three dear clinking shillings in my pocket's bottom the music you make is more harmonious to my spirit than catgut rosin or all the nightingales that ever chirruped in petticoats  But what raises my indignation to the greatest degree is that this piping does not only pester me on the stage but is my punishment in private conversation What is it to me whether the  fine pipe  of one or the  great manner  of the other be preferable what care I if one has a better top or the other a nobler bottom how am I concerned if one sings from the stomach or the other sings with a snap yet paltry as these matters are they make a subject of debate wherever I go and this musical dispute especially among the fair sex almost always ends in a very unmusical altercation  Sure the spirit of contention is mixed into the very constitution of the people divisions among the inhabitants of other countries arise only from their higher concerns but subjects the most contemptible are made an affair of party here the spirit is carried even into their amusements The very ladies whose duty should seem to allay the impetuosity of the opposite sex become themselves party champions engage in the thickest of  the fight scold at each other and shew their courage even at the expence of their lovers and their beauty  There are even a numerous set of poets who help to keep up the contention and write for the stage Mistake me not I don't mean pieces to be acted upon it but panegyrical verses on the performers for that is the most universal method of writing for the stage at present It is the business of the stagepoet therefore to watch the appearance of every new player at his own house and so come out next day with a flaunting copy of newspaper verses In these nature and the actor may be set to run races the player always coming off victorious or nature may mistake him for herself or old Shakespear may put on his windingsheet and pay him a visit or the tuneful nine may strike up their harps in his praise or should it happen to be an actress Venus the beauteous queen of love and the naked graces are ever in waiting the lady must be herself a goddess bred and born she mustbut you shall have a specimen of one of these poems which may convey a more precise idea  On seeing Mrs * * perform in the character of * * * *  To you bright fair the nine address their lays  And tune my feeble voice to sing thy praise  The heartfelt power of every charm divine  Who can withstand their allcommanding shine  See how she moves along with every grace  While soulbrought tears steal down each shining face  She speaks 'tis rapture all and nameless bliss  Ye gods what transport e'er compar'd to this  As when in Paphian groves the queen of love  With fond complaint address'd the listening Jove  'Twas joy and endless blisses all around  And rocks forgot their hardness at the sound  Then first at last even Jove was taken in  And felt her charms without disguise within  And yet think not my friend that I have any particular animosity against the champions who are at the head of the present commotion on the contrary I could find pleasure in their music if served up at proper intervals if I heard it only on proper occasions and not about it wherever I go In fact I could patronize them both and as an instance of my condescension in this particular they may come and give me a song at my lodgings on any evening when I'm at leisure provided they keep a becoming distance and stand while they continue to entertain me with decent humility at the door  You perceive I have not read the seventeen books of Chinese ceremonies to no purpose I know the proper share of respect due to every rank in society Stageplayers fire eaters singing women dancingdogs wild beasts and wirewalkers as their efforts are exerted for our amusement ought not  entirely  to be despised The laws of every country should allow them to play their tricks at least with impunity They should not be branded with the ignominious appellation of vagabonds at least they deserve a rank in society equal to the mystery of barbers or undertakers and could my influence extend so far they should  be allowed to earn even forty or fifty pounds a year if eminent in their profession  I am sensible however that you will censure me of profusion in this respect bred up as you are in the narrow prejudices of eastern frugality You will undoubtedly assert that such a stipend is too great for so useless an employment Yet how will your surprize encrease when told that though the law holds them as vagabonds many of them earn more than a thousand a year You are amazed There is cause for amazement A vagabond with a thousand a year is indeed a curiosity in nature a wonder far surpassing the flying fish petrified crab or travelling lobster However from my great love to the profession I would willingly have them divested of part of their contempt and part of their finery the law should kindly take them under the wing of protection fix them into a corporation like that of the barbers and abridge their ignominy and their pensions As to their abilities in other respects I would leave that entirely to the public who are certainly in this case the properest judges whether they despise them or no  Yes my  Fum  I would abridge their pensions A theatrical warrior who conducts the battles of the stage should be cooped up with the same caution as a Bantum cock that is kept for fighting When one of those animals is taken from its native dunghill we retrench it both in the quantity of its food and the number of its seraglio players should in the same manner be fed not fattened they should be permitted to get their bread but not eat the people's bread into the bargain  and instead of being permitted to keep four mistresses in conscience they should be contented only with two  Were stageplayers thus brought into bounds perhaps we should find their admirers less sanguine and consequently less ridiculous in patronizing them We should no longer be struck with the absurdity of seeing the same people whose valour makes such a figure abroad apostrophizing in the praise of a bouncing blockhead and wrangling in the defence of a coppertailed actress at home  I shall conclude my letter with the sensible admonition of  Mê  the philosopher "You love harmony says he and are charmed with music I do not blame you for hearing a fine voice when you are in your closet with a lovely parterre under your eye or in the night time while perhaps the moon diffuses her silver rays But is a man to carry this passion so far as to let a company of comedians musicians and singers grow rich upon his exhausted fortune If so he resembles one of those dead bodies whose brains the embalmers have picked out through its ears"  Adieu  LETTER LXXXIII  From the same  OF all the places of amusement where gentlemen and ladies are entertained I have not been yet to visit Newmarket This I am told is a large field where upon certain occasions three or four  horses are brought together then set a running and that horse which runs fastest wins the wager  This is reckoned a very polite and fashionable amusement here much more followed by the nobility than partridge fighting at Java or paper kites in Madagascar several of the great here I am told understand as much of farriery as their grooms and a horse with any share of merit can never want a patron among the nobility  We have a description of this entertainment almost every day in some of the gazettes as for instance  "On such a day the Give and Take Plate was run for between his Grace's Crab his Lordship's Periwinkle and 'Squire Smackem's Slamerkin All rode their own horses There was the greatest concourse of nobility that has been known here for several seasons The odds were in favour of Crab in the beginning but Slamerkin after the first heat seemed to have the match hollow however it was soon seen that Periwinkle improved in wind which at last turned out accordingly Crab was run to a stand still Slamerkin was knocked up and Periwinkle was brought in with universal applause"  Thus you see Periwinkle received universal applause and no doubt his Lordship came in for some share of that praise which was so liberally bestowed upon Periwinkle Sun of China how glorious must the Senator appear in his cap and leather breeches his whip crossed in his mouth and thus coming to the goal amongst the shouts of grooms jockies pimps stablebred Dukes and degraded Generals  From the description of this princely amusement now transcribed and from the great veneration I have for the characters of its principal promoters I make no doubt but I shall look upon an horserace with becoming reverence predisposed as I am by a similar amusement of which I have lately been a spectator for just now I happened to have an opportunity of being present at a Cartrace  Whether this contention between three carts of different parishes was promoted by a subscription among the nobility or whether the grand jury in council assembled had gloriously combined to encourage plaustral merit I cannot take upon me to determine but certain it is the whole was conducted with the utmost regularity and decorum and the company which made a brilliant appearance were universally of opinion that the sport was high the running fine and the riders influenced by no bribe  It was run on the road from London to a village called Brentford between a turnip cart a dust cart and a dung cart each of the owners condescending to mount and be his own driver The odds at starting were  dust  against  dung  five to four but after half a miles going the knowing ones found themselves all on the wrong side and it was  turnip  against the field brass to silver  Soon however the contest became more doubtful Turnip indeed kept the way but it was perceived that Dung had better bottom The road reecchoed with the shouts of the spectators Dung against Turnip Turnip against Dung was now the universal cry neck and neck one rode lighter  but the other had more judgment I could not but particularly observe the ardour with which the fair sex espoused the cause of the different riders on this occasion one was charmed with the unwashed beauties of Dung another was captivated with the patibulary aspect of Turnip while in the mean time unfortunate gloomy Dust who came whipping behind was cheared by the encouragements of some and pity of all  The contention now continued for some time without a possibility of determining to whom victory designed the prize The winning post appeared in view and he who drove the turnip cart assured himself of success and successful he might have been had his horse been as ambitious as he but upon approaching a turn from the road which led homewards the horse fairly stood still and refused to move a foot farther The dung cart had scarce time to enjoy this temporary triumph when it was pitched headlong into a ditch by the way side and the rider left to wallow in congenial mud Dust in the mean time soon came up and not being far from the post came in amidst the shouts and acclamations of all the spectators and greatly caressed by all the quality of Brentford Fortune was kind only to one who ought to have been favourable to all each had peculiar merit each laboured hard to earn the prize and each richly deserved the cart he drove  I do not know whether this description may not have anticipated that which I intended giving of Newmarket I am told there is little else to be seen even there There may be some minute differences in the dress of the spectators but none at  all in their understandings the quality of Brentford are as remarkable for politeness and delicacy as the breeders of Newmarket The quality of Brentford drive their own carts and the honourable fraternity of Newmarket ride their own horses In short the matches in one place are as rational as those in the other and it is more than probable that turnips dust and dung are all that can be found to furnish out description in either  Forgive me my friend but a person like me bred up in a philosophic seclusion is apt to regard perhaps with too much asperity those occurrences which sink man below his station in nature and diminish the intrinsic value of humanity  LETTER LXXXIV  From Fum Hoam to Lien Chi Altangi  YOU tell me the people of Europe are wise but where lies their wisdom You say they are valiant too yet I have some reasons to doubt of their valour They are engaged in war among each other yet apply to the Russians their neighbours and ours for assistance Cultivating such an alliance argues at once imprudence and timidity All subsidies paid for such an aid is strengthening the Russians already too powerful and weakening the employers already exhausted by intestine commotions  I cannot avoid beholding the Russian empire as the natural enemy of the more western parts of  Europe as an enemy already possessed of great strength and from the nature of the government every day threatening to become more powerful This extensive empire which both in Europe and Asia occupies almost a third of the old world was about two centuries ago divided into separate kingdoms and dukedoms and from such a division consequently feeble Since the times however of Johan Basilides it has encreased in strength and extent and those untrodden forests those innumerable savage animals which formerly covered the face of the country are now removed and colonies of mankind planted in their room A kingdom thus enjoying peace internally possessed of an unbounded extent of dominion and learning the military art at the expence of others abroad must every day grow more powerful and it is probable we shall hear Russia in future times as formerly called the Officina Gentium  It was long the wish of Peter their great monarch to have a fort in some of the western parts of Europe many of his schemes and treaties were directed to this end but happily for Europe he failed in them all A fort in the power of this people would be like the possession of a floodgate and whenever ambition interest or necessity prompted they might then be able to deluge the whole western world with a barbarous inundation  Believe me my friend I cannot sufficiently contemn the politics of Europe who thus make this powerful people arbitrators in their quarrel The Russians are now at that period between refinement and barbarity which seems most adapted to military atchievement and if once they happen  to get footing in the western parts of Europe it is not the feeble efforts of the sons of effeminacy and dissention that can serve to remove them The fertile valley and soft climate will ever be sufficient inducements to draw whole myriads from their native desarts the trackless wild or snowy mountain  History experience reason nature expand the book of wisdom before the eyes of mankind but they will not read We have seen with terror a winged phalanx of famished locusts each singly contemptible but from multitude become hideous cover like clouds the face of day and threaten the whole world with ruin We have seen them settling on the fertile plains of India and Egypt destroying in an instant the labours and the hopes of nations sparing neither the fruit of the earth nor the verdure of the fields and changing into a frightful desert landscapes of once luxuriant beauty We have seen myriads of ants issuing together from the southern desert like a torrent whose source was inexhaustible succeeding each other without end and renewing their destroyed forces with unwearied perseverance bringing desolation wherever they came banishing men and animals and when destitute of all subsistence in heaps infecting the wilderness which they had made Like these have been the migrations of men When as yet savage and almost resembling their brute partners in the forest subject like them only to the instincts of nature and directed by hunger alone in the choice of an abode how have we seen whole armies starting wild at once from their forests and their dens Goths Huns Vandals Saracens Turks Tartars myriads of men  animals in human form without country without name without laws outpowering by numbers all opposition ravaging cities overturning empires and after having destroyed whole nations and spread extensive desolation how have we seen them sink oppressed by some new enemy more barbarous and even more unknown than they  Adieu  LETTER LXXXV  From Lien Chi Altangi to Fum Hoam first president of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin in China  AS the instruction of the fair sex in this country is entirely committed to the care of foreigners as their languagemasters musicmasters hairfrizzers and governesses are all from abroad I had some intentions of opening a female academy myself and made no doubt as I was quite a foreigner of meeting a favourable reception  In this I intended to instruct the ladies in all the conjugal mysteries wives should be taught the art of managing husbands and maids the skill of properly chusing them I would teach a wife how far she might venture to be sick without giving disgust she should be acquainted with the great benefits of the cholic in the stomach and all the thoroughbred insolence of fashion maids should learn the secret of nicely distinguishing every competitor they should be able to know the difference between a pedant and a scholar a citizen and a prig a squire and his horse a beau and his  monkey but chiefly they should be taught the art of managing their smiles from the contemptuous simper to the long laborious laugh  But I have discontinued the project for what would signify teaching ladies the manner of governing or chusing husbands when marriage is at present so much out of fashion that a lady is very well off who can get any husband at all Celibacy now prevails in every rank of life the streets are crouded with old bachelors and the houses with ladies who have refused good offers and are never likely to receive any for the future  The only advice therefore I could give the fair sex as things stand at present is to get husbands as fast as they can There is certainly nothing in the whole creation not even Babylon in ruins more truly deplorable than a lady in the virgin bloom of sixtythree or a battered unmarried beau who squibs about from place to place shewing his pigtail wig and his ears The one appears to my imagination in the form of a double nightcap or a roll of pomatum the other in the shape of an electuary or a box of pills  I would once more therefore advise the ladies to get husbands I would desire them not to discard an old lover without very sufficient reasons nor treat the new with illnature till they know him false let not prudes alledge the falseness of the sex coquets the pleasures of long courtship or parents the necessary preliminaries of penny for penny I have reasons that would silence even a casuist in this particular In the first place therefore I divide the subject into fifteen heads  and then  sic argumentor  but not to give you and myself the spleen be contented at present with an Indian tale  In a winding of the river Amidar just before it falls into the Caspian sea there lies an island unfrequented by the inhabitants of the Continent In this seclusion blest with all that wild uncultivated nature could bestow lived a princess and her two daughters She had been wrecked upon the coast while her children as yet were infants who of consequence though grown up were entirely unacquainted with man Yet unexperienced as the young ladies were in the opposite sex both early discovered symptoms the one of prudery the other of being a coquet The eldest was ever learning maxims of wisdom and discretion from her mamma while the youngest employed all her hours in gazing at her own face in a neighbouring fountain  Their usual amusement in this solitude was fishing Their mother had taught them all the secrets of the art she shewed them which were the most likely places to throw out the line what baits were most proper for the various seasons and the best manner to draw up the finny prey when they had hooked it In this manner they spent their time easy and innocent till one day the Princess being indisposed desired them to go and catch her a sturgeon or a shark for supper which she fancied might sit easy on her stomach The daughters obeyed and clapping on a gold fish the usual bait on those occasions went and sat upon one of the rocks letting the gilded hook glide down with the stream  On the opposite shore farther down at the mouth of the river lived a diver for pearls a youth who by long habit in his trade was almost grown amphibious so that he could remain whole hours at the bottom of the water without ever fetching breath He happened to be at that very instant diving when the ladies were fishing with the gilded hook Seeing therefore the bait which to him had the appearance of real gold he was resolved to seize the prize but both his hands being already filled with pearl oysters he found himself obliged to snap at it with his mouth The consequence is easily imagined the hook before unperceived was instantly fastened in his jaw nor could he with all his efforts or his floundering get free  "Sister cries the youngest Princess I have certainly caught a monstrous fish I never perceived any thing struggle so at the end of my line before come and help me to draw it in" They both now therefore assisted in fishing up the Diver on shore but nothing could equal their surprize upon seeing him "Bless my eyes cries the prude what have we got here this is a very odd fish to be sure I never saw any thing in my life look so queer what eyes what terrible claws what a monstrous snout I have read of this monster somewhere before it certainly must be a  Tanlang  that eats women let us throw it back into the sea where we found it  The Diver in the mean time stood upon the beach at the end of the line with the hook in his mouth using every art that he thought could best excite pity and particularly looking extremely tender which is usual in such circumstances The  coquet therefore in some measure influenced by the innocence of his looks ventured to contradict her companion "Upon my word sister says she I see nothing in the animal so very terrible as you are pleased to apprehend I think it may serve well enough for a change Always sharks and sturgeons and lobsters and crawfish make me quite sick I fancy a slice of this nicely grilladed and dressed up with shrimp sauce would be very pretty eating I fancy mamma would like a bit with pickles above all things in the world and if it should not sit easy on her stomach it will be time enough to discontinue it when found disagreeable you know" "Horrid cries the prude would the girl be poisoned I tell you it is a  Tanlang  I have read of it in twenty places It is every where described as the most pernicious animal that ever infested the ocean I am certain it is the most insidious ravenous creature in the world and is certain destruction if taken internally" The youngest sister was now therefore obliged to submit both assisted in drawing the hook with some violence from the Diver's jaw and he finding himself at liberty bent his breast against the broad wave and disappeared in an instant  Just at this juncture the mother came down to the beach to know the cause of her daughter's delay they told her every circumstance describing the monster they had caught The old lady was one of the most discreet women in the world she was called the blackeyed Princess from two black eyes she had received in her youth being a little addicted to boxing in her liquor "Alas my children cries she what have you done the fish you caught was a manfish one of the most  tame domestic animals in the world We could have let him run and play about the garden and he would have been twenty times more entertaining than our squirrel or monkey If that be all says the young coquet we will fish for him again If that be all I'll hold three toothpicks to one pound of snuff I catch him whenever I please" Accordingly they threw in their line once more but with all their gilding and padling and assiduity they could never after catch the Diver In this state of solitude and disappointment they continued for many years still fishing but without success till at last the genius of the place in pity to their distresses changed the prude into a shrimp and the coquet into an oyster  Adieu  LETTER LXXXVI  From the same  I AM amused my dear Fum with the labours of some of the learned here One shall write you a whole folio on the direction of a caterpillar Another shall swell his works with a description of the plumage on the wing of a butterfly a third shall see a little world on a peach leaf and publish a book to describe what his readers might see more clearly in two minutes only by being furnished with eyes and a microscope  I have frequently compared the understandings of such men to their own glasses Their field of vision is too contracted to take in the whole of any  but minute objects they view all nature bit by bit now the proboscis now the antennae now the pinnae ofa flea Now the polypus comes to breakfast upon a worm now it is kept up to see how long it will live without eating now it is turned inside outward and now it sickens and dies Thus they proceed laborious in trifles constant in experiment without one single abstraction by which alone knowledge may be properly said to encrease till at last their ideas ever employed upon minute things contract to the size of the diminutive object and a single mite shall fill their whole mind's capacity  Yet believe me my friend ridiculous as these men are to the world they are set up as objects of esteem for each other They have particular places appointed for their meetings in which one shews his cockleshell and is praised by all the society another produces his powder makes some experiments that result in nothing and comes off with admiration and applause a third comes out with the important discovery of some new process in the skeleton of a mole and is set down as the accurate and sensible while one still more fortunate than the rest by pickling potting and preserving monsters rises into unbounded reputation  The labours of such men instead of being calculated to amuse the public are laid out only in diverting each other The world becomes very little the better or the wiser for knowing what is the peculiar food of an insect that is itself the food of another which in its turn is eaten by a third but there are men who have studied themselves into an habit of investigating and admiring such minutiae To these such subjects are pleasing as  there are some who contentedly spend whole days in endeavouring to solve aenigmas or disentangle the puzzling sticks of children  But of all the learned those who pretend to investigate remote antiquity have least to plead in their own defence when they carry this passion to a faulty excess They are generally found to supply by conjecture the want of record and then by perseverance are wrought up into a confidence of the truth of opinions which even to themselves at first appeared founded only in imagination  The Europeans have heard much of the kingdom of China its politeness arts commerce laws and morals are however but very imperfectly known among them They have even now in their Indian warehouse numberless utensils plants minerals and machines of the use of which they are intirely ignorant nor can any among them even make a probable guess for what they might have been designed Yet though this people be so ignorant of the present real state of China the philosophers I am describing have entered into long learned laborious disputes about what China was two thousand years ago China and European happiness are but little connected even at this day but European happiness and China two thousand years ago have certainly no connection at all However the learned have written on and pursued the subject thro' all the labyrinths of antiquity though the early dews and the tainted gale be passed away though no footsteps remain to direct the doubtful chace yet still they run forward open upon the uncertain scent and though in fact they follow nothing are earnest in the pursuit In this chace however they  all take different ways One for example confidently assures us that China was peopled by a colony from Egypt Sesostris he observes led his army as far as the Ganges therefore if he went so far he might still have gone as far as China which is but about a thousand miles from thence therefore he did go to China therefore China was not peopled before he went there therefore it was peopled by him Besides the Egyptians have pyramids the Chinese have in like manner their porcelaine tower the Egyptians used to light up candles upon every rejoicing the Chinese have lanthorns upon the same occasion the Egyptians had their great river so have the Chinese but what serves to put the matter past a doubt is that the antient Kings of China and those of Egypt were called by the same names The Emperor Ki is certainly the same with King Atoes for if we only change  K  into  A  and  i  into  toes  we shall have the name Atoes and with equal ease  Menes  may be proved to be the same with the Emperor  Yu  therefore the Chinese are a colony from Egypt  But another of the learned is entirely different from the last and he will have the Chinese to be a colony planted by Noah just after the deluge First from the vast similitude there is between the name of Fohi the founder of the Chinese monarchy and that of Noah the preserver of the human race Noah Fohi very like each other truly they have each but four letters and only two of the four happen to differ But to strengthen the argument Fohi as the Chinese chronicle asserts had no father Noah it is true had a father as the European Bible tells us but then as this father was probably drowned in the flood it is just the  same as if he had no father at all therefore Noah and Fohi are the same Just after the flood the earth was covered with mud if it was covered with mud it must have been incrustated mud if it was incrustated it was cloathed with verdure this was a fine unembarrassed road for Noah to fly from his wicked children he therefore did fly from them and took a journey of two thousand miles for his own amusement therefore Noah and Fohi are the same  Another sect of literati for they all pass among the vulgar for very great scholars assert that the Chinese came neither from the colony of Sesostris nor from Noah but are descended from Magog Meshec and Tubal and therefore neither Sesostris nor Noah nor Fohi are the same  It is thus my friend that indolence assumes the airs of wisdom and while it tosses the cup and ball with infantine folly desires the world to look on and calls the stupid pastime philosophy and learning Adieu  LETTER LXXXVII  From the same  WHEN the men of this country are once turned of thirty they regularly retire every year at proper intervals to lie in of the  spleen  The vulgar unfurnished with the luxurious comforts of the soft cussion down bed and easy chair are obliged when the fit is on them to nurse it up by drinking idleness and illhumour In such  dispositions unhappy is the foreigner who happens to cross them his long chin tarnished coat or pinched hat are sure to receive no quarter If they meet no foreigner however to fight with they are in such cases generally content with beating each other  The rich as they have more sensibility are operated upon with greater violence by this disorder Different from the poor instead of becoming more insolent they grow totally unfit for opposition A general here who would have faced a culverin when well if the fit be on him shall hardly find courage to snuff a candle An admiral who could have opposed a broadside without shrinking shall sit whole days in his chamber mobbed up in double nightcaps shuddering at the intrusive breeze and distinguishable from his wife only by his black beard and heavy eyebrows  In the country this disorder mostly attacks the fair sex in town it is most unfavourable to the men A lady who has pined whole years amidst cooing doves and complaining nightingales in rural retirement shall resume all her vivacity in one night at a city gamingtable her husband who roar'd hunted and got drunk at home shall grow splenetic in town in proportion to his wife's good humour Upon their arrival in London they exchange their disorders In consequence of her parties and excursions he puts on the furred cap and scarlet stomacher and perfectly resembles an Indian husband who when his wife is safely delivered permits her to transact business abroad while he undergoes all the formality of keeping his bed and receiving all the condolence in her place  But those who reside constantly in town owe this disorder mostly to the influence of the weather It is impossible to describe what a variety of transmutations an east wind shall produce it has been known to change a Lady of fashion into a parlour couch an Alderman into a plate of custards and a dispenser of justice into a rat trap Even Philosophers themselves are not exempt from its influence it has often converted a Poet into a coral and bells and a patriot Senator into a dumb waiter  Some days ago I went to visit the man in black and entered his house with that chearfulness which the certainty of a favourable reception always inspires Upon opening the door of his apartment I found him with the most rueful face imaginable in a morning gown and flannel nightcap earnestly employed in learning to blow the German flute Struck with the absurdity of a man in the decline of life thus blowing away all his constitution and spirits even without the consolation of being musical I ventured to ask what could induce him to attempt learning so difficult an instrument so late in life To this he made no reply but groaning and still holding the flute to his lip continued to gaze at me for some moments very angrily and then proceeded to practise his gammut as before After having produced a variety of the most hideous tones in nature at last turning to me he demanded whether I did not think he had made a surprizing progress in two days You see continues he I have got the Ambusheer already and as for fingering my master tells me I shall have that in a few lessons more I was so much astonished with this instance of inverted ambition that I know not what to reply  but soon discerned the cause of all his absurdities my friend was under a metamorphosis by the power of spleen and fluteblowing was unluckily become his adventitious passion  In order therefore to banish his anxiety imperceptibly by seeming to indulge it I began to descant on those gloomy topics by which Philosophers often get rid of their own spleen by communicating it the wretchedness of a man in this life the happiness of some wrought out of the miseries of others the necessity that wretches should expire under punishment that rogues might enjoy affluence in tranquility I led him on from the inhumanity of the rich to the ingratitude of the beggar from the insincerity of refinement to the fierceness of rusticity and at last had the good fortune to restore him to his usual serenity of temper by permitting him to expatiate upon all the modes of human misery  'Some nights ago says my friend sitting alone by my fire I happened to look into an account of the detection of a set of men called the thieftakers I read over the many hideous cruelties of those haters of mankind of their pretended friendship to wretches they meant to betray of their sending men out to rob and then hanging them I could not avoid sometimes interrupting the narrative by crying out  Yet these are men  As I went on I was informed that they had lived by this practice several years and had been enriched by the price of blood  and yet  cried I  I have been sent into this world and am desired to call these men my broth  rs  I read that the very man who led the condemned wretch to the gallows was he who falsely swore his life away  and yet  continued I  that perjurer had  just such a nose such lips such hands and such eyes as Newton  I at last came to the account of the wretch that was searched after robbing one of the thieftakers of half a crown Those of the confederacy knew that he had got but that single half crown in the world after a long search therefore which they knew would be fruitless and taking from him the half crown which they knew was all he had one of the gang compassionately cried out  Alas poor a creature let him keep all the rest he has got it will do him service in Newgate where we are sending him  This was an instance of such complicated guilt and hypocrisy that I threw down the book in an agony of rage and began to think with malice of all the human kind I sat silent for some minutes and soon perceiving the ticking of my watch beginning to grow noisy and troublesome I quickly placed it out of hearing and strove to resume my serenity But the watchman soon gave me a second alarm I had scarcely recovered from this when my peace was assaulted by the wind at my window and when that ceased to blow I listened for deathwatches in the wainscot I now found my whole system discomposed I strove to find a resource in philosophy and reason but what could I oppose or where direct my blow when I could see no enemy to combat I saw no misery approaching nor knew any I had to fear yet still I was miserable Morning came I sought for tranquility in dissipation sauntered from one place of public resort to another but found myself disagreeable to my acquaintance and ridiculous to others I tried at different times dancing fencing and riding I solved geometrical problems shaped tobaccostoppers wrote verses and cut paper At last I placed my affections  on music and find that earnest employment if cannot cure at least will palliate every anxiety  Adieu  LETTER LXXXVIII  From the same  IT is no unpleasing contemplation to consider the influence which soil and climate have upon the disposition of the inhabitants the animals and vegetables of different countries That among the brute creation is much more visible than in man and that in vegetables more than either In some places those plants which are entirely poisonous at home lose their deleterious quality by being carried abroad there are serpents in Macedonia so harmless as to be used as playthings for children and we are told that in some parts of Fez there are lions so very timorous as to be scared away though coming in herds by the cries of women  I know of no country where the influence of climate and soil is more visible than in England the same hidden cause which gives courage to their dogs and cocks gives also fierceness to their men But chiefly this ferocity appears among the vulgar The polite of every country pretty nearly resemble each other But as in simpleing it is among the uncultivated productions of nature we are to examine the characteristic differences of climate and soil so in an estimate of the genius of the people we must look among the sons of unpolished rusticity The vulgar English therefore may be easily distinguished from all the rest  of the world by superior pride impatience and a peculiar hardiness of soul  Perhaps no qualities in the world are more susceptible of a fine polish than these artificial complaisance and easy deference being superinduced over these generally forms a great character something at once elegant and majestic affable yet sincere Such in general are the better sort but they who are left in primitive rudeness are the least disposed for society with others or comfort internally of any people under the sun  The poor indeed of every country are but little prone to treat each other with tenderness their own miseries are too apt to engross all their pity and perhaps too they give but little commiseration as they find but little from others But in England the poor treat each other upon every occasion with more than savage animosity and as if they were in a state of open war by nature In China if two porters should meet in a narrow street they would lay down their burthens make a thousand excuses to each other for the accidental interruption and beg pardon on their knees if two men of the same occupation should meet here they would first begin to scold and at last to beat each other One would think they had miseries enough resulting from penury and labour not to encrease them by illnature among themselves and subjection to new penalties but such considerations never weigh with them  But to recompence this strange absurdity they are in the main generous brave and enterprising They feel the slightest injuries with a degree of ungoverned impatience but resist the greatest calamities with surprizing fortitude Those miseries  under which any other people in the world would sink they have often shewed they were capable of enduring if accidentally cast upon some desolate coast their perseverance is beyond what any other nation is capable of sustaining if imprisoned for crimes their efforts to escape are greater than among others The peculiar strength of their prisons when compared to those elsewhere argues their hardiness even the strongest prisons I have ever seen in other countries would be very insufficient to confine the untameable spirit of an Englishman In short what man dares do in circumstances of danger an Englishman will His virtues seem to sleep in the calm and are called out only to combat the kindred storm  But the greatest eulogy of this people is the generosity of their miscreants the tenderness in general of their robbers and highwaymen Perhaps no people can produce instances of the same kind where the desperate mix pity with injustice still shew that they understand a distinction in crimes and even in acts of violence have still some tincture of remaining virtue In every other country robbery and murder go almost always together here it seldom happens except upon illjudged resistance or pursuit The banditti of other countries are unmerciful to a supreme degree the highwayman and robber here are generous at least to the public and pretend even to virtues in their intercourse among each other Taking therefore my opinion of the English from the virtues and vices practised among the vulgar they at once present to a stranger all their faults and keep their virtues up only for the enquiring eye of a philosopher  Foreigners are generally shocked at their insolence upon first coming among them they find themselves ridiculed and insulted in every street they meet with none of those trifling civilities so frequent elsewhere which are instances of mutual goodwill without previous acquaintance they travel through the country either too ignorant or too obstinate to cultivate a closer acquaintance meet every moment something to excite their disgust and return home to characterise this as the region of spleen insolence and illnature In short England would be the last place in the world I would travel to by way of amusement but the first for instruction I would chuse to have others for my acquaintance but Englishmen for my friends  LETTER LXXXIX  To the same  THE mind is ever ingenious in making its own distress The wandering beggar who has none to protect to feed or to shelter him fancies complete happiness in labour and a full meal take him from rags and want feed cloath and employ him his wishes now rise one step above his station he could be happy were he possessed of raiment food and ease Suppose his wishes gratified even in these his prospects widen as he ascends he finds himself in affluence and tranquillity indeed but indolence soon breeds anxiety and he desires not only to be freed from pain but to be possessed of pleasure pleasure is granted him and this but opens his soul to ambition and  ambition will be sure to taint his future happiness either with jealousy disappointment or fatigue  But of all the arts of distress found out by man for his own torment perhaps that of philosophic misery is most truly ridiculous a passion no where carried to so extravagant an excess as in the country where I now reside It is not enough to engage all the compassion of a philosopher here that his own globe is harassed with wars pestilence or barbarity he shall grieve for the inhabitants of the moon if the situation of her imaginary mountains happens to alter and dread the extinction of the sun if the spots on his surface happen to encrease one should imagine that philosophy was introduced to make men happy but here it serves to make hundreds miserable  My landlady some days ago brought me the diary of a philosopher of this desponding sort who had lodged in the apartment before me It contains the history of a life which seems to be one continued tissue of sorrow apprehension and distress A single week will serve as a specimen of the whole  Monday  In what a transient decaying situation are we placed and what various reasons does philosophy furnish to make mankind unhappy A single grain of mustard shall continue to produce its similitude through numberless successions yet what has been granted to this little seed has been denied to our planetary system the mustardseed is still unaltered but the system is growing old and must quickly fall to decay How terrible will it be when the motions of all the  planets have at last become so irregular as to need repairing when the moon shall fall into frightful paroxysms of alteration when the earth deviating from its ancient track and with every other planet forgetting its circular revolutions shall become so eccentric that unconfined by the laws of system it shall fly off into boundless space to knock against some distant world or fall in upon the sun either extinguishing his light or burned up by his flames in a moment Perhaps while I write this dreadful change is begun Shield me from universal ruin Yet ideot man laughs sings and rejoices in the very face of the sun and seems no way touched with his situation  Tuesday  Went to bed in great distress awaked and was comforted by considering that this change was to happen at some indefinite time and therefore like death the thoughts of it might easily be borne But there is a revolution a fixed determined revolution which must certainly come to pass yet which by good fortune I shall never feel except in my posterity The obliquity of the equator with the ecliptic is now twenty minutes less than when it was observed two thousand years ago by  Piteas  If this be the case in six thousand the obliquity will be still less by an whole degree This being supposed it is evident that our earth as Louville has clearly proved has a motion by which the climates must necessarily change place and in the space of about one million of years England shall actually travel to the Antarctic pole I shudder at the change How shall our unhappy grandchildren endure the hideous climate A million of years will soon be accomplished they are but a moment when compared  to eternity then shall our charming country as I may say in a moment of time resemble the hideous wilderness of Nova Zembla  Wednesday  To night by my calculation the long predicted comet is to make its first appearance Heavens what terrors are impending over our little dim speck of earth Dreadful visitation Are we to be scorched in its fires or only smothered in the vapour of its tail That is the question Thoughtless mortals go build houses plant orchards purchase estates for tomorrow you die But what if the comet should not come That would be equally fatal Comets are servants which periodically return to supply the sun with fuel If our sun therefore should be disappointed of the expected supply and all his fuel be in the mean time burnt out he must expire like an exhausted taper What a miserable situation must our earth be in without his enlivening ray Have we not seen several neighbouring suns entirely disappear Has not a fixed star near the tail of the Ram lately been quite extinguished  Thursday  The comet has not yet appeared I am sorry for it first sorry because my calculation is false secondly sorry lest the sun should want fuel thirdly sorry lest the wits should laugh at our erroneous predictions and fourthly sorry because if it appears to night it must necessarily come within the sphere of the earth's attraction and heaven help the unhappy country on which it happens to fall  Friday  Our whole society have been out all eager in search of the comet We have seen not less  than sixteen comets in different parts of the heavens However we are unanimously resolved to fix upon one only to be the comet expected That near Virgo wants nothing but a tail to fit it out completely for terrestrial admiration  Saturday  The moon is I find at her old pranks Her appulses librations and other irregularities indeed amaze me My daughter too is this morning gone off with a grenadier No way surprizing I was never able to give her a relish for wisdom She ever promised to be a mere expletive in the creation But the moon the moon gives me real uneasiness I fondly fancied I had fixed her I had thought her constant and constant only to me but every night discovers her infidelity and proves me a desolate and abandoned lover  Adieu  LETTER XC  To the same  IT is surprizing what an influence titles shall have upon the mind even though these titles be of our own making Like children we dress up the puppets in finery and then stand in astonishment at the plastic wonder I have been told of a rat catcher here who strolled for a long time about the villages near town without finding any employment at last however he thought proper to take the title of his Majesty's Rat catcher in ordinary and this succeeded beyond his expectations when it was known that he caught rats at  court all were ready to give him countenance and employment  But of all the people they who make books seem most perfectly sensible of the advantage of titular dignity All seem convinced that a book written by vulgar hands can neither instruct nor improve none but Kings Chams and Mandarines can write with any probability of success If the titles inform me right not only Kings and Courtiers but Emperors themselves in this country periodically supply the press  A man here who should write and honestly confess that he wrote for bread might as well send his manuscript to fire the baker's oven not one creature will read him all must be courtbred poets or pretend at least to be courtbred who can expect to please Should the caitiff fairly avow a design of emptying our pockets and filling his own every reader would instantly forsake him even those who write for bread themselves would combine to worry him perfectly sensible that his attempts only served to take the bread out of their mouths  And yet this silly prepossession the more amazes me when I consider that almost all the excellent productions in wit that have appeared here were purely the offspring of necessity their Drydens Butlers Otways and Farquhars were all writers for bread Believe me my friend hunger has a most amazing faculty of sharpening the genius and he who with a full belly can think like a hero after a course of fasting shall rise to the sublimity of a demigod  But what will most amaze is that this very set of men who are now so much depreciated by fools are however the very best writers they have among them at present For my own part were I to buy an hat I would not have it from a stockingmaker but an hatter were I to buy shoes I should not go to the taylor's for that purpose It is just so with regard to wit did I for my life desire to be well served I would apply only to those who made it their trade and lived by it You smile at the oddity of my opinion but be assured my friend that wit is in some measure mechanical and that a man long habituated to catch at even its resemblance will at last be happy enough to possess the substance by a long habit of writing he acquires a justness of thinking and a mastery of manner which holidaywriters even with ten times his genius may vainly attempt to equal  How then are they deceived who expect from title dignity and exterior circumstance an excellence which is in some measure acquired by habit and sharpened by necessity you have seen like me many literary reputations promoted by the influence of fashion which have scarce survived the possessor you have seen the poor hardly earn the little reputation they acquired and their merit only acknowledged when they were incapable of enjoying the pleasures of popularity such however is the reputation worth possessing that which is hardly earned is hardly lost  Adieu  LETTER XCI  From Hingpo in Moscow to Lien Chi Altangi in London  WHERE will my disappointments end Must I still be doomed to accuse the severity of my fortune and shew my constancy in distress rather than moderation in prosperity I had at least hopes of conveying my charming companion safe from the reach of every enemy and of again restoring her to her native soil But those hopes are now no more  Upon leaving Terki we took the nearest road to the dominions of Russia We passed the Ural mountains covered in eternal snow and traversed the forests of Ufa where the prowling bear and shrieking hyena keep an undisputed possession We next embarked upon the rapid river Bulija and made the best of our way to the banks of the Wolga where it waters the fruitful valleys of Casan  There were two vessels in company properly equipped and armed in order to oppose the Wolga pyrates who we were informed infested this river Of all mankind these pyrates are the most terrible They are composed of the criminals and outlawed peasants of Russia who fly to the forests that lie along the banks of the Wolga for protection Here they join in parties lead a savage life and have no other subsistence but plunder Being deprived of houses friends or a fixed habitation they become more terrible even than the tyger and as insensible  to all the feelings of humanity They neither give quarter to those they conquer nor receive it when overpowered themselves The severity of the laws against them serve to encrease their barbarity and seem to make them a neutral species of beings between the wildness of the lion and the subtilty of the man When taken alive their punishment is hideous A floating gibbet is erected which is let run down with the stream here upon an iron hook stuck under their ribs and upon which the whole weight of their body depends they are left to expire in the most terrible agonies some being thus found to linger several days successively  We were but three days voyage from the confluence of this river into the Wolga when we perceived at a distance behind us an armed barque coming up with the assistance of sails and oars in order to attack us The dreadful signal of death was hung upon the mast and our captain with his glass could easily discern them to be pyrates It is impossible to express our consternation on this occasion the whole crew instantly came together to consult the properest means of safety It was therefore soon determined to send off our women and valuable commodities in one of our vessels and that the men should stay in the other and boldly oppose the enemy This resolution was soon put into execution and I now reluctantly parted from the beautiful Zelis for the first time since our retreat from Persia The vessel in which she was disappeared to my longing eyes in proportion as that of the pyrates approached us They soon came up but upon examining our strength and perhaps sensible of the manner in which we  had sent off our most valuable effects they seemed more eager to pursue the vessel we had sent away than attack us In this manner they continued to harrass us for three days still endeavouring to pass us without fighting But on the fourth day finding it entirely impossible and despairing to seize the expected booty they desisted from their endeavours and left us to pursue our voyage without interruption  Our joy on this occasion was great but soon a disappointment more terrible because unexpected succeeded The barque in which our women and treasure were sent off was wrecked upon the banks of the Wolga for want of a proper number of hands to manage her and the whole crew carried by the peasants up the country Of this however we were not sensible till our arrival at Moscow where expecting to meet our separated barque we were informed of its misfortune and our loss Need I paint the situation of my mind on this occasion Need I describe all I feel when I despair of beholding the beautiful Zelis more Fancy had dressed the future prospect of my life in the gayest colouring but one unexpected stroke of fortune has robbed it of every charm Her dear idea mixes with every scene of pleasure and without her presence to enliven it the whole becomes tedious insipid insupportable I will confess now that she is lost I will confess I loved her nor is it in the power of time or of reason to erase her image from my heart  Adieu  LETTER XCII  From Lien Chi Altangi to Hingpo at Moscow  This letter is a rhapsody from the Maxims of the philosopher Mé Vide Lett curieuse edifiant Vide etiam Du Halde vol ii p    YOUR misfortunes are mine But as every period of life is marked with its own you must learn to endure them Disappointed love makes the misery of youth disappointed ambition that of manhood and successless avarice that of age These three attack us through life and it is our duty to stand upon our guard To love we ought to oppose dissipation and endeavour to change the object of the affections to ambition the happiness of indolence and obscurity and to avarice the fear of soon dying These are the shields with which we should arm ourselves and thus make every scene of life if not pleasing at least supportable  Men complain of not finding a place of repose They are in the wrong they have it for seeking What they should indeed complain of is that the heart is an enemy to that very repose they seek To themselves alone should they impute their discontent They seek within the short span of life to satisfy a thousand desires each of which alone is unsatiable One month passes and another comes on the year ends and then begins but man is still unchanging in folly still blindly continuing in prejudice To the wise man every climate and every soil is pleasing to him a parterre of flowers is the famous valley of gold to him a little brook  the fountain of the young peachtrees  This passage the editor does not understand  to such a man the melody of birds is more ravishing than the harmony of a full concert and the tincture of the cloud preferable to the touch of the finest pencil  The life of man is a journey a journey that must be travelled however bad the roads or the accommodation If in the beginning it is found dangerous narrow and difficult it must either grow better in the end or we shall by custom learn to bear its inequality  But though I see you incapable of penetrating into grand principles attend at least to a simile adapted to every apprehension I am mounted upon a wretched ass I see another man before me upon a sprightly horse at which I find some uneasiness I look behind me and see numbers on foot stooping under heavy burdens let me learn to pity their estate and thank heaven for my own  Shingfu when under misfortunes would in the beginning weep like a child but he soon recovered his former tranquility After indulging grief for a few days he would become as usual the most merry old man in all the province of Shansi About the time that his wife died his possessions were all consumed by fire and his only son sold into captivity Shingfu grieved for one day and the next went to dance at a Mandarine's door for his dinner The company were surprised to see the old man so merry when suffering such great losses and the Mandarine himself coming out asked him how  he who had grieved so much and given way to the calamity the day before could now be so chearful "You ask me one question cries the old man let me answer by asking another Which is the most durable a hard thing or a soft thing that which resists or that which makes no resistance"  An hard thing to be sure  replied the Mandarine "There you are wrong returned Shingfu I am now fourscore years old and if you look in my mouth you will find that I have lost all my teeth but not a bit of my tongue"  Adieu  LETTER XCIII  From Lien Chi Altangi to Fum Hoam first president of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin in China  THE manner of grieving for our departed friends in China is very different from that of Europe The mourning colour of Europe is black that of China white When a parent or relation dies here for they seldom mourn for friends it is only clapping on a suit of sables grimacing it for a few days and all soon forgotten goes on as before not a single creature missing the deceased except perhaps a favourite housekeeper or a favourite cat  On the contrary with us in China it is a very serious affair The piety with which I have seen you behave on one of these occasions should never be forgotten I remember it was upon the death of thy grandmother's maiden sister The coffin was  exposed in the principal hall in public view Before it were placed the figures of eunuchs horses tortoises and other animals in attitudes of grief and respect The more distant relations of the old lady and I among the number came to pay our compliments of condolance and to salute the deceased after the manner of our country We had scarce presented our wax candles and perfumes and given the howl of departure when crawling on his belly from under a curtain out came the reverend Fum Hoam himself in all the dismal solemnity of distress Your looks were set for sorrow your cloathing consisted in an hempen bag tied round the neck with a string For two long months did this mourning continue By night you lay stretched on a single mat and sate on the stool of discontent by day Pious man who could thus set an example of sorrow and decorum to our country Pious country where if we do not grieve at the departure of our friends for their sakes at least we are taught to regret them for our own  All is very different here amazement all What sort of a people am I got amongst Fum thou son of Fo what sort of people am I got amongst No crawling round the coffin no dressing up in hempen bags no lying on mats or sitting on stools Gentlemen here shall put on first mourning with as sprightly an air as if preparing for a birthnight and widows shall actually dress for another husband in their weeds for the former The best jest of all is that our merry mourners clap bits of muslin on their sleeves and these are called  weepers  Weeping muslin alas alas very  sorrowful truly These weepers then it seems are to bear the whole burthen of the distress  But I have had the strongest instance of this contrast this tragicomical behaviour in distress upon a recent occasion Their King whose departure though sudden was not unexpected died after a reign of many years His age and uncertain state of health served in some measure to diminish the sorrow of his subjects and their expectations from his successor seemed to balance their minds between uneasiness and satisfaction But how ought they to have behaved on such an occasion Surely they ought rather to have endeavoured to testify their  gratitude  to their deceased friend than to proclaim their  hopes  of the future Sure even the Successor must suppose their love to wear the face of adulation which so quickly changed the object However the very same day on which the old King died they made rejoicing for the new  For my part I have no conception of this new manner of mourning and rejoicing in a breath of being merry and sad of mixing a funeral procession with a jig and a bonfire At least it would have been just that they who flattered the King while living for virtues which he had not should lament him dead for those he really had  In this universal cause for national distress as I had no interest myself so it is but natural to suppose I felt no real affliction In all the losses of our friends says an European philosopher we first consider how much our own welfare is affected by their departure and moderate our real grief just in  the same proportion Now as I had neither received nor expected to receive favours from Kings or their flatterers as I had no acquaintance in particular with their late monarch as I knew that the place of a King is soon supplied and as the Chinese proverb has it that though the world may sometimes want coblers to mend their shoes there is no danger of its wanting Emperors to rule their kingdoms from such considerations I could bear the loss of a King with the most philosophic resignation However I thought it my duty at least to appear sorrowful to put on a melancholy aspect or to set my face by that of the people  The first company I came amongst after the news became general was a set of jolly companions who were drinking prosperity to the ensuing reign I entered the room with looks of despair and even expected applause for the superlative misery of my countenance Instead of that I was universally condemned by the company for a grimacing son of a whore and desired to take away my penitential phyz to some other quarter I now corrected my former mistake and with the most sprightly air imaginable entered a company where they were talking over the ceremonies of the approaching funeral Here I sat for some time with an air of pert vivacity when one of the chief mourners immediately observing my good humour desired me if I pleased to go and grin somewhere else they wanted no disaffected scoundrels there Leaving this company therefore I was resolved to assume a look perfectly neutral and have ever since been studying the fashionable air something between jest and earnest a complete virginity of face uncontaminated with the smallest symptom of meaning  But though grief be a very slight affair here the mourning my friend is a very important concern When an Emperor dies in China the whole expence of the solemnities is defrayed from the royal coffers When the great die here Mandarines are ready enough to order mourning but I do not see that they are so ready to pay for it If they send me down from court the grey undress frock or the black coat without pocket holes I am willing enough to comply with their commands and wear both but by the head of Confucius to be obliged to wear black and buy it into the bargain is more than my tranquility of temper can bear What order me to wear mourning before they know whether I can buy it or no Fum thou son of Fo what sort of a people am I got amongst where being out of black is a certain symptom of poverty where those who have miserable faces cannot have mourning and those who have mourning will not wear a miserable face  LETTER XCIV  From the same  IT is usual for the booksellers here when a book has given universal pleasure upon one subject to bring out several more upon the same plan which are sure to have purchasers and readers from that desire which all men have to view a pleasing object on every side The first performance serves rather to awake than satisfy attention and when that is once moved the slightest effort serves to continue its progression the merit of the first diffuses  a light sufficient to illuminate the succeeding efforts and no other subject can be relished till that is exhausted A stupid work coming thus immediately in the train of an applauded performance weans the mind from the object of its pleasure and resembles the sponge thrust into the month of a discharged culverin in order to adapt it for a new explosion  This manner however of drawing off a subject or a peculiar mode of writing to the dregs effectually precludes a revival of that subject or manner for some time for the future the sated reader turns from it with a kind of literary nausea and though the titles of books are the part of them most read yet he has scarce perseverance enough to wade through the title page  Of this number I own myself one I am now grown callous to several subjects and different kinds of composition whether such originally pleased I will not lake upon me to determine but at present I spurn a new book merely upon seeing its name in an advertisement nor have the smallest curiosity to look beyond the first leaf even though in the second the author promises his own face neatly engraved on copper  I am become a perfect Epicure in reading plain beef or solid mutton will never do I am for a Chinese dish of bear's claws and bird's nests I am for sauce strong with assafoetida or fuming with garlic For this reason there are an hundred very wise learned virtuous wellintended productions that have no charms for me Thus for the soul of me I could never find courage nor  grace enough to wade above two pages deep into  Thoughts upon God and Nature  or  Thoughts upon Providence  or  Thoughts upon Free Grace  or indeed into Thoughts upon any thing at all I can no longer meditate with Meditations for every day in the year Essays upon divers subjects cannot allure me though never so interesting and as for Funeral Sermons or even Thanksgiving Sermons I can neither weep with the one nor rejoice with the other  But it is chiefly in gentle poetry where I seldom look farther than the title The truth is I take up books to be told something new but here as it is now managed the reader is told nothing He opens the book and there finds very good words truly and much exactness of rhyme but no information A parcel of gaudy images pass on before his imagination like the figures in a dream but curiosity induction reason and the whole train of affections are fast asleep The  jocunda et idonea vitae  those sallies which mend the heart while they amuse the fancy are quite forgotten so that a reader who would take up some modern applauded performances of this kind must in order to be pleased first leave his good sense behind him take for his recompence and guide bloated and compound epithet and dwell on paintings just indeed because laboured with minute exactness  If we examine however our internal sensations we shall find ourselves but little pleased with such laboured vanities we shall find that our applause rather proceeds from a kind of contagion caught up from others and which we contribute to diffuse than from what we privately feel There are  some subjects of which almost all the world perceive the futility yet all combine in imposing upon each other as worthy of praise But chiefly this imposition obtains in literature where men publicly contemn what they relish with rapture in private and approve abroad what has given them disgust at home The truth is we deliver those criticisms in public which are supposed to be best calculated not to do justice to the author but to impress others with an opinion of our superior discernment  But let works of this kind which have already come off with such applause enjoy it all It is neither my wish to diminish as I was never considerable enough to add to their fame But for the future I fear there are many poems of which I shall find spirits to read but the title In the first place all odes upon winter or summer or autumn in short all odes epodes and monodies whatsoever shall hereafter be deemed too polite classical obscure and refined to be read and entirely above human comprehension Pastorals are pretty enough for those that like thembut to me Thyrsis is one of the most insipid fellows I ever conversed with and as for Corridon I do not chuse his company Elegies and epistles are very fine to those to whom they are addressed and as for epic poems I am generally able to discover the whole plan in reading the two first pages  Tragedies however as they are now made are good instructive moral  sermons  enough and it would be a fault not to be pleased with  good things  There I learn several great truths as that it is impossible to see into the ways of futurity that  punishment always attends the villain that love is the fond soother of the human breast that we should not resist heaven's will for in resisting heaven's will heaven's will is resisted with several other sentiments equally new delicate and striking Every new tragedy therefore I shall go to see for reflections of this nature make a tolerable harmony when mixed up with a proper quantity of drum trumpet thunder lightening or the scene shifter's whistle Adieu  LETTER XCV  From Lien Chi Altangi to Fum Hoam first president of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin in China  I HAD some intentions lately of going to visit Bedlam the place where those who go mad are confined I went to wait upon the man in black to be my conductor but I found him preparing to go to Westminsterhall where the English hold their courts of Justice It gave me some surprize to find my friend engaged in a lawsuit but more so when he informed me that it had been depending for several years  How is it possible  cried I  for a man who knows the world to go to law I am well acquainted with the courts of justice in China they resemble rattraps every one of them nothing more easy to get in but to get out again is attended with some d  fficu  ty and more cunning than rats are generally found to possess  Faith replied my friend I should not have gone to law but that I was assured of success before I began things were presented to me in  so alluring a light that I thought by barely declaring myself a candidate for the prize I had nothing more to do but to enjoy the fruits of the victory Thus have I been upon the eve of an imaginary triumph every term these ten years have travelled forward with victory ever in my view but ever out of reach however at present I fancy we have hampered our antagonist in such a manner that without some unforeseen demur we shall this very day lay him fairly on his back  If things be so situated  said I  I don't care if I attend you to the courts and partake in the pleasure of your success But prithee  continued I as we set forward  what reasons have you to think an affair at last concluded which has given you so many former disappointments  My lawyer tells me returned he that I have Salkeld and Ventris strong in my favour and that there are no less then fifteen cases in point  I understand  said I  those are two of your judges who have already declared their opinions  Pardon me replied my friend Salkeld and Ventris are lawyers who some hundred years ago gave their opinion on cases similar to mine these opinions which make for me my lawyer is to cite and those opinions which look another way are cited by the lawyer employed by my antagonist as I observed I have Salkeld and Ventris for me he has Coke and Hales for him and he that has most opinions is most likely to carry his cause  But where is the necessity  cried I  of prolonging a suit by citing the opinions and reports of others since the same good sense which determined lawyers in former ages may serve to guide your judges at this day They at that time gave their opinions only from the light of reason your judges have the same light at  present to direct them let me even add a greater as in former ages there were many prejudices from which the present is happily free If arguing from authorities be exploded from every other branch of learning why should it be particularly adhered to in this I plainly foresee how such a method of investigation must embarrass every suit and even perplex the student ceremonies will be multiplied formalities must encrease and more time will thus be spent in learning the arts of litigation than in the discovery of right  I see cries my friend that you are for a speedy administration of justice but all the world will grant that the more time that is taken up in considering any subject the better it will be understood Besides it is the boast of an Englishman that his property is secure and all the world will grant that a deliberate administration of justice is the best way to  secure his property  Why have we so many lawyers  but to secure our property  why so many formalities but  to secure our property  Not less than one hundred thousand families live in oppulence elegance and ease merely by  securing our property  To embarras justice returned I by a multiplicity of laws or to hazard it by a confidence in our judges are I grant the opposite rocks on which legislative wisdom has ever split in one case the client resembles that Emperor who is said to have been suffocated with the bedcloaths which were only designed to keep him warm in the other to that town which let the enemy take possession of its walls in order to shew the world how little they depended upon aught but courage for  safetyBut bless me what numbers do I see hereall in blackhow is it possible that half this multitude find employment Nothing so easily conceived returned my companion they live by watching each other For instance the catchpole watches the man in debt the attorney watches the catchpole the counsellor watches the attorney the solicitor the counsellor and all find sufficient employment I conceive you interrupted I they watch each other but it is the client that pays them all for watching it puts me in mind of a Chinese Fable which is entituled  Five animals at a meal  A grashopper filled with dew was merrily singing under a shade a whangam that eats grashoppers had marked it for its prey and was just stretching forth to devour it a serpent that had for a long time fed only on whangams was coiled up to fasten on the whangam a yellow bird was just upon the wing to dart upon the serpent a hawk had just stooped from above to seize the yellow bird all were intent on their prey and unmindful of their danger So the whangam eat the grashopper the serpent eat the whangam the yellow bird the serpent and the hawk the yellow bird when sousing from on high a vulture gobbled up the hawk grashopper whangam and all in a moment  I had scarce finished my fable when the lawyer came to inform my friend that his cause was put off till another term that money was wanted to retain and that all the world was of opinion that the very next hearing would bring him off victorious If so then cries my friend I believe  it will be my wisest way to continue the cause for another term and in the mean time my friend here and I will go and see Bedlam  Adieu  LETTER XCVI  From the same  I Lately received a visit from the little beau who I found had assumed a new flow of spirits with a new suit of cloaths Our discourse happened to turn upon the different treatment of the fair sex here and in Asia with the influence of beauty in refining our manners and improving our conversation  I soon perceived he was strongly prejudiced in favour of the Asiatic method of treating the sex and that it was impossible to persuade him but that a man was happier who had four wives at his command than he who had only one "It is true cries he your men of fashion in the East are slaves and under some terrors of having their throats squeezed by a bowstring but what then they can find ample consolation in a seraglio they make indeed an indifferent figure in conversation abroad but then they have a seraglio to console them at home I am told they have no balls drums nor operas but then they have got a seraglio they may be deprived of wine and French cookery but they have a seraglio a seraglio a seraglio my dear creature wipes off every inconvenience in the world  "Besides I am told your Asiatic beauties are the most convenient women alive for they have no souls positively there is nothing in nature I should like so much as ladies without souls soul here is the utter ruin of half the sex A girl of eighteen shall have soul enough to spend an hundred pounds in the turning of a trump Her mother shall have soul enough to ride a sweepstake match at an horserace her maiden aunt shall have soul enough to purchase the furniture of a whole toy shop and others shall have soul enough to behave as if they had no souls at all"  With respect to the soul interrupted I the Asiatics are much kinder to the fair sex than you imagine instead of one soul Fohi the idol of China gives every woman three the Bramines give them fifteen and even Mahomet himself no where excludes the sex from Paradise Abulfeda reports that an old woman one day importuning him to know what she ought to do in order to gain Paradise  My good Lady  answered the Prophet  old women never get there  what never get to Paradise returned the matron in a fury Never says he for they always grow young by the way  No Sir continued I the men of Asia behave with more deference to the sex than you seem to imagine As you of Europe say grace upon sitting down to dinner so it is the custom in China to say grace when a man goes to bed to his wife  And may I die  returned my companion  but a very pretty ceremony for seriously Sir I see no reason why a man should not he as grateful in one situation as in the other Upon honour I always find myself much  more disposed to gratitude on the couch of a fine woman than upon sitting down to a sirloin of beef  Another ceremony said I resuming the conversation in favour of the sex amongst us is the bride's being allowed after marriage  her three days of freedom  During this interval a thousand extravagancies are practised by either sex The lady is placed upon the nuptial bed and numberless monkey tricks are played round to divert her One gentleman smells her perfumed handkerchief another attempts to untie her garters a third pulls off her shoe to play hunt the slipper another pretends to be an ideot and endeavours to raise a laugh by grimacing in the mean time the glass goes briskly about till ladies gentlemen wife husband and all are mixed together in one inundation of arrack punch  "Strike me dumb deaf and blind cried my companion but very pretty there's some sense in your Chinese ladies condescentions but among us you shall scarce find one of the whole sex that shall hold her good humour for three days together No later than yesterday I happened to say some civil things to a citizen's wife of my acquaintance not because I loved but because I had charity and what do you think was the tender creature's reply Only that she detested my pigtail wig high heeled shoes and sallow complexion That is all Nothing more Yes by the heavens though she was more ugly than an unpainted actress I found her more insolent than a thorough bred woman of quality"  He was proceeding in this wild manner when his invective was interrupted by the man in black who entered the apartment introducing his neice a young lady of exquisite beauty Her very appearance was sufficient to silence the severest satyrist of the sex easy without pride and free without impudence she seemed capable of supplying every sense with pleasure her looks her conversation were natural and unconstrained she had neither been taught to languish nor ogle to laugh without a jest or sigh without sorrow I found that she had just returned from abroad and had been conversant in the manners of the world Curiosity prompted me to ask several questions but she declined them all I own I never found myself so strongly prejudiced in favour of apparent merit before and could willingly have prolonged our conversation but the company after some time withdrew Just however before the little beau took his leave he called me aside and requested I would change him a twenty pound bill which as I was incapable of doing he was contented with borrowing half a crown  Adieu  LETTER XCVII  From Lien Chi Altangi to Hinpgo by the way of Moscow  FEW virtues have been more praised by moralists than generosity every practical treatise of Ethics tends to encrease our sensibility of the distresses of others and to relax the grasp of frugality  Philosophers that are poor praise it because they are gainers by its effects and the opulent Seneca himself has written a treatise on benefits though he was known to give nothing away  But among the many who have enforced the duty of giving I'm surprised there are none to inculcate the ignominy of receiving to shew that by every favour we accept we in some measure forfeit our native freedom and that a state of continual dependance on the generosity of others is a life of gradual debasement  Were men taught to despise the receiving obligations with the same force of reasoning and declamation that they are instructed to confer them we might then see every person in society filling up the requisite duties of his station with chearful industry neither relaxed by hope nor sullen from disappointment  Every favour a man receives in some measure sinks him below his dignity and in proportion to the value of the benefit or the frequency of its acceptance he gives up so much of his natural independance He therefore who thrives upon the unmerited bounty of another if he h  any sensibility suffers the worst of servitude the shackled slave may murmur without reproach but the humble dependant is taxed with ingratitude upon every symptom of discontent the one may rave round the walls of his cell but the other lingers in all the silence of mental confinement To encrease his distress every new obligation but adds to the former load which kept the vigorous mind from rising till at last elastic no  longer it shapes itself to constraint and puts on habitual servility  It is thus with the feeling mind but there are some who born without any share of sensibility receive favour after favour and still cringe for more who accept the offer of generosity with as little reluctance as the wages of merit and even make thanks for past benefits an indirect petition for new such I grant can suffer no debasement from dependance since they were originally as vile as was possible to be dependance degrades only the ingenuous but leaves the sordid mind in pristine meanness In this manner therefore long continued generosity is misplaced or it is injurious it either finds a man worthless or it makes him so and true it is that the person who is contented to be  often  obliged ought not to have been obliged at all  Yet while I describe the meanness of a life of continued dependance I would not be thought to include those natural or political subordinations which subsist in every society for in such tho' dependance is exacted from the inferior yet the obligation on either side is mutual The son must rely upon his parent for support but the parent lies under the same obligations to give that the other has to expect the subordinate officer must receive the commands of his superior but for this obedience the former has a right to demand an intercourse of favour such is not the dependance I would depreciate but that where every expected favour must be the result of mere benevolence in the giver where the benefit can be kept without remorse or transferred without injustice The character of a legacyhunter for instance is  detestable in some countries and despicable in all this universal contempt of a man who infringes upon none of the laws of society some moralists have arraigned as a popular and unjust prejudice never considering the necessary degradations a wretch must undergo who previously expects to grow rich by benefits without having either natural or social claims to enforce his petitions  But this intercourse of benefaction and acknowledgement is often injurious even to the giver as well as the receiver a man can gain but little knowledge of himself or of the world amidst a circle of those whom hope or gratitude has gathered round him their unceasing humiliations must necessarily encrease his comparative magnitude for all men measure their own abilities by those of their company thus being taught to overrate his merit he in reality lessens it encreasing in confidence but not in power his professions end in empty boast his undertakings in shameful disappointment  It is perhaps one of the severest misfortunes of the great that they are in general obliged to live among men whose real value is lessened by dependance and whose minds are enslaved by obligation The humble companion may have at first accepted patronage with generous views but soon he feels the mortifying influence of conscious inferiority by degrees sinks into a flatterer and from flattery at last degenerates into stupid veneration To remedy this the great often dis+miss their old dependants and take new Such changes are falsely imputed to levity falsehood  or caprice in the patron since they may be more justly ascribed to the client's gradual deterioration  No my son a life of independance is generally a life of virtue It is that which fits the soul for every generous flight of humanity freedom and friendship To give should be our pleasure but to receive our shame serenity health and affluence attend the desire of rising by labour misery repentance and disrespect that of succeeding by extorted benevolence the man who can thank himself alone for the happiness he enjoys is truly blest and lovely far more lovely the sturdy gloom of laborious indigence than the fawning simper of thriving adulation Adieu  LETTER XCVIII  From Lien Chi Altangi to Fum Hoam first president of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin in China  IN every society some men are born to teach and others to receive instruction some to work and others to enjoy in idleness the fruits of their industry some to govern and others to obey Every people how free soever must be contented to give up part of their liberty and judgment to those who govern in exchange for their hopes of security and the motives which first influenced their choice in the election of their governors should ever be weighed against the succeeding apparent inconsistencies of their conduct All cannot be rulers and men are generally best  governed by a few In making way thro' the intricacies of business the smallest obstacles are apt to retard the execution of what is to be planned by a multiplicity of counsels the judgment of one alone being always fittest for winding through the labyrinths of intrigue and the obstructions of disappointment A serpent which as the fable observes is furnished with one head and many tails is much more capable of subsistence and expedition than another which is furnished with but one tail and many heads  Obvious as these truths are the people of this country seem insensible of their force Not satisfied with the advantages of internal peace and opulence they still murmur at their governors and interfere in the execution of their designs as if they wanted to be something more than happy But as the Europeans instruct by argument and the Asiatics mostly by narration were I to address them I should convey my sentiments in the following story  Takupi had long been Prime Minister of Tipartala a fertile country that stretches along the western confines of China During his administration whatever advantages could be derived from arts learning and commerce were seen to bless the people nor were the necessary precautions of providing for the security of the state forgotten It often happens however that when men are possessed of all they want they then begin to find torment from imaginary afflictions and lessen their present enjoyments by foreboding that those enjoyments are to have an end The people now therefore endeavoured to find out grievances  and after some search actually began to think themselves aggrieved A petition against the enormities of Takupi was carried to the throne in due form and the Queen who governed the country willing to satisfy her subjects appointed a day in which his accusers should be heard and the Minister should stand upon his defence  The day being arrived and the Minister brought before the tribunal a carrier who supplied the city with fish appeared among the number of his accusers He exclaimed that it was the custom time immemorial for carriers to bring their fish upon an horse in a hamper which being placed on one side and balanced by a stone on the other was thus conveyed with ease and safety but that the prisoner moved either by a spirit of innovation or perhaps bribed by the hampermakers had obliged all carriers to use the stone no longer but balance one hamper with another an order entirely repugnant to the customs of all antiquity and those of the kingdom of Tipartala in particular  The carrier finished and the whole court shook their heads at the innovating Minister when a second witness appeared He was inspector of the city buildings and accused the disgraced favourite of having given orders for the demolition of an ancient ruin which obstructed the passage thro' one of the principal streets He observed that such buildings were noble monuments of barbarous antiquity contributed finely to shew how little their ancestors understood of architecture and for that reason such monuments should be held sacred and suffered gradually to decay  The last witness now appeared This was a widow who had laudably attempted to burn herself upon her husband's funeral pile But the innovating minister had prevented the execution of her design and was insensible to her tears protestations and entreaties  The Queen could have pardoned the two former offences but this last was considered as so gross an injury to the sex and so directly contrary to all the customs of antiquity that it called for immediate justice "What cried the Queen not suffer a woman to burn herself when she thinks proper The sex are to be very prettily tutored no doubt if they must be restrained from entertaining their female friends now and then with a fried wife or roasted acquaintance I sentence the criminal to be banished my presence for ever for his injurious treatment  the sex"  Takupi had been hitherto silent and spoke only to shew the sincerity of his resignation "Great Queen cried he I acknowledge my crime and since I am to be banished I beg it may be to some ruined town or desolate village in the country I have governed I shall find some pleasure in improving the soil and bringing back a spirit of industry among the inhabitants" His request appearing reasonable it was immediately complied with and a courtier had orders to fix upon a place of banishment answering the Minister's description After some months search however the enquiry proved fruitless neither a desolate village nor a ruined town was found in the whole kingdom  Alas  said Takupi then to the Queen  How can that country be ill governed which has neither a  desolate village nor a ruined town in it  The Queen perceived the justice of his expostulation and the Minister was received into more than former favour  LETTER XCIX  From the same  THE ladies here are by no means such ardent gamesters as the women of Asia In this respect I must do the English justice for I love to praise where applause is justly merited Nothing more common in China than to see two women of fashion continue gaming till one has won all the other's cloaths and stripped her quite naked the winner thus marching off in a double suit of finery and the loser shrinking behind in the primitive simplicity of nature  No doubt you remember when  Shang  our maiden aunt played with a sharper First her money went then her trinkets were produced her cloaths followed piece by piece soon after when she had thus played herself quite naked being a woman of spirit and willing to pursue  her own  she staked her teeth fortune was against her even here and her teeth followed her cloaths at last she played for her left eye and oh hard fate this too she lost however she had the consolation of biting the sharper for he never perceived  that it was made of glass till it became his own  How happy my friend are the English ladies who never rise to such an inordinance of passion Though the sex here are naturally fond of games of chance and are taught to manage games of skill from their infancy yet they never pursue ill fortune with such amazing intrepidity Indeed I may entirely acquit them of ever playingI mean of playing for their eyes or their teeth  It is true they often stake their fortune their beauty health and reputations at a gamingtable It even sometimes happens that they play their husbands into a jail yet still they preserve a decorum unknown to our wives and daughters of China I have been present at a route in this country where a woman of fashion after losing her money has sat writhing in all the agonies of bad luck and yet after all never once attempted to strip a single petticoat or cover the board as her last stake with her headcloaths  However though I praise their moderation at play I must not conceal their assiduity In China our women except upon some great days are never permitted to finger a dicebox but here every day seems to be a festival and night itself which gives others rest only serves to encrease the female gamester's industry I have been told of an old lady in the country who being given over by the physicians played with the curate of her parish to pass the time away having won all his money she next proposed playing for her funeral charges the  proposal was accepted but unfortunately the lady expired just as she had taken in her game  There are some passions which though differently pursued are attended with equal consequences in every country here they game with more perseverance there with greater fury here they strip their families there they strip themselves naked A lady in China who indulges a passion for gaming often becomes a drunkard and by flourishing a dicebox in one hand she generally comes to brandish a dram cup in the other Far be it from me to say there are any who drink drams in England but it is natural to suppose that when a lady has lost every thing else but her honour she wi  l be apt to toss that into the bargain and grown insensible to nicer feelings behave like the Spaniard who when all his money was gone endeavoured to borrow more by offering to pawn his whisker Adieu  LETTER C  From Lien Chi Altangi to *** Merchant in Amsterdam  I HAVE just received a letter from my son in which he informs me of the fruitlessness of his endeavours to recover the lady with whom he fled from Persia He strives to cover under the appearance of fortitude a heart torn with anxiety and disappointment I have offered little consolation since that but too frequently feeds the sorrow which it pretends to deplore and strengthens the  impression which nothing but the external rubs of time and accident can thoroughly efface  He informs me of his intentions of quitting Moscow the first opportunity and travelling by land to Amsterdam I must therefore upon his arrival entreat the continuance of your friendship and beg of you to provide him with proper directions for finding me in London You can scarcely be sensible of the joy I expect upon seeing him once more the ties between the father and the son among us of China are much more closely drawn than with you of Europe  The remittances sent me from Argun to Moscow came in safety I cannot sufficiently admire that spirit of honesty which prevails through the whole country of Siberia perhaps the savages of that desolate region are the only untutored people of the globe that cultivate the moral virtues even without knowing that their actions merit praise I have been told surprising things of their goodness benevolence and generosity and the uninterrupted commerce between China and Russia serves as a collateral confirmation  Let us  says the Chinese lawgiver  admire the rude virtues of the ignorant but rather imitate the delicate morals of the polite  In the country where I reside though honesty and benevolence be not so congenial yet art supplies the place of nature Though here every vice is carried to excess yet every virtue is practised also with unexampled superiority A city like this is the soil for great virtues and great vices the villain can soon improve here in the  deepest mysteries of deceiving and the practical philosopher can every day meet new incitements to mend his honest intentions There are no pleasures sensual or sentimental which this city does not produce yet I know not how I could not be content to reside here for life There is something so seducing in that spot in which we first had existence that nothing but it can please whatever vicissitudes we experience in life however we toil or wheresoever we wander our fatigued wishes still recur to home for tranquillity we long to die in that spot which gave us birth and in that pleasing expectation opiate every calamity  You now therefore perceive that I have some intentions of leaving this country and yet my designed departure fills me with reluctance and regret Though the friendships of travellers are generally more transient than vernal snows still I feel an uneasiness at breaking the connections I have formed since my arrival particularly I shall have no small pain in leaving my usual companion guide and instructor  I shall wait for the arrival of my son before I set out He shall be my companion in every intended journey for the future in his company I can support the fatigues of the way with redoubled ardour pleased at once with conveying instruction and exacting obedience  Adieu  LETTER CI  From Lien Chi Altangi to Fum Hoam first president of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin in China  OUR scholars of China have a most profound veneration for forms A first rate beauty never studied the decorums of dress with more assiduity they may properly enough be said to be cloathed with wisdom from head to foot they have their philosophical caps and philosophical whiskers their philosophical slippers and philosophical fans there is even a philosophical standard for measuring the nails and yet with all this seeming wisdom they are often found to be mere empty pretenders  A philosophical beau is not so frequent in Europe yet I am told that such characters are found here I mean such as punctually support all the decorums of learning without being really very profound or naturally possessed of a fine understanding who labour hard to obtain the titular honours attending literary merit who flatter others in order to be flattered in turn and only study to be thought students  A character of this kind generally receives company in his study in all the pensive formality of slippers nightgown and easy chair The table is covered with a large book which is always kept open and never read his solitary hours being dedicated to dozing mending pens feeling his pulse peeping through the microscope and sometimes reading amusing books which he condemns in company His library is preserved  with the most religious neatness and is generally a repository of scarce books which bear an high price because too dull or useless to become common by the ordinary methods of publication  Such men are generally candidates for admittance into literary clubs academies and institutions where they regularly meet to give and receive a little instruction and a great deal of praise In conversation they never betray ignorance because they never seem to receive information Offer a new observation they have heard it before pinch them in an argument and they reply with a sneer  Yet how trifling soever these little arts may appear they answer one valuable purpose of gaining the practisers the esteem they wish for The bounds of a man's knowledge are easily concealed if he has but prudence but all can readily see and admire a gilt library a set of long nails a silver standish or a wellcombed whisker who are incapable of distinguishing a dunce  When Father Matthew the first European Missioner entered China the court was informed that he possessed great skill in astronomy he was therefore sent for and examined The established astronomers of state undertook this task and made their report to the Emperor that his skill was but very superficial and no way comparable to their own The Missioner however appealed from their judgment to experience and challenged them to calculate an eclipse of the moon that was to happen a few nights following "What said some shall a Barbarian without nails pretend to vie with  men in astronomy who have made it the study of their lives with men who know half the knowable characters of words who wear scientifical caps and slippers and who have gone through every literary degree with applause" They accepted the challenge confident of success The eclipse began the Chinese produced a most splendid apparatus and were fifteen minutes wrong the Missioner with a single instrument was exact to a second This was convincing but the court astronomers were not to be convinced instead of acknowledging their error they assured the Emperor that their calculations were certainly exact but that the stranger without nails had actually bewitched the moon  Well then  cries the good Emperor smiling at their ignorance  you shall still continue to be servants of the moon but I constitute this man her Controller  China is thus replete with men whose only pretensions to knowledge arise from external circumstances and in Europe every country abounds with them in proportion to its ignorance Spain and Flanders who are behind the rest of Europe in learning at least three centuries have twenty literary titles and marks of distinction unknown in France or England they have their  Clarissimi  and  Preclarissimi  their  Accurat  ssimi  and  Minutissimi  a Round cap entitles one student to argue and a Square cap permits another to teach while a cap with a Tossel almost sanctifies the head it happens to cover But where true knowledge is cultivated these formalities begin to disappear the ermin'd cowl the solemn beard and sweeping train are laid aside philosophers dress and talk and think like other men and lambskin dressers and capmakers and tailcarriers now deplore a literary  For my own part my friend I have seen enough of presuming ignorance never to venerate wisdom but where it actually appears I have received literary titles and distinctions myself and by the quantity of my own wisdom know how very little wisdom they can confer Adieu  LETTER CII  From Lien Chi Altangi to Fum Hoam first president of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin in China  THE time for the young King's coronation approaches the great and the little world look forward with impatience A knight from the country who has brought up his family to see and be seen on this occasion has taken all the lower part of the house where I lodge His wife is laying in a large quantity of silks which the mercer tells her are to be fashionable next season and Miss her daughter has actually had her ears bored previous to the ceremony In all this bustle of preparation I am considered as mere lumber and have been shoved up two stories higher to make room for others my landlady seems perfectly convinced are my betters but whom before me she is contented with only calling very good company  The little beau who has now forced himself into my intimacy was yesterday giving me a most minute detail of the intended procession All men are eloquent upon their favourite topic and this seemed peculiarly adapted to the size and turn of his understanding His whole mind was blazoned over with a variety of glittering images coronets  escutcheons lace fringe tassels stones bugles and spun glass "Here cried he Garter is to walk and there Rouge Dragon marches with the escutcheons on his back Here Clarencieux moves forward and there Blue Mantle disdains to be left behind Here the Aldermen march two and two and there the undaunted Champion of England no way terrified at the very numerous appearance of gentlemen and ladies rides forward in complete armour and with an intrepid air throws down his glove Ah continued he should any be so hardy as to take up that fatal glove and so accept the challenge we should see fine sport the Champion would shew him no mercy he would soon teach him all his passes with a witness However I am afraid we shall have none willing to try it with him upon the approaching occasion for two reasons first because his antagonist would stand a chance of being killed in the single combat and secondly because if he escapes the Champion's arm he would certainly be hanged for treason No no I fancy none will be so hardy as to dispute it with a Champion like him inured to arms and we shall probably see him prancing unmolested away holding his bridle thus in one hand and brandishing his dram cup in the other"  Some men have a manner of describing which only wraps the subject in more than former obscurity thus I was unable with all my companion's volubility to form a distinct idea of the intended procession I was certain that the inauguration of a King should be conducted with solemnity and religious awe and I could not be persuaded that there was much solemnity in this description If this be true cried I to myself the people of Europe  surely have a strange manner of mixing solemn and fantastic images together pictures at once replete with burlesque and the sublime At a time when the King enters into the most solemn compact with his people nothing surely should be admitted to diminish from the real Majesty of the ceremony A ludicrous image brought in at such a time throws an air of ridicule upon the whole It some way resembles a picture I have seen designed by Albert Durer where amidst all the solemnity of that aweful scene a deity judging and a trembling world awaiting the decree he has introduced a merry mortal trundling his scolding wife to hell in a wheelbarrow  My companion who mistook my silence during this interval of reflection for the rapture of astonishment proceeded to describe those frivolous parts of the shew that mostly struck his imagination and to assure me that if I stayed in this country some months longer I should see fine things "For my own part continued he I know already of fifteen suits of cloaths that would stand on one end with gold lace all designed to be first shewn there and as for diamonds rubies emeralds and pearls we shall see them as thick as brass nails in a sedan chair And then we are all to walk so majestically thus this foot always behind the foot before The ladies are to fling nosegays the court poets to scatter verses the spectators are to be all in full dress Mrs Tibbs in a new sacque ruffles and frenched hair look where you will one thing finer than another Mrs Tibbs curtesies to the Duchess her Grace returns the compliment with a bow Largess cries the Herald Make room cries the Gentleman Usher Knock him down cries the guard  Ah continued he amazed at his own description what an astonishing scene of grandeur can art produce from the smallest circumstance when it thus actually turns to wonder one man putting on another man's hat"  I now found his mind was entirely set upon the fopperies of the pageant and quite regardless of the real meaning of such costly preparations  Pageants  says Bacon  are pretty things but we should rather study to make them elegant than expensive  Processions cavalcades and all that fund of gay frippery furnished out by taylors barbers and tirewomen mechanically influence the mind into veneration an Emperor in his nightcap would not meet with half the respect of an Emperor with a glittering crown Politics resemble religion attempting to divest either of ceremony is the most certain method of bringing either into contempt The weak must have their inducements to admiration as well as the wise and it is the business of a sensible government to impress all ranks with a sense of subordination whether this be effected by a diamond buckle or a virtuous edict a sumptuary law or a glass necklace  This interval of reflection only gave my companion spirits to begin his description afresh and as a greater inducement to raise my curiosity he informed me of the vast sums that were given by the spectators for places "That the ceremony must be fine cries he is very evident from the fine price that is paid for seeing it Several ladies have assured me they could willingly part with one eye rather than be prevented from looking on with the other Come come continues he I have a friend  who for my sake will supply us with places at the most reasonable rates I'll take care you shall not be imposed upon and he will inform you of the use finery rapture splendour and enchantment of the whole ceremony better than I"  Follies often repeated lose their absurdity and assume the appearance of reason his arguments were so often and so strongly enforced that I had actually some thoughts of becoming a spectator We accordingly went together to bespeak a place but guess my surprise when the man demanded a purse of gold for a single seat I could hardly believe him serious upon making the demand "Prithee friend cried I after I have paid twenty pounds for sitting here an hour or two can I bring a part of the Coronation back"  No Sir  "How long can I live upon it after I have come away"  Not long Sir  "Can a Coronation cloath feed or fatten me"  Sir  replied the man  you seem to be under a mistake all that you can bring away is the pleasure of having it to say that you saw the Coronation  "Blast me cries Tibbs if that be all there's no need of paying for that since I am resolved to have that pleasure whether I am there or no"  I am conscious my friend that this is but a very confused description of the intended ceremony You may object that I neither settle rank precedency nor place that I seem ignorant whether Gules walks before or behind Garter that I have neither mentioned the dimensions of a Lord's cap nor measured the length of a Lady's tail I know your delight is in minute description and this I am unhappily disqualified from furnishing yet  upon the whole I fancy it will be no way comparable to the magnificence of our late Emperor Whangti's procession when he was married to the moon at which Fum Hoam himself presided in person Adieu  LETTER CIII  To the same  IT was formerly the custom here when men of distinction died for their surviving acquaintance to throw each a slight present into the grave Several things of little value were made use of for that purpose perfumes reliques spices bitter herbs camomile wormwood and verses This custom however is almost discontinued and nothing but verses alone are now lavished on such occasions an oblation which they suppose may be interred with the dead without any injury to the living  Upon the death of the great therefore the poets and undertakers are sure of employment While one provides the long cloak black staff and mourning coach the other produces the pastoral or elegy the monody or apotheosis The nobility need be under no apprehensions but die as fast as they think proper the poet and undertaker are ready to supply them these can find metaphorical tears and family escutcheons at half an hour's warning and when the one has soberly laid the body in the grave the other is ready to fix it figuratively among the stars  There are several ways of being poetically sorrowful on such occasions The bard is now some pensive youth of science who sits deploring among the tombs again he is Thyrsis complaining in a circle of harmless sheep Now Britannia sits upon her own shore and gives a loose to maternal tenderness at another time Parnassus even the mountain Parnassus gives way to sorrow and is bathed in tears of distress  But the most usual manner is this Damon meets Menalcas who has got a most gloomy countenance The shepherd asks his friend whence that look of distress to which the other replies that Pollio is no more If that be the case then cries Damon let us retire to yonder bower at some distance off where the cypress and the jessamine add fragrance to the breeze and let us weep alternately for Pollio the friend of shepherds and the patron of every muse Ah returns his fellow shepherd what think you rather of that grotto by the fountain side the murmuring stream will help to assist our complaints and a nightingale on a neighbouring tree will join her voice to the concert When the place is thus settled they begin the brook stands still to hear their lamentations the cows forget to graze and the very tygers start from the forest with sympathetic concern By the tombs of our ancestors my dear Fum I am quite unaffected in all this distress the whole is liquid laudanum to my spirits and a tyger of common sensibility has twenty times more tenderness than I  But though I could never weep with the complaining shepherd yet I am sometimes induced to  pity the poet whose trade is thus to make Demigods and Heroes for a dinner There is not in nature a more dismal figure than a man who sits down to premeditated flattery every stanza he writes tacitly reproaches the meanness of his occupation till at last his stupidity becomes more stupid and his dullness more diminutive  I am amazed therefore that none have yet found out the secret of flattering the worthless and yet of preserving a safe conscience I have often wished for some method by which a man might do himself and his deceased patron justice without being under the hateful reproach of selfconviction After long lucubration I have hit upon such an expedient and send you the specimen of a poem upon the decease of a great man in which the flattery is perfectly fine and yet the poet perfectly innocent  On the Death of the Right Honourable ***  Ye muses pour the pitying tear  For Pollio snatch'd away  O had he liv'd another year  He had not dy'd today  O were he born to bless mankind  In virtuous times of yore  Heroes themselves had fallen behind  Whene'er he went before  How sad the groves and plains appear  And sympathetic sheep  Even pitying hills would drop a tear  If hills could learn to weep  His bounty in exalted strain  Each bard might well display  Since none implor'd relief in vain  That went reliev'd away  And hark I hear the tuneful throng  His obsequies forbid  He still shall live shall live as long  As ever dead man did  LETTER CIV  To the same  IT is the most usual method in every report first to examine its probability and then act as the conjuncture may require The English however exert a different spirit in such circumstances they first act and when too late begin to examine From a knowledge of this disposition there are several here who make it their business to frame new reports at every convenient interval all tending to denounce ruin both on their cotemporaries and their posterity This denunciation is eagerly caught up by the public away they fling to propagate the distress sell out at one place buy in at another grumble at their governors shout in mobs and when they have thus for some time behaved like fools sit down coolly to argue and talk wisdom to puzzle each other with syllogism and prepare for the next report that prevails which is always attended with the same success  Thus are they ever rising above one report only to sink into another They resemble a dog in a well pawing to get free When he has raised his upper parts above water and every spectator imagines him disengaged his lower parts drag him down again and sink him to the nose he makes new efforts to emerge and every effort increasing his weakness only tends to sink him the deeper  There are some here who I am told make a tolerable subsistence by the credulity of their countrymen as they find the public fond of blood wounds and death they contrive political ruins suited to every month in the year this month the people are to be eaten up by the French in flatbottomed boats the next by the soldiers designed to beat the French back now the people are going to jump down the gulph of luxury and now nothing but an herring subscription can fish them up again Time passes on the report proves false new circumstances produce new changes but the people never change they are persevering in folly  In other countries those boding politicians would be left to fret over their own schemes alone and grow splenetic without hopes of infecting others But England seems to be the very region where spleen delights to dwell a man not only can give an unbounded scope to the disorder in himself but may if he pleases propagate it over the whole kingdom with a certainty of success He has only to cry out that the government the government is all wrong that their schemes are leading to ruin that Britons are no more every good member of the commonwealth thinks it his duty in such a case to deplore the universal decadence  with sympathetic sorrow and by fancying the constitution in a decay absolutely to impair its vigour  This people would laugh at my simplicity should I advise them to be less sanguine in harbouring gloomy predictions and examine cooly before they attempted to complain I have just heard a story which though transacted in a private family serves very well to describe the behaviour of the whole nation in cases of threatened calamity As there are public so there are private incendiaries here One of the last either for the amusement of his friends or to divert a fit of the spleen lately sent a threatening letter to a worthy family in my neighbourhood to this effect  "SIR Knowing you to be very rich and finding myself to be very poor I think proper to inform you that I have learned the secret of poisoning man woman and child without danger of detection Don't be uneasy Sir you may take your choice of being poisoned in a fortnight or poisoned in a month or poisoned in six weeks you shall have full time to settle all your affairs Though I'm poor I love to do things like a gentleman But Sir you must die I have determined it within my own breast that you must die Blood Sir blood is my trade so I could wish you would this day six weeks take leave of your friends wife and family for I cannot possibly allow you longer time To convince you more certainly of the power of my art by which you may know I speak truth take this letter when you have read it tear off the seal fold it up and give it to your favourite Dutch mastiff that sits by the fire he will  swallow it Sir like a butter'd toast in three hours four minutes after he has taken it he will attempt to bite off his own tongue and half an hour after burst asunder in twenty pieces Blood blood blood so no more at present from Sir your most obedient most devoted humble servant to command till death  You may easily imagine the consternation into which this letter threw the whole good natured family The poor man to whom it was addressed was the more surprised as not knowing how he could merit such inveterate malice All the friends of the family were convened it was universally agreed that it was a most terrible affair and that the government should be solicited to offer a reward and a pardon a fellow of this kind would go on poisoning family after family and it was impossible to say where the destruction would end In pursuance of these determinations the government was applied to strict search was made after the incendiary but all in vain At last therefore they recollected that the experiment was not yet tried upon the dog the Dutch mastiff was brought up and placed in the midst of the friends and relations the seal was torn off the pacquet folded up with care and soon they found to the great surprize of all that the dog would not eat the letter  Adieu  LETTER CV  To the same  I HAVE frequently been amazed at the ignorance of almost all the European travellers who have penetrated any considerable way eastward into Asia They have been influenced either by motives of commerce or piety and their accounts are such as might reasonably be expected from men of very narrow or very prejudiced education the dictates of superstition or the result of ignorance Is it not surprizing that in such a variety of adventurers not one single philosopher should be found for as to the travels of Gemelli the learned are long agreed that the whole is but an imposture  There is scarce any country how rude or incultivated soever where the inhabitants are not possessed of some peculiar secrets either in nature or art which might be transplanted with success in Siberian Tartary for instance the natives extract a strong spirit from milk which is a secret probably unknown to the chymists of Europe In the most savage parts of India they are possessed of the secret of dying vegetable substances scarlet and of refining lead into a metal which for hardness and colour is little inferior to silver not one of which secrets but would in Europe make a man's fortune The power of the Asiatics in producing winds or bringing down rain the Europeans are apt to treat as fabulous  because they have no instances of the like nature among themselves but they would have treated the secrets of gunpowder and the mariner's compass in the same manner had they been told the Chinese used such arts before the invention was common with themselves at home  Of all the English philosophers I most reverence  Bacon  that great and hardy genius he it is who allows of secrets yet unknown who undaunted by the seeming difficulties that oppose prompts human curiosity to examine every part of nature and even exhorts man to try whether he cannot subject the tempest the thunder and even earthquakes to human controll O did a man of his daring spirit of his genius penetration and learning travel to those countries which have been visited only by the superstitious and mercenary what might not mankind expect how would he enlighten the regions to which he travelled And what a variety of knowledge and useful improvement would he not bring back in exchange  There is probably no country so barbarous that would not disclose all it knew if it received from the traveller equivalent information and I am apt to think that a person who was ready to give more knowledge than he received would be welcome wherever he came All his care in travelling should only be to suit his intellectual banquet to the people with whom he conversed he should not attempt to teach the unlettered Tartar astronomy nor yet instruct the polite Chinese in the ruder arts of subsistence he should endeavour to improve the Barbarian in the secrets of living comfortably and the inhabitant of a more refined country in  the speculative pleasures of science How much more nobly would a philosopher thus employed spend his time than by sitting at home earnestly intent upon adding one star more to his catalogue or one monster more to his collection or still if possible more triflingly sedulous in the incatenation of fleas or the sculpture of a cherrystone  I never consider this subject without being surprized how none of those societies so laudably established in England for the promotion of arts and learning have never thought of sending one of their members into the most eastern parts of Asia to make what discoveries he was able To be convinced of the utility of such an undertaking let them but read the relations of their own travellers It will be there found that they are as often deceived themselves as they attempt to deceive others The merchants tells us perhaps the price of different commodities the methods of baling them up and the properest manner for an European to preserve his health in the country The missioner on the other hand informs us with what pleasure the country to which he was sent embraced christianity and the numbers he converted what methods he took to keep Lent in a region where there was no fish or the shifts he made to celebrate the rites of his religion in places where there was neither bread nor wine such accounts with the usual appendage of marriages and funerals inscriptions rivers and mountains make up the whole of an European traveller's diary but as to all the secrets of which the inhabitants are possessed those are universally attributed to magic and when the traveller can give no other account of the wonders he sees performed  he very contentedly ascribes them to the power of the devil  It was an usual observation of  Boyle  the English chymist that if every artist would but discover what new observations occurred to him in the exercise of his trade philosophy would thence gain innumerable improvements It may be observed with still greater justice that if the useful knowledge of every country howsoever barbarous was gleaned by a judicious observer the advantages would be inestimable Are there not even in Europe many useful inventions known or practised but in one place The instrument as an example for cutting down corn in Germany is much more handy and expeditious in my opinion than the sickle used in England The cheap and expeditious manner of making vinegar without previous fermentation is known only in a part of France If such discoveries therefore remain still to be known at home what funds of knowledge might not be collected in countries yet unexplored or only passed through by ignorant travellers in hasty caravans  The caution with which foreigners are received in Asia may be alledged as an objection to such a design But how readily have several European merchants found admission into regions the most suspecting under the character of  Sanjapins  or northern pilgrims to such not even China itself denies access  To send out a traveller properly qualified for these purposes might be an object of national concern it would in some measure repair the  breaches made by ambition and might shew that there were still some who boasted a greater name than that of patriots who professed themselves lovers of men The only difficulty would remain in chusing a proper person for so arduous an enterprize He should be a man of a philosophical turn one apt to deduce consequences of general utility from particular occurrences neither swollen with pride nor hardened by prejudice neither wedded to one particular system nor instructed only in one particular science neither wholly a botanist nor quite an antiquarian his mind should be tinctured with miscellaneous knowledge and his manners humanized by an intercourse with men He should be in some measure an enthusiast to the design fond of travelling from a rapid imagination and an innate love of change furnished with a body capable sustaining every fatigue and an heart not easily terrified at danger  Adieu  LETTER CVI  From the same  ONE of the principal tasks I had proposed to myself on my arrival here was to become acquainted with the names and characters of those now living who as scholars or wits had acquired the greatest share of reputation In order to succeed in this design I fancied the surest method would be to begin my enquiry among the ignorant  judging that his fame would be greatest which was loud enough to be heard by the vulgar Thus predisposed I began the search but only went in quest of disappointment and perplexity I found every district had a peculiar famous man of its own Here the storytelling shoemaker had engrossed the admiration on one side of the street while the bellman who excelleth at a catch was in quiet possession of the other At one end of a lane the sexton was regarded as the greatest man alive but I had not travelled half its length till I found an enthusiast teacher had divided his reputation My landlady perceiving my design was kind enough to offer me her advice in this affair It was true she observed that she was no judge but she knew what pleased herself and if I would rest upon her judgment I should set down Tom Collins as the most ingenious man in the world for Tom was able to take off all mankind and imitate besides a sow and pigs to perfection  I now perceived that taking my standard of reputation among the vulgar would swell my catalogue of great names above the size of a Court Calendar I therefore discontinued this method of pursuit and resolved to prosecute my enquiry in that usual residence of fame a bookseller's shop In consequence of this I entreated the bookseller to let me know who were they who now made the greatest figure either in morals wit or learning Without giving me a direct answer he pulled a pamphlet from the shelf  The Young Attorney's Guide  there Sir cries he there's a touch for you fifteen hundred of these moved off in a day I take the author of this pamphlet either for  title preface plan body or index to be the completest hand in England I found it was vain to prosecute my enquiry where my informer appeared so incompetent a judge of merit so paying for the  Young Attorney's Guide  which good manners obliged me to buy I walked off  My pursuit after famous men now brought me into a print shop Here thought I the painter only reflects the public voice As every man who deserved it had formerly his statue placed up in the Roman forum so here probably the pictures of none but such as merit a place in our affections are held up for public sale But guess my surprize when I came to examine this depositary of noted faces all distinctions were levelled here as in the grave and I could not but regard it as the catacomb of real merit The brick dust man took up as much room as the truncheoned hero and the judge was elbowed by the thieftaker quacks pimps and buffoons encreased the groupe and noted stallions only made room for more noted whores I had read the works of some of the moderns previous to my coming to England with delight and approbation but I found their faces had no place here the walls were covered with the names of authors I had never known or had endeavoured to forget with the little selfadvertising things of a day who had forced themselves into fashion but not into fame I could read at the bottom of some pictures the names of * * and * * * and * * * * all equally candidates for the vulgar shout and foremost to propagate their unblushing faces upon brass My uneasiness therefore at not finding my few favourite names among the number was now changed into congratulation  I could not avoid reflecting on the fine observation of Tacitus on a similar occasion In this cavalcade of flattery cries the historian neither the pictures of Brutus Cassius nor Cato were to be seen  eo clariores quia imagines eorum non deferebantur  their absence being the strongest proof of their merit  It is in vain cried I to seek for true greatness among these monuments of the unburied dead let me go among the tombs of those who are confessedly famous and see if any have been lately deposited there who deserve the attention of posterity and whose names may be transmitted to my distant friend as an honour to the present age Determined in my pursuit I paid a second visit to Westminster Abbey There I found several new monuments erected to the memory of several great men the names of the great men I absolutely forget but I well remember that Roubillac was the statuary who carved them I could not help smiling at two modern epitaphs in particular one of which praised the deceased for being  ortus ex antiqua stirpe  the other commended the dead because  hanc aedem suis sumptibus reaedificavit  the greatest merit of one consisted in his being descended from an illustrious house the chief distinction of the other that he had propped up an old house that was falling Alas alas cried I such monuments as these confer honour not upon the great men but upon little Roubillac  Hitherto disappointed in my enquiry after the great of the present age I was resolved to mix in company and try what I could learn among critics in coffeehouses and here it was that I heard my  favourite names talked of even with inverted fame A gentleman of exalted merit as a writer was branded in general terms as a bad man another of exquisite delicacy as a poet was reproached for wanting good nature a third was accused of freethinking and a fourth of having once been a player Strange cried I how unjust are mankind in the distribution of fame the ignorant among whom I sought at first were willing to grant but incapable of distinguishing the virtues of those which deserved it among those I now converse with they know the proper objects of admiration but mix envy with applause  Disappointed so often I was now resolved to examine those characters in person of whom the world talked so freely by conversing with men of real merit I began to find out those characters which really deserved though they strove to avoid applause I found the vulgar admiration entirely misplaced and malevolence without its sting The truly great possessed of numerous small faults and shining virtues preserve a sublime in morals as in writing They who have attained an excellence in either commit numberless trangressions observable to the meanest understanding The ignorant critic and dull remarker can readily spy blemishes in eloquence or morals whose sentiments are not sufficiently elevated to observe a beauty but such are judges neither of books nor of life they can diminish no solid reputation by their censure nor bestow a lasting character by their applause In short I found by my search that such only can confer real fame upon others who have merit themselves to deserve it Adieu  LETTER CVII  To the same  THERE are numberless employments in the courts of the Eastern Monarchs utterly unpractised and unknown in Europe They have no such officers for instance as the Emperor's eartickler or toothpicker they have never introduced at the courts the Mandarine appointed to bear the royal tobaccobox or the grave director of the imperial exercitations in the seraglio Yet I am surprized that the English have imitated us in none of these particulars as they are generally pleased with every thing that comes from China and excessively fond of creating new and useless employments They have filled their houses with our furniture their public gardens with our fireworks and their very ponds with our fish our courtiers my friend are the fish and the furniture they should have imported our courtiers would fill up the necessary ceremonies of a court better than those of Europe would be contented with receiving large salaries for doing little whereas some of this country are at present discontented though they receive large salaries for doing nothing  I lately therefore had thoughts of publishing a proposal here for the admission of some new Eastern offices and titles into their court register As I consider myself in the light of a Cosmopolite  I find as much satisfaction in scheming for the countries in which I happen to reside as for that in which I was born  The finest apartments in the palace of Pegu are frequently infested with rats These the religion of the country strictly forbids the people to kill In such circumstances therefore they are obliged to have recourse to some great man of the court who is willing to free the royal apartments even at the hazard of his salvation After a weak Monarch's reign the quantity of court vermin in every corner of the palace is surprizing but a prudent king and a vigilant officer soon drives them from their sanctuaries behind the matts and the tapestry and effectually frees the court Such an officer in England would in my opinion be serviceable at this juncture for if as I am told the palace be old much vermin must undoubtedly have taken refuge behind the wainscot and hangings A minister should therefore be invested with the title and dignities of Courtvermin killer he should have full power either to banish take poison or destroy them with enchantments traps ferrets or ratsbane He might be permitted to brandish his besom without remorse and brush down every part of the furniture without sparing a single cobweb however sacred by long prescription I communicated this proposal some days ago in a company of the first distinction and enjoying the most honourable offices of the state Among the number were the inspector of Great Britain Mr Henriques the Director of the Ministry Ben Victor the Treasurer John Lockman the secretary and the Conductor of the Imperial Magazine They all acquiesced  in the utility of my proposal but were apprehensive it might meet with some obstructions from court upholsterers and chambermaids who would object to it from the demolition of the furniture and the dangerous use of ferrets and ratsbane  My next proposal is rather more general than the former and might probably meet with less opposition Though no people in the world flatter each other more than the English I know none who understand the art less and flatter with such little refinement Their panegyric like a Tartar feast is indeed served up with profusion but their cookery is insupportable A client here shall dress up a fricassee for his patron that shall offend an ordinary nose before it enters the room A town shall send up their address to a great minister which shall prove at once a satire on the minister and themselves If the favourite of the day sits or stands or sleeps there are poets to put it into verse and priests to preach it in the pulpit In order therefore to free both those who praise and those who are praised from a duty probably disagreeable to both I would constitute professed flatterers here as in several courts of India These are appointed in the courts of their princes to instruct the people where to exclaim with admiration and where to lay an emphasis of praise But an officer of this kind is always in waiting when the Emperor converses in a familiar manner among his Rajas and other nobility At every sentence when the Monarch pauses and smiles at what he has been saying the Karamatman as this officer is called is to take it for  granted that his Majesty has said a good thing Upon which he cries out Karamat Karamat a miracle a miracle and throws up his hands and his eyes in extacy This is ecchoed by the courtiers around while the Emperor sits all this time in sullen satisfaction enjoying the triumph of his joke or studying a new repartee  I would have such an officer placed at every great man's table in England By frequent practice he might soon become a perfect master of the art and in time would turn out pleasing to his patron no way troublesome to himself and might prevent the nauseous attempts of many more ignorant pretenders The clergy here I am convinced would relish this proposal It would provide places for several of them And indeed by some of their late productions many appear to have qualified themselves as candidates for this office already  But my last proposal I take to be of the utmost importance Our neighbour the Empress of Russia has you may remember instituted an order of female knighthood The Empress of Germany has also instituted another the Chinese have had such an order time immemorial I am amazed the English have never come into such an institution When I consider what kind of men are made knights here it appears strange that they have never conferred this honour upon women They make cheesemongers and pastrycooks Knights then why not their wives They have called up tallow chandlers to maintain the hardy profession of chivalry and arms then why not their wives Haberdashers are sworn as I suppose all knights must be sworn  never to fly in time of mellay or battle  to maintain and uphold the noble estate of Chivalry with horse harnishe and other Knightlye habiliments  Haberdashers I say are sworn to all this then why not their wives Certain I am their wives understand fighting and feats of mellay and battle better than they and as for Knightlye horse and harnishe it is probable both know nothing more than the harness of a one horse chaise No no my friend instead of conferring any order upon the husbands I would knight their wives However the State should not be troubled with a new institution upon this occasion Some ancient exploded order might be revived which would furnish both a motto and a name the ladies might be permitted to chuse for themselves There are for instance the obsolete orders of the  Dragon  in Germany of the  Rue  in Scotland and the  Porcupine  in France all well sounding names and very applicable to my intended female institution  Adieu  LETTER CVIII  To the same  RELIGIOUS Sects in England are far more numerous than in China Every man who has interest enough to hire a conventicle here may set up for himself and sell off a new religion The sellers of the newest pattern at present give extreme good bargains and let their disciples have a great deal of  confidence  for very little money  Their shops are much frequented and their customers every day encreasing for people are naturally fond of going to Paradise at as small expence as possible  Yet you must not conceive this modern sect as differing in opinion from those of the established religion Difference of opinion indeed formerly divided their sectaries and sometimes drew their armies to the field White gowns and black mantles slapped hats and cross pocket holes were once the obvious causes of quarrel men then had some reason for fighting they knew what they fought about but at present they are arrived at such refinement in religionmaking that they have actually formed a new sect without a new opinion they quarrel for opinions they both equally defend they hate each other and that is all the difference between them  But though their principles are the same their practice is somewhat different Those of the established religion laugh when they are pleased and their groans are seldom extorted but by pain or danger The new sect on the contrary weep for their amusement and use little music except a chorus of sighs and groans or tunes that are made to imitate groaning Laughter is their aversion lovers court each other from the lamentations the bridegroom approaches the nuptial couch in sorrowful solemnity and the bride looks more dismal than an undertaker's shop Dancing round the room is with them running in a direct line to the devil and as for gaming though but in jest they would sooner play with a rattlesnake's tail than finger a dicebox  By this time you perceive that I am describing a sect of Enthusiasts and you have already compared them with the Faquirs Bramins and Talapoins of the East Among these you know are generations that have been never known to smile and voluntary affliction makes up all the merit they can boast of Enthusiasms in every country produce the same effects stick the Faquir with pins or confine the Bramine to a vermine hospital spread the Talapoin on the ground or load the Sectary's brow with contrition those worshipers who discard the light of reason are ever gloomy their fears encrease in proportion to their ignorance as men are continually under apprehensions who walk in darkness  Yet there is still a stronger reason for the enthusiast's being an enemy to laughter namely his being himself so proper an object of ridicule It is remarkable that the propagators of false doctrines have ever been averse to mirth and always begin by recommending gravity when they intended to disseminate imposture Fohi the idol of China is represented as having never laughed Zoroaster the leader of the Bramins is said to have laughed but twice upon his coming into the world and upon his leaving it and Mahomet himself though a lover of pleasure was a professed opposer of gaiety Upon a certain occasion telling his followers that they would all appear naked at the resurrection his favourite wife represented such an assembly as immodest and unbecoming Foolish woman cried the grave prophet though the whole assembly be naked on that day they shall have forgotten to laugh Men like him opposed ridicule because they knew it to be a most formidable  antagonist and preached up gravity to conceal their own want of importance  Ridicule has ever been the most powerful enemy of enthusiasm and properly the only antagonist that can be opposed to it with success Persecution only serves to propagate new religions they acquire fresh vigour beneath the executioner and the ax and like some vivacious insects multiply by dissection It is also impossible to combat enthusiasm with reason for though it makes a shew of resistance it soon eludes the pressure refers you to distinctions not to be understood and feelings which it cannot explain A man who would endeavour to fix an enthusiast by argument might as well attempt to spread quicksilver with his fingers The only way to conquer a visionary is to despise him the stake the faggot and the disputing Doctor in some measure ennoble the opinions they are brought to oppose they are harmless against innovating pride contempt alone is truly dreadful Hunters generally know the most vulnerable part of the beasts they pursue by the care which every animal takes to defend the side which is weakest on what side the enthusiast is most vulnerable may be known by the care which he takes in the beginning to work his disciples into gravity and guard them against the power of ridicule  When Philip the second was King of Spain there was a contest in Salamanca between two orders of friars for superiority The legend of one side contained more extraordinary miracles but the legend of the other was reckoned most authentic They reviled each other as is usual in  disputes of divinity the people were divided into factions and a civil war appeared unavoidable In order to prevent such an imminent calamity the combatants were prevailed upon to submit their legions to the fiery trial and that which came forth untouched by the fire was to have the victory and to be honoured with a double share of reverence Whenever the people flock to see a miracle it is an hundred to one but that they see a miracle incredible therefore were the numbers that were gathered round upon this occasion the friars on each side approached and confidently threw their respective legends into the flames when lo to the utter disappointment of all the assembly instead of a miracle both legends were consumed Nothing but thus turning both parties into contempt could have prevented the effusion of blood The people now laughed at their former folly and wondered why they fell out Adieu  LETTER CIX  To the same  THE English are at present employed in celebrating a feast which becomes general every seventh year the Parliament of the nation being then dissolved and another appointed to be chosen This solemnity falls infinitely short of our feast of the lanthorns in magnificence and splendour it is also surpassed by others of the East in unanimity and pure devotion but no festival in the world can compare with it for eating Their eating indeed amazes me Had I five hundred heads and were each head furnished with brains yet would they  all be insufficient to compute the number of cows pigs geese and turkies which upon this occasion die for the good of their country  To say the truth eating seems to make a grand ingredient in all English parties of zeal business or amusement When a Church is to be built or an Hospital endowed the Directors assemble and instead of consulting upon it they eat upon it by which means the business goes forward with success When the Poor are to be relieved the officers appointed to dole out public charity assemble and eat upon it Nor has it ever been known that they filled the bellies of the poor till they had previously satisfied their own But in the election of Magistrates the people seem to exceed all bounds the merits of a candidate are often measured by the number of his treats his constituents assemble eat upon him and lend their applause not to his integrity or sense but the quantities of his beef and brandy  And yet I could forgive this people their plentiful meals on this occasion as it is extremely natural for every man to eat a great deal when he gets it for nothing but what amazes me is that all this good living no way contributes to improve their good humour On the contrary they seem to lose their temper as they lose their appetites every morsel they swallow and every glass they pour down serves to encrease their animosity Many an honest man before as harmless as a tame rabbit when loaded with a single election dinner has become more dangerous than a charged culverin Upon one of these occasions I have actually seen a bloody minded Man Milliner sally  forth at the head of a mob determined to face a desperate Pastry Cook who was General of the opposite party  But you must not suppose they are without a pretext for thus beating each other On the contrary no man here is so uncivilized as to beat his neighbour without producing very sufficient reasons One candidate for instance treats with gin a spirit of their own manufacture another always drinks brandy imported from abroad Brandy is a wholesome liquor gin a liquor wholly their own This then furnishes an obvious cause of quarrel Whether it be most reasonable to get drunk with gin or get drunk with brandy The mob meet upon the debate fight themselves sober and then draw off to get drunk again and charge for another encounter So that the English may now properly be said to be engaged in war since while they are subduing their enemies abroad they are breaking each other's heads at home  I lately made an excursion to a neighbouring village in order to be a spectator of the ceremonies practised upon this occasion I left town in company with three fidlers nine dozen of hams and a corporation poet which were designed as reinforcements to the gin drinking party We entered the town with a very good face the fidlers no way intimidated by the enemy kept handling their arms up the principal street By this prudent manoeuvre they took peaceable possession of their headquarters amidst the shouts of multitudes who seemed perfectly rejoiced at hearing their music but above all at seeing their bacon  I must own I could not avoid being pleased to see all ranks of people on this occasion levelled into an equality and the poor in some measure enjoying the primitive privileges of nature If there was any distinction shewn the lowest of the people seemed to receive it from the rich I could perceive a cobler with a levee at his door and an haberdasher giving audience from behind his counter But my reflections were soon interrupted by a mob who demanded whether I was for the Distillery or the Brewery as these were terms with which I was totally unacquainted I chose at first to be silent however I know not what might have been the consequence of my reserve had not the attention of the mob been called off to a skirmish between a brandydrinker's cow and a gindrinker's mastiff which turned out greatly to the satisfaction of the mob in favour of the mastiff  This spectacle which afforded high entertainment was at last ended by the appearance of one of the candidates who came to harangue the mob he made a very pathetic speech upon the late excessive importation of foreign drams and the downfall of the distillery I could see some of the audience shed tears He was accompanied in his procession by Mrs Deputy and Mrs Mayoress Mrs Deputy was not in the least in liquor and for Mrs Mayoress one of the spectators assured me in my ear that She was a very fine woman before she had the smallpox  Mixing with the croud I was now conducted to the hall where the magistrates are chosen but what tongue can describe this scene of confusion the whole crowd seemed equally inspired with anger  jealousy politics patriotism and punch I remarked one figure that was carried up by two men upon this occasion I at first began to pity his infirmities as natural but soon found the fellow so drunk that he could not stand another made his appearance to give his vote but though he could stand he actually lost the use of his tongue and remained silent a third who though excessively drunk could both stand and speak being asked the Candidate's name for whom he voted could be prevailed upon to make no other answer but Tobacco and Brandy In short an electionhall seems to be a theatre where every passion is seen without disguise a school where fools may readily become worse and where philosophers may gather wisdom Adieu  LETTER CX  From the same  THE disputes among the learned here are now carried on in a much more compendious manner than formerly There was a time when folio was brought to oppose folio and a champion was often listed for life under the banners of a single sorites At present the controversy is decided in a summary way an epigram or an acrostic finishes the debate and the combatant like the incursive Tartar advances and retires with a single blow  An important literary debate at present engrosses the attention of the town It is carried on with  sharpness and a proper share of this epigrammatical fury An author it seems has taken an aversion to the faces of several players and has written verses to prove his dislike the players fall upon the author and assure the town he must be dull and their faces must be good because he wants a dinner a critic comes to the poet's assistance asserting that the verses were perfectly original and so smart that he could never have written them without the assistance of friends the friends upon this arraign the critic and plainly prove the verses to be all the author's own So at it they are all four together by the ears the friends at the critic the critic at the players the players at the author and the author at the players again It is impossible to determine how this manysided contest will end or which party to adhere to The town without siding with any views the combat in suspense like the fabled hero of antiquity who beheld the earthborn brothers give and receive mutual wounds and fall by indiscriminate destruction  This is in some measure a state of the present dispute but the combatants here differ in one respect from the champions of the fable Every new wound only gives vigour for another blow though they appear to strike they are in fact mutually swelling themselves into consideration and thus advertising each other away into fame Today says one my name shall be in the Gazette the next day my rival's people will naturally enquire about us thus we shall at least make a noise in the streets though we have got nothing to sell I have read of a dispute of a similar nature which was managed here about twenty years ago Hildebrand  Jacob as I think he was called and Charles Johnson were poets both at that time possessed of great reputation for Johnson had written eleven plays acted with great success and Jacob though he had written but five had five times thanked the town for their unmerited applause They soon became mutually enamoured of each other's talents they wrote they felt they challenged the town for each other Johnson assured the public that no poet alive had the easy simplicity of Jacob and Jacob exhibited Johnson as a masterpiece in the pathetic Their mutual praise was not without effect the town saw their plays were in raptures read and without censuring them forgot them So formidable an union however was soon opposed by Tibbald Tibbald asserted that the tragedies of one had faults and the comedies of the other substituted wit for vivacity the combined champions flew at him like tygers arraigned the censurer's judgment and impeached his sincerity It was a long time a dispute among the learned which was in fact the greatest man Jacob Johnson or Tibbald they had all written for the stage with great success their names were seen in almost every paper and their works in every coffeehouse However in the hottest of the dispute a fourth combatant made his appearance and swept away the three combatants tragedy comedy and all into undistinguished ruin  From this time they seemed consigned into the hands of criticism scarce a day passed in which they were not arraigned as detested writers The critics these enemies of Dryden and Pope were their enemies So Jacob and Johnson instead of mending by criticism called it envy and because Dryden and Pope were censured they compared themselves to Dryden and Pope  But to return the weapon chiefly used in the present controversy is Epigram and certainly never was a keener made use of They have discovered surprising sharpness on both sides The first that came out upon this occasion was a kind of new composition in this way and might more properly be called an epigrammatic thesis than an Epigram It consists first of an argument in prose next follows a motto from Roscommon then comes the the epigram and lastly notes serving to explain the Epigram But you shall have it with all its decorations  An  EPIGRAM Addressed to the Gentlemen reflected on in the ROSCIAD a Poem by the Author  Worry'd with debts and past all hopes of bail  His pen he prostitutes t'avoid a goal  ROSCOM  "Let not the  hungry  Bavius' angry stroke  Awake resentment or your rage provoke  But pitying his distress let virtue  Charity  shine  And giving each your bounty  Settled at One Shilling the Price of the Poem  let him dine    For thus retain'd as learned council can  Each case however bad he'll new japan  And by a quick transition plainly show  'Twas no defect of your's but  pocket low  That caus'd his  putrid kennel  to o'erflow"  The last lines are certainly executed in a very masterly manner It is of that species of argumentation called the perplexing It effectually flings the antagonist into a mist there's no answering it the laugh is raised against  him while he is endeavouring to find out the jest At once he shews that the author has a kennel and that this kennel is putrid and that this putrid kennel overflows But why does it overflow It overflows because the author happens to have low pockets  There was also another new attempt in this way a prosaic Epigram which came out upon this occasion This is so full of matter that a critic might split it into fifteen Epigrams each properly fitted with its sting You shall see it  To G C and R L  "'Twas you or I or he or all together  'Twas one both three of them they know not whether  This I believe between us great or small  You I he wrote it not'twas Churchill's all  There there's a perplex I could have wished to make it quite perfect the author as in the case before had added notes Almost every word admits a scholium and a long one too I YOU HE Suppose a stranger should ask and who are you Here are three obscure persons spoken of that may in a short time be utterly forgotten Their names should have consequently been mentioned in notes at the bottom But when the reader comes to the words  great  and  small  the maze is inextricable Here the stranger may dive for a mystery without ever reaching the bottom Let him know then that  small  is a word purely  introduced to make good rhyme and  great  was a very proper word to keep  small  company  Yet by being thus a spectator of others dangers I must own I begin to tremble in this literary contest for my own I begin to fear that my challenge to Doctor Rock was unadvised and has procured me more antagonists than I had at first expected I have received private letters from several of the literati here that fill my soul with apprehension I may safely aver that  I never gave any creature in this good city offence  except only my rival Doctor Rock yet by the letters I every day receive and by some I have seen printed I am arraigned at one time as being a dull fellow at another as being pert I am here petulant there I am heavy by the head of my ancestors they treat me with more inhumanity than a flying fish If I dive and run my nose to the bottom there a devouring shark is ready to swallow me up If I skim the surface a pack of dolphins are at my tail to snap me but when I take wing and attempt to escape them by flight I become a prey to every ravenous bird that winnows the bosom of the deep  Adieu  LETTER CXI  To the same  THE Formalities delays and disappointments that precede a treaty of marriage here are usually as numerous as those previous to a treaty of peace The laws of this country are finely calculated  to promote all commerce but the commerce between the sexes Their encouragements for propagating hemp madder and tobacco are indeed admirable Marriages are the only commodity that meet with none  Yet from the vernal softness of the air the verdure of the fields the transparency of the streams and the beauty of the women I know few countries more proper to invite to courtship Here love might sport among painted lawns and warbling groves and revel upon gales wafting at once both fragrance and harmony Yet it seems he has forsaken the island and when a couple are now to be married mutual love or an union of minds is the last and most trifling consideration If their goods and chattles can be brought to unite their sympathetic souls are ever ready to guarantee the treaty The gentleman's mortgaged lawn becomes enamoured of the ladies marriagable grove the match is struck up and both parties are piously in loveaccording to act of Parliament  Thus they who have fortune are possessed at least of something that is lovely but I actually pity those that have none I am told there was a time when Ladies with no other merit but youth virtue and beauty had a chance for husbands at least among the ministers of the church or the officers of the army The blush and innocence of sixteen was said to have a powerful influence over these two professions But of late all the little traffic of blushing ogling dimpling and smiling has been forbidden by an act in that case wisely made and provided A Lady's whole cargo of smiles sighs and whispers is declared utterly  contraband till she arrives in the warm latitudes of twentytwo where commodities of this nature are too often found to decay She is then permitted to dimple and smile when the dimples and smiles begin to forsake her and when perhaps grown ugly is charitably entrusted with an unlimited use of her charms Her lovers however by this time have forsaken her the captain has changed for another mistress the priest himself leaves her in solitude to bewail her virginity and she dies even without benefit of clergy  Thus you find the Europeans discouraging love with as much earnestness as the rudest savage of Sofala The Genius is surely now no more In every region I find enemies in arms to oppress him Avarice in Europe jealousy in Persia ceremony in China poverty among the Tartars and lust in Circassia are all prepared to oppose his power The Genius is certainly banished from earth though once adored under such a variety of forms He is no where to be found and all that the Ladies of each country can produce are but a few trifling reliques as instances of his former residence and favour  The genius of Love says the eastern Apologue had long resided in the happy plains of Abra where every breeze was health and every sound produced tranquility His temple at first was crowded but every age lessened the number of his votaries or cooled their devotion Perceiving therefore his altars at length quite deserted he was resolved to remove to some more propitious region and he apprized the fair sex of every country where he could hope for a proper reception  to assert their right to his presence among them In return to this proclamation embassies were sent from the Ladies of every part of the world to invite him and to display the superiority of their claims  And first the beauties of China appeared No country could compare with them for modesty either of look dress or behaviour their eyes were never lifted from the ground their robes of the most beautiful silk hid their hands bosom and neck while their faces only were left uncovered They indulged no airs that might express loose desire and they seemed to study only the graces of inanimate beauty Their black teeth and plucked eyebrows were however alledged by the Genius against them but he set them entirely aside when he came to examine their little feet  The beauties of Circassia next made their appearance They advanced hand in hand singing the most immodest airs and leading up a dance in the most luxurious attitudes Their dress was but half a covering the neck the left breast and all the limbs were exposed to view which after some time seemed rather to satiate than inflame desire The lily and the rose contended in forming their complexions and a soft sleepiness of eye added irresistible poignance to their charms but their beauties were obtruded not offered to their admirers they seemed to give rather than receive courtship and the genius of Love dismissed them as unworthy his regard since they exchanged the duties of love and made themselves not the pursued but the pursuing sex  The kingdom of Kashmire next produced its charming deputies This happy region seemed peculiarly sequestered by nature for his abode Shady mountains fenced it on one side from the scorching sun and seaborn breezes on the other gave peculiar luxuriance to the air Their complexions were of a bright yellow that appeared almost transparent while the crimson tulip seemed to blossom on their cheeks Their features and limbs were delicate beyond the statuary's power to express and their teeth whiter than their own ivory He was almost persuaded to reside among them when unfortunately one of the ladies talked of appointing his seraglio  In this procession the naked inhabitants of Southern America would not be left behind their charms were found to surpass whatever the warmest imagination could conceive and served to shew that beauty could be perfect even with the seeming disadvantage of a brown complexion But their savage education rendered them utterly unqualified to make the proper use of their power and they were rejected as being incapable of uniting mental with sensual satisfaction In this manner the deputies of other kingdoms had their suits rejected the black beauties of Benin and the tawny daughters of Borneo the women of Wida with well scarred faces and the hideous virgins of Cafraria the squab ladies of Lapland three feet high and the giant fair ones of Patagonia  The beauties of Europe at last appeared grace was in their steps and sensibility sate smiling in every eye It was the universal opinion while they were approaching that they would prevail  and the Genius seemed to lend them his most favourable attention They opened their pretensions with the utmost modesty but unfortunately as their orator proceeded she happened to let fall the words  house in town settlement and pinmoney  These seemingly harmless terms had instantly a surprising effect the Genius with ungovernable rage burst from amidst the circle and waving his youthful pinions left this earth and flew back to those etherial mansions from whence he descended  The whole assembly was struck with amazement they now justly apprehended that female power would be no more since love had forsaken them They continued some time thus in a state of torpid despair when it was proposed by one of the number▪ that since the real Genius had left them in order to continue their power they should set up an idol in his stead and that the ladies of every country should furnish him with what each liked best This proposal was instantly relished and agreed to An idol was formed by uniting the capricious gifts of all the assembly tho' no way resembling the departed Genius The ladies of China furnished the monster with wings those of Kashmire supplied him with horns the dames of Europe clapped a purse in his hand and the virgins of Congo furnished him with a tail Since that time all the vows addressed to love are in reality paid to the idol but as in other false religions the adoration seems most fervent where the heart is least sincere Adieu  LETTER CXII  To the same  MANKIND have ever been prone to expatiate in the praise of human nature The dignity of man is a subject that has always been the favourite theme of humanity they have declaimed with that ostentation which usually accompanies such as are sure of having a partial audience they have obtained victories because there were none to oppose Yet from all I have ever read or seen men appear more apt to err by having too high than by having too despicable an opinion of their nature and by attempting to exalt their original place in the creation depress their real value in society  The most ignorant nations have always been found to think most highly of themselves The Deity has ever been thought peculiarly concerned in their glory and preservation to have fought their battles and inspired their teachers their wizzards are said to be familiar with heaven and every hero has a guard of angels as well as men to attend him When the Portuguese first came among the wretched inhabitants of the coast of Africa these savage nations readily allowed the strangers more skill in navigation and war yet still considered them at best but as useful servants brought to their coasts by their guardian serpent to supply them with luxuries they could have lived without Though they could grant the Portuguese  more riches they could never allow them to have such a king as their Tottimondelem who wore a bracelet of shells round his neck and whose legs were covered with ivory  In this manner examine a savage in the history of his country and predecessors you ever find his warriors able to conquer armies and his sages acquainted with more than possible knowledge human nature is to him an unknown country he thinks it capable of great things because he is ignorant of its boundaries whatever can be conceived to be done he allows to be possible and whatever is possible he conjectures must have been done He never measures the actions and powers of others by what himself is able to perform nor makes a proper estimate of the greatness of his fellows by bringing it to the standard of his own incapacity He is satisfied to be one of a country where mighty things have been and imagines the fancied power of others reflects a lustre on himself Thus by degrees he loses the idea of his own insignificance in a confused notion of the extraordinary powers of humanity and is willing to grant extraordinary gifts to every pretender because unacquainted with their claims  This is the reason why Demigods and Heroes have ever been erected in times or countries of ignorance and barbarity they addressed a people who had high opinions of human nature because they were ignorant how far it could extend they addressed a people who were willing to allow that men should be gods because they were yet imperfectly acquainted with God and with man These impostors knew that all men are naturally  fond of seeing something very great made from the little materials of humanity that ignorant nations are not more proud of building a tower to reach heaven or a pyramid to last for ages than of raising up a Demigod of their own country and creation The same pride that erects a colossus or a pyramid installs a God or an Hero but though the adoring savage can raise his colossus to the clouds he can exalt the Hero not one inch above the standard of humanity incapable therefore of exalting the idol he debases himself and falls prostrate before him  When man has thus acquired an erroneous idea of the dignity of his species he and the Gods become perfectly intimate men are but angels angels are but men nay but servants that stand in waiting to execute human commands The Persians for instance thus address their prophet Haly  Chardins' Travels p  'I salute thee glorious Creator of whom the sun is but the shadow Masterpiece of the Lord of human creatures great star of justice and religion The sea is not rich and liberal but by the gifts of thy munificent hands The angel treasurer of heaven reaps his harvest in the fertile gardens of the purity of thy nature The primum mobile would never dart the ball of the sun through the trunk of heaven were it not to serve the morning out of the extreme love she has for thee The angel Gabriel messenger of truth every day kisses the groundsil of thy gate Were there a place more exalted than the most high throne of God I would affirm it to be thy place O master of the faithful Gabriel with all his art and knowledge is but a meer scholar to thee' Thus my  friend men think proper to treat angels but if indeed there be such an order of beings with what a degree of satirical contempt must they listen to the songs of little mortals thus flattering each other Thus to see creatures wiser indeed than the monkey and more active than the oyster claiming to themselves the mastery of heaven minims the tenants of an atom thus arrogating a a partnership in the creation of universal nature Sure heaven is kind that launches no thunder at those guilty heads but it is kind and regards their follies with pity nor will destroy creatures that it loved into being  But whatever success this practice of making Demigods might have been attended with in barbarous nations I don't know that any man became a God in a country where the inhabitants were refined Such countries generally have too close an inspection into human weakness to think it invested with celestial power They sometimes indeed admit the Gods of strangers or of their ancestors which had their existence in times of obscurity their weakness being forgotten while nothing but their power and their miracles were remembred The Chinese for instance never had a God of their own country the idols which the vulgar worship at this day were brought from the barbarous nations around them The Roman Emperors who pretended to divinity were generally ta  ght by a poignard that they were mortal and Alexander though he passed among barbarous countries for a real God could never persuade his polite countrymen into a similitude of thinking The Lacedemonians shrewdly complied with his commands by the following sarcastic edict    Adieu  LETTER CXIII  To the same  THERE is something irresistibly pleasing in the conversation of a fine woman even though her tongue be silent the eloquence of her eyes teaches wisdom The mind sympathizes with the regularity of the object in view and struck with external grace vibrates into respondent harmony In this agreeable disposition I lately found myself in company with my friend and his niece Our conversation turned upon love which she seemed equally capable of defending and inspiring We were each of different opinions upon this subject the lady insisted that it was a natural and universal passion and produced the happiness of those who cultivated it with proper precaution My friend denied it to be the work of nature but allowed it to have a real existence and affirmed that it was of infinite service in refining society while I to keep up the dispute affirmed it to be merely a name first used by the cunning part of the fair sex and admitted by the silly part of ours therefore no way more natural than taking snuff or chewing opium  "How is it possible cried I that such a passion can be natural when our opinions even of beauty which inspires it are entirely the result of fashion and caprice The ancients who pretended to be connoisseurs in the art have praised narrow foreheads red hair and eyebrows that joined each other over the nose Such were the charms that  once captivated Catullus Ovid and Anacreon Ladies would at present be out of humour if their lovers praised them for such graces and should an antique beauty now revive her face would certainly be put under the discipline of the tweezer foreheadcloth and lead comb before it could be seen in public company"  "But the difference between the antients and moderns is not so great as between the different countries of the present world A lover of Gongora for instance sighs for thick lips a Chinese lover is poetical in praise of thin In Circassia a streight nose is thought most consistent with beauty cross but a mountain which separates it from the Tartars and there flat noses tawny skins and eyes three inches asunder are all the fashion In Persia and some other countries a man when he marries chuses to have his bride a maid in the Phillipine Islands if a bridegroom happens to perceive on the first night that he is put off with a virgin the marriage is declared void to all intents and purposes and the bride sent back with disgrace In some parts of the East a woman of beauty properly fed up for sale often amounts to one hundred crowns in the kingdom of Loango Ladies of the very best fashion are sold for a pig Queens however sell better and sometimes amount to a cow In short turn even to England don't I there see the beautiful part of the sex neglected and none now marrying or making love but old men and old women that have saved money Don't I see beauty from fifteen to twenty one rendered null and void to all intents and purposes and those six precious years of womanhood put under a  statute of virginity What shall I call that rancid passion love which passes between an old batchelor of fiftysix and a widow lady of fortynine Never never What advantage is society to reap from an intercourse where the big belly is oftnest on the man's side Would any persuade me that such a passion was natural unless the human race were more fit for love as they approach'd the decline and like silkworms became breeders just before they expired"  Whether love be natural or no replied my friend gravely it contributes to the happiness of every society into which it is introduced All our pleasures are short and can only charm at intervals love is a method of protracting our greatest pleasure and surely that gamester who plays the greatest stake to the best advantage will at the end of life rise victorious This was the opinion of Vanini who affirmed that  every hour was lost which was not spent in love  His accusers were unable to comprehend his meaning and the poor advocate for love was burned in flames alas no way metaphorical But whatever advantages the individual may reap from this passion society will certainly be refined and improved by its introduction All laws calculated to discourage it tend to embrute the species and weaken the state Though it cannot plant morals in the human breast it cultivates them when there pity generosity and honour receive a brighter polish from its assistance and a single amour is sufficient entirely to brush off the clown  But it is an exotic of the most delicate constitution it requires the greatest art to introduce it  into a state and the smallest discouragement is sufficient to repress it again Let us only consider with what ease it was formerly extinguished in Rome and with what difficulty it was lately revived in Europe it seemed to sleep for ages and at last fought its way among us through tilts tournaments dragons and all the dreams of chivalry The rest of the world China only excepted are and have ever been utter strangers to its delights and advantages In other countries as men find themselves stronger than women they lay a claim to a rigorous superiority this is natural and love which gives up this natural advantage must certainly be the effect of art An art calculated to lengthen out our happier moments and add new graces to society  I entirely acquiesce in your sentiments says the lady with regard to the advantages of this passion but cannot avoid giving it a nobler origin than you have been pleased to assign I must think that those countries where it is rejected are obliged to have recourse to art to stifle so natural a production and those nations where it is cultivated only make nearer advances to nature The same efforts that are used in some places to suppress pity and other natural passions may have been employed to extinguish love No nation however unpolished is remarkable for innocence that is not famous for passion it has flourished in the coldest as well as the warmest regions Even in the sultry wilds of southern America the lover is not satisfied with possessing his mistress's person without having her mind  In all my Enna's beauties blest  Amidst profusion still I pine  Far tho' she gives me up her breast  Its panting tenant is not mine  Translation of a South American Ode    But the effects of love are too violent to be the result of an artificial passion Nor is it in the power of fashion to force the constitution into those changes which we every day observe Several have died of it Few lovers are unacquainted with the fate of the two Italian lovers Da Corsin and Julia Bellamano who after a long separation expired with pleasure in each others arms Such instances are too strong confirmations of the reality of the passion and serve to shew that suppressing it is but opposing the natural dictates of the heart  Adieu  LETTER CXIV  To the same  THE clock just struck two the expiring taper rises and sinks in the socket the watchman forgets the hour in slumber the laborious and the happy are at rest and nothing wakes but meditation guilt revelry and despair The drunkard once more fills the destroying bowl the robber walks his  midnight round and the suicide lifts his guilty arm against his own sacred person  Let me no longer waste the night over the page of antiquity or the sallies of cotemporary genius but pursue the solitary walk where vanity ever changing but a few hours past walked before me where she kept up the pageant and now like a froward child seems hushed with her own importunities  What a gloom hangs all around the dying lamp feebly emits a yellow gleam no sound is heard but of the chiming clock or the distant watchdog All the bustle of human pride is forgotten an hour like this may well display the emptiness of human vanity  There will come a time when this temporary solitude may be made continual and the city itself like its inhabitants fade away and leave a desart in its room  What cities as great as this have once triumphed in existence had their victories as great joy as just and as unbounded and with shortsighted presumption promised themselves immortality Posterity can hardly trace the situation of some The sorrowful traveller wanders over the awful ruins of others and as he beholds he learns wisdom and feels the transience of every sublunary possession  Here he cries stood their citadel now grown over with weeds there their senatehouse but now the haunt of every noxious reptile temples  and theatres stood here now only an undistinguished heap of ruin They are fallen for luxury and avarice first made them feeble The rewards of state were conferred on amusing and not on useful members of society Their riches and opulence invited the invaders who though at first repulsed returned again conquered by perseverance and at last swept the defendants into undistinguished destruction  How few appear in those streets which but some few hours ago were crowded and those who appear now no longer wear their daily mask nor attempt to hide their lewdness or their misery  But who are those who make the streets their couch and find a short repose from wretchedness at the doors of the oppulent These are strangers wanderers and orphans whose circumstances are too humble to expect redress and whose distresses are too great even for pity Their wretchedness excites rather horror than pity Some are without the covering even of rags and others emaciated with disease the world has disclaimed them society turns its back upon their distress and has given them up to nakedness and hunger These poor shivering females have once seen happier days and been flattered into beauty They have been prostituted to the gay luxurious villain and are now turned out to meet the severity of winter Perhaps now lying at the doors of their betrayers they sue to wretches whose hearts are insensible or debauchees who may curse but will not relieve them  Why why was I born a man and yet see the sufferings of wretches I cannot relieve Poor houseless creatures the world will give you reproaches but will not give you relief The slightest misfortunes of the great the most imaginary uneasinesses of the rich are aggravated with all the power of eloquence and held up to engage our attention and sympathetic sorrow The poor weep unheeded persecuted by every subordinate species of tyranny and every law which gives others security becomes an enemy to them  Why was this heart of mine formed with so much sensibility or why was not my fortune adapted to its impulse Tenderness without a capacity of relieving only makes the man who feels it more wretched than the object which sues for assistance Adieu  LETTER CXV  Fum Hoam to Lien Chi Altangi the discontented wanderer by the way of Moscow  I HAVE been just sent upon an embassy to Japan my commission is to be dispatched in f  ur days and you can hardly conceive the pleasure I shall find upon revisiting my native country I shall leave with joy this proud barbarous inhospitable region where every object conspires to diminish my satisfaction and encrease my patriotism  But tho' I find the inhabitants savage yet the Dutch merchants who are permitted to trade hither seem still more detestable They have raised my dislike to Europe in general by them I learn how low avarice can degrade human nature how many indignities an European will suffer for gain  I was present at an audience given by the Emperor to the Dutch envoy who had sent several presents to all the courtiers some days previous to his admission but he was obliged to attend those designed for the Emperor himself From the accounts I had heard of this ceremony my curiosity prompted me to be a spectator of the whole  First went the pressents set out on beautiful enamelled tables adorned with flowers borne on mens shoulders and followed by Japonese music and dancers From so great respect paid to the gifts themselves I had fancied the donors must have received almost divine honours But about a quarter of an hour after the presents had been carried in triumph the envoy and his train were brought forward They were covered from head to foot with long black vails which prevented their seeing each led by a conductor chosen from the meanest of the people In this dishonourable manner having traversed the city of Jedo they at length arrived at the palace gate and after waiting half an hour were admitted into the guard room Here their eyes were uncovered and in about an hour the gentleman usher introduced them into the hall of audience The Emperor was at length shewn sitting in a kind of Alcove at the upper end of the room and the Dutch envoy was conducted towards the throne  As soon as he had approach'd within a certain distance the gentleman usher cried out with a loud voice  Holanda Capitan  upon these words the envoy fell flat upon the ground and crept upon his hands and feet towards the throne Still approaching he rear'd himself upon his knees and then bowed his forehead to the ground These ceremonies being over he was directed to withdraw still groveling on his belly and going backward like a lobster  Men must be excessively fond of riches when they are earned with such circumstances of abject submission Do the Europeans worship Heaven it self with marks of more profound respect Do they confer those honours on the Supreme of beings which they pay to a barbarous king who gives them a permission to purchase trinkets and porcelaine What a glorious exchange to forfeit their national honour and even their title to humanity for a screen or a snuffbox  If these ceremonies essayed in the first audience appeared mortifying those which are practised in the second are infinitely more so In the second audience the Emperor and the ladies of court were placed behind lattices in such a manner as to see without being seen Here all the Europeans were directed to pass in review and grovel and act the serpent as before with this spectacle the whole court seemed highly delighted The strangers were asked a thousand ridiculous questions as their names and their ages They were ordered to write to stand upright to sit to stop to compliment each other to be drunk to speak the Japanese language to talk  Dutch to sing to eat in short they were ordered to do all that could satisfy the curiosity of women  Imagine my dear Altangi a set of grave men thus transformed into buffoons and acting a part every whit as honourable as that of those instructed animals which are shewn in the streets of Pekin to the mob on a holiday Yet the ceremony did not end here for every great Lord of the court was to be visited in the same manner and their ladies who took the whim from their husbands were all equally fond of seeing the strangers perform even the children seeming highly diverted with the dancing Dutchmen  Alas cried I to myself upon returning from such a spectacle is this the nation which assumes such dignity at the court of Pekin Is this that people that appear so proud at home and in every country where they have the least authority How does a love of gain transform the gravest of mankind into the most contemptible and ridiculous I had rather continue poor all my life than become rich at such a rate Perish those riches which are acquired at the expence of my honour or my humanity Let me quit said I a country where there are none but such as treat all others like slaves and more detestible still in suffering such treatment I have seen enough of this nation to desire to see more of others Let me leave a people suspicious to excess whose morals are corrupted and equally debased by superstition and vice where the sciences are left uncultivated where the Great are slaves to the Prince and tyrants to the people where the women are chaste  only when debarred of the power of transgression where the true disciples of Confucius are not less persecuted than those of Christianity in a word a country where men are forbidden to think and consequently labour under the most miserable slavery that of mental servitude  Adieu  LETTER CXVI  To the same  THE misfortunes of the great my friend are held up to engage our attention are enlarged upon in tones of declamation and the world is called upon to gaze at the noble sufferers they have at once the comfort of admiration and pity  Yet where is the magnanimity of bearing misfortunes when the whole world is looking on Men in such circumstances can act bravely even from motives of vanity He only who in the vale of obscurity can brave adversity who without friends to encourage acquaintances to pity or even without hope to alleviate his distresses can behave with tranquility and indifference is truly great whether peasant or courtier he deserves admiration and should be held up for our imitation and respect  The miseries of the poor are however entirely disregarded tho' some undergo more real hardships in one day than the great in their whole lives It is indeed inconceiveable what difficulties  the meanest English sailor or soldier endures without murmuring or regret Every day is to him a day of misery and yet he bears his hard fate without repining  With what indignation do I hear the heroes of tragedy complain of misfortunes and hardships whose greatest calamity is founded in arrogance and pride Their severest distresses are pleasures compared to what many of the adventuring poor every day sustain without murmuring These may eat drink and sleep have slaves to attend them and are sure of subsistence for life while many of their fellowcreatures are obliged to wander without a friend to comfort or to assist them find enmity in every law and are too poor to obtain even justice  I have been led into these reflections from accidentally meeting some days ago a poor fellow begging at one of the outlets of this town with a wooden leg I was curious to learn what had reduced him to his present situation and after giving him what I thought proper desired to know the history of his life and misfortunes and the manner in which he was reduced to his present distress The disabled soldier for such he was with an intrepidity truly British leaning on his crutch put himself into an attitude to comply with my request and gave me his history as follows  As for misfortunes Sir I can't pretend to have gone through more than others Except the loss of my limb and my being obliged to beg I don't know any reason thank heaven that I have to complain there are some who have lost  both legs and an eye but thank heaven it is not quite so bad with me  My father was a labourer in the country and died when I was five years old so I was put upon the parish As he had been a wandering sort of a man the parishioners were not able to tell to what parish I belonged or where I was born so they sent me to another parish and that parish sent me to a third till at last it was thought I belonged to no parish at all At length however they fixed me I had some disposition to be a scholar and had actually learned my letters but the master of the workhouse put me to business as soon as I was able to handle a mallet  Here I lived an easy kind of a life for five years I only wrought ten hours in the day and had my meat and drink provided for my labour It is true I was not suffered to stir far from the house for fear I should run away but what of that I had the liberty of the whole house and the yard before the door and that was enough for me  I was next bound out to a farmer where I was up both early and late but I ate and drank well and liked my business well enough till he died Being then obliged to provide for myself I was resolved to go and seek my fortune Thus I lived and went from town to town working when I could get employment and starving when I could get none and might have lived so still But happening one day to go through a field belonging to a magistrate I spy'd a hare crossing  the path just before me I believe the devil put it in my head to fling my stick at it well what will you have on't I killed the hare and was bringing it away in triumph when the justice himself met me he called me a villain and collaring me desired I would give an account of myself I began immediately to give a full account of all that I knew of my breed seed and generation but though I gave a very long account the justice said I could give no account of myself so I was indicted and found guilty of being poor and sent to Newgate in order to be transported to the plantations  People may say this and that of being in jail but for my part I found Newgate as agreeable a place as ever I was in in all my life I had my belly full to eat and drink and did no work but alas this kind of life was too good to last for ever I was taken out of prison after five months put on board of a ship and sent off with two hundred more Our passage was but indifferent for we were all confined in the hold and died very fast for want of sweet air and provisions but for my part I did not want meat because I had a fever all the way providence was kind when provisions grew short it took away my desire of eating When we came ashore we were sold to the planters I was bound for seven years and as I was no scholar for I had forgot my letters I was obliged to work among the negroes and served out my time as in duty bound to do  When my time was expired I worked my passage home and glad I was to see Old England  again because I loved my country O liberty liberty liberty that is the property of every Englishman and I will die in its defence I was afraid however that I should be indicted for a vagabond once more so did not much care to go into the country but kept about town and did little jobs when I could get them I was very happy in this manner for some time till one evening coming home from work two men knocked me down and then desired me to stand still They belonged to a pressgang I was carried before the justice and as I could give no account of my self that was the thing that always hobbled me I had my choice left whether to go on board a man of war or list for a soldier I chose to be a soldier and in this post of a gentleman I served two campaigns was at the battles in Flanders and received but one wound through the breast which is troublesome to this day  When the peace came on I was discharged and as I could not work because my wound was sometimes painful I listed for a landman in the East India company's service I here fought the French in six pitched battles and verily believe that if I could read or write our captain would have given me promotion and made me a corporal But that was not my good fortune I soon fell sick and when I became good for nothing got leave to return home again with forty pounds in my pocket which I saved in the service This was at the beginning of the present war so I hoped to be set on shore and to have the pleasure of spending my money but the government wanted men and I was  pressed again before ever I could set foot on shore  The boatswain found me as he said an obstinate fellow he swore that I understood my business perfectly well but that I pretended sickness merely to be idle God knows I knew nothing of seabusiness He beat me without considering what he was about But still my forty pounds was some comfort to me under every beating the money was my comfort and the money I might have had to this day but that our ship was taken by the French and so I lost it all  Our crew was carried into a French prison and many of them died because they were not used to live in a jail but for my part it was nothing to me for I was seasoned One night however as I was sleeping on the bed of boards with a warm blanket about me for I always loved to lie well I was awaked by the boatswain who had a dark lanthorn in his hand 'Jack says he to me will you knock out the French centry's brains' 'I don't care says I striving to keep myself awake if I lend a hand' 'Then follow me says he and I hope we shall do business' So up I got and tied my blanket which was all the cloaths I had about my middle and went with him to fight the Frenchmen we had no arms but one Englishman is able to beat five French at any time so we went down to the door where both the centries were posted and rushing upon them seized their arms in a moment and knocked them down From thence nine of us ran together to the  key and seizing the first boat we met got out of the harbour and put to sea we had not been here three days before we were taken up by an English privateer who was glad of so many good hands and we consented to run our chance However we had not so much luck as we expected In three days we fell in with a French man of war of forty guns while we bad but twenty three so to it we went The fight lasted for three hours and I verily believe we should have taken the Frenchman but unfortunately we lost almost all our men just as we were going to get the victory I was once more in the power of the French and I believe it would have gone hard with me had I been brought back to my old jail in Brest but by good fortune we were retaken and carried to England once more  I had almost forgot to tell you that in this last engagement I was wounded in two places I lost four fingers of the left hand and my leg was shot off Had I the good fortune to have lost my leg and use of my hand on board a king's ship and not a privateer I should have been entitled to cloathing and maintenance during the rest of my life but that was not my chance one man is born with a silver spoon in his mouth and another with a wooden ladle However blessed be God I enjoy good health and have no enemy in this world that I know of but the French and the Justice of Peace  Thus saying he limped off leaving my friend and me in admiration of his intrepidity and content nor could we avoid acknowledging that an habitual acquaintance with misery is the truest school of fortitude and philosophy Adieu  LETTER CXVI  From the same  THE titles of European Princes are rather more numerous than ours of Asia but by no means so sublime The king of Visapour or Pegu not satisfied with claiming the globe and all its appurtenances to him and his heirs asserts a property even in the firmament and extends his orders to the milky way The monarchs of Europe with more modesty confine their titles to earth but make up by number what is wanting in their sublimity Such is their passion for a long list of these splendid trifles that I have known a German Prince with more titles than subjects and a Spanish nobleman with more names than shirts  Contrary to this "The English monarchs says a writer of the last century disdain to accept of such titles which tend only to encrease their pride without improving their glory they are above depending on the feeble helps of heraldry for respect perfectly satisfied with the consciousness of acknowledged power" At present however these maxims are laid aside the English monarchs have of late assumed new titles and have impressed their coins with the names and arms of obscure dukedoms petty states and subordinate employments Their design in this I make no doubt was laudably to add new lustre to the British throne but in reality paltry claims only serve to diminish that respect they are designed to secure  There is in the honours assumed by Kings as in the decorations of architecture a majestic simplicity which best conduces to inspire our reverence and respect numerous and trifling ornaments in either are strong indications of meanness in the designer or of concealed deformity should for instance the Emperor of China among other titles assume that of Deputy Mandarin of Maccau or the Monarch of Great Britain France and Ireland desire to be acknowledged as Duke of Brentford Lunenburg or Lincoln the observer revolts at this mixture of important and paltry claims and forgets the Emperor in his familiarity with the Duke or the Deputy  I remember a similar instance of this inverted ambition in the illustrious King of Manacabo upon his first treaty with the Portuguese Among the presents that were made him by the ambassador of that nation was a sword with a brass hilt which he seemed to set a peculiar value upon This he thought too great an acquisition to his glory to be forgotten among the number of his titles He therefore gave orders that his subjects should style him for the future  Talipot the immortal Potentate of Manacabo Messenger of Morning Enlightener of the Sun Possessor of the the whole Earth and mighty Monarch of the Brasshandled Sword  This method of mixing majestic and paltry titles of quartering the arms of a great Empire and an obscure province upon the same medal here had its rise in the virtuous partiality of their late Monarchs Willing to testify an affection to their native country they gave its name and ensigns a  place upon their coins and thus in some measure enobled its obscurity It was indeed but just that a people which had given England up their King should receive some honorary equivalent in return but at present these motives are no more England has now a Monarch wholly British and it has some reason to hope for British titles upon British coins  However were the money of England designed to circulate in Germany there would be no flagrant impropriety in impressing it with German names and arms but though this might have been so upon former occasions I am told there is no danger of it for the future as England therefore designs to keep back its gold I candidly think Lunenburg Oldenburgh and the rest of them may very well keep back their titles  It is a mistaken prejudice in Princes to think that a number of loud sounding names can give new claims to respect The truly great have ever disdained them When Timur the Lame had conquered Asia an orator by profession came to compliment him upon the occasion He began his harrangue by styling him the most omnipotent and the most glorious object of the creation the Emperor seemed displeased with his paltry adulation yet still he went on complimenting him as the most mighty the most valiant and the most perfect of beings Hold there my friend cries the lame Emperor hold there till I have got another leg In fact the feeble or the despotic alone find pleasure in multiplying these pageants of vanity but strength and freedom have nobler aims  and often find the finest adulation in majestic simplicity  The young Monarch of this country has already testified a proper contempt for several unmeaning appendages on royalty cooks and scullions have been obliged to quit their fires gentlemens gentlemen and the whole tribe of  necessary people  who did nothing have been dismissed from further services A youth who can thus bring back simplicity and frugality to a court will soon probably have a true respect for his own glory and while he has dismissed all useless employments may disdain to accept of empty or degrading titles Adieu  LETTER CXVII  From the same  WHENEVER I attempt to characterize the English in general some unforeseen difficulties constantly occur to disconcert my design I hesitate between censure and praise when I consider them as a reasoning philosophical people they have my applause but when I reverse the medal and observe their inconstancy and irresolution I can scarcely persuade my self that I am observing the same people  Yet upon examination this very inconstancy so remarkable here flows from no other source than  their love of reasoning The man who examines a complicated subject on every side and calls in reason to his assistance will frequently change will find himself distracted by opposing probabilities and contending proofs every alteration of place will diversify the prospect will give some latent argument new force aad contribute to maintain an anarchy in the mind  On the contrary they who never examine with their own reason act with more simplicity Ignonance is positive instinct perseveres and the human being moves in safety within the narrow circle of brutal uniformity What is true with regard to individuals is not less so when applied to states A reasoning government like this is in continual fluctuation while those kingdoms where men are taught not to controvert but obey continue always the same In Asia for instance where the monarch's authority is supported by force and acknowledged through fear a change of government is entirely unknown All the inhabitants seem to wear the same mental complection and remain contented with hereditary oppression The sovereign's pleasure is the ultimate rule of duty every branch of the administration is a perfect epitome of the whole and if one tyrant is deposed another starts up in his room to govern as his predecessor The English on the contrary instead of being led by power endeavour to guide themselves by reason instead of appealing to the pleasure of the prince appeal to the original rights of mankind What one rank of men assert is denied by others as the reasons on opposite sides happen to come home with greater  or less conviction The people of Asia are directed by precedent which never alters the English by reason which is ever changing its appearance  The disadvantages of an Asiatic government acting in this manner by precedent are evident original errors are thus continued without hopes of redress and all marks of genius are levelled down to one standard since no superiority of thinking can be allowed its exertion in mending obvious defects But to recompence those defects their governments undergo no new alterations they have no new evils to fear nor no fermentations in the constitution that continue the struggle for power is soon over and all becomes tranquil as before they are habituated to subordination and men are taught to form no other desires than those which they are allowed to satisfy  The disadvantages of a government acting from the immediate influence of reason like that of England are not less than those of the former It is extremely difficult to induce a number of free beings to cooperate for their mutual benefit every possible advantage will necessarily be sought and every attempt to procure it must be attended with a new fermentation various reasons will lead different ways and equity and advantage will often be outballanced by a combination of clamour and prejudice But though such a people may be thus in the wrong they have been influenced by an happy delusion their errors are seldom seen till they are felt each man is himself the tyrant he has obeyed and such a master he can easily forgive The disadvantages he feels  may in reality be equal to what is felt in the most despotic government but man will bear every calamity with patience when he knows himself to be the author of his own misfortunes Adieu  LETTER CXVIII  From the same  MY long residence here begins to fatigue me as every object ceases to be new it no longer continues to be pleasing some minds are so fond of variety that pleasure it self if permanent would be insupportable and we are thus obliged to solicit new happiness even by courting distress I only therefore wait the arrival of my son to vary this trifling scene and borrow new pleasure from danger and fatigue A life I own thus spent in wandring from place to place is at best but empty dissipation But to pursue trifles is the lot of humanity and whether we bustle in a pantomime or strut at a coronation whether we shout at a bonefire or harrangue in a senatehouse whatever object we follow it will at last surely conduct us to futility and disappointment The wise bustle and laugh as they walk in the pageant but fools bustle and are important and this probably is all the difference between them  This may be an apology for the levity of my former correspondence I talked of trifles and I knew that they were trifles to make the things of this life ridiculous it was only sufficient to call them by their names  In other respects I have omitted several striking circumstances in the description of this country as supposing them either already known to you or as not being thoroughly known to myself But there is one omission for which I expect no forgiveness namely my being totally silent upon their buildings roads rivers and mountains This is a branch of science on which all other travellers are so very prolix that my deficiency will appear the more glaring With what pleasure for instance do some read of a traveller in Egypt measuring a fallen column with his cane and finding it exactly five feet nine inches long of his creeping through the mouth of a catacomb and coming out by a different hole from that he entered of his stealing the finger of an antique statue in spite of the janizary that watch'd him or his adding a new conjecture to the hundred and fourteen conjectures already published upon the names of  Osu is  and  Isis  Methinks I hear some of my friends in China demanding a similar account of London and the adjacent villages and if I remain here much longer it is probable I may gratify their curiosity I intend when run dry on other topics to take a serious survey of the Citywall to describe that beautiful building the MansionHouse I will enumerate the magnificent squares in which the nobility chiefly reside and the Royal Palaces appointed for the reception of the English Monarch nor will I forget the beauties of ShoeLane in which I my self have resided since my arrival You shall find me no way inferior to many of my brother travellers in the arts of description At present  however as a specimen of this way of writing I send you a few hasty remarks collected in a late journey I made to Kentish Town  and this in the manner of modern voyagers  Having heard much of Kentish Town I conceived a strong desire to see that celebrated place I could have wish'd indeed to satisfy my curiosity without going thither but that was impracticable and therefore I resolved to go Travellers have two methods of going to Kentish Town they take coach which costs nine pence or they may go a foot which costs nothing in my opinion a coach is by far the most eligible convenience but I was resolved to go on foot having considered with my self that going in that manner would be the cheapest way  As you set out from Doghouse bar you enter upon a fine level road railed in on both sides commanding on the right a fine prospect of groves and fields enamelled with flowers which would wonderfully charm the sense of smelling were it not for a dunghill on the left which mixes its effluvia with their odours This dunghill is of much greater antiquity than the road and I must not omit a piece of injustice I was going to commit upon this occasion My indignation was levelled against the makers of the dunghill for having brought it so near the road whereas it should have fallen upon the makers of the road for having brought that so near the dunghill  After proceeding in this manner for some time a building resembling somewhat a triumphal arch salutes the traveller's view This structure however  is peculiar to this country and vulgarly call'd a turnpike gate I could perceive a long inscription in large characters on the front probably upon the occasion of some triumph but being in haste I left it to be made out by some subsequent adventurer who may happen to travel this way so continuing my course to the west I soon arrived at an unwalled town called Islington  Islington is a pretty neat town mostly built of brick with a church and bells It has a small lake or rather pond in the midst tho' at present very much neglected I am told it is dry in summer if this be the case it can be no very proper receptacle for fish of which the inhabitants themselves seem sensible by bringing all that is eaten there from London  After having surveyed the curiosities of this fair and beautiful town I proceeded forward leaving a fair stone building called the White Conduit House on my right here the inhabitants of London often assemble to celebrate a feast of hot rolls and butter seeing such numbers each with their little tables before them employed on this occasion must no doubt be a very amusing sight to the looker on but still more so to those who perform in the solemnity  From hence I parted with reluctance to  Pancrass  as it is written or  Pancridge  as it is pronounced but which should be both pronounced and written  Pangrace  This emendation I will venture meo arbitrio  in the Greek language  signifies all which added to the English word  grace  maketh  all grace  or  Pangrace  and indeed this is a very proper appellation to a place of so much sanctity as Pangrace is universally esteemed However this be if you except the parish church and its fine bells there is little in Pangrace worth the attention of the curious observer  From Pangrace to Kentish town is an easy journey of one mile and a quarter The road lies through a fine champain country well watered with beautiful drains and enamelled with flowers of all kinds which might contribute to charm every sense were it not that the odoriferous gales are often more impregnated with dust than perfume  As you enter Kentish town the eye is at once presented with the shops of artificers such as venders of candles smallcoal and hair brooms there are also several august buildings of red brick with numberless signposts or rather pillars in a peculiar order of architecture I send you a drawing of several vide A B C This pretty town probably borrows its name from its vicinity to the county of Kent And indeed it is not unnatural that it should as there are only London and the adjacent villages that lie between them Be this as it will perceiving night approach I made a hasty repast on roasted mutton and a certain dried fruit called potatoes resolving to protract my remarks upon my return And this I would very willingly have done but was prevented by a circumstance which in truth I had for some time foreseen for night coming  on it was impossible to take a proper survey of the country as I was obliged to return home in the dark  Adieu  LETTER CXIX  To the same  AFTER a variety of disapointments my wishes are at length fully satisfied My son so long expected is arrived at once by his presence banishing my anxiety and opening a new scene of unexpected pleasure His improvements in mind and person have far surpass'd even the sanguine expectations of a father I left him a boy but he is returned a man pleasing in his person hardened by travel and polished by adversity His disappointment in love however had infused an air of melancholy into his conversation which seemed at intervals to interrupt our mutual satisfaction I expected that this could find a cure only from time but fortune as if willing to load us with her favours has in a moment repaid every uneasiness with rapture  Two days after his arrival the man in black with his beautiful niece came to congratulate us upon this pleasing occasion but guess our surprize when my friend's lovely kinswoman was found to be the very captive my son had rescued from Persia and who had been wreck'd on the Wolga and was carried by the Russian peasants  to the port of Archangel Were I to hold the pen of a novelist I might be prolix in describing their feelings at so unexpected an interview but you may conceive their joy without my assistance words were unable to express their transports then how can words describe it  When two young persons are sincerely enamoured of each other nothing can give me such pleasure as seeing them married whether I know the parties or not I am happy at thus binding one link more in the universal chain Nature has in some measure formed me for a matchmaker and given me a soul to sympathize with every mode of human felicity I instantly therefore consulted the man in black whether we might not crown their mutual wishes by marriage his soul seems formed of similar materials with mine he instantly gave his consent and the next day was appointed for the solemnization of their nuptials  All the acquaintances which I had made since my arrival were present at this gay solemnity The little beau was constituted master of the ceremonies and his wife Mrs Tibbs conducted the entertainment with proper decorum The man in black and the pawnbroker's widow were very sprightly and tender upon this occasion The widow was dressed up under the direction of Mrs Tibbs and as for her lover his face was set off by the assistance of a pigtail wig which was lent by the little beau to fit him for making love with proper formality The whole company easily perceived that it would be a double wedding before all was over and indeed  my friend and the widow seemed to make no secret of their passion he even called me aside in order to know my candid opinion whether I did not think him a little too old to be married As for my own part continued he I know I am going to play the fool but all my friends will praise my wisdom and produce me as the very pattern of discretion to others  At dinner every thing seemed to run on with good humour harmony and satisfaction Every creature in company thought themselves pretty and every jest was laught at the man in black sat next his mistress helped her plate chimed her glass and jogging her knees and her elbow he whispered something arch in her ear on which she patted his cheek never was antiquated passion so playful so harmless and amusing as between this reverend couple  The second course was now called for and among a variety of other Dishes a fine turkey was placed before the widow The Europeans you know carve as they eat my friend therefore begged his mistress to help him to a part of the turkey The widow pleased with an opportunity of shewing her skill in carving an art upon which it seems she picqued herself began to cut it up by first taking off the leg  Madam  cries my friend  if I might be permitted to adv  se I would begin by cutting off the wing and then the Leg will come off more easily  Sir replies the widow give me leave to understand cutting up a fowl I always begin with the leg  Yes Madam  replies the lover  but if the wing be the most convenient  manner I would begin with the wing  Sir interrupts the lady when you have fowls of your own begin with the wing if you please but give me leave to take off the leg I hope I am not to be taught at this time of day  Madam  interrupts he  we are never too old to be instructed  Old Sir interrupts the other who is old Sir when I die of age I know of some that will quake for fear if the leg does not come off take the turkey to yourself  Madam  replied the man in black  I don't care a farthing whether the leg or the wing comes off if you are for the leg first why you shall have the argument even though it be as I say  As for the matter of that cries the widow I don't care a fig whether you are for the leg off or on and friend for the future keep your distance  O  replied the other  that is easily done it is only removing to the other end of the table and so madam your most obedient humble servant  Thus was this courtship of an age destroyed in one moment for this dialogue effectually broke off the match between this respectable couple that had been but just concluded The smallest accidents disappoint the most important treaties However though it in some measure interrupted the general satisfaction it no ways lessened the happiness of the youthful couple and by the young lady's looks I could perceive she was not entirely displeased with this interruption  In a few hours the whole transaction seemed entirely forgotten and we have all since enjoyed those satisfactions which result from a consciousness of making each other happy My son and  his fair partner are fixed here for life the man in black has given them up a small estate in the country which added to what I was able to bestow will be capable of supplying all the real but not the fictitious demands of happiness As for myself the world being but one city to me I don't much care in which of the streets I happen to reside I shall therefore spend the remainder of life in examining the manners of different countries and have prevailed upon the man in black to be my companion  They must often change says  Confucius  who would be constant in happiness or wisdom  Adieu  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LETTER I INtroduction A character of the Chinese Philosopher Page  LETTER II The arrival of the Chinese in London His motives
