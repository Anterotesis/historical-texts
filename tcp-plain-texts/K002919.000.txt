 LETTER FROM DAVID HUME ESQ TO THE AUTHOR OF THE DELINEATION OF THE NATURE AND OBLIGATION OF MORALITY  SIR  WHEN I write you I know not to whom I am addressing myself I only know he is one who has done me a great deal of honour and to whose civilities I am obliged If we be strangers I beg we may be acquainted as soon as you think proper to discover yourself if we be acquainted already  I beg we may be friends if friends I beg we may be more so Our connexion with each other as men of letters is greater than our difference as adhering to different sects or systems Let us revive the happy times when Atticus and Cassius the Epicureans Cicero the Academic and Brutus the Stoic could all of them live in unreserved friendship together and were insensible to all those distinctions except so far as they furnished agreable matter to discourse and conversation Perhaps you are a young man and being full of those sublime ideas which you have so well exprest think there can be no virtue upon a more confined system I am not an old one but being of a cool temperament have always found that more simple views were  sufficient to make me act in a reasonable manner  in this faith have I lived and hope to die  Your civilities to me so much overbalance your severities that I should be ungrateful to take notice of some expressions which in the heat of composition have dropt from your pen I must only complain of you a little for ascribing to me the sentiments which I had put into the mouth of the Sceptic in the Dialogue I have surely endeavoured to refute the Sceptic with all the force of which I am master and my refutation must be allowed sincere because drawn from the capital principles of my system But you impute to me both the sentiments of the Sceptic and the sentiments of his antagonist  which I can never admit of In every Dialogue no more than one person can be supposed to represent the author  Your severity on one head that of Chastity is so great and I am so little conscious of having given any just occasion to it that it has afforded me a hint to form a conjecture perhaps ill grounded concerning your person  I hope to steal a little leisure from my other occupations in order to defend my philosophy against your attacks If I have occasion to give a new edition of the work which you have honoured with an answer I shall make great advantage of your remarks and hope to obviate some of your criticisms  Your style is elegant and full of  agreable imagery In some few places it does not fully come up to my ideas of purity and correctness I suppose mine falls still further short of your ideas In this respect we may certainly be of use to each other With regard to our Philosophical systems I suppose we are both so fixt that there is no hope of any conversions betwixt us and for my part I doubt not but we shall both do as well to remain as we are  I am Sir With great regard Your most obliged humble servant DAVID HUME  EDIN    th March
