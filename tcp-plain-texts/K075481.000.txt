HOUSES  HOUSES and lodgings in London are let either furnished or unfurnished and their prices are according to their size their situation and their manner of fitting up In the central parts of London and Westminster such as the neighbourhood of St James's CharingCross the squares CoventGarden the theatres St Paul's Churchyard Cheapside the Royal Exchange c they are high rented in more distant parts they are cheaper and in bystreets courts lanes alleys and such obscure places cheaper still  A private house feet in front and about seventy deep two or three rooms on a floor unfurnished in the best streets will let from guineas ayear to such a house in other places may be had from to guineas unfurnished lodgings in such houses are seldom to be met with  In less central places but in good streets unfurnished houses of twenty feet in front two rooms and a light closet on a floor may be had for sixty or seventy guineas ayear and houses of eighteen feet in front for forty or thirty guineas according to the situation and conveniencies Unfurnished lodgings in such houses let proportionably The first floor generally goes at half the net rent of the house without taxes the parlour floor or second floor at one fourth  Houses about twentyone feet in front will let from four guineas a week furnished to eight guineas according to the season of the year and the time they are engaged for The dearest season is from Christmas to June when families are in town and the parliament sitting the cheapest when families are out of town and the parliament prorogued In the winter season such a house as I have mentioned taken for four or five months may possibly be had for seven guineas aweek Thus taken the tenant pays no taxes the goods are delivered on inventory and whatever is destroyed is paid for Furnished lodgings that is the first floor with a servant's room c in such a house will let for from two guineas aweek to three and a half in proportion to the goodness of the furniture the conveniencies wanted the trouble given the time they are engaged for and the season of the year  Houses of fifty guineas ayear rent will let furnished for from two guineas weekly to five and the first floor furnished will let for from one guinea a week to two guineas second floors two thirds of the rent of first floors and parlour floors at the price of second floors  It is generally estimated that in lodginghouses the rent of the first floor furnished with other conveniencies such as kitchen cellars garret c shall pay the rent and taxes of the whole house unfurnished  Shops when let separate will fetch from l ayear to l free of taxes according to their size situation trade of the street and shew of window  Landlords have now got into a method of making tenants pay guineas for rent instead of pounds and also landtax and repairs but all these outgoings should be considered when the agreement is made as well as the taxes on the house for in some parishes the poorrates and landtax are lower than in others Persons who have money may often get the remnant of a lease cheap provided they will pay down a certain sum of money for such lease for there are always distressed housekeepers in London trying to procure money by every possible means for which reason such as purchase a lease should examine the covenants of that lease and the state of the building and particularly take care  that the rent and taxes are paid up to the time they take possession of it and also the groundrent by seeing the receipts otherwise the tenant may have the arrears of such rent or taxes to pay and the seller of the lease may not be found or if found not able to repay  The general conditions of a lease are to leave such fixtures at the end of the term as are given in with the lease on schedule and to leave it in such a state as it was in when taken the wear from time only excepted to pay the rent halfyearly under a forfeiture of the lease but with a liberty of assigning it during the term  If a tenant purchases or takes a lease of another tenant during its term by assignment he is no longer bound for the rent than whilst it is in his possession he may assign it to another and this done is no longer answerable for the rent but the first tenant assigning it without the consent of his landlord is held bound for the rent during the whole term if the occupier does not pay it  TABLE shewing how many Years Purchase an Annuity or Lease is worth so as to make or per cent of Money Y M D  Years Months Days  Y P    per cent    per cent    per cent    per cent    per

              E            Note F S  or the Fee Simple is the Perpetuity  In purchasing a lease of a tenant it is often expected that the purchaser should also buy the fixtures at a fair appraisement in doing this he should examine the lease and see that he does not give money for those fixtures which belong to the house for landlords will often fit up a house with every necessary fixture and put the tenant to no expence in this matter But if the fixtures have been put up by the tenant he has a liberty to remove or sell all such as are not fixed to the freehold  Fixtures removeable are locks bells cisterns grates fixed coppers dressers shelves counters c Paper pasted to the wall buildings erected new windows chimneypieces c or things to beautify the house c and fixed to the freehold must go with the house at the end of the term and cannot be removed  When goods or fixtures are appraised the seller and the buyer each appoints one appraiser and the price is fixed between them if they cannot agree a third is called in by the other two and his decision is final If six or eight hours is taken up in this business each appraiser expects a guinea for his trouble if a few fixtures only are to be appraised the appraiser will expect only halfaguinea However if you employ him in removing your furniture repairing it c and you make a prior agreement with him he will probably not charge you for the appraising of a few fixtures Be careful to have an honest man for an appraiser for his voice has been known to have been bought over on the other side When goods are appraised to a buyer a greater value is put upon them than they would fetch at a sale and if immediately sold they would not fetch the appraised price by thirty percent  In taking a house of its owner take care that it is in thorough repair and give a rent accordingly  It is very dangerous to take unfurnished lodgings in London for should the tenant of the house not pay his rent your goods will be liable to be seized for it so will your carriage and horses standing at livery for the rent of the stables if that rent is in arrear To avoid this enquire into the circumstances of the  housekeeper and if you cannot get the landlord of the house to give you an agreement in writing that he will not seize your goods for any arrears that may become due by his tenant ask to see the landlord's receipt for the last halfyear before you pay your own rent  Such housekeepers who have troublesome lodgers may remove them if they will not quit otherwise by raising the rent weekly upon them and if they refuse to pay suing them for the same if the lodgings are furnished and they do not pay an opportunity may be taken when the lodger and all persons belonging to him are out of the apartments to lock the door and keep him from reentering if any thing is owing any effects of the lodger may be detained  If a tenant of an unfurnished house gives notice to his landlord to quit and does not quit at the time given in such notice or if he will not quit the premises on a legal notice from his landlord but holds possession beyond his term if the landlord has acquainted him in writing that he expects double rent for his so doing he is obliged to pay double the rent first agreed on Geo c s Geo c s  If a tenant cannot be removed by any of these means he must be ejected out by a course of law  Notice of warning must be in writing directed to the tenant  It is a late determination of the courts that if it be necessary to give a tenant at will halfayear's notice to quit the said notice must be given halfayear before the expiration of his year that is to say his year and the notice must expire at the same time for if the  enant enters upon another year he may keep possession the whole of that year and no ejectment to put him out before will stand good  For every dwellinghouse inhabited rented from l to l the occupier must pay d in the pound Geo c Geo c  At l and upwards to any sum under l d in the

and at a very small annual premium The landlord generally insures the building  The  SunFire Office  near the Royal Exchange and in Craig'scourt Charingcross has been esteemed the most eligible because the proprietors act liberally to the insured and pay the amount of any loss with little trouble to the supplicant They expect you to give in the best estimate you can of the loss sustained swear to the amount and then they immediately pay they used to deduct three per cent on the payment but have lately altered their plan and pay now the full sum insured if the goods lost amount to that sum The clerks expect some small fees to the amount of a few guineas  The SunFire Office besides s d for the policy and mark has the following annual premiums  Sums insured  Common Insurance

themselves or others the capital stock of this corporation being an unquestionable security to the assured in case of loss or damage by fire And in case of dispute the assureds have a more ready and effectual method of recovery than can be had against any societies who do not act under a common seal  This corporation will in case of fire allow all reasonable charges attending the removal of goods and pay the sufferer's loss whether the goods are destroyed lost or damaged by such removal without any deduction  As an addition to the expence of insurance government has laid a tax of s d on every l insured which must be paid at the time you pay your insurance which is always a year in advance  It is customary for these offices to have inserted in the body of the policy the particular articles you insure and how much upon each as for example Cloaths l books l furniture l plate l c and though you were to insure to the amount of l they never pay more than you can make appear you have lost If insuring as above you have lost l of cloaths they will pay no more than l the sum insured and the same in other articles It is folly therefore to insure beyond the value of your real property If your property increases at any  ture time and you wish to insure more you can have a new policy for s d  In case of removal the same policy will do with the addition of an indorsement for which they charge one shilling  All these offices pay for the removal of goods in case of an adjoining fire  Cautions against Fire  To guard against fire every master or mistress of a family should be particularly attentive that servants put every fire out before they go to bed and that they put out the candles in their own room for if a fire does not begin in your own house as watchmen are always about to give notice there is sufficient time to escape But if families should be so unfortunate as to be surprised by fire and cannot escape at the door they should by all means endeavour to be cool and not be too much alarmedfear overcomes reason and will prevent studying our safety If there be no way out at the top of the house from the first floor windows or even from the second a person might escape by tying the blankets and sheets together fastening one end to a chair with the window half down and throwing the other end out and lowering himself down by the blankets c the window will prevent the chair following you  The law enjoins that the parishofficers shall pay as a reward to the turncock whose water first reaches the place where any fire breaks out a sum not exceeding ten shillings to the first engine brought complete a sum not exceeding thirty shillings to the second a sum not exceeding twenty shillings and to the third a sum not exceeding ten shillings and to make persons careful of fire whenever a chimney takes fire and the house is not burnt or wherever any mischief is done to a house by fire beginning in a chimney and the parishofficers pay the rewards as above the tenant or lodger whose chimney is thus set on fire shall repay the churchwardens the said sums or such part of them as a justice shall direct if the matter is referred to him Geo c  But as a preservative against fires every parish is furnished with long ladders these are kept at certain places and every family should know where they are kept and write it down and fix the writing  n some conspicuous part of the house as also in what  tuation the fireplugs are by doing this people can  lways have recourse to them  If families have any thing to preserve more than ordinary for example shopbooks books of account writings banknotes cash c as these things take but little room it would be adviseable for those who have no other secure place to put them every night into a bag and place them in their chamber by their cloaths they can thus be readily carried off  Some families have stoneclosets others have iron chests but the above method would be almost equally as secure  Tradesmen would do well to keep duplicates of their books and lodge one set in the house of a friend the occurrences of a week might be transcribed at the week's end  Those who have banknotes should always enter the number date and sum of each note in a book as soon as received in which case if destroyed on giving the bank security to repay the money in case the note ever appears against them they will give the loser the cash If they receive them of bankers and can remember where they received them and on whose account such bankers will furnish them with the particulars as they always enter them in their books  If a neighbouring house is on fire preserve your temper be cool and wary don't be in haste to open your doors and let in the rabble be they as impatient as they may for in fires thieves are always ready to plunder a house and you may lose more that way than any other The insuranceoffices always retain in their service a number of men to attend at fires these may be known by their dress and badge and if you admit any into your house to assist you in removing your property let these be the only people The master of the house should stand at the door himself for that purpose and the goods as removed should be carried to the house of some friend in the neighbourhood on the opposite side of the street  The taxes of a house in London are nearly half the rent and are as follow  Landtax a tax on the ground paid by the tenant halfyearly but generally allowed by the landlord in the rent if no agreement to the contrary  This is generally four shillings in the pound but in some parishes less than others  A housetax paid to Government by the tenant of sixpence ninepence or one shilling in the pound according to the rent The rent in this tax is rated to the full See  Houses    If the house has a retailshop belonging to it it pays an additional tax of from four shillings to two shillings in the pound according to the rent of the house This to be paid also by the tenant See  Houses    The poor'srate is another tax but a parochial one paid by the tenant to the overseers of the parish for the maintenance of the poor This is collected every halfyear and the assessment is from one to six shillings in the pound or more according to the number of poor in the parish This assessment is made by the parish officers and ratified by a bench of justices The book with this ratification and the sums each housekeeper is to pay is brought round to every house when the money is collected and each inhabitant may see how much others pay then or at any other time on paying sixpence or a shilling The rent of each house is generally estimated in the parishbook at twothirds of the real rent paid and if any person finds that he pays more in proportion than the rest of the parish he may obtain redress by an application to the quartersessions at a very little expence  Any person occupying any house c out of which any other person assessed has removed or which at the making the rate was empty every person so removing and the person so coming into and occupying the same shall pay to such rate in proportion to the time he occupied the same In case of dispute the proportion to be ascertained by two justices Geo c s  Another tax is the windowtax paid by the tenant to Government and collected halfyearly  This is assessed in the following manner     s  d  Every house pays in the first place per an    each  And also for windows and no more                                                                              and upwards      Windows of outhouses are to be reckoned into the number  Windows lighting two rooms to be reckoned as two  Two or more windows not twelve inches apart from each other are reckoned but as one  No windows deemed stopped unless with stones brick or plaster  Opening a window without notice to the assessor forfeits twenty shillings  Glass doors and lights over doors do not pay according to this act  But in addition to the above windows pay a second duty in lieu of the duty on tea taken off this is as follows     L  s  d  Every house under windows per ann                                                                        After this s a window for the rest to the number of     L  s  d  windows pay per ann        After this s d a window for the rest to  to per ann        to        to        to        to        to        to        to        upwards        Persons are to pay only for two houses and those containing the greatest number of windows  Glassdoors and lights over doors are here considered as windows  The next tax is the churchwardens rate for repairing the church The countyrate is generally collected with it This is only collected occasionally and may be from threepence in the pound to two or three shillings according to the exigencies required  Another rate or assessment is the pavingtax for repairing cleaning and lighting the streets This is one shilling and sixpence in the pound of twothirds of the rent or value  Another is for watching them but this is a trifle  There is a further call on every householder for Easterofferings for the rector or vicar of the parish this is fourpence ahead for every one in each family capable of receiving the sacrament paid once a year at Easter But this seldom is collected it is generally lest to each family to give what they please but it is always expected that they give something perhaps a few shillings  Once or twice a year the churchwardens generally bring round a book to make a collection for the lecturer or afternoon preacher At this time a housekeeper generally gives a few shillings but this is optional  In some parishes twenty or thirty shillings a year more or less are paid by housekeepers in proportion to their rent in lieu of tithes  A further expence to the inhabitants is the river water with which each house is served from about twentyfour to thirty shillings a year according to the time of serving whether every day or three times a week  The Londonbridge waterworks supply the city and the greatest part of its liberties with Thames water at the rate of from twentyfour to thirty shillings paid halfyearly according to the distance from Londonbridge The pipes of this Company spread all over the city to Towerhill Snowhill Shoreditch and St Dunstan'schurch Fleetstreet Office at Londonbridge  The Yorkbuilding waterworks office in Villiersstreet attendance from three in the afternoon till seven supplies Westminster and the west end of the town as far as Holborn with Thames water and will convey the water if desired to the upperstories of a house the second or third story according to their situation The higher the house stands from the water side the less height can they convey the water The prices of the water is the same with the Londonbridge waterworks only if the water is to be conveyed to the second or third story more money is paid annually from thirty shillings to five pounds The Thames water is reckoned softer than that of the new river If a fire happens in the night application for water from this Company and that of Londonbridge must be made at the respective offices and it will be some time half an hour or more before they can get their engines to work  The NewRiver Company office in Dorsetstreet Fleetstreet supplies all London on the north side of the Thames from Mileend turnpike to Hydepark corner with water brought twenty miles from London to a reservoir at Islington The terms of this Company are rather higher than those of other watercompanies but the water is generally clearer and better They serve families from twentyfour shillings a year to five  pounds according to the quantity of water they require which is settled by the collector of the district whose name may be known by applying at the office in Dorsetstreet This collector also will furnish families with the names of the turncocks in his district printed on paper to whom application is to be made in cases of fire and in the collector's receipts will be found the place to apply to in want of water and other complaints This Company conveys the water to upper stories of houses without any additional expence than the lead pipes which are the property of and must be fixed by the tenant the nearer a house stands to the Thames side that is the lower it is from the reservoirs the higher in the houses the water can be conveyed In the New River Waterworks the water runs from an eminence in the Londonbridge and York Company it is forced up by fire of course the higher it is conveyed the more money annually is required  There are other waterworks those of Chelsea Hampstead Bayswater Shadwell Lambeth c that supply other parts of the town and the Borough of Southwark with soft water and on nearly the same terms Thrale's waterworks that supply part of Southwark serve so low as s ayear  The lead pipes from the main that is from the middle of the street are considered as belonging to the house and must be paid for and kept in repair by the tenant other repairs and expences are paid by the several companies  Attendance is always given at the respective offices from morning till night and complaints immediately redressed It is proper to send to these offices immediately on a fire breaking out especially those that supply the Thames water  It is adviseable for every housekeeper on first coming to London to apply to the offices for the names of the turncocks and where they live and also to fireoffices for the places where the fireengines are also to the vestryclerks of the different parishes for the places where the ladders are kept and from year to year who are the constables and other  parishofficers and to write these down and stick them up in the kitchen or other part of the house that the earliest application in case of fire may be made for every necessary assistance  In frosty weather to secure water to the house is the care and business of the tenant For this purpose fresh horsedung should be laid over the pavement under which the lead pipes pass and some should be wound round the pipe as it crosses the area Dung can be had at any of the stables for a trifle and the expence of fetching it in a cart is not much  BAKERS BREAD AND MILK  EVERY peck loaf shall weigh lb oz averdupois weight every half peck lb oz and every quartern loaf lb oz and an half to be weighed within twentyfour hours after baking or being sold under the penalty of from s to s for every ounce deficient at the discretion of the magistrate the bread to be taken and weighed in his presence for every deficiency of weight under one ounce the penalty is from d to s d Geo c Geo c  Bread made for sale shall be fairly marked wheatenbread with a large Roman W and householdbread with an H to ascertain under what denomination it was made under a penalty not exceeding s nor under s Ibid  Any baker or other person demanding or taking a higher price for bread than what the same shall be set at by the assize or refusing to sell to any person any of the sorts allowed or ordered to be made when he shall have more than is necessary for the immediate use of his family or customers forfeits not exceeding s nor less than s Ibid  If a certain weight of wheatenbread costs d the same weight of standard wheaten to be marked S W shall be sold for d and the same weight of  householdbread shall be sold for d on penalty of from s to s Ibid  Bread inferior to wheaten is not to be sold at a higher price than householdbread is set at on penalty of s Ibid Applications to a magistrate  Bakers' men who carry the bread round to their customers will sometimes if families run up a bill sell a loaf or two by the way and put the money into their own pockets telling their masters that they left them at such houses The master of course charges the customer for bread he never had and when the bill comes to be paid it perhaps occasions a dispute and the buyer finds himself obliged to pay for it after all To avoid this the best method is never to run a bill with a baker but pay for the bread as it is left or if this be inconvenient order the bill in every Monday morning while the occurrences of the week are in the memory these bills examined and filed will prevent your being cheated Bakers like milkwomen will sometimes leave tallies on which they daily chalk what is left but a mark is easily added while the servant is inattentive which robs you of the price of a loaf or a pint of milk These marks are sometimes made on the doorpost oftener without the door than within of course an addition can be made unknown to your servant as the baker or milkwoman passes the door or they may be wholly rubbed out by wanton boys or others as is frequently the case and when the score is gone the baker or milkwoman may charge what they please and as they can sell a loaf or a pint of milk to those who pay ready money and secrete that money to conceal this fraud from their masters they will score it up to their customers on credit  With respect to milk though sold at d a quart it is always mixed with water There are cows that are driven into the streets about the west end of the town from which you may have your milk and see it milked at d a quart but the milk of these is not very good as the cows are driven about all the day yet it is better than what is brought by milkwomen  BUTCHERS AND MEAT  IT is by no means adviseable to deal with one butcher unless you can agree to have all your meat viz beef mutton veal lamb and pork weighed in at one and the same price all the year round which some butchers will do at d a pound and occasionally give you at the same price a quarter of houselamb If you enter into such an agreement take care to have a bill of the weight always sent home with the meat and order it to be weighed by your own people  If you make no such agreement and deal regularly with one butcher you will frequently be charged for a joint you never had and for half a pound or a quarter of a pound more than the joint weighs and you will always pay a halfpenny or a farthing more per pound than was you to go to market and cheapen it yourself In buying a joint at market of seven pounds and an half you may often deduct the half pound but when sent home by a butcher who credits you never This conduct in a family will occasion a great saving at the year's end If you pay your butcher but once a quarter be sure to have a bill of the weight and price sent in with your meat and a regular bill of the week's meat every Monday morning In this case you will see what you are about and not be liable to be imposed upon  Good meat should not look lean dry or shrivelled the fleshy part should be of a bright red and the fat of a clear white When the flesh looks pale and the fat yellow the meat is not good Cow beef is worth a penny a pound less than ox beef except it be the meat of a maiden heiser In a buttock you may know it by the udder  The average price of beef is from d a pound to d The prime boiling parts are the rump buttock edgebone briskit thick and thin flank roasting pieces the surloin and ribs  Butchers make a difference in price between pieces of beef to roast and boil if you take a piece of each they will sell prime beef for d halfpenny if a boilling piece alone d if roasting alone d  If you want rumpsteaks in any quantity it is cheaper to give d a pound without bone than d halfpenny for the whole rump A buttock is the cheapest joint as it is free from bone for if you wish it the butcher will sell it you without the marrowbone which is worth its weight for the marrow  In buying a buttock of beef be careful you do not buy the mousebuttock for the prime one The difference is easily known the prime buttock is first cut off the leg and is the thickest the mousebuttock is thinner and cut off the legs between the buttock and the leg bone is coarse meat and not worth so much by one penny a pound  A bullock's tongue will sell from s to s d according to its size and goodness A good tongue should look plump clear and bright not of a blackish hue  The flesh of mutton should be of a bright red and its fat of a clear white and unless it is very fat it is worth little Ewe mutton is not worth so much as weather by a penny in the pound mutton five years old if it can be got is the most delicious its natural gravy is brown A leg of ewe mutton may be known by the udder on its skirt The average price of prime weather mutton is d halfpenny per pound though it will sell often for d halfpenny  The average price of veal is d though it will often sell for d particularly the fillet Large veal is seldom good Veal should be fat and very white like rabbit or chicken not red or look as if it was much blown up  The average price of grass lamb is d a pound that of pigpork the same though pork chops will often sell for d or d  House lamb at Christmas is dear and if fine and sat will sell for s d a quarter the leg s At other times it may be bought so low as s d a quarter  If your butcher sends you any tainted meat he may be fined by complaining to a magistrate but the  readiest and least troublesome method of redress is  put up with a trifling loss and deal with such a butche no more  The best markets in town are St James's New port Claremarket Newgate Honeylane and Leaden hall for meat for vegetables CoventGarden and Leadenhall for fresh butter Leadenhall particular+ly for Epping butter and cream cheese  POULTRY  POULTRY of all sorts may be purchased cheape  of the higlers at the several markets than at the Poulterer's shops but of the higlers you must take care what you buy fowls and chickens should be fat plump and white particularly white legged Chicken may be known by their size and fowls are young if they have no spurs  By the same marks you may judge of turkeys A large cockturkey at Christmas cannot be bought for less than s or s at other times s a hen turkey from s to s d Fat crammed chickens about ten weeks old on or about Ladyday are worth about s d each and a fine fowl at Midsummer is worth s d at other times chicken may be bought of higlers for s or s a couple and fowls at the same price  Ducks and geese should look white very plump and broad over the breast A fat goose weight about lb on Michaelmasday is worth s at other times about s d A green goose in May is worth s The price of ducks is from s a couple to s Wild ducks in frosty weather may be bought in Fleetmarket for s d a couple at other times they are worth s each If they smell fishy they are of little value to know this take one of the penfeathers from the wing and put it down the throat if it smells fishy in drawing it out the bird will taste so Dovehouse pidgeons in May or June may be bought for s d or s a dozen In winter time poulterers will ask s d a piece Larks in hard weather may be  had for s d a dozen They are best soon after harvest Guinea fowls are best in Spring when they get fat without feeding At this time they are worth from s to s each at other times they are worth little these last can be bought only of the poulterers of whom quails also may be had after harvest at s d each Woodcocks are from s to s each according to the plenty or scarcity  Eggs are from three a groat to eight according to the time of the year they are dearest in winter but such as wish for newlaid eggs may frequently get them at the liverystables for one penny or threehalfpence each  FISH  FISH is generally dearest and best when in season  Fishmongers charge a price for fish according to their customers to deal with one man regularly and pay him once or twice a year is as bad as dealing with butchers in the same way A fishmonger near the squares will charge s d for a mackrell which may be bought for half the money at Charingcross and for onethird of the money from those who cry them about  To such as live convenient Billingsgate is the place to buy seafish at whether you want little or much Marketdays there are Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays but marketdays are the dearest days You may often buy them fresh and forty per cent cheaper on the intermediate days By purchasing at Billingsgate you may buy at onethird of the price which fishmongers charge and if you lay out a few shillings it will pay for a person to carry them home fishmongers at this market purchase at break of day and when the market is not glutted they will at those times buy up all the largest fish but there is always sufficient lest to serve private families There is an act of parliament to oblige fishmongers to sell brill bret or  mall turbot not exceeding inches from eye to tail  for d a pound under a penalty of s to the informer for asking more or refusing to weigh or measure it any person may seize the fishmonger and deliver him to a constable to carry him before a justice who will not only fine him but make him return the money Geo c But when turbit is in season as in May and June one of lb weight may be bought at Billingsgate for s d or s other fish in proportion  Mackrell in June and July are in great plenty and may be bought at Billingsgate by the quarter of a hundred for d or d a piece Mackrell and herrings if fresh will look bright their gills red and their eyes clear Mackrell are reckoned cheap at d or d each If fish is firm not flabby or slimy the gills ruddy or bleeding and the eyes bright you may depend on it it is fresh but if otherwise not so Salmon when cut should look red and bleeding fresh But put your nose to the gills and you will soon find if it is stale  Thames salmon is always double the price of other salmon not that it is better tasted but being later out of the water it can be crimped which gives it a firmness The price of seasalmon is from d to s a pound  Lobsters and crabs should always be bought alive Those of the middling size are always the best No overgrown animal food is delicious  The average price of soals is about s a pound though they are not sold by the pound but the pair Herrings are bought for about s a dozen whitings s a dozen haddocks according to their size for about d a pound Large cod at the dearest time may be purchased for about s or s d a pound at the cheapest for onethird of the money Skate at about d a pound and barrel cod in Lent for about d a pound If a family could dispense with a quantity of salt fish dried cod may be bought at the dry fishmongers in Thamesstreet in winter for about s for lb and barrel cod or pickled salmon by the kit at a very reasonable price The price of a barrel of the best oysters Colchester or Milton is  s d Dutch eels d or d a pound Smelts from s a hundred to s Prawns from s d to s a hundred  Freshwater fish is in price as follows Eels jack carp and perch s a pound trout and tench s d gudgeons d or d a dozen flounders from d to d a piece according to their size Freshwater fish are kept by fishmongers in cisterns and should be bought alive  Small turbots are easily distinguished from Dutch plaice for plaice have many yellow spots on their back turbots have none  Haddock may be known from small cod by two black spots one on each shoulder Small cod is a bad fish but the haddock is a good one  Half a kit of pickled salmon neat weight about lb may be purchased at the dry fishmongers in Thamesstreet in summer time May June July c for s and in September c when it is equally good for s In wintertime it will keep a long while  BUTTER AND CHEESE  FOR fresh butter Leadenhall market is the best and cheapest in London The best fresh lump butter in summer may be bought for d halfpenny or d a pound in winter for d or d Epping butter which is the finest in flavour may be there bought for d a pound more than lump butter Buttershops sell this for s d a pound  In winter time Cambridge and Dorsetshire salt butter arrives fresh in London twice a week and is within one penny or a halfpenny a pound as dear as fresh but the best way for a family is to buy a half firkin which weighs lb of the best Yorkshire butter This may be bought for s or s the half firkin less than d a pound and may be bought agreeable to the palate of the buyer but when you taste it taste a piece on the outside next the tub if this is good and free from any rankness you may be certain the  middle is But the middle shall often be sweet when the outsides are rank and buttermen knowing this always give a taste out of the middle The Dorsetshire butter in tubs with broad hoops weight about lb rather fetches the best price but for keeping it is the best butter  Bad butter is not to be mixed with good on pain of forfeiting double the value Buyers of butter should set their mark on the tub c and if the sellers open the tubs or put in other butter after the tubs are thus marked they are liable to a penalty of s for every hundred weight Application to a magistrate Car c and W M c  Every firkin of butter shall weigh lb without the cask  Cheese is always the better for keeping two or three years provided it be kept dry Families who like good old cheese should buy it one year under another as they do their wine c Old cheese good for any thing can seldom be met with and if it is cheesemongers ask a large price for it Cheese a year and a half old of the best dairies and the best is always the most delicious and in the end the cheapest can be bought from d halfpenny a pound to d In buying of this every housekeeper should please his own palate Though decayed cheese will please many palates best it may be bought a halfpenny and sometimes a penny a pound under the price of sound cheese Glocester cheese is generally a penny a pound under the price of Cheshire  In buying of bacon the Wiltshire is reckoned the best and may be bought at capital shops for d halfpenny or d a pound by the flitch small bacon such as weighs about lb the slitch is the most delicate In buying it have the flitch cut through and if the fat looks red and the skin is thin it will probably turn out well and boil firm but if you make an agreement the seller will change it if you dislike it Rusty bacon looks brown when cut particularly at the inside edge  You may judge of hams by running a knife into the body of them and smelling them Yorkshire  hams are sold for about d a pound and Westmoreland hams for d halfpenny Westmoreland hams are the highest flavoured Dried and pickled tongues may be bought from s d to s d a piece according to the size at the oil and pickleshops  Weights and Measures  All weights and measures

measure or yard or keep any such whereby any thing is bought or sold shall forfeit s on conviction before a justice on oath of one witness C c  If you buy of a barrowwoman always purchase by your own weights and scales or you will be cheated  VEGETABLES  PERSONS used to the country will not relish the vegetables and fruits generally sold in London such persons as wish for delicates of this kind namely young peas and beans halfgrown cucumbers c and fruit with the bloom on must not purchase the general run of the market but either apply to a fruiterer in Coventgarden or some of the gardeners there a day or two before they are wanted and then by paying a little extra price they may have such things as they wish for  BREWERS AND BEER  SMALL beer may be bought of different qualitie and prices from s a barrel to s each bar+rel gallons s a barrel is the general run an  brewers if applied to for the purpose will lay in th  quantity a family may use throughout the year in th  winter and engage it shall keep good and fresh th  year round if it turns four they will take it back an  change it for such as is not so this is the best method of having good beer  The only caution necessary on this head is to tak  care that the barrels are full and that you have you  quantity for your money as it often works out and i  spilt in the carriage  The servants of all these tradesmen expect and will call on you at Christmas for a Christmasbox which is a bad custom and ought to be abolished as will the scavengers dustmen postman watchman and beadle of the parish To the watchman it may not be

bought and the time allowed for conveying it otherwise it is liable to be seized but if your wine merchant omits to send such permit with the wine the loss will be his Geo c  Private families wishing to remove wine exceeding three gallons from one place to another must apply to the exciseman of their district by a note in writing from whence such wines are to be removed and on proving to the satisfaction of the collector or supervisor of the said district that the duties of the said wines have been paid for which purpose it will be necessary to keep the permits and produce them and at the same time specifying the quantity of each sort of foreign wine to be removed saying whether it be  French  red wine or  French  white wine or foreign white wine not  French  or foreign red wine not  French  also the number and contents of casks bottles or vessels containing the same and likewise whether it is to be removed by water or by land and by what mode of conveyance Doing this the

away and actually delivered within the time expressed and limited in the permit it shall be deemed to be removed without a permit unless proved to the satisfaction of the commissioners of excise that such wine through unavoidable accidents could not have been so delivered  And should any wine be seized in consequence of it's not being removed and delivered in time the same shall be restored to the

justice shall indorse the permit and allow further time for the removal  Where any permit is granted for the removal of wine and the wine not sent away in consequence of it the permit must be returned within the time limited for the removal of the wine to the officer who granted it on pain of forfeiting treble the value of the wine so designed to be removed according to the best price it will fell

excise on their proving that all the duties for such wine have been paid  COALS AND OTHER FUEL  THE price of coals in London is from s a chaldron to s In long frosts they have risen so high as l but on an average they may be bought in summer time at s or s a chaldron Housekeepers should endeavour to lay them in at the cheapest time there are advertising coalmerchants who for ready money will sell bushels for two or three shillings under the price that others sell bushels for but in dealing with these and indeed with other sellers it is prudent to see the coals at the wharf before they are sent in and when they are sent in to take care you have your measure otherwise you may have your year's coals that will not burn or pay a larger price for them than you expected Good coals are generally large black and shining the Pontops are the best If you trust to your coalmerchant with respect to the measurement it will however be necessary  that the number of sacks are counted when the coals are shot Advertising coalsellers go often by fictitious names to avoid the penalties for short measure it is proper therefore to be on your guard particularly against those  By the several coalacts passed this year for the cities of London and Westminster and the Borough of Southwark coalmeters are appointed to measure coals when first carted and remeasure them afterwards if the buyer requests it the coalmeters office for the city of London and its liberties is in Earlstreet Blackfriar'sbridge that for Westminster and its liberties at the bottom of Northumberlandstreet in the Strand and those for the Borough of Southwark and its districts at Marigoldstairs Surryside of Blackfriar'sbridge and at the Sun and HatBlock in the Maize Tooleystreet These offices are open all day to hear complaints and give redress  Coals when taken out of the barge and sold as wharfmeasure are to be measured in the presence of a coalmeter The seller to pay d a chaldron for measuring which the buyer is to repay on a ticket of such measurement being produced by the carman under the penalty of s for the carter not delivering such ticket But when brought in if the buyer declares himself dissatisfied with the measure the driver of the cart shall not depart till a coalmeter can be procured from the above offices to remeasure them on pain of his forfeiting s and the owner of the cart l  The carman shall be paid s d an hour for the time he waits and the measurer shall be paid d for measuring each chaldron by the buyer but if on remeasuring they are found deficient the seller shall pay the expences of remeasuring and also forfeit l a bushel for every bushel deficient and forfeit the chaldron of coals to the poor the meter shall forfeit l a bushel and the coalporter that measured them s d a bushel  But to save the halfcrown an hour paid for waiting it is best to appoint a meter to attend at the time you expect the coals If families would keep a  bushelmeasure and one may be bought for s d a sack or two of the coals might be measured without much trouble  A labouring coalmeter delivering tickets for coals which he was not present at the measuring of shall forfeit s and be incapacitated and the principal shall forfeit l if the s penalty is not paid by the labouring meter in one month  A carter fraudulently delivering or suffering coals to be taken from his cart shall forfeit s or be whipped and imprisoned from one to three months  To punish offences application must be made to a magistrate  All contracts for coals not being less than five chaldrons shall be for poolmeasure including the ingrain or addition of one chaldron in twenty though the term of poolmeasure shall not be mentioned in the contract that is nine bushels or three sacks shall be given in with every five chaldrons

LAUNDRESSES  IN London charge as reasonably for washing as in the country and families who put out their linen would do well to employ a laundress living a little way out of town Such persons are to

particular London is so much the sink of vice that the lower class of people are very much corrupted Those brought from the country are soon infected with the dissolute manners of townservants and become equally bad with them To expect attachment from a servant is idle and betrays an ignorance of the world Servants will now and then affect it in order to gain the confidence of their employers and thus forward their own interest but if we suppose them in our interest it is because we do not thoroughly know them Economy in a family servants do not like The more extravagant a master or mistress is the better they live and the more they can purloin and should what they call a generous master or mistress fail in the world owing to a waste or an inattention to domestic concerns they will cry to their fellowservants "It is a pity he was a goodnatured generous manCome let us go look for another place" This being considered we are to expect nothing from them but a performance of their duty keep them whilst they do it and discharge them when they neglect it  The first thing then is to endeavour to get good ones if we do not bring them out of the country with us There are in different parts of the town registeroffices or places where servants of all denominations attend at certain hours and where a master may see them at the expence of one shilling and hire them or by sending a shilling to the keepers of such offices and a description of the servant wanted they will send you one day after day till you are suited but as it is the refuse of servants in general that apply to these offices you must not take the recommendation of the officekeeper who is paid also by the servant for procuring the place nor any written character for such  hings in London are procured from friends and often  orged nay servants of bad character will often go further  they will refer you to persons seemingly of credit who perhaps know little of them It is proper therefore that the master or mistress should apply for the character themselves make some enquiry concerning the person they apply to and ask all those questions they think necessary There are few servantmaids in London or indeed in the country but what are whores it is perhaps an uncharitable supposition but it is nevertheless true To expect therefore to meet with an innocent virtuous girl is next to impossible it is sufficient if she is orderly and conducts herself with decorum If a housekeeper cannot get a servant recommended by a friend or some tradesman with whom he deals such as the baker butcher poulterer greengrocer tallowchandler publican or the like I would recommend papers describing the servant wanted and where to apply being sent or left at the chandler's shops in the neighbourhood which seldom fails of success others will have recourse to advertisements in the public newspapers an insertion for which once costs s d If this mode is adopted the best paper to advertise in is the  Daily Advertiser  in Fleetstreet which is taken in by almost all the publicans in London Such an advertisement will bring you scores of servants and here you must be very careful in your choice and particular as to character for an advertisement will bring with the good a number of disreputable people  The general wages of servants are as follow Steward valet butler l ayear womencooks  l lady'smaids from l to l inferior women servants from l to l footmen l and a livery womenservants to provide their own tea and sugar Boardwages of an upper servant s d a week with fire and candle and s a week to an underservant  They generally agree for a month's wages or a month's warning which is a bad method as there are few servants when warning is given but will be very impertinent and untractable it is far the best when you mean to part with them to get rid of them at once be it ever so inconvenient by enquiry an honest chairwoman  to supply the place of a womanservant may be procured for s a day If such are hired to wash their wages are larger s d with tea and a dram twice a day and strong beer at dinner and supper but for this they slave hard will begin work at two in the morning and continue it till nine the next evening If such a person is wanted employ none of your own servant's recommending but apply for their character to those housekeepers who have employed them and on whom you can better rely  Women cooks and servants of all work when they hire themselves will endeavour to get the kitchenstuff allowed them as a perquisite if you would not be robbed never comply with this nor allow your coachman the old wheels for as the one will to serve herself strip your meat of its fat melt more butter than necessary and convey the ends of candles c into the greasepot to increase its weight so will the other often injure the wheels if they are likely to last too long  If you deliver into the custody of servants plate china linen c to keep and tell them before witness they must be responsible for it if they lose any part of it the law will oblige them as far as they are able to make it good but not else to enable them therefore to pay for any thing missing it is adviseable to keep part of their wages in hand As they are hired by the year they should always be paid one half year under another reserving halfayear in hand As to breaking of china c you cannot compel a servant to pay for it unless it was so agreed on the hiring or done designedly  To avoid disputes respecting wages it is prudent to have the agreement in writing and a receipt for what you pay for sorry am I to say it this class of people make as little ceremony of taking a false oath where there is no proof to the contrary as of telling a lie  Disputes with servants about wages under  l and other things if they cannot amicably be settled should be referred to a neighbouring magistrate who is authorised to hear the complaint and redress it the expence  but trifling but

strictly speaking hiring for a year and the law so construes it  Both master and servant may however part by mutual consent and then the allowance of the cause by a justice of peace is not necessary A

after and then she is to be sent to her place of settlement Dalt  A servant setting fire carelessly to a house is liable to pay on the oath of one witness a hundred pounds to the sufferer or be

the kitchen with them Many instances have occurred where villains have made acquaintance with incautious servants purposely to find a method of breaking into the house and learning what there is worth coming for  To save trouble to the master and servants where many are not kept it is a good method to have in your sitting room near the bell a paper posted with the necessary articles on it in divisions that are chiefly wanted such as Coals Candles Beer Water Broom Lay the Cloth Go to the Door c with a pin to  which a line is fixed with a lead going down into the kitchen to a similar paper fixed there then by fixing this pin in a hole in either of the divisions above the weight will drop or rise to the same division below Do this before you ring your bell and order your servant to look at the index she will then know what is wanted before she comes and bring it with her The expence of this index is trifling  It may also in some families be worth while to have a line from the parlour to the street door to open it without going out of the parlour This where there is but one servant saves a great deal of trouble  A TABLE to shew if so much per Year how much per Month  Per Year

charged upon military persons and the small addition of eleven per cent upon persons not having had the smallpox  The court of directors have a discretionary power of fixing the premium when any peculiar hazard attends the life upon which the assurance is made  Persons preferring the payment of a gross sum or single premium upon an assurance for any certain term are chargeable in a due proportion to the annual premium for such term  Every person making any assurance with the society pays five shillings in the name of entrancemoney and if the sum assured exceed one hundred pounds the entrancemoney is charged after the rate of five shillings for every hundred pounds  Also every person proposing any assurance is required to make a deposit of five shillings and in case the sum proposed to be assured shall exceed one hundred pounds the deposit will be increased after the rate of two shillings and sixpence for every hundred which deposit if the party afterwards or neglects to complete the same for the space of twentyeight days is forfeited to the use of the society but if the court of directors refuse making such assurance the money deposited is returned  Every policy

proportional premium for any intermediate age  Every person desiring to make assurance with the society must sign a declaration by himself or agent setting forth the age state of health profession occupation and other circumstances of the persons whose lives are proposed to be assured and also in case such assurance is made upon the life of another person that the interest which he has in such life is equal to the sum assured This declaration is the basis of the contract between the society and the person desirous to make such assurance and if any artful false or fraudulent representation shall be used therein all claim on account of any policy so obtained shall cease determine and be void and the monies which shall  have been paid upon account of such assurance shall be forfeited to the use of the society  Every person making assurance with the society becomes a member and enters into a covenant that he will conform to observe and keep the statutes byelaws rules orders and ordinances of the society But no member has a right to vote at a general court who is not assured in the sum of l or upwards upon a life or lives for the whole continuance thereof  The business of the society is conducted and carried on by fifteen directors annually chosen out of those members who are assured with the society in the sum of l or upwards upon a life or lives for the whole continuance thereof  Four general courts are held every year on the first Thursday of March June September and December or as often as nine members qualified to vote shall think proper at which times the accounts and state of the society are laid before the persons present  If at any time it shall appear to a General Court of the Society that the premiums received and to be received will not be sufficient to pay the claims then the General Court are to direct a call to be made upon the several members of the Society in proportion to the sums by them assured for making good the deficiency for which call credit is to be given and the call afterwards to be repaid with interest at the rate of per cent  If a call should at any time be requisite which is highly improbable the members assured for a single year will be rated towards such call in the proportion of one sixth part and the members assured for a number of years certain in the proportion of two third parts of the sum charged upon the members assured for the whole continuance of life for every l by them respectively assured  As often as it shall appear to a General Court that the stock of the Society is more than sufficient to pay the claims liable to be made then the General Court is to declare a dividend of the surplus or of such part thereof as shall be judged convenient amongst the  members of the society liable to contribute towards a call in proportion to the sums in which they are assured and to the number of years of their standing in the society  The court of directors are impowered to assure either a gross sum or an annuity to be paid to children after they shall have attained an age assigned  The court of directors are impowered to assure annuities for a life or lives on the payment of a gross sum  So as the amount of any annuity or annuities to be granted upon any  one  life do not exceed one hundred pounds  And towards securing the payment of the several annuities a fund is reserved of twothirds of the sums originally paid for the purchase  There are two or three other societies for assurance on lives that pay annuities to widows and children but they are not sufficiently established to put any great dependence on them of course they are not here noticed  GENERAL POSTOFFICE LOMBARDSTREET  ALL letters and newspapers must be put into the receivinghouses in different parts of the town before

Claremarket the Hermitage in Queenstreet Little Towerhill the Southwark St Saviour's Churchyard Borough  Letters to be sent out of town must be put into these offices before ten at night to be forwarded by the first delivery the next day  To prevent the frequent delays of Pennypost letters the public are requested to be particularly careful to send them to the Pennypost receivinghouses from whence they are collected every four hours and delivered four times a day to all parts of London for when they are put by mistake into the General Postoffice or the receivinghouses for generalpost letters they cannot be collected till late in the evening and besides the delay thereby the penny which ought to have been paid with them must of necessity be charged to the persons they are directed to  Letters are much accelerated by being put in at any of the five principal offices instead of the receivinghouses from whence they must be collected and sent to those offices  For the port of every letter or packet passing or repassing within the cities of London or Westminster the Borough of Southwark and their suburbs which letter or packet is not to exceed the weight of ounces▪  unless coming from or passing to the GeneralPost one penny upon putting in the same as also a penny upon the delivery of such as are directed to any place beyond the said cities borough or suburbs within the district of the pennypost delivery  The triangular stamp on all Pennypost letters shews the day they are brought to one of these principal offices and the round stamp the hour they are given to the letter carriers  This post carries parcels under four ounces to most places within ten miles of London  To expedite the delivery it is adviseable to write on the outside the day of the week and the hour the letter is put into the office  If you send any thing of value by the post it is proper that the person who delivers it at the office should be able to prove the contents but the office has given the following directions concerning this matter Unless letters containing things of value be left open to be so carried to one of the five principal offices abovementioned there to be seen and entered the lettercarrier will no ways be made answerable for their miscarriage  Those who send banknotes by the post are advised by the postoffice to cut them in two pieces obliquely so as to have the words on the left as below in one piece and those on the right in the other and send them at two different times one half at one time and one at another as a security in case the mail is robbed  No  I promise to pay to Mr Abraham Newland or bearer on demand the sum of TEN Pounds  L  TEN  Entd J Fleetwood  For the Gov and Comp of the Bank of England J GREENWAY  London  May  In case of loss the Bank will pay the money on producing one half of the note  With respect to the Pennypost the public are desired to be very distinct in their directions particularly to lodgers by mentioning their landlord's sign and  name for want of which many cannot be delivered And as a check on the lettercarrier those that he returns after three days enquiry will be sent to the writer gratis if their residence can be discovered  Nothing above four ounces will be conveyed by the pennypost except passing to or from the general postoffice  Those who wish to find persons in London not having their directions may often find them out by enquiring at the postoffice among the lettercarriers at the time the letters are delivered to them  MAIL COACHES  THE following exclusive of those on the cross

LONDON STREETS  IN walking through London you may always find your way if before you set out you will consult a map of London and attend to the names of the streets and courts which are always painted on a board against the houses at the corner of each street or court  If you wish to walk safe never pass under any goods c that are drawing up to the top of a house by a crane nor pass a house where the bricklayers are at work lest any thing should fall on your head it is adviseable on such occasions to cross the way and if you would save your clothes never pass under a lamp whilst the lamplighter is triming it nor go near any rails c fresh painted or contest the way with a baker barber chimneysweeper barrowwoman c  If the wall or houses are on your right hand keep the wall and you will have no interruption every one will give way  But don't dispute the wall with a cart or carriage lest you should be crushed  Never stop in a crowd or to look at the windows of a printshop or shewglass if you would not have your pocket picked  Do not walk under a penthouse lest persons watering flowerpots or other slops should drop upon your head  Be careful if you meet a porter carrying a load upon his head that you do not get a blow that may be fatal  If you walk with an umbrella and meet a similar machine lower yours in time lest you either break it or get entangled with the other  One side of the way is generally shady it is not necessary perhaps to recommend crossing to the shady side in sultry weather or keeping to windward when the dust flies  In wet weather look where you step if you would not be splashed don't tread on a loose stone  Don't hastily cross a street when a coach is coming up lest your foot should slip and you be run over  In frosty weather it is adviseable to walk in the coachways which are not so slippery as the footpaths and to bind a piece of clothlist round one of your shoes it will save you many a fall  It is very dangerous walking in a thick fog as you cannot see the danger before you people who walk in London should always look before them both above and below  It would be prudent for the men to have their coatpockets open in the lining within this will often prevent them from being picked At least every one should attend to his pocket at night or as he passes a crowd  WATERMEN's RATES     Oars  Scull  Comp     s  d  s  d  d

the penalties they are liable to for nonattendance and to shew them how much they lie at the mercy of an illnatured neighbour or a mercenary informer  All persons having no lawful or reasonable excuse for being absent shall resort to their parish church or chapel or upon reasonable let thereof to some usual place where divine service shall be performed according to the liturgy and practice of the church of England upon every Sunday and holiday on pain of punishment by the censures of the church or of forfeiting s for every offence to the poor to be levied by the churchwardens by distress Eliz c Except Dissenters tolerated W c Prosecution to be in one month after default J c  And he who is absent from his own parish church shall be put to prove where he went to church Haw  Every person above the age of sixteen years who shall not repair to some church chapel or usual place of common prayer on conviction shall fofeit l a month one third to him who shall sue Eliz c  And this penalty of l a month dispenseth not with the forfeiture of d a Sunday Haw  And every offender in not repairing to divine service having been once convicted and not conforming shall pay l a month into the Exchequer in the term of Easter or Michaelmas next after such conviction and also shall without any other indictment or conviction for every month after such conviction so long as he shall not conform pay as much as shall then remain unpaid after such rate of l a month and in default of any part of such payments the King may by process seize all the goods and two parts of the land of such offender Eliz c J c  Or the King may refuse the l a month though  duly tendered and seize two parts of the lands at his option Jac c  But copyhold lands are not within the statute Haw  And every person who shall usually on Sundays have in his ho  se divine service as established by law and be thereat himself usually present and shall four times a year go to the parish church or other common church or chapel shall not incur any penalty for not repairing to church Eliz c  But this shall not extend to  alified Protestant dissenters who resort to some place of religious worship allowed by the act of toleration W c  Every person who shall retain in  service or shall relieve keep or harbour in his ho  se any servant sojourner or stranger who shall n  repair to church but shall forbear for a month together not having reasonable excuse shall forfeit l for every month he shall continue in his house such person so forbearing J c  No recusant convict that is a person once convicted and not

names of their servants And if the party presented shall be indicted and convicted such churchwarden or constable shall have a reward of s to be levied on the recusant's goods J c  It is difficult for new comers in to any parish to obtain a pew in the parish church but churches are seldom so full but they may find a seat in the pew of others Indeed the pew openers for a shilling now and then given them will sea  a person commodiously  But at the private chapels about town a pew to hold six may be rented for about l or l a year or one person may be seated agreeable to his wishes for  s a year and at these places there are generally celebrated preachers  In order to obtain a pew in any of the parish churches application must be made to the churchwardens for the time being  NUSANCES  IF the driver of any cart car dray or waggon shall ride upon any carriage in a street or highway not having some person on foot or horseback to guide the same such carriages excepted as are conducted by some

an evidence W M c  But by this mode of process the party grieved can only punish the offender corporally he cannot recover damages  If a man strikes you the most summary method of punishing him is to have a warrant for him and take him before a magistrate where he must make satisfaction or be bound over to the sessions  No words whatever can amount to an assault but any injury done to the person of a man in an angry insolent manner be it ever so small is actionable for example spitting in his face jostling him treading on his toes or any way touching him in anger Ibid Even offering to strike or threatening with any staff or weapon is an assault in law Lamb libel  Where a man is threatened to be beaten or can swear that he goes in fear of his life he may before a justice bind his advetsary

Sundry  CAUTIONS  against  ROBBERIES FRAUDS IMPOSITIONS  and  INSULTS  PERSONS travelling to or from London should be careful not to take too much money with them Bank postbills made payable to the holder or order is the safest conveyance for these are of no value till indorsed by the person they are made payable to and if lost as the bank does not pay them till seven days after sight there is time to give notice of the loss  Trunks c should not be fastened behind carriages unless with chains or unless servants ride behind and will attend to them till they are ten or twelve miles from the metropolis for there are thieves frequently waiting at the outskirts of the town particularly in the evening to cut such luggage from behind  If trunks boxes or packages are to be sent by coaches or waggons into the country it is prudent to let some person be present at the packing up as a witness of the contents and to take a list of what the trunk c contains This person should then take it to the warehouse of the coach or waggon himself and deliver it to the bookkeeper see it booked and pay for the booking which is d In this case if it be lost you will be able to prove the contents and recover the value from the owner of the coach or waggon See STAGECOACHES  But let your servant be very careful not to leave the trunk c with any person standing at the door of the inn or in the innyard but to enquire for the bookkeeper and not part with his load till he can deliver it into the custody of the bookkeeper and see it booked On this account the porter should be able to read writing to know what he is about Rogues are very often about innyards to case such messengers of their loads  Such persons as you send with parcels from one part of the town to another should be cautioned not to be led into a public house by the way to drink with any supposed countryman nor to suffer any goodnatured  person in the street to give them a hand and help them on the way with their bundle or load for there are many of these obliging people in London streets that when they get possession of the bundle c will run away with it  If you hire a basketwoman at market or a porter to carry any thing for you home which you may have bought tell such person where they are to carry it and make them walk before you all the way Your eye will then be upon them and if they slip away from you it will he your own fault If it be inconvenient to attend them employ no such person but whom you know or is known to the person with whom you deal But if you buy of a shopkeeper they will always send the goods home  Never stop in a crowd in the streets to see what occasions it if you do it is two to one but you either lose your watch or your pockethandkerchief There are fellows who create disturbances for this purpose  Never carry any banknotes or bills about you without first entering in some book at home the number and date and particulars of such notes that in case you lose them or your pocket is picked of your book you stand some chance of recovering them or stop the payment  Also enter in some book at home the number maker's name c and description of your watch and whatever else of value you carry about you that you may know how to describe it if lost  Never part with such articles out of your hands to persons you are unacquainted with  If you would walk safe you would always avoid crowds stopping to look at the pictures in a printshop c See p No  If by chance you should drop any thing of value in the street whilst you are looking for it you will have many ask you what you have lost and offer to assist you in the search Tell them it is nothing of any consequence if you acquaint them you are likely never to find it as they will probably find it for you and keep it  Give directions to your servants on no condition to deliver any thing from your house to a stranger under a pretence of your having sent for it for instance a great coat or any other thing there are always villains ready to take advantage of their ignorance  For the same reason never let them take in a parcel for you under an idea that it came by such a carriage if they are to pay any thing for it for such packages have been sound to contain nothing but brickbats c In short never let them pay any thing without your knowledge or order so to do to any one Persons bringing things will often take the money before hand and ask for it again at the house they carry it to  Before you get into a hackneycoach or chair always take the number as if you leave any thing therein you may then by summoning the coachman or chairman to the Hackneycoach office probably recover it They may say they never saw it and possibly their next fare might find it and take it possibly so This is a lie for they always look when they set down a fare before they shut the door To be truly safe in this matter every one should look round the coach or chair before they quit it  Thieves have lately made a practice of knocking at doors in an evening under a pretence of delivering a letter and when the door is open if in a retired place have rushed in in numbers and robbed the family To avoid this a chain should be always put across the door within so as to admit the door to open a little way before dusk and the door not opened to a stranger but the letter if any taken in  If you do not sit in your frontparlour in an evening take care the windows are fastened down for men have been known to enter a house this way secrete themselves till the family is asleep and then rob the house or they have robbed that room only while the family have been backwards and decamped the same way  If the house next door to you is empty be cau  ous and fasten your backdoors and insideshutters of  the upper windows for villains will now and then secrete themselves in such empty houses and in the night get into the adjoining house by the backdoors or windows or from the leads Your garretwindows therefore should always be secured and trapdoors opening to the leads well bolted  Before you come out of any playhouse or place of public entertainment take care to secure your watch and your pockets for pickpockets are always about at such places  Never suffer any beggars to be begging at your door particularly if you live in any retired place for under a pretence of begging if they see no one in the way they will be sure to rob you of something  Do not suffer yourself to be imposed on by beggars in the streets for they have all their arts and will affect distress to excite your humanity if you have any thing to give it would be best bestowed to poor distressed families it is a mistaken charity to give to beggars in the streets whom the laws have provided for  Auctions in great thoroughfares in the daytime where men stand at the door and invite passengers are great impositions Slight illmade goods are made up for such auctions and if you buy it is ten to one but you are cheated and give twice the value of the article purchased Never buy at an auction but where the auctioneer is known to be a reputable man At auctions of linendrapery they will put perhaps sufficient painted muslin for a gown and a piece of dowlas worth d a yard and sell the two at one price per yard from an opinion that there may not be above thirty yards of dowlas you bid accordingly but when measured there shall be sixty of course you are deceived and cheated  For the same reason never buy at a pawnbrokers such articles as they display at their windows for a notion of buying things cheap has drawn many to buy at these places and this has led the pawnbrokers to get things made up purposely for sale in a slight manner Half the things at their windows are new and sold as secondhand  Indeed in purchasing it will be always sound best to purchase of and employ people of credit though you pay rather a greater price for they have a character at stake and will use you well in hopes of having your custom in future but if you buy in general of those who undersell the fair trader and advertise things at a very low price depend upon it unless you are a very good judge of the articles you buy and take especial care you will be taken in  People in distress are always wanting to borrow money and hold out advantageous terms in advertisements to lenders Be ever on your guard in this matter and also against those who publicly by advertisement offer to raise money on securities They will get the securities into their hands such as bonds notes c and will frequently shuffle you out of them To these the public have given the denomination of swindlers If you are in trade be cautious how you are taken in by customers you are a stranger to There are a number of people in town who live by getting goods on credit and taking in the incautious shopkeeper  Be very circumspect and cautious of having any thing to do with notes of hand or accepted drafts drawn by people you are unacquainted with for it is by such modes that the unwary are duped and robbed of their property  If you keep an open shop never suffer a stranger to leave a parcel in your shop under a pretence of having further to go and wishing it to be taken care of till his return unless you know the contents of the parcel Men have been known to leave contraband goods in this manner and go and inform against the shopkeeper in order to get the penalty In like manner a sack of unroasted coffee has been left at a grocer's and he has been exchequered in consequence of it  Never step in between persons quarrelling in the street unless you chuse to have your pocket picked These are often shamquarrels to collect people together for the opportunity of plundering them  Any one may arrest a felon even without a warrant  Where persons by fraud in gaming win above l they shall forfeit five times the value and suffer such corporal punishment as in cases of wilful perjury Ann c  Shopkeepers should be on their guard against persons coming in and looking over a great quantity of goods without purchasing Sharpers often making a genteel appearance will take an opportunity on these occasions when the shopkeeper's back is turned to pilser and purloin  In return buyers should always be careful that they are not imposed on by shopkeepers for they will often survey you from head to foot and ask a price according to their customer They will often ask s for an article at a coachside which they will sell for to a person on foot for half the money  Shopkeepers who have the reputation of selling cheap will evidently do so in some small articles the price of which every buyer is acquainted with but they take care to bring up the  leeway  as the seaman's phrase is and make you pay handsomely in other things In short every tradesman must live and there are such numbers of the same profession in London that they are obliged to make use of a variety of artifices to get custom and the buyer with all his cleverness and care shall not often be able to avoid being taken in  It often happens that if a parcel is sent in from the country by a waggon and ordered to be left till called for and you send for it that they will tell you no such thing is brought and then the porter of the inn will bring it in order to get a shilling or two in this case give him nothing but before you give him to understand so take possession of it otherwise he will take it back again should this fellow by way of revenge if any game is sent you and not ordered to be delivered not bring it and it spoils and the master of the waggon does not discharge him summon the master to the Court of Conscience for the value of the thing spoilt and you will be never served so again  Porters of inns are in general very exorbitant in their demands and very insolent If they ask too much for bringing a thing never pay it but tell them they may take it back again and you will send for it  Persons would do well to be careful of their hats in public companies for want of such care many a person has brought home an old hat for a new one There are welllooking men who will take an opportunity to exchange with you I knew a gentleman who always preserved his hat by pasting a paper  n the inside the crown on which he wrote his name and the words  Stolen from  over it Canes and great coats are at times in similar danger  See TAYLORS page and WALKING LONDON STREETS page  If the reader is desirous of a farther insight into the arts deceptions and frauds of the different professions he cannot read a more useful work for this purpose than a novel in three volumes lately published under the patronage of the Literary Society called  Modern Times  or the Adventures of  Gabriel Outcast  written in imitation of Gil Blas which while it improves him and makes him acquainted with the villainy of the world will exceedingly entertain him it being penned with great humour and by one who has apparently a thorough knowledge of life    There is a Society of Tradesmen c instituted in for the protection of their property against the inroads of felons forgers cheats c and to save the charges of prosecutions rewards and advertisements which are paid out of the public stock raised annually at five shillings each member which subscription tho' small has not only been found sufficient for the purposes intended but has enabled the Society to vest a sum in the funds besides leaving a considerable balance in the treasurer's hands  The intent of this Society is to prevent as far as possible the losses which tradesmen and others frequently suffer from the depredations of those miscreants who get their infamous livelihoods by robbing plundering and defrauding the honest and industrious part of mankind  and to pursue the most vigorous and effectual methods to bring such offenders to justice as they frequently escape the punishment their crimes deserve through the inability timidity avarice or indolence of those they injure which encourages them to continue their malpractices although such persons ought in duty to themselves and the public in general to use their utmost endeavours to put a stop to the career of such villains as otherwise they are in some measure by their omission the cause of the next robbery or fraud they commit  The secretary who is a Mr J Leigh of Shepherd'scourt Upper Brookstreet Grosvenorsquare is impowered to receive subscriptions  Where there are two or more partners in trade if five shillings only be subscribed they are intitled to the benefit of this Society when goods the joint property of the partners are stolen or obtained from them by fraud but not in cases of robbery on the highway or other robberies of their separate private property unless each partner subscribes five shillings  When any of the Society is robbed or defrauded he is immediately to apply to one of the committee whose names are given in a printed list and who will take such steps to pursue advertise or otherwise as shall be thought proper on the occasion  COURTS OF CONSCIENCE  ARE established in different parts of the town for the recovery of debts under s  There is one in

but they generally indulge the debtor with time to pay the money if he requests it They will suffer him to pay it at a shilling or sixpence a week this money must be regularly paid into the court or an attachment against the party issues and when the time elapses in which the whole debt is paid the plaintiff applies to the court for his money and receives it on paying a few pence  The plaintiffs and defendants in these courts are in general people so very low that a gentleman would sooner lose s than attend them If he is a defendant it is best to get some person to attend for him if plaintiff and can prove his demand he may even then get some person to apply for him but if he cannot prove his debt otherwise than by his own oath he should attend himself for if he has no other proof the plaintiff's oath is always sufficient Of course it is  better in these courts to be plaintiff than defendant for if the plaintiff swears to his debt no oath of the defendant will avail him  In order to recover in these courts the debt must be under s at least the claim must and both parties must reside in London The summons must be taken out in that court in whose district the defendant lives  No oath is required on taking out the summons nor is it necessary to spell the defendant's name right or know his christian name all that is required is to know where he is to be found that the summons may be left at his place of residence if the party will not attend by a summons it is necessary to get the christian name of the defendant in order to obtain an order and if he is a housekeeper this is readily got at by applying to the vestryclerk of the parish where he lives and examining the poorsrate book  THE MARSHALSEA COURT  WITHIN twelve miles of London the power of the Marshalsea court in the Borough extends Here by applying to any of the marshalseacourt attornies who live in Clifford'sinn Fleetstreet you may recover any sum above s and not exceeding l very speedily A writ taken out in this court costs s d with which the defendant is served and as the return day is every Friday the cause cannot be put off It will come to a hearing in the course of a week or two and the hearing in this court seldom exceeds a few pounds If your debt is l you may prosecute in this court by suing for four pounds and upwards and the person sued must pay your whole demand The costs in this court are paid always in advance as the process goes on  THE VERGE OF THE COURT  IS that ground about Whitehall and St James's which belongs to the crown and which is privileged from arrests This privileged place includes Charingcross on the north side of the way from the' corner of St Martin'slane to Hedgelane and both the King's meuses On the south side from the street leading into Springgardens to the public house beyond the Treasury and all Springgardens on the opposite side of the way from Northumberlandhouse to the end of Privygarden in Parliamentstreet taking in all Scotlandyard Whitehall and Privygarden It further includes all the parks the stableyard St James's Clevelandcourt and all Hydepark except the mere crossing from the Greenpark to Hydepark Most houses in the Verge let lodgings and I knew an artful fellow once that eluded all his creditors by residing there if he wanted to go out of it he took water at Whitehallstairs which place is privileged and as no writ can be served on the water without a waterbailiff's warrant which cannot be immediately procured he would land safely in the city or on the Surry side for a Middlesex writ loses its force in the city and in Surry unless backed by a city or Surry magistrate which requires time and preparation to get done so that if he landed in Surry he might take his horse and ride to the land'send or he would occasionally walk through the parks and order his horse to wait for him on the opposite side By this means he constantly eluded the sheriff's officers who could not be in every place or eternally watching him  To prevent this in some measure the Board of Green Cloth who has the controul of the verge will on application to them at St James'spalace summon the debtor to meet the plaintiff before them and the gentlemen there presiding will examine into the nature of the complaint enquire of the person then summoned what prospect he has of paying the debt and if his proposals of discharging it by instalments  or in a limited period be approved they will suffer him to continue in the Verge but if they find him disposed to act fraudulently they will tell him that the Verge shall not shelter him and if he does not immediately quit it they will order him to be arrested by their own officer but let the case be as it will they always give him notice to quit the place and give him a reasonable time to do it in but if he can make interest with any of the gentlemen of the Board he meets with favour there as a man does in all situations of life  A sheriff'sofficer arresting a man in the Verge will be punished by an application to the Board of Green Cloth and the person arrested will be discharged The Board or those who discharge the office of that Board sit two or three times a week Mr Bray attorney Great Russelstreet Bloomsbury is clerk of the Verge  The Tower is also a privileged place  HOTELS  THESE are taverns or inns under a new name so called from the hotels in Paris where you may be rather better accommodated than at the inns in and about London but at a much greater expence The inns and many coffeehouses for all the coffeehouses are now lodginghouses and taverns will let you a lodging at one shilling or eighteenpence a night whereas these hotels charge s d or s a night according to the goodness of the apartment and s a day for the use of a parlour or diningroom Two shillings a day for fire s ahead for breakfast and for your dinner according to what you order as dear as at the most expensive tavern Here indeed a gentleman may take his family for a few days till he can procure a lodging which he cannot do at a coffeehouse nor so well at an inn for want of proper accommodations And the servants of all these houses are very extravagant  in their expectations which you must accordingly gratify if you wish to be well attendedHairdressers at these hotels charge s each time of dressing out of which the master of the hotel has a profit whereas at inns and coffeehouses they will dress for d  Foreigners and strangers should be aware how they employ taylors or other tradesmen recommended by masters of hotels for they have a feeling in every thing They expect the persons they recommend to give them poundage that is so much in every pound they take of course the tradesman charges his customer accordingly  AMUSEMENTS  and  PLACES  worth a Stranger's

ascertain the exact expence of every article as some families may like to indulge in some one thing more than others but what is saved in one article may be spent on another  For every child less than four may be subtracted from the above l according to the foregoing estimate and for every child more than four must be added on an average as follows  Maintenance for each child per annum  L      Clothes                 If they keep but one maidservant by the foregoing estimate subtract annually L If three are kept add on an average l as the taxes increase with the number thus  Maintenance of a servant  L      Wages and tax                 The difference between a maidservant and a manservant if out of livery will be only the wages and tax l or l if in livery the addition also of the

      Decline in value of the horse about                 The addition of a onehorse Chaise will be as follows  Expence of the horse as above        Duty of the wheels        Wear and tear with care about        Oil and grease for even money suppose        Additional rent of a coachhouse                 Now should the person who looks after the horse leave you unprovided it would be attended with trouble and uneasiness and as the man may possibly cheat you and starve the beast it would be better if you can depend on a liverystable keeper's giving him the corn you order to keep him at livery The following then would be the expence  Thirtytwo weeks hay and corn three seeds aday at s d per week        Hostler        Shoeing bleeding strawyard grass c value of horse and chaise grease and

jobcarriage is on the road the coachmaster will expect an addition of s a night every night the horses are out to pay extra expences  But I know some gentlemen who keep a job and pay l a year only for coachman and horses giving the use of a stable when in the country This is the cheapest method of keeping a carriage Thus     Annually  Jobhorses and coachman        Present to coachman        Greatcoat hat and duty        Duty of wheels        Oil and grease        Wear and tear of carriage as before                 By this estimate the expences are less than keeping them in your own stable To be sure you have none of the coachman's service but that of driving but then on the other hand you are not liable to lose the use of your carriage by accidents attending the horses Indeed to keep a chariot and pair of horses properly three horses should be kept for the purpose and this advantage you have by hiring a job If you will give the coachman his board you may have all his time  In the foregoing and the following estimates I have not pointed out what a father of a family ought to lay by annually as a provision for his wife and children When he knows what his expences will be his income will naturally tell him what he can save Suffice it to say that l a year put out to interest at five per  cent will in twenty years produce l of course double the sum will produce l I have in the course of this work given the reader the terms of the different assuranceoffices for life where provision may be made for a family or a future day on easier terms  The principal haymarkets in London are Smithfield Whitechapel and the Haymarket Charingcross Marketdays are Tuesdays Thursdays and Saturdays  The averageprice of hay in London is l s a load and that of straw l s Good hay is sometimes bought for l s and sometimes it reaches l Straw will sometimes be so low as s at other times l s  A load of hay is thirtysix trusses each truss to weigh lb under a penalty a load of straw

for the children or lay out for other purposes                 It is impossible to give estimates to suit every family but it will be easy for any one to regulate his expences by these estimates adding or deducting for a child or a servant more or less or for the difference of houserent certain indulgences or the variation in the price of provisions If every mistress keeps a weekly book in the manner she will find pointed out to her in the next page and has an eye upon her servants should she exceed her expences one week she may retrench them in another  I must repeat here that or per
