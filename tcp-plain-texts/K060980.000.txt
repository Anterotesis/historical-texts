 Printed in the Year  AN Explanatory Preface  IT is not that I see any Reason to alter my Opinion in any thing I have Writ which occasions this Epistle but I find it necessary for the satisfaction of some Persons of Honour as well as Wit to pass a short Explication upon it and tell the World what I mean or rather what I do not mean in some things wherein I find I am liable to be misunderstood  I confess my self something surpriz'd to hear that I am tax'd with Bewraying my Own Nest and Abusing our Nation by Discovering the Meanness of our Original in order to make the  English  contemptible abroad and at home in which I think they are mistaken For why should not our Neighbours be as good as We to Derive from And I must add That had we been an Unmix'd Nation I am of Opinion it had been to our Disadvantage For to go on farther we have three Nations about us as clear from Mixtures of Blood as any in the World and I know not which of them I could wish our selves to be like I mean the  Scots  the  Welsh  and  Irish  and if I were to write a Reverse to the  Satyr  I would examine all the Nations of  Europe  and prove That those Nations which are most mixed are the best and have least of Barbarism and Brutality among them and abundance of Reasons might be given for it too long to bring into a  Preface  But I give this Hint to let the World know that I am far from thinking 'tis a  Satyr  upon the  English  Nation to tell them They are Deriv'd from all the Nations under Heaven that is  from several Nations  Nor is it meant to undervalue the Original of the  English  for we see no Reason to like them the worse being the Relicks of  Romans Danes Saxons  and  Normans  than we shoul'd ha' done if they had remain'd  Britains  that is  than if they had been all  Welshmen  But the Intent of the  Satyr  is pointed at the Vanity of those who talk of their Antiquity and value themselves upon their Pedigree their Ancient Families and being  True Born  whereas 'tis impossible we shou'd be  True Born  and if we could shou'd have lost by the Bargain  These sort of People who Call themselves  True Born  and tell long Stories of their Families and like a Nobleman of  Venice Think a Foreigner ought not to walk on the same side of the Street with them  are own'd to be meant in this  Satyr  What they would infer from their own Original I know not nor is it easie to make out whether they are the better or the worse for their Ancestors Our  English  Nation may Value themselves for their  Wit Wealth  and  Courage  and I believe few will dispute it with them but for long Originals and Ancient  True Born  Families of  English  I wou'd advise them to wave the Discourse A  True English  Man is one that deserves a Character and I have no where lessened him that I know of but as for a  True Born  English Man I confess I do not understand him  From hence I only infer That an  English  Man of all Men ought not to despise Foreigners  as such  and I think the Inference is just since  what they are to day we were yesterday and to morrow they will be like us  If Foreigners misbehave in their several Stations and Employments  I have nothing to do with that  the Laws are open to Punish them equally with Natives and let them have no Favour  But when I see the Town full of Lampoons and Invectives against  Dutchmen only because they are Foreigners  and the King Reproached and Insulted by Insolent Pedants and Balladmaking Poets for employing Foreigners and for being a Foreigner himself I confess my self mov'd by it to remind our Nation of their own Original thereby to let them see what a Banter is put upon our selves in it since speaking of  Englishmen ab Origine  we are really Foreigners our selves  I could go on to prove 'tis also Impolitick in us to discourage Foreigners since 'tis easie to make it appear that the multitudes of Foreign Nations who have took Sanctuary here have been the greatest Additions to the Wealth and Strength of the Nation the great Essential whereof is the Number of its Inhabitants Nor would this Nation have ever arriv'd to the Degree of Wealth and Glory it now boasts of if the addition of Foreign Nations both as to Manufactures and Arms had not been helpful to it This is so plain that he who is ignorant of it is too dull to be talked with  The  Satyr  therefore I must allow to be just till I am otherwise convinc'd because nothing can be more ridiculous than to hear our People boast of that Antiquity which if it had been true would have left us in so much worse a Condition than we are in now Whereas we ought rather to boast among our Neighbours that we are a part of themselves or the same Original as they but better'd by our Climate and like our Language and Manufactures deriv'd from them and improv'd by us to a Perfection greater than they can pretend to  This we might have valued our selves upon without Vanity But to disown our Descent from them talking big of our Ancient Families and long Originals and stand at a distance from Foreigners like the  Enthusiast  in Religion with a  Stand off I am more holy than thou  This is a thing so ridiculous in a Nation deriv'd from Foreigners as we are that I could not but attack them as I have done  And whereas I am threaten'd to be call'd to a Publick Account for this Freedom and the Publisher of this has been  NewPaper'd  in Goal already for it tho' I see nothing in it for which the Government can be displeased yet if at the same time those People who with an Unlimited Arrogance in Print every day  Affront the King Prescribe the Parliament and Lampoon the Government  may be either Punished or Restrained I am content to stand and fall by the Publick Justice of my Native Countrey which I am not sensible I have any where injur'd  Nor would I be misunderstood concerning the Clergy with whom if I have taken any License more than becomes a  Satyr  I question not but those Gentlemen who are Men of Letters are also Men of so much Candor as to allow me a Loose at the Crimes of the Guilty without thinking the whole Profession Lash'd who are Innocent I profess to have very mean Thoughts of those Gentlemen who have deserted their own Principles and expos'd even their Morals as well as Loyalty but not at all to think it affects any but such as are concern'd in the Fact  Nor wou'd I be misrepresented as to the Ingratitude of the  English  to the King and his Friends as if I meant the  English as a Nation  are so The contrary is so apparent That I wou'd hope it shou'd not be Suggested of me And therefore when I have brought in  Britannia  Speaking of the King I suppose Her to be the Representative or Mouth of the Nation as a Body But if I say we are full of such who daily affront the King and abuse his Friends who Print Scurrilous Pamphlets Virulent Lampoons and reproachful Publick Banters against both the King's Person and Government I say nothing but what is too true And that the  Satyr  is directed at such I freely own and cannot say but I shou'd think it very hard to be Censur'd for this  Satyr  while such remain Ʋnquestion'd and tacitly approv'd That I can mean none but such is plain ftom these few Lines  Ye Heavens regard Almighty  Jove  look down  And view thy Injur'd Monarch on the Throne  On their Ungrateful Heads due Vengeance take  Who sought his Aid and then his Part forsake  If I have fallen upon our Vices I hope none but the Vicious will be Angery As for Writing for Interest I disown it I have neither  Place  nor  Pension  nor  Prospect  nor  seek none  nor will  have none  If matter of Fact justifies the Truth of the Crimes the  Satyr  is Just As to the Poetick Liberties I hope the Crime is Pardonable I am  content to be Ston'd provided none will Attack me but the Innocent  If my CountryMen wou'd take the Hint and grow betterNatur'd from my  illNatur'd Poem  as some call it I would say this of it that tho' 'tis far from the best  Satyr  that ever was Wrote 'twould do the most Good that ever  Satyr  did  And yet I am ready to ask Pardon of some Gentlemen too who tho' they are  Englishmen  have good Nature enough to see themselves Reprov'd and can bear it These are Gentlemen in a true Sence that can bear to be told of their  Faux Pas  and not abuse the Reprover To such I must say this is no  Satyr  they are Exceptions to the General Rule and I value my Performance from their Generous Approbation more than I can from any Opinion I have of its Worth  The hasty Errors of my Verse I made my Excuse for before and since the time I have been upon it has been but little and my Leisure less I have all along strove rather to make the Thoughts Explicite than the Poem Correct However I have mended some Faults in this Edition  and the rest must be plac'd to my Account  As to Answers Banters  True English Billinsgate  I expect them till no Body will buy and then the Shop will be shut Had I wrote it for the Gain of the Press I should have been concern'd at its being Printed again and again by  Pyrates  as they call them and  ParagraphMen  But would They but do it Justice and Print it True according to the Copy they are welcome to Sell it for a Penny if they Please  The Pence indeed is the End of their Works I'll engage if no body will Buy no body will Write And not a PatriotPoet of them all now will in Defence of his Native Country  which I have abus'd they say  Print an  Answer  to it and give it about for  Godssake  THE PREFACE  THE End of Satyr is Reformation And the Author tho' he doubts the Work of Conversion is at a General Stop has put his Hand to the Plow  I expect a Storm of IllLanguage from the Fury of the Town and especially from those whose  English  Talent it is to Rail And without being taken for a Conjurer I may venture to foretell That I shall be Cavil'd at about my  Mean Stile Rough Verse  and  Incorrect Language  things I might indeed have taken more Care in But the Book is Printed and tho' I see some Faults 'tis too late to mend them And this is all I think needful to say to them  Possibly some body may take me for a  Dutchman  in which they are mistaken But I am one that would be glad to see  Englishmen  behave themselves better to Strangers and to Governours also that one might not be reproach'd in Foreign Countries for belonging to a  Nation that wants Manners  I assure you  Gentlemen  Strangers use us better Abroad and we can give no reason but our IllNature for the contrary here  Methinks an  Englishman  who is so Proud of being call'd  A Goodfellow  shou'd be Civil And it cannot be deny'd but we are in many Cases and particularly to Strangers the Churlishest People alive  As to Vices who can dispute our  Intemperance  while an  Honest  Drunken Fellow is a Character in a  Mans Praise All our Reformations are Banters and will be so till our Magistrates and Gentry Reform themselves by way of Example then and not till then they may be expected to Punish others without Blushing  As to our  Ingratitude  I desire to be understood of that particular People who pretending to be Protestants have all along endeavour'd to reduce the Liberties and Religion of this Nation into the Hands of King  James  and his Popish Powers Together with such who enjoy the Peace and Protection of the present Government and yet abuse and affront the King who procur'd it and openly profess their Uneasiness under him These by whatsoever Names or Titles they are dignified or distinguish'd are the People aim'd at Nor do I disown but that it is so much the Temper of an  Englishman  to abuse his Benefactor that I could be glad to see it rectified  They who think I have been Guilty of any Error in exposing the Crimes of my own Countrymen to themselves may among many honest Instances of the like Nature find the same thing in Mr  Cowely  in his Imitation of the second Olympick Ode of  Pindar  His Words are these  But in this Thankless World the Givers  Are Envy'd even by th' Receivers  'Tis now the Cheap and Frugal Fashion  Rather to hide than pay an Obligation  Nay 'tis much worse than so  It now an  Artifice  doth grow  Wrongs  and  Outrages  to do  Lest Men should think we  Owe  The Introduction  SPeak  Satyr  for there's none can tell like thee  Whether 'tis Folly Pride or Knavery  That makes this Discontented Land appear  Less Happy now in Times of Peace than War  Why Civil Feuds disturb the Nation more  Than all our Bloody Wars have done before  Fools out of Favour Grudge at Knaves in Place  And Men are always Honest in Disgrace  The Court Preferments make Men Knaves in course  But they which wou'd be in them wou'd be worse  'Tis not at Foreigners that we repine  Wou'd Foreigners their Perquisites resign  The Grand Contention's plainly to be seen  To get some Men put out and some put in  For this our Srs make long Harangues  And florid Mrs whet their polish'd Tongues  Statesmen are always sick of one Disease  And a good Pension gives them present Ease  That's the Specifick makes them all Content  With any King and any Government  Good Patriots at CourtAbuses rail  And all the Nation's Grievances bewail  But when the  Sov'reign Balsam  's once apply'd  The Zealot never fails to change his Side  And when he must the  Golden Key  resign  The  Railing Spirit  comes about again  Who shall this Bubbl'd Nation disabuse  While they their own Felicities refuse  Who at the Wars have made such mighty Pother  And now are falling out with one another  With needless Fears the Jealous Nation fill  And always have been sav'd against their Will  Who Fifty Millions  Sterling  have disburs'd  To be with Peace and too much Plenty Curs'd  Who their Old Monarch eagerly undo  And yet uneasily Obey the New  Search  Satyr  search a deep Incision make  The Poyson's strong the Antidote's too weak  'Tis pointed Truth must manage this Dispute  And downright English  Englishmen  Confute  Whet thy just Anger at the Nation's Pride  And with keen Phrase repel the Vicious Tide  To  Englishmen  their own beginnings show  And ask them why they slight their Neighbours so  Go back to elder Times and Ages past  And Nations into long Oblivion cast  To old  Britannia  's Youthful Days retire  And there for  TrueBorn Englishmen  enquire  Britannia  freely will disown the Name  And hardly knows her self from whence they came  Wonders that They of all Men shou'd pretend  To  Birth  and  Blood  and for a Name contend  Go back to Causes where our Follies dwell  And fetch the dark Original from Hell  Speak  Satyr  for there's none like thee can tell  The TrueBorn  Englishman  PART I  WHereever God erects a House of Prayer  The Devil always builds a Chappel there  And 'twill be found upon Examination  The latter has the largest Congregation  For ever

certain ne'er to be betray'd  Thro' all the World they spread his vast Command  And Death's Eternal Empire is maintain'd  They rule so Politickly and so well  As if they were L J of Hell  Duly divided to Debauch Mankind  And plant Infernal Dictates in his Mind  Pride  the first Peer and President of Hell  To his share  Spain  the largest Province fell  The subtile Prince thought fittest to bestow  On these the Golden Mines of  Mexico  With all the Silver Mountains of  Peru  Wealth which would in wise Hands the World undo  Because he knew their Genius was such  Too Lazy and too Haughty to be Rich  So proud a People so above their Fate  That if reduc'd to beg they'll beg in State  Lavish of Money to be counted Brave  And Proudly Starve because they Scorn to Save  Never was Nation in the World before  So very Rich and yet so very Poor  Lust  chose the Torrid Zone of  Italy  Where Blood ferments in Rapes and Sodomy  Where swelling Veins o'erflow with liquid Streams  With Heat impregnate from  Vesuvian  Flames  Whose flowing Sulphur forms Infernal Lakes  And humane Body of the Soil partakes  There Nature ever burns with hot Desires  Fann'd with Luxuriant Air from Subterranean Fires  Here undisturb'd in Floods of scalding Lust  Th' Infernal King Reigns with Infernal Gust  Drunk'nness  the Darling Favourite of Hell  Chose  Germany  to Rule and Rules so well  No

 He cares not to what Deity they Pray  What God they Worship most or in what way  Whether by  Luther Calvin  or by  Rome  They sail for Heav'n by Wine he Steers them home  Ungovern'd Passion settled

Hell's Favour none more great than they  The  Pagan  World he blindly leads away  And Personally Rules with Arbitrary Sway  The Mask thrown off  Plain Devil  his Title stands  And what elsewhere he

Ingratituds  a Devil of  Black Renown  Possess'd her very early for his own  An Ugly Surly Sullen Selfish Spirit  Who  Satan's  worst Perfections does inherit  Second to him in Malice and in Force  All  Devil without  and all  within  him  worse  He  made her FirstBorn Race to be so Rude  And suffer'd her so oft to be subdu'd  By sev'ral Crowds of wand'ring Thieves o'errun  Often unpeopl'd and

uncertain and unev'n  Deriv'd from all the Nations under Heav'n  The  Romans  first with  Julius Caesar  came  Including all the Nations of that Name  Gauls Greeks  and  Lombards  and by computation  Auxiliaries or Slaves of ev'ry Nation  With  Hengist Saxons Danes  with  Sueno  came  In search of Plunder not in search of Fame  Scots Picts  and  Irish  from th'  Hibernian  Shore  And Conqu'ring

Enrich'd he call'd them  Lords  To please their upstart Pride with new made words  And  Doomsday Book  his Tyranny Records  And here begins our Ancient Pedigree  That so exalts our poor Nobility  'Tis that from some  French  Trooper they derive  Who with the  Norman  Bastard did arrive  The Trophies of the Families appear  Some show the Sword the Bow and some the Spear  Which their great Ancestor  forsooth  did wear  These in the Heralds Register remain  Their Noble Mean Extraction to explain  Yet who the Heroe was no Man can tell  Whether a Drummer or a Colonel  The silent Record Blushes to

Devil  These are the Heroes that despise the  Dutch  And rail at newcome Foreigners so much  Forgetting that themselves are all deriv'd  From the most Scoundrel Race that ever liv'd  A horrid Crowd of Rambling Thieves and Drones  Who ransack'd Kingdoms and dispeopl'd Towns  The  Pict  and Painted  Britain  Treacherous  Scot  By Hunger Theft and Rapine hither brought  Norwegian  Pirates Buccaneering

Outcast Progeny  From  Henry  's time the Strolling Bands  Of banish'd Fugitives from Neighb'ring Lands  Have here a certain Sanctuary found  The Eternal Refuge of the Vagabond  Where in but half a common Age of Time  Borr'wing new Blood and Manners from the Clime  Proudly they learn all Mankind to contemn  And all their Race are  TrueBorn Englishmen  Dutch Walloons Flemmings Irishmen  and

Offspring of this Miscellaneous Crowd  Had not their new Plantations long enjoy'd  But they grew  Englishmen  and rais'd their Votes  At Foreign Shoals for  Interloping Scots  The  K  J  I  Royal

 and with  Foreign Whores  And carefully repeopled us again  Throughout his Lazy Long Lascivious Reign  With such a blest and Trueborn  English  Fry  As much Illustrates our Nobility  A Gratitude which will so black appear  As future Ages must abhor to hear  When they look back on all that Crimson Flood  Which stream'd in  Lindsey  's and  Caernarvon  's Blood  Bold  Strafford Cambridge Capel

Foreigners despise  Be Surly like us all and just as Wise  Thus from a mixture of all kinds began  That Het'rogeneous  Thing An Englishman  In eager Rapes and furious Lust begot  Betwixt a Painted  Britain  and a  Scot  Whose gend'ring Offspring quickly learn'd to Bow  And yoke their Heifers to the  Roman  Plow  From whence a Mongrel halfbred Race there came  With neither Name nor Nation Speech nor Fame  In whose hot Veins new Mixtures quickly ran  Infus'd betwixt a  Saxon  and a  Dane  While their Rank Daughters to their Parents just  Receiv'd all Nations with promiscuous Lust  This Nauseous Brood directly did contain  The well extracted Brood of  Englishmen  Which Medly canton'd in a Heptarchy  A Rhapsody of Nations to supply  Among themselves maintain'd eternal Wars  And still

 For  Englishmen  to boast of Generation  Cancels their Knowledge and Lampoons the Nation  A  TrueBorn Englishman  's a contradiction  In Speech an Irony in Fact a Fiction  A Banter made to be a test

know they speak  And often their own Councils undermine  By their Infirmity and not Design  From whence the Learned say it does proceed  That  English  Treasons never can succeed  For they're so openhearted you may know  Their own most secret Thoughts and others too  The Lab'ring Poor in spight of Double Pay  Are Sawcy▪ Mutinous and Beggarly  So lavish of their  Money  and their  Time  That want of Forecast is the Nation's Crime  Good Drunken Company is their Delight  And what they get by Day they spend by Night  Dull  Thinking  seldom does their Heads engage  But Drink their Youth away and Hurry on Old Age  Empty of all good Husbandry and Sense  And void of Manners most when void of Pence  Their strong Aversion to Behaviour's such  They always talk too little or too much  So dull they never take the pains to think  And seldom are goodnatur'd  but in Drink  In  English  Ale their dear Enjoyment lies  For which they'll starve themselves and Families  An  Englishman  will fairly Drink as much  As will maintain two Families of  Dutch  Subjecting all their Labour to their Pots  The greatest Artists are the greatest Sots  The Country poor do by Example live  The Gentry lead them and the Clergy drive  What may we not from such Examples hope  The Landlord is their God the Priest their Pope  A Drunken Clergy and a Swearing Bench  Has giv'n the Reformation such a Drench  As wise Men think there is some cause to doubt  Will Purge good Manners and Religion out  Nor do the Poor alone their Liquor prize  The Sages join in this great Sacrifice  The Learned Men who study  Aristotle  Correct him with an Explanation Bottle  Praise  Epicurus  rather than  Lysander  And  The Drunkards Name for Canary  Aristippus  more than  Alexander  The Doctors too their  Galen  here resign  And gen'rally prescribe  Specifick Wine  The Graduates Study's grown an 'easier  Task  While for the  Ʋrinal  they toss the  Flask  The Surgeon's Art grows plainer ev'ry Hour  And Wine's the Balm which into Wounds they pour  Poets long since  Parnassus  have forsaken  And say the ancient Bards were all mistaken  Apollo  's lately Abdicate and fled  And good King  Bacchus  governs in his stead  He does the Chaos of the Head refine  And AtomThoughts jump into Words by Wine  The Inspirations of a finer Nature  As Wine must needs excel  Parnassus  Water  Statesmen their weighty Politicks refine  And Soldiers raise their Courages by Wine  Caecilia  gives her Choristers their Choice  And lets them all drink Wine to clear their Voice  Some think the Clergy first found out the way  And Wine's the only Spirit by which they Pray  But others less prophane than so agree  It clears the Lungs and helps the Memory  And therefore all of them Divinely think  Instead of Study 'tis as well to Drink  And here I would be very glad to know  Whether our  Asgilites  may Drink or no  Th' enlightning Fumes of Wine would certainly  Assist them much when they  begin to fly  Or if a Fiery Chariot shou'd appear  Inflam'd by Wine they'd ha' the less to fear  Even the Gods themselves as Mortals say  Were they on Earth wou'd be as Drunk as they  Nectar  would be no more Celestial Drink  They'd all take  Wine  to teach them how to think  But  English  Drunkards Gods and Men out do  Drink their Estates away and Money too  Colon  's in Debt and if his Friends should fail  To help him out must Die at last in Goal  His  Wealthy Ʋncle  sent a Hundred Nobles  To pay his trifles off and rid him of his troubles  But  Colon  like a  TrueBorn Englishman  Drank all the Money out in Bright  Champaign  And  Colon  does in Custody remain  Drunk'ness has been the Darling of this Realm  E'er since a Drunken Pilot had the Helm  In their Religion they are so uneven  That each Man goes  his own Byway to Heaven  Tenacious of mistakes to that Degree  That ev'ry Man pursues it sep'rately  And fancies none can find the way but he  So shy of one another they are grown  As if they strove to get to Heav'n alone  Rigid and Zealous Positive and Grave  And ev'ry Grace but Charity they have  This makes them so Illnatur'd and uncivil  That all Men think an  Englishman  the Devil  Surly to Strangers Froward to their Friend  Submit to Love with a reluctant Mind  Resolv'd to be Ungrateful and Unkind  If by Necessity reduc'd to ask  The Giver has the difficultest task  For what's bestow'd they awkwardly receive  And always take less freely than they give  The Obligation is their Highest Grief  And never Love where they accept Relief  So sullen in their Sorrow that 'tis known  They'll rather die than their Afflictions own  And if reliev'd it is too often true  That they'll abuse their Benefactors too  For in Distress their Haughty Stomach's such  They hate to see themselves oblig'd too much  Seldom contented often in the Wrong  Hard to be Pleas'd at all and never long  If your Mistakes their IllOpinion gain  No Merit can their Favour reobtain  And if they're not Vindictive in their Fury  'Tis their Unconstant  Temper  does secureye  Their Brains so cool their  Passion  seldom burns  For all's condens'd before the Flame returns  The Fermentation's of so weak a Matter  The Humid damps the fume and runs it all to Water  So tho' the Inclination may be strong  They're Pleas'd by fits and never Angry long  Then if Good Nature shows some slender Proof  They never think they have Reward enough  But like our  Modern Quakers  of the Town  Expect your Manners and return you none  Friendship  th' abstracted Union of the Mind  Which all Men seek but very few can find  Of all the Nations in the Universe  None Talk on't more or Understand it less  For if it does their Property annoy  Their Property their Friendship will destroy  As you discourse them you shall hear them tell  All things in which they think they do excel  No Panegyrick needs their Praise record  An  Englishman  ne'er wants his own good Word  His long Discourses gen'rally appear  Prologu'd with his own wond'rous Character  But first to illustrate his own good Name  He never fails his Neighbour to defame  And yet he really designs no wrong  His Malice goes no further than his Tongue  But pleas'd to Tattle he Delights to Rail  To satisfie the Letch'ry of a Tale  His own dear Praises close the ample Speech  Tells you how Wise he is  that is how Rich  For Wealth is Wisdom he that's Rich is Wise  And all Men Learned Poverty Despise  His Generosity comes next and then  Concludes that he's a  TrueBornEnglishman  And they 'tis known are Generous and Free  Forgetting and Forgiving Injury  Which may be true thus rightly understood  Forgiving Ill turns and Forgetting Good  Chearful in Labour when they've undertook it  But out of Humour when they're out of Pocket  But if their Belly and their Pocket's full  They may be Phlegmatick but never Dull  And if a Bottle does their Brains refine  It makes their Wits as sparkling as their Wine  As for the general Vices which we find  They're guilty of in common with Mankind  Satyr  forbear and silently endure  We must conceal the Crimes we cannot cure  Nor shall my Verse the brighter Sex defame  For  English  Beauty will preserve her Name  Beyond dispute Agreeable and Fair  And Modester than other Nations are  For where the Vice prevails the great Temptation  Is want of Money more than Inclination  In general this only is allow'd  They're something Noisy and a little Proud  An  Englishman  is gentlest in Command  Obedience is a Stranger in the Land  Hardly subjected to the Magistrate  For  Englishmen  do all Subjection hate  Humblest when Rich but Peevish when they're Poor  And think whate'er they have they merit more  The meanest  English  Plowman studies Law  And keeps thereby the Magistrates in Awe  Will boldly tell them what they have to do  And sometimes punish their Omissions too  Their Liberty and Properties so dear  They Scorn their Laws or Governours to fear  So Bugbear'd with the Name of Slavery  They can't submit to their own Liberty  Restraint from ill is Freedom to the Wise  But  Englishmen  do all Restraint Despise  Slaves to their Liquor Drudges to the Pots  The Mob are Statesmen and their Statesmen Sots  Their Governors they count such dangerous things  That 'tis their Custom to affront their Kings  So jealous of the Power their Kings possess'd  They suffer neither Power nor King to rest  The Bad with Force they easily subdue  The Good with constant Clamours they pursue  And did King  Jesus  Reign they'd murmur too  A discontented Nation and by far  Harder to Rule in times of Peace than War  Easily set together by the Ears  And full of causeless Jealousies and Fears  Apt to Revolt and willing to Rebel  And never are contented when they're well  No Government cou'd ever please them long  Cou'd Tye their Hands or rectifie their Tongue  In this to Ancient  Israel  well compar'd  Eternal Murmurs are among them heard  It was but lately that they were opprest  Their Rights Invaded and their Laws supprest  When nicely tender of their Liberty  Lord What a Noise they made of Slavery  In Daily Tumult show'd their Discontent  Lampoon'd the King and mock'd his Government  And if in Arms they did not first appear  'Twas want of Force and not for want of Fear  In humbler Tone than  English  us'd to do  At Foreign Hands for Foreign Aid they sue  William  the Great Successor of  Nassau  Their Prayers heard and their Oppressions saw  He saw and sav'd them God and Him they Prais'd  To this their Thanks to that their Trophies rais'd  But glutted with their own Felicities  They soon their New Deliverer Despise  Say all their Prayersback their Joy disown  Unsing their Thanks and pull their Trophies down  Their Harps of Praise are on the Willows hung  For  Englishmen  are ne'er Contented long  The Rev'rend Clergy too And who wou'd ha' thought  That they who had such NonResistance Taught  Should e'er to Arms against their Prince be brought  Who up to Heaven did Regal Pow'er advance  Subjecting  English  Laws to Modes of  France  Twisting Religion so with Loyalty  As one cou'd never Live and t'other Die  And yet no sooner did their Prince design  Their Glebes and Perquisites to undermine  But all their Passive Doctrines lay'd aside  The Clergy their own Principles deny'd  Unpreach'd their Nonresisting Cant and Pray'd  To Heaven for Help and to the  Dutch  for Aid  The Church chim'd all her Doctrines back again  And Pulpit Champions did the Cause maintain  Flew in the Face of all their former Zeal  And NonResistance did at once repeal  The  Rabbies  say it would be too prolix  To tye Religion up to Politicks  The Churches Safety is  Suprema Lex  And so by a new Figure of their own  Their former Doctrines all at once disown  As Laws  Post Facto  in the Parliament  In urgent Cases have obtain'd Assent  But are as dangerous Presidents lay'd by  Made Lawful only by Necessity  The Rev'rend Fathers then in Arms appear  And Men of God become the Men of War  The Nation  Fir'd by them  to Arms apply  Assault their Antichristian Monarchy  To their due Channel all our Laws restore  And made things what they shou'd ha' been before  But when they came to fill the Vacant Throne  And the  Pale Priests  look'd back on what they'd done  How  English  Liberty began to thrive  And Church of  England  Loyalty outlive  How all their persecuting Days were done  And their Deliv'rer plac'd upon the Throne  The Priests  as Priests are wont to do  turn'd Tail  They're  Englishmen  and  Nature will prevail  Now they deplore the Ruins they ha' made  And murmur for the Master they betray'd  Excuse those Crimes they cou'd not make him mend  And suffer for the Cause they cann't defend  Pretend they'd not have carry'd things so high  And ProtoMartyrs make for Popery  Had the Prince done as they design'd the thing  Ha' set the Clergy  up to Rule the King  Taken a  Donative  for coming hither  And so ha' left their King and them together  We had say they been now a happy Nation  No doubt we had seen a Blessed Reformation  For Wise Men say 'tis as dang'rous a thing  A Ruling Priesthood as a Priestrid King  And of all Plagues with which Mankind are Curst  Ecclesiastick Tyranny's the Worst  If all our former Grievances were feign'd  King  James  has been abus'd and we Trapann'd  Bugbear'd with Popery and Power Despotick  Tyrannick Government and Leagues Exotick  The Revolution's a Phanatick Plot  W  a Tyrant  S  a Sot  A Factious Army and a Poyson'd Nation  Unjustly forc'd King  James  's Abdication  But if he did the Subjects Rights invade  Then he was Punish'd only not betray'd  And Punishing of Kings is no such Crime  But  Englishmen  ha' done it many a Time  When Kings the Sword of Justice first lay down  They are no Kings tho' they posses the Crown  Titles are Shadows Crowns are empty things  The Good of Subjects is the End of Kings  To guide in War and to protect in Peace  Where Tyrants once commence the Kings do cease  For Arbitrary Power's so strange a thing  It makes the  Tyrant  and unmakes the King  If Kings by Foreign Priests and Armies Regin  And Lawless Power against their Oaths Maintain  Then Subjects must ha' reason to Complain  If Oaths must bind us when our Kings do Ill  To call in Foreign Aid is to Rebel  By force to Circumscribe our Lawful Prince  Is willful Treason in the largest Sense  And they who once Rebel most certainly  Their God and King and former Oaths defie  If we allow no MaleAdministration  Could cancel the Allegiance of the Nation  Let all our Learned  Sons of Levi  try  This Eccles'astick Riddle to unty  How they could make a Step to Call the Prince  And yet pretend to Oaths and Innocence  By th' first Address they made beyond the Seas  They're Perjur'd in the most intense Degrees  And without Scruple for the time to come  May Swear to all the Kings in  Christendom  And truly did our Kings consider all  They'd never let the Clergy Swear at all  Their Politick Allegiance they'd refuse  For Whores and Priests do never want Excuse  But if the  Mutual Contract  was dissolv'd  The Doubt's explain'd the difficultys 'solv'd  That Kings when they Descend to Tyranny  Dissolve the Bond and leave the Subject free  The Governments ungirt when Justice dies  And Constitutions are nonEntities  The Nations all a Mob there's no such thing  As Lords or Commons Parliament or King  A great promiscuous Crowd the Hydra lies  Till Laws revive and Mutual Contract ties  A Chaos free to chuse for their own share  What Case of Government they please to wear  If to a King they do the Reins commit  All Men are bound in Conscience to submit  But then that King must by his Oath assent  To  Postulata's  of the Government  Which if he breaks he cuts off the Entail  And Power retreats to its Original  This Doctrine has the Sanction of Assent  From Nature's Universal Parliament  The Voice of Nature and the Course of Things  Allow that Laws superiour are to Kings  None but Delinquents would have Justice cease  Knaves rail at Laws as Soldiers rail at Peace  For Justice is the End of Government  As Reason is the Test of Argument  No Man was ever yet so void of Sense  As to Debate the Right of SelfDefence  A Principle so grafted in the Mind  With Nature born and does like Nature bind  Twisted with Reason and with Nature too  As neither one or t'other can undo  Nor can this Right be less when National  Reason which governs one shou'd govern all  Whate'er the Dialects of Courts may tell  He that his Right Demands can ne'er Rebel  Which Right if 'tis by Governours deny'd  May be procur'd by Force or Foreign Aid  For Tyranny's a Nation's Term of Grief  As Folks cry  Fire  to hasten in Relief  And when the hated Word is heard about  All Men shou'd come to help the People out  Thus  England  groan'd  Britannia  's Voice was heard  And Great  Nassau  to rescue her appear'd  Call'd by the Universal Voice of Fate  God  and the  Peoples  Legal Magistrate  Ye Heav'ns regard Almighty  Jove  look down  And view thy Injur'd Monarch on the Throne  On their Ungrateful Heads due Vengeance take  Who sought his Aid and then his part forsake  Witness ye  Powers  It was our Call alone  Which now our Pride makes us asham'd to own  Britannia  's Troubles fetch'd him from afar  To Court the dreadful Casualties of War  But where Requital never can be made  Acknowledgements a Tribute seldom pay'd  He dwelt in Bright  Maria  's Circling Arms  Defended by the Magick of her Charms  From Foreign Fears and from Domestick Harms  Ambition found no Fuel to her Fire  He had what God cou'd give or Man desire  Till  Pity  rowz'd him from his soft Repose  His Life to unseen Hazards to expose  Till  Pity  mov'd him in our Cause t' appear  Pity  that Word which now we hate to hear  But  English  Gratitude is always such  To hate the Hand which does oblige to much  Britannia  's Cries gave Birth to his Intent  And hardly gain'd his unforeseen Assent  His boding Thoughts foretold him he should find  The People Fickle Selfish and Unkind  Which Thought did to his Royal Heart appear  More dreadful than the Dangers of the War  For nothing grates a generous Mind so soon  As base Returns for hearty Service done  Satyr be silent  awsully prepare  Britannia  's Song and  William  's Praise to hear  Stand by and let her chearfully rehearse  Her Grateful Vows in her Immortal Verse  Loud Fames eternal Trumpet let her sound  Listen ye distant Poles and endiess Round  May the strong Blast the Welcome News convey  As for as Sound can reach or Spirit can fly  To  Neighb'ring Worlds  if such there be relate  Our Heroes Fame for theirs to imitate  To distant Worlds of Spirits let her rehearse  For Spirits without the help of Voice Converse  May Angels hear the gladsome News on high  Mix'd with their everlasting Symphony  And Hell it self stand in Suspence to know  Whether it be the Fatal Blast or no  BRITANNIA  The Fame of Vertue 'tis for which I sound  And Heroes with Immortal Triumphs Crown'd  Fame Built on solid Vertue swifter flies  Than MorningLight can spread my  Eastern Skies  The gath'ring Air returns the doubling Sound  And Loud Repeating Thunders force it round  Eccboes return from Caverns of the Deep  Old Chaos Dream't on't in Eternal Sleep  Time hands it forward to its latest Ʋrn  From whence it never never shall return  Nothing is heard so far or lasts so long  'Tis heard by ev'ry Ear and spoke by ev'ry Tongue  My Heroe with the Sails of Honour Furl'd  Rises like the Great Genius of the World  By Fate and Fame wisely prepar'd to be  The Soul of War and Life of Victory  He spreads the Wings of Vertue on the Throne  And ev'ry Wind of  Glory  fans them on  Immortal Trophies dwell upon his Brow  Fresh as the Garlands he has won but now  By different Steps the high Ascent he gains  And differently that high Ascent maintains  Princes for Pride and  Lust of Rule  make War  And struggle for the Name of Conqueror  Some Fight for Fame and some for Victory  He Fights to Save and Conquers to set Free  Then seek Phrase his  Titles  to conceal  And hide with Words what Actions must reveal  No Parallel from  Hebrew  Stories take  Of Godlike Kings my Similies to make  No borrow'd Names conceal my living Theam  But Names and Things directly I Proclaim  'Tis honest Merit does his Glory raise  Whom that Exalt's let no Man fear to Praise  Of such a Subject no Man need be shy  Vertue's above the Reach of Flattery  He needs no Character but his own Fame  Nor any flatt'ring Titles but his Name  Willam  's the Name that's spoke by ev'ry Tongue  William  's the Darling Subject of my Song  Listen ye Virgins to the Charming Sound  And in Eternal Dances hand it round  Your Early Offerings to this Altar bring  Make him at once a Lover and a King  May he submit to none but to your Arms  Nor never be subdu'd  but by your Charms  May your soft thoughts for him be all Sublime  And ev'ry tender Vow he made for him  May he be first in ev'ry Morningthought  And Heav'n ne'er hear a Pray'r  when he's left out  May ev'ry Omen ev'ry Boding Dream  Be  Fortunate  by mentioning his Name  May this one Charm Infernal Power affright  And guard you from the Terrors of the Night  May every chearful Glass as it goes down  To  William's  Health  be Cordials to your own  Let every Song be Chorust with his Name  And Musick pay a Tribute to his Fame  Let ev'ry Poet tune his Artful Verse  And in Immortal Strains his Deeds rehearse  And may  Apollo  never more inspire  The Disobedient Bard with his Seraphick Fire  May all my Sons their Grateful Homage pay  His Praises Sing and for his Safety Pray  Satyr return  to our Unthankful Isle  Secur'd by Heavens Regard and  Williams  's Toil  To both Ungrateful and to both Untrue  Rebels to God and to Good Nature too  If e'er this Nation be Distress'd again  To whomsoe'er they cry they'll cry in vain  To Heav'n they cannot have the Face to look  Or if they should it wou'd but Heav'n provoke  To hope for Help from Man wou'd be too much  Mankind would always tell them of the  Dutch  How they came here our Freedoms to obtain  Were  Pay'd  and  Curs'd  and  Hurry'd home again  How by their Aid we first dissolv'd our Fears  And then our Helpers Damn'd for Foreigners  'Tis not our  English  temper to do better  For  Englishmen  think every Man their Debtor  'Tis worth observing that we ne'er complain'd  Of Foreigners nor of the Wealth they gain'd  Till all their Services were at an end  Wise Men affirm it is the  English  way  Never to Grumble till they come to Pay  And then they always think their temper's such  The Work too little and the Pay too much  As frighted Patients when they want a Cure  Bid any Price and any Pain endure  But when the Doctors Remedies appear  The Cure's too Easie and the Price too Dear  Great  Portland  ne'er was banter'd when he strove  For Us his Master's kindest thoughts to move  We ne'er Lampoon'd his Conduct when employ'd  King  James  's Secret Councils to divide  Then we caress'd him as the only Man  Which could the doubtful Oracle explain  The only  Hushai  able to repel  The dark Designs of our  Achitopel  Compar'd his Masters Courage to his Sense  The Ablest Statesman and the Bravest Prince  On his wise Conduct we depended much  And lik'd him ne'er the worse for being  Dutch  Nor was he valu'd more than he deserv'd  Freely he ventur'd faithfully he serv'd  In all King  William  's Dangers he has shar'd  In  England  's Quarrels always he appear'd  The Revolution first and then the  Boyne  In both his Counsels and his Conduct shine  His Martial Valour  Flanders  will confess  And  France Regrets  his managing the Peace  Faithful to  Englands  Interest and her King  The greatest Reason of our murmuring  Ten Years in  English  Service he appear'd  And gain'd his Masters and the Worlds Regard  But 'tis not  Englands  Custom to Reward  The Wars are over  England  needs him not  Now he's a  Dutchman  and  the Lord knows what  Schombergh  the Ablest Soldier of his Age  With  Great Nassau  did in our cause engage  Both joyn'd for  England  's Rescue and Defence  The greatest Captain and the greatest Prince  With what Applause his Stories did we tell  Stories which  Europe  's Volumes largely swell  We counted him an Army in our Aid  Where He Commanded no Man was afraid  His Actions with a constant Conquest shine  From  VillaVitiosa  to the  Rhine  France Flanders Germany  his Fame confess  And all the World was fond of him but Us  Our Turn first serv'd we grudg'd him the Command  Witness the Grateful Temper of the Land  We blame the K that he relies too much  On Strangers  Germans Hugonots  and  Dutch  And seldom does his great Affairs of State  To  English  Counsellors communicate  The Fact might very well be answer'd thus  He has so often been betray'd by us  He must have been a Madman to Rely  On  English  Gns Fidelity  For laying other Arguments aside  This thought might mortifie our  English  Pride  That Foreigners have faithfully Obey'd him  And none but  Englishmen  have e'er Betray'd him  They have our Ships and Merchants bought and sold  And barter'd  English  Blood for Foreign Gold  First to the  French  they sold our  Turky  Fleer  And Injur'd  Talmarsh  next at  Camaret  The King himself is shelter'd from their Snares  Not by his Merit but the Crown he wears  Experience tells us 'tis the  English  way  Their Benefactors always to betray  And least Examples should be too Remote  A Modern Magistrate of Famous Note  Shall give you his own Character by Rote  I'll make it out deny it he that can  His Worship is a  TrueBorn  Englishman  In all the Latitude of that empty Word  By Modern Acceptations understood  The ParishBooks his great Descent Record  And now he hopes e're long to be a Lord  And truly as things go it would be pity  But such as he should  Represent  the City  While Robb'ry for BurntOffering he brings  And gives to God what he has stole from Kings  Great Monuments of Charity he raises  And good  St Magnus  whistles out his Praises  To CityGoals he grants a Jubilee  And hires Huzza's from his own Mobilee  Lately he wore the Golden Chain and Gown  With which Equipt he thus Harangu'd the Town  His Fine Speech  c  With Clouted Iron Shooes and Sheepskin Breeches  More Rags than Manners and more Dirt than Riches  From driving Cows and Calves to  Layton  Market  While of my Greatness there appear'd no Spark yer  Behold I come to let you see the Pride  With which Exalted Beggars always Ride  Born to the Needful Labours of the Plow  The CartWhip Grac'd me as the Chain does now  Nature and Fate in doubt what Course to take  Whether I shou'd a Lord or FloughBoy make  Kindly at last resolv'd they wou'd promote me  And first  a Knave  and then  a Knight  they Vote me  What Fate appointed Nature did prepare  And furnish'd me with an exceeding Care  To fit me for what they design'd to have me  And ev'ry Gift  but Honesty  they gave me  And thus Equipp'd to this Proud Town I came  In quest of Bread and not in quest of Fame  Blind to my future Fate a humble Boy  Free from the  Guilt and Glory  I enjoy  The hopes which my Ambition entertain'd  Were in the Name of  FootBoy  all contain'd  The Greatest Heights from Small Beginnings rise  The Gods were Great on Earth before they reach'd the Skies  Bwell  the Generous Temper of whose Mind  Was ever to be bountiful inclin'd  Whether by his ill Fate or Fancy led  First took me up and furnish'd me with Bread  The little Services he put me to  Seem'd Labours rather than were truly so  But always my Advancement he design'd  For 'twas his very Nature to be kind  Large was his Soul his Temper ever free  The best of Masters and of Men to me  And I who was before decreed by Fate  To be made Infamous as well as Great  With an obsequious Diligence obey'd him  Till trusted with his All  and then betray'd him  All his past Kindnesses I trampled on  Ruin'd his Fortunes to erect my own  So Vipers in the Bosom bred begin  To hiss at that Hand first which took them in  With eager Treach'ry I his Fall pursu'd  And my first Trophies were  Ingratitude  Ingratitude  the worst of Humane Guilt  The basest Action Mankind can commit  Which like the Sin against the Holy Ghost  Has least of Honour and of Guilt the most  Distinguish'd from all other Crimes by this  That 'tis a Crime which no Man will confess  That Sin alone which shou'd not be forgiv'n  On Earth altho' perhaps it may in Heav'n  Thus my first Benefactor I o'rethrew  And how shou'd I be to a second true  The Publick Trusts came next into my Care  And I to use them scurvily prepare  My Needy Sov'reign Lord I play'd upon  And lent him many a thousand of his own  For which great Int'rests I took care to Charge  And so my illgot Wealth became so large  My Predecessor  Judas  was a Fool  Fitter to ha' been whip'd and sent to School  Than Sell a Saviour Had I been at Hand  His Master had not been so cheap trapann'd  I woud ha' made the eager  Jews  ha' found  For thirty Pieces thirty thousand Pound  My Cousin  Ziba  of Immortal Fame  Ziba  and I shall never want a Name    Firstborn of Treason Nobly did Advance  His Masters Fall for his Inheritance  By whose keen Arts old  David  first began  To break his Sacred Oath with  Jonathan  The Good Old King 'tis thought was very loth  To break his Word and therefore broke his Oath  Ziba  's a Traytor of some Quality  Yet  Ziba  might ha' been inform'd by me  Had I been there he ne'er had been Content  With half th' Estate nor half the Government  In our late Revolution 'twas thought strange  That I of all Mankind shou'd like the Change  But they who wonder'd at it never knew  That in it I did my old Game pursue  Nor had they heard of Twenty thousand Pound  Which never yet was lost nor ne'er was found  Thus all things in their turn to Sale I bring  God and my Master first and then the King  Till by successful Villanies made Bold  I thought to turn the Nation into Gold  And so to Forgy my Hand I bent  Not doubting I cou'd gull the Government  But there was ruffl'd by the Parliament  And if I scap'd the Unhappy Tree to Climb  'Twas want of Law and not for want of Crime  But my  The Devil  Old Friend  who Printed in my Face  A needful Competence of  English  Brass  Having more Business yet for me to do  And loth to lose his Trusty Servant so  Manag'd the Matter with such Art and Skill  As sav'd his Heroe and threw down the Bll  And now I'm Grac'd with unexpected Honours  For which I'll certainly abuse the Donors  Knighted and made a Tribune of the People  Whose Laws and Properties I'm like to keep well  The  Custos Rotulorum  of the City  And Captain of the Guards of their  Banditie  Surrounded by my Catchpoles I declare  Against the Needy Debtor open War  I Hang poor Thieves for stealing of your Pelf  And suffer none to Rob you but my self  The King Commanded me to help Reform ye  And how I'll do't Miss shall inform ye  I keep the best Seraglio in the Nation  And hope in time to bring it into Fashion  No  Brimstone Whore  need fear the Lash for me  That part I'll leave to Brother  Jeffery  Our Gallants need not go abroad to  Rome  I'll keep a Whoring Jubilee at Home  Whoring's the Darling of my Inclination  An't I a Magistrate for Reformation  For this my Praise is sung by ev'ry Bard  For which  Bridewell  wou'd be a just Reward  In Print my Panegyricks fill the Streets  And hired GoalBirds their Huzza's Repeat  Some Charities contriv'd to make a show  Have taught the Needy Rabble to do so  Whose empty Noise is a Mechanick Fame  Since for Sir  Belzebub  they'd do the the same  The Conclusion  THen let us boast of Ancestors no more  Or Deeds of Heroes done in Days of Yore  In latent Records of the Ages past  Behind the Rear of time in long Oblivion plac'd  For if our Vertues must in Lines descend  The Merit with the Families would end  And Intermixtures would most fatal grow  For Vice would be Hereditary too  The tainted Blood wou'd of Necessity  In Voluntary Wickedness convey  Vice like Illnature for an Age or two  May seem a Generation to pursue  But Vertue seldom does regard the Breed  Fools do the Wise and Wise Men Fools succeed  What is't to us what Ancestors we had  If Good what better Or what worse if Bad  Examples are for imitation set  Yet all Men follow Vertue with Regret  Cou'd but our Ancestors retrieve the Fate  And see their Offspring thus Degenerate  How we contend for Birth and Names unknown  And Build on their past Actions not our own  They'd Cancel Records and their Tombs Deface  And openly disown the Vile Degenerate Race  For Fame of Families is all a cheat  Tis Personal Vertue only makes us Great  THE Mock Mourners A SATYR By way of ELEGY on King  WILLIAM  To the QUEEN  MADAM  YOUR Majesty has so often declar'd Your just Concern for the Nations Loss and Your Value for the Memory of the late King You have so publickly approv'd his Conduct so visibly mov'd in the same Steps and pursu'd the wise Measures of this  Your Glorious Ancestor  that it cannot be thought displeasing to Your Majesty to reprehend those who make a Mock at the Sorrow of Your Majesty and Three Nations  Your Majesty was the first who told us  he cou'd not be sufficiently Lamented  May those who are not of the same Mind find no Favour with Your Majesty nor ther Maker till they repent that Sin against his Merit and the Voice of their Native Country  Here are no Reflections upon Your Majesties  Houshold  or  Council  or  Courts of Justice  or  either House of Parliament  and consequently no Offence against Your Royal  Proclamation 'Twou'd be an Affront to Your Majesty to imagine there were any under all those Heads of Your Government cou'd deserve the Reproof of the following  Satyr  Your Majesty has an entire Possession of the Hearts of Your People but their Affection is still the deeper rooted by that generous Sorrow you have express'd for the Loss of Him to whom they owe the full Possession of their Liberty under Your Government  How they can be faithful Subjects to Your Majesty that were not true Friends to such a King is a Mystery out of bumane Understanding since the Happiness we enjoy by Your Government proceeds from his defending us against those  who wou'd not have had Your Majesty to Reign over us  'Twou'd be a Crime against Your Majesty which deserv'd no Pardon to suggest You shou'd be offended at that part of the  Satyr  which points at our Immoralities Your Majesties Example as well as Command has encourag'd us all to  declare War  against Vice and there we are sure of Your Royal Protection  For the rest if an extraordinary Concern for the Glorious Memory of the late King has led the Author into any Excesses he begs Your Majesty would place it to the Account of that  just Passion  every honest Man retains for his extraordinary Merit believing that no Man can have an Indifferency for the Memory of King William and at the same time have any Desire for the Welfare of his Native Country  While Your Majesty pursues the true Interest of  England  the Protestant Religion and the Welfare of  Europe  as He did You will have the same Enemies that he had the same to oppose You Abroad and reproach You at Home but You will thereby engage all Your Honest Subjects to adhere the firmer to their Duty all Your Protestant Neighbours to depend upon Your Protection and God shall Crown Your Majesty and these Nations with His Special Favour and Benediction  Amen  A SATYR  c  SUCH has been this IllNatur'd Nation's Fate  Always to see their Friends and Foes too late  By Native Pride and want of Temper led  Never to value Merit till 'tis Dead  And then Immortal Monuments they raise  And Damn their Former Follies by their Praise  With just Reproaches Rail at their own Vice  And Mourn for those they did before despise  So they who  Moses  Government defied  Sincerely sorrow'd for him when he Died  And so when  Britain  's Genius fainting lay  Summon'd by Death which Monarchs must Obey  Trembling and Soulless half the Nation stood  Upbraided by their own Ingratitude  They who with true born Honesty before  Grudg'd him the Trophies he so justly wore  Were with his Fate more than himself dismay'd  Not for their King but for themselves afraid  He had their Rights and Liberties restor'd  In Battel purchas'd and by Peace secur'd  And they with  English  Gratitude began  To feel the Favour and despise the Man  But when they saw that his Protection ceas'd  And Death had their Deliverer possest  How Thunderstruck they stood What cries they rais'd  They look'd like Men Distracted and Amaz'd  Their Terror did their Conscious Guilt explain  And wish'd their injur'd Prince Alive again  They Dream'd of Halters Gibbets and of Goals  French Armies Popery and Prince of  Wales  Descents Invasions Uproars in the State  Mobs Irish Massacrees and God knows what  Imaginary Enemies appear'd  And all they knew they Merited they Fear'd  'Tis strange that Pride and Envy should prevail  To make Men's Sense as well as Vertue fail  That where they must depend they should abuse  And slight the Man they were afraid to lose  But  William  had not Govern'd Fourteen Year  To be an unconcern'd Spectator here  His Works like Providence were all Compleat  And made a Harmony we Wonder'd at  The Legislative Power he set Free  And led them step by step to Liberty  'Twas not his Fault if they cou'd not Agree  Impartial Justice He Protected so  The Laws did in their Native Channels flow  From whence our sure Establishment begun  And  William  laid the first Foundation Stone  On which the stately Fabrick soon appear'd  How cou'd they sink when such a Pilot steer'd  He taught them due defences to prepare  And make their future Peace their present Care  By him directed Wisely they Decreed  What Lines shou'd be expell'd and what succeed  That now he's Dead there's nothing to be done  But to take up the Scepter he laid down  The Circle of this Order is so round  So Regular as nothing can confound  In Truth and Justice all the Lines commence  And Reason is the vast circumference  William  's the moving Centre of the whole  'T had else a Body been without a Soul  Fenc'd with just Laws impregnable it stands  And will for ever last in  Honest Hands  For Truth and Justice are the immortal Springs  Give Life to Constitutions and to Kings  In either case if one of them decay  These can no more Command than those Obey  Right is the only Fountain of Command  The Rock on which Authority must stand  And if Executive Power steps awry  On either hand it splits on Tyranny  Oppression is a Plague on Mankind sent  Infects the Vitals of a Government  Convulsions follow and such Vapours rise  The Constitution Suffocates and Dies  Law is the Grand Specific to Restore  And unobstructed never fails to Cure  All other Rules compared unto that  Are Tampering and Quacking with the State  The Conscitution's like a vast Machine  That's full of curious Workmanship within  Where tho' the parts unweildy may appear  It will be put in Motion with a Hair  The Wheels are Officers and Magistrates  By which the whole Contrivance operates  Laws are the Weights and Springs which make it move  Wound up by Kings as Managers above  Which if they're screw'd too high or down too low  The Movement goes too fast or else too slow  Then Legislators are the Engineers  Who when 'tis out of Order make Repairs  The People are the Owners  'twas for them  The first Inventor drew the Ancient Scheme  'Tis for their Benefit it works  and they  The Charges of maintaining it defray  And if their Governours unfaithful prove  They Engineers or Managers remove  Unkind Contention sometimes their appears  Between the Managers and Engineers  Such Strife is always to the Owners wrong  And once it made the Work stand still too long  Till  William  came and loos'd the Fatal Chain  And set the Engineers to Work again  And having made the wondrous thing compleat  To  Anne  's unerring Hand he left the Helm of State  Anne  like  Elisha  when just  William  went  Receiv'd the Mantle of this Government  And by Divine Concession does inherit  A Double Portion of his Ruling Spirit  The Dying Heroe loaded with Renown  Gave her the Nations Blessing with a Crown  From God the People and the Laws her own  Told her that he had Orders from on High  To lay aside the Government and Die  What he had Fought for gave her up in Peace  And chear'd her Royal Heart with Prospect of Success  While he who Death in all its Shapes had seen  With full Composure quiet and serene  Passive and undisorder'd at his Fate  Quitted the  English  Throne without Regret  No conscious Guilt disturb'd his Royal Breast  Calm as the Regions of Eternal Rest  Before his Life went out his Heaven came in  For all was bright without and clear within  The blest Rewards did to his Sight appear  The Passage easie and the Prospect near  His parting Eye the gladsome Regions spied  Just so before his Dear  Maria  Died  His High Concern for  England  he exprest  England  the Darling of his Royal Breast  The transports of his parting Soul he spent  Her disunited Parties to Lament  His Wishes then supply'd his want of Power  And Pray'd for them for whom he Fought before  Speak Envy if thou canst inform us what  Cou'd this unthankful Nation Murmur at  But Discontent was always our Disease  For  Englishmen  what Government can please  We always had our Sons of  Belial  here  Who knew no God nor Government to Fear  No Wonder these dislik'd his Gentle Sway  Unwilling Homage to his Scepter Pay  And only did for want of Power Obey  Some soft excuse for them we might contrive  Had he not been the Gentlest Prince Alive  Had he not born with an exalted Mind  All that was disobling and unkind  Peaceful and tender Thoughts his Mind possest  And High Superior Love conceal'd the rest  Our Discontents wou'd oft his Pity move  But all his Anger was supprest by Love  That Heavenborn Passion had subdu'd his Soul  Possest the greatest part and Rul'd the whole  This made him strive his People to possess  Which he had done had he oblig'd 'em less  He knew that Titles are but empty Things  And Hearts of Subjects are the strength of Kings  Justice and Kindness were his constant care  He scorn'd to Govern Mankind by their Fear  Their Universal Love he strove to Gain  'Twas hard that we should make him strive in vain  That he should here our English Humours find  And we that he had sav'd shou'd be unkind  By all endearing Stratagems he strove  To draw us by the Secret Springs of Love  And when he could not Cure our Discontent  It always was below him to Resent  Nature was never seen in such Excess  All Fury when Abroad at Home all Peace  In War all Fire and Blood in Peace enclin'd  To all that's Sweet and Gentle Soft and Kind  Ingratitude for this must needs Commence  In want of Honesty or want of Sense  When Kings to Luxury and Ease resign'd  Their Native Countries just Defence declin'd  This High pretending Nation us'd to plead  What they'd perform had they a King to lead  What Wondrous Actions had by them been done  When they had Martial Monarchs to lead on  And if their Prince would but with  France  make War  What Troops of  English  Heroes wou'd appear  William  the bottom of their Courage found  False like themselves meer emptiness and sound  For call'd by Fate to Fight for  Christendom  They sent their King Abroad and stay'd at Home  Wisely declin'd the hazards of the War  To Nourish Faction and Disorders here  Wrapt in Luxurious Plenty they Debauch  And load their Active Monarch with Reproach  They stay at Home and teach him to Command  And Judge those Actions which they dare not mend  Backward in Deeds but of their Censures free  And blame that Conduct they're afraid to see  Against the Hand that saves them they exclaim  And Curse the Strangers tho' they Fight for them  Tho' some who wou'd excuse the Matter say  They did not grudge their Service but their Pay  Where are the Royal Bands that now advance  To spread his dreadful Banners into  France  Britannia  's Noble Sons her Interest fly  And Foreign Heroes must their place supply  Much for the Fame of our Nobility  Posterity will be asham'd to hear  Great  Britain  's Monarch did in Arms appear  And scarce an English Nobleman was there  Our Ancestors had never Conquer'd  France  For Kingdoms seldom are subdu'd by Chance  H  d  Talbott Vere  and  Montacutte  with held  The Glory for the danger of the Field  Had  English  Honesty been kept alive  The Ancient  English  Glory would survive  But Gallantry and Courage will decline  Where Pride and all Confederate Vices join  Had we kept up the Fame of former Years  Landen  had been as Famous as  Poictiers  Ormond  and  Essex  had not Fought alone  The only  English  Lords our Verse can own  The only Peers of whom the World can say  That they for Honour Fought and not for Pay  A Regimented  Few  we had indeed  Who serv'd for neither Pride nor Fame but Bread  Some Bully Ls  Protection Ps  and some  Went out because they durst not stay at Home  Loaded with Noxious Vices they appear  A Scandal to the Nation and the War  Heroes in Midnight Scuffles with the Watch  And Lewd enough an Army to Debauch  Flesh't with cold Murthers and from Justice fled  Pursu'd by Blood in Drink and Darkness shed  In vain they strive with Bravery to appear  For where there's Guilt there always will be Fear  These are the Pillars of the  English  Fame  Such Peers as History must blush to Name  When future Records to the World relate  Marsaglia  's Field and Gallant  Schomberg  's Fate  W  was Captive made  it was severe  Fate took the  Honest Man  and left the  Peer  The World owes Fame for Ages long before  To the Great Stile of  W  which he bore  But when we come the Branches to compare  'Tis a  Hero  Ancestor a  Bully  Heir  The Vertues the Posterity forsake  And all their Gallant Blood is dwindl'd to a  Rake  More might be said but  Satyr  stay thy Rhimes  And mix not his Misfortunes with his Crimes  We need not Rake the Ashes of the Dead  Ther's Living Characters enough to Read  How cou'd this Nation ever think of Peace  Or how look up to Heaven for Success  While lawless Vice in Fleets and Camps appear'd  And Oaths were louder than their Cannon heard  No wonder  English Israel  has been said  Before the  French Philistines  Fleet t' ha' fled  While  T Embrac'd with Whores  appear'd  And Vice it self the Royal Navy Steer'd  William  oppos'd their Crimes with steady Hand  By his Example First and then Command  Prompted the Laws their Vices to suppress  For which no doubt the Guilty Lov'd him less  Ye Sons of Envy Railers at the Times  Be bold like  Englishmen  and own your Crimes  For shame put on no Black but let us see  Your Habits always and your Tongues agree  Envy ne'er Blushes Let it not be said  You Hate him Living and you Mourn him Dead  No Sorrow show where you no Love protess  There are no Hypocrites in Wickedness  Great Bonfires make and tell the World y'are glad  Y' have lost the greatest Blessing e'er you had  So MadMen sing in Nakedness and Chains  For when the Sense is gone the Song remains  So Thankless  Israel  when they were set free  Reproach'd the Author of their Liberty  And wish'd themselves in  Egypt  back again  What pity 'twas they wish'd or wish'd in vain  Stop Satyr let  Britannia  now relate  Her  William  's Character and her own Fate  Let her to him a grateful Trophy raise  She best can sigh his Loss that sung his Praise  BRITANIA  Of all my Sons by Tyranny bereft  A Widow desolate and Childless left  By Violence and Injury opprest  To Heaven I cast my Eyes and sigh'd the rest  I need but Sigh for I was always Heard  And  William  on my welcome Shores appear'd  With Wings of speed to Rescue me he came  And all my Sorrows vanish'd into Flame  New Joys sprung up new Triumphs now abound  And all my Virgin Daughters hear the sound  Eternal Dances move upon my Plains  And youthful Blood springs in my ancient Veins  With open Arms I yielded my Embrace  And  William  saw the Beauties of my Face  He had before the Knowledge of my Charms  For he had my  Maria  in his Arms  While he remain'd I gave eternal Spring  Made him my Son my Darling and my King  While all the wondring World my choice approve  Congratulate his Fate and justifie my Love  Of  British  Blood in  Belgian  Plains he liv'd  My only Foreign Offspring that surviv'd  Batavian  Climates nourish'd him a while  Too great a Genius for so damp a Soil  And freely then surrendered him to me  For wise Men freely will the fates Obey  Yet in my  William  they had equal Share  And he defended them with equal care  They were the early Trophies of his Sword  His Infant Hand their Liberty restor'd  His Nurse the  Belgick  Lyon roar'd for Aid  And planted early Lawrels on his Head  His easie Victories amaz'd Mankind  We wonder'd what the dreadful Youth design'd  Fearless he Fought his Country to set Free  And with his Sword Cut out their Liberty  The Journals of his Actions always seem'd  So wonderful as if the World had dream'd  So swift so full of Terror he went on  He was a Conqueror before a Man  The  Bourbon  Sword tho' it was brighter far  Yet drawn for Conquest and oppressive War  Had all the Triumphs of the World Engrost  But quickly all those Triumphs to Him lost  Justice to  William  early Trophies brought  William  for Truth and Justice always fought  He was the very Mystery of War  He gain'd by't when he was not Conqueror  And if his Enemies a Battel won  He might be beaten they wou'd be undone  Antaeus  like from every fall he rose  Strengthen'd with double Vigor to oppose  Those Actions Mankind judg'd Unfortunate  Serv'd but as secret Steps to make him Great  Then let them Boast their Glory at  Landen  In vain th' Embattell'd Squadrons crowded in  Their's was the Victory the Conquest mine  Of all the  Heroes  Ages past adore  Back to the first Great Man and long before  Tho' Virtue has sometimes with Valour join'd  The Barren World no Parallel can find  If back to  Israel  's Tents I shou'd retire  And of the  Hebrew  Heroes there enquire  I find no Hand did  Judah  's Scepter wear  Come up to  Williams  Modern Character  Namure  's Gygantick Powers he o'erthrew  David  did less when he  Goliah  slew  Here's no  Ʋriah  's for Adult'ry slain  No Oaths forgot to faithful  Jonathan  And if to  Jesse  's Grandson we ha' recourse  William  his Wisdom had  without his Whores  Joshua  might still ha' staid on  Jordan  's Shore  Must he as  William  did the  Boyne  pass o'er  Almighty Power was forc'd to interpose  And frighted both the Water and his Foes  But had my  William  been to pass that Stream  God needed not to part the Waves for him  Not Forty Thousand  Canaanites  cou'd stand  In spight of Waves or  Canaanites  he'd Land  Such Streams ne'er stemm'd his Tide of Victory  No not the Stream no nor the Enemy  His Bombs and Cannon wou'd ha' made the Wall  Without the Help of  Jewish  RamsHorns fall  When his dear  Israel  from their Foes had fled  Because of stoll'n Spoils by  Achan  hid  He ne'er like  Joshua  on the Ground ha' laid  He'd certainly ha' fought as well as pray'd  The Sun would rather ha' been thought to stay  Amaz'd to see how soon he had won the Day  Than to give time the  Canaanites  to slay  The greatest Captains of the Ages past  Debauch'd their Fame with Cruelty at last  William  did only Tyrants subdue  These conquer'd Kings and then the People too  The Subjects reap'd no Profit for their Pains  And only chang'd their Masters not their Chains  Their Victories did for themselves appear  And made their Peace as dreadful as the War  But  William  fought Oppression to destroy  That Mankind might in Peace the World enjoy  The  Pompeys Caesars Scipio  's  Alexanders  Who croud the World with Fame were great Commanders  These too brought Blood and Ruin with their Arms  But  William  always fought on other Terms  Terror indeed might in his Front appear  But Peace and Plenty follow'd in the Rear  And if Oppression forc'd him to contend  Calmness was all his Temper Peace his End  He was the only Man which Heaven saw fit  To regulate the World or Conquer it  Who can his Skill in Government Gainsay  He that cou'd  England  's brittle Scepter Sway  Where Parties too much Rule and Kings Obey  He always Reign'd by Gentleness and Love  An Emblem of the Government above  Vote me not Childless then in Christendom  I yet have Sons in my suspended Womb  And 'till just Fate such due Provision makes  A Daughter my Protection undertakes  Crowns know no Sexes and my Government  To either Kind admits a just Descent  Queens have to me been always Fortunate  E'er since my  English Phaenix  rul'd the State  Who made my People Rich my Country Great  Satyr be just and when we lash their Crimes  Mingle some Tears for  William  with our Rhimes  Tho' Baseness and Ingratitude appear  Thank Heav'n that we ha' Weeping Millons here  Then speak our hearty Sorrows if you can  Superior Grief in feeling Words explain  Accents that wound and all the Senses numb  And while they speak may strike the Hearer dumb  Such Grief as never was for King before  And such as never never shall be more  See how Authority comes weeping on  And view the Queen lamenting on his Throne  With just Regret she takes the Sword of State  Not by her Choice directed but his Fate  Accepts the sad Necessity with Tears  And mournfully for Government prepares  The Peoples Acclamation she receives  With sadden'd Joy and a Content that grieves  View next the sad Assemblies that appear  To tell their Grief for Him and Joy for Her  The first confounds the last with such Excess  They hardly can their Noble thoughts express  The illustrious Troops address here to condole  And speak such Grief as Wounds her to the Soul  They lodge their Sorrows in the Royal Breast  The Harbour where the Nation looks for Rest  Next these the Representatives arise  With all the Nation's Sorrow in their Eyes  The Epithets they righteously apply  To the Restorer of their Liberty  Are  Tokens  of their Sense and Honesty  For as a Body we were always true  But 'tis our Parties that our Peace undo  Who can like them the Peoples Grief express  They shew her all the Tokens of Excess  O'erwhelm'd with Sorrow and supprest with Care  They place the Nation's Refuge now in her  Nothing but her Succession cou'd abate  The Nation's Sorrow for their Monarch's Fate  And nothing but his Fate cou'd their true Joy  For her Succession lessen or destroy  The Civil Sword to her as Heaven saw fit  With general Satisfaction they commit  How can it in a Hand like hers miscarry  But who shall for us weild the Military  Who shall the jarring Generals Unite  First teach them to agree and then to Fight  Who shall Renew'd Alliances contrive  And keep the vast Confederacies alive  Who shall the growing Gallick Force subdue  'Twas more than all the World but him cou'd do  Sighs for departed Friends are sensless things  But 'tis not so when Nations Mourn for Kings  When wounded Kingdoms such a Loss complain  As Nature never can repair again  The Tyrant Grief like Love obeys no Laws  But blindly views the Effect and not the Cause  Dark are the Works of Soveraign Providence  And often clash with our contracted Sense  But if we might with Heavens Decrees debate  And of our Makers Works expostulate  Why shou'd he form a Mind supreamly Great  And to his Charge commit the Reins of Fate  And at one hasty Blow the World defeat  A Blow so sudden so severe and swift  We had no time for Supplication left  As if Almighty Power had been afraid  Such Prayers wou'd by such Multitudes be made  Such  Moses  's would to his Altars go  To whom he never did or wou'd say no  He hardly cou'd know how to strike the Blow  For Prayer so much the Sov'reign Power commands  Ev'n God himself sometimes as Conquer'd stands  And calls for Quarter at the Wrestlers Hands  How Strenuous then had been the Sacred Strife  While all the kneeling World had begg'd his Life  With all that Earnestness of Zeal and more  Than ever Nation begg'd for King before  See how the neighbouring Lands his Fame improve  And by their Sorrows testifie their Love  Sprinkle his Memory with grateful Tears  And hand his Glory to succeeding Years  With what Contempt will  English  Men appear  When future Ages read his Character  They'll never bear to hear in time to come  How he was lov'd Abroad and scorn'd at Home  The World will scarce believe it cou'd be true  And Vengeance must such Insolence pursue  Our Nation will by all Men be abhor'd  And  William  's juster Fame be so restor'd  Posterity when Histories relate  His Glorious Deeds will ask  What Giant's that  For common Vertues may Mens Fame advance  But an immoderate Glory turns Romance  Its real Merit does it self undo  Men talk is up so high it can't be true  So  William  's Life encreas'd by doubling Fame  Will drown his Actions to preserve his Name  The Annals of his Conduct they'll revise  As Legends of Impossibilities  'Twill all a Life of Miracles appear  Too great for him to do and them to hear  And if some faithful Writer shou'd set down  With what Uneasiness he wore the Crown  What thankless Devil had the Land possest  This will be more prodigious than the rest  With Indignation 'twill their Minds inspire  And raise the Glory of his Actions higher  They'll be asham'd their Ancestors to own  And strive their Father's Follies to atone  New Monuments of Gratitude they'll raise  And Crown his Memory with  Thanks  and  Praise  Thou Satyr shalt the grateful Few rehearse  And solve the Nation's Credit in thy Verse  Embalm his Name with Characters of Praise  His Fame's beyond the Power of time to rase  From him let future Monarchs learn to Rule  And make his lasting Character their School  For he who wou'd in time to come be Great  Has nothing now to do but imitate  Let dying Parents when they come to bless  Wish to their Children only his Success  Here their Instructions very well may end  William  's Examqle only recommend  And leave the Youth his History t'attend  But we have here an Ignominious Crowd  That Boast their Native Birth and  English  Blood  Whose Breasts with Envy and Contention burn  And now Rejoice when all the Nations Mourn  Their awkward  Triumphs  openly they Sing  Insult the Ashes of their Injur'd King  Rejoice at the Disasters of his  Crown  And Drink the Horse's Health that threw him down  Blush Satyr when such  Crimes  we must reveal  And draw a silent  Curtain  to conceal  Actions so vile shall ne'er debauch our Song  Let Heaven alone  tho' Justice suffers long  Her Leaden Wings and Iron Hands may show  That she is certain tho' she may be slow  His Foreign Birth was made the Fam'd Pretence  Which gave our HomeBorn  Englishmen  Offence  But Discontent's the ancient  English  Fashion  The Universal Blemish of the Nation  And 'tis a Question whether God cou'd make  That King whom every  Englishman  wou'd  like  Nor is it any Paradox to say  William  had more of  English  Blood than they  The  Royal Life  flow'd in his sprightly Veins  The same that in the  Noble Stock  remains  The same which now his Glorious Scepter wields  To whom three Nations just Obedience yields  ANNE  the remaining Glory of our Isle  Well she becomes the Royal  English  stile  In  William  's steps sedately she proceeds  William  's a Pattern to Immortal Deeds  Preserves his Memory with generous care  Forgetting him is disobliging her  Where shall the murmuring Party then appear  Where wou'd the Nation but for her ha' found  So safe a  Cure  for such a sudden  Wound  And cou'd she but as well the  Camp  supply  The World the sooner would their Grief lay by  But there the Fatal Breach is made so wide  That Loss can never never besupply'd  Ye Men of  Arms  and  English  Sons of  War  Now Learn from him how you may Fight for her  Your Grief for him express upon her Foes  For  William  lov'd such Funeral Tears as those  'Tis  William  's Glorious Scepter which she bears  Like  William  she for Liberty appears  She Mounts to  Honour  by the steps of  Truth  And his Example imitates in Both  'Tis you must make her blooming Fame increase  'Tis you must bring her Honour Wealth and Peace  And let it once more to the World be seen  Nothing can make us greater than a Queen  REFORMATION OF MANNERS  The PREFACE  NO Man is qualified to reprove other Mens Faults but he that has none of his own  say some People who are loth to be told of their Errours  and 'tis on this Account only that the World has the Trouble of a  Preface  If that be true the Author freely acknowledges he is the most unqualified Man in the World to reprove  That no Man is qualified to reprove other Mens Crimes who allows himself in the Practice of the same is very readily granted and is the very Substance and Foundation of the following  Satyr  And on that score the Author has as good a Title to Animadversion as another since no Man can charge him with the Vices he has reproved  But instead of Selfdefence he is rather willing to look back on the best Actions of his Life with the Temper of a Penitent and he wishes all Men wou'd do the like 'tis the only way to make the  Satyr  Impertinent  For Penitence would all his Verse disarm  The  Satyr  's answer'd if the Men reform  But the Fact is not true neither 'Tis a very pretty way for Men to get rid of the Impertinence of Admonition If  none but faultless Men must reprove others the Lord ha' Mercy upon all our Magistrates and all our Clergy are undignified and suspended at a Blow  Nor does the  Satyr  assault private Infirmity or pursue Personal Vices but is bent at those who pretending to suppress Vice or being vested with Authority for that purpose yet make themselves the Shame of their Country encouraging Wickedness by that very Authority they have to suppress it  He professes himself sorry either that Freedom of Speech is so dangerous in this Age or that he is too much a Coward otherwise some had heard of their Crimes who think themselves above the Power of Punishment  'Tis hard that Vice should have so much shelter from Civil Power that Reproof shou'd lead the Party to suppress the Poet rather than the Crime  And yet his Friends give him over for lost An Account of what he has ventur'd to say to whose Importunity he thinks himself oblig'd to answer with  Juvenal  Difficile est Satyram non scribere Nam quis Iniquae  Tam Patiens Urbis tam ferreus ut teneat se  If any Man is injur'd by the Characters he is content they should carry their Resentment to what Extremity they please but if Truth may be on his side the only way to make him do them Justice is to reform And he promises to give Testimony to their Repentance  as an Amand Honourable  in a manner as publick as possible  A SATYR  c  HOW long may Heav'n be banter'd by a Nation  With broken Vows Shams of Reformation  And yet forbear to show its Indignation  Tell me ye Sages who the Conscience guide  And Ecclesiastick Oracles divide  Where do the Bounds of Sovereign Patience end  How long may People undestroy'd offend  What Limits has Almighty Power prepar'd  When Mercy shall be deaf and Justice heard  If there's a Being Immortal and Immense  Who does Rewards and Punishments dispence  Why is he Passive when his Power's defy'd  And his Eternal Government's deny'd  Tell us why he that sits above the Sky  Unreins no Vengeance lets no Thunders fly  When Villains prosper and successful Vice  Shall humane Power controul and Heavenly Power despise  If 'tis because the Sins of such a Nation  Are yet too small to conquer his Compassion  Then tell us to what height Mankind may sin  Before Celestial Fury must begin  How their extended Crimes may reach so high  Vengeance must follow and of course destroy  And by the common Chain of Providence  Destruction come like Cause and Consequence  Then search the dark  Arcana  of the Skies  An  if ye can  unfold these Mysteries  His clashing Providences reconcile  The partial Frown and the unequal Smile  Tell us why some have been destroy'd betimes  While  Albion  's glittering Shores grow black with Crimes  Why some for early Errors are undone  Some  longer still and longer  still sin on  England  with all her blackening Guilt is spar'd  And  Sodom  's lesser Crimes receiv'd a swift Reward  And yet all this be reconcil'd to both  Impartial Justice and unnerring Truth  Why  Ostia  stands and no revenging hand  Has yet dismist her from the burthen'd Land  No Plague no sulphurous Shower her  exit  makes  And turns her Silver  Thames  to  Stygian  Lakes  Whose so uninhabitable Banks might flow  With Streams as black as her that made 'em so  And as a Monument to future times  Should send forth Vapours nauseous as her Crimes  Tell us why  Carthage  fell a Prey to  Rome  And mourn the Fate of bright  Byzantium  Why ancient  Troy  's embrac'd by Destiny  And  Rome  Immortal  Rome  to Fate gives way  Yet  Ostia  stands more impious far than they  Where are the Golden Gates of  Palestine  Where High Superiour Glory us'd to shine  The mighty City Millions dwelt within  Where Heaven's Epitome was to be seen  God's Habitation Sacred to his Name  Magnificent beyond the Voice of Fame  Those lofty Pinnacles which once were seen  Bright like the Majesty which dwelt within  In which Seraphick Glory cou'd reside  Too great for humane Vision to abide  Whose glittering Fabrick  God  the Architect  The Sun's less Glorious Light did once reject  These all ha' felt the Iron hands of Fate  And Heaven's dear Darling City's desolate  No more the sacred Place commands our Awe  But all become a Curse a  Golgotha  The Reverend Pile can scarce its Ruins show  Forsook by him whose Glory made it so  Yet  Ostia  stands her impious Towers defie  The threatning Comets of the blazing Sky  Foreboding Signs of Ruine she despises  And all her teaching Saviours Sacrifices  The  Jews  are Fools  Jerusalem  's outdone  We crucifie the Father they the Son  Within her Reprobate Gates they are allow'd  Worse  Jews  than those which crucified the God  They kill'd a Man for they suppos'd him so  These boldly sacrifice the God they know  His Incarnation Miracles deny  And vilely Banter his Divinity  Their old Impostor  Socinus  prefer  And the long Voyage of Heaven without a Pilot steer  Yet  Ostia  boasts of her Regeneration  And tells us wond'rous Tales of Reformation  How against Vice she has been so severe  That none  but Men of Quality  may swear  How Publick Lewdness is expell'd the Nation  That  Private Whoring  may be more in fashion  How Parish Magistrates like pious Elves  Let none be Drunk a Sundays  but themselves  And Hatkney Coachmen durst not ply the Street  In Sermontime  till they had pay'd the State  These  Ostia  are the Shams of Reformation  With which thou mock'st thy Maker and the Nation  While in thy Streets unpunish'd there remain  Crimes which have yet insulted Heaven in vain  Crimes which our Satyr blushes to review  And Sins thy Sister  Sodom  never knew  Superiour Lewdness Crowns thy Magistrates  And Vice grown grey usurps the Reverend Seats  Eternal Blasphemies and Oaths abound  And Bribes among thy Senators are found  Old Venerable  Jeph  with trembling Air  Ancient in Sin and Father of the Chair  Forsook by Vices he had lov'd so long  Can now be vicious only with his Tongue  Yet talks of ancient Lewdness with delight  And loves to be the Justice of the Night  On Bawdy Tales with Pleasure he reflects  And lewdly Smiles at Vices he corrects  The feeble tottering Magistrate appears  Willing to Wickedness in spite of Years  Struggles his Age and Weakness to resist  And fain wou'd sin but Nature won't assist  Ll  the  Pandor  of thy JudgmentSeat  Has neither Manners Honesty nor Wit  Instead of which he's plentiously supply'd  With Nonsense Noise Impertinence and Prid  Polite his Language and his flowing stile  Scorns to suppose good Manners worth his while  With Principles from Education stor'd  Th' Drudgery of Decency abhor'd  The  CityMouth  with Eloqvence endu'd  To Mountebank the list'ning Multitude  Sometimes he tunes his Tongue to soft Harangues  To banter Common Halls and flatter Kings  And all with but an odd indifferent Grace  With Jingle on his Tongue and Coxcomb in his Face  Definitive in Law without Appeal  But always serves the  Hand  who pays him well  He Trades in Justice and the Souls of Men  And prostitutes them equally to Gain  He has his Publick Book of Rates to show  Where every Rogue the Price of Life may know  And this one Maxim always goes before  He never hangs the Rich nor saves the Poor  Godlike he nods upon the Bench of State  His Smiles are Life and if he Frown 'tis Fate  Boldly invading Heavens Prerogative  For with his Breath he kills or saves alive  Fraternities of Villains he maintains  Protects their Robberies and shares the Gains  Who thieve with  Toleration  as a  Trade  And then restore according as they're paid  With awkward scornful Phiz and vile Grimace  The genuine  Talents  of an ugly Face  With haughty Tone insults the Wretch that dies  And sports with his approaching Miseries  Fe  for so sometimes unrighteous Fate  Erects a Madman for a Magistrate  Equipt with Lewdness Oaths and Impudence  Supplies with Vices his defect of Sence  Abandon'd to ill Manners he retains  His want of Grace as well as want of Brains  Before the Boy wore off the Rake began  The Bully then commenc'd and then the Man  Yet Nature seems in this to do him wrong  To give no Courage with a saucy  Tongue  From whence this constant Disadvantage flows  He always gives the  Words  and takes the  Blows  Tho ofren Can'd he's instructed by't  But still he shews the Scoundrel with the Knight  Still scurilous and still afraid to sight  His Dialect's a  Modern Billingsgate  Which suits  the Hosier  not the Magistrate  The same he from behind the Counter brought  And yet he practic'd worse than he was taught  Early Debauch'd in  Satans Steps  he mov'd  And all Mechanick Vices he improv'd  At first he did his Sovereign's Rights invade  And rais'd his Fortune by clandestine Trade  Stealing the Customs did his Profits bring  And 'twas his calling to defraud his King  This is the Man that helps to Rule the State  The City's Newreforming Magistrate  To Execute the Justice of the Law  And keep less Villains than himself in Awe  Take Money of the Rich and Hang the Poor  And lash the Strumpet he Debauch'd before  So for small Crimes poor  Thieves  Destruction find  And leave the Rogues of Quality behind  Search all the Christian Climes from Pole to Pole  And match for Sheriffs  Sple  and  Cle  Equal in Character and Dignity  This fam'd for Justice that for Modesty  By Merit chosen for the  Chair of State  This fit for  Bridewel  that for  Billingsgates  That richly clad to grace the Gaudy Day  For which his Fathers Creditors must pay  This from the fluxing Bagnio just dismist  Rides out to make himself the City Jest  From some  lascivious Dishclout  to the  Chair  To punish Lewdness and Disorders there  The Brute he Rides on would his Crimes detest  For that's the Animal and this the Beast  And yet some Reformation he began  For Magistrates ne'er bear the Sword in vain  Expensiue Sinning always he declin'd  To frugal Whoring  totally resign'd  His  Avarice  his  Appetites  opprest  Base like the Man and Bruitish like the Lust  Concise in  Sinning Natures Call  supply'd  And in one Act two Vices gratified  Never was Oyster Beggar Cinder  Whore  So much caress'd by Magistrates before  They that are nice and squeamish in their Lust  'Ts a sign the Vice is low and wants a Gust  But he that's perfect in the Extream of Vice  Scorns to excite his Appetite by Price  'Twas in his Reign we to Reform began  And set the Devil up to mend the Man  More might be said but  Satyr  stay thy Rhimes  And mix not his Misfortunes with his Crimes  Cn  superbly wise and grave of Life  Cou'd every one reform except his Wife  Passive in Vice he Pimps to his own Fate  To shew himself a Loyal Magistrate  'Tis doubtful who debauch'd the City more  The maker of the Masque or of the Whore  Nor his Religion less a Masquerade  He always drove a strange Mysterious Trade  With doubtful Zeal to Church he'll gravely come  To Praise that God which he denies at home  Socinian Td  's his Dear Ghostly Priest  And taught him all Religion to digest  Took prudent care he should not much profess  And he was ne'er addicted to Excess  And yet he  Covets  without Rule or End  Will sell his Wife his Master or his Friend  To houndless  Avarice  a constant Slave  Unsatisfy'd as Death and greedy as the Grave  Now  Satyr  let us view the the numerous Fry  That must succeeding Magistrates supply  And search if future Years are like to be  Much better taught or better rul'd than we  The Senators of Hospital Descent  The upper House of  Ostia  's Parliament  Who from Destruction should their City save  But are as wicked as they shou'd be grave  With Citizens  in Petto  who at need  As these do those so those must these succeed  Db  the Modern  Judas  of the Age  Has often try'd in vain to mount the Stage  Profuse in Gifts and Bribes to God and Man  To ride the CityHorse and wear the Chain  His Vices  Ostia  thou hast made thy own  In chusing him thou writ'st thy own Lampoon  Fancy the haughty Wretch in Chair of State  At once the City's Shame and Magistrate  At Table set at his right Hand a Whore  Ugly as those which he had kept before  He  to do Justice and reform our Lives  And  She  receive the Homage of our Wives  Now Satyr give another Wretch his Due  Who's chosen to reform the City too  Hate him ye Friends to Honesty and Sense  Hate him in injur'd Beauty's just Defence  A Knighted Booby Insolent and Base  "  Whom Man no Manners gave nor God no Grace  The Scorn of Women and the Shame of Men  Matcht at Threescore to innocent Fifteen  Hagrid with jealous Whimsies lets us know  He thinks he's Cuckold  'cause he should be so  His vertuous Wife exposes to the Town  And fears her Crimes because he knows his own  Here Satyr let them just Reproach abide  Who sell their Daughters to oblige their Pride  The Chern begins the doleful Jest  As a  Memento Mori  to the rest  Who fond to raise his Generation by't  And see his Daughter buckl'd to a Knight  The Innocent unwarily betray'd  And to the Rascal join'd the hapless Maid  The Purchase is too much below the Cost  For while the Lady's gain'd the Woman's lost  What shall we say to common Vices now  When Magistrates the worst of Crimes allow  Ostia  if e'er thou wilt reform thy Gates  't must be another Set of Magistrates  In Practice just and in Profession sound  But God knows where the Men are to be found  In all thy numerous Streets 'tis hard to tell  Where the few Men of Faith and Honour dwell  Poor and despis'd so seldom they appear  The  Cynick  's Lanthorn wou'd be useful here  No City in the spacious Universe  Boasts of Religion more or minds it less  Of Reformation talks and Government  Backt with an Hundred Acts of Parliament  Those useless ScareCrows of neglected Laws  That miss the Effect because they miss the Cause  Thy Magistrates who should reform the Town  Punish the poor Mens Faults but hide their own  Suppress the Players Booths in  SmithfieldFair  But leave the  Cloysters  for their Wives are there  Where all the Scenes of Lewdness do appear  Satyr the Arts and Mysteries forbear  Too black for thee to write or us to hear  No Man but he that is as vile as they  Can all the Tricks and Cheats of Trade survey  Some in Clandestine Companies combine  Erect new Stocks to trade beyond the Line  With Air and empty Names beguile the Town  And raise new Credits first then cry 'em down  Divide the  empty nothing  into Shares  To set the Town together by the Ears  The Sham Projectors and the Brokers join  And both they Cully Merchant undermine  First he must be drawn in and then betray'd  And they demolish the Machine they made  So conjuring Chymists who with a Charm and Spell  Some wondrous Liquid wondrously exhale  But when the gaping Mob their Money pay  The Charm's dissolv'd the Vapour flies away  The wondring Bubbles stand amaz'd to see  Their Money Mountebank'd to  Mercury  Some fit out Ships and double Fraights ensure  And burn the Ships to make the Voyage secure  Promiscuous Plunders thro' the World commit  And  with the Money  buy their safe Retreat  Others seek out to  Africk  's Torrid Zone  And search the burning Shores of  Serralone  There in unsufferable Heats  they fry  And run vast Risques to see the Gold  and die  The harmless Natives basely they trepan  And barter Baubles for the  Souls of Men  The Wretches they to Christian Climes bring o'er  To serve worse Heathens than they did before  The Cruelties they suffer there are such  Amboyna  's nothing they've outdone the  Dutch  Cortez Pizarro Guzman Penaloe  Who drank the Blood and Gold of  Mexico  Who thirteen Millions of Souls destroy'd  And left one third of God's Creation void  By Birth for Natures Butchery design'd  Compar'd to these are merciful and kind  Death cou'd  their  cruellest Designs fulfil  Blood quench'd  their  Thirst and it suffic'd to kill  But these the tender  Coup de Grace  deny  And make Men beg in vain for leave to die  To more than  Spanish  Cruelty inclind  Torment the Body and debauch'd the Mind  The lingring Life of Slavery preserve  And vilely teach them both to sin and serve  In vain they talk to them of Shades below  They fear no Hell  but where such Christians go  Of  Jesus Christ  they very often hear  Often as his Blaspheming Servants swear  They hear and wonder what strange Gods they be  Can bear with Patience such Indignity  They look for Famines Plagues Disease and Death  Blasts from above and Earthquakes from beneath  But when they see regardless Heaven looks on  They curse our Gods or think that we have none  Thus Thousands to Religion are brought o'er  And made worse Devils than they were before  Satyr the Men of  Drugs  and  Simples  spare  'Tis hard to search the latent Vices there  Their  Theologicks  too they may defend  They can't deceive who never do pretend  As to Religion generally they show  As much as their Profession will allow  But count them all Confederates of Hell  'Till  B  they with one consent expel  B  our Satyr startles at his Name  The Colledge Scandal and the City's Shame  Not satisfy'd his Maker to deny  Provokes him with Lampoon and Blasphemy  And with unpresidented Insolence  Banters a God and scoffs at Providence  No Nation in the World but ours wou'd bear  To hear a Wretch blaspheme the Gods they fear  His Flesh long since their Altars had adorn'd  And with his Blood appeas'd the Powers he scorn'd  But see the Badge of our Reforming Town  Some cry Religion up some cry it down  Some worship God and some a God defie  With equal boldness equal liberty  The silent Laws decline the just Debate  Made dumb by the  more silent Magistrate  And both together small distinction put  'Twixt him that owns a God and him that owns him not  The Modern Crime 'tis thought no Being had  They knew no Atheist when our Laws were made  'Tis hard  the Laws more Freedom shou'd allow  With God above than Magistrates below  B  unpunish'd may Heaven and Earth defie  Dethrone Almighty Power Almighty Truth deny  Burlesque the Sacred High  Ʋnutter'd Name  And impious War with  Jove  himself Proclaim  While Justice unconcern'd looks calmly on  And  B  boasts the Conquests he has won  Insults the Christian Name and laughs to see  Religion Bully'd by Philosophy  B  with far less hazard may blaspheme  Than thou may'st  Satyr  trace thy Noble Theme  The Search of Vice more Hazard represents  From Laws from Councils and from P  Thou may'st be wicked and less danger know  Than by informing others they are so  Thou can'st  Pr no Counsellor expose  Or dress a vicious Mr in his proper Cloaths  But all the Bombs and Canon of the Law  Are soon drawn out to keep thy Pen in awe  By Laws  Post Facto  thou may'st soon be slain  And  Innuendo's  shall thy Guilt explain  Thou may'st Lampoon and no Man will resent  Lampoon but Heaven and not the P  Our Trusties and our Welbelov'ds forbear  Thou'rt free to banter Heaven and all that's there  The boldest Flights thou'rt welcome to bestow  O'th' Gods above but not the Gods below  B  may banter Heaven and  Al  Death  And  Td  poyson Souls with his infected Breath  No Civil Government resents the Wrong  But all are touch'd and angry at thy Song  Thy Friends without the help of Prophesie  Read Goals and Gibbets in thy Destiny  But  Courage springs from Truth  let it appear  Nothing but Guilt can be the Cause of Fear  Satyr go on thy keenest Shafts let fly  Truth can be no Offence to Honesty  The Guilty only are concern'd and  they  Lampoon themselves when e'er they censure thee  PART II  THE City's view'd now Satyr turn thine Eye  The Country's Vices and the Court's survey  And from Impartial Scrutiny set down  How much they're Both more vicious than the Town  How does our ten Years War with Vice advance  About as much as it hath done with  France  Ride with the Judge and view the wrangling Bar  And see how lewd our  JusticeMerchants  are  How  Clito  comes from instigating Whore  Pleads for the Man he Cuckol'd just hefore  See how he Cants and acts the Ghostly Father  And brings the Gospel and the Law together  To make his Pious Frauds be well receiv'd  He quotes the Scripture which he ne'er believ'd  Fluent in Language indigent in Sense  Supplies his want of Law with Impudence  See how he rides the Circuit with the Judge  To Law and Lewdness a devoted Drudge  A Brace of FemalClients meet him there  To help debauch the  Sizes  and the  Fair  By Day he plies the Bar with all his Might  And Revels in St  Ed  's Streets at Night  The Scandal of the Law his own Lampoon  Is Lawyer Merchant Bully and Bu  oon  In Drunken Quarrels eager to engage  Till Brother Justice lodg'd him in the Cage  A thing the Learned thought could never be  Had not the Justice been as drunk as he  He pleads of late at  Hymen  's Nuptial Bar  And bright  Aurelia  is Defendant there  He Courts the Nymph to wed and make a wife  And Swears  by God  he reform will his Life  The solemn Part he might ha' well forbore  For she alas has been  has been a Whore  The Pious Dame the sober Saint puts on  And  Clito  's in the way to be undone  Casco  's debauch'd 'tis his Paternal Vice  For wickedness descends to Families  The tainted Blood the Seeds of Vice convey  And plants new Crimes before the old decay  Thro' all Degrees of Vice the Father run  But sees himself outsin'd by either Son  Whoring  and  Incest  he has understood  And they subjoyn Adultery and Blood  This does the Orphan's Cause devoutly plead  Secures her Money and her Maidenhead  And then perswades her to defend the Crime  Evade the Guilt and Banter off the Shame  Taught by the subtile Counsellor she shows  More nice Distictions than  Ignatius  knows  In Matrimony finds a learned flaw  A Wife in Honour and a Wife in Law  "  Choice is the Substance of the Contract made  "  And mutual Love the only Knot that's ty'd  "  To these the Laws of Nations must submit  "  And where they fail the Contract's incompleat  "  So that if Love and Choice were not before  "  The last may be the Wife the first the Whore  Thus she securely sins with eager Gust  And satisfies her Conscience and her Lust  Nor does her Zeal and Piety omit  But to the Whore she joins the Jesuit  With constant Zeal frequents the House of Prayer  To heal her prostituted Conscience there  Without Remorse adjourns with full Content  From his lascivious Arms to th' Sacrament  The Brother less afraid of Sin than Shame  Doubles his Guilt to save his tottering Fame  'Twas too much Risque for any Man to run  To save that Credit which before was gone  The Innocent lies unreveng'd in Death  He stop'd the growing Scandal in her Breath  Till rime shall lay the horrid Murder bear  No Bribes can crush the Writs of Error there  Nor is the Bench less tainted than the Bar  How hard's that Plague to cure that's spread so far  'Twill all prescrib'd Authorities reject  While they're most guilty who shou'd first correct  Contagious Vice infects the JudgmentSeats  And Vertue from Authority retreats  How shou'd she such Society endure  Where she's contemn'd she cannot be secure  Milo  's a Justice they that made him so  Shou'd answer for th' oppressive  Wrongs  he'll do  His Lands almost to  Ostia  's walls extend  And of his heap'd up thousands there's no end  If Magistrates as in the Text 'tis clear  Ought to be such as Avarice abhor  This may be known of the Almighty's Mind  That  Milo  's not the Man the Text design'd  Satyr be bold and and fear not to expose  The vilest Magistrate the Nation knows  Let  Furius  read his naked  Character  Blush not to write what he shou'd blush to hear  But let them blush who in a Christian State  Made such a Devil be a Magistrate  In  Britain  's Eastern Provinces he Reigns  And serves the Devil with excessive Pains  The Nation's shame and honest Mens surprize  With Drunkard in his Face and Madman in his Eyes  The sacred Bench of Justice he Prophanes  With a Polluted Tongue and Bloody hands  His Intellects are always in a Storm  He frights the People which he shou'd reform  Antipathys may some Diseases cure  But Vertue can no contraries endure  All Reformation stopt where Vice commands  Corrupted Heads can ne'er have upright Hands  Shameless his Class of Justices he'll Swear  And plants the Vices he should punish there  His Mouths a Sink of Oaths and Blasphemies  And  Cursings  are his kind  Civilities  His servent Prayer to  Heaven  he hourly sends  But 'tis Damn himself and all his Friends  He raves in Vice and storms that he's confin'd  And studies to be worse than all Mankind  Extreams of Wickedness are his Delight  And's as pleas'd to hear that he's distinguisht by't  Exotick ways of sinning  he improves  We curse and hate he censures where he loves  So strangely retrograde to all Mankind  If crost he damns himself if pleas'd his Friend  This is the Man that helps to bless the Nation  And bully Mankind into Reformation  The true Coercive Power of the Law  Which drives the People which it cannot draw  The Nation's Scandal  England  's true Lampoon  A Drunken Whoring Justicing Buffoon  With what stupendious Impudence can he  Punish a poor Man's Immorality  How shou'd a Vicious Magistrate assent  To mend our Manners or our Government  How shall new Laws for Reformation pass  When Vice the Legislation does possess  To see old  Sy  Blasphemy descry  And old  Sne  punish Bribery  Lying exploded by a Perjur'd Knight  And Whoring Punish'd by a  Sodomite  That he the Peoples Freedom shon'd defend  Who had the King and People too trepan'd  Soldiers seek Peace Drunkards prohibit Wine  And Fops and Beaus our Politicks refine  These are the Absurdities too gross to hide  Which wise Men wonder at and Fools deride  When from the Helm  Socinian Ht  flies  And all the rest his  Tenents  stigmatize  And none remain that  Jesus Christ  denies  Judas  expell'd Lewd Lying  C  sent home  And Men of Honesty put in their Room  Blaspheming  Bs  to his FenDitches sent  To bully Justice with a Parliament  Then we shall have a Christian Government  Then shall the wisht for Reformation rise  And Vice to Virtue fall a Sacrifice  And with the Nauseous Rabble that retire  Turn out that Bawdy Saucy Poet  P    A  Vintner  's Boy the Wretch was first preferr'd  To wait at Vice's Gates and Pimp for Bread  To hold the Candle and sometimes the Door  Let in the Drunkard and let out the Whore  But as to Villains it has often chanc'd  Was for his Wit and Wickedness advanc'd  Let no Man think his new Behaviour strange  No Metamorposis can Nature change  Effects are chain'd to Causes  generally  The Rascal born will like a Rascal die  His Prince's Favours follow'd him in vain  They chang'd the Circumstance but not the Man  While out of Pocket and his Spirits low  He'd beg write Panegyricks cringe and bow  But when good Pensions had his Labour crown'd  His Panegyrick's into Satyrs turn'd  And with a true Mechanick Spirit curst  Abus'd his Royal Benefactor first  O what assiduous Pains does  P  take  To let great  D  see he cou'd mistake  Dissembling Nature false Description gave  Shew'd him the Poet and conceal'd the Knave  Tod  if such a  Wretch  is worth our Scorn  Shall Vices blackest Catalogue adorn  His hated  Character  let this supply  Too vile even for our University  Now  Satyr  to one  Character  be just  Mn  s the only Pattern and the first  A  Title  which has more of  Honour  in't  Then all his ancient Glories of Descent  Most Men their Neighbours Vices will disown  But he's the Man that does reform his own  Let those alone reproach his want of  Sense  Who with his  Crimes  have had his  Penitence  'Tis want of Sense  makes Men when they do wrong  Adjourn the promised Penitence too long  Nor let them call him  Coward  because he fears  To pull both God and Man about his Ears  Amongst the worst of  Cowards  let him be Nam'd  Who having sinn'd's  afraid to be asham'd  And to mistaken  Courage  he's betray'd  Who having sinn'd's  asham'd to be afraid  Thy Valour  M  does our Praise prevent  For thou hast had the  Courage  to Repent  Nor shall his first Mistake our  Censure  find  What  Heaven  forgets let no Man call to mind  Satyr  Make search thro' all the sober Age  To bring one season'd Drunkard on the  Stage  Sir  Stephew  nor Sir  Thomas  won't suffice  Nor six and twenty  Kentish  Justices  Your  Ex  Priesthood hardly can supply  Tho' they'r enough to Drink the Nation dry  Tho' Parson  Bd  has been steept in  Wine  And sunk the Royal  Tankard  on the  Rhine  He's not the Man that's fit to raise a Breed  Shou'd  Pk Pl  or  Rn  succeed  Or match the Size of matchless  Rochester  And make one long Debauch of Thirteen Year  It must be something can Mankind outdo  Some high Excess that's wonderful and new  Nor will Mechanick Sots our Satyr suit  'Tis Quality must grace the Attribute  These like the lofty Cedars to the Shrub  Drink  MaudlinColledge  down and  Royston Club  Such petty Drinking's a Mechanick Evil  But he's a Drunkard that outDrinks the Devil  If such can not in Court or Church appear  Let's view the Camp you'll quickly find 'em there  Brave  Tn  who Revell'd Day and Night  And always kept himself too drunk to fight  And  Od  in a Sea of Sulphur strove  To let the  Spaniards  see the Vice we love  Yet these are puny Sinners if you'll look  The dreadful Roll in Fate's Anthentick Book  The Monument of  Bacchus  still remains  Where  English  Bones lie heap'd in  Irish  Plains  Triumphant Death upon our Army trod  And Revell'd at  Dundalk  in  English  Blood  Let no Man wonder at the Dreadful Blow  For Heaven has seldom been insulted so  In vain brave  Scomberg  mourn'd the Troops that fell  While he made Vows to Heaven and they to Hell  Our Satyr trembles to review those times  And hardly finds out Words to name their Crimes  In every Tent the horrid  Juncto  's sate  To brave their Maker and despise their Fate  The Work was done Drunkenness was gone before  Life was suspended  Death could do no more  Five Regimented Heroes there appear  Captains of Thousands mighty Men of War  Glutted with Wine and Drunk with Hellish Rage  For want of other Foes they Heaven engage  Sulphur and ill extracted Fumes agree  To make each drop push on their Destiny  Th' Infernal Draughts  in Blasphemies rebound  And openly the Devil's Health went round  Nor can our Verse their latent Crime conceal  How they shook hands  to meet next day in Hell  Death pledg'd them Fate the dreadful Compact Read  Concurring Justice spoke and Four of Five lay Dead  When Men their Maker's Vengeance once defy  'Tis a certain Sign that their Destruction's nigh  'Tis vain to single out Examples here  Drunkenness will soon be th' Nation's Character  The grand Contagion's spreading over all  'Tis Epidemick now and National  Since then the Sages all Reproofs despise  Let's quit the People and Lampoon the Vice  Drunkenness is so the Error of the Time  The Youth begin to ask if 'tis a Crime  Wonder to see the grave Patricians come  From City Courts of Conscience reeling home  And think 'tis hard they shou'd no Licence make  To give the Fredom which their Father's take  The Seat of Judgment's so debauch'd with Wine  Justice seems rather to be Drunk than blind  Let's fall the Sword and her unequal Scale  Makes Right go down and Injury prevail  A Vice 'tis thought the Devil at first design'd  Not to allure but to affront Mankind  A Pleasure Nature hardly can explain  Suits none of God Almighty's Brutes but Man  An Act so nautious that had Heaven enjoyn'd  The Practice as a Duty on Mankind  They'd shun the Bliss which came so foul a way  And forfeit Heaven rather than once obey  A double Crime by which one Act we undo  At once the Gentleman and Christian too  For which no better Antidote is known  Than t' have one Drunkard to another shown  The Mother Conduit  of expatiate Sin  Where all the Seeds of Wickedness begin  The In roduction to Eternal Strife  And Prologue to the Tragedy of Life  A foolish Vice does needless Crimes reveal  And only tells the Truth it shou'd conceal  'Tis strange how Men of Sence shou'd be subdu'd  By Vices so unnatural and rude  Which gorge the Stomach to divert the Head  And to make Mankind merry make them mad  Destroys the Vitals and distracts the Brain  And rudely moves the Tongue to talk in vain  Dismisses Reason stupifies the Sence  And wond'ring Nature's left in strange suspence  The Soul's benumb'd and ceases to inform  And all the Sea of Nature's in a Storm  The dead unactive Organ feels the Shock  And willing Death attends the Fatal stroke  And is this all for which Mankind endure  Distempers past the Power of Art to cure  For which our Youth Old Age anticipate  And with Luxurious Drafts suppress their Vital Heat  Tell us ye Learned Doctors of the Vice  Wherein the high mysterious Pleasure lies  The great sublime Enjoyment's laid so deep  'Tis known in Dream and understood in Sleep  The Graduates of the  Science  first commence  And gain Perfection when they lose their Sence  Titles they give which call their Vice to mind  But Sot's the common Name for all the kind  Nature's Fanaticks who their Sense employ  The Principles of Nature to destroy  A Drunkard is a Creature God ne'er made  The Species Man the Nature retrograde  From all the Sons of Paradise they seem  To differ in the most acute Extreme  Those  covet Knowledge labour to be Wise  These  stupifie the Sense and put out Reason's Eyes  For Health and Youth  those  all their Arts employ  These  strive their Youth and Vigour to destroy  Those  Damn themselves to heap an illgot Store  These  liquidate their Wealth and covet to be Poor  Satyr examine now with heedful Care  What the Rich Trophies of the Bottle are  The mighty Conquests which her Champions boast  The Prizes which they gain and Price they cost  The Ensigns of her Order soon displace  Natures most early Beauties from the Face  Paleness at first succeeds and languid Air  And bloated Yellows supersede the Fair  The flaming Eyes betray the Nitrous Flood  Which quench the Spirits and inflame the Blood  Disperse the Rofie Beauties of the Face  And Fiery Botches triumph in the place  The tott'ring Head and trembling Hand appears  And all the Marks of Age  without the Years  Distorted Limbs gross and unweildy move  And hardly can pursue the Vice they love  A  Bacchanalian  Scarlet dies the Skin  A Sign what Sulphurons Streams arise within  The Flesh emboss'd with Ulcers and the Brain  Oppress'd with Fumes and Vapour shews in vain  What once  before the Fire  it did contain  Strange Power of Wine whose Vehicle the same  At once can both extinguish and inflame  Keen as the Light'ning does the Sword consume  And leaves the untouch'd Scabbard in its room  Nature burnt up with fiery Vapour dies  And Wine a little while MockLife supplies  Gouts and old Aches  Life's short Hours divide  At once the Drunkards Punishment and Pride  Who having all his Youthful Powers subdu'd  Enjoys Old Age and Pain  before he shou'd  Till Nature quite exhausted quits the Wretch  And leaves more Will than Power to Debauch  With Hellish Pleasure past excess he views  And fain wou'd drink but Nature must refuse  Thus Drench'd in artificial Flame he lies  Drunk in Desire forgets himself and dies  In the next Regions he expects the same  And Hell's no change for here he liv'd in Flame  Satyr  to Church  Visit the House of Prayer  And see the wretched Reformation there  Unveil the Mask and search the Sacred Sham  For Rogues of all Religion are the same  The several Tribes their numerous Titles view  And fear no Censure where the Fact is true  They all shall have thee for their constant Friend  Who more than common Sanctity pretend  Provided they'll take care the World may see  Their Practices and their Pretence agree  But count them with the  worst of Hypocrites  Whom Zeal divides and Wickedness unites  Who in Profession only are precise  Dissent in Doctrine and conform in Vice  They who from the Establish'd Church divide  Must do it out of Piety or Pride  And their Sincerity is quickly try'd  For always they that stand before the first  Will be the best of Christians  or the worst  But shun their secret Councils  O my Soul  Whose Interest can their Consciences controul  Those  AmboDexters  in Religion who  Can any thing dispute yet any thing can do  Those ChristianMountebanks that in disguise  Can reconcile Impossibilities  Alternately conform and yet dissent  And sin with both Hands but with one repent  The Man of Conscience all Mankind will love  The Knaves themselves his Honesty approve  He only to Religion can pretend  The rest do for the Name alone contend  The Verity of true Religion's known  By no Description better than its own  Of  Truth  and  Wisdom  it informs the Mind  And Nobly strives to civilize Mankind  With potent Vice maintains Eternal Strife  Corrects the Manners and reforms the Life  Tell us  ye Learned Magi  of the Schools  Who pose Mankind with Ecclesiastick Rules  What strange amphibious Things are they that can  Religion without Honesty maintain  Who own a God pretended Homage pay  But neither his nor Human Laws Obey  Blush  England  hide thy Hypocritick Face  Who has no Honesty can have no Grace  In vain we argue from Absurdities  Religion's bury'd just when Vertue dies  Vertue's the Light by which Religion's known  If this be wanting Heaven will that disown  We grant it Merits no Divine Regard  And Heaven is all from Bounty not Reward  But God must his own Nature contradict  Reverse the World its Goverment neglect  Cease to be just Eternal Law repeal  Be weak in Power and mutable in Will  If Vice and Vertue equal Fate should know  And  that unbless'd  or  this unpunish'd  go  In vain we strive Religion to disguise  And smother it with Ambiguities  Interest and Priest may perhaps invent  Strange Mysteries by way of Supplement  Schoolmen may deep perplexing Doubts disclose  And subtile Notions on the World Impose  Till by their Ignorance they are betray'd  And lost in Desarts which themselves ha' made  Zealots may Cant and Dreamers may Divine  And formal Fops to Pageantry incline  And all with specious Gravity pretend  Their spurious Metaphysicks to defend  Religion's no divided Mystick Name  For true Religion always is the same  Naked and Plain her Sacred Truths appear  From pious Frauds and dark Aenigma's clear  The meanest Sense may all the Parts discern  What Nature teaches all Mankind may learn  Even what's reveal'd is no untrodden Path  'Tis known by Rule and understood by Faith  The Negatives and Positives agree  Illustrated by Truth and Honesty  And yet if all Religion was in vain  Did no Rewards or Punishments contain  Vertues so suited to our Happiness  That none but Fools cou'd be in love with Vice  Vertue's  a Native Rectitude of Mind  Vice  the Degeneracy of Humankind  Vertue  is Wisdom Solid and Divine  Vice  is all Fool without and Knave within  Vertue  is Honour circumscrib'd by Grace  Vice  is made up of every thing that's base  Vertue  has secret Charms which all Men love  And those that do not choose her yet approve  Vice  like ill Pictures which offend the Eye  Make those that made them their own Works deny  Vertue  's the Health and Vigour of the Soul  Vice  is the foul Disease infects the whole  Vertue's  the Friend of Life the Soul of Health  The Poor Man's Comfort and the rich Man's Wealth  Vice  is a Thief a Traytor in the Mind  Assassinates the Vitals of Mankind  The Poyson of his high Prosperity  And only Misery of Poverty  To States and Governments they both extend  Vertue  's their Life and Being  Vice  their end  Vertue  establishes and  Vice  destroys  And all the end of Government unties  Vertue  's an  English  King and Parliament  Vice  is  a Czar of  Muscow  Government  Vertue  sets Bounds to Kings and limits Crowns  Vice  knows no Law and all Restraint disowns  Vertue  prescribes all Government by Rules  Vice  makes Kings Tyrants and their Subjects Fools  Vertue  seeks Peace and Property maintains  Vice  binds the Captive World in hostile Chains  Vertue  's a Beauteous Building form'd on high  Vice  is Confusion and Deformity  In vain we strive these two to reconcile  Vain and impossible the unequal Toil  Antipathies in Nature may agree  Darkness and Light Discord and Harmony  They distant Poles in spight of space may kiss  Water capitulate and Fire make Peace  But Good and Evil never can agree  Eternal Discords there Eternal Contrariety  In vain the Name of Vertue they put on  Who preach up Piety and practice none  Satyr resume the Search of secret Vice  Conceal'd beneath Religion's fair Disguise  Solid  's a Parson Orthodox and Grave  Learning and Language more than most Men have  A fluent Tongue a welldigested Stile  His Angel Voice his Hearers Hours beguile  Charm'd them wich Godliness and while he spake  We lov'd the Doctrine for the Teachers sake  Strictly to all Prescription he conforms  To Canons Rubrick Discipline and Forms  Preaches Disputes with Diligence and Zeal  Labours the Church's latent Wounds to heal  'Twou'd be uncharitable to suggest  Where this is found we should not find the rest  Yet  Solid  's frail and false to say no more  Dotes on a Bottle and what's worse a  W  Two Bastard Sons he educates abroad  And breeds them to the Function of the Word  In this the zealous Churchman he puts on  And Dedicates his Labours to the Gown  P  for so his Grace the Duke thought fit  Has in the wild of  Sussex  made his Seat  His want of Manners we cou'd here excuse  For in his Day 'twas out of Fulpituse  Railing was then the Duty of the Day  Their Sabbathwork was but to  Scold  and  Pray  But when transplanted to a CountryTown  'Twas hop'd he'd lay his fiery Talent down  At least we thought he'd so much Caution use  As not his Noble Patron to abuse  But 'tis in vain to cultivate Mankind  When Pride has once possession of his Mind  Not all his Grace's Favours could prevail  To calm that Tongue that was so used to rail  Promiscuous Gall his Learned Mouth defil'd  And Hypocondraick Spleen his Preaching spoil'd  His undistinguish'd Censure he bestows  Not by Desert but as Illnature flows  The Learned say the Causes are from hence  An Ebb of Manners and a Flux of Sence  Dilated Pride the Frenzy of the Brain  Exhal'd the Spirits and disturb'd the Man  And so the kindest thing which can be said  Is not to say he's mutinous but mad  For less could  ne're  his Antick Whims explain  He thought his Belly pregnant as his Brain  Fancy'd himself with Child and durst believe  That he by Inspiration cou'd conceive  And if the Het'rogeneous Birth goes on  He hopes to bring his Mother Church a Son  Tho' some Folks think the Doctor ought to doubt  Not how't got in  but how it will get out  Hark Satyr Now bring  Boanerges  down  A Fighting Priest a Bully of the Gown  In double Office he can serve the Lord  To fight his Battles and to preach his Word  And double Praise is to his merit due  He thumps the Pulpit and the People too  Then search my L of  L  Diocess  And see what R the Care of Souls possess  Beseech his L but to name the Priest  Went sober from his Visitation Feast  Tell him of sixteen Ecclesiastick Guides  On whom no Spirit but that of Wine abides  Who in contiguous Parishes remain  And Preach the Gospel once a Week in vain  But in their Practices unpreach it all  And sacrifice to  Bacchus  or to  Baal  Tell him a Vicious Priesthood must imply  A careless or defective Prelacy  But still be circumspect and spare the Gown  The Mitre's full as Sacred as the Crown  The Churches Sea is always in a Storm  Leave them at  Latter Lamas  to reform  If in their Gulph of Vice thou should'st appear  Thoul't certainly be lost and Shipwrack'd there  Nor medle with their Convocation Feuds  The Church's F the Clergy's Interludes  Their Church Distinctions too let us lay by  As who are  low Church R  and who are  high  Enquire not who their Passive Doctrine broke  Who swore at Random or who ly'd by Book  But since their Frailties come so very fast  'Tis plain they shou'd not be believ'd in hast  Satyr for Reasons we ha' told before  With gentle Strokes the  Men of Posts  pass o'er  Nor within Gunshot of St  Stephen  's come  Unless thou'rt well prepar'd for Martyrdom  Not that there's any want of Subjects there  But the more Crimes we have the less we'll hear  And what hast thou to do with S P  Let them sin on and tempt the Fatal Hour  'Tis vain to preach up dull Morality  Where too much Crime and too much Power agree  The hardn'd Guilt undocible appears  They'll exercise their Hands but not their Ears  Let their own Crimes be Punishment enough  And let them want the favour of Reproof  Let the CourtLadies be as lewd as fair  Let Wealth and Wickedness be  M  Care  Let  D  drench his Wit with his Estate  And  O  sin in spight of Age and Fate  On the wrong side of Eighty let him Whore  He always was and will be lewd and poor  Let  D  be proud and  O  gay  Lavish of vast Estates and scorn to pay  The Ancient D has sin'd  to's Heart's contend  And but he scorns to stoop wou'd now repent  Wou'd Heaven abate but that one Darling Sin  He'd be a Christian and a P again  Let poor  Corrina  mourn her Maidenhead  And her lost D gone out to fight for Bread  Be he Embarkt for  P  or  S    She prays he never may return again  For fear she always shou'd resist in vain  Satyr forbear the blushing Sex t' expose  For all their Vice from Imitation flows  And 'twou'd be but a very dull pretence  To miss the Cause and blame the Consequence  But let us make Mankind asham'd to Sin  Good Nature'l make the Women all come in  This one Request shall thy Rebukes express  Only to  talk a little little less  Now view the Beau's at  Will  's the Men of Wit  By Nature nice and for discerning fit  The finish'd Fops the Men of Wig and Snuff  Knights of the famous OysterBarrel Muff  Here meets the  Dyet  of Imperial Wit  And of their weighty Matters wisely treat  Send Deputies to  Tunbridge  and the  Bath  To guide your Country Beau's in Wits unerring Path  Prigson  from Nurse and Hangingsleeves got free  A little smatch of Modern Blasphemy  A powder'd Wig a Sword a Page a Chair  Learns to take Snuff drinks Chocolate and swear  Nature seems thus far to ha' led him on  And no Man thinks he was a Fop too soon  But 'twas the Devil surely drew him in  Against the Light of Nature thus to sin  That he who was a Coxcomb so compleat  Should now put in his wretched Claim for Wit  Such sober steps Men to their Ruine take  A Fop a Beau a Wit and then a Rake  Fate has the Scoundrel Party halv'd in two  The Wits are shabby and the Fops are Beau  The Reasons plain the Money went before  And so the Wits are Rakish 'cause they'r Poor  Indulgent Heaven for Decency thought fit  That some shou'd have the Money and some the Wit  Fools are a Rent Charge left on Providence  And have Equivalents instead of Sense  To whom he's bound a larger Lot to carve  Or else they'd seem to ha' been born to starve  Such with their double Dole shou'd be content  And not pretend to Gifts that Heaven ne'er sent  For 'twou'd reflect upon the Power Supream  If all his Mercies ran in one contracted Stream  The Men of Wit would by their Wealth be known  Some wou'd have all the Good and some ha' none  The useless Fools wou'd in the World remain  As Instances that  Heaven  could work in vain  Dull  Flettumacy  has his Hearts Delight  Get's up i'th' Morning to lie down at Night  His  Talk  's a Mass of weighty emptiness  None more of Business prates or knows it less  A painted lump of Laziness and Sloth  And in the Arms of  Bacchus  spends his Youth  The waiting Minutes tend on him in vain  Mispent the past unvalu'd those remain  Time  lies as useless unregarded by  Needless to him that's only Born to Dye  And yet this undiscerning thing has  Pride  And hugs the Fop that wiser Men deride  Pride  's a most useful Vertue in a Fool  The humble Cockcomb's always made a  Tool  Conceit's a Blockhead's only Happiness  He'd hang himself if he could use his Eyes  If Fools cou'd their own Ignorance discern  They'd be no longer Fools  From whence some wise  Philosophers  ha' said  Fools may sometimes be sullen but can't be mad  'Tis too much thinking which distracts the Brain  Crouds it with Vapours which dissolve in vain  The fluttering Wind of undigested thought  Keeps Mock  Idea's  in and true ones out  These guide the undirected Wretch along  With giddy Head and inconsistent Tongue  But  Flettumasy  's safe he's none of them  Bedlam  can never lay a Claim to him  Nature secur'd is unincumbred Scull  For  Flettumacy  never thinks at all  Supinely sleeps in  Diadora  's Arms  Doz'd with the Magick of her Craft and Charms  The subtile Dame brought up in Vice's School  Can love the Cully tho' she hates the Fool  Wisely her just Contempt of him conceals  And hides the Follies he himself reveals  'Tis plain the selfdenying Jilt's i'th' Right  She wants his Money  and he wants her Wit  Satyr  the Men of  Rhime  and  Jingle  shun  Has thou not Rhim'd thy self till thour't undone  On Rakish  Poets  let us not reflect  They only are what all Mankind expect  Yet 'tis not Poets have debaucht the Times  'Tis we that have so damn'd their sober Rhimes  The Tribe's good natur'd and desire to please  And when you snarl at those present you these  The World has lost its ancient Taste of Wit  And Vice comes in to raise the Appetite  For Wit has lately got the start of Sence  And serves it self as well with Impudence  Let him whose Fate it is to write for Bread  Keep this one Maxim always in his Head  If in this Age he wou'd expect to please  He must not cure but nourish their Disease  Dull Moral things will never pass for Wit  Some Years ago they might but now 'tis too late  Vertue's the faint Greensickness of the Times  'Tis luscious Vice gives Spirit to all Rhimes  In vain the Sober thing inspir'd with Wit  Writes Hymns and Histories from Sacred Writ  But let him  Blasphemy  and  Bawdy  write  The  Pious  and the  Modest  both will buy't  The blushing Virgin's pleas'd and loves to look  And plants the  Poem  next her  PrayerBook  Wly  with  Pen  and  Poverty  beset  And  Blre  Vers't in  Pyysick  as in  Wit  Tho' this of  Jesus  that of  Job  may sing  One Bawdy  Play  will twice their  Prosits  bring  And had not both carest the Flatter'd Crown  This had no Knighthood seen nor that no Gown  Had Vice no  Power  the Fancy to bewitch  Dryden  had Hang'd himself as well as  Creech  Durfey  had starv'd and half the  Poets  fled  In Foreign parts to pawn their Wit for Bread  ▪Tis Wine or Lewdness all our  Theams  supplies  Gives  Poets Power  to write and  Power  to please  Let this describe the Nations Character  One Man reads  Milton  forty  Rochester  This lost his Taste  they say  when h' lost his Sight  Milton  had Thought but  Rochester  had Wit  The Case is plain the Temper of the Time  One wrote  the Lewd  and t'other  the Sublime  And shou'd  Apollo  now descend and write  In Vertue's Praise 'twou'd never pass for Wit  The  Bookseller  perhaps wou'd say  'Twas well  But  'Twou'd not hit the Times 'Twou'd never Sell  Unless a Spice of Lewdness cou'd appear  The sprightly part wou'd still be wanting there  The Fashionable World wou'd never read  Nor the Unfashionable Poet get his Bread  'Tis  Love and Honour  must enrich our Verse  The Modern Terms  our Whoring to rehearse  The sprightly part attends the  God of Wine  The Drunken Stile  must blaze  in every Line  These are the Modern Qualities must do  To make the Poem and the Poet too  Dear  Satyr  If thou wilt reform the  Town  Thou'lt certainly be beggar'd and undone  'Tis at thy Peril if thou wilt proceed  To cry down Vice Mankind will never read  CONCLUƲSION  WHat strange Mechanick thoughts of God Man  Must this unsteady Nation entertain  To think  Almighty Science  can be blind  Wisdom it self be banter'd by Mankind  Eternal Providence be mockt with Lyes  With outsides and Improbabilities  With Laws those  Rhodomonta's  of the State  Long Proclamation and the Lord knows what  Societies  ill Manners to suppress  And new sham Wares with Immoralities  While they themselves to common Crimes betray'd  Can break the very Laws themselves ha' made  With  Jehu  's Zeal they furiously reform  And raise false Clouds which end without a Storm  But with a loose to Vice securely see  The Subject punish'd and  themselves go free  For shame your  ReformationClubs  give o'er  And jest with Men and jest with Heaven no more  But if you wou'd avenging Powers appease  Avert the Indignation of the Skies  Impending Ruin avoid and calm the Fates  Ye Hypocrites  reform your Magistrates  Your Quest of Vice at  Church  and  Court  been  There  lie the Seed of high expatiate Sin  'Tis they can cheek the Vices of the Town  When e'er they please but  to suppress their own  Our Modes of Vices from their Examples came  And their Examples only must reclaim  In vain you strive ill Manners to suppress  By the Superlatives of Wickedness  Ask but how well the Drunken Plowman looks  Set by the swearing Justice in the Stocks  And poor Street Whores in  Bridewel  feel their Fate  While  Harlot Mn  rides in a Coach of State  The Mercenary Scouts in every Street  Bring all  that have no Money  to your feet  And if you lash a Strumpet of the  Town  She only smarts  for want of half a Crown  Your Annual Lists of Criminals appear  But no Sir  Harry  or Sir  Charles  is there  Your Proclamations Rank and File appear  To Bugbear Vice and put Mankind in fear  These are the Squibs and Crackers of the Law  Which hiss and make a Bounce and then withdraw  Law  like the thunder of Immortal  Jove  Rings Peals of  Terror  from the Powers above  But when the pointed Lightnings disappear  The Cloud dissolves and all's serene and clear  Law  only aids Men to conceal their Crimes  But 'tis Example must reform the Times  Force and Authorities are all in vain  Unless you can perswade  you'll ne'er constrain  And all perswasive Power expires of Course  'Till backt with good Examples to enforce  The Magistrates must Blasphemy forbear  Be faultless first themselves and then severe  Impartial Justice equally dispence  And fear no Man nor fear no Man's Offence  Then may our Justices and not before  When they reprove the Rich correct the Poor  The Men of Honour must from Vice dissent  Before the  Rakes  and  Bullies  will repent  Vertue must be the Fashion of the  Town  Before the Beau's and Ladies put it on  Wit must no more be Bawdy and Profane  Or Wit to Vertue's reconcil'd in vain  The Clergy must be sober grave and wise  Or else in vain  they cant of Paradise  Our Reformation never can prevail  While Precepts govern and  Examples fail  Were but the Ladies vertuous as they're fair  The Beau's wou'd blush  as often as they swear  Vice wou'd grow antiquated in the  Town  Wou'd all our Men of Mode but cry it down  For Sin's a Slave to Custom and will'd to die  Whenever Habits suffer a Decay  And therefore all our Reformation here  Must work upon our Shame and  not our Fear  If once the Mode of Vertue wou'd begin  The poor will quickly be  asham'd to sin  Fashion  is such a strange bewitching Charm  For fear of being laugh'd at they'll Reform  And yet Posterity will blush to hear  Royal Examples ha' been useless here  The only  Just Exception  to our Rule  Vertue's not learnt in this Imperial  School  In vain  Maria  's Character we read  So few will in her Path of Vertue tread  In vain her Royal  Sister  recommends  Vertue to be the  Test  of all her Friends  Backt with her own Example and Commands  Our Church establisht and our  Trade  restor'd  Our Friends protected and our Peace secur'd  France  humbl'd and our Fleet's insulting  Spain  These are the  Triumphs  of a  Female Reign  At Home her milder Influence she imparts  Queen of our Vows and Monarch of our Hearts  If Change of  Sexes  thus will change our  Scenes  Grant Heaven we always may be rul'd by Queens  THE Spanish Descent A POEM  LOng had this Nation been amus'd in vain  With Posts from  Portugal  and News from  Spain  With  Ormonds  Conquests and the Fleets success  And Favours from the  Moors  at  Maccaness  The Learned  Mob  bought Compasses and Scales  And every Barber knew the  Bay  of  Cales  Show'd us the Army here and there the Fleet  Here the Troops Land and there the Foes retreat  There at St  Maries  how the  Spaniard  runs  And listen close as if they heard the Guns  And some pretend they see them the Nuns  Others describe the Castle and  Puntalls  And tell how easie 'tis to conquer  Cales  Wisely propose to let the Silver come  And help to pay the Nations Debts at Home  But still they count the Spoils without the Cost  And still the News came faster than the Post  The graver Heads like Mountebanks of State  Of Abdications and Revolts Debate  Expect a Revolution shou'd appear  As Cheap and Easy as it had done here  Bring the Revolting  Grandees  to the C  ast  And give the Duke  D' Anjou  up for lost  Doom him to  France  to seek relief in vain  And send the Duke of  Austria  to  Spain  Canvas the Council at  Madrid  and find  How all the  Spanish Courtiers  stand enclin'd  Describe the strange Convulsions of the  State  And old  Carreroe  's Sacrific'd to Fate  Then all the  Stage  of Action they survey  And wish our Generals knew as much as they  Some have their Fancies so exceeding Bold  They saw the Queens fall out and heard 'em scold  Nor is the thing so strange for if they did  'Twas talking from  Toledo  to  Madrid  And now the Farce is Acting o'er again  The meaning of our Mischiefs to explain  The Learned Mob  O'erread  in Arms and Law  The Cause of their Miscarriages foresaw  Tell us the Loytering Minutes were mispent  Too long a going and too few that went  Exalt the  Catalonian  Garison  The new made Works the Platform and the  Town  Tell us it was impossible to Land  And all their Batteries sunk into the  Sand  Some are all Banter and the Voyage despise  For fruitless Actions seldom pass for wise  Tell us 'twas like our  English  Politicks  To think to wheedle  Spain  with  Hereticks  The disproportion'd Force they Banter too  The Ships too Many and the Men too Few  Then they find Fault with  Conduct  and condemn  Sometimes the Officers sometimes the Men  Nor 'scapes his Grace the  Satyr  of the  Town  Whoever fails success shall fail Renown  Sir  George  comes in amongst the Indiscreet  Sometimes the Army's censur'd then the Fleet  How the abandon'd  Country  they destroy'd  And made their early Declarations void  Too hasty Proofs of their Protection gave  Plund'ring the People they came there to save  As if the  Spaniards  were so Plagu'd with  France  To fly to  Thieves  for their deliverance  But amongst all the Wisdom of the  Town  The vast designs of Fate remain unknown  Unguest at unexpected hid from thoughts  For no Man look't for Blessings in our Faults  Mischances sometimes are a Nations Good  Rightly Improv'd and Nicely Understood  Ten Years we felt the Dying Pangs of War  And fetch'd our Grief and Miseries from far  Our  English  Millions Foreign War maintains  And  English  Blood has drencht the Neighbouring Plains  Nor shall we Blush to Boast what all Men own  Uncommon  English  Valour has bin shown  The forward Courage of our  Ill Paid Men  Deserves more Praise than Nature spares my Pen  What cou'd they not perform or what endure  Witness the mighty Bastions of  Namur  We Fasted much and we attempted more  But ne'er cou'd come to giving thanks before  Unless 'twas when the Fatal Strife was o'er  Some secret  Achan  Curst our Enterprise  And  Israel  fled before her Enemies  Whether the Poisonous Particles were hid  In us that Follow'd  or in Them that Led  What Fatal Charm benumn'd the Nations Sence  To struggle with Eternal Providence  Whether some Curse or else some  Perjur'd Vow  Or some strange Guilt that's expiated now  Was it the  Pilots  who ill steer'd the  State  Or was it the Decisive Will of Fate  'Tis hard to tell but this too well we know  All things went backward or went on too slow  Small was the Glory of our High  Success  A tedious War and an Imperfect Peace  Peace Dearly purchas'd and which Cost us more  Great Kingdoms than we Conquer'd  Towns  before  Actions may miss of their deserv'd Applause  When Heaven approves the Men and not the Cause  And well contriv'd Designs miscarry when  Heaven may approve the Cause but not the Men  Here then's the Ground of our Expence of Blood  The  Sword  of  Gideon  's not the  Sword  of  God  The Mighty and the Wise are laid aside  And Victory  the Sex  has Dignified  We have been us'd to  Female Conquests  here  And  Queens  have been the Glory of the War  The Scene Revives with Smiles of Providence  All things Declin'd before and Prosper since  And as if illSuccess had been entail'd  The Posthume Projects are the last that fail'd  As Heaven whose works were hid from Human view  Would blast our old Designs and bless our New  And now the Baffl'd Enterprize grows stale  Their Hopes Decrease and juster Doubts prevail  The unattempted  Town  sings Victory  And scar'd with Walls and not with Men we flye  Great Conduct in our safe Retreat we shew  And bravely Reembark when none pursue  The Guns the Ammunition's put on Board  And what we could not Plunder we restor'd  And thus we quit the  Andalusian  Shores  Drencht with the  Spanish  Wine and  Spanish  Ws  With songs of scorn the  Arragonians  Sing  And loud  Te Deums  make the Valleys Ring  Uncommon Joys now raise the hopes of  Spain  And  Vigo  does their PlateFleet entertain  The vast Galleons deepBallased with Ore  Safely reach home to the  Galitian  Shore  The Double Joy spreads from  Madrid  to  Rome  The  English  fled the Silver Fleet comes home  From thence it reaches to the Banks of  Po  And the Loud Cannons let the  Germans  know  The Rattling Volleys tell their shortliv'd Joys  And roar  Te Deum  out in Smoak and Noise  To  Milan  next it flies on Wings of Fame  There the Young Monarch and his Heroes came  From sad  Luzara  and the  Mantuan  Walls  To seek New Dangers and to Rescue  Cales  His Joy for welcome Treasure he exprest  But grieves at his Good Fortune in the rest  The Flying  English  he had wish'd to stay  To crown with Conquests one Victorious Day  The Priests in high Procession shew their Joy  And all the Arts of Eloquence employ  To feed his Pride of fancy'd Victories  And raise his untry'd Valour to the Skies  The flattering  Courtiers  his vain mind possess  With Airy hopes of Conquest and Success  Prompt his Young thoughts to run on new Extreams  And Sycophantick Pride his Heart Inflames  His  Native Crime  springs up his Pulse beats high  With thoughts of Universal Monarchy  Fancies his Foreign Enemies supprest  And Boasts too soon how he'll subdue the Rest  Princes like other Men are Blind to Fate  He only sees the Event who does the Cause Create  From hence thro'  France  the Welcome Tidings fly  To mock his ancient Sire with mushroom Joy  Raptures possess the ambitious Heads of  France  And Golden Hopes their new Designs advance  Now they Consult to Crush the World agen  And talk of riffling  Christendom  for Men  New Fleets new Armies and new Leagues contrive  And swallow Men and Nations up alive  Prescribe no Bounds to their ambitious Pride  But first the Wealth and then the World divide  Excess of Pride to airy Madness grows  And makes Men strange Romantick things propose  The Head turns round and all the Fancy's vain  And makes the World as Giddy as the Brain  Men that consult such weighty things as those  All possible Disasters should suppose  In vain great Princes mighty things Invent  While Heaven retains the Power to prevent  He that to General Mischief makes pretence  Should first know how to Conquer Providence  Such strive in vain and only shew Mankind  How Tyrants cloath'd with Power are all enclin'd  Mean while our Melancholly Fleet steers Home  Some griev'd for past for future Mischiefs some  Disaster swells the Blood and Spleen the Face  And ripens them for glorious things apace  With deep Regret they turn their Eyes to  Spain  And wish they once might visit them again  Little they Dreamt that Good which Heaven prepar'd  No merit from below no Signs from Heaven appear'd  No hints unless from their high ripen'd Spleen  And strange ungrounded Sympathy within  The silent Duke from all misconduct free  Alone enjoys the Calm of  Honesty  Fears not his Journal should be fairly shown  And sighs for  Englands  Errors not his own  His constant Tempers all Serene and Clear  First free from Guilt and therefore free from fear  Not so the rest for conscious Thoughts become  More restless now the nearer they come home  The Partymaking Feuds on Board begin  For People always Quarrel when they sin  Reflect with shame upon the things misdone  And shift their Faults about from One to One  Prepare Excuses and compute their Friends  And dread the Fate which their Desert attends  Some wish for Storms and curse the Wind and Sails  And dream no doubt of Gibbets and of Jayls  Imaginary Punishments appear  And suited to their secret Guilt's their fear  Their hast'ning Fate in their own Fancies Read  And few 'tis fear'd their Innocence can plead  Then their sweet Spoils to trusty Hands convey  And throw the  rifl'd Gods of Spain  away  Disgorge that Wealth they dare not entertain  And wish the Nuns  their Maidenheads again  Dismiss their  Wealth  for fear of  Witnesses  And Purge their Coffers and their Consciences  Cursing their  ill got Trifles  but in vain  For still the Guilt and still the fears remain  Tell us ye Rabbies of abstruser Sense  Who jumble Fate and Fools with Providence  Is this the chosen Army this the Fleet  For which Heavens Praises sound in every Street  Cou'd Heaven provide them one occasion more  Who had so illDischarg'd themselves before  That Fleet so many former Millions lost  So little had Perform'd so much had Cost  That Fleet so often Man'd with Knaves before  That serv'd us all the War to make us Poor  That twice had made their fruitless Voyage to  Spain  And saw the  Streights  and  so came Home again  Our  Wooden Walls  that should defend our Trade  And many a  Witless Wooden  Voyage ha' made  How oft have they been fitted out in vain  Wasted our Money and destroy'd our Men  Betray'd our Merchants and expos'd their Fleets  And caus'd Eternal Murmurs in our Streets  The Nation's Genius sure prevails above  And Heaven conceals his Anger show's his Love  The Nations Guardian Angel has prevail'd  And on her Guardian Queen new Favours has entail'd  Now let glad  Europe  in her turn rejoice  And sing new  Triumphs  with exalted Voice  See the glad Post of  Tidings  wing'd with News  With suited Speed the Wondring Fleet pursues  His haste discern'd increases their Surprize  The more they wonder and the more he flies  Nor Wind nor Seas proportion'd speed can bear  For Joy and Hope have swifter Wings than Fear  With what Surprise of Joy they meet the News  Joys that to every Vein new Spirits infuse  The wild Excess in Shouts and Cries appear  For Joys and Griefs are all irregular  Councils of War for sake of Forms they call  But shame admits of no Disputes at all  How should they differ where no Doubt can be  But if they shou'd accept of Victory  Whether they shou'd the great occasion take  Or baffle Heaven and double their mistake  Whether the naked and defenceless Prize  They shou'd accept Or Heaven and that despise  Whether they shou'd revive their Reputation  Or sink it twice and twice betray the Nation  Who dare the horrid Negative design  Who dare the Last suggest the First decline  Envy her self  For Satan's always there  And keeps his Councils with the God of War  Tho' with her swelling Spleen she seem'd to burst  Will'd the Design while the Event she curs'd  The word's gone out and now they spread the Main  With swelling Sails and swelling Hopes for  Sapin  To double Vengeance prest where e'er they come  Resolv'd to pay the haughty  Spaniard  home  Resolv'd by future Conduct to attone  For all our past Mistakes and all their own  New Life springs up in every  English  Face  And fits them all for Glorious things apace  The Booty some excites and some the Cause  But more the Hope to gain their lost Applause  Eager their sully'd Honour to restore  Some Anger whets some Pride and Vengeance more  The lazy Minutes now pass on too slow  Fancy flies faster than the Winds can blow  Impatient Wishes lengthen out the Day  They chide the loytering Winds for their delay  But Time is Natures faithful Messenger  And brings up all we wish as well as all we fear  The Mists clear up and now the Scout discryes  The subject of their Hopes and Victories  The wish'd for Fleets embay'd in Harbour lye  Unfit to fight and more unfit to fly  Triumphant Joy throughout the Navy flyes  Eccho'd from Shore with Terrour and Surprize  Strange Power of Noise  which at one simple sound  At once shall some incourage some confound  In vain the Lyon tangl'd in the snare  With Anguish roars and rends the trembling Air  'Tis vain to struggle with Almighty Fate  Vain and impossible the weak Debate  The Mighty Booms the Forts resist in vain  The Guns with fruitless Force  in Noise  complain  See how the Troops intrepidly fall on  Wish for more Foes and think they fly too soon  With eager Fury to their Forts pursue  And think the odds of Four to One too few  The Land's first Conquer'd  and the Prize attends  Fate beckens in the Fleet to back their Friends  Despair suceeeds They struggle now

Gods of old no such Oblations knew  Their Spices weak and their Perfumes but few  The frighted  Spaniards  from their  Treasure  fly  Loth to forsake their Wealth  but loth to dye  Here a vast Carrack flyes while none pursue  Bulg'd on the Shore by her Distracted Crew  There like a mighty Mountain she appears  And groans beneath the Golden weight she bears  Conquest perverts the Property of Friend  And makes Men ruine what they can't defend  Some blow their  Treasure  up into the Air  With all the wild Excesses of Despair  Strange Fate that War such odd Events shou'd have  Friends would destroy

Reformation of Manners and suppressing Immorality in the Nation  The PREFACE  REformation of Manners is a Work so Honourable and at this Time so absolutely necessary that like the Reform of our Money it can be no longer delay'd  The Ways by which the present Torrent of Vice has been let in upon the Nation and by which it maintains the Tyranny it has usurp'd on the Lives of the Inhabitants are too plain to be hid The following Sheets aim at the Work by leading to the most direct means  Viz  Reformation by Example Laws are  in Terrorem  Punishments and Magistrates Compel and put a Force upon Mens Minds but Example is Perswasive and Gentle and draws by a Secret Invisible and almost Involuntary Power  If there can be any Remedies proposed more proper to bring it to pass they that know them would do well to bring them forth In the mean time the Author thinks Conscience in the Minds of Men Impartially Consulted will give a  Probatum est  to the following Proposal and to that Judgment be refers all those who Object against it  THE The Poor Man's PLEA  IN searching for a proper Cure of an Epidemick Distemper Physicians do tell us 'tis first necessary to know the Cause of that Distemper from what Part of the Body and from what ill Habit it proceeds and when the Cause is discover'd it is to be removed that the Effect may cease of its self but if removing the Cause will not work the Cure then indeed they proceed to apply proper Remedies to the Disease it self and the particular Part afflicted  Immorality is without doubt the present reigning Distemper of the Nation And the King and Parliament who are indeed the proper Physicians seem nobly inclin'd to undertake the Cure 'Tis a Great Work well worthy their utmost Pains The Honour of it were it once perfected would add more Trophies to the  Crown  than all the Victories of  this Bloody War  or the Glories of  this Honourable Peace  But as a Person under the Violence of a Disease sends in vain for a Physician unless he resolves to make use of his Prescription so in vain does the King attempt to reform a Nation unless they are willing to reform themselves and to submit to his Prescriptions  Wickedness is an Ancient Inhabitant in this Country and 'tis very hard to give its Original  But however difficult that may be 'tis easy to look back to a time when we were not so generally infected with Vice as we are now and 'twill seem sufficient to enquire into the Causes of our present Defection  The Protestant Religion seems to have an unquestioned  Title  to the first introducing a strict Morality  mong us and 'tis but just to give the Honour of it where 'tis so eminently due Reformation of Manners has something of a Natural Consequence in it from Reformation in Religion For since the principles of the  Protestant  Religion disown the Indulgencies of the  Roman  Pontiff by which a thousand Sins are  as Venial Crimes  bought off and the Priest to  save God Almighty the trouble  can blot them out of the Account before it comes to his hand common Vices lost their Charter and men could not sin at so cheap a Rate as before The Protestant Religion has in it self a Natural Tendency to Virtue as a standing Testimony of its own Divine Original and accordingly it has suppress'd Vice and Immorality in all the Countries where it has had a Footing It has civiliz'd Nations and reform'd the very  Tempers  of its Professors Christianity and Humanity has gone hand in hand in the World and there is so visible a difference between the other Civiliz'd Governments in the World and those who now are under the Protestant Powers that it carries its Evidence in it self  The Reformation begun in  England  in the days of King  Edward  the Sixth and afterwards gloriously finished by Queen  Elizabeth  brought the  English  Nation to such a degree of Humanity and Sobriety of Conversation as we have reason to doubt will hardly be seen again in our Age  In King  James  the First's time the Court affecting something more of Gallantry and Gaiety Luxury got footing and twenty Years Peace together with no extraordinary Examples from the Court gave too great Encouragement to Licentiousness  If it took footing in King  James  the First's time it took a deep Root in the Reign of his Son and the Liberty given the Soldiery in the Civil War dispers'd all manner of Prophanness throughout the Kingdom That Prince tho' very Pious in his own  Person and Practice and had the Misfortune to be the first King of  England  and perhaps in the World that ever establish'd Wickedness by a Law By what unhappy Council or secret ill Fate he was guided to it is hard to determine but the  Book of Sports  as it was called that Book to tolerate the Exercise of all Sports and Pastimes on the Lord'sDay tended more to the vitiating the Practice of this Kingdom  as to keeping that Day  than all the Acts of Parliament Proclamations and Endeavours of future Princes has done or ever will do to reform it  And yet the People of  England  express'd a general sort of an Aversion to that Liberty  and some  as if glutted with too much Freedom when the Reins of Law were taken off refused that Practice they allow'd themselves in before  In the time of King  Charles  the Second Lewdness and all manner of Debauchcry arriv'd to its Meridian The Encouragement it had from the Practice and Allowance of the Court is an invincible Demonstration how far the Influence of our Government extends in the Practice of the People  The present King and his late Queen whose Glorious Memory will be dear to the Nation as long as the World stands have had all this wicked Knot to unravel This was the first thing the Queen set upon while the King was engaged in his Wars abroad She first gave all sorts of Vice a general Discouragement and on the contrary rais'd the value of Virtue and Sobriety by her Royal Example The King having brought the War to a Glorious Conclusion and settled an Honourable Peace in his very first Speech to his  Parliament  proclaims a New War against  Prophaneness  and  Immorality  and goes on also to discourage the practice of it by his Royal Example  Thus the Work is begun nobly and regularly and the  Parliament  the General Representative of the Nation  follows this Royal Example in enacting Laws to suppress all manner of Prophaneness  c  These are Great Things and wellimprov'd would give an undoubted Overthrow to to the Tyranny of Vice and the Dominion  Prophaneness  has usurp'd in the hearts of Men  But we of the  Plebeii  find our selves justly aggrieved in all this Work of Reformation and this Reforming Rigor makes the real Work impossible Wherefore we find our selves forced to seek Redress of our Grievances in the old honest way of Petitioning Heaven to relieve us And in the mean time we solemnly Enter our  Protestation  against the Vicious part of the Nobility and Gentry of the Nation as follows  First  We Protest That we do not find impartially enquiring into the matter speaking of Moral Goodness that you are not one jot better than we are  your Dignities Estates and Quality excepted  'Tis true we are all bad enough and we are willing in good Manners to agree that we are as wicked as you but we cannot find on the exactest Scrutiny but that in the Commonwealth of Vice the Devil has taken care to level Poor and Rich into one Class and is fairly going on to make us all Graduates in the last Degree of Immorality  Secondly  We do not find that all the Proclamations Declarations and Acts of Parliament yet made have any  effective Power  to punish  you  for your Immoralities as it does  us  Now while  you  make Laws to punish  us  and let  your selves  go free tho' guilty of the same Vices and Immoralities those Laws are unjust and unequal in themselves  'Tis true the Laws do not express a Liberty to  you  and a Punishment to  us  and therefore the King and Parliament are free as King and Parliament from this our Appeal but the Gentry and Magistrates of the  Kingdom while they execute those Laws upon us the poor Commons and themselves practising the same Crimes in defiance of the Laws both of God and Man go unpunish'd  This  is the Grievance we protest against as unjust and unequal  Wherefore till the Nobility Gentry Justices of the Peace and Clergy will be pleased either to Reform their own Manners and suppress their own Immoralities or find out some method and Power impartially to punish themselves when guilty we Humbly crave Leave to Object against setting any Poor Man in the Stocks or sending them to the House of Correction for Immoralities as the most unequal and unjust way of proceeding in the World  And now Gentlemen  That this Protestation may not seem a little too Rude and a Breach of Good Manners to our Superiours ws crave Leave to subjoin our Humble Appeal to your selves and will for once knowing you as  English  Gentlemen to be Men of Honour  make you Judges in your own Case  First  Gentlemen We appeal to your selves whether ever it be likely to perfect the Reformation of Manners in this Kingdom without you Whether Laws to punish us without your Example also to influence us will ever bring the Work to pass  The first Step from a loose vicious Practice in this Nation was begun by King  Edward  the Sixth backt by a Reform'd Clergy and a Sober Nobility Queen  Elizabeth  carried it on 'Twas the Kings and the Gentry which first again Degenerated from that strict Observation of Moral Virtues and from thence carried Vice on to that degree it now appears in From the Court Vice took its  Progress  into the Country and in the Families of the Gentry and Nobility it harbour'd till it took heart under their  Protection  and made a general Salley into the Nation and We  the poor Commons who have been always easy to be guided by the Example of our Landlords and Gentlemen have really been debauch'd into Vice by their Examples And it must be the  Example of you the Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdom  that must put a Stop to the Flood of  Vice  and  Prophaneness  which is broken in upon the Country or it will never be done  Our Laws against all manner of Vicious  Practices  are already very severe But Laws are useless insignificant things if the Executive  Power  which lies in the Magistrate be not exerted The Justices of the  Peace  have the power to punish but if they do not put forth that power 'tis all one as if they had none at all Some have possibly exerted this power but whereever it has been so put forth it has fallen upon us the poor Commons These are all Cobweb Laws in which the small Flies are catch'd and great ones break thro' My Lord Mayor has whipt about the poor Beggars and a few scandalous Whores have been sent to the House of Correction some Alehousekeepers and Vintners have been fin'd for drawing Drink on the Sabbath day but all this falls upon us of the Mob the poor  Plebeii  as if all the Vice lay among us for we do not find the Rich Drunkard carri'd before my Lord Mayor nor a Swearing Lewd  Merchant The man with a Gold Ring and Gay Cloaths  may Swear before the Justice or at the Justice may reel home through the open Streets and no man take any notice of it but if a poor man get drunk or swears an Oath he must to the Stocks without Remedy  In the second place We appeal to your selves whether Laws or  Proclamations  are capable of having any Effect towards a Reformation of  Manners  while the Benches of our Justices are infected with the scandalous Vices of Swearing and Drunkenness while our Justices themselves shall punish a man for Drunkenness with a  God damn him set him in the Stocks  And  if Laws and Proclamations are useless in the Case then they are good for nothing and had as good be let alone as publish'd  'Tis hard Gentlemen to be punish'd for a Crime by a man as guilty as our selves and that the Figure a man makes in the World must be the reason why he shall not be liable to the Law This is really punishing men for being poor which is no Crime at all as a Thief may be said to said to be hang'd not for the Fact but for being taken  We further appeal to your selves Gentlemen to inform us whether there be any particular reason why you should be allow'd the full Career of your corrupt Appetites without the Restraint of Laws while you your selves agree that such Offences shall be punished in us and do really execute the Law upon the Poor People when brought before you for the same things  Wherefore that the Work of Reformation of Manners may go on and be brought to Perfection to the Glory of God and the great Honour of the King and Parliament That Debauchery and Prophaness Drunkenness Whoring and all sorts of Immoralities may be suppress'd we humbly propose the Method which may effectually accomplish so great a Work  That the Gentry and Clergy who are the Leaders of us poor ignorant people and our Lights erected on high places to Guide and Govern us would in the first place put a voluntary Force upon themselves and effectually reform their own Lives their way of conversing and their common Behaviour among their Servants and Neighbours  The Gentry They are the Original of the Modes and Customs and Manners of their Neighbours and their examples in  the Countries especially  are very moving There are three several Vices which have the principal Mannagement of the greatest  part of Mankind  viz  Drunkenness Swearing and Whoring all of them very ill becoming a Gentleman however Custom may have made them Modish Where none of these Three are in a House there is certainly something of a Plantation of God in the Family for they are such Epidemic Distempers that hardly Humane Nature is entirely free from them  Drunkenness that Brutish Vice a Sin so sordid and so much a Force upon Nature that had God Almighty enjoyn'd it as a Duty I believe many a Man would have ventur'd the loss of Heaven rather than have have perform'd it The  Pleasure  of it seems to be so secretly hid that wild Heathen Nations know nothing of the matter 'tis only discover'd by the wise people of these  Northern  Countries who are  Proficients  in Vice  Philosophers  in Wickedness who can extract a Pleasure to themselves in losing their Understanding and make themselves Sick at Heart for their Diversion  If the History of this well bred Vice was to be written 'twould plainly appear that it begun among the Gentry and from them was handed down to the poorer sort who still love to be like their Betters After the Restitution of King  Charles  the Second when drinking the King's Health became the distinction between a  Cavalier  and a  Roundhead  Drunkenness  began its Reign  and it has Reign'd almost Forty Years The Gentry caress'd this Beastly Vice at such a Rate that no Companion no Servant was thought proper unless he could bear a Quantity of Wine and to this Day 'tis added to the Character of a Man as an additional Title when you would speak well of him  He is an Honest Drunken Fellow  as if his Drunkenness was a Recommendation of his Honesty From the practice of this nasty Faculty our Gentlemen have  arriv'd to the teaching of it and that it might be effectually preserv'd to the next Age have very early instructed the Youth in it Nay so far has Custom prevail'd that the Top of a Gentleman's Entertainment has been to make his Friend Drunk and the Friend is so much reconcil'd to it that he takes that for the effect of his Kindness which he ought as much to be affronted at as if he had kick'd him down Stairs Thus 'tis become a Science and but that the Instruction proves so easie and the Youth too apt to learn possibly we might have had a Colledge erected for it before now The further Perfection of this Vice among the Gentry will appear in two things that 'tis become the Subject of their Glory and the way of expressing their Joy for any publick Blessing  Jack  said a Gentleman of very high Quality when after the Debate in the House of Lords K  William  was Voted into the Vacant Throne  Jack  says he  God damn ye  Jack  go home to your Lady and tell her we have got a Protestant King and Queen and go make a Bonfire as big as a House and bid the Butler make ye all Drunk ye Dog  Here was sacrificing to the Devil for a Thanksgiving to God Other Vices are committed as Vices and Men act them in private and are willing to hide them but Drunkenness they are so fond of that they will glory in it boast of it and endeavour to promote it as much as possible in others 'Tis a Triumph to a Champion of the Bottle to repeat how many Quarts of Wine he has Drank at a sitting and how he made such and such Honest Fellows Drunk Men  Lye  and  Forswear  and  hide it  and are  asham'd of it  as indeed they have reason to do But Drunkenness and Whoring are Accomplishments Men begin to value themselves upon repeat them with Pleasure and affect a sort of Vanity in the History are content all the world should be Witnesses of their Intemperance and have  made the Crime a Badge of Honour to their Breeding and introduce the practice as a Fashion And whoever gives himself the Trouble to Reflect on the Custom of our Gentlemen in their Families encourageing and promoting this Vice of Drunkenness among the poor Commons will not think it a Scandal upon the Geutry of  England  if we say That the Mode of Drinking as 'tis now practised had its Original from the Practice of the CountryGentlemen and they again from the Court  It may be objected and God forbid it should not That there are a great many of our Nobility and Gentlemen who are Men of Honour and Men of Morals and therefore this Charge is not universal To which we answer Tis universal for all that because those very Gentlemen tho' they are negatively clear as to the Commission of the Crimes we speak of yet are positively guilty in not executing that Power the Law has put into their hands with an Impartial Vigour For where was that Gentleman or Justice of the Peace ever yet found who executed the Terms of the Law upon a Drunken Swearing Lewd Gentleman his Neighbour but the Quality of the Person has been a License to the open Exercise of the worst Crimes as if there were any Baronets Knights or Squires in the next World who because of those little steps Custom had raised them on higher than their Neighbours should be exempted from the Divine Judicature or that as Captain  Vratz  said who was Hang'd for Murth'ring Esquire  Thynn God would show them some respect as they were Gentlemen  If there were any reason why a Rich Man should be permitted in the publick Exercise of Open Immoralities and not the poor Man something might be said But if there be any difference it lies the other way for the Vices of a poor Man affect only himself but the Rich Man's Wickedness affects all the Neighbourhood  gives offence to the Sober and encourages and hardens the Lewd and quite overthrows the weak Resolutions of such as are but indifferently fixed in their Virtue and Morality If my own Watch goes false it deceives me and none else but if the Town Clock goes false it deceives the whole Parish The Gentry are the Leaders of the Mob if they are Lewd and Drunken the others strive to imitate 'em if they Discourage Vice and Intemperance the other will not be so forward in it nor so fond of it  To think then to effect a Reformation by punishing the Poor while the Rich seem to Enjoy a Charter for Wickedness is like  taking away the Effect that the Cause may cease  We find some People very fond of Monopolizing a Vice they would have all of it to themselves they must as my Lord  Rochester  said of himself  Sin like a Lord  little sneaking Sins won't serve turn but they must be Lewd at a rate above the Common Size to let the World see they are capable of it  Our Laws seem to take no Cognizance of such perhaps for the same reason that  Lycurgus  made no Law against  Parricide  because he would not have the Sin named among his Citizens  Now the poor Man sees no such Dignity in Vice as to study Degrees we are downright in Wickedness as we are in our Dealings if we are Drunk 'tis plain Drunkenness Swearing and Whoring is all Blunderbus with us we don't affect such Niceties in our Conversation and the Justices use us accordingly nothing but the Stocks or the House of Correction is the Case when we are brought before them but when our Masters the Gentlemen come to their Refined Practice and Sin by the Rules of Quality we do not find any thing come of it but false Heraldry the Vice is punish'd by the Vice and the Punishment renews the Crime  The Case in short is this the Lewdness Prophaneness and Immorality of the Gentry which is the main Cause of the General Debauchery of the Kingdom is not at all toucht by our Laws as they are now Executed and while it remains so the Reformation of Manners can never be brought to pass nor Prophaneness and Immorality Suppress'd and therefore the punishing the Poor distinctly is a Mock upon the good Designs of the King and Parliament an Act of Injustice upon them to punish them and let others as guilty go free and a sort of Cruelty too in taking the advantage of their Poverty to make them suffer because they want Estates to purchase their Exemption  We have some weak Excuses for this Matters which must be considered As  The Justice of the Peace is a  Passive Magistrate  till an Information be brought before him and is not to take notice of any thing but as it is laid in Fact and brought to an Affidavit Now if an Affidavit be made before a Justice that such or such a man Swore or was Drunk he must or cannot avoid Finding him the Law obliges him to it let his Quality be what it will so that the Defect is not in the Law nor in the Justice but in the want of Information  The Name of an Evidence or Informer is so scandalous that to attempt to inform against a Man for the most open Breach of the Laws of Morality is enough to denominate a man unfit for Society a Rogue and an Informer are Synonimous in the Vulgar Acceptation so much is the real Detection of the openest Crimes against God and Civil Government Discouraged and Avoided  The Impossibility of the Cure is such and the Habit has so obtain'd upon all Mankind that it seems twisted with Human Nature as an Appendix to Natural Frailty which it is impossible to separate from it  For Answer  'Tis true the Justice of the Peace is in some respect a  Passive Magistrate  and does not act but by Information but such Information would be brought if it were encouraged if Justices of of the Peace did acquaint themselves with their Neighbourhood they would soon hear of the Immoralities of the Parish and if they did impartially Execute the Law on such as offended without respect of Persons they would soon have an Account of the Persons and Circumstances Besides 'tis not want of Information but want of punishing what they have Information of A Poor Man informs against a Great Man the Witness is discouraged the Man goes unpunish'd and the Poor Man gets the Scandal of an Informer and then 'tis but too often that our Justices are not Men of extraordinary Morals themselves and who shall Inform a Justice of the Peace that such a Man Swore when he may be heard to Swear himself as fast as another Or who shall bring a Man before a Justice for being Drunk when the Justice is so Drunk himself he cannot order him to be set in the Stocks  Besides the Justice has a Power to punish any Fact he himself sees committed and to enquire into any he hears of casually and if he will stand still and see those Acts of Immorality committed before his Face who shall bring a Poor Man before him to be punished Thus I have heard a Thousand horrid Oaths Sworn on a BowlingGreen in the presence of a Justice of the Peace and he take no Notice of it and go home the next hour and set a Man in the Stocks for being Drunk  As to the Scandal of Informing  'tis an Error in Custom  and a great Sin against Justice 'tis necessary indeed that all Judgment should be according to Evidence and to discourage Evidence is to discourage Justice but that a Man in Trial of the Morality of his Neighbour should be  shamed to appear must have some particular cause  It proceeds from the Modishness of the Vice it has so obtain'd upon some Men Mens Practices that to appear against what almost all Men approve seems malicious and has a certain prospect either of Revenge or of a Mercenary Wretch that Informs meerly to get a Reward 'Tis true if no Reward be plac'd upon an Information no Man will take the trouble and again if too great a Reward Men of Honour shun the thing because they scorn the Fee and to inform meerly for the Fee has something of a Rascal in it too and from these reasons arises the Backwardness of the People  The very same Rich Men we speak of are the persons who discourage the Discovery of Vice by scandalizing the Informer a Man that is any thing of a Gentleman scorns it and the Poor still Mimick the Humour of the Rich and hate an Informer as they do the Devil 'Tis strange the Gentlemen should be asham'd to detect the Breach of those Laws which they were not asham'd to make but the very Name of an Informer has gain'd so black an Idea in the minds People because some have made a Trade of informing against People for Religion have misbehaved themselves that truly 'twill be hard to bring any Man either of Credit or Quality to attempt it  But the main thing which makes our Gentlemen backward in the prosecution of Vice is their practicing the same Crimes themselves and they have so much wicked Modesty and Generosity in them being really no Enemies to the thing it self that they cannot with any sort of Freedom punish in others what they practice themselves  In the Times of Executing the Laws against Dissenters we found a great many Gentlemen very Vigorous in Prosecuting their Neighbours they did not stick to appear in Person to disturb  Meetings  and  demolish the  MeetingHouses  and rather than fail would be Informers themselves the reason was because they had also a dislike to the thing but we never found a Dissenting Gentleman or Justice of the Peace forward to do thus because they approved of it Now were our Gentlemen and Magistrates real Enemies to the Immoralities of this Age did they really hate Drunkenness as a Vice they would be forward and zealous to root the practice of it out of the Neighbourhood they would not be backward or asham'd to detect Vice to disturb Drunken Assemblies to disperse those Plantations of Leachery the Publick Bawdy Houses which are almost as openly allowed as the  Burdelloes  in  Italy  They would be willing to have all sorts of Vices Suppress'd and glory in putting their hands to the Work they would not be asham'd to appear in the detecting Debauchery or afraid to embroil themselves with their Rich Neighbours 'Tis Guilt of the same Fact which makes Connivance and till that guilt be removed the Gentlemen of  England  neither will or can indeed with any kind of Honour put their hands to the Reforming it in their Neighbours  But I think 'tis easie to make it appear that this difficulty of Informing may be removed and there need not be much occasion for that Scandalous Employment  'Tis in the power of the Gentry of  England  to reform the whole Kingdom without either Laws Proclamations or Informers and without their Concurrence all the Laws Proclamations and Declarations in the World will have no Effect the Vigour of the Laws consists in their Executive Power Ten thousand Acts of Parliament signifie no more than One single Proclamation unless the Gentlemen in whose hands the Execution of those Laws is placed take care to see them duly made use of and how can Laws be duly Executedbut by an impartial Distribution of equal Rewards  and Punishments without Regard to the Quality and Degree of the Persons The Laws push on the Justices now and they take care to go no faster than they are driven but would the Justices push on the Laws Vice would fly before them as Dust in the Wind and Immoralities would be soon suppress'd but it can never be expected that the Magistrates should push on the Laws to a free Suppression of Immoralities till they Reform themselves and their Great Neighbours Reform themselves that there may be none to Punish who are too big for the Magistrate to venture upon  Would the Gentry of  England  decry the Modishness of Vice by their own Practice would they but dash it ouf of Countenance by disowning it that Drunkenness and Oaths might once come into  difesteem  and be out of Fashion and a Man be valued the less for them that he that will Swear and be Drunk shall be counted a Rake and not fit for a Gentleman's Company This would do more to Reforming the rest of Mankind than all the Punishments the Law can inflict the Evil encreased by Example and must be Suppress'd the the same way If the Gentry were thus Reform'd their Families would be so too No Servant would be Entertain'd no Workman Employed no Shopkeeper would be Traded with by a Gentleman but such as like themselves were sober and honest a Lewd Vicious Drunken Footman must Reform or Starve he would get no Service a Servant once turn'd away for his Intemperance would be Entertain'd by no Body else a Swearing Debauch'd Labourer or Workman must Reform or no Body would Employ him the Drunken Whoring Shopkeeper must grow Sober or lose all his Customers and be undone Interest and Good Manners will reform us of the poorer sort there would be no need of the Stocks or Houses of Correction we should be  Sober of Course because we should be all Beggars else and he that loved the Vice so dearly as to purchase it with the loss of his Trade and Employment would soon grow too Poor for his Vice and be forc'd to leave it by his own Necessities there would be no need of Informers a Vicious Fellow would be presently Notorious he would be the Talk of the Town every one wou'd slight and shun him for fear of being thought like him by being seen in his Company he would Expose himself and would be Punish'd as unpitied as a Thief  So that in short the whole Weight of this Blessed Work of Reformation lies on the Shoulders of the Gentry they are the cause of our Defection which being taken away the Effect would cease of Course Vice would grow Scandalous and all Mankind would be asham'd of it  The Clergy also ought not to count themselves exempted in this matter whose Lives have been and in some places still are so vicious and so loose that 'tis well for  England  we are not subject to be much  Priestriddden  'Tis a strange thing how it should be otherwise than it is with us the poor Commonalty when the Gentry our Pattern and the Clergy our Teachers are as Immoral as we And then to consider the Coherence of the thing  the Parson preaches a thundering Sermon against Drunkenness and the Justice of Peace sets my poor Neighbour in the Stocks and I am like to be much the better for either when I know perhaps that this same Parson and this same Justice were both Drunk together the Night before  It may be true for ought we know that a Wicked Parson may make a good Sermon and the  Spanish  Proverb may be true of the Soul as well as the Body  If the Cure be but wrought let the Devil be the Doctor  but this does not take with the downright ignorant  People in the Country a poor Man gets Drunk in a Country Ale House  Why are you not asham'd to be such a Beast says a good honest Neighbour to him the next day  Asham'd says the Fellow Why should I be asham'd Why there was Sir  John  and Sir  Robert  and the Parson and they were all as Drunk as I And why a Beast Pray I heard Sir  Robert  say That  He that Drinks least  Drinks most like a Beast  A Vicious Parson that preaches well but lives ill may be like an unskilful Horseman who opens a Gate on the wrong side and lets other Folks through but shuts himself out This may be possible but it seems most reasonable to think they are a means by that sort of living to hinder both themselves and others and would the Gentry and Clergy of  England  but look back on the Guilt that really lies on them as Gentlemen by whose Example so great a part of Mankind has been led into and encouraged in the Progress of Vice they would find Matter of very serious reflection  This Article of the Clergy may seem to lie in the Power of their Superiors to rectify and therefore may be something more feasible than the other But the Gentry are  Sui juris  can no way be reduced but by their own voluntary practice We are in  England  exceedingly govern'd by Modes and Customs The Gentry may effectually Suppress Vice would they but put it out of Fashion but to Suppress it by Force seems impossible  The Application of this rough Doctrine is in short both to the Gentry and Clergy  Physicians Heal your selves  if you leave off your Drunkenness and Lewdness first if we do not follow you then set us in the Stocks and send us to the House of Correction and  punish us as you please if you will leave off Whoring first then Brand us in the Foreheads or Transport or Hang us for Fornication or Adultery and you are welcome but to preach against Drunkenness immediately after an Evening's Debauch to Correct a poor Fellow for Swearing with the very Vice in your Mouths these are the unjustest ways in the World and have in themselves no manner of tendency towards the Reformation of Manners which is the true Design of the Law  'Tis acknowledg'd there are in  England  a great many Sober Pious Religious Persons both among the Gentry and Clergy and 'tis hoped such cannot think themselves Libell'd or Injur'd in this  Plea  if there were not Laws would never have been made against those Vices for no men make Laws to punish themselves 'tis design'd to reflect upon none but such as are Guilty and on them no farther than to put them in mind how much the Nation owes its present Degeneracy to their folly and how much it is in their  Power  to Reform it again by their Example that the King may not publish  Proclamations  nor the  Parliament  make Laws to no purpose but that we might live in  England  once more like Christians and like Gentlemen to the Glory of God and the Honour of the present King and Parliament who so publickly have attemped the Great Work of Reformation among us tho' hitherto to so little purpose  AN ENQUIRY INTO THE Occasional Conformity OF DISSENTERS IN  Cases of Preferment  Preface to Mr  HOW  SIR  THese Sheets are address'd to you because the Author with Submission thinks they something more nearly concern you than ordinary  As you are not unjustly esteemed one of the most Learned and Judicious of the Dissenting Ministry And  As you have more immediate Relation to our present LordMayor who is or has been a Member of the Church of Christ under your Charge  The Author has carefully avoided Personal Reflections and hopes he has no where exceeded the Rules of Charity or Good Manners  The Treatise is individually the same which the Author publish'd in the Mayoralty of Sir  Humphry Edwin  the Address by way of Preface being only left out  The Debate was then young and the Practice of this Scandalous Conformity was new Sir  John Shorter  being the first Instance of it But it is now growing a received  Custom to the great Scandal of the Dissenters in general the Offence of such whose Consciences forbid them the same Latitude and the Stumbling of those who being before weak and irresolute are Led aside by the Eminency and Frequency of Examples  Sir  If you knew the Author you would easily be satisfied that the Reason of this Preface is not that he covets to engage in Controversy with a Person of your Capacity and Learning being altogether unfit for such a Task and no way a Match to your Talent that way  But he desires in the Name of himself and a great many honest good Christians who would be glad to see this Case decided That you will by your self or some other Hand as you please declare to the World Whether this Practice of Alternate Communion be allowed either by your Congregation in particular on the Dissenters in general  And if not so allow'd then he conjures you by the Honour you owe to your Profession and the Tenderness you have for the Weakness of others by the regard you have to God's Honour and the Church you serve That such Proceedings may receive their due Censure tho the Persons wear the Gay Cloaths and the Gold Ring that the Sincerity and Purity of Dissenting Protestants may be vindicated to the World both in their Discipline as well as Doctrine and that without Respect of Persons  If on the other hand it be allow'd 'tis desired it may be defended by such Arguments as you think convenient which the Author promises if desir'd never to reply to or if you give him that Liberty shall do it so as you shall easily see is in order only to be inform'd and always suitable to the Respect which is due to your Person for whom none has a greater Esteem  If none of these Requests shall be granted the World must believe  That Dissenters do Allow themselves to Practice what they cannot Defend  Your very Humble Servant D F  A DISCOURSE UPON Occasional Conformity  WHEN I review the Past Times and look back upon the various Scenes which they present us as to Ecclesiastical Transactions within this Kingdom there seems nothing more strange than the Turns we have had from Popish to Regal Supremacy from the  Romish  Religion to Reform'd from Reform'd back again to  Romish  and then to Reformed again and so on thro' several Degrees of Reformation and back again from those Degrees to the first Steps of Reformation and then forward again  King  Henry  the th a Prince of a haughty Spirit disdaining the Insolence with which his Predecessors were treated by the Popes gave the first Shock to the  Roman  Power in these Kingdoms I won't say he acted from any principles of Conscience whatever his Ambition and Interest led him to pretend but  that  was the Gloss as it is in most Cases of Publick Revolutions  However it was  having satisfi'd his Pride by subduing the Suppremacy of the Pope and establishing his own his Interest next guided him to the Suppression of Abbies and Monastries The horrible Vices which were protected as well as practiced in those Nests of Superstition giving his pretence of Piety the larger Scope and I'll for once be so free with the Character of that Prince as to suppose what to me seems plain that  neither This Religion or That were of  much Moment in his Thoughts but his Interest  as the Sequel made plain by the Seizure he made of the Revenues of the Church  And yet the Justice of Providence seems very conspicuous in that point That those Houses who under the specious pretences of Religion and extraordinary Devotion had amassed to themselves vast Revenues to the Impoverishing many Families and in the mean time secretly practiced most unheard of Wickedness should under the same pretence of Zeal and Piety be suppressed and impoverished by a Person who meerly to serve his own Glory triumph'd over them pretending  Jehu  like  to shew his Zeal for the Lord  Some do assure us That the Eyes of this Pince were really open'd as to the Point of Religion and that had he liv'd longer he would most effectually have establish'd the Reformation in his time but God who gave him that light  if he had it  however he might accept his Intention as he did that of  David  's Building his House yet he reserv'd the Glory of the performance to his Son  King  Edward  the th of whom wondrous things are spoken in all our  English  Writers and more than we need suppose should be literally true yet was without doubt a Prince of the strictest Piety not only that ever reign'd but that ever liv'd perhaps since the Days of  Josidh  whose Parallel our Writers say he was  The Reformation began in his hand not but that the Protestant Religion had been received in  England  many years before by the preaching of  John Wickliff William Tindall  and others and had many professors and those such who gallantly offered their Lives in defence of the Truth  But it got but little ground for Religion has but few Votaries while all its professors must also be Confessors and while Exile or Martyrdom is all the prospect of Advantage to be got by it  None will dare to be Dissenters in times of Danger but such whose Consciences are so awaken'd that they dare not be otherwise  But in the hands of this young Prince the great work was begun and in a shorter time than could be imagin'd was finish'd and establish'd the  Romanists  fled or conformed for we find but very few had an Inclination to Martyrdom if it had been put upon them Some indeed to show the Nature of their Religion  Pleaded for  Baal  and Rebell'd  stirring up the Ignorant People to Murther their  Gideon  for throwing down the  Altars of  Baal but like the  Ephramites  of old their  Shiboleth  was their undoing  God who thought fit to discover the Levity of those who had only Conform'd and not Reform'd who  in exemplum Regis  had took up this as they would have done any Religion and also for the Tryal and Glory of his Church suffer'd all this great Fabrick  however of his own Working  to be overthrown at the Death this good King and a Deluge of Cruelty and Popery overwhelm'd the People in the Reign of the Queen his Sister  But  Popery  found more Dissenters than the Reformation had done and the Impression Religion had made on the minds of those who had sincerely Embrac'd it was not so easily Defac'd as the pretended Reformation of others For the Glosses Men had put on their Actions only as a cover from common Observation was soon Discover'd when the Safety of owning their Old principles render'd those Outsides no longer needful but where the True Religion had got footing in the Mind it was still the same whatever alterations of Times might meke it Dangerous  and yet all People did not Burn  but some being persecuted in one City fled to another and  Germany  especially was a Sanctuary for the Distressed  English  Protestants that Country having been before hand with us in the Reformation  'Twas here that our Exil'd Clergy having convers'd with the Learned Reformers abroad and particularly with  John Calvin  found that tho' they were reform'd indeed from the Gross Errors of Popery and Superstition there was yet several things which might be further and further Reform'd and being willing to arrive to the greatest Perfection they were capable of in Religion that as near as possible they might pursue the great Example of Christ Jesus whose Name they profess'd and for whom they cou'd most gloriously die they Corrected in themselves those things which they saw needful and by Letters to their Brethren in  England  communicated their Opinions with their Reasons exhorting them to go on unto perfection as they had begun  Some of the most Zealous for Piety and Holiness of Life rejected this Motion and Others as Zealous and Pious clos'd with it and the Disputes were carried so far sometimes as to Invade the Charity of one another an humble Acknowledgment of which you have in a most Christian Reconciling Letter from Bishop  Ridley  to Bishop  Hooper  two of the most Glorious Triumphant Martyrs that ever confest the truth of Christ at the Stake  For the present the Fire of the Persecution as the Greater Light obscures the Less extinguish'd that of Dissention But when Queen  Elizabeth  rescu'd the Protestant Religion and the Church enjoy'd its Peace again the Debate reviv'd But the first Establishment of King  Edward  obtain'd so on the Minds of Men that the further Reformation was rejected The other Party being not at all convinc'd tho' overrul'd submitted their Persons to the Laws but not their Opinion affirming  "That 'twas the Duty of every Christian to endeavour to serve God with the greatest Purity of Worship as was possible and that this was the purest Worship which came nearest to the Divine Institution which they believ'd the establish'd Liturgy did not and therefore in Conscience they must be Dissenters  It must be own'd That the Original Authors of these Disputes were Learned Devout and singularly Pious strict in Conversation to excess  if that be possible  and from thence in a sort of happy Derision were call'd  Puritans  of whom I shall say nothing but leave for a Record the last Speech of a Famous Foreigner who had seen the way of living among those Dissenters and speaking of the Words of  Balaam Let me Die the Death of the Righteous and let my latter end be like his  cry'd Out  Sit Anima Mea cum Puritanis  Anglicanis  I shall not take upon me to observe the Difference between these Primitive Dissenters and Our Present which is too plain nor to dispute the Substance of the Point in Debate between them and the Establisht National Church  I shall only observe That the Reasons for the present Dissenters Separation from the Establisht Church are said to be exactly the same they were then and the present Dissenters are the Successors of those first as the present Conformists are the Successors of the first Reformers under King  Edward  the Sixth and Queen  Elizabeth  I must acknowledge that it fares with the Church of  England  and with the Dissenters both as it has always far'd with Christ's Church in the whole World That while Supprest and Persecuted their Professors were few and their Profession more severe but when a Religion comes to be the Mode of the Country so many painted Hypocrites get into the Church who are not by their Voices to be distinguish'd that Guile is not to be seen till it arrive to Apostacy The whole Ecclesiastical History from the first Century of the Christian Church is full of Instances to confirm this That the Prosperity of the Church of  Christ has been more fatal to it than all the Pesecution of its Enemies  I am now brought down to the present Time when the  Dissenting Protestant  is sheltered by the Laws and protected from the Violence which he suffered in the Late Reigns under the Arbitrary Commands of such State Ministers who strove to dash the whole Protestant Interest to pieces by its own weight and nothing is more apparent to those who are any thing acquainted with the late Management of Affairs in this Land than that the Court used both Parties alternately as Policy and Occasion directed to Suppress and Destroy one another that the whole House  which being so divided cou'd not stand  might at last fall of it self  But our Eyes are at last opened the Name of Protestant is now the common Title of an  Englishman  the Church of  England  extends her Protection to the tender Consciences of her Weaker Brethren knowing that all may be Christians tho' not alike inform'd and the Dissenter extends his Charity to the Church of  England  believing that in his due time  God shall reveal even this unto them  If this is not I wish this were the Temper of both Parties and I am sure it is already the Temper of some of each Side which few are of the Wisest most Pious and most Judicious  But while Frailty and Infirmity are Essential to Humanity and Pride and Hypocrisy are the two Regnant Vices of the Church this good Spirit cannot be Universal and we do not expect it  But there is a sort of Truth which all Men owe to the Principles they profess and generally speaking all Men pay it a  Turk  is a  Turk  zealously and entirely an  Idolater  is an  Idolater  and will  serve the Devil to a tittle  None but Protestants halt between  God and Baal  Christians of an Amphibious Nature who  have such preposterous Consciences as can believe one Way of Worship to be right and yet serve God another way themselves  This is a strange thing in Israel  All the Histories of Religion in the World do not shew such a Case 'Tis like a Ship with her Sails hal'd some back and some full 'Tis like a Workman that Builds with one Hand and pulls down with t'other 'Tis like a Fisherman who catches Fish with one Hand and throws them into the Sea with another 'Tis like every thing which signifies nothing To say a Man can be of two Religions is a Contradiction unless there be two Gods to Worship or he has two Souls to saue  Religion is the sacred Profession of the Name of God  serving him believing in him expecting from him  and like the God it refers to 'tis in one and the same Object one and the same thing perfectly indivisible and inseparable there is in it no Neuter Gender no Ambiguous Article  God or Baal  Mediums are impossible  As to the different Modes and Ways which are the Circumstantials of this Sacred Thing I call Religion I won't say but that as Ships take different Courses at Sea yet to the best of their Skill keeping to the direct Rules of Navigating by the Compass they may arrive at the same Port so Christians taking different Methods in the serving this God yet going to the best of their Judgments by the direct Rules of the Scripture may arrive at the same Heaven  but this is nothing at all to the Case  for no Ship would arrive at any Port that sailed two ways together  if that were possible  nor no man can serve One God and at the same time hold two Opinions There is but one Best and he that gives God  two Bests  gives him the Best and the Worst and one Spoils t'other till both are good for nothing  I have said already that both the Church of  England  and the Dissenter suffer in their Reputation  for the mixt Multitudes of their Members which is occasion'd by their present Prosperity If a Third Party were to tyrannize over them both we should see then who were  Professors  and who were  Confessors  but now it cannot be Wherefore I think 'twere well to put both Sides in mind of one thing which they are bound mutually to observe and that is That  the Personal Miscarriages of any particular Person or Member is not really any Reflection upon the Religion they profess  nor ought not to be so accounted unless it be where such Miscarriages are the direct Dictates of the Doctrines they teach and thus I would be understood in the present Case Wherefore I shall give my Essay as to what I understand a Real Dissenting  Protestant  is or ought to be  He who Dissents from an Establish'd Church on any account but from a real Principle of Conscience is a Politick not a Religious Dissenter  To explain my self He who Dissents from any other Reasons but such as these That he firmly believes the said Established Church is not of the purest Institution but that he can really serve God more agreeable to his Will and that accordingly 'tis his Duty to do it so  and no otherwise  Nay he that cannot Dye or at least desire to do so rather than Conform  ought to Conform Schism  from the Church of Christ is doubtless a great Sin and if I can avoid it I ought to avoid it but if not the Cause of that Sin carries the Guilt with it  But if I shall thus Dissent and yet at the same time Conform by Conforming I deny my Dissent being lawful or by my Dissenting I damn my Conforming as sinful  Nothing can be lawful and unlawful at the same time if it be not lawful for me to Dissent I ought to Conform but if it be unlawful for me to Conform I must Dissent several Opinions may at the same  time consist in a Country in a City in a Family but not in one entire Person  that is impossible  To come to the point there are Dissenters who are separated from the Church of  England  and join'd in Communion with Dissenting Churches or Congregations They have appear'd Zealous Conscientious and Constant have born the Reproaches and Inconveniences of their Party nay suffer'd Persecution and Loss of Estates and Liberty for the Cause And who could have so little Charity as to doubt the Sincerity of their Profession And yet these Persecuted Suffering Dissenters to make themselves room in the Publick Advancements and Glittering Gawdy Honours of the Age shall Conform to that which they refus'd under all those Disadvantages to do before And which is worse than all this hear O Heavens as soon as the present Honour is attain'd the present Advantage made they return to the former Circumstances again and are freely receiv'd  a double Crime  as having done no Evil  I know not I profess what these Persons can say for themselves and therefore cannot pretend to Answer their Objections but I cannot omit one Answer which some People give for them  viz That this is no Conformity in Point of Religion but done as a Civil Action  in Obedience to the Laws of the Land which have made it a necessary Characteristick Quality for admittance into publick Employments which they think it their Duty to accept in order to serve their Country which they doubly perform by Executing those Offices to the publick Interest and by excluding those who would otherwise get into those places and betray their Country and their Liberties  I have never met with any considerable Excuse made for this fast and loose Game of Religion but this and this I desire to consider a little particularly    That this is no Conformity in Point of Religion but done  as a Civil Action  How this can be possible remains to be determined 'Tis true the Morality of an Action consists in its End but I cannot conceive that an Action purely and originally Religious such as the Solemn Ordinances of God's Worship can be made Civil Actions by any End Design Will or Intention of Man whatsoever 'Tis true an Oath which is a calling God to witness is an Action both Civil and Religious but still that was appointed and instituted to that end as is expresly noted  Heb Naaman  's bowing in the House of  Rimmon  to which the Prophet answered  Go in Peace  which is understood as a permission is a thing still different for  Naaman  only bowed for the Conveniency or State of the King at the same time publickly disowning the Worship as  Interpreters are of Opinion  besides bowing the Head tho' it may be a customary Act of Worship at that place yet is no Act confin'd to Worship only and instituted and directed so by the God who is Worshipped but is an Act us'd in Common Salutations Thus we kneel to God and to the King but Sacraments are things appropriated by the Divine Institution of God himself as things which have no other Signification or Import but what is Divine Had  Naaman  desir'd to be excused in offering Sacrifices to the Idol  Rimmon  the Prophet would hardly have bid him go in peace Some Actions are not Civil or Religious as they are Civilly or Religiously perform'd but as they are Civil or Religious in themselves for some Religious Actions are so entirely such that they cannot without a horrid invasion of the Soveraignty of the Institutor be appropriated to any other use and such are in especial manner the Two Sacraments instituted by Christ such was before Christ the Sacrifices by Fire And the Judgments of God on  Nadab  and  Ahihu  for attempting to offer Sacrifice with strange Fire stands as a terrible  Instance of what we ought to think is the Will of God in this matter  Further speaking directly of the Sacraments Are they not the same thing tho' differently Administred in the establish'd Church or in a dissenting Church and how can you take it as a Civil Act in one place and a Religious Act in another This is  playingBopeep  with God Almighty and no Man can tell of them when they are about a Civil Action and when about a Religious But to answer this pretence at once Sacraments as Sacraments are Religious Acts and can be no other if you do not take it as a Sacrament the Case differs but how can you say you do not take it as a Sacrament An Oath is to be taken in the Sense of the Imposer and a Sacrament which is a Recognition of the most Sacred of Oaths must be also taken in the Sense of the Imposer If the Person Administring declar'd at the Administration  He did not give it as a Sacrament but only give you a bit of Bread and Draught of Wine as a Friend  or the like this was something but can a Minister deliver the Bread to you and say  The Body of our Lord Jesus Christ  c and you Kneeling with Reverence take it as such and repeat the Responses at the Communion and say  Amen  to the Prayer and say 'tis a Civil Action This is such Bantering with Religion as no Modest Christian can think of without Horror  Another part of the Apology is That without it they cannot be admitted into Publick places of Trust and if they were not admitted such will get in as will betray their Country and Liberties and they do it purely to secure their Country which they think their Duty  These are Patriots indeed that  will  damn their Souls to save their Countrey  a sort of a Publick Spirit hardly to be found in the World and indeed a Nonentity in it self for 'tis a Mistake the Gentlemen who make  this Answer put the case wrong For I would desire such to Answer a few Questions ear  If the Service of their Country be so d  e to them pray why should they not chuse to expo their Bodies and Estates for that Service rather than their Souls  The Penalty of the Law in accepting the Publick Employments is wholly Pecuniary the difference lies here  they chuse the Trespassing on their Consciences before the hazard of their Estates  as the least Evil for 'tis plain any Man who will suffer the Penalty or run the Risque of it which is all one may excuse the conformity for the Lord does not say you shall so and so Conform but if you do not Conform you shall incur such and such Penalties any Man that will incur the Penalty may commit the Trespass  So that all this Compliance is not To be admitted to Places that they may be able to serve their Country but to save the Five hundred pounds and other Penalties of that Act  Why if we believe the Power of God to be Omnipotent should we imagine that he is not able to protect our Country and Liberties without our perpetrating so wicked an Act to secure them  as doing Evil that Good may come  which is expresly forbidden  But we are told again This is in it self no Sinful Act and therefore it is not doing Evil This is tacitly answered before tho' 'tis not a Sinful Act in it self  Yet 'tis either a Sinful Act in a Dissenter or else his Dissenting before was a Sinful Act  For if he is satisfied he does well in Conforming now why did he not before There is but one Answer for that which is He is otherwise convinced to which I reply If that were true he would then as a Convert continue in this New Communion but 'tis evident the same Persons return immediately to the former Profession as  Dissenters and they can have no such Excuse unless it be that they were convinc'd and reconvinc'd and then convinc'd again  Some have the Folly to argue against the Law it self as a most Notorious Imposition upon the Consciences of Man by making the Sacred Institutions of Christ a Drudge to Secular  Interest  and a Cause of mens Sins by leading them into Tempation I could say enough to vindicate that part tho I am no more reconcil'd to that Law than other Men but 'tis remote to our Argumnet 'Tis an Act of Parliament and what is so is of every Man's own doing and therefore 'tis just every one shou'd comply with the Terms or suffer the Penalty but here is no  Penalty  if no Crime  if no Preferments are sought no Honours accepted there is no Crime  if Self denial was as practicable as Self advancement here is no need of the  Crime  So that they who do this  seek the Crime that is the first Sin then Morgage their Consciences to avoid the Penalty  and so add one Sin to another But we are told by some 'tis not against their  Consciences  they hope both  Parties  are Good  Christians  there are differences between them which they don't understand nor meddle with and their Consciences are very well satisfied to Communicate with either  I would ask such if their Consciences would serve to Communicate with the Church why did they Separate For Communicating with the  Dissenter  is not an Occasional or Casual thing but an open declar'd breaking off from the  Church  Establisht Now no Man can be said to separate from and joyn to a thing at the same time if your  Conscience  is satisfied in Joyning it cannot be satisfied in Separating unless you can suppose your Conscience to be satisfied and dissatisfied both together If you have a Conscience of any Religion at all it must be of some Religion or other if of this it cannot be of that if of  sent and Approve are different Acts and can never be fixt upon the same Object at the same time as for a Man Passively Religious that can Communicate any where that Man may from the same Principle and with far less Guilt Communicate no where for such a Man in downright  English  has Prostituted the little Religion he had  if ever he had any  to his Interest and may be  Turk Jew Papist  or any thing  The latter part of the Charge leads me to consider another Point which relates to the Assemblies of the Dissenters who admit and by consequence approve this way of proceeding I do not pretend to examine by what Methods such particular Churches do procced And I would be as tender as possible in making Reflections I wish they would be as Charitable in censuring this Reproof  I do think with Submission 'tis impossible to prove that any Person whose Case the foregoing Paragraph reaches can be receiv'd again into ChurchCommunion in a Dissenting Assembly upon any other Terms  than as a Penitent  I have heard of some who have been said to have leave from their Ministers for this Matter  if so  they have assum'd some  Dispensing Authority  which I believe does not appertain to the Ministerial Function nor is not contain'd in the Mission of our Saviour But I do not affirm That any such thing has been really allow'd  As to the Relation of Churches and the Members thereof one to another as the Dissenters now Establish'd them I am sure the allowance of any Member in a Promiscuous Communion with the Church of  England  and the Dissenter at the same time is not pretended to be allow'd nor is it consistent with it self 'Tis Preposterous and Excentrick and is Destructive of the very Foundation of the Dissenters Principles as is already noted concerning Schisms in the Church In this Case Charity can heal nothing nor help nothing  'tis of absolute necessity that one Man be but of one side at one and the same time Either the Conformist will mar the Dissenter or the Dissenter will mar the Conformist For if I shall be admitted into the Communion of the Dissenter and of the Church together then the Dissenter must have some other Reason for being a Dissenter than Purity of Worship  Methinks Men should seem what they are if a Man Dissent from the Church let him do so and his Principle being well grounded for such Dissent let him hold it if not wellgrounded let him leave it if he cannot suffer one way let him suffer another and why should we not be as honest to God as our Country  The Motives to serve our Country are strong but there are ways to do it without such a Violation of all our Principles and Profession if not trust God's Providence with the Issue who never wants Agents to preserve and deliver his People when his time is at hand and you can have small hope to expect that the Office and Trust you shall Execute shall receive any Assistance from his Providence when the first Step into it is made by offering the greatest Affront to his Honour and committing the vilest Act of Perfidy in the World  But if the gay Prospect of a great Place tempt any Person beyond the Power that God's Grace is pleas'd to assist them with  in that way let him abide  and not be readmitted because of his Gold Ring and Fine Apparel without a Penitent Acknowledgement The Dissenters in  England  can never pretend to be Dissenters upon the mere Principle of Purity of Worship as I have related in the beginning of this Discourse if such shall be receiv'd as blameless into their Communion who have deserted them upon the occasion of Preferment and have made the Sacred Institutions of Christ Jesus become Pimps to their Secular Interest  and then wipe their Mouths and sit down in the Church and say  They have done no Evil  'Tis also an Intolerable Affront to the Church of  England  reflecting upon its Doctrine as well as Practice to make use of the Church for a  Cover  to fence them against the Laws at the same time continuing to disown its Communion as a thing not fit to be continued in  And yet the Church of  England  is in the right to receive such of the Dissenters as shall come to them without the Ceremony of Recognition because it is agreeable to the Notion of a National Church which they profess to be But Dissenters are bound to justifie their Separation from them or else their whole Constitution falls to the Ground Now how a Separation and a Conformity are Consistent is to me an Inexplicable Riddle  I question not here the Lawfulness of the Dissenters Separation it is not the business of this Discourse to define it and I am as careful as I can in making Reflections upon either but I am bold to affirm That no Dissenting Church can with lawful Cause Separate from the Church of  England  Establish Private Churches or Communions and at the same times allow the Members to Conform to the Establish'd Church too This is incongruous and one must destroy the other From whence I think it becomes the Dissenters if they would maintain the Doctrine they teach if they would have us believe they Dissent purely on the honest Principles of Conscience and Purity of Worship with such a one  No not to Eat  And it is not sufficient that the Offender a Lord Mayor or any greater Person unless he would be Lord Mayor without a Breach of the Sacred Relation he had entred into he should be dealt with in that Case as the meanest Member of such a Society  On the other hand if a Man be call'd upon to be a  Magistrate and has Courage enough to follow the Impartial Dictates of his Conscience a Query lies before him What shall he do  The Case is plain  Either refuse the Honour or run the Risque  The first indeed is the plainest and easiest Way and the Ground of it is good for he whose Concience Dictates to him that the Terms are Sinful may refuse the Call for Preferments and Honours are a Bait that some have refused on meer Points of Speculative Philosophy and 'tis hard Christianity shou'd not carry a Man as far Well but  perhaps a Man has a mind to be a Sheriff or a Lord Mayor  and is a Dissenter or perhaps he really thinks 'tis his Indispensable Duty to serve his Country if he is call'd to that or the like Office or perhaps he thinks 'tis a Duty he owes his Family to advance his Children and the like and he is a Profest Dissenter What shall he do Let him boldly run the Risque or openly and honestly Conform to the Church and neither be asham'd of his Honour nor of his Profession such a Man all Men will Value and God will own He need not fear carying the Sword to a Conventicle or bringing the Conventicle to his own House But to make the matter a Game to dodge Religions and go in the Morning to Church and in the Afternoon to the Meeting to Communicate in private with the Church of  England  to save a Penalty and then go back to the Dissenters and Communicate again there This is such a Retrograde Devotion that I can see no colour of pretence for in all the Sacred Book  I have heard indeed that some who are Ministers of Dissenting Churches do or did at the same time Communicate with the Church of  England  I do not dispute how far a Minister may Conform as a Layman tho' he cannot as a Clergyman but how any Dissenting Minister can Conform as a Layman and at the same time execute a Pastoral Charge over a  Congregation whom he teaches to Separate from the Church in a LayCommunion I cannot imagine  'Tis not as I have already noted Conformity or Nonconformity at the same time in one and the same Person  that is the Point  and doing this for a Secular End to save a Penalty and privately and then as being asham'd of it to go back and sit down as not having done it at all and a ChurchSociety admitting this without taking notice of it these are the Contradictions I must upon and rather wish than expect to see rectified  AN ENQUIRY INTO Occasional Conformity Shewing that the DISSENTERS Are no Way Concern'd in it  HE that Opposes his own Judgment against the Current of the Times ought to be back'd with unanswerable Truths and he that has that Truth on his Side is a Fool as well as a Coward if he is afraid to own it because of the Currency or Multitude of other Mens Opinions  'Tis hard for a Man to say all the World is mistaken but himself but if it be so who can help it  But since 'tis not likely a Single Vote shou'd prevail upon Espous'd Errors in an Age when every one is so fond of themselves he that starts Truth by himself must expect the World will stand still and look on till they see the Issue  The Act depending in the House of Commons about Occasional Conformity has set abundance of Heads to Work in the World and be the House in the Right or in the Wrong I know my own Business and their Temper too well to meddle with it But I pretend to say that all Men I have met with who have meddled with the Argument either in Print or otherwise are manifestly Mistaken  With more Humility therefore than I owe to any Man I ask leave not to be Censur'd till I am Heard and those who call me Arrogant before reprove me with more Arrogance than is their share among their Fellow Creatures  But since I  who was altogether Born in Sin  have undertaken to teach my Superiors I desire to explain my self before they cast me out of the Synagogue  For as that Blind Man thought 'twas a Marvellous thing they should not know whence he came that had opened his Eyes  So to me 'tis every jot as wonderful to find no Body of my Mind and yet be Positively assured that I am in the Right  The Subject I am upon needs no Introduction the History is in every Mans Knowledge the Parliament are upon a Bill to prevent Occasional Conformity and about that Bill the Press swarms with Pamphlets the Pulpit sounds with Exaltations on one Hand and Deprecations on the other every one speak their Opinions some their Hopes some their Fears and so it shou'd have been to the end of the Chapter if I cou'd  have found but one middle Sort that free from Prejudice of Parties cou'd have discern'd the Native State of the Case as it really is discover'd from the Passions and Follies of Men  About their Act of Parliament I affirm most of the People I have met with are Mistaken and that I may be as Explicit as I can I shall enquire more particularly who are mistaken how and then I doubt not the Sequel of this Paper shall make it appear that the Fact is true  First  All those People who design'd the Act as a Blow to the Dissenting Interest in  England  are mistaken  Secondly  All those who take it as a Prelude or Introduction to the further Suppressing of the Dissenters and a Step to Repealing the Toleration or intend it as such are Mistaken  Thirdly  All those who think the Dissenters at all concern'd in it or have design'd to Mortifie them by it are Mistaken  Fourthly  All those HotSpurs of Divinity who Prophesie Destruction from the Pulpit and from this Step pretend to foretel that the time of Plund'ring their Brethren is at Hand are Mistaken  Fifthly  All those Flegmatick Dissenters who fancy themselves undone and that Persecution and Desolation is at the Door again are Mistaken  Sixthly  All those Dissenters who are really at all Disturb'd at it either as an Advantage gain'd by their Enemies or as a real Disaster upon themselves are Mistaken  Seventhly  All those Dissenters who Deprecate it as a Judgment or wou'd Vote against it if it were in their Power are Mistaken  Eighthly  That all those who begun or promoted this Bill with a Design to Ruin Weaken and Destroy the Interest or Body of the Dissenters in  England  are Mistaken  Not that I hereby suppose the Parliament or the Persons Originally concern'd in moving this Bill did it in meer Kindness to the Dissenters in order to Refine and Purge them from the Scandals which some People had brought upon them that 'twas an Action of Christian Charity to the Dissenters to Prevent and Detect Frauds and Hypocrisie in Religion and to clear their Reputation  I never yet saw or read of a Division of Parties in any Nation but the Hot Heads of both Parties were always for Enflaming the Reckoning if the Hot Men of the Dissenters have done any Mischief I am sorry for it but let us Examine a little what other Hot Men wou'd be now a doing  No sooner was Queen  Ann  settl'd upon the Throne of  England  and had declar'd that the Church of  England  shou'd be the Men of Her Favour as being the Church She had been Educated in and ever constant to but these Hot Men fly out upon their Brethren with all the Excesses of their furious Temper  Nothing wou'd serve them but this Queen and Parliament must Root and Branch blast the Dissenters with their Breath blow up their Interest in the Nation and we shou'd be all one Church and one People of a sudden 'twas to be done with a Blow all at once and so certainly that no possible Doubt could be made of it  But Her Majesty was pleas'd to let these People know from Her own Mouth that for as much as concerned Her they were Mistaken in that upon the Address of the Dissenters to Her She gave them Her Royal Word for Her Protection and whenever She breaks it we shall all be Mistaken  Upon this the Pulpit that Drum Ecclesiastick began the War and Mr  Sachavrell  in his Sermon at  Oxford  Dooms all the Dissenters to Destruction without either Bell Book or Candle not regarding common  Decency not respecting his good Manners to the Queen nor his Deference to the Parliament but tells them 'tis their Duty if they will be true Members of the Church of  England  to lift up a Standard against the Phanaticks and the like as much as to say  Madam whatever your Majesty has promis'd You must break Your Word  and  Gentlemen of the House of Commons we will have you do it  Now all these Gentlemen have liv'd to see themselves Mistaken and if they retain any Expectations of seeing it fulfill'd they must exercise their Faith upon it as a thing  in Futuro  and believe that some time or other Her Majesty will break her Word but as yet there is no great Probability for hitherto we have seen we are all mistaken  But to revive their Expectations comes a Bill into the House for preventing Occasional Conformity this has been matter of great Triumph to some Gentlemen who upon this Act revive their common Discourse and are pleas'd to treat the Dissenters in this manner  Well Gentlemen now down you go the Parliament are a beginning with you and they don't use to do Business by halves they have taken the Insulted Church into Consideration they will reduce you and this is the first Step you shall soon see some more on't We have got a Church Parliament now and down ye go this Bill will effectually Ruin your Interest and bring all your Great Men off from you  This brings us close to the Point and 'tis no small matter for any one to show these Gentlemen how they are mistaken  First  'Tis time for these Gentlemen to tell us what the Parliament will do when they either know it or the House has declar'd their Intentions and till they have 'tis a Presumption some Houses would have taken Notice of for any People to pretend to lead them to their Business and therefore when they tell us this  is a Taste of the rest they are preparing for us I must say either they are too well acquainted with the Mind of the House or they are all Mistaken and as to the Blow this Bill is to the Dissenters Interest in  England  As far as I may be allow'd to give my Judgement and as the Nature of the Thing seems to speak its self 'tis plain this Bill is no Damage at all to the Dissenters in  England  and we hope the House did not intend it as such  I cannot imagine that so great a Spirit of Enmity and contempt can be entertain'd in the Breast of a Nation against their Neighbours their Brethren People Born in the same Climate submitting to the same Government professing the same God and in most Fundamental Points of Religion agreeing People link'd together in the same common Interest by intermarriages continually mixt in Relation concern'd in the same Trade making War with the same Enemies and Allied with the same Friends were it not that these People call'd Dissenters are represented to them under some strange and untrue Character or that under the Name of Dissenter some ill Persons are shrowded and disguis'd who deserve to be thus Treated  Wherefore in order to set the Dissenters Right in the Eyes of their Brethren and that they may have common Justice at least if they can have nothing of Courtesie that Peace may be where there is no Occasion for War and Quietness and good Manners preserved 'twill be needful to set the Matter in a true Light and examine who this Dissenter is what the People Dissenters are and what they have done for which they are Treated after so infamous a Manner by Scurrilous Preachers and Scandalous Pamphleteers and other ignorant People not a few  The Dissenter is an  Englishman  that being something  desirous of going to Heaven having heard his Church of  England  Father and Schoolmaster and the Minister of the Parish talk much of it begins seriously to enquire about the Way thither and to that Purpose consulting his Bible and his Conscience he finds that in his Opinion there are some Things in the Establish'd Way of Worship which do not seem to correspond with the Rule he has found out in the Scripture  Now I shall not examine here whether the Man thus scrupulous be in the Right or whether the Church be in the Right it does not at all belong to the Case in Hand  But the Man being fully convinc'd that he ought to Worship God in that Way exclusive of all others which is most agreeable to the Will of God reveal'd in the Scripture and being on mature Consideration also and after sincere Endeavours to be otherwise satisfied fully convinc'd that this Establish'd Way is not so near to that Rule as it ought to be ventures the Displeasure of the Civil Magistrate in Dissenting in pure Obedience to the Commands of his Conscience and of that Rule which bids him obey God rather than Man firmly believing that 'tis his Duty so to do and that the Compass and Extent of Humane Laws do not reach to bind him in Matters of Conscience at the same time living in Charity with all the rest of the World whose Consciences do not require the same Restriction and Peaceably submitting to the Laws and Government he lives under as far as either his Right as an  Englishman  or his Duty as a Christian can require  This is the  English  Protestant Dissenter which I have been speaking of and concerning whom I have ventur'd to say so many Men  so much Wiser than I  are Mistaken  If there are crept into his Company State Dissenters  Politick Dissenters or any that give no Reason or other or less Reasons for their Dissenting than these they are not of them and we wish they would go out from them  I see no Act of Parliament a making to the Prejudice of this Dissenter and let Hot Men Preach Print and Say what they please it is impossible it shou'd ever enter into the Breast of an  English  Protestant Parliament or an  English  Protestant Queen either to Oppress or Suppress such a Dissenter  'Tis for the Protection of this Honest Wellmeaning Dissenter that in the late Reign the King and Parliament finding their Number Great thought it was Meet for the Quiet of the Nation and as an Acknowledgement of the Superiority of Conscience to all Humane Laws to Settle their Liberty in an Act of Parliament the same undisputed Authority on which all our Civil as well as Religious Rights are Established  This is the Dissenter to which Her Majesty has promised Her Protection and this Act of Parliament is the Toleration to Tender Consciences for which Her Majesty openly declar'd Her Self even to the Hazard of Her Royal Person  These are the Dissenters who never gave Her Majesty any Reason to believe they did not Merit Her Protection and I firmly believe never will  From these the Church of  England  has nothing to fear unless their Exemplary Lives and Unquestion'd Piety shou'd prevail to weaken Her Numbers and we heartily wish all the Strife were reduc'd to this  viz  who shou'd Live best and who shou'd Preach best  If there are among them Vicious Youths or Grown Hypocrites if there are crept in Errors Heresies and Enthusiasts are not the same among the Church If there are among these Dissenters  Quakers Antinomians SweetSingers Muggletonians  and the like the  Church has also Her  Socinians Deists AntiTrinitarians Scepticks Asgilites  and the like there can be no Advantage pleaded against Heresie and Damnable Heterodox Opinions from one side more than another  If we regard the Matters of State the Dissenters and the Church of  England  have small Advantage of the Argument one against another and I may without Arrogance Challenge the Hot ChurchMen who can Treat them with nothing but the Odious Name of Disturbers of the Peace Enemies of Monarchy and Authors of Confusion to bring the Loyalty of the Church of  England  so much boasted of in the World to the Test with the Loyalty of the Dissenter  New Test of the Church of  England  's Loyalty  P  and as it has lately been done to my Hand it is easie to prove that the Dissenter has been equally Loyal to Princes equally True to the Government and Constitution of  England  as the Church and the Church has been equally Disloyal and has as often Resisted and took Arms against the Lawful Establish'd Power and Prince as the Dissenter and let them enter into this Dispute whenever they please  But what is all this to the present Case What we do as  Englishmen  is one thing and what we do as Christians and Dissenters is another  'Tis also Foreign to our Purpose to Examine or Reply to Dr  Stubbs  or the Multitude of Pamphleteers who place themselves at the forelorn Hope of the Church and begin the War in hopes of drawing on that whole Body to an Engagement when they can make it out that the Dissenter and the Church are as far asunder in Religion as God and  Baal  I may possibly think they Merit what they so much Covet  viz  to be Reply'd to  Whole Reams of Paper are spoil'd since that to prove that this Act of Parliament is needful because 'tis fit the Church should be Establish'd to which I  Answer with a Question ask'd once with much less Reason in another Case  What need all this Waste  Gentlemen Establish your Church with all the Precaution you can Build a Fence of Impregnable Laws about it you are welcome we never did nor we do not now Disturb you leave but us your Poor Brethren Liberty to serve God according to our Consciences don't bind us to do as you can do whether we can or no take your Places and Pensions and Profits and deserve them of the Nation if you can we ask nothing but our Right and what is now become so by Law if you claim the Civil Power as yo  own you consequently take us into your Protection▪ and let us see how Generous you'll be  As to those among us who can conform to yo  Church for a Place for a Salary you are also Welcome to take them among you and let them be a pa  of your selves all the Converts you can make by th  Mammon of Unrighteousness are your own all yo  can Buy off or Bribe off or Fright off  let 'em go  w  readily Grant that whoever among us can with Sati  faction to his Conscience Conform ought to Confor  and we heartily Wish you would make some smal  Steps by way of Condescention to your Brethre  such as might open a Door for us all to Conform t  you and then you shou'd Dissent from Principles o  Obstinacy and IllNature or from a meer Necessity of Conscience you should then see whether the Dissenters in  England  were Schismaticks by Nature and Heterdox by Inclination or whether their Objectio  are grounded upon Scripture and their Dissenting from you an Act of an enlightned Conscience yo  wou'd then try the Spirits whether they be of God  But since you are of the Opinion that you are capable of no Amendment that you cannot Reform farther and therefore will not Condescend one Step tho' 'twould bring over Half a Million of Souls to you▪  an Eminent Instance of the Charity of your Church  all we have to say in the Case is let us have the Protection of the Government and the Liberty the Laws allow us and we are Content  Upon this Score 'tis that we say the Act against Occasional Conformity does not concern us they who can Conform for One Reason may conform without Two and ought to Conform and we are therefore content to be distinguish'd who cannot Conform at all and if we might offer so boldly to you who have any Interest in the  House of Commons  we would humbly propose to have the Title of the Act alter'd and to have it Entituled  An Act for the better Ʋniting the Protestant Dissenters by preventing Occasional Conformity to the Church of  England and when that is done let it pass with all our Hearts and tho' we can easily see what the Design is  viz  That no Dissenter shall be employ'd in Place of Trust or Profit in the Government yet since it must be so  We hope Gentlemen you will be content to take all the Miscarriages of the Government on you too  we shall acquiesce let us alone in our Religion let us Worship God as we believe he has directed us and all the rest is your own  But before we part let us have leave to remind you  hat although you are willing to quit all our Civil Right to the Honours as well as the Advantages of serving our Country when we are chosen to it by a fair Majority rather than not enjoy our Religion and  he Profession we make with Peace and Liberty yet  t is no less an Oppression upon us and the Hardships  re such as can never be defended by Reason or Equi  y  We would be glad we had no Cause to think our selves Injur'd and to such of the Church of  England  who can judge without Prejudice we would Appeal whether it is not very Hard  First  That the Dissenter shall be excluded from all  Places of Profit Trust and Honour and at the same time shall not be excused from those which are attended with Charge Trouble and Loss of his Time  Secondly  That a Dissenter shall be Press'd as a Sailor to Fight at Sea Listed as a Soldier to Fight on Shore and let his Merit be never so much above his Fellows shall never be capable of Preferment no not a Lieutenant at Sea or so much as a Halbert in the Army  Thirdly  That we must maintain our own Clergy and your Clergy our own Poor and your Poor pay equal Taxes and equal Duties and not be thought worthy to be Trusted to set a Drunkard in the Stocks  We wonder Gentlemen you will accept our Money on your Deficient Funds our Stocks to help carry on your Wars our Loans and Credits to your Victualling Office and Navy Office  If you would go on to distinguish us get a Law made we shall Buy no Lands that we may not be Freeholders and see if you could find Money to Buy us out  Transplant us into Towns and Bodies and let us Trade by our selves let us Card Spin Knit and Work with and for one another and see how you will maintain your own Poor without us  Let us Fraight our Ships apart keep our Money out of your Bank accept none of our Bills and seperate your selves as absolutely from us in Civil Matters as we do from you in Religious and see how you can go on without us  If you are not willing to do this but we must live among you Trade Work Receive and Pay together why may we not do it in Peace with Love and Unity without daily Reproach If we have any Knaves among us take them if we have any Hypocrites any who can Conform and do not we are free to part with them that the Remainder may be all such as  agree with the Character here given and when you have Garbl'd us to your Hearts desire and ours you need never fear your Church as to her Politick Interest in the World Pray then let us be quiet  What have we to do with your Distinctions of Whig and Tory No farther that I know of than this that when distinct from our Religious Concerns we come to talk of our Liberties Properties and  English  Priviledges we are not for having them destroy'd by Absolute Authority Dispensing Power and the like and if this be to be Whigs ye are Whigs  As to Kings and Rulers we are of the Opinion that when they Degenerate into Tyrants Oppress their People Destroy the Laws with all the  et caetera  's of Arbitrary Power 'tis Lawful for the Injur'd People to Reduce them to Reason and to seek Protection and Powerful Help from any Body to Assist them to Recover their Undoubted Rights and Liberties if this be to be Traitors why then Gentlemen of the Church of  England  hold up your Hands how say you Are you Guilty or not Guilty  As to Oaths  with which Gentlemen ye were the Men that loaded your Allegiance farther than you had any Occasion  we are of the Opinion that they can bind the Subject no longer than the Soveraign continues the Protection of the Executive Power and that the late King by his Deserting the Throne Absolv'd all his Subjects from the Bond of their Allegiance and on this Foot we made no Scruple to Swear to the Government as it now stands on the Foot of the late Revolution and if you have Sworn with us and yet do not believe so you may get off of the Perjury if you can  And what need is there now of running down the Dissenters with a full Cry as if this Act a coming out was a Machine to blow them all up we see no Harm in it at all other than the Hardships we mention'd before most of which we suffer'd before and are like  only to have them the faster entail'd on our Posterity  All those Gentlemen therefore who think this Act will weaken the Dissenters or wish it would are manifestly Mistaken it may distinguish them better and I am perswaded will fortifie them in their Honest Profession 'twill teach them that if they will hold fast the Truth they must learn to live like People under the Power of those who hate them and despitefully use them  The Dissenters too are strangely Mistaken in their Apprehensions of the Ill Consequences of this Act  To such I wou'd say I cannot imagine what they have to fear from it or why they shou'd be uneasie with the Honour they are also rid of the Encumbrance of being Mayors Aldermen Jurats and Sheriffs of the Towns and Corporations and let them but reflect what was the Gain that all the Dissenters in  England  have made by Places and Pensions from the Government since the late Revolution I am perswaded 'twill not all amount to the Sum that one Churchman will be found to have Cheated the Nation of  The Church are willing to engross all the Knaves to themselves and let them do it and welcome tho' they get all the Money into the Bargain if they would but come to a fair Account with us now and repay all the Dissenters Money the Nation has been Cheated of by Church Knaves I dare undertake the Dissenters shall repay all that can be charg'd on their Knaves out of the Ballance  The Foundation of the Dissenters Safety is lodg'd by God's Especial Providence in the Queen's Veracity while Her Majesty esteems Her Word Sacred as She has assur'd us She will we have no Occasion to be concern'd at all  The Safety of the Dissenters consist in their own Honesty and Integrity while they do nothing to offend  either Her Majesty or the Laws if it were possible to have a Parliament of Church Bigots or of Pulpit  Sachaverells  there will be no Fear of their Liberty  As to the present Act I doubt not but they will live to see Cause to be thankful for the making it when the Miscarriages of all People in Publick Offices and Employments are so eminently fix'd upon a Party and so openly and fairly taken off from them  They are Mistaken too in the Sence of the Present Parliament and they may be assur'd had not their Enemies seen that an  English  Protestant Parliament as this is is not to be prevail'd upon to Overthrow so Substantial a Part of the Nations Liberty as is setled in the Act of Toleration they had not rested so long but before now had attempted it  They have try'd it in the Pulpit scatter'd it in Scandalous Pamphlets from the Press affirmed that Toleration is Destructive of the Churches as well as the Nations Safety they have endeavour'd by Calumny and Reproach to blacken the Dissenters with Crimes never committed and which they wou'd never own before are at last come to represent them as a formidable Party  And yet all this cou'd never bring so much as One Member of the House to be so blind to his Countries Interest as to make a Motion against the Act of Toleration  Being thus disappointed and willing to play at small Game rather than stand out they fly to the Sanctuary of this Bill and feign themselves gratify'd by it more than ever the Bill or the House it self intended for in all their Arguments for the Bill 'tis suppos'd to be a Means to Reduce Humble and Mortifie the Dissenters  Ridiculus Mus  Is this all Why really Gentlemen had it been in our Power you should have had all this without an Act of Parliament this will  Strengthen not Reduce us 'twill please not Mortifie or Humble us and thus you find your selves all Mistaken Mistaken in the House of Commons themselves in thinking the Representatives of a Protestant Nation will Repeal the Act of Toleration upon which the Tranquility of their Native Country so much depends but above all Mistaken in their Expectation of the Queen to whom their Behaviour is Preposterous and Unmannerly  'Twas preposterous for People to expect that because the Queen was a Friend to the Church a constant Member and always Espoused the Interest of the Church that therefore when She came to the Crown She must come up to all their extravagant Heights  When Her Majesty was Princess and a Subject she constantly adher'd to the Interest of the Church but at the same time declar'd Her Opinion for tolerating the Dissenters in their Liberty of Protestant Worship while they behaved themselves quietly and obediently under the Government  When Her Majesty came to the Crown She became the general Mother the Guardian the Refuge of all Her Subjects She places the Church first in Her Favour promises them Her special and particular care as those who by Judgment and Inclination She stands engaged with but as She finds a great Number of Her People unhappily divided in Opinion yet in all other Respects Her good Subjects what can She do less than give them Her Protection This She has readily promis'd them and on this they thankfully depend  But here comes the Gentlemen of the Long Gown and they tell her in so many Words She cannot She must not keep her Word with us They tell us She will halt between God and  Baal  if She does not so Declare for the Church as to her Best to Suppress and destroy all Separate Worships and have all the Priests  of  Baal  the best Terms they can bestow on the Dissenting Ministers hew'd to Pieces before the Lord  'Tis Unmannerly that the Church of  England  men shou'd expect the Queen to break Her word with some of Her Subjects to oblige others and that whereas She has promis'd them Her Special Favour they shou'd not be content with that unless She will at the same time Oppress Two Millions of her Faithful People to oblige them  Let them go on but let them be assur'd the Dissenters shall enjoy their Liberty of Conscience till they can prevail with Her Majesty to lay aside her Veracity and forget Her Royal Word and refuse us Her Protection which we are resolved never to give Her any Reason for  As to the Bill against Occasional Conformity it baulks their Design on the Dissenters for 'tis for their Advantage they always dislik'd the Practice it has more than once been Protested against and Exploded and I dare undertake not one Dissenter offers to present a Petition to the House against its passing  'Tis plain that Occasional Communion is contrary to the very Nature and Being of a Dissenter who if he can Conform ought to Conform and if he can for a Place of Preferment ought to do it without that Preferment  'Tis plain that whatever by the Connivance of Remiss Ministers and with too much Regard to Parties may have been slightly pass'd over yet by the very Constitution and Foundation of a collected separate Church or Congregation no Man can go back to the Communion of the Church of  England  and be received again upon any other Condition but as a Penitent 'tis an Act Destructive of all possible Pretence for Dissenting and never was nor never can be defended by any Dissenter without overthrowing all the Reasons they cou'd ever give for Dissenting  How then can this Bill be aim'd at the Dissenters either they who think 'tis aim'd at them are Mistaken or they that point it at them are Mistaken for Suppressing an Error crept in among them contrary to their Constitution against their Judgment declared by them to be a Grievance can never be their Injury nor ought to be their Trouble  Let them Name us the Dissenter that ever vindicated this Practice one passionate Author excepted let them tell us the Time when any Congregation received such conforming Nonconformatists without dissatisfactions and Discontents let them tell us a Time whenever the thing was practic'd till the Reign of King  James  'Tis a Novelty an Abuse crept in among us and we are glad to have it Condemn'd by Authority at the same Time not at all thinking our selves oblig'd to the Authors for their Good Will  'Twill be objected this is a Feint to close with a thing when you cannot help it  No Gentlemen we don't tell you we like that part of the Bill which Excludes us from the Native Honours and Preferments of our Country which are our Due our Birthright equally with our Neighbours and to which we should be call'd by the Suffrage of the People and we cannot but think it a Hardship beyond the Power of Reason to justifie but since this Right must be clogg'd with so many Inconveniencies that we must Mortgage our Consciences to enjoy them no Man can have any Charity left for us but must presently conclude we shall freely forego such Trifles for our Consciences or else that we may have no Consciences at all  Therefore  'tis no Feint  we are so content with the Suppressing the Grievance of this Scandalous  Ambodexter Conformity  that we think the Hardships put upon us with it not worth naming we doubt not  the Parliament will one time or other see Cause to do us Justice and to restore to us the Priviledges of our Ancestors and which we have done nothing to forfeit  But all the Parliaments that ever were or will be can never Suppress any thing among us so Scandalous to our Reputation and to that Candour with which we desire to Guide our Actions nor so Contrary to and Destructive of the very Nature of our separating from the Church of  England  and the Constitution of all our Collected Congregations  We acknowledge that if this was an allow'd Practice among us we cou'd not pretend the Character of a Dissenter I have here given to be Just but without Question it is a most Just Character of all those Dissenters who are Consciencious and Honest 'tis the Original the Nature of a Dissenter what is crept in more is a Corruption and we wish it Extinguished and since none has said any thing of this Nature but what has been said before and no Church of  England  Man can think or speak worse of it than the truly Religious Dissenters have done we freely dismiss all those who can thus Build with one Hand and Pull Down with another to a Liberty of declaring for the future who they are for  Only pursuant to what has all along been acknowledg'd so far as we handl'd this Argument if they wou'd accept of the Friendly Advice of their Brethren it should be that they would for the future Conform to the Church of  England  For 'tis plain he that can Conform to the Church to qualifie himself for Preferment for Employment or any such Reason can Conform if not he must be arrived to a Degree of Mastership over his Conscience so as to subject it to his Interest and act against light and he that can do that may do any thing and 'tis no matter what Church he communicates with of such  a Man I think I Trespass not upon Charity to say he has all his Work of Religion to do over again and he also may Conform till God shall give his Conscience Light enough to chuse by and him Grace to be Obedient to the Convictions of his own Heart and whether that be to Conform or Dissent let him judge  But if any Man who has profest himself a Religious Dissenter shall upon the passing this Act declare himself Resolv'd to turn to the Dissenters I think no Congregation of Dissenters according to the Nature of Religious Communion can receive him upon any other Terms than as a  Penitent  If he has not Sinn'd why shou'd he Repent  Says a Learned Author in this very Case  I answer he either has Sinn'd in Conforming or he Sinn'd in Dissenting before or he Sins in coming off for if he did not Sin in Conforming he ought to have continued there and his coming off is a plain Schism but if he did Sin he ought to acknowledge the Sin which is what I mean by being receiv'd as a Penitent  I am told after all this but upon what Authority do you write thus You take upon you to write in the Name of the Dissenters what Commission have you to write in the Plural And how do we know that the Dissenters disown this Occasional Communion  I answer Publication is an Appeal to the World if I have wrote what is not true or affirm'd that in the Name of the Dissenters which is not their Opinion I am liable to an easie Confutation but as I have never yet had my Argument refuted so tho' I have not received a Formal Commission Truth is a General Commission and any Man may write it  And yet I am not without a general Concurrence of all the Dissenters I ever converst with and he that can answer the Argument is welcome to Make his Negative as Publick as this and let the World judge who is in the Right  A NEW TEST OF THE Church of  England  's Loyalty OR WHIGGISH LOYALTY AND CHURCH LOYALTY COMPAR'D  IN all the unhappy Contentions among Parties and Factions in this brangling Nation the Champions of the Church of  England as they wou'd have themselves call'd  have laid it down as the distinguishing Mark of their Hierarchy that it is her Practice and has been deriv'd from her very Constitution as well as Doctrine to fix in all her Members Principles of unshaken Loyalty to her Prince entire and undisputed Obedience to all her Commands and an Abhorrence of the very Thoughts of those Hellish Principles  That it can be lawful on any Account whatsoever to resist the establish'd Power of their Kings  'Twou'd be endless to quote the the Reverend Dr  Bge  who from the Text in the th of  Romans  v  Resist not the Powers  c  for whatsoever Powers are he ordained of God whosoever therefore resisteth the  Power resisteth the Ordinance of God  tells us  That if the King shou'd by his Royal Command execute the greatest Violence upon either our Person or Estate our Duty was to submit by Prayers and Tears first to God Almighty to turn the Wrath of his Vicegerent from his Servant and by bumble Entreaty to beg his Majesties Grace and Pardon but  to lift up the Hand against the Lord's Anointed or resist the Evil of punishment he thought fit to inflict  this were a Crime unpardonable either before God or Man and a Crime says the Reverend Dr which we bless God the very Principles of our  Ever Loyal Mother  the Church of  England  abhors and detests  Let Incendiaries Phanaticks and Bloody Peacebreaking Wbigs says another Learned Divine nourish the Vip'rous Principles of Treason and Rebellion and let them meet their due Reward of their Factious Doings in the Resentments of a Righteous but Provok'd Nation But God be praised our Mother the Church of  England  has always brought up her Sons in an unspotted Loyalty and Obedience none have been found lifting up their Hands against their Soveraign or possessing the Rights of the Anointed of God  c  The very Being and Life the Original and Principles of the Church of  England  says another  th  of  January  Sermon is Loyalty and Fidelity to God as the Immediate Supream and to the King as the lively Image of Divine Authority whose Power is immediately deriv'd from holds of and is accountable to none but to God Himself  To avoid Prolixity of Quotation the Reader is desired to accept of these as sufficient Proofs of what I lay down  upon this Condition nevertheless  that besides the general Appeal which I make to the Memory of most Men I oblige my self upon Demand to produce Ten Thousand fair Quotations of Nonresistance of Princes PassiveObedience and Divine Authority of the Kingly Power is own'd and declar'd to be an Essential Part of the Profession and Practice of the  Church of  England  and upon this Foot which I hold to be sufficient I think I cannot be censured if I take it for Granted  Now as this too much divided Nation has always been compos'd of two contending Parties those Parties have been distinguish'd  as in like Cases  by Names of Contempt and tho' they have often chang'd them on either side as Cavalier and Roundhead Royalists and Rebels Malignants and Phanaticks Tories and Whigs yet the Division has always been barely  the Church and the Dissenter  and there it continues to this Day  As the Church of  England  Party have boasted of their own Loyalty so they have branded the Dissenter with Rebellion and Faction not only in their Nature but in their very Principles they have laid it down in their Writings and Sermons and Multitudes of their ignorant Hearers believe it that  the very Doctrine of the Dissenter is made up of Principles in their own Nature tending to Confusion and Rebellion  they wo'n't be content that we shou'd own there may be Men among all Parties of bad Designs and who wou'd on all Occasions embroil their Native Country but it must be woven with the very Articles of Faith and that 'tis the Religion of a Dissenter to disturb Government kill Kings and oppose Laws  The Phanatical Enemies of our King and Church  says the Learned Dr  Pn drink in Rebellion as Water 'tis the very Substance of their Schismatical Doctrine to overwhelm and destory and Commonwealths and Confusions are the Doctrines they preach  He that lays out one Groat with a Dissenter says the worthy Sir  Roger  in one of his Famous  Observators  contributes so much as the Profits of that Groat amounts to in Trade towards the Subversion of the Monarchy and Erecting a Commonwealth for the very Nature and Tendency of their Profession is destructive  of Kingly Power and the Government of the Nation  This has been the Opinion of the Church of  England  both of themselves on one Hand and of the Dissenters on the other Hand I shou'd be glad if I cou'd only say  It has been  for we find 'tis still too much their Opinion  Let no Man say that the Author of these Sheets is either widening or keeping unheal'd the Breaches of this Nation for if I can make it appear that there is really no Occasion of such unnatural Divisions and that neither the extraordinary Opinion of themselves nor the Contempt of their Neighbours as to the matter of Loyalty is a becoming Principle no nor a rational one neither For that as to Loyalty PassiveObedience NonResistance  c  there is really no great Difference between one side or other I go as far towards healing the Breach as any Man for there can be no better way to end the Strife on both Sides than to prove that neither Side has any just Cause to contend  To examine the Matter on both Sides seems very useful at this time in order to reconcile Parties and to settle the Universal Character of the Nation  The Government of  England  is a limited Monarchy composed of King Lords and Commons each have their several their separate and their conjunctive Powers which acting in Concert make the Harmony of the Constitution I shall not invade the Province of those learned Gentlemen who have undertaken to set forth the Branches of the Constitution in all their Powers Limitations and Prerogatives 'Tis enough to say the Constitution is known the Government is confin'd by Laws the Crown limited by Statutes and the Peoples Rights confirm'd by the Concession of Ages  To this Government all Distinction of Names set  apart I am of the Opinion all Parties have in their Turns been equally Loyal I was going to say equally Disloyal And if I were to use the Language of late Times it wou'd be a very proper way of speaking  Affirming without demonstrating is an absurd way of arguing and therefore it will be needful to come to Particulars and to examine the several Acts and Deeds of both Parties when the Kingly Prerogative has shock'd or clash'd with the People  In order to this 'tis needful co examine the Date of the Difference and so enter a little into History  Our first Reformation from Popery was in the Days of King  Edward  the VI I call it the first because 'twas under him that the whole Nation and the Government embrac'd the Protestant Reform'd Religion this Protestant Religion was establish'd by  that Zealous King  and by his Parliament back'd with the force of Laws and confirm'd by all the Sanction of Authority it was capable of and here it began to be call'd the Church of  England  Some enquiring Christians were for making farther Steps and carrying on the Reformation to a higher Degree and if that good reforming King had liu'd his Zeal and Integrity was such that there was no doubt he wou'd have gone on to perfect every thing he had begun as new Light or more Knowledge had encreased but the Return of Popery under Queen  Mary  put a Stop to the Work in general and went very far towards overturning the whole Structure of the Reformation  Queen  Elizabeth  restor'd it again but as she was a Zealous Protestant Queen yet she was not for subjecting the Reformation to any Amendment Not that she believ'd it perfect but she was a Politick Princess surrounded with Enemies that were not to be dally'd with and she was loth to suppose such Defects  in the Reformation as were alledg'd because 'twas to lessen the Reputation of it and consequently her Interest in the World  Those who insisted upon the further Reformation were then call'd  Puritans  because they set up for a greater Purity of Worship and they separated themselves from the establish'd Church because as they said their Consciences inform'd them they cou'd serve God more agreeable to his Will  I shall not meddle with the Arguments made use of on both Sides either to defend or expose this Principle 'tis sufficient to acquaint my Reader that this is the true Original of the Dissenters We are now to examine a little further back Before this Reformation there was no such thing as Church of  England  it was then the Church of  Rome  that was the establish'd National Church  The Protestants under the Titles of  Lollards Wickliffians Hussites  c what did they do Did they  as our Modern People say every Body shou'd  conform to what the Government commanded No the present Church of  England  Party were the Dissenters the Schismaticks and Phanaticks in the Days of King  Henry  VIII were persecuted for not coming to Church many of them put to Death and always treated with Scorn and Contempt as Enemies to the Government Broachers of new Opinions and Contemners of Authority as in the Case of that Famous ProtoMartyr of Christ's Church  John Lambert  and others  In the next Ages these come to have the Power in their Hands and forgetting that they had found it  Righteous in the Sight of God to obey God rather than Man  they treat those whose Consciences oblige them to dissent from them with the same Contempt which themselves had receiv'd from the  Roman  Government  Thus far they are upon even Terms as to Obedience to their Superiors  The Dissenters have the first Occasion after this to show their Submission under extraordinary Pressures Queen  Elizabeth  discountenanc'd them continually and as good a Queen as she was put some of them to Death King  James  I hunted them quite out of the Kingdom made Thousands of them fly into  Holland  and  Germany  and at last to  NewEngland  During the long Reign of these Two Princes we find no charge of Treason or Rebellion upon them they bore the Displeasure of their Princes with Patience and Passive Obedience  if I may be allow'd that Ridiculous Phrase  being persecuted in one City they fled to another they bore illegal Prosecutions and things contrary to their Right as  English  Men but never took up Arms against their Prince  Under the Reign of King  Charles  I the Case alter'd the King and Parliament fell out about Matters of Civil Right and Invasion of the Liberty and Properties of the People the  Puritans  or Dissenters call them what we please fell in unanimously with the Parliament  And here 'tis worthy Remark that the first Difference between the King and the  English  Parliament did not Respect Religion but Civil Property nor were the Majority of the House  Puritans  but true Church Protestants and  English  Men who stood upon the Rights of the People as  English  Men and none were more Zealous in the first Disputes than the Lord  Digby  Sir  Thomas Wentworth  and such as were afterwards deep Sufferers for the King  But the Parliament finding the  Puritan  Party stuck close to their Cause they also came over them when Things came to a Rupture and so the War begun on the Score of Right Invasion of Liberty Breach of the Laws Private Leagues and MaleAdministration a Game we have seen play'd over again by the very same Church of  England  that have exclaim'd so much against  it so damn'd it and so damn'd themselves by Oaths Declarations Tests and God knows what against it  'Tis allow'd here the Puritan broke thro' his Loyalty and his former Obedience and fought his Way to the Liberty he demanded Well the War ended to his Advantage he subdued his Soveraign and brought him to the Block to the Astonishment of the whole World  I won't dispute here which or which Party did or did not do it but to give the Enemy all just Advantage I am willing to grant it in the largest Sence that the Dissenters or Phanaticks or Whigs call them as you please did embrue their Hands in the Blood of the Lord's Anointed put to Death that Blessed Martyr King  Charles  the I whom the Learned Divine in a Sermon on the th of  January  before the Parliament compares both in the manner of his Sufferings and the People by whom to our Saviour and the Jews and boldly runs on in the Blasphemous Parallel to shew that the Indignities and Sufferings of King  Charles  exceed those of Jesus Christ  I think I have granted as largely as a fair Adversary can desire for I have yielded for Peacesake to several Things which I cou'd fairly disprove  Nor shall I return to a Repetition of the ill Usage the Dissenters have receiv'd from the contrary Party on this Account for above Years the constant Reproaches they and their Children after them have met with from those Gentlemen who on all Occasions have as I hinted before particularly taken care to extol their own unshaken Fidelity to their Prince till at last an Occasion presents to touch them in the same most sensible Part  their Right and Property  and  alas  Their Loyalty what became of it Truly the  Faithful Passively Obedient Ʋnshakenly Loyal  Church return'd to the Original Nature of their Neighbours and did the same thing exactly which the Whigs  the Factious Rebellious Whigs  had done before  No that's false  says a Disciple of Dr  Sherlock  's  we did not Kill our King we did not dip our Hands in Royal Blood nor hurt the Lords Anointed  No that's true but the Lords Anointed may thank himself for that for my part I think the Difference only lyes here the Whigs in to took up Arms against their King and having Conquer'd him and taken him Prisoner and having taken him Prisoner cut off his Head  because they had begun  The Church of  England  took Arms against their King in and did not cut off his Head  because they had him not  King  Charles  lost his Life  because he did not run away  and his Son King  James  sav'd his Life  because he did run away  'Tis such a Jest such a Banter to say We did take up Arms but we did not kill him  Bless us Kill our King we wou'd not have hurt a Hair of his Head  Why every Bullet shot at the Battel of the  Boyne  was a killing the King for if you did not 'twas because you cou'd not hit him  If a Highwayman Fires at you upon the Road when he is taken and brought upon his Trial our Learned Recorder before he pronounces Sentence of Death Harangues him in this manner  And besides all this Sir you are plainly guilty of Murther for you not only assaulted this Honest Man in order to take away his Money but you endeavoured to Murther him for you shot at him in order to kill him and the Intention of Murther is equally Criminal in the Eyes of God with the Act it self  Now who did we shoot at at the  Boyne 'Tis true King  James  generally stood out of the way  But who did we Shoot at What Was our Orders to  fight against both small and great and not against the King of  Israel Had your Bullets Commission to shew their Loyalty and not to touch the Lords Anointed If he had charg'd in the first Squadrons of his Horse  had you not kill'd him if you cou'd I think this needs no further Proof  Nay if Arguments may be allow'd to have equal Weight on both sides the Whigs have been the honester of the two for they never profest any such blind absolute and undisputed Obedience to Princes as the others have done  It has always been their Opinion That Government was Originally contrived by the Consent and for the mutual Benefit of the Parties Govern'd that the People have an Original Native Right to their Property the Liberty of their Persons and Possessions  unless forefaulted to the Laws  that they cannot be divested of their Right but by their own Consent and that all Invasion of this Right is destructive of the Constitution and dissolves the Compact of Government and Obedience  They have always declar'd That they understand their Allegiance to their Governors to be  supposing they Govern them according to the Laws of the Land  and that if Princes break this Bond of Government the Nature of it is inverted and the Constitution ceases of course  Buchanan  in  Scotland Algernoon Sidney  in  England  have set their Names and the latter his Blood to this Doctrine and the Author of the  Trueborn Englishman  is worth quoting in this Case  The Government's ungirt when Justice dies  And Constitutions are NonEntities  The Nation's all a Mob there's no such thing  As Lords or Commons Parliament or King  A great promiscuous Crowd the  Hydra  lyes  Till Laws revive and mutual Contract ties  A  Chaos  free to chuse for their own Share  What Case of Government they please to wear  If to a King they do the Reins commit  All Men are bound in Conscience to submit  But then that King must by his Oath assent  To  Postulata  's of the Government  Which if he breaks he cuts off the Entail  And Power retreats to its Original  TrueBorn Englishman  P    This has been the avow'd Doctrine of the Dissenters and is indeed the true Sense of the Constitution it self pursuant to this Doctrine they thought they had a Right to oppose Violence with Force believing that when Kings break Coronation Oaths the Solemn Compact with their People and encroach upon their Civil Rights contrary to the Laws of the Land by which they are Sworn to Rule they cease to be the Lord's Anointed any longer the Sanction of their Office is vanish'd and they become Tyrants and Enemies of Mankind and may be treated accordingly  Now 'tis no wonder to find People of these Principles vigorously withstanding their Governors when they tread upon the tender sore Places of the Constitution 'tis nothing but what they all along pretended to and declar'd to be their Opinion  But to find the Church of  England  Men whose Loyalty has been the Subject of a thousand Learned Authors and numberless Sermons whose Character and Mark of Distinction has been chosen more for her steady Adherence and Fidelity to her Prince than to God Almighty whose Obedience to her Monarch has been declar'd to be Inviolate and Immovable and who pretends to be Famous through the whole World for her Faithfulness to Kings  for her  as soon as ever the King did but as it were seem to aim at crushing her Authority as soon as he did but begin to call her Clergy to an Account and clap her  Golden Condlesticks  for Disobedience  for her  to winch and kick  fly to Foreign Princes for Protection and rise in Arms against her Prince O  Pellin  O  Brady  O  Sherloch▪  O  Hominum  O  Mores  Where's the Worthy Dr  Bge  's Loyal  now his Immovable Loyalty That after all his Absolute Submission is so far from being a Martyr to his own Doctrine that he could not lose a small Benefice for it  Where is the famous Dr  Sk  Who having stood out long in his old Antiquated Doctrine of Passive Obedience and confirm'd the Faith of his Suff'ring Brethren by strong and wonderful Arguments at last at the powerful Instigation of a Wife and a good Salary  has Sold all his Loyalty for a Mess of Pottage  solving his Honesty with the wretched Distinction of a Power  De Facto  and a Power  De Jure  as if the Church of  England  's Credit cou'd be sav'd by such an impotent Shift or as if he cou'd make Amends to the Prebendary for his helping him to Sacriflce his Brethren to Father his Conversion on reading honest Dr  Overall  whose Doctrine 'tis well known the Doctor knew before but that he was loth Dr  South  shou'd have the Honour of bringing him over to such Old Phanatick Principles  Behold the Loyalty of the Church of  England  now let's examine their Conscience as to taking Oaths and if I do not bring them to be all Whigs and  FortyOneMen  or else prove them all Perjur'd then I do nothing  The Clergy all the Magistrates and Officers of the Houshold of the Civil or Military Government were Members of the Church of  England  otherwise they cou'd not be employ'd the Sacramental Test has done the Dissenters this Kindness that 'tis plain all the Managing Hands in the Kingdom were Disciples of the Church and as an additional Circumstance the Oath of Allegiance which they took and which  was God be praised of their own making bound them to that same Absolute Blind Obedience which they profest and confin'd it to the King his Heirs and Successors  If this Oath be consider'd literally I am content to be silenc'd when one fair Argument can be brought to evade it the Declaration follow'd it wherein they detest and abhor that devilish Doctrine that 'tis lawful  on any Pretence whatsoever Mark the Emphasis  to take up Arms against the King this  equal to an Oath  declar'd in the Presence of God and the Particulars being material to our Purpose are as follows  I  A B  do Declare and Believe that it is not Lawful upon any Pretence whatsoever to take up Arms against the King and that I do abhor that Traiterous Position of taking Arms by his Authority against those that are commissioned by him  So help me God  Notwithstanding this you have taken up Arms against deposed and as far as you were able put to Death your lawful King the very King you swore Allegiance to  Now  pray Gentlemen give Commission to some worthy Champion of your Church's Loyalty to bring you sairly off of your Oath and Declaration if you can  and till you do be not angry with us for making one of these Conclusions from the Premises and you shall chuse for your selves  First  That this Doctrine of Absolute Passive and Nonresistant Obedience is an Absurdity in it self contradictory to the Nature of Government and Allegiance and politically introduc'd by State Engines into the Church of  England  to abuse her and betray her Members into unforeseen Mischiefs and Inconveniences  Or  Secondly  That the Members of the Church of  England  are all Apostates from the very Fundamental Doctrine of their Church Perjur'd in the Sight of God and Man Notorious Hypocrites and Deceivers who having sworn Obedience without Reserve to their Prince are become Traitors Rebels and Murtherers of the Lord's Anointed and their Lawful Soveraign and not having the Fear of God before their Eyes have depos'd and traiterously dethron'd their Rightful King God Almighty's Vicegerent accountable to no Earthly Power Supream under God Absolute and from Divine Institution Undoubted Sole Lord of them and their Country  Or  Lastly  That they only are the true Church of  England  who according to their avow'd Profession have firmly adher'd to their King in all his Sufferings and Solitude have never blacken'd their Consciences nor gone back from their Obedience forgotten their Oaths nor sullied their Reputation with the horrid Crimes of Treason and Rebellion as they think it to be  Now as a fair Disputant I am willing the Respondent shall chuse which of these three Consequences he will stand by in Behalf of the Church of  England  's Loyalty but if they wou'd take the Advice of  a Friend to the Honest Part of them  I wou'd recommend the first Conclusion to be fittest for them for the following Reasons  Because since Humane Infallibility is  and with good Reason  disown'd by the Church of  England  both for her self and every Body else it can be no Diminution to her Reputation when she has found her self mistaken and impos'd upon to acknowledge her Error  a wise Man will always own rather than defend a Mistake  Because 'tis my Opinion that their Way is hedg'd up against any other Pretence Evasion or  Reservation and therefore 'tis with me the only thing that Charity can say for them and must remain so till I find something else said that is more to the Purpose  But the Mischief of all is that if this be honestly acknowledg'd  as is doubtless most true  that the Church of  England  was mistaken and impos'd upon to espouse a Sensless Absurd Principle contrary to the Nature of Government and Allegiance  c  why then they come over to this Consequence  That Government and Allegiance are both Conditional and Oaths of Subjects are always to be consider'd in a Constructive Sence with Conditions of Protection and the like a thing which is without question the real Meaning of all Oaths of Allegiance otherwise Subjects may be put under an Absolute Necessity of Perjury or State Martyrdom by often Swearing what may be impossible for them to perform  The Town of  Aeth  in  Flanders  has been about Six Times and the Town of  Rhinebergh  in  Gueldre  about Twelve Times Taken and Retaken and as often as new Masters had Possession of the Place so often the poor Inhabitants have sworn to their new Lords What can the Meaning of such an Oath be but that they will be faithful to them so long as they keep Possession of the Place 'Twou'd be ridiculous to imagine the Imposers of the Oath requir'd any more  If our Zealous Churchmen worded an Oath contrary to the very Nature of Swearing Allegiance let them answer for it who first made it then took it then broke it But the Nature of the thing can leave Room for no other Suggestion that I know of  Till then some further Argument is produc'd it must rest here that the Church of  England  was Mistaken Imposed upon  c  that she finds when the Laws are Broken the Right of the People Invaded the Root of the Government Struck at Church and State Undermin'd and Despotick Tyranny at the  Door the Native Right of the People is Superior and they may assume a Power to Right themselves  And so we are brought back to Whiggism and Forty One and Gentlemen there is no Remedy for it help it if ye can  Where now is the Difference between Church Loyalty and Whiggish Loyalty Roundhead or Cavalier Churchman or Dissenter Whig or Troy All are alike they are pleas'd when legally Govern'd Quarrelsome and Unruly if Opprest and will Defend themselves if Assaulted tho' it be by their Kings or any Body else  Why then is the Difference kept up Methinks they might all be Friends together for they are all alike the Dissenters have been in their times as Loyal and the Church of  England  in their time as Disloyal one as another  Vice versa  the Dissenters have been as Disloyal and the Churchmen as Loyal as one another upon the same Occasion they have been both Sufferers and have submitted to the Government ay and to the Oppressions and Persecutions of their Superiors and Soveraigns and again upon the like Occasions they have both of them been Rebels  if their own Language may be so far used  they have both of them in their Turn taken Arms against and depos'd their Rightful and Lawful Kings  So that in my Opinion  with a Latitude to all that think otherwise to think as they please  the Church of  England  and their Neighbours the Dissenters have nothing to quarrel with one another about as to Loyalty as to other Matters I have nothing to say to them nor shall not mingle it with this Discourse  Nor do I think I am writing a Satyr against the Church of  England  nor is it at all intended to be so and to stop all Pretences that way I take the Freedom to say here has been no Crime the Church of  England  has been in the right of it not in taking Arms but the Error was in Espousing Crying up and  Pretending to a Blind Absolute Obedience to Princes be their Commands never so Absolute Tyrannical or Illegal this neither the Doctrine nor Practice of the Church of  England  nor of any Church or People in the Christian World ever pretended to and therefore the Fanlt lay in those People who being themselves Members of the Church of  England  suffer'd themselves to be deluded by State Ministers to foster a Tenent upon the Church which her Original Constitution never pretended to and then call it the Doctrine of the Church of  England  The first beginning of their pretended Doctrine was found in  Manwaring  's and  Sibthorp  's Libels in the Days of King  Charles  I cajoling the King and then to please him endeavouring to wheedle the People into a Belief of the Divine Right of Kingly Government and affirming that the King was not oblig'd by the Laws in the Administration of the Government  Upon this preposterons Foundation they built the Illegitimate Structure of Absolute Undisputed Obedience for if Kingly Power were once prov'd to be immediately deriv'd from Divine Authority Absolute Obedience wou'd be a Consequence no Body cou'd dispute since the same Obedience without Reserve wou'd be due to the Delegated Power as to the Power Delegating  And tho' this is a Point easily enough confuted yet being willing to keep the present Dispute within as small a Compass we can I think our Argument has nothing at all to do with it  Whether Government be of Divine Original or not seems not the Question here for if it be not so then as before the Church of  England  have been Mistaken and Imposed upon and if it be so then the Church of  England  has trampled under Foot their own Doctrine turn'd Rebels to God and Apostates from the Faith they have profest have Sacrilegiously and Traiterously  taken up Arms against their Prince assaulted the Lords Anointed  resisted the Powers which are the Ordinance of God  deposed their Lawful Soveraign broken their Allegiance and consequently  are a Parcel of Perjur'd Rebels  every Jot as bad as the worst Roundhead Regicide and Rebel of the Year FortyOne  What more or less can be said I profess I know not and am in great Expectation of something new in the Matter for I cannot find in all the Writings I have met with any thing to contradict it  The bringing Government and Obedience to the proper Circumstances of mutual Compact between King and People seems to me to be the only Method to unravel this Skein of entangl'd Principles the Nature of Government has made it the necessary Consequence of all Argument relating to Power and I cou'd give Instances in all the Nations in the World that some time or other even the Right of Succession to Government  which must be as Sacred as the Power  has been Interrupted and Limited by the People in case of Tyranny and Illegal Governing and every Nation  and this among the rest  has oftentimes Depos'd their Princes for the Preservation of the State when either Incapacity for Government Tyrannical Usurpation or other MaleAdministration has been the Case  But this I think also needless here every one that is vers'd in History can read the numerous Examples in the  Roman Grecian  and  Persian  Histories  even Sacred Histories where Kings were more particularly of Divine Right than any where  are full of them the Histories of  Spain Portugal France Lombardy  the Empires of  Germany  and  Muscovy  even the Papal Chair have suffer'd Convulsions and Revolutions the Deposing and Displacing their Soveraigns when the Peoples Good  which is and ever was the Soul the Center the End and the Cause of all Government  came to be in the Dispute  But to return to the Principles of the Two Parties we are now discoursing of the Whigs as before have always asserted this to be their Notion of Government and Governors and the Church of  England however some among them have topt an empty Notion upon them  have all along and  now at last once for all  own'd it by their Practice  That Kings when they descend to Tyranny  Dissolve the Bond and leave the Subject free  Trueborn Eng Man  P    The Act for the further Limitation of the Crown past in the last Parliament and the Right of the People therein Declar'd and Recogniz'd I wou'd ask my Opponent whose Act and Deed it was Will they say it was a Whiggish Act made by a Phanatical House of Commons  I dare say there was not Ten Dissenters in the House  let them descend with us into Particulars let them draw out a  Black List  of Members who in that Loyal Honest  English  Parliament gave their Hands to the last Settlement and Declaration of Right and let us  tell Noses  and put a Brand upon the  Phanaticks  among them  Will they tell us it was a  Phanatical Parliament  that set the Crown upon the Queens Head I hope they will own Her Majesty and their Lordships the Bishops are part of the Church of  England  for if the Head and the principal Members are not we know not who are  Will they tell us that Sir  E S  Sir  B S  Sir  J B  Mr  Hy  Sir  Cr Mve  and a Hundred more of that Side were Whigs and CommonwealthMen  How comes it to pass in  England  that no  Papist  can inherit  Divine Right  ought to supercede all Precautions and  the Young Prince of  Savoy not the  House of Hannover  ought to Reign with a  Non Obstante  to all  Humane Limitation if all was from Heaven Where are our Right LineMen now Why truly the Reason is plain the  Church of England People of England a Church of England Parliament of England  have thought fit to Declare that for the Good of the People  to which all Right of Succession to Power must give way because from them all Power it self does derive  and by the Voice of that people in which Authority sufficient is Legally Grounded it is Unanimously agreed that  we will not have a Papist to Reign over us  All this is too plain to admit of a Dispute and now to me it seems Preposterous why any Men shou'd keep up the Distinction between Parties as to Loyalty when indeed there is no manner of Difference in the Case  I have talk'd several times of Bearing Suffering being Persecuted and Oppress'd as the Dissenters in their time have been more than enough and again in their Turn the Church of  England  have been Persecuted too for as I noted before they were once the  Schismaticks  the  Whigs  and the  Dissenters  Now I think 'tis not very foreign to my Argument to examine whether of the Two behav'd themselves under their Sufferings with the greatest Submission who show'd most Absolute Obedience to their Superiors and who  first or oftenest rebell'd  against their Lawful Soveraign  The Protestants under  Henry  VIII were the first Dissenters they were kept Under Persecuted and put to Death as Rebels and Schismaticks Now upon due Search it will be fouhd that under the Protection of Two Protestant Queens Wives of King  Henry  VIII they had more than once form'd such Interest at Court and in the Kingdom as to begin to be formidable to the Popish Powers then reigning and the Fall of the Lord  Cromwell  was thought a necessary Policy in King  Henry  to prevent the Plots of the  Phanatical Church of  England  Hereticks  a long Account  of which may be read in the Life of that Prince  King  Edward  the VI a Zealous and pious Prince made no Scruple for the  Propagation  of the  Protestant  Church of  England  of which he was the Glorious Founder to set Aside the Lawful and Undisputed Succession of his own Sisters to Establish the Crown in the Lady  Jane Grey  who he knew wou'd carry on the Work of Reformation  There's an Instance of the Zeal for Succession in the Right Line in the First Protestant Head that ever the Church of  England  had  After this the Gospellers  that is the Church of  England  Protestants of  Suffolk having some Sense of Injury done to the  Princess Mary  and willing to have the Succession go on in the Right Line provided they cou'd both preserve their Religion and Loyalty too Capitulate with her and promise to stand by her provided she wou'd promise to preserve and make no Alteration in their Establish'd Church of  England  Here the Church of  England  Men own'd the Liberty of their Religion to be Superior to their Loyalty to her and that they had a Right to Submit or not to Submit as their Liberty was or was not Secure and accordingly Condition'd with her before they wou'd Acknowledge her to be their Queen  And we see how Heaven punish'd them for venturing on the Word of a  Prince  when their Religion and Liberty was at Stake  In this Queen's Time the Church having been again Suppress'd and Popery Erected Sir  Thomas Wyat  an honest Church of  England  Protestant with a very good Body of Men took up Arms against their Lawful Princess for breaking her Word in Defence of their  Dear Religion Establish'd by Blessed King  Edward which were the very Words of the Manifesto they Publish'd The Londoners with Men sent by the Queen against  gainst them thought it no Treachery to Desert their Lawful Popish Queen and go over to their Protestant Church of  England  Brethren  We have nothing to do with the Justification of this Fact 'tis sufficient that so it was and that these were Protestants of the Church of  England  in the first and purest part of their Principles and let them justifie the Fact if they please  Queen  Elizabeth  Succeeds and then the Church of  England  shone in its Meridian Glory and then grew up some who aiming  as I said before  at a further Reformation and the Church refusing to hearken to it form'd a new Party of Dissenters and these were call'd  Puritans  and since that  Phanaticks  Now I Challenge the Defender of this Cause to tell me one Disloyal Act one Plot against the Government one Disturbance of the Civil Peace among these Dissenters from the beginning of this Queen which was their own beginning to the Reign of King  Charles  I which was a continued Term of Years and yet during this time they suffer'd all manner of Indignities Reproaches Fining Imprisonings Banishment Confiscations and Corporal Punishments  So that hitherto the Passive Obedience of the Dissenters hath far exceeded that of the Church of  England  These had but Five Years Oppression under Queen  Mary  and in that Five Years they once Capitulated with their Soveraign to make her Queen upon Conditions and once took Arms against her after she was Queen and  by that  I must always understand that if they did not Depose and Destroy her it was because they cou'd not  and if they had done it no doubt they had Cause sufficient to Justifie them before God and Man  The  Puritans  after this suffered all that their  too cruel Brethren  of the Church of  England  laid upon them during Three tedious Reigns before  they so much as made the least offer at doing themselves Justice and for Years together exercis'd that  Passive Obedience  which they never pretended to  At last they took Arms and when they did they did it to purpose carried all before them subdued Monarchy cut off their Kings Head and  all that  After the Restoration Things began to return to their old Channel and Years more the Dissenters endur'd another  Aegyptian  Servitude were  Persecuted Plunder'd Indicted Imprison'd Plagu'd  with Impositions Stigmatiz'd with a Thousand Reproaches their MeetingHouses Demolish'd their Estates Confiscated their Persons Excommunicated and Anathematiz'd Sworn into  Plots  they never Heard of and into Crimes they never Commltted Dragg'd to Goals Gibbets and Scaffolds and the like  all this while PassiveObedence if there were any such thing  was found among them more than any where else for here was no Rebellion no Insurrection nor breaking of the  Peace  by the Dissenters notwithstanding all those Oppositions  After this comes King  James  the Second to the Crown and he turn'd the Scale and together with Invasion of Liberty falls upon the Church begins to Rifle her of her Trophies  for no Essentials had been touch'd  and how long did she bear it Not Years not Years no not so many Months  What did she do Truly nothing but what she ought to have done Defend her Liberty and Religion by Force against Unjust Invasion and Tyranny nothing but what all the Nations in the World have done and wou'd do again if they cou'd  The only Error we Charge upon the Church of  England  was setting up pretences of what they really wou'd not practice crying up themselves for Fools when we knew they were Wiser Men calling themselves  humble Slaves but when the Trial came proving Stubborn Refractory  Liberty Mongers  even as bad as the worst Whig or Phanatick of them all  For the future then if a Humble Mediator might be permitted to give Advice to the Gentlemen of the Church of  England  it shou'd be in these short and friendly Terms  Pray Gentlemen never be Imposed upon to pretend to more Loyalty and more slavish Principles than you intend to practice  Never pretend to more Obedience than your Sovereign requires Our Late King who I am not asham'd to show as a Pattern for future Ages requir'd and Her present Majesty  without Affront to Her Majesty's Authority it may be said  requires no further Obedience from the People of  England  than the Laws of  England  require  To Govern according to Law is a full Satisfaction to the People and to obey according to Law is a full Satisfaction to the Soveraign The Laws are the Test both of the Royal Authority and of the Subjects Obedience and to pretend to more Obedience than the Law requires is abusing your Prince and abusing your Selves  Never be ashamed to own with  your Brethren the Whigs  that you are willing to Submit to Authority but that you expect to be govern'd according to the Laws and Statutes of this Realm  Let the Scoth Motto be set upon your Liberties and according to your constant Practice  as well as theirs  let all Men know you design to make it Good  Nemo me Impune Lacessit  And as it really never was the Principle of the Church of  England nor were a Hundredth Part of the Members of the Church tainted with it  so for the Future 'tis hoped you will not suffer such to Mingle themselves among you or to Act in the Name of  the Church of  England  who pretend to a Blind Absolute Obedience to Princes  And  Lastly  Gentlemen a little more Modesty to your Humble Servants your Protestant Brethren the Dissenters or Whigs I mean as to Matter of Loyalty For in Truth Gentlemen we do not see any Reason you have to Reproach us in that Matter you being in every Particular as faulty that way as your Neighbours  THE SHORTESTWAY WITH THE DISSENTERS OR PROPOSALS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CHURCH  SIR  Roger L'Estrange  tells us a Story in his Collection of Fables of the Cock and the Horses The Cock was gotten to Roost in the Stable among the Horses and there being no Racks or other Conveniencies for him it seems he was forc'd to  Roost upon the Ground the Horses jostling about for room and putting the Cock in danger of his Life he gives them this grave Advice  Pray Gentlefolks let us stand still for fear we should tread upon one another  There are some People in the World who now they are  Ʋnpearcht  and reduc'd to an Equality with other People and under strong and very just Apprehensions of being further Treated as they deserve begin with  Aesop  'sCock to Preach up Peace and Union and the Christian Duties of Moderation forgetting that when they had the Power in their Hands those Graces were Strangers in their Gates  It is now near Fourteen Years that the Glory and Peace of the purest and most flourishing Church in the World has been Eclips'd Buffetted and Disturb'd by a sort of Men who God in his Providence has suffer'd to insult over her and bring her down these have been the Days of her Humiliation and Tribulation She has born with an invincible Patience the Reproach of the Wicked and God has at last heard her Prayers and deliver'd her from the Oppression of the Stranger  And now they find their Day is over their Power gone and the Throne of this Nation possest by a Royal  English  True and ever Constant Member of and Friend to the Church of  England  Now they find that they are in danger of the Church of  England  's just Resentments now they cry out  Peace Ʋnion Forbearance  and  Charity  as if the Church had not too long harbour'd her Enemies under her Wing and nourish'd the Viperous Brood till they hiss and fly in the Face of the Mother that cherish'd them  No Gentlemen  the Time of Mercy is past your  Day of Grace is over  you shou'd have practic'd Peace and Moderation and Charity if you expected any your selves  We have heard none of this Lesson for Fourteen Years past We have been huff'd and bully'd with  your Act of Toleration you have told us that you are the  Church establish'd by Law  as well as others have set up your  CantingSynagogues  at our ChurchDoors and the Church and Members have been loaded with Reproaches with Oaths Associations Abjurations and what not where has been the Mercy the forbearance the Charity you have shewn to  tender Consciences of the Church  of  England  that cou'd not take Oaths  as fast you made 'em  that having sworn Allegiance to their lawful and rightful King cou'd not dlspence with that Oath  their King being still alive  and swear to your new  Hodgepodge of a Dutch Government  These ha' been turn'd out of their Livings and they and their Families left to starve their Estates double Tax'd to carry on a War they had  no Hand in  and you  got nothing by  What Account can you give of the Multitudes you have forc'd to comply against their Consciences with your new  sophistical Politicks  who like new Converts in  France  Sin because they can't Starve And now the Tables are turn'd upon you you  must not be Persecuted 'tis not a Christian Spirit  You have  Butcher'd  one King  Depos'd  another King and made a  mock King  of a Third and yet you cou'd have the Face to expect to be employ'd and trusted by the Fourth any Body that did not know the Temper of your Party wou'd stand amaz'd at the Impudence as well as Fully to think of it  Your Management of your  Dutch Monarch  whom you reduc'd to a meer  King of Cls  is enough to give any future Princes such an Idea of your Principles as to warn them sufficiently from coming into your Clutches and God be thank'd the Queen is out of your Hands knows you and will have a care of you  There is no doubt but the supream Authority of a Nation has in its self a  Power and a Right to that Power  to execute the Laws upon any part of that Nation it governs The execution of the known Laws of the  Land and that with a weak and gentle Hand neither was all this phanatical Party of this Land have ever call'd Persecution this they have magnified to a Height that the Sufferings of the  Hugonots  in  France  were not to be compar'd withNow to execute the known Laws of a Nation upon those who transgress them after voluntarily consenting to the making those Laws can never be call'd Persecution but Justice But Justice is always Violence to the Party offending for every Man is Innocent in his own Eyes The first execution of the Laws against Dissenters in  England  was in the Days of King  James  the First and what did it amount to truly the worst they suffer'd was at their own request to let them go to  NewEngland  and erect a new Collony and give them great Priviledges Grants and suitable Powers keep them under Protection and defend them against all Invaders and receive no Taxes or Revenue from them This was the cruelty of the Church of  England  fatal Lenity 'Twas the ruin of that excellent Prince King  Charles  the First Had King  James  sent all the Puritans in  England  away to the  WestIndies  we had been a national unmix'd Church the Church of  England  had been kept undivided and entire  To requite the Lenity of the Father they take up Arms against the Son Conquer Pursue Take Imprison and at last put to Death the Anointed of God and Destroy the very Being and Nature of Government setting up a fordid Impostor who had neither Title to Govern nor Understanding to Manage but supplied that want with Power bloody and desperate Councils and Craft without Conscience  Had not King  James  the First withheld the full execution of the Laws had he given them strict Justice he had clear'd the Nation of them and the Consequences had been plain his  Son had never been Murther'd by them  nor the Monarchy overwhelm'd 'twas  too  much Mercy  shewn them was the ruin of his Posterity and the ruin of the Nations Peace One would think the Dissenters should not have the Face to believe that we are to be wheedl'd and canted into Peace and Toleration when they know that they have once requited us with a civil War and once with an intollerable and unrighteous Persecution for our former Civility  Nay to encourage us to be easie with them 'tls apparent that they never had the Upperhand of the Church but they treated Her with all the Severity with all the Reproach and Contempt as was possible What Peace and what Mercy did they shew the Loyal Gentry of the Church of  England  in the Time of their Triumphant Commonwealth How did they put all the Gentry of  England  to Ransom whether they were Actually in Arms for the King or not making People compound for their Estates and starve their Families How did they treat the Clergy of the Church of  England  sequester'd the Ministers devour'd the Patrimony of the Church and divided the Spoil by sharing the ChurchLands among their Soldiers and turning her Clergy out to starve just such Measure as they have meted shou'd be measur'd them again  Charity and Love is the known Doctrine of the Church of  England  and 'tis plain She has put it in Practice towards the Dissenters even beyond what they ought till She has been wanting to Her Self and in effect unkind to own Sons particularly in the too much Lenity of King  James  the First mentioned before had he so Rooted the Puritans from the Face of the Land which he had an Opportunity early to ha' done they had not had the Power to vex the Church as since they have done  IN the Days of King  Charles  the Second how did the Church reward their Bloody Doings with Lenity and Mercy  except the Barbarous Regicides of the pretended  Court of Justice  not a Soul suffer'd for all the Blood in an Unnatural War King  Charles  came in all Mercy and Love cherish'd them prefer'd them employ'd them withheld the Rigour of the Law and oftentimes even against the Advice of his Parliament gave them Liberty of Conscience and how did they requite him wich the villainous Contrivance to Depose and Murther him and his Successor at the  RyePlot  KING  James  as if Mercy was the inherent Quality of the Family began his Reign with unusual Favour to them Nor could their joining with the Duke of  Monmouth  against him move him to do himself Justice upon them but that mistaken Prince thought to win them by Gentleness and Love Poclaim'd an Universal Liberty to them and rather discountenanc'd the Church of  England  than them how they requited him all the World knows  THE late Reign is too fresh in the Memory of all the World to need a Comment how under Pretence of joining with the Church in redressing some Grievances they pusht Things to that Extremity in Conjunction wirh some mistaken Gentlemen as to Depose the late King as if the Grievance of the Nation cou'd not have been redress'd but by the absolute Ruin of the Prince Here's an instance of their Temper their Peace and Charity To what height they carried themselves during the Reign of a King of their own how they crope into all Places of Trust and Profit how they Insinuated into the Favour of the King and were at first prefer'd to the highest Places in the Nation how they engross'd the Ministry and  above all how pitifully they Manag'd  is too plain to need any Remarks  BUT particularly their Mercy and Charity the Spirit of Union they tell us so much of has been remarkable in  Scotland  if any Man wou'd see the Spirit  of a Dissenter let him look into  Scotland  there they made entire Conquest of the Church trampled down the Sacred Orders and supprest the Episcopal Government with an absolute and as they suppose irretrievable Victory tho' 'tis possible  they may find themselves Mistaken  Now 'twou'd be a very proper Question to ask their  Impudent Advocate the Observator  Pray how much Mercy and Favour did the Members of the Episcopal Church find in  Scotland  from the  Scotch  Presbyterian Government and I shall undertake for the Church of  England  that the Dissenters shall still receive as much here tho' they deserve but little  In a small Treatise of the Sufferings of the Episcopal Clergy in  Scotland  'twill appear what Usage they met with how they not only lost their Living but in several Places were plunder'd and abus'd in their Persons the Ministers that cou'd not Conform turn'd out with numerous Families and no Maintenance and hardly Charity enough left to relieve them with a bit of Bread and the Cruelties of the Parties are innumerable and not to be attempted in this short Piece  And now to prevent the distant Cloud which they perceiv'd to hang over their Heads from  England  with a true  Presbyterian Policy  they put in for  a Ʋnion of Nations  that  England  might unite their Church with the Kirk of  Scotland  and their Presbyterian Members sit in our House of Commons and their Assembly of  Scotch  canting Long Cloaks in our Convocation what might have been if our Phanatick Whiggish Statesmen continu'd God only knows but we hope we are out of fear of that now  'Tis alled'd by some of the Faction and they began to Bully us with it that if we won't Unite with them they will not settle the Crown with us again but when Her Majesty Dies will chuse a King for themselves  If they won't we must make them and 'tis not the first time we have let them know that we are able The Crowns of these Kingdoms have not so far disowned the Right of Succession but they may retrieve it again and if  Scotland  thinks to come off from a Successive to an Elective State of Government  England  has not promised not to assist the Right Heir and put them into Possession without any regard to their ridiculous Settlements  THESE are the Gentlemen these their ways of treating the Church both at home and abroad Now let us examine the Reasons they pretend to give why we shou'd be favourable to them why we should continue and tolerate them among us  First  THEY are very Numerous they say They are a great Part of the Nation and we cannot Suppress them  To this may be answer'd THEY are not so Numerous as the Protestants in  France  and yet the  French  King effectually clear'd the Nation of them at once and we don't find he Misses them at Home  But I am not of the Opinion they are so Numerous as is pretended their Party is more Numerous than their Persons and those mistaken People of the Church who are misled and deluded by their wheedling Artifices to join with them make their Party the greatter but those will open their Eyes when the Government shall set heartily about the Work and come off from them as some Animals which they say always desert a House when 'tis likely to fall    dly  The more Numerous the more Dangerous and therefore the more Need to Suppress them and God has suffer'd us to bear them as Goads in our Sides for not utterly extinguishing them long ago    dly  If we are to allow them only because we  cannot Suppress them then it ought to be try'd whether we can or no and I am of Opinion 'tis easie to be done and cou'd prescribe Ways and Means if it were proper but I doubt not the Government will find effectual Methods for the rooting the Contagion from the Face of this Land  ANOTHER Argument they use which is this That 'tis a Time of War and we have need to Unite against the common Enemy  WE answer This common Enemy had been no Enemy if they had not made him so he was quiet in peace and no way disturb'd or encroach'd upon us and we know no reason we had to quarrel with him  But further We make no question but we are able to deal with this common Enemy without their help but why must we unite with them because of the Enemy Will they go over to the Enemy if we do not prevent it by a Union with themWe are very well contented they shou'd and make no question we shall be ready to deal with them and the common Enemy too and better without them than with them  Besides if we have a common Enemy there is the more need to be secure against our private Enemies if there is one common Enemy we have the less need to have an Enemy in our Bowels  'Twas a great Argument some People used against Suppressing the Old Money that 'twas a Time of War and 'twas too great a Risque for the Nation to run if we shou'd not master it we shou'd be undone and yet the Sequel prov'd the Hazard was not so great but it might be master'd and the Success was answerable The Suppressing the Dissenters is not a harder Work nor a Work of less Necessity to the Publick we can never enjoy a settled uninterrupted Union and Tranquility in this Nation till the Spirit of Whiggisme Faction and Schism is melted down like the OldMoney  To talk of the Difficulty is to Frighten our selves with Chimaeras and Notions of a Powerful Party which are indeed a Party without Power Difficulties often appear greater at a distance than when they are search'd into with Judgment and distinguish'd from the Vapours and Shadows that attend them  We are not to be frightned with it this Age is wiser than that by all our own Experience  and theirs too  King  Charles  the First had early supprest this Party if he had took more deliberate Measures In short 'tis not worth arguing to talk of their Arms their  Monmouths  and  Shafts  urys  and  Argiles  are gone their  DutchSanctuary  is at an end Heaven has made way for their Destruction and if we do not close with the Divine occasion we are to blame our selves and may remember that we had once an opportunity to serve the Church of  England  by extirpating her implacable Enemies and having let slip the Minute that Heaven presented may experimentally Complain  Post est Occasio Calva  Here are some popular Objections in the way  As  First  THE Queen has promis'd them to continue them in their Tolerated Liberty and has told us She will be a Religious Observer of Her Word  WHAT Her Majesty will do we cannot help but what as the Head of the Church She ought to do is another Case Her Majesty has promised to Protect and Defend the Church of  England  and if She cannot effectually do that without the Destruction of the Dissenters She must of course dispence with one Promise to comply with another But to answer  this Cavil more effectually  Her Majesty did never promise to Maintain the Toleration to the Destruction of the Church but it is upon supposition that it may be compatible  with the well being and safety of the Church ch which She had declar'd She would take especial Care of Now if these two Interests clash 'tis plain Her Majesties Intentions are to Upholds Protect Defend and Establish the Church and this we conceive is impossible  Perhaps it may be said THAT the Church is in no immediate danger from the Dissenters and therefore 'tis time enough But this is a weak Answer  For first IF a Danger be real the Distance of it is no Argument against but rather a Spur to quicken us to prevention lest it be too late hereafter  And dly Here is the Opportunity and the only one perhaps that ever the Church had to secure her self and destroy her Enemies  The Representatives of the Nation have now an Opportunity the Time is come which all good Men ha' wish'd for that the Gentlemen of  England  may serve the Church of  England  now they are protected and encouraged by a Church of  England  Queen  What will ye do for your Sister in the Day that She shall be spoken for  If ever you will establish the best Christian Church in the World  If ever you will suppress the Spirit of Enthusiosm  If ever you will free the Nation from the viperous Brood that have so long suck'd the Blood of their Mother  If ever you will leave your Posterity free from Faction and Rebellion this is the time  This is the time to pull up this Heretical Weed of Sedition that has so long disturb'd the Peace of our Church and poisoned the good Corn  BUT says another Hot and Cold Objector this is renewing Fire and Faggot reviving the Act  De Heret Comburendo  This will be Cruelty in its Nature and Barbarous to all the World  I answer 'TIS Cruelty to kill a Snake or a Toad in cold Blood but the Poyson of their Nature makes it a Charity to our Neighbours to destroy those Creatures not for any personal Injury receiv'd but for prevention not for the Evil they have done but the Evil they may do  Serpents Toads Vipers  c  are noxious to the Body and poison the sensative Life these poyson the Soul corrupt our Posterity ensnare our Children destroy the Vitals of our Happiness our future Filicity and contaminate the whole Mass  Shall any Law be given to such wild Creatures Some Beasts are for Sport and the Huntsmen give them advantages of Ground but some are knock'd on the Head by all possible ways of Violence and Surprize  I do not prescribe Fire and Faggot but as  Scipio  said of  Carthage Delenda est Carthago  They are to be Rooted out of this Nation is ever we will Live in Peace serve God or enjoy our own As for the Manner I leave it to those Hands who have a Right to execute God's Justice on the Nations and the Church's Enemies  BUT if we must be frighted from this Justice under the specious Pretences and odious Sense of Cruelty nothing will be effected 'Twill be more Barbarous to our own Children and dear Posterity when they shall reproach their Fathers as we do ours and tell us  '  You had an Opportunity to Root out this Cursed Race from the World under the Favour and Protection of a true  English  Queen and out of your foolish Pity you spared them because forsooth you would not be Cruel  and now our Church is Supprest and Persecuted our Religion trampl'd under Foot our Estates Plunder'd our Persons Imprisoned and dragg'd to Jails Gibbets and Scaffolds your sparing this  Amalekite  Race is our Destruction your Mercy to them proves Cruelty to your poor Posterity  HOW just will such Reflections be when our Posterity shall fall under the merciless Clntches of this uncharitable Generation when our Church shall be swallow'd up in Schism Faction Enthusiasm and Confusion when our Government shall be devolv'd upon Foreigners and our Monarchy dwindled into a Republick  'Twou'd be more rational for us if we must spare this Generation to summon our own to a general Massacre and as we have brought them into the World Free send them out so and not betray them to Destruction by our supine Negligence and then cry  it is Mercy  Moses  was a Merciful Meek Man and yet with what Fury did he run thro' the Camp and cut the Camp and cut the Throats of Three and thirty thousand of his dear  Israelites  that were fallen into Idolatry what was the reason 'Twas Mercy to the rest to make these Examples to prevent the Destruction of the whole Army  How many Millions of future Souls we save from Infection and Delusion if the present Race of poison'd Spirits were purg'd from the Face of the Land  'TIS vain to trifle in this matter the light foolish handling of them by Mulcts Fines  c  'tis their Glory and their Advantage if the Gallows instead of the Counter and the Gallies instead of the Fines were the Reward of going to a Conventicle to preach or hear there wou'd not be so many Sufferers the Spirit of Martyrdom is over they that will go to Church  to be chosen Sheriffs and Mayors would go to forty Churches rather than be Hang'd  If one severe Law were made and punctually executed that who ever was found at a Conventicle shou'd be Banish'd the Nation and the Preacher be Hang'd we shou'd soon see an end of the Tale they wou'd all come to Church and one Age wou'd make us all One again  TO talk of  s  a Month for not coming to the Sacrament and  s per  Week for not coming to Church this is such a way of converting People as never was known this is selling them a Liberty to transgress for so much Money If it be not a Crime why don't we give them full Licence And if it be no Price ought to compound for the committing it for that is selling a Liberty to People to sin against God and the Government  If it be a Crime of the highest Consequence both against the Peace and Welfare of the Nation the Glory of God the Good of the Church and the Happiness of the Soul let us rank it among capital Offences and let it receive a Punishment in proportion to it  We Hang Men for Trifles and Banish them for things not worth naming but an Offence against God and the Church against the Welfare of the World and the Dignity of Religion shall be bought off for  s  this is such a shame to a Christian Government that 'tis with regret I transmit it to Posterity  IF Men sin against God affront his Ordinances rebel against his Church and disobey the Precepts of their Superiors let them suffer as such capital  Crimes  deserve so will Religion flourish and this divided Nation be once again united  And yet the Title of Barbarous and Cruel will soon be taken off from this Law too I am not supposing that all the Dissenters in  England  shou'd be Hang'd or Banish'd but as in cases of Rebellions and Insurrections  if a few of the Ringleaders suffer the Multitude are dismist so a few obstinate People being made Examples there's no doubt but the Severity of the Law would find a stop in the Compliance of the Multitude  To make the reasonableness of this matter out of question and more unanswerably plain let us examine for what it is that this Nation is divided into Parties and Factions and let us see how they can justifie a Separation or we of the Church of  England  can justifie our bearing the Insults and Inconveniencies of the Party  ONE of their leading Pastors and a Man of as much Learning as most among them in his Answer to a Pamphlet entituled  An Enquiry into the Occasional Conformity  hath these Words P  Do the Religion of the Church and the Meetingbouses make two Religions Wherein do they differ The Substance of the same Religion is common to them both and the Modes and Accidents are the things in which only they differ  P  Thirty nine Articles are given us for the summary of our Religion Thirty six contain the Substance of it wherein we agree Three the additional Appendices about which we have some differences  Now if as by their own acknowledgment the Church of  England  is a true Church and the Difference between them is only in a few Modes and Accidents why should we expect that they will suffer Gallies corporeal Punishment and Banishment for these Trifles There is no question but they will be wiser even their own Principles won't bear them out in it they will certainly comply with the Laws and with Reason and tho' at the first Severity may seem hard the next Age will feel nothing of it the Contagion will be rooted out the Disease being cur'd there will be no need of the Operation but if they should venture to transgress and fall into the Pit all the World must condemn their Obstinacy as being without ground from their own Principles  Thus the Pretence of Cruelty will be taken off and the Party actually supprest and the Disquiets they have so often brought upon the Nation prevented  THEIR Numbers and their Wealth makes them Haughty and that 'tis so far from being an Argument to perswade us to forbear them that 'tis a Warning to us without any more delay to reconcile them to the Unity of the Church or remove them from us  AT present Heaven be prais'd they are not so Formidable as they have been and 'tis our own fault if ever we suffer them to be so Providence and the Church of  England  seems to join in this particular that now the Destroyers of the Nations Peace may be overturn'd and to this end the present Opportunity seems to be put into our Hands  To this end Her present Majesty seems reserv'd to enjoy the Crown that the Ecclesiastick as well as Civil Rights of the Nation may be restor'd by her Hand  To this end the Face of Affairs have receiv'd such a Turn in the process of a few Months as never has been before the leading Men of the Nation the universal cry of the People the unanimous Request of the Clergy agree in this that the Deliverance of our Church is at Hand  For this end has Providence given us such a Parliament such a Convocation such a Gentry and such a Queen as we never had before  AND what may be the  Consequences  of a Neglect of such Opportunities The Succession of the  Crown  has but a dark Prospect another  Dutch  Turn may make the Hopes of it ridiculous and the Practice impossible Be the House of our future Princes never so well inclin'd they will be Foreigners and many Years will be spent in suiting the Genius of Strangers to this  Crown  and the Interests of the Nation and how many Ages it may be before the  English  Throne be fill'd with so much Zeal and  Candour  so much Tenderness and hearty Affection to the Church as we see it now cover'd with who can imagine  'Tis high time then for the Friends of the Church of  England  to think of Building up and Establishing her in such a manner that She may be no more Invaded by Foreigners nor Divided by Factions Schisms and Error  IF this cou'd be done by gentle and easie Methods I shou'd be glad but the Wound is corroded the Vitals begin to mortifie and nothing but Amputation of Members can compleat the Cure all the ways of Tenderness and Compassion all perswasive Arguments have been made use of in vain  THE Humour of the Dissenters has so encreas'd among the People that they hold the Church in Defiance and the House of God is an Abomination among them Nay they have brought up their Posterity in such prepossest Aversions to our Holy Religion that the ignorant Mob think we are all Idolaters and Worshippers of  Baal  and account it a Sin to come within the Walls of our Churches  The primitive Christians were not more shie of a HeathenTemple or of Meat offer'd to Idols nor the  Jews  of Swine's Flesh than some of our Dissenters are of the Church and the Divine Service solemnized therein  THIS Obstinacy must be rooted out with the Profession of it while the Generation are left at liberty daily to affront God Almighty and dishonour his Holy Worship we are wanting in our Duty to God and our Mother the Church of  England  How can we answer it to God to the Church and to our Posterity to leave them entangled with Fanaticism Error and Obstinacy in the Bowels of the Nation to leave them an Enemy in their Streets that in time may involve them in the same Crimes and endanger  the utter Extirpation of Religion in the Nation  WHAT's the Difference betwixt this and being subjected to the Power of the Church of  Rome  from whence we have reform'd If one be an extream on one Hand and one on another 'tis equally Destructive to the Truth to have Errors settled among us let them be of what Nature they will  Both are Enemies of our Church and of our Peace and why shou'd it not be as Criminal to admit an Enthusiast as a Jesuit Why shou'd the  Papist  with his Seven Sacraments be worse than the  Quaker  with no Sacraments at all Why should Religioushouses be more intollerable than Meetinghouses  Alas the Church of England  What with Popery on one Hand and Schismaticks on the other how has She been Crucified between two Thieves  Now  let us Crucifie the Thieves  Let her Foundations be Establish'd upon the Destruction of Her Enemies The Doors of Mercy being always open to the returning Part of the deluded People Let the Obstinate be rul'd with the Rod of Iron  Let all true Sons of so Holy and Oppressed a Mother exasperated by her Afflictions harden their Hearts against those who have Oppress'd Her  And may God Almighty put it into the Hearts of all the Friends of Truth to lift up a Standard against Pride and Antichrist that the Posterity of the Sons of Error may be rooted out from the Face of this Land for ever  A brief Explanation of a late Pamphlet Entituled  The Shortest Way with the  Dissenters  THE Author professes he thought when he wrote the Book he shou'd never need to come to an Explication and wonders to find there should be any reason for it  If any Man take the Pains seriously to reflect upon the Contents the Nature of the Thing and the Manner of the Stile it seems Impossible to imagine it should pass for any thing but an Irony  That it is free from any Seditious design either of stirring up the Dissenters to any Evil Practice by way of prevention much less of animating others to their Destruction will be plain I think to any Man that understands the present Constitution of  England  and the Nature of our Government  But since Ignorance or Prejudice has led most Men to a hasty Censure of the Book and several poor People are like to come under the Displeasure of the Government for it in Justice to those who are in danger to suffer for it in Humble submission to the Parliament and Council who may be offended at it and in Courtesie to all mistaken People who it seems have not Penetrated into the real design The Author presents the World with the Native Genuine Meaning and Design of the Paper which he hopes may allay the Anger of the Government or at least satisfie the minds of such as imagine a design to Enflame and Divide us  The Paper without the least retrospect to or concern in the Publick Bills in Parliament now depending or any other Proceedings of either House or of the Government relating to the Dissenters whose  Occasional Conformity the Author has constantly opposed has its immediate Original from the Virulent Spirits of some Men who have thought fit to express themselves to the same Effect in their Printed Books  tho' not in Words so plain and at length  and by an  Irony not Unusual  stands as a fair answer to several Books Published  in this Liberty of the Press  which if they had been handed to the Government with the same temper as this has wou'd no question ha' found the same Treatment  The Sermon Preach'd at  Oxford  the  New Association  the  Poetical Observator  with numberless others have said the same thing in terms very little darker and this Book stands fair to let those Gentlemen know that what they design can no farther take with Mankind than as their real meaning stands disguis'd by Artifice of words but that when the Persecution and Destruction of the  Dissenters the very thing they drive at  is put into plain  English  the whole Nation will start at the Notion and Condemn the Author to be Hang'd for his Impudence  The Author humbly hopes he shall find no harder Treatment for plain  English without Design  than those Gentlemen for their Plain Design in Duller and Darker  English  Any Gentlemen who have Patience to peruse the Author of the  New Association  will find Gallows Galleys Persecution and Destruction of the Dissenters are directly pointed at as fairly intended and design'd as in this shortest way as  had it been real  can be pretended there is as much Virulence against a Union with  Scotland  against King  WILLIAM  's Government and against the Line of  Hannover  there is as much Noise and Pains taken in Mr  Ss  Sermon to blacken the Dissenters and thereby to qualifie them for the Abhorrence of all Mankind as is possible  The meaning then of this Paper is in short to tell these Gentlemen  That 'tis Nonsence to go round about and tell us of the Crimes of the  Dissenters  to prepare the World to believe they are not fit to Live in a Humane Society that they are Enemies to the Government and Law to the QUEEN and the Publick Peace and the like  the shortest way  and the soonest wou'd be to tell us plainly that they wou'd have them all hang'd Banish'd and Destroyed  But withal to acquaint those Gentlemen who fancy the time is come to bring it to pass that they are mistaken for that when the thing they mean is put into plain  English  the whole Nation replies with the  Assyrian  Captain  Is thy Servant a Dog that he shou'd do these things  The Gentlemen are mistaken in every partlcular it will not go down the QUEEN the Council the Parliament are all Offended to have it so much as suggested that such a thing was possible to come into their Minds and not a Man but a Learned  Mercer  not far from the Corner of  Fanchurchstreet  has been found to approve it  Thus a poor Author has ventur'd to have all Mankind call him Villain and Traytor to his Country and Friends for making other Peoples thoughts speak in his Words  From this Declaration of his real design he humbly hopes the Lords of Her Majesties Council or the House of Parliament will be no longer offended and that the poor People in trouble on this Account shall be Pardoned or Excused  He also desires that all men who have taken Offence at the Book mistaking the Authors design will suffer themselves to think again and withhold their Censure till they find themselves qualified to make a Venture like this for the good of their Native Countrey  As to Expressions which seem to reflect upon Persons or Nations he declares them to be only  the Cant of the Nonjuring Party Expos'd  and thinks it very necessary to let the World know that 'tis their usual Language with which they Treat the  Late KING  the  Scotch Ʋnion  and the  Line of Hannover  'Tis hard after all that this should not be perceived by all the Town that not one man can see it either Churchman or Dissenter  That not the Dissenters themselves can see that this was the only way to satisfy them that whatever the Parliament might think fit to do to restrain Occasional Communion Persecution and Destruction was never in their intention and that therefore they ha' nothing to do but to be quiet and easie  For any thing in the manner of the Paper which may offend either the Government Parliament or private Persons the Author humbly begs their Pardon and  protesting the Honesty of his intention  resolves if the poor People now in Trouble may be excused to throw himself upon the Favour of the Government rather than others shall be ruin'd for his mistakes  A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A DISSENTER AND THE OBSERVATOR CONCERNING  The Shortest way with the  Dissenters  Dissen  PRAY Sir are you the Author of the  Observator  Obser  Suppose it Sir what then  Dis  Nay don't be Angry are you the reputed Author  A  Come off  you Taught me in one of your Papers about  Mr  F  Obs  And what then  Dis  Why I wanted a little Discourse with you  Obs  If it be Civil as you say you are Welcome but you begin odly  Dis  My Questions may be Blunt but you are not bound to Answer them but let that be as you like 'em  First Pray who do you reckon is the Author of this Devilish Book call'd  The Shortest Way  Obs  I shall Answer most of your Questions with a Question I believe and begin with you here  Do you think my Name is Mr  Bellamy  that you take me for  an Informer  Read the  Gazette  there you have the Man with the  Sharp Chin  and a  Dutch Nose  Dis  Ay but Sir we begin to doubt that is not the true Author that he has been only made the Tool of  some other Party who now they find the World Exasperated at it have slipt out of the Noose and left him it we begin to be afraid the thing is a Reality and there is such a design on foot  Obs  Your Answer like Parson  Jacobs  Text ought to be taken a pieces and Explain'd  If you are not sure he is the Author you  Dissenters  have done him a great deal of wrong for you have rail'd at him more than all the rest of the World and charg'd him with more Crimes than 'tis well possible for one Man to be Guilty of  And yet by supposing him not to be the Author yon suppose him to be very Honest to his Friends that he bears all this without discovering them  As for your fears of a real design to put the  Shortest way  in practice upon you no Question there are abundance of People in the World who would be glad there was not one of you left I believe no Body doubts it  Dis  Pray who do you think they are  Obs  Sir your humble Servant no  Bellamy  I tell you not I Sir If I were in a Plot with the Devil I le never Evidence besides Sir I have no mind to have my Nose and Chin describ'd but if you please I'll answer you Negatively who I believe is not concern'd in it  Dis  That may be some Satisfaction Sir  Obs  Not the Queen Sir not the Parliament not the Council not the Army not the Ministers of State not the Government  Dis  Thou art a safe Man thou'lt never go to  Newgate  for Negatives  Obs  No Sir nor for Positives neither if I can help it but you have had your Will at Catechising and I ought to have my turn let me ask you a few Questions too  Dis  You are welcome  Obs  Pray why are you Dissenters Angry at the Book call'd  The Shortest Way  'Tis a little Mysterious Sir  that tho the  Church Men  are Affronted because 'twas Written against them and the  Dissenters  are Affronted because 'tis Wrote against them too I don't well understand it one sort must be Fools that's certain  Dis  I don't care whether I understand it or no he is a  Rogue  a  Villain  and I wish the Government had him if I knew where he was I'd deliver him up and  abate them the    Obs  Spoken like a  Dissenter  truly so that I find you are Angry at him because you don't understand him and the Government because they do  Dis  You are so sharp upon me I do understand a little too I understand he meddl'd with that he had nothing to do with and he is a Man they say who has been the occasion of all this Persecution which is coming upon us by railing at  Occasional Conformity  Obs  If he expos'd you for  Occasional Conformity  'tis what you ought to have Rectify'd your selves that you need not have been expos'd for it and in that he was your Friend for had you took the hint and exploded the Practice there had been no need of an Act of Parliament to force you to it  Dis  But what had he to do with that  Obs  Nay what had Mr  How  to do to meddle with it afterward I'll assure you his Name is down in my PocketBook and when any Man in  England  defends a Cause worse I'll put his name out and put t'others Name in But pray Sir why do you call this bringing Persecution upon you do you suppose the  Occasional  Bill will be a Persecution  Dis  Without doubt it will  Obs  What sort of Persecution can you call it it can't be a Persecution for Conscience sake  Dis  Why so Sir  Obs  Why pray Sir suppose one of your Brethren  Dissenters  who can go to the  Meeting  to Day and to the  Church  to Morrow take the Sacrament to Day  fitting and to Morrow to get a good place go to  Church  and take it kneeling wipe his Mouth and go home to Dinner and so to Meeting again suppose this Gentleman should be put up for  Sherriff  or  Lord Mayor  can this Man pretend Conscience not to Conform I tell you Sir Mr  How  must make a better Answer to the matter before I can be convinc'd you may call it Persecution but it can never be for Conscience sake  Dis  Persecution is Persecution let it be for what sake it will every man ought to be at liberty  Obs  Ay that is true I am for Liberty for every man to serve God as is most agreeable to his Conscience But this is not serving God at all besides Sir I could easily make it appear this Act is for your Advantage if you were a sort of People to be convinc'd  Dis  Pray how Sir  Obs  Why Sir it will purge you of all your half in half Professors That's one thing then it will put all those Gentlemen into a capacity of being in places and Parliaments who tho' by this Act they are separated from you and rejoin'd to the Church because they can conform will still be friends to your Interest in all Publick Concerns and therefore had I been to word the Bill so as to have done most harm it shou'd have excluded all that ever were Dissenters and have forc'd you to continue so and not have accepted your return to the Church without a public Repentance  Obs  Well well you may perswade us 'tis for our advantage but we don't like it and therefore we hate him for medling with it for what had he to do with it  Obs  About as much as you and I have to do with him if a man meddles with what does not concern him that's his Fault and if we who really have nothing to do with him meddle with him that is our Fault let the Government alone with him have you nothing else to talk no  Dis  Why all the Town has talkt of him as well as we  Obs  Yes and reckon'd up all his Faults all the sins that ever he committed in his Life and abundance more be the man who he will and what he will I don't see but the best of us would be loth all the Faults we have should be reckon'd up and writ in our Foreheads as his are  Dis  Oh he has been a most wicked Wretch  Obs  You force a man to be an Advocate for One he has no kindness for a wicked wretch you say why has he been a Thief a Murderer  Dis  No no I don't mean that way  Obs  What has he been Clipper or Coyner  Dis  No no nor that neither  Obs  Has he been a Whoremaster or a Drunkard or a Swearer  Dis  No I can't say so neither but he broke and can't pay his Debts  Obs  If you had said he had broke and won't pay his Debts you had said more to the purpose  But I must do one piece of Justice to the man tho' I love him no better than you do that is this That meeting a Gentleman in a  CoffeeHouse  where I and every body else was railing at him the Gentleman took us up with this short Speech  Gentlemen said he I know this D'  Foe  as well as any of you and I was one of his Creditors and I Compounded with him and discharg'd him fully and several Years afterward he sent for me and tho' he was clearly discharg'd he paid me all the Remainder of his Debt Voluntarily and of his own accord And he told me that as fast as God should enable him he Intended to do so with every Body when he had done he desired me to set my Hand to a Paper to acknowledge it which I readily did and found a great many Names to the Paper before me and I think my  self bound to own it tho' I am no Friend to the Book he has wrote no more than you What do you think of this Story  Dis  Think of it I don't belive it  Obs  I can't help that nor I care not whether you do or no but I assure you after I heard it I never rail'd at him any more  Dis  Ay but I'll rail at him for all that  Obs  You Dissenters are in something like Case with the  Pharisees  when the Question was put to them by our Saviour about  Johns  Baptism whether it was from Heaven or of Men If a Man should ask you of the  Shortest Way  was it wrote for you or against you If you should say for us you would be askt why then are you so mad with the Author And if you should say against you the People would laugh at you for all Men but you see into it and that a Dissenter wrote it you must say therefore we cannot tell and consequently that you rail at the Author for you can't tell what  Dis  But we don't count him a Dissenter  Obs  He has all the Marks of a Dissenter upon him but  want of Brains  Dis  Why are we so empty of Brains pray  Obs  There is reason for it God has given you  Equivalents  Dis  I don't understand you  Obs  That's a further Testimony of your being a Dissenter why if you will have it take it I say  God Almighty would have seem'd unkind to you if he had not given you a great deal of Grace For he has given you but little Wit  Dis  Well  I hope they'll take him still  I should be glad to see him hang'd for it I am sure he deserves it I heard one met him a little while ago wou'd I had been there  Obs  Alone do you mean Sir or to have help'd the other  Diss  Any how so I could but have taken him  Obs  Ay and they say 'twas one of your own Party too and one that wou'd fain have got the  l  but that he drew upon him Frighted him out of his Wits and made him down of his Knees and Swear that if ever he met him again he should shut his eyes till he was half a mile off him  Diss  I don't think he's such a fighting Fellow  Obs  Do you know him  Diss  No not I  Obs  So I thought by your Charity and good Nature I know him not neither but the man has the Government upon his Back already and if they take him they'l avenge your Quarrel for you Let him alone 'tis Ingenerous as I said before in print to triumph over a Man in his Affliction 'Twas but a little while ago he wrote a Book that pleas'd you and then you cry'd him up as much as now you cry him down  Dis  What Book pray  Obs  Why the New Test of Church of  England  Loyalty  Dis  Did he write that Book  Obs  I told you I was no Informer go ask Mr  Bellamy  Dis  Why truly that was a good thing I lik'd it fully 'Twas well done but this cursed  Shortestway  is the Devil he must be turn'd Rogue now what ever he was then  Obs  Why this 'tis to oblige a  Dissenter  if you serve them a hundred times 'tis well but once get your Head in the Pillory for them and they'l be the first to palt you with rotten Eggs what can't you set down one good thing and one bad and ballance with him You understand Accompts well enough but you  Dissenters  are like a Shopkeeper I knew who having Traded Year with a Gentleman and serv'd all his Family and gotten a great deal of Money by him at last the poor  Gentleman fell to decay and owing him  s  the Shopkeeper abus'd him and call'd him all the Knaves and Rogues for cheating him of  s  Dis  No no this has spoilt all  Obs  Well but we'll go back further with you There's the  Reformation of Manners  and the  Trueborn Englishman  there he pleas'd you for certain for he is for reforming your Magistrates  Dis  I don't understand them I am for Reformation as much as any Body  Obs  But what say you to the Legion Paper  Dis  Ay that was a good thing indeed  Obs  Well but if he had been taken in doing that wou'd you not have call'd him as many Rogues then as you do now  Dis  No indeed shou'd I not  Obs  But I don't find you call him one Rogue the less for it now and that's hard  Dis  Well But you see he denies it and challenges you to prove it  Obs  Ay deny it I told you he was no Fool indeed I am not glad I Printed it for tho' it is charged upon him by common Fame I am not for hanging Men upon suppositions as you do  Dis  Well you do well and I think 'tis a little hard  the man is gone  and tho' he has done ill he might mean no harm and so let him alone  I reckon you won't be long before you follow him  Obs  And when I am gone you'll call me as many Rogues as you do him won't you  Dis  No it may be I shan't but I can tell you of some that do already  Obs  It's all one to me common Fame like a common Strumpet jilts every Body but methinks Slander and Reproach out of the Mouth of a Dissenter comes with some more than common ill savour  Dis  They think they have good reason for it upon you  Obs  And I think not pray what are their good Reasons  Dis  For abusing your Friends  Obs  My Friends prithee who are they I know but very few I have and I am very sure I never abus'd them  Dis  They all agree you would not be permitted to write so long but the Party would have ruffled you before now only you court them and please them by a SideWind with your railing at King  William  's Friends sometimes  Obs  King  William  's Enemies you mean look Sir I have as much Veneration for the Memory of King  William  as any of you and do but once prove them to be King  William  's Friends and I'll own all you say and recant all I have wrote  Dis  It's easie to prove they were his Friends  Obs  Pray Sir don't you Tax me with abusing King  William  and abuse him your self I have prov'd sufficiently they were the Nations Enemies Now if you can prove the Nations Enemies were K  William  's Friends you'll make a fine spot of Work on't indeed  Dis  The Nations Enemies That is because being in great places they got as much Money as they could and so would you do and so have all the Favourites that ever were or will be  Obs  When ever Favourites did do or shall get Money by rapine or injustice and oppression of the Subject they were and will be the Nations Enemies and their Soveraigns too  Dis  But what have you to do with it 'Tis none of your Business  Obs  'Tis every Mans business to discover mischief fraud and ill design as much as every Man who first spies Fire has a duty upon him to raise the Neighbours I am a Subject and am Cheated among the rest  Dis  You Cheated why what have you to lose  Obs  Why my Liberty which you said but now every Man had a Right to and my Money when I have it what's that to you how little or much I have and how do you know how much I may have hereafter  Dis  Nay they say you get Money by Railing and so you may soon be Rich  Obs  Then I Rail for something and you get none and yet you Rail Pray who has the best Excuse for it  Dis  He that has the best Reason for it not he that gets the most Money by it  Obs  I believe if you could get Money by Railing you would count it the best Reason in the World  Dis  Why so  Obs  Because you are so willing to Rail at any Body when you know not for what nor why and charge People with Crimes they never Committed of all your Christian Duties you make the least use of your Charity  Dis  Why since you put so hard I can tell the time when you abus'd King  William  himself as openly as you durst speak it or any body dare Print particularly in a Poem of yours call'd the  Foreigners  Obs  How do you prove 'twas mine  Dis  Nay they say 'twas yours you were the Reputed Author as you said in another case  Obs  I tell you there's no People in the World so forward to Condemn a Man upon hear say as the  Dissenters  when they have a Mind to slander a Man they take every thing upon trust 'tis their  Shortest Way  Dis  These Scribling People are always medling with things they have nothing to do with what have you to do with Kings and Favourites or that t'other Fellow with the  Shortest Way  You Pamphleteers are always Quacking with the State  Obs  Come let's turn the Tables now it's my Play what have you to do with Acts of Parliaments you  Dissenters are always thrusting in your Oar too what have you to do to talk of Persecution and Acts against  Occasional Conformity  you are Mountebanking with the State too in every CoffeeHouse Pray meddle with your own Business  Dis  We shall have to do with it when we feel it  Obs  I am perswaded if you were put to it severely few of you would stay to feel it at least few of your Wealthy Members few of Mr  Hows  Mind few of such Dissenters as go from  Meeting  to  Church  and can backstroke and forestroke Communicate on both sides  Dis  I wish they may not but we are afraid 'twill not only be a Persecution but a very long one  Obs  Why then you are beholding to the Author we talkt of for you see he is for putting you out of your Pain but I am of a different Opinion from you in several of your darkest thoughts about Persecution  Dis  Pray what is your Opinion  Obs  I am of Opinion that if your Enemies were true Masters of Politicks they would not Persecute you at all I take you to be a declining Party Toleration will be your Ruin and if God in Mercy to you don't send a Persecution among you you are lost you will all dwindle back into the  Church  again your old stock of Ministers dye off your  Owens Mantons Charnocks Clarksons Baxters  and  Bates  's are gone and Pray what can you name out of the new Generation of your  Leyden  Doctors fit to succeed them  The Occasional Bill at once carries off your Wealthy Members who are the support of your Clergy and as Mr  William  's very well observed at  SaltersHall If the Rich ones forsake you the Party will be weaken'd so as to make you fear the Dissolution of the whole  Indeed the Gentleman was in the right if the Wealthy Members quit the Congregations 'twill make poor work for the Ministers and they like other People Generally do their Work best where they have best Wages  Dis  I thought you had Lov'd the  Dissenters  better than to abuse them at this rate  Obs  I don't abuse them I wish them clear of all their Hypocrites and that there were none among them but what were  Dissenters  for meer Conscience If that were so 'twould make their Enemies at Peace with them they'd never be Persecuted the Government would Cherish them and be as tender of them as they would desire But to be plain with you 'tis your own Pride and Pushing at great things has made you Obnoxious and withall your discovering by an Alternate double fac'd Conscience that while you pretend to Dissent and to have tender Consciences you can nevertheless Conform if you please this makes your Enemies suspect your Honesty and apprehend more trick and design in you than I hope they need Nay this gives your Enemies such advantage against you as you can never Answer  Dis  I do not think any Man ought to be confin'd by Laws and Acts of Parliaments about his Religion  Obs  It may be I think so too but Men ought to be Honest to their own Principles whether there were Laws or no and if I see a Man pretend he can't Conform and upon occasion I find he can it makes me suspect his Honesty and if I once think a Man a Knave I am not to blame to fence my self against him by Laws I tell you an Act of Parliament to keep you Honest can never be call'd Persecution  Dis  Ay if there was no more in it  Obs  If there be any more in it I wish there was not I'm sure I know not what is in it and I believe you don't neither Pray have you seen the Bill  Dis  No not I but I hear 'tis a very Terrible Bill  Obs  True to the old way still  always to Judge before you Hear  Indeed I forgot to ask you but on my Conscience I don't believe you ever read the Book of the  Shortest way  Come be Honest  Dis  Read it why the very Outside of that is enough for any Man to read I thank God I spend my time better  Obs  I think you ought to spend your time better too than to give your Verdict upon any thing before you read it  Dis  You are a strange Man why every body says 'tis a horrible Book and not fit to be read but what's that to this Act of Parliament  Obs  Why thus much 'tis that you cry out Persecution from this Act of Parliament and there's not a word of Persecution in it  Dis  I think 'tis Persecution if I must not be at Liberty to Worship God as I think fit  Obs  Still you are without Book why you may be a Dissenter all the days of your Life and go to Meetings as long as you live and never be troubled by this Act  Dis  I can't imagine what you mean why I must Pay God knows what if I am seen at a Meeting  Obs  Ay Sir that's after you have strain'd your Conscience from the Meeting to the Church after you have bob'd your Religion to be Sheriff of  London  or the like and then want to go back again but if you to keep your Conscience can be content to be without these gay things call'd Places you may be a Dissenter to the end of the Chapter So that this will only be a Persecution for Honour sake not for Conscience sake and never fall upon you neither till you bring it upon your self  Dis  Well I hope it won't pass for all that  Obs  I hope so too but if it don't it must be  the Lords doing and it will be marvellous in our Eyes  Dis  The House of Lords you mean I suppose  Obs  I must mean as you will have me let it be how it will but if I hope it will not pass it's from different reasons with you  Dis  Pray your reasons  Obs  Because I am against and ever shall be Imposing any Religious Ordinance or part of Worship as a Qualification for any Temporal Employment Let the Princes be at full liberty to employ who or what sort of their Subjects they see Cause Such impositions are a Bait to People to Banter their Consciences and to comply with that for a Preferment which otherwise they wou'd not and so seem to lead them into Temptation But I don't know the Contents of the Bill therefore I'll say no more  Diss  And I wou'd not have it pass because I take it to be a Foundation of Persecution 'tis but pulling down the Toleration next and then we are all undone  Obs  You Faithless and Perverse Generation  Has not the QUEEN promis'd to maintain your Toleration Besides what's that to the Bill  Diss  Why shou'd not we be afraid of it as well as some of the ChurchParty have the confidence to  hope  it Nay to condemn the Toleration as Antichristian and threaten us with the having it overthrown  Obs  Why these are for  the Shortest way  you ought to rail at them as much as you do at the Man with the  hook Nose  and  sharp Chin  and more too and no doubt but if you would turn Informer you might hook their Noses into the  Gazett  too to be sure the Government would not allow of it they would never suffer the QUEEN to be so affronted  Diss  I don't know how 'tis such things are suffer'd daily I heard our Parson t'other day say at a Publick Dinner 'twou'd never be well with  England  till some Course was taken to reconcile all Dissenters to the Church  Longest way  or  Sherrest  'twas all one to him he said he hop'd to see the Church  flourish without them and a great deal more and worse than this  Diss  That was a topping highflying Gentleman indeed and why did you not acquaint the Government with it  Diss  What do you think I am an Informer My Name is not  Bellamy  any more than yours but pray why do you make so strange of it Don't we hear daily People expressing their high flying hopes that a Parliament in  Scotland  will restore Episcopacy there and yet has not the Queen given Her word and published it in our  Gazett  that she will maintain the Presbyterian Government there  Obs  Has she so Then tho' they have the impudence to hope you ought not to have the ignorance to fear it The QUEEN gave her Word to maintain it  be not slow of Heart to believe  She has taken up the famous Motto of Q  Elizabeth Semper Eadem  and can you so much as doubt she will deface it for a few  Scotch  Bishops  Diss  I am sorry for my fears I beg Her Majesties Pardon there are so many Turns and Windings in Law and State matters that we know not what to say to things  Obs  Say Why a promise is a promise and you may depend upon it she has never broke her Word with us yet  Diss  Aye but what if the Parliament should do it  Obs  Nay if the Parliament does it we do it our selves  Diss  Very good so that we may be undone and the Toleration Bill taken away and yet the QUEEN be as good as Her Word still  Obs  Yes Sir so you may whenever an Act of Parliament  becomes so without the Royal Assent and when do you think that can be  Diss  Why then these HighFlying ChurchMen are very impudent Fellows to suggest such things of the QUEEN and to bully us with overturning the Toleration and put us in such fears of what they will do to us when it can never be done without the QEEN's acting so directly against Her RoyalPromise  Obs  Well and what then  Dis  Why I think they ought to be us'd as they us'd the Author of the  Shortest Way  Gazetted and a Reward for the Discoverer  Obs  Or as you have us'd him rather  viz Rail at them for being of your own side  you Dissenters are rare Fellows for Punishments if God should have no more Mercy on you than you shew to all Men that offend you we should have  Plagues Pestilence  and  Famine  every Year upon us so now you are come about again these HighFlying  Churchmen  have Bully'd you with the fears of losing your Toleration come confess  Diss  Yes  Obs  And made you distrrst the QUEEN's Veracity  Diss  Yes GOD and the QUEEN forgive us  Obs  And have Terrifi'd you with what things they'll do when they have pull'd down your Antichristian Toleration have they not  Dis  Ay Ay  Obs  And so you thought the  Shortest Way  was Wrote to make a beginning with you and to set the  Dragoons of the Church  upon your Backs did you not  Dis  'Tis very true  Obs  And continued of the same mind like an  Ignoramus  tho' you heard 'twas Wrote by one of your own Party  Dis  Indeed I did  Obs  Now pray after so much patience as I have had with you have a little with me and if I can I'le set you right in your Thoughts of these things  There are a sort of People among the  Dissenters  who can either Dissent or Conform as they find their Inclinations or Interest rather directs them these by their Wealth and Interest have always put themselves into good places and qualifi'd themselves for that purpose by taking the Sacrament Of these People even the most moderate  Church Men  have an ill Opinion and truly so have Two Thirds of your own Friends for it looks as if they were Men of no Principles at all  Against these Men the Act against  Occasional Conformity  is principally design'd and if there was nothing else in the Bill I believe no good Man would be against it  Concerning these things Two sorts of People have been very grosly mistaken and upon their Mistakes have proceeded to Act very Foolishly  First  The high Flying  Church Party  begun to think all was a going their own way and that the Government would fall in with them and do your business for you and away they run with the Notion and Preach you down and Print you down and Talk you down like Mad Men there is Sermon upon Sermon Pamphlet upon Pamphlet One says you are all Rogues and Hypocrites another says you are Enemies to the Government one Flies at the Toleration and tells the World 'tis Destructive to the Nations Happiness and the Politicians must pull it down another says 'tis Antichristian and we cannot be true Sons of the Church of  England  if we don't pull it down others like harebrain'd Huntsmen that over run the Hounds roar you down with full Cry till they run themselves out of Breath others are for having you depriv'd of  Voices in Elections of Parliaments in hopes of Arriving to that Blessed Day when they shall have a Parliament of their own Mind and thus they Run before they are Sent and without Reflecting upon their ill grounded Zeal without examining any Authorities other than their Passions without regard to good manners taking no Notice of the Preamble of the Act of Parliament which Declares against Persecution or the Honour and Sacred Promise of Her MAJESTY given to make Her Subjects easie they blow up the Fire of Persecution and Destruction whether the Government will or no  You are the next sort of People who are mistaken for being Naturally a little Hypish as the Beaus call it troubled with the Spleen and Hypocondriack Vapours this Cloud of Raillery so darken'd your Understanding that you presently take these People and the QUEEN these People and the Government these People and the Parliament to be all of a mind and the QUEEN having displac't all your Friends as 'tis but just  That all Princes should employ who they please  And the Parliament falling on your  Occasional Conformers  and this Book of  the Shortest way  coming out altogether the high Church Party Thundred at you from the Press and the Pulpit Away you run with the Notion that you are all to be blown up that all these Things aim'd at your Destruction and that Fire and Faggot was at the Door  But the Government is steady and the QUEEN still has maintained her Motto the Parliament steers in the middle way going about to restrain but not to destroy you and taking no notice either of the heat of one party or Folly of the other they hold the Ballance of your Liberty between your exorbitant License and the other party's unchristian Fury and in my opinion thus far are you safe  Dis  But then why has not the Government thought  fit to disown the Zeal of these Highflyers by punishment and make Examples of some of them  Obs  I told you the Dissenters were all for Punishments and Examples for the same reason that they have not punished you for supecting the QUEEN's Honesty to her word charging the Parliament with going about to persecute you and the like for this reason because they are more merciful than both parties deserve  Dis  'Twould have convinc'd us very plainly of two very significant Things  First  That there is such a Design and then that the Authors of it receiv'd no Countenance from Court  Obs  Good Manners and Common Justice ought to have convinc'd you of the last and your Author of  the Shortest way  to his Cost open'd your Eyes in the first if you had not wilfully shut them against the Light  Good Manners would inform you not to doubt the Word of your Prince 'till you had some reason from Her MAJESTY her self  Common Justice commands us to suppose every Person just and honest till something appears to the contrary and it is a very unchristian uncharitable way of teaching the QUEEN That because some of the high Churchmen have had the Indiscretion without her Authority to swagger you out of your Senses therefore you must suppose her Promise broken and her Word of no value  The Author of  the Shortest way  comes with a Lanthorn for you and he sums up all the black Things this high Party had publish'd into one General and if you had any Eyes you might learn two Things from  which he is like to pay dear enough for teaching you  First  From the general abhorrence Mankind shewed of the Book you might learn that the destruction of our Party is a Cruelty not to be found in the  English  Nature  Secondly  From the Outcry made against it by that Party in particular you might learn who they were that were toucht in the Book and where the design against them lay  As to the Quarrel you Dissenters have at the Book  That's a Mystery no Man can Unriddle but your selves  'Tis like Mr  Mead  's Wheel within a Wheel and a further Testimony to the World that you are a most unaccountable People whose ways are past finding out  Dis  So that you would go about to perswade me the Book was writ of our side  Obs  First  Sir 'tis hard to know what side you are of and  Secondly  Sir I know you too well to go about to perswade you to any thing whose peculiar Talent is to be unperswadeable but if you will please to answer me a few Questions you may perhaps perswade your self of something or other  Dis  What Questions  Obs  Why are the high Churchmen angry with him while at the same time they openly declare 'tis the only way to deal with you and what they would feign be at  Dis  Truely you puzzle me a little there  Obs  They are angry because they take the Book as the Author meant it and you because you take it as he wrote it they as he meant  viz to expose them  and tho' they are heartily willing to do you a Kindness that way and have shewn their good Will by their words yet knowing they wanted Power to Execute it and being conscious to themselves that the Government was not of their Opinion they are enrag'd to have all their designs laid open in Minature and an Abridgment communicated to the World in  true Billingsgate  Dis  There may be some truth in this but Pray why then is the Government so angry with him I believe I have puzzled you now  Obs  No no the Government may have Reasons to be Angry that You nor I know not of nor have nothing to do with But what if I should suppose  That the Government not thinking any Person could be so Barbarous to harbour such a Villainous Design as the Book suggests are displeas'd at it as an affront done to the  Church of England  to Father Principles of Cruelty and Destruction upon her Members which they are not guilty off  I say if I suppose this to be a Reason I believe you cannot suppose a better  Dis  I confess I begin to have better Thoughts of the Government than I had  Obs  I'm glad of that  Dis  I begin to hope they won't Persecute us now and as for  Occasional Conformity  what care  I I  shall never be Lord Mayor or Common Councilman If I am call'd to it 'tis time enough to come off then  Obs  God Almighty is wonderfully beholden to you when he calls you from a middle State to a good place you'll take it for granted He calls you from the Meeting to the Church and you'll be sure to come But I tell you you ought to be so far from the fear of a Persecution that if you have any respect to your Party you ought to pray for a Persecution upon them or ye are all undone  Dis  Why thou art mad thou art for the  Shortest Way  Obs  No no I an't for such Persecution neither but I told you my mind before I am sure you haue received more damage in your Interest as Dissenters and more weakned your Reputation as well as your Number since the late Tolleration than ever your Enemies did for you by all the Penal Laws Informers Fines and Prisons of the last Persecution  Dis  Well but here's another danger upon us that we han't talk of yet and fear it will come upon us too  Obs  Pray what's that  Dis  We are affraid that this restless Party will overthrow our Settlement for they do not stick to talk that way  Obs  We affraid who do you mean by we Are not the  Church of England  as much concern'd in the Settlement as you and more too as they are the major part of the Nation And We if you will give me leave to talk your way We Protestants fear nothing for our Settlement and for this I'll give you a Quotation from the Man with the hook Nose and sharp Chin it may be you won't like it because of the Author but his words are these  The Settlement of the Crown says he is the Basis of our  Religion Laws  and  Liberties  This is the solid Bottom on which we all stand and of which with Respect to Civil Right may be said  Other Foundation can no Man lay than that which is laid  'Tis the Rock on which we are all Built and that Stone of which according to the Scripture it may without Prophaneness be said  Whosoever it falls upon he will be broken to pieces but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to Powder  'Tis the last thing the People of  England  will part with after all their Estates Wives and Children Churches and Houses are destroyed  'Tis the Pledge of the Divine Goodness to the Nation which they purchas'd at the expence of    Millions of Money and the Blood of above    Englishmen in eleven Years War  'Twas one of the great things King  William  did for us and the Treasure God and His Majesty left in our Hands in trust for our Posterity which if we part with our Children will curse our Memory and digg us out of our Graves  'Tis a thing so Sacred the dissolving of it cannot be mention'd without a Crime nor so much as intended without being Guilty of Treason in the most intense degree  'Tis the Solid Prop upon which stands Her present Majesties Throne and the right and just Title She has to Govern us  'Tis like the two Pillars in the House of  Dagon  whoever pulls them down will like  Sampson  be Buried in the Ruins and pull the whole Nation upon their Heads  I Fear nothing for this Settlement the Parliament of  England  are the Trustees for the seeing it forth coming to the People of  England  and a Parliament of  England  will never betray their trust  The Parliament will not and all the rest of Humane Power dare not attempt to dissolve it no Weapon form'd against it can prosper  Dis  Is this done by our  Shortest Way  Man  Obs  The very same  Dis  Well I shall love him the better for it But there's one thing more still what say you to the Prince of  Wales  If ever he comes again you'll be Hang'd that's for certain  Obs  And if ever we let him come we ought all to be Hang'd I can do no better than refer you to the same Author  The Act of Settlement says he and the Prince of  Wales  are  the two Bucketts  keep one but up and the other must be down and put the one down and the other comes up of Course There can be no pretence made to alter or dispose the Settlement but the bringing in the Prince of  Wales  therefore whoever they are that mention it we ought to suppose they wou'd be so understood  Dis  So that you are of Opinion we are in no danger of our Settlement  Obs  Indeed I am of the Opinion your Fears both of the Prince of  Wales  and of altering the Settlement and of Persecution are all groundless and equally so I would only advise the Dissenters to be honest to their own Principles if they can conform they ought to do it if they cannot no body forces them let them  dissent and not for the desire of preferment bring such a Scandal upon their integrity as if they were Men of no Principles 'Tis scandalous to the very Name of a Dissenter and injurious to all the rest of that Body who are honest and conscientious  And so I bid you Farewel  LEX TALIONIS  OR AN ENQUIRY INTO The most Proper Ways to Prevent THE PERSECUTION OF THE Protestants in  France  EƲROPE  has now for nine Years past been afflicted with a Bloody a Cruel and a Destructive War carried on with a vast Effusion of Blood and Treasure and in all Parts of it manag'd with more Eagerness and Fury than any War among  the  European  Princes ever was in the Memory of Man  The  French  who are Masters of Address used all the Skill and Cunning with the Roman Catholick  Princes  especially those of  Italy  to have made it pass for a  War of Religion  thinking by that fineness to have drawn them off from the Confederacy But  Innocent  XI who 'twas likely knew as much of Religion and the Interest of the Church as the Statesmen of  France  saw through that Artifice and readily agreed with the Emperour and the King of  Spain  That the Growing Greatness of  France  and the Measures laid for the Subjecting  Europe  to her Government were really more dangerous things and of more immediate Consequence to the Publick Liberty than the Matter of Religion could be And therefore tho' the Court of  Rome  made some seeming Difficulties at first yet the  French  having thrown off the Mask and fallen upon his Catholick Confederate the Duke of  Savoy  the most Bigotted Romanist made no scruple to entertain the Heretick Soldiers to recall the banish'd  Vaudois  to fight under the Command of  Protestant  Generals to accept of the Subsidial Supplies of  Protestant  Money and the protection of  Protestant  Armies thereby evidently declaring to the World that this was a War of State not of Religion and that the real Interest of  Princes  is to preserve themselves and their Subjects against a too powerful  Invader  by Leagues and Assistances let their Religious Interests be what they will  Nor have the  Protestant Princes  tho' their Forces in this Confederacy have been much Superior been backward to push on the Common Interest with their utmost Vigour but have with extraordinary chearfulness assisted the Roman Catholick Confederates with their Armies Fleets and Moneys witness the Subsidies paid to the Duke of  Savoy  by the  English  and  Dutch  the Army maintain'd under the Command of Duke  Schombergh  in  English  pay in  Piedmont  the Forces Ship'd from  England  to  Catalonia  to aid the  Spaniard  which sav'd the City of  Barcelona  a whole Year Witness also the  English  Fleet Wintering at  Cadiz  under Admiral  Russel  the Squadron sent to the  WestIndies  to Relieve  Carthagena  And indeed the whole Series of the War has been one continual Instance of the Safety and Protection the Roman Catholick Countries have enjoy'd by the Sword and Power of the Protestant Interest  So that it has been apparent beyond the power of Contradiction that this has been a War of State not a War of Religion Nor can I imagine generally speaking that it can ever be the Interest of the  Powers  of  Europe  take them together to Commence a War of Religion For tho' 'tis true That the  Pope  always Exalted both his  Power  and  Credit  in the blind Ages of bigotted Devotion by his Crusadoes and Holy Expeditions yet since the World has more Years over its Head and the Cheat has been discovered  Int'rest  has prevail'd too much upon Devotion to be deceiv'd any more at that rate And the Reformed Kingdoms of  Europe  are too potent to be us'd so any more  'Tis true the  Protestant  Religion has lost Ground in  France  and that Kingdom where once the  Protestants  were Strong enough to Contend with their Governours for their Liberty is now wholly  Roman  at least seems to be so But notwithstanding that I believe the Protestant Interest in  Europe  very well able to stand a shock with the Popish when ever the Pope thinks fit to publish another  Bloody Jubilee  and  display  the Standard of St  Peter  against St  Paul  And not to descend to particulars I shall only Draw up the several Kingdoms on each Side who would form this Great Division in Case of such a War  On the Roman Catholick Side  There would be the Emperor the Pope the King of  France  the King of  Spain  the King of  Portugal  the King of  Poland  the Princes of  Italy  Five Electoral Princes of  Germany  and the Catholick Cantons of  Swisserland  On the Protestant Side  The King of  England  King of  Denmark  King of  Sweden  the Czar of  Moscovy  States of  Holland  Three Electoral Princes of  Germany  but those by far the Strongest the Protestant Cantons of  Swisserland  the  Grisons Hungarians Transilvanians  and  Moldaviaens  In the first place I think it wou'd easily be granted That the  English Dutch Dane  and  Swede  United wou'd be able to Maintain so absolute a Dominion of the Seas as would entirely Ruin the Negotiation of the Catholick Party Beggar their Merchants Starve their Islands and Destroy all their Trade They should never be able to Build a Ship without Leave their Ports should be Bombarded and Destroy'd their Open Country be Ruin'd by Descents and all their Coasts continually Harrass'd and Alarm'd by Fleets and Volant Parties  What the Armies at Land could do I referr to the History of the Present War and of  Gustavus Adolphus  King of  Sweden  who barely on a War of Religion and with only his Own single Force and the Protestant Princes of  Germany  who were then much Weaker than they are now in Two Years and a half pass'd the  Rhine  and the  Danube  and shook the Imperial Crown on the Head of  Ferdinand  the Second  It would take up too much room in this short Treatise to Consider the Proportion of the Force of these  Nations in general 'tis true that the weight of the Force of the Catholick Party lies in the Power of the  French  who must in such a Case be the Bulwark and Support of their Cause  As to the  Spaniard  he wou'd as he has in all Cases have Work enough to  Secure his Own  the Empires separated from the Protestant Party with the  Swede Dane Brandenburghers Saxons  and all the Prince of the  Augustane  Confession on its Front with the Protestants of  Ʋpper Hungaria  and  Transilvania  in the Rear with the  Switz  and  Grisons  in the Flank wou'd be very hard bestead having no Power but the  Bavarian  and the small Electorates of  Ments Triers  and  Cologne  which are of no Consideration to uphold it Some Support might be drawn from  Italy  indeed but the  French  must give a powerful Assistance or the Emperor would be Devoured in two Campaigns the  English Dutch  and  Eastern Germans  as the  Lunenburghers  of  Hannover  and  Brunswick  would be the Opposites to the  French  on this side and there the Contention would be strongest  I believe no Wise Man wishes for so Universal a Distraction as such a War would make in  Europe  but 'tis needful to suppose such a Thing in order to Examine whether we ought to apprehend any Danger from it in case such an Attempt shou'd ever be made in  Europe  for 'tis apparent some Princes of the Roman Catholick Party have Will enough to such an Enterprize and the Pope would be forward enough to set it on Foot if he were but sure of the Success  The glorious Peace of  Reswick  in which all the World must acknowledge the  French  have been very much reduc'd has but One Clause that any way Eclipses the Honour of its Conclusion on the Protestant side and that is that it left the Poor Protestant Subjects of the King of  France  without any shelter from the Violences of their Persecutors as if the  Protestant Princes had so much excluded the Int'rests of Religion from the Articles that they had not one Compassionate Thought for their Distressed persecuted Brethren 'Tis true the War was wholly  a War of State  as is before noted and the Invasion of Property was the Occasion of it and therefore the Surrender of  Luxemburgh  to the  Spaniard  who is a Roman Catholick nay a few Villages in the  Chattelany  of  Aeth  made more Bustle in the Treaty than the Restoration of Three Hundred Thousand banish'd Christians to their Country and Estates  Some have presum'd to say That had the Restoration of the Edict of  Nants  been insisted on with the same Vigour as the Dutchy of  Lorrain  it wou'd as easily have been obtain'd and these People among whom some of the  French  Refugees are of that Mind think the Protestant Int'rest was not so much Considered in that Treaty as it ought to have been I cou'd easily Answer such Objectors by telling them That the Ground of this War being only Matter of Right to reduce the Power of  France  to a Balance and to oblige her to restore what she had by Force and Injustice taken from her Neighbours this being obtain'd the End was answer'd and the Confederate Princes had no farther Pretence for a War As to the Protestant Refugees they were the Subjects of the King of  France  and strictly speaking with respect of Princes no body had any thing to do with it let him use them how he would  Besides to have made it an Article of the Peace it could not be expected that the Catholick Branches of the Confederacy would have insisted on it or indeed have desired it and the Treaty being Manag'd in one Body by the Resolutions and Measures of several Princes and States in Congress the Catholick Princes would have immediately protested against it and the Union must have been Dissolved  So that there was no room to Espouse the Interests of the Protestant Subjects of  France  in the General Treaty any other Way than by Intercession with their King to use them Mercifully And this has been done by all Parties tho' hitherto without Success  It remains now to examine what Methods are further to be used in order to oblige the King of  France  to use his Protestant Subjects with more Humanity and if possible either to preserve them that Peace and Enjoyment of their Properties and Estates which is their Natural Right or to procure them some other Equivalent which may give them some kind of Satisfaction and Repose  To Commence a War against the King of  France  for the Prosecution of His Protestant Subjects seems to be very Unjust because Speaking of Right and Wrong we are not Interested in the Quarrel I make no Question but the Protestants of  France  themselves have by the Laws of Nature and Reason a right to Defend their own Possessions and Inheritances and to Maintain themselves in them by Force if they had a Power and by the same Rule might by Strength of Hand recover and take Possession of their own Rights be they never so Just Only thus far 'tis plain That by the particular Article of the Peace of  Reswick  respecting the Kings of  England  and  France England  is foreclosed from such an Attempt both Sides having expresly Stipulated not to Assist the Subjects of either against their Soveraign The Fourth Article of the said Treaty ptoviding as follows  viz  And since the most Christian King was never more desirous of any thing than that the Peace be Firm and Inviolable the said King Promises and Agrees for Himself and His Successors That he will on no Account whatsoever disturb the said King of  Great Britain  in the free Possession of the Kingdoms Countries Lands or Dominions which He now Enjoys and therefore Engages His Honour upon  the Faith and Word of a King that He will not give or Afford any Assistance directly or indirectly to any Enemy or Enemies of the said King of  Great Britain  and that He will in no manner whatsoever favour the Conspiracies or Plots which any Rebels or illdisposed Persons may in any Place Excite or Contrive against the said King and for that End Promises and Engages That He will not Assist with Arms Ammunition Provisions Ships or Money or in any other way by Sea or Land any Person or Persons who shall hereafter under any Pretence whatsoever Disturb or Molest the said King of  Great Britain  in the free and full Possession of His Kingdoms Countries Lands and Dominions The King of  Great Britain  likewise Promises and Engages for Himself and Successors Kings of  Great Britain  That He will Inviolably Do and Perform the same towards the said most Christian King His Kingdoms Countries Lands and Dominions  There seems to be but one way left either to make any amends to these poor desolate People or to bring to pass their Readmission I do not say that the Princes of  Europe  will find it their Interest to put it in practice any more than I believe it is really the Int'rest of the King of  France  to Ruine so many Thousand Families of his Peaceable Subjects I mean  the Old Standard Law of Retaliation  But if it might be a Means to reestablish those poor People in Peace and Liberty the Sacrificing Ten Thousand Families of other Persons as Innocent as them seems to be a Justice their present Case calls for  Lex Talionis  seems to me to be the FoundationLaw of Right and Wrong the Scripture is full of Instances of this Nature  Adonibezek Agag  declare it to be agreeable to the Divine Method of Executive Justice the reason of Rewards and Punishments seems to be wholly measured by it and if exactly administred it carries so convictive a Force that no Person who ever fell under the severest part of it could object against  the Execution of it  Adonibezek  abovementioned made a Confession of the Justice of his Punishment when his Thumbs and great Toes were cut off as a Retaliation of his Barbarities  Judg  And  Samuels  Return upon  Agag  That  as his Sword had made Women Childless so should his Mother be Childless among Women  declares both the Reason and the Justice of Gods Decree against him  Sam  xv  'Tis true this Retaliation is strictly Personal and all Retaliation ought to be so if possible But in some Cases it differs and where a Personal Retaliation is not practicable then People are considered in Collective Bodies Nations Families and States Thus in a War the Subjects of either Party account is very justifiable to make themselves satisfaction for Injuries received on any of the Subjects of the contrary Party tho' the Wrong particularly suffered is not chargeable on those particular Persons who suffer for it  By the same Rule it seems justifiable if we cast the whole Body of  Europe  into Two sorts  Popish  and  Protestant  that while the one part commit Hostilities and Depredations on the other the injur'd Party should have a Right of Retaliation on any Member of the same Body of what Nation or Government soever they shall be where the Power is properly put into their Hands for Power in such a case may pass for a sufficient Right of Directing the said punishment since nothing but want of  Power  interrupts its being  Personal  The  French  King has given a Challenge to all the  Protestant Princes  of  Europe  in his present Usage of the Reformed Churches of  France  He has carry'd on tho' not with much Success a War for above Eight Years against the whole United power of  Europe  at last he has made a  Peace  not at all to his Advantage nor much for his Honour And now the War of State is at an end he seems to be beginning a War of Religion  and that he may lay the Foundation of it safely he has began it upon his own Subjects  I cannot imagine why all the  Protestant Princes  of  Europe  should not think themselves concern'd in this Invasion of their Religion since nothing is more certain than that they are all strook at tho' more remote+ly And by all the Rules of Human Policy prevention ought to extend as far as the Evil is design'd  If the weakening the  Protestant Interest  in general were only the Design the strengthening that Interest ought to be the care of the other Besides the  Papists  are the Aggressors as they always have been and the Injustice of their Cause so great that they have hardly ever attempted to make any other pretences for all their Barbarities than the Absolute  Will  and  Pleasure  of their  Omnipotent Monarch  who  will have but one Religion within his Dominions  I confess to me it seems very proper for the Ease of all  Parties  That Religion should really divide the whole Body of  Europe  and that all the Roman Catholicks and all the  Protestants  if they could but agree it among themselves should live by themselves That if the  French  King will have no  Protestants  in his Dominion the  Protestants  should suffer no Roman Catholicks in theirs and when all  Parties  are withdrawn to their own sort and the Division compleated let the Roman Catholicks begin a War of Religion as soon as they please  It is in my Opinion the unjustest thing in the World that since the  Spaniards  and  Italians  suffer no  Protestants  to live amongst them but the Bloody  Inquisition  destroys them and the  French  have Dragoon'd Three Hundred Thousand of their  Protestant  Subjects to  Mass  and hurry'd Three Hundred Thousand more out of their Country to seek Comfort from the Charity of Neighbour States The Duke of  Savoy  has Exil'd all his  Protestant Vaudois  And hardly any  Popish  Country admit the  Protestants  among them some few parts of  Germany  excepted yet the ProtestantGovernments at the same time suffer Three Millions of Papists to live among them and enjoy their Liberties and Estates unmolested  Nor is this all the Protestants of  France Savoy  and  Hungary  have been persecuted under the Assurances of the most solemn Treaties the most sacred Edicts and the firmest Peace that could be made they have never their Enemies themselves being Judges been guilty of the Breach of their Faith or Loyalty  Henry  III of  France  acknowledged it when he had recourse to them for Protection against his own mutinous Catholick Subjects The Duke of  Savoy  acknowledged it in his Speech to those  Vaudois  whom he had Released out of the Citadel of  Turin  We never read of any War begun by the Protestants they were always Defendants We have not one Instance of a Massacre committed or a King Assassinated or of Nobles Undermined in order to be blown up by them they have always been Men of Peace till SelfDefence has oblig'd them to be Men of War On the contrary the RomanCatholicks have been always uneasie to the Governments they have lived under Our Histories are full of their Treasons  Ireland  has twice been Deluged in Blood by their Rebellions and Cruelties Two Kings of  France  have been Murthered by their Assassinations and innumerable Protestants Massacred and Butcher'd in cold Blood under the pretences of Friendship and assurance of a Treaty  The Reigns of all our Kings and Queens in  England  since  Henry  VIII have been strangely disturb'd by the Plots the Treasons and Rebellions of the Papists they have often forfeited their Estates and Liberties to the Publick Justice of the Nation had they been dealt with by the Rules of strict Retaliation  England Scotland  and  Ireland  have such Reasons for Entire removing them out of their Dominions as no Nation in the World can have greater and yet here they live in Peace under the protection of those very Princes they refuse to swear Allegiance to and under the shelter of those Laws they refuse to be bound by 'Tis no Plea in Bar of any Right that the  Plaintiff  is a  Papist  our Courts of Justice are as open to them as to any of the Kings most faithful Subjects Of which more hereafter  On the contrary the Protestants of  France  tho charg'd with no Disloyalty nor guilty of no Crimes are Dispossess'd of their Estates Banish'd their Native Country Dragoon'd Shipt to the Gallies and many of them Hang'd their Children torn from them by Violence and buried alive in Monasteries and Nunneries and all the Cruelties an unbridled Soldiery can inflict acted upon them without any manner of Crime alledg'd but their Religion and this when that very Religion was secur'd to them by the solemnest Leagues and Treaties in the World Declared in the famous Edict of  Nants  Entred Receiv'd and Registred in all the Parliaments of the Kingdom  The King of  France  in persecuting his  Protestant  Subjects acts not only the part of a Tyrant over them as they are his Subjects but is guilty of the Breach of the Faith and Honour of a King oppressing those  People  who had their Religion tolerated and allow'd to them by his Ancestors in the most sacred manner possible and he is also guilty of the greatest Unkindness to those very  People  who were the Instruments and Agents of the Glory of his Family and of his Person  To make good which Reflection that I may not seem to be guilty of Disrespect to the Majesty of the King of  France  'tis needful to examine a little the  Ground on which the  Protestant  Interest in  France  stood for the last Century of Years and the History of the present Royal Family of  France  and how they came to the Crown  In the Year on the th Day of  August Charles  IX being King of  France  the Third War with the  Hugonots  having been lately ended and a Peace made with the Protestants the Cities of  Rochel Montauban Coignac  and  la Charitie  being put into their Hands for Security and the Chief of the Protestants wholly resting on the Faith and Honour of the King in full Satisfaction of his sincere Intentions being come to Court was acted the Massacre of  Paris  at which in the space of Five Days above Thirty Thousand Protestants were barbarously Surprized and Butcher'd in Cold Blood  Upon which follow'd the Fourth and Fifth Civil War during which King  Charles  IX died and the Crown fell to  Henry  III the last of the House of  Valois  and then newly Elected King of  Poland  The Beginning of his Reign being entangled with Civil Broils the  Protestant  Interest grew very strong and tho' the League forced the King to make Three several Wars with them yet they still maintain'd their Liberty and Religion  At length the Faction of the  Guises  known by the Name of the  Catholick League  Declar'd themselves so absolutely against the King and grew so powerful especially after the Death of the Duke and Cardinal of  Guise  whom the King had caused to be kill'd that they had almost driven him out of the Kingdom In this Exigence the  Protestants  against whom they had carry'd on Four Persecutions and Wars and therein destroyed many thousands of their Brethren undertook his Defence and joining all their Forces in order to Restore him marched with him to the very Gates of  Paris  where while he was preparing for a  general Attack of the City he was barbarously Assassinated by  Jacques Clement  a  Jacobin  Monk sent out of the City on purpose being stabb'd in the Belly with a Poynard of which he died the Day after  Henry  IV the present King's Grandfather was then King of  Navarre  and a  Protestant  and being Lawful Heir to the Crown as also recommended to the Nobility by the deceased King at his death took upon him the Stile and Title of  King of France  The  League  back'd by the Power of the King of  Spain  oppos'd him with all the vigour imaginable and many of the Catholick Nobility deserted him on the Account of his being an Heretick  The  Protestants  serv'd him with all the Glory and Loyalty that ever was shown perhaps in any War in the World and as is computed during the Years War he maintain'd against the  League  and the  Spanish  Power above an Hundred and Sixty Thousand Protestant Soldiers lost their Lives in his Service At length to put an end to the War and assure himself of the Kingdom he deserted his Religion and turn'd RomanCatholick by which means he obtain'd a full Possession of the Crown ruin'd the League the Chief Heads of it making their Peace with him one by one and at last concluded the War with the  Spaniard  at the Peace of  Vervin  The  Protestants  however never withdrew their Loyalty nor their Services from him The famous Mareschal  de Biron  the Dukes  de Bouillon du Plessis  and  de la Tremouille  continuing to do him the most faithful and important Services against the  Spaniards  to the last  Having settled himself in the Kingdom and made peace with all the World the  Protestants  who had serv'd him so faithfully and who expected no other Reward than the Security of their Religion and Estates obtain'd from him the famous Edict of  Nantes  in which  is particularly stated and stipulated the Terms of their Liberty in what places they should erect their Temples how they should hold their Synods and Assemblies Money was allotted out of the publick Revenues to maintain their Ministers Cities were allotted to them for their Security the Garrisons whereof were to be paid by the King And the Edict was made perpetual and Irrevocable by being Entred and Registred in the  Parliaments  and Courts of Justice all over the Kingdom  But all the Services of the Protestants to this Great King by which he was brought to the Crown of  France  nor the solemn Engagement of this Edict could not preserve them but that in the Ministry of Cardinal  Richlieu  under the very next Reign they were again attack'd and driven to the necessity of taking Arms in their own Defence Which Cardinal after three times making Peace and breaking it again at his pleasure compleated the Conquest of them in the Taking of  Rochelle  the Protestants being miserably deserted by the  English  and Thirteen Thousand People Starv'd to Death in the Town  Since this in the Infancy of the present King while the Contests between the Prince of  Conde  and the QueenMother were so hot as to break out into a War the Protestants as Subjects only were not a little instrumental to the maintaining him in that very Power which now he makes use of to their Destruction  I think this History fully makes good the Assertion that the present Usage of the Protestants is both Perfidious and Ungrateful Perfidious as being acted while under the Protection of a Sacred League and Solemn Treaty and Ungrateful as it is exercised on those very People who with their Lives and Estates raised the present Fortune of the House of  Bourbon  to the Greatness it now enjoys  I have been the more particular in this Account because  from hence it will appear that the Protestants of  France  stand on a different foot from other Subjects of that Monarchy and that his right of Dealing with them differs from his Power over the rest of his Subjects for they are his Subjects by express Stipulations and Agreements whose Obedience to him has been always allow'd to be Conditional they have made Peace and War with their Kings not as Rebels but as Persons having a Lawful Right to Plead and to Defend their Kings have given them Cautionary Towns for the Performance of the Treaties made with them a Thing which in its own Nature implies that they might hold those Towns against him if he did not perform the Postulata of those Treaties without the Scandal of Rebellion  So that their Right to the Liberty of their Religion had an Authority sufficient to justifie them in taking Arms nor does any of the  French  Histories that ever I saw tho' wrote with the greatest Partiality ever call it a Rebellion but a War with the  Hugonots  and the Conclusions were always call'd  A Peace with the  Hugonots as is Evident thro'  D' Avila  's whole History of the Civil Wars of  France  The History of the Protestants of the  Ʋpper Hungary  and of  Bohemia  might in many respects bear a parallel with this the Persecutions and illUsage of them having been after the solemnest Agreement and Treaties with them that could be made insomuch as that poor Unhappy People being so absolutely separated from any Relief of their Brethren of  Germany  have been forced to fly for Protection to the Enemies of Christianity the  Turk  with whom however they have this Satisfaction that whatever Bargain they make for their Religion they are sure they will keep it And I remember very well a Banished  Hungarian  Minister told me Discoursing of this very Case  he was sorry to say it That the Turks tho' they made them pay Dear for it  were Juster and Truer to their Leagues and Treaties than the Imperialists who call'd themselves Christians  It may possibly be objected here That while we Exclaim against the  French  and  Germans  for their Violence to their Subjects if we should do the same thing to the Papists it would be Practising what we Condemn and doing Evil that Good may come  The Answer to this is included in what goes before  viz  taking the whole Roman Catholick and Protestant Party in  Europe  asunder and considering them as two Collective Bodies divided in Interest and Religion it seems to me to be just that a Retaliation of the Injuries done upon the Members of one Party in one place may be made upon the Members of the same Party in another place by the same Rule that Depredations of the Subjects of one Prince in War may be paid by Reprizal upon sny of the Subjects of the same Prince  But this may be more fully answer'd thus That if the Popish Subjects of some Protestant Governments have so behaved themselves to their Governors as to make their Extirpation just that Justice however suspended in Mercy to them hitherto will absolutely justifie removing them from those Governments and by that means  Lex Talionis  be Executed by the Hands of Publick Justice and one Banishment be at the same time both a Punishment of their several Crimes and a Retaliation of the Oppressions of their Party This is a Method God Almighty often takes himself while he suffers a Punishment for a publick Crime of less Guilt to be the Executor of his Vengeance for some Crime of a higher Nature not known  To go no farther than  Ireland  for an Instance of this the present Inhabitants I mean the Popish  Irish  by a Bloody Massacre of Two Hundred Thousand  Protestants  in by little less intended and as much as they were able executed this late War have deserved no doubt to have been used at the Discretion of the  English  and  Oliver Cromwell  was more than once consulting to Transplant the whole Nation from that Island If he had done it or if it had now been done I am of the Opinion no Nation in the World wou'd have Tax'd us with Injustice and I do verily think  Oliver  Acted with more Generosity than Discretion in omitting it for this is certain that if he had done it this last War and the Expence of so much Treasure as it cost this Nation and the Ruine of so many Thousand  Protestant  Families who were driven from thence by King  James  all the Destruction at  LondonDerry  the Sickness at  Dundalk  and the Blood of people who at least one way or other on both sides perish'd in it had been prevented  It may be enquired whithere  Oliver  design'd to Transplant them I could answer directly to that also but 'tis sufficient to my purpose to say had he clear'd the Island of them it had been no matter at all to us whither they had gone and the King of  France  has set a Rule for such as Banish their Subjects to let them go where they please and then they certainly separate whereas had he sent the  Protestants  to any particular place they wou'd have been so many and so United they might possibly have come back again with Swords in their Hands and ha' bidden fair for another  Hugonot  War  I have also seen among the Letters of State written by Mr  Milton  who was his Secretary for the Foreign Dispatches a Letter written to the States of  Holland  wherein by way of Argument to prevail for some Ease to the  Protestants  of  Piedmont  he proposes a Confederacy with the  Dutch  and all their Reform'd Friends to reduce the Duke of  Savoy  to a Necessity of giving better Conditions to the  Vaudois  and seems to Threaten to Expel all the Roman Catholicks in  Engiand Scotland  and  Ireland  out of his Dominions I remember upon Discoursing of this passage in some Company  one asked  What if he had  and another by way of Repartee made Answer  Then there wou'd have been none left  I repeat it not for any great Wit in the Answer but to Introduce the Question  What if he had  If he had possibly we had not been troubled with any  Popish Plot  in nor none of the Bloody Consequences of it we had had no  ShamPlot  upon that no  Russel Sidney  nor  Armstrong  Murthered no Blood lost in an Invasion by the Duke of  Monmouth  nor Cruel Executions in the West we had had no  Popish  Successor no Standing Army no Bishops sent to the  Tower  no Invasion of Charters nor Priviledge of Universities no Ecclesiastical Commission  c  We had had no Nuncio from  Rome  to take his Progress over the Kingdom no FireWorks for a ShamPrince of  Wales  nor no Mass Sung in  Windsor  Chappel no Seminaries or Priests nor Nunneries of Whores at  Chelsea LincolnInn Fields  or  Hammersmith  In short we had had no War of Nine Years to restore a Popish King the Nation had not spent Millions Sterling nor lost of the Stoutest of her Inhabitants to Maintain her Liberty King  William  had been King in Right of his Wife and a Peaceable Admission had been given him  In all probability this had been the Consequence if  Oliver Cromwell  had sent them all out of the Kingdom  I beshrew his Heart he did not  I do not pretend to lead my Reader to any Political Reasons why this shou'd be done now our Governours are best Judges of the publick Interest But thus far I think may be assumed without danger of Religion  If the Nation shou'd think fit in Compassion to the Miseries of our poor Distressed Brethren of  France  to Retaliate their Usage upon the Roman Catholicks of  England  and  Ireland  the following Consequences would in all probability ensue which whether it wou'd be just in the whole or Beneficial to  England  and  Ireland  in particular I leave to the Judgment of Impartial Readers to Consider  It might be a means by the Intercession of Parties to procure some reasonable Conditions for the poor  Protestants  of  France  as the Stopping the Mareschal  Boufflers  at the Surrender of  Namure  procur'd Justice to the Imprisoned Garrisons of  Deinse  and  Dixmude  This is a Practice too well known in the War to need any Contention where the putting a Prisoner of War to Death or any other Breach of Articles has been requited buy putting some other Prisoner of War to Death on the contrary Side and tho' the latter be an innocent Person  Lex Talionis  is the Word the Justice of it is not disputed  It wou'd put these Kingdoms in a Condition to Entertain and Relieve that great Multitude of Distressed Christians with the very Substance of their Adversaries and the King of  France  might if he pleas'd make the Roman Catholicks Amends by giving them the Estates of the  Hugonots  or what other Way he thought fit  This is most certain that the Roman Catholicks of  England  wou'd not have half the Reason to Complain of hard Usage that the  Protestants  of  France  have they have no Leagues or Capitulations to show for their Permission the Laws of the Kingdom are expresly against them and they have in all Reigns for Years past been the Disturbers of the Peace of it they refuse now to Swear Allegiance to the Government and if they do not Disturb it it is Owing to their want of Power not their want of Will  But if they had all those Defences to make which have been hinted on behalf of the  Protestants  of  France  they wou'd have no body to thank for such Usage but  their own Friends And the Pope if he ow'd them so much Care might use his Interest with the King of  France  to let the  Protestants  enjoy their Liberty in order to save them from the same Fate  Some indeed object against the receiving such vast Numbers of Foreigners among us as Prejudicial to the Interest of Trade and to our own Manufacturers and Inhabitants by Eating the Bread out of our Months and Starving our own Poor  This is an Argument would require a little Volume to Answer but in General I presume to Affirm That no Number of Foreigners can be Prejudicial to  England  let it be never so great Number of Inhabitants is the Wealth and Strength of a Kingdom and if we had a Million of People in  England  more than we have let them be of what Nation they would it would be far from being a Damage to us  'Tis true if these Million of People were all Artisans Manufacturers it would be some detriment to our Poor who are employ'd in those particular Manufactures But allow one third to be Artisans one third Labourers Husbandmen or Sailors and one third Merchants Shopkeepers or Gentlemen and if the greatest Number that can be supposed came to settle in  England  it could be no Injury but a vast Advantage to the Kingdom in general And it will appear by this One particular well examin'd  An Addition of a Million of People suppose that were the Number would devour a proportion'd quantity of Corn and Flesh for Food and Drink and a proportioned quantity of Manufactures for Cloth and Housholdstuff the one employs more Land and the other more People Now 'tis apparent we have in  England  more Land lies unimprov'd common and waste than would feed a vast many People more than we have and we have a Staple of Wooll never to be exhausted In Manufactures the more Lands we improve  the greater the Rents will be and the greater the general Stock of the Nation will be and the more Manufactures are made the better the Poor are employ'd and the Richer the Manufacturer is made  Many other Arguments might be used to prove That the coming Over of Foreigners can be no general prejudice to the Nation as to Trade But that is not the main thing here If the Roman Catholick Princes pursue their  Protestant  Subjects with such Cruelty and drive them into Banishment and Exile to seek Relief in Foreign Countries the Case seems to speak for it self the  Protestants  can have no readier way either to prevent the Miserics of those poor persecuted People or to relieve them in their Exile than by dealing with the  Papists  in their Dominions in the same manner and Inviting the said persecuted  French  to come and live in the Estates and in the Places of their Adversaries This is  Lex Talionis  And this is a way that would soon tire the  Papists  out For I think I may be allowed to suppose there are much the greater number of  Papists  among the  Protestants  than there are of  Protestants  among the  Papists  and the Exile of the Parties would also dister as to Place For generally speaking the  Protestant  Countries are the best for Strangers to live in the  Protestant  People are the Trading People of the World therefore the Exile of the  Protestants  of  France  and  Hungary  would be less to their disadvantage than the  Papists  of  England Ireland  and  Holland  who must apply themselves to Countries where there are few Manufactures small Trade and but very indifferent Means for a Stranger to Live So that the  Popish  Exiles would be in much the worse Circumstances And there is no question but whenever the  Protestant  Princes of  Europe  shall find it needful to use this Remedy the RomanCatholick Powers will find it for their Interest to make some Cartel or Condition upon which all their Subjects tho' they  are  Protestants  may enjoy some sort of Liberty in their own Native Countries and so Persecution as well as War might end in an an Universal Happy Peace to  Europe  both in Matters of Religion as well as Civil Affairs which has so often been attempted by other Methods to so little purpose  A LETTER to Mr  HOW  By Way of REPLY TO HIS CONSIDERATIONS OF THE PREFACE TO AN Enquiry into the Occasional Conformity of DISSENTERS  SIR  AFTER such an Account as you have given of your self in the Five first Pages of your Book with the Aversion you have to any thing which shou'd interrupt you in your more  Recluse  Studies I presume no Man cou'd imagin you would break thorough your own Measures to attack a  poor Prefacer  as  you call me and wholly quitting the Argument amuse the World and content your self to Lash the Author with the Severity of your Wit  Herein Sir I must own that not only your Opponent but all the Town seem Disappointed exceedingly that Mr  How  who thinks the Subject not worth Answering shou'd trouble his Head or spend his Time about the Impertinence of a  sorry Prefacer  When I Address'd the Preface to you I thought I had so carefully Revis'd both it and the Book that as I mention'd to you I cou'd nowhere be Tax'd with Exceeding the Rules of Charity and Good Manners  And tho' I wou'd always make them both my Rule yet I thought my self oblig'd to it more now than ordinarily by how much the person to whom and the persons of whom I wrote were equally known and very much valued by me and I did not question but I shou'd either not be Reply'd to at all or it wou'd be done with the Charity of a  Christian  the Civility of a  Gentleman  and the Force and Vigour of a  Scholar  But since it seems good to you Sir to descend so far below your self as to quit the Dispute offer'd and fall upon me personally and to mix Raillery and Reproach with your Argument  which I am sure you know too well to think betters the Cause  You must blame your self Sir for Obliging me in my own Defence to be a little freer with you than otherwise I shou'd have thought had become me  Nor Sir shou'd I have engag'd with you even in my own Defence knowing I am to struggle with so unequal a Match both as to your Learning and Reputation had I not seen your Book differ so much from your constant Character and pardon me Sir for the Word  in many Places from the Truth  And since I am oblig'd thus publickly to Animadvert upon my Superiors for such I own you to be both in Learning and Office  I shall ask your Leave to lay down several Mistakes upon which I must be allow'd to suppose you have gone in the Censures which you have made which Suppositions I draw from the whole Tenour of your Writing  I presume Sir that you are mistaken in these Four Points in the  Person Temper Profession  and  Intention  of the Author  Which Mistakes I shall venture to suppose are the Reasons which moved you to treat your Adversary with so much indecent Contempt  As to my  Person  and  Temper  'Tis true Sir I have chosen to conceal my Name and tho' bating Humane Frailty Sins and Misfortunes I know no Reason why the Argument should be asham'd of the Author or the Author of the Argument Yet when I consider'd how constant a practice it is in the World to Answer an Argument with Recriminations instead of Reasonings I thought it best to continue retir'd that the Case I had enter'd upon might not come clogg'd with the dead Weight of the Meanness and Imperfections of the Author  I need not go back to the Instance of our Saviour whose Arguments were Confronted with the Contempt of that Question  Is not this the Carpenter's Son  For I find that even Mr  How  himself wou'd have search'd my Character to have compleated his Remarks with Personal Reflections  And yet I cannot imagine what Relation my Name has to the Argument it cou'd be only useful to furnish you with something in my Character to Reproach me with which  God knows you might have found enough of  But what wou'd all this be to the Point in hand The Occasional Conformity of Dissenters is not Condemn'd or Defended by the Names of Authors on either side but by Truth Scripture and Reason  Thou was't altogether born in Sin  says the HighPriest  and the Elders of the  Sanhedrim  to the Poor Man whom Christ had healed  and doest thou Teach us  And yet the poor Man was in the Right and if I am so tho' I was the meanest and most scandalous of Scriblers is my Argument the worse  But Sir to Answer all those Particulars and let you know that I am not altogether so shy of my Name as you imagine I shall give you a Genuine honest Account of my self and then my Name is at your Service  First Sir I am to tell you that I am and acknowledge my self to be possess'd with a strong Aversion to Doubling and Shifting in Points of Religion and do think that the Case in hand is be allow'd no less And therefore wrote the Enquiry with Two very honest Designs  viz  To see if by Strength of Argument I cou'd receive Satisfaction and to Explode and as far as in me lies to Oppose the Practice  Secondly Had your Book given me or any Body else that I can meet with  whose Judgment is to be valued  the Satisfaction I desir'd I assure you I am so little fond of an Opinion because it is mine that I shou'd not have been asham'd to have own'd my self mistaken and possibly have shown as much Humility in Acknowledging it as you think I have Pride in Opposing  As to Personal Miscarriages and Misfortunes of which no Man has more and which perhaps may weaken the Reputation of the Author but I am sure ought not of my Argument To them I shall only say God  in his Merciful Providence has heal'd the Last and I hope has Pardon'd the First  And if so I am upon even Terms in point of Reasoning  By this you may see I am sensible of the Beam in my own Eye and have for some years taken up the part of a Penitent on that very account but did never understand that thereby I was barr'd from Enquiring into what I judg'd Scandalous to the Profession of a  Party in General of whom  though unworthy I  was a Member  Nor Sir am I anywhere guilty of Judging another where the Case is not so plain as that it really seems to speak it self For I must remember also that we are no more to call Good Evil or Evil Good than we are to Judge one another  Thus Sir I am gone over my own Character and shall only demand this from you of Right That so far as Truth and Honesty is on my side it may not nor ought not to be despis'd for being usher'd in by an unworthy instrument  And 'tis strange Sir that you who Animadvert upon me for Judging should so severely judge me and that wrongfully too as shall appear in the Particulars of this short Discourse  I cou'd not be satisfi'd to say less to this point on these Accounts because I must put in a  Caveat  against Personal Reflections as unfair in the Dispute He that pleases first to Confute the Argument is welcome to show his Wit in Satyrizing upon the Follies and Afflictions of the Author And there I leave it and proceed to what I conceive is your third Mistake about me  Viz  My profession And this you seem to make plain while from the th to the th page you treat me as an Independent and spend your time to Reply to the p  rticular Te  en  s in dispute between You and Them which with Submission I conceive to be nothing at all to the purpose  After this  P  I am talk'd with as a  FifthMonarchyman  and  Leveller  what of these  Principles  any where appears in the Enquiry I confess I am at a loss to know nor Sir have you been so kind to lay it down  Indeed I own my self somewhat surpriz'd to see you run on in Answering the scrupulous Independent  about  Kneeling at the Sacrament  and the Extravagant  FifthMonarchyman  about seizing the Properties of Mankind for the Use of the Saints and such things as these by way of Reply to an  Enquiry about Occasional promiscuous Conformity  and am still at a Loss to find an Antecedent to this Relative  I assure you I am no  Independent  nor  FifthMonarchyman  nor  Leveller  You have shown your Learning Sir and Confuted an Error inconsistent with Civil Society Very well but this had been better done by it self it had no more relation to the Case in hand than a Lecture against the  Alchoran  and you may as well conjecture me to be a  Mahometan  as a  FifthMonarchyman  from any thing in the Book that looks like either But Sir since I am led by you to give an account of my profession which I hope I shall always be ready to do I shall do it in few words That I am of the same Class and in the same Denomination of a Dissenter with your self your Office excepted and am willing to be guided by and to practice the Great Rule of Christian Charity in all the proper and legal Extents of it Indeed I have more need to practice it than you because I stand more in need of it from others with respect to the Causes already nam'd And however by wresting Words and mistaking my Intentions you are pleased to see nothing of it I am not yet convinc'd that I have broken that Great Christian Rule of Charity in any thing I have written  I come now to the Fourth Thing in which you are mistaken which is in my  Intentions  in which you rashly and I assure you wrongfully judge me however cautious you wou'd have me be of judging others But Sir  Humanum est Errare  you are no more Infallible I see than I and are fallen into the same rash Error you Reprove me for with so much Severity by judging that the principal Design of this Book  was to reflect upon a Worthy Gentlemen who is nam'd in the  Preface  And in one place you are pleased to join me with the Party who Oppos'd him and bring me in making my Court to them  All these Sir I shall make appear to be not only Mistakes but groundless Mistakes such as nothing but the same Thoughts which put you out of Temper cou'd lead you into And I can solemnly Appeal in the Form you have set down that you have wrong'd me in your Censure  First Sir the  Enquiry  was publish'd Three years ago and therefore cou'd not be design'd as a Personal Invective against the Gentleman you speak of All that can be said is That the Cause being again given the Reprinting it was design'd as a Reproof to the Practice and so much I own As for  Persons  I am indifferent  if the Coat fits any Body let them wear it  Secondly Sir I declare my self if of any Party I am and ever was for the  English  Liberty and for the putting such Men into Magistracy who in Concurrence with the King our Supream Magistrate wou'd protect and preserve that Liberty And as a Person every way qualified to execute a Trust of so much Honour whether profitable or not I won't examine I gave my Vote for Sir  Thomas Abney  and shou'd ha' done so If I had the power of Ten Thousand Voices and no Man has more Respect for or Opinion of his Honesty and Ability than my self Nor have I God be thank'd any Occasion to say this to flatter him  for I neither want his Favour nor fear his Anger  Herein therefore I presume to say you have been entirely mistaken and these Errors have led you to waste your Time and the Reader's too in making needless Remarks and Answering those People who never Oppos'd you  I come now to that part of your Book which respects the Case in hand which as it is the least part and indeed seems to agree with the Title that it is only a  Consideration  of the Preface  for really with submission there is very little Answer to the Fact  So it requires not that I shou'd Reply to the Argument for I see none but that drawing back the Curtain which you have spread over the Subject I shou'd set it in a True Light that all Men may judge by their own Consciences and the ScriptureRule and take care they be not distinguish'd out of their Reason and Religion by the Cunning and Artifice of Words  Please therefore Sir to admit me to run over your Book with as modest Animadversions as my just Defence will allow and I am content to stand Corrected where I fail in point of Decency  First You quarrel with me for a  Breach of Kindness and Equity in hiding my own Name and Revealing yours Designing my self to fight in the Dark and expecting you to do it in open Light  And you give us Five whole Pages including the Quotation of your self in your Preface to the Inhabitants of  Torrington  to show your indifferency in Controverted Disputes and consequently your Unwillingness to engage in this  Truly Sir as to the First I thought a publick Appeal to you who are a publick Person had been no Sin apainst Kindness or Equity if it be I ask your Pardon  As to my Concealing my Name I have given you my Reasons already and as to my Exposing yours had you thought fit to have Replied to the Book which lay Three years unanswer'd without being address'd to any person in particular you had been at Liberty to have remain'd as unexpos'd as the Author  But the Enquiry being unanswer'd gave some people more prejudice against the Integrity of Dissenters in general than I cou'd wish to have found upon  which I thought it necessary to have the Matter discuss'd if possible and knew no Man more concerned to do it  nor more capable than your self  Nor is your Answering me such a Disappointment as you are pleas'd to mention but that you shou'd attempt it and do it to no more purpose is I confess more Disappointment to me than any thing I cou'd ha' met with  Whether Sir the Indifferency you are so pleas'd with in your Temper be Congruous to your Profession as a  Gospel Minister I  shall not examine Whether you that are Pastor of a Dissenting Church and Administer the Ordinances of Christ to a Select People in a way Dissenting from the Establish'd Church and thereby maintain a Schism in the said Establish'd Church ought to be so indifferent as to boast that you never perswaded any Man to Conform or not to Conform I leave it to your self to consider I am sure if I was arriv'd to that Coldness in the matter my self I wou'd Conform immediately for I think what I affirm'd in the  Enquiry  Page remains a Truth unanswer'd by you  That Schism from a True Establish'd Church of Christ is a great Sin and if I can Conform I ought to Conform  From this Declaration of your own indifferency to meddle in Matters of Controversie with your Reasons for it which I suppose you wou'd have taken as Introductory to what follows you are pleas'd to proceed  very angrily  to examine why I engage you in this Quarrel I have given you an Account of it already with all the Honesty and Plainness I can and I thought a Person in your Place wou'd never have Resented the being put upon the Defence of his Profession or being Civilly ask'd a Question about it and I cannot but observe how carefully you avoid being engag'd in the present Dispute  I ought to have been well assur'd you say  That you did advise one way or the other  Or  That you ought to have done so  Really Sir I think it immaterial whether you  were  or on or whether you  ought  or no for I never Charg'd you with the first or affirm'd the last but only ask'd this fair Question  Whether it was allow'd by Dissenters in general or by your Congregation in particular To which Question you give no Answer  But I shall answer you honestly and directly I am assur'd as far as Rationally I can be by consequences of things  that you have not advised one way or other  Nor do I affirm you ought to have done so unless the Person concern'd applied to you for Advice in Point of Conscience on the Case if he did I do not see how you could decline it So that to me it seems you either were oblig'd or not oblig'd as the Application of the Person concern'd might alter the Case I do not say you were oblig'd officiously to tender your Advice in the Case  If I am wrong here I shall acknowledge my Error when I am better inform'd  The next thing will come close to the Point Whether it be a  Fault  an  unlawful Action  or no for a Dissenter  as such  to hold Occasional Communion with the Establish'd Church and at the same time continue in or return to his Relative conjunction with a Separate Church  That it is not a sinful Act simply to have Communion with the Establish'd Church I willingly agree But since on this Point depends the Weight of our present Dispute I must conclude That I think 'tis a sinful Act circumstantially and conjunctively  And because I wou'd be rightly understood I shall endeavour to be Explicit tho' I run the hazard of being counted impertinent  I have laid down the Case I thought fairly and of which you are pleas'd to take no Notice in the  Enquiry  Page  He who Dissents from an Establish'd Church from any other Reasons but such as these That he really believes the said Establish'd Church is not of the purest Institution but that be can serve God in a Form more agreeable to his Will and that accordingly 'tis his Duty to do it so and no otherwise Such a one ought to Conform because to make a Wilful Schism in the Church is doubtless a great Sin and if I can avoid it I ought to avoid it  If then I am guided by this real Principle of Conscience to Dissent how can I Conform without Sinning against that Conscience by which only my Dissenting is made Lawful  And thus Sir I am brought to my Argument again Of which I shall give you this short Abstract and you or any body else are welcome to be angry with me if you will be pleas'd first to Answer it  That he who Dissents from the Establish'd Church except from a true Principle of Conscience is guilty of a great Sin  That he who Conforms to the Establish'd Church against his Conscience is guilty of a great Sin  That he who both Dissents and Conforms at the same time and in the same Point of Religion must be guilty of one of these great Sins  That he who has committed either of these Sins ought not to be receiv'd again on either side on any other Terms than as a Penitent  I do not examine as I hinted then whether the Gentleman you would embroil me with be thus guilty  be that to himself  But I must now come to your Distinctions Indeed Sir I believe as you say that taking which side you will you may puzzle the most of plain people who are but of ordinary Understandings in the Controversy about Ceremonies And give me leave to add That such is the Subtilty and Nicety of Sophistical Reasonings that Men may almost Distinguish themselves  into and out of any Opinion and some People who are Masters of the Art of Nice Arguing too often lose both Themselves and their Religion in the Labyrinchs of Words  School Divinity and Practical Christianity are Two things  and seldom understood by the same Heads  But Sir with the greatest Respect and some Concern let me tell you I did not think to find all the Difference between the Dissenters and the Church of  England  dwindl'd into  Three additional Appendices in which we have some Difference and so  and this from Mr  How  who is Pastor of a Separate Church  If we differ from them in Trifles or have but a Trifling Difference I think we can never justify making so large a Chasm in the Church we have much to answer for without question in the too fatal Divisions of this Nation if it has all been occasion'd by a few small Appendices  If our Differences are not Matters of Conscience I have no more to say if they are 'tis a Mystery yet hidden from the Common Understandings how they can be first insisted on from a Principle of Conscience and then wav'd without acting against that Conscience which only could justify the first insisting on them If you can Distinguish us into this I am mistaken  I allow your Distinctions of Sins which are Consistent or Inconsistent with the Christian State to be Orthodox and Right  I allow your Distinctions of Negative and Affirmative Precepts and according to my weak Talent agree with you in them  But the Consequence you draw with submission does not reach the Case which is That scrupulous Persons ought to be fully perswaded in their own Minds and FellowChristians were not to Judge but to Receive them  This you have answer'd your self  P  to be meant in dubious and small Matters And if we must stick here we are next to Examine Whether the Difference between Us and the Establish'd Church be only in dubious and small Matters if it be I know not how we shall Ward off the Below of being guilty of Schism the Sin of which I suppose you will not dispute Wherefore to descend to some ParticularsIf I know why we Dissent from the Establish'd Church 'tis principally on such Accounts as these  On account of the Episcopal  Clarkson  's No ScriptureEvidence for Diocesan Bishops  Hierarchy Prelatical Ordination and Superintendency  On account of their imposing things own'd to be indifferent as Terms of Communion  On account of their imposing things own'd to be otherwise indifferent as made necessary by the Command of the Civil Magistrate  As to Partial Conformity Dissent in some things and Conforming in others which you mention  Page  it does not seem to concern this Case No Man among the Dissenters I believe pretended to Dissent in every thing but we are speaking of Conforming in those very Points in which we Dissent and that no less than the  Article of Communion  If these are your small things I am content to stand by it and ready to prove as I said in the  Enquiry  That whoever Separates from this Church and at the same time Conforms to it by Conforming denies his Dissent being Lawful or by his Dissenting Damns his Conforming as Sinful  All this Sir you have not thought fit to touch upon for Reasons which you know best and I really wonder you shou'd take so much pains to Cavil at me and a simple Preface which really was not worth your while and when you have led your self into the Argument take no notice of the thing it self as it is Objected  but Distinguish so nicely about the smaller matters and omit the greater  If we differ from the Establish'd Church in small things only we are to blame to make the Breach so wide Was it for small and dubious Things only that we suffer'd Process of the Law Excommunications Seizures of our Estates and Imprisonment of our Persons And since you are pleas'd to bring in that Honourable Gentleman speaking in the first Person to the Point as an Inference drawn from your Distinctions and your self telling us what he may perhaps do  Give me leave to go through those Supposititions Cases with you Sir  As to the particular Person you concern him in it not I  You say  He may have Arguments so specious that supposing he Err may Impose upon the Judgment and thereby Direct the Practice of a very Intelligent Discerning and Ʋprighthearted Man so as to make him think that which is perhaps an Error his present Duty and so not offer Violence to his Conscience  I Answer Admit he does so yet while you at the same time allow  he Errs  that is Sins why ought not he to be admonished to Repent of that Sin before he be receiv'd again into Communion This is what I mean by being receiv'd as a Penitent You grant  P  a Man is to do the part of a Penitent for a Fault and this Error is a Fault though it were an Error of Ignorance  Then you say  P    As judging such a Church true as to Essentials he may think Occasion inviting he hath greater Reason though it be Defective in Accidents to Communicate with it sometimes than to shun its Communion always  Pardon me Sir I must say this seems a Sophism in Religion for allow he may think so you must allow he ought not to think so And why  Occasion inviting  Why not  Occasion compelling  'Tis manifest For  cou'd not  compel  why shou'd  Occasion invite  I confine not my Argument to this Gentleman but of Others I can prove That Force cou'd not  compel  them but Occasion that is Honour and Preferment cou'd  invite  them Now if you please to Reconcile this for me I shall be gotten over one Point Whether a Man can justify suffering to the Ruin perhaps of his Family rather than comply with that which he may do without imposing upon his Conscience and which Occasion inviting he may judge lawful  You have another Distinction which I confess hardly think to be Rational that is Unprofitable Preferment  Page  First I neither understand that the Instance you are upon is Unprofitable nor believe it nor that the Epithite can be proper to the word for that which is unprofitable cannot be a Preferment  I must also observe here Sir that the Conformity exacted in the late Reigns was not so large as what these Gentlemen are pleas'd to comply with voluntarily Now as to the Ceremonies you insist on and which indeed I do not as the way of Administration Kneeling  c  it was allow'd to be so indifferent than that many receiv'd in the Church Standing But when these  Unprofitable Preferments  as you please to call them invite they seek of themselves what before they cou'd not be forc'd to  You ask us another Question  What if some have thought  that  alone a sufficient Reason for their Occasional Communion with a Church with whom they have not a constant Communion That they may testify to the World they Decline it not as no Church but so far practically own it as the Reason of the thing requires may not be supposed to do this as thinking it a good Reason whether it be so or no without going against Conscience herein  Truly Sir I must suppose these  It may be's  and  Why may not's  are put in to make out what you said  Page  that you cou'd puzzle a mean Understanding  both ways and I thank God you are driven to the Necessity of these Arts But to let you see these Suppositions may be replied to  Sir the Church of  England  however must own Her self very much oblig'd to such Gentlemen who will Conform only to Vindicate her Reputation  They may be supposed to do thus but they cannot be supposed to do so without a manifest gross ignorance and taking that for a good Reason which is none at all For if Sir you will admit that a Man is in the Right as to himself while he thinks he is so then you open the way to the fatal Latitude of all manner of Error for no Man is guilty of an Error as an Error but as his Judgment may be perverted to believe himself right when he is wrong  Page  you are pleas'd to Object for me  Since Sir you think it not unlawful to Communicate with such a Church sometimes why shou'd you not for Common Order sake do it always  Sir if you please to give me leave to ask Questions for my self I wou'd state it something more fairly to the Case in hand thus  Since Sir you think it not Unlawful to Communicate with such a Church sometimes why shou'd you not to avoid the just Imputation of Schism which is a great Sin have done it always  And why never do it but when upon an Occasion of Preferment inviting you find it necessary to protect you from the penalty of the Law  I shou'd ha' been very glad you had stated this Question fully and suppose what Answer you please for  upon my word  I  can suppose none  unless I wou'd bring him in owning the Crime and repenting of it which I shou'd be glad to hear of  What you say I shall stare at Page I  willingly admit that what is simply best may not be best for Practice in present Circumstances  And I must likewise remind you Sir That what may be simply Lawful may be  unlawful  Circumstantially  And so I affirm this to be and dare undertake to prove it so without coming in the Number of  Solomon  's Fools with whom you have rank'd me for  proposing hastily beyond Seven Men that can render a Reason  Here Sir  viz  at your th Page I must leave you to combat with the  Independents  and let them answer for themselves I am not at all concern'd in the Quarrel  And you spend three or four  Pages  as an Advocate for the  Church  of  England  concerning Modes and Gestures in which I am sure I am far from placing the least Weight where serious  Christianity  is to be found and God forbid either you or I Sir shou'd be found making a Rent in the  Christian  Union of this  Church  and Nation if their Kneeling at the Sacrament or the Use of a Liturgy were all the Dispute 'tis you have led me into saying any thing of the Difference between the National  Church  and the Dissenters  I know that the  of the Primitive Church included the Forms of their Administrations and Publick Services and need not recite my Authorities for it to you who know it better than  I  nor that they are found in the Time of  Tertullian  and long before him But I know also and the contrary has never been prov'd that those Forms were not impos'd as Terms of Communion and under the Penalty of Laws at least till the Divisions of the Church between the  Arrians  and the Orthodox when Error and Persecution got into the Church and the Evil Spirit Reign'd to the Destruction of both sides  And now Sir I find you no more talking to me till you come to  Page  where you are pleased to Satyrize upon my Title and Preface  Really Sir I believe my self capable to Defend my Book against all that the Power of Cavil and Sophistry  can suggest and therefore I am not sollcitous for my Preface and TitlePage  But that I may satisfy your Request and telling you first that you oblige me to it I shall be plain  You desire me to examine my own Heart what I meant by that Suggestion in Cases of Preferment mentioned in the Title was it not to insinuate that Preferment was the inducement to that Worthy Person to act against his Conscience  Sir Will you be pleased to  Examine your own Reason  how that can be when the Words were printed Three Years before the Fact and I Appeal to God and the World whether you have not wrongfully Judg'd me then But to make it more plain  I do not say he or any Body else does it for Preferment  you are pleas'd strangely to mistake me  I say they may have the Preferment without it  'Tis done to save their Money to save the Five hundred Pounds which is the Penalty of the Act I am sorry you have not Read the Book before you ventur'd to make so severe a Remark For your better Information therefore Sir I refer you to  p  in the  Enquiry  where my Words are plain  As to the Worthy Gentleman  whose Cause you would have this to be  you say this has been his known Judgment and Practice several Years  Tho' it were true yet Sir this is no Argument to prove the thing lawful or to prove that it is not practised even in every part that I have laid down by others before him and like to be so after him it only quits him of doing it against his Conscience to q  ellsie himself for the unprofitable Preferment you mention  and this I never Charg'd him with  That he had done the Fact no Body Disputes but that he did it against his Conscience I never alledg'd  you put that upon me Sir unjustly  Be his Conscience to God and himself I know better than to judge him  nor can you without a Breach of Charity suggest it of me  Nor do I anywhere say that others have acted against their Consciences that do so possibly they may by the help of  nice Distinguishing  Reason themselves into a Belief of their being in the Right  But the Point in Debate is Whether  whatever their Opinions may be in the Case  the Act it self be not as I have said Circumstantially sinful For I hope you will grant me they are never the more in the Right for its being their Opinion Truth is always unmov'd sullen and the same whatever Gloss our Fancy or Interest puts upon it  But since you will have it be this Gentlemans practice which I think no Reputation to him nor Defence of the Practice Nor do I think you or he can justifie your Dissenting from the Church of  England  and that Practice together Since I say you will have it be that Gentleman's practice all you gain by that in point of Argument is That he did not do it against his Conscience nor to serve the present Turn And what then I affirm to you I neither meant him nor any Man else but him that is Guilty and I meant him and every Body else if they are guilty And what is all this to the purpose The Question is not here Who is or is not guilty of it but whether the thing in its own Nature aggravated with the Circumstances of Turn and Return timed for Preferment with all the black  Et cetera  's of it as 'tis lately practic'd and as I have laid it down be a Crime or no  If this Gentleman you  would Embroil me with  did formerly live in a general or ordinary Communion both with the Church of  England  and a private Congregation before eit  the Preferments I mention invited or the Penalty of the Law forced him to it Then he stands clear of this part of the Charge that he did it for the protection of his Interest but still the Matter of Fact is true  Thus Sir I have said what I thought my self oblig'd to by way of Reply to your Considerations And as to your Censures tho' I have a great Opinion of your Charity however you seem to be out of Temper in this Case yet I appeal from your Judgment to the Judgment of Truth and waving all your puzzling Distinctions which my Respect for your Person and Character will not permit me to Descant upon give me leave to make this short Conclusion  Sincerity is the Glory of a Christian the Native Lustre of an honest Heart is impossible to be hid 'twill shine through all his Life in one Action or another in spite of Scandal and it wants no Artifice to set it out  If the Practice we Discourse of be to be Defended  let it be a Practice  I mean let it be Voluntary let it be Free and Spontaneous and if Gentlemen who have such a Latitude in their Opinions wou'd not have it thought they are mov'd to it by their  Interests  let them practice it openly and not Time it so to the very  Eve  of an Election as to have it speak of it self and as it were force Men to believe it done on purpose nay let them not put such a Reproach in the Mouths of their Enemies as to have it spoken in Contempt with  Circumstances  that stop the Mouths of Argument and are as  Convincing  as Demonstration  You have given your Blessing to them at the  Conclusion  of your Book with a  Let them go on and prosper  I wish you have not spoken Peace where there is no Peace As to its being a  Secret between God and Them  I shall only say  Enter not into their Secret O my Soul  'Tis an  Arcana  that is hidden from my Eyes and I doubt very much how it can consist with consulting the Rule with the serious Diligence you recommend For certainly were the great  Christian  Rule consulted it wou'd instruct them that the Profession of the  Christian  Religion is not a thing the Forms whereof are  of such indifference as you seem to make it that 'tis not a light thing to shift and change  Communion  with an Establish'd and with a Separate  Church  as often as Convenience or Reason of State or Interest invite  And whether I set my Name to this or no Whether I am an  Independent I hope they are Christians too as well as other folks  Whether I am a  FifthMonarchyman  Whether the Book was design'd against my Lord Mayor  tho' 'twas wrote Three Years before he was Chosen  Or whether any thing else you Censoriously charge me with be true or no seems to me not worth your while to Examine Since if I shou'd grant them all the Argument of Occasional Conformity remains untouch'd  If the Truth be made the worse for my Temper I am sorry for it But this is another of Mr  How  's Paradoxes  and something like your Ʋnprofitable Preferment  that Truth tho' it be mix'd with the worst Temper in the World shou'd thereby be so debased as to become worse than Error  Sir I had ended here but for a Clause you force me to Reply to concerning the Old  Puritans  who you tax me with abusing Indeed 'twas as remote from my Thoughts as 'twas that ever it was possible you cou'd treat an Adversary with such Language  And but that I shall not suffer my self to be transported beyond the Bounds of Civility and so fall into your Error I cou'd allow my self to be very much mov'd That such a Man as you should venture to Charge me with what is neither true in Fact nor can be suggested by Consequence from any thing I have wrote And Sir you must give me leave to say I am sorry you shou'd lay your self so open and force me to so severe a Remark  You are pleas'd to affirm That I industriously represent the Primitive  English  Puritans as if they were generally of my  stingy narrow  Spirit  And here you run upon me with ill Language  How I could think to Impose upon the World in a matter of so recent Memory  and  How I could have the Confidence  c This is really a new sort of Stile from Mr  How  Sir I have industriously examin'd the Book I wrote and as I am sure I never entertain'd a Thought in prejudice of the best Character that can be given those Primitive Reformers so I cannot find one Word in the whole Book which can no not with the help of an  Innuendo  be so much as pretended to look that way  Wherefore Sir unless you can make it out or by the help of some of your Distinctions come off from it I hope you will do me so much Justice as you are a Man of Truth and Honesty to recant the Scandal and acknowledge your self mistaken  And that I may leave it to every body to Judge whether I have not just Ground for what I say I shall quote here all that I have said relating to the  Puritans  and impartially lay down the Matter of Fact  After I had given a short Abridgment of our Reformation and recited the Controversie between Bishop  Ridley  and Bishop  Hooper  I proceeded thus Page the th  When Queen  Elizabeth  Restored the Protestant Religion and the Church enjoy'd its Peace again the Debate reviv'd But the first Establishment of King  Edward  obtained so on the Minds of Men that the farther Reformation was rejected The other Party being not at all Convinc'd tho' Overrul'd submitted their Persons to the Laws but not their Opinions affirming That it was the Duty of every Christian to endeavour to serve God with the greatest Purity of Worship as was possible and that this was the purest Worship which came nearest the Divine Institution which they believed the Establish'd Liturgy did not and therefore in Conscience they must be Dissenters  Having made this Quotation which I have sufficient Authority to prove genuine from a Manuscript of a famous Man in those days which I have seen and  on occasion am ready to produce I go on thus  It must be own'd that the Original Authors of these Disputes were Learned Devout and Singularly Pious strict in Conversation to Excess  if that were possible  and from thence in a sort of happy Derision were call'd  Puritans  Of whom I shall say nothing but leave for a Record the last Speech of a famous Foreigner  Sit anima mea cum Puritanis Anglicanis  This is all the Words that have the least Retrospect on the  Puritans  unless you will pretend that a few words  Page  is meant of them which no Man can have any Colour of Reason for But lest that shou'd be pretended I shall quote them also  Page    The Dissenters can never pretend to be Dissenters upon the meer Principle of Purity of Worship as I have related in the beginning of this Discourse if such shall be receiv'd as blameless into their Communion who have Deserted them upon occasion of Preferment  This refers back to  Page  where I say I shall give my Essay as to what I understand a real Dissenting Protestant is nor can it refer to any other place But  if you shou'd still say  it looks back to the  Puritans  'twou'd puzzle a better Head than mine to find out a Reflection on them in it  But this is not the only thing in which you are pleased to injure both me and the Truth For  Page  you tell me with some Heat too  That throughout my Book such as are so stingily  your Favourite word Sir  bigotted to a Party  as I are treated with this sort of Charity to be stil'd  Painted Hypocrites such as play Bopeep with God Almighty That if such an Occasion offer it self to any of them to serve God and their Country in a publick Station do what the Law requires and which they may sinlesly do in order to it do trespass upon their Consciences and D  their Souls to save their Countries  Sir  for Godsake  how came you to let your Passion thus outrun your Memory  There is not one word of all this true  Pardon me that I am oblig'd in my own Defence to say so I  refer you to the Criginal to convince your self of it and I'll take the pains to go along with you in the Examination  First As to  Painted Hypocrites  'tis spoken of the whole Body of Protestants in  England in haec Verba  P  I must acknowledge it fares with the Chsrch of  England  and with Dissenters both as it has always far'd with Christs Church in the whole World that while suppress'd and persecuted their Professors were few and their Profession more severe But when Religion comes to be the Mode of a Country  so many Painted Hypocrites there's the Word  get into the Church that Guile is not to be seen till it arrive to Apostacy  Pray Sir who can these  Painted Hypocrites  refer to that you should say  Innuendo All those that are not of my Party or that are not so stingy as I  These painted Hypocrites must belong to that Religion which is the Mode of the Country which must rather mean the Church of  England  than the Dissenters and yet if I meant either of them it cannot be made a Reflection because 'tis confin'd only to such as are Apostates from Religion not such as continue to Conform to both or either of them  This is Judging me indeed neither with  Charity  nor Truth The next Words are  Such as play Bopeep with God Almighty  Pray good Sir reflect on  Solomon  and what is said of such as judge of a Matter before they hear it I am perswaded you did not read the Clause which is thus  I had been Examining the Woful Excuse of some people and  too many such we had  who wou'd take the Sacrament at the Church and pretend 'twas done only as a Civil Action on which I made such Remarks as I think so prophane a Practice deserv'd and at  last added  This is playing Bopeep with God Almighty  And pray Sir if I may be so free with you do but examine the Circumstance as I have laid it down and tell me from the Sincerity of your Soul if  you are not of the same Mind  The other Reflection is on such who tho' it be against their Consciences pretend 'tis to serve their Country Of these I say  They are Patriots indeed who will Damn their Souls to save their Country  Not that thereby I imply that to take the Sacrament with the Church of  England  wou'd Damn any Mans Soul if he communicated with a right Principle but to do it to serve a Turn which is the Question in hand I won't answer for tho' it were inverted from the Church to a Dissenting Congregation  All these Instances Sir and more which I could reckon up serve to make me admire wherein I have so provok'd you as to remove you from your wonted Candor And since my Writing on a Cause which I expected fairer Quarter in so exceedingly moves you I shall chuse rather to lay down the Controversy than to engage with a Person who I shou'd be very much concern'd to see exceed the Rules which he has with so much Success and so much Applause prescrib'd to others  I always thought Men might Dispute without Railing and Differ without Quarrelling and that Opinions need not affect our Tempers But since it is not to be found I leave it to those who have a better Talent that way than I  POSTCRIPT  Besides your Book Sir which I think treats me  Coursly enough  I am since threatned to be worse us'd by a Gentleman who thinks himself concern'd in my affronting you as he calls it  I assure you Sir I do not charge you with any part of it I believe you to be more a of a  Christian  and more of a  Gentleman  nor am I sensible I gave you any affront  I am sure I intended you none  But because that Gentleman I understand expects some Answer this way I have this to say to him  That if he thinks himself capable to give me Personal Correction he knows me well enough and need never want an opportunity to be Welcome  D F  FINIS
