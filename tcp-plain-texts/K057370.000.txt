 CONSCIENCE AN ETHICAL ESSAY  BY The REVEREND J BRAND  LONDON Printed for T BECKET in the Strand W WOODYER at Cambridge and W CHACE at Norwich  MDCCLXXIII  ADVERTISEMENT  THE Subject of this Piece is the same with that proposed the two last Years for SEATON'S Prize Poem on which Account it was originally written An accidental Delay it met with upon the Road occa∣sioned its being presented to the ViceChancellor two Days after the Time appointed by the Will of Mr SEATON who therefore found himself obliged not to receive it  CONSCIENCE  THE ARGUMENT  I  the  SUBJECT  proposed  II  The  INVOCATION  addrest to the Spirit of Song as    alleviating the sufferings of mankind    inspiring virtue    and the piety of men and angels  III  The  DEFINITION  of  CONSCIENCE  See Note to v  The sense of pleasure or pain arising from a perception of the agreement or disagreement of our actions with the rules of virtue  IV  The  SOURCES  of  CONSCIENCE  or this moral sense of pleasure and pain  st  Sympathy  See Note to v  d  Pride and Shame  d  Selflove  st  From Sympathy we rejoice in the pleasures of others and our affection is conciliated to their author  relation to him heightens that pleasure consequently its greatest strength is when that happiness springs from our∣selves and our own Virtue    The converse true of Vice  d  From Pride The natural excellencies of the body or mind when surveyed necessarily give a species of pleasure which we call selfcomplacency or pride this emo∣tion is stronger on the perception of those degrees of perfection which we give birth to in ourselves by acts of the will and is still augmented in proportion of the dignity of the end by which it is put in action the highest gratification of this instinct is therefore the contemplation of those of our own actions to which some virtue was the end    From Shame The converse of the former argu∣ment holds good as vice is attended with the greatest degree of shame  d  From Selflove Selflove actuates our hopes and fears from a consideration of  st  our present and  dly  our future state    From the present StateThose actions which promote the felicity of Society or the moral virtues natu∣rally bring their own rewards with them Those which obstruct it or vices their respective punishments Whence according to the nature of our actions we are filled with  the hopes of these rewards or the fear of these punish∣ments and as the mind is always more employed in con∣sidering the future than either the present or the past these future expectations which contribute to compose that moral sense named Conscience form the greater part of our pre∣sent happiness or misery    From a future StateOur hopes are strongly excited by the views of that eternal happiness our fears by the representation of the divine justice revelation has given us Digression Description of the divine justice her infinity her almighty power to protector punish She descends upon earth to chastise the sins of men the effects of her vengeance The terror a consideration of this must inspire in the breast of the wicked and more particularly on the point of death  V  The  FINAL CAUSES  of  CONSCIENCEst  to excite repentance  dly  to counterpoise the passions  dly  to render the happiness of individuals more propor∣tioned to their moral merits  st  Conscience excites us by repentance to appease the divine justice  dly  It counterpoizes the passions by making them subservient to the general good which otherwise would  engage us in excesses the most destructive to society It introduces the finest moral harmony in the mind and reconciles all the various pursuits of life to universal happiness  dly  Vice is frequently successful and virtue deprest in the world Conscience by being the secret punish∣ment of the former and the support of the latter renders the happiness of each more proportioned to the moral merit of individuals and thus forms a necessary supplement to the external administration of providence    Hence unrestrained Avarice Ambition Sen∣suality and other crimes derive their secret punishment    And from hence the man of virtue when distrest experiences a support enabling him to triumph over or despise the afflictions of life    While its influence gives new pleasure to all its finer enjoyments and exalts prosperity into happiness  CONSCIENCE  CONSCIENCE I sing her nature source and power  Her secret scourge and selfapproving hour  OH THOU whose sway subdues the willing soul  And charms each passion to thy mild controul  In every breast speaks peace to every care  Wakes round affliction's couch and sooths despair  PARENT OF VIRTUE thou whose breath inspires  The good the wise and fans their noblest fires  Excites the high resolve the godlike deed  Aids all their toils and pours the immortal meed  Or taught the voice of piety to raise  The pealing anthems deep majestick lays  Where through the solemn isles and vaulted choir  With choral sound her hallow'd strains aspire  Benignant hear from thy empyreal height  Where thron'd thou sit'st in realms of living light  Crown'd with celestial wreaths and flowers that blow  Fast by the streams of life and as they flow  Drink immortality while on thy state  The bands of Angel and Archangel wait  To lead the eternal Paean of the skies  At once from twice ten thousand harps arise  Their golden symphonies and taught by thee  Rolls the full tide of heavenly harmony  'Till swell'd with all thy pomp the descant floats  And more than rapture fires the sacred notes  SPIRIT OF IMMORTAL SONG the verse inspire  Assist the strain and kindle all its fire  To sing what peace what joy what soft content  Await the Conscience of a life well spent  The keen the secret grief the heartfelt woe  The fears the shame the pang the guilty know  The breathing grace the glowing thought impart  To beam conviction on the enlight'ned heart  To finer ardors raise the godlike mind  Or form that virtue which they fail to find  To wipe the tear from Virtue's radiant eye  Spare vice one crime prevent one rising sigh  Bid peace and hope on pale dejection shine  These are thy noblest praise and these be mine  WHEN man compares his actions with the rule  Of moral life deduc'd from virtue's school  With joy their just conformity we see  And mark with grief where'er they disagree  V Conscience is defined to be a sense of pleasure or pain not a bare abstract perception of the mind exclusive of an operation on the passions because such a perception must terminate in itself and can never become a source of action any more than the abstract deductions of geometry or any other science and Conscience is an active principle  This MORAL SENSE of PLEASURE and of PAIN  Of CONSCIENCE forms the wide extended reign  From THREE great principles by Heav'n imprest  She holds her empire o'er the human breast  Mild SYMPATHY with PRIDE's more ardent sway  V The term Pride must be understood in a philosophical sense as a natural pleasure arising from the view of its object not as opposed to the virtue of humility in which sense it is a vice The advan∣tages of life are surveyed with pleasure the means by which these are procured are therefore pleasing by the operation of the mind associating the pleasure arising from the contemplation of the end with the idea of the means the foremost among these we reckon the natural excellencies of the body or mind thus 'tis proved there must exist such a pleasure as selfcomplacence or pride from a view of our natural perfections if nature has not given us an original primary instinct which makes the natural advantages necessarily and per se give pleasure to their pos∣sessors Ours is not the only language which wants a term which may express selfcomplacency without the danger of being misunderstood without some explanation Since the writing the above I have happened of the following observation on the word  orgueil  which one of the best modern French poets wanted to have introduced in the sense I have used the term Pride"J'aurois substitué le mot d'orgueil a ces mots sentiment de nos forces de nos qualités c mais dans notre langue le mot d'or∣gueil se prend toujours en mauvaise part" Les saisons note p  And strong SELFLOVE which awes us to obey  WHEN Virtue wakes felicity around  And blest with calm content gay transport crown'd  That peace the good man spreads we mark the few  Each social passion kindles at the view  Nor there subsides but urg'd by nature's laws  Transfers the pleasure to its active cause  The liberal heart which show'rs such bliss approves  And glows expanded o'er the worth it loves  Each slight connection can new force impart  And bring that pleasure nearer to the heart  But livelier joy more homefelt raptures bless  The godlike mind which show'rs such happiness  Sweet spring's Favonian airs and blushing flow'rs  Sweet to the thirsty earth descending show'rs  To virgins sweet the dance's graceful rounds  And sweet the tuneful lyre's melodious sounds  Yet sweeter far the joys which Virtue warm  To view that smiling scene she loves to form  Sooth pain and care repress affliction's stings  And rise with peace and healing on her wings  WHEN Vice her dark vile industry employs  To waste the happy field of human joys  Even there shall SYMPATHY assert her laws  And teach the vile to feel the pain they cause  WHATEVER great from Nature's gift alone  Of strength of form of mind we boast our own  This by implanted Instinct given to please  The soul with PRIDE and SELFCOMPLACENCE sees  That excellence from Active Will which flows  A nobler triumph on the breast bestows  But when Great Ends the kindling soul inspire  When Virtue animates her sacred fire  Then glows serene the purest bliss on earth  The large the liberal sense of manly worth  Calm Reason's chast'ned Praise and CONSCIOUS PRIDE  A virtue still to virtue where allied  Superior to each low each selfish aim  And all the vulgar thirst of vulgar Fame  HENCE in the breast where Vice maintains her throne  Which every sordid baseness calls her own  SHAME from himself retiring lurks unseen  Stables at large and desolates his den  WITH lenient hand to give each pain relief  By every care to soften every grief  Confer fair friendship's joys the social hour  Pity's mild dew and bounty's liberal shower  Or bid injustice rapine fraud and strife  Range all abroad and blast the scenes of life  To point detraction's vile envenom'd dart  Insult fall'n virtue wring the inmost heart  Of bleeding Innocence such aids we find  And such the ills man suffers from mankind  On acts like those attends their sacred meed  Fair fame  Publica Cura  the public care the grateful deed  Prosperity's warm beam and gayest hour  Wealth without fears and without envy power  Peace courts their walk and Hope their mansion loves  Earth speaks their virtue and high Heaven ap∣proves  On these flagitious deeds what pains await  Shame's canker'd sting dejection's weeping state  Pale care and frustrate hope and chill disdain  And stern adversity and all her train  Fear want despair the frantic deed to urge  Justice' deep lash and Memory's bitter scourge  These views the mind affect in different ways  And sink in sorrow or to rapture raise  Of half our cares and half our thoughts at least  The future robs the present and the past  Fond to embrace that future Hope and Fear  At once enlarge its prospects and draw near  While on the ideal landskip's varying ray  Depends the colour of our present day  Hence glows the heart as summer skies serene  Where chearful HOPE irradiates all the scene  Smiles on the future hour approves the past  Enjoys the present yet can wish the last  But vice in vain shall seek her secret shade  Dark conscious FEARS her pensive walk invade  Paint each vile art each deed of secret night  Bar'd to the day and dragg'd to public light  The scorn of virtue's keen indignant eye  Inflicted pain and galling infamy  His present lot all grief his past all care  His future torment and his end despair  WERE all our thought to this low sphere con∣fin'd  By pain and pleasure pride and shame combin'd  Would CONSCIENCE thus maintain her heaventaught sway  And bend reluctant Passion to obey  To nobler ends RELIGION bids us rise  Assert our birth and claim our kindred skies  With every hope the soul

vengeance arm'd beneath her feet she treads  The reign of death and hell the vanquisht heads  Of fal'n immortals and etherial powers  And crown'd with living light her head she towers  Above the Heaven of Heavens on high upheld  Before her beams her adamantine shield  Effulging flame on flame divine immense  To which the space the vast circumference  Of Saturn's allinvolving orb surrounds  Shrinks to a point beneath whose ample bounds  Systems and worlds from fate and force she saves  And in her strong right hand the sword she waves  Which girds omnipotence whose mighty length  Flames

Prostrate in dust and growing to the ground  In sorrow's humblest lowliest form array'd  Oft meekey'd Penitence celestial maid  Hangs on her hand averts the impending blow  And calms the avenging

Exhaust whole realms and plunder'd regions drain  A thousand vales his golden harvest fills  His vintage purples o'er a thousand hills  Yet not his treasur'd hoards his swelling sails  The vineclad

betray  And stoops to win the wretch her heart disproves  To sacrifice the generous worth she loves  With varied guilt each varied shape to try  Till ceaseless toil wins splendid misery  Or fired with the delirious dream of fame  The empty glories of an empty name  She wildly burns to dare each arduous deed  Forms the deep phalanx bids the battle bleed  Bids rapine lust and death with lawless sway

selfaccusing hour  With AVARICE and AMBITION 'tis the same  The knave of interest and the fool of fame  Fell discontent with burning hectic curst  Who only drinks to parch with double thirst  Remorse

friend  With ceaseless bay their flying speed attend  And urge sagacious all the rapid course  In vain they fly wake every latent force  Toil up the high hill sweep along the plain  Rush from the steep or cross the stormy main  O'er plains o'er rocks the loud Cerberean cry  Wing step with step and follow where they fly  Hang on their rear and circle as they tread  For ever present though for ever fled  NOR can the guilty joys which PLEASURE brings  Heal the sick breast or sooth its conscious stings  Together let us trace her flattering maze  Where every art her happiest charm displays  See the gay scene its shining skirts unfold  Emblazed with purple elephant and gold  The less'ning columns graceful ranks extend  From fretted roofs the starry lamps depend  The beamy lustres trembling splendors shine  Inlaid with every gem from every mine  The sculptur'd marbles breathe in living rows  With thought with soul the speaking canvass glows  The courtly youth and virgin train advance  Share the glad feast or form the graceful dance  Through the high dome the sprightly pipe re∣sounds  The clear recorder wakes her dulcet sounds  The cittern silver voice the living lyre  The vocal flute instilling young desire  Breathe extacy while thus the choral song  Devolves its stream of melody along  "ARISE ye sons of social joy arise  "Now radiant Hesper gilds the evening skies  "Spring summer autumn all their treasures join  "Spread the gay feast and pour the sparkling wine  "See o'er the verge its dancing lustres swim  "And liquid radiance trembles round the brim  "Prompts the warm wish inspires the flow of soul  "And bids new fragrance crown the laughing bowl  "And thou of frolic mirth the rosy power  "Oh smile propitious o'er the genial hour  "Come with thy sportive train and bring along  "The jest ambiguous and the festive song  "Life's brightest sunshine and her vernal air  "The wild oblivion of every care  "Wit's laughing front and humour's grave pretence  "And all the gay debauch of taste and sense"  THEY cease alternate then the virgin train  Wake into rapture the symphonious strain  Soft as the south winds breathe when genial springs  With new born odours lade their downy wings  Soft as the tear which streams from beauty's eye  Soft as the lovelorn virgin's softest sigh  Whose breast new hopes new fears alternate move  And heaves with trembling extacy to love  The breathing airs in tuneful descant flow  Now lightly gay now musically slow  Or circling wheel their wildly warbling round  Silence hangs o'er enamour'd of the sound  And tremblingly attentive waves with fear  His downy pinions in the list'ning air  Not to dissolve the charm With varied notes  Thus o'er the soul the smooth enchantment floats  "IN beauty rob'd now comes the JOLLY SPRING  And winnows fragrance from his buxom wing  "He comes and with him leads the laughing hours  "The vernal gales the mildlygenial showers  "Earth courts his warm approach where'er he treads  "Luxuriant all her wanton pride she spreads  "Bids each gay flower its warmest blush improve  "And newborn odours breathe through every grove  "Spontaneous tribes their beauteous forms unfold  "The flaming lotus kindling into gold  "Gay amaranth the jasmine's virgin white  "Rob'd in the mildest beam of silver light  "Myrtle and asphodell and iris rise  "The race of brighter suns and genial skies  "For Spring thus Nature pants with kind alarms  "For Youth thus Beauty puts on all her charms  "Love's brightest happiest smile the sigh supprest  "Which half conceals and half betrays the breast  "Soft speech the fond repulse the tender tear  "The trembling wishing kind reluctant fear  "The blushing ardor's warm contagious fire  "The humid eye which beams intense desire  "Attend her call and pass not unpossest  "The roseat joys which court thee to be blest"  YET Melancholy yet the bitter scourge  Of sad reflection the tumultuous surge  Of passion raging in the sick'ning breast  By guilt by anguish by despair deprest  The pang for ever new for ever keen  Haunt the sad master of the guilty scene  While down his cheek the tear incessant stole  Thus flow'd the secret anguish of his soul  "NOT the gay feast not music's sprightly sound  "The blameless dance the bowl with roses crown'd  "Sweet song love's gentle joy th' endear'd em∣brace  "Not every art refin'd by every grace  "Can calm Remorse can break her iron rod  "And to her pain speak peace My God my God  "'Tis sharp 'tis terrible to breathe to be  "But to converse with ceaseless misery  "The cool the fragrant morn returns again  "To life to joy she wakes the sons of men  "But not to me comes joy his chearing ray  "Ne'er gilds one dark hour of my gloomy day  "Night shades the world beneath her sombre wings  "Silence and peace and balmy sleep she brings  "But peace the guilty couch for ever flies  "Nor balmy sleep e'er visits these sad eyes  "Tomorrow dawns as wretched as today  "Thus wear my years of misery away  "Yet ah might allinvolving time consign  "Alas that balm heals every wound but mine  "Vain is the promise of it's soothing power  "Thus some fond infant on the seabeat shore  "When waves on waves move on their marshall'd bands  "In silent eager expectation stands  "Till every swelling surge be overpast  "Now this now that he fondly hopes the last  "Still surge on surge on billows billows hurl'd  "To the vext shore rolls all the watry world"  Now reigns the stilly hour when Night had driven  Her ebon car through half the road of Heaven  Spangled with stars and from her utmost height  Surveys this nether world In chaster light  O'er the calm scene the virgin Moon presides  Her pale ray trembling o'er old Ocean's tides  She sees the vales with vapour deluged o'er  A wavy sea of mist without a shore  Above emerging from the fleecy plain  The peasant's humble roof the solemn fane  The silent groves with trembling light o'erspread  And robed in lustre the high mountain's head  Around she views kind sleep's fraternal power  Through her still reign his balmy blessings shower  And drooping worth by frustrate hope pursued  And toil whose pain but ends to be renew'd  Affection's hopeless care and grief's sad sway  Forget their sorrows and absolve the day  YET all the splendid scene's illusion fled  No soft sleep hovers o'er its master's head  Gaunt terror pictures in the midnight shade  The weeping form of innocence betray'd  Expos'd to piercing want afflictive pain  Faint sick'ning agony and death's dread reign  A weeping father impotent to save  By frantic sorrow urg'd to seek a grave  To each sad image of distracting thought  A new succeeds with deeper anguish fraught  And memory to wound his inmost heart  Steeps in her bitterest gall her sharpest dart  Now here now there he turns to seek repose  Averse she flies and leaves him all his woes  Till sick'ning nature by fatigue opprest  Sinks down in torturing dreams of feverish rest  FORSAKEN chearless desolate dismay'd  He seems to wander in the midnight shade  'Midst pensive isles and solitary tombs  Chill horror broods through all the hallow'd domes  In awful shades half veil'd from mortal sight  The flitting melancholy forms of night  Through the long gloom in solemn silence sweep  And drops of blood from every marble weep  Loudrushing roars a hollow blast around  And from its womb with more than thunder's sound  A voice thus breaks on his astonish'd sense  "Mortal 'tis past and vengeance sweeps thee hence"  The yawning grave its marble jaws expands  And bursting into light a dread form stands  Shrowded in terrors his grim bosom gor'd  Still freshly stream'd beneath the gleaming sword  Corruption's loathsome bane had half destroy'd  His undistinguisht form and from the void  Together with him bursts Death's horrid king  Whose mortal dart he seizes bent to spring  Upon his trembling prey "In vain you fly  "Vengeance demands her victim and you dye  "My child my child exacts thy forfeit breath  "Her tears her shame her agonies her death  "My frantic breast with every pang to tear  "Against my soul my madding sword to bare  "In all my crimes to meet my doom hurl'd down  "THUS I avenge her fate and THUS my own"  Astonisht nerveless impotent he stands  Fear chains his feet and binds his trembling hands  He strives he toils yet wants the power to fly  And seems transfixt to fall to writhe to dye  Trembling he wakes and scarce forgets his sears  While anxious terror steeps his couch with tears  To court sleep's balmy gifts again he tries  And other shapes and other forms arise  He strays by sober evening's grateful shades  Through devious walks and fragrancebreathing glades  Glittering by Moon a solemn silence reigns  Save in some bourne that skirts the dewy plains  The sweetest warbler of the feather'd throng  Wakes to soft rapture her lovelabour'd song  And pensive list'ning to her amorous lay  His lov'd his loveliest charmer weeps his stay  Thus some fair lily on the mountain's side  With rain surcharg'd declines her silver pride  Till young Hyperion from his gorgeous height  On her chaste bosom show'rs the dazzling light  Then chear'd to life in virgin state array'd  Half her retreating elegance display'd  While halfconceal'd her modest form she veils  And streams fresh odour to the passing gales  His golden beams her spotless beauties rear  To lend new lustre to the vernal year  Hope gleams a moment o'er his deep distress  And bids him thus his raptur'd sense express  "Dear as soft showers when gasping Nature mourns  "Dear as cool shades when fervid Sirius burns  "Dear as the vital air as balmy rest  "Dear as the last best hope that warms my breast  "Oft Fancy saw thee mingled with the dead  "And o'er the thought my heart with anguish bled  "Nor rest my soul nor joy my bosom knew  "Save haply when Remembrance to my view  "The wretched scenes of other days retrac'd  "In fond idea thy past griefs I chac'd  "Repuls'd no more with stern averting eye  "Thy weeping loveliness thy struggling sigh  "But wiped thy tears bad all thy sorrows cease  "And smil'd thy fond subsiding fears to peace  "Then fled the fancied scenes and as they fled  "I wept no cares could reach the silent dead  "Or when my mind its dearest joy has prov'd  "To bless the Friend thy gentler virtues lov'd  "Thus have I said to my expanding heart  "Had she now liv'd some joy it might impart  "To that mild breast where softness fixt her throne  "To feel the bliss of those she lov'd her own  "While sooth'd affection's tear and pleasing grief  "Through my sick breast diffus'd severe relief  "God of my soul be all her future blest  "And let her closing day be peace and rest  "Heal all thy fest'ring griefs and those forgot  "Let Justice or let Mercy fix my lot"  Then ardent he extends his longing arms  Intent to grasp her visionary charms  When lo that instant in his fond embrace  Againpale Famine in her bloated face  And pangs and terror in her meager eyes  Expiring prostrate at his feet she lies  Convulst with madding agonising pain  While death and torture burns in every vein  Now finks the heart now pants recover'd life  Now nature labouring in her last sad strife  Frantic with shrilling shrieks she rends the air  Then sinks exhausted down in mute despair  Yet turns on him her fond forgiving eye  And on his prest hand breathes her last sad sigh  His boiling brain with frantic passion burns  He rages loves and weeps and storms by turns  Now deems array'd in terrors and the night  The kindred shades pursue his trembling flight  With whips of Scorpions and a dreary yell  The unutterable fury forms of hell  Till flying from some dread tremendous steep  Headlong he sinks ten thousand fathoms deep  Down down the eternal precipice he goes  And o'er his soul the depths of ocean close  WITH fears and stern conflicting pangs possest  Thus Conscience agitates the guilty breast  Hence Lust that can the golden bands despise  Of Nature and her dearest charities  The wretch who sharpens fell affliction's dart  To bid it pierce a friend's a parent's heart  And midnight murder and relentless hate  Transfixt with horror feel their future fate  YET hence the firm support of godlike minds  The last best refuge suffering Virtue finds  She smooths the good man's path serenes his way  And on his thickest gloom pours light and day  If on the sea of life indulgent gales  Aid all his course and fill his swelling sails  While o'er the parted waves his light bark glides  With sober hand her destin'd course he guides  If black'ning clouds the face of heaven deform  He all collected dares the rising storm  Marks one fixt star and by her guiding ray  Stems all the terrors of the watry way  Darkness in vain the face of heaven o'ershrowds  Storms swell on storms and clouds are roll'd on clouds  The afflicting hail descends the driving rain  Sweeps o'er the surge and blackens all the main  The uplifted billows tossing to the skies  Roaring immense foamy abrupt arise  O'er the tall mast their raging tops aspire  And wrathful lightnings robe the main in fire  One wide incessant blaze loud thunders roll  Tremendous deep and bellow round the pole  And he the angel of Destruction forms  Their must'ring ire and drives on all their storms  And deep retir'd in clouds and tenfold night  Full on the bark impells their raging flight  Arrest the bolt with erring fury sped  And hurls it flaming o'er his sacred head  Serene the good man steers his constant way  While frustrate lightnings innocently play  And sees their baffled rage with generous scorn  Or gild his triumphs or his fall adorn  'TIS CONSCIOUS WORTH alone can form our bliss  Exalt prosperity to happiness  Aid life's best joys illume her brightest day  And gild her prospects with distinguisht ray  Fair Wealth's enchanting scene her fretted room  Her feast her song her treasures and her plume  And dear the warrior's Wreath the patriot's Fame  The poet's bay the sage's deathless name  Sweet Friendship's tye the mutual heart that binds  The sacred sympathy of kindred minds  Soft Love's endearing joy and golden dart  The gentle wish fond cares and pleasing smart  Yet Wealth's enchanting scene the boast of Fame  Love's gentle wish and Friendship's sacred flame  For Conscious Worth refine their happiest hour  On Conscious Worth their choicest blessings shower  And every joy of every appetite  Her secret power refines to true delight  Thus when the dew of heaven pervades unseen  Earth's inmost breast and morn returns serene  Then beams the liberal lustre of the year  The hills the plains spontaneous herbage rear  Intenser beauty robes the laughing spring  The herds rejoice the exulting vallies ring  Man grateful Man the glowing scene surveys  Eyes its great Source and pours his soul in praise  In bright succession year thus leads on year  Till having finish'd all his full career  She sinks mature upon the lap of earth  The lot impos'd by Nature on her birth  No guilty fear disturbs her closing eyes  But hope serenes her passage to the skies  Points to the reign of Peace and Hope and Joy  There where no pains torment no cares annoy  Immortal streams and realms for ever bright  The eternal Throne the flood of living light  And Virtue's highest brightest best reward  The applauding smile of Heaven's almighty Lord  THE END
