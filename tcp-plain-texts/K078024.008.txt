The male of this fine species of Phalaena has been given in the first Number of this Work with a promise that the female should be added in a future Plate The larva and pupa is represented with the male Insect but we have also introduced other caterpillars of the same species with the annexed figure to shew the different stages of their growth When young they are yellowish the tuber∣cles black with a stripe of the same on the segments of the joints After this the yellow bands become orange and the transverse black stripes appear interrupted with longitudinal bands of pale green Some are entirely green except the tubercles which are yellow and a small black speck on each joint and others are green chequered with black and marked on the side with a row of semilunar spots In  the winged state we find more permanent and characteristic distinc∣tions  Linnaeus and after him Fabricius describes three varieties of Phalaena Pavonia α minor β med  a and γ major The first is the species found in this country and in the north of Europe The existence of the second was formerly disputed by some naturalists and the last is so extremely different at least in point of magnitude that we may almost venture to remove it entirely from the two pre∣ceding  The difference between the male and female of the common Emperor Moth is strikingly obvious the male is smaller than the female and the colours in general darker the posterior wings also are orange in the male and not so in the female and finally the two sexes may be determined by the structure of the antennae those of the male being nearly oval and very deeply feathered or pecti∣nated and those of the female being also pectinated but so slightly as to appear setaceous As the structure of the antennae is an uner∣ring criterion by which the sexes are ascertained the Phalaena Pavonia  media  is a phaenomenon in Entomology for both the male and female so perfectly resembles the  female Emperor Moth  P P media which we have figured that it may be mistaken for the same species the female differs in no respect from it and the male only in the form of the antennae We have received this remarkable species from Italy and Germany It is figured only by  Esper Phal    tab  and is thus described by Linnaeus and Fabricius β media "singu∣laris ob soeminam ma  i simillimam" The third P Pavonia major can by no means be confounded with the preceding our specimen of it is six inches in breadth and is also very bulky it is found in the  Pays de vaud  Roesel has given a figure of both sexes with the larva and pupa The winged Insect is of a dingy brown the marks somewhat similar to those of the common kind The larva is large with the head small in proportion The whole is of a citron green  furnished with elevated

local authority It certainly visited Great Britain in the year and several small flocks of them were seen in the environs of London where they  caused much consternation according to the authors of that time M Edwards in particular gave a figure and a short account of it in his History of Birds Plate under the name of Great Brown Locust It is not certain that they have appeared at least in considerable numbers in this country since that period and it is probable if any specimens of them were then collected they are now lost for we have not hitherto been able to ascertain pre∣cisely an English specimen of it in any cabinet and this consider∣ation alone has induced us to defer adding this remarkable creature to our illustration of British Insects  In the month of September LADY AYLESFORD most obligingly communicated a living specimen of it to us and we deem ourselves particularly fortunate in the opportunity it affords us to ascertain the difference however inconsiderable between the variety found in England and those of warmer countries It is represented in the annexed plate both in a resting position and with the wings expanded This specimen was found in a barley field near Pack∣ington in Warwickshire It lived several days after its arrival in London and would probably have survived much longer had it not been injured in the journey and weakened by long confinement We remarked that in feeding it cuts the stalk asunder in the middle or near the root and tearing off the leaves eats only the pith this may in some measure account for the great mischief and depredation these creatures commit when they settle in vast numbers on any tract of cultivated land  Though we regard the Gryllus Migratorius as an object of cu∣riosity in this country in many others they are the terror of the inhabi∣tants We are not perhaps to admit implicitly the relations of all authors but in those of credibility and information we find abundant reason to hope it may ever remain as at present a rare British species It is said to be very numerous in Tartary from whence at certain periods it migrates westward and visits the south of Europe in incredible quantities Of all the authors who have treated on the history of this Insect none are more satisfactory than Roesel  his observations are given in detail but they are the result of useful information and may be deemed a proper sequel to our concise ac∣count of it when we consider that his observations relate to the same event and time the legions of Locusts that appeared in this country and throughout Europe in  Under the section  Der Heuscbrecten urd Grillensammlung  c c Vol II p  "I have already" says Roesel "given particulars of those dangerous guests in the beginning of the year and at the same time added figures of them  Referring to his plate of LOCUSTA GERMANICA and description of the Insects annexed  I shall now only observe that in the course of the same year they not only appeared in Poland Hungary Austria Bohemia Silesia Bavaria but also in Franconia and consequently in the environs of our city Thanks be to God they have not been numerous about our city but from Wind∣sheim we have intelligence of the third of September that they had frightened the inhabitants with their legions but they departed again on the fourth since then a much respected patron has kindly sent me the IMPERIAL AND ROYAL HUNGARIAN EDICT of the present year together with a printed description of the Insect and proper instructions to the imperial subjects how to extirpate them and I thought it necessary as they contain much good and useful matter to insert them" Then he proceeds with  Beschreibung Deren Anno  c c or a description of the Locust as given in the Imperial Edict c In the course of which and the description in page we are informed that this Locust lives three years The female deposits her eggs in a kind of bag the eggs are about a quarter of an inch in length of a slender oblong form and placed within the bag lengthwise so as to form four or five tiers It is most advised to dig for them in this state and burn them or if they should alight in the winged state as it is known that the noise of bells c will allure them to any particular spot it is re∣commended to form deep ditches and decoy drive or beat them into the water in multitudes  PLATE CCLXXI PAPILIO

anterior wings in particular are of such a beautiful yellow that English collectors have termed this kind the Golden Swift Moth  It commences its flight earlier in the evening than any other of the nocturnal lepidopterous insects Its manner of flying is very singular and attracted the notice of Linnaeus who aptly compares it to the motion of the pendulum of a clock  The larva is unknown it is

Linnaeus describes as  alis cinereo testaceis lineolis duabus longitudinalibus nigris puncto albo  Fabricius has altered this definition to  "alis testaceis cinereo maculatis"  in the  Entomologia Systematica  and erroneously attributes the latter to Linnaeus  We cannot avoid in support of our opinion noticing the striking dissimilarity between the several figures of Phryganea Grandis in our copies of the works quoted by Linnaeus and Fa∣bricius  Roesel  has two figures one of a bluish grey the other  yellowish brown both vary in the markings and are nearly twice the size of our specimen In  Sulzer  the wings are shorter and more pointed than in the preceding work and are rather pellucid and tinged with yellow the markings totally different from those in  Roesel  Those in  Schaeffer  are most like one of our specimens in form and reddish colour but still with markings as different from it as from either of the preceding figures We may hence conclude the marks are inconstant and the colours extremely variable and that in point of size the present species may be the  Varia  of Fa∣bricius since he notices its affinity to the P Grandis and adds it is rather smaller"Nimis Affinis
