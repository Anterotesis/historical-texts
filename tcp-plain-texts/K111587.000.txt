at the  Three Legs  and  Bible  in the  Poultry  and  Ralph Smith  at the  Bible  under the  Royal Exchange  in  Cornhil    TO THE READER  WE could possibly have found out a Patron had it been thought necessary under the protection of whose Name this Stranger might have come abroad into our  English World  But as we look upon Dedications to be for the most part empty Formalities as little minded by every one else as what is said in 'em is believ'd by the Writer so we doubt not but this Book will every where meet with a becoming Reception seeing it is sent out on such a friendly Errand as to heal our  Sores  and pour  Oyl  and  Wine  into our  Wounds    Surgery  in consideration of the Antiquity the Usefulness the Necessity and Excellency thereof has ever been in the  highest Esteem among all these other Arts that were invented for the Service of Mankind For the Improvemant of this noble Profession the  Author  of the ensuing  Treatise  has been at no small Pains having these twenty and eight Years laboured therein in some of the most celebrated Countries of the World with an unwearied Diligence and assiduous Application the Fruits of whose Care and Fatigues the  Courteous Reader  is here presented with  Several of the Learned and Ingenious not only of this but also of some former Ages have been very sensible that this  Art  was far from having attain'd unto that Perfection whereof it is capable yea that  Abuses  had slipt into Practice which were unknown to these renown'd Persons who at first were famous in this Faculty It was this Consideration that produc'd that learned and elaborate Treatise of  Caesar Magatas  Doctor of  Physick  and Professor thereof in the University of  Ferrara  entituled  De rara Vulnerum Tractatione Turundarum Abusu  To the same also we owe many other Chirurgical  Composures that from time to time have appear'd in the World some finding fault with one Thing and some with another in the ordinary Way Yea some have gone so far as  universally  to reject it  It is not fitting and would be extremely unjust to say any thing in Disparagement of the Works of such as have endeavour'd to oblige the Publick by their Labours Only this we think may be said without Offence to any that the Book of  Caesar Magatus  is written in Latine Rare to be found and very Long and consequently of no use to the English Reader And as for others they have either superficially only and transiently complain'd of the Imperfection of their Art or then having signifi'd to us in general the Defects of the  Common Medicines  and  Method  don't enter into a Detail of the Reasons that make them miscarry in particular  Cases  or make known unto us either the Name Nature or Composition of these other Remedies which we are to use in the Place of the Former  The following  Treatise  which was altogether design'd for the Reformation and  Improvement of Surgery is without any of these Inconveniences Herein the  Author  has discovered to us the Disadvantages of the usual  Remedies  and  Method  in the differing Cases that occur by particular Reasons drawn from the Nature and Essence of the Things whereof he discourses He not only describes to the Life the  Way  he would have us to take but also as to Wounds and some other Cases points it out to us cloathed with all the most Minute and requisite Circumstances in particular Instances of  Cures  of all Sorts done on all Parts of the Body He gives us an Account of the Names Natures and Compositions of the  Simple  and  Easy Remedies  he uses and which he has found attended with constant  Success  not confining himself or others to one or two only but exhibiting as was convenient a competent Variety When he blames the ordinary  Practice  and substitutes a better in the Place of it he accompanies his invincible Reasons with several Authorities of the most considerable Authors Moreover he has taught us how to evite the  Exfoliation  of Bones And has given  us a new  Way  of Dressing after performance of the Operation of the  Trepan  with an  Instrument  of his own Inventing  He seems to have hit upon the Right Way of carrying the Knowledge of the  Art  he professes to the furthest Extent it can go which is is by giving an exact History of what he has learnt therein by Experience without vouching upon the Credit of others whether Ancients or Moderns what himself has not prov'd by a sufficient number of Tryals Had this Course been hitherto taken in all the  Arts  and  Sciences  they had not remain'd at this Day of the Dwarfish Stature we find 'em neither had the World groan'd under the bulky Lumber of an infinite number of useless Books which for the most part are but imperfect and mangled Transcriptions from the Works of others Had Physicians done so their  Art  had not been still term'd  Conjectural  nor had the ill Success and jarring Opinions of by far the greatest number of those who bear that hounourable Name expos'd it to contempt and rendred it so abnoxious to be slighted even by the Vulgar  But to return to our  Author  all we will further say of him is that he is an unfeigned Lover of Mankind Conscientious Sincere and Communicative of his Knowledge without Reserve and all this accompany'd with an unusual  Modesty  The Truth of which desirable Character his Book will abundantly Justify  We will no longer detain the Reader in the Entry only it is convenient he should know that this Treatise in the Original is printed with the Approbations of some of the most eminent Physitians and Surgeons in  France  which are omitted in this English Impression that was designedly contriv'd into this small Bulk for the greater Conveniency of the Reader Of whom all we have to demand in behalf thereof is that he would  Read Try  and  Judge    THE PREFACE  I Am sufficiently convinc'd of the Truth of what is deliver'd by  Hippocrates  in his  Aphorisms  that  Life is Short  and  Art is Long  And indeed it appears extreamly difficult for one Man righly to acquit himself in the Practise of  All  the  Parts  of  Surgery  The Capacity of the  Mind  seems too limited to be able intirely to grasp so extensive an  Art  Tho' I have for these eight and twenty Years past practis'd  Surgery  under different  Climates  and in divers  Hospitals  of the  Army  yet I am so far from thinking to have attain'd unto the Knowlege necessary in this  Art  that I own my self scarce to have had the time to improve  and make some Remarks on the curing of  Wounds  to which chiefly I apply'd my self  However having had many Opportunities of discovering the Mischiefs occasion'd by the use of  Tents  and by the  Long  and  Painful Manner  of  Dressing  the  Wounded  and often  uncovering  their  Wounds  I was mov'd to Compassion by their Sufferings and thought my self oblig'd in Conscience to give my Advice herein Besides seeing all Men are allow'd the Liberty to speak their Mind concerning these  Arts  they profess I see not why I shou'd be abridg'd of that  Priveledge  which others also assume to themselves possibly on much slighter Grounds  It is not to be question'd but among the great number of  Surgeons  wherewith  France  abounds some will applaud the Excellency of my  Method  but I am apt to think it will not please all I hardly ever knew any that practis'd  Surgery  as I do and there are few of all the celebrated  Authors  we have that deli+ver any such  Doctrine  which being contrary  to the Practice of many  Surgeons  will not from the most Part meet with the Reception it Merits  'Tis a noble thing said a  Wise Philosopher  to be evil Spoken of for doing well There is no cause then why any shou'd be asham'd to communicate to the  Publick  what he has learn'd when the  World  may reap any Advantage thereby Nothing is so inconsistent with  Christian Charity  and that  Love  we owe to our  Neighbour  as to refuse to let him light his Taper at ours  Knowledge  like  Light may be imparted and not lessen'd    It is not my Design by this  Method  that possibly will appear to be new to destroy the  Foundations  and  principal Rules  left us by the  Ancients  concerning the  Curing  of  Wounds  I am willing only to make known my  Observations  on this Subject and to point out what I have perceiv'd to be pernicious in the ordinary  Practice  and withal to shew what is certain and useful in that  Method  I my self have followed for several Years which I hope will be found so much the more advantageous and reasonable  that it is founded on the Principles of the  Circulation    I know it is a pretty bold Attempt to go about to suppress  Tents  that have been used for many Ages and I am not ignorant that  Custom  on many Occasions has the Force of a  Law  But notwithstanding of all this I design to maintain the Priviledges of  Nature  and to shew beyond Contradiction that  Reason  and  Experience  are on my Side tho' at the same time I run the Hazard of being universally censur'd for the  Newness  of my  Method    I don't altogether condemn Those who were the first Inventers of  Tents Dilaters  and  Setons  they have had their  Reasons  for using them as I have  Mine  for laying them aside Many things have formerly been imploy'd in  Physick  and  Surgery  which now are no more in use The  Received Rules  the  Order of Curing  and also the  Application of Remedies  have been chang'd from time to time That which is  New  at this Time will one Day be  Ancient  as what to Day is  Ancient  was  once New    It is true that the  Ancients  did lay the  Foundations  of  Surgery  They have said many Things but not All neither was their  Knowledge  commensurate to the  Subject  They had the Honour of  Inventing  but have left that of  Bringing to Perfection  to  Posterity  However it is not to be doubted that they took all requisite Care to avoid being deceiv'd and to inform themselves of the  Truth  But if they had done All Nothing had been left us to do  Add to this that if that  Prepossession  in favour of the  Ancients  and the  Blind Submission  to their  Dictates  had not been laid aside we had not seen that great number of Skilful  Physicians  and  Surgeons  which  This Age  has produc'd who after having shaken off the tyranical  Yoke  of  Antiquity  found out Things no less Necessary than Curious that otherwise wou'd have remained till now in Obscurity and had possibly been unknown to  Posterity    Wherefore it is not impossible that in the Active Part of  Physick  also which is  Surgery  frequent  Experiences  and continual  Diligence  may have discover'd  Abuses  that were crept into  Practice  and authoriz'd by  Custom    It can't be deny'd that what belongs to the  Fabrick  and  Constitution  of the  Body  of Man Always was but yet it has not Ever been equally known The  New Discoveries  have made a considerable Change in the  Knowledge  the  Judgment  and in the  Cure  of  Inward Distempers  and I see no Reason why there ought not also to be some Alterations in the Cure of  Outward Diseases  and especially that of Wounds which depend upon the same  Principles  and have the Advantage of the same  New Inventions    I suppose it will not be thought Strange if after I have laboured for the space of  Fifteen  or  Sixteen  Years in  Hospitals  of the  Army  I have made some  Discoveries  in the  Curing of Wounds  for  Usage  we know compleats a  Workman  I have formerly seen the most Part of  France  I have travell'd over a Part of  Germany  and all  Italy  but have hardly found any Place where  Tents  were not in Use Several there are who  find fault with them but few will give themselves the Trouble to lay them aside Some before me have written against 'em but I believe I have been the first my Self who hath had the boldness intirely to suppress 'em in Practice excepting only in case of excessive  Bleeding  and in some  First Dressings    Hippocrates Galen Celsus Fabricius ab Aquapendente  and many others cited in this Treatise have been very near of my  Opinion  and I have adduc'd some Passages of these famous Authors that countenance my  Method  I have alledged some Places out of  Ambrosius Pareus  being a well known  Author  and celebrated for the Cure of  Wounds  but it appears by the Remarks I have made that he is inconsistent with himself in many Places of his Works which can't chuse but perplex the Mind of the young  Surgeon    Jacobus Marcus  in his Preface to the  Summary of Bandages  quotes  Septalius  a famous Physician of  Milan  and  Caesar Magatus  a renoun'd Professor in the University of  Ferrara  who as he says  condemn'd the  Use  of  Tents  and the too  Frequent Dressing  of  Wounds  and that to this they had suited their Practice in these two  Cities  for a very considerable time  I know it is not  Length  of  Time  that can give a  Value  to  Things  it is only their own  Excellency  And every Thing must once have a  Beginning  I hope therefore if my  Reasons  are approv'd and some Credit given to my  Experiences  none will judge it necessary to wait yet till an  Age  is expir'd before they will list themselves upon my Side I know not whether my  Reasonnings  will be of force enough to perswade but the Infallible Proofs I have given of the Goodness of my  Method  in the  Great Number  of  Cures  I have wrought thereby will I hope suffice to convince the Publick  I grant it is difficult at first to come over to the Opinion of another when it is contrary to our Own But when the  Life  of  Men  is concern'd we ought not to delay one Minute to free our selves from Errour and to put off these Prejudices  that often hinder us thorowly to penetrate into the  Truth  of things The  Opinions  we receive in our younger Days and the most part of the  Maximes  we take upon trust from the  Ancients  are ordinarly the Cause of the  False Steps  we make in the chief Obligations of our Calling The  Life  of the  Wounded  is indeed in the Hands of the  Surgeon  who has him under his Care wherefore he ought to give all Diligence not only to attain a competent Measure of  Skill  but also to find out the most  Sure  and the most  Speedy Way  of curing  Wounds    It will be objected to me that a great number of wounded Persons have been and yet are every Day cur'd with the Use of  Tents  and also by following the  Ancient Method  in all its Circumstances I answer 'tis true And indeed if all those who are drest after this manner were in certain Danger of being lost it wou'd be downright  Malice  and  Cruelty  to use it neither had my Endeavours been at this time needful to suppress it since it would have been rejected long e're now But this I affirm after I have made Trial  of both the  One  and the  Other Method  and have carefully considered the Difference between 'em that those who are cur'd by that of the Ancients have need of a healthful and vigorous Constitution besides that it is never without Danger much Pain and requires a tedious Length of Time All which Inconveniences are avoided by embracing that which I propose  In this  Hospital  we have by this  Method  happily cur'd  Wounds  of divers Sorts yea of as many  Various Kinds  as there are  Different Parts  of the  Body  having had Wounds of all these under our Care Wherefore this  Happy Success  can't in Reason be ascrib'd to the  Temper  of the  Air  which in some Places is favourable to certain  Parts  of the Body as hath been observ'd by  Guy de Chauliat  who speaking of  Wounds  in the  Head  averrs that they are more easily cur'd at  Avignion  than at  Paris  and that these of the  Legs  on the contrary are cur'd sooner at  Paris  than at  Avignion  The  Air  I confess where I am because of the Situation of the Place is  not so replenisht with gross Parts as in Plain and Low Grounds yet is it notwithstanding ever hurtful to  Wounds  both by Reason of the  Niter  wherewith it is stor'd and also because of its Activity and Penetraction But I have never yet been able to remark that it was either more beneficial or hurtful to one Part than to another and I have always us'd all possible Precaution to hinder its Access to all  Wounds  whatsoever as will appear by the Sequel  I shall not in this  Treatise  discourse of the  Natures  and  Differences  of the  Diseases  that belong to  Surgery  This is already sufficiently done to my Hands by others And the learned  M Verduc Doctor of Physick  hath lately oblig'd the Publick with a compleat  Piece  of  Surgery  I will therefore concern my self only with my own  Practice  and if any thing else chance to fall from my Pen it will be only what I thought necessary for understanding my Subject  Tho' in many Places of this  Book  I advise the use of  general Remedies  and a suitable course of  Diet  among the  Diversions  necessary in the curing of  Wounds  yet I don't pretend to assume to my self what peculiarly belongs to  Physicians  whose part it is to order these things and according to whose Directions they ought to be us'd But I wrote in an  Hospital  where the whole ordering of the  Wounded  was altogether committed to me It shall ever be  Law  to me especially when the Occasion will allow to keep my self within the  Bounds  of my  Profession  That Man who wou'd acquit himself in his  Imployment  as becomes him will find enough to do tho' he keep himself to what properly belongs to  Surgery  And those who pretend to know all things most commonly know nothing at all But after all I judge it highly advantageous for a  Surgeon  to know on certain  Occasions  how to mak a seasonable use of General Remedies as well as of Topicks Vulnerary Drinks  c  For  Opening  of a  Vein  a  Potion  or a  Clyster  when seasonably ordered and timously administrated may save the  Life  of a  wounded Person  or  at least prevent a great many  Accidents    I have divided this little  Treatise  into three  Parts  In the First I treat of  Tents  and of the Mischiefs that continually accompany the use of 'em And after I have made it appear that the  Air  is pernicious to  Wounds  I add on that Occasion a Dissertation on  Uncovered  Bones And then I describe my way of Dressing after performing the  Operation  of the  Trepan  with a  New Instrument  of my own Invention  The second  Part  contains a  Collection  of some  Cures  that I have done according to my Method with a  Reflection  after each which I justify by  Authority  adducing some  Citations  There wou'd be Reason indeed to think that I had accommodated  Nature  to my own  Sentiments  and the  Success  of my  Practice  might justly be call'd in question if I had not related many very important Experiences and such as were publickly perform'd For without doubt the establishing of a new  Method  as I have already said is a pretty bold Attempt especially  in a Time when  France  seems to have advanc'd  Surgery  to the highest pitch of  Splendor  but particularly  Paris  to which I owe my  Birth  and  Education  Knowing therefore that  Experience  is for the most part much more convincing than  Reason  I have quoted several  Cases  and given a Breif but very Particular  Account  of several Cures which I have related in a  Manner  as  Natural  as possible  The third and last  Part  will be no less useful to the young  Surgeon  than the two others 'Tis a general  Idea  of my  Practice  with some  Observations  and a  Description  of the simple  Remedies  that I use in the Cure of  Wounds  and other  Diseases  belonging to the Province of  Surgery  Their  Goodness  is sufficiently attested by the advantageous  Effects  which they produce and the great number of Patients cur'd by their Means ought to gain them some  Repute    I have done what I cou'd to give this Book a Plain and Easy  Stile  If the Language is not Fluent nor the Expressions  inviting and agreeably ordered it ought not to be surprizing  Simplicity  and  Plainness  best becomes the  Truth  A  Book  written in an  Hospital  in the middle of the  Alps  without any  Assistance  or  Advice  and which is bottom'd only upon  Practice  neither can nor possibly ought to be attended with the vain Embellishments of  Eloquence  In a Word  I expect to perswade not so much by what  I can say  as by what  I have done I hope the Reader will take in good Part this  Essay  and will not condemn a  Design  whose only  Aim  is  The  Glory  of  God  The  Comfort  of the  Afflicted  and the  Perfection  of  Surgery  THE CONTENTS  PART I Plainly shewing by  Reason  and  Authority

Mischiefs of a contrary Practice With a  Discourse  upon  Discovered Bones  and a Way to Dress with a  new Instrument  of the Author's Invention after the Vse of the  Trepan    CHAP I Of the Four Ends proposed in the Using of  Tents    THE Use of  Tents  in Wounds being reputed of so long standing in Surgery and but too much approv'd on by the Universal Practice at this Day it will be necessary for us before  we deliver our own Method to give our Thoughts thereon which also we will confirm by  Reason  and  Authority    Fabricius ab Aquapendente  in his Eighth Chapter  Of Wounds  reckons up only three Uses of  Tents  but many after him make mention of Four One is to keep open the Orifice of the  Wounds  Another to carry the requir'd Medicines to their Bottom A third to further the coming away of  Extraneous Bodies  And a fourth is to drink in as it were and to contain the Filth and Excrements therein generated  Our Design is at present to consider whether these Ends so far as they are expedient may not be obtain'd without the Assistance of  Tents  For I would not be thought without Reason to make any Change of the Order receiv'd in managing of  Wounds  nor rashly to lay aside any thing that might conduce to the Relief of the Wounded or facilitate and shorten the Cure  CHAP II Of the First End of  Tents    IT is unquestionably certain that  Nature  's Endeavours are ever bent towards the supplying of what has been taken away by violent means from our  Bodies  and uniting the Divisions  made therein We ought not therefore to keep open the  Orifice  of a  Wound  but if needful it may be widened at the first Dressing and thereby what is design'd in the first Use will be sufficiently attain'd However I don't altogether disapprove of the Use of  Dilaters  and sometimes of  Tents  when they are required to contain and support Astingents to stop the Bleeding or to hinder the Reunion of fresh Incisions that sometimes are necessary in the first Dressing of  Gunshot Wounds  Especially when there is any Suspition that  Extraneous Bodies  are lodg'd in the Wound or some Splinter of a Bone that  Nature  is not able to reunite But if once the first two or three Days are over  Tents  are not only useless but extreamly hurtful particularly in  Gunshot Wounds  that of themselves are oftentimes sufficiently enlarg'd by the coming away of the bruised Flesh commonly call'd the  Escar  before which we need not fear the closing up of the  Wound    It was seldom ever known that a  Wound  did fill up while any  forreign Body  remain'd within it Now the  Escar  is an  Extraneous  Body in regard of those parts to which it immediately adheres and must therefore of necessiy be separated from them Moreover  Nature  can't effect a Reunion of the flesh till first she have free'd her self of what keeps asunder the Parts to be joyn'd  Fabricius ab Aquapendente  is of the same Opinion Part I Book Chap where he says that  Nature never cures a  Wound  so long as any thing is in it that offends her    I do believe there is no Body but will grant that the Separation of the  Escar  is a Work of  Nature  that is most spedily perform'd where the  Natural Heat  is most vigorous Now seeing new Flesh is bred easiliest at the Bottom of the Wound 'tis there also where it first begins to fill up and therefore the Orifice is last of all freed from the  Escar  and supply'd with new Flesh for which Cause we have no Reason to fear its too sudden closing neither does there appear any necessity of using  Tents  to avoid that Inconveniency  As for Wounds made by sharp Instruments they have no need of  Tents  seeing they don't want to be dilated but only to be clos'd up Now what thwarts Nature's Intention not only may but ought to be laid aside  Finally  Contused Wounds  can't be united till first what is bruised is remov'd either by the force of the Natural Heat or the Application of Dissolving Medicines or by Suppuration and consequently it appears that in this Case also as well as the others  Tents  may be forborn and so the first  End  propos'd in using them is not to be allow'd  CHAP III Of the second End of  Tents    THere will be no need of a great many Reasons to demonstrate that it is an easy matter to make the  Remedies  pass to the  Bottom  of a  Wound  without the Assistance of  Tents  for to this Purpose nothing more is required than to give a pretty soft and thin Consistence to these  Oyntments Balsams  and other such like Remedies as are commonly us'd in curing of  Wounds    When a simple Division is made in a healthful and well temper'd Body Nature stands not in need of any thing else but the  Natural Balsam  of the Parts or the  Nutricious Juice  in order to procure a Reunion especially if it is in fleshy Parts in which Case the  Tents  and  Oyntments  do only irritate the  Parts  cause Fluxion of  Humours  putrify the  Flesh  alter the  Nutricious Juice  and so occasion long and very great Suppurations which rather hinder than promote the Cure  CHAP IV Of the third End of  Tents  THat the Discharge of  Extraneous Bodies  is at all furthered by  Tents  is a thing not to be imagined Yea on the contrary we have more Reason to believe that they conduce very much to retain them For supposing that any thing remains in a  Wound  as a Bullet Pieces of Bone of Cloaths or Wad  c  it is almost impossible ever to draw it forth at the same Place by which it entred unless it be at the first or second Dressing And this happens very seldom tho' never without great Pain and much Time or Trouble  There is no Probability that a Body so heavy as  Lead  can remain for any considerable time in one Place unless it stick in some Bone or Joynt The Flesh has not solidity sufficient to detain the  Bullet  but gradually yields to its descending Weight and supposing it did not stir of it self yet so far wou'd a  Tent  be from furthering its coming out that it would rather fix it faster and push it deeper into the  Wound  Now the  Matter  ever follows the  Bullet  and makes to it self one or more Cavities it gathers together encreases ferments and commonly brings on a Fever the Part is weaken'd the Body wasted  and in fine the wounded Person frequently is brought to an untimely End The like Accidents may also be produc'd by the Splinter of a Bone or some such other thing after the same manner Hence it is that on the least Suspition whether from the Complaint of the Wounded or any other Appearance of a forreign Body remaining in the  Wound  Search is made thereinto with Instruments and with the Fingers but for the most part to no purpose as I have often seen And all this to satisfy themselves and to shew to the Bystanders and to the Patient that no Diligence has been spar'd to further the Cure This Method is no less hurtful than cruel and by exasperating the Parts causes Fluxions and brings on Putrefaction yea oftentimes incurable Fistula's But when all these foresaid Means fall short of Success then a lower Part is sought out therein to make a counteropening which sometimes when the Patient is of a strong Constitution effects the Cure  Pieces of Garments of Wad of Linnen  c  are often carried by the  Bullet  into the  Wound  and there remain after it is drawn out being deeper lodg'd These things are but too capable of occasioning troublesome Accidents and  Tents  conduce not a little to keep them there obstructing the Passage whereby they might be expell'd It is certain that a  Tent  always swells in the Wound and filling up the  Orifice  keeps  in the  Matter  which not being longer to be contain'd within the narrow Bounds of the Wound spreads it self into the neighbouring Parts glides between the  Muscles  and carries along with it the  Extraneous Bodies  which are there corrupted and putrify'd and infecting the Wound occasion Mortifications or Abscesses very hard to be cur'd  I say then to conclude this Chapter that it is altogether in vain to use  Tents  with a Design thereby to facilitate the Discharge of  Forreign Bodies  and that they rather conduce to keep them in than assist in furthering their Passage But if by Chance it should fall out as sometimes it does that the Wound close up when there is some  Extraneous Body  within it will occasion an Abscess either under the Ancient Escar or somewhere else more convenient for  Nature  by the opening of which only whatever is hurtful and improfitable will be discharg'd  As for leaden  Bullets  that have not been drawn out at the first Dressing their remaining in the Parts can do no great hurt because they are friendly to Nature and in process of Time by their own Weight slip down between the Muscles and often appear under the Skin from whence they may be taken out without either Trouble or Danger The most Part of Surgeons are convinc'd of the Truth of what I say Only this I must acknowledge that we ought to endeavour to draw forth such Bullets as are  either lodg'd in a Joynt or in hazard of falling into some Cavity of the Body as that of the Scull of the  Thorax  or of the lower Belly where they might be irrecoverably lost  CHAP V Of the Fourth End of  Tents    AS for the fourth pretended Use of  Tents  I grant that they are always soak'd with the Moisture of the Wound but as they retain that Humidity not suffering it to pass out so they are thereby swell'd up and enabled to intercept the Passage of all the other Matter that is generated Now I would willingly hear a Reason for keeping in a Wound Excrements which Nature is so sollicitous to throw out for being corrupted by their Abode they alter and destroy the Constitution of the Parts that contain 'em Seeing then the longer the Matter is detain'd the more it is deprav'd I am perswaded 'tis much better to give it a free Passage not interrupting its Course than to shut it up with Tents and force it to take other ways  Having therefore demonstrated that the Ends that have been designed by the Use of  Tents  in so far as they are for the Advantage of the Wounded may not only be attain'd without 'em but are really hindred thereby I will endeavour in the following Chapter to  take the part of  Oppressed Nature  and to assert her Liberty by Reasons founded on the Circulation of the  Blood  and supported by the Authority of many Authors  CHAP VI Consequences deduc'd from the preceding Chapters  NAture  hath been diversly defined by Authors who have treated therein  Julius Alexandrinus  calls it  The Author the Principle and Efficient Cause of natural Beings  In this Sense it is regarded in  Physick  as the Cause of  Health  and the  Physician  of Distempers and is by  Van Helmont  considered in three different States to wit either in its full Strength and Vigour or as impaired and weakened or as altogether oppress'd and prostrate  These things might be apply'd to our present Purpose however that I may give a more clear and intelligible  Idea  of  Nature  which may better suit with outward Diseases I shall look upon her as the  Chief Worker of whatsoever concerns our Health  and I am perswaded seeing she has fram'd every thing according to the Law of its being she will also maintain them in their necessary  Vnion  unite them when divided and  in a Word restore them to their first Estate when any way fallen from it  This  Vnion  is so necessary for maintaining  Health  and preserving  Life  that all or at least the most part of  Diseases  proceed from a Defect therein For things of a forreign Quality are one Way or other mixed with the  Humours  of the Body which disordering and interrupting the  Vnion  of their Parts change and deprave the good  Temperament  and Qualities of the  natural Balsam  called  Radical Moisture  and from hence come  Diseases  and  Death    In outward Maladies also and in Divisions of the harder or softer Parts of the Body manifest to the external Senses it is plain that  Nature  suffers and consequently must strive with all her Might to reunite the divided Parts The Surgeon as her faithful Minister in curing Wounds ought to imploy his utmost Care to assist her while she labours to effect that so necessary  Vnion  To this End he shou'd not only leave her at Liberty putting no Hindrance in her Way but also free her from whatever may thwart her Design Finally he must assist and imitate her mind her  Inclinations  observe her  Proceedings  and follow her as it were step by step that he may be ever ready to lend her his required Help  The Art of Physick turns upon this Principle that  Nature has the chief Hand in curing Diseases  'tis with her the Physician ought to consult and  without her Consent as it were he ought never to do or undertake any thing and in a Word he only is the ablest  Physitian  who has most earnestly apply'd himself to the study of  Nature    I acknowledge there are many Cases wherein  Nature  alone is not sufficient and in these she must be helpt out by the Hand of  Art  as in the drawing out of  Extraneous Bodies  from Wounds cutting off mortify'd Parts opening Abscesses restoring broken or disjoynted Bones and other like Operations belonging to the Province of  Surgery  But let a Surgeon be never so superficially acquainted with Nature he may easily perceive that by  Tents  and  Dilaters  she is oppress'd depriv'd of Liberty of acting and directly oppos'd in her Design which is to reunite the divided Parts  Fabricius ab Aquapendente  whom I mention'd before asserts that  Nature never cures a Wound so long as any thing is in it which she can't retain  For in this he is agreed with the most Judicious that 'tis Nature that works the Cure and at the same time shews that a Tent is such an Enemy to her as neither ought nor can be kept within but to her hurt and destruction  Galen  also in his third Book of Method says that 'tis not the Remedies but Nature that closes up Wounds  Wherefore Experience having convinc'd me of this Truth I set my self to consider  Nature's  Designs her Inclinations and the Way  she takes to effect the Cure of Wounds and have observ'd that  Tents  do ever oppose and prove a Hindrance to her 'Tis every Day to be seen that  Nature  can suffer nothing forreign to abide with her she endeavours with all her might to free her self from  Tents  and  Dossels  with which Wounds are ordinarily cram'd up For tho' they did not occasion pain as we may well assur'd they do yet being  Extraneous Bodies  Nature can't endure them without trouble and let them be never so small or soft they must necessarily press always upon some  Vessels  of which the Body is nothing else but a Contexture  According to their bigness and hardness Tents do more or less disturb the course and order of the Circulation of the  Blood  so far as the Wound reaches They squeeze out the most subtil part of that or other Liquors contain'd in the Vessels they press upon which by the Matter already in the Wound is converted into its own Nature and becomes a Ferment that being retain'd grows hot and corrupt and so alters the containing and neighbouring Parts and oftentimes imparts its vicious qualities to the Mass of Blood by Vapours sent into the Veins yea the Matter it self is suck'd up by the Veins their Orifices being dilated by its Fermentation Moisture and stay and this circulating with the Blood intirely corrupts it and causes Fevers that end in Death unless Nature by some critical and  healthful Motion throw out the Corruption  Ambrosius Pareus  in his ninth Book treating of Wounds Chap forbids the Use of Tents in few words being therein supported by the Authority of  Galen  who in the fourth Chapter of his  Method  affirms it to be necessary in all Wounds whither simple or compound that nothing be between their Lips that may hinder Reunion The same  Pareus  in his ninth Book Chap recommends the Use of long and thick Tents in the Beginning and afterwards advises to make 'em more thin and short but does not here forbid their Use In the same Book Chap he takes the part of  Tents  in opposition to a certain Physician that had written against his Method  These differing and contradictory Opinions in one and the same Author must of necessity throw the young Surgeon into perplexing doubts so that often he can't know what is best or what way is most secure 'Tis certain however that the mischief of  Tents  was known to  Galen  because he forbids their Use and also to that Physician who found fault with the Practice of  Pareus  his name I know not but by the acknowledgment of the same Author he altogether lays aside the use of Tents and orders to dress a Wound but once in four Days This Method therefore is not so new as at first I thought with my self for I had form'd my design ere ever I was aware of what I have here  quoted and it was  Experience  only that opened my Eyes  Galen  Justifies further my Opinion in his third Book  of Method  and ninth Chapter when he says that in every Wound there are two sorts of Excrements a gross and a subtil which as he affirms hinder the generation of Flesh Now if this be so it is very preposterous to keep them in the Wound with  Tents  If it be said that the Tents may be made so little as not altogether to fill up the  Orifice  nor hinder the passage of the  Matter  I answer that tho' they be made never so small yet will they fill up the Mouth of the Wound because they ever swell up to the bigness of the Space they are in but supposing the most subtil matter to escape yet the more gross and clammy is by them retain'd and is enough to occasion grievous Accidents Now if small Tents prove such a hindrance to the curing of Wounds what may be expected from these that are long and hard and pass to the very Bottom However these also are used by many Surgeons who for want of applying themselves to the consideration of  Nature  and her Intentions in curing of Wounds continue to follow a Method that is both cruel and destructive  Tents Dilaters  and  Setons  always occasion Disorders in the Places where they are apply'd if they touch the  Nerves  they cause extremity of Pain that is often the Original of many Evils and  follow'd by many grievous Accidents such as Convulsions loss of Sense c If they bear upon a  Tendon  its Action is hurt and motion ceases if they press the  Vessels  as they almost ever do the Circulation of the Blood is disturb'd  But suppose a Tent should only press together the  Mamellons fibrenx  fibrous  Papillae  that compose the Skin which are of a quick sense being the Instrument of  touching  this alone were enough to disturb the Order and Distribution of the Spirits which now moving in a tumultuary way among these fibrous  Papillae  of the Skin contract them by the Irritation and pricking which they cause Now the Fibers being shortned and the Skin contracted the Vessels must of necessity be doubled or squeez'd together and consequently the Circulation diminish'd or intirely suppress'd In these Cases there is not so much Blood carried back by the Veins as was brought by the Arteries Now if the Circulation is altogether stopt a Mortification ensues if considerably diminisht an Abscess but if the Humours ouze into the Wound from the Capellary Vessels large and tedious Suppurations are occasion'd  The Hardness and Swelling are caus'd by the Matter that is stopt and diffus'd about the Place and therefore all the Accidents are more or less grievous and alter according to the force of the Compression and quantity of  the diffused Matter the good or bad Disposition of the Blood of the Humors or of the Part affected and the different Degrees of the Natural Heat which hastens or keeps back the Fermentation and Putrefaction  From what hath been said it appears that the Blood and Humours are not carried or drawn as some Authors love to speak to the afflicted Part more abundantly than at other times altho' the Spirits run thither in much greater Plenty But as for the Blood it is evident enough that it circulates less in the wounded than in the sound Parts because it moves with greatest Ease in these latter And it is a Law of Nature that a Body in motion always moves towards these places where it finds least Opposition  The truth of this is clearly demonstrated by the Accidents which some time ago followed on certain Malignant Fevers in places not far distant from hence They caused an Obstruction and swelling in the lower Belly so considerable that the Circulation was stopt and a Gangreen ensu'd But on the contrary the Blood was violently and in too great quantity carried upwards it could not be contain'd within the Vessels broke thro' all Obstacles and caus'd sharp Pains Abscesses  Deliriums  and Death  I have considered the Accidents that most commonly attend Wounds and do believe  that for the most part they proceed from the Disorder of the Circulation of the Blood occasion'd by broken pieces of Bones Bullets or some other Foreign thing remaining in the Wound These things are not of such a Figure as to cause an Irritation nor can they of themselves produce any putrefaction and yet they commonly bring on Abscesses We ought not then to ascribe these Accidents to  Pain  for sometimes they come without it and this often is present where those don't happen But I am of Opinion that these extraneous Bodies press the Vessels that are dispers'd through the place where they are and stop the Blood which slipping into the Pores and Spaces of the Flesh by its stay and Fermentation is there corrupted and chang'd unto the Matter of an Abscess  'Tis true Leaden Bullets or other things of a like Nature have been long in the Body and yet no Abscess hath followed but this may be attributed to the largeness of the Place wherein they happen'd to be lodg'd so as not to occasion any Disorder or because sliding between the Muscles it did not hinder the Course of the Humours The other Accidents that ordinarily attend  Gunshot Wounds  are also occasion'd by the Defect of the Circulation as I shall observe in the Sequel of this Discourse where it shall be made to appear that  Tents  and  Dilaters  us'd in this sort of  Wounds hinder the fall of the Escar the Dissolution of what is bruised and the passing out of whatever ought to be brought away  This will without difficulty be granted by those who well understand the Course of the  Blood  and  Humours  and the Union and Order of the Parts that compose the Body All the Parts are so united one to another that the least Separation can't be made without Pain Effusion of some Humour or some other Disorder Experience shews that 'tis not only the Air that rots the Bones but also the Nourishment of the Nervous Parts when it is altered by a malignant Acid and generally any Matter that has Acidity enough to cause a Fermentation and Corruption in the place of its Abode when kept in by Tents or other such Obstacle  Tho'  Doleus  in his Surgery is not altogether against the using of Tents yet he shews that we ought to do it with great Caution from whence it appears he Judg'd them dangerous  Etmullerus  is of the same mind in his Physical Surgery where he Joyns such Accidents with the Use of Tents as ought to fright those who imploy 'em He advises the using of  Pledgets  and quite to lay aside Tents in Wounds of the  Nerves  and  Tendons  and in these of the Joynts Hence it appears that this Auther was no great Favourer of Tents for which Reason he orders the Use of the vulnerary Balsam in the cure of  Wounds which promotes the generation of Flesh and causes a speedy Union to both which the Use of Tents is directly contray  All the famous Physicians who have treated of Surgery and the curing of Wounds are well nigh of the same Opinion I could reckon up a great number if I thought that these I have adduc'd were not enough It appears as I have said in the Preface that  Septalius  and  Magatus  both renowned Physicians that practised Surgery in  Italy  followed this Method for the space of forty years with very good Success  M Caufapé  Doctor of Physick in his Observations on the frequent Use of Bleeding altogether discards the Use of Tents without any Reserve He supports his opinion with Reasons which I had conceived before his Book came to my Hands But we may be sure that Author did not write on this Subject before he was fully convinc'd by his own Experience of what he advanc'd It would be an unpardonable Rashness for one to write and maintain that of which he doubted the Truth and to establish a Method on false Principles  I very well know that great Numbers will oppose themselves to what I advance on this Subject which is the common Fate of all Opinions that appear new but of this Matter  Experience  only is the most competent Judge whose Testimony shall be deduc'd at large and with  all Faithfulness in the second Part of this Work  In this first part I make account sufficiently to explain the Reasons that oblig'd me to lay aside the Use of Tents and Dilaters I can't approve their proceeding who use them because others have done so or because the Ancients have ordered it The Glory or Blame of the Good or Ill Success say they accrues not to us we have Custom and Antiquity for our Warrant But the  Arts  and  Sciences  ought never to be shut up within such narrow and unequal Bounds  Knowledge Reason  and  Experience  would be injur'd to the highest Degree if we should impose upon them such severe Restrictions and take from them that Liberty which should last equally with the World  CHAP VII Reasons to demonstrate the Mischief of Tents  MAny of the Ancients and some of the modern Writers have spoken of Tents as things indifferent Such Authors I mean as having written of Surgery and the Cure of Wounds seem to have brought these things to some Perfection They leave it to the Discretion of the  Surgeon  either to use them or not according as they Judg'd convenient They did not think this matter of such Moment as to require their Attention They look'd on these Means with unconcern'd Eyes referring themselves therein to the Honesty of those who first wrote of them 'Tis apparent they had not observ'd as I have often done the mischief occasion'd by Tents the use of which destroys indifferently the Vulgar with Persons of Merit whose loss in a State is always to be regretted  We need not be surprised at what we see happen every day in the Cure of all sorts of  Wounds  'tis not at this time only that one thing has been taken for another Our Knowledge is not so great as to reach to all necessary Truths nor do we perfectly understand the Causes of all the Accidents and Disorders that follow upon Wounds All those who have treated of this Subject have endeavoured to explain them according to their opinions as I have done my best to accommodate them to mine But Occasions are now frequent enough and therefore it will be easie for any one to inform himself of the truth and to distinguish who are in the Right and who not  M De la Chariere  in his Book of  Operations  discoursing of Wounds advises carefully to wipe away all the matter of a Wound and to fill up every the very least corner with Dilaters or Dossels to hinder its staying lest it should be  suck'd up by the Veins and carried by the Circulation to the Heart The same Author adds that the Air is a most powerful Enemy to Wounds Nevertheless it is impossible to dry up the Matter with all that exactness he requires what diligence soever be us'd without taking up some time during which the  Air  will do incomparably more Harm than the Matter that therein might have remain'd which often is not endu'd with all these ill Qualities one is apt to imagine as shall be made to appear in the fourth Chapter of the last Part of this Treatise  This Author acknowledges that in  Contusions  a little extravasated Blood squeezes together the Vessels interrupts the Course of the Blood and Humours and causes Fluxions and Inflammations What then may be expected from a like quantity of Dossels heap'd one upon another They encrease the Division made in the Body and oppose the Design that one ought chiefly to have Regard to in curing of Wounds which is Reunion To this may be added that they are more hard painful and contrary to Nature than a little Blood of which he speaks  As for what is alledg'd by him that the Matter might otherwise be taken up by the Veins it is not to be apprehended unless it were of so great a Quantity as to ferment or made so long a stay in the Part as to open and dilate the Orifices of the Vessels This may indeed fall out in  Wounds of the Breast as will appear in the second Part of this Book and in these of the  Thorax  where the capacity and heat of the Part are sufficient to produce that Effect This also may happen in great Abscesses whereof we will give some Examples at the End of this Work Finally this may arrive when the Mouth of a Wound is stop'd up with Tents or Dilaters which too often keep the Matter shut up from one Dressing to another hence it increases ferments and ordinarly acquires a vicious and malignant Quality which may be communicated to the Heart by means of the Circulation of the Blood  Of all those Mischiefs  Tents  and  Dossels  may be accounted the chief Occasion Now to avoid all these Accidents and the staying of the Matter in the Wound we need only leave open the Orifice and put nothing into the Cavity which may increase the Separation of the Parts to the end they may come together when there is nothing to hinder their Reunion nor any empty Space where the Matter may make any considerable stay These I think are good Reasons and strong enough to overthrow an Opinion that is contrary to my ten or twelve years  Experience    The same  M De la Charriere  a little further says that the Orifice of a Wound must be dilated when it is so little that it will not suffer  Dossels  to enter that so it may be fill'd therewith  and I on the contrary widen it that I may avoid the using of them for Reasons mention'd before Moreover it is to be fear'd that a  Dilater  may be lost and fixt in a deep  Wound  Of this we have had sufficient Proof in the Person of one of our  Generals  and many others wounded in the Battel of  Marseils    Wherefore if Tents may be laid aside as has been done in this Hospital even in deep Wounds of the most fleshly parts of the Body much more ought they to be forborn in others  The same  Author  before mention'd rejects the use of Tents excepting in Wounds of the Breast and lower Belly that penetrate Notwithstanding it may be seen in the second Part of this Treatise where we discourse of Wounds in the Breast in what manner we have cured many such of different Natures without the Assistance of  Tents    As for those in the lower Belly I know it may be said to me that if I have not us'd Tents to them it is long of the difficulty of their Application and stay in this Part where by reason of the continual motion they can't be kept in unless with a very strait Bandage But the matter is otherwise for indeed I see not for what Reason Tents are required to this part any more than to others Let us suppose now that the expected Suppuration of the contained Parts that are wounded is already begun 'tis impossible the Matter can come away while the  Orifice is stopt up with a Tent but it must fall down by its own weight into the lower part of that Cavity also what Matter or Blood may there be collected can't be discharg'd by reason of the Tent which is as a Dam to keep it in especially if we wait till the Suppuration of the Teguments which is never great be excited by Irritation or by Tents Otherwise the Motion in Breathing and the lifting up of the  Peritonaeum  in Inspiration will drive out the Matter as it breeds if a free passage be allow'd it  There is one Case wherein Dilaters and sometimes Tents become in a manner necessary and that is when a Wound is accompanied with a considerable Bleeding then they may be us'd to carry Astringents to the opening of the Vessels and to support and keep them on chiefly in deep Wounds For if at first we should Joyn the Lips of the Wound and apply Astringents upon them the outward Bleeding might be represt before that of the Vessels were restrain'd and so the Blood running between the Muscles would there be corrupted and would spoil the Parts wherein it is contain'd and these that border upon them and might also occasion Suffocation and a Gangrene This is what I saw at  Turin  to befall the Baron  de la Serra  a Gentleman of  Savoy  who being wounded with a Sword near the right Armpit had a branch of the  Vena Subclavia  opened he was dress'd by a very expert Surgeon who whether by  chance or otherwise neglected to apply Astringents to the Opening of the Vessel tho' the Bleeding was very great the Wound was joyned and the Part loaded with Astringents which were made fast with Compresses and Bandage In the mean time the Blood continu'd to run from the Vein and to diffuse it self between the Muscles of the Breast Two or three Days past before the first Dressings were taken off and then the  Thorax  was found to be gangren'd The wounded Person dy'd in a little time after  The Cause of this Gangrene can't reasonably be ascrib'd to any thing else but the retaining of the Blood and Matter which finding no Outlet press'd together by reason of their bulk the Vessels and the Nerves and hindred the Circulation of the Blood and Course of the Spirits and other Liquors so that the  Blood  became quickly corrupted and caus'd all these Disorders These same Accidents may be occasion'd by  Matter  shut up in the Cavity of Wounds by  Tents  stopping their Orifice especially if that Matter is considerable for its Quantity and very much crowded  When in my younger Days I frequented Hospitals and practis'd with very able Surgeons I have seen at time of dressing the Tents for the most part expell'd from the Wounds in spite of the Bolsters and Bandage Nature then clearly signifying her Intention Nevertheless  they continued still to use them forcibly thrusting them again into the Wounds tho' not without much Pain What a strange Method is this How is it possible for a Wound to close up so long as a forreign Body is entertain'd within it If a Pea or a litttle Ball be kept in an Issue tho' for ten Years it will still remain open but if you take it out but for one half Day you shall find it intirely fill'd up  A Tent does the same to a Wound that the Ball does to an Issue and  Fistula's  that trouble so many People all their Life are the Effect of Tents that have been inconsideratly us'd in the Cure of their Wounds The Humours take their Course through these Places which they find open this becomes first habitual and then natural and necessary and thereby the Flesh is hardened and becomes callous These Impurities which  Nature  sometimes evacuates by ways surprizing to us being detain'd in one Place became a Bag of Mattet and that same  Nature  unwilling that any thing superfluous and unprofitable should remain with her by a peculiar Sagacity makes a Vertue of Necessity and uses these Passages she finds open to free herself from the Excrements and Humours that disturb her but at the same time a part of the  Baume radical  Radical Balsam  which is the Life and support of the Parts passes out also by the same ways  I know not to what I can better compare these Openings in the Body through which Humors take their Course than to these of Trees whether made by Nature herself or the assisting hand of Man by which the Sap that nourishes both its Trunk and the other parts passes out The difference only lies here that these help to encrease and preserve the Trees but those to destroy and weaken the Body  For certain it is that  Fistula's  considerably impair the Parts never leave those that have them in an intire State of Health and shorten their Days whatever any may alledge to the contrary But that which surprises me most is to find the afflicted Persons support the Inconveniencies they suffer with a kind of Satisfaction fancying that if in time they should permit their Sores to close up then Death would undoubtedly soon after follow  Wherefore when there is nothing to hinder the filling up of a  Wound  Art hath nothing else to do but to observe Nature's Proceedings which sometimes exceeds in the breeding of Flesh in soft Parts and sometimes in generating the  Callus  in hard Parts But 'tis observable that in curing Wounds she proves oftner superfluous than deficient Thus it appears that  Tents  ought not to be us'd in Wounds seeing Nature very frequently throws 'em out because she can't bear the presence of what is forreign Don't we see that so soon as  she is opprest with any thing hurtful all her Endeavours are us'd to get rid of it She has a thousand means unknown to us and often takes such secret and singular ways as are hidden from the most Curious Anatomists That young Man under the Care of  Fernelius  who had swallowed an Ear of Grass that came out some time after by a little Abscess between two of his Ribs is a sufficient Demonstration of this Truth  Ambrosius Pareus  also relates that he took from the Groin of a Woman a Needle that had entered at the Hip of the same side In fine the consideration of the surprizing Ways whereby these extraneous things were cast out of the Body obliges us to conclude that Nature is very wise and can't endure the least thing that is hurtful or disquieting A little Dust in the Eye disturbs all her Oeconomy and no rest is to be expected till it is out A small Crum of Bread that goes not the right Way but is by some motion or the agitation of a little Air thrown into the Windpipe does it not endanger Suffocation What endeavours are made to cast it out The Air breaks forth with Violence from the Lungs the whole Body is shaken all its Parts are in motion the Face is inflam'd the Eyes run with Tears Convulsions follow and this admirable Masterpiece of Nature is all in trouble and Disorder and all this for a thing in appearance most inconsiderable A Stone or a little Sand in the  Reins Ureters Bladder or  Vrethra  will scarce permit a moments rest for the violent Pain And indeed our Life may be called an Image of Death so long as a Stone is lodg'd in any of these Parts so true is it that Nature abhors what disturbs her  Now 'tis to be observ'd that according to our Method the  Dilaters  and  Tents  with which the Wound was filled hitherto must be taken out so soon as the Bleeding is stop'd and that the surest way is for the Surgeon altogether hence forth to leave off such dangerous Means because their use may irritate and at the same time by touching the Vessels may open them and renew the Bleeding which by protracting the Cure occasions new troubles to the Wounded as I have often seen  Fabricius ab Aquapendente Part  I  Book    Chap  speaking of transverse Wounds of the  Forehead  advises to apply long and slender Compresses wet with the White of an Egg one on each side of the Wound and to press them together so that the Lips may touch without stitching especially if we would avoid the Deformity of a  Scar  Now I know no Reason why the same Method mayn't be put in practice in Wounds of other Parts of the Body made by cutting Instruments Nor do I understand why such should be dilated seeing they require only Reunion For my own part I have practis'd this way in many Places and  on different parts of the Body with the desired Success  These who are unprejudicated or will reflect but a little on the common  Method  will be convinc'd that I don't without Cause reject it 'Tis easie enough to apprehend the Cause of the perpetual Pains suffered by those miserable Persons whose Wounds are fill'd with  Tents  and  Dossils  For having thrust into the Sore Lint twisted hard and uneven and apply'd thereon Plaisters and Bolsters all is made fast with a Bandage that passes several times about the Part Now tho' this may seem not to be very strait yet it is ever tight enough to press upon the  Tent  and cause it to touch every where upon lively and sensible Parts For the inward Parts of our Body are indeed very sensible and unaccustomed to the Touch of any extraneous thing so that the Wounded can't move in the least without great Pain his wounded Members are utterly disabled and by a kind of Necessity he is confin'd to his Bed as a lame and impotent Paralitick and always in one Posture which is no less if not more pernicious than the Wound it self especially in Hospitals where the Beds not being such as are requisite for the Ease and Comfort of the Sick cause almost universal Excoriations and oftentimes Mortifications and Gangrenes This is what I have many times seen and frequently through the Fault  of those who follow the ordinary Method of Dressing  Not that other Parts of our Body are distitute of Sense any more than these I just now spoke of those that are so charitable as to visit Hospitals will attest this nothing is there to be heard at the Hours of Dressing but Cries and Howlings But we can't enough recommend to Surgeons on this Occasion to use their Patients in the most gentle manner possible For it must be own'd that there are some among them that would think they had not acquitted themselves as they ought unless they made those under their hands to roar out for some considerable Time which makes many to think that Surgery and Cruelty are unseparable  CHAP VIII The Reasons of the Authors Practice with the Motives that induc'd him thereto  FRom what I have already said I know I shall be accus'd as if I only writ to find fault with the  Methods  now in use Nevertheless I am not affraid to avow that I am inspir'd with a much Nobler Design I take no pleasure to trample upon the Monuments of the  Dead or to carp at the Living 'tis Conscience alone that obliges me to maintain what I have advanc'd for the Good of the Publick But as it will be an hard task to perswade some People of what is contrary to these Maxims they have suck'd in as it were with their Milk it will be convenient to propose Examples of what ought to be followed and to point forth what is to be shun'd For in fine 'tis here as in Religions every one thinks his own Method the best  Among the great number of those who at this Day practice  Surgery  there are very few whose  Methods  agree Some without departing an hair's breadth from the Opinion of the  Ancients  blindly follow their Dictates and it is enough that any thing has been advanc'd by such or such an Author to make it pass into an unviolable Law Others more active and Ingenious not regarding the received Custom bestow liberal Jeers upon whatever is not the Product of their own Brain and treading Antiquity under foot are every day making new Systems of  Surgery  I know not with which party I shall be ranged But I have done my best to accommodat what the Ancients have delivered to the Opinion of the Moderns and Circulation of the Blood imitating in this the  Bees  that gather from every Flower what is fit for making Honey And if  Experience  may have any Sway my Practice ought to obtain as being confir'm'd by it  These who extol the Cures they have done have also Reason to support their Practice which because of the Progress it has made passes even at this Day for the best and most secure in many Places This Error hath taken so deep Root and gain'd so many Followers that notwithstanding all my Experiences I doubt not but many will stand out against my Method reject my feeble Reasoning and treat me as a Violater of Custom and received Maxims and a rash and inconsiderate Innovator For with them it is a general Rule That a deep Wound ought to be kept long open in order to a perfect Cure Yea the Sick themselves being prepossess'd in favour of this false Opinion believe that the Accidents which happen some Months yea some Years after they have been cur'd proceed from the too speedy closing up of the Wound alledging the Wolf was shut up in the Sheepfold As for my self I am perswaded and am able to maintain it that almost all such Accidents are caus'd by keeping the Wound too long open whereby the parts being much weakened are hard to be restored to their first State so that the lest motion or Excess renews the  Sore  and brings back the  Symptoms    As for Wounds of the Head where the Scull is laid bare Exfoliation infallibly insues if they are long kept open If the  Cranium  is broken the alteration and the Accidents are yet more  considerable and cause often a Weakness a depravation of Sense Giddiness Headach and other like Distempers and sometimes a corruption of the Membranes and of the Brain  It is most certain that a Wound cannot be kept long open but a great Suppuration shall follow and then in spite of all precaution the Matter that is every where diffus'd will glide along and rest upon the Bone and the most subtle Parts as  Galen  says passing into the Capacity of the Scull by the Fracture will fall upon the Membranes from whence it can't be got out but by the Operation of the Trepan and if neglected will bring on Mortal Symptoms  Wounds of the  Thorax  or Breast may be clos'd up without Danger as will be more largely made out by Experience in some Places of the second Part of this Work For those which continue to suppurate for a long time do infallibly bring on the Tissick Asthma's the Cough shortness of Breath and incurable  Fistula  's  Tents  cannot be kept in Wounds of the lower Belly because of the perpetual Motion of the Guts and consequently such are secure from the Pains and Infirmities that follow upon their Use  Wounds of the  Reins  of the  Emulgent Veins  and of the  Vreters  if not speedily united leave behind them incurable  Fistula's  with a running  of Urine at the Wound The same falls out in those of the Bladder  In these of the Joynts if Tents be us'd the Cure is very tedious difficult and dangerous for commonly there follows upon them an Alteration of the Tendons of the Nerves and of all the Part sometimes a shortening or lengthening of the Member with loss of the nutricious Juice and a Weakness that endures for Life  Wounds of the Extremities cause an intire dissolution of the Nerves and often the loss of the Members those of the Bones Rottenness Those of the Flesh moreover besides a great deal of time spent in vain occasion much Pain Vexation and Charges  I have seen Wounds of all these sorts some of them I have had dress'd with Tents where powerful Digestives were us'd to procure great Suppurations I have met with others that were followed by all such Accidents But this I have ever observ'd that these which were handled according to my Method were preserv'd from all these troublesome Symptoms  'Tis known to every one that in Wounds made by cutting Instruments Union is immediatly to be endeavour'd In order to this design therefore we ought not to fill such Wounds with Lint as we have formerly said seeing this directly thwarts it It is also very hurtful to  use Digestives because disordering the Contexture of its parts they corrupt the Blood  The fall of the  Escar  in Gunshot Wounds cannot be prevented whatever Diligence be us'd wherefore Suppuratives are here of no Use seeing Nature can do that Work without their Assistance which only weaken and destroy the temperament of the Parts to which they are apply'd Large Suppurations therefore are not necessary in the curing of Wounds  For in fine I can't discover any Reason why it should be Judg'd requisite that a Wound should suppurat a long time in order to be brought to a compleat Cure And surely before we abandon our selves to such a dangerous Practice it is necessary first to understand what  Pus  or  Matter  is whence it comes and what is the necessity of it  We may observe then that  Matter  is nothing else but the  Blood  of ulcerated Parts discharg'd into the Wound from the Orifices of Arteries that are cut or torn and this is mix'd with the Nutricious Juice brought to the Parts for their Sustenance whereby they are rendred lame as it were and useless If by the Compression of  Tents  or  Dilaters  the Blood be squeez'd out of the Vessels it may fill the Capacity of the  Wound  whereas otherwise it would have held on its ordinary Course We are not then to be surpriz'd if the  Blood  and the  Nutricious Juice  are suddenly turn'd into  Matter  seeing they  are out of their natural Place For even as a small Rivulet may make a great Lake if its Waters are kept in with a Dam just so the little Pipes that are laid open in a  tho' but small in comparison with the  of its Cavity being press'd as has been said by a  Tent  which divides 'em more and hinders their Reunion continually pour forth such Liquors as they contain and the Tent serving for a Bank a Lake is form'd in the Cavity of the Wound We ought not therefore to wonder if Plentiful Suppurations continue so long as this Method is followed and it is an undoubted Error to account such Evacuations profitable  Etmullerus  in his Medicinal Surgery is of Opinion that a Wound would close up of it self if it was not hindered he says we ought to endeavour to prevent the marring and putrifying of the  Natural Balsam  of the wounded Part and to use  Balsamicks  according to the Principles of  Helmont  to hinder it from degenerating into a hurtful Acid and to preserve it from corrupting  In fine he finds Fault with the Surgeons for using first  Suppuratives  then  Digestives  and after  Mundificatives Sarcoticks  and  Glutinatives  as they term them  That Way  adds he  is too tedious delays the Cure causes Inflammation of the Part alters the  Nutricious Juice  and often turns the  Wound  into a  sordid Ulcer  It is apparent by this Authority that  One Remedy skilfully manag'd  is sufficient to answer all the Intentions proposed in the Cure of Wounds that  great Suppurations  are hurtful and that it is for the great Advantage of the wounded to reject the  bulky Rubbish of improfitable  Druggs  As for such Divisions in the Body where many small Vessess are quite cut asunder if the Lips of the Wound are brought together they will unite of themselves and this according to the Opinion of many  Authors  vouched also by  Experience  providing nothing Extraneous go between  Now touching  Gunshot Wounds  that are so common in the Hospitals of the Army I am bold to affirm that my Practice has given me more Insight into their Nature than all the Authors that ever wrote on the Subject But not to enter upon a Debate concerning Bullets it is evident that the Effect they produce in the Body do something resemble Cauterizing yet tho' sometimes I use this Word I can scarcely believe that they really cauterize but being round solid and compact Bodies they cause Contusion they tear and bruise whatever is in their Way and occasion a Heaviness in the wounded Part  It is certain that the Bullet very often stops the Bleeding of the Wound whether by the Disorder it causes in the Parts through which it  passes or by cauterizing with its touch the Arteries and Veins But be it how it will the Course of the Blood is stopt and the Passage between the Arteries and Veins is intercepted so far as the Wound and Contusion reach The Heart according to the Law of Circulation squeezes the Blood it has receiv'd into the  Aorta  from whence passing into all the other Arteries its Course is stopt at the Wound where it can't as formerly be receiv'd by the Veins and finding no free passage it extends the containing Vessels and forcing its Way diffuses it self according to its own Quantity and the Space it finds Hence proceeds the Hardness Swelling and Inflammation so ordinary in  Gunshot Wounds  If the Blood be there corrupted or spoilt by some  Malignant Acid  the Symptoms become yet more troublesome and obstinate and after the Fall of the Escar Abscesses or large and grievous Suppurations ensue  A simple  Convulsion  only for like Reasons is capable  produce the same Accidents which being nothing but a disordering of the Fibers and little Pipes that changes the Regularity and Situation of the Pores the Circulation is rendred uneasy and the Part choak'd up From hence comes the Dulness and Absence of the Spirits which if not speedily recall'd can't but be attended with grievous Consequences  I shall speak a word or two of the Cure of a  Contusion  in the last Part of this Book Here I shall only shew that Tents are very destructive to Gunshot Wounds in regard they hinder the Fall of the Escar and coming away of whatever is bruis'd which ordinarly is consum'd by Suppuration A Tent actually hinders the passing out of that  Matter  and retains it in the Wound where it causes all these Mischiefs of which we have spoken It may also after the Escar is remov'd renew the Bleeding bruising by its rubs and bringing to Suppuration the young Flesh bred upon the Orifices of the wounded Vessels while the Escar was a separating  The multitude of those that are to be seen maimed and with wooden Legs and  Fistula  's can witness to their Sorrow the Pernicious Effects of  Tents  yea how many are there who by the Loss of their Lives shew their fatal Consequences Cou'd they have spoken from the Grave they wou'd have said more than I can on this mournful Subject and the destructive Custom had soon been supprest Nevertheless the Pains suffer'd by these unfortunate Persons their Complaints and Cries have not yet been able to cause a  Method  establish'd and authoriz'd by Antiquity to be laid aside neither has the ill Success of so many Cures in vain attempted been hitherto capable to undeceive those who have practis'd  Surgery    However I thought my self oblig'd to communicate to the Publick what I knew upon this  Subject  that I might if possible procure for afflicted Patients a  Gentle Speedy  and  Easie Method  for the Comfort and Incouragement of such as so generously expose their Life for the  Glory  of their Prince and the  Good  of their  Country    All my  Practice  is levell'd at these Ends as may be seen by the Sequel I abstain from using  Tents  and  Dilaters  as much as I can and as the Case will bear I occasion little or no Pain save at the first Dressing and then I always widen the Wound especially if it is a Gunshot One and do my best to draw out the  Extraneous Bodies  Now on this occasion I have three things further to recommend which are to dress  Gently Speedily  and  Seldom    There is a Way of Dressing Wounds made with Iron Instruments usual among the Soldiers call'd  the Secret Dressing  wherein they carefully suck the Orifice of the Wound in order to draw out the Blood therein contain'd then they take  Samaritan Balsam  or  Oyle  and  Wine  mix'd without Boiling and sometimes either of them alone which they squirt into the Wound from their Mouth and without any otheir Dressings cover and bind it up muttering some Words between their Teeth to make the Method appear mysterous which causes many People to think it magical  But these Words are ineffectual and their Vertue imaginary serving only to palliate and authorize the Ignorance of such People who know not what they do and to deceive the Imagination of the wounded These Cures tho' accounted miraculous have nothing in them supernatural and may be perform'd without invoking the Assistance of  Demons  'Tis known to every one that  Blood  when it is out of the Vessels coagulates and corrupts in the Wound if it make any Stay there and that by Sucking out the extravasated Blood Suppuration is prevented and also that is remov'd which might hinder the Reunion  CHAP IX That it is necessary to  Dress  Wounds Gently  GEntleness  is one of these things that are indispensibly requir'd in curing of Wounds This Circumstance is so necessary that without it other things have seldom the desir'd Success yea so much am I possess'd in Favour of this Opinion that when I see some that are rigorously handled I often admire how they ever come to be cur'd and indeed they never are  without a great many  Accidents  that fall out in the Progress of the Cure  'Tis ordinary for a wounded Person to be seized with a  Fever  which being symptomatick must be a consequence of the  Pain  The  Inflammation  that brings along with it such a numerous Train of troublesom Accidents is often occasion'd by an Irritation of the sensible Parts  Want of Sleep  ▪ proceeds ordinarily from nothing else but the  Pain  that is either over all the Body or in one Part only Now if by  Dressing gently  these three Accidents are avoided we may quickly hope to see a perfect Cure  Tents Dilaters  and  Setons  as hath been already sufficiently observ'd are the principal Cause of the  Pain  that the poor Wounded endure and the Occasion of so many hurtful Accidents their remaining in Wounds being infallibly attended with most destructive Consequences If then we lay them aside we may prevent the  Pain  and what follows upon it and so having the Command of whatever may give us trouble in Dressing we may manage the Cure as we please  Finally we ought to endeavour with all Care to remove so soon as possible what might cause  Pain  and by  Evacuations  and  Diversions  wisely to withdraw what wou'd foment it but if it hath already assaulted we must apply what is most proper to ease and overcome it for in  a Word Pain is a very  formidable Enemy  in the Progress of any Disease whatever  CHAP X That it is necessary to  Dress  Wounds  speedily  in order to prevent the Access of the  Air    IN this Chapter I endeavour to shew that the  Dressing  of Wounds ought to be perform'd  speedily  because Experience hath taught me that the  Air  is a mighty Hindrance of their Cure And this is one of the chief Reasons that oblig'd me to follow this Method For tho' some Pain in Dressing is inevitable yet by this means it lasts for so short a time that the Wounded scarce perceive it The  Air  has not time enough to exert its Influence upon the Flesh destitute of its Coverings and the nitrous Parts with which it is thought to abound can't pass to the Bottom of the Wound for I am of Opinion it is the nitrous clammy and as some think arsenical Qualities or Particles of the Air that destroy the due Temperament of the Parts when depriv'd of their natural Cover and that consumes or at least alters the  Natural Balsam  or Nutricious Juice which is as the  Cement  that unites the divided Parts  All the  Ancients  and the  Moderns  also are in this agreed that the  Air  is an Enemy to Wounds And Experience attests that even the most pure and subtil is ever attended with a certain sharp and clammy Acidity that sticks to Iron and Steel and makes them rust  'Tis the same  Air  that also occasions so many Disorders that alters and corrupts the  Bones  hurts the  Nerves  and destroys the  Tendons  corrodes the  Flesh  and utterly marrs the Temper of the Parts wasting the  Spirits  that preserve the  Radical Moisture  which with a little Help and often times almost without any unites broken  Bones  by a  Callus  fills up  Wounds  with  Flesh  cleanses  Vlcers  and brings them to a Scar  Hippocrates  Sect Aphor says that the  Cold  is offensive to ulcerated Parts that it hardens the Skin causes  Pain  and  Hardness  occasions  Lividity Shiverings Fevers  and  Convulsions    By the  Cold  here is to be understood the Air by means of which Disorders are excited in us it is corrosive and therefore exasperates the sensible Parts it hardens the Skin thereby hindering the Transpiration of the  Vapours  which being retain'd cause Pain Hardness and Fluxion and these produce Shiverings and Fevers and oftentimes are followed by Lividity Convulsion and a Gangreen  The Access of the  Cold Air  is indeed one of the Causes of the Pain which is so common in Wounds remaining too long uncovered because it coagulates the Humours and causes the Blood in the small Vessels to become more sharp and so to ferment and corrupt  A little Experience is sufficient to make one agree to these Reasons We ought to second the Designs of Nature that are ever aim'd at the preservation of what is most precious such as the  Spirits  Now we may be assured that when a Wound is left uncover'd or often opened there is occasioned a considerable Loss of these same Spirits whereby the Part is so weakened that being unable to make the right Use of the Nourishment sent for its Maintenance it is all chang'd unto Matter and Excrements  That  Cold  is hurtful to Wounds no Body doubts All are likewise agreed that the Air is at all times colder than the inward Parts of our Body Now if the Touching of the Air only rots the Bones if it act with such Force and Violence on Bodies so solid as they are it will undoubtedly be yet more destructive to the Nerves and nervous Parts that are so tender as also to the Tendons to the Flesh and to all Parts in general to which it has Access  The Air moreover produces many other Accidents in Wounds for as has been said the  Spirits are dissipated by the long and frequent Attacks of the Air whereby its acid Parts being at liberty and not intangled easily stick to the Flesh and other uncovered Parts which they corrode and tear with their Points hence proceed pricking Pains whose Cause often many are at a loss to conjecture  That same Acidity of the Air coagulates the Blood in the Mouths of the Arteries that open unto the Wound hinders its Course and makes it to swell up the Vessels and very often also to discharge it self on the Part Hence are Tumors Fluxions Hardness and if it Ferment large Abscesses For Fermentation here is only the changing of Blood unto Matter now the Blood having neither the same Situation nor Motion as formerly and its parts being disjoyn'd easily corrupts and Ferments in a little time unless we believe that the Air can't congeal the Blood in the Vessels which yet is beyond Controversie  That the Air is very piercing appears from  Chilblains  and  Kibes  in the Heels where it has the Force to congeal the Blood in the Veins and capillary Arteries of the Part afflicted If then it has such Influence on Parts cloathed with the common Teguments what will it have on such as want 'em In fine if it is able to coagulate the Blood in the Vessels where it may freely circulate much more may be fear'd from its Acidity in Wounds where the Course  of the Blood being in a manner interrupted the wounded Part receives but little Aid from the natural Heat and the Spirits and the Blood it self that precious Balsam of Nature being unmov'd and not receiving fresh and vigorous Supplies from the Heart is corrupted as was said formerly and turn'd unto Matter and indeed if we press the Places about the Wound we shall perceive a certain clammy Matter to come out as from so many little pipes which often also is corrupt and stinking  Now if  Nature  which is every way admirable and always industrious in preserving don't in such a Case exert her utmost Efficacy the Part must be mortified in spight of all the Efforts of the inconsiderat Surgeon and then if it is a Member that may be cut off the next thing is to deliberate whether this ought or may be done without danger Sometimes 'tis doubted whether the wounded Person can bear up under the Rigour of so painful an Operation considering his ill Temperament and Disposition of Body which only are accus'd as the Cause of all these Accidents for the Wound of it self was inconsiderable and might have been soon cur'd in a Person of a stronger and better Constitution or otherwise the blame is laid upon some venereal Venom Vice of the Parent Disorder c In fine the  Patient  and his  Temperament  are always found guilty and fall as Victims to Ignorance  I have been in many Places my self where such things have happen'd and where neither the Persons wounded nor the Surgeons understood the true Cause of the supervening  Accidents  It is however very requisite in this to employ all our Care cheifly in Hospitals of the Army where seldom are to be found all these Conveniencies that were to be wish'd for correcting the Cold and the ill Quality of the Air which frequently is infected and corrupted 'Tis in such Places where we ought to hinder it with all our Power to pass unto the inward Parts of our Body or to get access to those that are destitute of their Coverings lest at the same time it impart to them its destructive Impressions  It may possibly be objected to me that if that acid and nitrous Quality of the  Air  can produce such Disorders in Wounds we ought much more to be incommoded by the frequent and necessary Use thereof in Respiration But 'tis answer'd that the  Windpipe  and  Lungs  purify the Air which is in a manner filtrated and prepar'd by them and so becomes Friendly to Nature that only uses the purest Parts driving out by Expiration together with the hot Vapours or Exhalations of the Breast that which is useless and hurtful But it is not so in Wounds that have no  Spring  'Tis only the  Lungs  that are fitted and appointed for receiving the Air they alone perform the Office  of Bellows to prepare purify or to expell it according to the necessity of our  Machine    Besides it may be said that when the Air enters unto places that are covered and furnished with Membranes its Acid Parts slide upon them and take no hold but if there chance to be  Vlcers  in the  Lungs  the Air will then cause considerable Disorders and the  Cough  which afflicts such kind of Patients proceeds undoubtedly from nothing else but the  Irritation  occasion'd by the  Air  in parts depriv'd of their Covering  Moreover it must not be denied that the  Air  abounds with very subtil and piercing Parts because it will pass through the  SkarfeSkin  the  Skin  and other Teguments There are many Examples which shew that Persons have subsisted by means of the  Air  passing through the Pores of the  Skin  when Respiration was altother Supprest whether by  Suffocation  or other such like Accidents Some have also been taken down from the Gallows who were thought to have been a pretty while Dead and yet with a little help have recovered whence it is easy to infer that  Nature  had found the means to furnish the Heart and Lungs with a sufficient quantity of  Air  to refresh them during that Interval by the  Pores  seeing it could not pass by the way of the Windpipe A like Consequence may be drawn from those that ly in a  Lethargy    We may therefore reasonably infer that if the  Air  is so subtil as to pierce and pass through Membranes so close and compact it ought much more to penetrate considerably beyond the Extent and Cavity of a  Wound  where there is nothing to purify or subtilise it as there is when passing thro' the  Pores  of the  Skin  it supplies the Place of Respiration for since here the  SkarfSkin  keeps back the more gross earthy and clammy Parts of the  Air  we have Reason to think that it ought not to produce any ill Effects in the Places to which it comes It were to be wish'd that Wounds were cover'd with something at the times of Dressing which might perform the Office of the SkarfSkin and exclude the Acid and viscous Particles of the Air together with other noxious  Effluvia  with which it is fill'd For if these Exhalations floating in the Air are the Original of so many Diseases as some modern Philosophers affirm why mayn't they occasion very dangerous Symptoms when they take hold of and cleave to live and sensible Parts Now seeing these  Forreign Particles  are capable of alterations no less than the  Air  it self we may be assured that the ill Qualities which this has contracted in Hospitals by the Breath and Transpiration of the Sick are also communicated to those seeing such  Atoms  have a Substance and a certain Form  These  Carbuncles  that are so frequent in  Hospitals of the Army are a sufficient Proof of what I say They are occasion'd as some think by the  arsenical Particles  in the  Air  which being taken in by Respiration are thrown out by the strength of the natural Heat upon some  Emunctory  Now seeing this falls out much oftener in Hospitals than elsewhere we may infer that the Air also is here much more replenish'd with these subtil and impure Particles by reason of which the Wounds here treated without very great Care become sometimes  cancerous  always  putrid  and often  Fistulous  and  incurable    I have learn'd by my long frequenting of Hospitals that these Places where the Sick have remain'd for some Time retain long after they are gone the ill Smell communicated by them This I believe is owing to the impure Particles that stick to the Walls Whence these who design afterward to live in the Place are oblig'd to Plaister and whiten the Walls that they may not be hurt by the pernicious  Effluvia  proceeding from them  Cloathes and other Goods brought from Places where the  Plague  is must be cleans'd and purify'd from the  Pestilential Particles  that cleave to 'em without which Precaution they might excite a general  Pestilence  in the Places to which they are brought 'Tis this which inclines me to think that the nitrous and viscous Quality of the Air resides in those  Particles  or  Atomes  which if they are capable to stick to a Body so smooth and polish'd as a Wall and that for a long time without losing either their bad Smell or ill Qualities much more will they do so to a Wound uncovered which is always moist and where they may get easier hold and act more readily because of the Tenderness and weakness of the Parts  The dead Flesh of any Creature if it is often handled and exposed to the  Air  suddenly putrifies and a  Fatus  a Member c if it be kept in a close Vessel cover'd with Spirit of Wine may be preserv'd for ever whereas on the contrary a little  Air  will dissolve it and reduce it to nothing  That the  Air  is a  mighty Enemy  to Wounds is a Truth own'd by the modern Practisers of Surgery no less than by the Ancients but there are few take sufficient Care to hinder its Access to the Wounded Parts Knowledge is in vain when not put in Practise Nevertheless this is a thing so absolutely necessary in the Cure of any Wound whatsoever that without it nothing that a Surgeon's Art can perform is to any purpose but all is hurtful and destructive  From what has been said Consequences may be deduc'd very useful in Practice All the Regard I have for  Antiquity  was not prevalent enough to keep me from the declaiming against an Abuse tho' establish'd by Custom seeing  Truth  depends on the  Things  themselves and not on the  Opinion  the Ancients had of them I know many have already express'd themselves on this  Subject  much after the same manner as I have done  Celsus  who ought not to be reckon'd among the Moderns has written something that looks this Way In his Book  Of Wounds of the Skull  Chap he says that Flesh breeds easily enough in any part of the Head except a little above the Space between the  Eyebrows  where often there remains an incurable Ulcer because in that place there is a Cavity of the Bone full of Air bordering upon the  Os Cribrosum  which  Air  hinders the filling up of the Ulcer  By all this then it evidently appears that the  Air  is a powerful  Impediment  to the  Cure  of  Wounds  and that the  speedy Method  of Dressing ought to be preferr'd to that which is yet in use in many places And to conclude it is certain that the Pain caus'd by the use of a  Tent  its remaining in the Wound the length of the Time taken up in Dressing and the frequency thereof of which last I shall speak in the following Chapter are the genuin  Sources  of all the Accidents that follow on Wounds Wherefore we must  dress speedily  and according to our  Method  if we would prevent many dangerous Inconveniencies  CHAP XI That Wounds ought to be  drest seldom    GAlen  in his Fourth Book  Of the Composition of Medicines  Chap orders to dress  Vlcers  but once in three Days This Method he acknowledges to have come from  Asclepiades  and I can't but wonder that such a  Practice  has found so few Followers being so necessary and advantagious for the Patient  If Ulcers require not to be dress'd every Day as this Author thinks  fresh Wounds  do yet much less call for it Nevertheless it is the Custom in almost all  Hospitals  to dress regularly twice a day and I believe there is scarce one to be found that does otherwise excepting that of  Brianson  where they dress the wounded some only once a Day and others but once in two three or four Days If I had found this Method hurtful I would not have been so wicked as to continue to use it much less to desire that others also might do the same  Pareus  Book Chap treating of Ulcers seems to be much inclin'd to the Opinion of  Galen  when he disapproves often Dressing and yet in his Eleventh Book Chap speaking of Gunshot Wounds he orders to dress them twice a Day and often once in every eight Hours  It is surprizing that so famous an Author as  Pareus  who believed the Air extreamly prejudicial to Wounds adducing also many passages from the Ancients to support that Opinion should have left behind him  Rules  altogether repugnant to it But 'tis probable he was so busied in compiling so great a Work that he had not time enough to make the necessary Reflections upon this Subject which requires a very diligent Application and this may be the Reason why in many Places he contradicts himself  Fabricius ab Aquapendente  Pag Book Chap discoursing of the way to preserve the Substance of the Parts in simple Wounds affirms again and again that it is enough to take off the Dressings once in three or four Days which he confirms by the Authority of  Galen  where he treats of the  Cure of putrid Vlcers    'Tis certain that the seldomer a  Wound  is dress'd the less it matters providing it be not stuff'd with Lint or some such thing the  Remedy  also has the more time to communicate its Vertue to the Part which seems in some sort to be nourished thereby And the Nutricious Juice has more liberty and time to restore the lost Substance and reunite the divided Parts On the other hand if it is often drest the Strength of the Remedy being destroy'd and its Vertue diminish'd it becomes so weak that it has no Effect and its Moisture running away like the Sap of a Tree when 'tis pierc'd is mixed with and turn'd into Matter  What  Nature  does in uniting broken Bones may instruct us what we ought to do in curing of Wounds we see that a  Callus  is bred without the Assistance of any thing by the wise Contrivance of  Nature  only if so be that she is not by frequent Dressing or indiscreet motions of the Part diverted from her Work  When the little  Fibrous Threads  begin to be form'd in a Wound in order to unite the parts that are divided and the Nutricious Juice is communicated to the Part to restore it to its natural State if then the Part is often disturb'd with frequent dressing if the Wound is search'd with the  Fingers  or with a  Probe  or a dry  Tent  c what  Nature  has done will be bruis'd and separated and her Work destroy'd as soon as begun so that if this Method is continu'd the  nutricious Juice  becomes thick and hard and cleaves to the Sides of the Wound where it forms a  Callosity  and often a  Fistula    Generation  then which is the principal Work of  Nature  cannot be accomplish'd without Rest so true it is that Repose is necessary to her in all her Operations Hence it is that I cannot apprehend by what Reasons they are influenc'd who by frequent and painful dressing without any necessity exasperate the Wounds and I protest I could never my self indure so cruel a  Method  Sometimes they search them with their  Fingers  sometimes with an  Instrument  and not contented with this if they fancy they have found any thing desire their  Friends present and their Boys to do the same and in this miserable Condition is the wretched Patient detain'd sometimes an hour and that most frequently twice a Day I dare not adventure to name the Places in  France Italy  and  Germany  where I have seen the wounded us'd on this fashion and that by such as held very considerable Posts where a good Method was extreamly necessary  Finally after much time has been spent in taking into the Wound they think they are bound in Credit for the satisfaction of the Wounded and the Bystanders to draw out something and shew it publickly lest they seem to have labour'd in vain Now if it should chance that at length any little piece of a  corrupted Membrane  is found which would not be strange in a Wound drest in this manner where Corruption often causes great Disorder it is drawn out with abundance of  Ceremony  and the  Operater  fails not to declare with great confidence that this is it which occasion'd the  Restlessness  and  Pain  of the preceding Night And now you must think the wounded Person is half cured  Heavens What Abuse Is it possible that any Man can be so much impos'd upon I would gladly understand what it is that did separate this shred of a Membrane or these Fibers c It will be answered without doubt that it is  Nature  which endeavouring a Reunion rejects that which opposes it I demand again  how it was brought to this Place By the same  Nature  will one say And why then will not she go on to drive that extraneous thing quite out of the Body seeing she has done so much She is able to drive out Bullets tho' fastened in a Bone as I shall shew in the second Part to expell Splinters yea to bring them to the Orifice of the Wound and that a considerable time after it has been clos'd up why should we then apprehend that she will leave such things within from which she may so easily free her self either by the Orifice of the Wound or by some other more convenient way For it is certain that  Nature  left to her liberty takes ever the easiest way Besides all the Parts of the Body have an Elasticity or  Spring  whereby any Forreign Thing is naturally driven from the Center to the Circumference  Antony Benevent  a Physician of  Florence  relates that a certain Woman swallowed a very large  Needle  which two Years after came away by her  Navel  And  Tarentus  a Physician also reports that a Maid who had swallow'd a  Needle  nigh about four Inches in Length voided it ten Months after by the  Vrinary Passage    From hence it appears that the Industry and Sagacity of  Nature  surpasses that of all the  Esculapian Family  She knows what she does and wants not to be instructed in the ways she ought to take in order to drive out of the Body whatever oppresses or is forreign and noxious unto her The  Surgeon  ought only to employ  his utmost care to understand and follow her he must study her  Designs  and take all heed not to divert her from her  Enterprises  seeing she does nothing in vain  After what I have said concerning  Nature  I would not have any to think that I am one of those who regard her as a  Divinity  and ascribe unto her a  Reason  whereby she diposes all her wonderful Works  Reason  I look upon as a peculiar Priviledge of the  Human Soul  Neither am I of the Opinion of  Empedocles  that whatever she does is mysterious 'Tis him that  Aristotle  in his third Book of  Metaphysicks  ridicules for giving no other Reason for many things that were ask'd him but this that it was  Nature  's Pleasure All I will say is that if her Operations are marvellous they are owing to her powerful  Author  who has entrusted her with whatever we have that is most precious  But to return to my Subject it is fit I should advertise my Reader that I would not have any to follow my  Method of seldom dressing  unless first he hath intirely lay'd aside the Use of  Tents  and  Dilaters  which by retaining the  Matter  would cause a Fermentation whereby these same Tents and Dossels wou'd also be corrupted This is what fell out not long ago in a Cure to which I was call'd The Dilaters that had been us'd were carry'd along with the Matter that was discharg'd between the Muscles and  there putrifying the Corruption was quickly communicated to the neighbouring Parts Whence it appears that this  Method  hath in it Singularities and insparable Circumstances that must not be omitted  M Verdue  in his  Pathology  Tom fol advises not to do as some  Surgeons  who e'ry minite are opening the Wounds of those who are under their  Care  For says he by too often taking off the Dressings we hinder their reuniting and give occasion to the  Air  to insinuate it self into the Wound and to coagulate the nutricious Juice this indeed is a most just and reasonable Thought I remember when I was at  Rome  in the year I chanc'd to see a little Book written in Italian by the chief Surgeon of the Hospital of the  H Ghost  whose name I have forgotten He therein discours'd of Wounds of the  Head  only and prov'd by very good Reasons that they ought to be drest only once in three or four Days and sometimes not so often Moreover in dressing he did not altogether lay open the Wound but kept always upon it some thin Cover as is done at this day in many Places in dressing of Burnings  In Fine he took such great care to hinder the  Air  from passing into and offending the Wounds which he dress'd that we may be assur'd he Judg'd it a grand Impediment to their Cure Which was also his Opinion of frequent Dressing In the same Book he adduc'd many  Examples among which were several Accounts of very considerable Cures accomplish'd by this  Method    It were much to be desir'd that every One without regarding the publick Censure they might incur had the same Charity to reveal the  Knowledge  they have attain'd by their Care and Experience For it is very probable that by the  Vniversality of Mankind  almost an  Vniversality of Knowledge  is possest One has a  Genius  for one thing and t'other has a  Genius  for another and each their different Endowments and in Civil Life and particularly in an  Art  so necessary for the Preservation of Mankind every one ought to communicate without Reservation  After all there is no Rule without some Exception and I freely own that their are certain Cases wherein  Tents  ought sometimes to be us'd as in some Wounds of the Breast and in an  Empyema  when we would hinder the total Evacuation of the Blood or Matter to preserve the Strength of the Patient and finally on some other Occasions where they may be Judg'd absolutely necessary  There are other Wounds to which  Dilaters  are necessarily required as when the Bones being rotten or alter'd we wait for their Exfoliation or when they must be kept open in order to some further Operation to be perform'd upon them  There are also other Wounds to which of necessity we must occasion some  Pain  whither by drawing forth extraneous Bodies or by setting broken Bones or by dilating their Orifice  Others there are that will take up some time in dressing as in these of the  Head  where we often suspect there may be a  fracture  of the  Scull  Also when the Scull is broken when some Operation is to be perform'd upon the Bones in complicated Fractures and when extraneous Bodies are to be drawn out in such Cases we cannot dress so quickly as were to be wish'd  To conclude there are some that must be often look'd to when notwithstanding our Care the Suppuration is great as in Abscesses that are cavernous and deep in very hot Seasons and in Patients of an ill Disposition of Body who abound in excrementitious Moisture or when  Phlegmons Erysipela's  Lividity and Gangrenes or any other unexpected Accident follow upon a Wound For it is the part of a prudent and Skilful  Surgeon  to accommodate himself to emergent  Occasions  and to correct the  Symptoms  as they fall out  CHAP XII A Discourse upon  Discovered Bones  with the way to prevent  Exfoliation    IT is almost an Universal Custom at least I have seen it put in practice wherever I have been so soon as a Bone is uncovered to widen the Wound by  Tents  and  Dilaters  and wait for its  Exfoliation  This is so superstitiously observ'd in many of the King's Hospitals that it would be Judg'd a very hainous Offence to do otherwise yea or to neglect what hath been deliver'd by the Ancients As if we were eternally oblig'd blindly to follow their Dictates  Experience  has taught me on many Occasions that nothing more is required to prevent the Spoiling of a Bone when only uncover'd but to defend it from the Access of the  Air  For this Intent we ought to endeavour to close up the Wound with all possible speed by means of proper Bandage and balsamick Remedies without dilating it by Tents and Dossels Thus the Bone will soon be covered and the Exfoliation thereof is avoided which would infallibly follow if time had been given to the  Air  to exert its pernicious Efficacy upon it  Many Authors have injoyn'd Stiching in such a Case  Hippocrates  and several others after him have approv'd thereof in Wounds of the Head which notwithstanding may be united without it unless they are large and tranverse and of the lower Parts where stiching oftentimes becomes necessary by reason of the figure of the Scull  If any considerable Portion of the Bone is bared with loss of the covering Substance the Wound being large will take up a long time before it is clos'd up in this Case all our Care will not be able to hinder the Alteration and rotting of the Bone either by the  Air  admitted in the numerous Dressings or by the  Matter  running along or staying upon the Bone To prevent therefore this Inconvenience we must in the first Dressing pierce the Bone as nimbly as possible in many Places with the  Pyramid  or Pike of the  Trepan  By this means a way is opened to a  Marrowy Juice  which thickning upon it covers over the Bone in a little time without suffering it to lose any of its Substance  It is well known to Surgeons that any considerable Portion of the Scull laid bare by a Wound can never again be covered with Flesh without the Assistance of Art because of the Smoothness and Glibness of its Surface Upon this Consideration it was that many of the Ancients thought fit to rasp it that it might become  rough and unequal and also to make way for the Orifices of the little Vessels with which its inward Substance abounds to supply it with Blood necessary to breed a new Flesh wherewith it may be cover'd  But the  Operation  which I have made upon it on many Occasions and which I here propose appears to me to be more speedy safe and profitable than  Rasping  wherein the Instrument passing to and fro many times on the whole Surface of the discover'd Bone heats it and alters it much more than the  Pin  of the  Trepan  which only slightly touches it at certain Distancces and yet pierces so far as to approach the middle Pith from which we must fetch the requir'd Assistance Moreover the  Rasp  lessens much the thickness of the Bone whereby those that have undergone that Operation are subject to Pains in the Head add to this that it also leaves after it an unseemly Scar  This  Operation  may be us'd when the first yea or both Tables of the Scull are broken providing no inequality be left on the inward Surface thereof that may occasion Accidents which will appear in a small time For if we delay to procure a covering to the Bone the most subtil Part of the Matter may slide into the Fracture and there cause some Alteration or Inflammation for according to  Galen  and  Celsus  the Bone is lyable to this Inconvenience  and also yet more troublesome Accidents Now seeing the first Operation of this Nature which I perform'd was on the Scull I shall begin to Justify this Practice by shewing how it is nourisht  The Scull according to the Opinion of many has its Nourishment from three different Sources First by Vessels proceeding from those of the  Dura Mater  and passing into the  Cranium  through its internal Surface or that which is nearest the Brain Secondly from the  Diploe  or middle Pith a medullary Juice is imparted to both Tables whereby they are nourisht and sustain'd And thirdly by its external Part it receives Nourishment from the  Pericranium  wherewith it is every where cover'd and defended  When therefore by some external violence the Bone is depriv'd of that Membrane and remains uncover'd 'tis certain that the Air by its Acid and Nitrous Points takes hold on its outward Surface and in a little time alters and rots it and then it must needs exfoliate because it is bereft both of its Nourishment and Defence  It becomes necessary then to make an Amends and to draw Nourishment from the neighbouring Parts instead of that which is lost that at the same time by covering it anew may shelter it from external Injuries Now this we can have from no nearer Place  than the  Diploe  but in order to that we must give it an easie Passage and open to it a Way to fulfil at once the  Intention  of  Nature  and that of the  Surgeon  This is accomplish'd by piercing the Bone as we have said whereby the  Diploe  sends forth at these little Holes the most subtil Part of the  marrowy Juice  which congealing upon the Bone in three four or five Days sometimes sooner sometimes later intirely covers it  Other Bones that have Marrow are nourished from within by the Vessels of the Membrane which cover that Substance and from without by the  Penostrum  or Membrane wherewith they are invested For this Reason we may perform this  Operation  when there is occasion on the Bones of the  Shoulder Thigh  and  Leg  and these who doubt of this may be convinc'd by a Tryal  That which ought to recommend this  Method  and procure it an easie Reception is that thereby the Cure is accomplish'd in twelve or fifteen Days or so whereas otherwise it will take up near sixty for about forty Days are required to the Exfoliation of the Bone and twenty more to fill up and cicatrize the Ulcer Our Way is so exceedingly advantagious to the Wounded that it ought not to be rejected nor can it without offending against that  Charity  we owe our afflicted Neighbour who by the Delay in such Cases is extremely endanger'd  especially in an Hospital where the corrupt and infected  Air  ruins in time the strongest Constitutions I have often seen and it is but too ordinary that the Wounded Persons being cur'd and just ready to depart from the Hospital have been suddenly seiz'd by  Malignant Fevers Looseness Bloody Flux  c occasion'd by their tedious stay in such dismal Place  and  Death  often has been the first thing that deliver'd them from all their Miseries Therefore we ought to endeavour a speedy Cure and to spare no Pains to prevent that tedious  Exfoliation  But if the Wounded are sent to us with the Bone alter'd or if we can't avoid this Accident with all our Care we must endeavour to help on the Separation with all Speed for as a  Gangreen  in Fleshy Parts wants the Assistance of Art to put a stop to it so also does Rottenness which is a Gangreen of the Bone wherefore Exfoliation must be hastened by external Remedies that it may go no further for sometimes it extends from one End of the Bone to the other  It is the Surgeon's Province to pick out such Remedies as are proper for this Intention The Ancients and Moderns have left us good store of this kind but above all we must avoid the use of Acid Spirits which increase the Rottenness and have the same Effrct on a Bone as  Aqua fortis  on Iron The actual Cautery is a great Help on these Occasions  as also  Euphorbium  infus'd in Spirit of Wine  The Rules I have proposed to prevent Exfoliation are inconsistent with the Opinion of many Italian Surgeons who maintain that the Bone so far as hath been touch'd by the  Air  will infallibly exfoliate I have heretofore had great Debates on this Subject with some People who through a Stiffness of Opinion without any Ground would neither yield to  Reason  nor  Experience  not being able to bear what was contrary to their own Principles and Practice  CHAP XIII How to Dress with a  New Instrument  after Trepanning or Accidents of that Nature  WOunds of the  Head  accompany'd with a Fracture of the Skull are such as require an expert Surgeon I am convinc'd and I suppose none will deny it that the  Air  is hurtful to them in this both Ancients and Moderns are agreed  'Tis certain notwithstanding that a great Part of the Accidents that follow upon them proceeds only from the little Care that is taken  to hinder the Access of the Air into the Wounds whether the Scull be only bared or broken or also trepanned I have discours'd of discovered Bones in the foregoing Chapter I have only two or three Words more to speak of such Wounds where the Scull has lost some of its Substance  When the  Dura Mater  is uncovered I prepare a Plate of Lead very thin and very smooth pierc'd with Holes in several Places without any Inequality cut and fitted to the Bigness of the Opening and to make it more exact I sketch it out with the Crown of the Trepan that I have us'd or am to use in this Operation or its Measure may be taken from the Piece of the Scull cut out by the Trepan On each side of this Plate is left a little Ear somewhat longer than the thickness of the Scull these little Ears I bend both one way so as they may be perpendicular to the  Plate  and so much of them as exceeds the thickness of the Scull I bend outwards again that thereby they may rest upon the Scull and by which as by two little Handles I may lift them up with Pincers if need be at each Dressing these two little Handles may be cut something broader than the two pieces that joyn them to the Plate which must be of an equal Breadth When I use it I dip it in some proper Medicine pretty Warm and apply upon it a very soft Pledget of fine Lint  I have found very much Good by this Method and have observ'd a fivefold Advantage in the Use of this  Plate  First the  Matter  or  Blood  contain'd within the Scull passes out at the Holes of the Plate and is imbib'd by the soft Lint that I put over it and if it has acquir'd any mischievous Quality by staying there which often falls out the Lint by which it is soak'd up detains it from touching the  Dura Mater  and imparting the Contagion thereto and consequently there is less Hazard of its Alteration  In the Second Place this Plate by lightly pressing upon the  Dura Mater  facilitates the coming out of the  Matter  or  Blood  extravasated under the Scull  Thirdly It hinders the breeding of a  Fungus  and the bunching out of the  Dura Mater  beyond the Scull which otherwise often comes to pass obliging us either to cut off or to consume with  Cathecreticks  that which so stands out whereupon very grievous Accidents sometimes ensue  A Fourth Advantage is that it hinders by its slight Pressure the  Dura Mater  in its continual Motion to strike against the Inequalities and pointed Parts of the Scull that remain after a Piece has been rais'd by the Operation of the Trepan or intirely separated by some external Violence  And Finally it protects the Brain and its  Membranes from the Assaults of the Air performing in some sort the Part of that Piece of the Scull that was taken away  When we are assur'd that there is or are in Doubt that there may be some coagulated Blood under the Scull we may for some time omit the Use of the  Plate  that we may leave it a free Passage and afterward we may use it until the danger of the Accidents is over and then we must use it no longer otherwise it may prove an Hinderance to the Reunion and the Generation of the  Callus    When the Operation of the Trepan is perform'd on the  Basis  of the Scull as is usual now to be done without Scruple the bunching out of the  Dura Mater  is more to be fear'd and of consequence this  Plate  is absolutely necessary to support it and keep it in but for the Operation on this Place as well as for that on others we must endeavour as far as the Case will bear to choose the highest Part that the Plate may have the less weight to sustain We may safely use it for fourteen or fifteen Days if we Judge it needful and it may be made of Gold Silver c according to the Desire and Ability of the Patient but for my self I always use a leaden one for every Body knows that this Metal is freindly to Nature and is vulnerary and drying  Tho' there were no other Advantage to be reap'd from the Use of this  Plate  but only  that it defends the Brain and its Membranes from the Insults of the  Air  this were enough to recommend it to our Esteem It is certain that the Air acts not with that Force when its Acid Parts find a hindrance in their way or when they must pass through such little holes as these of this Instrument and sometimes I don't lift it up but in two or three Days when it Matters freely and the Accidents abate  M Verdue  affirms that the  Fungus  that breeds on the  Dura Mater  is caus'd by the Attacks of the Air in a word all the  Ancients  and  Moderns  are of one Mind in this that the  Air  is exceeding destructive to the Membranes and to the Brain  It is not then without Cause that  Nature  as a good and provident Mother hath taken Care to encompass the Brain with two  Membranes  the Scull the  Pericranium  the  Teguments  and the  Hairs  on every Side to cover it from the Impresions of the Air which of all the Elements is most hurtful to it and the most part of those that have been trepaned or by a Fracture of the Scull have lost some part of its Substance without having the Brain or its Membranes hurt are subject to a number of very troublesom Acccidents  The Reason of this may be easily conceiv'd for the  Air  at certain Seasons and in certain constitutions thereof being indow'd with more  piercing and subtil Parts or the Skin being more relax'd finds nothing sufficient to stop its Course and passes notwithstanding the  Callus  which is never so solid as a Bone to the Membranes which are extreamly sensible of Cold and there occasions these  Pains  that such kind of People are subject to  That the Discription of the Plate may be the Better understood we have here subjoyned its Figure  The Figure of a Plate with Nine Holes to be used when the Crown of the Trepan is large  A little Plate with Five Holes  The Figure of a Plate ready for Vse with the little Ears bent  THE HospitalSurgeon OR A New Gentle and Easie Way to Cure speedily all sorts of WOUNDS  PART II  Further evincing the  Excellency  of this  Way  by a faithful and particular  Account  of  Wounds  of  all Kinds  and in all  Parts  of the  Body  thereby brought to a quick and happy Cure together with Vseful and Practical  Reflexions    CHAP I The Reasons of Writing this Second Part with a general Proposal of what it contains  THO'  Sound Reason  supported by  Authority  may appear to be a Proof of the Goodness of any Thing convincing enough and capable to sustain the Weight of what Consequences  might thence be deduc'd yet does there oftentimes still remain an Uneasiness and Hesitation in the  Mind  no otherwise to be remov'd but by  Ocular Demonstration  as it were and  Experience  for nothing so infallibly shews the Possibility of Things as their having already come to pass nor can any Thing so well assure us what will follow upon them as a multitude of  Tryals  'Tis this Consideration that induc'd me in this second Part to give a History of some  Wounds  handled according to my  Method  that Justify my manner of  Practice    Had I thought it requisite I cou'd have fill'd a great Volume with Cures that I have done these ten or twelve years which were all brought to a happy Conclusion and compleated in a very small time But to avoid tediousness I resolv'd to set down as few as possible Yet in spite of my Design to relate only one of each sort and each Part I found my self necessitated to exhibit many of which tho' some at first may appear altogether alike yet if they be more narrowly scann'd they will be found to differ in some very material Circumstances  As for the Order observ'd in these Relations I have followed that of the Dignity of the  Parts  beginning at the  Head  and ending with the  Extremities  not minding the Series of time wherein they happened I have describ'd  all things Just as they were without either adding or diminishing having no other Design but to make the Easyness and Expedition of this Method appear by the Examples I here relate  CHAP II Of the  Head    OBSERVATION I  AFter the War broke out in  Savoy  there was brought to the King's Hospital at  Luserne  where I was then Surgeon Major in  July  a Soldier call'd  La Grandeur  of the Regiment of  Poudenx  which is now that of  Gatinois  He had received a Wound on the right Side of his  Head  with a pretty large  Bullet  which grazing upon the most convex part of the Bone of the  Sinciput  had only carried away the common Teguments not hurting the Scull but the  Membrane  that immediatly invests it was so bruis'd that it appear'd livid I know if time had been given it would have come to Suppuration whereupon the Alteration and Exfoliation of the Bone must needs have ensu'd to prevent which I tear'd off with my Nails the  Pericranium  so far as it was bruis'd being something more than the  bigness of a Silver Shilling and forthwith I struck the uncovered Bone in several Places as nimbly as I could with the Pyramid of the Trepan and then cover'd it with some Lint wet with Spirit of Wine the rest of the Dressing was charg'd with a simple Digestive upon which I put  Emplastrum de Botemea  and above all the Cap  After two Days I took off the  Dressings  and found the Bone covered with a lively Red from whence I conjectur'd that it would soon be cloath'd with Flesh two Days after this it was drest in like manner as before and then the Bone was half cover'd over for which Cause I let it alone for three Days more so that in seven Days time the Bone was altogether hid with new Flesh which was instead of a Membrane to it and now nothing more was requir'd but by dressing it every other Day to attend the Fall of the Escar Finally in the Space of eighteen Days the Wound was fill'd up and compleatly cur'd  REFLECTION  If this  Wound  had been manag'd after the ordinary  Method  I leave it to consideration whither the Cure would have been so speedily accomplish'd From that time forward I ever kept to this Method which I have us'd in many Occasions and never found that the  Wounds opened again yea or that Exfoliation or any other evil Accident ensu'd  This and the following Example I Judg'd sufficient to establish our Way of Dressing And indeed seeing it has been attended with Success in such Cases we ought to remain assur'd that it will prove no less effectual in incised Wounds and others also where the Bone is laid bare whither by that which inflicts them or by the Suppuration of the  Pericranium  But we must observe if the  Pericranium  is bruis'd or discolour'd as in the preceeding Case and Suppuration appear unavoidable that the securest way is to tear it off and speedily to uncover the Bone that the foresaid  Operation  may take Place whereby the Corruption of the Bone will be prevented which might be occasion'd by the lodging of the corrupt Matter thereupon and then the Operation would be too late  CHAP III Of the  Head    OBSERVATION II  A Certain Soldier nam'd  Chasteaumontague  of  Aligny  's Company in  Villars  his Regiment together with a Companion of his in  the same Company was during the Campaign in the Year brought to the Hospital establish'd for the  King  's Army at  Brianson    The first had receiv'd a Cut on the middle of the  Os Sincipitis  of the left Side whereby the Bone was uncovered to the bigness of a Silver Crown Piece At the second Dressing I made eight or ten little Holes with the Piercer upon the discovered Bone not reaching so deep as the middle Pith or  Diploe  that I might make Trial if I cou'd accomplish my Design without piercing through the first Table I apply'd upon the Bone so far as it was laid bare Lint dipt in Spirit of Wine dressing the rest of the Wourd with the simple Digestive  Emplastrum de Betonica  and the Kerchief  I waited two Days before I dress'd it again and then found that my Operation had not been without Effect The Bone was become reddish and the Holes made by the Piercer to which this Effect was owing began as it were to sprout forth which made me conclude that  Nature  would accomplish the Work she had already begun For the first eight Days he was dress'd but four times after which the Bone was wholly covered and in eight or ten Days more wherein he was dress'd but every third Day the Wound was fill'd up and a good and firm  Cicatrix  formed  He came into the Hospital on the th of  May  and upon the th of  June  he went out perfectly cur'd all that were therein being Witnesses of the Operation and the Speediness of the Cure  His Companion had several  Cuts  over all his  Head  which he had received in the same Occasion but especially a deep one upon the upper and middle part of the  ForeheadBone  Finding that in none of them the Scull was fractur'd I judg'd it sufficient to joyn together their Lips only in the last during the first Days I left two small Threads of Lint dipt in Spirit of Wine with the Ends hanging a little out of the Wound Four Days after I caus'd to be remov'd whatever might hinder the reuniting thereof dressing only once in three Days because no Accident appear'd  The Suppuration in this last  Wound  was but very inconsiderable and no Bones came away neither was there any Exfoliation So this Man also was cur'd and return'd unto the Regiment with his Companion  REFLECTION  Had I only recounted one  Cure  of this Nature done in a place at a great Distance from  Paris  the Truth thereof might readily enough have been call'd in Question But  these with many others of the like kind having been publickly perform'd in an  Hospital  to which every one had free Aceess and as it were in view of the  World  ought not only to remove all Scruple as to the Truth of the Matter of Fact but also to establish the Reputation of a  Method  attended with Expedition and Security The Excellency and Usefulness of the little  Operation  perform'd upon the uncovered Scull off the first Man may be easily made apparent to every one being founded on  Reason  and  Experience  M  Jouve  a very expert Physician belonging to this Hospital was an Eyewitness of the happy Success of these last  Cures  he having been present from the Beginning to the End  I should but weary my Reader and my self also if I should go about to reckon up the number of those who in three Years time with a surprizing Quicknss have in this Hospital been cur'd of Wounds of the Head as well such wherein the  Scull  was cut more or less as those wherein it had lost of its Substance  I am not the only Person who hath conquer'd Scruples commonly enough entertain'd about Wounds of the Head  Ambrosius Paraeus  reports that he cur'd in a small time a certain Person that with an edg'd Instrument had a large piece of the  Foreheadbone  intirely separated and hanging over upon the  Face by the Skin only which yet was easily enough reunited  In the  Scull  as in other  Bones  of the Body when a Piece is separated whether by a Cut or Fracture so as yet to adhere to the encompassing Membrane it is sufficient artfully to restore it to its natural Place in such a manner that it may have the same Situation and Disposition as formerly that so the Pores may answer and the  Nutricious Juice  necessary to form the reuniting  Callus  may be freely admitted which could not be done without extreme Difficulty if it were placed either to high too low or aside in which Cases the natural Order and Situation of the Part being alter'd it is impossible it can sit so close to the Bone from whence it was divided but that many little Distances must interveen that are liable to be fill'd with  Lympha  Blood or Matter or all three together which alter the wounded Part corrupt its Aliment and bring that Membrane to Suppuration by which only the divided Part was tyed So that Nature must now of Necessity throw it off as an  Extraneous Body    From hence we may readily conclude that it is not at all necessary to permit  Wounds  of this kind to come to  Suppuration  or to keep them open in Expectation of the coming away of Bones which without Danger may be avoided  This our  Method  is also confirm'd by the Authority of  Rhasis  and  Serapion  Authors celebrated by Antiquity who treating of  Wounds  of the  Head  accompany'd with a Fracture of the  Scull  tell us that it was their Custom to stitch them even when the Fracture pass'd through both Tables M  Verdue  also in his first Volume  Chap    Of Wounds in the Head  makes mention of a Fracture of one of the  Ossa Sincipitis  that reach'd from the  Sagittal  to the  Lambdoidal Suture  which was cur'd without the Assistance of Operation  The  Diploe  or middle  Pith  plentifully supplies the  Scull  with Nutricious Juice from whence it is that when broken it is more easily united than any of the other Bones tho' yet its  Callus  is less firm And providing the  Brain  with its Membranes are safe we need not fear any Danger from the Fractures of the surrounding  Bone  But tho' this may sometimes fall out yet is it scarce to be expected but that the violence that occasions a Fracture in the Scull should by the sudden Jolt or Concussion produce some Disorder in such a soft glandulous Body as is the Brain Great Carefulness therefore and Attention is here requir'd for a  Rupture  of the Vessels or a  Dilatation  of their Mouths that are frequent enough in such Cases and cause Effusion of Blood don't appear at first as I have oftentimes observ'd but so soon as the Accidents  begin to shew themselves Operation must not be neglected  It will possibly be objected to what I have said concerning carefully placing the broken piece of Bone in the same Situation it had formerly that the Bones of other Parts of the Body may be reunited by Means of a  Callus  even when so ill plac'd that there is a necessity of breaking them anew in order to restore them to their natural Figure But the Answer is easy for there is a Difference between the former Case wherein a Piece or Splinter of Bone is seperated from the whole and this where the Nutricious Juice that comes from the One as well as the other Part meets diffuses it self and coagulates about the Fracture and so forms that which we term a  Callus  but in the other Case the Alimentary Liquor proceeds and is communicated from one of the Parts only and if it find no Pores rightly dispos'd to receive it there being nothing to which it can Joyn it self it is alter'd and corrupted and the loosened Piece shares with it in the same Fate  As for the Operation of  Trepanning  ▪ which I have often perform'd seeing nothing extraordinary hath therein occur'd I will pass it over in Silence  CHAP IV Of the  Head    OBSERVATION III  ABout the Conclusion of the Year a little time before the War of  Savoy  the  Vaudois  cut off almost all the Inhabitants of  Pramol  which depends on the Valley of  St Martin  I was at that time Surgeon Major to the Hospital of the Army of his Royal Highness the  Duke of Savoy  Thither were brought a great number of Men Women Maids and Children in a most deplorable Condition and among others a  young Girl  about nine or ten years of Age who besides others in the Body and Arms had received eighteen or nineteen blows on the  Head  with a Cutlass each whereof had pierc'd the  Scull  some even to the  Dura Mater  some Pieces of the  first Table  were carried away and some of  both Tables  intirely seperated  I caus'd in the first place such Parts to be shav'd as wou'd bear it and afterwards I gently rub'd the whole Head with a Liniment made of  Vnguentum de Betonica  the Yelk of an Egg and Spirit of Wine mix'd together in this mixture also I dipt large Pledgets with  which I cover'd all the Head without either Tents or Dilaters above these I put  Emplastrum de Betonica  and over all the ordinary Cap  What her Age and Strength would allow was done for diverting the Humors and the first Dressings were left untouch'd for two Days which  Method  was continu'd for fifteen Days when we took off the Plaister almost at every Dressing we found Pieces of Bone sticking to the Pledgets What was altogether separated came away with Eease And in fine such Bones as yet adher'd to the  Pericranium  were reunited and what was wanting in the  Cranium  was speedily supply'd When I perceiv'd the Suppuration to diminish I dress'd but once in three days This Course I found so successful that in the space of about five weeks the  Cure  was perfectly accomplisht This poor wounded  Girl  was known to almost all  Pignerol  being very remarkable by the loss of one of her  Ears  which she had sustain'd in this afflicting Occasion  REFLECTION  This  Cure  is altogether to be ascrib'd to  Nature  as being intirely her Work and had not great Circumspection been used in prohibiting the access of the Air in this Case where the very Membranes of the Brain in  several Places were discover'd it could not have had so speedy easy and successful an Upshot especially had it been manag'd in the  ordinary Way  For besides that the Cure would have been unsufferably tedious a thousand dangerous Accidents might have arriv'd chiefly in an Hospital where longwinded Cures are seldom attended with success In fine notwithstanding the Novelty that may be charg'd upon this Method it is supported by the Authority of  Hippocrates  who  B    Aph  affirms that the  Air  is an Enemy to the  Brain  the  Bones  the  Nerves  and to our Nature in General  Galen  in his Book  De usu Partium  ch says that the  Air  is prejudicial to  Vlcers  by which word he understands all Sores and adds that in trepanning we ought to take special care not to cool the Brain as well during the Operation as when it is over  The Access of the  Air  is not only hurtful to the Wounds of the Scull and Brain but also to those of the other parts of the Body in which the Accidents are neither so sudden nor so violent yet ought they to be regarded with all necessary Care for if you ever so little neglect the Conservation of the  Natural Heat  and  Spirits  the wounded Member must needs fail and frequently the Owner also shares in the same Destiny  CHAP V Of the  Face    OBSERVATION IV  IN the year I being in the same Post and at the Place before mention'd when the  Vaudois  were driven from the Valleys of  Luserne  A certain  Officer  whose name civility obliges me to conceal was wounded with a broken Sword in the left Cheek towards the corner of the nether Jaw about an Inch below the Ear and the  Ductus Salivales  were torn  He was at first dress'd by a Surgeon who according to his usual manner dilated the Wound by thrusting into it as much lint as it could contain A considerable time pass'd without any appearance of a Cure and by little and little it became fistulous I was call'd by the wounded Person to give him my Advice and Assistance and forthwith I consum'd the Callosity by touching it nimbly with Tents dipt in dissolv'd Causticks I caus'd him to be fed with Jellybroth to be taken with a Quill that there might be no occasion to move the lower Jaw ordering him also to keep himself very quiet without either speaking or moving and when all the Callosity  was taken off I apply'd to the Wound the Balsam of  Peru  and pressing together the Lips with long slender Boisters I covered it with the Styptick Plaister of  Crollius  Thus he was cur'd not without difficulty tho' at first it might have been done with great Ease  CHAP VI Of the  Face    OBSERVATION V  BEing in  Pignerol  in the year the Chevalier  Vauban  a Captain in the Regiment of  Beaujolois  sent for me to see his Brother who was run with a Sword into the Cheek The Wound had been dress'd by a Surgeon who at first thrust into it a  Tent  both thick and long which pass'd into his Mouth and continuing the same Method for six or seven Days the Patient was thereby thrown into a violent Fever and his Head and Face were exceedingly swell'd by reason of the great Flux of Humors  After we had laid aside the Tent we found it necessary to have recourse to such Means as might divert the Humors but the Accidents which so great an Irritation of the Parts had occasion'd could not be easily remov'd nevertheless  they were at length conquer'd tho' not without difficulty and by means of  Sarcoticks  we compleated the Cure but an ugly Scar remain'd behind occasion'd by the inconsiderate use of the  Tent    REFLECTION  The  Face  being the Image of God and as it were an Abridgment of all the Beauties of  Nature  which as a little World representing in Miniature what is more voluminously display'd in the great bulk of the vastlyextended Universe ought doubtless to enjoy some privilege over the other parts of the Body Hence it is that all the Authors both Ancient and Modern tho' for the most part they have allowed the use of  Tents  in all other Wounds yet have they unanimously condemn'd it in those of this  Part  which nevertheless have been cur'd with wonderful Facility and by the use of the very weakest of  Sarcoticks    Fabritius ab Aquapendente  in Wounds of the  Face  recommends the use of the dry Stitch to avoid the deformity of a Scar and indeed seeing we are to preserve the Beauty of the Countenance as much as possible they are to be accounted very unskilful Surgeons and but ill instructed in what belongs to their Business who employ Tents in such occasions The  Saliva  seems to be that Balsam which is  peculiar to the Face assigned thereto by  Nature  that has also granted to all the other Parts one proper to them  CHAP VII Of the  Tongue    OBSERVATION VI  IN the Year A Lieutenant of the Militia of  Mondevis  having his Mouth open as he gave orders to his Soldiers in an Incounter receiv'd a Bullet that broke and tore all his  Tongue  into five or six pieces which were not altogether seperated but stuck together on the upper part He was carried to the Hospital of  Luserne  and forthwith there dress'd by  M de la Ramee  Master Surgeon at  Turin  and skill'd in his Employ But finding that with all his Care he was not able to stop the Flux of Blood which was considerable he desir'd my Advice in this affair  Having search'd his Mouth in order to discover from whence the Blood came I found the Bullet lodg'd under one of the corners of the lower Jawbone having only fretted the Skin of that part and finding no other Place from whence the Blood could come but these Veins under the Tongue call'd  Ranulares  I proposed  to heat red hot three of these small cauterising Irons which are us'd for the Teeth and to apply them to the  Ranulares  which being accordingly done the Bleeding was stopt and the wounded Person speedily cur'd  REFLECTION  The  Ancients  have ordered to stitch the Wounds of the  Tongue  unless the pieces be altogether separated in which Case the Operation is to no purpose and the Reunion impossible  Fabricius ab Aquapendente  is of the same Opinion but as for my self I can see no manner of necessity for such Stitching seeing  Nature  alone when left in Repose to her self does excellently accomplish the Uniting of the divided Parts without it Every body knows that the  Tongue  is situated in the  Mouth  under the arched  Palate  and made up of innumerable little nipplelike Bodies encompass'd on all sides by the  Teeth  and supported in such a manner that its parts are kept together and cannot fall asunder The Spittle is its  Balsam  and oftentimes the only Remedy necessary to cure its  Wounds  This is what I have observ'd in the preceeding  Cure  for this Gentleman's Tongue was after some small time altogether so well that scarce any Signs of the Division of its Substance could be discern'd but whereas it had  been torn by the  Bullet  and scorcht with the  Cautery  it must of necessity have lost of its Substance nevertheless  Nature  found the way to make up what was wanting and to effect a compleat Union of the divided Parts from whence I have Reason to conclude that what the Ancients have left us in Writing is not always true  I have dress'd a great many with Fractures of the lower Jawbone but chiefly two Soldiers who were wounded in that part at the Battle of  Marseils  One of whom had more than half of the Bone broken to pieces who nevertheless were perfectly cur'd as others had been they are at this time amongst the Invalids being disabled and much deform'd Of these I will not speak more particularly having observ'd nothing Extraordinary in their Case  CHAP VIII Of the  Neck    OBSERVATION VII  IT would be both tedious and unprofitable here to relate Examples of Wounds in the  Neck  of which I have cur'd a great number in very little time and with  Simple Remedies  only I have also several times taken out  Bullets  which have been lodg'd there for some time yea many Years I shall content my self therefore to give my Thoughts of what I judge necessary to the speedy Cure of Wounds of this part in the following Chapter  REFLECTION  All the  Ancients  agree in this that Wounds of the  Neck  tho' passing quite thorow are easily enough cured provided the great Vessels and Spinal Marrow be not hurt But they give no sufficient  Reason  for their  Opinion  I know not if I have hit the Matter aright but in my Opinion it proceeds from this that the use of  Tents  has been laid aside which in the Wounds of this Part cannot be employ'd because of the necessary Uses of the  Windpipe  and  Gullet  that would be hindred by so hard a Bandage as is requir'd to keep in a  Tent    It is therefore according to my Opinion  Nature  her self who being freed from Impediments speedily heals up the Wounds of the  Neck  and this greatly confirms the Reasonableness of my  Method  for those who fear lest the Omission of  Tents  should bring on Abscesses Bags and Sinuses have more Reason  to apprehend such Accidents in the Wounds of this than in these of any other part  'Tis well known that this part is obnoxious not only to the  Bronchocele  Afflux of cold Humors and Quinsie but also to  Phlegmons  St  Anthonies  Fire and all other Indispositions in general that afflict the whole Body for this Part by reason of the Glands that here are very numerous is always charg'd with abundance of Humors which render it subject to all such Disorders as proceed from these thrown out upon the parts  It must also be own'd that there is not any Part in all the Body which in proportion to its bigness contains any thing nigh so great a Number of  BloodVessels  as are here to be found  And in fine if it were true that the use of  Tents  would prevent Fluxions Collections of Matter Bags and Sinuses I know no other place of the Body that when wounded would be in more need of them than the  Neck  which is extreamly subject to such Accidents  Wherefore since Wounds of the  Neck  that of all the Parts is most liable to dangerous Symptoms may not only without  Tents  be cur'd but even much more safely and speedily than with 'em we may conclude that these of other Parts ought to be treated also with the same Gentleness and set at Liberty from the Tyranny of  Tents    CHAP IX Of the  Breast    OBSERVATION VIII  BEing at  Pignerol  in the Month of  April    M de Fontaniere  Commander of the King's Battalion received a Thrust with a Sword about two Inches above the right Nipple and in the Side thereof towards the Armpit which enter'd the Body between the third and fourth Rib  He was dress'd by one of the Surgeons in  Pignerol  before which he had lost according to conjecture about between seven and eight Pounds of Blood and notwithstanding of the Dressings the Flux of Blood did still continue for which Reason I was sent for by the Wounded Person and his Friends I search'd the Wound in presence of him that had formerly dress'd it and drew from it between eight and nine Ounces of Blood And lest at first I should appear ridiculous I permitted it to be dress'd with a  Tent  and immediately after caus'd him to be let Blood and advised his Friends to dispose him to set his Affairs in Order All the signs were dangerous his  Pulse  was  weak  and  convulsive  he had  frequent Swoonings  and  Pains  over all his Body A Clyster was given him and some weak Cordials  in good Broth A little after the Bleeding he was seiz'd with a  Fever  and all these Accidents concurring made us question whether he could outlive that night which yet he did in great pains over all the Breast and perpetual restlesness  In the morning which was the end of the first Day of his  Wound  we took off the Dressings and found that it had bled all night between six and seven Ounces of Blood half corrupted issuing from the Wound which was drest as the Day before The  Clyster  was repeated we gave him  Aperitives  and  Vulneraries  in Syrup of Violets And in his Broths a Diaphoretick made up of some grains of  Vitriol calcin'd  and the powder of a  Human Scull  which gave no small Relief being a  Specifick  in such sort of Wounds  After the Dressing the Blood yet run from the Wound into the Bed and as we were preparing to Bleed him again news were brought him that he behov'd to change his Lodgings and for his greater security to some Place at a considerable distance from that where he was In this occasion his Removal threatned no less than Death for this was but the beginning of the second Day of the  Wound  I was willing to see it before his Departure tho' it had been dress'd but a little time before but having perceiv'd at the last Dressing that some Blood run from one of these Arteries that  pass along the lower part of each Rib and having only out of complaisance continued the Tent I design'd to use one of another sort than had been yet done seeing there was now no time to loose  I prepar'd therefore a soft Tent indifferently thick and blunt at the end that it might rest upon the Rib without touching the  Pleura  or passing into the Cavity of the Breast This being dipt in a simple Digestive and roul'd in Vitriol finely pulveriz'd I apply'd with a broad head as is usual together with the rest of the Dressings and the Plaister of  Andreas a Cruce  After having taken some Broth he was put into a Chair and carried to his new Lodgings where he might remain more conveniently By the way he only lost a little Blood tho' many had been of Opinion he could never come alive to the end thereof  He rested a little that night and in the Morning which was the end of the second Day the  Fever  was still pretty violent the  Wound  was without Moisture or Blood the  Pleura  was reunited he felt a Heaviness and breath'd with some difficulty The Wound we drest now with a small Dilater only to which for more security a long thread was ty'd applying the other things as before I bled him in the Arm and encreasing the Dose of the Diureticks with the Syrup of Maidenhair  order'd an  Emulsion  to be taken at night with two Grains of  Laudanum    All these things succeeded so well that the next Day which was the end of the third since he was wounded I found the Fever diminished He breath'd more freely felt little or no heaviness and in the Night time had voided such abundance of  Vrine  that we may reasonably enough suppose this to have been a  critical Evacuation  he had also spit store of bloody Matter The Wound being now in a very good condition from this time forward I dress'd it with a Plaister only  At night I observ'd a Moisture upon him which made me believe that  Nature  might accomplish the rest of her work by  Sweat  Wherefore that I might not let slip so favorable an Occasion and to assist Nature I caus'd prepare for him a Potion with the distill'd Waters of  Carduus benedictus  and of  Scabious  four Grains of  Diaphoretick Antimony  half a Dram of the  Confection  of  Hyacinth  and of  Alkermes  a little of the  Powder  of  Vipers  and two or three drops of the  Spirit  of  Salarmoniac  This  Remedy  being given so seasonably procur'd a thorough  Sweat  and in the Morning which was the end of the fourth Day of the Wound the Fever was gone the weight upon the  Diaphragm  remov'd and he breath'd without difficulty and finally all these Symptoms being evanish'd the Wound was only  drest with a Sarcotick Plaister as if it had been a simple Excoriation  The Day after which was the fifth of his Wound he mounted his Horse without help and went to  Diblon  for a more pure and temperate Air where he no longer kept his Bed tho' he found not thereby the least Inconveniency There I purg'd him twice which was done not out of any absolute necessity thereof but as an expedient precaution I advis'd him also for a time to live somewhat moderatly Thus that  Wound  which appear'd to us at first  Mortal  and was attended with a numerous train of  dangerous Symptoms  was in five Days time compleatly cured to the Amazement of all  Pignerol    REFLECTION  This Method of Practice will appear at first to be ridiculous and rash to those who have not considered so much as I have done the surprising Works of  Nature  nor these secret Passages she finds out to discharge her self of what is troublesome to her in like Cases nor how in particular she oftentimes effects a  Crisis  by the way of  Vrine    But seeing experience has frequently taught us that an  Empyema  in the Breast has been carried off by means of  Diureticks  the Matter as the Ancients thought passing to the Urinary  Vessels through the  Vena azygos  but much more probably through  Ways  to us yet unknown why may not a little extravasated Blood contain'd in the cavity of the Breast or lying upon the Diaphragm be discharg'd by the same Ways or by those of  Sweat  especially if Nature be therein assisted by the use of Diaphoreticks  By these Ways then now mention'd the Breast may be sufficiently freed from Humors that Oppress it chiefly in a young and vigorous Body neither is there now Place for any to doubt of this of which so many People in our Days have been Eyewitnesses who can yet testifie the same  Wherefore there is no Reason to be so obstinately bent for using  Tents  in Wounds of the Breast unless it be to carry  Astringents  to some place whether otherwise they could not reach or to support and keep them on But in all other Cases they ought intirely to be laid aside For by exasperating such parts as they touch they are apt to renew the  Flux of Blood  they hinder the  closing  up of the  Wound  and by widening the  Division  of the  Pleura  occasion an  Inflammation  thereof  It also frequently falls out when a  Tent  is something long that it touches the Lungs and bruises 'em by reason of their continutl Moti+on and beating against its Point yea oftentimes it enters into and divides their Substance  making its way through the investing Membrane now brought to Suppuration In Wounds also where the  Lungs  are not spoil'd there being only a simple Division of their Substance with a sharp Instrument a Tent may increase the Separation and by iritating the Parts cause a discharge of Humors thereupon and great Suppurations which end ordinarly in incurable  Fistula's    Moreover a  Tent  presses upon the Muscules of Respiration and permits not the Patient either to cough spit or breath freely It hinders the Circulation of the Blood by bearing on the Vessels so that the wounded is in danger of Suffocation by the collection of  Blood Matter  or  Phlegm  and oftentimes of all three together unless they are by some Means discharged But if there is not a sufficient quantity of one or all of these to produce such an Effect and if the  Lungs  are yet at liberty to perform their wonted motions yet these Humors will there ferment and corrupt and occasion putrifaction in the parts that contain 'em  But after all this Accident may sometimes have an happy Event and a bad Cause may by chance produce a good Effect For our Body as we are inform'd by  Anatomy  being nothing else but a Contexture of Vessels it may happen in Wounds of the Breast that the Blood or Matter collected in the Substance of  the  Lungs  or upon the  Midriff  may there undergo a Fermentation and thereby together with the Heat and Moisture of the part open and dilate the Pores of the Veins whereby these Humors being taken into and mixed with the Blood rarify subtilise and dispose it to throw off the  Offending Matter  either by Sweat Urine or other  Crises  of alike Nature according to the Disposition of the Body  And surely we need make no great difficulty to believe that such a thing might happen in a Wound of the Breast if we will consider what befell  M de la Place  a Captain in the Regiment of  Barrois  who voided by Stool the  Matter  of a great  Abscess  in his  Arm  occasion'd by a Wound he had received in that Part of which we will give you a particular account in the last Chapter of this Book as also of another wounded in the last Campaign from whom the  Matter  that was contain'd within the Breast was drawn away by opening the  Vena Mediana  with a design only to let Blood  In fine we may say tho' the ways by which these  Crises  were effected are not altogether known to us yet it is very certain that there are such and seeing  Nature  is not ignorant of them we ought to leave to her conduct the Success of a Work whereof she ought to have all the Honour and which she alone brings  to pass our part being only to wait upon her and assist her in her Design  Galen  in his Book  de locis  hath observ'd that  Matter  contain'd in the  Breast  is oftentimes carried off by  Vrine  the same thing also he affirms in his th Book  de partium Morbis    Andreas a Cruce  a famous Physician of  Venice  in the first Section of his fourth Book of  Surgery  in express terms forbids the use of  Tents  and Pipes in the Wounds of the Breast he advises only to use a Plaister the Advantage of which I have thorowly experienced  Fabricius ab Aquapendente  Part I Book Chap says that he has often seen the Matter contain'd in the Breast in a Pleurisie or  Peripneumonia  discharg'd by  Vrine  He relates an Authentick History of a  Wound  piercing into the Cavity of the Breast which having been dress'd as a simple One of the common Teguments the Patient was on a sudden surpriz'd with such Symptoms as plainly discovered the Nature of the Wound That he might be relieved with as much ease as possible and not put to the torment of a Counteropening it was thought expedient to dilate the Wound but it was so well clos'd up that the Operation of the  Empyema  was resolv'd on next Day But during the Night sage  Nature  had accomplish'd the Work a Glass full of Blood being voided by the Urinary Passages whereby the Spitting of Blood  difficulty of Breathing and all the other Accidents were compleatly remov'd  The  same Author  recommends on such Occasions the use of strong Diureticks unless a Fever hinder and in the abovecited Chapter he says that there are some who will not allow Wounds of the Breast to be kept open but suffer them to close lest otherwise the  Natural Heat  might be dispers'd and the  cold Air  should enter in and spoil the neighbouring Parts He adds that the Use of  Tents  occasions  Fistula's    Ambrosius Pareus  Book Chap approves the Practice of those who make use of  Tents  in Wounds of the Breast and elsewhere commends such as employ them not so that as to this Point he seems to have been undetermin'd and inconsistent with himself  In the same Chapter also he speaks of a Cure done by himself without  Tents  and afterwards he affirms that  Fistula's  which follow upon Wounds of the  Breast  are oftentimes occasion'd only by the Use of them The same Author in the th Chapter of the th Book of his  Treatise of Matter and Blood that may be carried off by the Veins  demonstrates by many Reasons that such an Evacuation may be and shews that  Galen  was of the same Mind  Hollerius  in his Commentaries is of the same Opinion and  M Verdue  Tom chap  affirms that Wounds of the  Breast  the more they are exposed to the  Air  are so much the more dangerous  It would be a very tedious task to recount all the  Authors  that have approved of this  Method  altho' it is but little put in Practice And it would be a very easie Matter to bring many Examples of Cures wrought by  Nature  through secret and occult passages conveying Humors and Matter into other Parts than what were first affected  CHAP X Of the  Breast    OBSERVATION IX  ABout the end of the Year there was brought to the Hospital of the King at  Brainson  a Granadeer of the Regiment of  Touraine  together with a Servant of  M De Lesseraine  formerly Commissary at  Pignerol    The first was run into the sidepart of the Breast between the third and fourth Ribs with a Sword which past into the capacity of the  Thorax  and pierced the  Lungs  The usual Symptoms appear'd at first and  Diversions  were made The first and second Day some Blood came from the Wound which was only  drest with the Plaister of  Andreas a Cruce  without either Tent or Dilater Diureticks also and Diaphoreticks were us'd and upon the fourth Day he voided great abundance of  Vrine  by which  critical Evacuation  he was freed from the Fever Difficulty of Breathing weight upon the Midriff and spitting of Blood and on the fourteenth Day he was compleatly cur'd  The Other had received just such another Wound piercing in like manner only higher by one Rib The  Symptoms  were so violent that tho' it was immediately dress'd yet was there no hope of Cure He was treated after the same manner as the former But he was much more speedily cur'd by means of an universal Sweat whereby that very Day all the Accidents were remov'd In eight Days time he went out from the Hospital intirely cur'd  Were I to give a particular account of the numerous  Cures  of alike nature that have been done according to this  Method  there would be enough to fill a great Volume all which were neither attended with any evil Accidents during the time of the Cure nor followed by any after it nor did they ever leave  Fistula's  behind 'em I shall speak of  GunshotWounds  in the following Chapter  CHAP XI Of the  Breast    OBSERVATION X  IN the Year there was brought to the foresaid Hospital of  Brianson  a Prisoner of the Army of  Savoy  who was wounded with a Bullet that entred near the right Pap towards the Armpit and pass'd out of the Body four Finger's breadth from the sixth Vertebre of the Back having in its way broken asunder the fourth Rib  I enlarg'd both the Orifices but a little more that of the Back which was somewhat lower than the other We dress'd him only once a Day at first without either  Tents  or  Dilaters  and from the hinder Orifice came forth a certain thin watery Humor which Evacuation continued till the falling of the Escar after which time he was dress'd only once in two Days I kept the last mention'd Orifice open from time to time by means of a piece of prepared Spunge conjecturing that there were some Splinters of Bone to be discharg'd which accordingly came to pass without any pain about the eighteenth Day of the Wound from that time forth I endeavour'd  to heal it up applying between the Orifices Compresses dipt in warm Wine During this Cure I could observe no sensible  Crises  nor did any Accident happen It was finished in thirty Days  REFLECTION  In this Wound the  Lungs  were untouch'd for any thing that appear'd a Rib only being broken and the  Pleura  hurt which indeed had been sufficient to produce fatal Accidents had any other Method been followed for if in this Case  Tents  had been used or had the Wound been cram'd full of  Dossils  as has been often done on such occasions the  Matter  proceeding from the Dissolution of the Escar and the Contusion being pent up betwen the two Orifices and still encreasing and finding no Vent would infallibly have broken into the Cavity of the Breast from whence it could not have been drawn forth but by the Operation of the  Empyema    An Ancident like unto this happened this Year to a famous  Officer  of our Army in  Savoy  who having receiv'd a Wound which was thought to peneteate and really did so was dress'd with  Tents  but the  Matter  finding the Way by which it should have been discharg'd from the Body altogether intercepted and passing among the broken pieces of a fractur'd Rib diffus'd it self into the Capacity of the  Thorax  And in this Condition he dyed having his Breast full of Matter  CHAP XII Of the  Breast    OBSERVATION XI  UPon the twelfth Day of June The Marquess  De Larray  Lieutenant General took by Storm a Post in the Valley of  Barcelonetta  and in this Occasion had five and twenty or thirty Men wounded who were brought to our Hospital of  Brianson  and among others there was one call'd  Simon Contaut  of the Regiment of  Vendosme  and Company of  Berole  This Man had receiv'd a Bullet which went in hard by the sixth  Vertebra  of the Back breaking in its Passage the transverse Process on the right side and came out on the fore part of the  Thorax  between the second and third Rib towards the left side  This Wound was attended with all the most dangerous Symptoms that use to appear when the Lungs are wounded being one of the most considerable that had been under Cure in this Hospital  There was not here any need of dilating the Orifices the largeness of the size of the Bullet having done it to some purpose The Wounds were drest without any Tent but only with large Pledgets and a good agglutinative Plaister the Compresses and Bandage being such as is usual Diversions were made without delay and a course of Diet appointed He was dress'd but once a Day and that with all possible Speed  The hinder Orifice of the Wound did blow with such force that all the Bystanders were surpriz'd thereat and such a prodigious quantity of Water did issue from it that oftentimes it was necessary to change the Linnens twice a Day Diuretick and vulnerary Potions were given  This large Evacuation continued for about twelve or fourteen Days after which the wounded Person was dress'd but once in two Days The twentieth and first or twentieth and second Day the Opening of the  Pleura  on the Back was perfectly clos'd up that before having preceeded it some Days There was nothing came away that we could observe either from the broken Process or the Ribs that had been touch'd in the passage of the Bullet and in thirty five Days or thereabout the Orifices were both intirely fill'd up  REFLECTION  This wounded Man was sent to the Hospital as one of whom all hopes had been laid aside for the Surgeon Major of the Regiment who at first drest him with great Care told his  Captain  that his Death was inevitable  This same  Captain  about a Month after coming to  Brianzon  with the Lieutenant Collonel of his Regiment who had been wounded with a Sword was much surpriz'd when he was visited at his Lodgings by this Soldier who was at that time as vigorous as before he had receiv'd his Wounds at which he now had only a Plaister The Surgeon also testified to me his Amazement and enquired after what manner I had proceeded to accomplish that Cure in so small a time  This Cure is of it self sufficent to evince that in Wounds of the Breast there is no need of  Tents  and moreover does demonstrate that the Operation of the  Empyema  is attended with much better Success when performed on the hinder than on the lateral Parts of the  Thorax  For this Operation is done with design to give a Passage to the extravasated Blood and to evacuat the Matter contain'd in the Cavity of the Breast for which purposes this Place is much more convenient than the others the Humors being thereby  by discharg'd so soon as bred unless they be retain'd by  Tents  The wounded are not troubled with violent Agitations but enjoy a profound Quiet The Parts have liberty to perform the necessary Motions and  Nature  acts without constraint finding always the ways open by which she may deliver her self from what is contrary and hurtful unto her so that nothing is now to hinder her from closing up the Wound when ever she shall find her self disposed so to do  If then  GunshotWounds  of this Nature notwithstanding the Havock that the Bullet makes in the Places through which it passes are so easily and speedily cured by this Method we have all the Reason in the World to believe that the Wounds made by  sharp Instruments  where there is ordinarly only a simple Solution of Continuity may be cured with much greater facility  But we must observe that in this Way of Dressing great Care is to be had of covering such Wounds with good substantial Pledgets of such bigness that there may be no danger of their being push'd into the cavity of the Breast by the weight of the incumbent Air▪ And upon the Pledgets we must apply a strong and agglutinative Plaister such as that of  Andreas a Cruce  which also must be sustain'd with a Compress of four doubles and all kept on with the Napkin and Scapulary all which  Precaution is necessary to withstand the entry of the Air which otherwise the use of  Tents  being laid aside might pass into the  Thorax  and there produce fatal Accidents  M Verdue  Tom Chap advises not to use  Tents  in Wounds of the Breast for too long a time lest thereby incurable  Fistula's  be occasion'd  CHAP XIII Of the  Breast    OBSERVATION XII  WHen I was at  Liserne  there was brought to the Hospital in the Year a Soldier of the Regiment of  Saluce  who was wounded with a  which is a Weapon made in form of a Poniard on the side of the  Cartilago ensiformis  the Wound as was evidently to be seen when it was dilated passing upwards by the short Ribs and piercing the  Midriff  in its fleshly part  He was dress'd with a Pledget only covered with an Incarnative that was pretty liquid The necessary Diversions were perform'd and such a Diet was ordered as suited best with the greatness of the Wound and the Strength  and Constitution of the Patient He was dress'd only once in two Days The Suppuration was but very small and in the space of eight or nine Days he was compleatly cured  REFLECTION  If this Wound had been dress'd with  Tents  after the ordinary Manner I leave it to be Judg'd by every one if such a desirable Success could have been expected seeing the  Tent  would unquestionably have caus'd fearful Irritations of the  Diaphragma  which without it is with great difficulty brought to reunite because of its perpetual and necessary Motion In fine this Wound how inconsiderable soever it might appear had certainly prov'd Mortal if it had been stuff'd with an  Extraneous Body  which by encreasing the division of the Midriff would have prov'd an Impediment to its Action For every Body knows that Wounds in its nervous Part are deadly and that these in the fleshly Part may become so when exasperated by ill Treatment or neglected  CHAP XIV A Remark on One that was wounded in the  Breast    OBSERRVATION XIII  IN the last mention'd Year and in the same Hospital one of the wounded died on the fifth or sixth Day of his Wound And because it had not at all appear'd to be mortal the Bullet having but glanc'd upon him whereby the fifth Rib was only broken and the  Pleura  slightly hurt I opened him that I might discover the Cause of his Death At first I was of Opinion that an  Asthma  with which he was afflicted when alive and which had almost quite disabled him for Service had conduced much to the shortning of his Days But I was convinc'd of my mistake when I perceiv'd all the Parts in the Breast in a very good Condition only the Heart had its Ventricles fill'd with  Polypuses  of the thickness of a large writing Quill and about the length of the little Finger there being four in the  right  and two in the  left Ventricle    If we may give credit to  Dr Lower of Oxford  in his Treatise on the  Motion of the Heart  we may easily enough account for the Death  of this Man He says that in order to continue the  Circulation  of the Blood and to send a convenient quantity thereof through the Vessels the two  Ventricles  of the  Heart  must be of an equal  Capacity  and moreover that they must have alike  Strength  to undergo this Labour Now this Equality not being to be found in the Heart of him of whom we speak its motion must needs have been deprav'd by the Disproportion of the weight of the  Polypuses  and by the Inequality of the capacity of the  Ventricles  or because the Heart being overcharg'd could not contract it self without much difficulty so that remittting much of its Motion it became weak and languishing▪ and the  Midriff  also to which it is always ty'd did loose its necessary vigour especially after his receiving the Wound by Reason of which the Breast could not be dilated without trouble and Pain because of the broken Rib and of the Solution of continuity of the  Pleura  Intercostal Muscles and Muscles of Respiration Wherefore the  Heart  and  Lungs  being depriv'd of their necessary Relief Suffocation and Death were unavoidable  Tho' this is a Subject forreign to our present Design yet we Judg'd it would not be amiss here to take notice of it for Caution and Advice to others in a like Occasion  CHAP XV Of the  lower Belly  and  Loins    OBSERVATION XIV  IN the same Year a Soldier of the Regiment of  Montferrat  called  Sans Soucy  was wounded by a Bullet which entring before at the Region of the  Navel  came out behind at that of the  Reins  piercing the right  Vreter  as it pass'd along He was at first dress'd by one of the MasterSurgeons of  Turin  who us'd to assist us which he perform'd after his own Way  The Orifice which was in the Belly notwithstanding the  Tents  which he us'd was clos'd up after the falling off of the Escar of the Teguments but it fared otherwise with that in the Back for that Surgeon being careful to keep it open with a thick and long Tent hinder'd also the Reuniting of the  Vreter  which occasion'd the  Vrine  to come forth at the  Wound  I having seen him one Day advis'd the Surgeon speedily to take away the Tent if he would avoid an incurable  Fistula  but my Words were to no purpose for had he comply'd with 'em he would have thought he had offended against the Rules of  Art  and  ancient received  Maxims  with which my Advice was inconsistent  Some Days after seeing this Wound in a very bad Condition being covered with a whitish Flesh almost without Sense and ready to become a  Callus  I was willing to prevent the fatal Consequences of that indiscreet Dressing wherefore with a dissolv'd Caustick I consum'd all that appear'd callous about the lips of the Wound causing also some of it to pass into the Cavity thereof and leaving out the  Tent  I expected the Discharge of what the Caustick had mortify'd When the Flesh had regain'd its usual Colour without loss of time I syring'd into the Wound some Balsamick Water I also us'd the Balsam of  Peru  alone for some Days and after that the Styptick Plaister of  Crollius  with little longish Compresses that were plac'd on the two Sides of the Wound to press together the Brims Thus the Wound begun to be fill'd up and the Urine did by little and little resume it's former Course and in about or Days the Wounded Person was perfectly cur'd  REFLECTION  In the Progress of this Cure may evidently be perceived the difference between the Method us'd by many Surgeons fondly conceited  of their own Opinions and that which I practise for if in this Case the first had been continued but for eight Days time the Wound had become either extreamly difficult or impossible to be cur'd This is confirm'd by the Wound in the Belly the speedy Cure whereof is to be attributed to the Motion of the  Intestines  which contrary to the Design and Desire of the Surgeon expell'd the Tent so soon as apply'd in such sort that it was compleatly cur'd a little after the falling of the  Escar    Wherefore we can never too much blame those who are so obstinately wedded to the Use of Tents in Wounds of the lower Belly they ought altogether to be laid aside in spite of all the Objections that may be made on their behalf for which undoubtedly there is no Real Ground Experience gain'd by Practice has so undeceiv'd me touching the Use of Tents that I have left off the Use of them not only in the lower Belly but even in all other places of the Body unless upon a very pressing Necessity But in Wounds of the  Emulgent Vessels  of the  Reins  of the  Vreters  and of the  Bladder  as also in those of the  Joynts  they occasion Accidents which oftentimes prove mortal or otherwise leave behind them Infirmities that ever after render Life miserable  CHAP XVI Of the  Ventricle    OBSERVATION XV  ONe of the principal Deputies of the Hospital of  Brianzon  in the Spring of the Year receiv'd a Wound in the upper and middle part of the right  Hypochondrium  piercing in appearance to the  Ventricle  or to the  Pylorus  I could not find out the depth of the Wound with the Probe notwithstanding of all the Postures I could put the Patient in But an Accident that immediately fell out discovered the truth of the matter for tho' he had supp'd very slightly he vomited up again all he had taken mix'd with pure  Blood  I immediately dilated moderately the Wound that a free Passage might be left to the Blood that possibly was extravasated in the lower Belly or to the Matter that might afterwards breed there I dress'd him with a Pledget only upon which I apply'd a suitable Plaister and Bandage I bled him a little after and ordered a very exact Course of Diet the Blood was thin muddy and corrupted whereby I perceiv'd the ill Habit and sickly Disposition of  his Body He spent the Night in Restlesness because of Pains over all the lower Belly and a violent Fever which kept him from Sleep In the Morning I repeated the bleeding He had several Motions to vomit but could not and nothing at all came from the Wound which was dress'd as before  There being two Enemies to be grappled with I propos'd to continue the  Diversions  without Interruption which was also approved of by our Physicians We used Potions Juleps and Ptisanes such as were most proper for purifying the Mass of Blood and blunting the Points of the  Acids  to which I added some Vulneraries Suppositories were us'd to procure Stools but to no purpose which oblig'd us to give him from time to time half a pound of Decoction in a Clyster but with small success This Method we continu'd for seven Days without being able to observe any considerable change either as to the  Fever  or the  Pain  in which time he was let Blood six or seven times In fine towards the seventh or eighth Day of the Wound his Bellly was opened and at first he had a kind of a  bloody Flix  but afterward he voided  pure Blood  tho' in no great quantity I caus'd boil some vulnerary Plants with his Broth and made him take for some Days fasting a little spoonful of our  Samaritan Balsam  call'd that of the  Scripture  The Fever and Pains abated a  little which gave me some hopes of recovery The voiding of Blood by Stool continu'd till the fourteenth Day and then all the dangerous Symptoms disappear'd and the Wound was compleatly cur'd without having afforded any considerable store of Matter  REFLECTION  It was only the Situation of the Wound together with the Accidents which followed that made me conclude that either the  Ventricle  or the  Pylorus  was wounded Having therefore no certain sign to direct my Judgment in this Affair I try'd if the Sword that had given the Wound could make any discovery and found it was mark'd with Blood the length of ten inches or thereabouts There needed no more to assure me of the Nature of the Wound But that which altogether convinc'd me was the Blood voided by Stool the seventh Day of the Wound This having been collected in such a quantity as was sufficient to press and push forward the Excrements contain'd in the Guts at length made way for it self And if we had delay'd to bleed him or done it more seldom he would certainly have had a great and very dangerous Flux of  Blood  besides a number of other Accidents that infalliby had followed  It appears then that the true Knowledge  of Wounds which pierce into any Cavity o  the Body and hurt the inward Parts depends upon the  Accidents  and it is of high concern to a young Surgeon not to confide too much in his Probe or thereby to give his Opinion he ought also to make all requisite  Diversions  and to endeavour with all necessary Care to avoid and prevent  Accidents  which too often when arriv'd to a certain height become Proof against all our Indeavours  A great many wounded Persons have been sent to me dress'd at first as if their  Wounds  had been but slight which nevertheless I have found to be deep and very considerable It is sometimes not possible to put the Pati  nt in the same  Posture  he was in when he received the Wound So that it is an easie matter to be deceiv'd if we trust to such uncertain Tryals as those made with the  Probe  The Parts may have chang'd their Situation or they may be swell'd or clotted Blood gathered together in the Wound may oppose the Probe's Passage or when it can't trace the Way of the Instrument that made the Wound it may slide along between the Interstices of the  Muscles  Oftentimes the Wounded either know not in what Posture they were or are mistaken therein or they are not in a Condition to give an Account Finally it is much better to exceed in  Exactness    which can't prejudice the Patient than to take up with an  Vncertainty  which may cost the wounded his  Life  and the Surgeon his  Reputation    Moreover it appears by the Success of this  Cure  that the  Orifices  of penetrating Wounds afford but very small Assistance to the Cure of the inward wounded Parts For it is next to impossible to convey through them Remedies to those Parts that want 'em and for which they are design'd This I am bold to affirm contrary to the sentiments of the Ancients and of  Fabricius ab Aquapendente  and some Moderns It is also scarcely to be expected that the Blood which flows from these Parts should come forth by the  external Orifice  as we have observ'd Unless the lower Belly be quite fill'd up with Blood And in fine the keeping open of the Wounds is more pernicious than profitable serving only to inintroduce the  Air  into Places where it almost never fails to occasion Irritations disquieting Pains Coagulations Obstructions or Corruptions and oftentimes all these Evils together  Galen  affirms that Wounds in the Bottom of the Ventricle if not great are curable But  Celsus  is of Opinion that they are mortal Now how to reconcile such opposite Sentiments I know not However that they are not absolutely Mortal this Cure is a sufficient  Proof But it is nevertheless true that they are very dangerous and their Cure uncertain being atttended with many Accidents the least of which may prove fatal Such as  Vomiting  a Disorder peculiar to this Part or a Flux of Blood from the branches of the  Arteria caeliaca  the  Vena Gastrica  and  Gaffrepiploica  whether scarce any  Astringents  can reach and where they can't be kept on also  Convulsions  may be occasion'd by the wounding of the  Nerves  that proceed from the  Recurrents  Add to these that by Wounds of this part the Chyle may be evacuated so soon as made  CAAP XVII Of the  Perinaeum    OBSERVATION XVI  DUring the Campagne of the foremention'd Year a Soldier in the Regiment of the  Duke of Savoy  and Company of  St George  call'd  La Couleur  was sent to me having an  Abscess  which cover'd all the  Perinaeum  and part of the  Scrotum    After I had opened it on the left side at that Place where ordinarly the Operation for extracting the Stone is perform'd there came  forth a great deal of  corrupt Matter  with much  Vrine  whereby I understood that by the long stay of the Matter the Membranes of the  Bladder  were vitiated and corroded  I used neither  Tent  nor  Dilater  to the Sore but judg'd it sufficient to drop into it a Medicine for  cleansing  the Ulcer The Suppuration lasted for the space of fifteen Days which yet hindred me not from the very first to use little long and slender Bolsters for bringing together the divided Parts which I kept fast with a strong Bandage fitted to the Figure of the Part  After this perceiving the Matter came away in a moderate quantity and of a laudable consistence tho' mix'd with some Urine I used more powerful Incarnatives Balsamick Water and the  Balsam of Peru  and upon these  Crollius  's Plaister I straitned the Bandage obliging the Patient to keep his Thighs close together Thus by degrees the Urine resum'd its former Course and in five or six Weeks time the Cure was finish'd  REFLECTION  This Cure is inconsistent with the Opinion of  Galen  who Aphor says that divisions of the Blader cannot be united because it is a Part without Blood  I have had many under my Hands that were wounded in the Bladder which were all happily cur'd by the same Method And indeed if loss of Substance occasion'd by the corrupting Matter of an  Abscess  has been readily enough made up it is easie to believe that simple Divisions thereof by external Causes may with much more Ease and Expedition be united This is sufficiently demonstrated by the great number of those which have recovered after  Cutting  for the  Stone  And if sometimes  Fistula's  were left after this Operation they have been occasion'd by keeping  Tents  in the Wound without any necessity I know  M Verdue  imputes this to the sharpness of the Urine but that I can't be perswaded of having observ'd in many Places of my Travels that the country People have us'd nothing else but their  Vrine  to cure their Wounds  But if we reflect a little on the Effects produc'd by  Tents  which many People use in the Divisions of this Part we may soon be convinc'd that they are the Cause of this  Accident  by keeping open a way for the passage of the  Vrine  which tho' it cannot run in a full Stream so long as it is hindred by the  Tent  yet this being penetrated by the  Vrine  dulls the Sense of the place and turns the Flesh Callous  When a Wound abounds in Moisture be the  Humor  what it will it is of difficult Cure  this is sufficiently confirm'd by the  Fistula's  which happen in the  Breast  or  Joynts  tho the Urine have no hand in the Matter Moreover to convince us that the Humours wherewith Wounds and Ulcers are watered are an hindrance to their  Joining  and filling up we need only to consider these  Openings  in the Thighs and Legs of Hydropick Persons that are made by  Nature  or that we are necessitated to make by Art Every body knows that the Cure of these is extreamly difficult to be effected because of the Humidity wherewith they are continually soaked which is sufficient to support what we have advanc'd on this Subject and to perswade such as are of a contrary Opinion  Moreover the Breaking or Fretting of the  Lymphatick Vessels  which occasions the perpetual running of watery Humours in  Sores  hinders their Reunion in regard that this  Serosity  dilutes and carries away the  Nutricious Juice  and brings them to a  Fistula  Great  Suppurations  also have the same mischievous Effects but these being not so obstinate are more easily conquer'd than a Running of the  Lympha    Finally if we would effect a speedy Cure in Wounds of the  Bladder  we must carefully shun whatsoever may widen them or hinder their Reunion we must apply some powerful  Incarnative  such as the Balsam of  Peru  a  substantial Agglutinative  Plaister  as that of  Crollius  with small longish  Compresses  and a sufficient  Bandage  as hath been said but above all we must take Care that the Patient be altogether at Rest without any  Disturbance  These are the Means which I have found most effectual and most successful in bringing such kind of  Vlcers  to a perfect Cure  CHAP XVIII Of the  Fundament    OBSERVATION XVII  MOnsiue de Monrodon  Captain of a Battalion of the King's Regement commanded by  M Desbordes  having been four Years ago cured of an  Abscess  in the  Anus  there remained still some  Fistulous Sinuses  from which there was always discharg'd a great deal of Matter This Inconvenience oblig'd him in the Year to demand my Advice Having observ'd several  Callosities  about the  Anus  with  deep  and  winding Cavities  I propos'd to him to lay open the  Fistula  in order to consume these  Hardnesses  and cleanse the  Bottom  thereof without which there was no Hope of a perfect  Cure  But he calling to  Mind the Torments he had endur'd in the first Cure put it off for some time till falling into an Indispotion occasion'd by his ill habit of Body the  Fistula  open'd of it self about a Month after I had seen him with an extraordinary Running and great abundance of Matter accompanied with a quick and insupportable  Pain    I was at that time in a Place at some distance from our Hospital wherefore he caus'd himself to be dress'd by  a Mate  of the Regiment who having nothing but the  common Remedies  and understanding only the  ordinary Method  fill'd up that large  Cavity  with a great quantity of  Lint  arm'd with suppurative and putrifying Medicines which made a terrible  Corruption  and great  Havock  in the Part encreasing the  Suppuration  and the  Pain  He then sent me an Account of the deplorable Condition to which he was reduc'd praying me to come and see him When I came I advis'd him to cause himself to be remov'd unto a Place where I might take care of him my self which also was done that same Day The  Matter  that was retain'd and the continual  Exasperation  of the Parts had made a Hole big enough to admit ones  Fist  which pass'd with a winding course even to the  Os sacrum  there was also another  Sinus  that reach'd to the neck of the  Bladder  so that the sick Person could no ways go to Stool or enjoy one Minute of Repose  Having taken him under my Care I dress'd him only with the  Red Balsam  melted with an equal quantity of the  Samaritan Balsam  which I pour'd warm into the  Sinuses  and after having fill'd them therewith I cover'd the Orifice with a large Pledget dipt in the same over which I put a Plaister and upon this a Compress making all fast with a convenient Bandage I caus'd him use some absorbing Medicines to dull the Points of the  Acids  and  Ptisanes  to putrify the  Blood  and also some gentle  Purgatives  This Method succeeded so well that the Matter which was thin putrid and corrosive became laudable the Flesh which was loose and wasted by degrees recover'd its firmness the Patient went to Stool every Day without any Pain at Night also he enjoy'd the Repose which was so necessary for him and finally in one Month's time he was compleatly cur'd the Sores being brought to a firm and laudable  Scar  to the amazement not only of the Patient himself but of all those also who knew to what a deplorable Condition he was formerly reduc'd being without all Hope of being cur'd  REFLECTION  These kinds of Distempers are extreamly  roublesome that affect parts on which by Reason of their necessary  Vse  it is very difficult  to keep the  Dressings  such a Part is the  Anus  that is often afflicted with great Suppurations and dismal Putrefactions which delay and protract a Cure to a formidable length The Person we have been just now speaking of is a clear demonstration of this In the first Cure  six Months  time were spent he endur'd much Pain and Trouble and after all it was not brought to  Perfection  From whence I infer that it is evident that the  Gentleness  and  Easiness  of our Method was the genuine Cause of the perfect and speedy Cure that ensued For that  Organ  which serves for the Commonshore of the Body being left at Liberty and not straitned by an  Extraneous Body  the Excrements were neither press'd nor retain'd but were discharg'd with  Ease  and without  Pain  whereas on the contrary when Wounds in this Part are cram'd up with Lint it is impossible that Evacuations can be made by the  Anus  but the Excrements must press and squeeze the crouded Lint against the Sides of the Sore which must needs occasion insufferable  Pains  and oftentimes also a Flux of  Blood  And indeed  Monsieur de Monrodon  affirm'd to me that he never went to Stool all the time of his first Cure but he was still troubled with these two Symptoms  Finally we may see that when  Putrifying  and  Suppurating Medicines  are laid aside the Parts are by the means of unctuous Balsamicks  gradually restor'd to their former Temperature and that when the Points of the  Acids  are broken and the  Mass  of  Blood  purifyed by proper Remedies the  natural Balsam  of the Parts doth cleanse fill up with Flesh and cicatrize when ever the Occasion requires  CHAP XIX Of the upper Part of the  Shoulder    OBSERVATION XVIII  IN the Year as I travelled from  Turin  towards  Rome  and  Venice  there was brought to me the Son of an Inhabitant of a certain place called  La Rose  having an Abscess that covered all the  Acromion  and the upper part of the Shoulderbone of the right Side with a great Defluxion of Humour upon the Joynt I shewd his Father the urgent necessity there was of opening it and the Accidents that otherwise might ensue but the fond Love he had for his Son made him withstand the Proposal Some time after this it opened of its self and the thinnest part of the Matter made its way through several Holes into which so many  Tents  were put by a Surgeon of the Place who dress'd him at his Father's Desire This Method was followed for two  or three  Months  without any Prospect of a  Cure    At my Return he was committed to my  Care  in a very bad Condition he was altogether depriv'd of the  Motion  of his Arm several  Cavities  were form'd about the Joynt there was a perpetual  Flux  of  Matter  and the  Ligament  were relax'd which made me fear the falling out of the Head of the  Humerus  I was perswaded that the Distemper was past Cure considering the Weakness of the Patient and of the part affected and the ill Disposition of his Body which yet was but a Symptom of the Disease occasioned by the great  Irritations  and continual  Discharge  of  Humours  as I knew by the Sequel I made however a pretty large Opening in that which I judg'd the most depending part and straightway took away the  Tents  tho' at that time I was not altogether convinc'd of their pernicious Effects  From that time forth the Flux of Matter begun to diminish which made me endeavour with all possible speed thorowly to cleanse the bottom of the Ulcer and the  Sinuses  with a Lotion of  Birthwort Myrrh Sugarcandy  and  Vitriol  in  Whitewine  which had very good Success I did my best also to strengthen the Joynt Finally the Cavities were fill'd up by degrees the higher Orifices were first clos'd up and the others afterwards  He was cur'd in two Months time but his Arm was something more than other two before it recover'd its Strength  REFLECTION  This sudden good Success falling out so unexpectedly and at a time when I had casually tho' very seasonably laid aside the use of  Tents  began to open my Eyes and to make me entertain an ill Opinion of them For I could blame nothing on this occasion save the  Tents  which had been so long kept in the Sore for having caus'd all these Accidents by the Irritation and compression of the Parts And moreover by hindring the  Discharge  of the  Matter  from one dressing to another whereby it had time to gather and to ferment to encrease the Cavities and Waste of the Substance to moisten the Tendons slacken the Ligaments and to weaken and intirely ruin the  Part  Finally the most part of the Symptoms ceasing with the leaving out of the  Tents  does sufficiently evince that they proceeded from them and had the first  Method  been continu'd in for a Month or two a compleat dislocation of the Head of the Shoulderbone the corruption of the Ligaments and incurable  Fistula's  had certainly ensu'd and the Patient would have thereby been made lame during his Life  CHAP XX Of the  Shoulder    OBSERVATION XIX  IN the Year a Soldier of the Regiment of  Sourche  whose name I have forgotten was brought to the Hospital at  Brianzon  He was wounded with a Bullet which entered at the foremost and middle part of the  Acromion  and came out on the upper part of the Shoulderblade breaking the  Acromion  with a part of the  Scapula  as it went along  The Orifices were straitway dilated and drest only with Pledgets and the Digestive  Diversions  were speedily made and his  Diet  ordered In the first Dressings several pieces of Bone that cou'd not be reunited having been almost wholly separated came away several others that were yet ty'd by a small piece of the  Periosteum  tho' in appearance shaking and ready to fall off were yet joyned again  Finally all the adhering Splinters being again united the Wound began to fill up and in two Months time or thereabout was brought to a firm and laudable  Cicatrix  to the great Surprise of all who had been present  at the Dressings no Accident having happened all the time of the Cure  REFLECTION  It will certainly be thought strange that I permitted the Orifices to be clos'd up without expecting the Discharge of the Bones And it will possibly be said that I dress'd not according to Art  But to me it appears much more reasonable and advantageous to have preserv'd them than occasion'd their Loss seeing a Callus has never the becoming Convenience of a Natural Part And the Excellency of Art consists in curing speedily if possible and without Pain and in preserving the Figure Substance and Disposition of the wounded Parts 'Tis certain that  Health  being the End of the Surgeon's Art the principal Design is attain'd when the Cure is perform'd  If that Intention which ought to be the Scope of the Artist can by this Method be  Gently Easily  and  Speedily  accomplish'd there is no Controversie but that it ought to be preferr'd to all others that are contrary to it  CHAP XXI Of the  Arm    OBSERVATION XX  THE following Year a Granadeer of the Regiment of  Navarre  call'd  Belle Humeur  was brought to the same Hospital wounded with a Shot on the upper Part of the left Shoulderbone about an Inch or two Fingers breadth below the Joynt The Bullet entred on the fore Part and went out behind making a terrible havock Three or four Days pass'd wherein he was not dress'd but only slightly at first and without making any Diversion The whole Arm was distended like a Football the Orifices were choak'd up inflam'd and dispos'd to Gangrene  I made Incisions in the Orifices to give breath unto the Wound and Scarifications over all the Arm and having dress'd with a Digestive only without  Tents  or  Dilaters  I let a good quantity of Blood run from the Part by the Incisions to empty it somewhat and afterward fomented it with Spirit of Wine and a little Salarmoniack I apply'd over all the Arm  Diapalma  dissolv'd in Oyl of Roses and  Vinegar which in a little time abated the Inflammation of the Part and lessened the Swelling  Diversions  were not omitted but in spite of all could be done three Abscesses were form'd one at the bending of the Elbow inwardly another on the outward and middle part of the Arm and the third on the hinder and almost lowest part of the  Humerus  They were all three opened and by their plentiful Suppuration the whole afflicted Member was eased After three or four Splinters of the Bone that stuck by their upper part only to the  Periostium  were again Joyn'd I bent all my Endeavours to bring together and unite the Lips of the Wound And when the Escar was intirely fallen and the Symptoms vanish'd I us'd only a simple Incarnative dressing but once in two Days The Suppuration was but small and the Orifices begun apparently to fill up and in thirty Days were quite skin'd over So that from thenceforth I us'd the rolling Bandage and Plaisters in order to fortify the  Callus  And now his Diet is increas'd and he is able to rise from his Bed Finally he departed to return to his Regiment forty four Days after he had receiv'd the Wound  REFLECTION  The delaying of the  Diversions  as evidently appears was one of the chief Causes of the Accidents that followed upon this Wound and 'tis plain that if  Tents Dilaters  or other exasperating things had been us'd in dressing they had infallibly prov'd an Impediment to the  Discharging  of the Part and ripening of the  Abscesses  for Reasons adduc'd in the first Part when we discours'd of their fatal Effects  Nature  is in such Cases sufficiently perplex'd without the additional Oppression of the most grievous of all her Enemies She is as it were fetter'd and can't act And when by a healthful and critical Motion she endeavours to deliver her self as in the  Abscesses  of the former Cure she is unable to produce any desirable Effect so long as the Wound is cram'd full of  Lint  and the most frequent Consequence of this is a Stifling of the  Natural Heat  after which follows a  Gangrene    There have but few Accidents followed upon Wounds treated after our Method and I am bold to affirm that scarce any have miscarried under our Care tho' more dangerously wounded than this  Soldier  of whom we have been speaking all which is owing to the Gentleness of this  Way  and the Use of  Diversions    CHAP XXII Of another Wound in the  Arm    OBSERVATION XXI  IN the Year a little time after the War was declar'd in  Savoy  a Soldier of the Regiment of  Pondenx  nam'd  La Montague  was sent to the Hospital at  Brianson  who had got a violent Blow with the Handle of an Halberd on the middle and outward Part of the left  Humerus  whereby the  Bone  was broken to pieces with a  Wound  and gteat  Contusion    Several portions of the Bone stuck out at the Wound which did still adhere to the  Periosteum  I plac'd them one by another as gently and nimbly as possibly I could endeavouring to give them their natural Position I rub'd the Part with a powerfully dissolving Balsam very warm which I had caus'd to be prepar'd for Contusions I joyn'd the Lips of the Wound and apply'd an Incarnative I gently roll'd the part with a Band about three Fingers breadth above the Wound and with another as much below it applying a Plaister made of  Diapalma  dissolv'd in Oyl of Roses and Vinegar between the Bands the middle part whereof being opposite to the Wound  the Ends met upon it and covered it Upon this I put a Compress of the same figure and bigness folded into three or four doubles and dipt in warm Wine And then a piece of  Pastboard  which resting with its ends upon the two Roulers and embracing and keeping fast all the Woundapparel came together and was tied on the hinder part of the Arm  In this Pastboard there was a Hole cut out where it covered the Wound to which a piece of the same was fitted to be taken off at each dressing and afterward put on This was made fast with a little Band which I roll'd about all the Pastboard after I had apply'd my Dressings in such fashion that without disturbing either the Arm or the Pastboard I had nothing to do but when there was Occasion to unty the Band take off the piece and lift up the two ends of the Compress and of the Plaister and so to embrocate the Wound and then to dress it with a  Pledget  only and do it up again  In this manner it was dress'd once a Day for five or six Days after which I gently took off all the Dressings save the Rollers and changing the Plaister and Compress I drest but once in two Days No Accident happen'd for the Contusion was quickly dissolv'd no Bones were discharg'd and the Suppuration was but little  Diversions  having been made from the very first The Wound was fill'd up  and compleatly skin'd about the twenty second Day of the Wound wherefore I thenceforth dress'd it only with Rollers the Plaister  pro Fracturis  and the necessary Splents Since that time I have not seen him because then we parted from  Luserne  but 'tis certain he was past all Danger  REFLECTION  If this Way of Dressing be compar'd with that of many Surgeons who not only fill up the Sores with Lint but also at each Dressing move to and fro the broken Pieces of Bone in order to promote their Separation it may be seen how different the Success will prove Had I treated this Wound in a rigorous manner such Accidents had undoubtedly happen'd as would have baffled my Care The Suppuration would have been great and thus the Pieces of the Bone thereby quite separated and carried into some Cavity had caus'd many  Abscesses  and  Sinuses  which Disorders oftentimes cause a necessity of Amputation and when the Strength is decay'd they bring on Death After this I made use of a Piece of white Iron form'd in the same Fashion as the Pastboard with a Window opening upon the Wound which being lift up I dress'd it without moving the Body of the Machine But seeing in those Places where Hospitals are  we have not every thing requisite at hand the Surgeon must supply that Defect by his own Ingenuity  CHAP XXIII Of the  ForeArm  or  Cubit    OBSERVATION XXII  IN the same place a Soldier in the foresaid Regiment receiv'd a Shot in the  ForeArm  on the middle and hinder part which broke the  Radius  and carried away a Part of the  Cubitus    He was dress'd after our  Method  but the Cavity of the Wound was filled with a Pledget of very fine Lint dipt in a Mixture of our  Balsam  and a little  Linimentum Arcaei  which easeth Pain promotes the fall of the Escar and resists Fluxion of Humours Diversions were made and his Diet ordered  We dress'd him after two Days and found two or three pices of Bone sticking to the Lint In the second Dressing I set the  Radius  keeping it firm with little Compresses stiffned with Pastboard One of these I put on the forepart of the Arm upon the broken Bone another on the inward and a third on the outward part making them all fast with two Rollers one above and the other below  the Fracture this  Apparatus  kept the Arm streight and serv'd instead of a Defensive Over all we apply'd the Pastboard and supported the Arm with a Sling The Suppuration was very moderate and another piece of Bone came afterwards away We dress'd but once in two Days and on the twelfth or fifteenth of the Wound the Flesh begun to cover the Bone for which Cause we dress'd him only once in three Days and that very gently and speedily Towards the twentieth Day the Wound began to be fill'd up The defect of the  Cubitus  was made up with a  Callus  and the  Radius  recover'd without Exfoliation and all in four Weeks time after which I only us'd a Roller on the fractur'd place About this time we parted from  Luserne  and I have not seen him since  REFLECTION  The good Success the Expedition and the Gentleness of these  Cures  ought in my Opinion to give some Reputation to this way of Dressing I have not seen since first I entred upon Practice any Method followed that has been either so short so easie for the Patient or so certain in the Consequence Hereby these Pains are prevented which ordinarily bring  Fevers  that are attended with many other  Accidents Abscesses Fluxions    and  Inflammations  are avoided the  Matter  is but little and that laudable the Wounded can take solid  Nourishment  and necessary  Rest  whereby all the Faculties become more vigorous and  Nature  more active  Flesh  is more easily generated and a  Callus  more speedily formed and in fine every thing with more facility reestablish'd and reduc'd to its  former State    CHAP XXIV Of another Wound in the  ForeArm    OBSERVATION XXIII  ABout the End of the Year I being in the same Post in the Hospital of the Abby of  Oulx  wherein I was in that of  Bri  on  there was brought to us one call'd  Beau  belonging to the King's Battalion commanded by  M Desbordes  and of the Company of  M du Mont  He was run with a Sword into the middle and inward Part of the left  Arm  whereby the  Artery  between the  Radius  and  Cubitus  was opened  He had remain'd eight or nine Days in his Quarters being dress'd by one of the Mates who without making any  Diversion  only shut up the Wound with a strong Stopple which  restrain'd the great Flux of Blood between Dressings But at the time of Dressing he bled excessively The Blood which was extravasated in the Member did there corrupt and caus'd Abscesses in several Places But at last his Surgeon seeing that his Strength was daily diminished and fearing some fatal Accident caus'd him to be sent to  Oulx    His Weakness was advantageous to him for whereas  Amputation  was chiefly indicated his loss of Strength was a contrary Indication that prevail'd over the former I dilated the Wound that I might discover the Artery and empty the Part of that Matter and clotted Blood wherewith it was fill'd But being then unfurnish'd with such things as were necessary for my Design I apply'd a Button of  Vitriol  to the Opening of the Artery and having fill'd the Wound with Lint and apply'd the other Dressings necessary on such Occasions I let him Blood twice but in small quantities and gave him certain Emulsions wherein were mix'd some Anodyne Medicines to retard the Motion of the  Blood  I let two Days pass without Dressing but on the third I found all I had done was to no purpose At the Place where the  Artery  was opened there was a considerable and painful  Swelling  the  Lint  that fill'd the Wound was heav'd up with the Pulsation and a Bloody Water came out which presag'd the sudden return of the  Bleeding I caus'd prepare my Troches of  Rosewater GumDragant  and  Vitriol  with some good  Styptick Water  and two Days after I took out all that which fill'd the Wound I also took away the Escar made by the  Vitriol  and the Fungus that was grown in the Wound which I further dilated to give vent to the Blood that had diffus'd it self through the Flesh beyond the extent of the Wound All this time I repress'd the Bleeding by the  Turnkey  which I caus'd to be slackned to discover again the Opening of the Artery to which I apply'd two little Troches supported by a small Compress dipt in the  Styptick Water  I fill'd the Cavity of the Wound with Dossels pretty hard and moisten'd in the same Liquor then I took a large Compress of three Fingers breadth thick and a Foot in length cover'd only with Bole dissolv'd in Vinegar this I apply'd along the  Artery  even to the  Armpit  and lastly an astringent Plaister which I made fast with Compresses and strong Bandage I caus'd the Arm to be laid on a  Pillow  with the Hand higher than the Elbow Two Days after I unty'd the Rollers and took off the Compresses and the Plaister and seeing things in a good Condition I apply'd new  Astringents  without touching the Wound This Method I continu'd two or three Days afterward I begun to remove the Dossels that were outmost sustaining always the others  with new ones hindering also those which were next to the Artery to fall off untill the Suppuration were begun that time might be given to the  Flesh  to cover the  Artery  the Bleeding being very well stop'd In effect about ten or eleven Days after the Application of these Dressings all came off of its own Accord not one drop of Blood following for the  Artery  was pretty well cover'd All this was done in presence of  M Davejan  one of the Physitians of the Hospital a Man of Integrity Merit and great Skill Finally the  Wound  was in a little time compleatly cured  REFLECTION  These kinds of Wounds where  Arteries  are opened are of all others the most ticklish they give a great deal of  Trouble  and but little  Reputation  is gain'd by their Cure Every one knows that there was no place for the Operation of the  Aneurisma  where this Artery was opened and that it was necessary either to cut off the Member or to let the wounded Person perish or to stop the Bleeding by such means as I us'd By this we may see that it is not good to be too hasty in cutting off a Member where Arteries are opened that admit not the  Aneurisma  that we ought not to dispond tho' our first Attempts to stop the Flux of Blood prove unsuccessful and that  the  Troches  which I use are upon many accounts better than  Vitriol  This is not the only time that I have experienc'd the Success of this Method in a like Occasion I made some Tryals of the same at  Luserne  in the Year and in particular upon a certain Soldier who had the  Artery  that is between the  Tibia  and  Fibula  opened After much trouble before I would condescend to the cutting off of the Member I was willing to try this Method which had also a very happy Success That we may preserve a  Member  we are to leave nothing undone neither ought we to consent to its  Amputation  untill first all other Means have been in vain assay'd  CHAP XXV Of the  Hands    OBSERVATION XXIV  SInce the beginning of the War I have had under Cure very many whose  Hands  were pierc'd torn or half carried away by such FireArms as burst asunder which is a thing very ordinary in Armies Many others also have I dress'd that had their  Hands  shot through with Bullets and cut with sharp Instruments of which I shall not speak in particular  But I may say that all those I have dress'd in these latter times tho' by the Wounds the part has been very much shatter'd and torn have been always cur'd without losing what remain'd of the Member and with little or no discharge of Splinters of the Bones or loss of Fingers or their Joynts  In this kind of Wounds as well as in others I have avoided  frequent Dressing  and the Use of  putrefying  Medicines and I own that I have ever found the  Spirit  of  Wine  a very successful Remedy in Wounds of the  Extremities  and in those of  Nervous  Parts I have us'd  it chiefly in Hospitals where it brought always a speedy Relief  Many of the Ancients have ordered to keep open for some considerable time the Wounds of the  Nerves  and  Tendons  to give vent to such Matter as by its Stay might corrupt the Substance of the Parts  But Experience has taught me that 'tis much more benificial to the wounded in such Cases to hinder than to promote the Suppuration by doing betimes what is necessary to prevent Fluxions upon the Part sometimes applying good Defensives to the superior Parts to repress the activity of the Blood and some times using resolving Anodines to the Place afflicted if there is need to prevent or take off the  Pain  from which most comonly the Accidents proceed that attend such  Wounds and to stave off at the same time the Attempts of the  Air  which is the greatest Enemy of the nervous Parts  I can aver that by using this Method I have cur'd such Wounds much more suddenly than I could any other Way I believe also seeing all are agreed that the  Air  is pernicious to Wounds in general that none will question but these of the  Nerves  receive thereby a more notable prejudice than those of any other Parts of the Body considering their Tenderness the Nature of their Substance and their Temperament I leave it then to Consideration whether Wounds of this kind could be defended from the Injuries of the Air if they were kept open according to the Opinion of the  Ancients    But it will be said that 'tis extremely difficult after all possible Precaution to avoid the use of  putrifying  and  irritating  Medicines and of Dilaters in Cures that are tedious For if such things as breed Flesh and are balsamick be us'd when the Wound at the same time must be keept open there will be a necessity of consuming incessantly the Flesh with Cathereticks which are very apt by the Pain they cause to produce Accidents especially in parts so sensible as these  Now to this I say that if Suppurating and Putrifying Medicines are us'd there almost ever infallibly follows a great Suppuration and  sometimes a total Dissolution of the nervous and tendinous Parts Especially if  Tents  or  Dilaters  be also imploy'd which if but for a small time they touch such Parts do oftentimes draw on Incurable and sometimes Mortal Symptoms  Wherefore I have ever judg'd it best to  close  up the Wound so soon as possible on such Occasions chiefly when there is no extraneous Body which of necessity must be drawn forth or if all requisite Diligence has been already at first Dressing us'd to that intent In fine tho' I have ever not only avoided with all possible Care the using of putrifying Things but also have indeavoured to dress as  Seldom  as might be I dare affirm that in this way of practice there never happened even the least Accident to all that great number of wounded Persons drest according to it in our Hospital at  Brianson    Pareus  Book Ch shews that by this Method he successfully cur'd the Pricking of a  Tendon  which King  Charles  the ninth had received in Bloodletting Tho' in another Place he exceedingly finds fault with those who use the  Stitch  to wounded Tendons He would undoubtedly have been of another Mind had he liv'd and seen as I and many others have done how often the deceas'd  M Bienaise  an expert Surgeon has perform'd the same with Success in his House at  Paris  But after  all we may maintain that he is not the first who has practis'd the  Stitching  of a  Tendon  For in former times it was ordinary and many of the  Ancients  have done it  CHAP XXVI Of the  Thigh    OBSERVATION XXV  IN the Year when the  Vaudois  were driven from the Vallies of  Luserne  one  Le Grand  a Frenchman by Birth Sergeant in the Regiment of Guards and at present an Officer in a Regiment of Fusileers belonging to  His Royal Highness  being wounded by a Bullet in the upper and outward part of the right Thigh and the Ball not to be found was brought to the Hospital at  Luserne    He had lain a Day and a Night helpless upon the Ground which occasion'd a considerable  Fluxion  and an  Inflammation  of the Part I made large Incisions and spar'd no Pains to find the Bullet but all in vain  He was forthwith let Blood and had a Clyster given him an exact Course of Diet being ordered The Bleedings were repeated with the other Remedies for withdrawing the Humors from the Part The Swelling  and Inflammation were lessened and I began to think that things were in a pretty good Condition I kept in the Wound only a little  Tent  about the length of two Fingers Breadth very soft and of pretty fine Lint  Thus the first Accidents were vanquish'd but others more troublesome and more obstinate yet remain'd▪ for the Suppuration and Flux of Humours was so prodigiously great that I verily believ'd his whole Body would thereby have been dissolv'd At every time we opened the Wound to dress it which was twice a Day more than a  Pint  of  Matter  came away besides what was discharg'd between Dressings which might be judg'd as much In the mean time the Strength of the Wounded Person was more and more impaired and his Body insensibly wasted away  I could ascribe all these Accidents to nothing else but the Bullet which remain'd in the Member and this I the rather inclin'd to think in regard that almost all the Bullets that were drawn from Wounds during this Campagne were full of  Sublimat  or  Glass  and many others of other  Metals  and  Tin    I advised with  M Conte  then at  Luserne  Surgeon in Ordinary to his Royal Highness who being acquainted with the Order of Cure and the Symptoms was of Opinion that by Purging the Moisture might be dry'd up this was accordingly put in practice  I was so eagerly desirous to effect this Cure as if all my Reputation had depended upon the Success and indeed it appear'd as if  Providence  had thereby design'd to open my  Eyes  and to make use of me for the Relief of many others being qualified for that end by the Experience I therein attain'd  The Wounded Part was greatly disordered by the  Purging  yea in such sort that I fear'd a  Gangreen  the  Fever  was encreas'd and the Patient had quitted all his Hopes notwithstanding the Assurance he had conceived of being cur'd under my Hands  As for my self I began to despair although it is my Humour never to give over my Wounded Patient so long as Life continues For his Thigh was all over  livid  and the spaces between the Muscles yea all the Member was fill'd and soak'd with Matter which every Day increas'd the Wound being as it were an inexhaustible Fountain I considered with my self a thousand times if there was any thing more I could do or any thing further to be us'd I had perform'd all that Art prescribes to dry up that Matter wherewith the Part was ever fill'd having us'd not only hard Bandge with expulsive Compresses to hinder its gathering together and abode in the part but also sudorifick Decoctions tho' all in vain I was also thinking to make a CounterOpening under the Thigh to give a more free  course to the Matter and to hinder its Stay but on second thoughts I believ'd it would be to no purpose  M Conte  and generally all who saw the Man despair'd of his being cured and told me that I vex'd my self in vain as if all my Reputation had depended upon the Cure  Although I had hitherto assay'd all sorts of Means in Vain yet I was obstinatly bent to find out some other Way by my own Consideration seeing the wounded Person himself was also desperate  As I have formerly said I had hitherto kept in the Wound a little  Tent  about two Finger's breadth long and very soft This I resolv'd altogether to lay aside and to dress the Wound with a  Pledget  and  Plaister  only and such a Bandage as might be sufficient to keep 'em on  This affrighted the poor dying Man and it was with great difficulty that now I could obtain his Consent to have that power over him which of right belong'd to me and what formerly he had so freely granted  In the Evening to my great Surprise I found him in a much better Condition The Matter came not away in so great a quantity That night he slept much better than ever yet he had done since he receiv'd his Wound and in the Morning I found him yet better This Evening the Matter began to be of a  good Consistence and to be discharg'd in moderate quantity Henceforth I dress'd but once a Day  His  Fever  which had continu'd from the beginning left him altogether the second Day after the leaving out of the  Tent  and from the fourth he was drest only once every other Day he also began to eat and to recocover his Strength from the eighth Day nothing further came from the Wound and on the twelfth after the disuse of the Tent he was intirely cur'd to the Truth of which I call  God  to witness  REFLECTION  This is the  Cure  as I sincerely protest to which I have been most oblig'd It was this which made me embrace that  Method  which now I expose to publick View and which from this time forth succeeded so happily with me and it is certain that I had infallibly cur'd my Patient at once of all his distempers if I had continued but only for seven or eight Days to use a  Tent  tho' never so small and soft  From this time forward I resolved to abandon the use of  Tents  and to give my Advice in this Affair to the Publick when once an opportinuty should present it self I communicated my Design to  M Thouvenot  Physician  in ordinary and Chief Surgeon to their  Royal Highnesses  a Man of great Learning and Experience to be esteem'd as well for his profound Knowledge as his eminent Vertue And having related to him a discription of the Cure he confirm'd me in my Opinion  It was here therefore in the King's Hospital settled at  Brianson  that I drew out several  Observations  which I had made and some Accounts I had kept of many Cures done in different Times and Places in order to make up a  Collection  of them together with some others done in this Hospital  But to return to the preceding Cure it is convenient to observe that tho' the Bullet was lodg'd in the Member yet no Disadvantage did thereupon ensue to the Patient which made me think for a time that the Bullet hitting upon the Belly of some large Muscle might have rebounded the same way by which it enter'd But I found my self out in my Calculation for being at  Turin  about a Year and half after this Cure I was sent for from the  Cittadel  where I stay'd and when I came I found this same Person whom I had cur'd of his Wound who shew'd me a a little  Abscess  that was form'd upon the old Scar I opened it without Difficulty and perceiving something white and hard with my Instrument I drew out the  Bullet  which was flat with a piece of the Thighbone sticking  to it The Ulcer was quickly cur'd without any Inconvenience and never more return'd  Had I at first Dressing found out the Bullet to the Misfortune of the Wounded Person I should have been oblig'd by Custom and the Rules of our Art to draw it forth tho' it had been as indeed it was sticking in such a part of the Bone as was encompass'd with greatest Depth of Flesh But for certain it could not have been got out with such Ease or without Pain and griveous Irritations Besides I question if the Patient who was of a bilious Constitution could have born up under so tedious and painful an  Operation  seeing an infinite number of Accidents had been occasion'd only by the touches of a little and very soft  Tent  Wherefore I am perswaded and am bold to affirm that it is not always necessary to draw forth the  Bullet  when it is lodg'd in a Bone that lyes deep under the Flesh  Nature  that is much wiser than we has more gentle and easy ways and best knows the time to free her self of what is hurtful to her  Hippocrates  in the fifth of his  Epidemicks  relates that he drew forth the  Head  of an Arrow from the  Groin  of a Man after it remain'd  six Years  in his Body without any Accident happening during all that Time  Alexander Benedictus  reports that a certain Man was wounded in the  Back  with an Arrow the  Head  whereof could not be got out being bearded and two Finger's breadth in length which yet two Months after the Wound was cured the Patient voided by  Stool    Hildanus  in his th  Observation  tells us that he took out the point of a Knife which had remain'd two years among the acute Processes of the  Verterbrae  of the Loins without producing any Accident there  Let us now therefore acknowledge that  Nature  is wonderful in her Operations These Examples together with my own Experience and Reason have made me very cautious in drawing forth of  Bullets  when they are not lodg'd in Places where they may marr or quite destroy the Action of any Part nor in danger of falling into some  Cavity    This  Cure  is of it self enough to convince any one of the Advantage and to establish the Credit of my Practice it having been publickly perform'd yea authoriz'd and approv'd by many learn'd Physicians and skillful Surgeons of the Court of  Savoy    Since that time I have in several Places and in diverse Hospitals cured many who have had their Thighs pierced quite through without either  Tents  or  Dilaters  save only in the first Dressing for supporting and containing the  Astringents  necessary to stop the Bleeding  This is contrary to  Pareus  his Method who in the thirty seventh Chapter of his tenth Book of  Wounds  affirms that Wounds of the Thighs and Legs ought to be kept long open that the corrupted Membranes may have time to suppurate and come away as if indeed  Nature  that has brought solid Bodies such as  Iron Bullets Bones  c to the Orifice of Wounds even after they have been a considerable time cicatriz'd as hath been formerly observ'd were not of sufficient Power and Sagacity to expell some Shreds of corrupted Membranes  But to avoid corrupting of the Part the Wounds must be  speedily  clos'd up  Tents  and  Dilaters  laid aside the  Air  must be carefully excluded from the wounded Parts great  Suppuratives  must be cashier'd and we must dress as  quickly  and as  seldom  as possible  CHAP XXVII Of the  Knees    OBSERVATION XXVI  IN the Year when I was at  Pignerol  a Captain of a Battalion of the King's Regiment commanded by  M de Launay  was wounded in the right  Knee  with a Bullet  which went in at the outward and middle and came out at the inward and upper part thereof He was drest for four whole Months by a Surgeon of the Army very well skill'd in his Imployment but who followed the common Method He had also advis'd with the Surgeon Major of  Pignerol  who had given over hopes of the Cure The Surgeon that had him under Cure not thinking to make any long stay in this City propos'd to me after so long a time to undertake the Care of dressing him which I also did  I found five or six  Holes  in his Knee all of them fill'd with Tents that were hard and long enough to reach to the Bottom His Leg and Foot were swell'd his Body very thin and he had a slight Fever which had never left him from the first time he receiv'd his Wound with perpetual Watchings and a Loathing of all kind of Food  I began to leave out all the  Tents  and with a small Incision at the lowest Part  hereof I dilated the Wound I laid aside the Aromatick Wine that had been so long us'd  o no purpose and left off the use of a certain  njection which being apply'd twice a Day  y the Intolerable Pains it occasion'd had  angled all the Joynt and caus'd a communi  ation amongst all the Holes which were ex  ctly stopt with the Fingers every time that  Medicine was employ'd that it might make some Stay in the Part  I dress'd him indeed with the Remedies that had been formerly us'd but I took Care to apply them more conveniently and to accommodate 'em better to the Nature of the Part and of the Wound  When I came to see him the Day following so soon as he saw me he embrac'd me and swore in the presence of many Officers that he was inexpressibly oblig'd to me And which was no less surprising than true he told me that he had slept all Night tho' he had not done so since the first Day of his Wound that he felt no more Pain in his Knee and believed his Fever was gone  He was so encourag'd with this good Success that from that time forth he thought himself cured For five or six Days he was dress'd after the same manner once a Day and after that once every other Day neither did I change the Oyntments and Plaisters which had been so long us'd before without any Advantage The Cure was compleated in less than a Month After which I advis'd him to go into his own Country there to use the  Waters  in order to strengthen the Part that was weakened by the frequent Dressing and if possible to enable him freely to extend it  REFLECTION  It appears by this Cure that a  good Method  is the most effectual Remedy and the principal Instrument in healing Wounds If any Man will but be at the Pains to ponder this Case I doubt not but he will be convinc'd that the  Tents  the  Injection  and the other humid things wherewith the Part was perpetually moistened were the Cause of the deplorable Condition of the Wound Now if such a thing as it often falls out had happen'd to a common Soldier under necessity of being sent to an Hospital and treated in the common Way he must have endur'd twenty Deaths by the tedious and painful Dressings yea it is certain that he could never have held up under them being at the same time depriv'd of all necessary Conveniences breathing in an unhealthful and corrupted Air and having Food neither so nourishing nor given him at such seasonable times as a Captain might who was willing to spare nothing that might conduce to the Preservation of his Life  The Account I have given of this  Cure  has nothing in it which is not exactly conformable to the Truth The Gentleman who was wounded himself made the same Relation to  M Goiffons  a very learn'd and experienc'd Physician of  Lyon  and Chief Physician of the King's Armies in  Italy    'Tis true the Wounds of the Joynts require very great Care there being few that are obnoxious to more troublesom Accidents and when the Part is much shatter'd they are judg'd mortal However I am very certain that great Abuse is committed in the manner of Dressing them and this I judg'd my self oblig'd not to conceal  The  Joynts  moreover are nervous or tendinous Parts and are known to be of a cold and moist Temperament wherefore they must be guarded from the Attacks of the  Air  they must not be exasperated by the Touches of  Tents  and  Dilaters putrifying Medicines  must be suppress'd because they weaken the Parts to which they are apply'd and ruin these that are nervous and tendinous  All these liquid things which are commonly us'd are also hurtful to the Joynts such as Aromatick Wine Fomentations and Injections c Such things as are heating and drying are profitable We must endeavour to hinder the Waste of the Spirits and seasonably to perform the necessary Diversions observing a drying and slender Diet and using to the Wound Sarcotick Medicines such as Balsams or Spirit off Wine avoiding also long and frequent Dressings If this Method is followed all these Accidents which ordinarily  accompany Wounds of this Nature will be prevented  Fabricius ab Aquapend  nte  in his first Part  Book  I  Chap  treating of Wounds in the Joynts says That they are not only extreamly hard to be cur'd but also dangerous and mortal and he adds that the Cure is dangerous and difficult both in regard of their own Essence and also of that of the Joynts for  Nature  being the Cause that produces Flesh and fills up Wounds is less vigorous in the Joynts which are cold in Temper and destitute of Blood and Flesh than elsewhere especially when weakened yet further by a Wound  Afterwards in the same Chapter being supported by the Authority of  Galen  in his third Book  Of Fractures  he affirms That whatever lies under the Skin is advantag'd by being cover'd therewith and considering that the Joynts are cold without Blood and without Flesh he says that their natural Heat is soon extinguished especially when expos'd to the Cold of the  Air  These were the Thoughts of this Author who was accustomed to use the  Stitch  on such Occasions to protect this kind of Wounds from the Injuries of the  Air    He further adds in the same Chapter that Wounds in the Joynts ought not to be left open or expos'd to the cold Air because thereby we run the hazard of quenching the Natural  Heat and of a  Gangrene  or if this should not fall out yet is there seldom seen any Digestion in the Wound when so treated  These Parts then as hath been said are naturally very weak destitute of Heat and plentifully watered with Moisture which by reason of the abounding Salts is apt to contract an Acrimony and Malignity especially when it is retain'd in the Part with  Tents  Now this same Moisture insinuating it self into the Pores of the nervous Fibers fails not to harden them and render them callous from whence it comes that these Wounds often end in  Fistula's  'Tis observable also that if there happen any Change or Disorder in the Blood this Humour becomes so corrosive that it rots the Bones and destroys the Parts where it comes Long and frequent Dressing moreover occasion the like Accidents because of the Admission of the  Air  that increases the force of the Acids and easily destroys that small Portion of Spirits and Heat with which these Parts are furnish'd  All these things are of the greatest Importance and well deserve our serious Consideration and if  Reason  in any thing ought to prevail over  Custom  'tis chiefly here where the Life of Mankind is concern'd which is a thing so precious that it very well Merits our most particular Care  After all I am of the Mind that the Authority of so famous a Person as  Fabricius ab Aquapendente  ought to give some Reputation to my Opinion But before I conclude this Chapter I will moreover affirm that if Wounds in the Joynts are hard to be cur'd and often degenerate into  Fistula's  this is not so much owing to the weakness of these Parts as to to the Manner us'd by most part of Surgeons in dressing them  CHAP XXVIII Of the  Leg    OBSERVATION XXVII  ONe  La Grandeur  who was of the Guards of the  Marshall de Catinat  General of the King's Forces in  Italy  being at the Siege of  Luxemburg  in the Year had received a Wound with the  Shiver  of a  Granade  in the left Leg which left behind it an Ulcer near the inward Ankle that had baffled the Care of the Surgeons  This Man being at  Pignerol  about the beginning of the Year took a Resolution to have his Ulcer cur'd tho' it had been of a pretty long standing and was to him instead of an Issue Here he finds a Surgeon pliant  enough who without foreseeing what Accidents might follow or considering the Evil Disposition of Body and the bad Constitution of the Patient takes bim in Hand dresses him and heals up this Ulcer  But in a little time after he had ample Occasion to repent the rashness of his undertaking For the impure Humors of that unwholsom Body which had taken their Course that Way not finding any Outgate were by degrees gathered together in the Member and by their Stay arriv'd at a pitch of Malignity sufficient to cause a  Gangrene    On the middle and inward Part of the Leg there arose a  Tumor  or swelling which was forthwith taken by his Surgeon who had very little understanding in such Cases for a  Phlegmon  whereupon without further Deliberation he begins with Bleeding which he repeated five or six Times  The Humour retain'd in the Part not being able to come to a perfect Concoction because of the defect of Heat and Spirits made its malignity appear and corrupted a great Part of the Leg The Gangrene appeared And the Surgeon made an opening in the highest part of the  Tumor  from whence came forth a little foetial  Lympha  But the Disease increasing every Moment both the Patient and the Surgeon were allarm'd and sought out for  some Body to advise with about cutting off the Member  I was order'd by the  Marquess of Chamlay  who was then at  Pignerol  to go see him and to employ my utmost Care to retrieve him if possible from that miserable Condition I made incisions in his Leg from the Knee to the Ancle on the inside and touch'd it with a very piercing Spirit so far as the Gangrene reach'd I ordered for the Patient the strongest Cordials not forgetting  Oriental Bezoar  and  generous Wine  which I caus'd to be given him from time to time  Three Days pass'd over in spite of all I could do before a Stop was put to the progress of the  Gangrene  The unseasonable Bleedings his Diet his Fever and the other Evils with which he was opprest had so impair'd his Strength that nothing could be hop'd therefrom Nevertheless I judg'd no Way wou'd be more compendious and effectual than that of  Sweat  to withstand the Evil  n its Principle and to ease  Nature  overwhelmed with a World of Impurities Wherefore  did my Endeavour to procure it and for  hat Purpose made him take one Evening a  entle  Sudorifick    This Remedy had all the success I could ex  ect the Patient sweated a little that Night  hich forthwith put a stop to the Course of  Gangrene  The Escar came away but very  slowly because of the weakness of the Patient But when this was intirely separated another Accident superven'd which threw us into a new perplexity For a large  Tendon  that had been altered by the  Gangrene  and was wasted by the Suppuration being joyn'd to its Original by a small Portion only drew after it the Matter and notwithstanding all our Care form'd a very considerable  Abscess  under the Joynt of the Knee which by encreasing by little and little overspread all the hinder Part of the Thigh  I dilated the Wound making a fresh Incision wherein I put a very small Dilater to hinder its closing up I us'd the Dilater for seven or eight Days in which time the Matter increas'd the  Sinus  was enlarg'd and the Thigh swell'd and became painful  I resolv'd then to find the most  depending  Part that I might there make a CounterOpening whereby to give a passage to the Humors and to hinder their Abode in the Part so I made a mark without upon the Place I destin'd for that Operation  Nevertheless I was willing first to try all other means I could think on I begun to leave out the  Dilater  which I had only kept between the Lips of the Wound not suffering it to pass into the Cavity of the Ulcer so I drest the Wound only with a Pledget and a Plaister and such a Bandage as might keep them on  The next Day very little Matter came away and the Day after that yet less The swelling and Pain of the Thigh were diminisht the large and deep  Sinus  was fill'd up in four or five Days thus the Operation I design'd was prevented and the Patient cur'd in ten or twelve Days after  REFLECTION  'Tis no wonder that very many able Surgeons have been deceiv'd without perceiving it in the too frequent use of  Tents  and  Dilaters  these fatal Instruments seeing I who had bid them open difiance▪ could not keep my self from a Surprise And indeed he must be a capital Enemy to 'em and have experienc'd their pernicious consequences who can imagine that a thing so small as this  Tent  was could occasion such considerable Accidents  I was much amaz'd at this Event and confirmed thereby in my Aversion for  Tents  and  Dilaters  resolving now to use more Caution than ever if I shou'd at any Time be necessitated to use them  I willingly own that the Collection of Matter under the Thigh was not occasion'd by Tents They are not always the Cause of Impostumations nor of the Accidents that follow Notwithstanding their Use contributes  much to delay the Cure and to render the Symptoms were obstinate as may be seen by the preceeding Cure For after the widening of the Sore a free passage being given the Matter would have been discharg'd insensibly and without Intermission if it had not been hindered by the  Dilater  which how little soever was yet sufficient to obstruct its passage  I hope then I shall not be thought without good Reason to have done my endeavour to put down the use of  Tents  seeing it is attended with such pernicious Consequences 'Tis easy to judge that if a little  Dilater  about the bigness of a middlesiz'd Bean was able to occasion such troublesome Symptoms a long and thick one must have caus'd much more Irritation and Disorder If I had continued to use that Extraneous Body yet eight Days longer it would have brought on a new Mortification which at that Time might have laid the Patient in his Grave considering the deplorable Estate he was reduc'd to by his former Distempers  CHAP XXIX Of another Hurt in the  Leg    OBSERVATION XXVIII  IN that same Year when I was in the Hospital of  Brianson  there was brought thither a Soldier of the Colonel's Company in  Catinat  's Regiment of Foot who had both the  Bones  of his  left Leg  broken together with a  Wound  two Fingers breadth below the Garter This Accident befell him upon the Works of the foresaid City  The lower part of the  Tibia  came out at the Wound and pass'd over its upper Part two Fingers breadth wherefore we were necessitated to make a vigorous Extension before we could put all things in their right Place We joyned the Lips of the Wound and dress'd with Pledgets only having made an Embrocation to dissolve a very considerable Bruise to which we apply'd our  Diapalma  dissolv'd Two or three Fingers breadth above the Fracture we encompass'd the Member with a little Roller using another in like manner below it the space between we fill'd up with double Compresses dipt in Wine or Brandy under the Leg we us'd a Pastboard  to hinder its bending at the Fracture and over this the Bandage with eighteen tails Finally having made all fast with the Juncks and their furniture Diversions were made in due time and a Course of Diet ordered  By reason of the Contusion we were forc'd to dress once a Day which we did without undoing the Rollers or giving any trouble to the Member and when I saw the Bruise begin to be dissipated from which I had fear'd some Accidents he was dress'd but once in two Days On the twelfth Day we took off the Rollers that we might straiten them a little which we did in such a manner that the Bones remain'd streight and unmov'd the Wound then had begun to fill up and there was not the least Exfoliation nor Separation of any Bone  The Wound was compleatly cur'd in nineteen or twenty Days after which we us'd the Rollers with Splents and the Juncks upon the Place of the Fracture  This Patient was pretty fortunate in this that during the Cure he had not felt the least Disturbance or Inconvenience notwithstanding of the Unwholsomness of the Beds in the Hospitals of the Army After fourty Days the Juncks were laid aside and he began to walk with Crutches and in a Month after he return'd to the Regiment  REFLECTION  By this Cure which was publickly perform'd it appears that it is not absolutely necessary to widen the Wound in complicated Fractures as some are of Opinion for so soon as it is dilated the Cavity is fill'd with Matter that slides in between the broken Bones and being once there it is impossible to bring it away or hinder its Stay and thus it alters and rots the Bone which it touches it dilutes and depraves the nutricious Juice thereof mixing with it and rendring it unfit for breeding a  Callus  Finally it causes Exfoliations and Separations of Bones from the Extremities of the Fracture and oftentimes sliding along the Bone upon the  Periosteum  produces Abscesses and  Sinusses  very hard to be cur'd  The Patient all this time is in very great danger chiefly in an Hospital where he is every day tormented once and often twice with long and painful Dressing The Part is weakened and the whole Body wasted away Besides 'tis observable that but few Fractures that are accompany'd with a Wound are ever cur'd in Hospitals especially when dress'd according to the ordinary Method and above all these of the  Thighs  and  Legs  where the Wounded is confin'd to his Bed are most seldom cur'd  Among all the Ancients that I have read I find none that more favours my Method of treating complicated Fractures than  Fabricius ab Aquapendente  for in his first Part Book Chap and in many other Places of his Works he is not for dilating such kind of Wounds but leaves the Separation of Bones to  Nature  's conduct And tho' he expect that some Splinters of Bones are to come away yet he fails not to stitch up the Wound For says he  Nature  will never cure a Wound in that Place where a Bone is to be excluded wherefore we ought to endeavour to heal up such Wounds which we shall not be able to effect unless Nature Judge it convenient and find that their remaining open would be unprofitable  CHAP XXX Of a third  Wound  in the  Leg    OBSERVATION XXIX  ON the fifteenth of June a Mason call'd  La pierre  was sent from  Mont Dauphin  to the Hospital at  Brainson  who laboring on the Fortifications of that Place had the inner Bone of his right Leg broken about the  middle with a Wound six Fingers breadth long and two in width This was one of the most considerable Fractures that had come under our Care in this Hospital and yet one of these that were soonest cur'd  After we had reduc'd the Fracture we joyned the Wound and drest it with a good incarnative we fomented where it was necessary and put on the Dressings in the manner above describ'd we perform'd the usual Diversions and left all untouch'd for three Days We drest it a second time after the same manner letting it alone again other three Days In fine at the fourth dressing that is upon the twelfth Day from the first dressing the Wound was quite fill'd up and more than half skin'd over wherefore straightway as gently as was possible we took off the Bandage with eighteeen tails using instead thereof Rollers with light and easy Splents upon the Fracture no Accident happen'd during all the time In fourty Days space he was able to walk with Sticks which also he laid aside soon after  REFLECTION  This wounded Man was shewed as a Prodigy to all who came to the Hospital Tho' this Cure had been the only one I had ever perform'd this way yet the Success I had therein had been sufficient to convince me of  the Excellency of this  Method  and to engage me to follow it during my Life But seeing it is moreover supported and approv'd by  Authors  and confirmed by many other Cures of a like Nature all the pretended Reasons that may be brought against it will prove too weak to overthrow it and will be slighted by all Men of good Sense and Lovers of the Truth And whatsoever may be said in order to censure it will be so far from lessening its Merit that it will rather heighten the Esteem taereof  In the last Part of this Work where I treat of Fractures that are attended with a Wound I give some Reasons further to justify this way of Practice  CHAP XXXI Another  Case  whereby this  Way  of Dressing  complicated Fractures  of the Legs is confirm'd  OBSERVATION XXX  A Soldier call'd  La Violette  of the Regiment of  Nivernois  and Company of  Bonal  was brought to the Kings Hospital settled at the Abby of  Oulx  on the first of  May  He  had two Wounds upon the  Os sincipitis  of the  ight side with the Bone uncover'd all his Face was bruis'd three of the true Ribs on the same Side were forc'd inwards he had many Bruises on his Body his right Arm was out of Joynt and the Hand all torn both his Legs were broken and shatter'd the Right one without a Wound and the Left with one All which Havock was caus'd by a Fall from a very high Rock near the Barrier of the  Fort d' Exille    All his Wounds were dress'd but these of his  Head  which were not observ'd till the next Day His Arm was reduced his right Leg which was broken about three Fingers breadth above the Ancle was drest with the circular Bandage the left with that of eighteen tails the  Tibia  was broken to pieces in the middle many of the Splinters were out of their Places being unloos'd from the Bone at one End and so could not he brought together and altogether set right in the first Dressings the Orifice of the Wound was not large and we did not dilate it It bled indifferent much for the three or four first Days I let the bleeding stay of it self without using Astringents I let him Blood many Times both in regard of the Contusions and Fractures and also because of the forcing in of the Ribs which occasion'd a great difficulty of breathing I caus'd a hole to be made in the StrawBed  and Cloathes which was sowed round to afford him the conveniency of going to Stool without being removed it being impossible to touch him without putting him to grievous Torments The Wounds in the Head were soon fill'd up without any apparent Exfoliation the Bruises in his Face were remov'd his Ribs were restor'd by means of sticking Plaisters and the difficulty of breathing continu'd but for six or seven Days The Dislocation of his Arm and the Wounds of his Hand gave us no trouble The simple Fracture tho' the Bone was shatter'd was not follow'd with any Accident the Wound of the compound one was compleatly heal'd in eight or nine Days after which we put little Bolsters upon the protuberant pieces of the shattered Bone tying them on with Rollers which had so good success that at the next Dressing no inequality was to be seen About the fortieth Day after the receiving his Fall he was able to stand up with Crutches and his left Leg that had the complicated Fracture was stronger and more clever than the Right that had the simple one only which was much admir'd by many  REFLECTION  This Cure may be of excellent Use to establish the Credit of the others if there is any  need thereof That which makes it remarkable is the two Fractures of a different Kind in the same Person one of them being complicated which yet was soonest cur'd and the Patient was able to use the Leg wherein it was before the other  M Davejan  and  M Michellet  the King's Physicians in this Hospital knowing Men and beyond all Exception were Witnesses of what I have here related and know that I have added nothing to the Truth 'tis thought also that this is the first time that a complicated Fracture was drest after this manner in this Hospital tho' it be of a pretty long standing These same Gentlemen have oftentimes seen Wounds no less considerable then these brought by the same Method to a speedy and happy Cure  I believe indeed that the strong Constitution of the Patient conduced much to the good Success of the Cure but it is no less true that the requisite Diversions were not delayed whereby whatever might have occasion'd troublesome Accidents was remov'd moreover▪ he was gently treated in dressing and the Sores were not exasperated so that in the first Days he felt but a very slight Pain He rested well and was able to take with much ease such Food as was proper for him  You will very seldom see a wounded Person in so deplorable a Condition as this Man was All the Parts of his Body were either  wounded or bruis'd Had but any Accident followed Death had been unavoidable and our Care in vain and if the  Dissolvents  and  Diaphoreticks  had not unloaded the Parts promoting the Circulation of the Blood and Course of the Humors by a gentle and insensible Transpiration I doubt the Event had neither been so sudden nor so desirable  'Tis well known that in Practice there is a great difference made between Fractures not accompanied with a Wound and those that are in many Places the latter are accounted very hard to be cur'd and often are Judg'd incurable especially those of the lower Extremities that indispensibly oblige the Patient to keep his Bed  I don't question but very many especially the  Admirers  of  Antiquity  will find fault with this  Method  and reject my  Rules  but let them with all my Heart charitably oblige the Publick with more easy and more sure  Ways  and confirm them with  unquestionable Experience  and I promise them to be among the first that shall embrace their Party  CHAP XXXII Of the  Feet    OBSERVATION XXXI  UPON the th of  June  of the same Year an Irish Gentleman call'd  John Donoughal  Nephew to LieutenantColonel  Athlone  was brought to the Hospital of  Brianson  having been wounded at an Action in the Valley of  Barcelonetta  He was shot into the right Foot and the Bullet entring on the upper and foremost part of the  Metatarsus  towards the Side was lodg'd between two Bones of the same Part  A Surgeon upon the Spot did whatever he could to draw out the Bullet by the same way it entred but his Endeavours prov'd fruitless  The first Day that I drest it after I had consider'd the Wound and observ'd the Way of the Bullet I found it could not be got out unless a  CounterOpening  were made which accordingly was done at the middle and hinder Part of the  Metatarsus  and the Bullet was drawn out with very little Pain  The Wounds were drest according to our Method with Embrocations over all the Part Diversions were not omitted and he was dress'd but once a Day with our simple Remedies and the Plaister of dissolv'd  Diapalma    The  Escar  being separated no great  Suppuration  ensu'd no Bones came away at least that we could observe henceforth he was drest but every other Day and was cur'd in thirty Days or thereabouts after which time he return'd on Foot to his Regiment  REFLECTION  'Tis almost universally known that  Wounds  of the  Extremities  accompany'd with a  Fracture  are tedious and troublesom to be cur'd the  Tendons  and  Nerves  that here abound make these Parts of a quick Sense and render the Wounds therein obnoxius to grievous Accidents therefore it is that they require to be dress'd with much  Gentleness  and  Remedies  particularly suited to 'em I have elsewhere remark'd that  Tents  and  putrifying Medicines  are extreamly hurtful to Nervous and Tendinous Parts wherefore I shall speak no more of them I shall only here take notice that some prepossest Persons have had the confidence to say that this  Way  of Dressing so  gentle  and so  easy  has something of Rashness in it that it is very dangerous to omit the  Circumstances observ'd by the Ancients that their Rules were not laid down without good Reason and that their Method in Fine ought to be put in Practice among the Soldiers Tho'  Reason  and  Experience  are both on my Side yet I am ready further to maintain that this Method has nothing of  Temerity  in it seeing it follows the Footsteps of  Nature  which ought ever to be our Guide in the Curing of Wounds We can never go astray if we follow her Conduct and if we swerve from her Paths we can't but fall headlong into Dangers  Mereover it is no less necessary to be an able Surgeon and expert in Practice in order to manage a Cure according to this Method that appears so easie than according to the common way of Practice which is full of so many Circumstances that are ever unprofitable and oftentimes pernicious And we may reasonably presume if our  Method  has been so successful when practis'd on Soldiers dieted and dress'd in an Hospital where the  Air  is oftentimes  infected  that it will yet be much more so when used towards Patients who have all the Conveniences of  Life  and who  breath  in a pure  Air    CAAP XXXIII Of the  Feet    OBSERVATION XXXII  WHen I was at  Luserne  in the Year a Soldier of the TrainedBands was brought to the Hospital there who had receiv'd a shot in his right Foot that was pretty remarkable for the way of the Bullet which was of a very small Size It enter'd at the inward and middle part of the great Toe and came out at the end of the little one no Excoriation appearing either above or below  The first and second Bones of the great Toe were broken the second of the three next were intirely crush'd to pieces and the last of the little Toe in like manner  When we parted the Toes one from another a great many little pieces of Bones were to be seen which seem'd only to hang by a Thread I first set to rights every Bone by it self and afterward set them in order one with another between every Toe and its fellow I gently slipt in a little piece of Linnen dipt in  Spirit  of  Wine  and I made small Compresses pretty hard and longish which I put  above and under the Toes in form of Splents being wet also with  Spirit  of  Wine  I wrapt all up in Linnen without Oyntments or Plaisters and supported the Foot with a Sole sustaining all with an easie Bandage  I took off the Dressings after two Days and without removing the little pieces of Linnen between the Toes I fomented all the Part with Spirit of Wine and dress'd it as before the Suppuration was but very small and indeed it was with Design to prevent it that I us'd nothing but the Spirit of Wine which was the only Remedy I employ'd to compleat the Cure this was effected in about three Weeks time without the coming away of the least bit of the Bones tho' they had been intirely shatter'd to Pieces  REFLECTION  All Experience assures us that 'tis  Nature  and a good  Method  that effect the Cure and not at all either the great Labour or vast Charges bestowed upon it If I had used in this Case the ordinary Oyntments and putrefying Medicines they would have occasion'd a plentiful Suppuration whereby the Splinters of the Bones had been loosen'd and brought away the Cure had been delayed and possibly the Toes lost which had been enough to render the Patient lame for all his Life  Tho' this Cure is not of great Consequence yet the Conduct therein us'd may suffice to shew that the Bones do easily enough reunite when they enjoy the necessary Repose when the Air has no time to alter them or to exert its Efficacy in the Wound and when the use of Suppurative Remedies is laid aside which are ever hurtful as has been above observ'd and I will here add as to the last mention'd Medicines I know no kind of Wound in what part of the Body soever that does absolutely stand in need of them  But lest I should weary my Reader with unprofitable Repetitions I shall content my self with having describ'd the two preceding Cures of  Wounds  in the  Feet  tho' in this  Hospital  we have had a great number of this Nature through our Hands that have had a most  Happy  and  comfortable Event    CHAP XXXIV The Conclusion of the Second Part  IF my weak  Reasonings  and the  Authorities  I have adduc'd together with the  Experiences  which I have faithfully related shall not prove sufficient to convince some Persons of the  Excellency  of my  Method  I have only one  Request  to make to such as shall withhold  their  Approbation  which is that they wou'd make a  Trial thereof  themselves  I could have recited a very great number of Cures like unto these contain'd in this second Part I could have describ'd the Cures I have performed on wounded Persons in my  Travels  or in the  Army  where Occasions of this Nature daily present themselves because of the Actions that ordinarly fall out such are those of the Valley of  Barcelonetta  and the Battel of  Marseills  fought  Oct  But this would have been for the most part to say the same things over and over again all these Cures being manag'd well nigh after the same Way  I suppose it will be easily enough believ'd that I could have enlarged the bulk of this Volume with many other  Observations  seeing it is a Truth that in four Years time wherein I have been in this Place more than  three Thousand Persons  have gone from it compleatly cur'd  Some there are who not being able to discover the genuin Cause of the desirable Success that has attended the Cures done in this Hospital and willing to blast the Reputation of a  Method  to which only they were owing have attributed all to  Chance  and have given out that we have been accompanied with an Extraordinary  Good Fortune  as if forsooth the Curing of Wounds were like a  Game at Cards or throwing of Dice or as if blind Chance had any thing to do where Experience and good Conduct are so indispensibly necessary  I have hitherto only treated of such Wounds as were very considerable and were almost all somewhat complicated from whence I hope it will be believ'd that simple Wounds wherewith I was unwilling to fill up this Part were cur'd after this Method with much more Speed and Ease than those here related  It may possible be thought strange that in certain Cures of single Centinels describ'd in this second Part I have declared that I us'd on different Occasions the  Balsam  of  Peru  which is scarcely probable considering the Place and the Condition of the Persons This I own and do nevertheless aver that I have said nothing but the Truth But when it is considered that his  Royal Highness  the  Duke  of  Savoy  sent his Apothecary to  Luserne  with Orders to supply himself from thence with whatever was most precious and to furnish a most compleat Shop of Medicines for the Hospital of that Place what I have said will easily be believ'd seeing not only that Remedy but also  Pearls Bezoar  and the most costly Cordials were bought up and us'd freely and without Distinction  THE HospitalSurgeon OR A New Gentle and Easie Way to Cure speedily all sorts of WOUNDS  PART III  Exhibiting a General  View  of the  Author's new Way  of  Practice  not only with respect to  Wounds  but in other  Cases  belonging to  Surgery  and a  Description  of the  simple Remedies  he uses With some  Observations    CHAP I The Design of this Part And what it contains  ALtho' in the preceeding  Parts  of this Book where I declare the  Advantages  and  Excellency  of this  Way  confirming the same by  Reason Authority  and manifold  Experiences  I have sufficiently made known my  Practice  with Relation  to  Wounds  yet because it is there delivered without any Method and with frequent Interruptions being interwoven with my Reasonings and Observations I shall for the Ease and Advantage of my  Reader  but especially of the  young Surgeon  in this  third Part  give a general  Prospect  as it were at once of all the Parts of my Practice and that not only in what concerns  Wounds  to which I principally confin'd my self in the two former  Parts  but also in other  Cases  that fall under the Surgeon's Care  I will likewise here ingenuously and without Reserve give a Description of the  simple  and  easy Remedies  which I have us'd as well in the  Cure  of  Wounds  as in that of other  Distempers  that come within the Jurisdiction of  Surgery  the  happy  and  comfortable  Effects that I have so frequently seen produc'd by them is enough in my Opinion to recommend them to the Esteem and Use of the Wise and unprejudicated Artist and who candidly designs the Good of such of his fellow Creatures as fly to him for a Refuge in their Distress  Finally I will as I go along deliver some  Observations  very  instructive  and  useful  to illustrat and confirm the Subjects for the sake of which they are adduc'd to which when necessary  Reflections  shall be subjoyn'd I shall begin with  Tumors  and  Abscesses    CHAP II Of Tumors and Abscesses  MOnsieur Bertrand  a Physician of  Marseils  in his  New Reflections upon  Acid  and  Alkali gives in few Words a very clear and exact Notion of the Nature of  Tumors  But seeing I am confined by my proposed Design only to declare my Practice with respect to them those who desire to search into their  Causes  and examine their  Differences  must consult such Authors as have written upon them  The  Moderns  are not well agreed with the  Ancients  in this Matter for since the  Circulation  of the  Blood  has been found out the true Causes of many Accidents that fall out in the Cure of  Tumors  have been discover'd which the Ancients explain'd in a manner altogether different  Wherefore seeing a Disease after its Nature is understood is easy to be cur'd if one brings but a little Application of Mind the young Surgeon will do well to search into the Causes of Tumors in the Works of the Moderns where also he will find suitable Remedies  Etmullerus  in his  Medicinal Surgery  describes a  great number of very proper Medicines as also  M Verdue  in his Book call'd  Pathalogie de Chirurgie    This only I will say by the by that the  Tumors  that are accompanied with Inflammation such as a  Phlegmon  and an  Erysipelas  have more need of  Dissolving  than  Repercussive Medicines  I was confirm'd by Experience in his Opinion and the Truth thereof at this Day is not doubted tho' yet it is contrary to the Rules of the Ancients For a  Phlegmon  proceeding from an internal Cause according to the Moderns is nothing else but an Obstruction of the Vessels and that from an external Cause may be accounted of the same Nature This Accident does very commonly happen in  GunshotWounds  Under which Head we will speak a Word or two thereof  According to these Principles  Resolvents  are absolutely necessary in order to fulfil the first Intention which is to dissolve or to cause transpire the accumulated Humor  An  Erysipelas  according to these same Moderns is caus'd by a subtil and Volatil  Acid  diffus'd over the  Skin  or the  Muscles Dissolving  Medicines are also proper in this Disease  Spirit of Wine  prepar'd with  Camphire  the  Sugar  of  Lead  or  ElderVinegar  may be us'd  The Accidents that follow upon a great  Erysipelas  are frightful and violent I remember that when I was at  Luserne  a certain  Person who had a  Fever  was seiz'd with a like  Distemper  it reach'd from the middle of the  Thigh  to the  Heel  He was not so wise as to give us notice of it in time but kept the whole Part out of the Bed for a whole Night in a pretty cold Season which caus'd such a Repercussion that on the Morrow all the  Part  was gangren'd and all our Care and Diligence could not prevent its intire Mortification for in a very little time the  Gangrene  turn'd to a  Sphacelus  Before he dy'd the one half of his Body was intirely corrupted and putrify'd I never saw so dreadful a Sight or smelt so intollerable a Smell For not only the Hospital but even the whole City was in danger of being infected thereby when he was yet alive  When an  Erysipelas  will not yield to dissolving Remedies we ought without delay to have recourse to  Scarification  of the whole Part to give a passage to the Blood and moreover we shou'd foment the whole Part with  Spirit of Wine  prepar'd with  Camphire  or some other Spirituous and piercing Liquor  Vinegar  wherein  Sal armoniac  is dissolv'd or  common Salt  when that is wanting may also be us'd Notwithstanding it is not to be thought that Repelling Medicines are altogether to be laid aside only 'tis fit we know how to use them in suitable Occasions  In the Year  M Dechamp  then Commander of the third Battallion of  Sault  but  now Lieutenant Colonel of the same Regiment having an  Erysipelas  in his Leg had been treatted with the  Dissolving  Remedies prescrib'd by the Moderns for three Weeks time without perceiving any advantage thereby whereupon he caus'd himself to be brought to this Town that he might be under my Care and being inform'd by him of what Remedies had been us'd I thought fit to apply  Repercussives  and in eight Days after he departed being intirely cur'd In order to a prudent Use of Remedies the  Age  and the  Constitution  of the Patient the  Season  of the Year and the  Nature  of the  Part  affected are duly to be considered But I shall not further insist upon a Subject from which I hasten  Now as for  Abscesses  of all sorts which have come under our Hands in this Hospital and have been cur'd with an  Expedition  that may appear incredible I will only say this that judging it sufficient to make a large opening in them I left the rest to the sage conduct of  Nature  not forgetting however  general  Remedies and the  ordering  of  Diet  But as for the dressing of the  Vlcer  I only us'd a simple  Pledget  cover'd with the most  common  Medicines and sometimes in case of a Cavity small  Compresses  for expelling the Humor also a  Plaister  with a  Bandage  sufficient to keep it on  The great number of those who have been treated in this Hospital according to this Method and cured in a very small time is almost wholly beyond Belief  When the  Orifice  is not stopt up with an  Extraneous Body  'tis evident that the  Matter  can make no  Stay  in the Parts but will come away without Intermission and the Parts that were thereby kept at some distance from one another come together and at the same time do altogether expel what may there be contain'd and leave no empty Space for the Collection or Abode of what is useless and inconvenient Hence the Parts are united  Nature  acts at her Freedom whose Balsam generates Flesh better than all the Remedies in  Pharmacy    I hope I may presume that none will think I would have continued in the Use of this  Method  for so long time had I not experienc'd its desirable Effects in a thousand Occasions and I could safely take my  Oath  that never any the least Accident happened to any of those who were dress'd after this manner Every one may believe as he thinks good of what I say but I dare aver that I am much more careful that what I  say  should be  True  than that it should be  Perswasive    As for  Scrophulous Tumors  or a  Bronchocele  I have not found any Remedy so successful as  Mercury  and I believe in the Opinion I have of it I am not singular the many Experiences  I have had thereof make me much to value it He that well understands the  Cause  and  Nature  of these Evils and withall the  Vertues  and  Vses  of the Remedy whereof I speak will agree with me that this only can effect a  Compleat Cure  But all consists in the discreet Using thereof the  best  of Remedies and the most  exquisite  Instruments are ever dangerous when manag'd by Surgeons that are void of Knowledge and Experience I may possibly one Day make known to the Publick the Way which  I  have successfully us'd to bring to a perfect Cure a great number of such  Maladies  as  I  now speak of and these the most obstinate and inveterate of their Kind  CHAP III Of a Gangrene  A  Gangrene  is an Accident that occasions very much Trouble in the  Hospitals  of the Army I shall say nothing of its Causes M  Thevenin  has fully treated of this Matter and M  Causape  in his Book  Of Fevers  has given a brief Discourse thereon upon different Principles Young Surgeons may betake themselves to the reading of them for their Instruction herein  Wherefore omitting this I say that here we have no time to lose but must immediately apply our selves to stop its  Progress  and to avoid the fatal  Consequences  When the great Vessels are thereby intirely intercepted in a Member that may be cut off the best Way is to come speedily to  Operation  without attending a  Sphacelus  for the  Gangrene  goes on so swiftly in a small time that the sound Parts care assaulted before ever we can well know what we are a doing  A  Gangrene  often happens in  Gunshot  Wounds if it is not prevented as also in Bruises in Wounds made by cutting or bruising Instruments and also after a great  Phlegmon  or an  Erysipelas  and sometimes by an Extremity of Cold This last kind is very frequent about the End of Campains The Remedy we us'd was  Spirit of Niter  or  Aqua fortis  wherein  Crude Mercury  to half the quantity is dissolv'd with this we have easily enough stopt Mortifications in the Feet or Hands applying over all the Extent of the  Gaegrene  a little piece of Linnen wet in this Liquor and when this can't be had other  Spirits  may be us'd that are near of the same Quality  This Remedy I have found to be so gentle and so quick in its Operation that I never use any other in any sort of  Gangrene  It admirably well separates what is dead from what is alive without scarifying or cutting unless  when the Mischief lies very deep where these violent Remedies are absolutely necessary  Cordials  and  Wine  ought never to be omitmitted in such Cases to fortify and defend the natural Heat from an Enemy that oftentimes assaults it in its very Principle When the Body is plethorick  Bleeding  and  Clysters  are no small Help In the beginning of a  Gangrene  to  Topical  Remedies  Diversions  may be added without forgetting to order the course of  Diet  which also demands our particular Care So soon as I have discover'd a Disposition to  Mortification  I have sometimes us'd  Cataplasms  and  Emplasticks  when the Inflammation would allow to recall the  Spirits  and to give  Nature  time and Strength to resist and to overcome by the force of the Heat concentrated the Matter already endow'd with a malignant Quality or just ready to become such and I have often seen such kind of Maladies to end happily in an  Abscess  with a laudable Concoction▪  When a  Phlegmon  that follows on a Wound is violent and Obstinate and will not yield to  Diversions  and  dissolving  Medicines we must without delay scarifie the Part so far as the  Tumor  reaches to give an Outlet to the  Blood  that is extravasated and often also corrupted and to discharge and relieve the Part that otherwise might be suffocated by the Fulness and Obstruction bathing is afterward  with  Spirit of Wine  and  Sal armoniac  for if we be remiss in our Care the Enemy that is conceal'd within is privately at Work and when the outward Signs of the  Gangrene  appear all that is under the Teguments is often found already corrupted and in irremedible disorder  An  Erysipelas  is yet more formidable for it is more sudden and more nimble in its Operation It is the part of a prudent Surgeon to take heed to it in time A Fomentation with  Spirit of Wine Vnguentum Egyptiacum  and  Sal armoniac  may be us'd  Many Authors have describ'd a great number of Remedies very proper in the Cure of  Gangrenes  But in the Hospitals of the Army there is not always the conveniency of making a Choice wherefore it is good to know how to use such as are simple and easie to be found 'tis not always the most pompous  Compositions  that are of greatest Efficacy  In this sort of Distempers it is very necessary to make use of  Inward  Remedies as well as  Topical  ones such as strong  Cordials Venice Treacle Confection  of  Hyacinth  and  Alkermes  and  Alexpharmicks  to which a little  Camphire  may be added  Wine  ought to be numbered amongst the Cordials it is one of these which I very frequently use in Hospitals  Germander  taken inwardly and apply'd outwardly upon the  Grangrene  is a Remedy not to be dispis'd  A great many Remedies very proper for a  Grangrene  may be seen in  Etmullerus  He has also given an account of the way us'd by the  Germans  to separate the mortify'd from the sound Parts which is done with the  Butter  of  Antimony  This is the Remedy they use in the Amputation of Members to avoid the use of the dismembring Knife and of  Astringents  that burn and cauterize  This Remedy might be us'd with the same Success as the  Spirit  of  Nitre  which I have spoken of before there is no Difference providing we have regard to their Nature in using 'em But whither the one or 'tother be us'd to stop a  Gangrene  a simple Digestive will afterward be sufficient to hasten the falling of the Escar and finish the Cure  CHAP IV Of Ruptures  RVptures  are very frequent amongst the  Soldiers  The  Toil  they undergo and their  Manner  of  Life  do alike conduce to bring them to that miserable Condition by reason of which there is often a necessity to send them to Hospitals  My Design in this Place is only to give an account of the way I use to help  this  sort of  Distemper  For I am convinc'd and no Body doubts of it that a  Truss  is the most sure and most infallible Remedy to hinder the Falling down of the  Guts  But as there is no Convenience for making of them in Hospitals so Accidents must be quickly provided for that come oftentimes all of a sudden such as the Descent of the  Intestins  into the  Scrotum  for the Pains are then extreamly violent and so grievous that they resemble those of the  Passio Iliaca    Wherefore in such an Occasion I apply a Cataplasm of  OxDung  or else when I may have it so I use it fry'd in Oyl of  Hempseed  or in that of  Violets  This Remedy eases the Pain by dispelling the  Wind  and so gives Liberty to restore the  Gut  unto its Place providing the  Intestine  is without Excrementitious Matter in it  Astringents  of the first Rank may also be us'd as Common  Bole  c mix'd with the Glair of an Egg or  Vinegar  Some use  Emollients  but their Operation is to slow in a case requiring such hast  I have often found much advantage from a  Fomentation  made up of  Pomgranate Flowers NutGalls Cypress Nuts Pomegranate  Rind  Allom Camomil  and  Melilot  Flowers with  common Salt  all bruised and beaten and boil'd in  Forgewater  or in  rough Wine  I use it very  warm all together without straining the Liquor with this Remedy I have restored Prtients who seem'd to be upon the very  Blink  of  Death  Moreover the  Emplastrum pro Hernia  ought to be apply'd upon the Dilatation of the  Peritonaeum  which without a  Truss  the best of all Remedies will do no great Feats  CHAP V Of Wounds  I Have sufficiently explained my  Method  as to what concerns  Wounds  in the Account of Cures contain'd in my second Part My Design is here for Reasons mention'd at the beginning of this Part to entertain my Reader with a General and comprehensive  Idea  of my  Way  of Practice that may quadrat to all the different sorts of Wounds that occur  Perhaps this  Method  may seem to swerve a little from that of the  Ancients  or may not agree so much with that in use amongst the most Part of the  Moderns  as some could desire But I would entreat those who shall read this  Treatise  not to condemn it before they have thorowly examin'd the Truth of the Matters of Fact and the Reasonableness of the  Rules  therein laid down for our usual Rashness in judging  of what we don't altogether understand is often the Cause of our  Error  However I am in good Hopes that e're it be long this  Way  shall be acknowledged to be the Product of Experience and its Evidence to be an infallible Mark of its  Truth    Moreover I dare confidently affirm that this  Method  howsoever new it may appear to many ought not to be number'd among these things that are more  curious  than  profitable Reason  speaks for it  Nature  vouches it  Experience  confirms it putting it beyond all doubt and about  three thousand Wounded Persons  happily cur'd by it may warrant any one in the Use thereof In the first and second Part of this Work I explain at length the  Reasons  that Justify my Practice and support them with several  Authorities  both of the Ancients and Moderns  If I condemn  Tents  as Instruments unprofitable and destructive 'twas  Experience  that convinc'd me of their Mischeif and I hope henceforward very many Surgeons shall range themselves on my Side  If I recommend in a special Manner a  Gentle  and  Speedy Way  of Dressing I must herein be justify'd by all Men of a sound Understanding And indeed I don't question but every reasonable Person after he has been rightly inform'd will sufficiently approve what I have advanc'd in this Matter  Finally in asserting that the  Air  is  hurtful  to Wounds  I  have said nothing but what  Hippocrates Galen  and many others were sufficiently convinc'd of 'Tis known to all that the  cold piercing Air  is very pernicious to our  Nature  On this  I  have enlarg'd a little in the seventh Chapter of the first Part suitable to that little Measure of  Vnderstanding  wherewith  I  am endow'd  I  suppress  frequent Dressing  that  Nature  may be allowed Time to act and to restore the wounded Parts unto their first Condition which she can't do when she is so often interrupted in her  Work    I  have ever observ'd this as a general  Rule  to dilate by making  Incisions  Gunshot Wounds at the first Dressing as also all other  penetrating  Wounds and such as have a  narrow Orifice  This is the true Way to keep off and to avoid the most part of Accidents that happen in Practice and to prevent being reproach'd when any troublesome Symptom falls out  I  sometimes use  Dilaters  in the first Dressing to hinder the Union of new Incisions to keep their Brims asunder and to leave an open Passage for Matter or any thing else to come away when  Nature  shall be dispos'd to expell 'em otherwise I use them not lest  I  should hinder the closing up of the Wound  When the  Bleeding  is Obstinate  I  use calcin'd  Vitriol astringent  Pouders  Pouder  of the  Vine  Styptick  Waters  c  'Tis only in desperate Cases that  I  have recourse to  Roman Vitriol Aqua fortis  and the  Actual Cautery    I  have ever in the first Dressings found much Advantage from  Defensives  which  I  apply'd above and sometimes below the  Wound  to allay the  Heat  of the  Blood  to moderate its  Activity  and resist  Fluxions  observing always to make them somewhat  Emplastick    I  am always careful to empty the lower Belly by  Clysters  having found that the  Retaining  of the  Excrements  is ever a mighty Hindrance to the  Good Disposition  of the Body  When the  Bleeding  has been great  I  don't take off the first  Dressings  till the second or third Day after they are apply'd that the Wounded Vessels may have time to unite and providing the  Season  and the  Pain  or other  Accidents  don't hinder  I  every Day take off the Roulers during that time and leaving only that which supports and keeps on the  Astringents  I make  Embrocations  when needful and renew the  Defensives  by this means  I  often avoid the  Suffocation  that may happen if the  Astringent  and  Emplastick  Medicines are too long kept on the Parts which by stopping up the  Pores  of the Skin and retaining the  Vapors  that ought perpetually to pass out thereby are the Occasion of many very grievous Accidents that happen to  Wounds Too great a quantity of Bands and Compresses has often the same Effect  I  use only  Pledgets  after the first and sometimes after the second Dressing and continue the  Embrocations  till the  Contusion  is dissolv'd which may be in five or six Days more or less according to the Bigness and Condition thereof or to the Nature of the  affected Part    When a  Phlegmon  or an  Erysipelas  c happens to a Wound  I  avoid the Use of  Vnctuous Things  which are hurtful here employing only such Cataplasms as are proper for easing Pain and sometimes also dissolving Medicines which together with  Diversions  and a proper  Course  of  Diet  resist and overcome these Accidents  I  find it very profitable when  I  dress the Wound to cover it with a  Linnen Cloth  wet with warm  Wine  or  Brandy  immediately after  I  have taken off the Dressings this defends strengthens quickens and unites the  Spirits  and hinders the Particles of the  Air  and the  Effluvia  therein to stick to the Wounds or pass to their Bottom  After the first Dressing is over  I  never search the Wound either with my  Finger  or  Probe  unless there is an absolute Necessity thereof  I  also disallow the use of  dry Tents  so commonly employ'd for drying up the Matter from the very Bottom of Wounds and  and generally every Thing that may  irritate  or occasion  Pain  or may oppose the Design of  Nature  which is the Healing up of the Wound  I don't as some do take up a deal of Time in striving exactly to empty the  Wound  of all the  Matter  that is in it but as quickly as can be  I  apply the  Dressings  to hinder as hath been said the Action of the Acid Parts of the  Air  and the  Dissipation  of the  Spirits  that the Strength of the afflicted Parts may be preserv'd as much as possible which is very requisite in order to enable them to bear up against them any Evils wherewith they are assaulted on all Hands  When I say in the fifth Chapter of the first Part that the  Matter  ought not to be retain'd in Wounds and that  Nature  would not be at such Pains to drive it out if she could have any Advantage by its  Stay  this is to be understood of such Matter as is kept in by Means of  Tents  which becomes hot and ferments and by its Abode acquires an evil Quality and might be suck'd up by the Veins for that which is Laudable is hurtful only by Accident being of its own Nature Balsamick because it is ever mixed with good store of the  Natural Balsam  or  Nutri  ious Juice  which without Intermission flows into the Wounded Parts What I say is confirm'd by that which is done in some Places of  Holland    where of the  Laudable Matter  that runs from Wounds they make a  Balsam  that is of great Use in their Cure  It is not at all improbable that the  Sound Matter  that comes from Wounds may promote their  Cure  when by the  Hand  and  Diligence  of a skilful  Artist  it is purify'd and separated from its Excrementitions Parts for what remains is only the  Balsam  of the  Blood  This will be more easily conceiv'd by those that consider that there are some learned and Ingenious  Italians  who cure the  BludyFlux  with a  Salt  drawn from the Excrements of the Patient and also such as have a  Dropsy  with the  Salt  of the Waters that are drawn from their Belly  Etmullerus  also very much commends the  Excrement  of the  Ears  for curing Wounds  All these things contain less balsamick Juice than the  Matter  that runs from Wounds when it is not altered by the Heat of an essential or Symptomatick  Fever  when it has not remain'd long in the Wound being detain'd there by  Tents  c or in fine when it is not deprav'd by the use of  putrifying Medicines  or others of a like sort that destroy its natural Temperament  M Verdue Tom    Pag  speaks very patly to this Purpose when he says that  Matter  is the  Chilous Part  of the  Blood  Wherefore it is against all manner of Reason that some Moderns require that the Wound be accuratly  wip'd dry seeing thereby it is depriv'd of that which only can effect the Cure  When I know or am in doubt that there is some  Extraneous Body  in a Wound which  Nature  would exclude by the  Orifice  or that any  Splinter  is separated from a Bone without having to do with  Tents  I sufficiently dilate the Wound with  Prepared Spunge  or the  Pith  of  Elder  or  Gentian Root  fitted for that purpose that a free Passage may be given to any thing that must come away This way is understood by every Surgeon and there is no Difficulty therein providing one be careful to use it  Seasonably    I  can't restrain my self from highly blaming those who very patiently marshal up in Order a great number of  Dossels  or  Dilaters  of which they make three or four  Lays  in Wounds that are any thing large observing a certain Symmetry and Proportion which exposes to the View of Assistants a Method no less pernicious than contrary to  Common Sense  and  Reason  As for the  Decency  and  Seemliness  which adorn and set off that Way it will be no less conspicuous in making large Pledgets of long and pretty fine Lint that may at once reach over all the Extent of the Wound  I my self have experienc'd what a fond Opinion is commonly entertain'd of that  Cruel Method  for the greatest part of Wounded  Persons believe themselves  neglected  if an  Hour  is not spent in  searching  their Wounds and as much in  Applying  the Dressings but  Charity  obliges us to free them from their Error  When a  Wound  is deep with much  Loss  of  Substance  I fill it only with  Pledgets  of fine Lint left leaving an empty Space it should be fill'd up with  Air  I apply them very slightly cover'd or moistned with some Medicine agreeable to the Nature and Quality of the Wound these are not so hard as  Dossels  and consequently occasion less Pain and don't so much hinder the closing up of the Wound being not so compact as to hinder the breeding of Flesh neither are they so apt as  Tents  to be lost in the Wound or fix'd in some Corner of its Cavity  I am no less careful to suppress  Injections  than  Tents  having observ'd their Effects to be no less pernicious for they  liquefy  and  dissolve  the  Blood enlarge  the Wound cause  Pain  and make  proud Flesh  to grow  I disallow the Use of  Aromatick Wines  in dressing as also of Fomentations that are frequently us'd by some which conduce very much to the protracting of the  Cure    'Tis very sure that these Parts drink up the  Moisture  which softens relaxes and puffs up the  Skin  and passing through it fills them like Spunges the  Natural Heat  of the afflicted Parts  is thereby suffocated and extinguisht no perfect  Concoction  can be perform'd but all is turn'd to  Matter  and  Corruption  and if this  Method  is long continu'd as it too often falls out the  Ligaments  are relax'd and the Patient is in Danger of being lame for all the rest of his Life  This way of Practice is in a particular manner pernicious in  Hospitals  of the  Army  where that which is necessary to give Remedies all the required Qualities is not always to be had For Instance how can they be kept warm without a sufficient number of Cloathes to preserve the Patient from the Cold Hence it is that in a Moment after Application all the Dressings become cold and frozen which occasions  Oedema  's very hard to be cur'd and oftentimes also Symptoms that are yet more troublesom  A right Course of  Diet  is so neeessary in curing of Wounds that without it an infinite number of  Accidents  cannot be prevented But it is necessary to have respect to the  Age  and  Constitution  of the Patient to his  Habit  of  Body  to the  Season  of the  Year  and the  Nature  of the  Wound    'Tis to be observ'd that a very exact Diet is a mighty hindrance to the Cure of Wounds in Soldiers who ordinarily feel more the Inconveniences of a too scanty than those of a too plentiful Table Wherefore I don't  altogether deprive 'em of the use of substantial Food unless when Necessity requires otherwise and this keeps up their  Strength  For Broths tho' good are not so nourishing in Hospitals as to be sufficient of themselves for Food and yet this is no prejudice to the necessary  Diversions Wine  also ought not to be kept from them being allay'd a little unless in some very important Cases It resists the ill Quality and Malignity of the  Air  which is always impure in Hospitals and in a Word  Wine  is their  Cordial  and  Counterpoison    It is very necessary also especially in Hospitals of the Army to have Regard to the  Situation  of the  wounded Part  which ought to be such as to give liberty to the  Circulation  of the  Blood  and a  Descent  to the  Matter  and  Ease  to the Patient I have known the neglect of this Point occasion very troublesom Symptoms  If a  Surgeon  is not so charitable as to give Instructions to those that attend the wounded how to make their Beds suitable to the Quality and Nature of their Wounds the miserable Patients are ever in Pain by the Inconvenient Position which is enough of it self to deprive them of the Rest that is so necessary for 'em and to render their Sufferings and our Cares to no purpose  The  Head  ought to be plac'd indifferently  high  and laid upon something that's soft without  Feathers if it may be had with a  Descent  to promote the Discharge of the Matter When the  Neck  is wounded it must be in a manner slightly supported by the Pillow or by Linnen folded into several Doubles we must fill up the empty Space between the Head and Shoulders  Wounds of the  Breast  require an  easie  and  unstrain'd  Posture rather high than low But in this we must have most Regard to the Conveniency of the wounded Person  These of the  lower Belly  and  Loins  demand almost the same Situation To these of the  Bladder  and  Genital Parts  an undisturb'd  Repose  a convenient Bandage which is a  Suspensory  and a Position somewhat raised are very needful  Every Body knows that the  Arm  when wounded must be supported by a  Sling  that passes over the Neck and that in Wounds and Fractures of the  ShoulderBone  a Pillow is necessary to keep it almost as high as the Breast in which posture it is most at ease In Wounds or Fractures of the  Wrist Metacarpus  and  Fingers  we must keep the Hand extended with a piece of Board  Wounds of the  Thighs  require that the Member be plac'd streight neither too high nor too low These of the  Legs  and  Feet  do necessarily demand that the Part be something high that so the courser Blood may freely circulate  for otherwise the Blood by its Weight might be stopt in the Veins and corrupted there and thus the Circulation being suppress'd many grievous  Accidents  would ensue This hanging or low Position of the Legs not being minded by many Surgeons exceedingly conduces to render Wounds of these and the Feet very uneasie to be cur'd and makes 'em degenerate into  Vlcers    It is also very necessary to  stretch  out the Legs and keep them  straight  during the Cure otherwise it will be difficult to restore them to their natural Figure after it is over chiefly if it has been of some Continuance as supposing the Leg had been kept bent when under Cure of a  complicated  or  simple  Fracture This is what I have often observ'd and to which young Surgeons would do well to take heed Fractures of the  Tibia  and  Fibula  and simple Wounds in the Legs if any thing considerable stand in need of a  Sole  to sustain the Foot as well as these of the  Tarsus Metatarsus  and  Toes    Too  strait Bandage  especially in  Gunshotwounds  occasions troublesom Accidents it hinders the Circulation and causes frequently Mortifications Wherefore I use only such as may keep on the Dressings chiefly in the first Days Many have been brought wounded to this Hospital with the Parts half Gangren'd by too tight Tying for in Gunshot Wounds  the wounded Members ever swell some more some less whereby the Bandage tho' but moderatly strait becomes intollerable before the next Dressing Rest also is of no less Consequence to the Patient Now where all these things meet together and are rightly order'd they are commonly of very great Advanto the wounded  I use  Purgatives  with great Caution and after the time of the most  dangerous Symptoms  is over beginning ever with the slightest that only loosen such as  Cassia  and  Manna  c during which time  Clysters  together with the use of  Prunes  give no small Relief  Oats  and  cleansed Barly  being easily digested and yeilding a moderate Nourishment qualify the  preternatural Heat  of the  Blood  and keep open the Belly  As for the  Topical Remedies  which I commonly employ in Dressing of Wounds they have nothing singular in them which is not pretty well known to the most part of Surgeons  I avoid as much as possible the use of  Putrifying Medicines  and of  Powerful Suppuratives  because they destroy the Temperament of the Parts disunite the Particles of the  Blood  corrupt and deprave the  Nutricious Juice  which ought carefully to be preserv'd in a good Condition 'Tis this which mov'd the Ancients so  often to recommend to us to maintain the wounded Parts in their  Natural Temper    Hippocrates  affirms that all  Contused Wounds  ought to be brought to  Suppuration  in order to a speedy Cure whereby he seems to patronize and allow the use of  Putrifying Medicines  which commonly are employ'd to bring a Wound to Suppuration But me thinks this ought not to take place in the Hospitals of the Army where the  Air  is ordinarily infected by the  Breath  and abode of the Sick and which are almost ever encompassed with the  Graves  of the Dead whose number is but too great  'Tis very certain that this nearness of the  Place  of  Burying  chiefly in hot Seasons imparts to the  Air  by the Steams that rise from thence a Complication of Corruption and ill Qualities that occasions  Rottenness  in Wounds  Alteration  and great  Suppuration  and often causes great  Mortality  in the Hospitals and Places adjacent Now according to this Maxim of that Author  Gunshot Wounds  must be drest with these same Medicines seeing they are of the number of contused ones  I don't absolutely deny but there may be some Occasions wherein such may be us'd However I may be allowed to say with all the Respect I owe so celebrated an Author that in  Hospitals  we ought to shun as much as possible  Putrefying  and  Suppurative  Remedies and others of a  like  Nature even where the  Escar may require a considerable time before its Falling For by the seasonable ordering of  Diversions  and the Course of  Diet  all these Accidents are often prevented which the delay of the Suppuration might cause and one may without scruple use as I have done such Remedies as have a Vertue to resist Corruption as the Spirit of Wine which  Etmullerus  prescribes even in Gunshot Wounds and which I us'd at the first Dressing on the Day of the Battle of  Marseils  without having observ'd any evil consequence of my so doing for besides a  Good Method  which may be call'd the Strength and chief Instrument of a Workman it is of high concern to understand and to know how to choose Remedies that agree with the Temper of the Parts to which they are apply'd and to maintain them in that State wherein God has created them But it proves often a very difficulty Task to satisfy  this Intention    As there is an admirable variety of  Constitutions  so it would seem that it were necessary to use different Remedies to Wounds of the same Nature and of the same Parts in different Subjects The  Sex Age  and  Season  must also be considered I have likewise observ'd in my Travels by People of different Nations that have been under my Hands that diverse  Climates  require  particular Applications  in certain Circumstances necessary to the Cure of  Wounds For the Constitutions of Men depend chiefly on the Countries they inhabit on their  Situation  high or low dry or moist the  Winds  that rule the  Food  and  Water  that they take So that they differ among themselves according as the  Heavens  look upon them with different  Aspects    But not to search any further into these things which can't be contain'd within the Limits prescrib'd to this little  Work  and don't properly belong to my  Subject  I will only say that it is easy enough to distinguish a proper Remedy from one that is not so That which corrupts and depraves the  Natural Balsam  is known by looking into the Wound from which if there proceeds a strong and  Stinking Vapor  'tis a sign that the Matter is not concocted seeing it is thin blackish too plentiful watery and of an offensive Smell  The  Flesh  likewise has its peculiar Signs it is dull of feeling and sometimes is cover'd with another  proud  Flesh Oftentimes there is to be seen over all the Wound a certain black or white  Filth  which some as I have often known scrape or cut off at every Dressing whereby the Wound is enlarg'd and the Cure delay'd Others imputing it to the vicious Temperament and ill Disposition of the Patients Body have recourse to Purgatives which occasion still more new Accidents such as  Fevers  c  But be this as it will 'tis certain that we ought not always to delay till the last before we change the Remedy our Smell and our Sight only are sufficient to direct us in this Occasion  Hippocrates  orders a Medicine to be chang'd when it does not what it ought or was design'd for  But we must not on the other Hand fall into the contrary Extremity of changing the  Oyntments  sometimes once and often twice every Day not giving time to a Remedy to act and exert its Vertue on the Part to which 'tis apply'd 'Tis necessary that the wounded Part draw as it were Nourishment from the Medecine and therefore it must have a requisite Time allowed it for that Purpose it must if I may be allowed so to speak amalgamate with the  Nutricious Juice  of the Part or at least if it don't increase its Quantity it ought to preserve it in the natural State and when fallen therefrom restore it again To be capable of these Effects it must be endow'd with a Volatil and Oyly Spirit viscous also and temperate as  Balsams  and  Vulneraries  are which I have us'd with very good Success  I have often experienc'd on many Occasions in several Hospitals and chiefly in this and in very considerable Cases that after I had in vain us'd many Remedies authoriz'd by  Custom  the  Balsam  describ'd in the  Sacred Writings  has  had surprizing Effects and that Members at the Point of being cut off have been thereby cur'd with much Ease This Hospital of  Brianson  might afford many Instances of the Truth hereof but I shall content my self with the two following  CHAP VI An  Observation  of a very considerable Case  A  Surgeon  of this Hospital being one of those who was most employ'd in dressing the wounded by Accident had a  Thorn  run into the  middle Finger  of his right Hand which pierc'd the Tendon of the Muscle that bends it his whole  Hand  and  Arm  were attack'd with very troublesome Symptoms accompany'd with a continual Fever extreamly violent and an unsufferable Pain  Five or six Days past over before I had notice of this Accident and all the Symptoms were at the very worst I found all things in a deplorable Condition the  Arm  swell'd as big as the Leg the  Hand  of a Monstrous Size and the  Finger  as great as ones Arm many Cavities were in the inward Part thereof and some in the outward from which issued a serous Matter there was another large  Sinus  under  the  Musculas palmaris  with an Orifice near the Roots of the Fingers  I straitway laid open the Finger on the inward Part from one End to the other and found the  Tendon  swell'd and corrupted I did not enlarge the Orifices on the outward Part nor that of the Palm hoping that all these would he well if I could but overcome the Accidents  He was  Let Blood  and had a  Clyster  given him tho' somewhat too late he observ'd an exact Course of  Diet  and was drest with the Balsam of  Arcaeus  On the Morrow when I took off the Dressings I was surpriz'd as I had been the Day preceeding with a Vapor of an intollerable Smell the Lips of the Wound were turned outward which made me despair of a Cure and judge it would be necessary to cut off the Hand The  Matter  remain'd undigested the  Fever  the  Pain  and the  Swelling  continu'd as before he was drest in the same manner as the Day before with addition only of a little  Spirit  of  Wine  The  Bleeding  was repeated and also the  Clyster    The Day following the Wound was in the same Condition save that the Corruption appear'd to encrease We were of Opinion that nothing but  Amputation  could save his Life But for as much as Art and Reason dictate that the preservation of the Members ought to be endeavour'd so much as possible  and as we are oblig'd in Conscience to try all Remedies before we come to that Extremity I resolved forthwith to change the Medicines judging rightly that what had been us'd might have occasion'd this depravation of the  Salts  whence it was to be fear'd a total Corruption of the  Nutricious Juice  might follow  Wherefore now I us'd the  Balsam  of the  Scriptures  mixt with a third Part of that of  Arcaeus  in this I wetted the Pledgets which I apply'd very warm over all the Wound and upon the  Sinusses  I pour'd some of it also into the  Sinus  of the  Musculus palmaris  and upon it I put a Plaister of  Dipalma  dissolv'd in  Oyl of Roses  and good  Vinegar    On the next Day after this we found all things much chang'd to the better The  Fever  and  Pain  were lessen'd and there was nothing so ill a  Smell  as before  I question not but the Fever is a Symptom troublesom enough and able to cause all these Effects and that by the Motion it excites in the Blood it seperates saline and sulphureous Juices that by irritating the Fibers may occasion that turning out of the Lips of the Wound their Swelling and that insupportable Smell But it can't on the other side be deny'd that outward Remedies conduce much to procure that Fermentation and Corruption in the wounded Part when they are such as putrify  because they dissolve the Blood and other Liquors causing  Irritations Corruptions  and great  Suppurations  and destroy the Temperament of the Parts to which they are apply'd Whereas when  Balsamick  and  Spirituous  Medicines are us'd they produce quite contrary Effects For by allaying the Sharpness of the Humors and making the Blood fluid they resist Corruption dry up the Moisture and in the Place where they are apply'd abate the Commotion of the Humors caus'd by the  Fever    In fine whither it was by this or any other Way 'tis certain that the  Change  of the Medicine here produc'd a notable Alteration on our Patient for tho' the Fever appear'd but very little abated by all that I had formerly done the very next Day after this the Lips begun to come nearer together the Pain and Defluxion ceas'd and which is most of all the ill Smell was quite evanisht so that in five or six Days he was past all Danger and the Cure was compleated in a little time after  M Le Clerk  Physician to the King in his  Compleat Surgery  commends much the Samaritan Balsam to which we have given the Title of  The Balsam of the Holy Scriptures  and the Approbation of such a Man is sufficient to justifie its Use I thought it not unfit likewise here to subjoyn the Discription of another  compound  Samaritan Balsam  of an admirable Vertue It is made up of equal Parts of  Spanish Wine  and  Oyl of Roses  to each Pound of which Mixture two Ounces of  Sugarcandy  and as much  Honey  of  Violets  must be added and all boil'd on a gentle Fire and skim'd till the Wine is consum'd This may be call'd the  Balsam  of  Balsams  or the  Compound Samaritan Balsam    CHAP VII An  Observation  of another Case  M  Vert  the Younger an Ensign of the Company of  M de Beauvet  Lieutenant of the King at  Brianson  and Commander of the Second Battalion of  Sault  had no less Reason to applaud my  Method  and the good Effects of my  Remedy  than him we discours'd of in the preceding Chapter  He was wounded with a Sword at  Pragelas  in the outward Part of the left  Arm  near the bending of the  Elbow  The Wound was at first neglected being not well dress'd for without dilating it in any Manner a  Tent  was thrust into it as long as it could possibly receive which occasion'd such frightful Accidents that the Patient thought of nothing  but losing both his  Arm  and his  Life  In the inward part of the Arm opposite to the Wound Matter was collected and  Abscesses  form'd which oblig'd him to consult the principal Surgeons of the Regiments who thought it convenient to make an  Opening  in that Part which accordingly was done By the large and deep  Incisions  that were made the  Artery  was opened so that they were oblig'd to use the  Actual Cautery  to stop the Bleeding By this means the Wound was enlarg'd and the Pain and the Accidents increas'd  The first Wound was still drest as before with  Tents  but the Wounded Person having kept his Bed for fifty Days and his Wounds being still in a very wretched Condition he was advis'd by the abovemention'd Gentleman  M de Beauvet  to cause himself be transported to  Brianson  to try if there he might find any Help He was committed to my Care and I found the inward or lower Wound the length of a large  Span  and four or five Fingers breadth wide The  Artery  and  Tendons  were uncover'd the ancient or outward Wound whose Orifice was very strait had in it a pretty long  Tent  which shut up the passage of three or four  Sinusses  that took up all the Joynt  The  Arm  and  Hand  were Oedematous being much swell'd and painful I began by making an Incision in the Wound on the outward Part whereby I discovered the Orifices  of the  Sinusses  into which I dropt a little of  our Balsam  mixt as I formerly said with some of that of  Arcaeus    The large and lower Wound was drest with the same Remedy We us'd expulsive Cmpresses to press together the Sides of the Cavities which we kept on with a proper Bandage Moreover we laid aside the Aromatick Wines that had been before us'd upon all the Part to its great Detriment  Three Days after it had been drest in this Fashion the most Part of the Accidents disappear'd he begun to rise up from his Bed to take his Victuals and to gather Strength all the deep  Cavities  were fill'd up the  Artery  the  Nerve  and the  Tendons  were cover'd over the  Pain  the  Fluxion  and the  Oedemaetous Swelling  were 'quite gone and by this powerful Incarnative the Cure was compleated in a Fortnight with the assistance of a little  Vnguentum Apostolorum  wherewith we sometimes use to consume the Flesh After this he mounted his Horse and went for the  Air  into his own Country  This I may confidently affirm as a certain Truth that when the Balsam we speak of is genuin and unsophisticated it may serve at the same time both for  Food  and  Medicine  being made up only of  sweet Oyl  and  Wine  And that it may be us'd not only for curing Wounds of the  Mouth  of the  Tongue  of the  Gullet  and  Windpipe  and generally of all the  Breast  but likewise in obstinate  Dysenteries  in  Relaxations  of the  Fibers  of the  Ventricle  in  Vlcers  thereof and in these of the  Guts  and of all the  lower Belly  For if we consider its Nature we shall find it of a friendly Quality and extreamly agreeable to our Constitution being compounded of such things as serve us dayly for Food  Sweet Oyl  softens loosens sweetens and penetrates and when it is boil'd with  Wine  which it devours as it were and consumes retaining with its self all the Vertue thereof it is enabled to perform all these Operations with much more Ease It cuts dissolves strengthens restores the Spirits breeds Flesh and is Astringent all which our  Balsam  performs being indow'd with the most useful Vertues of these Remedies and containing a Volatil Oyly and Temperate  Salt  that is Astringent and Sarcotick And if a little  Sugar  is boil'd with it it becomes yet more excellent is more Vulnerary and Balsamick has no Acrimony and is without either Smell or Tast  Had this  Remedy  how simple soever it may appear produc'd such Effects in the Hands of any other but my self they wou'd without question have made a great Secret of its Composition and tho' this had been known to many yet they wou'd never have publish'd its  Vertues    It were greatly to be wish'd that there were only  one Remedy  which might be able to answer all Intentions so we shou'd not be always oblig'd to have in the Patients Chamber a whole  Apothecary's Shop  which is often no less prjudicial to the  Purse  than offensive to the  Smell    Being about six Years ago at  Turin  I cur'd a Gentleman of an inveterate Ulcer that encompass'd all the Bottom of the  Vvula  Many Surgeons had to no purpose us'd a great many Remedies And I in like manner after the use of some more with no better Success bethought my self at length of my Anodin Balsam In this I dipt a Linnen Rag ty'd to the end of a Probe and therewith touch'd the Ulcer twice a Day By this Means as I solemnly protest in twelve or fifteen Days the  Vlcer  was compleatly cur'd  This  Remedy  how ancient soever it is will appear new to many However 'tis certain that  Hippocrates  in complicated Fractures us'd little Linnen Rags dipt in  Oyl  and  Wine  mixt together to allay the  Pain  and prevent  Convulsions  which is a  Precedent  sufficient to invite our Imitation  It hath been the Policy of almost all who ever wrote of Medicine still to reserve something undiscover'd to themselves I could name a great number of Authors who have published the Vertues of certain  Remedies    whereof they have never given the  Composition  or if they have it has been in such  Ambiguous  and  Aenigmatical Terms  that it is hard to understand any thing of it And indeed I must acknowledge that a Remedy when it becomes common how good soever it may be loses much of its Esteem  I have formerly said that the Variety of  Constitutions  and Diversity of wounded  Parts  require sometimes a Difference of  Remedies  to this we must have all due Regard For it often falls out that even the most  excellent Medicines  are not capable to answer all our Expectations especially when the  Patient  is of an ill Constitution and the  Distemper  obstinate and troublesome  However it is not good to put too much Confidence in this  single Composition  as if it were an Universal Remedy if at any Time the Success prove not answerable to our Desires I own that I have been oblig'd my self in such Cases to boil in our  Balsam  the  Greater Consound Bugle Sanicle  some  Lavender Clary St John's Wort  and the  Lesser MoonWort  which is a powerful Vulnerary and very common in these Parts and afterwards to give it some Consistence with about a third Part of the  Balsam  of  Arcaeus  This  Composition  has done surprising things it hath consumed and remov'd  Fungusses  from  Feet  that had been intirely  Frozen  and also from  Amputations  which had withstood all other Remedies It procures a good and moderate  Suppuration  eases the  Pain  of  Wounds  in the  Nerves  allays and resolves powerfully fills up with Flesh in a small time in fine an Embrocation therewith cures speedily  Bruises  of all sorts  Altho' I have  these Remedies  in great Esteem and am confirm'd in my Opinion of their Excellency by a multitude of  Experiences  that I have had Yet I don't pretend to lay aside the  Oyntments Cerats  and  Plaisters  of Pharmacy which may be of very great use and are every Day employ'd with Success by very skillful Persons in curing Wounds  This only I will affirm by the way that the most Part of Oyntments have a strong smell that is not only disagreeable to the Wounded but is also no less  hurtful  to the Wounds than offensive to the Smell and very much conduces to render them  putrid sanious  and  Virulent    There are also several Places where they very unadvisedly use  Corrosive Sublimat Arsenick  and other things of a like Nature in the Cure of Wounds not foreseeing their fatal Effects Nevertheless we can't here be too cautious All the Parts of our Body are made up of  Veins Arteries Nerves Lymphatick Vessels  and  Glands  that are easily affected by whatever touches them and that by means of  the  Circulation  convey to the  large Vessels  and the  Original  of the  Nerves  the good or ill Qualities that have been imparted to 'em The  Contagion  that is communicated to the  Sheets  of a  Bed  wherein one that has the  Pox  or  itch  has lain for a Night only will imprint its Characters on a sound Person that after lyes in 'em tho' the impure Matter touch only the  Scarfskin  and is to Appearance much less active than  Arsenic  or  Sublimat    The unfaithfulness us'd in making up certain  Compositions  which I have experienc'd on some Occasions hath oblig'd me to resolve to make up my self some that are more simple and much more Effectual  Etmullerus  in his  Medicinal Surgery  and many others before him have complain'd of the prodigious number of Medicines used in Practice and of the great many  Plaisters Oyntments Cerats  and a thousand other useless things good for nothing but to perplex the Mind of young Surgeons That great  Magazine  of  Pharmacy  might be reduc'd to much narrower Bounds  Experience  has convinc'd me of the truth of this and there are at this time many Persons very expert in Chirurgical Practice that are herein of my Opinion some of whom think that one  Remedy only  may answer all It were well if such a  Method  might be establisht for the good of the Wounded and the Conveniency of Surgery  But I am enclin'd to think that no Man has yet gain'd that  Point  which is extreamly hard to be attain'd because of the  Diversity  of the  Parts  of which we are compos'd and the  Variety  of  Constitutions  in different  Persons  'Tis this Considetation that hinders me to give Credit to that  universal Remedy  which a certain  Modern  otherwise a very able Surgeon and at some distance from these Parts hath endeavour'd to establish But if I am not altogether of this last Opinion I am yet much further from that of the Ancients who have left us such a  Numerous List  of Remedies as can't be either committed to the  Memory  or retain'd therein A great deal of  Study  and diligent  Application  is necessarily requir'd in order to know their  Vertues  and  Properties  For to make the right use of a  Medicine  we must know its  Nature  and  Effects  not abandoning the Success to uncertain Chance and the Fidelity of another as is often done  Moreover it is very hard to believe that all these mighty  Compositions  are answerable in their Effects to the Expectations had of 'em the  numerous  and  differing  Ingredients do oppose alter and destroy one another The most Simple Things are most agreeable and sympathize most with our Nature  I could never yet learn that  Solomon  who had an  Vniversal Knowledge  of all things left behind him for the Cure of  Wounds  Compositions  so perplexing and stuff'd with such a number of  Ingredients  as these which some use at this Day In his time  two  or  three Simples  suffic'd to make a  Balsam  which was nothing inferiour to many others that are now cry'd up as  Infallible Remedies    Balsams  are recommended in the curing of  Wounds  by the most Part of the  Ancients  and almost all the  Moderns  contrary to the Opinion of some that Practise Surgery Enemies to Antiquity who therein act as the  Quacks  do contrary to all manner of  Reason  But an undiscreet  Passion  ought never to prevail over that which is justifyed and supported by  Experience    Tho' I don't approve of Medicines made up of numerous Ingredients yet I have often us'd the  Styptick Plaister  of  Crollius  which tho' it may be accounted of this number ought not at all to be laid aside For when it is faithfully made up it hath  Vertues  too effectual to be neglected and not sought after When I have a Mind to give it a softer Consistence and reduce it to the form of an Oyntment that I may make use of it in dressing of Wounds I melt it with the  Balsam  which I have describ'd and sometimes with the  Oyl  of  St John's Wort  prepar'd with  GumElemy    It will answer all the Expectations may be had of it in curing Wounds and Ulcers It allays Pain cleanses and breeds Flesh those  who will give themselves the trouble to exaamine its  Composition  and  Ingredients  will agree with me that 'tis not impossible but it may have all these  Vertues    I have sometimes us'd and also in this Hospital a  Red Balsam  made with an Ounce of  Red Saunders  and  White Wax  two Ounces of  Venice Turpentine Oyl of Roses  and  Rosewater  and a Dram of  Sal armoniac  all mixt together and hastily boil'd and kept for use It resists  Putrefaction  and lessens  Suppuration    The  Simple digestive  is a Remedy that I commonly use to bring away the Escar in Gunshot Wounds mixing always therewith a little of the  Yolk  of an  Egg  and some  Spirit of Wine  I renew it every Day because it soon corrupts by Reason of the Yolk of the Egg  Turpentine  is a simple Balsam which is excellent for curing of Wounds The Country People about  Brianson  who gather a great quantity thereof from the Wood of the  LarchTree  use nothing else but this  Single Remedy  without any mixture for the Cure of their Wounds Certain it is that they who are accustom'd to mix with it a great number of  Ingredients  and  Catagmatick Powders  spoil its Vertue and can expect nothing from it but bad Succes  Arceus  his  Balsam  us'd in so many Places is not to be despis'd when rightly compos'd But 'tis convenient to remark that it agrees  not to all  Distempers  nor all  Parts  of the Body as was observ'd in the first Remark of this third Part Which I have also experienc'd since in many other Occasions  Basilicon  is one of the most common Oyntments and most us'd I sometimes imploy it to receive the Pouders that I think necessary either to  Irritate  or procure  Suppuration  when I judge it convenient Otherwise I don't much deal with it  It sometimes falls out by the use of  Sarcotick Balsams  that the Flesh grows so fast as to oblige us to consume it and also the Orifices of the  Lymphatick Vessels  oftentimes raise up certain  Protuberances  that together with the superfluous Flesh forms as it were a resemblance of  Mushrooms  which some endeavour to remove with  Cathereticks  but to no purpose  I have observ'd that to touch the  Excrescence  all over with a Dissolution of the  Caustick Stone  is much better than any other means that can be us'd for this Intention providing the Application be renewed so oft as is needful I have in eight or ten Days consumed  Mushrooms  as big as my Fist which the ordinary Powders cou'd not have done in two Months It may be seen in several Places of the second Part of this Book that I have us'd it with a quick and happy Success when there was Occasion to take off the  Callosity  happening to Wounds in order to procure a Reunion  and when these kind of  Protuberances  have but a dull Sense I don't scruple to sprinkle upon them the foresaid Caustick pulveriz'd or to apply  Pledgets  dipt in a Dissolution thereof till I have procur'd such Smoothness as is requisite in order to a laudable  Cicatrix  and have restored the Feeling of the Part  When I only intended to bring to an Equality the luxuriant Flesh and procure a firm and handsom  Scar  I have us'd with good Success  Vnguentum Apostolorum  mix'd with a little  Vnguentum Egyptiacum  This destroys  proud Flesh  and is an excellent Medicine for  Vlcers  to be apply'd before the use of  powerful Sarcoticks  For it quickens the Flesh consumes  superfluous Moisture  and resists  Putrefaction    I have always mightily approv'd the use of the  Spirit of Wine  and have often caus'd dress Wounds of the Extremities with this Remedy only 'Tis true it delays  Suppuration  and protracts the coming away of the  Slough  in  Gunshot Wounds  but it powerfully resists  Putrefaction  corroborates and quickens hinders  Excessive Suppuration  and the  Dissolution  of the  Nerves  to which  putrifying Medicines  are very hurtful  The  Emplastrum Tripharmacum Juberti  made of  Litharge Oyl  and  Vinegar  to which I add a little scrap'd Lint is admirably good to digest a Wound and bring it to Suppuration without occasioning great  Putrefaction  It mightily  dissolves  Contusions  and its use is of great benefit  It is certainly very convenient that a Surgeon have some  peculiar Remedy  the Vertues whereof he is well acquainted with to which he may have recourse in obstinate and troublesom Accidents that sometimes follow upon Wounds and will not yield to the  Common Remedies  It is often also expedient to change the Medicines as I have formerly said and not always to be confin'd to one thing For the Fondness one may have for a  Balsam  or an  Oyntment  that possibly may have done very good Service on many Occasions ought not to prevail so as to make us employ it in all Times and Places The  best  and most  Approv'd Remedies  have not always the same Effects or the same Success For certain it is that not meeting with the same  Constitution  in all Persons 'tis impossible they can have the same  Operations    REFLECTION  I have often observ'd and it daily falls out▪ that  Quacks  who have neither  Skill  nor  Experience  have succeeded in the Curing several Distempers after they were given over by  Profess'd Surgeons  who had bestow'd much time and us'd many Romedies to no purpose But I don't at all think it strange for Those leave  Nature  to her Self in such Occasions and 'tis she only that works these Miracles that are  unjustly attributed to them and give such Repute to their  Remedies    Not but that acting without any Rule they commit very  gross Blunders  being unable with all their  Balsams  to correct overcome yea or foresee the Accidents that often follow upon Wounds For all their Skill extends no further than to the making up of their Remedies and that which can't be cur'd by these passes with them for incurable It is not so with regular Surgeons they know the  Causes  of  Accidents  and apply thereto the necessary  Remedies  without abandoning the  wretched Patient  to his ill  Fate    It is indeed a notable Shame that a wounded Person should go from under their Hands to be cur'd by a  Quack  a  Clown  or a  simple Woman  I have known in several Places such who by the Sale of their Remedies have acquir'd great Reputation whether by the Confidence that wounded People had of the Vertue of their  Balsams  or for a Reason that appear'd very convincing to wit that tho' they neither us'd  Tents  nor  Dilaters  yea in very express terms discharg'd them yet they often succeeded in their  Cures  to the Disgrace of  Surgery  However it must needs be that the Inventers of these  Balsams  did discover some Inconveniences in the use of  Tents  seeing they have altogether forbidden to employ 'em Now I suppose it will easily be believ'd  that these Men or Women who are employed in selling them are not the first Authors and that these who first us'd 'em were not altogether destitute of Knowledge  Diapalma  is one of the Plaisters most commonly us'd in Hospitals of the Army When it is rightly made up and dissolved as was said before it is not to be despis'd And I add to it when the Case requires a little of  Emplastrum de Betonica    Emplastrum divinum Manus Dei Gratia Dei  c are  Plaisters  of a singular Vertue but very seldom to be found made up with all the requsiite Fidelity  I have nothing in particular to say concerning  Cataplasms  according to the ordinary Method It belongs to the prudent  Surgeon  to give them what Form and Qualities he thinks fittest for the present Occasion  I have often faund much more Advantage from the Use of  Emplastrum Tripharmacum  spoken of before and  Diapalma dissolv'd  which don't so much clog the Parts to which they are appply'd nor at all hinder Transpiration  Anodine Cataplasms  such as that of the  Crum of Bread  and others of that Nature are very useful in great  Inflammations  of Wounds after the necessary  Diversions  have been perform'd they allay the Heat of the  Blood  extinguish the Acrimony of  Salts  and relax the  Skin Vnguentum Santalinum  may also be us'd to good  Purpose And when the Pain is partly remov'd I use  Dissolving Medicines  which at first would have encreas'd the  Inflammation  and  Fermentation    Before I put an end to this Discourse I will remark that it is very requisite for a Surgeon of a FieldHospital or of an Army who may sometimes be shut up in a besieged Place ill furnish'd with Medicines for the use of the Wounded to understand how to make up simple and easy Remedies with few Things such as those before mention'd for  Wounds  and these of which I shall afterwards speak for  Vlcers  which in time of need may serve for all  Brandy  which is the ordinary Refuge in want of other Remedies may also be lacking It is the part of a prudent Surgeon wisely to provide for this necessity and to accommodate himself to the time by dressing the wounded  Seldom  and according to our  Method  Thus fewer Medicines shall be us'd a little shall go a great Way and every one shall have Reason to be satisfy'd  A great number of  Abscesses Wounds Vlcers  and  Fractures  of all sorts that have been under our Hands in this Hospital have been cured according to this  Method  wherein there is nothing but what is  Gentle  and  Easy  All the  Amputations  that we have perform'd were drest only once in two or three Days during the whole time of the Cure with our simple  Remedies and that with very good  Success  Those who have been so happy as to avoid the malignant Influence of the Contagious Steams that have so long prevail'd in the  Air  have experienc'd the Comfortableness of this  Method  by the suddenness of their Cure compleated without any  Exfoliation  of the Extremities of the Bones Which infallibly had followed on  Frequent Dressings    I commonly use a  Button of Vitriol  to cauterize the Vessels and stop the  Bleeding  which I ever found successful neither did the Flux of Blood ever return The two  Stitches  with a  Needle  made crosswise upon the  Vein  or  Artery  are very sure this is a common Way which I have sometimes and yet do follow But the Falling of that  Suture  is sometimes so tedious that it exhausts the Patience both of the wounded Person and the Surgeon notwithstanding its use is very safe For the  Bleeding  is less to be fear'd this Way which is quick and gentle than any other The  actual Cautery  is now out of use unless it be in  Amputations  perform'd on the  Dead    Tho' in the Cures of the  Penetrating Wounds  of the  Thorax  spoken of in my second Part I was not oblig'd to perform the  Operation  of the  Empyema  yet I have had Occasion to use it on many other wounded Persons since I embrac'd this  Method  For take what Way or what Care you will it is oftentimes absolutely  necessary When the Cavity of the Breast is full of Blood and the Orifice of the Wound high it is not then safe to attempt to empty it by the way of  Vrine  which might be too slow and is too uncertain but we must without delay fall about the  Operation    I will not here describe the Manner of performing this or other  Operations M Verduc  and  M Chariere  have lately afforded sufficient Means of Instruction in this Affair This I will only say on the Subject in hand that this  Operation  ought always to be perform'd on that Side where the Effusion of the Blood is and if it is found to have been on both Sides and one  Opening  does not give the Ease that is expected tho' the  extravasated Blood  is discharg'd we must make an  Opening  also on the other Side after the first is carefully clos'd up and the Patient has had some time allow'd to recover his Strength Sometimes I am oblig'd to use  Tents  for the first Day left the Division of the  Pleura  that was but newly made should unite again and so there would be a necessity of a new Operation the next Day to let out that  Blood  which being coagulated could not at first be brought away and can hardly be evacuated by any other Means As for these  Openings  made in the Body by  Bullets  in Gunshot Wounds there is no need of  Tents  to keep them open for they cannot be clos'd up till the  Escar  is separated  I have already said that in  Openings  which I make to evacuate the  Collections  of Matter or  Abscesses  in the  Thorax  ocasion'd by a  Pleuresy  or  Peripneumonia  I use  Tents  without a  Point  in the first Days to keep the  Matter  from coming out all at once Otherwise the Place that was possest by the  Matter  wou'd soon be fill'd with  Air  which being ever colder than the inward Parts of the Body might occasion  Coagulations Suffocations  and  Swoonings  Moreover when a great deal of  Blood  is extravasated it must also be let out by Degrees Now in such Occasions  Tents  are necessary But these being once over I lay them aside for good and all that a free Passage may be given to the  Matter  that the Generation of a Callosity about the Sides of the  Opening  may be prevented and that nothing may be left to hinder the Reunion  By this  Method  the wretched Patient is delivered from a great deal of  Trouble Pain  and  Vexation  being enabled thereby to enjoy a Repose which otherwise he could never have expected And by seeing him thus from  Pain  what inumerable Accidents are avoided  Had not Charity and Patience prevail'd in this Place and restrain'd us from cutting off without further delay Members that were only gangren'd by an Extremity of Cold as other Surgeons of Hospitals have done this of  Brianson  wou'd have been full of Invalids For about the End of the Campain in the Years and a great number of sick Persons were brought thither from  Pignerol  and  O  lx  who in passing the Mountain  Genévre  were in such manner seiz'd and penetrated with the Cold in the Extremities of the Body that a total  Loss  of Sense and also a  Gangrene  did ensue the most part of whom notwithstanding were cur'd without  Amputation  those only excepted that had been before worn out with long  Sickness    CHAP VIII Of Gunshot Wounds  SEing  Wounds  are the Principal Subject of this little Treatise it was not fitting that those inflicted by  FireArms  should here be forgotten Wherefore I shall say something of them in this Chapter  Gunshot Wounds  are acknowledged by all to be very troublesome because of the  Tearing  and of the  Disordering  the Flesh occasion'd by the  Bullet  the  Stop  put to the  Circulation  so far as they reach the  Havock  that attends them and the  Obstructions  they occasion all which are but too too able to produce very  grievous Accidents  Fluxions Mortifications  and  Gangrenes  are here very much to be feared to prevent which I at first give Breathing to the Wound with pretty large and deep  Incisions  according as the Nature of the Part and bigness of the Wound do require I do my utmost to draw out the  Extraneous Bodies  if there are any putting the Wounded Person in the same  Posture  wherein he received the Wound Afterwards I dress it according to my Method and seasonably perform the requisite Diversions A  Flux  of  Blood  is almost never to be fear'd till the Escar be fallen unless some great Vessel be wounded  Nevertheless I can truly affirm that there never happened any Flux of Blood in Gunshot Wounds since I laid aside the use of  Tents  for according as the Escar is dissolv'd and comes away a  new Flesh  is bred without any hindrance and covers the Wounded Ves  els which can't be when it is prest by Tents This is a Truth so evident that I hope no Man will call it in Question  Diet  ought always to be rightly order'd and if notwithstanding all our Care and Precaution dangerous Symptoms do follow we must endeavour to ease and relieve the Part by making many  Scarifications  thereon in order to give a Vent to the  extravasated Blood  and to hinder its  Stay  and  Fermentation  But seeing the most part of the Accidents that  happen are more or less troublesom according to the different Bigness of the  Contusion  I do what I can to dissolve it as soon as possible and to restore the  Humours  to their usual Motion For according to the Definition we have laid down in our first Part  A  Contusion  is a Disorder of the  Fibers  and  little Vessels  that changes the Regularity and Situation of the Pores  but this is often accompany'd with an  Effusion  or Extravasating of  Blood  which pressing upon the  Vessels  hinders the Course and Motion of the  Humors  and  Spirits  The  Accidents  that follow in this last Case are much more troublesom wherefore without expecting the Effects of dissolving Medicines I forthwith have recourse to  Scarification  for  Mortifications  often times surprize of a sudden however seeing things come not always to this Pass I sometimes use  Dissolving Medicines    We have known a very warm  Embrocation  with  Oyl  of  Roses  to which was added a little of that of  Turpentine  and some  Spirit  of  Wine  produce exceeding good Effects it begins the  Dissolution  relaxes the  Skin  and disposes the Part to receive afterwards the Impression of the Plaisters such as the  Tripharmacum Juberti Diapalma  dissolv'd as we have ordered fresh  Cowdung  fry'd with Volatil Salts as also that of other Animals the Roots of  Briony  infus'd in  Spirit  of  Wine  are in this Case very proper  Dissolving▪ Cataplasms  are sometimes very seasonable providing they be not too emplastick and if in spite of all our Care a  Gangrene  should follow we must use these Remedies which were describ'd under that Head But this Accident never yet fell out in any of these Wounds whereof we had the first Dressing and I can aver that tho'  simple Gunshot Wounds  are drest in this Hospital as  Excoriations  only yet are they always cur'd with a surprizing Quickness Nevertheless we perform all the necessary Diversions The Remedies we us'd may be seen in the Relation of the Cures  CHAP IX Of Burns  THE  Accidents  occasion'd by  Gunpowder  might afford us Subject of much Discourse upon  Burn  But I design only to speak a Word or two thereof that I may thence have Occasion to point forth the  Remedies  I use in their Cure  The  Tallow  of which they make Candles melted with the  Oyl  of  Walnuts  to the Consistence of an Oyntment will answer to all the Intentions propos'd in this Matter I have not found any thing either so effectual or so  easie it will terminate the  Empyeme  and cures generally all sorts of  Burns  whatever in very short time In fine this is the Remedy which we ordinarily use  Benjamin Vnguentum Populeum  and the  Yolks of Eggs  may be us'd when this can't be had There are but very few Surgeons who have not always some  particular Remedy  for  Burnings  some more some less effectual  Etmullerus  and other Authors have given a great number of very good ones and  M Verduc  in his  Pathology  explains their  Nature  and their  Differences  in a very clear and unintelligible way  A little time after the Declaration of War an Accident happen'd in the Valleys of  Luserne  which afforded us many frightful Spectacles The Guardhouse of the  Fort  of  Tour  call'd  St Maries  fell down upon about thirty Soldiers as they were warming themselves about a great Fire of whom twenty or thereabouts were buried with the Ruines in the Chimney by the Fire A good deal of Time was spent before they could clear away the Stones and the Rubbish and get out these poor wretched Creatures Some were found dead and roasted others were brought into the Hospital of  Luserne  A Plaister as big as a Bedsheet was scarcely sufficient to dress them Two or three dy'd and five or six were cur'd by the assistance of  Cordials Diaphoreticks  and  absorbing  Medicines  taken inwardly to facilitate the opening of Obstructions while outwardly the most proper  Oyntments  were us'd to allay the Pain and dissipate the corrupt Matter to which I caus'd add a little  Camphire  and some  Yolks  of  Eggs  mixt together To conclude after very frightful Suppurations the Cure was compleated but they were for the most part like so many Serpents all oblig'd to change their  Skin    CHAP X Of Ulcers  ETmullerus  is of Opinion that the Cause of  Vlcers  proceeds from an  Acid  whereby the immediate Nourishment distributed to the Part is corrupted and losing its Oyly and Balsamick Nature becomes sour and altogether unfriendly to the Part that it ought to nourish and so considerably encreases the  acid Ferment  and augments its Activity  According to this Definition a  Topical Remedy  well accommodated to the Kind of the Disease and that destroys  Acids  and repairs the Balsamick Nature of the  Nutricious Juice  if sufficient to bring this sort of Distemper to a perfect Cure I have often in this manner  cured many poor afflicted Creatures without the use of  General Remedies  But not to make any change in the manner of Dressing I say in the first Place that  Vlcers  are but too common in the Hospitals of the Army Tbe  ill Dyet  of the Soldiers their  Irregularities  their  Fatigues  and their unavoidable  Nastiness  are more than enough to occasion such as are very obstinate and difficult to be cur'd Secondly we have in  this Hospital  followed a  Method  whereby in a little time a great number of  Vlcers  were cur'd For after  General Remedies  and some slight  Diversions  I us'd a Decoction of  Walnut  Leaves with a little  Sugar  in this I dipt  Pledgets  which I apply'd moderately hot letting often three Days pass over without taking off that Dressing  Many Persons in  France  I know have kept this  Composition  as a great Secret but I thought it wou'd have been inconsistent with  Charity  not to publish its Vertues and the manner of making it  I have experienc'd on a thousand Occasions that it mightily  cleanses  and  breeds Flesh  mortifies and devours it  Acidities  resists  Putrefaction  removes plentiful  Suppurations  and consumes the  Moisture  that hinders  Reunion  In fine it hath Vertues that surpass Belief and its Effect is more quick than that of all the  Oyntments  and  Cerats  with which Apothecaries Shops are stor'd and which are commonly us'd  in curing of  Vlcers  but often to no purpose In the mean time I dare affirm and that truely that in the Places where I have us'd it all these  Vlcers  that were formerly thought  Incurable  were thereby ended in a very short time  Tho' I do but very seldom make any use of  Injections  nevertheless I have been sometimes oblig'd to have recourse to this Remedy from which I have reap'd more advantage then from all those us'd in Practice and especially in  hollow  and  deep Vlcers  As also in  large Abscesses  of fleshy Parts where there is great Putrefaction and sometimes a considerable Cavity  The  Scriptural Balsam  spoken of before which is only an equal Quantity of  Oyl  and  Wine  boil'd to the consumption of the latter is also an excellent Medicine for  Vlcers  With this Remedy only I have cur'd great numbers  Many  Authors  there are who have left us an Account of a vast number of  Remedies  which are us'd in  Hospitals  for which Reason I will say nothing of them here where my Design is only to make known those I use in my own Practice  By what I have said of the seldom dressing of  Wounds  it may be easily guess'd that I am not for frequent Dressing of  Vlcers  For if they proceed from an  Acid  as  Etmullerus  thinks  we ought to endeavour not to promote the Coagulation by admitting the  Acid  of the  Air  which by insinuating its pointed Articles into  Vlcers  corroborates the Cause renders them putrid sanious and sometimes incurable  'Tis not without ground that  Galen  as hath been declar'd already in the first Part in his  Fourth Book of the Composition of Medicines Chap  hath ordered to dress  Vlcers  but once in three Days And I believe that it wou'd yet be better to do it more seldom unless some urgent Cause require it such as the Season of the Year the badness of the Humors or some other evil Disposition of Body  We may observe that Suppurative Medicines us'd in dressing  Vlcers  are extremely pernicious For the  Matter  is but too plentiful and requires to be lessened and dry'd up if we desire a perfect Cure The Application of  Topical Remedies  when well chosen oftentimes performs in this Case what neither  Diversions  nor  Internal Medicines  cou'd do and of such there are good store But it depends only on the  Prudence  and  Skill  of him that prescribes 'em to use them seasonably for we can expect no  desireable Effects  either from one kind or another but according as they are  properly  apply'd  Vnguentum Apostolorum  mix'd with  Vnguentum Egyptiacum  is not to be despis'd It consumes  all the corrupted and the Superfluous Flesh I have often apply'd this before I made use of our  Lotion    The  Aqua Phagaedenica  or  Limewater  mixt with  Salt of Lead  or  Sal Armoniac  and  Aqua Coelestis  have also serv'd us on such Occasions for if one Remedy fails as often falls out we must have Recourse to another  CHAP XI Of Simple Fractures  IN the Cure of  Simple Fractures  commonly four things are propos'd to be done First to set the Bone or bring it to its natural Figure Secondly to keep it so with fit Dressings Thirdly to take care of the neighbouring Parts And fourthly to give the afflicted Member a convenient Posture  First then  Extension  is almost ever necessary to reduce the  Bone  to its natural State which is to be more or less vigorous according to the  Quality  of the  Fracture  the  Nature  of the  Broken Part  or the  Age  and  Sex  of the Patient but we must observe not to make Extension when  Inflammation  or other  Accidents  appear till they are either remov'd or considerably abated  As to the second thing which is the  necessary Dressings  I have always observ'd the Direction of  Hippocrates  in using  three Bands  as he did in  simple Fractures Celsus  employed six but these in my Opinion were too many for the Part wherefore I chus'd rather to follow the Practice of  Hippocrates  approv'd of by  Galen  in the  Fifth Chapter  of his  Book  of  Method    The most Part of those who practise  Surgery  differ in the Use of Topical Remedies Some apply all  Dry  As for my self who am not confin'd to the  Way  of the  Ancients  in this Matter I have found that the  Glair  and  Yolk  of an  Egg  beat up together with a little  Oyl of Roses  will answer all Expectations It is  Astringent Anodine  and  Dissolving  The rest of the  Dressings  I use dry unless an  Inflammation  or some such thing oblige me to the contrary For as it is my Way to dress my Patient as seldom as possible I apply the Bandage dry that it may be the faster and less apt to slacken  Plaisters  and  Emplastick Medicines  employ'd in  Fractures  stop up the  Pores  of the  Skin  keep in the  Vapours  that occasion  Itching  and so oblige to take off the  Dressings  oftner than is expedient wherefore I endeavour to avoid whatever may cause that Accident  Hippocrates  used to take off the  Dressings  three Days after Application Many stay till  the seventh and for my self I delay it as long as ever I can Experience has taught me that it is most advantageous for the Patient not to be dress'd till the  Callus  is intirely form'd unless the Bands are loosen'd or some unexpected Accident hath fallen out such as  Itching  and Disordering of the reduced Bones I could recount a great number of Soldiers that have departed from this  Hospital  cur'd of  Simple Fractures  of all sorts according to my  Method  but I shall content my self with the Relation of the following  Cure    A Soldier call'd  La Tulippe  of the Regiment of  Conde  was brought to this Place having his right  Thighbone  broken about the middle and shattered This unlucky Accident befell him as he was sleeping upon  Mount Genévre  under a Tree which at the same time was cut down and fell upon his  Thigh  So soon as he was committed to my Care I reduc'd the Bone by a vigerous Extension and apply'd a linnen Cloth dipt in an entire  Egg  beat up with a little  Oyl of Roses  and a small quantity of good  Vinegar  upon which I put some  Compresses  then three or four pretty long  Rollers  with some  Splents  of Pastboard encompassing all with a Piece of the same and last of all the  Juncks  with what belongs to 'em  Diversions  were perform'd and a moderat  Diet  ordered I let the  Dressings  stay on for twenty  Days at the end of which time I found the Part in its right and natural Disposition At this Dressing I us'd  Emplastrum pro fracturis  and apply'd the  Bandage  as before with  Splints  of Wood and the other things necessary In twenty Days after I took off the Dressings a second time and found all things to my Satisfaction and Twenty Days more pass'd before I look'd to it again so that in sixty Days I drest him only three times not reckoning the first He began now to rise and to walk on Crutches and we continu'd still the Dressings upon his  Thigh  omitting the  Junks  In fine after he had remain'd sometime in the Hospital to recover his Strength he return'd to his Regiment  'Tis convenient to observe that in  Simple Fractures  of the  Thigh  we ought always to use on the hinder part a  Splent  of the breadth of two or three Fingers to sustain the Bone which without this Precaution would be in Danger to bend in Hospitals of the Army where the loose Straw on which the Soldiers lie is apt to slip from under them and so to make Holes or Furrows capable to disorder the joyning of the broken Parts unless they be supported by some thing that is sufficiently stiff  I have no Credit to give to the inward Remedies which some use for breeding a  Callus  ▪ such as the Juice of  Cowslip  of  Agrimony  or its  Root  taken in Drink and many others to be seen in ancient Authors  Nature  is the Architect and principal Framer of the  Callus  when she is allow'd that  Repose  which is necessary to her Acting however I don't disapprove the use of incrassating Nourishment on such Occasions  In the third Place as to the  Care of the neghbouring Parts  when the  Fracture  is much shatter'd and very painful it is exceeding advantagious to apply  Defensives  to the  Superior Parts  and the  Emunctories  the Liniment made of an  Egg  beat up with  Oyl  of  Roses  and sometimes with a little of that of  Turpentine  and some  Vinegar  when the  Contusion  is great answers also to this Intention together with Embrocations with dissolving Oyls Above all  Diversions  are of great Efficacy to prevent and remove  Accidents    As for the fourth Thing it is of great Importance to the fractur'd Member to be plac'd in a  convenient Situation  upon which very often depends the good or ill Success of the Cure In  Hospitals  of the  Army  all the necessary Conveniences are not to be found but the  Ingenuity  of the  Surgeon  ought to make up that Defect The greatest Part of the Wounded are only laid upon  Straw  which has not Stability enough to keep a Member  long in the same Situation 'tis this Consideration that obliges me after applying the three Bands spoken of above to use  Splents  in the first Dressing unless the Pain engage me to defer 'em and afterward I make all sure with a fourth Band I add also the  Juncks  and the  Sole  with what belongs to 'em if the  Fracture  is in the  Thighs  or  Legs  if in the  Arm  I use the  Sling  as also if in the  ForeArm  the Case of Pastboard all being well ty'd on secures the Part in such sort that there is no hazard of its being disorder'd This is the Method I use in  Simple Fractures    CHAP XII Of Compound Fractures  COmplicated Fractures  are very hard to be cur'd In the second Part of this Treatise may be seen the manner how a good number of such were brought to a perfect  Cure  But we must not always flatter our selves with Expectations of the like good Success chiefly when part of the  Substance  of the  Bone  is lost The  Youth  and  good Constitution  of the Patient are great Helps in such Occasions The  Method  of  Dressing Gently Speedily  and  Seldom  saves a great deal of  Time  and prevents very many  Accidents Nature  when at Liberty and acting without Restraint does things very surprising and such as we wou'd have judg'd to be impossible  The  Generation  of a  Callus  in a  Simple Fracture  is undoubtedly more speedy than in a complicated one In the first the  Heat  is kept in and united and acts with more Strength and Quickness The Bone being covered by the  Teguments  is shelter'd from the injuries of the  Air  For according to  Fabricius ab Aquapendente Part    Bo    Chap  the  external Air  alters the  Bones  and destroys their  Natural Temperament  More over  Nature  is not diverted nor disturb'd in her Action by  Dissipations  or  Suppurations  All consists in the Reducing of the  Fracture  or rightly  Setting  the  Bone  as we have taught in the former Chapter  From these Reasons a Consequence may be drawn to justify my  Method  in respect of  Complicated Fractures  For by Suppressing  frequent Dressing  and giving all Diligence to hinder the  Access  of the  Air  to such Wounds I prevent all the  Accidents  it might occasion as great  Suppurations Alterations Rottenness Fluxions Pains  and generally whatever prolongs the  Cure  and often makes the Wounds incurable  In  Complicated Fractures  when there is great  Suppuration  the  Matter  must undoubtedly be mixt with the  Nutricious Juice  of the Bones which from the first Moment of the  Fracture  begins to cover the Ends of the Bone and form a  Callus Tents  and  Dilaters  with which commonly these sorts of Wounds are fill'd by their Touch hinder this Work which ought not to by interrupted  Long  and  frequent Dressings  give time for the  Air  to penetrate into the Wounds whereby the  Nourishment  of the  Bone  loses what was spirituous in it coagulates breeds obstructions or is turn'd into  Matter  Moreover this  Method  not only occasions always  Irritations  and  Pains  but also deprives the Sick of that  Rest  which is absolutely necessary to 'em  Fabricius ab Aquapendente  in the  eighth Chapter  of the same Book treating of  Complicated Fractures  where the  Bone  is  not uncovered  Orders the Lips of the Wound to be joyn'd together and that it be drest but once in three Days And in the  tenth Chapter  of the same  Book  speaking of  Complicated Fractures  where the  Bone  is  laid bare  directs to Joyn the Lips of the Wound by  Stitching  or otherwise and afterwards to go on with the Cure as in a  Simple Wound    I am not therefore the only Person that has drest  complicated Fractures  after this Manner It may be observ'd also that  Rhasis  and  Serapion  us'd this  Method  in the Cure of  Wounds  of the  Head  with a  Fracture  of the  Scull  for they say that  Wounds  of the  Head  must be stitch'd up even where the  Scull  is broken quite thorow  If this may be done on such Occasions much more in complicated Fractures of other parts of the Body now the Stitching us'd by these Authors in  Fractures  of the  Scull  was for no other End but to exclude the  Air  which might have prov'd hurtful to the  Brain  the  Membranes  and the  Scull    Galen  and  Avicen  advise Stitching in such a Case but  Hippocrates  forbids it in his Book  of Wounds  of the  Head  For my self I very rarely use it in any part of the Body tho' I don't disapprove it But in  Gunshot Wounds  it can't be practis'd for many Reasons known to every Body  Fractures  with a  Wound  are in general very troublesom But these caus'd by FireArms more than others and they are also more or less hard to cure according to the  Part  wherein they are For the  Complicated Fractures  of the  Thigh  which we have had under our Care in this Hospital were not so soon cur'd as those of the  Leg  nor these as the  Fractures  of the  Arm  and so of others tho' in all the same  Method  was always follow'd  As to the difficulty of curing those of the  Thighs  it is often occasion'd by the Inconveniences to be met with in the Hospitals of the Army For there is difficulty in giving  Clysters  there where we cannot afford the Accommodations necessary for voiding the Excrements because wanting ordinarly Servants handy and charitable enough to assist the Patients in such Occasions they ly in their Nastiness and are indiscreetly and violently mov'd by which means the Cures become tedious and difficult For we may be sure that  Nature  acts with no less Diligence and Wisdom upon  these  than upon other  Parts    I make no question but many Persons will condemn this Way of dressing  complicated  Fractures  which possibly will appear to be very new For I own I never hitherto saw it us'd by any But we ought not to be too forward to affirm that what we have not seen is not There are without doubt many Secrets both in  Nature  and in  Arts  which wou'd be of notable advantage were they known to us  Those who will give themselves the Trouble exactly to follow this  Method  may extricate themselves from the Errors with which their Minds were prepossess'd against it  CHAP XIII Of Dislocations  'TIS in the Cure of  Dislocations  that  Art  has the Advantage over  Nature  because  that  alone accomplishes the Cure without the Assistance of  this  the  Operation  of the  Hand Machines  and  Bands  are the Means that  Surgery  imploys to reduce them  Tho' this Subject would afford an ample Field to Theory yet I shall remit the young Surgeons to such  Authors  as have designedly treated thereon I will only say that it is necessary to be throughly instructed in the Knowledge of the  Bones  and  Bandages  and that if possible we must not lose one Minute of time to restore the Parts that are dislocated before the  Accidents  supervene that oftentimes hinders the  Operation  For the  Head  of the  Bone  that is out of its Place commonly presses on nervous and sensible Parts and sometimes squeeses together the Vessels that carry the Blood for the Nourishment of the Parts which occasions a kind of  Palsy  and  Atrophy  and sometimes a  Fluxion  Moreover the Cavity of the receiving Bone may be fill'd  with the  Synovia  or Humor that moistens the Joynts which if it be coagulated there by some Acid will hinder the Head of the Bone to go into that Place from whence it came out in which case we may reckon the Restoring of the Bone to be impossible Wherefore we ought at first to employ all our Care to procure its Reduction  The Instruments necessary to reduce  Old Luxations  or such  new  ones as require great Force are not all to be found always in Hospitals of the Army but the Hand of Servants and the Ingenuity of the Operator ought to make up that want as much as possible  Guy de Chauli  e Fabricius ab Aquapendente Pareus  and many others have sufficiently explained the manner of  Reducing Dislocations  A  young Surgeon  ought to omit nothing that may conduce to his Accomplishment herein For it is by these simple  Operations  that the Vulgar knows to discern the Skilful from the Ignorant because these sorts of Performances are altogether Chirurgical and require only the Dexterity of the Artist to accomplish 'em  I have found by Experience that an  Egg  beaten up with  Oyl  of  Turpentine  and a little  Vinegar  is very profitable to the luxated Parts to which it is apply'd yea that it is a Remedy sufficient to answer all Intentions  Aromatick  Wine may be us'd when this can't be had If your design is only to strengthen the Plaister  Pro Fracturis  will do the Business  Bleeding Clysters  and a convenient Course of  Diet  ought not to be neglected in great  Luxations  attended with  Contusion  These sorts of Remedies oftentimes prevent being surpriz'd with Accidents and remove them when present  CHAP XIV Of the Relaxation of the Joynts  SOldiers who commonly ly on the  Ground  during the  Campain  in very severe Seasons are lyable to have their Bodies stuff'd with superfluous Humors wherewith all the Parts in general are soak'd but in a special manner they very often fall upon the  Joynts  where softning and relaxing the Ligaments that kept them fast they do thereby occasion  Luxations  of the Parts  This kind of  Distemper  is very hard to be cur'd and will scarcely yield to  Remedies  we have had of them under our Hands in this Hospital which have occasion'd us a great deal of Trouble and but little Credit  Hippocrates  in such Cases advises the use of the  actual  Cautery  and  Galen  after him is also for the same Operation in order to drain and consume the slimy and watery  Humours  to strengthen the  Skin  and to fasten and fortifie the  Joint    Hippocrates  for this purpose uses a Rope of raw  Flax  which being set on fire yields a Coal like that of the Match us'd in Armies and  Aetius  according to  Archigens  did it with the Root of  FullersWeed  and of  Birthwort  probably to render the Operation more gentle it is perform'd upon the Place where the Head of the Bone bunches out  This  Remedy  is rude and we have never us'd it in this Hospital because it frightens the Patient Nevertheless these Distempers are somtimes so painful and withal so obstinate that those who are under 'em willingly submit to the most cruel  Operations  that they may be released therefrom  Fabricius ab Aquapendente  relates that after he had in such a Case to no purpose us'd very many things the Patient was cur'd with a Plaister of a certain Herb which he believ'd was  HeartsEase  that was apply'd to him by a Quack  As for my self tho' I don't disapprove the Way us'd by the Ancients in this Case yet I am of Opinion that it ought not to take Place till more gentle Methods are first try'd And this is the course we use to take at first trying  whatevet may heat cut dry and strengthen The  Oyl  of  Lavender  the  Fat  of the  MountainRat  and  Spirit of Wine  or the  Queen of Hungaries Water  made up in form of a Liniment and apply'd very warm give great Assistance in such Cases to which may be added a little of the  Oyl  of  Turpentine  which cuts and opens the Passages so making way for  Dissolving  and  Drying  Medicines  But when I find these Remedies ineffectual I use such things as irritate  Vesicatories  and caustick Herbs such as  Spurge Celandine  and the like which by the exasperation of the Pain may cause a Fluxion upon the Part affected that so the matter being after digested and ripened by a Fermentation all may be happily ended by an  Abscess  as sometimes fails out  When we have brought things to this Pass we must not fail without delay to restore the  Bones  into their  Cavity  and to fortify the Joynt with good  Aromatick Wines  quickened with  Spirit  of  Wine  or else with  Man's Grease  and a little of the  Queen of Hungaries Water  mixt and apply'd hot and generally we may for this purpose use any thing that may  strenghthen  the  Member  and  wast  the  Moisture  In the mean time the Part must always be supported with a good  Bandage  and surrounded with Compresses and Bolsters to command the Bone and  keep it fast in its Place moreover the Patient must be very careful to keep himself quiet and must observe a  Drying  and  Attenuating  Course of  Diet    CHAP XV The Conclusion of the Third Part with some very useful  Remarks    MY principal Design in this little Treatise being to introduce for the Relief of  Wounded Persons  a  Gentle Speedy  and  Easie Way  of curing their Distempers I have endeavoured to confirm the same as much as lay in my Power by  Reasons  and  Experienees  I am not ignorant that this  Part  of  Surgery  which concerns Wounds does not exhaust its Bounds and that I have only slightly touch'd on other Things that are of no less Importance  My Intention was not to transcribe from other  Authors  and therefore I thought it enough superficially only to declare my Thoughts of the other Parts of  Surgery  wherein also I have confin'd my self to that which is most common and most necessary and was withall most particulurly known to me  not being willing to speak of many Things about which I had nothing new to advance I think I have done what I design'd and am ambitious of nothing else but that my  Intention  which I have sincerely declar'd may have all the  Success  I cou'd wish it  The Course I take to prevent the  Scaling  of  Bones  explained in the first Part of this Book I learnt from  Experience  I hope also it will be found very useful and necessary in dressing  Wounds  where the  Bone  is  uncovered    I drew also from the same Fountain the manner of Dressing after the  Operation  of the  Trepan  and yet I doubt not but it will have the Fate to be condemn'd as new However I will not spend Time in anticipating the Objections of others by answering them before hand For whatever might be said in commendation of the  Plate  which was never us'd by any before me wou'd only prove an Inducement to excite the Criticks to decry it  Experience  and  Reading  have inform'd me that the  Air  is a mighty  Hinderance  to the  Cure  of Wounds and I have endeavoured to find out an easy Way to hinder its  Access  especially in Wounds where the  Scull  is cut For 'tis evident that the most part of the  Accidents  that attend such Wounds are occasion'd only through the little Care taken to keep off the Assaults of the  Air  which are promoted by  the Custom of  long  and  frequent  Dressings  I have seen  Surgeons  spend whole Hours in dressing  Wounds  of the  Head  accompany'd with a  Fracture  of the  Scull  to loosen break or cut off the  Splinters  or some  Piece  of the Bone which ought never to be done unless we are very well assur'd that they prick the  Dura Mater    There are many who think they have spect well if at each  Dressing  they can but extract some little Bit of broken Bone which they carefully preserve to shew to all that come thinking thereby to gain Credit and to raise their  Reputaeiou  by that which ought to be condemn'd and often costs the Wounded Person his Life  A very  famous Officer  not long ago experienc'd the fatal Effects of this  cruel Method  for having had his  Scull  broken by a  Bullet  whereby he was in a manner trepann'd without hurting the  Brain  or its  Membraues  or occasioning any dangerous Symptom some Time was unadvisedly spent twice a Day in loosening and pulling away forcibly little  Portions  of the  Bone  which  Nature  wou'd easily have separated supposing that afterwards which yet was impossible they might chance to prick the  Dura Mater  by this Method the  Dura Mater  and the  Brain  were  altered  and visibly  mortify'd  so that he dy'd on the Eleventh  Day of his Wound I was indeed call'd to give my Advice after his Condition was desperate but all I could do in this Case was to give him notice of his approaching  Death    Many  Surgeons  in a vain Ostentation spend all their  Life  and exhaust their  Diligence  in unravelling all the Secrets of the new Discoveries in Physick and in qualifying themselves to discourse accurately thereon contemning all the Opinions of the Ancients while in the mean time they remain in an intire Ignorance of the  Practice  notwithstanding all their  Science  If these  Men  were as desirous to be knowing as ambitious to appear so they would take another Course And not confining themselves only to  Reasonning  and to shew their  Wit  in  Consultations  neglect to improve a  good Method    It is not enough to understand the  Nature  and  Difference  of  Wounds  and to know the cause of  Accidents  that besall them nor yet quaintly to explain 'em by  Reasons  purely  Speculative  and  Chymerical  We must joyn to the  Theory  that is indeed very useful and necessary a  Method  of  Curing  and  Rooting out  Distempers which is to be look'd on as the most necessary Part of  Surgery  But it is rare for those who addict themselves wholly to  Reasonning  to have such regard for  Practice  as to acquire it to Perfection and to abandon  their own Maxims to follow others that are contrary to 'em Wherefore I have address'd this little Discourse to  young Surgeons  who may possible reap some Advantage from it not being uncapable of the good Impressions one desires to make upon 'em  I am not desirous that the  Newness  of this  Method  should either engage them to follow it or oblige 'em to reject it but only wish that they may put it to a  Tryal  in order to make a true Judgement For every reasonable Man ought wisely to inform himself of the Truth of Things and to examine their Consequences before he positively give his Judgment Nothing is more Easy for one than to  Pass  a  Verdict  and nothing more Difficult than to  Judge aright    I am convinc'd by Experience that it is dangerous to credit the Testimony of others The wrong Judgment made on a  Wound  that one of our most famous  Generals  receiv'd  October  being the Day of the  Fight  of  Marseils  and my Easiness to rely on the Fidelity of another and on the Report made to me the Day after the first Dressing thereof had almost cost him his  Life  The  Wound  was deep and made by a large  Bullet  and was drest at first as if it had been only a simple one with a great quantity of Lint whereof a Part was lost and fix'd in the Depth of the  Wound However it happen'd very fortunately that it was driven out by the  Matter  but it left behind it in the Place where it was hid a considerable Mortification which gave occasion to make great and deep  Incisions  whereby a  Fracture  was discovered Prudence hinders me to declare at more length the Circumstances that accompany'd this Cure to which  M Dalibour  MasterSurgeon sworn at  Paris  and Surgeon Major of the  Horse of the Houshold  an able and experienc'd Man was called to give his Advice In a Word after many  Accidents  all was brought to a happy Conclusion  It is therefore absolutely necessary for a  Surgeon  who is careful of his Reputation to search the Wounds himself which were not drest by him at first in order to discover their Nature and know their Extent This was not the only Person who in the Day of that Fight experienc'd the Inconveniency of being dress'd at first in a Hurry I have for good Reasons not mention'd several other Cases not much differing from the former that occur'd in the same Occasion wherein there were many dress'd in that Quarter that was assign'd to the Body of Reserve belonging to our Army  In this Book and particularly in the second Part thereof may be seen after what  manner I have brought to a perfect Cure a  great number of Wounds  of all  Kinds  and  Qualities  with much  Ease  small  Charge  and with simple  Remedies  which are no less useful to the Rich than convenient for the Poor  The great Charges ordinarly laid out upon the Cure of Wounds sometimes involve the Patient after that cure is perfected in Evils no less troublesom than the former The  Wounds  are fill'd and clos'd up but the  Pockets  are opened and drain'd That Person of whom I spoke in the  twenty fifth Chapter  of the  Second Part  before he came under my Care had a Bill of  Three hundred and seventy six Livers  brought him by the Apothecary for Medicines furnish'd by him when yet after all that Expence there was no Appearance of a Cure  The Credit of a  Surgeon  does not consist in emptying the  Shops  to cure his  Patients  On the contrary we ought rather Christian like to be saving of the Money of those who put their very  Person  and  Life  in our Hands And if they chance to prove so ungrateful as to deny us what we have deserv'd after such a good Deed we may expect our  Reward  from  Heaven  We ought not to be brib'd by the consideration of a  Mean Interest  to abandon the Fidelity wherewith we ought to endeavour the Speedy Cure of our Patients  If a Patient is destroy'd by unexpected Accidents when the Cure is delay'd on a mercenary Account the Surgeon under whose Care he was becomes guilty of his Death  I have seen many Persons of Note whom I won't name who passing through  Brianson  eight or nine Months after the Battel of  Marseils  wherein they had been wounded were either fistulous or very far from being compleatly cur'd  Nevertheless that I may not rashly blame those who had these Persons under their Care I am willing to believe that the  Tenderness  of their  Constitution  their  ill Temperament  or the  unwholsom Air  which very much conduces to continue the Wounds occasion'd that Tediousness of these Cures which in other Persons and Circumstances had been perfectly finish'd in two or three Months at most but I can't restrain my self from saying that the  Tents  as well as the frequent and painful Way of Dressing so much in Use are sufficient to cause all these  Accidents  and to hinder the Cure of Wounds and this is what makes  Surgeons  hated and  Surgery  chargeable  In this little Work I have done what I cou'd to shew not so much by Reasoning as  Examples  and  Authority  that  Nature  has the greatest Hand in  curing Wounds  or to speak  more truly that she is the principal Worker therein But I leave it to the performance of more delicate Pens to celebrate her Praises and publish her Excellencies contenting my self to admire her Wonders which are no less unaccountable than they are surprizing  The  Year  afforded me an Occasion wherein it appear'd that  Nature  ever acts for the Preservation of the most noble and the most perfect of her Works A Soldier of the Fort of  Mirabout  which parts the Valleys of  Luserne  from  Queras  having rob'd his Captain was pursu'd and finding no other Way to escape he threw himself down from the top of the Walls upon the Rocks where falling on his  Feet  they were not only put out of Joynt but each of them were fractur'd with a Wound He was taken and brought to the Fort where there was no  Surgeon  by reason of the Smallness of the  Garrison    He lay four Months on Straw without any Relief but Bread and Water during which time his Feet were gangren'd and soon afterward intirely mortified  But which is extremely surprizing around the lower part of both the  Legs  a little above the  Ancle Nature  her self form'd a certain  Wreath  or  Roll  which stopt the Progress of the  Mortification  so that what was beyond this was abandon'd to the Fury of the  Sphacelus    while whatever was above these  Rolls  was free from Blemish  He cut off the  Right Foot  himself by the Joynt with a little Pocketknife without either  Pain  or  Bleeding  and because the Putrefaction occasion'd an  Intollerable Smell  over all the Fort by Reason of the excessive Heat he was sent to our Hospital at  Luserne    By the Way he lost a good part of the  Other Foot  which came away of its own accord and notwithstanding the  contagious Smell  which as a Carrion he dispers'd in all the Places where he pass'd and also the extreame Heat of the Season the Mortification did not pass over the Bounds that  Nature  had given it only these  Wreaths  that we mention'd above were considerably increas'd in Bulk by the Way  After he had recovered his Strength by the Assistance of good  Cordials  some  Wine  and Victuals I cut off all that appear'd to be intirely mortify'd not sparing the highest Places of the  Rolls  which cast an insupportable Smell I let him rest till to morrow and then cut off one  Leg  and the other the Day after For the Ends of the  Tibia  and  Fibula  were altogether rotten and uncover'd Finally no other Accident hppen'd during the rest of the Cure which was compleated not long after  This wonderful Example is sufficient to evince that the want of  Art  is oftentimes supply'd  by  Nature  This may further appear also by what follows being a very strange thing that happen'd at  Pignerol M De la Place  Captain in the Regiment of  Barrois  was wounded with a  Bullet  at the Battel of  Marseils  that entred at the middle and hinder Part of the  Forearm  and came out at the lower and forepart of the same breaking the  Cubitus  in its passage He was drest by  M Malinas  a SurgeonMajor belonging to the Army in  Italy  and Master Surgeon of  Lyon  very skilful in his Imployment  This  Wound  was attended with some troublesom Accidents For together with a  Continual Fever  an  Abscess  was form'd by a Collection of Matter which was extended over all the  Arm  and  ForeArm  But as they were preparing to make an Opening the wounded Person was seiz'd with a great  Loosness  which all of a sudden put an  End  to that  Tumor  and restor'd the  Arm  and  ForeArm  to their natural State This unexpected  Accident  being followed by so surprizing an Effect oblig'd his Surgeon to cause take a view of that which the  Patient  had voided and it was found to be the very  Matter  of the  Abscess  without any thing else save some little Excrement which remain'd altogethr unmix'd therewith Moreover according as new  Matter  was gathered in the same Places it was still  voided  again  by  Stool  in a little time after In fine the  Wounds  being compleatly cur'd the  Loosness  ceas'd because that was remov'd which occasion'd it  Perhaps the  Matter  was taken up by the  Veins  and by means of the Circulation carried to the  Mesaraicks  and thence emptied into the  Guts  but this I only propose as an uncertain  Conjecture  all other Ways being to me unknown I willingly leave it to the  Learn'd  to be explain'd according to their different  Apprehensions  But that which inclines me to think that this  Way  has some Appearance of Truth is that this same  Surgeon  solemnly protested to me that at the beginning of the same Campain he had under his Care a  Captain  who had a Wound in the  Thorax  that pierc'd into the Substance of the  Lungs  and was accompany'd with all the  Accidents  common to such kind of Wounds all which nevertheless were remov'd by Opening a  Vein  in the  Arm  which was done with an Intention to let  Blood  instead of which nothing came out by the  Orifice  made in the  Vein  but  real Matter  that had been sent thither from the  Breast  Many Persons worthy of Credit who were EyeWitnesses assur'd me of the Truth of this  Prodigy    Fabricius Hildanus Chapt    Observ  relates that an  Inveterate Vlcer  in the  Leg  with a  Fistula  having been rashly and unseasonably  cur'd was followed by a  Pleuresie  in which the Patient voided at the Mouth a  Matter  like to that which us'd to come from the  Vlcer  of the  Leg    It were an easie Matter to adduce an infinite number of Examples almost alike wherein  Nature  appears to have surpass'd even her self either in Preserving Parts afflicted or in easing such as are Overcharg'd with Humours or finally in Uniting such as are Divided  In the Year one  Lansaveche  QuarterMaster of the Dragoons of  Verue  in the War against the  Vaudois  was wounded by a large  Bullet  in the upper and sidepart of the  Hypogastrium  and by all the  Accidents  it appear'd that the  Colon  was opened and torn by the Bullet there came out at the  Wound  for more than the space of two Months an  excrementitious Matter  during which time he suffer'd grievous Pains At length  Nature  without any Assistance clos'd up the  Wound  of the  Gut  tho' the Bullet was lost and he left  Luserne  at the Breaking up of the Hospital which was three Months after his Receiving the Wound  Hildanus  has a like Observation of a certain Man who had one of the great Guts opened in the Operation of the  Bubonocele  which clos'd up of its own Accord In fine as we are oftentimes surprized by things that  could not be hop'd but from either the  Bounty  or even the  Caprice  of  Nature  so also very extraordinary things fall out in Wounds by an Effect of Chance as well by reason of the  Posture  Men are in when they receive their  Wounds  as because of the  Figure  of these things with which they are wounded  In the same  Year  One wounded with a Shot was brought to the Hospital at  Luserne  the  Bullet  entered on the lower and middle part of the  Os Occipitis  and grazing upon the  TempleBone  came out under the  Right Ear  carrying away a Part therof Tho' it plainly enough appear'd that the  Bullet  had touch'd the  Scull  yet the Wound was dress'd as a simple one because no Accident appear'd and it was left to the Care of the Servants thus three Days past during which the Patient was troubled with a Restlesness complaining only that he could nor put himself in an easie Posture which was not much minded Nevertheless he dy'd on the fourth Day of his Wound with all the Symptoms that usually attend  sleepy Distempers    The unexpected Death of this Man oblig'd me to open his  Scull  I found he had been wounded with a little  Wedge  of  Lead  which hitting against the middle Ridge on the lower Part of the  Os Occipitis  when at the same time his Head was bow'd down was cut in  two by the sharp Edge of the Bone and one part thereof had slipt upon the  TempleBone  as was said and the other had enter'd the Cavity of the  Scull  of that same Side and remain'd fix'd between it and the  Membranes  which were cut and press'd thereby His FellowSoldier in the same Day and Action had two Wounds by one Shot the first a little below the  YokeBone  of the left Side and the other in the middle part of the  Right Hypochondre  Yet he was compleatly cur'd in twelve Days with a Moderate  Suppuration  and no  Accidents    I have seen many  Wounds  that were no less strange than these But in order to make a right Judgment in such like Cases the Nature and Figure of the  wounded Part  the Posture of the Person when he received the Wound together with the Figure of that which made it must all be very carefully examin'd beforehand Now the ready apprehending of all these Circumstances with many others also very necessary to be known in order to successful Practice can't be attain'd by Surgeons without great  Study  continual  Exercise  and unwearied  Diligence    The Ascent whereby we mount unto the  Temple  of  Esculapius  is no less difficult and steep than that by which we rise unto  Mount Pernassus  'Tis almost impossible to get up without making some false Steps However 'tis but  reasonble to think that those who were employ'd in  Hospitals  and  Armies  during the late  War  by the inumerable different cases which it hath afforded have discover'd things very surprising and no less useful in Practice and have often seen the  Strange Ways  that  Nature  takes to throw off what offends by healthful  Evacuations  and to accomplish her Designs  Such as impart to the Publick their  Observations  and  Experiences  which are the Fruits of their  Diligence  and of their  Care  have deserved well of  Mankind  Many  Surgeons  there are who have not the Advantage of Occasions to accomplish themselves in this sort and of those that have few are so charitable as to publish what they have seen and remark'd that is Extraordinary  When a Man does not communicate his  Attainments  by  Writing  to the Publick let his  Endowments  and his  Knowledge  be never so great they are for the most part if not altogether buried with himself in the Ground The  Good  that a Man can do lasts but for a time but the  Excellent Advices  that he leaves in writing to Posterity are useful for ever We had been still in  Ignorance  had not the  Writings of the Ancients  come down to our Hands  Wherefore I thought my self bound in  Conscience  tho' at the Hazard of being condemn'd  by the  Envious  to impart to the  World  my  Experiences That  if possible  I might procure to poor  wounded Persons  a more  speedy Assistance  than can possibly be afforded by the  Common Method If I shall have the  Happiness  to succeed in my  Design  I shall think my self sufficiently recompens'd for all my  Toyl  and will praise the  Almighty Father  of  Lights  who by  small Means  oftentimes brings  Mighty Things  to pass  FINIS  BOOKS Printed for and Sold by  Thomas Cockerill  at the  Three Legs  and  Bible  in the  Poultrey    GEography Anotamized or the Compleat Geographical Grammar Being a
