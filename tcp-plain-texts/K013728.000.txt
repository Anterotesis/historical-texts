 SOME OBJECTIONS Humbly offered to the CONSIDERATION OF THE Hon HOUSE of COMMONS Relating to the present intended Relief of Prisoners  LONDON  Printed for R WALKER at the  WhiteHart  without  TempleBar  E NUTT at the  RoyalExchange  and sold by the Booksellers of  London  and  Westminster    Price  d  SOME OBJECTIONS c  PART I  Of the  Fraud  made use of by  Insolvents  to bring themselves within the Reach of the Acts of  Parliament  with some Limitations humbly offered to be considered of in order not to prevent an Act of Favour to real  Insolvents  but to prevent the Abuse of it by improper Objects  IT is no wonder if after so many Petitions from the several Prisons almost over the whole Kingdom and such horrid  Cruelties  and Inhumanities as appears to have been practised by some Jailors especially by the  Warden of the Fleet  and his  Agents  upon several unfortunate Gentlemen who have fallen into their Hands I say 'tis no wonder if a Bill for Relief of Prisoners is become very popular  By how much the ill Usage of the Prisoners who are thus abused by the  Keepers of Prisons  shocks the tender and charitable Part in every Man's Breast by so much the Case of the  Prisoners  even of those who have not been used ill prevails upon the  Publick  in favour of the GRACE desir'd  Nor shall one Word be said or one Thought suggested in this Tract in Prejudice of the  Charitable  Intention of the House or any way to lessen the good and generous Disposition of any Person whatever whether in the Legislature or out of it towards promoting so good a Work  Far less  shall I take one Step or speak one Word that so much as looks like a Plea for the  Cruelty  and Inhumanity of  Jaylors  and Prisonkeepers their Conduct in most if not in all the Jails in  England  calls aloud for a like Inspection of Authority and for Justice upon the Persons as well as a severe Censure of the Practises of the Delinquents in order to have that rigid tho' necessary Part of the Law call'd  Imprisonment for Debt  be executed with  Humanity  and with Equity according to the natural Rights of the Unfortunate as Men and according to  their  legal  Rights as  Englishmen  which it is evident has not been observ'd hitherto  And to conclude this Part  least of all  shall I say one Word here in behalf of the Persons at this time detected openly in the  Cruelties  Inhumanities and Extortions which they have practis'd upon the unhappy Gentlemen who have fallen into their Hands I do not see they merit the least  Favour  from their Country they have acted a  dreadful Part  and they are in Hands which I doubt not will have more  Mercy  than they have shewn to the Miserable who have been under their Power and tho' I shall not on the other hand prompt or push their  Misfortune  yet this I may say without any Prejudice or Injury to them that I hope they shall have such Justice as will effectually disable them and warn all others of that  rough  Employment from the  like  Practices  Having laid down these  Postulata  in order to prevent any prejudging my Design in this Work or raising a  popular  Clamour as if it was intended to lessen the intended  Grace  of the Government or Legislature and to prevent the  Deliverance  of Prisoners I shall with the more freedom lay down some Difficulties  which as they occur to me on this Occasion shall be worth the Consideration of the Legislature not to lye as  Obstructions  in the way of the intended Bill as a Reason  sine qua non  but that the Parliament taking them into their Hands and  approving  or  disapproving  them as they shall appear  important  may find out such  proper Remedies  as to their great Wisdom shall seem meet  Having thus as I hope remov'd the Prejudices which might lye against my present Design I must also speak a Word or two very briefly to remove if possible a popular Objection at least as it is used in the Mouths of some who are more particucularly concern'd in that part namely that it is  unchristian  and inhuman and inconsistent with a  generous  Nation abhorring Cruelty as  England  professes to be to confine poor miserable People in  Prison  for Debt especially such as have nothing to pay  As to the latter Part  viz  of  confining  People in Prison who have  nothing  to pay I come readily into that part and in doing so I confirm what I have said above that I am not writing in order to intercept the intended  Grace  of the Parliament to the  Unfortunate  The honest Debtor willing to  pay but  unable  and willing to pay as far as he is  able  and ready to give all reasonable Satisfaction such as the Parliament may direct that he is so unable is certainly an  Object  recommending it self to the  Charity  and Compassion of the whole Nation and whatever intervenes by the Fraud of others these and these only are allow'd to be the Persons for whom the  Parliamentary Grace  which has been settled and extended in so many Acts of Parliament already pass'd has been  intended    That very great Numbers of  Fraudulent  unqualify'd wicked and dishonest People have formerly receiv'd the Benefit of the like  Grace  by the Help of  false Oaths  unjust Pretences Connivance of Jailors Bribery and Corruption of many kinds has been loudly complain'd of and I doubt is much easier to prove than to prevent and not being willing as I have said to be any ways a Hindrance to the Relief of the  honest  and real Objects of  Grace  who are indeed within the Intention of the Act I cover all that Part with saying Better  Ten  dishonest Debtors  escape  than that  one  real Object of the intended  Good  should  perish    Yet I humbly propose it as a Thing worthy the Consideration of the  British Parliament  whether it is any Way probable that there can be such a Number of miserable Insolvents in one Year and that of but the  lowest  Class too namely not owing above  l  to any one Person and all actually Prisoners as have presented themselves yearly to the Magistrates to be discharged by the  Grace  of Parliament for these several Years past  If it is true as common  Fame  says it is that notwithstanding there was an Act for Delivering such  Prisoners  but  two  Years past there are at this Time near ninety Thousand such  Insolvents  now on the Books of the several  Jails  in this Kingdom I say if this is  true  is it rational to believe that these are all really and fairly Prisoners within the Intent and Meaning of the  intended Grace    It would be a noble Undertaking and in my Opinion well worth the House of Commons tho' it took up a good Part of a  Session  to find out some effectual Means to  separate between the Sheep and the Goats  speaking of that Allusion with due Regard in this Case and to discover expose and  punish the  Frauds  which are put upon the NATION in this Affair  It is true the People are despicable I mean the  Guilty  the Debts they lye for not large at least not to particular Men and some may suggest that it is not worth Notice but I reply the Number is great surprizingly great and the Injury to Trade is very  considerable  nor is the Matter small among  Tradesmen  tho' the Debts as above are not singly large For as many of these  Insolvents  frequently fall within the Compass of one and the same Shopkeeper it very often falls heavy and as these  fraudulent  Debtors boldly run into Mens Books with a Dependance upon such  Acts of Grace  and with an evident Design to cheat and defraud their Creditors and this  several  Times over such People are I think very far from being Debtors who deserve Compassion or within the Intent and Meaning of the  Parliamentary  Grace  Likewise they are greatly injurious to Trade in general as they  ruin innocent  Tradesmen by their Knavery many Tradesmen having had thirty to fifty such Insolvents discharged by  one Act  tho' they were never  put in Prison or so much ar arrested at their Suit or for any Part of their Debt  The usual  Practice  of these People has been to run themselves into the  Tradesmens Books  as it is called in as many particular and different Places as possible always taking Care that it be for small Sums within the usual Restraint of the  Acts of Grace  and then when the expected  Favour  is in Prospect get themselves arrested and put in Prison or turn'd over by  Habeas Corpus  so to be within the Reach of the Law and then all the other  Creditors  who have never offered them the  least  Violence are paid with a SUMMONS  Others by  Corruption  of Jailors and by  Bribery  have obtained those Jailors to own them as  Prisoners in Custody  tho' not  really  so for a certain antedated Time so as to be brought within the Reach of the Act  What  Perjury  what  Forgery  what foul Things are practised under this Head deserves the Inspection of the like Authority as lately detected the  Frauds  of the  Fleetprison  a Committee who are above the Reach of  Fraud  or  Corruption  themselves and fully qualified to search those  Deeds of  Darkness  to the Bottom indeed it seems to be reserv'd to a House of Commons and to them only  It was the Saying of a known and judicious Writer that no Man ought to complain in Print of any publick Grievance unless at the same Time he proposed also the Remedies I shall take the Hint and offer something to the Purpose in this Case that I may dismiss it as I go  I It would go a great Way towards preventing this Mischief if it was provided in the  Act  that no  Insolvent  should claim the Benefit  twice  over it having been frequent to have them take  new Credit  after their having been once  discharged  seeking out new Places of Abode and new Creditors who upon a Variety of Pretences they insinuate themselves so far into as to get Credit with them their former Circumstances not being known  II That none should claim the Benefit of such an  Act  who had  run  from their  Bail  made  Escapes  from Officers or Prisonkeepers upon their Parole or that had committed any notorious  Fraud  punishable by Law or that had obtained Credit upon Promise and express Conditions before two or more Witnesses who shall attest the same not to claim or take the Benefit of any such  Act of Grace    III That none should claim such  Benefit  who shall conceal any of their Goods and Effects from their Creditors notwithstanding their having made Affidavit as the Law directs as in the Case of a Bankrupt  These Proviso's together with a  New Method  to be taken to limit and restrain the  Prisonkeepers  to prevent their keeping Prisoners on their Books after they have been  discharged antedating  their Commitments and giving  fraudulent  Certificates of their being  Prisoners  when really they were not I say these Methods and such as these under the farther Direction and Improvement of the Legislature I perswade myself would go a great way to prevent the Abuse of  Parliamentary Grace  and to make the future  Acts for Relief of Insolvents  effectually and truly merciful and good and the honest  poor  Prisoner nobody repining at his Relief would be deliver'd the  knavish  designing  Debtor remaining  as he ought to do  where the Law directs  This leads me to enter a little into the Question so much insisted on by some  viz  that  no Man should be put in Prison for Debt    It is true that this  Doctrine  has many Advocates and some have pushed it so far as to think the contrary Opinion  cruel  and unchristian but I shall enquire more particularly into it in the next Part  In the mean time I take this Occasion to repeat again what I hinted at before namely that this is so far from  impeaching  the common Charity and the Compassion of the  British  Nation to Prisoners that it prompts and recommends it by the meer Nature of the Thing for when I argue against the Knavery of the Debtor in making himself a  voluntary  Prisoner on purpose to defraud and delude his  Creditors  it naturally follows that the Prisons should be purged from all such voluntary fraudulent People and those that remain would be the more real and unexceptionable Objects of the National  Grace    When the Prisoners were all really  Insolvent  really miserable and that without any room to charge either  them  or the  Jailers  and  Keepers  with corrupt Practices abusing the publick Mercy and the like the Parliament would always be the more ready to pass Acts for their Relief as they should see Cause so that this Proposal is evidently calculated to encourage and prompt the Mercy of the  Publick  to  Insolvents  by removing all the just  Objections  which now lie in the way and have so often obstructed it  PART II  Of the Necessity of Preserving to the Creditor the Right of arresting and imprisoning the  Person  of his Debtor and how the Petty Credit given in all Retail Trade and which is essential to the Support of our whole  Commerce  depends upon it  I Believe it will not be called  begging the Question  to lay it down as a  Foundation  That as there is a greater Trade carried on in  England  than in any other Nation in  Europe  so there is a larger Personal Credit given in Trade here than in any other Nation not in  Europe  only but in the whole World  There are so many  Evidences  of the first and so many Authors have written on that Subject that I need only refer my Reader to them and the last is evident to every  MERCHANT now in Trade who sees with the least Observation what Difference there is between the way of Trading here and the like way of Trading in  Foreign  Countries and between the Credit given in either  Some would make it a Question  tho' I think it is no Question  whether the Greatness of our Trade is the Cause of giving this  large Credit  or that the giving this large Credit is the Cause of the  Greatness of our Trade    I say there is no room to debate this Part the latter is evident to Demonstration namely that the giving such large Credit is the true Spring of the Greatness of our Trade This appears by comparing the Bulk of the Trade in this Kingdom with the Bulk of our  Current Stock  in Trade If no  Credit  was given the Trade could not go beyond the  Stock  it is true it might go beyond the Current Coin because some Trade may be carry'd on by Barter or exchanging one kind of Goods for another without the Interposition of any  Medium  which is Money But no Trade can go beyond the  Stock  without  Credit  because one Value must always be deliver'd for another and they must be  always equal too otherwise the Exchange is not equal nor the Payment compleat  But in Credit the Case is quite different for here the Seller delivers his Goods which are a  real Value  to the Buyer on his Note for Payment or perhaps on his Verbal Promise either of which is an  imaginary Value  only in a Word the  Fame  or Reputation of a Buyer is put into the  Scale of Commerce  with the  real  Value and Substance of the Seller and the one is deliver'd for the other the Account in the Tradesman's Ledger stands as a Register of the Case the Buyer stands Debtor on one side for the Value of the Goods sold and deliver'd to him against an open  Blank  on the contrary side to be fill'd up to his  Creditor  when he pays the Money  By this strange thing call'd  Credit  all the mighty Wonders of an exalted Commerce are perform'd a Tradesman beginning with a Thousand Pound Cash and a good Character shall store his Shop or Warehouse with  l  in Goods and may trade for nay for  l per Annum  and so long as he manages  prudently  pays currently and keeps up his Reputation shall run almost what Length he pleases in his  Trade so much greater a Stroke in Trade does his  Character  furnish to him than his  Cash    Upon the Foot of this very Article call'd  Credit  as a private Man may trade for  l per Annum  with but  l  Stock so if the Stock of the who  e Trade of  GreatBritain  be as some insist Ten Millions the Trade may actually return a Hundred Millions of Pounds Sterling in a Year an  immense  Sum but not at all  improbable  to be true and perhaps within Compass too  But to bring it down to the Subject Take the Credit given in smaller Articles I mean in  retailing  Goods to the  last  Consumer This is what I call  petty Credit  and is the particular thing which fills our Jails with  Insolvent  Prisoners Even this  petty Credit  is though small in the particular immensely great in the general and tho' it does not  encrease  the Stock of the Retailer it certainly does  encrease  his Trade and causes him to sell a great deal more Goods than otherwise he would find Customers for  Thus the  Wholesale  Dealer trusts or gives Credit to the  Retailer  and thereby encreases  his Stock  for Credit in Trade is Stock in  Trade the  Retailer  gives Credit to the  Con  umer  and thereby increases  his Sale    Now upon what Foundation is all this Credit given The  Retailer  being a  WoollenDraper  trusts his Neighbour with a Suit of Clothes how comes he to do it perhaps the Man has no extraordinary Character well but says the  Retailer  he is a Tradesman as well as I and he must pay me or he shall not be able to stand at his Shop Door or sit behind his  Counter  for I will  arrest  him and make him pay me and upon this  Power  of  Arresting the Debtor  and carrying him to  Prison  or whether he is carry'd to  Prison  or no the exposing him disgracing him and ruining his Credit I say upon this is founded the Freedom of the Tradesman to trust him  If you destroy this Power of  Coercion  you destroy the  Credit in Trade  for if the Man cannot be  credited  he cannot  buy  and if the Tradesman cannot  arrest  him he will not sell  This particular Case merits to be  very well observ'd  and there is more Weight in it than perhaps appears at first View  I say if the Buyer cannot be trusted he cannot buy  that is to say  he cannot buy at that time he will make shift for a while will wear his old Clothes longer go without such or such  fine things  for himself or Wife or Children and abate in his Expence because he has not Money to buy and the Shopkeeper will not trust him  Even the  Drunkard  will abate his Liquor if the  Alehouse  or  Tavernkeeper  will not admit him to score abundance of  Luxury  and  Gaiety  as well in  Food  as  fine things  must abate for want of ready Money whereas Men will venture to buy if they have Credit with the Tradesman  To say let Luxury and Extravagance  abate  it will perhaps reform the Town is to say nothing for the  Question  does not lye that way It is not whether the Luxury will abate but will our  Trade  abate or not if the  Trade abates  as it certainly will my Argument is good  On the other hand if the  Buyer  cannot  buy  the  Seller  cannot  sell  then his Stock lyes dead on his Hands the Money for it and for which perhaps he has been trusted himself grows due and he cannot pay he had better sell and give some  Credit  but he is afraid to do that because if his Debtor refuses to pay he cannot force him to it In short he must  trust  or  shut  up Shop and  break  and thus if a LAW should be made to prevent  arresting  the  Person  of the  Debtor  you at once destroy  Personal Credit  and  ruin  the Tradesmen  I remember an Attempt ignorantly made as it appear'd afterwards even by the  Tradesmen  themselves to destroy this  Petty Credit  The Shopkeepers mightily affected to write over their ShopDoors No TRUST BY RETAIL But the Consequence soon appear'd to the opening their Understandings for  Thousands  of Buyers who laid out their Money freely and who tho' they might not always pay down upon the  Spot  yet paid tolerably well went from their Shops and bought where they knew they could be  trusted    In a Word any LAW which abates  Petty Credit  or Trust by Retail will be fatal to TRADE and would give such a  Blow  to our Commerce in general as it would be impossible for all our Heads put together to retrieve  Therefore if we will support  Trade  we must encourage  Petty Credit  and if you will support  Petty Credit  you must not take away the  Security  to the  Creditor  the Security of the Tradesman's trusting his Neighbour is the Power he has by Law to  enforce  his Payment and of arresting and imprisoning the Debtor if he fails or refuses The Law is the Tradesman's  Security  and if you take away the  Law  which is his  Security  you take away his Trade  What is the Reason why in  Scotland  and in other Countries they have so  little  Trade 'tis because you cannot  enforce  your Demand of Debt you can't send the Debtor to Prison and therefore no Man  buys  till he has  Money  to pay if you will imprison the Debtor you must allow him a Maintenance or he will come out before your Face  It may be true that there is some  Humanity  in such a Law but I cannot say there is any  Policy  in it for it overthrows  personal  Credit and that in effect sinks Trade lessens the  Consumption  of Goods and  ruins  the Tradesmen themselves I cannot but think it were much better to have an  Act of Mercy  every Year to release poor Insolvents upon reasonable Conditions than not have it in the Tradesman's Power to  imprison  them when they do not pay for this  Mercy  will not be so prejudicial to the  particular  Creditors as the other would be to the  general  Credit  It is our Business to  increase  our Trade to the utmost by all lawful Methods nay wise Men in Commerce tell us some Errors even in Morality had better be wink'd at than the Trade be ruin'd or than any  general  Head of Trade be impair'd the Meaning is that in some Cases even our Luxury or Highliving  I do not mean our Drunkenness and Vice  is so essential to our Trade that it were better  continued  than be entirely  suppressed  the Trade would suffer so much  It must be confess'd a Set of  Sumptuary  Laws as they are called to reform our Extravagancies in Equipages and Dress HouseFurniture  and Diet would effectually  ruin  our Commerce starve and leave unemploy'd our  Poor  and reduce the whole Nation to a most deplorable Condition of Misery and Distress  It would be the like  in Case of a Stop to  Credit  for it would be an Abatement of the Consumption in all Sorts of Goods as well our Manufactures and Home Product as our importation from abroad for as the last Consumer is the Life of all if Credit abates he abates his Expence and buys less consequently Trade declines and less is consumed By Credit here  that I may explain Things as I go  I must be understood to mean not  publick  Credit I have nothing to do with that Part here but  personal  Credit the  ordinary  Credit given by one Tradesman to another as well in  wholesale  Dealing and Merchandizing as in Retailing from the Shopkeeper to his Neighbours and Customers and indeed chiefly the  last  for on that does the Wholesale Part depend  Upon this Foundation I build the Consequences which I insist upon as above this  Trust by Retail  this  petty  Credit entirely depends upon the Right which every Citizen thus selling his Goods to his Neighbour  upon  his Word  that is upon his  personal  Credit has by  Law to sue arrest imprison  and  keep in Prison his Debtor  if he delays or refuses to pay the Money when it is due  If you take away this  Right  you take away the  Credit  for no Man will sell his Goods upon a  Faith  which the Debtor is not obliged to  keep    It is a great Mistake to say  personal  Credit is given upon the  Honour  and  Faith  of the Debtor the case is quite otherwise the  Credit  is given to the  Law  'tis my being able to prosecute the Debtor in a Course of Law and  as we call it  make him pay me that encourages me to trust him and therefore 'tis the ordinary Enquiry of a Tradesman when he would  inform  himself about a Man he deals with not whether he be  honest  but whether he is  able  if you tell him he is a  Knave  and won't pay any body if he can help it  O  says the  Tradesman I don't value that I am willing to get off the Goods and if he is  able  I'll venture for I know how to make him willing    Nor does any Part of this Discourse to repeat it again tend in the least to prevent our  Tenderness  to any of these  Debtors  who  are thus  imprison'd  if by Disasters Losses Misfortunes or any visible Accident they are render'd really poor and unable but that such should always be reliev'd and if the Creditor be  cruel  and inexorable as some perhaps will always be the Parliament will on all just Occasions  of which also they are the proper Judges  deliver such Insolvents by  Acts of Clemency and Grace  as they do  now  and no Christian Tradesman can I think repine at their commiserating and relieving  unfortunate  tho' otherwise  honest Insolvents    FINIS
