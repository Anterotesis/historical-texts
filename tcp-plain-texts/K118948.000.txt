 A DEFENCE OF THE ANCIENT LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT of the PEOPLE To  elect Representatives for every Session of Parliament  VIZ Not only  "every Year once"  BUT ALSO "More often if Need be" As expressly required in the old Statute and confirmed by the  general Usage  of ancient Times demonstrated by the Evidence of the ORIGINAL WRITS FOR ELECTION IN A LETTER To a Member of the SURRY Committee  By GRANVILLE SHARP  LONDON Printed by GALABIN and BAKER Number INGRAMCOURT FENCHURCHSTREET MDCCLXXX  COPY of a LETTER to a Mem∣ber of the SURRY Committee  DEAR SIR  I Have paid all the attention that the shortness of the time would permit in searching and procuring authorities to enable you to oppose the objections lately made to  annual parlia∣ments  as stated in your kind letter of the th instant With respect to the first i e their  incompetency now that the empire is so vast and foreign connections so interwoven with us  I beg leave to remind you that the empire is not now more interwoven with foreign connec∣tions I mean those of  Europe  which a∣lone have power to affect us than they were when  annual  parliaments and  "more often if need be"  were the esta∣blished law of the land I mean in the  glorious reign of king Edward III when  several  of the richest and most  populous provinces of France  were the hereditary dominions of the family upon the throne and when the remainder of that mighty and extensive empire with the exception of a very few provinces the great duke of Burgundy himself doing homage for his estates belonged absolutely to the crown of England by the right of con∣quest But the true constitutional an∣swer to the objection is that all foreign dominions acquired by the crown of England  ought to be governed by free par∣liaments of their own  duly elected by the inhabitants of each distinct country res∣pectively who have not only the  best right  but the  best knowledge and abilities  how to prescribe laws for their own go∣vernment safety and necessities This is the only true means of removing all dif∣ficulty from the government of  distant do∣minions  because in the first place it is  the only means that is strictly consistent with the  natural rights  of the inhabitants in each dominion separately considered and also dly the only means of pre∣venting the inhabitants of such distant dominions or colonies from invading the  natural rights  of  each other  which is the source of civil war and disunion and if this most essential principle of our  consti∣tution  and of  natural equity  had been regarded by administration agreeably to what I have stated in my Declaration of the Peoples Rights respecting  Ireland  we should not have lost  America  The only true means for instance to preserve the British empire in  EastIndia  which still remains to us is to instruct the Sooders and lower casts of the Indian tribes concerning their  natural right to a share in the government  of those coun∣tries which they inhabit that their duly elected representatives in a general as∣sembly may have confidence to reject  and confute that detestable lie of the Bra∣mins by which they are holden in sla∣very and rendered the prey of Tartarian as well as European wolves and tigers  The English company of merchants aided by the British government have at present both power and influence suf∣ficient to effect this and restore them to their rights this would be an obligation never to be forgotten and which would establish trade upon its proper basis and  remove all difficulties as well as expence from the government of that vast empire  but if the opportunity be too long ne∣glected it may be suddenly lost for ever  With respect to the second objection  The apprehensions of disorder on too frequent elections  The evidence of experience confutes it as I hope I have already proved in the two little tracts  See the Legal Means of political Reformation in two tracts p and also and See also the three last paragraphs of the Memorial of the Deputies from the several petitioning counties  c  wherein it is declared concerning ANNUAL parliaments that  they were ever described as consistent with the greatest peace and most peaceably conducted  and of which the preamble to the wicked act of the th of king Henry VI is itself an ample testimony  The  legal Means c  p  because the per∣verters of the constitution at that time could not say that  manslaughter ri∣ots batteries  c  had  then  happen∣ed as they really  do now  at our  septennial elections  but only in the  future  tense that  "they shall very likely arise and be"  They could not complain that there were a  number of outrageous people  at county elec∣tions and therefore they perversely and deceitfully complained only of an  outrage∣ous and excessive number of people  the epi∣thet  "outrageous"  was not applicable to the people and therefore they have deceitfully branded the innocent substan∣tive  "number"  with the charge of being  "outrageous"  The reason of this is  plain the manner of wording the act as it now stands has the effect of an in∣sinuation against the behaviour of the people that is to a  careless reader  and thereby it answered the deceitful purpose of those who framed or translated the act which would have been  null and void  for want of  truth  had the adjective  "outrageous"  been applied to the other substantive i e  people  for  falsehood  in a preamble has the unquestionable effect of destroying the force of any statute  But if the people really were  outrageous  at elections as well as  excessively numerous  yet it is certain that they had  right  on their side and intended the good of the kingdom in general because they have the evidence of all antiquity that the  majority  of these excessive numbers were generally for sending to parliament the best and most respectable men they could find among them which is not only pro∣ved by the testimony I quoted from  Prynne in p and of my first little tract  For a  more equal representation c  but also by the evidence of that learned antiquarian Browne Willis Esq who tells us in the preface of his  Noti∣tia parliamentaria  that  the knights of shires  viz those that were chosen by the  outrageous and excessive number of peo∣ple    have EVER IN ALL COUNTIES been chosen out of the principal  gentry and quality  and though says he the citizens and burgesses were hereto∣fore elected out of their respective communities and were only the CHIEF and MOST EMINENT MERCHANTS  c  of their own communities or cor∣porate bodies yet in king Edward IV's time we find a great many of them distinguished by titles  c  This affords a farther answer also to the first objection against  annual  parliaments  For who are so fit to judge of public affairs  now that the empire  is so vast  and foreign connexions so interwoven with us  according to the objector's sta∣ting as  the principal gentry and qua∣lity  out of the counties and the  "chief and most eminent merchants"  out of the trading cities and boroughs and more especially such knights citizens and burgesses as those of ancient times whose conduct in parliament procured them  the honour  of being  annually retur∣ned  and sometimes  more often  for seve∣ral years together  Thus the two first objections against  annual elections  are manifestly without foundation and with respect to the third that  it never was the law of the land  So far is this objection from the  truth  that the de∣puties from the several petitioning counties  c  have in their MEMORIAL declared that  shortening the du∣ration of the sitting of parliament can only be done  CON∣SISTENTLY WITH  the  CONSTITUTION  or with the best policy on any enlarged view by shortening it  TO THE PERIOD OF A YEAR  and they afterwards cite the ancient acts which ordained that  a parliament shall be holden every year once and more often if need be  it savours either of such deplo∣rable  ignorance or of such barefaced falsehood and effrontery as scarcely de∣serves an answer  If I have made any error or misrepre∣sentation in either of the little tracts let the objectors point it out and they will not find me backward to submit to  truth  for that is my duty to God and man But to condemn the doctrine in the lump without deigning to give a single reason or proof against it though it is sup∣ported by the most unquestionable histo∣rical evidence of which many even of the  original  documents I mean the  an∣nual  or rather  sessional writs  themselves do still exist in our public records to this day is such a detestable perversion of  truth  such a depravity of human nature in the baneful service of our great natu∣ral enemy the  "father of lies"  that I should hardly have believed my own ears had I been present when the objection was made  Persons who discover such impotent malice against  truth  must be warned of their  spiritual  danger lest they should be lost for ever  That you may be able more easily to confute such objectors I have sent you Browne Willis's Notitia parliamentaria where you will find in the very first ta∣ble of writs viz that for the county of Bedford examples of  annual  elections for twenty years together in continual succession except in one single instance which omission will be the more easily excused if it be considered that there were  two general elections  in the year which  preceded  the year of omission as also  two general elections  in the year which  followed  it The period I refer to is be∣tween the th of king Edward II and the th of king Edward III In the th year of the latter reign there were  three  new parliaments two in the th two in the th two in the th two  in the th two in the th and FOUR in the th year  It was an ancient usage of our Saxon ancestors to hold  provincial parliaments  or  shiregemots  regularly twice a year    For the assembling of parliament which by the insti∣tution of king Alfred was  to assemble twice a year  See the speech of sir George Crooke Justice of the king'sbench in Hampden's trial on shipmoney Anno and Car  "Twa schiregemot"  or  two county parli∣aments  are expressly ordained to be holden  "on gear"  i e  "in a year"  by the th law of king Edgar and the th law of Canute See Lambard's Archionomia p and  This affords ample proof not only that  new  parliaments should be holden every year  once  but even  "more often if need be"  The book con∣tains a great abundance of other exam∣ples and though the  annual  elections were sometimes omitted yet this affords no proof against the peoples  right  to have them Another learned antiquarian Mr Gurdon informs us in his History of the high Court of Parliament page that  new  summonses were to go out for a  new  parliament  The continuance of parliaments for a longer term without  reelection  seems to have been begun in the reign of king Edward IV after the people had been so cruelly harrassed by civil war that they had no spirit or perhaps  power  left to oppose that dangerous usur∣pation of their parliamentary rights by  royal prorogations  In preceding times the  adjournments  or  prorogations  which words had then the same meaning were seldom for more than  a few days  Richard II  The same Saturday the parliament for certain causes by the  commandment  was ADJOURNED until  Monday ensu∣ing  and on the same  Monday  it was  adjourned  until  Tuesday next following  for the like cause at the  king's commandment  See sir Rob Cotton's Abridgement of the Records in the Tower  p  N B  These  adjournments  being made by the  king's command  were manifestly what we now call  prorogations  at a time and that only on extraordinary and unavoidable occasions as  sick∣ness  the absence of the  king  or  great lords  the neglect of  "certain sheriffs in not returning their writs"  king Richard II  The same Friday being the th of April for that  the duke of Lancaster and other lords  were not returned from the North and for that also  certain sheriffs had not returned their writs  the parliament was  adjourned  until  the Wednesday fol∣lowing  and in the mean time the commons were willed to go together to choose their speaker  Ibid    c  or when the representatives  promised to travel to their countries  to hold farther conference with their con∣stituents concerning any  "new device"  king Edward III  The commons made answer That they knew and tendred the king's estate and were ready to aid the same  only in this new device they durst not agree without farther conference with their countries  and so praying respite until another time THEY PROMISE TO TRAVEL TO THEIR COUNTRIES    Ibid  p This last is the very best reason that can ever be given for the  prorogation of parliaments  as this alone can reconcile with the people's just rights the  reassembling  of a parliament without a pre∣vious  reelection  that is when the representatives  travel to their  countries  for the express purpose of  conferring  with the people and to receive their  instructions  once a year  at the least  This book I have also sent for your perusal and likewise an histori∣cal  Treatise of Cities and Boroughs by Dr Brady who bears ample testimony to the means which I have proposed in my first tract for obtaining  a more equal representation  for he proves that  IN SEVERAL COUNTIES  the  CITIZENS  and  BURGESSES  were chosen in the  COUNTYCOURTS  with the  KNIGHTS  on the day of the  KNIGHTS ELECTION  in the  SAME  court and jointly returned in  ONE INDENTURE  especially before the statute of the  d  of king Henry  VI  and in some after that  c  p  It would be too tedious to give you more proofs respecting  the law of the land  in answer to the third objec∣tion and in answer to the fourth objec∣tion  that the whole constitution must be newmodelled to that idea  I shall be  still more brief having only to add that we are far from desiring that  the consti∣tution may be newmodelled  we only pray that the unjust  usurpations  made without the consent of the people the  corruptions and other such abuses  may be taken away and reformed and then the ancient constitution of  annual  elections and  "more often if need be"  will recover its full vigour without any other altera∣tion  I remain with great esteem Dear sir Your affectionate friend And humble servant Granville Sharp
