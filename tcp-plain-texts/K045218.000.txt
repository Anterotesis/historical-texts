 THE STAGE DEFENDED FROM SCRIPTURE REASON EXPERIENCE and the Common Sense of MANKIND for Two Thousand Years  Occasion'd by Mr  Law  's late Pamphlet against STAGEENTERTAINMENTS  In a LETTER to * * * * * *  By Mr  DENNIS  LONDON  Printed for N BLANDFORD at the  LondonGazette    Charing Cross  and sold by J PEELE at  Locke'sHead  in  PaternosterRow  MDCCXXVI Price One Shilling  TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE  GEORGE DODINGTON    Esq  One of the LORDS COMMISSIONERS of His Majesty's Treasury  SIR  _THE following little Treatise is to all Appearance so very a Trifle that I should not have the Assurance to address it to a Gentleman of your distinguish'd Rank if my chief Design were not to engage you in order to promote the Honour of your Country and the Good of the learned World to take upon you the Protection of the  British  Dramatical Muses so far at least as to pronounce in their Favour 'Tis the Sense of all who have the Honour to be acquainted with you that you have a perfect Knowledge of the Merits of the Cause and Ability and Authority to determine it in the last Appeal The  British  Dramatick Muses make this Request to you  Sir  who have been barbarously used both by their Friends and their Enemies for by their Friends they have been more than once poorly deserted and abandon'd  to the Slanders and the unjust Accusations of their most inveterate Enemies  I appeal to you  Sir  if they are not idle Dreamers who believe that a great a powerful and an opulent People can be without publick Diversions or if it is fitting they should be without them I appeal to you  Sir  if a great and a brave People by being often assembled and pleased together will not be the more pleased with one another and the more among themselves united  But as all Pleasures and Diversions both publick and private are barbarous or gentle rational or sensual manly or effeminate noble or base and degenerate 'tis agreed on by all the sensible World that the publick Diversions of a free Nation ought neither to be barbarous nor sensual nor base nor effeminate because publick Diversions of the first Kind reflect Dishonour upon a brave Nation and Diversions of the other three Kinds have a natural Tendency to the introducing a general and total Corruption of Manners which is inconsistent with Liberty  The publick Diversions which are at present establish'd in  Great Britain  are either the Combats of our modern Gladiators or the  Italian  Opera's or the Masquerades or Tragedies and Comedies which are the only genuine legitimate Entertainments of the Stage  As for the first of these the Combats of our modern Gladiators I appeal to you  Sir  who by travelling have had the Advantage of knowing the Sentiments and Manners of other Nations if they are not regarded by all  Europe  excepting our selves with Horror and esteem'd to be neither agreeable to the Spirit of Christianity nor to the Manners of a civilized People  As to the  Italian  Opera's they are allow'd by all the impartial World to be sensual and effeminate compared to the genuine Drama and a greater real Promoter of wanton and sensual Thoughts than ever the Drama was pretended to be because too great a Part of them consisting of Softness of Sound and of Wantonness of Thought they have nothing of that good Sense and Reason and that artful Contrivance which are essential to the Drama No you know very well  Sir  that good Sense and Reason and every strict Attention to an artful Design are so many natural and moral Restraints upon wanton and sensual Thoughts  I now  Sir  desire Leave to say something concerning Masquerades which Mr  Law  affirms to be more innocent than the Drama which is a frontless Assertion and the very Reverse of Reason I remember one of our Comick Poets observes that young Ladies run a greater Risk of their Reputations by being familiar with Fools than with Men of Sense because Fools have but one Way of passing their Time with them So Masquerades having neither the Sense of the Drama nor the Sound of the Opera Persons of both Sexes may go to them either with no Design or with a very vile one To which I might add the late Remark of a wise and pious Prelate which is  That Masquerades deprive Virtue and Religion of their last Refuge Shame which  says he  keeps Multitudes of Sinners within the Bounds of Decency after they have broke thro' all the Ties of Principle and Conscience But this Invention sets them free from that also being neither better nor worse than an Opportunity to say and do there what Virtue Decency and Good Manners will not permit to be said or done in any other Place  This wise and pious Prelate in this very Passage censures the Persons of either Sex who frequent lewd and prophane Plays But he does not assert here that there are no Plays but what are lewd and prophane And he affirms that Masquerades are of more dangerous Consequence to Virtue and Good Manners than ev'n Plays which are prophane  Thus  Sir  I have endeavour'd to shew that of three of the present reigning Diversions one is cruel and barbarous and not at all becoming either of a Christian or a civilized Nation the Second effeminate wanton and sensual and the Third either very unmeaning or else neither moral nor christian  No Art of Man in the most happy Age of the most happy Nation has been able to find out a publick Diversion that has been reasonable noble manly and virtuous but the Drama when it is writ as it ought be And yet these wild Enthusiasts who have shot their Bolts against the Stage have said not a Word against the other three which cannot be defended by the least Pretence that any of them can have to Goodness or moral Instruction  Sir  The following Treatise is not only a Defence of Dramatick Poetry but of the Establish'd Government in the Administration of which the Wisdom of the King has given you an illustrious Share and against which Mr  Law  's Pamphlet is obliquely designed as were the Writings which his two Predecessors  Collier  and  Bedford  publish'd against the Stage  Collier  by his Action and  Bedford  by his other Writings because profess'd and declar'd Enemies to the Government One of them absolved an impenitent Traytor who died with Treason in his Mouth  and the other upon publishing his Book upon Hereditary Right was imprison'd for High Treason  But  Sir  the following Treatise was likewise design'd in Defence of all the People of Quality of both Sexes in  England  and of all the People in any Country throughout the Christian World where they frequent any Theatres all which numerous People he has very charitably given to the Devil to have and to hold for ever  Nor Engine nor Device Polemick  Disease nor Doctor Epedemic  E'er sent so vast a Colony  To the infernal World as he  But all that I have been able to do in the Defence of so good a Cause is to shew that I heartily wish well to it It belongs to you  Sir  and to those few who resemble you who have Discernment and Taste that qualify you to determine surely and Honour and Justice enough to engage you to pronounce and judge impartially to take the  British  Drama into your Protection and Patronage in order to retrieve its former Lustre and augment its Glory  By taking the  British  Theatre into your Protection and Patronage you would protect and patronize every other Branch of the  British  Poetry For as the  British  Theatre as long as it was justly and judiciously managed among us was the only publick Rewarder of Dramatick Poetry so it has been the only chief Support and Encouragement of every other Species of that noble Art It has cherish'd and inflamed the Spirit of Poetry and raised a noble Emulation among us more than all our Kings and all our  Ministers together From the very building of  London  to the erecting the first Theatre in it which Time contains about thirty Centuries we had but two  British  Poets who deserve to be read But from the Establishment of our Theatres to the present Time which contains scarce a Century and a half we may boldly affirm that more than ten times that Number of Poets have appear'd and flourish'd in  England  And here  Sir  I beg Leave to observe the Advantage of Genius that  Great Britain  has over  France  with Relation to the Drama For our Neighbours the  French  notwithstanding the vast Encouragement that was given by Cardinal  Richlieu  and by  Lewis  the XIVth at the Instigation of Monsieur  Colbert  his First Minister never could with Justice boast of more than one Comick and two Tragick Poets whereas more than ten of our Countrymen have without any publick Encouragement but what they derived from the Stage itself and that how inconsiderable signalized themselves in Comedy alone within the Compass of those fifty Years that followed the Restoration  I know indeed very well  Sir  that other Reasons may be assigned besides the Want of a Theatre why no more Poets flourished before Queen  Elizabeth  's Time But I am at the same Time convinced that the Reason why we have had so many since has been the Establishment of our Theatres For the Dramatick Poets the Case is plain few would have given themselves the Trouble to write Dramatick Poems if there had not been Theatres in which they might be acted And some who were by Nature qualified to succeed better in other Kinds of Poetry  than the Dramatick had by Reason of the Lowness of their Fortunes been uncapable of exerting their Genius's in those other Kinds if they had not been first encouraged and raised and supported by the Stage And 'tis very natural to conceive that several others who at the same time that they had large Revenues were qualified both by Nature and Art to excel in the other Kinds were rouzed and excited to try their Fortunes in them by the animating Applauses which they saw that our Dramatick Poets received from their ravish'd Audiences The Sentiment of  Virgil  might on such Occasions very naturally present itself to their Minds  Tentanda via est quâ me quoque possim  Tollere humo victorque virûm volitare per ora  And now  Sir  since the chief Encouragement not only of Plays but of every other Kind of the  British  Poetry which is none of the meanest Branches of the  British  Learning depends upon the Stage and consequently the Honour of  Great Britain  in some measure depends upon it I humbly conceive that the flourishing Condition of our Theatre is a Matter of Importance and publick Concern and not unworthy the Consideration of the greatest Men in the State  Since Dramatick Poetry was first introduced into  England  it never was sunk so deplorably low as it is at present and every other Branch of Poetry is declined proportionably I mean as far as it has been managed by most of those who have listed themselves under  Apollo  's Standard and who engage for their Pay That little that has appeared that  has been writ with more Spirit and more Grace than ordinary has come for the most Part from Volunteers  Sir  with Submission to your better Judgment there is but one Way of reviving the expiring Drama of restoring its original Innocence and of augmenting its ancient Lustre and that is by establishing two annual Prizes of two hundred Pound each the one for Comedy the other for Tragedy to be given besides the ordinary Profits of the Theatre to him who performs best in each of them which is to be decided by Judges appointed on purpose and sworn to determine impartially with this Proviso that no Play shall be received that shall be judged to be ever so little offensive to good Manners and that every Play shall be rejected whose Author can be proved to have taken the least Step towards the forming a Cabal which Design I humbly conceive is in your Power to reduce to Practice if you would vouchsafe to recommend it to the Government or to a Number of Gentlemen who may be every way qualify'd to engage in so good a Cause  Several Causes may be assigned of the Decay of Dramatick Peotry as the  Italian Opera  which never was established in any Country but it immediately debased the Poetry of that Nation The Strangers who have been introduced among us by several great Events as the  Revolution  the  Union  the  Hanover Succession  who not understanding our Language have been very instrumental in introducing Sound and Show the new Gentry that has started up among us some by the Fortune of War and some by the Fortune of  ExchangeAlley  who are fond of their old Entertainments of  JackPudding  but yet none of these has done half the Harm that has been done by  Cabal For 'tis in Poetry as 'tis in Politicks Things go quite wrong  When Merit pines while Clamour is prefer'd  And long Attachment waits among the Herd  When no Distinction where Distinction's due  Marks from the Many the superior Few  A Cabal to espouse a Coxcomb may get him Money but at the same Time it will procure him Infamy Writers who have Genius will leave the Stage with the utmost Indignation and every Man who understands it will have it in Contempt  The Men who contradict the publick Voice  And strive to dignify a worthless Choice  Attempt a Task that on that Choice reflects  And lend us Light to point out new Defects  One worthless Man that gains what he pretends  Disgusts a Thousand unpretending Friends  And therefore every Writer who pretends to succeed by Cabals ought to be banished from every Theatre But to shew the Judgment or the Integrity of our Managers of the Stage they have for several Years past rejected every Play that has not had a Cabal to support it  And now  Sir  tho' I am sensible that I have already detain'd you a great deal too long for which I humbly and heartily beg your Pardon yet before I take Leave of you I cannot help acquainting you that this is the fourth Time that I have appear'd in Defence of the Stage and in this fourth Defence I have no manner of Interest but that it has been purely extorted from me by the Force  of Truth and by the Love of my Country In the former Three I might appear to be maintaining my own Interests But I have since the publishing them been used with such extreme Ingratitude by the present Managers of the Playhouse that I have this Ten Years been obliged by the most barbarous Treatment to take Leave of the Playhouse for ever  I am SIR  Your most Obedient and most Humble Servant  JOHN DENNIS  The STAGE defended  c  To  Esq  SIR  _WHEN you desire to know my Sentiments concerning Mr  Law  's late Pamphlet against the Stage you make a Request which 'tis not so easy for me to satisfy as you may perhaps imagine For I really never was so much at a Loss to know what an Author meant Sometimes I am inclined to think him in good earnest and sometimes I believe that there are Grounds to susbect that he design'd this whole Pamphlet for nothing but a spiritual Banter for there seems to me to be a Necessity of believing either that a Clergyman as Mr  Law  is should be profoundly ignorant of the sacred Writings a Man of Letters of the Nature of Dramatick Poems and one who had liv'd long enough in the World to have some Experience of the present State of Religion and Virtue and Vice among us or a Necessity of concluding  that while Mr  Law  is declaiming with so much furious Zeal against the Stage and Players he is all that while acting a Part and shewing himself a great Comedian  When Mr  Law  is putting Idolatry and frequenting the Playhouse upon an equal Foot he seems to be playing a Part for he cannot but know that St  Paul  was of another Mind who when he was at  Athens  the very Source of Dramatick Poetry said a great deal publickly against their Idolatry but not one Word against their Stage When he was afterwards at  Corinth  as little did he say against theirs For St  Paul  who was educated in all the Learning of the  Grecians  who had read all their Poets who in the vjth Chapter of the  Acts  Ver quotes  Aratus  and  Epimenides  in the first Chapter of his Epistle to  Titus  Ver could not but have read all their noble Dramatick Poems and yet has been so far from speaking one Word against them that he has made use of them for the Instruction and Conversion of Mankind And when afterwards he wrote his First Epistle to the  Corinthians  he did not scruple for their Instruction to make use of an  Athenian  Play for all the World knows that  Evil Communications corrupt Good Manners    Cor  xv is taken from an  Athenian  Dramatick Poet Does Mr  Law  believe that that Epistle and consequently that Verse was dictated by the Holy Ghost or not Can Mr  Law  believe that St  Paul  was guided by the Spirit of God to make Choice of that Verse for the Instruction▪ and Conversion of the  Corinthians  And can he believe at the same Time that the Theatre as he more than once declares  it is the Temple of the Devil If any one should affirm That St  Paul  was guided by the Spirit of God to take a Verse from the Temple of the Devil would it not be such horrid Blasphemy as would make even the Blood of the most profligate of all Players to curdle within the Miscreant's Veins But if St  Paul  had in the least believed that the  Athenian  Stage was the Sink of Sin and Corruption as Mr  Law  says every Stage is he would not have fail'd to reproach them with it in order to check the spreading Evil He who dares talk openly and boldly against the National Religion of a People may very well venture to condemn their Vices and evil Customs But St  Paul  not only says nothing at all against Dramatick Poetry but makes use of it for the Conversion and Reformation of Mankind Now I would fain know if quoting a Dramatick Poet without giving the least Caution against the Stage be not a downright Approbation of Dramatick Poetry and establishing the Stage by no lesser an Authority than that of the Spirit of God himself  If we look into the Old Testament we shall find that the Kings of  Israel  and  Judah  they and their Reigns were declared righteous or wicked according as those Kings were Idolaters or not Idolaters and that no Sin whatever was reckon'd so abominable as Idolatry  Solomon  who had seven hundred Wives had no less than three hundred Concubines and yet when God threatened to rend Ten Tribes of his Subjects from him it was only for his Idolatry  because he had forsaken God and had worshipped Ashtoreth the Goddess of the Sidonians Chemosh  the God of the Moabites and Milcom the God of the Children of Ammon  Kings xj  For it came to pass that when Solomon was old his Wives turned away his Hear after other Gods and his Heart was not perfect with the Lord his God as was the Heart of David his Father  ibid Ver Now  David  committed Adultery with  Bathsheba  and murdered her Husband  Uriah  yet these Sin that were of so flagrant a Nature that they brought a Plague upon  Israel  were venial compared to Idolatry They brought indeed a Plague upon the People but they deposed the King from no Part of his Subjects as the Idolatry of  Solomon  did his Son  Rehoboam  In short Idolatry is by so much more criminal than the Transgression of any other divine Commandment as the Attempt to depose a King and to set up a Pretender is a Crime of a higher Nature than the Breach of any other human Law  As it is hard to imagine that Mr  Law  should be ignorant of what has been said above it gave me just Cause to suspect his Sincerity But when I came to the Passage which he quotes from Archbishop  Tillotson  in the th Page of his Pamplet I found that he prevaricated so vilely in it that the Hypocrisy became immediately manifest For he has omitted the former Part of the Passage because it makes directly against him It is as follows  To speak against them    viz  Plays  in general may be thought too severe and that which the present Age cannot so well brook and would not perhaps be so just and reasonable because it is very possible they might be so framed and  governed by such Rules as not only to be innocent and diverting but instructive and useful to put some Vices and Follies out of Countenance which cannot perhaps be so decently reproved nor so effectually exposed and corrected any other Way  All this as I have said above he has purposely omitted because it makes point blank against him  For after he has told us in this blessed Pamphlet  That the Playhouse is the Temple of the Devil a more delightful Habitation for him than ever any Temple that he had in the Heathen World where Impurity and Filthiness immodest Songs prophane Rants Lust and Passions entertain the Audience a Place the peculiar Pleasure of the Devil where all they who go yield to the Devil go over to his Party and become Members of his Congregation where all the Laughter is not only vain and foolish but that it is a Laughter among Devils that all who are there are upon prophane Ground and hearing Musick in the very Porch of Hell  After he has bestow'd all this fine Language upon it and all these fragrant Flowers of Rhetorick he assures us that the Playhouse is all that he has said not thro' any accidental Abuse as any innocent or good Thing may be abused but by its genuine Hellish Nature which is directly contrary to what the foremention'd illustrious Prelate has said Mr  Law  says that every Entertainment of the Stage is in its Nature unlawful abominable and infernal The Archbishop assures us that the Entertainments of the Stage may be so managed as not only to be innocent but useful and instructive nay that they may even become necessary for the exposing some certain Follies and the correcting some certain Vices  As Mr  Law  has shewn his Want of Sincerity in the foresaid Quotation he gives us great Reasons to suspect it in his Invectives against the Drama For 'tis hard to conceive that a Man of Letters should be so ignorant of the Nature of a legitimate Dramatick Poem as those Invectives suppose him for 'tis such only that we pretend to defend and abhor the Productions of ignorant and impure Poetasters as much as he does 'Tis hard to conceive that a Man who has read the Classicks should not know that a legitimate Dramatick Poem either of the Comick or Tragick Kind is a Fable and as much a Fable as any one of  Aesop  's agreeing in Genus and differing only in Species  Terence  has told him in almost every one of his Prologues that every Comedy is a Fable and he begins his very first to  Andrea  with it  Poeta cum primum animum ad scribendum appulit  Id sibi negoti credidit solum dari  Populo ut placerent quas fecisset Fabulas  And  Horace  tells us the same Thing concerning Tragedy more than once or twice  Neve minor quinto neu sit productior actu  Fabula  De Arte Poet  And we find in the same Treatise  Interdam speciosa locis morataque recte  Fabula  And likewise again  Nec Quodcunque volet poscat sibi Fabula credi  Mr  Law  cannot but know that the Instruction by Fables and Parables which mean the same Thing was  mightily in Use among the wise Ancients and especially among the sacred Writers that we have an Example of it of about three thousand Years standing in the Parable of  Jothan  And that  Jesus Christ  who best knew the Nature of Men made use of Fables or Parables as most proper at the same Time both to please and instruct and perswade For a Fable is a Discourse most aptly contrived to form the Manners of Men by Instructions disguised under the Allegory of an Action And therefore he could not chuse but know that every legitimate Dramatick Poem either of the Comick or Tragick Kind is not a mere Diversion as he pretends but a philosophical and moral Lecture in which the Poet is Teacher and the Spectators are his Disciples as  Horace  insinuates in the three following Verses  Nec minimum meruere Decus vestigia Graeca  Ausi deserere celebrare Domestica Facta  Vel qui Praetextas vel qui docuere togatas  And knowing all this he could not but know that 'tis very hard if not very extravagant to put the frequenting moral Lectures upon the same Foot with Idolatry  If Mr  Law  has read either  Aristotle  or any of his Interpreters as 'tis hard to imagine that he should think himself qualified to write against the Stage if he had read none of them he cannot but know that as the Action of a Dramatick Fable is universal and allegorical the Characters are so likewise For as when  Aesop  introduces a Horse or a Dog or a Wolf or a Lion he does not pretend to shew us any singular Animal but only to shew the  Nature of that Creature as far as the Occasion where it appears admits of so when a Dramatick Poet sets before us his Characters he does not pretend to entertain us with particular Persons tho' he may give them particular Names but proposes to lay before us general and allegorical Fantoms and to make them talk and act as Persons compounded of such and such Qualities would talk and act upon like Occasions in order to give proper Instructions  Now as a Dramatick Fable is a Discourse invented to form the Manners by Instructions disguised under the Allegory of an Action it follows that in a Dramatick Fable for the proving the Moral 'tis as necessary to introduce vicious as virtuous Characters and to make them speak and act as all Persons compounded of their Qualities would be obliged by Nature to speak and act upon the like Occasions as  Aesop  for the Sake of his Morals does not only introduce innocent and peaceable Creatures as Horses and Sheep and Cows and Dogs but likewise noxious and violent ones as Lions and Bears and Wolves and Foxes But the Poet at the same time ought to take care that the Vices should be shewn after such a Manner as to render them odious or ridiculous and not agreeable or desirable and that the Reader should reap no Pleasure from the Agreeableness of the Vices but only from a just Imitation of Nature  I make no Doubt Sir but that I have said enough to satifie you or any of your Friends to whom you may happen to shew this Letter that as every true Dramatick  Poem is a Fable as much as any one of  Aesop  's it has in its Nature a direct Tendency to teach moral Virtue and can therefore never be contrary to a Christian Temper and Cirit which whereever it is incites us to good Works that is to the Performance of moral Duties But there is every Jot as much Difference between a true Dramatick Poem and the Production of an ignorant obscene Poetaster as there is between two religious Books the  Bible  and the  Alcoran  Now will Mr  Law  affirm that because the  Alcoran  is full of egregious Falshoods and of monstrous Fanatick Extravagancies therefore we ought not to read the  Bible  It belongs to none but to an Atheist or some other unbelieving Sceptick to make such a Conclusion  Sir  As 'tis hard to conceive that Mr  Law  should be ignorant of what we have said above both concerning the sacred Writings and the Nature of a Dramatick Poem and equally hard if he is not ignorant to believe him a Writer of Sincerity and Integrity so it seems to be as hard to conceive that a Man of his Years and consequently of his Experience should be utterly a Stranger to the present State of Religion and Virtue and Vice among us or that if he is not a Stranger to it he should be capable of writing so malicious or so erroneous a Treatise as that which he has lately publish'd against the Stage  Before I come to speak of the present State of Religion among us I desire Leave to translate a Passage from  Dacier  's Preface to his excellent Comment on  Aristotle  's  Art of Poetry  If the Quotation appears to be of more than  ordinary Length to you I comfort my self with this Reflection that you will attend to an Author of more than ordinary Learning and Judgment and who can speak s much better in this Cause than myself  'Poetry says that most judicious Critick is an Art which was invented for the Instruction of Mankind and an Art which is by Consequence useful 'Tis a Truth acknowledg'd by all the World that every Art is in itself good because there is none whose End and Design is not so But as it is no less true that Men are apt to abuse the very best Things and to pervert the very best Designs that which was at first invented as a wholsome Remedy may afterwards become a very dangerous Poison I am obliged to declare then that in what I say of Tragedy I speak not of corrupted Tragedy For'tis not in Works that are deprav'd and vicious that we are to search for the Reason and the Design of Nature but in those which are sound and intire when I say this speak of ancient Tragedy of that which is conformable to the Rules of  Aristotle  which I dare pronounae to be the most useful and most necessary of all Diversions whatever'  'If it were in our Power to oblige all Men to follow the Precepts which the Gospel lays down nothing could be more happy for Mankind In living conformably to them they would find true Repose solid Pleasure and a sure Remedy for all their Infirmities and they might then look upon Tragedy as a useless Thing and which would be infinitely below them How could they look upon it in any other Light since the Heathens themselves  beheld it in the very same as soon as they had embraced the Study of Philosophy They confess that if People could be always nourish'd with the solid Truths of Philosophy the Philosophers had never had Recourse to Fables in order to give them Instruction But as so much Corruption could not bear so much Wisdom the Philosophers were obliged to look for a Remedy for the Disorder which they saw in Mens Pleasures for which they invented Tragedy and they offered it to the World not as the most excellent Thing of which Men could make their Employment and their Study but yet as a Means to correct those Excesses in which they were wont to be plunged at their solemn Feasts and to render those Diversions useful to them which Custom and their Weakness had render'd necessary and their Corruption very dangerous'  'What Men were formerly they are Today and what they are Today they will be hereafter they have the same Passions which they always had and run with the same Eagerness after Pleasure To undertake to reduce them in this Condition by the Severity of Precepts is endeavouring to put a Bridle on a mad Horse in the greatest Rapidity of his Course In the mean time there is no Middle Men will fall into the most criminal Excesses unless we find Pleasures for them which are wise and regular 'Tis some Degree of Happiness that a Remnant of Reason inclines them to love such Diversions as are consistent with Order and such Amusements as are not incompatible with Truth And I am persuaded that we are obliged in Charity to make our Advantage of this Inclination that we may not give  time to Debauchery entirely to quench that Spark of right Reason which still may be seen to glimmer in them We prescribe to distemper'd Persons and Tragedy is the only Remedy from which in their present Condition they can reap any Advantage for 'tis the only Diversion in which they can find the Profitable united with the Pleasant'  Thus far Monsieur  Dacier  And here  Sir  I beg Leave to observe that notwithstanding our Reformation we have as few Persons here in  England  who have the true Spirit of Christianity in them as there are in  France  But there is this Difference between them and us In  France  all own themselves Christians publickly none of them dare renounce the Name tho' few of them are the Thing But among us How many open Dissenters are there from Christianity itself How many Atheists How many Deists How many Freethinkers of a Thousand Kinds who all of them refuse to join in our sacred Rites some of them as the Atheists believing them to be sens lessand ridiculous and others as the Deists esteeming them to be blasphemous and idolatrous Then what School of publick Virtue and of publick Spirit have we for too great a Part of our Youth but our Theatres only  'Tis very strange that Mr  Law  should be so ignorant of the present State of Religion among us as not to foresee that the wild Enthusiasm and the spiritual Fanatical Rant which abounds so much in his late Pamphlet would afford Matter of Scorn and Laughter to Infidels and Freethinkers  of all Sorts and render our most sacred Religion still more contemptible among them  When Mr  Law  says in the th Page of his Pamphlet that  It cannot be doubted by any one that the Playhouse is a Nursery of Vice and Debauchery and that the Effect it has upon Peoples Manners is as visible as the Sun at Noon  he seems to know as little of the present State of Vice among us as he pretends to do of Religion The present reigning Vices of the Town are Drinking Gaming Cursing Swearing Prophaness Corruption of all Sorts as Bribing Tricking Oppression Cheating Whoring and execrable Sodomy And Mr  Law  forsooth has the Face to tell the World that the Playhouse encourages all these that it is the Sink of Corruption and Debauchery and that that is not the State of it thro' any accidental Abuse but that Corruption and Debauchery are the truly natural and genuine Effects of the StageEntertainment that is of any StageEntertainment Now to shew the Folly and the Arrogance of these Assertions let us consider these Vices one by one  First then Does the Theatre encourage Drunkenness No it neither does nor can encourage it To shew it is enough to render it odious or ridiculous To shew a Man drunk is to shew a Fool or a Madman in whom the Creator's Image is for a Time intirely defaced and who while he continues in that State stands in need of a Guardian Besides nothing is more certain than that brutal Vice rages most in the Scum and Offscowring of the People who neither have nor ever had the least Communication  with the Playhouse 'Tis true Men of Thought may be sometimes drawn into it but they naturally hate it for Drunkenness is a mortal Enemy to Thought and consequently Thought to that  Does the Playhouse encourage Gaming So far from that that Gaming has increased tenfold since  Collier  's Books against the Stage were published and since when whole Plays have been writ to shew it dangerous and destructive to shew the unspeakable Harm it does to both Sexes and particularly to the Women  to shew that Gaming by giving Men a Privilege of being familiar with and sometimes rude to Women removes that Awe which Nature has placed between the Sexes as the strongest Bulwark of Chastity that when a young Lady even of the strictest the most unblemish'd Honour loses a Sum of Money which she dares not own to her Relations and which she cannot pay without them and loses it to an agreeable young Fellow who perhaps loves her and has a secret Design upon her she finds a Temptation that trys her utmost Virtue  Does the Playhouse encourage Swearing and Cursing Both Reason and Experience assure us that it does not They who walk the Streets in the West End of the Town may be sufficiently convinced that it rages most in the Lees of the People who never knew what a Playhouse was It infects even their Wives and their Children as it very rarely does those of the better Sort As common Swearing is a foolish brutal Vice that brings neither Pleasure nor Profit with it and is the Result of want of Thought it follows that the foolish brutal Part of the People must be  most infected with it Of the Women that frequent the Playhouse few are addicted to it but the common Strumpets and of the Men none but Bullies Rakes and giddy Coxcombs If a Comick Poet draws any of these in order to correct and amend them he is obliged to shew them sometimes Swearing or he leaves out one of their Characteristicks But he cannot fail of shewing that very Quality either odious or ridiculous when it appears in Persons who are themselves both the one and the other And if he shews it either odious or ridiculous that surely will invite none of the Audience to imitate it  We equally deny that the Playhouse encourages any other Sort of Prophaness But as a Play is a Fable that is a Composition of Truth and Fiction as we have observed above as the Action is feigned and the Moral true as Characters are necessary for the carrying on the Action and or proving the Moral and vicious Characters as necessary and perhaps sometimes more necessary than are the good ones as to shew vicious Characters and to expose them 'tis absolutely necessary to put vicious Sentiments into their Mouths it follows that the most criminal Sentiments and the most violent Passions are allowable in vicious and violent Characters the most ungovern'd Fury and the most outragious Blasphemy itself not excepted provided they are adapted to the Character and the Occasion and the Character and the Occasion are necessary for the Moral  Virgil  has every where shewn  Mezentius  a Contemner of the Gods and a Blasphemer of them yet we never heard that the most bigotted of his Cotemporaries ever accused  Virgil  upon that Account  Milton  in the second Book of  Paradice lost  makes the Devils in their infernal Council blaspheme in a most outragious Manner and yet as they speak agreeably to their Characters and the Occasion no Man has ever been so weak or so unjust as to accuse  Milton  for that Blasphemy or to give all his Readers to the Devil for being entertained with it On the contrary all Men of good Understanding and good Taste have been peculiarly charm'd with that very Book as one of the most beautiful of that admirable Poem  Cowley  makes not only the Devil but  Goliah  blaspheme  Thus he blasphem'd aloud The Hills around  Flatt'ring his Voice restor'd the dreadful Sound  and yet has been never blamed for it The Book of  Job  is canonical and is firmly believed to have been writ by divine Inspiration Tho' it is full of uncharitable Judgments and is not free from Blasphemy yet the Instructions which that divine Parable or Fable gives proceed in a great measure from that very Blasphemy and those uncharitable Judgments But now if a Poet is allow'd to put Blasphemy into the Mouth of one of his Characters provided he takes care to punish him for it he is certainly at Liberty to do the like by any inferior Prophaness  The Three Nonjuring Priests who have attack'd the Stage have made such a Noise about nothing as Prophaness it sometimes drops three or four Times in one Page from their tautologous Pens and they have chiefly accused our Comedies for it The Unreasonableness of which may appear from hence that all our true Comedies are but Copies of the foolish or vicious Originals of the  Age Certainly never Man knew what a Comedy was better than did  Moliere  Now when in the Critic of the  Ecole des Femmes  he is endeavouring to prove by the Mouth of  Dorante  that Comedy is harder to write than Tragedy he gives the following Reason for it  Lors que vous peignez des Heros vous faites ce que vous voulez ce sont des Portraits a plaisir ou l'ou ne cherche de ressemblance et vous n'avez qu'a suivre les Traits d'une Imagination qui se donne l'essor et qui souvent laisse le vrai pour atraper le  Merveilleux  Mais lors que vous peignez les Hommes il faut peindre d'apres Nature on veut qui ces Portraits ressemblent et vous n'avez rien fait si vous n'y faites reconnoitre le Gens de votre Siecle  That is to say When you draw Heroes you are at your own Liberty those are Pictures at the Painter's Pleasure in which no Body looks for Likeness and you have nothing to do but to indulge the Flight of a soaring Imagination But when you paint Men you must draw after Nature the World expects that those Pictures should be like and you have done nothing at all unless you shew your Readers or your Spectators the People of the Age you live in  Now with Regard to Prophaness our Comedies are the faintest Copies in the World and you may often hear more Prophaness in one Night's Conversation at a Tavern or an Eatinghouse than you shall hear from the Stage in a year For Atheists Deists Arians and Socinians are wont to say at their private Meetings what no one dares to pronounce on the Stage Now are not these Nonjuring Priests either very wise or very conscientious Persons Our Comedies are but Copies of the foolish and vicious Originals  of the Age and 'tis the Business of the Copies to expose and satyrize and ridicule those foolish and those vicious Originals Now these Nonjuring Priests having nothing to say against those foolish and those vicious Originals which most certainly corrupt and debauch the Age make it their Business to fall foul on the Copies which chastise and satyrize and ridicule the Originals  What I have said of the Stage with Relation to Prophaness is in Proportion true with Regard to all other Vices Now since our Comedies are but Copies of the foolish and the vicious Originals of the Age in which we live and Copies which do by no means come up to the Originals I appeal to all the World if it does not unanswerably follow from what I have said that the Originals of the Age debauch the Stage by which latter the Age never possibly can be debauched The Stage was establish'd in  England  towards the Beginning of Queen  Elizabeth  's Reign whereas the Manners of the People continued generally sound till beyond the Middle of the last Century▪ And the Manners of the People continuing generally sound the Stage remain'd generally chaste But at the Restoration of  Charles  the Second the Court returning from abroad corrupted by foreign Luxury quickly debauch'd the Town and the Court and the Town jointly endeavour'd to debauch the Stage because our Comick Poets were obliged to copy their lewd Originals in order to expose and reform them  As for Corruption of any Sort whether it be Tricking Oppressing Bribing Sharping Cheating the true Poet  who  perfectly free from all Avarice is least of all addicted to it  Vatis Avarus  Non temere est animus versus amat hoc studet unum  Detrimenta fugas servorum incendia ridet  Non fraudem socio puerove incogitat ullam  Pupillo  Horace Epist ad Augustum  Their usual Poverty is a signal Proof of this For as the Love of Money is the Source of all Corruption he who despises Gold is above all the Vices that attend it And Poverty attended with great Parts may very well pass for a pretty sure Sign of Honesty A Dramatick Poet therefore being averse from all Corruption himself if ever he describes any Kind of it is sure to make it both odious and ridiculous  I come now to almost the only Charge against the Stage which seems to have any thing of real Weight in it and that is That it excites in Mens Minds the natural Love of Women And here by this Charge may be meant two Things the one is That it excites in Men a Desire to the unlawful Enjoyment of Women the other is That it inclines them to that violent Passion of Love which is sometimes between the two Sexes  As to the first Part of the Charge that it excites in Men a Desire to the unlawful Enjoyment of Women if there are any Passages in our Plays that are chargeable with that Guilt or that defile the Imaginations of an Audience with unchast and immodest Images they are neither  natural to the Drama nor necessary but flagrant Abuses of it and contrary to the very Design of the Art and those Passages ought to be banish'd from the Stage for ever And yet I cannot help thinking that if ever those Passages could be excusable they would be so at this Juncture when the execrable Sin of Sodomy is spread so wide that the foresaid Passages might be of some Use to the reducing Mens Minds to the natural Desire of Women Let Fornication be ever so crying a Sin yet Sodomy is a Crime of a thousand times a deeper Dye A Crime that forc'd down supernatural Fire from Heaven to extinguish its infernal Flames a Crime that would have obliged even righteous  Lot  to prostitute his two chast and virgin Daughters in order to prevent it I cannot here omit observing one Thing That this unnatural Sin has very much increased since  Collier  's Books were publish'd against the Stage There were no less than four Persons condemned for it the last Sessions and I am inform'd that several more have been since apprehended for it The like of which was never heard of in  Great Britain  before  As for the Passion of Love by which the Hearts of Men and Women are sometimes mutually and violently inclined to each other if the Passion is kept within the Bounds of Nature if the Object and the Intention of it is lawful or if 'tis punish'd when 'tis unlawful I am of the Opinion that it cannot have the least ill Consequence 'tis certainly a Check upon wandring loose Desires it gives a very great and very harmless Pleasure and has a direct Tendency to the keeping the two Sexes stedfast and firm to the natural Love of each other For not only the Affections of  the Men have wildly wander'd from Nature as is manifest to all the World but not a few of the Women too have endeavour'd to make themselves the Center of their own Happiness St  Paul  is pleas'd to reprove this unnatural Affection of the  Roman  Dames in the first Chapter of his Epistle to the  Romans  And Mr  Law  is desired to take Notice that he lays those unnatural Desires not upon their going to Plays but upon their Idolatry Verse  Professing themselves to be wise they became Fools  Verse  And changed the Glory of the incorruptible God into an Image made like to corruptible Man and to Birds and fourfooted Beasts and creeping Things  Verse  Wherefore God also gave them up to Uncleanness to dishonour their own Bodies between themselves  Verse  Who changed the Truth of God into a Lie and worshipped and served the Creature rather than the Creator who is blessed for ever Amen  Verse  For this Cause God gave them up to vile Affections For even their Women did change the natural Use into that which is against Nature  Verse  And likewise the Men leaving the natural Use of the Women burned in their own Lusts one toward another Men with Men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that Recompence of their Errors which was meet  And Mr  Law  may be pleased to observe that the Apostle here gives us another signal Proof that he does not put Idolatry and going to Plays upon an equal Foot And here  Sir  I desire Leave to make another Remark and that is That of all the Countries of the Christian World that Country has been is and is like to be the most infamous for this execrable Vice in which Idolatry has set up its Head Quarters  Sir  You are very well acquainted with the exact Judgment of the late  French  Satyrist who was an Honour to  France  That he was very far from being a Friend to the Corruption of the Stage will appear from the following Passage of the fourth Canto of his  Art of Poetry  where he is giving his Advice to the Poets who were his Cotemporaries  Que votre ame vos moeurs peints dans tous vos ouvrages  N'offrent jamais de vous que de nobles Images  Je ne puis estimer ces dangereux Auteurs  Qui de l'honneur en vers infames deserteurs  Trahissant la vertu sur un papier coupable  Aux yeux de leurs Lectures rendent le vice aimable  Tho' I know very well that no one understands this Author better than you do yet as this Letter is to pass thro' your Hand to the Press I desire Leave to translate the Passage for the Benefit of those who are not used to  French  Let your Soul and your Manners appearing in your Works to your Readers never offer any but noble Ideas of you I can have no Esteem for those dangerous Authors those infamous Deserters of Honour in their Verses who being Traytors to Virtue in their guilty Lines render Vice lovely to the Eyes of those who peruse them  And yet immediately after comes his Approbation of Love in Dramatick Poems  Je ne suis pas pourtant de ces tristes Esprits  Qui bannissant l'Amour de tous chastes êcrits  D'un si riche ornement veulent priver la Scene  Traitent d'empoisonneurs Rodrigue Chimene  L'amour le moins honneste exprimé chastement  N'excite point en nous de honteux movement  Didon a beau gemir m'étaler ses charmes  Je condamne sa faute en partageant ses larmes  And yet  says he  I am none of those splenetick Souls who banishing Love from all chaste Composures endeavour to deprive the Stage of so rich an Ornament The most dishonourable Love if 'tis chastly express'd excites no shameful Motion in us In vain does  Dido  lament and groan exposing all her Charms to me I condemn her Conduct at the very Time that I partake of her Grief  I now return to the Charge of Hypocrisy for which there are very just Grounds of Suspicion from the Stile and Language of this Pamphlet For is not this little Treatise which is pretended to be writ thro' a Zeal for the Christian Religion writ in downright Antichristian Language Is this Pamplet writ in the Language of Modesty of Humility of Meekness Is it writ in the attractive Language of Charity On the contrary Does not Mr  Law  seem to have taken all his Degrees at a certain University between the Bridge and the Tower And as the Disciples of our Saviour from Dealers in Fish became the Apostles of their Master this false Apostle seems to set up for Water Doctor and from a Priest to become a Dealer in Fish For he has not only the Tropes and the Figures and all the Rhetorical Flowers but the very Tautologies of those obstreperous Dealers in quiet and mute Animals For the foresaid obstreperous Dealers are not contented with calling Rogue or Whore or Bitch or Villain once  they will repeat it fifty Times and their FellowCollegiate who disputes with them will return it fiftyfold  I desire that you would give me leave to present you with some of Mr  Law  's Rhetorical Flowers  At the Bottom of the second Page of his Pamphlet he tells us That there is more to be said in Behalf of Popery than of going to Plays For that is plainly his Meaning tho' he disguises it by the Terms that he uses And towards the Top of the third Page he is no less positive that God is less displeased with Popery than he is with going to Plays It looks as if Mr  Law  would be very glad to exchange Plays for Popery  In all the rest of the second Page he puts them upon an equal Foot and assures us that the Entertainment of the Stage is contrary to more Doctrines of Scripture than the Worship of Images  What tho' we grant it Intemperance in Eating Drinking and Venery is contrary to more Doctrines of Scripture than is either Murder or HighTreason and yet either Murder or HighTreason singly is ten Times a greater Sin than all the forementioned Three together Sometimes he is making Idolatry that is Popery less criminal than going to Plays Sometimes he is for making them equal and endeavouring to revive the old stoical Opinion  Omnia peccata sunt aequalia  All Sins are equal A Paradox that would tend to make Christianity as ridiculous as it help'd to do  Pagan  Stoicism  In the first Paragraph of the th Page  You go to hear Plays you sayI tell you  says Mr  Law    you go to hear Ribaldry and Prophaness that you entertain your Mind with extravagant Thoughts wild Rant blasphemous Speeches wanton Amours prophane Jests and impure Passions  Ay now the Language of the College begins And a little lower  He who goes to a Play diverts himself with the Lewdness Impudence Prophaness and impure Discourses of the Stage  And a little lower in the same Page  This is plainly the Case of the Stage it is an Entertainment that consists of lewd impudent prophane Discourses  And Pag  It is an Entertainment made up of Lewdness Prophaness and all the extravagant Rant of disorder'd Passions  At the Top of Page he is endeavouring once more to make Popery less sinful than going to Plays and by the same Piece of spiritual Sophistry he confirms this religious Lie because forsooth the Stage with its  lewd prophane Discourses  offends against more Doctrines of plain Scripture than Popery Which is proving one gross Piece of Falshood by another that is much greater  About the Middle of the same Page he brings an Argument against the Stage from the Iniquity of the Players against whom he inveighs with his usual Sophistry and Uncharitableness Which is full as wise and as just as it would be to bring an Argument against the Church from the Vices of some spiritual Comedians  The Players are Men and Women  says he  equally bold in all Instances of Prophaness Passion and Immodesty whose Business  Pag  is prophane wicked lewd and immodest  and a little lower in the same Page  whose Employment is less Christian than that of Robbers  For he must know very little of the Nature of Religion  says Mr  Law    who can look upon Lust Prophaness and disorder'd Passions to be less contrary to Religion than the taking Money from the right Owner  Which is directly contrary to common Sense and to common Utility  Queis paria esse fere placuit peccata laborant  Cum ventum ad verum est sensus moresque repugnant  Atque ipsa utilitas justi prope mater aequi  Hor  Page He speaks of  the Blasphemy Prophaness Lewdness Immodesty and wicked Rant of Plays  And a little lower in the same Page he mentions  a Collection of all the wicked prophane blasphemous lewd impudent detestable Things that are said in the Playhouse  And Page he speaks of the Entertainment of the Stage  as it consists of LoveIntrigues blasphemous Passions prophane Discourses lewd Descriptions filthy Jests and all the most extravagant Rant of wanton profligate Persons of both Sexes heating and inflaming one another with all the Wantonness of Address the Immodesty of Motion and the Lewdness of Thought that Wit can invent  And here I desire Leave to say a Word by the way in Defence of Players whose Profession he very wisely humanely and Christianly makes as unlawful as that of Robbers Is he to be told at this Time of Day that the Players say nothing of Themselves They only speak what the Poet puts into the Mouths of his universal allegorical Fantoms which Fantoms the Players represent Can this poor Gentleman be so simple as to believe that  Reynard    Bruin    Isgrim  and  Grimalkin  say really of themselves the  Things that  Aesop  puts into their Mouths The Players are only the Poet's Instruments by which he carries on his Action and proves his Moral If any Musician sings a treasonable Song and plays to it at the same time he ought to suffer for his Crime but would you indict the Fiddle or the Flute upon which the Tune is play'd  What Turn Mr  Law  design'd to serve by being so profuse of so much fine Language he best can tell tho' we perhaps may guess But he could never possibly think of making Poets or Players or Spectators good Christians by railing at them for an Hour together and treating them worse than the great Archangel dared to treat the Devil  who durst not bring against him a railing Accusation but only said The Lord rebuke thee  If he design'd to convert People by such a Proceeding he might as well pretend to begin a Friendship with another by abusing him and throwing Dirt at him  But to make some Amends for treating his FellowCreatures with so much Antichristian Language he uses the Devil with a great deal of Respect and Civility For besides the gentle Terms in which he speaks of him of his Honour of his Glory of his Joy his Delight his Pleasure his peculiar Pleasure as if Damnation were an honourable and a happy State besides this I say he is pleased out of his great Bounty to settle upon him and his to have and to hold for ever the Freehold and FeeSimple of all our Theatres  One may with the same Assurance affirm  says he  that the Playhouse not only when some prophane Play is on the Stage but in its daily common  Entertainments is as certainly the House of the Devil as the Church is the House of God  Page And a little lower in the same Page  The Manner and Matter of StageEntertainments is as undeniable a Proof and as obvious to common Sense that the House belongs to the Devil and is the Place of his Honour as the Matter and Manner of Church Service prove that the Place is appropriated to God  Now my Opinion is That if the Devil should once become the HeadLandlord of our Theatres he would immediately turn them into so many  Jacobite  Conventicles For those are properly his Houses those are properly his Temples For the Sins which the Theatres are accused by Mr  Law  of encouraging are not the Devil's Sins but our own the Sins of Men and Women The Devil neither drinks nor whores nor games nor rants nor gormandizes But the Sins which are carried on in a  Jacobite  Conventicle are the Devil's own Sins his two great original Sins Lying and Rebellion There all those false Doctrines are carried on of Hereditary Right Divine Right Indefeasible Right Absolute Power Uncontroulable Power Passive Obedience Unconditional Obedience Doctrines invented on purpose to make and flatter Tyrants who are the Devil's Viceroys  For as good Kings are God's Vicegerents sure a Tyrant is Hell's Viceroy  The Place where the Pretender's Cause is carried on is properly the Temple of the Devil the original Pretender  When Mr  Law  affirms That the Playhouse is the Sink of Corruption and Debauchery Page and that this is not the State of it thro' any accidental Abuse as any innocent  or good Thing may be abused but that Corruption and Debauchery are the truly natural and genuine Effects of the Stage Entertainments is it possible that he can be so ignorant as he pretends to make himself Can he be ignorant that by affirming this he contradicts what has been the common Sense of Mankind for two thousand Years and that he contradicts the Opinions and the Judgments of the greatest and wisest and most virtuous Men of the greatest and wisest and most virtuous Nations during that vast Space of Time If Corruption and Debauchery were the natural and genuine Effects of Theatrical Entertainments would they have been encouraged by the great Legislators the most learned Philosophers and the wisest Rulers of the freest States in the World  No Body knows better than Mr  Law  that of all publick Diversions the Drama is the most reasonable manly noble and instructive Diversion the excelling in which shews the Excellence and the Strength of Genius of that particular Nation where it appears and by that Means advances its Reputation with other Nations and augments its Power and that therefore Dramatick Performances have been so cherished and esteemed by the wisest Rulers of the noblest Nations that they have been maintain'd by the publick Treasure and the Magistrate has not thought it at all below him to have the Regulation and the immediate Inspection of it Which is an undeniable Proof that they did not at all mistrust that it was natural to those Entertainments to corrupt and debauch their People  The Drama is in itself so excellent and to excel in it requires so many great Qualities that of all the Nations we hear of among the Ancients but Two were capable of proper constant Theatrical Entertainments and those Two were the wisest bravest and most virtuous of all the Nations so famous for their great Actions in War and so illustrious for the Arts of Peace that to know what they were is become a principal Part of the Learning of us Moderns and 'tis accounted scandalous in a Gentleman to be ignorant of what they said and wrote and did and yet to know what their Tragick and Comick Poets were and what they wrote is none of the meanest Branches of that very Learning  What Opinion the  Grecians  themselves had of their Drama how far they believed their Tragick Poets able to inspire their Countrymen with the Love of their Country with the Love of Liberty of Virtue and of true Glory and with a magnanimous Contempt of Death for the publick Good may be gathered from the unanimous Consent of  Greece  and particularly from the Honours done by the  Athenians  to their Tragick Poets who made them Governors of Provinces Generals of their Armies and Guardians of the publick Liberty For when the  Athenians  settled a greater Fund for the supporting the Magnificence of their Tragick Representations than for the Maintenance of their Fleets and Armies we may justly conclude that it was their Opinion that their Tragick Poets by constantly setting before them the Calamities of Tyrants defended them from far more dangerous Enemies than those which their Armies were sent to encounter and that was from  their own aspiring Citizens As no People were ever more jealous of their Liberties than the  Athenians  none ever knew better that Corruption and Debauchery are inconsistent with Liberty and therefore it never in the least enter'd into the Thoughts of that great People that Corruption and Debauchery were the natural Effects of Dramatick Entertainments  Nor can it be objected with any manner of Justice that it was the Fury of the  Athenian  Populace running mad after their Pleasures that made them so warmly espouse the Drama The greatest and the wisest Philosophers of that renown'd Republick declared most warmly and most loudly for it  Aristotle  writ an admirable System of Rules for the composing Dramatick Poems with that Right Hand that has given us so many excellent Lessons of Morality And  Socrates  the wisest and the most virtuous of all the Philosophers who made it the whole Business of his Life to instruct his Countrymen in moral Virtue did not think it in the least below his Wisdom and his Virtue to assist  Euripides  in the writing his Tragedies  That the  Romans  did not yield to the  Grecians  in the Esteem which they had for Dramatick Entertainments and the Belief that they were capable of contributing to the Glory and the Felicity of a mighty State and to the Glory and Felicity of the Authors of them we may gather from the Actions of their wisest Statesmen their greatest Captains and their severest Philosophers Their greatest Captains and their wisest Statesmen not only encouraged Dramatick Poems but vouchsafed to write them themselves  Scipio  the wise the virtuous  Scipio  writ Comedy with that conquering Hand that won the Empire of the World at  Zama Augustus Caesar  as famous for the Arts of Peace as his Success in War renown'd for the wholsome Laws he enacted and for his reforming the Manners of the People begun the Tragedy of  Ajax  tho' he could not finish it but found it easier to make himself Emperor of the World than a great Dramatick Poet  Cicero  the Champion of the  Roman  Liberties in twenty Places of his Philosophick Treatises quotes the  Roman  Tragick Poets And  Seneca  who thro' the Opinion which  Agrippina  had of the Strictness and the Severity of his Virtue was intrusted with the Education of a Prince upon whose Conduct the Happiness of Mankind depended  Seneca  who by so many admirable Lessons of moral Virtue has obliged all the Lovers of Wit and Virtue for ever did not think writing Tragedy an Employment at all below him  Now  Sir  I appeal to you whether it does not logically and necessarily follow from what has been said that either Mr  Law  must believe that the Great Men among the ancient  Grecians  and  Romans  their Captains Statesmen and Philosophers wanted common Sense or he cannot possibly believe that Corruption and Debauchery are the natural Effects of Theatrical Entertainments and consequently must be guilty of very vile Hypocrisy  There remains another strong Presumption of Hypocrisy against Mr  Law  For what is Mr  Law  And what are his two Predecessors  Collier  and  Bedford  who attack'd the Stage before him Why  Jacabite  Nonjuring Parsons all  three of them who have disown'd our Establish'd Church and disown'd our Government How come they to take up this great Concern for our Salvation in a Matter about which all our Pastors who have the immediate Care of our Souls are silent Have they more Capacity to see the enormous Crimes of Theaters and the pretended fatal Consequences of them than so many great and good Men who have been the exalted Lights of the Church since the Restoration No all the World knows that there is not the least Pretence for it nor the least Comparison Have they more true Zeal and Concern for the Christian Religion No that as we observed above is inconsistent with their Manner of treating us The Language of  Billingsgate  can never be the Language of Charity nor consequently of Christianity Truth has not the impetuous stormy Air which Mr  Law  assumes but comes in the soft and still Voice like the God who inspires it and Truth detests and abominates the Equivocating and Prevaricating of Mr  Collier  and Mr  Bedford  But now let us consider the Time that these People have chose to exert their pretended Zeal It has been always when something has been about to be done which it was thought might prove favourable to the  Pretender  Mr  Collier  publish'd his  Short View  when  France  declar'd for the  Chevalier  upon the Death of  James  II and his  Dissuasive  upon the great Storm when the great Devastation which that Huricane wrought had amaz'd and astonish'd the Minds of Men and made them obnoxious to melancholly and desponding Thoughts I formerly expos'd the egregious hypocritical Folly of making that Storm a Divine  Judgment upon the Nation for the Enormities of our Theatres Mr  Law  has taken the Opportunity to attack the Stage upon the great Preparations which he heard were making abroad and which the  Jacobites  flatter'd themselves were design'd in their Favour As for Mr  Bedford  's  Serious Remonstrance  tho' I know nothing of the Time of publishing it yet I dare to lay Odds it was either upon the Duke  D'Aumont  's being at  SomersetHouse  or upon the late Rebellion Now all these Attacks upon the Stage have been Attacks upon the Government and those three worthy Persons seem to me to have been at the Beck of some certain Superiors and always ready at their Command to divert the People of  Great Britain  from their real Danger by giving them Alarms in a wrong Place  FINIS  ERRATA  P last Line but one a after Experience
