 A SERMON Preach'd to the People AT THE  Mercat Cross  OF Edinburgh On the Subject of the Union  Eccles Chap Ver  Printed in the Year MDCCVL  A SERMON Preach'd to the People At the Mercat Cross of  Edinburgh  Eccles Chap X Ver  Better is he that Laboureth and aboundeth in all Things than he that boasteth himself and wanteth Bread  DEarly Beloved CountryMen and fellow Citizens suffer me to stop you a little in the furious Carreer of your Passion to hear a few Words of sober and unprejudiced Reason I hope they will not be the less gratefull if I accost you in that manner of Rhetorick which your Ears are most accustomed to I have chosen an Apocryphal Text because my Subject is not Sacred but Secular but if it has not the Stamp of divine Inspiration it is taken from a Book which of all that are not Canonical contains the most sublime most useful and most approved Maxims of Wisdom whether private OEconomical or Political and as all Wisdom and Truth cometh from God in that Sense my Text may be said to be of divine Authority  Dearly beloved CountryMen a Generous Powerful and Victorious Nation invites you to an intimate Union with themselves a Nation whose Laws are more Just whose Government is more Mild whose People are more Free Easy and Happy than any other in  Europe  a Nation who by their Wealth Wisdom and Valour have broke the most formidable Power that ever threatned  Christendom  To whose victorious Arms even you your selves owe your present Security this Nation I say invites you to a Copartnership of all the Advantages they presently Enjoy or may reasonably hope for A gracious Queen of the ancient Line of our own Monarchs desires nothing more than that the People from whom she derives her Blood should enjoy the same Liberty and Plenty with others whom Providence has called her to Govern It might justly have been expected that such a generous Proposal would have been wellcom'd with the universal Acclamations of all Ranks and Degrees of People instead of that you have received it with Riots Mobs and Tumults if the offer had not been Profitable it was at least Civil and deserv'd a friendly Reception and a courteous Answer A Treaty that was enter'd into at the desire of your own Parliament as well as that of your Neighbours and carried on by the Authority of the common Soveraign of both such a Treaty I say was a matter of that weight as made it a very unfit Subject for the Judgment much more for the Scorn and Contempt of Boys Apprentices and Tradesmen But since the transcendent Wisdom of your Leaders have thought otherways let me beseech you in the words of my Author  Eccles    Blame not before thou hast examined the Truth understand  first and then Rebuke  To enable you in some measure to make such an Enquiry I have chosen the words of my Text  Better is he that Laboureth and aboundeth in all Things than he that boasteth himself and wanteth Bread  From the words you may Observe a very intimate Conjunction betwixt three dismal Companions  Pride Poverty  and  Idleness  this is a worse Union a great deal than that which we are to Discourse of at present these three love extreamly to keep Company and I could never guess for what reason unless it be to Teaze and Vex one another  Poverty  does what she can to starve  Pride  and  Pride  eats out the Heart Blood and Gutts of  Poverty  and  Laziness  will not stir an Inch to relieve either That these three fatal Sisters may not only be separated but eternally Banish'd this Kingdom it shall be the Subject of my following Discourse to show that it's better to Encrease our Trade Manufacture and Riches by an Union with  England  than to boast of our Soveraignty and Starve  For better is he that Laboureth and aboundeth in all Things than he that boasteth himself and wanteth Bread  And here indeed it must be Prov'd that an Union with  England  will Encrease our Trade and Manufacture in order to which I will ask the greatest Zealote against the Union a few Questions and let him answer me if he can Whether the great difference betwixt the Wealth of  Scotland  and  England  is entirly Owing to the Natural Advantages of  England  as of fruitfulness of Soil Situation  c  Or if it does not in some measure proceed from political causes  Scotland  is equal at least in Extent to a Third of  England  its People more healthful more Prolifick and more Temperate why has  England  then seven times the Number of People every Acre in  Scotland  is not Barren nor every Acre in  England  fruitful how comes it then that  England  has Fifty times the Riches of  Scotland  For Example why does  Oxford  Shire not so big as  Fiffe  pay to a LandTax near as much as all  Scotland  Are there not many places on each side the Firth of  Forth  which exceed the Town of  Newcastle  in Soil Situation Products Natural and Artificial How comes it to pass then that the Town of  Newcastle  has more Trade more Rich Merchants and pays more Customs than all the Towns in  Scotland  put together It is plain these great differences do not proceed meerly from natural but likewise from Political Causes nay lt's easy to Assigne a piece of  England  equal in extent much Inferior to the Gifts of Nature of some part of  Scotland  and yet Triple in Value I know  Wales  is brought by some as an Instance to Prove that an Union will not encrease the Trade and Riches of a Mountanous Country that their Condition is not bettered by an Union with  England  To this I Answer that the matter of Fact is false if the Objection has any Strength it ought to Prove that  Wales  would not be the worse to be deprived of the Benefite of the Trade of  England  a Paradox too sublime for any  Welch  Man but most obvious to the Elevated understandings of some of our worthy Patriots dly I say the Comparison is not fairly stated betwixt the worst part of  England  and the best of  Scotland Wales  in many places does not Exceed the  Highlands  of  Scotland  in any thing except the height of the Mountains But setting aside all these things let us State the Comparison The Twelve very small Countys of  Wales  contain  Parishes Market Towns People and Pay  lib sterl  to the Land Tax which shows they are almost Equal to half the Number of People in  Scotland  and Pay near as much Taxes as the whole And it's known that  Wales  is more UnderRated in their Taxes and easier in the Excise than  Scotland  Thus you see it would be hard to find of the Richest Counties in  Scotland  to compare with an equal Number and less extent of the worst in  England  which is as I said a Demonstration that the Riches of  England  is the Effect of Policy as much as of Nature And is it not as plain that the Protection of the same Laws the influence of the same Government the partnership of the same Plantations and of all other Priviledges Foregin and Domestick will much Better the Condition of  Scotland  There is hardly any subject of Trade of the Growth of  England  which we are totally deprived of and we have one Peculiar which kind Providence and Nature has afforded us tho we never had the Grace nor Industry to make use of it I mean our Fish thus we starve with that Commodity at our Doors from which our Neighbours the  Dutch  draw the very Foundations of their Wealth and Maritime Power Will you then still be fond of that ill Government and Management which even deprives you of the Provision that Indulgent Nature has thrown into your Mouths But some will say has not our Convention of Burrows Chosen Men Skil'd in the deepest Mysteries of Trade of Eminent Abilities and greater Integrity have not they told us that the Trade of  England  is  Unsupportable  that is Untollerable not to be endured which is as much as if they had said we have not Grandeur of Soul to Support so great Wealth and  Prosperity we must be Contented to Live like Pedlers whil'st  English  Merchants Live like Princes  Where is now your Pride Where is now your boastings  But say you again the same Convention of Burrows not not less Skilled in Politicks than in Trade have told us that the Trade of  England  is Precarious It is hard to Answer all the Unreasonable Fears and Jealousies of People Has  Wales  since their Union ever Complained of the Breach of one Article Is there any one Privilege that an  Englishman  Enjoy's which a  Welchman  is Deprived off Do all the other Counties Unite to Oppress  Yorkshire  There are indeed some unequalities of Taxes amongst themselves wherein they have thought fit not to depart from a Rule once Establish'd But this is so sar from being a Discouragement to  Scotland  That 'tis their greatest Security it shows how unwilling and uncapable a Parliament is to Recede from  Quota  's already Settled tho' unequal Besides Matters in a free Government never go with that Unanimity nor in a  British  Parliament will Parties ever be so unequally trim'd that it will not be in the Power of a lesser Number than the  Scots  Members to Cast the Ballance and if necessary so to preserve themselves from Oppression and 'tis highly probable that the Party of the  North  and  West  who are under Tax'd after an Union will be much Strengthn'd I shall add no more on this head but that  England  has Oppressed  Scotland  Ten times more since the Union of the Two Crowns than ever they will be able to do after the Union of the Two Parliaments But says the same Ingenious Convention to show their Skill in Political Arthmetick the Taxes of  England  are  Unsupportable  To this I Answer That it was hardly  ever known that a Nation was affraid of high Customs upon their Import and Consumpt when did that ever ruin any People That is just as if a Man should complain that he could not be Rich because he has not leave to spend his Money or that he will not accept of a Lairdship for fear of paying two Months Cess With those intolerable Customs the  English  Merchants live higher and acquire much greater Riches than ours do As for the Land Tax it can hardly ever be higher and will be often nothing or much lower than what we now pay Indeed the Encrease of Trade will be attended with an Encrease of Excise and the Benefit of the one will be much greater than the Damage of the other but then the Effect will not exceed the Cause with this advantage that all that is raised by the Publick beyond the present Sum by the  Articles of the Treaty  is to remain in the Country If after all you should want Money to pay your Taxes I can propose no better Expedient than that of the Gospel  Launcb out into the Deep and let down your Nets  and you may fetch your Tribute Money out of your Fishes for after an Union you will have Stock to Employ your People to Catch them and Vent for them when they are Catched  Another Objection is  That an Union with  England  will draw our People out of  Scotland  to the Metropolis of the Government and to the Plantations  To which I answer That after an Union there are many Reasons and Inducements for our People to stay at Home that do not subsist in the present State but not any one saving their attendance in the  British  Parliament to draw them Abroad how many People at present leave their Country for want of Employment I may say for want  of Bread is evident to every body that knows either  Scotland  or other Countries where multitudes of  Scots  are to be met with nay I appeal to every Family in the Kingdom if they have not Relations abroad some where or another and this is the chief Cause why  Scotland  notwithstanding the Health Temperance and Fruitfulness of the Inhabitants is under Peopled Now is it not extreamly probable that the Encrease of Trade would employ and keep many at Home that are now forc'd to seek their Bread in foreign Countries and not only so but when the restraint of the Laws of Trade is taken off the cheapness of Living and Manufacture will invite People from other Parts into  Scotland  particularly the  Scots  who are now settled in the  WestIndies  would chuse to purchase and establish their Families in their own Country not being any more restrained by Acts of Navigation from the returning their Effects thither  dly  If any  Scotsman  at present has a mind to settle in  England  the minute he sets his Foot on  English  ground he has the Privileges of an  Englishman  What then can intice him to leave his own Country after an Union more than before I should imagine he would be less tempted to do so because he can then have the same Privileges of Trade and all other Immunities in staying at Home which now he cannot have without going into  England  If you say that after an Union his access to Preferment in the publick Stations of the Government and consequently his Temptations to go to  London  will be greater That is an advantage for then he goes to get an Estate and not to spend one and he will readily Purchase in his own Country If our Gentry and Nobility have a mind to  spend their Estates at  London  I know no Law at present that restrains them only necessity which has no Law That indeed after an Union may be less many of our Nobility and Gentry are now continually at  London  a few to Govern some to Oppress many to Complain and all for Strife and Contention and suppose by their attendance on a  British  Parliament the Numbers of those should be doubled  Scotland  gets little by an Union if it is not able to discharge the Expence of Thirty Noblemen and Gentlemen at the rate of  l sterl  a Man and perhapes the times may not be so hard but some of them will carry more down than they brought up  Thus I think I have fully Answered this Objection which is so far from being of any weight that I must entreat you by the Kindness and natural Affection you bear to your dear Children and Relations by the Comfort of their Society and having them established amongst your selves in a flowrishing Condition by the Casualties and Dangers and by the unfortunate and fatal End which their strowling into foreign Countries often exposes them to By all these moving Arguments I beseech you to Embrace so fair an Opportunity of making them and your selves Happy for Ages to come for as the wise Man says  Eccl    It is a miserable life to go from House to House for where thou art a Stranger thou darest not opea thy Mouth thou shall Entertain and Feast and have no Thanks Moreover thou shall hear bitter Words these things are grieveous to a Man of Understanding  Thus I have gone throw my first Head and have prov'd that as clearly as the Sun shines at Noonday and I call the same Sun to Witness against your  matchless Ignorance and Stupidity if you reject so favourable an offer of  Liberty Peace and Plenty  I proceed now to the second Part of my Text which is your boasting of your  Soveraignty must we loose That must we be no more a Kingdom  In the first place I would ask any reasonable Man Do we lose our Soveraignty in any other Sense than  England  does Is there not a new Title new Seal new Arms and the same changes for them as for us  For I take an Incorporating Union to be as if two pieces of Mettal were melted down into one Mass neither can be said to retain its former Form or Substance as it did before the Mixture  We can never be so unreasonable as to pretend to an equal Number of Representatives in a  British  Parliament when two Nations join in a common Assembly the most Powerful and most Numerous still will be the most Powerfull and most Numerous whatever Mettal exceeded before the Mixture the same will exceed in the Mass It is impossible to change the Nature of Things according to this way of reasoning it is not only impossible for  Scotland  ever to Unite with  England  but for any lesser Nation ever to Unite with a greater Why is it more Dishonourable for  Scotland  to Unite with  England  than it is for  England  to Unite with  Scotland  What is it that  Scotland  looses The Country the People are not Annihilated nor does an Union cause that all the worthy Deeds that have been done at any time by the  Scots  Nation or  Scotsman  are undone A  Welchman  would take it very unkindly if we should tell him that by his Union with  England  he has sulli'd the Glory and Antiquity of the ancient  British  Race None can have a greater value for noble Atchievements and Honour of our Ancestors  than I have but as for our Independency so much boasted of tho it be most certainly true in it self and undeniable in Law as well as justifiable from History yet at present it is in effect only Precarious Imaginary and Fantastical and is no more than the Privilege to be Govern'd by a Ministry under foreign Influence which I say not to insinuate the least Reflection on our present Ministry who have the Honour to Act a great part in putting an end to a Grievance so much complain'd of a Blessing perhaps in vain to be expected or lookt for at another time Can any Man be so destitude of common Sense as to think his  Liberty and Property  more safely and more honourably lodg'd in such Hands than in those of a  British  Parliament Now in lieu of this titular Soveraignty and imaginary Independency by an Union you acquire true and solid Power and Dominion to have Sixty Members in a  British  Parliament the twelfth share of disposing of  l  of Money which is the same with the sole Power of disposing of to have your Fleets and Armies Conquering Abroad the Arbitration of the Affairs of  Europe  your selves Represented in foreign Courts and Assemblies when had Sixty  Scotsmen  Affairs of that Importance laid before them To have your Nobility Peers of  GreatBritain  with their Persons and Reputations Sacred over the Island and their Lives only subject to the Inquest of a  British  House of Lords to have your Quota of the most eminent Posts of the Government of  GreatBritain  are not these things Substantial Power and Dominion preferable to the Triffles you now enjoy besides that the value of those will be encreased and is it not more eligible to have such a share both of  the Government of your selves and of  England  than to be managed by Favourites often contrary to your most apparent Int'rests  But all these Advantages may be obtain'd by a Faederal Union some say  it is an amazing thing to consider how People are Banter'd out of their Common Sense with meer Names and Chimeras to avoid Multiplicity of Words by a Faederal Union I suppose is meant that the  English  should Barter their Trade for our Settling of their Successor I would desire any Man who thinks such a bargain feazible to make the following Reflections in any Vote that ever past yet in  Scotland  against the Settling the Succession whether he thinks that  England  could not Purchase the Majority of that Difference at a Cheaper Rate than the Liberty of their Trade and Plantations let them ask the Consciences of those who Voted against the Settlement of the Succession if the hopes of a Faederal Union was the Motive that induc'd them to do so Let them ask those that Voted for it if they will Vote so no more till they have obtain'd it to show how unsincerly they deal who make this their pretence Many of these very Gentlemen will be Contented to Settle the Succession on any Terms But  ly  Where is there such a Faederal Union betwixt two Nations without a Common Assembly The Confederated Provinces and the Confederated Cantons have one where the Representatives of all the particular Bodies meet  dly  Can any Man believe that the  English  will mantain Plantations Garrison them and Defend them with their Fleets and Armies to let  Scots  who are at none of these Charges reap the Profite of the Trade will they Establish Customs and Duties  as the Rule of their Export Abroad and Consumption at Home and suffer the  Scots  to Trade without any Rule of Customs or no Customs High or Low as they please if they would do this it were no hard matter to have the Monopoly of their Trade this were a most Precious Jewel indeed and very well worth contending for But if such a Concession should be thought unreasonable I would desire in the next place to know how a commone expence in Mantaining and Providing for Forts Plantations and Factories can be Carried on without a common Thesaury and Government  And Lastly  if the  English  should allow us such a Priviledge can we be secure of it without we have our Representatives in their Parliament to take care of our Interest And can any man of Sense think that we should be more unsecure of our Priviledges when we have Members in their Assembly than when we have none when we are Domesticks than when we are Strangers In the former case nothing destroies our Privileges but what dissolves the Union for it is hardly possible to conceive that all the other Counties should Unite to hinder a  York  Shire Man to Trade to the Plantations when the Riches he acquires by his Trade goes to the Support of the Government of which they themselves are Members in the case of one Nation and one People it is indifferent to the Supreme Power in what part of Great  Britain  their Riches ly  I shall conclude this Article with the words of the wise Man  Eccl    The hopes of a Man void of Understanding are Vain and False and Dreams lift up Fools  I have set before you to day on one hand Industry and Riches on the other Pride and Poverty I have not required a blind assent to what I affirm I have not  Impos'd my opinion because 'tis fashionable or because such a Lord who is my Friend and Patron thinks so or because Mess  John  or Mess  James  said so or because my Drunken Companions Swear Damn them it is so I deal with you as reasonable Men and have purposely insisted on such Arguments as are obvious to the meanest Understanding I Conclude with a general Exhortation to all Ranks and Degrees of People to promote this Good Work it is manifestly the Interest of you LandedMen for the Encrease of Trade and Manufacture will double yea triple the value of your Estates by raising the Price of the Product and the number of the Purchassers besides your Lands being generally in the worst Repair that is the most improveable Condition and your Security by the use of a Register the best in the Island No doubt after the restraint of Laws is taken off Strangers will be encouraged to Purchase among you Why then will you chuse to live in a miserable moyling Condition paying high Interest for Money which LandRents cannot Discharge having no way to dispose of your younger Children but by sending them abroad into the wide World to seek their Fortunes whereas after the Conclusion of this great Affair you will have opportunities to employ them in Trade and Business and access according to Merit to the best Posts of  Great Britain  As for you  Tennents  the Necessity of your Masters is the occasion of your Poverty Trade will enable them to let longer Leases and you to take them and conform you in time to  English  Customs where Masters govern a free People and are duly payed their Rents and Tennents enjoy what remains with equal Security As for you  Tradesmen  the value of your Manufacture will be raised you will have the opportunity to dispose of it not only over all the Island but over all the World you are Ingenious Industrious and live Cheap what then can hinder you to be more Rich than those who have less of all these Qualities Where there are Hands to Work and Simples to work upon and Vent for the Manufacture it is impossible but there must be Trade if our own Stock is not sufficient you will be assisted by that of  England  the very novelty of the thing will in some measure contribute to this for all the Branches of Traffique in  England  being Traded bare where there are new Subjects of Trade Merchants will try new Projects their Interest will never suffer them to be partial to this or that Country but will send their Money where they can have the best Bargain And you Poor  Labourers  shall raise your Wages from Twopence to Twelvepence from Ten Pounds to a Hundred Pounds  You see the Objections used by the Opposers of an Union are either frivolous founded upon gross Falshoods or do plainly prove the contrary of what they are adduced for and I have that opinion of the Underderstanding of several of the AntiUniters that they do not so much as convince themselves they are only a Vail drawn over your Eyes to hide from you your present Poverty and Slavery and the glorious Prospect which an Union with  England  presents you with you are used only as Tools and Machines to bring about their factious and ambitious Designs However I shall beseech all such Gentlemen and Persons of Quality to consider that it is not a slight Matter to sacrifice the present and future Prosperity of their Country to an unreasonable  Humor to make a numerous People and their Posterity Beggars and Slaves for Ages to come and perhapes their Country a field of Blood by endeavouring to entall this upon their Neighbours as well as themselves or if they are sway'd with some Reason of less importance as the Treaty not being of their own Framing I desire them to consider that this is so very Childish that a Senator should be asham'd to own it if the pretty little Masters their Children should take their Fathers places in Parliament such a Reason would hardly be allowed to pass current among them An Union is a Matter of great Weight and Importance and very Good or Bad in it self if it is a bad Thing our most intimate Friends the Treaters can never recommend it If it is a good Thing it is so great a Good that we ought not to refuse it from those against whom our personal Resentments run highest Among the Opposers of the Union I know a great many Persons of Honour who have as true a Sense of Liberty and as great a concern for the Well are of their Country as any such need only lay aside some sew Prejudices and Reflections their Judgments will quickly inform them of the true value of the Proposal To such as are affraid of the Church and Religion I shall only say that the Religion of the Church of  England  is impos'd upon no Man within the Dominions of  England  as for the squeemishness of sitting in Parliament with Prelates and the fear of being Disarm'd of all other Weapons but what are allowed by the Gospel these are such unchristian Dissuasives from an Union that to mention them only is to refute them The putting an end to uncharitable and unreasonable Divisions about our triffling Differences in  Religion is one of the great Benefites  Scotland  will reap by this Union I am not so much terrified at the  Vision  of a noble Lord as he is himself but heartily wish to see a Plantation of as Rich  Jews  as any in  Amsterdam  as Rich  Independents Quakers  and  Anabaptisms  as any in  England  settled in all the Trading Towns of the Kingdom not but that I think all Motives that are not Penal ought to be used for their Conversion but would not have ChurchMen affraid of the encrease of their Manufacture for Hereticks are properly the Subject which they are to work upon to be affraid to live among Hereticks is to refuse the Task their Master has imposed upon them Their Predecessors the Apostles used to go at the hazard of their Persons to Preach the Gospel to the  Jews  they are affraid the  Jews  should come to them where they run no risque at all in attempting their Conversion In a word if any unjust Tyranny over the Persons Estates or Consciences of Men be the Motive which prevail with some to oppose this Union I would have such consider that to Govern a free People is a more noble and honourable Character than to Insult over Slaves and Beggars and if any such there be who hug their Chains and are fond of their Raggs and as a wretched People once did by the  Romans  refuse their Liberty when offered they are unworthy of so generous and beneficial a Proposal Lastly if this is only a Scuffle raised by the consederated Force of the  Skillin  and  Louis d' Or  let such consider that both of them are not to be put in the ballance with the  Guinea  which they may get by their Industry Consider then in this your Day the happy Condition of your Neighbouring Nation survey their  verdant Fields beautiful Plantations and sumptuous Gardens where Culture Art and Expences reign their populous and flowrishing Cities view the Magnificence of their publick Structures the neatness cleanliness conveniency and costly Furniture of their private Houses consider the Liberty and Plenty of their meanest Commons the comfortable Estates which even the basest of their Tradesmen leave to their Families the immense Riches of their Merchants the Grandure and Magnificence of their Learn'd Societies the prodigious Stocks of their TradingCompanies the unconquerable Force of their Fleets and Armies the Justice and exact Execution of their Laws and the wise Administration of their Government Ponder all these things and then sure you will not reckon them your Enemies who offer you a Partnership in so great Blessings but will conclude with the wise Man in my Text  Better is he that Laboureth and aboundeth in all Things than he that boasteth himself and wanteth Bread  FINIS
