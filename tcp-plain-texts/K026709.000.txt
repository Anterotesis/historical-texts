hope my dress and air  Announce the man of fashion and no player  Tho' gentlemen are now forbid the scenes  Yet have I rush'd thro' heroes kings and queens  Resolv'd in pity to this polish'd age  To

modern play  What shall a scribbling senseless woman dare  To your refinements offer such  coarse  fare  Is Douglas or is Percy fir'd wtth passion  Ready for love or glory death to dash on  Fit company for modern stilllife men of fashion  Such madness will our hearts but slightly graze  We've no such frantic nobles now adays  Heartstrings like fiddlestrings vibrate no tone  Unless they're tun'd in perfect unison  And youths of yore with ours can ne'er agree  They're in too  sharp  ours in too  flat  a key  Could we believe old stories those strange fellows  Married for  love  could of their wives be jealous  Nay constant to 'em tooand what is worse  The vulgar souls thought cuckoldom a curse  Most wedded pairs had then site purse one mind  One bed tooso preposterously kind  From such barbarity thank heav'n we're mu'ch refin'd  Old songs their happiness at home record  From  home they sep'rate carriages abhorr'd  One horse serv'd bothmy lady rode behind my lord  'Twas death alone could snap their bonds asunder  Now tack'd so slightly not to snap's the wonder  Nay death itself could not their hearts divide  They mix'd their love with monumental pride  For cut in stone they still lie side by side  But why these gothic ancestors produce  Why scour their rusty armour's What's the use  'Twould not your nicer optics much regale  To see us beaux bend under coats of mail  Should we our limbs with iron doublets bruise  Good heav'n how much courtplaister we should use  We wear no armour nowbut en our shoes  Let not with barbarism true taste be blended  Old vulgar virtues cannot be defended  Let the dead restwe living can't be mended  ADVERTISEMENT  The French Drama founded on the famous old Story of Raoul de Coucy suggested to the Author fome Circumstances in the former Part of this Tragedy  PERCY A TRAGEDY  ACT I  SCENE  A Gothic Hall  Enter  EDRIC  and  BIRTHA  BIRTHA  What may this mean Earl Douglas has injoin'd thee To meet him here in private  EDRIC  Yes my sister And this injunction I have oft receiv'd But when he comes big with some painful secret He starts looks wild then drops ambiguous hints Frowns hesitates turns pale and says' twas nothing Then feigns to smile and by his anxious care To prove himself at ease betrays his pain  BIRTHA  Since my short sojourn here I've mark'd this Earl  And tho' the ties of blood unite us closely  I shudder at his haughtiness of temper  Which not his gentle wife the bright Elwina  Can charm to rest Ill are their spirits pair'd  His is the seat of frenzy her's of softness  His love is transport her's is trembling duty  Rage in his soul is as the whirlwind fierce  While her's ne'er felt the pow'r of that rude passion  EDRIC  Perhaps the mighty soul of Douglas mourns  Because inglorious love detains him here  While our bold knights beneath the Christian standard  Press to the bulwarks of Jerusalem  BIRTHA  Tho' every various charm adorns Elwina  And tho' the noble Douglas doats to madness  Yet some dark mystery involves their fate  The canker grief devours Elwina's bloom  And on her brow meek resignation sits  Hopeless yet uncomplaining  EDRIC  'Tis most strange  BIRTHA  Once not long since she thought herself alone  Twas then the pentup anguish burst its bounds  With broken voice clasp'd hands and streaming eyes  She call'd upon her father call'd him cruel  And said her duty claim'd far other recompence  EDRIC  Perhaps the absence of the good Lord Raby  Who at her nuptials quitted this fair castle  Resigning it to her may thus afflict her  Hast thou e'er question'd her good Birtha  BIRTHA  Often But hitherto in vain and yet she shews me Th'endearing kindness of a sister's love But if I speak of Douglas  EDRIC  See he comes  It wou'd offend him shou'd he find you here  Enter  Douglas  How Edric and his sister in close conference  Do they not seem alarm'd at my approach  And see how suddenly they part Now Edric  Exit Birtha  Was this well done or was it like a friend  When I desir'd to meet thee here alone  With all the warmth of trusting confidence  To lay my bosom naked to thy view  And shew thee all its weakness was it well  To call thy sister here to let her witness  Thy friend's infirmityperhaps to tell her  EDRIC  My lord I nothing know I came to learn  DOUGLAS  Nay then thou dost suspect there's something wrong  EDRIC  If we were bred from infancy together  If I partook in all thy youthful griefs  And every joy thou knew'st was doubly mine  Then tell me all the secret of thy soul  "Or have these few short months of separation  "The only absence we have ever known  "Have these so rent the bands of love asunder  "That Douglas should distrust his Edric's truth"  DOUGLAS  My friend I know thee faithful as thou'rt brave  And I will trust sheebut not now good Edric  'Tis past 'tis gone it is not worth the telling  'Twas wrong to cherish what disturb'd my peace  I'll think of it no more  EDRIC  Transportihg news I fear'd some hidden trouble vex'd your quiet In secret I have watch'd  DOUGLAS  Ha watch'd in secret  A spy employ'd perhaps to note my actions  What have I said Forgive me thou art noble  yet do not press me to disclose my grief  For when thou know'st it I perhaps shall hate thee  As much my Edric as I hate myself  For my suspicions I am ill at ease  EDRIC  How will the fair Elwina grieve to hear it  DOUGLAS  Hold Edric holdthou hast touch'd the fatal string  That wakes me into madness Hear me then  But let the deadly secret be secur'd  With bars of adamant in thy close breast  Think of the curse which waits on broken oaths  A knight is bound by more than vulgar ties  And perjury in thee were doubly damn'd  Well then the king of England  EDRIC  Is expected From distant Palestine  DOUGLAS  Forbid it heaven For with him comes  EDRIC  Ah who  DOUGLAS  Peace peace For see Elwina's here Retire my Edric When next we meet thou shalt know all Farewel  Exit Edric  Now to conceal with care my bosom's anguish And let her beauty chase away my sorrows  Yes I wou'd meet her with a face of smilesBut 'twill not be  Enter  ELWINA  ELWINA  Alas 'tis ever thus Thus ever clouded is his angry brow  aside  DOUGLAS  I were too blest Elwina cou'd I hope You met me here by choice or that your bosom Shar'd the warm transports mine must ever feel At your approach  ELWINA  My lord if I intrude  The cause which brings me claims at least forgiveness  I sear you are not well and come unbidden  Except by faithful duty to enquire  If haply in my power my little power  I have the means to minister relief  To your affliction  DOUGLAS  What unwonted goodness  O I were blest above the lot of man  if tenderness not duty brought Elwina  Cold ceremonious and unfeeling duty  That wretched substitute for love But know  The heart demands a heart nor will be paid  With less than what it gives E'en now Elwina  The glistening tear stands trembling in your eyes  Which casttheir mournful sweetnesson the ground  As if they fear'd to raise their beams to mine  And read the language of reproachful love  ELWINA  My lord I hop'd the thousand daily proofs Of my obedience  DOUGLAS  Death to all my hopes  Heart rending word obedience what's obedience  'Tis fear 'tis hate 'tis terror 'tis aversion  'Tis the cold debt of ostentatious duty  Paid with insulting caution to remind me  How much you tremble to offend a tyrant  So terrible as Douglas"O Elwina  "While duty measures the regard it owes  "With scrupulous precision and nice justice  "Love never reasons but profusely gives  "Gives like a thoughtless prodigal its all  "And trembles then left it has done too little"  ELWIHA  Indeed I'm most unhappy that my cares And my solicitude to please offend  DOUGLAS  True tenderness is less solicitous  Less prudent and more fond th'enamour'd heart  Conscious it loves and blest in being lov'd  Reposes on the object it adores  And trusts the passion it inspires and feels  Thou hast not learnt how terrible it is  To feed a hopeless flameBut hear Elwina  Thou most obdurate hear me  ELWINA  Say mylord For your own lips shall vindicate my  ame  Since at the altar I became your wife  Can malice charge me with an act a word  I ought to blush at Have I not still liv'd  As open to the eye of observation  As fearless innocence shou'd ever live  I call attesting angels to be witness  If in my open deed or secret thought  My conduct or my heart they've ought discern'd  Which did not emulate their purity  DOUGLAS  This vindication e'er you were accus'd  "This warm defence repelling all attacks  E'er they are made and construing casual words  To formal accusations trust me Madam"  Shews rather an alarm'd and vigilant spirit  For ever on the watch to guard its secret  Than the sweet calm of fearless innocence  Who talk'd of guilt Who testified suspicion  ELWINA  Learn Sir that virtue while'tis free from blame  Is modest lowly meek and unassuming  Not apt like fearful vice to shield its weakness  Beneath the studied pomp of boastful phrase  Which swells to hide the poverty it shelters  But when this virtue feels itself suspected  Insulted set at nought its whiteness stain'd  It then grows proud forgets its humble worth  And rates itself above its real value  DOUGLAS  I did not mean to chide But think O think  What pangs must rend this fearful doating heart  To see you sink impatient of the grave  To feel distracting thought to feel you hate me  ELWINA  What if the slender thread by which I hold  This poor precarious being soon must break  Is it Elwina's crime or heav'n's decree  Yet I shall meet I trust the king of terrors  Submissive and resign'd without one pang  One fond regret at leaving this gay world  DOUGLAS  Yet Madam there is one one man ador'd For whom your sighs will heave your tears will flow For whom this hated world will still be dear For whom you still wou'd live  ELWINA  Hold hold my lord What may this mean  DOUGLAS  Ah I have gone too far What have I saidYour father sure your father The good Lord Raby may at least expect One tender sigh  ELWINA  Alas my lord I thought The precious incense of a daughter's sighs Might rise to heav'n and not offend its ruler  DOUGLAS  'Tis true yet Raby is no more belov'd  Since he bestow'd his daughter's hand on Douglas  That was a crime the dutiful Elwina  Can never pardon and believe me Madam  My love's so nice so delicate my honour  I am asham'd to owe my happiness  To ties which make you wretched  Exit Douglas  ELWINA  Ah how's this  Tho' I have ever found him fierce and rash  Full of obscure surmises and dark hints  Till now he never ventur'd to accuse me  Yet there is one one man belov'd ador'd  For whom your tears will flowthese were his words  And then the wretched subterfuge of Raby  How poor th' evasionBut my Birtha comes  Enter  BIRTHA  BIRTHA  Crossing the Portico I met Lord Douglas  Disorder'd were his looks his eyes shot fire  He call'd upon your name with such distraction  I sear'd some sudden evil had befall'n you  ELWINA  Not sudden no long has the storm been gathering  Which threatens speedily to burst in ruin  On this devoted head  BIRTHA  I ne'er beheld  Your gentle soul so ruffled yet I've mark'd you  While others thought you happiest of the happy  Blest with whate'er the world calls great or good  With all that nature all that fortune gives  I've mark'd you beuding with a weight of sorrow  ELWINA  O I will tell thee all thou cou'dst not find  An hour a moment in Elwina's life  When her full heart so long'd to ease its burthen  And pour its sorrows in thy friendly bosom  Hear then with pity hear my tale of woe  And O forgive kind nature filial piety  If my presumptuous lips arraign a father  Yes Birtha that belov'd that cruel father  Has doom'd me to a life of hopeless anguish  To die of grief e'er half my days are number'd  Doom'd me to give my trembling hand to Douglas  'Twas all I had to give my heart wasPercy's  BIRTHA  What do I hear  ELWINA  My mis'ry not my crime  ELWINA  Long since the battle 'twixt the rival houses  Of Douglas and of Percy for whose hate  This mighty globe's too small a Theatre  One summer's morn my father chas'd the Deer  On Cheviot Hills Northumbria's fair domain  BIRTHA  On that fam'd spot where first the seuds commenc'd  Between the Earls  ELWINA  The same During the chace  Some of my father's knights receiv'd an insult  From the Lord Percy's herdsmen churlish foresters  Unworthy of the gentle blood they serv'd  My father proud and jealous of his honour  Thou know'st the fiery temper of our Barons  Swore that Northumberland had been concern'd  In this rude outrage nor wou'd hear of peace  Or reconcilement which the Percy offer'd  But bade me hate renounce and banish him  O 'twas a task too hard for all my duty  I strove and wept I strovebut still I lov'd  BIRTHA  Indeed 'twas most unjust but say what follow'd  ELWINA  Why shou'd I dwell on the disastrous tale  Forbid to see me Percy soon embark'd  With our great king against the Saracen  Soon as the jarring kingdoms were at peace  Earl Douglas whom till then I ne'er had seen  Came to this castle 'twas my hapless fate  To please himBirtha thou can'st tell what follow'd  But who shall tell the agonies I felt  My barbarous father forc'd me to dissolve  The tender vows himself had bid me form  He dragg'd me trembling dying to the altar  I sigh'd I struggled fainted andcomplied  BIRTHA  Did Douglas know a marriage had been once Fropos'd 'twixt you and Percy  ELWINA  If he did He thought like you it was a match of policy Nor knew our love surpass'd our father's prudence  BIRTHA  Should he now find he was the instrument Of the Lord Raby's vengeance  ELWINA  'Twere most dreadful  My father lock'd this motive in his breast  And feign'd to have forgot the Chace of Cheviot  Some moons have now completed their slow course  Since my sad marriagePercy still is absent  BIRTHA  Nor will return before his sov'reign comes  ELWINA  Talk not of his return this coward heart Can know no thought of peace but in his absence How Douglas here again some fresh alarm  Enter  Douglas  agitated with letters in his hand  DOUGLAS  Madam your pardon  ELWINA  What disturbs my lord  NothingDisturb I ne'er was more at ease  These letters from your father give us notice  He will be here tonightHe further adds  The king's each hour expected  ELWINA  How the king Said you the king  DOUGLAS  And 'tis Lord Raby's pleasure  That you among the foremost bid him welcome  You must attend the court  ELWINA  Must I my lord  DOUGLAS  Now to observe how she receives the news  Aside  ELWINA  I must not cannotBy all the tender love  You have so oft prosess'd for poor Elwina  Indulge this one requestO let me stay  DOUGLAS  Enchanting sounds she does not wish to go  Aside  ELWINA  The bustling world the pomp which waits on greatness  Ill suits my humble unambitious soul  Then leave me here to tread the safer path  Of private life here where my peaceful course  Shall be as silent as the shades around me  Nor shall one vagrant wish be e'er allow'd  To stray beyond the bounds of Raby Castle  DOUGLAS  O music to my ears  Aside  Can you resolve  To hide those wondrous beauties in the shade  Which rival kings wou'd cheaply buy with empire  Can you renounce the pleasures of a court  Whole roofs refound with minstrelsy and mirth  ELWINA  My lord retirement is a wife's best duty  And virtue's safest station is retreat  DOUGLAS  My soul 's in transports  Aside  But can you forego'  What wins the soul of womanadmiration  A world where charms inferior far to yours  Only presume to shine when you are absent  Will you not long to meet the public gaze  Long to eclipse the fair and charm the brave  ELWINA  These are delights in which the  mind  partakes not  DOUGLAS  I'll try her farther  Aside  Takes her hand and looks stedfastly at her as he speaks  But reflect once more  When yon shall hear that England's gallant peers  Fresh from the fields of war and gay with glory  All vain with conquest and elate with same  When you shall hear these princely youths contend  In many a tournament for beauty's prize  When you shall hear of revelry and masking  Of mimic combats and of festive halls  Of lances shiver'd in the cause of love  Will you not then repent then wish your fate  Your happier fate had till that hour reserv'd you  For some plum'd conqueror  ELWINA  My fate my lord Is now bound up with yours  DOUGLAS  Here let me kneel  Yes I will kneel and gaze and weep and wonder  Thou paragon of goodnesspardon pardon  Kisses her hand  I am convine'dI can no longer doubt  Nor talk nor hear nor reason nor reflect  I must retire and give a loose to joy  Exit Douglas  BIRTHA  The king returns  ELWINA  And with him Percy comes  BIRTHA  You needs must go  ELWINA  Shall I folicit ruin  And pull destruction on me ere its time  I who have held it criminal to name him  I will not goI disobey thee Douglas  But disobey thee to preserve thy honour  End of the First Act  ACT II  SCENE  The Hall  DOUGLAS  speaking as be enters  SEE that the traytor instantly be feiz'd  And strictly watch'd let none have access to him  O jealousy thou aggregate of woes  Were there no hell thy torments wou'd create one  But yet she may be guiltlessmay she must  How beautiful she look'd pernicious beauty  Yet innocent as bright seem'd the sweet blush  That mantled on her cheek But not for me  But not for me those breathing roses blow  And then she weptwhat can I bear her tears  Welllet her weepher tears are for another  O did they fall for me to dry their streams  I'd drain the choicest blood that feeds this heart  Nor think the drops I shed were half so precious  He stands in a musing posture  Enter Lord  RABY  RABY  Sure I mistakeAm I in Raby Castle  Impossible that was the seat of smiles  And Cheerfulness and Joy were household gods  I us'd to scatter pleasures when Icame  And every servant shar'd his lord's delight  But now Suspicion and Distrust dwell here  And Discontent maintains a sullen sway  Where is the smile unfeign'd the jovial welcome  Which cheer'd the sad beguil'd the pilgrim's pain  And made dependency forget its bonds  Where is the antient hospitable hall  Whose vaultedroof once rung with harmless mirth  Where every passing stranger was a guest  And every guest a friend I fear me much  If once our nobles scorn their rural seats  Their rural greatness and their vassal's love  Freedom and English grandeur are no more  DOUGLAS  advancing  My lord you are welcome  RABY  Sir I trust I am  But yet methinks I shall not feel I'm welcome  Till my Elwina bless me with her smiles  She was not wont with ling'ring step to meet me  Or greet my coming with a cold embrace  Now I extend my longing arms in vain  My child my darling does not come to fill them  O they were happy days when she wou'd fly  To meet me from the camp or from the chace  And with her fondness overpay my toils  How eager wou'd her tender hands unbrace  The ponderous armour from my warworn limbs  And pluck the helmet which oppos'd her kiss  DOUGLAS  O sweet delights that never must be mine  RABY  What do I hear  DOUGLAS  Nothing enquire no farther  RABY  My lord if you respect an old man's peace  If e'er you doated on my muchlov'd child  As 'tis most sure you made me think you did  Then by the pangs which you may one day feel  When you like me shall be a fond fond father  And tremble for the treasure of your age  Tell me what this alarming silence means  You sigh yet do not speak nay more you hear not  Your lab'ring soul turns inward on itself  As there were nothing but your own sad thoughts  Deserv'd regard Does my child live  DOUGLAS  She does  RABY  To bless her father  DOUGLAS  And to curse her husband  RABY  Ah have a care my lord I am not so old  DOUGLAS  Nor I so base that I should tamely bear it  Nor am I so inur'd to infamy  That I can say without a burning blush  She lives to be my curse  RABY  How's this  DOUGLAS  I thought  The lily op'ning to the heav'n's soft dews  Was not so fragrant and was not so chaste  RABY  Has she prov'd otherwise I'll not believe it  Who has traduc'd my sweet my innocent child  Yet she's too good to 'scape calumnious tongues  I know that Slander loves a lofty mark  It saw her soar a flight above her fellows  And hurl'd its arrow to her glorious height  To reach her heart and bring her to the ground  DOUGLAS  Had the rash tongue of Slander so prefum'd  My vengeance had not been of that slow sort  To need a prompter nor should any arm  No not a father's dare dispute with mine  The privilege to die in her defence  None dares accuse Elwina but  RABY  But who  DOUGLAS  But Douglas  RABY  puts his hand to his sword  YouO spare my age's weakness  You do not know what 'tis to be a father  You do not know or you would pity me  The thousand tender throbs the nameless feelings  The dread to ask and yet the wish to know  When we adore and fear but wherefore fear  Does not the blood of Raby fill her veins  DOUGLAS  Percyknow'st thou that name  RABY  How what of Percy  DOUGLAS  He loves Elwina and my curses on him He is belov'd again  RABY  I'm on the rack  DOUGLAS  Not the two Theban brothers bore each other  Such deep such deadly hate as I and Percy  RABY  But tell me of my child  DOUGLAS  no' minding him  As I and Percy  When at the marriage rites O rites accurs'd  I seiz'd her trembling hand she started back  Cold horror thrill'd her veins her tears flow'd fast  Fool that I was I thought 'twas maiden fear  Dull doating ignorance beneath those terrors  Hatred for me and love for Percy lurk'd  RABY  What proof of guilt is this  DOUGLAS  E'er since our marriage  Our days have still been cold and joyless all  "Painful restraint and hatred ill disguis'd  "Her sole return for all my waste of fondness"  This very morn I told her 'twas your will  She should repair to court with all those graces  Which first subdu'd my soul and still enslave it  She begg'd to stay behind in Raby Castle  For courts and cities had no charms for her  Curse my blind love I was again ensnar'd  And doated on the sweetness which deceiv'd me  Just at the hour she thought I shou'd be absent  For chance cou'd ne'er have tim'd their guilt so well  Arriv'd young Harcourt one of Percy's knights  Strictly enjoin'd to speak to none but her  I seiz'd the miscreant hitherto he's silent  But tortures soon shall force him to confess  RABY  Percy is absentThey have never met  DOUGLAS  At what a feeble hold you grasp for succour  Will it content me that her person's pure  No if her alien heart doats on another  She is unchaste were not that other Percy  Let vulgar spirits basely wait for proof  She loves another'tis enough for Douglas  RABY  Be patient  DOUGLAS  Be a tame convenient husband  And meanly wait for circumstantial guilt  NoI am nice as the first Caesar was  And start at bare suspicion  going  RABY  holding him  Douglas hear me  Thou hast nam'd a Roman husband if she's false  I mean to prove myself a Roman father  Exit Douglas  This marriage was my work and thus I'm punish'd  Enter  ELWINA  ELWINA  Where is my father let me fly to meet him  O let me clasp his venerable knees  And die of joy in his belov'd embrace  RABY  avoiding her embrace  Elwina  ELWINA  And is that all so cold  RABY  sternly  Elwina  ELWINA  Then I'm Undone indeed How stern his looks  I will not be repuls'd I am your child  The child of that dear mother you ador'd  You shall not throw me off I will grow here  And like the patriarch wrestle for a blessing  RABY  holding her from him  Before I take thee in these aged arms  Press thee with transport to this beating heart  And give a loose to all a parent's fondness  Answer and see thou answer me as truly  As if the dread enquiry came from heaven  Does no interior sense of guilt confound thee  Canst thou lay all thy naked soul before me  Can thy unconscious eye encounter mine  Canst thou endure the probe and never shrink  Can thy firm hand meet mine and never tremble  Art thou prepar'd to meet the rigid judge  Or to embrace the fond the melting father  ELWINA  Mysterious heav'n to what am I reserv'd  RABY  Shou'd some rash man regardless of thy same  And in defiance of thy marriage vows  Presume to plead a guilty passion for thee  What woud'st thou do  ELWINA  What honour bids me do  RABY  Come to my arms  they embrace  ELWINA  My father  RABY  Yes Elwina  Thou art my childthy mother's perfect image  ELWINA  Forgive these tears of mingled joy and doubt  For why that question who should seek to please  The desolate Elwina  RABY  But if any  Should so presume can'st thou resolve to hate him  Whate'er his name whate'er his pride of blood  Whate'er his former arrogant pretensions  ELWINA  Ha  RABY  Dost thou falter Have a care Elwina  ELWINA  Sir do not fear me am I not your daughter  RABY  Thou hast a higher claim upon thy honour  Thou art Earl Douglas' Wife  ELWINA  weeps  I am indeed  RABY  Unhappy Douglas  ELWINA  Has he then complain'd  Has he presum'd to sully my white fame  RABY  He knows that Percy  ELWINA  Was my destin'd husband  By your own promise mine a father's promise  And by a tie more strong more sacred still  Mine by the fast firm bond of mutual love  RABY  Now by my fears thy husband told me truth  ELWINA  If he has told thee that thy only child  Was forc'd a helpless victim to the altar  Torn from his arms who had her virgin heart  And forc'd to make false vows to one she hated  Then I confess that he has told thee truth  RABY  Her words are barbed arrows in my heart  But 'tis too late  aside  Thou hast appointed Harcourt  To see thee here by stealth in Douglas' absence  ELWINA  No by my life nor knew I till this moment  That Harcourt was return'd Was it for this  I taught my heart to struggle with its feelings  Was it for this I bore my wrongs in silence  When the fond ties of early love were broken  Did my weak soul break out in fond complaints  Did I reproach thee Did I call thee cruel  NoI endur'd it all and weary'd heaven  To bless the father who destroy'd my peace  Enter  MESSENGER  MESSENGER  My lord a knight Sir Hubert as I think  But newly landed from the holy wars  Intreats admittance  RABY  Let the warrior enter  Exit Messenger  All private interests sink at his approach  All selfish cares be for a moment banish'd  I've now no child no kindred but my country  ELWINA  Weak heart be still for what hast thou to fear  Enter Sir  HUBERT  RABY  Welcome thou gallant knight Sir Hubert  welcome  Welcome to Raby CastleIn one word  Is the king safe Is Palestine subdued  Sir  HUBERT  HUBERT  The king is safe and Palestine subdued  RABY  Blest be the god of armies Now Sir Hubert  By all the saints thou'rt a right noble knight  O why was I too old for this crusade  I think it wou'd have made me young again  Cou'd I like thee have seen the hated Crescent  Yield to the Christian crossHow now Elwina  What cold at news which might awake the dead  If there's a drop in thy degenerate veins  That glows not now thou art not Raby's daughter  It is religion's cause the cause of

Castle with a Bower  Enter  PERCY  and Sir  HUBERT  Sir  HUBERT  THAT Percy lives and is return'd in safety  More joys my soul than all the mighty conquests  That sun beheld which rose on Syria's ruin  PERCY  I've told thee good Sir Hubert by what wonder  I was preserv'd tho' number'd with the slain  Sir  HUBERT  'Twas strange indeed  PERCY  'Twas heav'ns immediate work  But let me now indulge a dearer joy  Talk of a richer gift of Mercy's hand  A gift so precious to my doating heart  That life preserv'd is but a second blessing  O Hubert let my soul indulge its softness  The hour the spot is sacred to Elwina  This was her fav'rite walk I well remember  For who forgets that loves as I have lov'd  'Twas in that very bower she gave this scarf  Wrought by the hand of love she bound it on  And smiling cried Whate'er befal us Percy  Be this the sacred pledge of faith between us  I knelt and swore call'd every pow'r to witness  No time nor circumstance shou'd force it from me  But I wou'd lose my life and that together  Here I repeat my vow  Sir  HUBERT  Is this the man  Beneath whose single arm an host was crush'd  He at whose name the Saracen turn'd pale  And when he fell victorious armies wept  And mourn'd a conquest they had bought so dear  How has he chang'd the trumpet's martial note  And all the stirring clangor of the war  For the soft melting of the lover's lute  Why are thine eyes still bent upon the bower  PERCY  O Hubert Hubert to a soul enamour'd  There is a sort of local sympathy  Which when we view the seenes of early passion  Paints the bright image of the object lov'd  In stronger colours than remoter scenes  Cou'd ever pant it realizes shade  Dresses it up in all the charms it wore  Talks to it nearer frames its answers kinder  Gives form to fancy and embodies thought  Sir  HUBERT  I should not be believ'd in Percy's camp  If I shou'd tell them that their gallant leader  The thunder of the war the bold Northumberland  Renouncing Mars dissolv'd in amorous wishes  Loiter'd in shades and pin'd in rosy bowers  To catch a transient glance of two bright eyes  PERCY  Enough of conquest and enough of war  Ambition's cloy'dthe heart resumes its rights  When England's king and England's good requir'd  This arm not idly the keen falchion brandish'd  Enoughfor vaunting misbecomes a soldier  I live I am return'dam near Elwina  See'st thou those turrets Yes that castle holds her  But wherefore tell thee this for thou hast seen her  How look'd what said she Did she hear the tale  Of my imagin'd death without emotion  Sir  HUBERT  Percy thou hast seen the muskrose newly blown  Disclose its bashful beauties to the sun  Till an unfriendly chilling storm descended  Crush'd all its blushing glories in their prime  Bow'd its fair head and blasted all its sweetness  So droop'd the maid beneath the cruel weight  Of my sad tale  PERCY  So tender and so true  Sir  HUBERT  I left her fainting in her father's arms  The dying flower yet hanging on the tree  Ev'n Raby melted at the news I brought  And envy'd thee thy glory  PERCY  Then I am blest  His hate subdued I've nothing more to fear  Sir  HUBERT  My embassy dispatch'd I left the castle  Nor spoke to any of Lord Raby's household  For fear the king shou'd chide the tardiness  Of my return My joy to find you living  You have already heard  PERCY  But where is Harcourt  E'er this he shou'd have seen her told her all  How I surviv'd return'd and how I love  I tremble at the near approach of bliss  And scarcely can sustain the joy which waits me  Sir  HUBERT  Grant heaven the fairone prove but half so true  PERCY  O she is truth itself  Sir  HUBERT  She may be chang'd  Spite of her tears her fainting and alarms  I know the sex know them as nature made 'em  Not such as lovers wish and poets feign  PERCY  To doubt her virtue were suspecting heaven  'Twere little less than infidelity  And yet I tremble Why does terror shake  These firmstrung nerves But 'twill be ever thus  When fate prepares us more than mortal bliss  And gives us only human strength to bear it  Sir  HUBERT  What beam of brightness breaks thro' yonder gloom  PERCY  Hubertshe comes By all my hopes she comes  'Tis shethe blissful vision is Elwina  But ah what mean those tearsShe weeps for me  O transportgoI'll listen unobserv'd  And for a moment taste the precious joy  The banquet of a tear which falls for love  Exit Sir Hubert  Percy goes into the Bower  Enter  ELWINA  ELWINA  Shall I not weep and have I then no cause  If I cou'd break th' eternal bands of death  And wrench the sceptre from his iron grasp  If I cou'd bid the yawning sepulchre  Restore to life its long committed dust  If I could teach the slaught'ring hand of war  To give me back my dear my murder'd Percy  Then I indeed might once more cease to weep  Percy comes out of the Bower  PERCY  Then cease for Percy lives  ELWINA  Protest me heav'n  PERCY  O joy unspeakable My life my love  End of my toils and crown of all my cares  Kind as consenting peace as conquest bright  Dearer than arms and lovelier than renown  ELWINA  It is his voiceit is it is my Percy  And dost thou live  PERCY  I never liv'd till now  ELWINA  And did my sighs and did my sorrows reach thee  And art thou come at last to dry my tears  How didst thou scape the fury of the foe  PERCY  Thy guardian genius hover'd o'er the field  And turn'd the hostile spear from Percy's breast  Left thy fair image shou'd be wounded there  But Harcourt should have told thee all my fate  How I surviv'd  ELWINA  Alas I have not seen him  Oh I have suffer'd much  PERCY  Of that no more  For every minute of our future lives  Shall be so bless d that we will learn to wonder  How we cou'd ever think we were unhappy  ELWINA  PercyI cannot speak  PERCY  Those tears how eloquent  I would not change this motlionless mute joy  For the sweet strains of angels I look down  With pity on the rest of human kind  However great may be their same of happiness  And think their niggard fate has giv'n them nothing  Not giving thee or granting some small blessing  Denies them my capacity to feel it  ELWINA  Alas what mean you  PERCY  Can I speak my meaning  Tis of such magnitude that words wou'd wrong it  But surely my Elwina's faithful bosom  Shou'd beat in kind responses of delight  And feel but never question what I mean  ELWINA  Hold hold my heart thou hast much more to suffer  PERCY  Let the slow form and tedious ceremony  Wait on the splendid victims of ambition  Love stays for none of these Thy father's soften'd  He will forget the fatal Cheviot Chace  Raby is brave and I have serv'd my country  I wou'd not boast it was for thee I conquer'd  Then come my love  ELWINA  O never never never  PERCY  Am I awake Is that Elwina's voice  ELWINA  Percy thou most ador'dand most deceiv'd  If ever fortitude sustain'd thy soul  When vulgar minds hare sunk beneath the stroke  Let thy imperial spirit now support thee  If thou canst be so wondrous merciful  Do not O do not curse mebut thou wilt  Thou mustfor I have done a fearful deed  A deed of wild despair a deed of horror  I am I am  PERCY  Speak say what art thou  ELWINA  Married  PERCY  Oh  ELWINA  Percy I think I begg'd thee not to curse me  But now I do revoke the fond petition  Speak ease thy bursting soul reproach upbraid  O'erwhelm me with thy wrongsI'll bear it all  PERCY  Open thou earth and hide me from her sight  Didst thou not bid me curse thee  ELWINA  Mercy mercy  PERCY  And have I 'scap'd the Saracen's fell sword  Only to perish by Elwina's guilt  I wou'd have bar'd my bosom to the foe  I wou'd have died had I but known you wish'd it  ELWINA  Percy I lov'd thee most when most I wrong'd thee  Yes by these tears I did  PERCY  Married just heav'n  Married to whom Yet wherefore should I know  It cannot add fresh horrors to thy crime  Or my destruction  ELWINA  Oh 'twill add to both  How shall I tell Prepare for something dreadful  Hast thou not heard ofDouglas  PERCY  Why 'tis well  Thou awful power why waste thy wrath on me  Why arm omnipotence to crush a worm  I cou'd have fall'n without this waste of ruin  Married to Douglas By my wrongs I like it  'Tis perfidy compleat 'tis finish'd falsehood  'Tis adding fresh perdition to the sin  And filling up the measure of offence  ELWINA  Oh 'twas my father's deed he made his child  An instrument of vengeance on thy head  He wept and threaten'd sooth'd me and commanded  PERCY  And you complied most duteously complied  ELWINA  I cou'd withstand his fury but his tears  Ah they undid me Percy dost thou know  The cruel tyranny of tenderness  Hast thou e'er felt a father's warm embrace  Hast thou e'er seen a father's flowing tears  And known that thou cou'dst wipe those tears away  If thou hast felt and hast resisted these  Then thou may'st curse my weakness but if not  Thou canst not pity for thou canst not judge  PERCY  Let me not hear the music of thy voice  Or I shall love thee still I shall forget  Thy fatal marriage and my savage wrongs  ELWINA  Dost thou not hate me Percy  PERCY  Hate thee Yes  As dying martyrs hate the righteous cause  Of that bless'd Power for whom they bleedI hate thee  They look at each other in silent agony  Enter  HARCOURT  HARCOURT  Forgive my lord your faithful knight  PERCY  Come Harcourt  Come and behold the wretch who once was Percy  HARCOURT  With grief I've

One solitary blessing to console me  It was my fame'Tis a rich jewel Percy  And I must keep it spotless and unsoil'd  But thou wou'dst plunder what e'en Douglas spar'd  And rob this single gem of all its brightness  PERCY  Gothou wast born to rule the fate of Percy  Thou art my conqueror still  ELWINA  What noise is that  Harcourt goes to the side of the Stage  PERCY  Why art thou thus alarm'd

friendihip can excite such strong emotions  What tremors had a lover's presence caus'd  ELWINA  Ungenerous man  DOUGLAS  I feast upon her terrors  Aside  The story of his death was well contriv'd  to

DOUGLAS  Her scarf upon his breast  The blasting sight converts me into stone  Withers my powers like cowardice or age  Curdles the blood within my shiv'ring veins  And palsies my bold arm  PERCY  ironically to the Knights  Hear you his friends  Bear witness to the glorious great exploit  Record it in the annals of his race  That Douglas the renown'dthe valiant Douglas  Fenc'd round with guards and safe in his own castle  Surpris'd a knight unarm'd and bravely slew him  DOUGLAS  throwing away his dagger  'Tis trueI am the very stain of knighthood  How is my glory dimm'd  ELWINA  It blazes brighter  Douglas was only bravehe now is gen'rous  PERCY  This action has restor'd thee to thy rank  And makes thee worthy to contend with Percy  DOUGLAS  Thy joy will be as short as tis insulting  to Elwina  And thou imperious boy restrain thy boasting  Thou hast sav'd my honour not remov'd my hate  For my soul loaths thee for the obligation  Give him his sword  PERCY  Now thou'rt a noble foe  And in the field of honour I will meet thee  As knight encountring knight  ELWINA  Stay Percy stay  Strike at the wretched cause of all strike here  Here sheathe thy thirsty sword but spare my husband  DOUGLAS  Turn Madam and address those vows to me  To spare the precious life of him you love  Ev'n now you triumph in the death of Douglas  Now your loose fancy kindles at the thought  And wildly rioting in lawless hope  Indulges the adultery of the mind  But I'll defeat that wishGuards bear her in  Nay do not struggle  She is borne in  PERCY  Let our death's suffice  And rev'rence virtue in that form inshrin'd  DOUGLAS  Provoke my rage no fartherI have kindled  The burning torch of neverdying vengeance  At Love's expiring lampBut mark me friends  If Percy's happier genius shou'd prevail  And I shou'd fall give him safe conduct hence  Be all observance paid himGoI follow thee  Aside to Edric  Within I've something for thy private ear  PERCY  Now shall this mutual fury be appeas'd  These eager hands shall soon be drench'd in slaughter  Yeslike two famish'd vultures snuffing blood  And panting to destroy we'll rush to combat  Yet I've the deepest deadliest cause of hate  I'm but

Then why this sorrow  BIRTHA  What a talk is mine  ELWINA  Thou talk'st as if I were a child in grief  And scarce acquainted with calamity  Speak out unfold thy tale whate'er it be  For I am so familiar with affliction  It cannot come in any shape will shock me  BIRTHA  How shall I speak Thy husband  ELWINA  What of Douglas  BIRTHA  When all was ready for the fatal combat  He call'd his chosen knights then drew his sword  And on it made them swear a solemn oath  Confirm'd by ev'ry rite religion bids  That they wou'd see perform'd his last request  Be it whate'er it wou'd Alas they swore  ELWINA  What did the dreadful preparation mean  BIRTHA  Then to their hands he gave a poison'd cup  Compounded of the deadliest herbs and drugs  Take this said he it is a husband's legacy  Percy may conquerandI have a wife  If Douglas falls Elwina must not live  ELWINA  Spirit of Herod Why 'twas greatly thought  'Twas worthy of the bosom which conceiv'd it  Yet 'twas too merciful to be his own  Yes Douglas yes my husband I'll obey thee  And bless thy genius which has found the means  To reconcile thy vengeance with my peace  The deadly means to make obedience pleasant  BIRTHA  O spare for pity spare my bleeding heart  Inhuman to the last Unnatural poison  ELWINA  My gentle friend what is there in a name  The means are little where the end is kind  If it disturb thee do not call it poison  Call it the sweet oblivion of my cares  My balm of woe my cordial of affliction  The drop of mercy to my fainting soul  My kind dismission from a world of sorrow  My cup of bliss my passport to the skies  BIRTHA  Hark what alarm is that  ELWINA  The combat's over  Birtha goes out  Elwina stands in a fix'd attituide her hands clasp'd  Now gracious heav'n sustain me in the trial

look down and hear me swear  That when the legacy thy rage bequeathed me  Works at my heart and conquers struggling nature  Ev'n in that agony I'll still be faithful  She who cou'd never love shall yet obey thee  Weep thy hard fate and die to prove her truth  BIRTHA  O unexampled virtue  a noise without  ELWINA  Heard you nothing  By all my fears th' insulting conqueror comes  O save me shield

fountain of eternal mercy  This load of guilt is spar'd me Douglas lives  Perhaps both live  to Birtha  Cou'd I be sure of that  The poison were superfluous joy wou'd kill me  DOUGLAS  Be honest now for once and curse thy stars  Curse thy detested fate which brings thee back  A hated husband when thy guilty soul  Revell'd in fond imaginary joys  With my too happy rival when thou slew'st  To gratify impatient boundless passion  And join adulterous lust to bloody murder  Then to reverse the scene polluted woman  Mine is the transport now and thine the pang  ELWINA  Whence sprung the false report that thou had'st fall'n  DOUGLAS  To give thy guilty breast a deeper wound  To add a deadlier sting to disappointment  I rais'd itI contriv'dI sent it thee  ELWINA  Thou seest me bold but bold in conscious virtue  That my sad soul may not be stain'd with blood  That I may spend my few short hours in peace  And die in holy hope of heav'n's forgiveness  Relieve the terrors of my lab'ring breast  Say I am clear of murdersay he lives  Say but that little word that Percy lives  And Alps and Oceans shall divide us ever  As far as universal space can part us  DOUGLAS  Canst thou renounce him  ELWINA  Tell me that he lives  And thou shalt be the ruler of my fate  For ever hide me in a convent's gloom  From cheerful daylight and the haunts of men  Where sad austerity and ceaseless pray'r  Shall share my uncomplaining day between them  DOUGLAS  O hypocrite now vengeance to thy office  I had forgotPercy commends him to thee  And by my hand  ELWINA  Howby thy hand  DOUGLAS  Has sent thee  This precious pledge of love  He gives her Percy's Scarf  ELWINA  Then Percy's dead  DOUGLAS  He isO great revenge thou now art mine  See how convulsive sorrow rends her frame  This this is transportinjur'd honour now  Receives its vast its ample retribution  She sheds no tears her grief's too highly wrought  'Tis speechless agonyShe must not faint  She shall not 'scape her portion of the pain  No she shall feel the fulness of distress  And wake to keen perception of her loss  BIRTHA  Monster Barbarian leave her to her sorrows  ELWINA  In a low broken voice  Douglasthink not I

longer  DOUGLAS  Percy I must avow it bravely sought  Died as a hero shou'dbut as he fell  Hear it fond wanton call'd upon thy name  And his lastly guilty breath sigh'd outElwina  Comegive a loose to rage and feed my soul  With wild complaints and womanish upbraidings  ELWINA  In a low solemn voice  No  The sorrow's weak that wastes itself in words  Mine is substantial anguishdeep not loud  I do not raveResentment's the return  Of common souls for common injuries  Light grief is proud of state and courts compassion  But there's a dignity in cureless sorrow  A sullen grandeur which disdains complaint  Rage is for little wrongsDespair is dumb  Exeunt Elwina and Birtha  DOUGLAS  Why this is wellher sense of woe is strong  The sharp keen tooth of gnawing Grief devours her  Feeds on her heart and pays me back my pangs  Since I must perish 'twill be glorious ruin  I fall not singly but like some proud tower  I'll crush surrounding objects in the wreck  And make the devastation wide and dreadful  Enter  RABY  RABY  O whither shall a wretched father turn  Where fly for comfort Douglas art thou here  I do not ask for comfort at thy hands  I'd but one little casket where I lodg'd  My precious hoard of wealth and like an ideot  I gave my treasure to another's keeping  Who threw away the gem nor knew its value  But left the plunder'd owner quite a beggar  DOUGLAS  What art thou come to see thy race dishonour'd  And thy bright sun of glory set in blood  I wou'd have spar'd thy virtues and thy age  The knowledge of her infamy  RABY  Tis false  Had she been base this sword had

And scorn my age  DOUGLAS  There will be blood enough  Nor need thy wither'd veins old lord be drain'd  To swell the copious stream  RABY  Thou wilt not kill her  DOUGLAS  Oh 'tis a day of horror  Enter  EDRIC  and  BIRTHA  EDRIC  Where is Douglas  I come to save him from the deadliest crime  Revenge did ever meditate  DOUGLAS  What mean'st thou  EDRIC  This insant fly and save thy guiltless
