 THE Female QUIXOTE OR THE ADVENTURES OF  ARABELLA In  TWO VOLUMES VOL II  LONDON  Printed for A MILLAR overagainst  CatherineStreet  in the  Strand  MDCCLII  THE Female QUIXOTE BOOK V  CHAP I  A Dispute very learnedly handled by two Ladies in which the Reader may take what Part he pleases  _MR  Glanville  who was too much in Love to pass the Night with any great Degree of Tranquillity under the Apprehensions he felt it being the Nature of that Passion to magnify the most inconsiderable Trifles into Things of the greatest Importance when they concern the beloved Object did not fail to torment himself with a thousand different Fears which the mysterious  Behaviour of his Father and the more mysterious Words of his Mistress gave Rise to Among many various Conjectures all equally unreasonable he fixed upon one no way advantageous to Sir  Charles  for supposing that the Folly of  Arabella  had really disgusted him and made him desirous of breaking off the designed Match between them he was as he thought taking Measures to bring this about knowing that if Lady  Bella  refused to fulfil her Father's Desire in this Particular a very considerable Estate would descend to him  Upon any other Occasion Mr  Glanville  would not have suspected his Father of so ungenerous an Action but Lovers think every thing possible which they fear and being prepossessed with this Opinion he resolved the next Morning to sound his Father's Inclinations by intreating him to endeavour to prevail upon Lady  Bella  to marry him before her Year of Mourning for the marquis was expired  Attending him therefore at Breakfast in his own Chamber he made his designed Request not without heedfully observing his Countenance at the same time and trembling lest he should make him an Answer that might confirm his uneasy Suspicion  Sir  Charles  however agreeably surprised him by promising to comply with his Desire that Day for added he tho' my Niece has some odd ways yet upon the Whole she is a very accomplished Woman and when you are her Husband you may probably find the Means of curing her of those little Follies  which at present are conspicuous enough but being occasioned by a Country Education and a perfect Ignorance of the World the Instruction which then you will not scruple to give her and which from a Husband without any Offence to her Delicacy she may receive may reform her Conduct and make her Behaviour as complete as it must be confessed both her Person and Mind now are  Mr  Glanville  having acquiesced in the Justice of this Remark as soon as Breakfast was over went to visit the two Ladies who generally drank their Chocolate together  Miss  Glanville  being then in Lady  Bella  's Apartment he was immediately admitted where he found them engaged in a high Dispute and much against his Will was obliged to be Arbitrator in the Affair they having upon his Entrance both appealed to him  But in order to place this momentous Affair in a true Light 'tis necessary to go back a little and acquaint the Reader with what had passed in the Apartment and also following the Custom of the Romance and NovelWriters in the Heart of our Heroine  No sooner were her fair Eyes open in the Morning than the unfortunate Sir  George  presenting himself to her Imagination her Thoughts to use  Scudery  's Phrase were at a cruel War with each other She wished to prevent the Death of this obsequious Lover but she could not resolve to preserve his Life by giving him that Hope he required and without which she  feared it would be impossible for him to live  After pondering a few Hours upon the Necessity of his Case and what a just Regard to her own Honour required of her Decorum prevailed so much over Compassion that she resolved to abandon the miserable Sir  George  to all the Rigour of his Destiny when happily for the disconsolate Lover the History of the fair  Amalazotha  coming into her Mind she remembred that this haughty Princess having refused to marry the Person her Father recommended to her because he had not a Crown upon his Head nevertheless when he was dying for Love of her condescended to visit him and even to give him a little Hope in order to preserve his Life See conceived it could be no Blemish to her Character if she followed the Example of this most glorious Princess and suffered herself to relax a little in her Severity to prevent the Effects of her Lover's Despair  Fear not  Arabella  said she to herself fear not to obey the Dictates of thy Compassion since the glorious  Amalazontha  justifies by her Example the Means thou wilt use to preserve a noble Life which depends upon a few Words thou shalt utter  When she had taken this Resolution she rung her Bell for her Women and as soon as she was dressed she dismissed them all but  Lucy  whom she ordered to bring her Paper and Pens telling her she would write an Answer to Sir  George  's Letter  Lucy  obeyed with great Joy but by that  time she had brought her Lady all the Materials for Writing her Mind was changed she having reflected that  Amalazontha  whose Example in order to avoid the Censure of future Ages she was resolved exactly to follow did not write to  Ambiome    but paid him a Visit she resolved to do the like and therefore bid  Lucy  take them away again telling her She had thought better of it and would not write to him  Lucy  extremely concerned at this Resolution obeyed her very slowly and with greeat seeming Regret  I perceive said  Arabella  you are afraid I shall abandon the unfortunate Man you solicitâ–ª for to the Violence of his Despair but tho' I do not intend to write to him yet I'll make use of a Method perhaps as effectual for to speak truly I mean to make him a Visit for by this time his Fever is I suppose violent enough to make him keep his Bed  And will you be so good Madam said  Lucy  to go and see the poor Gentleman I warrant you he will be ready to die for Joy when he sees you  There must be proper Precautions used said  Arabella  to prevent those Consequences which the sudden and unexpected Sight of me may produce Those about him I suppose will have Discretion enough for that Therefore give Orders for the Coach to be made ready and tell my Women they must attend me and be sure you give them Directions when I enter Sir  George  's Chamber to stay at a convenient Distance in order to leave me an Opportunity  of speaking to him without being heard As for you you may approach the Bedside with me since being my Confident you may hear all we have to say  Arabella  having thus settled the Ceremonial of her Visit according to the Rules prescribed by Romances sat down to her Teatable having sent to know if Miss  Glanville  was up and received for Answer that she would attend her at Breakfast  Arabella  who had at first determined to say nothing of this Affair to her Cousin could not resist the Desire she had of talking upon a Subject so interesting and telling her with a Smile that she was about to make a very charitable Visit that Morning asked her if she was disposed to bear her Company in it  I know you Country Ladies said Miss  Glanville  are very fond of visiting your sick Neighbours For my Part I do not love such a grave kind of Amusement yet for the sake of the Airing I shall be very willing to attend you  I think said  Arabella  with a more serious Air than before it behoves every generous Person to compassionate the Misfortunes of their Acquaintance and Friends and to relieve them as far as lies in their Power but those Miseries we ourselves occasion to others demand in a more particular Manner our Pity and if consistent with Honour our Relief  And pray returned Miss  Glanville  who is it you have done any Mischief to which you are to repair by this charitable Visit as you call it  The Mischief I have done replied  Arabella  blushing and casting down her Eyes was not voluntary I assure you Yet I will not scruple to repair it if I can tho' since my Power is confined by certain unavoidable Laws my Endeavours may not haply have all the Success I could wish  Well but dear Cousin interrupted Miss  Glanville  tell me in plain  English  what this Mischief is which you have done and to what Purpose you are going out this Morning  I am going to pay a Visit to Sir  George Bellmour  replied  Arabella  and I intreat you fair Cousin to pardon me for robbing you of so accomplished a Lover I really always thought he was in Love with you till I was undeceived by some Words he spoke Yesterday and a Letter I received from him last Night in which he has been bold enough to declare his Passion to me and through the Apprehension of my Anger is this Moment dying with Grief and 'tis to reconcile him to Life that I have prevailed upon myself to make him a Visit in which charitable Design as I said before I should be glad of your Company  Miss  Glanville  who believed not a Word Lady  Bella  had said burst out a laughing at a Speech that appeared to her so extremely false and ridiculous  I see said  Arabella  you are of a Humour to divert yourself with the Miseries of a despairing Lover and in this Particular you greatly resemble the fair and witty  Doralisa  who always jested at such Maladies as are occasioned by Love However this Insensibility  does not become you so well as her since all her Conduct was conformable to it no Marr in the World being bold enough to talk to her of Love but you Cousin are ready even by your own Confession to listen to such Discourses from any body and therefore this Behaviour in you may be with more Justice termed Levity than Indifference  I perceive Cousin said Miss  Glanville  I have always the worst of those Comparisons you are pleased to make between me and other People but I assure you as free and indiscreet as you think me I should very much scruple to visit a Man upon any Occasion whatever  I am quite astonished Miss  Glanville  resumed  Arabella  to hear you assume a Character of so much Severity you who have granted Favours of a Kind in a very great Degree criminal  Favours interrupted Miss  Glanville  criminal Favours Pray explain yourself Madam  Yes Cousin said  Arabella  I repeat it again criminal Favours such as allowing Persons to talk to you of Love not forbidding them to write to you giving them Opportunities of being alone with you for several Moments together and several other Civilities of the like Nature which no Man can possibly merit under many Years Services Fidelity and Pains All these are criminal Favours and highly blameable in a Lady who has any Regard for her Reputation  All these replied Miss  Glanville  are nothing in Comparison of making them Visits and  no Woman who has any Reputation at all will be guilty of taking such Liberties  What Miss replied  Arabella  will you dare by this Insinuation to cast any Censures upon the Virtue of the divine  Mandana  the haughty  Amalazontha  the fair  Statira  the cold and rigid  Parisatis  and many other illustrious Ladies who did not scruple to visit their Lovers when confined to their Beds either by the Wounds they received in Battle or the more cruel and dangerous ones they suffered from their Eyes These chaste Ladies who never granted a Kiss of their Hand to a Lover till he was upon the Point of being their Husband would nevertheless most charitably condescend to approach their Bedside and speak some compassionate Words to them in order to promote their Cure and make them submit to live nay these divine Beauties would not refuse to grant the same Favour to Persons whom they did not love to prevent the fatal Consequences of their Despair  Lord Madam interrupted Miss  Glanville  I wonder you can talk so blasphemously to call a Parcel of confident Creatures divine and such terrible Words  Do you know Miss said  Arabella  with a stern Look that 'tis of the greatest Princesses that ever were whom you speak in this irreverent Manner Is it possible that you can be ignorant of the sublime Quality of  Mandana  who was the Heiress of Two powerful Kingdoms Are you not sensible that  Amalazontha  was Queen of  Turringia  And will you pretend  to deny the glorious Extraction of  Statira  and  Parisatis  Princesses of  Persia  I shall not trouble myself to deny any thing about them Madam said Miss  Glanville  for I never heard of them before and really I do not choose to be always talking of Queens and Princesses as if I thought none but such great People were worthy my Notice It looks so affected I shuld imagine every one laughed at me that heard me  Since you are so very scrupulous returned  Arabella  that you dare not imitate the Sublimest among Mortals I can furnish you with many Examples from the Conduct of Persons whose Quality was not much superior to yours which may reconcile you to an Action you at present with so little Reason condemn And to name but One among some Thousands the fair  Cleonice  the most rigid and austere Beauty in all  Sardis  paid several Visits to the passionate  Ligdamis  when his Melancholy at the ill Success of his Passion threw him into a Fever that confined him to his Bed  And pray Madam who was that  Cleonice  said Miss  Glanville  and where did she live  In  Sardis  I tell you said  Arabella  in the Kingdom of  Lydia  Oh then it is not in our Kingdom said Miss  Glanville  What signifies what Foreigners do I shall never form my Conduct upon the Example of Outlandish People what is common enough in their Countries would be very particular here and you can never persuade me that it is seemly for Ladies to pay Visits to Men in their Beds  A Lady said  Arabella  extremely angry at her Cousin's Obstinacy who will suffer Men to press her Hand write to her and talk to her of Love ought to be ashamed of such an affected Niceness as that you pretend to  I insist upon it Madam said Miss  Glanville  that all those innocent Liberties you rail at may be taken by any Woman without giving the World room to censure her but without being very bold and impudent she cannot go to see Men in their Beds a Freedom that only becomes a Sister or near Relation  So then replied  Arabella  reddening with Vexation you will persist in affirming the divine  Mandana  was impudent  If she paid such indiscreet Visits as those she was said Miss  Glanville  Oh Heavens cried  Arabella  have I lived to hear the most illustrious Princess that ever was in the World so shamefully reflected on  Bless me Madam said Miss  Glanville  what Reason have you to defend the Character of this Princess so much She will hardly thank you for your Pains I fansy  Were you acquainted with the Character of that most generous Princess said  Arabella  you would be convinced that she was sensible of the smallest Benefits but it is not with a View of acquiring her Favour that I defend her against your inhuman Aspersions since it is more than Two thousand Years since she died yet common Justice obliges me to vindicate a Person so illustrious for her Birth and Virtue  and were you not my Cousin I should express my Resentment in another Manner for the Injury you do her  Truly said Miss  Glanville  I am not much obliged to you Madam for not downright quarrelling with me for one that has been in her Grave Two thousand Years However nothing shall make me change my Opinion and I am sure most People will be of my Side of the Argument  That Moment Mr  Glanville  sending for Permission to wait upon  Arabella  she ordered him to be admitted telling Miss  Glanville  she would acquaint her Brother with the Dispute To which she consented  CHAP II  Which inculcates by a very good Example that a Person ought not to be too hasty in deciding a Question he does not perfectly understand  YOU are come very opportunely Sir said  Arabella  when he entered the Room to be Judge of a great Controversy between Miss  Glanville  and myself I beseech you therefore let us have your Opinion upon the Matter  Miss  Glanville  maintains that it is less criminal in a Lady to hear Persons talk to her of Love allow them to kiss her Hand and permit them to write to her than to make a charitable Visit to a Man who is confined to his Bed  through the Violence of his Passion and Despair the Intent of this Visit being only to prevent the Death of an unfortunate Lover and if necessary to lay her Commands upon him to live  And this latter is your Opinion is it not Madam said Mr  Glanville  Certainly Sir replied  Arabella  and in this I am justified by all the Heroines of Antiquity  Then you must be in the Right Madam returned Mr  Glanville  both because your own Judgment tells you so and also the Example of these Heroines you mention  Well Madam interrupted Miss  Glanville  hastily since my Brother has given Sentence on your Side I hope you will not delay your Visit to Sir  George  any longer  How said Mr  Glanville  surprised is Lady  Bella  going to visit Sir  George  Pray Madam may I presume toinquire the Reason for your doing him this extraordinary Favour  You are not very wise said  Arabella  looking gravely upon Miss  Glanville  to discover a Thing which may haply create a Quarrel between your Brother and the unfortunate Person you speak of Yet since this Indiscretion cannot be recalled we must endeavour to prevent the Consequences of it  I assure you Madam interrupted Mr  Glanville  extremely impatient to know the Meaning of these Hints you have nothing to fear from me Therefore you need not think yourself under any Necessity of concealing this Affair from me  You are not haply so moderate as you pretend said  Arabella  who would not have been displeased to have seen him in all the jealous Transports of an enraged  Orontes  but whatever ensues I can no longer keep from your Knowledge a Truth your Sister has begun to discover but in telling you what you desire to know I expect you will suppress all Inclinations to Revenge and trust the Care of your Interest to my Generosity  You are to know then that in the Person of your Friend Sir  George  you have a Rival haply the more to be feared as his Passion is no less respectful than violent I possibly tell you more than I ought pursued she blushing and casting down her Eyes when I confess that for certain Considerations wherein perhaps you are concerned I have received the first Insinuation of this Passion with Disdain enough and I assure myself that you are too generous to desire any Revenge upon a miserable Rival of whom Death is going to free you  Then taking Sir  George  's Letter out of her Cabinet she presented it to Mr  Glanville  Read this added she but read it without suffering yourself to be transported with any violent Motions of Anger And as in Fight I am persuaded you would not oppress a fallen and vanquished Foe so in Love I may hope an unfortunate Rival will merit your Compassion  Never doubt it Madam replied Mr  Glanville  receiving the Letter which Miss  Glanville  with a beating Heart earnestly desired to hear read Her Brother after asking Permission of  Arabella  prepared to gratify her Curiosity but he no sooner read the first Sentence than notwithstanding all his Endeavours a Smile appeared in his Face and Miss  Glanville  less able and indeed less concerned to restrain her Mirth at the uncommon Stile burst out a laughing with so much Violence as obliged her Brother to stop and counterfeit a terrible Fit of Coughing in order to avoid giving  Arabella  the like Offence  The Astonishment of this Lady at the surprising and unexpected Effect her Lover's Letter produced on Miss  Glanville  kept her in a profound Silence her Eyes wandering from the Sister to the Brother who continuing his Cough was not able for some Moments to go on with his Reading  Arabella  during this Interval having recovered herself a little asked Miss  Glanville  if she found any thing in a Lover's Despair capable of diverting her so much as she seemed to be with that of the unfortunate Sir  George  My Sister Madam said Mr  Glanville  preventing her Reply knows so many of Sir  George  's Infidelities that she cannot persuade herself he is really in such a dangerous Way as he insinuates Therefore you ought not to be surprised if she is rather disposed to laugh at this Epistle than to be moved with any Concern for the Writer who though he is my Rival I must say appears to be in a deplorable Condition  Pray Sir resumed  Arabella  a little composed by those Words finish the Letter Your  Sister may possibly find more Cause for Pity than Contempt in the latter Part of it  Mr  Glanville  giving a Look to his Sister sufficient to make her comprehend that he would have her restrain her Mirth for the future proceeded in his Reading but every Line increasing his strong Inclination to laugh when he came to the pathetic Wish that her fair Eyes might shed some Tears upon his Tomb no longer able to keep his assumed Gravity he threw down the Letter in a counterfeited Rage  Curse the stupid Fellow cried he is he mad to call the finest Black Eyes in the Universe fair Ah Cousin said he to  Arabella  to must be little acquainted with the Influence of your Eyes since he can so egregiously mistake their Colour  And it is very plain replied  Arabella  that you are little acquainted with the sublime Language in which he writes since you find Fault with an Epithet which marks the Beauty not the Colour of those Eyes he praises for in fine Fair is indifferently applied as well to Black and Brown Eyes as to Light and Blue ones when they are either really lovely in themselves or by the Lover's Imagination created so And therefore since Sir  George  's Prepossession has made him see Charms in my Eyes which questionless are not there by calling them fair he has very happily expressed himself since therein he has the Sanction of those great Historians who wrote the Histories of Lovers he seems to imitate as well in his Actions as Stile  I find my Rival is very happy in your Opinion Madam said Mr  Glanville  and I am apt to believe I shall have more Reason to envy than pity his Situation  If you keep within the Bounds I prescribe you replied  Arabella  you shall have no Reason to envy his Situation but considering the Condition to which his Despair has by this Time certainly reduced him Humanity requires that we should take some Care of him and to shew you how great my Opinion of your Generosity is I will even intreat you to accompany me in the Visit I am going to make him  Mr  Glanville  being determined if possible to prevent her exposing herself affected to be extremely moved at this Request and rising from his Chair in great seeming Agitation traversed the Room for some Moments without speaking a Word Then suddenly stopping  And can you Madam said he looking upon  Arabella  suppose that I will consent to your visiting my Rival and that I will be mean enough to attend you myself to his House Do you think that  Orontes  you have often reproached me with would act in such a Manner  I don't know how  Orontes  would have acted in this Case said  Arabella  because it never happened that such a Proof of his Submission was ever desired of him but considering that he was of a very fiery and jealous Disposition it is probable he might act as you do  I always understood Madam said Mr  Glanville  that  Orontes  was a Favourite of yours but it seems I was mistaken  You will be very unjust said  Arabella  to draw any unfavourable Conclusion from what I have said to the Prejudice of that valiant Prince for whom I confess I have a great Esteem and truly whoever reflects upon the great Actions he did in the Wars between the  Amazons  and the fierce  Naobarzanes  King of the  Cilicians  must needs conceive a very high Idea of his Virtue but if I cannot bring the Example of  Orontes  to influence you in the present Case I can mention those of other Persons no less illustrious for their Birth and Courage than him Did not the brave  Memnon  when his Rival  Oxyatres  was sick intreat the beautiful  Barsina  to favour him with a Visit And the complaisant Husband of the divine  Parisatis  was not contented with barely desiring her to visit  Lysimachus  who was dying with Despair at her Marriage but would many times bring her himself to the Bedside of this unfortunate Lover and leaving her there give him an Opportunity of telling her what he suffered for her sake  I am afraid Madam said Mr  Glanville  I shall never be capable of imitating either the brave  Memnon  nor the complaisant  Lysimachus  in this Case and the Humour of  Orontes  seems to me the most commendable  Nevertheless said  Arabella  the Humour of  Orontes  cost him an infinite Number of Pains and it may happen you will as near resemble him in his Fortune as you do in his Disposition But pray let us end this Dispute at present If you are not generous enough to visit an unfortunate Rival you shall not put a Stop to  the Charity of my Intentions and since Miss  Glanville  is all of a sudden become so severe that she will not accompany me in this Visit I shall be contented with the Attendance of my Women  Saying this she rose from her Seat calling  Lucy  and ordered her to bid her Companions attend  Mr  Glanville  seeing her thus determined was almost mad with Vexation  Upon my Soul Madam said he feizing her Hand you must not go  How Sir said  Arabella  sternly  Not without seeing me die first resumed he in a languishing Tone  You must not die replied  Arabella  a little softened nor must you pretend to hinder me from going  Nay Madam said  Glanville  one of these two Things will certainly happen Either you must resolve not to visit Sir  George  or else be contented to see me die at your Feet  Was ever any Lady in so cruel a Dilemma said  Arabella  throwing herself into the Chair in a languishing Posture What can I do to prevent the Fate of two Persons one of whom I infinitely pity and the other obstinate as he is I cannot hate Shall I resolve to let the miserable  Bellmour  die rather than grant him a Favour the most rigid Virtue would not refuse him or shall I by opposing the impetuous Humour of a Lover to whom I am somewhat obliged make myself the Author of his Death Fatal Necessity which obliges me either to be cruel or unjust and with a Disposition  to neither makes me in some Degree guilty of both  CHAP III  In which our Heroine is in some little Confusion  WHILE  Arabella  was uttering this pathetic Complaint Mr  Glanville  with great Difficulty kept himself from smiling and by some supplicating Looks to his Sister prevented her laughing out yet she gigled in secret behind her Fan But  Arabella  was so lost in her melancholy Reflections that she kept her Eyes immoveably fixed on the Ground for some Moments At last casting an upbraiding Glance at  Glanville  Is it possible cruel Person that you are said she to him that you can without Pity see me suffer so much Uneasiness and knowing the Sensibility of my Temper can expose me to the Grief of being accessary to the Death of an unfortunate Man guilty indeed of a too violent Passion which merits a gentler Punishment than that you doom him to  Don't be uneasy dear Cousin interrupted Miss  Glanville  I dare assure you Sir  George  won't die  It is impossible to think that said  Arabella  since he has not so much as received a Command from me to live but tell me truly pursued she do you believe it probable that he will obey me and live  Indeed Madam said Miss  Glanville  I could swear for him that he will  Well replied  Arabella  I will content myself with sending him my Commands in Writing but it is to be feared they will not have so much Efficacy upon his Spirit  Mr  Glanville  extremely pleased that she had laid aside her Design of visiting Sir  George  did not oppose her writing to him though he was plotting how to prevent the Letter reaching his Hands and while she went into her Closet to write he conferred with his Sister upon the Means he should use expressing at the same time great Resentment against Sir  George  for endeavouring to supplant him in his Cousin's Affection  What then said Miss  Glanville  do you really imagine Sir  George  is in Love with Lady  Bella  He is either in Love with her Person or Estate replied Mr  Glanville  or perhaps with both for she is handsome enough to gain a Lover of his Merit though she had no Fortune and she has Fortune enough to do it though she had no Beauty  My Cousin is well enough to be sure said Miss  Glanville  but I never could think her a Beauty  If replied Mr  Glanville  a most lovely Complection regular Features a fine Stature an elegant Shape and an inexpressible Grace in all her Motions can form a Beauty Lady  Bella  may pretend to that Character without any Dispute  Though she was all that you say returned Miss  Glanville  I am certain Sir  George  is not in Love with her  I wish I was certain of that replied Mr  Glanville  for 'tis very probable you are mistaken  You may see by his Letter interrupted Miss  Glanville  what a Jest he makes of her and if you had heard how he talked to her the other Day in the Garden you would have died with Laughing yet my poor Cousin thought he was very serious and was so foolishly pleased  I assure you  Charlotte  said Mr  Glanville  gravely I shall take it very ill if you make so free with your Cousin's little Foibles and if Sir  George  presumes to make a Jest of her as you say I shall teach him better Manners  You are the strangest Creature in the World said Miss  Glanville  A Minute or two ago you was wishing to be sure he was not in Love with her and now you are angry when I assure you he is only in Jest  Arabella  that Moment coming out of her Closet broke off their Discourse I have written to Sir  George  said she addressing herself to Mr  Glanville  and you are at Liberty if you please to read my Letter which I propose to send away immediately  Mr  Glanville  taking the Letter out of her Hand with a low Bow began to read it to himself but  Arabella  willing his Sister should also be acquainted with the Contents obliged him much against his Will to read it aloud It was as follows  Arabella  To  Bellmour  WHATEVER Offence your presumptuous Declaration may have given me yet my Resentment will be appeased with a less Punishment than Death And that Grief and Submission you have testified in your Letter may haply have already procured you Pardon for your Fault provided you do not forfeit it by Disobedience  I therefore command you to live and command you by all that Power you have given me over you  Remember I require no more of you than  Parisatis  did of  Lysimachus  in a more cruel and insupportable Misfortune Imitate then the Obedience and Submission of that illustrious Prince and tho' you should be as unfortunate as he let your Courage also be equal to his and like him be contented with the Esteem that is offered you since it is all that can be bestowed by  Arabella  Mr  Glanville  finding by this Epistle that  Arabella  did not design to encourage the Addresses of Sir  George  would not have been against his receiving it had he not feared the Consequence of his having such a convincing Proof of the Peculiarity of her Temper in his Possession and while he kept the Letter in his Hand as if he wanted to consider it a little better he meditated on the Means to prevent its being ever delivered and had possibly fixed upon some successful Contrivance when a  Servant coming in to inform the Ladies that Sir  George  was come to wait on them put an End to his Schemes and he immediately ran down to receive him not being willing to increase by his Stay the Astonishment and Confusion which appeared in the Countenance of  Arabella  at hearing a Man whom she had believed and represented to be dying was come to pay her a Visit  CHAP IV  Where the Lady extricates herself out of her former Confusion to the great Astonishment we will suppose of the Reader  MISS  Glanville  not having so much Delicacy as her Brother could not help exulting a little upon this Occasion  After the terrible Fright you have been in Madam said she upon Sir  George  's Account I wonder you do not rather think it is his Ghost than himself that is come to see us  There is no Question but it is himself that is come said  Arabella  who had already reconciled this Visit to her first Thoughts of him and it is haply to execute his fatal Design in my Presence that has brought him here and like the unfortunate  Agilmond  he means to convince me of his Fidelity and Love by falling upon his Sword before my Eyes  Bless me Madam said Miss  Glanville  what horrid Things come into your Head I vow you terrify me out of my Wits to hear you  There is no Occasion for your Fears interrupted  Arabella  Since we already suspect his Designs it will be very easy to prevent them Had the Princess of the  Sarmatians  known the fatal Intentions of her despairing Lover doubtless she would have used some Precautions to hinder him from executing them for want of which she saw the miserable  Agilmond  weltering in his Blood at her Feet and with Reason accused herself of being the Cause of so deplorable a Spectacle  The Astonishment Miss  Glanville  was in to hear her Cousin talk in this Manner kept her from giving her any Interruption while she related several other terrible Instances of Despair  In the mean time Sir  George  who was impatient to go up to Lady  Bella  's Apartment having flattered himself with an Hope that his Letter was favourably received and that he should be permitted to  hope  at least made a short Visit to Sir  Charles  in his own Room and accompanied by Mr  Glanville  who was resolved to see in what manner  Arabella  received him went to her Apartment  As he had taken care at his Entrance to accommodate his Looks to the Character he had assumed of an humble despairing Lover  Arabella  no sooner saw him but her Countenance changed and making a Sign to Mr  Glanville  who could not comprehend what she meant to seize upon the Guard of his Sword she hastily stept forward to meet him  I am too well convinced said she to Sir  George  that the Intent of your coming hither To day is to commit some Violence against yourself before my Eyes But listen not I beseech you to the Dictates of your Despair Live I command you live and since you say I have the absolute Disposal of your Life do not deprive yourself of it without the Consent of her on whom you profess to have bestowed it  Sir  George  who did not imagine  Arabella  would communicate his Letter to her Cousins and only expected some distant Hints from her concerning it was so confounded at this Reception before them that he was not able to reply He blushed and turned pale alternately and not daring to look either upon Miss  Glanville  or her Brother or to meet the Eyes of the fair Visionary who with great Impatience expected his Answer he hung down his Head in a very silly Posture and by his Silence confirmed  Arabella  in her Opinion  As he did not want for Wit and Assurance during that Interval of Silence and Expectation from all Parties his Imagination suggested to him the Means of extricating himself out of the ridiculous Perplexity he was in and as it concerned him greatly to avoid any Quarrel with the Brother and Sister he determined to turn the whole Matter into a Jest but if possible to manage it so that  Arabella  should not enter into his Meaning  Raising therefore his Eyes and looking upon  Arabella  with a melancholy Air  You are not deceived Madam said he This Criminal with whom you are so justly offended comes with an Intention to die at your Feet and breathe out his miserable Life to expiate those Crimes of which you accuse him But since your severe Compassion will oblige me to live I obey oh most divine but cruel  Arabella  I obey your harsh Commands and by endeavouring to live give you a more convincing Proof of that Respect and Submission I shall always have for your Will  I expected no less from your Courage and Generosity said  Arabella  with a Look of great Complacency and since you so well know how to imitate the great  Lysimachus  in your Obedience I shall not be less acknowleging then the fair  Parisatis  but will have for you an Esteem equal to that Virtue I have observed in you  Sir  George  having received this gracious Promise with a most profound Bow turned to Mr  Glanville  with a kind of chastened Smile upon his Countenance  And you fortunate and deserving Knight said he happy in the Affections of the fairest Person in the World grudge me not this small Alleviation of my Misfortunes and envy me not that Esteem which alone is able to make me suffer Life while you possess in the Heart of the divine  Arabella  a Felicity that might be envied by the greatest Monarchs in the World  As diverting as this Scene was Mr  Glanville  was extremely uneasy For though Sir  George  's Stratagem took and he believed he  was only indulging the Gaiety of his Humour by carrying on this Farce yet he could not endure he should divert himself at  Arabella  's Expence The solemn Speech he had made him did indeed force him to smile but he soon assumed a graver Look and told Sir  George  in a low Voice that when he had finished his Visit he should be glad to take a Turn with him in the Garden  Sir  George  promised to follow him and Mr  Glanville  left the Room and went into the Gardens where the Baronet having taken a respectful Leave of  Arabella  and by a sly Glance convinced Miss  Glanville  he had sacrificed her Cousin to her Mirth went to join her Brother  Mr  Glanville  as soon as he saw him walked to meet him with a very reserved Air Which Sir  George  observing and being resolved to keep up his Humour  What inhuman but too happy Lover said he what am I to understand by that Cloud upon your Brow Is it possible that thou canst envy me the small Comfort I have received and not satisfied with the glorious Advantages thou possessest wilt thou still deny me that Esteem which the divine  Arabella  has been pleased to bestow upon me  Pray Sir  George  said Mr  Glanville  lay aside this pompous Style I am not disposed to be merry at present and have not all the Relish for this kind of Wit that you seem to expect I desired to see you here that I might tell you without Witnesses I take it extremely ill you should presume to make my Cousin  the Object of your Mirth Lady  Bella  Sir is not a Person with whom such Liberties ought to be taken nor will I in the double Character of her Lover and Relation suffer it from any one whatever  Cruel Fortune said Sir  George  stepping back a little and lifting up his Eyes shall I always be exposed to thy Persecutions And must I without any apparent Cause behold an Enemy in the Person of my Friend who though without murmuring I resign to him the adorable  Arabella  is yet resolved to dispute with me a Satisfaction which does not deprive him of any Part of that glorious Fortune to which he is destined Since it is so unjust and cruel Friend pursued he strike this Breast which carries the Image of the divine  Arabella  but think not that I will offer to defend myself or lift my Sword against a Man beloved by her  This is all very fine returned Mr  Glanville  hardly able to forbear laughing but 'tis impossible with all your Gaiety to hinder me from being serious upon this Business  Then be as serious as thou wilt dear  Charles  interrupted Sir  George  provided you will allow me to be gay and not pretend to infect me with thy unbecoming Gravity  I have but a few Words to say to you then Sir replied Mr  Glanville  Either behave with more Respect to my Cousin or prepare to give me Satisfaction for the Insults you offer her  Oh I understand you Sir said Sir  George  and because you have taken it into your Head  to be offended at a Trifle of no Consequence in the World I must give you a fair Chance to run me through the Body There is something very foolish saith in such an extravagant Expectation But since Custom has made it necessary that a Man must venture his Soul and Body upon these important Occasions because I will not be out of the Fashion you shall command me whenever you think sit though I shall fight with my Schoolfellow with a very ill Will I assure you  There is no Necessity for fighting said Mr  Glanville  blushing at the ludicrous Light in which the gay Baronet had placed his Challenge The Concession I have required is very small and not worth the contesting for on your Side Lady  Beila  's Peculiarity to which you contribute so much can afford you at best but an illnatured Diversion while it gives me a real Pain and sure you must acknowlege you are doing me a very great Injury when you endeavour to confirm a Lady who is to be my Wife in a Behaivour that excites your Mirth and makes her a fit Object for your Ridicule and Contempt  You do Lady  Bella  a mnch greater Injury than I do replied Sir  George  by supposing she can ever be an Object of Ridicule and Contempt I think very highly of her Understanding and though the Bent of her Studies has given her Mind a romantic Turn yet the Singularity of her Manners is far less disagreeable than the lighter Follies of most of her Sex  But to be absolutely perfect interrupted Mr  Glanville  I must cure her of that Singularity and therefore I beg you will not persist in assuming a Behaviour conformable to her romantic Ideas but rather help me to banish them from her Imagination  Well replied Sir  George  since you no longer threaten I'll do what I can to content you but I must quit my Heroics by Degrees and sink with Decency into my own Character otherwise she will never endure me in her Presence  Arabella  and Miss  Glanville  appearing in the Walk broke off the Conversation The Baronet and Mr  Glanville  walked forward to meet them but  Arabella  who did not desire Company struck into another Walk whither Mr  Glanville  following proposed to join her when he saw his Father who had been taking a Turn there alone make up to  Arabella  and supposing he would take that Op+portunity to talk to her concerning him he went back to his Sister and Sir  George  whose Conversation he interrupted to the great Regret of Miss  Glanville  CHAP V  In which will be found one of the former Mistakes pursued and another cleared up to the great Satisfaction of Two Persons among whom the Reader we expect will make a Third  ARABELLA  no sooner saw Sir  Charles  advancing towards her when sensible of the Consequence of being alone with a Person whom she did not doubt would make use of that Advantage to talk to her of Love she endeavoured to avoid him but in vain for Sir  Charles  guessing her Intentions walked hastily up to her and taking hold of her Hand  You must not go away Lady  Bella  said he I have something to say to you  Arabella  extremely discomposed at this Behaviour struggled to free her Hand from her Uncle and giving him a Look on which Disdain and Fear were visibly painted  Unhand me Sir said she and force me not to forget the Respect I owe you as my Uncle by treating you with a Severity such uncommon Insolence demands  Sir  Charles  letting go her Hand in a great Surprize at the Word Insolent which she had used asked her If she knew to whom she was speaking  Questionless I am speaking to my Uncle replied she and 'tis with great Regret I see myself obliged to make use of Expressions no  way conformable to the Respect I bear that sacred Character  And pray Madam said Sir  Charles  somewhat softened by this Speech who is it that obliges you to lay aside that Respect you seem to acknowlege is due to your Uncle  You do Sir replied she and 'tis with infinite Sorrow that I beheld you assuming a Character unbecoming the Brother of my Father  This is pretty plain indeed interrupted Sir  Charles  But pray Madam inform me what it is you complain of  You questionless know much better than I can tell you replied  Arabella  blushing the Offence I accuse you of nor is it proper for me to mention what it would not become me to suffer  Zounds cried Sir  Charles  no longer able to suppress his growing Anger this is enough to make a Man mad  Ah I beseech you Sir resumed  Arabella  suffer not an unfortunate and illjudged Passion to be the Bane of all your Happiness and Virtue Recall your wandring Thoughts reflect upon the Dishonour you will bring upon yourself by persisting in such unjustifiable Sentiments  I do not know how it is possible to avoid it said Sir  Charles  and notwithstanding all this fine Reasoning there are few People but would fly into greater Extremities but my Affection for you makes me  Hold hold I conjure you Sir interrupted  Arabella  force me not to listen to such injurious  Language carry that odious Affection somewhere else and do not persecute an unfortunate Maid who has contributed nothing to thy Fault and is only guilty of too much Compassion for thy Weakness  Good God cried Sir  Charles  starting back and looking upon  Arabella  with Astonishment how I pity my Son What would I not give if he did not love this Girl  Think not replied  Arabella  that the Passion your Son has for me makes your Condition a bit the worse for I would be such as I am with respect to you were there no Mr  Glanville  in the World  I never thought Niece said Sir  Charles  after a little Pause that any Part of my Behaviour could give you the Offence you complain of or authorize that Hatred and Contempt you take the Liberty to express for me But since it is so I promise you I will quit your House and leave you to your self I have always been solicitous for your Welfare and ungrateful as you are  Call me not ungrateful interrupted  Arabella  again Heaven is my Witness that had you not forgot I was your Niece I would have always remembred you was my Uncle and not only have regarded you as such but have looked upon you as another Father under whose Direction Providence had placed me since it had deprived me of my real Father and whose Tenderness and Care might have in some measure supplied the Loss I had of him But Heaven has decreed it otherwise and since it is his Will that I should be deprived of the  Comfort and Assistance my Orphan State requires I must submit without murmuring to my Destiny Go then unfortunate and lamented Uncle pursued she wiping some Tears from her fine Eyes go and endeavour by Reason and Absence to recover thy Repose and be assured whenever you can convince me you have triumphed over these Sentiments which now cause both our Unhappiness you shall have no Cause to complain of my Conduct towards you  Finishing these Words she left him with so much Speed that it would have been impossible for him to have stopped her though he had intended it But indeed he was so lost in Wonder and Confusion at a Behaviour for which he was not able to assign any other Cause than Madness that he remained fixed in the same Posture of Surprize in which she had left him and from which he was first interrupted by the Voice of his Son who seeing  Arabella  flying towards the House in great seeming Emotion came to know the Result of their Conversation  Sir said Mr  Glanville  who had spoken to his Father before but had no Answer will you not inform me what Success you have had with my Cousin How did she receive your Proposal  Speak of her no more said Sir  Charles  she is a proud ungrateful Girl and unworthy the Affection you have for her  Mr  Glanville  who trembled to hear so unfavourable an Answer to his Inquiries was struck dumb with his Surprize and Grief when  Sir  Charles  taking Notice of the Alteration in his Countenance  I am sorry said he to find you have set your Heart upon this fantastic Girl If ever she be your Wife which I very much doubt she will make you very unhappy But  Charles  pursued he I would advise you to think no more of her content yourself with the Estate you gain by her Refusal of you With that Addition to your own Fortune you may pretend to any Lady whatever and you will find many that are full as agreeable as your Cousin who will be proud of your Addresses  Indeed Sir said Mr  Glanville  with a Sigh there is no Woman upon Earth whom I would choose to marry but Lady  Bella  I flattered myself I had been happy enough to have made some Progress in her Affection but it seems I was mistaken however I should be glad to know if she gave you any Reasons for refusing me  Reasons said Sir  Charles  There is no making her hear Reason or expecting Reason from her I never knew so strange a Woman in my Life She would not allow me to speak what I intended concerning you but interrupted me every Moment with some highflown Stuff or other  Then I have not lost all Hopes of her cried Mr  Glanville  eagerly for since she did not hear what you had to say she could not possibly deny you  But she behaved in a very impertinent Manner to me interrupted Sir  Charles  complained of my harsh Treatment of her and said several  other Things which because of her uncommon Style I could not perfectly understand yet they seemed shocking and upon the Whole treated me so rudely that I am determined to leave her to herself and trouble my Head no more about her  For God's sake dear Sir said Mr  Glanville  alarmed at this Resolution suspend your Anger till I have seen my Cousin There is some Mistake I am persuaded in all this I know she has some very odd Humours which you are not so well acquainted with as I am I'll go to her and prevail upon her to explain herself  You may do so if you please replied Sir  Charles  but I fear it will be to very little Purpose for I really suspect her Head is a little turned I do not know what to do with her It is not fit she should have the Management of herself and yet 'tis impossible to live upon easy Terms with her  Mr  Glanville  who did not doubt but  Arabella  had been guilty of some very ridiculous Folly offered nothing more in her Justification but having attended his Father to his own Chamber went to  Arabella  's Apartment  He found the pensive Fairone in a melancholy Posture her Head reclined upon one of her fair Hands and though her Eyes were fixed upon a Book she held in the other yet she did not seem to read but rather to be wholly buried in Contemplation  Mr  Glanville  having so happily found her alone for her Women were not then in her Chamber seated himself near her having first  asked Pardon for the Interruption he had given to her Studies and  Arabella  throwing aside her Book prepared to listen to his Discourse which by the Agitation which appeared in Looks she imagined would be upon some extraordinary Subject  I left my Father just now said he in a great deal of Uneasiness on account of something you said to him Lady  Bella  He apprehends you are disobliged and he would willingly know how  Has your Father then acquainted you with the Subject of our Conversation interrupted  Arabella  I know what would have been the Subject of your Conversation replied Mr  Glanville  if you had been pleased to listen to what Sir  Charles  intended to say to you on my Behalf  On your Behalf interrupted  Arabella  Ah poor deceived  Glanville  how I pity thy blind Sincerity But it is not for me to undeceive thee Only thus much I must say to you Beware of committing your Interests to a Person who will be a much better Advocate for another than for you  Mr  Glanville  rejoiced to find by these Words that her Resentment against his Father was occasioned by a Suspicion so favourable for him assured her that Sir  Charles  wished for nothing more earnestly than that he might be able to merit her Esteem and that it was to dispose her to listen to his Addresses that he wanted to discourse with her that Morning  Mr  Glanville  being obliged through his Knowlege of his Cousin's Temper to speak to her in this distant Manner went on with his Assurances of his Father's Candour in this Respect and  Arabella  who would not declare her Reasons for doubting it only replied That she wished Sir  Charles  meant all that he had said to him but that she could not persuade herself to believe him sincere till his future Actions had convinced her he was so  Mr  Glanville  impatient to let his Father know how greatly he had been mistaken in the Cause of  Arabella  's Behaviour made his Visit shorter than he would otherwise have done in order to undeceive him  It is possible said Sir  Charles  when his Son had repeated the Conversation he had just had with  Arabella  that she could be so foolish as to imagine I had a Design to propose any one else to her but you What Reason have I ever given her to think I would not be glad to have her for my Daughterinlaw Indeed she has some odd Ways that are very disagreeable but she is one of the best Matches in  England  for all that Poor Girl pursued he she had Reason to be angry if that was the Case and now I remember she cried when I told her I would leave the House yet her Spirit was so great that she told me I might go Well I'll go and make it up with her but who could have imagined she would have been so foolish Sir  Charles  at the Repetition of these Words hurried away to  Arabella  's Apartment  Niece said he at his Entrance I am come to ask you Pardon for having led you into a Belief that I meant  'Tis enough Sir interrupted  Arabella  I grant you my Pardon for what is past and as it does not become me to receive Submissions from my Uncle while he remembers he is so I will dispense with your Acknowlegements at present Only to convince me that this sudden Alteration is sincere avoid I beseech you for the future all Occasions of displeasing me  I protest cried Sir  Charles  that I never intended  I will not hear you say a Word more of your past Intentions interrupted  Arabella  again I have forgot them all and while you continue to regard me as your Niece I will never remember them to your Disadvantage  Then I may hope said Sir  Charles    Oh Heavens cried  Arabella  not suffering him to proceed do you come to insult me thus with a mock Repentance And has my Easiness in being so ready to forget the Injury you would have done me made you presumptuous enough to cherish an insolent Hope that I will ever change my Resolution  How vexatious is this replied Sir  Charles  fretting to see her continually mistaking him I swear to you by all that is sacred that 'tis my Son for whom I would solicit your Consent  How said  Arabella  astonished Will you then be just at last And can you resolve to plead for that Son whose Interest but a Moment ago you would have destroyed  I see said Sir  Charles  it is impossible to convince you  No no interrupted  Arabella  hastily it is not impossible but my own ardent Wishes that it may be so will help to convince me of the Truth of what you say For in fine do you think I shall not be as glad as yourself to find you capable of acting honourably by your Son and to see myself no longer the Cause of the most unjustifiable Conduct imaginable  Sir  Charles  was opening his Mouth to press her in Favour of Mr  Glanville  whom notwithstanding her strange Behaviour he was glad to find she loved when  Arabella  preventing him  Seek not I beseech you said she to destroy that Belief I am willing to give your Words by any more Attempts at this time to persuade me for truly I shall interpret your Solicitude no way in your Favour therefore if you desire I should be convinced you are sincere let the Silence I require of you be one Proof of it  Sir  Charles  who looked excessively out of Countenance at such a peremptory Command from his Niece was going out of her Chamber in a very ill Humour when the Dinnerbell ringing she gave him her Hand with a very gracions Air and permitted him to lead her into the Diningroom where they found Mr  Glanville  his Sister and Sir  George  who had been detained to Dinner by Miss  Glanville  expecting their coming  CHAP VI  Containing some Account of Thalestris Queen of the Amazons with other curious Anecdotes  LADY  Bella  having recovered her usual Chearfulness thro' the Satisfaction she felt at her Uncle's returning to Reason and the Abatement she perceived in Sir  George  's extreme Melancholy mixed in the Conversation with that Wit and Vivacity which was natural to her and which so absolutely charmed the whole Company that not one of them remembred any of her former Extravagancies  Mr  Glanville  gazed on her with a passionate Tenderness Sir  George  with Admiration and the old Baronet with Wonder and Delight  But Miss  Glanville  who was inwardly vexed at the Superiority her Cousin's Wit gave her over herself wished for nothing more than an Opportunity of interrupting a Conversation in which she could have no Share and willing to put them in mind of some of  Arabella  's strange Notions when she observed them disputing concerning some of the Actions of the antient  Romans  she very innocently asked Sir  George  Whether in former times Women went to the Wars and fought like Men For my Cousin added she talks of one  Thaltris  a Woman that was as courageous as any Soldier whatever  Mr  Glanville  horridly vexed at a Question that was likely to engage  Arabella  in a Discourse very different from that she had been so capable of pleasing in frowned very intelligibly at his Sister and to prevent any Answer being given to her absurd Demand directed some other Conversation to  Arabella  But she who saw a favourite Subject started took no Notice of what Mr  Glanville  was saying to her but directing her Looks to Sir  George  Though Miss  Glanville  said she be a little mistaken in the Name of that fair Queen she has mentioned yet I am persuaded you know whom she means and that it is the renowned  Thalestris  whose Valour staggers her Belief and of whom she wants to be informed  Ay ay  Thalestris  said Miss  Glanville  It is such a strange Name I could not remember it but pray was there ever such a Person  Certainly Madam there was replied Sir  George  She was Queen of the  Amazons  a warlike Nation of Women who possessed great Part of  Cappadocia  and extended their Conquests so far that they became formidable to all their Neighbours  You find Miss said  Arabella  I did not attempt to impose upon you when I told you of the admirable Valour of that beautiful Queen which indeed was so great that the united Princes in whose Cause she fought looked upon her Assistance to be equal to that of a whole Army and they honoured her accordingly with the most distinguishing Marks of their Esteem and Acknowlegement and offered her the chief Command of their Forces  O shameful cried Sir  Charles  offer a Woman the Command of an Army Brave Fellows indeed that would be commanded by a Woman Sure your mistake Niece there never was such a thing heard of in the World  What Sir said  Arabella  will you contradict a Fact attested by the greatest Historians that ever were You may as well pretend to say there never were such Persons as  Oroondates  or  Juba  as dispute the Existence of the famous  Thalestris  Why pray Madam said Sir  Charles  who were those  One of them replied  Arabella  was the great King of  Scythia  and the other Prince of the Two  Mauritanias  Odsheart interrupted Sir  Charles  I believe their Kingdoms are in the Moon I never heard of  Scythia  or the Two  Mauritanias  before  And yet Sir replied  Arabella  those Kingdoms are doubtless as well known as  France  or  England  and there is no Question but the Descendants of the great  Oroondates  and the valiant  Juba  sway the Sceptres of them to this Day  I must confess said Sir  George  I have a very great Admiration for those Two renowned Princes and have read their beautiful Exploits with infinite Pleasure notwithstanding which I am more inclined to esteem the great  Artaban  then either of them  Though  Artaban  replied  Arabella  is without Question a Warrior equal to either of them and haply no Person in the World possessed so sublime a Courage as his was yet it may be  your Partiality proceeds from another Cause and you having the Honour to resemble him in some little Infidelities he was accused of with less Justice than yourself perhaps induces you to favour him more than any other  Arabella  blushed when she ended these Words And Sir  George  replied with a Sigh  I have indeed the Honour Madam to resemble the great  Artaban  in having dared to raise my Thoughts towards a Divine Person who with Reason condemns my Adorations  Heyday cried Sir  Charles  are you going to speak of Divine Things after all the Fables you have been talking of Troth I love to hear young Men enter upon such Subjects But pray Niece who told you Sir  George  was an Infidel  Mr  Glanville  replied  Arabella  And I am inclined to think he spoke Truth for Sir  George  has never pretended to deny it  How interrupted Sir  Charles  I am sorry to hear that I hope you have never added he looking at the young Baronet endeavoured to corrupt my Son with any of your Freethinking Principles I am for every body having Liberty of Conscience but I cannot endure to hear People of your Stamp endeavouring to propagate your mischievous Notions and because you have no Regard for your own future Happiness disturbing other People in the laudable Pursuit of theirs  We will not absolutely condemn Sir  George  said  Arabella  till we have heard his History from his own Mouth which he promised some time ago to relate when I desired it  I do not imagine his History is fit to be heard by Ladies said Sir  Charles  for your Infidels live a strange kind of Life  However that may be replied  Arabella  we must not dispense with Sir  George  from performing his Promise I dare say there are no Ladies here who will think the worse of him for freely confessing his Faults  You may answer for yourself if you please Madam said Sir  Charles  but I hope my Girl there will not say as much  I dare say my Cousin is not so rigid said  Arabella  She has too much the Spirit of  Julia  in her to find Fault with a little Infidelity  I am always obliged to you for your Comparisons Cousin said Miss  Glanville  I suppose this is greatly to my Advantage too  I assure you Madam said Sir  George  Lady  Bella  has done you no Injury by the Comparison she has just now made for  Julia  was one of the finest Princesses in the World  Yet she was not free from the Suspicion of Infidelity replied  Arabella  but though I do not pretend to tax my Cousin with that Fault yet it is with a great deal of Reason that I say she resembles her in her volatile Humour  I was never thought to be illhumoured in my Life Madam said Miss  Glanville  colouring and I cannot imagine what Reason I have given you for saying I am  Nay Cousin said  Arabella  I am not condemning your Humour for to say the Truth there are a great many Charms in a volatile Disposition and notwithstanding the admirable Beauty of  Julia  it is possible she made as  many Slaves by her light and airy Carriage as she did by her Eyes though they were the fairest in the World except the divine  Cleopatra  's  Cleopatra  cried Sir  Charles  Why she was a Gypsey was she not  I never heard her called so said  Arabella  gravely and I am apt to believe you are not at all acquainted with her But pray pursued she let us wave this Discourse at present and prepare to listen to Sir  George  's Relation of his Life which I dare say is full of very extraordinary Events However Sir added she directing her Speech to the young Baronet I am afraid your Modesty will induce you to speak with less Candour than you ought of those great Actions which questionless you have performed Therefore we shall hear your History with greater Satisfaction from the Mouth of your faithful 'Squire who will not have the same Reasons that you have for suppressing what is most admirable in the Adventures of your Life  Since it is your Pleasure Madam replied Sir  George  to hear my Adventures I will recount them as well as I am able my self to the end that I may have an Opportunity of obliging you by doing some Violence to my natural Modesty which will not suffer me to relate Things the World have been pleased to speak of to my Advantage without some little Confusion  Then casting down his Eyes he seemed to be recollecting the most material Passages in his Life Mr  Glanville  though he could have  wished he had not indulged  Arabella  in her ridiculous Request was not able to deny himself the Diversion of hearing what Kind of History he would invent and therefore resolved to stay and listen to him  Miss  Glanville  was also highly delighted with the Proposal but Sir  Charles  who could not conceive there could be any thing worth listening to in a young Rake's Account of himself got up with an Intention to walk in the Garden when perceiving it rained he changed his Resolution and resuming his Seat prepared to listen as every one else did to the expected Story  When Sir  George  after having paused a Quarter of an Hour longer during which all the Company observed a profound Silence began his Relation in this Manner addressing himself to  Arabella  End of the Fifth BOOK  THE Female QUIXOTE BOOK VI  CHAP I  Containing the Beginning of Sir George's History in which the ingenious Relater has exactly copied the Stile of Romance  _THOUGH at present Madam you behold me in the Quality of a private Gentleman in the Possession only of a tolerable Estate yet my Birth is illustrious enough My Ancestors having formerly worn a Crownâ–ª which as they won by their Valour so they lost by their Misfortune only  How interrupted Sir  Charles  are you descended from Kings Why I never heard you say so before Pray Sir how far are you removed from Royal Blood and which of your Forefathers was it that wore a Crown  Sir replied Sir  George  it is not much more than Eight hundred Years since my Ancestors who were  Saxons  swayed the Sceptre of  Kent  and from the first Monarch of that mighty Kingdom am I lineally descended  Pray where may that Kingdom of  Kent  lie said Sir  Charles  Inreplied Sir  George  A mighty Kingdom indeed said Sir  Charles  Why it makes but a very small Part of the Kingdom of  Britain  now Well if your Ancestors were Kings of that County as it is now called it must be confessed their Dominions were very small  However that may be said  Arabella  it raises Sir  George  greatly in my Esteem to hear he is descended from Kings for truly a Royal Extraction does infinitely set off noble and valiant Actions and inspires only lofty and generous Sentiments Therefore illustrious Prince for in that Light I shall always consider you be assured though Fortune has despoiled you of your Dominions yet since she cannot deprive you of your Courage and Virtue Providence will one Day assist your noble Endeavours to recover your Rights and place you upon the Throne of your Ancestors from whence you have been so inhumanly driven Or haply to repair that Loss your Valour may procure you  other Kingdoms no less considerable than that to which you was born  For Heaven's sake Niece said Sir  Charles  How come such improbable Things into your Head Is it such an easy Matter think you to conquer Kingdoms that you can flatter a young Man who has neither Fleets nor Armies with such strange Hopes  The great  Artaban  Sir resumed  Arabella  had neither Fleets nor Armies and was Master only of a single Sword yet he soon saw himself greater than any King disposing the Destinies of Monarchs by his Will and deciding the Fates of Empires by a single Word But pray let this Dispute rest where it is and permit Sir  George  to continue his Relation  It is not necessary Madam resumed Sir  George  to acquaint you with the Misfortunes of my Family or relate the several Progressions it made towards the private Condition in which it now is For besides that reciting the Events of so many Hundred Years may haply in some measure try your Patience I should be glad if you would dispense with me from entering into a Detail of Accidents that would sensibly afflict me It shall suffice therefore to inform you that my Father being a peaceable Man fond of Retirement and Tranquillity made no Attempts to recover the Sovereignty from which his Ancestors had been unjustly expelled but quietly beheld the Kingdom of  Kent  in the Possession of other Masters while he contented himself with the Improvement of that small Pittance of Ground which was all  that the unhappy Prince  Veridomer  my Grandfather was able to bequeath to him  Heyday cried Sir  Charles  Will you newchristen your Grandfather when he has been in his Grave these Forty Years I knew honest Sir  Edmard Bellmour  very well though I was but a Youth when he died but I believe no Person in  Kent  ever gave him the Title of Prince  Veridomer  Fie fie these are idle Brags  Sir  George  without taking Notice of the old Baronet's Heat went on with his Narration in this manner  Things were in this State Madam when I was born I will not trouble you with the Relation of what I did in my Infancy  No pray skip over all that interrupted Sir  Charles  I suppose your Infancy was like other Peoples What can there be worth hearing in that  You are deceived Sir said  Arabella  The Infancy of illustrious Personages has always something very extraordinary in it and from their childish Words and Actions there have been often Presages drawn of their future Greatness and Glory  Not to disoblige Sir  Charles  however said the young Prince of  Kent  I will not repeat many things which I said and did in the first Years of my Life that those about me thought very surprising and from them prognosticated that very strange Accidents would befal me  I have been a Witness of some very unfavourable Prognostics of you said Sir  Charles  smiling for you was the most unlucky bold Spark that ever I knew in my Life  'Tis very certain pursued Sir  George  that the Forwardness of my Spirit gave great Uneasiness to my Father who being as I said before inclinable to a peaceable and sedentary Life endeavoured as much as possible to repress that Vivacity in my Disposition which he feared might involve me in dangerous Enterprizes The Pains he took in my Education I recompensed by a more than ordinary Docility and before I was Thirteen performed all my Exercises with a marvelous Grace and if I may dare say so was at those early Years the Admiration and Wonder of all that saw me  Lady  Bella  had some Reason to fear your Modesty I find said Sir  Charles  smiling for methinks you really speak too slightly of your Excellencies  However that may be resumed Sir  George  my Father saw these early Instances of a towering Genius in me with a Pleasure chastened by his Fears that the Grandeur of my Courage would lead me to attempt something for the Recovery of that Kingdom which was my Due and which might haply occasion his losing me  Possessed with these Thoughts he carefully avoided saying any thing to me concerning the glorious Pretences to which my Birth gave me a Right and often wished it had been possible for him to conceal from me that I was the true and lawful Heir of the Kingdom of  Kent  a Circumstance he never chose to mention to  any Person and would have been glad if it had always remained a Secret  And so it was a Secret interrupted Sir  Charles  for till this Day I never heard of it and it might still have been a Secret if you had pleased for nobody I dare say would suspect such a Thing and very few I believe will be inclined to think there is any thing in such an improbable Tale  Notwithstanding all my Father's Endeavours to the contrary Madam pursued Sir  George  I cherished those towering Sentiments the Knowledge of my Birth inspired me with and it was not without the utmost Impatience that I brooked the private Condition to which I found myself reduced  Cruel Fate would I sometimes cry was it not enough to deprive me of that Kingdom which is my Due and subject me to a mean and inglorious State but to make that Condition infinitely more grievous must thou give me a Soul towering above my abject Fortune A Soul that cannot but disdain the base Submission I must pay to those who triumph in the Spoils of my ruined House A Soul which sees nothing above its Hopes and Expectations And in fine a Soul that excites me daily to attempt Things worthy of my Birth and those noble Sentiments I inherit from my great Forefathers Ah pursued I unhappy  Bellmour  what hinders thee from making thyself known and acknowleged for what thou art What hinders thee from boldly asserting thy just and natural Rights and  from defying the Usurper who detains them from thee What hinders thee I say  What Interrupted Sir  Charles  why the Fear of a Halter I suppose There is nothing more easy than to answer that Question  Such Madam said Sir  George  were the Thoughts which continually disturbed my Imagination and doubtless they had not failed to push me on to some hazardous Enterprize had not a fatal Passion interposed and by its sweet but dangerous Allurements stifled for a while that Flame which Ambition and the Love of Glory kindled in my Soul  Sir  George  here pausing and fixing his Eyes with a melancholy Air on the Ground as if prest with a tender Remembrance  Mr  Glanville  asked him similing If the Thoughts of poor  Dolly  disturbed him Pray added he give us the History of your first Love without any Mixture of Fable or shall I take the Trouble off you For you know I am very well acquainted with your Affair with the pretty Milkmaid and can tell it very succinctly  'Tis true Sir said Sir  George  sighing I cannot recall the Idea of  Dorothea  into my Remembrance without some Pain That fair but unfaithful Shepherdess who first taught me to sigh and repaid my Tenderness with the blackest Infidelity Yet I will endeavour to compose myself and go on with my Narration  Be pleased to know then Madam pursued Sir  George  that having my Thoughts in this  manner wholly employed with the Disasters of my Family I had arrived to my seventeenth Year without being sensible of the Power of Love but the Moment now arrived which was to prove fatal to my Liberty Following the Chace one Day with my Father and some other Gentlemen I happened to lag a little behind them and being taken up with my ordinary Reflections I lost my Way and wandered a long time without knowing or considering whither I was going Chance at last conducted me to a pleasant Valley surrounded with Trees and being tired with riding I lighted and tying my Horse to a Tree walked forward with an Intention to repose myself a few Moments under the Shade of one of those Trees that had attracted my Observation But while I was looking for the most convenient Place I spied at the Distance of some few Yards from me a Woman lying asleep upon the Grass Curiosity tempted me to go nearer this Person and advancing softly that I might not disturb her I got near enough to have a View of her Person But ah Heavens what Wonders did my Eyes encounter in this ViewThe Age of this fair Sleeper seemed not to exceed Sixteen her Shape was formed with the exactest Symmetry one of her Hands supported her Head the other as it lay carelesly stretched at her Side gave me an Opportunity of admiring its admirable Colour and Proportion The thin Covering upon her Neck discovered Part of its inimitable Beauty to my Eyes but her Face her lovely Face fixed all my Attention  Certain it is Madam that out of this Company it would be hard to find any thing so perfect as what I now viewed Her Complexion was the purest White imaginable heightened by the inchanting Glow which dyed her fair Cheeks with a Colour like that of a newblown Rose Her Lips formed with the greatest Perfection and of a deeper Red seemed to receive new Beauties from the Fragrance of that Breath that parted from them Her auburn Hair fell in loose Ringlets over her Neck and some straggling Curls that played upon her fair Forehead set off by a charming Contrast the Whitness of that Skin it partly hid Her Eyes indeed were closed and though I knew not whether their Colour and Beauty were equal to those other Miracles in her Face yet their Proportion seemed to be large and the snowy Lids which covered them were admirably set off by those long and fable Lashes that adorned them  For some Moments I gazed upon this lovely Sleeper wholly lost in Wonder and Admiration  Where whispered I where has this Miracle been concealed that my Eyes were never blessed with the Sight of her before These Words though I uttered them softly and with the utmost Caution yet by the murmuring Noise they made caused an Emotion in the beauteous Sleeper that she started and presently after opened her Eyes But what Words shall I find to express the Wonder the Astonishment and Rapture which the Sight of those bright Stars inspired me with The Flames which darted  from those glorious Orbs cast such a dazling Splendor upon a Sight too weak to bear a Radiance so unusual that stepping back a few Paces I contemplated at a Distance that Brightness which began already to kindle a consuming Fire in my Soul  Bless me interrupted Sir  Charles  confounded at so pompous a Description who could this be  The pretty Milkmaid  Dolly Acorn  replied Mr  Glanville  gravely Did you never see her Sir when you was at your Seat at She used often to bring Cream to my Lady  Aye aye replied Sir  Charles  I remember her She was a very pretty Girl And so it was from her Eyes that all those Splendors and Flames came that had like to have burnt you up Sir  George  Well well I guess how the Story will end Pray let us hear it out  I have already told you Madam resumed Sir  George  the marvelous Effects the Sight of those bright Eyes produced upon my Spirit I remained fixed in a Posture of Astonishment and Delight and all the Faculties of my Soul were so absorbed in the Contemplation of the Miracles before me that I believe had she still continued before my Eyes I should never have moved from the Place where I then stood But the fair Virgin who had spied me at the small Distance to which I was retired turned hastily about and flew away with extraordinary Swiftness  When Love now lending me Wings whom Admiration had before made motionless I persued her so eagerly that at last I overtook her  and throwing myself upon my Knees before her  Stay I conjure you cried I and if you be a Divinity as your celestial Beauty makes me believe do not refuse the Adoration I offer you But if as I most ardently wish you are a Mortal though sure the fairest that ever graced the Earth stop a Moment to look upon a Man whose Respects for you as a Mortal fall little short of those Adorations he offers you as a Goddess  I can't but think cried Sir  Charles  laughing how poor  Dolly  must be surprised at such a rhodomontade Speech  Oh Sir replied Mr  Glanville  you will find she will make as good a one  Will she by my Troth said Sir  Charles  I don't know how to believe it  This Action pursued Sir  George  and the Words I uttered a little surprised that fair Maid and brought a Blush into her lovely Cheeks but recovering herself she replied with an admirable Grace  I am no Divinity said she and therefore your Adorations are misplaced But if as you say my Countenance moves you to any Respect for me give me a Proof of it by not endeavouring to hold any further Discourse with me which is not permitted me from one of your Sex and Appearance  A very wise Answer indeed interrupted Sir  Charles  again Very few Town Ladies would have disclaimed the Title of Goddess if their Lovers had thought proper to bestow it  upon them I am mightily pleased with the Girl for her Ingenuity  The Discretion of so young a Damsel resumed Sir  George  charmed me no less than her Beauty and I besought her with the utmost Earnestness to permit me a longer Conversation with her  Fear not lovely Virgin said I to listen to the Vows of a Man who till he saw you never learnt to sigh My Heart which defended its Liberty against the Charms of many admirable Ladies yields without Reluctance to the pleasing Violence your Beauties lay upon me Yes too charming and dangerous Stranger I am no longer my own Master It is in your Power to dispose of my Destiny Consider therefore I beseech you whether you can consent to see me die For I swear to you by the most sacred Oaths unless you promise to have some Compassion on me I will no longer behold the Light of Day  You may easily conceive Madam that considering this lovely Maid in the Character of a Shepherdess in which she appeared I made her a Declaration of my Passion without thinking myself obliged to observe those Respects which to a Person of equal Rank with myself Decorum would not have permitted me to forget  However she repelled my Boldness with so charming a Modesty that I began to believe she might be a Person of illustrious Birth disguised under the mean Habit she wore But having requested her to inform me who she was she told me her Name was  Dorothea  and that  she was Daughter to a Farmer that lived in the neighbouring Valley This Knowlege increasing my Confidence I talked to her of my Passion without being the least afraid of offending her  And therein you was greatly to blame said  Arabella  For truly though the fair  Dorothea  told you she was Daughter to a Farmer yet in all Probability she was of a much higher Extraction if the Picture you have drawn of her be true  The fair  Arsinoe  Princess of  Armenia  was constrained for a while to conceal her true Name and Quality and pass for a simple Countrywoman under the Name of  Delia  Yet the generous  Philadelph  Prince of  Cilicia  who saw and loved her under that Disguise treated her with all the Respect he would have done had he known she was the Daughter of a King In like manner Prince  Philoxipes  who fell in Love with the beautiful  Policrete  before he knew she was the Daughter of the great  Solon  and while he looked upon her as a poor Stranger born of mean Parents nevertheless his Love supplying the Want of those Advantages of Birth and Fortune he wooed her with a Passion as full of Awe and Delicacy as if her Extraction had been equal to his own And therefore those admirable Qualities the fair  Dorothea  possessed might also have convinced you she was not what she seemed but haply some great Princess in Disguise  To tell you the Truth Madam replied Sir  George  notwithstanding the fair  Dorothea  informed me she was of a mean Descent I could  not easily forego the Opinion that she was of an illustrious Birth And the Histories of those fair Princesses you have mentioned coming into my Mind I also thought it very possible that this divine Person might either be the Daughter of a great King or Lawgiver like them but being wholly engrossed by the Violence of my newborn Affection I listened to nothing but what most flattered my Hopes and addressing my lovely Shepherdess with all the Freedom of a Person who thinks his Birth much superior to hers she listened to my Protestations without any seeming Reluctance and condescended to assure me before we parted that she did not hate me So fair a Beginning seemed to promise me the most favourable Fortune I could with Reason expect I parted from my fair Shepherdess with a thousand Vows of Fidelity exacting a Promise from her that she would meet me as often as she conveniently could and have the Goodness to listen to those Assurances of inviolable Tenderness my Passion prompted me to offer her When she left me it seemed as if my Soul had forsaken my Body to go after her My Eyes pursued her Steps as long as she was in Sight I envied the Ground she prest as she went along and the Breezes that kissed that celestial Countenance in their Flight  For some Hours I stood in the same Posture in which she had left me contemplating the sudden Change I had experienced in my Heart and the Beauty of that divine Image which was now engraven in it Night drawing on I began to think of going home and untying my  Horse I returned the Way I had come and at last struck into a Road which brought me to the Place where I parted from the Company from whence I easily found my Way home so changed both in my Looks and Carriage that my Father and all my Friends observed the Alteration with some Surprize  CHAP II  In which Sir George continuing his surprising History relates a most stupendous Instance of a Valour only to be parallelled by that of the great Oroondates Caesareo c c c  FOR some Months continued Sir  George  I prosecuted my Addresses to the admirable  Dorothea  and I flattered myself with a Hope that I had made some Progress in her Heart But alas this deceitful Fairone who only laughed at the Torments she made me endure at the time she vowed eternal Constancy to me gave her Hand to a Lover of her Father's providing and abandoned me without Remorse to the most cruel Despair  I will not trouble you Madam with the Repetition of those Complaints which this perfidious Action drew from me for a long time At length my Courage enabling me to overcome the Violence of my Grief I resolved to think of the ungrateful  Dorothea  no more and  the Sight of another Beauty completing my Cure I no longer remembred the unfaithful Shepherdess but with Indifference  Thus Madam have I faithfully related one of those Infidelities wherewith my Enemies slander me who can support their Assertion with no better Proof than that I did not die when  Dorothea  abandoned me But I submit it to your Candour whether an unfaithful Mistress deserved such an Instance of Affection from a Lover she had betrayed  Why really replied  Arabella  after a little Pause you had some Excuse to plead for your Failure in this Point And though you cannot be called the most perfect amongst Lovers seeing you neither died nor was in Danger of dying yet neither ought you to be ranked among those who are most culpable But pray proceed in your Story I shall be better able to form a right Judgment of your Merit as a Lover when I have heard all your Adventures  My Passion for  Dorothea  resumed Sir  George  being cured by her Treachery towards me the Love of Glory began again to revive in my Soul I panted after some Occasion to signalize my Valour which yet I had met with no Opportunity of doing but hearing that a mighty Army was preparing to march upon a secret Expedition I privately quitted my Father's Seat and attended only by my faithful 'Squire I took the same Route the Army had taken and arrived the Day before the terrible Battle ofwas fought where without making myself known I performed such Prodigies of Valour as astonished all who beheld  me Without doubt I should have been highly caressed by the Commander who certainly would have given me the Honour of a Victory my Sword alone had procured for him but having unwittingly engaged myself too far in Pursuit of the flying Enemy I found myself alone encompassed with a Party of about Five hundred Men who seeing they were pursued only by a single Man faced about and prepared to kill or take me Prisoner  Pray Sir interrupted Sir  Charles  when did all this happen And how came it to pass that your Friends have been ignorant to this Moment of those Prodigies of Valour you performed at that Battle I never heard you was ever in a Battle Fame has done you great Injustice by concealing the Part you had in that famous Victory  The great Care I took to conceal myself replied Sir  George  was one Reason why my Friends did not attribute to me the Exploits which the Knight in black Armour who was no other than myself performed and the Accident I am going to relate prevented my being discovered while the Memory of those great Exploits were yet fresh in the Minds of those I had so greatly obliged  Be pleased to know therefore Madam that seeing myself about to be encompassed by this Party of the Enemy I disdained to fly and though I was alone resolved to sustain their Attack and sell my Life as dear as possible  Why if you did so you was a Madman cried Sir  Charles  in a Heat The bravest Man that ever lived would not have presumed to  fight with so great a Number of Enemies What could you expect but to be cut in Pieces Pooh pooh don't think any body will credit such a ridiculous Tale I never knew you was so addicted to  Lying perhaps the good Knight would have said but Sir  George  who was concerned he was present at his Legend and could not blame him for doubting his Veracity prevented his Utterance of a Word he would be obliged to take ill by abruptly going on with his Story  Placing my Back therefore against a Tree pursued he to prevent my being assaulted behind I presented my Shield to the Boldest of these Assailants who having struck an impotent Blow upon it as he was lifting up his Arm to renew his Attack I cut it off with one Stroke of my Sword and the same Instant plunged it to the Hilt in the Breast of another and clove the Scull of a Third who was making at me in two Parts  Sir  Charles  at this Relation burst into a loud Fit of Laughter and being more inclined to divert himself than be offended at the Folly and Vanity of the young Baronet he permitted him to go on with his surprising Story without giving him any other Interruption  These Three Executions Madam pursued Sir  George  were the Effects only of so many Blows which raised such Indignation in my Enemies that they prest forward in great Numbers to destroy me but having as I before said posted myself so advantageously that I could only be assaulted before not more than  Three or Four could attack me at one time The Desire of lengthening out my Life till happily some Succour might come to my Relief so invigorated my Arm and added to my ordinary Strength an almost irresistible Force that I dealt Death at every Blow and in less than a quarter of an Hour saw more than Fifty of my Enemies at my Feet whose Bodies served for a Bulwark against their Fellows Swords  The Commander of this little Body not having Generosity enough to be moved with those prodigious Effects of my Valour in my Favour was transported with Rage at my Resistance and the Sight of so many of his Men slain before his Face served only to increase his Fury and that Moment seeing that with Two more Blows I had sent Two of his most valiant Soldiers to the Shades and that the rest fearing to come within the Length of my Sword had given me a few Moments Respite  Ah Cowards cried he are you afraid of a single Man And will you suffer  him  to escape from your Vengeance who has slain so many of your brave Comrades before your Eyes  These Words inspiring them with a Fierceness such as he desired they advanced towards me with more Fury than before By this time I had received several large Wounds and my Blood ran down from many Parts of my Body Yet was I not sensible of any Decay of Strength nor did the settled Designs of my Enemies to destroy me daunt me in the least I still relied upon the Assistance I expected Providence  would send to my Relief and determined if possible to preserve my Life till it arrived  I fought therefore with a Resolution which astonished my Enemies but did not move them to any Regard for my Safety And observing their brutal Commander a few Paces from me encouraging his Men both with his Cries and Gestures Indignation against this inhuman Wretch so transported me out of my Discretion that I quitted my Post in order to sacrifice him to my Revenge  Seeing me advance furiously towards him he turned pale with Fear and endeavoured to shelter himself in the midst of his Men who more valiant than himself opposed themselves to my Rage to favour his Retreat But quickly clearing myself a Way with my Sword I pressed towards the barbarous Coward and ere he could avoid the Blow I aimed at him it struck him senseless at my Feet  My particular Revenge thus satisfied I was sensible of the Fault I had committed in quitting my Post by which I exposed myself to be surrounded by the Enemy I endeavoured to regain it but in vain I was beset on all Sides and now despaired of any Safety and therefore only fought to die courageously and make as many of my Enemies as I could attend my Fall  Exasperated by the Misfortune of their Commander they pressed upon me with redoubled Fury Faint as I was with the Loss of Blood and so fatigued with the past Action and the obstinate Fight I had maintained so long with such a considerable Number I could hardly any  longer lift up my Arm and to complete my Misfortune having thrust my Sword into the Body of one of the forwardest of my Enemies in my endeavouring to regain it it broke in Pieces and the Hilt only remained in my Hand  This Accident completed my Defeat Deprived of my Sword I was no longer capable of making any Defence Several of them pressed upon me at once and throwing me down tied my Hands together behind me Shame and Rage at this Indignity worked so forcibly upon my Spirts weakened as I then was that I fell into a Swoon What happened till my Recovery I am not able to tell but at the Return of my Senses I found myself laid on a Bed in a tolerable Chamber and some Persons with me who kept a profound Silence  CHAP III  A LoveAdventure after the Romantic Taste  RECOLLECTING in a few Moments all that happened to me I could not choose but be surprised at finding myself treated with so little Severity considering I was Prisoner to Persons who had been Witnesses of the great Quantity of Blood I had shed in my own Defence My Wounds had been dressed while I continued in my Swoon and the Faces of those Persons who were about me expressed nothing of Unkindness  After reflecting some time longer on my Situation I called to a young Man who sat near my Bedside and intreated him to inform me Where I was and to whom I was a Prisoner But could get no other Answer to those Questions than a most civil Intreaty to compose myself and not protract the Cure of my Wounds by talking which the Surgeons had declared would be of a bad Consequence and had therefore ordered me to be as little disturbed as possible  Notwithstanding this Remonstrance I repeated my Request promising to be entirely governed by them for the future in what regarded my Health provided they would satisfy me in those Particulars But my Attendant did not so much as reply to those Importunities but to prevent the Continuance of them rose from his Seat and retired to the other End of the Chamber  I passed that Day and several others without being able to learn the Truth of my Condition All this time I was diligently waited on by the two Persons I had first seen neither of whom I could prevail upon to inform me of what I desired to know and judging by this obstinate Reserve and the Manner of my Treatment that there was some Mystery in the Case I forbore to ask them any more Questions conceiving they had particular Orders not to answer them  The Care that was taken to forward my Cure in Three Weeks entirely restored me to Health I longed impatiently to know what was to be my Destiny and busied myself  in conjecturing it in vain when one Morning an elderly Lady entered my Chamber at whose Appearance my Two Attendants retired  After she had saluted me very civilly and inquired after my Health she seated herself in a Chair near my Bedside and spoke to me in this manner  I make no question Sir but you are surprised at the Manner in which you have been treated and the Care there has been taken to prevent discovering to you the Place where you now are but you will doubtless be more surprised to hear you are in the Fortress of and in the House of Prince  Marcomire  whose Party you fought against alone and whom you so dangerously wounded before you was taken Prisoner by his Men  Is it possible Madam said I who from the first Moment of her Appearance had been in a strange Perplexity is it possible I am in the House of a Man whose Life I endeavoured so eagerly to destroy And is it to him who oppressed me so basely with Numbers that I am obliged for the Succour I have received  It is not to him replied the Lady that you are obliged for the favourable Treatment you have had but listen to me patiently and I will disclose the Truth of your Adventure  Prince  Marcomire  who was the Person that headed that Party against which you so valiantly defended yourself after the Loss of the Battle was hastening to throw himself into this Place where his Sister and many Ladies of Quality had come for Security Your indiscreet  Pursuit engaged you in the most unequal Combat that ever was fought and  Nay Sir interrupted  Arabella  though I do not refuse to give you all the Praises your gallant Defence of yourself against Five hundred Men deserves yet I cannot agree with that Lady in saying it was the most unequal Combat that ever was fought For do but reflect I beseech you upon that which the brave Prince of  Mauritania  sustained against twice that Number of Men with no other Arms than his Sword and you having been in Battle that Day was as I conceive completely armed The young Prince of  Egypt  accompanied only by the valiant but indiscreet  Cepio  his Friend engaged all the King of  Armenia  's Guards and put them all to Flight The courageous  Ariobasanes  scorned to turn his Back upon a whole Army not to mention the invincible  Artaban  whom a thousand Armies together could not have made to turn  Be pleased to observe Madam said Sir  George  that to the end I may faithfully recount my History I am under a Necessity of repeating Things which haply may seem too advantageous for a Man to say of himself Therefore I indeed greatly approve of the Custom which no doubt this Inconveniency introduced of a 'Squire who is thoroughly instructed with the Secrets of his Master's Heart relating his Adventures and giving a proper Eulogium of his rare Valour without being in Danger of offending the Modesty of the renowned Knight who as you know Madam upon those Occasions commodiously slips away  It being however this Lady's Opinion that no Man ever undertook a more hazardous Combat or with greater Odds against him she did not fail to express her Admiration of it in very high Terms  The Noise of this Accident pursued she was soon spread over the whole Town and the beautiful  Sydimiris Marcomire  's Sister hearing that her Brother was wounded as it was thought to Death and that the Person who killed him was taken Prisoner she flew out to meet her wounded Brother distracted with Grief and vowing to have the severest Tortures executed on him who had thus barbarously murdered her Brother Those who bore that unhappy Prince having brought him into the House his Wounds were searched and the Surgeons declared they were very dangerous  Sydimiris  hearing this redoubled her Complaints and Vows of Vengeance against you Her Brother having then the chief Authority in the Place she commanded in his Name to have you brought hither and to be most strictly guarded determined if her Brother died to sacrifice you to his Ghost  Full of these sanguinary Resolutions she left his Chamber having seen him laid in Bed and his Wounds dressed but passing along a Gallery to her own Apartment she met the Persons who were bringing you to the Room that was to be your Prison You was not pursued the Lady yet recovered from your Swoon so that they carried you like one that was dead They had taken off your Helmet to give you  Air by which means your Face being quite uncovered pale languishing and your Eyes closed as if in Death presented the most moving and at the same time most pleasing Object in the World  Sydimiris  who stopt and for a Moment eagerly gazed upon you lost all of a sudden the Fierceness which before had animated her against you And lifting up her Eyes to view those Men that carried you  Are you sure said she to them that this is the Person who wounded my Brother  Yes Madam replied one of them this must be he since there was no other in his Company and he alone sustained the Attack of Five hundred Men and would probably not have left one of them alive had not his Sword by breaking put it into our Power to take him Prisoner  Carry him away said  Sydimiris  but let his Wounds be dressed and let him be carefully looked to that if my Brother dies he may be punished as he deserves  Pronouncing these Words in a low and faltering Voice she turned her Eyes a second time upon you then hastily averting her Looks she hurried to her own Chamber and threw herself into a Chair with all the Marks of a very great Disturbance  The Affection I have for her being the Person who had brought her up and most favoured with her Confidence made me behold her in this Condition with great Concern and supposing it was her Brother that disquieted her I besought her not to give way to the Violence  of her Grief but to hope that Heaven would restore him to her Prayers  Alas my dear  Urinoe  said she I am more culpable than you can imagine and I grieve less for the Condition to which I see  Marcomire  reduced than for that Moderation wherewith I am constrained spite of myself to behold his Enemy  Yes dear  Urinoe  pursued she blushing and casting down her Eyes the Actions of this Unknown appear to me in quite another Light since I have seen him and instead of looking upon him as the Murderer of my Brother I cannot help admiring that rare Valour with which he defended himself against so great a Number of Enemies and am even ready to condemn the furious  Marcomire  for oppressing so brave a Man  As I had never approved of those violent Transports of Grief and Rage which she had expressed upon the first News of her Brother's Misfortune and as I looked upon your glorious Defence with the utmost Admiration so far from condemning the Change of her Thoughts I confirmed her in the favourable Opinion she began to entertain of you and continuing to make Remarks upon all the Particulars of the Combat which had come to our Knowlege we found nothing in your Behaviour but what increased our Admiration  Sydimiris  therefore following the Dictates of her own Generosity as well as my Advice placed Two Persons about you whose Fidelity we could rely on and gave them Orders to treat you with all imaginable Care and Respect  but not to inform you of the Place in which you was or to whom you was Prisoner  In the mean time  Marcomire  whose Wounds had been again examined was declared out of Danger by the Surgeons and he having understood the Excess of his Sister's Grief and the Revenge she had vowed against you gave her Thanks for those Expressions of her Tenderness and also uttered some Threats which intimated a violent Hatred against you and a Design of prosecuting his Revenge upon you as soon as he was in a Condition to leave his Chamber  Sydimiris  who heard him could with Difficulty dissemble her Concern  Ah  Urinoe  said she to me when we were alone 'tis now that I more than ever repent of that Excess of Rage which transported me against the brave Unknown I have thereby put him intirely into my Brother's Power and shall be haply accessary to that Death he is meditating for him or else a perpetual Imprisonment  This Reflection gave her so much Pain that I could not choose but pity her and considering that the only way to preserve you was for her to dissemble a Rage equal to  Marcomire  's against you in order to prevent being suspected of any Design in your Favour I persuaded her to join with him in every thing he said while in the mean time we would endeavour to get you cured of your Wounds that you might at least be in a Condition once more  to defend yourself with that miraculous Valour Heaven has bestowed on you  Sydimiris  perceiving her Brother would soon be in a Condition to execute his Threats resolved to hazard every thing rather than to expose you to his Rage She therefore communicated to me her Design of giving you Liberty and by presenting a sufficient Reward to your Guard inducing them to favour your Escape  I undertook to manage this Business in her Name and have done it so effectually that you will this Night be at Liberty and may depart the Town immediately in which it will be dangerous to stay any time for fear of being discovered  Sydimiris  forbad me to let you know the Person to whom you would be obliged for your Freedom but I could not endure that you should unjustly involve the Sister of  Marcomire  in that Resentment you will questionless always preserve against  him  and to keep you from being innocently guilty of Ingratitude I resolved to acquaint you with the Nature of those Obligations you owe to her  CHAP IV  The Adventure continued  AH Madam said I perceiving she had finished her Discourse doubt not but I shall most gratefully preserve the Remembrance of what the generous  Sydimiris  has done for me  and shall always be ready to lose that Life in her Defence which she has had the superlative Goodness to take so much Care of But Madam pursued I with an earnest Look do not I beseech you refuse me one Favour without which I shall depart with inconceivable Sorrow  Depend upon it valiant Sir replied she that if what you will require of me be in my Power and fit for me to grant I shall very willingly oblige you  It is then resumed I trembling at the Boldness of my Request that you would condescend to intreat the most generous  Sydimiris  to favour me with an Interview and give me an Opportunity of throwing myself at her Feet to thank her for all those Favours I have received from her Compassion  I cannot promise you replied the Lady rising to prevail upon  Sydimiris  to grant you an Audience but I assure you that I will endeavour to dispose her to do you this Favour and it shall not be my Fault if you are not satisfied  Saying this she went out of my Chamber I having followed her to the Door with Protestations that I would never forget her Kindness upon this Occasion  I past the rest of that Day in an anxious Impatience for Night divided between Fear and Hope and more taken up with the Thoughts of seeing  Sydimiris  than with my expected Liberty  Night came at last and the Door of my Apartment opening I saw the Lady who had been with me in the Morning enter  I have prevailed upon  Sydimiris  to see you said she and she is willing at my Intreaty to grant that Favour to a Person who she with Reason thinks has been inhumanly treated by her Brother  Then giving me her Hand she conducted me along a large Gallery to a stately Apartment and after traversing several Rooms she led me into one where  Sydimiris  herself was Who as soon as she perceived me rose from her Seat and received me with great Civility  In the Transport I then was I know not how I returned the grateful Salute the incomparable  Sydimiris  gave me for most certain it is that I was so lost in Wonder at the Sight of the many Charms I beheld in her Person that I could not unlock my Tongue or remove my Eyes from her inchanting Face but remained fixed in a Posture which at once expressed my Admiration and Delight  To give you a Description of that Beauty which I then contemplated I must inform you Madam that  Sydimiris  is tall of a handsome Stature and admirably proportioned her Hair was of the finest Black in the World her Complexion marvelously fair and all the Lineaments of her Visage were perfectly beautiful and her Eyes which were large and black sparkled with so quick and piercing a Fire that no Heart was able to resist their powerful Glances Moreover  Sydimiris  is admirably shaped her Port is high and noble and her Air so free yet so commanding that there are few Persons in the World with whom she may not dispute the Priority of Beauty In fine  Madam  Sydimiris  appeared with so many Advantages to a Spirit prepossessed already with the most grateful Sense of her Favours that I could not resist the sweet Violence wherewith her Charms took Possession of my Heart I yielded therefore without Reluctance to my Destiny and resigned myself in an Instant to those Fetters which the Sight of the Divine  Sydimiris  prepared for me Recovering therefore a little from that Admiration which had so totally ingrossed all my Faculties I threw myself at her Feet with an Action wholly composed of Transport  Divine  Sydimiris  said I beholding her with Eyes in which the Letters of my newborn Passion might very plainly be read see at your Feet a Man devoted to your Service by all the Ties of Gratitude and Respect I come Madam to declare to you that from the First Moment you gave me Liberty I had devoted that and my Life to you and at your Feet I confirm the Gift protesting by all that is most dear and sacred to me that since I hold my Life from the Divine  Sydimiris  she alone shall have the absolute Disposal of it for the future and shuld she please again to demand it either to appease her Brother's Fury or to sacrifice it to her own Security I will most faithfully perform her Will and shed the last Drop of that Blood at her Command which I would with Transport lose in her Defence  A fine highflown Speech indeed said Sir  Charles  laughing but I hope you did not intend to keep your Word  Sure Sir replied  Arabella  you do not imagine that Sir  George  would have failed in executing all he had promised to the beautiful and generous  Sydimiris  What could he possibly have said less And indeed what less could she have expected from a Man whom at the Hazard of her own Life and Happiness she had given Freedom to  I accompanied these Words Madam pursued Sir  George  with so passionate a Look and Accent that the fair  Sydimiris  blushed and for a Moment cast down her Eyes with a visible Confusion At last  Sir replied she I am too well satisfied with what I have done with respect to your Safety to require any Proofs of your Gratitude that might be dangerous to it and shall remain extremely well satisfied if the Obligations you think you owe me may induce you to moderate your Resentment against my Brother for the cruel Treatment you received from him  Doubt not Madam interrupted I eagerly but I shall in the Person of  Marcomire  regard the Brother of the divine  Sydimiris  and that Consideration will be sufficient not only to make me forget all the Violences he committed against me but even to desend his Life if need be with the Hazard of my own  Excessively generous indeed said Sir  Charles  I never heard any thing like it  Oh dear Sir replied  Arabella  there are numberless Instances of equal and even superior Generosity to be met with in the L  ves of the Heroes of Antiquity You will there see a Lover whose Mistress has been taken from  him either by Treachery or Force venture his Life in Defence of the injurious Husband who possesses her and though all his Felicity depends upon his Death yet he will rescue him from it at the Expence of the greater Part of his Blood  Another who after a long and bloody War has by taking his Enemy Prisoner an Opportunity of terminating it honourably yet thro' an heroick Principle of Generosity he gives his Captive Liberty without making any Conditions and has all his Work to do over again  A Third having contracted a violent Friendship with the Enemies of his Country through the same generous Sentiments draws his Sword in their Defence and makes no Scruple to fight against an Army where the King his Father is in Person  I must confess said Sir  Charles  that Generosity seems to me very peculiar that will make a Man fight for his Enemies against his own Father  It is in that Peculiarity Sir said  Arabella  that his Generosity consists for certainly there is nothing extraordinary in fighting for one's Father and one's Country but when a Man has arrived to such a Pitch of Greatness of Soul as to neglect those mean and selfish Considerations and loving Virtue in the Persons of his Enemies can prefer their Glory before his own particular Interest he is then a perfect Hero indeed Such a one was  Oroondates Artaxcrxes  and many others I could name who all gave eminent Proofs of their Disinterestedness and Greatness of Soul upon the like Occasions  Therefore not to detract from Sir  George  's Merit I must still insist that in the Resolutions he had taken to defend his Enemy's Life at the Expence of his own he did no more than what any Man of ordinary Generosity ought to do and what he was particularly obliged to by what the amiable  Sydimiris  had done for him  I was so happy however Madam continued Sir  George  to find that those Expressions of my Gratitude wrought somewhat upon the Heart of the lovely  Sydimiris  in my Favour Her Words discovered as much and her Eyes spoke yet more intelligibly but our Conversation was interrupted by the discreet  Urinoe  who fearing the Consequence of so long a Stay in her Chamber represented to me that it was time to take my Leave  I turned pale at this cruel Sound and beholding  Sydimiris  with a languishing Look  Would to Heaven Madam said I that instead of giving me Liberty you would keep me eternally your Prisoner for though a Dungeon was to be the Place of my Confinement yet if it was near you it would seem a Palace to me for indeed I am no longer in a Condition to relish that Freedom you bestow upon me since it must remove me farther from you But I beseech you Madam to believe that in delivering me from your Brother's Fetters you have cast me into your own and that I am more a Prisoner than ever but a Prisoner to so lovely a Conqueror that I do not wish to break my Chains and prefer the sweet and glorious Captivity  I am in to all the Crowns in the World  You are very bold said  Sydimiris  blushing to entertain me with such Discourse yet I pardon this Offence in Consideration of what you have suffered from my Brother and on Condition that you will depart immediately without speaking another Word  Sydimiris  spoke this so earnestly that I durst not disobey her and kissing the Hem of her Robe with a passionate Air I left ber Chamber conducted by  Urinoe  who having brought me to a private Door which carried us into the Street I there found a Man waiting for me whom I knew to be the same that had attended me during my Stay in that House  Urinoe  having recommended to him to see me safe out of the Town I took Leave of her with the most grateful Acknowlegements for her Kindness and followed my Conductor so oppressed with Grief at the Thoughts of leaving the Place where  Sydimiris  was that I had hardly Strength to walk  CHAP V  An extraordinary Instance of Generosity in a Lover somewhat resembling that of the great Artaxerxes in Cassandra  THE farther I went continued Sir  George  the more my Regret increased and finding it would be impossible to live and quit  the Divine  Sydimiris  I all at once took a Resolution to remain in the Town concealed and communicating my Design to my Guide I engaged him to assist me in it by a Present of a considerable Sum which he could not resist Accordingly he left me in a remote Part of the Town and went to find out a convenient Lodging for me which he soon procured and also a Suit of Cloaths to disguise me my own being very rich and magnificent  Having recommended me as a Relation of his who was newly arrived I was received very civilly by the People with whom he placed me and finding this young Man to be very witty and discreet and also very capable of serving me I communicated to him my Intentions by staying which were only to be near the Divine  Sydimiris  and to have the Happiness of sometimes seeing her when she went abroad  This Man entering into my Meaning assured me he would faithfully keep my Secret and that he would not fail to bring me Intelligence of all that passed in the Palace of  Marcomire  I could with Difficulty keep myself from falling at his Feet to express my Sense of his kind and generous Offers but I contented myself with presenting him another Sum of Money larger than the first and assured him of my future Gratitude  He then took Leave and left me to my Reflections which were wholly upon the Image of the Divine  Sydimiris  and the Happiness of being so near the Object I adored  My Confident came to me the next Day but brought me no other News than that my Escape was not yet known to  Marcomire  I inquired if he had seen  Sydimiris  but he replied he had not and that  Urinoe  had only asked him if he had conducted me safe out of Town To which he had answered as we had agreed that I had got out safe and undiscovered  A Day or two after he brought me News more pleasing for he told me that  Sydimiris  had sent for him into her Chamber and asked him several Questions concerning me That she appeared very melancholy and even blushed whenever she mentioned my Name  This Account gave sufficient Matter for my Thoughts to work upon for several Days I interpreted  Sydimiris  's Blush a Thousand different Ways I reflected upon all the different Causes to which it might be owing and busied myself with all those innumerable Conjectures which as you know Madam such an Incident always gives Rise to in a Lover's Imagination At length I explained it to my own Advantage and felt thereby a considerable Increase of my Affection  A whole Week having elapsed without another Sight of my Confidant I began to be greatly alarmed when on the Eighth Day of this cruel Suspense I saw him appear but with so many Marks of Disturbance in his Face that I trembled to hear what he had to acquaint me with  Oh Sir said he as soon as his Concern suffered him to speak  Marcomire  has discovered  your Escape and the Means by which it was procured One of those in whom  Urinoe  confided has betrayed it to him and the beauteous  Sydimiris  is likely to feel the most terrible Effects of his Displeasure He has confined her to her Chamber and vows to sacrifice her Life to the Honour of his Family which he says she has stained and he loads that admirable Lady with so many Reproaches that it is thought her Grief for such undeserved Calumnies will occasion her Death  Scarce had he finished these cruel Words when I who all the time he had been speaking beheld him with a dying Eye sunk down at his Feet in a Swoon which continued so long that he began to think me quite dead However I at last opened my Eyes but it was only to pour forth a River of Tears and to utter Complaints which might have moved the most obdurate Heart  After having a long time tormented myself in weeping and complaining I at last took a Resolution which afforded me some Alleviation of my Grief and the faithful  Toxares  seeing me a little composed left me to myself with a Promise to return soon and acquaint me with what passed further in the Palace of  Marcomire  As soon as he was gone I rose from my Bed and dressing myself in those Cloaths I wore when I was taken Prisoner I went to the Palace of  Marcomire  and demanding to see him I was told he was in the Apartment of  Sydimiris  and at my earnest Desire they conducted me thither  When I entered the Room I beheld that incomparable Beauty stretched upon a Couch dissolved in Tears and  Urinoe  upon her Knees before her accompanying with her own those precious Drops which fell from the bright Eyes of her Mistress  Marcomire  who was walking furiously about the Room exclaiming with the utmost Violence against that fair Sufferer did not observe my Entrance so that I had an Opportunity of going towards  Sydimiris  who lifting up her Eyes to look upon me gave a loud Shriek and by a Look of extreme Anguish let me understand how great her Apprehensions were upon my Account  I am come Madam said I to perform Part of the Promise I made you and by dying to prove your Innocence and freeing you from the Reproaches you suffer on my Account I shall have the Happiness to convince you that my Life is infinitely less dear to me than your Tranquillity  Sydimiris  who hearkened to me with great Emotion was going to make some Answer when  Marcomire  alarmed by his Sister's Shriek came towards us and viewing me at first with Astonishment and then with a Smile of Cruelty and Revenge  Is it possible said he that I behold my designed Murderer again in my Power  I am in thy Power said I because I am willing to be so and came voluntarily to put myself into your Hands to free that excellent Lady from the Imputation you have laid on her Know  Marcomire  that it is to myself alone I owed my Liberty which I would still preserve  against all the Forces thou couldst bring to deprive me of it and this Sword which left thee Life enough to threaten mine would haply once more put yours in Danger were I not restrained by a powerful Consideration which leaves me not the Liberty of even wishing you ill  Ah Dissembler said  Marcomire  in a Rage think not to impose upon me by thy counterfeited Mildness Thou art my Prisoner once more and I shall take care to prevent your escaping a Second time  I am not your Prisoner replied I while I possess this Sword which has already defended me against greater Numbers than you have here to oppose me but continued I throwing down my Sword at  Sydimiris  's Feet I resign my Liberty to restore that Lady to your good Opinion and to free her from those base Aspersions thou hast unjustly loaded her with upon my Account  It matters not said the brutal Brother taking up my Sword whether thou hast resigned or I have deprived thee of Liberty but since thou art in my Power thou shall feel all the Effects of my Resentment Take him away pursued he to some of his People put him into the worst Dungeon you can find and let him be guarded carefully upon Pain of Death if he again escapes  With these Words several Men offered to lead me out of the Room but I repulsed them with Disdain and making a low Reverence to  Sydimiris  whose Countenance expressed the Extremes of Fear and Anguish I followed my  Conductors to the Prison allotted for me which hideous as it was I contemplated with a secret Pleasure since I had by that Action which had brought me into it given a Testimony of my Love for the adorable  Sydimiris  CHAP VI  In which it will be seen that the Lady is as generous as her Lover  I Passed some Days in this Confinement melancholy enough My Ignorance of the Destiny of  Sydimiris  gave me more Pain than the Sense of my own Misfortunes and one Evening when I was more then usually disquieted one of my Guard entered my Prison and giving me a Letter retired without speaking a Word I opened this Letter with Precipitation and by the Light of a Lamp which was allowed me I read the following Words  Sydimiris  To the most generous  Bellmour  IT is not enough to tell you that the Method you took to free me from my Brother's Severity has filled me with the utmost Esteem and Admiration So generous an Action merits a greater Acknowlegement and I will make no Scruple to confess that my Heart is most sensibly touched by it Yes  Bellmour  I have received this glorious Testimony of your Affection with such a Gratitude as you yourself could have wished to inspire me with and it  shall not be long before you will have a convincing Proof of the Effect it has had upon the Spirit of  Sydimiris  This Letter Madam pursued Sir  George  being wholly calculated to make me hope that I was not hated by the Divine  Sydimiris  and that she meditated something in my Favour I resigned myself up to the most delightful Expectations  What cried I transported with the Excess of my Joy Does the most admirable  Sydimiris  condescend to assure me that I have touched her Heart And does she promise me that I shall receive some convincing Proof of her Acknowlegement  Ah too happy and too fortunate  Bellmour  to what a glorious Destiny hast thou been reserved And how oughtest thou to adore these Fetters that have procured thee the Esteem of the Divine  Sydimiris    Such Madam were the Apprehensions which the Billet I had received inspired me with I continually flattered myself with the most pleasing Hopes and during Three Weeks longer in which I heard no more from  Sydimiris  my Imagination was wholly filled with those sweet Thoughts which her Letter had made me entertain  At length on the Evening of a Day which I had wholly spent in reading over  Sydimiris  's Letter and interpreting the Sense of it a thousand different Ways but all agreeable to my ardent Wishes I saw the sage  Urinoe  enter my  Prison accompanied by  Toxares  whom I had not seen during my last Confinement Wholly transported at the Sight of these Two Friends and not doubting but they had brought me the most agreeable News I ran towards them and throwing my self at  Urinoe  's Feet I begged her in an Ecstacy of Joy to acquaint me with  Sydimiris  's Commands  Urinoe  in some Confusion at this Action intreated me to rise 'Tis fit cried I in a Transport I could not master that in this Posture I should receive the Knowlege of that Felicity  Sydimiris  has had the Goodness to promise me  Urinoe  sighed at these Words and beholding me with a Look of Compassion and Tenderness  Would to God said she that all I have to say were as agreeable as the first News I have to tell you which is that you are free and at Liberty to leave the Town this Moment  Sydimiris  continued she has bought your Freedom at the Expence of her own and to deliver you from her Brother's Chains she has put on others haply more cruel than those you have worn In fine she has married a Man whom she detested to procure your Liberty her Brother having granted it to her upon that Condition alone  Scarce had  Urinoe  finished these Words when I fell without Sense or Motion at her Feet  Toxares  and she who had foreseen what might happen having provided themselves with Cordials necessary to restore me brought me to myself with infinite Trouble  Cruel said I to them with a Tone and Look which witnessed the Excess of my Despair Why have you hindered me from dying at once to prevent the thousand Deaths I shall suffer from my Grief Is this the Confirmation of those glorious Hopes  Sydimiris  had permitted me to entertain Is this that Proof of the Acknowlegements I was to expect And is it by throwing herself into the Arms of my Rival that she repays those Obligations she thinks she owes me  Ah inhuman  Sydimiris  was it to make my Despair more poignant that thou flatterest me with such a Prospect of Happiness And was it necessary to the Grandeur of thy Nuptials that my Life should be the Sacrifice  But how unjust am I cried I repenting in an Instant of those injurious Suspicions How unjust am I to accuse the Divine  Sydimiris  of Inhumanity Was it not to give me Freedom that she bestowed herself upon a Man she hates And has she not made herself miserable for ever to procure me a fansied Happiness  Ah if it be so what a Wretch am I I who have been the only Cause of that Misery to which she has doomed herself Ah Liberty pursued I how I detest thee since purchased by the Misfortune of  Sydimiris  And how far more sweet and glorious were those Chains which I wore for her sake  My Sighs and Tears leaving me no longer the Power of Speech I sunk down on my Bed oppress'd with a mortal Grief  Urinoe  and  Toxares  drew near to comfort me  and said all that sensible and discreet Persons could think of to alleviate my Despair  Though I have heard that  Sydimiris  is married replied I without dying immediately yet do not imagine that I will suffer this odious Life to continue long If Sorrow do not quickly dispatch me I will seek Death by other Means for since  Sydimiris  is lost I have no more Business in the World  The charitable  Urinoe  and  Toxares  endeavoured in vain to divert me from this sad Resolution when  Urinoe  finding all their Reasonings ineffectual drew a Letter out of her Pocket and presenting it to me I had Orders said she not to let this Letter be delivered to you till you had left the Town but the Despair to which I see you reduced does I conceive dispense with my rigorous Observation of those Directions  While  Urinoe  was speaking I opened this Letter trembling and found it as follows  CHAP VII  Containing an Incident full as probable as any in Scudery's Romances  Sydimiris  To  Bellmour  IF that Proof of my Gratitude which I promised to give you fall short of your Expectations blame not the Defect of my Will but the Rigour of my Destiny It was by this  only Way I could give you Liberty nor is it too dearly bought by the Loss of all my Happiness if you receive it as you ought Had I been allowed to follow my own Inclinations there is no Man in the World I would have preferred to yourself I owe this Confession to the Remembrance of your Affection of which you gave me so generous an Instance and the Use I expect you will make of it is to console you under a Misfortune which is common to us both though I haply have most Reason to complain since I could not be just to you without being cruel at the same time or confer a Benefit without loading you with a Misfortune If the Sacrifice I have made of myself for your sake gives me any Claim to the Continuance of your Love I command you by the Power it gives me over you to live and not add to the Miseries of my Condition the Grief of being the Cause of your Death Remember I will look upon your Disobedience as an Act of the most cruel Ingratitude and your Compliance with this Request shall ever be esteemed as the dearest Mark you can give of that Passion you have borne to the unfortunate  Sydimiris  Ah  Sydimiris  cried I having read this Letter more cruel in your Kindness than Severity After having deprived me of yourself do you forbid me to die and expose me by so rigorous a Command to Ills infinitely more hard and painful than Death  Yes pursued I after a little Pause yes  Sydimiris  thou shalt be obeyed we will not dye since thou hast commanded us to live and notwithstanding the Tortures to which thou condemnest us we will obey this Command and give thee a glorious Proof of our present Submission by enduring that Life which the Loss of thee has rendered truly wretched  Urinoe  and  Toxares  somewhat reassured by the Resolution I had taken exhorted me by all the Persuasions Friendship could put in their Mouths to persevere in it and  Urinoe  bidding me Farewel I endeavoured to prevail upon her to procure me a Sight of  Sydimiris  once more or at least to bear a Letter from me to her but she refused both these Requests so obstinately telling me  Sydimiris  would neither consent to the one nor the other that I was obliged to be contented with the Promise she made me to represent my Affliction in a true Light to her Mistress and to assure her that nothing but her absolute Commands could have hindered me from dying Then taking leave of me with much Tenderness she went out of tbe Prison leaving  Toxares  with me who assisted me to dress and conducted me out of that miserable Place where I had passed so many sad and also joyful Hours At a Gate to which he brought me I found a Horse waiting and having embraced this faithful Confidant with many Expressions of Gratitude I bestowed a Ring of some Value upon him to remember me by and mounting my Horse with a breaking Heart I took the first Road which presented itself to my Eyes and galloped away without knowing whither I went I rode the whole  Night so totally engrossed by my Despair that I did not perceive my Horse was so tired it could hardly carry me a Step farther At last the poor Beast fell down under me so that I was obliged to dismount and looking about me perceived I was in a Forest without seeing the least Appearance of any Habitation  The Wilderness and Solitude of the Place flattered my Despair and while my Horse was feeding upon what Grass he could find I wandered about The Morning just breaking gave me Light enough to direct my Steps Chance at last conducted me to a Cave which seemed to have been the Residence of some Hermit or unfortunate Lover like myself It was dug at the Side of a Rock the Entrance to it thick set with Bushes which hid it from View I descended by a few Steps cut rudely enough and was convinced it had formerly served for a Habitation for some religious or melancholy Person for there were Seats of Turf raised on each Side of it a kind of Bed composed of dried Leaves and Rushes and a Hole made artificially at the Top to admit the Light  While I considered this Place attentively I all at once took up a Resolution inspired by my Despair which was to continue there and indulge my Melancholy in a Retirement so fitted for my Purpose  Giving my Horse therefore Liberty to go where he pleased and hanging up my Arms upon a Tree near my Cave I took Possession of this solitary Mansion with a gloomy Kind of Satisfaction and devoted all my Hours to the Contemplation of my Misfortunes  I lived in this manner Madam for Ten Months without feeling the least Desire to change my Habitation and during all that time no Mortal approached my Solitude so that I lived perfectly secure and undiscovered  Sir  George  pausing here to take Breath the old Baronet said what will be found in the following Chapter  CHAP VIII  A single Combat fought with prodigious Valour and described with amazing Accuracy  GIVE me Leave Sir said Sir  Charles  to ask If you eat in all this Time  Alas Sir replied Sir  George  Sighs and Tears were all my Sustenance  Sir  Charles  Mr  Glanville  and Miss laughing at this Answer  Arabella  seemed greatly confused  It is not to be imagined said she that Sir  George  or to say better Prince  Viridmore  lived Ten Months without eating any thing to support Nature but such trifling Circumstances are always left out in the Relations of Histories and truly an Audience must be very dull and unapprehensive that cannot conceive without being told that a Man must necessarily eat in the Space of Ten Months  But the Food Sir  George  lived on replied the Baronet was very unsubstantial and would not afford him much Nourishment  I suppose resumed  Arabella  he lived upon such Provisions as the Forest afforded him such as wild Fruits Herbs bitter Sallads and the like which considering the Melancholy that possessed him would appear a voluptuous Repast and which the unfortunate  Orontes  when he was in the same Situation thought infinitely too good for him  Sir  Charles  finding  Arabella  took no Notice of the Historian's Hyperbole of living upon his Sighs and Tears passed it over for fear of offending her and Sir  George  who had been in some Anxiety how to bring himself off when he perceived  Arabella  was reasonable enough to suppose he must have eat during his Abode in the Forest went on with his Relation in this Manner  I lived as I before observed to you Madam in this Cave for Ten Months and truly I was so reconciled to that solitary way of Life and found so much Sweetness in it that I believe I should have remained there till this Day but for the Adventure which I am going to recount  It being my Custom to walk out every Evening in the Forest returning to my Cave something later then usual I heard the Cries of a Woman at some Distance who seemed to be in Distress I stopped to listen from what Side those Cries proceeded and perceiving they seemed to approach nearer to me I took down my Armour from the Tree where I had hung it and hastily arming myself shaped my Course towards the Place from whence those  Complaints seemed to come resolving to assist that unknown Person with all the Strength that was left me  Having gone some Paces I spied through the Branches of the Trees a Man on Horseback with a Lady who struggled to get loose and at times calling aloud for Succour  This Sight inflaming me with Rage against that impious Ravisher I flew towards him And when I came within hearing  Hold Wretch cried I and cease to offer Violence to that Lady whom thou bearest away by Force or prepare to defend thyself against one who will die before he will suffer thee to prosecute thy unjust Designs  The Man without answering me clapped Spurs to his Horse and it would have been impossible to have overtaken him had not my own Horse which had never quitted the Forest appeared in my View I quickly mounted him and followed the Track the Ravisher had taken with such Speed that I came up with him in a Moment  Caitiff said I release the Lady and defend thyself These Words which I accompanied with a thundering Blow upon his Headpiece obliged him to set down the Lady who implored Heaven with the utmost Ardour to grant me the Victory And recoiling back a few Paces to take a View of me  I know not said he for what Reason thou settest thyself to oppose my Designs but I well know that thou shalt dearly repent of thy Temerity  Saying this he advanced furiously towards  me and aimed so heavy a Blow at my Head that had I not received it on my Shield I might haply have no longer been in a Condition to defend the distressed Lady But having with the greatest Dexterity imaginable avoided this Blow I made at him with so much Fierceness and directed my Aims so well that in a few Moments I wounded him in several Places and his Arms were all dyed with his Blood  This good Success redoubled my Vigour and having by a lucky Stroke with my Sword cut the Strings of his Headpiece it fell off And his Head being bare I was going to let fall a dreadful Blow upon it which doubtles  would have shivered it in a thousand Pieces when he cried out for Quarter and letting fall his Sword by that Action assured me my Victory was intire  Live Wretch cried I since thou art base enough to value Life after being vanquished but swear upon my Sword that thou wilt never more attempt the Liberty of that Lady  While I was speaking I perceived he was no longer able to sit his Horse But staggering a Moment he fell off and lay extended without Motion upon the Ground Touched with Compassion at this Sight I alighted and supposing him to be in a Swoon was preparing to give him some Assistance but upon my nearer Approach I found he was quite dead  Leaving therefore this mournful Object I I turned about with an Intention to go and offer the distressed Lady my further Help but I perceived her already at my Feet  Valiant Knight said she with a Tone of Voice so bewitching that all my Faculties were suspended as by Inchantment suffer me on my Knees to thank you for the Deliverance you have procured me from that base Man since to your admirable Valour I owe not only the Preservation of my Life but what is infinitely dearer to me my Honour  The Astonishment wherewith I beheld the miraculous Beauty that appeared before me kept me a Moment in such an attentive Gaze that I forgot she was at my Feet Recollecting myself however with some Confusion at my Neglect  Oh rise Madam cried I helping her up with infinite Respect and debase not such Perfection to a Posture in which all the Monarchs on the Earth might glory to appear before it  That you may the better conceive the Alteration which the Sight of this fair Unknown produced in my Soul I will endeavour to give you a Description of her Beauty which was altogether miraculous  CHAP IX  In which the Reader will find a Description of a Beauty in a Style truly sublime  THE newfallen Snow pursued Sir  George  was tanned in Comparison of the refined Purity of that White which made up the  Ground of her Complexion and though Fear had a little gathered the Carnations of her Cheeks yet her Joy at being delivered seemed to plant them there with such fresh Advantages that my Eye might shrink at the Brightness of that mingled Lustre Her Mouth as well for Shape as Colour might shame the Imitation of the best Pencils and the liveliest Tints and though through some petty Intervals of Joy it wanted the Smiles which Grief and Terror sequestred yet she never opened it but like the East at the Birth of a beautiful Day and then discovered Treasures whose excelling Whiteness made the Price inestimable All the Features of her Face had so near a Kindred to Proportion and Symmetry as the several Masters of  Apelles  's Art might have called it his Glory to have copied Beauties from her as the best of Models The Circumference of her Visage shewed the Extremes of an imperfect Circle and almost formed it to a perfect Oval And this Abridgment of Marvels was tapered by a Pair of the brightest Stars that ever were lighted up by the Hand of Nature As their Colour was the same with the Heavens there was a spherical Harmony in their Motion and that mingled with a Vivacity so penetrating as neither the firmest Eye nor the strongest Soul could arm themselves with a Resistance of Proof against those pointed Glories Her Head was crowned with a prodigious Quantity of fair long Hair which Colour as fitly suited the Beauty of her Eyes as Imagination could make it To these Marvels of Face were joined the rest of her Neck  Hands and Shape and there seemed a Contest between the Form and Whiteness of the two former which had the largest Commission from Nature to work Wonders  In fine her Beauty was miraculous and could not fail of producing a sudden Effect upon a Heart like mine  Having passed in an Instant from the extremest Admiration to something yet more tender I reiterated my Offers of Service to the fair Unknown who told me she feared her Father had Occasion for some Assistance her Ravisher having left his Men to engage him and keep off his Pursuit while he rode off with his Prize Hereupon I begg'd her to direct me to the Place where she left her Father assuring her I would gladly venture my Life a Second time to preserve his and she desiring to go with me I placed her before me on my Horse and had the exquisite Pleasure of supporting with my Arms the fairest and most admirable Creature in the World  In less than half an Hour which had appeared to me but a Moment we got to the Place where she had been torn from her Father whom we beheld with three of his Servants maintaining a Fight against twice as many of their Enemies  Having gently set down the beauteous Unknown upon the Grass I flew to the Relief of her Father and throwing myself furiously amongst his Assailants dispatched two of them with so many Blows The others seeing so unexpected an Assistance gave back a little and  I took Advantage of their Consternation to redouble my Blows and brought Two more of them at my Feet  There remained now but Four to overcome and my Arrival having given new Vigour to those whose Part I had taken they seconded me so well that we soon had nothing more left to do for the rest seeing their Comrades slain sought their Safety in Flight We were too generous to pursue them the Blood of such Wretches being unworthy to be shed by our Swords  The fair Unknown seeing us Conquerors flew to embrace her Father who holding her pressed between his Arms turned his Eyes upon me then quitting her came towards me and in the most obliging Terms imaginable returned me Thanks for the Assistance I had brought him and being informed by his Daughter of what I had done for her Preservation this old Gentleman renewed his Acknowlegements calling me the Preserver of his Life the valiant Defender of his Daughter's Honour his tutelary Angel and the Guardian of his House  In fine he loaded me with so many Thanks and Praises that I could not choose but be in some Confusion and to put an End to them I begged he would inform me by what means he came into that Misfortune  He told me that residing in a Castle at the Extremity of this Forest the Charms of his Daughter had captivated a neighbouring Lord whose Character and Person being disagreeable  both to her and himself he had absolutely refused to give her to him Thereupon he had set upon them as they were going to visit a Relation at some Distance and dragging  Philonice  out of the Coach put her before him on his Horse and carried her away leaving Eight of his Men to engage him and his Servants who being but Four in Number must inevitably have perished had I not come to his Relief and by my miraculous Valour vanquished all his Enemies  Saying this he desired me to go home with him to the Castle and having led his Daughter to the Coach insisted upon my placing myself next her and getting in himself ordered them to return home  This Accident having altered his Design of making the Visit which had been the Occasion of his Journey  The Baron for that I found was his Title entertained me all the Way with repeated Expressions of Acknowledgements and Tenderness and the incomparable  Philonice  condescended also to assure me of her Gratitude for the Service I had done her  At our Arrival at the Castle I perceived it was very large and magnificent The Baron conducted me to one of the best Apartments and would stay in the Room till my Armour was taken off that he might be assured I had received no Hurts Having rendered him the like Civility in his own Chamber and satisfied myself he was not wounded we returned to the beautiful  Philonice  and this second Sight  having finished my Defeat I remained so absolutely her Slave that neither  Dorothea  nor  Sydimiris  were more passionately beloved  At the earnest Intreaty of the Baron I staid some Weeks in the Castle during which the daily Sight of  Philonice  so augmented my Flames that I was no longer in a Condition to conceal them but fearing to displease that Divine Beauty by a Confession of my Passion I languished in secret and the Constraint I laid upon myself gave me such Torments that I fell into a profound Melancholy and looked so pale and dejected that the Baron was sensible of the Alteration and conjured me in the most pressing Terms to acquaint him with the Cause of my Uneasiness But though I continued obstinately silent with my Tongue yet my Eyes spoke intelligibly enough and the Blushes which appeared in the fair Cheeks of  Philonice  whenever she spoke to me on the Subject of my Grief convinced me she was not ignorant of my Passion  At length the Agitation of my Mind throwing me into a Fever the Baron who was firmly persuaded that my Illness proceeded from some concealed Vexation pressed me continually to declare myself and finding all his Intreaties ineffectual he commanded his Daughter to endeavour to find out the Cause of that Grief which had put me into such a Condition  For that Purpose therefore having brought the fair  Philonice  into my Chamber he staid a few Minutes and leaving the Room under Pretence of Business  Philonice  remained alone  by my Bedside her Women out of Respect staying at the other End of the Chamber  This Divine Person seeing herself alone with me and remembring her Father's Command blushed and cast down her Eyes in such apparent Confusion that I could not help observing it And interpreting it to the Displeasure she took in being so near me  Whatever Joy I take in the Honour your Visit does me Madam said I in a weak Voice yet since nothing is so dear to me as your Satisfaction I would rather dispense with this Mark of your Goodness to an unfortunate Wretch then see you in the least Constraint  And why replied she with a Tone full of Sweetness do you suppose that I am here by Constraint when it would be more just to believe that in visiting the valiant Defender of my Honour and the Life of my Father I only follow my own Inclinations  Ah Madam said I transported with Joy at so favourable a Speech the little Service I had the Happiness to do you does not merit so infinite a Favour and tho' I had lost the best Part of my Blood in your Defence I should have been well rewarded with your Safety  Since you do not repent of what you have done replied she I am willing to be obliged to you for another Favour and ask it with the greater Hope of obtaining it as I must acquaint you it is by my Father's Command I take that Liberty who is much interested in my Success  There is no Occasion Madam returned I to make use of any Interest but your own to engage me to obey you since that is and ever will be allpowerful with me Speak then Madam and let me know what it is you desire of me that I may once in my Life have the Glory of obeying you  It is said she blushing still more than before that you will acquaint us with the Cause of that Melancholy which has as we imagine occasioned your present Illness  At these Words I trembled turned pale and not daring to discover the true Cause of my Affliction I remained in a profound Silence  I see said the beautiful  Philonice  that you have no Inclination to obey me and since my Request has as I perceive given you some Disturbance I will prevail upon my Father to press you no farther upon this Subject  No Madam said I eagerly the Baron shall be satisfied and you shall be obeyed though after the Knowlege of my Crime you doom me to that Death I so justly merit  Yes Madam this unfortunate Man who has had the Glory to acquire your Esteem by the little Service he did you has cancelled the Merit of that Service by daring to adore you  I love you divine  Philonice  and not being able either to repent or cease to be guilty of loving you I am resolved to die and spare you the Trouble of pronouncing my Sentence I beseech you therefore to believe that I would have died in Silence but for your Command to declare myself and you should never have  known the Excess of my Love and Despair had not my Obedience to your Will obliged me to confess it  I finished these Words with so much Fear and Confusion that I durst not lift my Eyes up to the fair Face of  Philonice  to observe how she received this Discourse I waited therefore trembling for her Answer but finding that in several Minutes she spoke not a Word I ventured at last to cast a languishing Glance upon the Visage I adored and saw so many Marks of Disorder upon it that I was almost dead with the Apprehensions of having offended her beyond even the Hope of procuring her Pardon by my Death  CHAP X  Wherein Sir George concludes his History which produces an unexpected Effect  THE Silence of  Philonice  continued Sir  George  pierced me to the Heart and when I saw her rise from her Seat and prepare to go away without speaking Grief took such Possession of my Spirits that uttering a Cry I fell into a Swoon which as I afterwards was informed greatly alarmed the beautiful  Philonice  who resuming her Seat had the Goodness to assist her Women in bringing me to myself and when I opened my Eyes I had  the Satisfaction to behold her still by me and all the Signs of Compassion in her Face  This Sight a little reassuring me I ask your Pardon Madam said I for the Condition in which I have appeared before you and also for that I am not yet dead as is doubtless your Wish But I will make Haste pursued I sighing to fulfil your Desires and you shall soon be freed from the Sight of a miserable Wretch who to his last Moment will not cease to adore you  It is not your Death that I desire said the fair  Philonice  and after having preserved both my Father and me from Death it is not reasonable that we should suffer you to die if we can help it  Live therefore  Bellmour  pursued she blushing and live if possible without continuing in that Weakness I cannot choose but condemn Yet whatever are your Thoughts for the future remember that your Death will be a Fault I cannot resolve to pardon  Speaking these Words without giving me time to answer she left my Chamber and I found something so sweet and favourable in them that I resolved to obey her and forward my Cure as much as I was able However the Agitation of Spirits increased my Fever so much that my Life was despaired of  The Baron hardly ever left my Bedside  Philonice  came every Day to see me and seemed extremely moved at the Danger I was in One Day when I was worse than usual she came  close to the Bedside and opening the Courtain  What  Bellmour  said she do you pay so little Obedience to my Commands that you resolve to die  Heaven is my Witness Madam said I faintly that nothing is so dear and sacred to me as your Commands and since out of your superlative Goodness you are pleased to have some Care for my Life I would preserve it to obey you were it in my Power but alas Madam I strive in vain to repel the Violence of my Distemper  In a few Days more I was reduced to the last Extremity It was then that the fair  Philonice  discovered that she did not hate me for she made no Scruple to weep before me and those Tears she so liberally shed had so powerful an Effect upon my Mind that the Contentment I felt communicated itself to my Body and gave such a Turn to my Distemper that my Recovery was not only hoped but expected  The Baron expressed his Satisfaction at this Alteration by the most affectionate Expressions and though the fair  Philonice  said very little yet I perceived by the Joy that appeared in her fair Eyes that she was not less interested in my Recovery than her Father  The Physicians having declared me out of Danger the Baron who had taken his Resolutions long before came one Day into my Chamber and ordering those who attended me to leave us alone  Prince said he for in recounting my History to him I had disclosed my true Quality I am not ignorant of that Affection you bear my Daughter and am sensible it has occasioned the Extremity to which we have seen you reduced Had you been pleased to acquaint me with your Sentiments you would have avoided those Displeasures you have suffered for though your Birth were not so illustrious as it is yet preferring Virtue to all other Advantages I should have esteemed my Daughter honoured by your Love and have freely bestowed her on you But since to those rare Qualities wherewith Heaven has so liberally endowed you you add also that of a Birth so noble doubt not but I shall think myself highly favoured by your Alliance If therefore your Thoughts of my Daughter be not changed and you esteem her worthy to be your Bride I here solemnly promise you to bestow her upon you as soon as you are perfectly recovered  I leave you to guess Madam the Joy which I felt at this Discourse It was so great that it would not permit me to thank him as I should have done for the inestimable Blessing he bestowed on me  I saw  Philonice  a few Minutes after and being commanded by her Father to give me her Hand she did so without any Marks of Reluctance and having respectfully kissed it I vowed to be her Slave for ever  Who would have imagined continued Sir  George  with a profound Sigh that Fortune while she thus seemed to flatter me was preparing to make me suffer the severest Torments  I began now to leave my Bed and was able to walk about my Chamber The Baron was making great Preparations for our Nuptials when one Night I was alarmed with the Cries of  Philonice  's Women and a few Moments after the Baron came into my Chamber with a distracted Air  O Son cried he for so he always called me now  Philonice  is lost both to you and me She is carried off by Force and I am preparing to follow and rescue her if possible but I fear my Endeavours will be fruitless since I know not which Way her Ravishers have taken  Oh Sir cried I transported both with Grief and Rage you shall not go alone Her Rescue belongs to me and I will effect it or perish in the Attempt  The Baron having earnestly conjured me not to expose myself to the Danger of a Relapse by so imprudent a Resolution was obliged to quit me Word being brought him that his Horse was ready And as soon as he was gone out of the Room in spite of all that could be said to prevent me by my Attendants I made them put on my Armour and mounting a Horse I had caused to be made ready fallied furiously out of the Castle breathing out Vows of Vengeance against the Wretch who had robbed me of  Philonice  I rode the whole Night without stopping Day appeared when I found myself near a small Village I entered it and made strict Enquiry after the Ravisher of  Philonice  describing the fair Creature and offering vast Rewards to any who could bring me the least Intelligence  of her But all was in vain I could make no Discovery  After travelling several Days to no Purpose I returned to the Castle in order to know if the Baron had been more successful in his Pursuit then myself but I found him oppressed with Grief He had heard no Tidings of his Daughter and had suffered no small Apprehensions upon my Account Having assured him I found myself very able to travel I took an affectionate Leave of him promising him never to give over my Search till I had found the Divine  Philonice  But Heaven has not permitted me that Happiness and though I have spent several Years in searching for her I have never been able to discover where she is Time has not cured me of my Grief for her Loss and though by an Effect of my Destiny another Object possesses my Soul yet I do not cease to deplore her Misfortune and to offer up Vows for her Happiness  And is this all you have to say said  Arabella  whom the latter Part of his History had extremely surprised or are we to expect a Continuance of your Adventures  I have faithfully related all my Adventures that are worthy your Hearing Madam returned Sir  George  and I flatter myself you will do me the Justice to own that I have been rather unfortunate than faithless and that Mr  Glanville  had little Reason to tax me with Inconstancy  In my Opinion resumed  Arabella  Mr  Glanville  spoke too favourably of you when he called you only inconstant and if he had added  the Epithet of Ungrateful and Unjust he would have marked your Character better  For in fine Sir pursued she you will never persuade any reasonable Person that your being able to lose the Remembrance of the fair and generous  Sydimiris  in your new Passion for  Philonice  was not an Excess of Levity But your suffering so tamely the Loss of this last Beauty and allowing her to remain in the Hands of her Ravisher while you permit another Affection to take Possession of your Soul is such an Outrage to all Truth and Constancy that you deserve to be ranked among the falsest of Mankind  Alas Madam replied Sir  George  who had not foreseen the Influence  Arabella  would draw from this last Adventure What would you have an unfortunate Man whose Hopes have been so often and so cruelly disappointed do I have bewailed the Loss of  Philonice  with a Deluge of Tears I have taken infinite Pains to find her but to no Purpose and when Heaven compassionating my Sufferings presented to my Eyes an Object to whom the whole World ought to pay Adoration how could I resist that powerful Impulse which forced me to love what appeared so worthy of my Affection  Call not interrupted  Arabella  that an irresistible Impulse which was only the Effect of thy own changing Humour The same Excuse might be pleaded for all the Faults we see committed in the World and Men would no longer be answerable for their own Crimes Had you imitated the illustrious Heroes of Antiquity as well in the Constancy of their Affections  as it must be confessed you have done in their admirable Valour you would now be either sighing in your Cave for the Loss of the generous  Sydimiris  or wandering through the World in Search of the beautiful  Philonice  Had you persevered in your Affection and continued your Pursuit of that Fairone you would perhaps ere this have found her sleeping under the Shade of a Tree in some lone Forest as  Philodaspes  did his admirable  Delia  or disguised in a Slave's Habit as  Ariobarsanes  saw his Divine  Olympia  or bound haply in a Chariot and have had the Glory of freeing her as  Ambriomer  did the beauteous  Agione  or in a Ship in the Hands of Pirates like the incomparable  Eliza  or  Enough dear Niece interrupted Sir  Charles  you have quoted Examples sufficient if this inconstant Man would have the Grace to follow them  True Sir replied  Arabella  and I would recommend to his Consideration the Conduct of those illustrious Persons I have named to the end that pursuing their Steps he may arrive at their Glory and Happiness that is the Reputation of being perfectly constant and the Possession of his Mistress And be assured Sir pursued  Arabella  looking at Sir  George  that Heaven will never restore you the Crown of your Ancestors and place you upon the Throne to which you pretend while you make yourself unworthy of its Protection by so shameful an Inconstancy  I perhaps speak with too much Freedom to a great Prince whom though Fortune has despoiled  of his Dominions is intitled to a certain Degree of Respect But I conceive it belongs to me in a particular manner to resent the Baseness of that Crime to which you are pleased to make me the Excuse and looking upon myself as dishonoured by those often prostituted Vows you have offered me I am to tell you that I am highly disobliged and forbid you to appear in my Presence again till you have resumed those Thoughts which are worthy your noble Extraction and are capable of treating me with that Respect that is my Due  Saying this she rose from he Seat and walked very majestically out of the Room leaving Sir  George  overwhelmed with Shame and Vexation at having conducted the latter Part of his Narration so ill and drawn upon himself a Sentence which deprived him of all his Hopes  CHAP XI  Containing only a few Inferences drawn from the foregoing Chapters  MR  Glanville  excessively delighted with this Event could not help laughing at the unfortunate Baronet who seemed by his Silence and downcast Looks to expect it  Who would have imagined said he that so renowned a Hero would have tarnished the Glory of his Laurels as my Cousin says by so base an Ingratitude Indeed Prince pursued he laughing you must resolve to recover your  Reputation either by retiring again to your Cave and living upon bitter Herbs for the generous  Sydimiris  or else wander through the World in search of the Divine  Philonice  Don't triumph dear  Charles  replied Sir  George  laughing in his Turn have a little Compassion upon me and confess that nothing could be more unfortunate than that damn'd Slip I made at the latter End of my History But for that my Reputation for Courage and Constancy had been as high as the great  Oroondates  or  Juba  Since you have so fertile an Invention said Sir  Charles  you may easily repair this Mistake Odsheart It is pity you are not poor enough to be an Author you would occupy a Garret in  Grubstreet  with great Fame to yourself and Diversion to the Public  Oh Sir cried Sir  George  I have Stock enough by me to set up for an Author Tomorrow if I please I have no less than Five Tragedies some quite others almost finished Three or Four Essays on  Virtue Happiness  c Three thousand Lines of an Epic Poem half a Dozen Epitaphs a few Acrostics and a long String of Puns that would serve to embellish a Daily Paper if I was disposed to write one  Nay then interrupted Mr  Glanville  you are qualified for a Critic at the  Bedford  Coffeehouse where with the rest of your Brothers Demywits you may sit in Judgment upon the Productions of a  Young  a  R  or a  Johnson  Rail with premeditated Malice at the  Rambler  and for the want of Faults turn even its inimitable Beauties into Ridicule The  Language because it reaches to Perfection may be called stiff laboured and pedantic the Criticisms when they let in more Light than your weak Judgment can bear superficial and ostentatious Glitter and because those Papers contain the finest System of Ethics yet extant damn the queer Fellow for overpropping Virtue an excellent new Phrase which those who can find no Meaning in may accommodate with one of their own then give shrewd Hints that some Persons though they do not publish their Performances may have more Merit than those that do  Upon my Soul  Charles  said Sir  George  thou art such an illnatured Fellow that I am afraid thou wilt be sneering at me when I am gone and wilt endeavour to persuade Lady  Bella  that not a Syllable of my Story is true Speak pursued he Wilt thou have the Cruelty to deprive me of my lawful Claim to the great Kingdom of  Kent  and rob me of the Glory of fighting singly against Five hundred Men  I do not know said Sir  Charles  whether my Niece be really imposed upon by the Gravity with which you told your surprising History but I protest I thought you were in earnest at first and that you meant to make us believe it all to be Fact  You are so fitly punished said Mr  Glanville  for that illjudged Adventure you related last by the bad Opinion Lady  Bella  entertains of you that I need not add to your Misfortune And therefore you shall be Prince  Veridomer  if you please since under that Character you  are obliged not to pretend to any Lady but the incomparable  Philonice  Sir  George  who understood his Meaning went home to think of some Means by which he might draw himself out of the Embarrassment he was in and Mr  Glanville  as he had promised did not endeavour to undeceive Lady  Bella  with regard to the History he had feigned being very well satisfied with his having put it out of his Power to make his Addresses to her since she now looked upon him as the Lover of  Philonice  As for Sir  Charles  he did not penetrate into the Meaning of Sir  George  's Story and only imagined that by relating such a Heap of Adventures he had a Design to entertain the Company and give a Proof of the Felicity of his Invention and Miss  Glanville  who supposed he had been ridiculing her Cousin's strange Notions was better pleased with him than ever  Arabella  however was less satisfied than any of them She could not endure to see so brave a Knight who drew his Birth from a Race of Kings tarnish the Glory of his gallant Actions by so base a Perfidy  Alas said she to herself How much Reason has the beautiful  Philonice  to accuse me for all the Anguish she suffers since I am the Cause that the ungrateful Prince on whom she bestows her Affections suffers her to remain quietly in the Hands of her Ravisher without endeavouring to rescue her But Oh too lovely and unfortunate Fairone said she as if she had been present and listening to her  distinguish I beseech you between those Faults which the Will and those which Necessity makes us commit I am the Cause 'tis true of thy Lover's Infidelity but I am the innocent Cause and would repair the Evils my fatal Beauty gives Rise to by any Sacrifice in my Power to make  While  Arabella  by her romantic Generosity bewails the imaginary Afflictions of the full as imaginary  Philonice  Mr  Glanville  who thought the Solitude she lived in confirmed her in her absurd and ridiculous Notions desired his Father to press her to go to  London  Sir  Charles  complied with his Request and earnestly intreated her to leave the Castle and spend a few Months in Town Her Year of Mourning being now expired she consented to go but Sir  Charles  who did not think his Son's Health absolutely confirmed proposed to spend a few Weeks at  Bath  which was readily complied with by  Arabella  The End of BOOK  VI  THE Female QUIXOTE BOOK VII  CHAP I  For the Shortness of which the Length of the next shall make some Amends  _SIR  George  to gratify  Arabella  's Humour had not presumed to come to the Castle for several Days but hearing that they were preparing to leave the Country he wrote a short Billet to her and in the Style of Romance most humbly intreated her to grant him a Moment's Audience  Arabella  being informed by  Lucy  to whom Sir  George  's Gentleman had addressed himself that he had brought a Letter from his Master she  ordered her to bring him to her Apartment and as soon as he appeared  How comes it said she that the Prince your Master has had the Presumption to importune me again after my absolute Commands to the contrary  The Prince my Master Madam said the Man excessively surprised  Ay said  Arabella  Are you not Sir  George  's 'Squire And does he not trust you with his most secret Thoughts  I belong to Sir  George Bellmour  Madam replied the Man who did not understand what She meant I have not the Honour to be a 'Squire  No interrupted  Arabella  'tis strange then that he should have honoured you with his Commission Pray what is it you come to request for him  My Master Madam said he ordered me to get this Letter delivered to your Ladyship and to stay for your Commands  You would persuade me said she sternly being provoked that he did not deliver the Letter upon his Knees as was the Custom in Romances that you are not acquainted with the Purport of this audacious Billet since you express so little Fear of my Displeasure but know presumptuous that I am mortally offended with your Master for his daring to suppose I would read this Proof at once of his Insolence and Infidelity and was you worth my Resentment I would haply make you suffer for your Want of Respect to me  The poor Man surprised and confounded at  her Anger and puzzled extremely to understand what she meant was opening his Mouth to say something 'tis probable in his own Defence when  Arabella  preventing him  I know what thou wouldst say said she Thou wouldst abuse my Patience by a false Detail of thy Master's Sighs Tears Exclamations and Despair  Indeed Madam I don't intend to say any such Thing replied the Man  No repeated  Arabella  a little disappointed Bear back his presumptuous Billet which I suppose contains the melancholy Account and tell him He that could so soon forget the generous  Sydimiris  for  Philonice  and could afterwards be false to that incomparable Beauty is not a Person worthy to adore  Arabella  The Man who could not tell what to make of this Message and feared he should forget these two hard Names humbly intreated her to be pleased to acquaint his Master by a Line with her Intentions  Arabella  supposing he meant to importune her still more made a Sign with her Hand very majestically for him to be gone but he not able to comprehend her Meaning stood still with an Air of Perplexity not daring to beg her to explain herself supposing she by that Sign required something of him  Why dost thou not obey my Commands said  Arabella  finding he did not go  I will to be sure Madam replied he wishing at the same time secretly she would let him know what they were  And yet said she hastily thou art disobeying  me this Moment Did I not bid you get out of my Presence and to speak no more of your inconstant Master whose Crimes have rendered him the Detestation of all generous Persons whatever  Sir  George  's Messenger extremely surprised at so harsh a Character of his Master and the Rage with which the Lady seemed to be actuated made haste to get out of her Apartment and at his Return informed his Master very exactly of the Reception he had met with repeating all Lady  Bella  's Words which notwithstanding the Blunders he made in the Names of  Sydimiris  and  Philonice  Sir  George  understood well enough and found new Occasion of wondering at the Excess of  Arabella  's Extravagance who he never imagined would have explained herself in that Manner to his Servant  Without endeavouring therefore to see  Arabella  he went to pay his Compliments to Sir  Charles  Mr  Glanville  and Miss  Glanville  to the last of which he said some soft things that them her extremely regret his staying behind made in the Country  CHAP II  Not so long as was first intended but contains however a surprising Adventure on the Road  THE Day of their Departure being come they set out in a Coach and Six attended by several Servants on Horseback The First  Day's Journey passed off without any Accident worthy relating but towards the Close of the Second they were alarmed by the Appearance of three Highwaymen well mounted at a small Distance  One of the Servants who had first spied them immediately rode up to the Coach and for fear of alarming the Ladies whispered Mr  Glanville  in the Ear  Sir  Charles  who was sitting next his Son and had heard it cried out with too little Caution How's this Are we in any Danger of being attacked say you  Mr  Glanville  without replying jumped out of the Coach at which Miss  Glanville  screamed out and lest her Father should follow whipped into her Brother's Sear and held him fast by the Coat  Arabella  being in a strange Consternation at all this put her Head out of the Coach to see what was the Matter and observing Three or Four Men of a genteel Appearance on Horseback who seemed to halt and gaze on themâ–ª without offering to advance  Sir said she to her Uncle are they yonder Knights whom you suppose will attack us  Ay ay said Sir  Charles  they are Knights of the Road indeed I suppose we shall have a Bout with them for it will be scandalous to deliver since we have the Odds of our Side and are more than a Match for them  Arabella  interpreting these Words in her own Way looked out again and seeing the Robbers who had by this time taken their Resolution galloping towards them her Cousin  and the Servants ranging themselves of each Side of the Coach as if to defend them  Hold hold valiant Men said she as loud as she could speak addressing herself to the Highwaymen do not by a mistaken Generosity hazard your Lives in a Combat to which the Laws of Honour do not oblige you We are not violently carried away as you falsly suppose we go willingly along with these Persons who are our Friends and Relations  Heyday cried Sir  Charles  starting at her with great Surprize what's the Meaning of all this Do you think these Fellows will mind your fine Speeches Niece  I hope they will Sir said she Then pulling her Cousin shew yourself for Heaven's Sake Miss pursued she and second my Assurances that we are not forced away These generous Men come to fight for our Deliverance  The Highwaymen who were near enough to hear  Arabella  's Voice though they could not distinguish her Words gazed on her with great Surprize and finding they would be very well received thought fit to abandon their Enterprize and galloped away as fast as they were able Some of the Servants made a Motion to pursue them but Mr  Glanville  forbad it and entering again into the Coach congratulated the Ladies upon the Escape they had  Since these Men said  Arabella  did not come to deliver us out of a mistaken Notion that we were carried away by Force it must necessarily follow they had some bad Design and I protest I know not who to suspect is the Author of it unless the Person you vanquished  said she to Mr  Glanville  the other Day in a single Combat for the disguised  Edward  you assured me was dead But perhaps continued she it was some Lover of Miss  Glanville  's who designed to make an Attempt to carry her away Methinks he was too slenderly attended for such an hazardous Undertaking  I'll assure you Madam said Miss  Glanville  I have no Lovers among Highwaymen  Highwaymen repeated  Arabella  Why ay to be sure Madam rejoined Sir  Charles  What do you take them for  For Persons of Quality Sir resumed  Arabella  and though they came questionless either upon a good or bad Design yet it cannot be doubted but that their Birth is illustrious otherwise they would never pretend either to fight in our Defence or to carry us away  I vow Niece said Sir  Charles  I can't possibly understand you  My Cousin Sir interrupted Mr  Glanville  has been mistaken in these Persons and has not yet possibly believed them to be Highwaymen who came to rob us  There is no Question Sir said  Arabella  smiling that if they did not come to defend us they came to rob you But it is hard to guess which of us it was of whom they designed to deprive you for it may very possibly be for my Cousin's fake as well as mine that this Enterprize was undertaken  Pardon me Madam said Mr  Glanville  who was willing to prevent his Father from answering her Absurdities these Men had no other Design than to rob us of our Money  How said  Arabella  Were these Cavaliersâ–ª who appeared to be in so handsome a Garb that I took them for Persons of prime Quality were they Robbers I have been strangely mistaken it seems However I apprehend there is no Certainty that your Suspicions are true and it may still be as I say that they either came to rescue or carry us away  Mr  Glanville  to avoid a longer Dispute changed the Discourse having observed with Confusion that Sir  Charles  and his Sister seemed to look upon his beloved Cousin as one that was out of her Senss  CHAP III  Which concludes with an authentic Piece of History  ARABELLA  during the rest of this Journey was so wholly taken up in contemplating upon the last Adventure that she mixed but little in the Conversation Upon their drawing near  Bath  the Situation of that City afforded her the Means of making a Comparison between the Valley in which it was placed with the Amphitheatrical View of the Hills around it and the Valley of  Tempe  'Twas in such a Place as this said she pursuing her Comparison that the fair  Andronice  delivered the valiant  Hortensius  And really I could wish our Entrance into that City might  be preceded by an Act of equal Humanity with that of that fair Princess  For the Gratification of that Wish Madam sid Mr  Glanville  it is necessary some Person should meet with a Misfortune out of which you might be able to relieve him but I suppose the Benevolence of your Disposition may be equally satisfied with not finding any Occasion as of exercising it when it is found  Though it be not my Fortune to meet with those Occasions replied  Arabella  there is no Reason to doubt but others do who possibly have less Inclination to afford their Assistance than myself And it is possible if any other than the Princess of  Messina  had happened to pass by when  Hortensius  was in the Hands of the  Thessalians  he would not have been rescued from the ignominious Death he was destined to merely for killing a Stork  How interrupted Sir  Charles  put a Man to Death for killing a Stork Ridiculous Pray in what Part of the World did that happen Among the  Indians  of  America  I suppose  No Sir said  Arabella  in  Thessaly  the fairest Part in all  Macedonia  famous for the beautiful Valley of  Tempe  which excited the Curiosity of all Travellers whatever  No not all Madam returned Sir  Charlesâ–ª  for I am acquainted with several Travellers who never saw it nor even mentioned it and if it is so famous as you say I am surprised I never heard of it before  I don't know said  ArabÃ©lla  what those Travellers thought worthy of their Notice but I am certain that if any Chance should conduct  me into  Macedonia  I would not leave it till I saw the Valley of  Tempe  so celebrated by all the Poets and Historians  Dear Cousin cried  Glanville  who could hardly forbear smiling what Chance in the Name of Wonder should take you into  Macedonia  at so great a Distance from your own Country  And so said Sir  Charles  this famous Valley of  Tempe  is in  Turky  Why you must be very fond of travelling indeed Lady  Bella  if you would go into the  Great Mogul  's Country where the People are all Pagans they say and worship the Devil  The Country my Cousin speaks of said Mr  Glanville  is in the Grand Signor's Dominions The Great Mogul you know Sir  Well interrupted Sir  Charles  the Great Mogul or the Grand Signor I know not what you call him But I hope my Niece does not propose to go thither  Not unless I am forcibly carried thither said  Arabella  but I do determine if that Misfortune should ever happen to me that I would if possible visit the Vale of  Tempe  which is in that Part of  Greece  they call  Macedonia  Then I am persuaded replied Sir  Charles  you'll never see that famous Valley you talk of for it is not very likely you should be forcibly carried away into  Turky  And why do you think it unlikely that I should be carried thither interrupted  Arabella  Do not the same Things happen now that did formerly And is any thing more common then Ladies being carried by their Ravishers  into Countries far distant from their own May not the same Accidents happen to me that have happened to so many illustrious Ladies before me And may I not be carried into  Macedonia  by a Similitude of Destiny with that of a great many beautiful Princesses who though born in the most distant Quarters of the World chanced to meet at one time in the City of  Alexandria  and related their miraculous Adventures to each other  And it was for that very Purpose they met Madam said Mr  Glanville  smiling  Why truly said  Arabella  it happened very luckily for each of them that they were brought into a Place where they found so many illustrious Companions in Misfortune to whom they might freely communicate their Adventures which otherwise might haply have been concealed or at least have been imperfectly delivered down to us However added she smiling if I am carried into  Macedonia  and by that means have an Opportunity of visiting the famous Vale of  Tempe  I shall take care not to draw the Resentment of the  Thessalians  upon me by an Indiscretion like that of  Hortensius  For be pleased to know Sir said she addressing herself to her Uncle that his killing a Stork however inconsiderable a Matter it may appear to us was yet looked upon as a Crime of a very atrocious Nature among the  Thessalians  for they have a Law which forbids upon Pain of Death the killing of Storks the Reason for which is that  Thessaly  being subject to be infested with a prodigious Multitude  of Serpents which are a delightful Food to these Sorts of Fowls they look upon them as sacred Birds sent by the Gods to deliver them from these Serpents and Vipers And though  Hortensius  being a Stranger was pardoned through the Intercession of the Princess  Andronice  they made him promise to send another Stork into  Thessaly  to the end that he might be reputed innocent  CHAP IV  In which one of our Heroine's Whims is justified by some others full as whimsical  THIS Piece of History with Sir  Charles  's Remarks upon it brought them into  Bath  Their Lodgings being provided beforehand the Ladies retired to their different Chambers to repose themselves after the Fatigue of their Journey and did not meet again till Supper was on Table when Miss  Glanville  who had eagerly enquired what Company was then in the Place and heard there were a great many Persons of Fashion just arrived prest  Arabella  to go to the PumpRoom the next Morning assuring her she would find a very agreeable Amusement  Arabella  accordingly consented to accompany her and being told the Ladies went in an Undress of a Morning she accommodated herself to the Custom and went in a negligent Dress but instead of a Capuchin she were something  like a Veil of black Gauze which covered almost all her Face and Part of her Waist and gave her a very singular Appearance  Miss  Glanville  was too envious of her Cousin's Superiority in point of Beauty to inform her of any Oddity in her Dress which she thought might expose her to the Ridicule of those that saw her and Mr  Glanville  was too little a Critic in Ladies Apparel to be sensible that  Arabella  was not in the Fashion and since every thing she wore became her extremely he could not choose but think she drest admirably well He handed her therefore with a great deal of Satisfaction into the PumpRoom which happened to be greatly crouded that Morning  The Attention of most Part of the Company was immediately engaged by the Appearance Lady  Bella  made Strangers are here most strictly criticized and every new Object affords a delicious Feast of Raillery and Scandal  The Ladies alarmed at the Singularity of her Dress crouded together in Parties and the Words Who can she be Strange Creature Ridiculous and other Exclamations of the same Kind were whispered very intelligibly  The Men were struck with her Figure veiled as she was Her fine Stature the beautiful Turn of her Person the Grace and Elegance of her Motion attracted all their Notice The Phaenomena of the Veil however gave them great Disturbance So lovely a Person seemed to promise the Owner had a Face not unworthy of it but that was totally hid  from their View For  Arabella  at her Entrance into the Room had pulled the Gauze quite over her Face following therein the Custom of the Ladies in  Clelia  and the  Grand Cyrus  who in mixed Companies always hid their Faces with great Care  The Wits and PrettyFellows railed at the envious Covering and compared her to the Sun obscured by a Cloud while the Beaux  dem'd  the horrid Innovation and expressed a Fear lest it should grow into a Fashion  Some of the wiser Sort took her for a Foreigner others of still more Sagacity supposed her a  Scots  Lady covered with her Plaid and a third Sort infinitely wiser than either concluded she was a  Spanish  Nun that had escaped from a Convent and had not yet quitted her Veil  Arabella  ignorant of the Diversity of Opinions to which her Appearance gave Rise was taken up in discoursing with Mr  Glanville  upon the medicinal Virtue of the Springs the Oeconomy of the Baths the Nature of the Diversions and such other Topics as the Objects around them furnished her with  In the mean time Miss  Glanville  was got amidst a Croud of her Acquaintance who had hardly paid the Civilities of a first Meeting before they eagerly inquired who that Lady she brought with her was  Miss  Glanville  informed them that she was her Cousin and Daughter to the deceased Marquis ofadding with a Sneer That she had been brought up in the Country knew nothing of the World and had some very peculiar Notions  as you may see said she by that odd kind of Covering she wears  Her Name and Quality were presently whispered all over the Room The Men hearing she was a great Heiress found greater Beauties to admire in her Person The Ladies aw'd by the Sanction of Quality dropt their Ridicule on her Dress and began to quote Examples of Whims full as inexcusable  One remembred that Lady  JT  alalways wore her Ruffles reversed that the Countess ofwent to Court in a Farthingale that the Duchess ofsat astride upon a Horse and a certain Lady of great Fortune and nearly allied to Quality because she was not dignified with a Title invented a new one for herself and directed her Servants to say in speaking to her  Your Honouress  which afterwards became a Custom among all her Acquaintance who mortally offended her if they omitted that Instance of Respect  CHAP V  Containing some historical Anecdotes the Truth of which may possibly be doubted as they are not to be found in any of the Historians  AFTER a short Stay in the Room  Arabella  expressing a Desire to return home Mr  Glanville  conducted her out Two Gentlemen of his Acquaintance attending Miss  Glanville  Sir  Charles  detained them to Breakfast by which means they had an Opportunity of satisfying their Curiosity and beheld  Arabella  divested of that Veil which had as they said and 'tis probable they said no more than they thought concealed one of the finest Faces in the World  Miss  Glanville  had the Mortification to see both the Gentlemen so charmed with the Sight of her Cousin's Face that for a long time she sat wholly neglected but the Seriousness of her Behaviour giving some little Disgust to the youngest of them who was what the Ladies call a PrettyFellow a dear Creature and the most diverting Man in the World he applied himself wholly to Miss  Glanville  and soon engaged her in a particular Conversation  Mr  Selvin  so was the other Gentleman called was of a much graver Cast He affected to be thought deepread in History and never failed to take all Opportunities of displaying his Knowlege of Antiquity which was indeed but very superficial but having some few Anecdotes by Heart which he would take Occation to introduce as often as he could he passed among many Persons for one who by Application and Study had acquired an universal Knowlege of antient History  Speaking of any particular Circumstance he would fix the Time by computing the Year with the Number of the Olympiads  It happened he would say in the st Olympiad  Such an amazing Exactness had a suitable  Effect on his Audience and always procured him a great Degree of Attention  This Gentleman hitherto had no Opportunity of displaying his Knowledge of History the Discourse having wholly turned upon News and other Trifles when  Arabella  after some more Inquiries concerning the Place remarked that there was a very great Difference between the medicinal Waters at  Bath  and the fine Springs at the Foot of the Mountain  Thermopylae  in  Greece  as well in their Qualities as manner of using them and I am of Opinion added she that  Bath  famous as it is for restoring Health is less frequented by infirm Persons than the famous Springs of  Thermopylae  were by the Beauties of  Greece  to whom those Waters have the Reputation of giving new Lustre  Mr  Selvin  who with all his Reading had never met with any Account of these celebrated  Grecian  Springs was extremely disconcerted at not being able to continue a Conversation which the Silence of the rest of the Company made him imagine was directed wholly to him  The Shame he conceived at seeing himself posed by a Girl in a Matter which so immediately belonged to him made him resolve to draw himself out of this Dilemma at any Rate aud though he was far from being convinced that there were no such Springs at  Thermopylae  as  Arabella  mentioned yet he resolutely maintained that she must be mistaken in their Situation for to his certain Knowlege there were  no medicinal Waters at the Foot of that Mountain  Arabella  who could not endure to be contradicted in what she took to be so incontestable a Fact reddened with Vexation at his unexpected Denial  It should seem said she by your Discourse that you are unacquainted with many material Passages that passed among very illustrious Persons there and if you knew any thing of  Pisistratus  the  Athenian  you would know that an Adventure he had at those Baths laid the Foundation of all those great Designs which he afterwards effected to the total Subversion of the  Athenian  Government  Mr  Selvin  surprised that this Piece of History had likewise escaped his Observation resolved however not to give up his Point  I think Madam replied he with great Selfsufficiency that I am pretty well acquainted with every thing which relates to the Affairs of the  Athenian  Commonwealth and know by what Steps  Pisistratus  advanced himself to the Sovereignty It was a great Stroke of Policy in him said he turning to Mr  Glanville  indeed to wound himself in order to get a Guard assigned him  You are mistaken Sir said  Arabella  if you believe there was any Truth in the Report of his having wounded himself It was done either by his Rival  Lycurgus  or  Theocrites  who believing him still to be in Love with the fair  Cerinthe  whom he courted took that Way to get rid of him Neither is it true that Ambition alone inspired  Pisistratus  with a Design of  enslaving his Country Those Authors who say so must know little of the Springs and Motives of his Conduct It was neither Ambition nor Revenge that made him act as he did it was the violent Affection he conceived for the beautiful  Chorante  whom he first saw at the famous Baths of  Thermopylae  which put him upon those Designs for seeing that  Lycurgus  who was not his Rival in Ambition but Love would certainly become the Possessor of  Chorante  unless he made himself Tyrant of  Athens  he had recourse to that violent Method in order to preserve her for himself  I protest Madam said Mr  Selvin  casting down his Eyes in great Confusion at her superior Knowlege in History these Particulars have all escaped my Notice and this is the first time I ever understood that  Pisistratus  was violently in Love and that it was not Ambition which made him aspire to Sovereignty  I do not remember any Mention of this in  Plutarch  continued he rubbing his Forehead or any of the Authors who have treated on the Affairs of  Greece  Very likely Sir replied  Arabella  but you will see the whole Story of  Pisistratus  's Love for  Chorante  with the Effects it produced related at large in  Scudery  Scudery  Madam said the sage Mr  Selvin  I never read that Historian  No Sir replied  Arabella  then your Reading has been very confined  I know Madam said he that  Herodotus Thucydides  and  Plutarch  have indeed quoted him frequently  I am surprised Sir said Mr  Glanville  who was excessively diverted at this Discovery of his great Ignorance and Affectation that you have not read that famous Historian especially as the Writers you have mentioned quote him so often  Why to tell you the Truth Sir said he though he was a  Roman  yet it is objected to him that he wrote but indifferent  Latin  with no Purity or Elegance and  You are quite mistaken Sir interrupted  Arabella  the great  Scudery  was a  Frenchman  and both his  Clelia  and  Artamenes  were written in  French  A  Frenchman  was he said Mr  Selvin  with a lofty Air Oh then 'tis not surprising that I have not read him I read no Authors but the Antients Madam added he with a Look of Selfapplause I cannot relish the Moderns at all I have no Taste for their Way of Writing  But  Scudery  must needs be more ancient than  Thucydides  and the rest of those  Greek  Historians you mentioned said Mr  Glanville  How else could they quote him  Mr  Selvin  was here so utterly at a Loss that he could not conceal his Confusion He held down his Head and continued silent while the Beau who had listened to the latter Part of their Discourse exerted his supposed Talent of Raillery against the unhappy Admirer of the antient Authors and increased his Confusion by a thousand Sarcasms which gave more Diversion to himself than any body else  CHAP VI  Which contains some excellent Rules for Raillery  MR  Glanville  who had too much Politeness and Good nature to insist too long upon the Ridicule in the Character of his Acquaintance changed the Discourse And  Arabella  who had observed with some Concern the illjudged Raillery of the young Beau took Occasion to decry that Species of Wit and gave it as her Opinion that it was very dangerous and unpleasing  For truly said she it is almost impossible to use it without being hated or feared and whoever gets a Habit of it is in Danger of wronging all the Laws of Friendship and Humanity  Certainly pursued she looking at the Beau it is extremely unjust to railly one's Friends and particular Acquaintance First choose them well and be as nice as you please in the Choice but when you have chosen them by no means play upon them 'Tis cruel and malicious to divert one's self at the Expence of one's Friend  However Madam said Mr  Glanville  who was charmed to hear her talk so rationally you may give People Leave to railly their Enemies  Truly resumed  Arabella  I cannot allow that any more than upon Friends for Raillery is the poorest kind of Revenge that can be taken  Methinks it is mean to railly Persons who have a small Share of Merit since haply their Defects were born with them and not of their own acquiring and it is great Injustice to descant upon one slight Fault in Men of Parts to the Prejudice of a thousand good Qualities  For aught I see Madam said the Beau you will not allow one to railly any body  I am of Opinion Sir said  Arabella  that there are very few proper Objects for Raillery and still fewer who can railly well The Talent of Raillery ought to be born with a Person no Art can infuse it and those who endeavour to railly in spite of Nature will be so far from diverting others that they will become the Objects of Ridicule themselves  Many other pleasing Qualities of Wit may be acquired by Pains and Study but Raillery must be the Gift of Nature It is not enough to have many lively and agreeable Thoughts but there must be such an Expression as must convey their full Force and Meaning the Air the Aspect the Tone of the Voice and every Part in general must contribute to its Perfection  There ought also to be a great Distance between Raillery and Satire so that one may never be mistaken for the other Raillery ought indeed to surprise and sensibly touch those to whom it is directed but I would not have the Wounds it makes either deep or lasting Let those who feel it be hurt like Persons who gathering Roses are pricked by the Thorns and find a sweet Smoll to make amends  I would have Raillery raise the Fancy and quicken the Imagination the Fire of its Wit should only enable us to trace its Original and shine as the Stars do but not burn Yet after all I cannot greatly approve of Raillery or cease to think it dangerous and to pursue my Comparison said she with an inchanting Smile Persons who possess the true Talent of Raillery are like Comets they are seldom seen and are at once admir'd and fear'd  I protest Lady  Bella  said Sir  Charles  who had listen'd to her with many Signs of Admiration you speak like an Orator  One would not imagine interrupted Mr  Glanville  who saw  Arabella  in some Confusion at the coarse Praise her Uncle gave her that my Cousin could speak so accurately of a Quality she never practises And 'tis easy to judge by what she has said that no body can railly finer than herself if she pleases  Mr  Selvin  tho' he bore her a Grudge for knowing more History than he did yet assur'd her that she had given the best Rules imaginable for raillying well But the Beau whom she had silenc'd by her Reproof was extremely angry and supposing it would mortify her to see him pay Court to her Cousin he redoubled his Assiduities to Miss  Glanville  who was highly delighted at seeing  Arabella  less taken Notice of by this gay Gentleman than herself  CHAP VII  In which the Author condescends to be very minute in the Description of our Heroin's Dress  THE Indifference of Mr  Tinsel  convincing Miss  Glanville  that  Arabella  was less to be dreaded than she imagin'd she had no Reluctance at seeing her prepare for her publick Appearance the next Ball Night  Having consulted her Fancy in a rich Silver Stuff she had bought for that Purpose a Person was sent for to make it and  Arabella  who follow'd no Fashion but her own Taste which was form'd on the Manners of the Heroines order'd the Woman to make her a Robe after the same Model as the Princess  Julia  's  The Mantuamaker who thought it might do her great Prejudice with her new Customer to acknowledge she knew nothing of the Princess  Julia  or the Fashion of her Gown replied at Random and with great Pertness  That that Taste was quite out and she would advise her Ladyship to have her Cloaths made in the present Mode which was far more becoming  You can never persuade me said  Arabella  that any Fashion can be more becoming than that of the Princess  Julia  's who was the most gallant Princess upon Earth and knew better than any other how to set off her Charms It may indeed be a little obselete now pursued  she for the Fashion could not but alter a little in the Compass of near two thousand Years  Two thousand Years Madam said the Woman in a great Surprize Lord help us Tradespeople if they did not alter a thousand Times in as many Days I thought your Ladyship was speaking of the last Month's Taste which as I said before is quite out now  Well replied  Arabella  let the present Mode be what it will I insist upon having my Cloaths made after the Pattern of the beautiful Daughter of  Augustus  being convinced that none other can be half so becoming  What Fashion was that pray Madam said the Woman I never saw it  How replied  Arabella  Have you already forgot the Fashion of the Princess  Julia  's Robe which you said was wore but last Month Or are you ignorant that the Princess  Julia  and the Daughter of  Augustus  is the same Person  I protest Madam said the Woman extremely confus'd I had forgot that till you called it to my Mind  Well said  Arabella  make me a Robe in the same Taste  The Mantuamaker was now wholly at a Loss in what Manner to behave for being conscious that she knew nothing of the Princess  Julia  's Fashion she could not undertake to make it without Directions and she was afraid of discovering her Ignorance by asking for any so that her Silence and Embarrassment persuading  Arabella  she knew nothing of the Matter she dismist her with a small Present for the Trouble she had given her and had Recourse  to her usual Expedient which was to make one of her Women who understood a little of the Mantuamaking Business make a Robe for her after her own Directions  Miss  Glanville  who imagin'd she had sent for Workwomen in order to have Cloaths made in the modern Taste was surpriz'd at her Entrance into her Chamber to see her dressing for the Ball in a Habit singular to the last Degree  She wore no Hoop and the Blue and Silver Stuff of her Robe was only kept by its own Richness from hanging close about her It was quite open round her Breast which was shaded with a rich Border of Lace and clasping close to her Waist by small Knots of Diamonds descended in a sweeping Train on the Ground  The Sleeves were short wide and slash'd fastned in different Places with Diamonds and her Arms were partly hid by half a Dozen Falls of Ruffles Her Hair which fell in very easy Ringlets on her Neck was plac'd with great Care and Exactness round her lovely Face and the Jewels and Ribbons which were all her Headdress dispos'd to the greatest Advantage  Upon the whole nothing could be more singularly becoming than her Dress or set off with greater Advantage the striking Beauties of her Person  Miss  Glanville  tho' she was not displeas'd to see her persist in her Singularity of Dress yet could not behold her look so lovely in it without feeling a secret Uneasiness but consoling herself with the Hopes of the Ridicule she  would occasion she assum'd a chearful Air approv'd her Taste in the Choice of her Colours and went with her at the usual Hour to the Rooms attended by Mr  Glanville  Mr  Selvin  and the young Beau we have formerly mention'd  The Surprize  Arabella  's unusual Appearance gave to the whole Company was very visible to every one but herself  The Moment she enter'd the Room every one whisper'd the Person next to them and for some Moments nothing was heard but the Words the Princess  Julia  which was eccho'd at every Corner and at last attracted her Observation  Mr  Glanville  and the rest of the Company with her were in some Confusion at the universal Exclamation which they imagin'd was occasion'd by the Singularity of her Habit tho' they could not conceive why they gave her that Title Had they known the Adventure of the Mantuamaker it would doubtless have easily occurr'd to them for the Woman had no sooner left  Arabella  than she related the Conference she had with a Lady newly arriv'd who had requir'd her to make a Robe in the Manner of the Princess  Julia  's and dismiss'd her because she did not understand the Fashions that prevail'd two thousand Years ago  This Story was quickly dispers'd and for its Novelty afforded a great deal of Diversion every one long'd to see a Fashion of such Antiquity and expected the Appearance of the Princess  Julia  with great Impatience  It is not to be doubted but much Mirth was treasur'd up for her Appearance and the occasional Humourist had already prepared his accustom'd Jest when the Sight of the devoted fair One repell'd his Vivacity and the design'd Ridicule of the whole Assembly  Scarce had the first tumultous Whisper escap'd the Lips of each Individual when they found themselves aw'd to Respect by that irresistable Charm in the Person of  Arabella  which commanded Reverence and Love from all who beheld her  Her noble Air the native Dignity in her Looks the inexpressible Grace which accompany'd all her Motions and the consummate Loveliness of her Form drew the Admiration of the whole Assembly  A respectful Silence succeeded and the Astonishment her Beauty occasion'd left them no Room to descant on the Absurdity of her Dress  Miss  Glanville  who felt a malicious Joy at the Sneers she expected would be cast on her Cousin was greatly disappointed at the Deference which seem'd to be paid her and to vent some Part of her Spleen took occasion to mention her Surprize at the Behaviour of the Company on their Entrance wondering what they could mean by whispering the Princess  Julia  to one another  I assure you said  Arabella  smiling I am not less surpriz'd than you at it and since they directed their Looks to me at the same Time I fancy they either took me for some Princess of the Name of  Julia  who is expected here toNight  or else flatter me with some Resemblance to the beautiful Daughter of  Augustus  The Comparison Madam said Mr  Selvin  who took all Occasions to shew his Reading is too injurious to you for I am of Opinion you as much excel that licentious Lady in the Beauties of your Person as you do in the Qualities of your Mind  I never heard Licentiousness imputed to the Daughter of  Augustus Caesar  said  Arabella  and the most her Enemies can say of her is that she loved Admiration and would permit herself to be beloved and to be told so without shewing any Signs of Displeasure  Bless me Madam interrupted Mr  Selvin  how strangely do you mistake the Character of  Julia  Tho' the Daughter of an Emperor she was pardon the Expression the most abandon'd Prostitute in  Rome  many of her Intrigues are recorded in History but to mention only one Was not her infamous Commerce with  Ovid  the Cause of his Banishment  CHAP VIII  Some Reflexions very fit and others very unfit for an AssemblyRoom  YOU speak in strange Terms replied  Arabella  blushing of a Princess who if she was not the most reserv'd and severe Person in the World was yet nevertheless absolutely chaste  I know there were People who represented her Partiality for  Ovid  in a very unfavourable Light but that ingenious Poet when he related his History to the great  Agrippa  told him in Confidence all that had pass'd between him and the Princess  Julia  than which nothing could be more innocent tho' a little indiscreet For 'tis certain that she permitted him to love her and did not condemn him to any rigorous Punishment for daring to tell her so yet for all this as I said before tho' she was not altogether so austere as she ought to have been yet she was nevertheless a most virtuous Princess  Mr  Selvin  not daring to contradict a Lady whose extensive Reading had furnish'd her with Anecdotes unknown almost to any Body else by his Silence confess'd her Superiority But Mr  Glanville  who knew all these Anecdotes were drawn from Romances which he found contradicted the known Facts in History and assign'd the most ridiculous Causes for Things of the greatest Importance could not help smiling at the Facility with which Mr  Selvin  gave into those idle Absurdities For notwithstanding his Affectation of great Reading his superficial Knowledge of History made it extremely easy to deceive him and as it was his Custom to mark in his PocketBook all the Scraps of History he heard introduced into Conversation and retail them again in other Company he did not doubt but he would make a Figure with the curious Circumstances  Arabella  had furnish'd him with  Arabella  observing Mr  Tinsel  by his familiar Bows significant Smiles and easy Salutations  was acquainted with the greatest Part of the Assembly told him that she did not doubt but he knew the Adventures of many Persons whom they were viewing and that he would do her a Pleasure if he would relate some of them  Mr  Tinsel  was charm'd with a Request which afforded him an Opportunity of gratifying a favourite Inclination and seating himself near her immediately was beginning to obey her Injunctions when she gracefully intreated him to stay a Moment and calling to Mr  Glanville  and his Sister who were talking to Mr  Selvin  ask'd them if they chose to partake of a more rational Amusement than Dancing and listen to the Adventures of some illustrious Persons which Mr  Tinsel  had promis'd to relate  I assure you Madam said Mr  Glanville  smiling you will find that a less innocent Amusement than Dancing  Why so Sir replied  Arabella  since it is not an indiscreet Curiosity which prompts me to a Desire of hearing the Histories Mr  Tinsel  has promis'd to entertain me with but rather a Hope of hearing something which may at once improve and delight me something which may excite my Admiration engage my Esteem or influence my Practice  'Twas doubtless with such Motives as these that we find Princesses and Ladies of the most illustrious Rank in  Clelia  and the Grand  Cyrus  listning to the Adventures of Persons in whom they were probably as little interested as we are in these around us Kings Princes and Commanders of Armies thought it was no Waste of their Time in the midst of the  Hurry and Clamour of a Camp to listen many Hours to the Relation of one single History and not fill'd with any extraordinary Events but haply a simple Recital of common Occurrences The great  Cyrus  while he was busy in reducing all  Asia  to his Yoke heard nevertheless the Histories of all the considerable Persons in the Camp besides those of Strangers and even his Enemies If there was therefore any thing either criminal or mean in hearing the Adventures of others do you imagine so many great and illustrious Persons would have given in to such an Amusement  After this  Arabella  turn'd gravely about to Mr  Tinsel  and told him he was at Liberty to begin his Recital  The Beau a little disconcerted by the Solemnity with which she requested his Information knew not how to begin with the Formality that he saw was required of him and therefore fat silent for a few Moments which  Arabella  suppos'd was to recall to his Memory all the Passages he propos'd to relate  His Perplexity would probably have increas'd instead of lessening by the profound Silence which she observed had not Miss  Glanville  seated herself with a sprightly Air on the other Side of him and directing his Eyes to a tall handsome Woman that had just enter'd ask'd him pleasantly to tell her History if he knew it  Mr  Tinsel  brought into his usual Track by this Question answer'd smiling That the History of that Lady was yet a Secret or known but to very few but my Intelligence added  he is generally the  and may always be depended on  Perhaps said  the Lady is one of your Acquaintances  you with the Recital of her  from her own Mouth  No really Madam answer'd Mr  Tinsel  surpriz'd at the great Simplicity of  Arabella  for so he understood it the Lady I believe is not so communicative And to say the Truth I should not chuse to hear her Adventures from herself since she certainly would suppress the most material Circumstances  In a Word said he lowering his Voice That Lady was for many Years the Mistress of a young military Nobleman whom she was so complaisant to follow in all his Campaigns Marches Sieges and every Inconveniency of War He married her in  Gibraltar  from whence he is lately arriv'd and introduc'd his new Lady to his noble Brother by whom she was not unfavourably receiv'd 'Tis worth remarking that this same haughty Peer thought sit to resent with implacable Obstinacy the Marriage of another of his Brothers with the Widow of a brave Officer of considerable Rank in the Army 'Tis true she was several Years older than the young Lord and had no Fortune but the Duke assign'd other Reasons for his Displeasure He complain'd loudly that his Brother had dishonour'd the Nobility of his Birth by this Alliance and continued his Resentment till the Death of the young Hero who gave many remarkable Proofs of his Courage and Fortitude upon several Occasions and died gloriously before the Walls of  Carthagena  leaving his disconsolate Lady a Widow a second Time with the Acquisition of a Title indeed but a very small Addition to her Fortune  Observe that gay splendid Lady I beseech you Madam pursued he turning to  Arabella  how affectedly she looks and talks and throws her Eyes around the Room with a haughty Selfsufficiency in her Aspect and insolent Contempt for every Thing but herself Her Habit her Speech her Motions are all  French  nothing in  England  is able to please her the People so dull so aukwardly polite the Manners so gross no Delicacy no Elegance no Magnificence in their Persons Houses or Diversions every Thing is so distasteful there is no living in such a Place One may crawl about indeed she says and make a shift to breathe in the odious Country but one cannot be said to live and with all the Requisites to render Life delightful here one can only suffer not enjoy it  Would one not imagine pursued he this fine Lady was a Person of very exalted Rank who has the Sanction of Birth Riches and Grandeur for her extraordinary Pride and yet she is no other than the Daughter of an InnKeeper at  Spa  and had the exalted Post assign'd her of attending new Lodgers to their Apartments acquainting them with all the Conveniences of the Place answering an humble Question or two concerning what Company was in the Town what Scandal was stirring and the like  One of our great Sea Commanders going thither for his Health happen'd to lodge at this Inn and was so struck with her Charms that he marry'd her in a few Weeks and soon after brought her to  England  Such was the Origin of this fantastick Lady whose insupportable Pride and ridiculous Affectation draws Contempt and Aversion whereshe appears  Did I not tell you Madam interrupted Mr  Glanville  that the Amusement you had chose was not so innocent as Dancing What a deal of Scandal has Mr  Tinsel  utter'd in the Compass of a few Minutes  I assure you replied  Arabella  I know not what to make of the Histories he has been relating I think they do not deserve that Name and are rather detatched Pieces of Satire on particular Persons than a serious Relation of Facts I confess my Expectations from this Gentleman have not been answer'd  I think however Madam said Mr  Glanville  we may allow that there is a negative Merit in the Relations Mr  Tinsel  has made for if he has not shewn us any Thing to approve he has at least shewn us what to condemn  The Ugliness of Vice reply'd  Arabella  ought only to be represented to the Vicious to whom Satire like a magnifying Glass may aggravate every Defect in order to make its Deformity appear more hideous but since its End is only to reprove and amend it should never be address'd to any but those who come within its Correction and may be the better for it A virtuous Mind need not be shewn  the Deformity of Vice to make it be hated and avoided the more pure and uncorrupted our Ideas are the less shall we be insluenc'd by Example A natural Propensity to Virtue or Vice often determines the Choice 'Tis sufficient therefore to shew a good Mind what it ought to pursue though a bad one must be told what to avoid In a Word one ought to be always incited the other always restrain'd  I vow Lady  Bella  said Miss  Glanville  you'd make one think one came here to hear a Sermon you are so very grave and talk upon such highflown Subjects What Harm was there in what Mr  Tinsel  was telling us It would be hard indeed if one might not divert one's self with other Peoples Faults  I am afraid Miss said  Arabella  those who can divert themselves with the Faults of others are not behind hand in affording Diversion And that very Inclination added she smilingly to hear other Peoples Faults may by those very People be condemned as one and afford them the same Kind of illnatur'd Pleasure you are so desirous of  Nay Madam return'd Miss  Glanville  your Ladyship was the first who introduc'd the Discourse you condemn so much Did not you desire Mr  Tinsel  to tell you Histories about the Company and ask my brother and me to come and hear them  'Tis true reply'd  Arabella  that I did desire you to partake with me of a pleasing and rational Amusement for such I imagin'd Mr  Tinsel  's Histories might afford far from a Detail of Vices Follies and Irregularities I  expected to have heard the Adventures of some illustrious Personages related between whose Actions and those of the Heroes and Heroines of Antiquity I might have found some Resemblance  For Instance I hop'd to have heard imitated the sublime Courage of a  Clelia  who to save her Honour from the Attempts of the impious  Tarquin  leap'd into the River  Tyber  and swam to the other Side or the noble Resolution of the incomparable  Candace  who to escape out of the Hands of her Ravisher the Pirate  Zenadorus  set Fire to his Vessel with her own Hands and committed herself to the Mercy of the Waves Or the Constancy and Affection of a  Mandana  who for the Sake of a  Cyrus  refused the richest Crowns in the World and braved the Terrors of Death to preserve herself for him  As for the Men I hoped to have heard of some who might have almost equall'd the great  Oroondates  the invincible  Artaban  the valiant  Juba  the renowned  Alcamenes  and many thousand Heroes of Antiquity whose glorious Exploits in War aud unsaken Constancy in Love have given them an immortal Fame  While  Arabella  was uttering this long Speech with great Emotion Miss  Glanville  with a sly Look at the Beau gave him to understand that was her Cousin's Foible  Mr  Tinsel  however not able to comprehend the Meaning of what she said listen'd to her with many Signs of Perplexity and Wonder  Mr  Selvin  in secret repin'd at her prodigious Knowledge of History and Mr  Glanville  with his Eyes fix'd on the Ground bit his Lips almost through with Madness  In the mean Time several among the Company desirous of hearing what the strange Lady was saying so loud and with so much Eagerness and Emotion gather'd round them which Mr  Glanville  observing and fearing  Arabella  would expose herself still farther whisper'd his Sister to get her away if possible  Miss  Glanville  tho' very unwilling obey'd his Injunctions and complaining of a sudden Headach  Arabella  immediately propos'd retiring which was joyfully complied with by Mr  Glanville  who with the other Gentlemen attended them home  CHAP IX  Being a Chapter of the Satyrical Kind  AT their Return Sir  Charles  told his Niece That she had now had a Specimen of the World and some of the fashionable Amusements and ask'd her how she had been entertain'd  Why truly Sir replied she smiling I have brought away no great Relish for a Renewal of the Amusement I have partaken of Tonight If the World in which you seem to think I am but new initiated affords only these Kinds of Pleasures I shall very soon regret the Solitude and Books I have quitted  Why pray said Miss  Glanville  What Kind of Amusements did your Ladyship expect to find in the World And what was there disagreeable in your Entertainment to Night I am sure there is no Place in  England  except  London  where there is so much good Company to be met with as here The Assembly was very numerous and brillant and one can be at no Loss for Amusements The PumpRoom in the Morning the Parade and the Rooms in the Evening with little occasional Parties of Pleasure will find one sufficient Employment and leave none of one's Time to lye useless upon one's Hand  I am of Opinion replied  Arabella  that one's Time is far from being well employ'd in the Manner you portion it out And People who spend theirs in such trifling Amusements must certainly live to very little Purpose  What room I pray you does a Lady give for high and noble Adventures who consumes her Days in Dressing Dancing listening to Songs and ranging the Walks with People as thoughtless as herself How mean and contemptible a Figure must a Life spent in such idle Amusements make in History Or rather Are not such Persons always buried in Oblivion and can any Pen be found who would condescend to record such inconsiderable Actions  Nor can I persuade myself added she that any of those Men whom I saw at the Assembly with Figures so feminine Voices so soft such tripping Steps and unmeaning Gestures have ever signalized either their Courage or Constancy  but might be overcome by their Enemy in Battle or be false to their Mistress in Love  Law Cousin reply'd Miss  Glanville  you are always talking of Battles and Fighting Do you expect that Persons of Quality and fine Gentlemen will go to the Wars What Business have they to fight That belongs to the Officers  Then every fine Gentleman is an Officer said  Arabella  and some other Title ought to be found out for Men who do nothing but Dance and Dress  I could never have imagined interrupted Mr  Tinsel  surveying  Arabella  that a Lady so elegant and gay in her own Appearance should have an Aversion to Pleasure and Magnificence  I assure you Sir replied  Arabella  I have an Aversion to neither On the contrary I am a great Admirer of both But my Ideas of Amusements and Grandeur are probably different from yours  I will allow the Ladies to be sollicitous about their Habits and dress with all the Care and Elegance they are capable of but such Trifles are below the Consideration of a Man who ought not to owe the Dignity of his Appearance to the Embroidery on his Coat but to his high and noble Air the Grandeur of his Courage the Elevation of his Sentiments and the many heroick Actions he has perform'd  Such a Man will dress his Person with a graceful Simplicity and lavish all his Gold and Embroidery upon his Armour to render him conspicuous in the Day of Battle The Plumes in his Helmet will look more graceful in the  Field than the Feather in his Hat at a Ball and Jewels blaze with more Propriety on his Shield and Cuirass in Battle than glittering on his Finger in a Dance  Do not imagine however pursued she that I absolutely condemn Dancing and think it a Diversion wholly unworthy of a Hero  History has recorded some very famous Balls at which the most illustrious Persons in the World have appear'd  Cyrus  the Great we are inform'd open'd a Ball with the divine  Mandana  at  Sardis  The renown'd King of  Scythia  danc'd with the Princess  Cleopatra  at  Alexandria  The brave  Cleomedon  with the fair  Candace  at  Ethiopia  but these Diversions were taken but seldom and consider'd indeed as an Amusement not as a Part of the Business of Life  How would so many glorious Battles have been fought Cities taken Ladies rescu'd and other great and noble Adventures been atchiev'd if the Men sunk in Sloth and Effeminacy had continually follow'd the Sound of a Fiddle saunter'd in Publick Walks and tattled over a Teatable  I vow Cousin said Miss  Glanville  you are infinitely more severe in your Censures than Mr  Tinsel  was at the Assembly You had little Reason methinks to be angry with him  All I have said reply'd  Arabella  were the natural Inference from your own Account of the Manner in which People live here When Actions are a Censure upon themselves the Reciter will always be consider'd as a Satirist  CHAP X  In which our Heroine justifies her own Notions by some very illustrious Examples  MR  Selvin  and Mr  Tinsel  who had listen'd attentively to this Discourse of  Arabella  took Leave as soon as it was ended and went away with very different Opinions of her  Mr  Tinsel  declaring she was a Fool and had no Knowledge of the World and Mr  Selvin  convinc'd she was a Wit and very learn'd in Antiquity  Certainly said Mr  Selvin  in Support of his Opinion the Lady has great Judgment has been capable of prodigious Application as is apparent by her extensive Reading Then her Memory is quite miraculous I protest I am quite charm'd with her I never met with such a Woman in my Life  Her Cousin in my Opinion reply'd Mr  Tinsel  is infinitely beyond her in every Merit but Beauty How sprightly and free her Conversation What a thorough Knowledge of the World So true a Taste for polite Amusements and a Fund of Spirits that sets Vapours and Spleen at Defiance  This Speech bringing on a Comparison between the Ladies the Champions for each grew so warm in the Dispute that they had like to have quarrell'd However by the Interposition  of some other Gentlemen who were with them they parted tolerable Friends that Night and renew'd their Visits to Sir  Charles  in the Morning  They found only Miss  Glanville  with her Father and Brother  Arabella  generally spent the Mornings in her own Chamber where Reading and the Labours of the Toilet employ'd her Time till Dinner Tho' it must be confess'd to her Honour that the latter engross'd but a very small Part of it  Miss  Glanville  with whom the Beau had a long Conversation at one of the Windows in which he recounted his Dispute with Mr  Selvin  and the Danger he ran of being pink'd in a Duel that was his Phrase for her Sake at last propos'd a Walk to which she consented and engag'd to prevail upon  Arabella  to accompany them  That Lady at first positively refus'd alleging in Excuse That she was so extremely interested in the Fate of the Princess  Melisintha  whose Story she was reading that she could not stir till she had finish'd it  That poor Princess continu'd she is at present in a most terrible Situation She has just set Fire to the Palace in order to avoid the Embraces of a King who forc'd her to marry him I am in Pain to know how she escapes the Flames  Pshaw interrupted Miss  Glanville  let her perish there if she will Don't let her hinder our Walk  Who is it you doom with so much Cruelty to perish said  Arabella  closing the Book and  looking stedfastly on her Cousin Is it the beautiful  Melisintha  that Princess whose Fortitude and Patience have justly render'd her the Admiration of the whole World That Princess descended from a Race of Heroes whose heroick Virtues all glow'd in her own beauteous Breast that Princess who when taken Captive with the King her Father bore her Imprisonment and Chains with a marvellous Constancy and who when she enslaved her Conqueror and given Fetters to the Prince who held her Father and herself in Bonds nobly refus'd the Diadem he proffer'd her and devoted herself to Destruction in order to punish the Enemy of her House I am not able to relate the rest of her History seeing I have read no further myself but if you will be pleased to sit down and listen to me while I read what remains I am persuaded you will find new Cause to love and admire this amiable Princess  Pardon me Madam said Miss  Glanville  I have heard enough and I could have been very well satisfy'd not to have heard so much I think we waste a great deal of Time talking about People we know nothing of The Morning will be quite lost if we don't make Haste Come added she you must go You have a new Lover below who waits to go with us he'll die if I don't bring you  A new Lover return'd  Arabella  surpriz'd  Aye aye said Miss  Glanville  the learned Mr  Selvin  I assure you he had almost quarrell'd with Mr  Tinsel  last Night about your Ladyship  Arabella  at this Intelligence casting down her Eyes discover'd many Signs of Anger and Confusion And after a Silence of some Moments during which Miss  Glanville  had been employ'd in adjusting her Dress at the Glass addressing herself to her Cousin with an Accent somewhat less sweet than before  Had any other than yourself Miss said she acquainted me with the Presumption of that unfortunate Person I should haply have discover'd my Resentment in other Terms But as it is must inform you that I take it extremely ill you should be accessary to giving me this Offence  Hey day said Miss  Glanville  turning about hastily How have I offended your Ladyship pray  I am willing to hope Cousin reply'd  Arabella  that it was only to divert yourself with the Trouble and Confusion in which you see me that you have indiscreetly told Things which ought to have been bury'd in Silence  And what is all this mighty Trouble and Confusion about then Madam said Miss  Glanville  smiling Is it because I told you Mr  Selvin  was a Lover of your Ladyship  Certainly said  Arabella  such an Information is sufficient to give one a great deal of Perplexity Is it such a little Matter think you to be told that a Man has the Presumption to love one  A meer Trifle reply'd Miss  Glanville  laughing a hundred Lovers are not worth a Moment's Thought when one's sure of them for then the Trouble is all over And as for this  unfortunate Person as your Ladyship called him let him die at his Leisure while we go to the Parade  Your Levity Cousin said  Arabella  forces me to smile notwithstanding the Cause I have to be incens'd however I have Charity enough to make me not desire the Death of Mr  Selvin  who may repair the Crime he has been guilty of by Repentance and Discontinuation  Well then said Miss  Glanville  you are resolv'd to go to the Parade Shall I reach you your odd Kind of Capuchin  How said  Arabella  can I with any Propriety see a Man who has discover'd himself to have a Passion for me Will he not construe such a Favour into a Permission for him to hope  Oh no interrupted Miss  Glanville  he does not imagine I have told your Ladyship he loves you for indeed he don't know that I am acquainted with his Passion  Then he is less culpable than I thought him reply'd  Arabella  and if you think I am in no Danger of hearing a Confession of his Fault from his own Mouth I'll comply with your Request and go with you to the Parade But added she I must first engage you to promise not to leave me alone a Moment lest he should take Advantage of such an Opportunity to give some Hint of his Passion that would force me to treat him very rigorously  Miss  Glanville  answer'd laughing That she would be sure to mind her Directions However said she your Ladyship need not be apprehensive he will say any fine Things to you  for I knew a young Lady he was formerly in Love with and the odious Creature visited her a Twelvemonth before he found Courage enough to tell her she was handsome  Doubtless reply'd  Arabella  he was much to be commended for his Respect A Lover should never have the Presumption to declare his Passion to his Mistress unless in certain Circumstances which may at the same Time in part disarm her Anger For Instance he must struggle with the Violence of his Passion till it has cast him into a Fever His Physicians must give him over pronouncing his Distemper incurable since the Cause of it being in his Mind all their Art is incapable of removing it Thus he must suffer rejoicing at the Approach of Death which will free him from all his Torments without violating the Respect he owes to the Divine Object of his Flame At length when he has but a few Hours to live his Mistress with many Signs of Compassion conjures him to tell her the Cause of his Despair The Lover conscious of his Crime evades all her Inquiries but the Lady laying at last a peremptory Command upon him to disclose the Secret he dares not disobey her and acknowledges his Passion with the utmost Contrition for having offended her bidding her take the small Remainder of his Life to expiate his Crime and finishes his Discourse by falling into a Swoon  The Lady is touch'd at his Condition commands him to live and if necessary permits him to hope  This is the most common Way in which such Declarations are and ought to be brought about However there are others which are as well calculated for sparing a Lady's Confusion and deprecating her Wrath  The Lover for Example like the Prince of the  Massage  es  after having buried his Passion in Silence for many Years may chance to be walking with his Confidant in a retir'd Place to whom with a Deluge of Tears he relates the Excess of his Passion and Despair And while he is thus unbosoming his Griefs not in the least suspecting he is overheard his Princess who had been listning to him in much Trouble and Confusion by some little Rustling she makes unawares discovers herself  The surpriz'd Lover throws himself at her Feet begs Pardon for his Rashness observes that he had never presum'd to discover his Passion to her and implores her Leave to die before her as a Punishment for his undesign'd Offence  The Method which the great  Artamenes  took to let the Princess of  Media  know he adored her was not less respectful This valiant Prince who had long loved her being to fight a great Battle in which he had some secret Presages he should fall which however deceiv'd him wrote a long Letter to the divine  Mandana  wherein he discover'd his Passion and the Resolution his Respect had inspir'd him with to consume in Silence and never presume to disclose his Love while he lived acquainting her that he had order'd that Letter not to be deliver'd to her till it was certainly known that he was dead  Accordingly he receiv'd several Wounds in the Fight which brought him to the Ground and his Body not being found they concluded it was in the Enemy's Possession  His faithful 'Squire who had receiv'd his Instructions before the Battle hastens to the Princess who with all the Court is mightily affected at his Death  He presents her the Letter which she makes no Scruple to receive since the Writer is no more She reads it and her whole Soul is melted with Compassion she bewails his Fate with the most tender and affectionate Marks of Grief  Her Confidant asks why she is so much affected since in all Probability she would not have pardon'd him for loving her had he been alive  She acknowledges the Truth of her Observation takes Notice that his Death having cancell'd his Crime his respectful Passion alone employs her Thoughts she is resolv'd to bewail as innocent and worthy of Compassion when dead whom living she would treat as a Criminal and insinuates that her Heart had entertain'd an Affection for him  Her Confidant treasures up this Hint and endeavours to console her but in vain till News is brought that  Artamenes  who had been carry'd for dead out of the Field and by a very surprizing Adventure conceal'd all this Time is return'd  The Princess is cover'd with Confusion and tho' glad he is alive resolves to banish him for his Crime  Her Confidant pleads his Cause so well that she consents to see him and since he can no longer conceal his Passion he confirms the Confession in his Letter humbly begging Pardon for being still alive  The Princess who cannot plead Ignorance of his Passion nor deny the Sorrow she testify'd for his Death condescends to pardon him and he is also permitted to hope In like Manner the great Prince of  Persia    Does your Ladyship consider how late it is interrupted Miss  Glanville  who had hitherto very impatiently listen'd to her Don't let us keep the Gentlemen waiting any longer for us  I must inform you how the Prince of  Persia  declar'd his Love for the incomparable  Berenice  said  Arabella  Another Time dear Cousin said Miss  Glanville  methinks we have talk'd long enough upon this Subject  I am sorry the Time has seem'd so tedious to you said  Arabella  smiling and therefore I'll trespass no longer upon your Patience Then ordering  Lucy  to bring her Hat and Gloves she went down Stairs follow'd by Miss  Glanville  who was greatly disappointed at her not putting on her Veil  CHAP XI  In which our Heroine being mistaken herself gives Oceasion for a great many other Mistakes  AS soon as the Ladies enter'd the Room Mr  Selvin  with more Gaiety than usual advanc'd towards  Arabella  who put on so cold and severe a Countenance at his Approach that the poor Man extreamly confus'd drew back and remain'd in great Perplexity fearing he had offended her  Mr  Tinsel  seeing Mr  Selvin  's Reception and aw'd by the becoming Majesty in her Person notwithstanding all his Assurance accosted her with less Confidence than was his Custom but  Arabella  softning her Looks with the most engaging Smiles made an Apology for detaining them so long from the Parade gave her Hand to the Beau as being not a suspected Person and permitted him to lead her out Mr  Glanville  to whom she always allow'd the Preference on those Occasions being a little indispos'd and not able to attend her  Mr  Tinsel  whose Vanity was greatly flatter'd by the Preference  Arabella  gave him to his Companion proceeded according to his usual Custom to examine her Looks and Behaviour with more Care conceiving such a Preference must proceed from a latent Motive which was not unfavourable for him His Discernment on these Occasions being very surprising  he soon discover'd in the bright Eyes of  Arabella  a secret Approbation of his Person which he endeavour'd to increase by displaying it with all the Address he was Master of and did not fail to talk her into an Opinion of his Wit by ridiculing every Body that pass'd them and directing several study'd Compliments to herself  Miss  Glanville  who was not so agreeably entertain'd by the grave Mr  Selvin  saw these Advances to a Gallantry with her Cousin with great Disturbance She was resolved to interrupt it if possible and being convinc'd Mr  Selvin  preferr'd  Arabella  's Conversation to hers she plotted how to pair them together and have the Beau to herself  As they walk'd a few Paces behind her Cousin and Mr  Tinsel  she was in no Danger of being overheard and taking Occasion to put Mr  Selvin  in mind of  Arabella  's Behaviour to him when he accosted her she ask'd him if he was conscious of having done any thing to offend her  I protest Madam reply'd Mr  Selvin  I know not of any thing I have done to displease her I never fail'd to my Knowledge in my Respects towards her Ladyship for whom indeed I have a most profound Veneration  I know so much of her Temper resum'd Miss  Glanville  as to be certain if she has taken it into her Head to be angry with you she will be ten times more so at your Indifference And if you hope for her Favour you must ask her Pardon with the most earnest Submission imaginable  If I knew I had offended her reply'd Mr  Selvin  I would very willingly ask her Pardon but really since I have not been guilty of any Fault towards her Ladyship I don't know how to acknowledge it  Well said Miss  Glanville  coldly I only took the Liberty to give you some friendly Advice which you may follow or not as you please I know my Cousin is angry at something and I wish you were Friends again that's all  I am mightily oblig'd to you Madam said Mr  Selvin  and since you assure me her Ladyship is angry I'll ask her Pardon tho' really as I said before I don't know for what  Well interrupted Miss  Glanville  we'll join them at the End of the Parade and to give you an Opportunity of speaking to my Cousin I'll engage Mr  Tinsel  myself  Mr  Selvin  who thought himself greatly oblig'd to Miss  Glanville  for her good Intentions tho' in reality she had a View of exposing of her Cousin as well as an Inclination to engage Mr  Tinsel  took Courage as they turn'd to get on the other Side of  Arabella  whom he had not dar'd before to approach while Miss  Glanville  addressing a Whisper of no great Importance to her Cousin parted her from the Beau and slackning her Pace a little fell into a particular Discourse with him which  Arabella  being too polite to interrupt remain'd in a very perplexing Situation dreading every Moment that Mr  Selvin  would explain himself Alarm'd at his Silence yet resolv'd to interrupt him if he began to speak and afraid of beginning a Conversation  first lest he should construe it to his Advantage  Mr  Selvin  being naturally timid in the Company of Ladies the Circumstance of Disgrace which he was in with  Arabella  her Silence and Reserve so added to his accustom'd Diffidence that tho' he endeavour'd several times to speak he was not able to bring out any thing but a preluding Hem which he observ'd to his extreme Confusion seem'd always to encrease  Arabella  's Constraint  Indeed that Lady upon any Suspicion that he was going to break his mysterious Silence always contracted her Brow into a Frown cast down her Eyes with an Air of Perplexity endeavour'd to hide her Blushes with her Fan and to shew her Inattention directed her Looks to the contrary Side  The Lady and Gentleman being in equal Confusion no Advances were made on either Side towards a Conversation and they had reach'd almost the End of the Parade in an uninterrupted Silence when Mr  Selvin  fearing he should never again have so good an Opportunity of making his Peace collected all his Resolution and with an Accent trembling under the Importance of the Speech he was going to make began  Madam Since I have had the Honour of walking with your Ladyship I have observed so many Signs of Constraint in your Manner that I hardly dare intreat you to grant me a Moment's Hearing while I  Sir interrupted  Arabella  before you go any further I must inform you that what you are  going to say will mortally offend me Take heed then how you commit an Indiscretion which will force me to treat you very rigorously  If your Ladyship will not allow me to speak in my own Justification said Mr  Selvin  yet I hope you will not refuse to tell me my Offence since I  You are very confident indeed interrupted  Arabella  again to suppose I will repeat what would be infinitely grievous for me to hear Against my Will pursued she I must give you the Satisfaction to know that I am not ignorant of your Crime but I also assure you that I am highly incens'd and that not only with the Thoughts you have dar'd to entertain of me but likewise with your Presumption in going about to disclose them  Mr  Selvin  whom the seeming Contradictions in this Speech astonish'd yet imagin'd in general it hinted at the Dispute between him and Mr  Tinsel  and supposing the Story had been told to his Disadvantage which was the Cause of her Anger reply'd in great Emotion at the Injustice done him  Since somebody has been so officious to acquaint your Ladyship with an Affair which ought to have been kept from your Knowledge 'tis a Pity they did not inform you that Mr  Tinsel  was the Person that had the least Respect for your Ladyship and is more worthy of your Resentment  If Mr  Tinsel  replied  Arabella  is guilty of an Offence like yours yet since he has conceal'd it better he is less culpable than you and you have done that for him which haply  he would never have had Courage enough to do for himself as long as he lived  Poor  Selvin  quite confounded at these intricate Words would have begg'd her to explain herself had she not silenc'd him with a dreadful Frown Aand making a Stop till Miss  Glanville  and Mr  Tinsel  came up to them She told her Cousin with a peevish Accent that she had perform'd her Promise very ill and whisper'd her that she was to blame for all the Mortifications she had suffer'd  Mr  Tinsel  supposing the Alteration in  Arabella  's Humour proceeded from being so long depriv'd of his Company endeavour'd to make her Amends by a Profusion of Compliments which she receiv'd with such an Air of Displeasure that the Beau vex'd at the ill Success of his Gallantry told her he was afraid Mr  Selvin  's Gravity had infected her Ladyship  Say rather reply'd  Arabella  that his Indiscretion has offended me  Mr  Tinsel  charm'd with this beginning Confidence which confirm'd his Hopes of having made fome Impression on her Heart conjur'd her very earnestly to tell him how Mr  Selvin  had offended her  'Tis sufficient resum'd she that I tell you he has offended me without declaring the Nature of his Crime since doubtless it has not escaped your Observation which if I may believe him is not wholly disinterested To confess yet more 'tis true that he hath told me something concerning you which  Let me perish Madam interrupted the Beau if one Syllable he has said be true  How said  Arabella  a little disconcerted Will you always persist in a Denial then  Deny it Madam return'd Mr  Tinsel  I'll deny what he has said with my last Breath 'tis all a scandalous Forgery No Man living is less likely to think of your Ladyship in that Manner If you knew my Thoughts Madam you would be convinc'd nothing is more impossible and  Sir interrupted  Arabella  extremely mortify'd methinks you are very eager in your Justification I promise you I do not think you guilty of the Offence he charg'd you with if I did you would haply experience my Resentment in such a Manner as would make you repent of your Presumption  Arabella  in finishing these Words interrupted Miss  Glanville  's Discourse with Mr  Selvin  to tell her she desir'd to return Home to which that young Lady who had not been at all pleas'd with the Morning's Walk consented  CHAP XII  In which our Heroine reconciles herself to a mortifying Incident by recollecting an Adventure in a Romance similar to her own  AS soon as the Ladies were come to their Lodgings  Arabella  went up to her own Apartment to meditate upon what had pass'd and Miss  Glanville  retir'd to dress for Dinner  while the two Gentlemen who thought they had great Reason to be dissatisfy'd with each other on Account of Lady  Bella  's Behaviour went to a Coffeehouse in order to come to some Explanation about it  Well Sir said the Beau with a sarcastick Air I am greatly oblig'd to you for the Endeavours you have us'd to ruin me in Lady  Bella  's Opinion Rat me if it is not the greatest Misfortune in the World to give occasion for Envy  Envy Sir interrupted Mr  Selvin  I protest I do really admire your great Skill in Stratagems but I do not envy you the Possession of it You have indeed very wittily contriv'd to put your own Sentiments of that Lady which you deliver'd so freely the other Night into my Mouth 'Twas a Masterpiece of Cunning indeed and as I said before I admire your Skill prodigiously  I don't know what you mean reply'd  Tinsel  y  u talk in Riddles Did you not yourself acquaint Lady  Bella  with the Preference I gave Miss  Glanville  to her What would you propose by such a Piece of Treachery You have ruin'd all my Hopes by it The Lady resents it excessively and it's no Wonder 'faith it must certainly mortify her Upon my Soul I can never forgive thee for so  mal a propos  a Discovery  Forgive me Sir replied  Selvin  in a Rage I don't want your Forgiveness I have done nothing unbecoming a Man of Honour The Lady was so prejudiced by your Insinuations that she would not give me Leave to speak  otherwise I would have fully inform'd her of her Mistake that she might have known how much she was oblig'd to you  So she would not hear thee interrupted  Tinsel  laughing dear Soul how very kind was that 'Faith I don't know how it is but I am very lucky without deserving to be so Thou art a Witness for me  Frank  I took no great Pains to gain this fine Creature's Heart but it was damn'd malicious tho' to attempt to make Discoveries I see she is a little piqu'd but I'll set all to rights again with a  Billetdoux  I've an excellent Hand tho' I say it at a  Billetdoux  I never knew one of mine fail in my Life  Harky Sir said  Selvin  whispering any more Attempts to shift your Sentiments upon me and you shall hear of it In the mean Time be assur'd I'll clear myself and put the Saddle upon the right Horse  Demme if thou art not  queer Fellow said  Tinsel  endeavouring to hide his Discomposure at this Threat under a forc'd Laugh  Selvin  without making any Reply retir'd to write to  Arabella  which  Tinsel  suspecting resolv'd to be before hand with him and without leaving the Coffeehouse call'd for Paper and wrote a Billet to her which he dispatch'd away immediately  The Messenger had just got Admittance to  Lucy  when another arriv'd from  Selvin  They both presented their Letters but  Lucy  refus'd them saying her Lady would turn her away if she receiv'd such Sort of Letters  Such Sort of Letters return'd  Tinsel  's Man Why do you know what they contain then  To be sure I do reply'd  Lucy  they are LoveLetters and my Lady has charg'd me never to receive any more  Well reply'd  Selvin  's Servant you may take my Letter for my Master desir'd me to tell you it was about Business of Consequence which your Lady must be acquainted with  Since you assure me it is not a LoveLetter I'll take it said  Lucy  And pray take mine too said  Tinsel  's  Mercury  for I assure you it is not a LoveLetter neither it's only a  Billetdoux  Are you sure of that reply'd  Lucy  because I may venture to take it I fancy if its what you say  I'll swear it said the Man delivering it to her Well said she receiving it I'll take them both up But what did you call this pursu'd she I must not forget it or else my Lady will think it a LoveLetter  A  Billetdoux  said the Man  Lucy  for fear she should forget it repeated the Words  Billetdoux  several Times as she went up Stairs but entering her Lady's Apartment she perceiving the Letters in her Hand ask'd her so sternly how she durst presume to bring them into her Presence that the poor Girl in her Fright forgot the Lesson she had been conning and endeavouring to recal it into her Memory took no Notice of her Lady's Question which she repeated several times but to no Purpose  Arabella  surpriz'd at her inattention reiterated her Commands in a Tone somewhat  louder than usual asking her at the same Time why she did not obey her immediately  Indeed Madam reply'd  Lucy  your Ladyship would not order me to take back the Letters if you knew what they were They are not LoveLetters I was resolv'd to be sure of that before I took them This Madam is a Letter about Business of Consequence and the otherOh dear I can't think what the Man call'd it But it is not a LoveLetter indeed Madam  You are a simple Wench said  Arabella  smiling You may depend upon it all Letters directed to me must contain Matters of Love and Gallantry and those I am not permitted to receive Take them away then immediately But stay pursued she seeing she was about to obey her one of them you say was deliver'd to you as a Letter of Consequence perhaps i  is so Indeed it may contain an Advertisement of some Design to carry me away How do I know but Mr  Selvin  incited by his Love and Despair may intend to make such an Attempt Give me that Letter  Lucy  I am resolved to open it As for the otheryet who knows but the other may also bring me Warning of the same Danger from another Quarter The Pains Mr  Tinsel  took to conceal his Passion nay almost as I think to deny it amounts to a Proof that he is meditating some Way to make sure of me 'Tis certainly so Give me that Letter  Lucy  I should be accessary to their intended Violence if I neglected this timely Discovery  Well cried she taking one of the Letters this is exactly like what happen'd to the beautiful Princess of  Cappadocia  who like me in one and the same Day receiv'd Advice that two of her Lovers intended to carry her off  As she pronounc'd these Words Miss  Glanville  enter'd the Room to whom  Arabella  immediately recounted the Adventure of the Letters telling her she did not doubt but they contain'd a Discovery of some Conspiracy to carry her away  And whom does your Ladyship suspect of such a strange Design pray said Miss  Glanville  smiling  At present reply'd  Arabella  the two Cavaliers who walk'd with us to Day are the Persons who seem the most likely to attempt that Violence  I dare answer for Mr  Tinsel  replied Miss  Glanville  he thinks of no such Thing  Well said  Arabella  to convince you of your Mistake I must inform you that Mr  Selvin  having the Presumption to begin a Declaration of Love to me on the Parade this Morning I reprov'd him severely for his Want of Respect and threatned him with my Displeasure in the Rage of his Jealousy at seeing me treat Mr  Tinsel  well he discover'd to me that he also was as criminal as himself in order to oblige me to a severer Usage of him  So he told you Mr  Tinsel  was in Love with you interrupted Miss  Glanville  He told it me in other Words reply'd  Arabella  for he said Mr  Tinsel  was guilty of that Offence which I resented so severely to him  Miss  Glanville  beginning to comprehend the Mystery with great Difficulty forbore laughing at her Cousin's Mistake for she well knew the Offence Mr  Selvin  hinted at and desirous of knowing what those Letters contain'd she begg'd her to delay opening them no longer  Arabella  pleas'd at her Solicitude open'd one of the Letters but glancing her Eye to the Bottom and seeing the Name of  Selvin  she threw it hastily upon the Table and averting her Eyes What a Mortification have I avoided said she that Letter is from  Selvin  and questionless contains an Avowal of his Crime  Nay you must read it cried Miss  Glanville  taking it up since you have open'd it its the same Thing You can never persuade him but you have seen it However to spare your Nicety I'll read it to you Which accordingly she did and found it as follows  MADAM  I Knows not what Insinuations have been made use of to persuade you I was guilty of the Offence which with Justice occasion'd your Resentment this Morning but I assure you nothing was ever more false My Thoughts of your Ladyship are very different and full of the profoundest Respect and Veneration I have Reason to suspect Mr  Tinsel  is the Person who has thus endeavoured to prejudice me with your Ladyship therefore I am excusable if I tell you that those very Sentiments too disrespectful to be named which he would persuade  you are mine he discover'd himself He then Madam is the Person guilty of that Offence he so falsly lays to the Charge of him who is with the utmost Respect and Esteem  Madam  Your Ladyship's most obedient and most humble Servant F SELVIN  How's this cry'd Miss  Glanville  Why Madam you are certainly mistaken You see Mr  Selvin  utterly denies the Crime of loving you He has suffer'd very innocently in your Opinion Indeed your Ladyship was too hasty in condemning him  If what he says be true replied  Arabella  who had been in extream Confusion while a Letter so different from what she expected was reading I have indeed unjustly condemn'd him Nevertheless I am still inclin'd to believe this is all Artifice and that he is really guilty of entertaining a Passion for me  But why should he take so much Pains to deny it Madam said Miss  Glanville  Methinks that looks very odd  Not at all interrupted  Arabella  whose Spirits were rais'd by recollecting an Adventure in her Romance similar to this Mr  Selvin  has fallen upon the very same Stratagem with  Seramenes  who being in Love with the beautiful  Cleobuline  Princess of  Corinth  took all imaginable Pains to conceal his Passion in order  to be near that fair Princess who would have banish'd him from her Presence had she known he was in Love with her Nay he went so far in his Dissimulation as to pretend Love to one of the Ladies of her Court that his Passion for the Princess might be the less taken notice of In these Cases therefore the more resolutely a Man denies his Passion the more pure and violent it is  Then Mr  Selvin  's Passion is certainly very violent reply'd Miss  Glanville  for he denies it very resolutely and I believe none but your Ladyship would have discover'd his Artifice But shall we not open the other Letter I have a strong Notion it comes from  Tinsel  For that very Reason I would not be acquainted with the Contents reply'd  Arabella  You see Mr  Selvin  accuses him of being guilty of that Offence which he denies I shall doubtless meet with a Confirmation of his Love in that Letter Do not I beseech you added she seeing her Cousin preparing to open the Letter expose me to the Pain of hearing a presumptuous Declaration of Love Nay pursued she rising in great Emotion if you are resolved to persecute me by reading it I'll endeavour to get out of the hearing of it  You shan't I declare said Miss  Glanville  laughing and holding her I'll oblige you to hear it  I vow Cousin said  Arabella  smiling you use me just as the Princess  Cleopatra  did the fair and wise  Antonia  However if by this you mean to do any Kindness to the unfortunate Person who wrote that Billet you are greatly  mistaken since if you oblige me to listen to a Declaration of his Crime you will lay me under a Necessity to banish him A Sentence he would have avoided while I remained ignorant of it  To this Miss  Glanville  made no other Reply than by opening the Billet the Contents of which may be found in the following Chapter  CHAP XIII  In which our Heroin's Extravagance will be thought perhaps to be carried to an extravagant Length  MADAM  I Had the Honour to assure you this Morning on the Parade that the Insinuations Mr  Selvin  made use of to rob me of the superlative Happiness of your Esteem were entirely false and groundless May the Beams of your bright Eyes never shine on me more if there is any Truth in what he said to prejudice me with your Ladyship If I am permitted to attend you to the Rooms this Evening I hope to convince you that it was absolutely impossible I could have been capable of such a Crime who am with the most profound Respect  Your Ladyship's most devoted  c  D TINSEL  Well Madam said Miss  Glanville  when she had read this Epistle I fancy you need not pronounce a Sentence of Banishment upon poor Mr  Tinsel  he seems to be quite innocent of the Offence your Ladyship suspects him of  Why really return'd  Arabella  blushing with extreme Confusion at this second Disappointment I am greatly perplex'd to know how I ought to act on this Occasion I am much in the same Situation with the Princess  Serena  For you must know this Princess Here  Lucy  entering inform'd the Ladies Dinner was serv'dI shall defer till another Opportunity said  Arabella  upon this Interruption the Relation of the Princess  Serena  's Adventures which you will find added she in a low Voice bears a very great Resemblance to mine  Miss  Glanville  reply'd she would hear it whenever she pleas'd and then follow'd  Arabella  to the Dining Room  The Cloth was scarce remov'd when Mr  Selvin  came in  Arabella  blush'd at his Appearance and discover'd so much Perplexity in her Behaviour that Mr  Selvin  was apprehensive he had not yet sufficiently justify'd himself and therefore took the first Opportunity to approach her  I shall think myself very unhappy Madam said he bowing if the Letter I did myself the Honour to write to you this Morning  Sir interrupted  Arabella  I perceive you are going to forget the Contents of that Letter and preparing again to offend me by a presumptuous Declaration of Love  Who I Madam reply'd he in great Astonishment and Confusion III protesttho' II have a very great Respect for your Ladyship yetyet I never presum'd tototo  You have presum'd too much replied  Arabella  and I should forget what I ow'd to my own Glory if I furnish'd you with any more Occasions of offending meKnow then I absolutely forbid you to appear before me again at least till I am convinc'd you have chang'd your Sentiments  Saying this she rose from her Seat and making a Sign to him not to follow her which indeed he had no Intention to do she quitted the Room highly satisfy'd with her own Conduct upon this Occasion which was exactly conformable to the Laws of Romance  Mr  Tinsel  who had just alighted from his Chair having a Glimpse of her as she pass'd to her own Apartment resolv'd if possible to procure a private Interview for he did not doubt but his Billet had done Wonders in his Favour  For that Purpose he ventur'd up to her AntiChamber where he found  Lucy  in waiting whom he desir'd to acquaint her Lady that he intreated a Moment's Speech with her  Lucy  after hesitating a Moment and looking earnestly at him replied Sir if you'll promise me faithfully you are not in Love with my Lady I'll go and deliver your Message  Duce take me said  Tinsel  if that is not a very whimsical Condition trulyPray my Dear how came it into thy little Brain to  suspect I was in Love with thy Lady But suppose I should be in Love with her what then  Why then its likely you would die that's all said  Lucy  without my Lady would be so kind to command you to live  I vow thou hast mighty pretty Notions Child said  Tinsel  smiling hast thou been reading any PlayBook lately But pray dost think thy Lady would have compassion on me if I was in Love with her Come I know thou art in her Confidence Hast thou ever heard her talk of me Does she not tell thee all her Secrets  Here  Arabella  's Bell ringing the Beau slipp'd half a Guinea into her Hand which  Lucy  not willing to refuse went immediately to her Lady to whom with a trembling Accent she repeated Mr  Tinsel  's Request  Imprudent Girl cried  Arabella  for I am loth to suspect thee of Disloyalty to thy Mistress Dost thou know the Nature and Extent of the Request thou hast deliver'd Art thou ignorant that the presumptuous Man whom thou sollicitest this Favour for has mortally offended me  Indeed Madam said  Lucy  frighted out of her Wits I don't sollicit for him I scorn to do any such Thing I would not offend your Ladyship for the World For before I would deliver his Message to your Ladyship I made him assure me that he was not in Love with your Ladyship  That was very wisely done indeed replied  Arabella  smiling And do you believe he spoke the Truth  Yes indeed I am sure of it said  Lucy  eagerly if your Ladyship will but be pleas'd to see him he is only in the next Room I dare promise  How interrupted  Arabella  What have you done Have you brought him into my Apartment then I protest this Adventure is exactly like what befel the beautiful  Statira  when by a Stratagem of the same Kind  Oroondates  was introduc'd into her Presence  Lucy  thou art another  Barsina  I think but I hope thy Intentions are not less innocent than hers was  Indeed Madam reply'd  Lucy  excessively uneasy at her Lady's Words I am very innocent I am no  Barsina  as your Ladyship calls me  I dare answer for thee said  Arabella  smiling at the Turn she gave to her Words thou art no  Barsina  and I should wrong thee very much to compare thee with that wise Princess for thou art certainly one of the most simple Wenches in the World But since thou hast gone so far let me know what the unfortunate Person desires of me for since I am neither more rigid nor pretend to more Virtue than  Statira  I may do at least as much for him as that great Queen did for  Oroondates  He desires Madam said  Lucy  that your Ladyship would be pleas'd to let him speak with you  Or in his Words I suppose replied  Arabella  he humbly implor'd a Moment's Audience  I told your Ladyship his very Words indeed Madam said  Lucy  I tell thee Girl thou art mistaken said  Arabella  'tis impossible he should sue for such a Favour in Terms like those Therefore go back and let him know that I consent to grant him a short Audience upon these Conditions  First Provided he does not abuse my Indulgence by offending me with any Protestations of his Passion  Secondly That he engages to fulfil the Injunctions I shall lay upon him however cruel and terrible they may appear  Lastly That his Despair must not prompt him to any Act of Desperation against himself  Lucy  having received this Message quitted the Room hastily for fear she should forget it  Well my pretty Ambassadress said  Tinsel  when he saw her enter the AntiChamber Will your Lady see me  No Sir replied  Lucy  No interrupted  Tinsel  that's kind 'faith after waiting so long  Pray Sir said  Lucy  don't put me out so I shall forget what my Lady order'd me to tell you  Oh I ask your Pardon Child said  Tinsel  Come let me hear your Message  Sir said  Lucy  adapting the Solemnity of her Lady's AccentMy Lady bad me say that she will grantNo that she consents to grant you a short Dience  Audience you would say Child said  Tinsel  But how came you to tell me before she would not see me  I vow and protest Sir said  Lucy  you have put all my Lady's Words clean out of my HeadI don't know what comes next  Oh no matter said  Tinsel  you have told me enough I'll wait upon her directly  Lucy  who saw him making towards the Door prest between it and him and having all her Lady's Whims in her Head suppos'd he was going to carry her awayPossess'd with this Thought she scream'd out Help Help for Heaven's Sake My Lady willl be carry'd away  Arabella  hearing this Exclamation of her Woman's eccho'd her Screams tho' with a Voice infinitely more delicate and seeing  Tinsel  who confounded to the last Degree at the Cries of both the Lady and her Woman had got into her Chamber he knew not how she gave herself over for lost and fell back in her Chair in a Swoon or something she took for a Swoon for she was persuaded it could happen no otherwise since all Ladies in the same Circumstances arr terrify'd into a fainting Fit and seldom recover till they are conveniently carried away and when they awake find themselves many Miles off in the Power of their Ravisher  Arabella  's other Women alarm'd by her Cries came running into the Room and seeing Mr  Tinsel  there and their Lady ia a Swoon concluded some very extraordinary Accident had happen'd  What is your Business here cry'd they all at a Time Is it you that has frighted her Ladyship  Devil take me said  Tinsel  amaz'd if I can tell what all this means  By this Time Sir  Charles  Mr  Glanville  and his Sister came running astonish'd up Stairs  Arabella  still continu'd motionless in her Chair her Eyes clos'd and her Head reclin'd upon  Lucy  who with her other Women was endeavouring to recover her  Mr  Glanville  eagerly ran to her Assistance while Sir  Charles  and his Daughter as eagerly interrogated Mr  Tinsel  who stood motionless with Surprize concerning the Cause of her Disorder  Arabella  then first discovering some Signs of Life half open'd her Eyes  Inhuman Wretch cry'd she with a faint Voice supposing herself in the Hands of her Ravisher think not thy cruel Violence shall procure thee what thy Submissions could not obtain and if when thou hadst only my Indifference to surmount thou didst find it so difficult to overcome my Resolution now that by this unjust Attempt thou hast added Aversion to that Indifference never hope for any Thing but the most bitter Reproaches from me  Why Niece said Sir  Charles  approaching her what's the Matter Look up I beseech you nobody is attempting to do you any Hurt here's none but Friends about you  Arabella  raising her Head at the Sound of her Uncle's Voice and casting a confus'd Look on the Persons about her  May I believe my Senses Am I rescu'd and in my own Chamber To whose Valour is my Deliverance owing Without  doubt 'tis to my Cousin's but where is he Let me assure him of my Gratitude  Mr  Glanville  who had retir'd to a Window in great Confusion as soon as he heard her call for him came towards her and in a Whisper begg'd her to be compos'd that she was in no Danger  And pray Niece said Sir  Charles  now you are a little recover'd be so good to inform us of the Cause of your Fright What has happen'd to occasion all this Confusion  How Sir said  Arabella  don't you know then what has happen'dPray how was I brought again into my Chamber and by what Means was I rescu'd  I protest said Sir  Charles  I don't know that you have been out of it  Alas replied  Arabella  I perceive you are quite ignorant of what has befallen me nor am I able to give you any Information All I can tell you is that alarm'd by my Womens Cries and the Sight of my Ravisher who came into my Chamber I fainted away and so faciliated his Enterprize since doubtless it was very easy for him to carry me away while I remain'd in that senseless Condition How I was rescu'd or by whom one of my Women can haply inform you since its probable one of them was also forc'd away with meOh Heav'ns cry'd she seeing  Tinsel  who all this while stood gazing like one distracted what makes that impious Man in my Presence What am I to think of this Am I really deliver'd or no  What can this mean cried Sir  Charles  turning to  Tinsel  Have you Sir had any Hand in frighting my Niece  I Sir said  Tinsel  Let me perish if ever I was so confounded in my Life The Lady's Brain is disorder'd I believe  Mr  Glanville  who was convinc'd all this Confusion was caus'd by some of  Arabella  's usual Whims dreaded lest an Explanation would the more expose her and therefore told his Father that it would be best to retire and leave his Cousin to the Care of his Sister and her Women adding that she was not yet quite recover'd and their Presence did but discompose her  Then addressing himself to  Tinsel  told him he would wait upon him down Stairs  Arabella  seeing them going away together and supposing they intended to dispute the Possession of her with their Swords call'd out to them to stay  Mr  Glanville  however without minding her press'd Mr  Tinsel  to walk down  Nay pray Sir said the Beau let us go in again she may grow outrageous if we disoblige her  Outrageous Sir said  Glanville  do you suppose my Cousin is mad  Upon my Soul Sir replied  Tinsel  if she is not mad she is certainly a little out of her Senses or so  Arabella  having reiterated her Commands for her Lovers to return and finding they did not obey her ran to her Chamberdoor where they were holding a surly Sort of Conference especially  on  Glanville  's Side who was horridly out of Humour  I perceive by your Looks said  Arabella  to her Cousin the Design you are meditating but know that I absolutely forbid you by all the Power I have over you not to engage in Combat with my Ravisher here  Madam interrupted  Glanville  I beseech you do not  I know said she you will object to me the Examples of  Artamenes Aronces  and many others who were so generous as to promise their Rivals not to refuse them that Satisfaction whenever they demanded itbut consider you have not the same Obligations to Mr  Tinsel  that  Artamenes  had to the King of  Assyria  or that  Arances  had to  For God's Sake Cousin said  Glanville  what's all this to the Purpose Curse on  Aronces  and the King of  Assyria  I say  The Astonishment of  Arabella  at this intemperate Speech of her Cousin kept her for a Moment immoveable when Sir  Charles  who during this Discourse had been collecting all the Information he could from  Lucy  concerning this perplex'd Affair came towards  Tinsel  and giving him an angry Look told him He should take it well if he forbore visiting any of his Family for the future  Oh Your most obedient Servant Sir said  Tinsel  You expect I suppose I should be excessively chagrin'd at this Prohibition But upon my Soul I am greatly oblig'd to you Agad I have no great Mind to a Halter And since this Lady is so apt to think People have a Design  to ravish her the wisest Thing a Man can do is to keep out of her Way  Sir replied  Glanville  who had follow'd him to the Door I believe there was been some little Mistake in what has happen'd TodayHowever I expect you'll take no unbecoming Liberties with the Character of Lady  Bella    Oh Sir said  Tinsel  I give you my Honour I shall always speak of the Lady with the most profound Veneration She is a most accomplish'd incomprehensible Lady And the Devil take me if I think there is her Fellow in the WorldAnd so Sir I am your most obedient  A Word with you before you go said  Glanville  stopping himNo more of these Sneers as you value that smooth Face of yours or I'll despoil it of a Nose  Oh Your humble Servant said the Beau retiring in great Confusion with something betwixt a Smile and a Grin upon his Countenance which he took Care however Mr  Glanville  should not see who as soon as he quitted him went again to  Arabella  's Apartment in order to prevail upon his Father and Sister to leave her a little to herself for he dreaded lest some more Instances of her Extravagance would put it into his Father's Head that she was really out of her Senses  Well Sir said  Arabella  upon his Entrance you have I suppose given your Rival his Liberty I assure you this Generosity is highly agreeable to meAnd herein you imitate the noble  Artamenes  who upon a like Occasion acted as you have done For when Fortune  had put the Ravisher of  Mandana  in his Power and he became the Vanquisher of his Rival who endeavour'd by Violence to possess that divine Princess this truly generous Hero relinquish'd the Right he had of disposing of his Prisoner and instead of sacrificing his Life to his just and reasonable Vengeance he gave a Proof of his admirable Virtue and Clemency by dismissing him in Safety as you have done However added she I hope you have made him swear upon your Sword that he will never make a second Attempt upon my Liberty I perceive pursued she seeing Mr  Glanville  continued silent with his Eyes bent on the Ground for indeed he was asham'd to look up that you would willingly avoid the Praise due to the heroick Action you have just perform'd Nay I suppose you are resolv'd to keep it secret if possible yet I must tell you that you will not escape the Glory due to it Glory is as necessarily the Result of a virtuous Action as Light is an Effect of the Sun which causeth it and has no Dependence on any other Cause since a virtuous Action continues still the same tho' it be done without Testimony and Glory which is as one may say born with it constantly attends it tho' the Action be not known  I protest Niece said Sir  Charles  that's very prettily said  In my Opinion Sir pursued  Arabella  if any thing can weaken the Glory of a good Action its the Care a Person takes to make it known As if one did not do Good for the Sake of Good but for the Praise that generally follows it Those then that are govern'd by  so interested a Motive ought to be consider'd as sordid rather than generous Persons who making a Kind of Traffick between Virtue and Glory barter just so much of the one for the other and expect like other Merchants to make Advantage by the Exchange  Mr  Glanville  who was charm'd into an Extacy at this sensible Speech of  Arabella  's forgot in an Instant all her Absurdities He did not fail to express his Admiration of her Understanding in Terms that brought a Blush into her fair Face and oblig'd her to lay her Commands upon him to cease his excessive Commendations Then making a Sign to them to leave her alone Mr  Glanville  who understood her took his Father and Sister down Stairs leaving  Arabella  with her faithful  Lucy  whom she immediately commanded to give her a Relation of what had happen'd to her from the Time of her swooning till she recover'd  CHAP XIV  A Dialogue between Arabella and Lucy in which the latter seems to have the Advantage  WHY Madam said  Lucy  all I can tell your Ladyship is that we were all excessively frighted to be sure when you fainted especially myself and that we did what we could to recover youAnd so accordingly your Ladyship did recover  What's this to the Purpose said  Arabella  perceiving she stop'd here I know that I fainted and 'tis also very plain that I recover'd againI ask you what happen'd to me in the intermediate Time between my Fainting and Recovery Give me a faithful Relation of all the Accidents to which by my Fainting I am quite a Stranger and which no doubt are very considerable  Indeed Madam replied  Lucy  I have given your Ladyship a faithful Relation of all I can remember  When resum'd  Arabella  surpiz'd  This Moment Madam said  Lucy  Why sure thou dream'st Wench replied she Hast thou told me how I was seiz'd and carry'd off How I was rescu'd again And  No indeed Madam interrupted  Lucy  I don't dream I never told your Ladyship that you was carry'd off  Well said  Arabella  and why dost thou not satisfy my Curiosity Is it not fit I should be acquainted with such a momentous Part of my History  I can't indeed and please your Ladyship said  Lucy  What can'st thou not said  Arabella  enrag'd at her Stupidity as she thought it  Why Madam said  Lucy  sobbing I can't make a History of nothing  Of nothing Wench resum'd  Arabella  in a greater Rage than before Dost thou call an Adventure to which thou was a Witness and borest haply so great a Share in nothingAn Adventure which hereafter will make a considerable  Figure in the Relation of my Life dost thou look upon as trisling and of no Consequence  No indeed I don't Madam said  Lucy  Why then pursued  Arabella  dost thou wilfully neglect to relate it Suppose as there is nothing more likely thou wert commanded by some Persons of considerable Quality or haply some great Princes and Princesses to recount the Adventures of my Life would'st thou omit a Circumstance of so much Moment  No indeed Madam said  Lucy  I am glad to hear thou art so discreet said  Arabella  and pray do me the Favour to relate this Adventure to me as thou would'st do to those Princes and Princesses if thou wert commanded  Here  Arabella  making a full Stop fix'd her Eyes upon her Woman expecting every Moment she would begin the desir'd Narrative But finding she continu'd silent longer than she thought was necessary for recalling the several Circumstances of the Story into her Mind  I find said she it will be necessary to caution you against making your Audience wait too long for your Relation it looks as if you was to make a studied Speech not a simple Relation of Facts which ought to be free from all Affectation of Labour and Art and be told with that graceful Negligence which is so becoming to Truth  This I thought proper to tell you added she that you may not fall into that Mistake when you are called upon to relate my Adventures Well now if you please to begin  What pray Madam said  Lucy  What repeated  Arabella  Why the Adventures which happen'd to me so lately Relate to me every Circumstance of my being carried away and how my Deliverance was effected by my Cousin  Indeed Madam said  Lucy  I know nothing about your Ladyship's being carried away All I know is  Begone cried  Arabella  losing all Patience at her Obstinacy get out of my Presence this Moment Wretch unworthy of my Confidence and Favour thy Treason is too manifest thou art brib'd by that presumptuous Man to conceal all the Circumstances of his Attempt from my Knowleddge to the End that I may not have a full Conviction of his Guilt  Lucy  who never saw her Lady so much offended before and knew not the Occasion of it burst into Tears which so affected the tender Heart of  Arabella  that losing insensibly all her Anger she told her with a Voice soften'd to a Tone of the utmost Sweetness and Condescension that provided she would confess how far she had been prevail'd upon by his rich Presents to forget her Duty she would pardon and receive her again into Favour  Speak added she and be not afraid after this Promise to let me know what Mr  Tinsel  requir'd of thee and what were the Gifts with which he purchas'd thy Services doubtless he presented thee with Jewels of a considerable Value  Since your Ladyship said  Lucy  sobbing has promis'd not to be angry I don't care if I do  tell your Ladyship what he gave me He gave me this half Guinea Madam indeed he did but for all that when he would come into your Chamber I struggled with him and cry'd out for fear he should carry your Ladyship away  Arabella  lost in Astonishment and Shame at hearing of so inconsiderable a Present made to her Woman the like of which not one of her Romances could furnish her order'd her immediately to withdraw not being willing she should observe the Confusion this strange Bribe had given her  After she had been gone some Time she endeavour'd to compose her Looks and went down to the DiningRoom where Sir  Charles  and his Son and Daughter had been engag'd in a Conversation concerning her the Particulars of which may be found in the first Chapter of the next Book  The  End  of the  Seventh BOOK  THE Female QUIXOTE BOOK VIII  CHAP I  Contains the Conversation referr'd to in the last Chapter of the preceding Book  _MISS  Glanville  who with a malicious Pleasure had secretly triumph'd in the Extravagances her beautiful Cousin had been guilty of was now sensibly disappointed to find they had had so little Effect on her Father and Brother for instead of reflecting upon the Absurdities to which they had been a Witness Mr  Glanville  artfully pursu'd the Subject  Arabella  just before had been expatiating upon taking notice frequently of some Observations of hers and  by a well contriv'd Repetition of her Words oblig'd his Father a second Time to declare that his Niece had spoken extremely well  Mr  Glanville  taking the Word launch'd out into such Praises of her Wit that Miss  Glanville  no longer able to listen patiently reply'd  'Twas true Lady  Bella  sometimes said very sensible Things that 'twas a great Pity she was not always in a reasonable Way of thinking or that her Intervals were not longer  Her Intervals Miss said  Glanville  pray what do you mean by that Expression  Why pray said Miss  Glanville  don't you think my Cousin is sometimes a little wrong in the Head  Mr  Glanville  at these Words starting from his Chair took a Turn across the Room in great Discomposure then stopping all of a sudden and giving his Sister a furious Look  Charlotte  said he don't give me Cause to think you are envious of your Cousin's superior Excellencies  Envious repeated Miss  Glanville  I envious of my CousinI vow I sh  uld never have thought of thatIndeed Brother you are much mistaken my Cousin's superior Excellencies never gave me a Moment's Disturbance Tho' I must confess her unaccountable Whims have often excited my Pity  No more of this  Charlotte  interrupted Mr  Glanville  as you value my Friendship No more of it  Why really Son said Sir  Charles  my Niece has very strange Whimsies sometimes How it came into her Head to think Mr  Tinsel  would  attempt to carry her away I can't imagine For after all he only prest rather too rudely into her Chamber for which as you see I have ferbidden his Visits  That was of a Piece said Miss  Glanville  sneeringly to her Brother with her asking you if you had made Mr  Tinsel  swear upon your Sword that he would never again attempt to carry her away and applauding you for having given him his Liberty as the generous  Atermens  did on the same Occasion  I would advise you  Charlotte  said Mr  Glanville  not to aim at repeating your Cousins's Words till you know how to pronounce them properly  Oh that's one of her superior Excellencies said Miss  Glanville  Indeed Miss said  Glanville  very provokingly she is superior to you in many Things and as much so in the Goodness of her Heart as in the Beauty of her Person  Come come  Charles  said the Baronet who observ'd his Daughter sat swelling and biting her Lip at this Reproach personal Reflections are better avoided Your Sister is very well and not to be disparag'd tho' to be sure Lady  Bella  is the finest Woman I ever saw in my Life  Miss  Glanville  was if possible more disgusted at her Father's Palliation than her Brother's Reproaches and in order to give a Loose to her Passion accus'd Mr  Glanville  of a Decrease in his Affection for her since he had been in Love with her Cousin and having found this Excuse for her Tears very freely gave vent to them  Mr  Glanville  being softned by this Sight sacrificed a few Compliments to her Vanity which soon restor'd her to her usual Tranquillity then turning the Discourse on his beloved  Arabella  pronounc'd a Panegyrick on her Virtues and Accomplishments of an Hour long which if it did not absolutely persuade his Sister to change her Opinion it certainly convinc'd his Father that his Niece was not only perfectly well in her Understanding but even better than most others of her Sex  Mr  Glanville  had just finish'd her Eulogium when  Arabella  appear'd Joy danc'd in his Eyes at her Approach he gaz'd upon her with a Kind of conscious Triumph in his Looks her consummate Loveliness justifying his Passion and being in his Opinion more than an Excuse for all her Extravagancies  CHAP II  In which our Heroine as we presume shews herself in two very different Lights  ARABELLA  who at her Entrance had perceiv'd some Traces of Uneasiness upon Miss  Glanville  's Countenance tenderly ask'd her the Cause to which that young Lady answering in a cold and reserv'd Manner Mr  Glanville  to divert her Reflexions on it very freely accus'd himself of having given his Sister some Offence To be sure Brother said Miss  Glanville  you are very vehement in your Temper and are as violently carry'd away about Things of little Importance as of the greatest and then whatever you have a Fancy for you love so obstinately  I am oblig'd to you Miss interrupted Mr  Glanville  for endeavouring to give Lady  Bella  so unfavourable an Opinion of me  I assure you said  Arabella  Miss  Glanville  has said nothing to your Disadvantage For in my Opinion the Temperament of great Minds ought to be such as she represents yours to be For there is nothing at so great a Distance from true and heroick Virtue as that Indifference which obliges some People to be pleas'd with all Things or nothing Whence it comes to pass that they neither entertain great Desires of Glory nor Fear of Infamy that they neither love nor hate that they are wholly influenc'd by Custom and are sensible only of the Afflictions of the Body their Minds being in a Manner insensible  To say the Truth I am inclin'd to conceive a greater Hope of a Man who in the Beginning of his Life is hurry'd away by some evil Habit than one that fastens on nothing The Mind that cannot be brought to detest Vice will never be persuaded to love Virtue but one who is capable of loving or hating irreconcilebly by having when young his Passions directed to proper Objects will remain fix'd in his Choice of what is good But with him who is incapable of any violent Attraction and whose Heart is chilled by a general Indifference Precept or Example will have no Force  And Philosophy itself which boasts it hath Remedies for all Indispositions of the Soul never had any that can cure an indifferent Mind Nay added she I am persuaded that Indifference is generally the inseparable Companion of a weak and imperfect Judgment For it is so natural to a Person to be carry'd towards that which he believes to be good that if indifferent People were able to judge of Things they would fasten on something But certain it is that this lukewarmness of Soul which sends sorth but seeble Desires sends also but feeble Lights so that those who are guilty of it not knowing any thing clearly cannot fasten on any thing with Perseverance  Mr  Glanville  when  Arabella  had finish'd this Speech cast a triumphing Glance at his Sister who had affected great Inattention all the while she had been speaking Sir  Charles  in his Way express'd much Admiration of her Wit telling her if she had been a Man she would have made a great Figure in Parliament and that her Speeches might have come perhaps to be printed in time  This Compliment odd as it was gave great Joy to  Glanville  when the Conversation was interrupted by the Arrival of Mr  Selvin  who had slipt away unobserv'd at the Time that  Arabella  's Indisposition had alarm'd them and now came to enquire after her Health and also if an Opportunity offer'd to set her right with Regard to the Suspicions she had entertain'd of his designing to pay his Addresses to her  Arabella  as soon as he had sent in his Name appear'd to be in great Disturbance and upon  his Entrance offer'd immediately to withdraw telling Mr  Glanville  who would have detain'd her that she found no Place was likely to secure her from the Persecutions of that Gentleman  Glanville  star'd and look'd strangely perplex'd at this Speech Miss  Glanville  smil'd and poor  Selvin  with a very silly Lookhem'd two or three times and then with a faultring Accent said Madam I am very much concern'd to find your Ladyship resolv'd to persist in  Sir interrupted  Arabella  my Resolutions are unalterable I told you so before and am surpriz'd after the Knowledge of my Intentions you presume to appear in my Presence again from whence I had so positively banish'd you  Pray Niece said Sir  Charles  what has Mr  Selvin  done to disoblige you  Sir reply'd  Arabella  Mr  Selvin  's Offence can admit of no other Reparation than that which I requir'd of him which was a voluntary Banishment from my Presence And in this pursu'd she I am guilty of no more Severity to you than the Princess  Udosia  was to the unfortunate  Thrasimedes  For the Passion of this Prince having come to her Knowledge notwithstanding the Pains he took to conceal it this fair and wise Princess thought it not enough to forbid his speaking to her but also banish'd him from her Presence laying a peremptory Command upon him never to appear before her again till he was perfectly cur'd of that unhappy Love he had entertain'd for herImitate  therefore the meritorious Obedience of this poor Prince and if that Passion you profess for me  How Sir interrupted Sir  Charles  Do you make Love to my Niece then  Sir replied Mr  Selvin  who was strangely confounded at  Arabella  's Speech tho' I really admire the Perfections this Lady is possess'd of yet I assure you upon my Honour I never had a Thought of making any Addresses to her and I can't imagine why her Ladyship persists in accusing me of such Presumption  So formal a Denial after what  Arabella  had said extremely perplex'd Sir  Charles  and fill'd Mr  Glanville  with inconceivable Shame  Miss  Glanville  enjoy'd their Disturbance and full of an illnatur'd Triumph endeavour'd to look  Arabella  into Confusion But that Lady not being at all discompos'd by this Declaration of Mr  Selvin  's having accounted for it already replied with great Calmness  Sir 'Tis easy to see thro' the Artifice of your disclaiming any Passion for meUpon any other Occasion questionless you would rather sacrifice your Life than consent to disavow these Sentiments which unhappily for your Peace you have entertain'd At present the Desire of continuing near me obliges you to lay this Constraint upon yourself however you know  Thrasimedes  fell upon the same Stratagem to no Purpose The rigid  Udosia  saw thro' the Disguise and would not dispense with herself from banishing him from  Rome  as I do you from  England    How Madam interrupted  Selvin  amaz'd  Yes Sir replied  Arabella  hastily nothing less can satisfy what I owe to the Consideration of my own Glory  Upon my Word Madam said  Selvin  half angry and yet strongly inclin'd to laugh I don't see the Necessity of my quitting my native Country to satisfy what you owe to the Consideration of your own Glory Pray how does my staying in  England  affect your Ladyship's Glory  To answer your Question with another said  Arabella  Pray how did the Stay of  Thrasimedes  in  Rome  affect the Glory of the Empress  Udosia  Mr  Selvin  was struck dumb with this Speech for he was not willing to be thought so deficient in the Knowledge of History as not to be acquainted with the Reasons why  Thrasimedes  should not stay in  Rome  His Silence therefore seeming to  Arabella  to be a tacit Confession of the Justice of her Commands a Sentiment of Compassion for this unfortunate Lover intruded itself into her Mind and turning her bright Eyes full of a soft Complacency upon  Selvin  who star'd at her as if he had lost his Wits  I will not said she wrong the Sublimity of your Passion for me so much as to doubt your being ready to sacrifice the Repose of your own Life to the Satisfaction of mine Nor will I do so much Injustice to your Generosity as to suppose the Glory of obeying my Commands will not in some Measure soften the Rigour of your DestinyI know not whether it may be lawful for me to tell you that your Misfortune  does really cause me some Affliction but I am willing to give you this Consolation and also to assure you that to whatever Part of the World your Despair will carry you the good Wishes and Compassion of  Arabella  shall follow you  Having said this with one of her fair Hands she cover'd her Face to hide the Blushes which so compassionate a Speech had caus'dHolding the other extended with a careless Air supposing he would kneel to kiss it and bathe it with his Tears as was the Custom on such melancholy Occasions her Head at the samÃ¨ Time turned another Way as if reluctantly and with Confusion she granted this Favour But after standing a Moment in this Posture and finding her Hand untouch'd she concluded Grief had depriv'd him of his Senses and that he would shortly fall into a Swoon as  Thrasimedes  did And to prevent being a Witness of so doleful a Sight she hurry'd out of the Room without once turning about and having reach'd her own Apartment sunk into a Chair not a little affected with the deplorable Condition in which she had left her suppos'd miserable Lover  CHAP III  The Contrast continued  THE Company she had left behind her being all except Mr  Glanville  to the last Degree surpriz'd at her strange Words and  Actions continued mute for several Minutes after she was gone staring upon one another as if each wish'd to know the other's Opinion of such an unaccountable Behaviour At last Miss  Glanville  who observed her Brother's Back was towards her told Mr  Selvin  in a low Voice that she hop'd he would call and take his Leave of them before he set out for the Place where his Despair would carry him  Mr  Selvin  in spite of his natural Gravity could not forbear laughing at this Speech of Miss  Glanville  's which shock'd her Brother and not being able to stay where  Arabella  was ridicul'd nor intitled to resent it which would have been a manifest Injustice on that Occasion he retir'd to his own Apartment to give vent to that Spleen which in those Moments made him out of Humour with all the World  Sir  Charles  when he was gone indulg'd himself in a little Mirth on his Niece's Extravagance protesting he did not know what to do with her Upon which Miss  Glanville  observ'd that it was a Pity there were not such Things as Protestant Nunneries giving it as her Opinion that her Cousin ought to be confin'd in one of those Places and never suffer'd to see any Company by which Means she would avoid exposing herself in the Manner she did now  Mr  Selvin  who possibly thought this a reasonable Scheme of Miss  Glanville  's seem'd by his Silence to assent to her Opinion but Sir  Charles  was greatly displeas'd with his Daughter for expressing herself so freely alledging that  Arabella  when she was out of those Whims was a very sensible young Lady and sometimes  talk'd as learnedly as a Divine To which Mr  Selvin  also added that she had a great Knowledge of History and had a most surprizing Memory and after some more Discourse to the same Purpose he took his Leave earnestly entreating Sir  Charles  to believe that he never entertain'd any Design of making his Addresses to Lady  Bella  In the mean Time that Lady after having given near half an Hour to those Reflexions which occur to Heroines in the same Situation with herself called for  Lucy  and order'd her to go to the DiningRoom and see in what Condition Mr  Selvin  was telling her she had certainly left him in a Swoon as also the Occasion of it and bid her give him all the Consolation in her Power  Lucy  with Tears in her Eyes at this Recital went down as she was order'd and entering the Room without any Ceremony her Thoughts being wholly fix'd on the melancholy Circumstance her Lady had been telling her she look'd eagerly round the Room without speaking a Word till Sir  Charles  and Miss  Glanville  who thought she had been sent with some Message from  Arabella  ask'd her both at the same Instant What she wanted  I came Sir said  Lucy  repeating her Lady's Words to see in what Condition Mr  Selvin  is in and to give him all the Solation in my Power  Sir  Charles  laughing heartily at this Speech ask'd her what she could do for Mr  Selvin  To which she reply'd she did not know but  her Lady had told her to give him all the Solation in her Power  Consolation thou would'st say I suppose said Sir  Charles  Yes Sir said  Lucy  curtesying Well Child added he go up and tell your Lady Mr  Selvin  does not need any Consolation  Lucy  accordingly return'd with this Message and was met at the ChamberDoor by  Arabella  who hastily ask'd her if Mr  Selvin  was recover'd from his Swoon To which  Lucy  reply'd that she did not know but that Sir  Charles  bid her tell her Ladyship Mr  Selvin  did not need any Consolation  Oh Heavens cry'd  Arabella  throwing herself into a Chair as pale as DeathHe is dead he has fallen upon his Sword and put an End to his Life and Miseries at onceOh how unhappy am I cry'd she bursting into Tears to be the Cause of so cruel an AccidentWas ever any Fate so terrible as mineWas ever Beauty so fatalWas ever Rigour so unfortunateHow will the Quiet of my future Days be disturbed by the sad Remembrance of a Man whose Death was caused by my DisdainBut why resum'd she after a little PauseWhy do I thus afflict myself for what has happen'd by an unavoidable Necessity Nor am I singular in the Misfortune which has befallen meDid not the sad  Perinthus  die for the beautiful  Panthea  Did not the Rigour of  Barsina  bring the miserable  Oxyatres  to the GraveAnd the Severity of  Statira  make  Oroondates  fall upon his Sword in her Presence tho' happily he escap'd being kill'd by itLet us then not afflict ourselves  unreasonably at this sad AccidentLet us lament as we ought the fatal Effects of our CharmsBut let us comfort ourselves with the Thought that we have only acted conformable to our Duty  Arabella  having pronounc'd these last Words with a solemn and lofty Accent order'd  Lucy  who listen'd to her with Eyes drown'd in Tears to go down and ask if the Body was remov'd for added she all my Constancy will not be sufficient to support me against that pitiful Sight  Lucy  accordinly deliver'd her Message to Sir  Charles  and Miss  Glanville  who were still together discoursing on the fantastical Turn of  Arabella  when the Knight who could not possibly comprehend what she meant by asking if the Body was removed bid her tell her Lady he desired to speak with her  Arabella  upon receiving this Summons set herself to consider what could be the Intent of it If Mr  Selvin  be dead said she what Good can my Presence do among them Surely it cannot be to upbraid me with my Severity that my Uncle desires to see meNo it would be unjust to suppose it Questionless my unhappy Lover is still struggling with the Pangs of Death and for a Consolation in his last Moments implores the Favour of resigning up his Life in my Sight Pausing a little at these Words she rose from her Seat with a Resolution to give the unhappy  Selvin  her Pardon before he dy'd Meeting Mr  Glanville  as he was returning from his Chamber to the DiningRoom she told him she hop'd the Charity she was going to discover  towards his Rival would not give him any Uneasiness and preventing his Reply by going hastily into the Room he follow'd her dreading some new Extravagance yet not able to prevent it endeavour'd to conceal his Confusion from her Observation  Arabella  after breathing a gentle Sigh told told Sir  Charles  that she was come to grant Mr  Selvin  her Pardon for the Offence he had been guilty of that he might depart in Peace  Well well said Sir  Charles  he is departed in Peace without it  How Sir interrupted  Arabella  is he dead then already Alas why had he not the Satisfaction of seeing me before he expir'd that his Sould might have departed in Peace He would have been assur'd not only of my Pardon but Pity also and that Assurance would have made him happy in his last Moments  Why Niece interrupted Sir  Charles  staring you surprize me prodigiously Are you in earnest  Questionless I am Sir said she nor ought you to be surpriz'd at the Concern I express for the Fate of this unhappy Man nor at the Pardon I propos'd to have granted him since herein I am justified by the Example of many great and virtuous Princesses who have done as much nay haply more than I intended to have done for Persons whose Offences were greater than Mr  Selvin  's  I am very sorry Madam said Sir  Charles  to hear you talk in this Manner 'Tis really enough to make one suspect you are  You do me great Injustice Sir interrupted  Arabella  if you suspect me to be guilty of any unbecoming Weakness for this Man If barely expressing my Compassion for his Misfortunes be esteem'd so great a Favour what would you have thought if I had supported his Head on my Knees while he was dying shed Tears over him and discover'd all the Tokens of a sincere Affliction for him  Good God said Sir  Charles  lifting up his Eyes Did any body ever hear of any thing like this  What Sir said  Arabella  with as great an Appearance of Surprize in her Countenance as his had discover'd Do you say you never heard of any thing like this Then you never heard of the Princess of  Media  I suppose  No not I Madam said Sir  Charles  peevishly  Then Sir resum'd  Arabella  permit me to tell you that this fair and virtuous Princess condescended to do all I have mention'd for the fierce  Labynet  Prince of  Assyria  who tho' he had mortally offended her by stealing her away out of the Court of the King her Father nevertheless when he was wounded to Death in her Presence and humbly implor'd her Pardon before he died she condescended as I have said to support him on her Knees and shed Tears for his DisasterI could produce many more Instances of the like Compassion in Ladies almost as highly born as herself tho' perhaps their Quality was not quite so illustrious she being the Heiress of two powerful Kingdoms Yet to mention only these  Good Heav'ns cry'd Mr  Glanville  here being quite out of Patience I shall go distracted  Arabella  surpriz'd at this Exclamation look'd earnestly at him for a Momentand then ask'd him Whether any thing she had said had given him Uneasiness  Yes upon my Soul Madam said  Glanville  so vex'd and confus'd that he hardly knew what he said  I am sorry for it reply'd  Arabella  gravely and also am greatly concern'd to find that in Generosity you are so much exceeded by the illustrious  Cyrus  who was so far from taking Umbrage at  Mandana  's Behaviour to the dying Prince that he commended her for the Compassion she had shewn him So also did the brave and generous  Oroondates  when the fair  Statira    By Heav'ns cry'd  Glanville  rising in a Passion there's no hearing this Pardon me Madam but upon my Soul you'll make me hang myself  Hang yourself repeated  Arabella  sure you know not what you sayYou meant I suppose that you'll fall upon your Sword What Hero ever threatned to give himself so vulgar a Death But pray let me know the Cause of your Despair so sudden and so violent  Mr  Glanville  continuing in a sort of sullen Silence  Arabella  raising her Voice went on  Tho' I do not conceive myself oblig'd to give you an Account of my Conduct seeing that I have only permitted you yet to hope for my Favour yet I owe to myself and my own  Honour the Justification I am going to make Know then that however suspicious my Compassion for Mr  Selvin  may appear to your mistaken Judgment yet it has its Foundation only in the Generosity of my Disposition which inclines me to pardon the Fault when the unhappy Criminal repents and to afford him my Pity when his Circumstances require it Let not therefore the Charity I have discover'd towards your Rival be the Cause of your Despair since my Sentiments for him were he living would be what they were before that is full of Indifference nay haply Disdain And suffer not yourself to be so carried away by a violent and unjust Jealousy as to threaten your won Death which if you really had any Ground for your Suspicions and truly lov'd me would come unsought for tho' not undesir'd For indeed was your Despair reasonable Death would necessarily follow it for what Lover can live under so desperate a Misfortune In that Case you may meet Death undauntedly when it comes nay embrace it with Joy but truly the killing one's self is but a false Picture of true Courage proceeding rather from Fear of a further Evil than Contempt of that you fly to For if it were a Contempt of Pain the same Principle would make you resolve to bear patiently and fearlesly all kind of Pains and Hope being of all other the most contrary Thing to Fear this being an utter Banishment of Hope seems to have its Ground in Fear  CHAP IV  In which Mr Glanville makes an unsuccessful Attempt upon Arabella  ARABELLA  when she had finish'd these Words which banish'd in part Mr  Glanville  's Confusion went to her own Apartment follow'd by Miss  Glanville  to whom she had made a Sign for that Purpose and throwing herself into a Chair burst into Tears which greatly surprizing Miss  Glanville  she prest her to tell her the Cause  Alas reply'd  Arabella  have I not Cause to think myself extremely unhappy The deplorable Death of Mr  Selvin  the Despair to which I see your Brother reduc'd with the fatal Consequences which may attend it fills me with a mortal Uneasiness  Well said Miss  Glanville  your Ladyship may make yourself quite easy as to both these Matters for Mr  Selvin  is not dead nor is my Brother in Despair that I know of  What do you say Miss interrupted  Arabella  is not Mr  Selvin  dead Was the Wound he gave himself not mortal then  I know of no Wound that he gave himself not I said Miss  Glanville  what makes your Ladyship suppose he gave himself a Woundâ–ª Lord bless me what strange Thoughts come into your Head  Truly I am rejoic'd to hear it reply'd  Arabella  and in order to prevent the Effects of his Despair I'll instantly dispatch my Commands to him to live  I dare answer for his Obedience Madam said Miss  Glanville  smiling  Arabella  then gave Orders for Paper and Pens to be brought her and seeing Mr  Glanville  enter the Room very formally acquainted him with her Intention telling him that he ought to be satisfy'd with the Banishment to which she had doom'd his unhappy Rival and not require his Death since he and nothing to fear from his Pretensions  I assure you Madam said Mr  Glanville  I am perfectly easy upon that Account And in order to spare you the Trouble of sending to Mr  Selvin  I may venture to assure you that he is in no Danger of dying  'Tis impossible Sir reply'd  Arabella  according to the Nature of Things 'tis impossible but he must already be very near Death You know the Rigour of my Sentence you know  I know Madam said Mr  Glanville  that Mr  Selvin  does not think himself under a Necessity of obeying your Sentence and has the Impudence to question your Authority for banishing him from his native Country  My Authority Sir said  Arabella  strangely surpriz'd is founded upon the absolute Power he has given me over him  He denies that Madam said  Glanville  and says that he neither can give nor you exercise an absolute Power over him since you are both accountable to the King whose Subjects you are and both restrain'd by the Laws under whose Sanction you live  Arabella  's apparent Confusion at these Words giving Mr  Glanville  Hopes that he had fallen upon a proper Method to cure her of some of her strange Notions he was going to pursue his Arguments when  Arabella  looking a little sternly upon him  The Empire of Love said she like the Empire of Honour is govern'd by Laws of its own which have no Dependence upon or Relation to any other  Pardon me Madam said  Glanville  if I presume to differ from you Our Laws have fix'd the Boundaries of Honour as well as those of Love  How is that possible reply'd  Arabella  when they differ so widely that a Man may be justify'd by the one and yet condemn'd by the other For Instance pursued she you are not permitted by the Laws of the Land to take away the Life of any Person whatever yet the Laws of Honour oblige you to hunt your Enemy thro' the World in order to sacrifice him to your Vengeance Since it is impossible then for the same Actions to be at once just and unjust it must necessarily follow that the Law which condemns it and that which justifies it is not the same but directly oppositeAnd now added she after a little Pause I hope I have entirely clear'd up that Point to you  You have indeed Madam reply'd Mr  Glanville  proved to a Demonstration that what is called Honour is something distinct from Justice since they command Things absolutely opposite to each other  Arabella  without reflecting on this Inference went on to prove the independent Sovereignty of Love which said she may be collected from all the Words and Actions of those Heroes who were inspir'd by this Passion We see it in them pursued she triumphing not only over all natural and avow'd Allegiance but superior even to Friendship Duty and Honour itself This the Actions of  Oroondates Artaxerxes Spitridates  and many other illustrious Princes sufficiently testify  Love requires a more unlimited Obedience from its Slaves than any other Monarch can expect from his Subjects an Obedience which is circumscrib'd by no Laws whatever and dependent upon nothing but itself  I shall live Madam says the renowned Prince of  Scythia  to the divine  Statira  I shall live since it is your Command I should do so and Death can have no Power over a Life which you are pleas'd to take Care of  Say only that you wish I should conquer said the great  Juba  to the incomparable  Cleopatra  and my Enemies will be already vanquish'd Victory will come over to the Side you favourand an Army of a hundred thousand Men will not be able to overcome the Man who has your Commands to conquer  How mean and insignificant pursued she are the Titles bestow'd on other Monarchs compar'd with those which dignify the Sovereigns of Hearts such as divine Arbitress of my Fate Visible Divinity Earthly Goddess and many others equally sublime  Mr  Glanville  losing all patience at her obstinate Folly interrupted her here with a Question quite foreign to the Subject she was discussing and soon after quitting her Chamber retir'd to his own more than ever despairing of her Recovery  CHAP V  In which is introduc'd a very singular Character  MISS  Glanville  whose Envy and Dislike of her lovely Cousin was heighten'd by her Suspicions that she disputed with her the Possession of Sir  George  's Heart she having been long in reality a great Admirer of that gay Gentleman was extremely delighted with the Ridicule her absurd Behaviour had drawn upon her at  Bath  which she found by Enquiry was thro' Mr  Tinsel  's Representation grown almost general  In order therefore to be at Liberty to go to the Publick Places uneclips'd by the superior Beauty of  Arabella  she acquainted her Father and Brother with Part of what she had heard which determin'd them to prevent that young Lady's Appearance in Publick while they staid at  Bath  this being no difficult Matter to bring about since  Arabella  only went to the Rooms or Pa+rade in Compliance with the Invitation of her Cousins  Miss  Glanville  being by these Means rid of a Rival too powerful even to contend with went with more than usual Gaiety to the Assembly where the Extravagancies of  Arabella  afforded a perpetual Fund for Diversion Her more than passive Behaviour upon this Occasion banishing all Restraint among those she convers'd with the Jest circulated very freely at  Arabella  's Expence Nor did Miss  Glanville  fail to give new Poignancy to their Sarcasms by artfully disclosing the bent of her Cousin's Studies and enumerating the many Absurdities they had made her guilty of  Arabella  's uncommon Beauty had gain'd her so many Enemies among the Ladies that compos'd this Assembly that they seem'd to contend with each other who should ridicule her most The celebrated Countess ofbeing then at  Bath  approach'd a Circle of these fair Defamers and listning a few Moments to the contemptuous Jests they threw out against the absent Beauty declar'd herself in her Favour which in a Moment such was the Force of her universally acknowledg'd Merit and the Deference always pay'd to her Opinion silenc'd every pretty Impertinent around her  This Lady who among her own Sex had no Superior in Wit Elegance and Ease was inferior to very few of the other in Sense Learning and Judgment Her Skill in Poetry Painting and Musick tho' incontestably great was number'd among the least of her Accomplishments Her Candour her Sweetness her Modesty and Benevolence while they secur'd her from the Darts of Envy render'd her superior  to Praise and made the one as unnecessary as the other ineffectual  She had been a Witness of the Surprize  Arabella  's extraordinary Appearance had occasion'd and struck with that as well as the uncommon Charms of her Person had prest near her with several others of the Company when she was discoursing in the Manner we have related  A Person of the Countess's nice Discernment could not fail of observing the Wit and Spirit which tho' obscur'd was not absolutely hid under the Absurdity of her Notions And this Discovery adding Esteem to the Compassion she felt for the fair Visionary she resolv'd to rescue her from the illnatur'd Raillery of her Sex praising therefore her Understanding and the Beauty of her Person with a Sweetness and Generosity peculiar to herself she accounted in the most delicate Manner imaginable for the Singularity of her Notions from her Studies her Retirment her Ignorance of the World and her lively Imagination And to abate the Keenness of their Sarcasms acknowledg'd that she herself had when very young been deep read in Romances and but for an early Acquaintance with the World and being directed to other Studies was likely to have been as much a Heroine as Lady  Bella  Miss  Glanville  tho' she was secretly vex'd at this Defence of her Cousin was however under a Necessity of seeming oblig'd to the Countess for it And that Lady expressing a Desire to be acquainted with Lady  Bella  Miss  Glanville  respectfully offer'd to attend her Cousin to her Lodgings which the Countess as respectfully declin'd saying As Lady  Bella  was a Stranger she would make her the first Visit  Miss  Glanville  at her Return gave her Brother an Account of what had happen'd at the Assembly and fill'd him with an inconceivable Joy at the Countess's Intention He had always been a zealous Admirer of that Lady's Character and flatter'd himself that the Conversation of so admirable a Woman would be of the utmost Use to  Arabella  That very Night he mention'd her to his beloved Cousin and after enumerating all her fine Qualities declar'd that she had already conceiv'd a Friendship for her and was solicitous of her Acquaintance  I think myself extremely fortunate replied  Arabella  in that I have tho' questionless undeservedly acquir'd the Amity of this lovely Person and I beg you pursued she to Miss  Glanville  to tell her that I long with Impatience to embrace her and to give her that Share in my Heart which her transcendent Merit deserves  Miss  Glanville  only bow'd her Head in Answer to this Request giving her Brother at the same Time a significant Leer who tho' used to  Arabella  's Particularities could not help being a little confounded at the heroick Speech she had made  CHAP VI  Containing something which at first Sight may possibly puzzle the Reader  THE Countess was as good as her Word and two Days after sent a Card to  Arabella  importing her Design to wait on her that Afternoon  Our Heroine expected her with great Impatience and the Moment she enter'd the Room flew towards her with a graceful Eagerness and straining her in her Arms embrac'd her with all the Fervour of a long absent Friend  Sir  Charles  and Mr  Glanville  were equally embarrass'd at the Familiarity of this Address but observing that the Countess seem'd not to be surpriz'd at it but rather to receive it with Pleasure they were soon compos'd  You cannot imagine lovely Stranger said  Arabella  to the Countess as soon as they were seated with what Impatience I have long'd to behold you since the Knowledge I have receiv'd of your rare Qualities and the Friendship you have been pleas'd to honour me withAnd I may truly protest to you that such is my Admiration of your Virtues that I would have gone to the farthest Part of the World to render you that which you with so much Generosity have condescended to bestow upon me  Sir  Charles  star'd at this extraordinary Speech and not being able to comprehend a Word of it was concern'd to think how the Lady to whom it was address'd would understand it  Mr  Glanville  look'd down and bit his Nails in extreme Confusion but the Countess who had not forgot the Language of Romance return'd the Compliment in a Strain as heroick as hers  The Favour I have receiv'd from Fortune said she in bringing me to the Happiness of your Acquaintance charming  Arabella  is so great that I may rationally expect some terrible Misfortune will befall me Seeing that in this Life our Pleasures are so constantly succeeded by Pains that we hardly ever enjoy the one without suffering the other soon after  Arabella  was quite transported to hear the Countess express herself in Language so conformable to her own but Mr  Glanville  was greatly confounded and began to suspect she was diverting herself with his Cousin's Singularities And Sir  Charles  was within a little of thinking her as much out of the Way as his Niece  Misfortunes Madam said  Arabella  are too often the Lot of excellent Persons like yourself The sublimest among Mortals both for Beauty and Virtue have experienc'd the Frowns of Fate The Sufferings of the divine  Statira  or  Cassandra  for she bore both Names the Persecutions of the incomparable  Cleopatra  the Dissresses of the beautiful  Cundace  and the Afflictions of the fair and generous  Mandana  are Proofs that the most illustrious Persons in the World have felt the Rage of Calamity  It must be confess'd said the Countess that all those fair Princesses you have nam'd were for a while extremely unfortunate Yet in the Catalogue of these lovely and afflicted Persons  you have forgot one who might with Justice dispute the Priority of Sufferings with them all I mean the beautiful  Elisa  Princess of  Parthia  Pardon me Madam reply'd  Arabella  I cannot be of your Opinion The Princess of  Parthia  may indeed justly be rank'd among the Number of unfortunate Persons but she can by no means dispute the melancholy Precedence with the divine  Cleopatra  For in fine Madam what Evils did the Princess of  Parthia  suffer which the fair  Cleopatra  did not likewise endure and some of them haply in a greater Degree If  Elisa  by the tyrannical Authority of the King her Father saw herself upon the Point of becoming the Wife of a Prince she detested was not the beautiful Daughter of  Antony  by the more unjustifiable Tyranny of  Augustus  likely to be forced into the Arms of  Tyberius  a proud and cruel Prince who was odious to the whole World as well as to her If  Elisa  was for some time in the Power of Pyrates was not  Cleopatra  Captive to an inhuman King who presented his Sword to the fair Breast of that divine Princess worthy the Adoration of the whole Earth And in fine if  Elisa  had the Grief to see her dear  Artaban  imprison'd by the Order of  Augustus Cleopatra  beheld with mortal Agonies her beloved  Coriolanus  inclos'd amidst the Guards of that enrag'd Prince and doom'd to a cruel Death  'Tis certain Madam reply'd the Countess that the Misfortunes of both these Princesses were very great tho' as you have shew'd me with some Inequality And when one reflects upon the dangerous Adventures to which Persons  of their Quality were expos'd in those Times one cannot help rejoicing that we live in an Age in which the Customs Manners Habits and Inclinations differ so widely from theirs that 'tis impossible such Adventures should even happen  Such is the strange Alteration of Things that some People I dare say at present cannot be persuaded to believe there ever were Princesses wandering thro' the World by Land and Sea in mean Disguises carry'd away violently out of their Father's Dominions by insolent LoversSome discover'd sleeping in Forests other Shipwreck'd on desolate Islands confin'd in Castles bound in Chariots and even strugling amidst the tempestuous Waves of the Sea into which they had cast themselves to avoid the brutal Force of theirRavishers Not one of these Things having happen'd within the Compass of several thousand Years People unlearn'd in Antiquity would be apt to deem them idle Tales so improbable do they appear at present  Arabella  tho' greatly surpriz'd at this Discourse did not think proper to express her Thoughts of it She was unwilling to appear absolutely ignorant of the present Customs of the World before a Lady whose good Opinion she was ardently desirous of improving Her Prepossessions in favour of the Countess made her receive the new Delights she held out to her with Respect tho' not without Doubt and Irresolution Her Blushes her Silence and downcast Eyes gave the Countess to understand Part of her Thoughts who for fear of alarming her too much for that Time dropt the  Subject and turning the Conversation on others more general gave  Arabella  an Opportunity of mingling in it with that Wit and Vivacity which was natural to her when Romances were out of the Question  CHAP VII  In which if the Reader has not anticipated it he will find an Explanation of some seeming Inconsistencies in the foregoing Chapter  THE Countess charm'd with the Wit and good Sense of  Arabella  could not conceal her Admiration but exprest it in Terms the most obligingly imaginable And  Arabella  who was excessively delighted with her return'd the Compliments she made her with the most respectful Tenderness  In the midst of these mutual Civilities  Arabella  in the Style of Romance intreated the Countess to favour her with the Recital of her Adventures  At the Mention of this Request that Lady convey'd so much Confusion into her Countenance that  Arabella  extremely embarrass'd by it tho' she knew not why thought it necessary to apologize for the Disturbance she seem'd to have occasion'd in her  Pardon me Madam reply'd the Countess recovering herself if the uncommoness of your Request made a Moment's Reflexion necessary  to  that a young Lady of your Sense and Delicacy could mean no Offence to Decorum by making it The Word Adventures carries in it so free and licentious a Sound in the Apprehensions of People at this Period of Time that it can hardly with Propriety be apply'd to those few and natural Incidents which compose the History of a Woman of Honour And when I tell you pursued she with a Smile that I was born and christen'd had a useful and proper Education receiv'd the Addresses of my Lordthrough the Recommendation of my Parents and marry'd him with their Consents and my own Inclination and that since we have liv'd in great Harmony together I have told you all the material Passages of my Life which upon Enquiry you will find differ very little from those of other Women of the same Rank who have a moderate Share of Sense Prudence and Virtue  Since you have already Madam replied  Arabella  blushing excus'd me for the Liberty I took with you it will be unnecessary to tell you it was grounded upon the Customs of antient Times when Ladies of the highest Rank and sublimest Virtue were often expos'd to a Variety of cruel Adventures which they imparted in Confidence to each other when Chance brought them together  Custom said the Countess smiling changes the very Nature of Things and what was honourable a thousand Years ago may probably be look'd upon as infamous nowA Lady in the heroick Age you speak of would not be thought to possess any great Share of Merit if she had not  been many times carried away by one or other of her insolent Lovers Whereas a Beauty in this could not pass thro' the Hands of several different Ravishers without bringing an Imputation on her Chastity  The same Actions which made a Man a Hero in those Times would constitute him a Murderer in TheseAnd the same Steps which led him to a Throne Then would infallibly conduct him to a Scaffold Now  But Custom Madam said  Arabella  cannot possibly change the Nature of Virtue or Vice And since Virtue is the chief Characteristick of a Hero a Hero in the last Age will be a Hero in thisTho' the Natures of Virtue or Vice cannot be changed replied the Countess yet they may be mistaken and different Principles Customs and Education may probably change their Names if not their Natures  Sure Madam said  Arabella  a little moved you do not intend by this Inference to prove  Oroondates Artaxerxes Juba Artaban  and the other Heroes of Antiquity bad Men  Judging them by the Rules of Christianity and our present Notions of Honour Justice and Humanity they certainly are replied the Countess  Did they not possess all the necessary Qualifications of Heroes Madam said  Arabella  and each in a superlative DegreeWas not their Valour invincible their Generosity unbounded and their Fidelity inviolable  It cannot be denied said the Countess but that their Valour was invincible and many thousand Men less courageous than themselves  felt the fatal Effects of that invincible Valour which was perpetually seeking after Occasions to exert itself  Oroondates  gave many extraordinary Proofs of that unbounded Generosity so natural to the Heroes of his Time This Prince being sent by the King his Father at the Head of an Army to oppose the  Persian  Monarch who had unjustly invaded his Dominions and was destroying the Lives and Properties of his Subjects having taken the Wives and Daughters of his Enemy Prisoners had by these Means an Opportunity to put a Period to a War so destructive to his Country Yet out of a Generosity truly heroick he releas'd them immediately without any Conditions and falling in Love with one of those Princesses secietly quitted his Father's Court resided several Years in that of the Enemy of his Father and Country engag'd himself to his Daughter and when the War broke out again between the two Kings fought furiously against an Army in which the King his Father was in Person and shed the Blood of his future Subjects without Remorse tho' each of those Subjects we are told would have sacrific'd his Life to save that of their Prince so much was he belov'dâ–ª Such are the Actions which immortalize the Heroes of Romance and are by the Authors of those Books styl'd glorious godlike and divine Yet judging of them as Christians we shall find them impious and base and directly opposite to our present Notions of moral and relative Duties  'Tis certain therefore Madam added the Contess with a Smile that what was Virtue in  those Days is Vice in ours And to form a Hero according to our Notions of 'em at present 'tis nessary to give him Qualities very different from  Oroondates  The secret Charm in the Countenance Voice and Manner of the Countess join'd to the Force of her reasoning could not fail of making some Impression on the Mind of  Arabella  but it was such an Impression as came far short of Conviction She was surpriz'd embarrass'd perplex'd but not convinc'd Heroism romantick Heroism was deeply rooted in her Heart it was her Habit of thinking a Principle imbib'd from Education She could not separate her Ideas of Glory Virtue Courage Generosity and Honour from the false Representations of them in the Actions of  Oroondates Juba Artaxerxes  and the rest of the imaginary Heroes The Countess's Discourse had rais'd a Kind of Tumult in her Thoughts which gave an Air of Perplexity to her lovely Face and made that Lady apprehensive she had gone too far and lost that Ground in her Esteem which she had endeavour'd to acquire by a Conformity to some of her Notions and Language In this however she was mistaken  Arabella  felt a Tenderness for her that had already the Force of a long contracted Friendship and an Esteem little less than Veneration  When the Countess took Leave the Professions of  Arabella  tho' deliver'd in the Language of Romance were very sincere and affecting and were return'd with an equal Degree of Tenderness by the Countess who had conceiv'd a more than ordinary Affection for her  Mr  Glanville  who could have almost worship'd the Countess for the generous Design be saw she had entertain'd took an Opportunity as he handed her to her Chair to intreat in a Manner as earnestly as polite that she would continue the Happiness of her Acquaintance to his Cousin which with a Smile of mingled Dignity and Sweetness she assur'd him of  CHAP VIII  Which concludes Book the Eighth  MR  Glanville  at his Return to the DiningRoom finding  Arabella  retir'd told his Father in a Rapture of Joy that the charming Countess would certainly make a Convert of Lady  Bella  Methinks said the Baronet she has as strange Whims in her Head as my Niece Ad'sheart what a deal of Stuff did she talk about A Parcel of Heroes as she calls them with confounded hard NamesIn my Mind she is more likely to make Lady  Bella  worse than better  Mr  Glanville  a little vex'd at his Father's Misapprehension endeavour'd with as much Delicacy as he could to set him right with Regard to the Countess so that he brought him at last to confess she manag'd the Thing very well  The Countess who had resolv'd to take  Arabella  openly into her Protection was thinking on Means to engage her to appear at the  Assembly whither she propos'd to accompany her in a modern Dress But her good Intentions towards our lovely Heroine were suspended by the Account she receiv'd of her Mother's Indisposition which commanded her immediate Attendance on her at her Seat in  Her sudden Departure gave  Arabella  an extreme Uneasiness and proved a cruel Disappointment to Mr  Glanville  who had founded all his Hopes of her Recovery on the Conversation of that Lady  Sir  Charles  having Affairs that requir'd his Presence in  London  propos'd to his Niece the leaving  Bath  in a few Days to which she consented and accordingly they set out for  London  in  Arabella  's Coach and Six attended by several Servants on Horseback her Women having been sent away before in the Stage  Nothing very remarkable happen'd during this Journey so we shall not trouble our Readers with several small Mistakes of  Arabella  's such as her supposing a neat Country Girl who was riding behind a Man to be some Lady or Princess in Disguise forc'd away by a Lover she hated and intreating Mr  Glanville  to attempt her Rescue which occasion'd some little Debate between her and Sir  Charles  who could not be persuaded to believe it was as she said and forbid his Son to meddle in other Peoples Affairs Several of these Sort of Mistakes as we said before we omit and will therefore if our Reader pleases bring our Heroine without further Delay to  London  The  End  of the  Eighth Book  THE Female QUIXOTE BOOK IX  CHAP I  In which is related an admirable Adventure  _MISS  Glanville  whose Spirits were greatly exhilerated at their Entrance into  London  that Seat of Magnificence and Pleasure congratulated her Cousin upon the Entertainment she would receive from the new and surprizing Objects which every Day for a considerable Time would furnish her with and ran over the Catalogue of Diversions with such a Volubility of Tongue as drew a gentle Reprimand from her Father and made her keep a sullen Silence till they were set down in  St  James  's Square the Place of their Residence in Town  Sir  Charles  having order'd his late Lady's Apartment to be prepar'd for the Accommodation of his Niece as soon as the first Civilities were over she retir'd to her Chamber where she employ'd herself in giving her Women Directions for placing her Books of which she had brought a moderate Quantity to  London  in her Closet  Miss  Glanville  as soon as she had dispatch'd away some hundred Cards to her Acquaintance to give them Notice she was in Town attended  Arabella  in her own Apartment and as they sat at the Tea she begun to regulate the Diversions of the Week naming the DrawingRoom Park Concert  Ranelagh  LadyAssembly the Dutchess of  Rant VauxHall  and a long  c  of Visits at which  Arabella  with an Accent that express'd her Surprize ask'd her If she suppos'd she intended to stay in Town three or four Years  Law Cousin said Miss  Glanville  all this is but the Amusement of a few Days  Amusement do you say replied  Arabella  methinks it seems to be the sole Employment of those Days And what you call the Amusement must of Necessity be the Business of Life  You are always so grave Cousin said Miss  Glanville  one does not know what to say to you However I shan't press you to go to Publick Places against your Inclination yet you'll condescend to receive a few Visits I suppose  Yes replied  Arabella  and if among the Ladies whom I shall see I find any like the amiable  Countess of I shall not scruple to enter into the most tender Amity with them  The Countess of is very well to be sure said Miss  Glanville  yet I don't know how it is she does not suit my TasteShe is very particular in a great many Things and knows too much for a Lady as I heard my Lord  Fribble  say one Day Then she is quite unfashionable She hates Cards keeps no Assembly is seen but seldom at Publick Places and in my Opinion as well as in a great many others is the dullest Company in the World I'm sure I met her at a Visit a little before I went down to your Seat and she had not been a quarter of an Hour in the Room before she set a whole Circle of Ladies a yawning  Arabella  tho' she had a sincere Contempt for her Cousin's Manner of thinking yet always politely conceal'd it and vex'd as she was at her Sneers upon the Countess she contented herself with gently defending her telling her at the same Time that till she met with a Lady who had more Merit than the Countess possess'd she should always possess the first Place in her Esteem  Arabella  who had from Youth adopted the Resentments of her Father refus'd to make her Appearance at Court which Sir  Charles  gently intimated to her yet being not wholly divested of the Curiosity natural to her Sex she condescended to go  incog  to the Gallery on a B  ll Night accompanied by Mr  Glanville  and his Sister in order to behold the Splendor of the  British  Court  As her Romances had long familiariz'd her Thoughts to Objects of Grandeur and Magnificence she was not so much struck as might have been expected with those that now presented themselves to her View Nor was she a little disappointed to find that among the Men she saw none whose Appearance came up to her Ideas of the Air and Port of an  Artaban Oroondates  or  Juba  or any of the Ladies who did not in her Opinion fall short of the Perfections of  Elisa Mandana Statira  c 'Twas remarkable too that she never enquir'd how often the Princesses had been carried away by captivated Monarchs or how many Victories the King's Sons had gain'd but seem'd the whole Time she was there to have suspended all her Romantick Ideas of Glory Beauty Gallantry and Love  Mr  Glanville  was highly pleas'd with her compos'd Behaviour and a Day or two after intreated her to allow him the Honour of shewing her what was remarkable and worthy of her Observation in this great Metropolis To this she also consented and for the greater Privacy began their Travels in a hir'd Coach  Part of several Days were taken up in this Employment but Mr  Glanville  had the Mortification to find she was full of Allusions to her Romances upon every Occasion such as her asking the Person who shews the Armoury at the  Tower  the Names of the Knights to whom each Suit belong'd and wondering there were no Devices on the Shields or Plumes of Feathers in the Helmets She observ'd that the Lyon  Lysimachus  kill'd was according to the History of  that Prince much larger than any of those she was shew'd in the  Tower  and also much fiercer Took Notice that St  Paul  's was less magnificent in the Inside than the Temple in which  Cyrus  when he went to  Mandana  heard her return Thanks for his suppos'd Death Enquir'd if it was not customary for the King and his whole Court to sail in Barges upon the  Thames  as  Augustus  used to do upon the  Tyber  whether they had not Musick and Collations in the Park and where they celebrated the Justs and Tournaments  The Season for  VauxHall  being not yet over she was desirous of once seeing a Place which by the Description she had heard of it greatly resembled the Gardens of  Lucullus  at  Rome  in which the Emperor with all the Princes and Princesses of his Court were so nobly entertain'd and where so many gallant Conversations had pass'd among those admirable Persons  The Singularity of her Dress for she was cover'd with her Veil drew a Number of Gazers after her who prest round her with so little Respect that she was greatly embarrass'd and had Thoughts of quitting the Place delightful as she own'd it immediately when her Attention was wholly engross'd by an Adventure in which she soon interested herself very deeply  An Officer of Rank in the Sea Service had brought his Mistress disguis'd in a Suit of Man's or rather Boy's Cloaths and a Hat and Feather into the Gardens The young Creature being a little intoxicated with the Wine she had taken too freely was thrown so much off her  Guard as to give Occasion to some of the Company to suspect her Sex and a gay Fellow in order to give them some Diversion at her Expence pretending to be affronted at something she said drew his Sword upon the disguis'd Fair One which so alarm'd her that she shriek'd out She was a Woman and ran for Protection to her Lover who was so dis  rder'd with Liquor that he was not able to defend her  Miss  Glanville  ever curious and inquisitive demanded the Cause why the Company ran in Crouds to that particular Spot and receiv'd for Answer That a Gentleman had drawn his Sword upon a Lady disguis'd in a Man's Habit  Oh Heav'ns cry'd  Arabella  this must certainly be a very notable Adventure The Lady has doubtless some extraordinary Circumstances in her Story and haply upon Enquiry her Misfortunes will be found to resemble those which oblig'd the beautiful  Aspasia  to put on the same Disguise who was by that Means murder'd by the cruel  Zenodorus  in a Fit of Jealousy at the Amity his Wife exprest for her But can I not see this unfortunate Fair One added she pressing in spite of Mr  Glanville  's Intreaties thro' the CroudI may haply be able to afford her some Consolation  Mr  Glanville  finding his Persuasions were not regarded follow'd her with very little Difficulty For her Veil falling back in her Hurry she did not mind to replace it and the Charms of her Face join'd to the Majesty of her Person and Singularity of her Dress attracting every Person's Attention and Respect they made Way for her to pass not a little surpriz'd  at the extreme Earnestness and Solemnity that appear'd in her Countenance upon an Event so diverting to every one else  The disguis'd Lady whom she was endeavouring to approach had thrown herself upon a Bench in one of the Boxes trembling still with the Apprehension of the Sword tho' her Antagonist was kneeling at her Feet making Love to her in MockHeroicks for the Diversion of the Company  Her Hat and Peruke had fallen off in her Fright and her Hair which had been turn'd up under it hung now loosely about her Neck and gave such an Appearance of Woe to a Face which notwithstanding the Paleness that Terror had overspread it with was really extremely pretty that  Arabella  was equally struck with Compassion and Admiration of her  Lovely Unknown said she to her with an Air of extreme Tenderness tho' I am a Stranger both to your Name and History yet your Aspect persuading me your Quality is not mean and the Condition and Disguise in which I behold you shewing that you are Unfortunate permit me to offer you all the Assistances in my Power seeing that I am mov'd thereto by my Compassion for your Distress and that Esteem which the Sight of you must necessarily inspire  Mr  Glanville  was struck dumb with Confusion at this strange Speech and at the Whispers and Scoffs it occasion'd among the Spectators He attempted to take hold of her Hand in order to lead her away but she disengag'd herself from him with a Frown of Displeasure and taking no Notice of Miss  Glanville  who whisper'd  with great Emotion Lord Cousin how you expose yourself prest nearer to the Beautiful Disguis'd and again repeated her Offers of Service  The Girl being perfectly recover'd from her Intoxication by the Fright she had been in gaz'd upon  Arabella  with a Look of extreme Surprize Yet being mov'd to respect by the Dignity of her Appearance and strange as her Words seem'd to be by the obliging Purport of them and the affecting Earnestness with which they were deliver'd she rose from her Seat and thank'd her with an Accept full of Regard and Submission  Fair Maid said  Arabella  taking her Hand let us quit this Place where your Discovery may probably subject you to more Dangers If you will be pleas'd to put yourself into my Protection and acquaint me with the History of your Misfortunes I have Interest enough with a valiant Person who shall undertake to free you from your Persecutions and reestablish the Repose of your Life  The kneeling Hero who as well as every one else that were present had gaz'd with Astonishment at  Arabella  during all this Passage perceiving she was about to rob him of the disguis'd Fair seiz'd hold of the Hand she had at Liberty and swore he would not part with her  Mr  Glanville  almost mad with Vexation endeavour'd to get  Arabella  away  Are you mad Madam said he in a Whisper to make all this Rout about a Prostitute Do you see how every body stares at you What will they thinkFor Heav'ns sake let us be gone  What Sir replied  Arabella  in a Rage Are you base enough to leave this admirable Creature in the Power of that Man who is questionless her Ravisher and will you not draw your Sword in her Defence  Hey day cry'd the SeaOfficer wak'd out of his stupid Dose by the Clamour about him What's the Matter hereWhat are you doing Where's my  Lucy  Zoons Sir said he to the young Fellow who held her What Business have you with my  Lucy  And uttering a dreadful Oath drew out his Sword and stagger'd towards his gay Rival who observing the Weakness of his Antagonist flourish'd with his Sword to shew his Courage and frighten the Ladies who all ran away screaming  Arabella  taking Miss  Glanville  under the Arm cried out to Mr  Glanville  as she left the Place to take Care of the distress'd Lady and while the two Combatants were disputing for her to carry her away in Safety  But Mr  Glanville  without regarding this Injunction hasten'd after her and to pacify her told her the Lady was rescu'd by her favourite Lover and carry'd off in Triumph  But are you sure said  Aabella  it was not some other of her Ravishers who carry'd her away and not the Person whom she has haply favour'd with her Affection May not the same Thing have happen'd to her as did to the beautiful  Candace  Queen of  Ethiopia  who while two of her Ravishers were fighting for her a third whom she took for her Deliverer came and carry'd her away  But she went away willingly I assure you Madam said Mr  Glanville  Pray don't be in any Concern about her  If she went away willingly with him reply'd  Arabella  'tis probable it may not be another Ravisher And yet if this Person that rescu'd her happen'd to be in Armour and the Vizor of his Helmet down she might be mistaken as well as Queen  Candace  Well well he was not in Armour Madam said  Glanville  almost beside himself with Vexation at her Folly  You seem to be disturb'd Sir said  Arabella  a little surpriz'd at his peevish Tone Is there any Thing in this Adventure which concerns you Nay now I remember you did not offer to defend the Beautiful Unknown I am not willing to impute your Inaction upon such an Occasion to Want of Courage or Generosity perhaps you are acquainted with her History and from this Knowledge refus'd to engage in her Defence  Mr  Glanville  perceiving the Company gather from all Parts to the Walk they were in told her he would acquaint her with all he knew concerning the disguis'd Lady when they were in the Coach on their Return Home and  Arabella  impatient for the promis'd Story propos'd to leave the Gardens immediately which was gladly comply'd with by Mr  Glanville  who heartily repented his having carry'd her thither  CHAP II  Which ends with a very unfavourable Prediction for our Heroine  AS soon as they were seated in the Coach she did not fail to call upon him to perform his Promise But Mr  Glanville  excessively out of Humour at her exposing herself in the Gardens reply'd without considering whether he shuld not offend her That he knew no more of the disguis'd Lady than any body else in the Place  How Sir reply'd  Arabella  Did you not promise to relate her Adventures to me And would you have me believe you knew no more of them than the rest of the Cavaliers and Ladies in the Place  Upon my Soul I don't Madam said  Glanville  yet what I know of her is sufficient to let me understand she was not worth the Consideration you seem'd to have for her  She cannot sure be more indiscreet than the fair and unfortunate  Hermione  reply'd  Arabella  who like her put on Man's Apparel through Despair at the ill Success of her Passion for  Alexander  And certain it is that tho' the beautiful  Hermione  was guilty of one great Error which lost her the Esteem of  Alexander  yet she had a high and noble Soul as was manifest by her Behaviour and Words when she was run thro' by the Sword of  Demetrius  Oh Death cry'd she as she was falling how sweet do I find  thee and how much and how earnestly have I desir'd thee  Oh Lord oh Lord cry'd Mr  Glanville  hardly sensible of what he said Was there ever any Thing so intolerable  Do you pity the unhappy  Hermione  Sir said  Arabella  interpreting his Exclamation her own Way Indeed she is well worthy of your Compassion And if the bare Recital of the Words she utter'd at receiving her Death's Wound affects you so much you may guess what would have been your Agonies had you been  Demetrius  that gave it to her  Here Mr  Glanville  groaning aloud thro' Impatience at her Absurdities  This Subject affects you deeply I perceive said  Arabella  There is no Question but you would have acted in the same Circumstance as  Demetrius  did Yet let me tell you the Extravagancy of his Rage and Despair for what he had innocently committed was imputed to him as a great Imbecillity as was also the violent Passion he conceiv'd soon after for the Fair  Deidamia  You know the Accident which brought that fair Princess into his Way  Indeed I do not Madam said  Glanville  peevishly  Well then I'll tell you said  Arabella  but pausing a little  The Recital I have engag'd myself to make added she will necessarily take up some Hours Time as upon Reflexion I have found So if you will dispense with my beginning it at present I will satisfy your Curiosity Tomorrow when I may be able to pursue it without Interruption  To this Mr  Glanville  made no other Answer than a Bow with his Head and the Coach a few Moments after arriving at their own House he led her to her Apartment firmly resolv'd never to attend her to any more Publick Places while she continued in the same ridiculous Folly  Sir  Charles  who had several Times been in doubt whether  Arabella  was not really disorder'd in her Senses upon Miss  Glanville  's Account of her Behaviour at the Gardens concluded she was absolutely mad and held a short Debate with himself Whether he ought not to bring a Commission of Lunacy against her rather than marry her to his Son whom he was persuaded could never be happy with a Wife so unaccountably absurd Tho' he only hinted at this to Mr  Glanville  in a Conversation he had with him while his Dissatisfaction was at its Height concerning  Arabella  yet the bare Supposition that his Father ever thought of such a Thing threw the young Gentleman into such Agonies that Sir  Charles  to compose him protested he would do nothing in relation to his Niece that he would not approve of Yet he expostulated with him on the Absurdity of her Behaviour and the Ridicule to which she expos'd herself wherever she went appealing to him whether in a Wife he could think those Follies supportable which in a Mistress occasion'd him so much Confusion  Mr  Glanville  as much in Love as he was felt all the Force of this Inference and acknowledg'd to his Father That he could not think of marrying  Arabella  till the Whims her Romances  had put into her Head were craz'd by a better Knowledge of Life and Manners But he added with a Sigh That he knew not how this Reformation would be effected for she had such a strange Facility in reconciling every Incident to her own fantastick Ideas that every new Object added Strength to the fatal Deception she laboured under  CHAP III  In which Arabella meets with another admirable Adventure  OUR lovely Heroine had not been above a Fortnight in  London  before the gross Air of that smoaky Town affected her Health so much that Sir  Charles  propos'd to her to go for a few Weeks to  Richmond  where he hir'd a House elegantly furnish'd for her Reception  Miss  Glanville  had been too long out of that darling City to pay her the Compliment of attending her constantly at  Richmond  yet she promis'd to be as often as possible with her And Sir  Charles  having Affaris that could not dispense with his Absence from town plac'd his Steward in her House being a Person whose Prudence and Fidelity he could rely upon and he with her Women and two or three other menial Servants made up her Equipage  As it was not consistent with Decorum for Mr  Glanville  to reside in her House he contented himself with riding to  Richmond  generally  every Day And as long as  Arabella  was pleas'd with that Retirement he resolv'd not to press her Return to Town till the Countess ofarriv'd in whose Conversation he grounded all his Hopes of her Cure  At that Season of the Year  Richmond  not being quite deserted by Company  Arabella  was visited by several Ladies of Fashion who charm'd with her Affability Politeness and good Sense were strangely perplex'd how to account for some Peculiarities in her Dress and Manner of thinking  Some of the younger Sort from whom  Arabella  's extraordinary Beauty took away all Pretensions to Equality on that Score made themselves extremely merry with her Oddnesses as they call'd them and gave broad Intimations that her Head was not right  As for  Arabella  whose Taste was as delicate Sentiments as refin'd and Judgment as clear as any Person's could be who believ'd the Authenticity of  Scudery  's Romances she was strangely disappointed to find no Lady with whom she could converse with any tolerable Pleasure And that instead of  Clelia  's  Statira  's  Mandana  's c she found only Miss  Glanville  among all she knew  The Comparison she drew between such as these and the charming Countess ofwhom she had just begun to be acquainted with at  Bath  increas'd her Regret for the Interruption that was given to so agreeable a Friendship And it was with infinite Pleasure Mr  Glanville  heard her repeatedly wish for the Arrival of that admirable Lady as she always call'd her in Town  Not being able to relish that insipid Conversation of the young Ladies that visited her at  Richmond  her chief Amusement was to walk in the Park there which because of its Rural Privacy was extremely agreeable to her Inclinations  Here she indulg'd Contemplation leaning on the Arm of her faithful  Lucy  while her other Women walk'd at some Distance behind her and two Men Servants kept her always in Sight  One Evening when she was returning from her usual Walk she heard the Sound of a Woman's Voice which seem'd to proceed from a Tuft of Trees that hid her from her View And stopping a Moment distinguish'd some plaintive Accents which increasing her Curiosity she advanc'd towards the Place telling  Lucy  she was resolv'd if possible to discover who the distress'd Lady was and what was the Subject of her Affliction  As she drew nearer with softly treading Steps she could distinguish through the Branches of the Trees now despoil'd of great part of their Leaves two Women seated on the Ground their Backs towards her and one of them with her Head gently reclin'd on the other's Shoulder seem'd by her mournful Action to be weeping for she often put her Handkerchief to her Eyes breathing every Time a Sigh which as  Arabella  phras'd it seem'd to proceed from the deepest Recesses of her Heart  This Adventure more worthy indeed to be styl'd an Adventure than all our Fair Heroine had ever yet met with and so conformable to what she had read in Romances fill'd her Heart with eager Expectation She made a Sign to  Lucy  to make no Noise and creeping still closer towards the Place where this afflicted Person sat she heard her distinctly utter these Words which however were often interrupted with her Sighs  Ah  Ariamenes  whom I to my Misfortune have too much loved and whom to my Misfortune I fear I shall never sufficiently hate since that Heav'n and thy cruel Ingratitude hath ordain'd that thou shalt never be mine and that so many sweet and dear Hopes are for ever taken from me return me at least ungrateful Man return me those Testimonies of my innocent Affection which were sometimes so dear and precious to thee Return me those Favours which all innocent as they were are become Criminal by thy Crime Return me Cruel Man return me those Reliques of my Heart which thou detainest in Despight of me and which notwithstanding thy Infidelity I cannot recover  Here her Tears interrupting her Speech  Arabella  being impatient to know the History of this afflicted Person came softly round to the other Side and shewing herself occasion'd some Disturbance to the sad Unknown who rising from her Seat with her Face averted as if asham'd of having so far disclos'd her Sorrows in a Stranger's Hearing endeavour'd to pass by her unnotic'd  Arabella  perceiving her Design stop'd her with a very graceful Action and with a Voice all compos'd of Sweetness earnestly conjur'd her to relate her History  Think not Lovely Unknown said she for she was really very pretty that my Endeavours to detain you proceed from an indiscreet Curiosity 'Tis true some Complaints which have fallen from your fair Mouth have rais'd in me a Desire to be acquainted with your Adventures but this Desire has its Foundation in that Compassion your Complaints have fill'd me with And if I wish to know your Misfortunes 'tis only with a View of affording you some Consolation  Pardon me Madam said the Fair Afflicted gazing on  Arabella  with many Signs of Admiration if my Confusion at being overheard in a Place I had chosen to bewail my Misfortunes made me be guilty of some Appearance of Rudeness not seeing the admirable Person I wanted to avoid But pursued she hesitating a little those Characters of Beauty I behold in your Face and the Gracefulness of your Deportment convincing me you can be of no ordinary Rank I will the less scruple to acquaint you with my Adventures and the Cause of those Complaints you have heard proceed from my Mouth  Arabella  assuring her that whatever her Misfortunes were she might depend upon all the Assistance in her Power seated herself near her at the Foot of the Tree where she had been fitting and giving  Lucy  Orders to join the rest of her Women and stay at a Distance till she made a Sign to them to advance she prepar'd to listen to the Adventures of the Fair Unknown who after some little Pause began to relate them in this Manner  CHAP IV  In which is related the History of the Princess of Gaul  MY Name Madam is  Cynccia  my Birth Illustrious enough seeing that I am the Daughter of a Sovereign Prince who possesses a large and spacious Territory in what is now called Antient  Gaul  What Madam interrupted  Arabella  Are you a Princess then  Questionless I am Madam replied the Lady and a Princess happy and prosperous till the Felicity of my Life was interrupted by the perfidious  Ariamenes  Pardon me Madam interrupted  Arabella  again that my Ignorance of your Quality made me be deficient in those Respects which are due to your high Birth and which notwithstanding those Characters of Greatness I might read in the Lineaments of your Visage I yet neglected to p  y  Alas Madam said the Stranger that little Beauty which the Heavens bestow'd on me only to make me wretched as by the Event it has proved has long since taken its Flight and together with my Happiness I have lost that which made me Unhappy And certain it is Grief has made such Ravages among what might once have been thought tolerable in my Face that I should not be surpriz'd if my being no longer Fair should make you with Difficulty believe I ever was so  Arabella  after a proper Compliment in Answer to this Speech intreated the Princess to go on with her History who hesitating a little comply'd with her Request  Be pleas'd to know then Madam said she that being bred up with all imaginable Tenderness in my Father's Court I had no sooner arriv'd to my Sixteenth Year than I saw myself surrounded with Lovers who nevertheless such was the Severity with which I behav'd myself conceal'd their Passions under a respectful Silence well knowing Banishment from my Presence was the least Punishment they had to expect if they presum'd to declare their Sentiments to me  I liv'd in this Fashion Madam for Two Years longer rejoicing in the Insensibility of my own Heart and triumphing in the Sufferings of others when my Tranquillity was all at once interrupted by an Accident which I am going to relate to you  The Princess stopt here to give Vent to some Sighs which a cruel Remembrance forc'd from her and continuing in a deep Muse for five or six Minutes resum'd her Story in this Manner  It being my Custom to walk in a Forest adjoining to one of my Father's Sum mer Residences attended only by my Women one Day when I was taking this A musement I perceiv'd at some Distance a Man lying on the Ground and impell'd by a sudden Curiosity I advanc'd towards this Person whom upon a nearer View I perceiv'd to have been wounded very much and fainted away through  Loss of Blood His Habit being very rich I concluded by that he was of no mean Quality But when I had look'd upon his Countenance pale and languishing as it was methought there appear'd so many Marks of Greatness accompany'd with a Sweetness so happily blended that my Attention was engag'd in an extraordinary Manner and interested me so powerfully in his Safety that I commanded some of my Women to run immediately for proper Assistance and convey him to the Castle while I directed others to throw some Water in his Face and to apply some Linen to his Wounds to stop the Bleeding  These charitable Cares restor'd the wounded Stranger to his Senses he open'd his Eyes and turning them slowly to the Objects around him fix'd at last their languishing Looks on me When mov'd as it should seem to some Respect by what he saw in my Countenance he rose with some Difficulty from the Ground and bowing almost down to it again by that Action seem'd to pay me his Acknowledgments for what he suppos'd I had done for his Preservation  His extreme Weakness having oblig'd him to creep towards a Tree against the Back of which he supported himself I went nearer to him and having told him the Condition in which I found him and the Orders I had dispatch'd for Assistance requested him to acquaint me with his Name and Quality and the Adventure which had brought him into that Condition  My Name Madam answer'd he is  Ariamenes  my Birth is Noble enough I have spent some Years in my Travels and was returning  to my native Country when passing thro' this Forest I was seiz'd with an Inclination to sleep I had ty'd my Horse to a Tree and retiring some few Paces off stretch'd myself at the Foot of a large Oak whose Branches promis'd me an agreeable Shade I had not yet clos'd my Eyes when the Slumber I invited was dissipated by the Sound of some Voices near me  A Curiosity not natural to me made me listen to the Discourse of these Persons whom by the Tone of their Voices tho' I could not see them I knew to be Men  In short Madam I was a Witness to a most horrible Scheme which they concerted together my Weakness will not permit me to enter into an exact Detail of all I heard The Result of their Conference was To seize the Princess of this Country and carry her off  Here pursued  Cynecia  I interrupted the Stranger with a loud Cry which giving him to understand who I was he apologiz'd in the most graceful Manner imaginable for the little Respect he had hitherto paid me  I then intreated him to tell me If he had any Opportunity of hearing the Name of my design'd Ravisher to which he reply'd that he understood it to be  Taxander  This Man Madam was one of my Father's Favourites and had been long secretly in Love with me  Ariamenes  then inform'd me that being enflam'd with Rage against these impious Villains he rose from the Ground remounted his Horse and defy'd the two Traytors aloud threatning them with Death unless they abandon'd their impious Design  Taxander  made no Answer but rush'd furiously upon him and had the Biseness to suffer his wicked Associate to assist him But the valiant  Ariamenes  tho' he spoke modestly of his Victory yet gave me to understand that he had made both the Villams abandon their wicked Enterprize with their Lives and that dismounting in order to see if they were quite dead he found himself so faint with the Wounds he had received from them both that he had not Strength to remount his Horse but crawling on in Hopes of meeting with some Assistance sainted away at last through Weariness and Loss of Blood  While he was giving me this Account the Chariot I had sent for arrived and having made him such Acknowledgments as the Obligation I had received from him demanded I caus'd him to get into the Chariot and sending one with him to acquaint the Prince my Father with all that had happen'd and the Merit o  the valiant Stranger I return'd the same Way I came with my Women my Thoughts being wholly engross'd by this Unknown  The Service he had done me fill'd me with a Gratitude and Esteem for him which prepar'd my Heart for those tender Sentiments I afterwards entertain'd to the Ruin of my Repose  I will not tire your Patience Madam with a minute Detail of all the succeeding Passages of my Story it shall suffice to tell you That  Ariamenes  was received with extraordinary Marks of Esteem by my Father that his Cure was soon compleated and that having vow'  himself to my Service and declar'd an unalterable  Passion for me I permitted him to love me and gave him that Share in my Heart which I fear not all his Infidelities will ever deprive him of  His Attachment to me was soon suspected by  Taxander  's Relations who having secretly vow'd his Ruin endeavour'd to discover if I had admitted his Addresses and having made themselves Masters of our Secrets by means of the Treachery of one of my Women procur'd Information to be given to my Father of our mutual Passion  Alas what Mischiefs did not this fatal Discovery produce My Father enrag'd to the last Degree at this Intelligence confin'd me to my Apartments and order'd  Ariamenes  to leave his Dominions within three Days  Spare me Madam the Repetition of what pass'd at our last sad Interview which by large Bribes to my Guards he obtain'd  His Tears his Agonies his Vows of everlasting Fidelity so sooth'd my Melancholy at parting with him and persuaded me of his Constancy that I waited for several Months with perfect Tranquillity for the Performance of the Promise he made me to do my Father such considerable Services in the War he was engag'd in with one of his Neighbours as should oblige him to give me to him for his Reward  But alas two Years roll'd on without bringing back the unfaithful  Ariamenes  My Father died and my Brother who succeeded him being about to force me to marry a Prince whom I detested I secretly quitted the Court and attended only by this faithful Confidant whom  you behold with me and some few of my trusty Domesticks I came hither in Search of  Ariamenes  he having told me this Country was the Place of his Birth  Polenor  the most prudent and faithful of my Servants undertook to find out the ungreateful  Ariamenes  whom yet I was willing to find Excuses for but all his Enquiries were to no Effect the Name of  Ariamenes  was not known in this Part of the World  Tir'd out with unsuccessful Enquiries I resolv'd to seek out some obscure Place where I might in secret lament my Misfortunes and expect the End of them in Death My Attendants found me out such a Retreat as I wanted in a neighbouring Village which they call  Twickenham  I think from whence I often make Excursions to this Park attended only as you see and here indulge myself in Complaints upon the Cruelty of my Destiny  The sorrowful  Cynecia  here ended her Story to which in the Course of her Relation she had given a great many Interruptions through the Violence of her Grief And  Arabella  after having said every thing she could think on to alleviate her Affliction earnestly intreated her to accept of an Asylum at her House where she should be treated with all the Respect due to her illustrious Birth  The afflicted Lady tho' she respectfully declin'd this Offer yet express'd a great Desire of commencing a strict Amity with our fair Heroine who on her Part made her the most tender Protestations of Friendship  The Evening being almost clos'd they parted with great Reluctancy on both Sides mutually promising to meet in the same Place the next Day  Cynecia  having enjoin'd her new Friend absolute Secrecy  Arabella  was under a Necessity of keeping this Adventure to herself And tho' she long'd to tell Mr  Glanville  who came to visit her the next Day that the Countess was extremely mistaken when she maintain'd there were no more wandering Princesses in the World yet the Engagement she had submitted to kept her silent  CHAP V  A very mysterious Chapter  ARABELLA  who impatiently long'd for the Hour of meeting the fair Princess with whom she was extremely delighted consulted her Watch so often and discover'd so much Restlessness and Anxiety that Mr  Glanville  began to be surpriz'd and the more as she peremptorily commanded him not to attend her in her Evening Walk This Prohibition which tho' he durst not dispute he secretly resolv'd to disobey and as soon as she set out for the Park with her usual Attendants he slipp'd out by a Backdoor and keeping her in his Sight himself unseen she ventur'd to watch her Motions  As he had expected to unravel some great Mystery he was agreeably disappointed to find she continu'd her Walk in the Park with great Composure and tho' she was soon join'd by the imaginary Princess yet conceiving her to be some young Lady with whom she had commenc'd an Acquaintance at  Richmond  his Heart was at Rest and for fear of displeasing her he took a contrary Path from that she was in that he might not meet her yet resolv'd to stay till he thought she would be inclin'd to return and then shew himself and conduct her Home A Solicitude for which he did not imagine she need be offended  The two Ladies being met after reciprocal Compliments the Princess intreated  Arabella  to relate her Adventures who not being willing to violate the Laws of Romance which require an unbounded Confidence upon these Occasions began very succinctly to recount the History of her Life which as she manag'd it contain'd Events almost as Romantick and Incredible as any in her Romances winding them up with a Confession that she did not hate Mr  Glanville  whom she acknowledg'd to be one of the most faithful and zealous of Lovers  Cynecia  with a Sigh congratulated her upon the Fidelity of a Lover who by her Description was worthy the Place he possess'd in her Esteem And expressing a Wish that she could see unobserv'd by him this gallant and generous Person  Arabella  who that Moment espy'd him at a Distance yet advancing towards them told her with a Blush that overspread all her Face That her Curiosity might be satisfy'd in  the Manner she wish'd for yonder added she is the Person we have been talking of  Cynecia  at these Words looking towards the Place where her fair Friend had directed no sooner cast her Eyes upon Mr  Glanville  than giving a loud Cry she sunk into the Arms of  Arabella  who astonish'd and perplex'd as she was eagerly held them out to support her  Finding her in a Swoon she dispatch'd  Lucy  who was near her to look for some Water to throw in her Face but that Lady breathing a deep Sigh open'd her languishing Eyes and fixing a melancholy Look upon  Arabella  Ah Madam said she wonder not at my Affliction and Surprize since in the Person of your Lover I behold the ungrateful  Ariamenes  Oh Heav'ns my fair Princess replied  Arabella  What is it you say Is it possible  Glanville  can be  Ariamenes  He cried the afflicted Princess with a disorder'd Accent He whom I now behold and whom you call  Glanville  was once  Ariamenes  the perjur'd the ungrateful  Ariamenes  Adieu Madam I cannot bear this Sight I will hide myself from the World for ever nor need you fear a Rival or an Enemy in the unfortunate  Cynecia  who if possible will cease to love the unfaithful  Ariamenes  and will never hate the beautiful  Arabella  Saying this without giving her Time to answer she took hold of her Confidant by the Arm and went away with so much Swiftness that she was out of sight before  Arabella  was enough recover'd from her Astonishment to be able to intreat her Stay  Our charming Heroine ignorant till now of the true State of her Heart was surpriz'd to find it assaulted at once by all the Passions which attend disappointed Love Grief Rage Jealousy and Despair made so cruel a War in her gentle Bosom that unable either to express or to conceal the strong Emotions with which she was agitated she gave Way to a violent Burst of Tears leaning her Head upon  Lucy  's Shoulder who wept as heartily as her Lady tho' ignorant of the Cause of her Affliction  Mr  Glanville  who was now near enough to take Notice of her Posture came running with eager Heart to see what was the matter when  Arabella  rous'd from her Extacy of Grief by the Sound of his Steps lifted up her Head and seeing him approach  Lucy  cried she trembling with the Violence of her Resentment Tell that Traitor to keep out of my Sight Tell him I forbid him ever to appear before me again And tell him added she with a Sigh that shook her whole tender Frame All that Blood in his Body is too little to wash away his Guilt or to pacify my Indignation  Then hastily turning away she ran towards her other Attendants who were at some Distance and joining her Women proceeded directly Home  Mr  Glanville  amaz'd at this Action was making after her as fast as he could when  Lucy  crossing in his Way cry'd out to him to stop  My Lady said she bid me tell you Traitor  Hey day interrupted  Glanville  What the Devil does the Girl mean  Pray Sir said she let me deliver my Message I shall forget if you speak to me till I have said it allStay let me see What comes next  No more Traitor I hope said  Glanville  Nor Sir said  Lucy  but there was something about washing in Blood and you must keep out of her Sight and not appear before the NationOh dear I have forgot it half My Lady was in such a piteous Taking I forgot it I believe as soon as she said it What shall I do  No Matter said  Glanville  I'll overtake her and ask  No no Sir said  Lucy  Pray don't do that Sir my Lady will be very angry I'll venture to ask her to tell me over again and come back and let you know it  But tell me reply'd  Glanville  Was any thing the Matter with your Lady She was in a piteous Taking you say  Oh dear yes Sir said  Lucy  but I was not bid to say any thing about that To be sure my Lady did cry sadly and sigh'd as if her Heart would break but I don't know what was the Matter with her  Well said  Glanville  excessively shock'd at this Intelligence Go to your Lady I am going HomeYou may bring me her Message to my own Apartment  Lucy  did as she was desir'd and Mr  Glanville  impatient as he was to unravel the Mystery yet dreading lest his Presence should make  Arabella  be guilty of some Extravagance before the Servants who were with her he follow'd slowly after her resolving if possible to procure a private Interview with the lovely Visionary for whose Sorrow tho' he suspected it was owing to some ridiculous Cause he could not help being affected  CHAP VI  Not much plainer than the former  ARABELLA  who had walk'd as fast as her Legs would carry her got Home before  Lucy  could overtake her and retiring to her Chamber gave Way to a fresh Burst of Grief and bewail'd the Infidelity of  Glanville  in Terms befitting a  Clelia  or  Mandana  As soon as she saw  Lucy  enter she started from her Chair with great Emotion  Thou comest said she I know to intercede for that ungrateful Man whose Infidelity I am weak enough to lament But open not thy Mouth I charge thee in his Defence  No indeed Madam said  Lucy  Nor bring me any Account of his Tears his Desparation or his Despair said  Arabella  since questionless he will feign them all to deceive me  Here  Glanville  who had watch'd  Lucy  's coming and had follow'd her into  Arabella  's Apartment appear'd at the Door  Oh Heav'ns cry'd  Arabella  lifting up her fine Eyes Can it be that this disloyal Man unaw'd by the Discovery of his Guilt again presumes to approach me  Dearest Cousin said  Glanville  What is the Meaning of all thisHow have I disoblig'd youWhat is my Offence I beseech you tell me  This Enigmatical Way of speaking upon such Occasions is of great Use in the voluminous  French  Romances since the Doubt and Confusion it is the Cause of both to the Accus'd and Accuser gives Ris  to a great Number of succeding Mistakes and consequently Adventures  Ask the inconstant  Ariamenes  reply'd  Arabella  the Offence of the ungrateful  Glanville  The Betrayer of  Cynecia  can best answer that Question to the Deceiver of  Arabella  And the Guilt of the one can only be compar'd to the Crimes of the other  Good God interrupted Mr  Glanville  fretting excessively What am I to understand by all this On my Soul Madam I don't know the Meaning of one Word you say  Oh Dissembler said  Arabella  Is it thus that thou would'st impose upon my Credulity Does not the Name of  Ariamenes  make thee tremble then And can'st thou hear that of  Cynecia  without Confusion  Dear Lady  Bella  said  Glanville  smiling What are these Names to me  False Man interrupted  Arabella  Dost thou presume to sport with thy Crimes then Are not the Treacheries of  Ariamenes  the Crimes of  Glanville  Could  Ariamenes  be false to the Princess  of  Gaul  and can  Glanville  be innocent towards  Arabella  Mr  Glanville  who had never heard her in his Opinion talk so ridiculously before was so amaz'd at the incomprehensible Stuff she utter'd with so much Emotion that he began to fear her Intellects were really touch'd This Thought gave him a Concern that spread itself in a Moment over his Countenance He gaz'd on her with a fix'd Attention dreading yet wishing she would speak again equally divided between his Hopes that her next Speech would remove his Suspicion and his Fears that it might more confirm them  Arabella  taking Notice of his pensive Posture turn'd away her Head lest by beholding him she should relent and treat him with less Severity than she had intended making at the same Time a Sign to him to be gone  Indeed Lady  Bella  said  Glanville  who understood her perfectly well I cannot leave you in this Temper I must know how I have been so unfortunate as to offend you  Arabella  no longer able to contain herself burst into Tears at this Question With one Hand she made repeated Signs to him to be gone with the other she held her Handkerchief to her Eyes vex'd and asham'd of her Weakness  But Mr  Glanville  excessively shock'd at this Sight instead of leaving her threw himself on his Knees before her and taking her Hand which he tenderly prest to his Lips  Good God my dearest Cousin said he How you distract me by this Behaviour Sure  something extraordinary must be the Matter What can it be that thus afflicts youAm I the Cause of these TearsCan I have offended you so muchSpeak dear MadamLet me know my Crime Yet may I perish if I am conscious of any towards you  Disloyal Man said  Arabella  disengaging her Hand from his Does then the Crime of  Ariamenes  seem so light in thy Apprehension that thou can'st hope to be thought innocent by  Arabella  No no ungrateful Man the unfortunate  Cynecia  shall have no Cause to say that I will triumph in her Spoils I myself will be the Minister of her Revenge and  Glanville  shall suffer for the Crime of  Ariamenes  Who the Devil is this  Ariamenes  cry'd  Glanville  rising in a Passion And why am I to suffer for his Crime pray For Heav'ns Sake dear Cousin don't let your Imagination wander thus Upon my Soul I don't believe there is any such Person as  Ariamenes  in the World  Vile Equivocator said  Arabella Ariamenes  tho' dead to  Cynecia  is alive to the deluded  Arabella  The Crimes of  Ariamenes  are the Guilt of  Glanville  And if the one has made himself unworthy of the Princess of  Gaul  by his Perfidy and Ingratitude the other by his Baseness and Deceit merits nothing but Contempt and Detestation from  Arabella  Frenzy by my Soul cry'd  Glanville  mutteringly between his Teeth This is downright Frenzy What shall I do  Hence from my Presence resum'd  Arabella  false and ungrateful Man persecute me no more with the hateful Offers of thy Love From  this Moment I banish thee from my Thoughts for ever and neither as  Glanville  or as  Ariamenes  will I ever behold thee more  Stay dear Cousin said  Glanville  holding her for she was endeavouring to rush by him unwilling he should see the Tears that had overspread her Face as she pronounc'd those Words hear me I beg you but one Word Who is it you mean by  Ariamenes  Is it meTell me Madam I beseech youThis is some horrid MistakeYou have been impos'd upon by some villainous ArtificeSpeak dear Lady  Bella  Is it me you mean by  Ariamenes  For so your last Words seem'd to hint  Arabella  without regarding what he said struggled violently to force her Hand from his and finding him still earnest to detain her told him with an enrag'd Voice That she would call for Help if he did not unhand her directly  Poor  Glanville  at this Menace submissively dropt her Hand and the Moment she was free she flew out of the Room and locking herself up in her Closet sent her Commands to him by one of her Women whom she call'd to her to leave her Apartment immediately  CHAP VII  Containing indeed no great Matters but being a Prelude to greater  MR  Glanville  who stood fix'd like a Statue in the Place where  Arabella  had left him was rous'd by this Message which tho' palliated  a little by the Girl that deliver'd it who was not quite so punctual as  Lucy  nevertheless fill'd him with extreme Confusion He obey'd however immediately and retiring to his own Apartment endeavour'd to recall to his Memory all Lady  Bella  had said  The Ambiguity of her Style which had led him into a Suspicion he had never entertain'd before her last Words had partly explain'd if as he understood she did she meant him by  Ariamenes  Taking this for granted he easily conceiv'd some Plot grounded on her Romantick Notions had been laid to prepossess her against him  Sir  George  's Behaviour to her rush'd that Moment into his Thoughts He instantly recollected all his Fooleries his History his Letter his Conversation all apparently copied from those Books she was so fond of and probably done with a View to some other Design upon her  These Reflections join'd to his new awak'd Suspicions that he was in Love with her convinc'd him he was the Author of their present Misunderstanding and that he had impos'd some new Fallacy upon  Arabella  in order to promote a Quarrel between them  Fir'd almost to Madness at this Thought he stamp'd about his Room vowing Revenge upon Sir  George  execrating Romances and cursing his own Stupidity for not discovering Sir  George  was his Rival and knowing his plotting Talent not providing against his Artifices  His first Resolutions were to set out immediately for Sir  George  's Seat and force him to confess the Part he had acted against him But a  Moment's Consideration convinc'd him that was not the most probable Place to find him in since it was much more likely he was waiting the Success of his Schemes in  London  or perhaps at  Richmond  Next to satiating his Vengeance the Pleasure of detecting him in such a Manner that he could not possibly deny or palliate his Guilt was next his Heart  He resolv'd therefore to give it out that he was gone to  London  to make Lady  Bella  believe it was in Obedience to her Commands that he had left her with a Purpose not to return till he had clear'd his Innocence but in reality to conceal himself in his own Apartment and see what Effects his reputed Absence would produce  Having thus taken his Resolution he sent for Mr  Roberts  his Father's Steward to whose Care he had entrusted Lady  Bella  in her Retirement and acquainting him with Part of his Apprehensions with Regard to Sir  George  's Attemp  s upon his Cousin he imparted to him his Design of staying conceal'd there in order to discover more effectually those Attempts and to preserve Lady  Bella  from any Consequence of them  Mr  Roberts  approv'd of his Design and assur'd him of his Vigilance and Care both in concealing his Stay and also in giving him Notice of every Thing that pass'd  Mr  Glanville  then wrote a short Billet to  Arabella  expressing his Grief for her Displeasure his Departure in Obedience to her Orders and his Resolution not to appear in her Presence  till he could give her convincing Proofs of his Innocence  This Letter he sent by  Roberts  which  Arabella  condescended to read but would return no Answer  Mr  Glanville  then mounting his Horse which  Roberts  had order'd to be got ready rode away and leaving him at a House he sometimes put up at return'd on Foot and was let in by Mr  Roberts  at the Gardendoor and conducted unseen to his Chamber  While he pass'd that Night and great Part of the next Day meditating on the Treachery of Sir  George  and soothing his Uneasiness with the Hopes of Revenge  Arabella  no less disquieted mus'd on the Infidelity of her Lover the Despair of  Cynecia  and the Impossibility of her ever being happy Then ransacking her Memory for Instances in her Romances of Ladies equally unfortunate with herself she would sometimes compare herself to one Lady sometimes to another adapting their Sentiments and making Use of their Language in her Complaints  Great Part of the Day being spent in this Manner the uneasy Restlessness of her Mind made her wish to see  Cynecia  again She long'd to ask her a hundred Questions about the unfaithful  Ariamenes  which the Suddainess of her Departure and her own Astonishment prevented her from doing when she made that fatal Discovery which had cost her so much Uneasiness  Sometimes a faint Hope would arise in her Mind that  Cynecia  might be mistaken thro' the great Resemblance that possibly was between  Ariamenes  and  Glanville  She remember'd that  Mandana  had been deceiv'd by the Likeness of  Cyrus  to  Spitridates  and concluded that illustrious Prince inconstant because  Spitridates  whom she took for  Cyrus  saw her carry'd away without offering to rescue her  Dwelling with Eagerness upon this Thought because it afforded her a temporary Relief from others more tormenting she resolv'd to go to the Park tho' she had but little Hopes of finding  Cynecia  there supposing it but too probable that the Disturbance which the Sight or fancy'd Sight of  Ariamenes  had given her would confine her for some Days to her Chamber Yet however small the Probability was of meeting with her she could not resist the impatient Desire she felt of going to seek her  Dispensing therefore with the Attendance of any other Servant but  Lucy  she left her Apartment with a Design of resuming her usual Walk when she was met at her stepping out of the Door by Lady  L  's three Daughters who had visited her during her Residence at  Richmond  and another young Lady  These Ladies who to vary the Scene of their Rural Diversions were going to cross over to  Twickenham  and walk there prest Lady  Bella  to accompany them Our melancholy Heroine refus'd them at first but upon their repeated Importunity recollecting that the Princess of  Gaul  had inform'd her she resided there she consented to go in Hopes some favourable Chance might bring her in their Way or discover the Place of her Retreat when she could easily find some Excuse for leaving her Companions and going to her  Mr  Roberts  who according to his Instructions narrowly watch'd  Arabella  's Motions finding she did not command his Attendance as usual resolv'd however to be privately of this Party He had but just Time to run up and acquaint Mr  Glanville  and then follow'd the Ladies at a Distance who taking Boat pass'd over to  Twickenham  which he also did as soon as he saw them landed  CHAP VIII  Which acquaints the Reader with two very extraordinary Accidents  MR  Glanville  who did not doubt but  Roberts  would bring him some Intelligence sat waiting with anxious Impatience for his Return The Evening drew on apace he number'd the Hours and began to grow uneasy at  Arabella  's long Stay His Chamber Window looking into the Garden he thought he saw his Cousin cover'd with her Veil as usual hasten down one of the Walks his Heart leap'd at this transient View he threw up the Sash and looking out saw her very plainly strike into a cross Walk and a Moment after saw Sir  George  who came out of a little Summerhouse at her Feet Transported with Rage at this Sight he snatch'd up his Sword flew down the Stairs into the Garden and came running like a Madman up the Walk in which the Lovers were The Lady observing him first for Sir  George  's Back was towards  him shriek'd aloud and not knowing what she did ran towards the House crying for Help and came back as fast yet not Time enough to prevent Mischief For Mr  Glanville  actuated by an irresistible Fury cry'd out to Sir  George  to defend himself who had but just Time to draw his Sword and make an ineffectual Pass at Mr  Glanville  when he receiv'd his into his Body and fell to the Ground  Mr  Glanville  losing his Resentment insensibly at the Sight of his Rival's Blood threw down his Sword and endeavour'd to support him while the Lady who had lost her Veil in her running and to the great Astonishment of Mr  Glanville  prov'd to be his Sister came up to them with Tears and Exclamations blaming herself for all that had happen'd Mr  Glanville  with a Heart throbbing with Remorse for what he had done gaz'd on his Sister with an accusing Look as she hung over the wounded Baronet with streaming Eyes sometimes wringing her Hands then clasping them together in an Agony of Grief  Sir  George  having Strength enough left to observe her Disorder and the generous Concern of  Glanville  who holding him in his Arms intreated his Sister to send for proper Assistance Dear  Charles  said he you are too kind I have us'd you very ill I have deserv'd my Death from your HandYou know not what I have been base enough to practise against you If I can but live to clear your Innocence to Lady  Bella  and free you from the Consequences of this Action I shall die satisfy'd  His Strength failing him at these Words he fainted away in Mr  Glanville  's Arms who tho' now convinc'd of his Treachery was extremely shock'd at the Condition he saw him in  Miss  Glanville  renewing her Tears and Exclamations at this Sight he was oblig'd to lay Sir  George  gently upon the Ground and ran to find out somebody to send for a Surgeon and to help him to convey him into the House  In his Way he was met by Mr  Roberts  who was coming to seek him and with a Look of Terror and Confusion told him Lady  Bella  was brought Home extremely illthat her Life had been in Danger and that she was but just recover'd from a terrible fainting Fit  Mr  Glanville  tho' greatly alarm'd at this News forgot not to take all possible Care of Sir  George  directing  Roberts  to get some Person to carry him into the House and giving him Orders to procure proper Assistance flew to Lady  Bella  's Apartment  Her Women had just put her to Bed raving as in a strong Delirium Mr  Glanville  approach'd her and finding she was in a violent Fever dispatch'd a Man and Horse immediately to Town to get Physicians and to acquaint his Father with what had happen'd  Mr  Roberts  upon the Surgeon's Report that Sir  George  was not mortally wounded came to inform him of this good News but he sound him incapable of listning to him and in Agonies not to be exprest 'Twas with Difficulty they forc'd him out of  Arabella  's Chamber into his own where throwing himself upon his  he refus'd to see or speak to any Body till  he was told Sir  Charles  and the Physicians were arriv'd  He then ran eagerly to hear their Opinions of his beloved Cousin which he soon discover'd by their significant Gestures and half pronounc'd Words to be very bad They comforted him however with Hopes that she might recover and insisting upon her being kept very quiet oblig'd him to quit the Room While all the necessary Methods were taken to abate the Violence of the Disease Sir  Charles  who had been inform'd by his Steward of his Son's Duel with Sir  George  was amaz'd to the last Degree at two such terrible Accidents  Having seen his Son to his Chamber and recommended him to be patient and compos'd he went to visit the young Baronet and was not a little surpriz'd to find his Daughter sitting at his Bed's Head with all the Appearance of a violent Affliction  Indeed Miss  Glanville  's Cares were so wholly engross'd by Sir  George  's that she hardly ever thought of her Cousin  Arabella  and had just stept into her Chamber while the Surgeons were dressing Sir  George  's Wound and renew'd her Attendance upon him as soon as that was over  Miss  Glanville  however thought proper to make some trifling Excuses to her Father for her Solicitude about Sir  George  And the young Baronet on whom the Fear of Death produc'd its usual Effects and made him extremely concern'd for the Errors of his past Life and very desirous of attoning for them if possible assur'd Sir  Charles  that if he liv'd he  would offer himself to his Acceptance for a Soninlaw declaring that he had basely trifled with the Esteem of his Daughter but that she had wholly subdued him to herself by her forgiving Tenderness  Sir  Charles  was very desirous of knowing the Occasion of his Quarrel with his Son but Sir  George  was too weak to hold any further Conversation upon which Sir  Charles  after a short Visit retir'd taking Miss  Glanville  along with him  That the Reader whose Imagination is no doubt upon the Stretch to conceive the Meaning of these Two extraordinary Incidents may be left no longer in Suspence we think proper to explain them both in the following Chapter that we may in the next pursue our History without Interruption  CHAP IX  Which will be found to contain Information absolutely necessary for the right understanding of this History  OUR fair and afflicted Heroine accompanied by the Ladies we have mention'd having cross'd the River pursu'd their Walk upon its winding Banks entertaining themselves with the usual Topicks of Conversation among young Ladies such as their Winnings and Losings at  Brag  the Prices of Silks the newest Fashions the best HairCutter the Scandal at the last Assembly  c  Arabella  was so disgusted with this as she thought insipid Discourse which gave no Relief to the Anxiety of her Mind but added a Kind of Fretfulness and Impatience to her Grief that she resolv'd to quit them and with  Lucy  go in quest of the Princess of  Gaul  's Retreat  The Ladies however insisted upon her not leaving them and her Excuse that she was going in search of an unfortunate Unknown for whom she had vow'd a Friendship made them all immediately resolve to accompany her extremely diverted with the Oddity of the Design and sacrificing her to their Mirth by sly Leers Whispers stifled Laughs and a thousand little sprightly Sallies which the disconsolate  Arabella  took no Notice of so deeply were her Thoughts engag'd  Tho' she knew not which Way to direct her Steps yet concluding the melancholy  Cynccia  would certainly chuse some very solitary Place for her Residence she rambled about among the least frequented Paths follow'd by the young Ladies who ardently desir'd to see this unfortunate Unknown tho' at  Arabella  's earnest Request they promis'd not to shew themselves to the Lady who she inform'd them for very urgent Reasons was oblig'd to keep herself conceal'd  Fatiguing as this Ramble was to the delicate Spirits of  Arabella  's Companions they were enabled to support it by the Diversion her Behaviour afforded them  Every Peasant she met she enquir'd if a Beautiful Lady disguis'd did not  thereabout  To some she gave a Description of her Person to others an Account of the Domesticks that were with her not forgetting her Dress her Melancholy and the great Care she took to keep herself conceal'd  These strange Enquiries with the strange Language in which they were made not a little surpriz'd the good People to whom she address'd herself yet mov'd to Respect by the majestick Loveliness of her Person they answer'd her in the Negative without any Mixture of Scoff and Impertinence  How unfavourable is Chance said  Arabella  fretting at the Disappointment to Persons who have any Reliance upon it This Lady that I have been in Search of so long without Success may probably be found by others who do not seek her whose Presence she may wish to avoid yet not be able  The young Ladies finding it grew late express'd their Apprehensions at being without any Attendants and desir'd  Arabella  to give over her Search for that Day  Arabella  at this Hint of Danger enquir'd very earnestly If they apprehended any Attempts to carry them away And without staying for an Answer urg'd them to walk Home as fast as possible apologizing for the Danger into which she had so indiscreetly drawn both them and herself yet added her Hopes that if any Attempt should be made upon their Liberty some generous Cavalier would pass by who would rescue them A Thing so common that they had no Reason to despair of it  Arabella  construing the Silence with which her Companions heard these Assurances into a Doubt of their being so favoured by Fortune proceeded to inform them of several Instances wherein Ladies met with unexpected Relief and Deliverance from Ravishers  She mention'd particularly the Rescue of  Statira  by her own Brother whom she imagin'd for many Years dead that of the Princess  Berenice  by an absolute Stranger and many others whose Names Characters and Adventures she occasionally run over all which the young Ladies heard with inconceivable Astonishment And the Detail had such an Effect upon  Arabella  's Imagination bewilder'd as i  was in the Folies of Romances that 'spying three or four Horsemen riding along the Road towards them she immediately concluded they would be all seiz'd and carry'd off  Possess'd with this Belief she utter'd a loud Cry and flew to the Waterside which alarming the Ladies who could not imagine what was the Matter they ran after her as fast as possible  Arabella  stop'd when she came to the Waterside and looking round about and not perceiving any Boat to waft them over to  Richmond  a Thought suddenly darted into her Mind worthy those ingenious Books which gave it Birth  Turning therefore to the Ladies who all at once were enquiring the Cause of her Fright  'Tis now my fair Companions said she with a solemn Accent that the Destinies have  furnish'd you with an Opportunity of displaying in a Manner truly Heroick the Sublimity of your Virtue and the Grandeur of your Courage to the World  The Action we have it in our Power to perform will immortalize our Fame and raise us to a Pitch of Glory equal to that of the renown'd  Clelia  herself  Like her we may expect Statues erected to our Honour Like her be propos'd as Patterns to Heroines in ensuing Ages And like her perhaps meet with Sceptres and Crowns for our Reward  What that beauteous  Roman  Lady perform'd to preserve herself from Violation by the impious  Sextus  let us imitate to avoid the Violence our intended Ravishers yonder come to offer us  Fortune which has thrown us into this Exigence presents us the Means of gloriously escaping And the Admiration and Esteem of all Ages to come will be the Recompence of our noble Daring  Once more my fair Companions If your Honour be dear to you if an immortal Glory be worth your seeking follow the Example I shall set you and equal with me the  Roman Clelia  Saying this she plung'd into the  Thames  intending to swim over it as  Clelia  did the  Tyber  The young Ladies who had listen'd with silent Astonishment at the long Speech she had made them the Purport of which not one of them understood scream'd out aloud at this  horrid Spectacle and wringing their Hands ran backwards and forwards like distracted Persons crying for Help  Lucy  tore her Hair and was in the utmost Agony of Grief when Mr  Roberts  who as we have said before kept them always in Sight having observ'd  Arabella  running towards the Waterside follow'd them as fast as he could and came Time enough up to see her frantick Action Jumping into the River immediately after her he caught hold of her Gown and drew her after him to the Shore A Boat that Instant appearing he put her into it senseless and to all Appearance dead He and  Lucy  supporting her they were wasted over in a few Moments to the other Side Her House being near the River Mr  Roberts  carry'd her in his Arms to it and as soon as he saw her shew Signs of returning Life left her to the Care of the Women who made haste to put her into a warm Bed and ran to find out Mr  Glanville  as we have related  There remains now only to account for Sir  George  and Miss  Glanville  's sudden Appearance which happen'd gentle Reader exactly as follows  Miss  Glanville  having set out pretty late in the Afternoon with a Design of staying all Night at  Richmond  as her Chaise drove up  KewLane  saw one of her Cousin's Women  Deborah  by Name talking to a Gentleman whom notwithstanding the Disguise of a Horseman's Coat and a Hat slouch'd over his Face she knew to be Sir  George Bellmour  This Sight alarming her Jealousy and renewing all her former Suspicions that her Cousin's Charms rival'd hers in his Heart as soon as she alighted finding  Arabella  was not at Home she retir'd in great Anguish of Mind to her Chamber revolving in her Mind every Particular of Sir  George  's Behaviour to her Cousin in the Country and finding new Cause for Suspicion in every Thing she recollected and reflecting upon the Disguise in which she saw him and his Conference with her Woman she concluded herself had all along been the Dupe of his Artifice and her Cousin the real Object of his Love  This Thought throwing her into an Extremity of Rage all her tenderest Emotions were lost in the Desire of Revenge She imagin'd to herself so much Pleasure from exposing his Treachery and putting it our of his Power to deny it that she resolv'd whatever it cost her to have that Satisfaction  Supposing therefore  Deborah  was now return'd she rung her Bell and commanded her Attendance on her in her Chamber  The Stern Brow with which she receiv'd her frighten'd the Girl conscious of her Guilt into a Disposition to confess all even before she was tax'd with any thing  Miss  Glanville  saw her Terror and endeavour'd to heighten it by entering at once into Complaints and Exclamations against her threatning to acquaint her Father with her Plots to betray her Lady and assuring her of a very severe Punishment for her Treachery  The Girl terrify'd extremely at these Menaces begg'd Miss  Glanville  with Tears to forgive her and not to acquaint Sir  Charles  or her Lady with her Fault adding that she would confess all and never while she liv'd do such a Thing again  Miss  Glanville  would make her no Promises but urg'd her to confess Upon which  Deborah  sobbing own'd That for the Sake of the Presents Sir  George  had made her she consented to meet him privately from Time to Time and give him an Account of every Thing that pass'd with Regard to her Lady not thinking there was any Harm in it That according to his Desires she had constantly acquainted him with all her Lady's Motions when and where she went how she and Mr  Glanville  agreed and a hundred other Things which he enquir'd about That that Day in particular he had intreated her to procure him the M  ans of an Interview with her Lady if possible and understanding Mr  Glanville  was not at  Richmond  she had let him privately into the Garden where she hop'd to prevail upon her Lady to go  What said Miss  Glanville  surpriz'd Is Sir  George  waiting for my Cousin in the Garden then  Yes indeed Madam said  Deborah  But I'll go and tell him to wait no longer and never speak to him again if your Ladyship will but be pleas'd to forgive me  Miss  Glanville  having taken her Resolution not only promis'd  Deborah  her Pardon but also  a Reward provided she would contrive it so that she might meet Sir  George  instead of her Cousin  The Girl having the true ChamberMaid Spirit of Intrigue in her immediately propos'd her putting on one of her Lady's Veils which as it was now the Close of the Evening would disguise her sufficiently to which Miss  Glanville  transported with the Thoughts of thus having an Opportunity of convincing Sir  George  of his Perfidy and reproaching him for it consented and bid her bring it without being observ'd into her Chamber  Deborah  informing her that Sir  George  was conceal'd in the SummerHouse as soon as she had equipp'd herself with  Arabella  's Veil she went into the Walk that led to it and Sir  George  believing her to be that Lady hasten'd to throw himself at her Feet and had scarce got through half a Speech he had study'd for his present Purpose when Mr  Glanville  gave a fatal Interruption to his Heroicks in the Manner we have already related  CHAP X  A short Chapter indeed but full of Matter  RICHMOND  was now a Scene of the utmost Confusion and Distress  Arabella  's Fever was risen to such a Height that she was  given over by the Physicians and Sir  George  's Wounds tho' not judg'd mortal at first yet by the great Effusion of Blood had left him in so weak a Condition that he was thought to be in great Danger  Sir  Charles  almost distracted with the Fears of the Consequences of Sir  George  's Death intreated his Son to quit the Kingdom but Mr  Glanville  protesting he would rather die than leave  Arabella  in that Illness he was oblig'd to give Bail for his Appearance in Case Sir  George  dy'd This Affair notwithstanding all Endeavours to prevent it having made a great Noise  Poor Sir  Charles  opprest as he was with the Weight of all these Calamities was yet oblig'd to labour incessantly to keep up the Spirits of his Son and Daughter The settled Despair of the one and the silent swelling Grief of the other cut him to the Heart He omitted no Arguments his Paternal Affection suggested to him to moderate their Affliction Mr  Glanville  often endeavour'd to assume a Composure he was very far from feeling in order to satisfy his Father But Miss  Glanville  looking upon herself to be the Cause of Sir  George  's Misfortune declar'd She should be miserable all her Life if he died  Arabella  in her lucid Intervals being sensible of her Danger prepar'd for Death with great Piety and Constancy of Mind having solemnly assur'd Mr  Glanville  of her Forgiveness who would not at that Time enter into an Explanation  of the Affair which had given her Offence for fear of perplexing her She permitted his Presence often in her Chamber and desir'd with great Earnestness the Assistance of some worthy Divine in her Preparations for Death The Pious and Learned Doctorat Sir  Charles  's Intimation of his Niece's Desire came constantly twice a Day to attend her Her Fever by a favourable Crisis and the great Skill of her Physicians left her in a Fortnight but this violent Distemper had made such a Ravage in her delicate Constitution and reduc'd her so low that there seem'd very little Probability of her Recovery Doctor in whom her unfeign'd Piety her uncommon Firmness of Mind had created a great Esteem and Tenderness for her took all Opportunities of comforting exhorting and praying by her The Occasion of her Illness being the Subject of every body's Conversation at  Richmond  he gently hinted it to her and urg'd her to explain her Reasons for so extravagant an Action  In the Divine Frame  Arabella  was then in this Action appear'd to her rash and vainglorious and she acknowledg'd it to be so to her pious Monitor Yet she related the Motives which induc'd her to it the Danger she was in of being carry'd away the Parity of her Circumstances then with  Clelia  and her emulous Desire of doing as much to preserve her Honour as that renown'd  Roman  Lady did for hers  The good Doctor was extremely surpriz'd at this Discourse He was beginning to think her  again delirious but  Arabella  added to this Account such sensible Reasoning on the Nature of that Fondness for Fame which prompted her to so rash an Undertaking that the Doctor left her in strange Embarrassment not knowing how to account for a Mind at once so enlighten'd and so ridiculous  Mr  Glanville  meeting him as he came out of her Chamber the Doctor took this Opportunity to acknowledge the Difficulties  Arabella  's inconsistent Discourse had thrown him into Mr  Glanville  taking him into his own Apartment explain'd the Nature of that seeming Inconsistency and expatiated at large upon the Disorders Romances had occasion'd in her Imagination several Instances of which he recounted and fill'd the Doctor with the greatest Astonishment and Concern He lamented pathetically the Ruin such a ridiculous Study had brought on so noble a Mind and assur'd Mr  Glanville  he would spare no Endeavours to rescue it from so shocking a Delusion  Mr  Glanville  thank'd him for his good Design with a Transport which his Fears of his Cousin's Danger almost mingled with Tears and the Doctor and he agreed to expect for some few Days longer an Alteration for the better in the Health of her Body before he attempted the Cure of her Mind Mr  Glanville  's extreme Anxiety had made him in Appearance neglect the repentant Sir  George  contenting himself with constantly sending twice a Day to enquire after his Health but had not yet visited him  No sooner had the Physicians declared that  Arabella  was no longer in Danger than his Mind being freed from that tormenting Load of Suspence under which it had labour'd while her Recovery was yet doubful he went to Sir  George  's Chamber who by reason of his Weakness tho' he was also upon the Recovery still kept his Bed  Sir  George  tho' he ardently wish'd to see him yet conscious of the Injuries he had both done and design'd him could not receive his Visit without extreme Confusion But entering into the Cause of their Quarrel as soon as he was able to speak he freely acknowledg'd his Fault and all the Steps he had taken to supplant him in  Arabella  's Affection  Mr  Glanville  understanding by this Means that he had brib'd a young Actress to personate a Princess forsaken by him and had taught her all that Heap of Absurdity with which she had impos'd upon  Arabella  as has been related desir'd only by Way of Reparation That when his Cousin was in a Condition to be spoken to upon that Subject he would condescend to own the Fraud to her which Sir  George  faithfully promising an Act of Oblivion pass'd on Mr  Glanville  's Side for all former Injuries and a solemn Assurance from Sir  George  of inviolable Friendship for the future An Assurance however which Mr  Glanville  would willingly have dispens'd with For tho' not of a vindictive Temper it was one of his Maxims That a Man who had once betray'd him it would be an Error in Policy ever to trust again  CHAP XI  Being in the Author's Opinion the best Chapter in this History  THE good Divine who had the Cure of  Arabella  's Mind greatly at Heart no sooner perceiv'd that the Health of her Body was almost restor'd and that he might talk to her without the Fear of any Inconvenience than he introduc'd the Subject of her throwing herself into the River which he had before lightly touch'd upon and still declar'd himself dissatisfy'd with  Arabella  now more dispos'd to defend this Point than when languishing under the Pressure of Pain and Dejection of Mind endeavour'd by Arguments founded upon Romantick Heroism to prove That it was not only reasonable and just but also great and glorious and exactly conformable to the Rules of Heroick Virtue  The Doctor listen'd to her with a mix'd Emotion between Pity Reverence and Amazement And tho' in the Performance of his Office he had been accustom'd to accommodate his Notions to every Understanding and had therefore accumulated a great Variety of Topicks and Illustrations yet he found himself now engag'd in a Controversy for which he was not so well prepar'd as he imagin'd and was at  a Loss for some leading Principle by which he might introduce his Reasonings and begin his Confutation  Tho' he saw much to praise in her Discourse he was afraid of confirming her Obstinacy by Commendation And tho' he also found much to blame he dreaded to give Pain to a Delicacy he rever'd  Perceiving however that  Arabella  was silent as if expecting his Reply he resolv'd not to bring upon himself the Guilt of abandoning her to her Mistake and the Necessity of speaking forc'd him to find something to say  Tho' it is not easy Madam said he for any one that has the Honour of conversing with your Ladyship to preserve his Attention free to any other Idea than such as your Discourse tends immediately to impress yet I have not been able while you was speaking to refrain from some very mortifying Reflections on the Imperfection of all human Happiness and the uncertain Consequences of all those Advantages which we think ourselves not only at Liberty to desire but oblig'd to cultivate  Tho' I have known some Dangers and Distresses reply'd  Arabella  gravely yet I did not imagine myself such a Mirror of Calamity as could not be seen without Concern If my Life has not been eminently fortunate it has yet escap'd the great Evils of Persecution Captivity Shipwrecks and Dangers to which many Ladies far more Illustrious both by Birth and Merit than myself have been expos'd And indeed  tho' I have sometimes rais'd Envy or possibly incurr'd Hatred yet I have no Reason to believe I was ever beheld with Pity before  The Doctor saw he had not introduc'd his Discourse in the most acceptable Manner but it was too late to repent  Let me not Madam said he be censur'd before I have fully explain'd my Sentiments  That you have been envy'd I can readily believe For who that gives Way to natural Passions has not Reason to envy the Lady  Arabella  But that you have been hated I am indeed less willing to think tho' I know how easily the greater Part of Mankind hate those by whom they are excell'd  If the Misery of my Condition reply'd  Arabella  has been able to excite that Melancholy your first Words seem'd to imply Flattery will contribute very little towards the Improvement of it Nor do I expect from the Severity of the Sacerdotal Character any of those Praises which I hear perhaps with too much Pleasure from the rest of the World  Having been so lately on the Brink of that State in which all Distinctions but that of Goodness are destroy'd I have not recover'd so much Laevity but that I would yet rather hear Instructions than Compliments  If therefore you have observ'd in me any dangerous Tenets corrupt Passions or criminal Desires I conjure you discover me to myself Let no false Civility restrain your Admonitions Let me know this Evil which can  strike a good Man with Horror and which I dread the more as I do not feel it  I cannot suppose that a Man of your Order would be alarm'd at any other Misery than Guilt Nor will I think so meanly of him whose Direction I have intreated as to imagine he can think Virtue unhappy however overwhelm'd by Disasters or Oppression  Keep me therefore no longer in Suspence I expect you will exert the Authority of your Function and I promise you on my Part Sincerity and Submission  The good Man was now compleatly embarrass'd he saw his Meaning mistaken but was afraid to explain it left he should seem to pay Court by a cowardly Retraction He therefore paus'd a little and  Arabella  supposed he was studying for such Expressions as might convey Censure without Offence  Sir said she if you are not yet satisfy'd of my Willingness to hear your Reproofs let me evince my Docility by intreating you to consider yourself as dispens'd from all Ceremony upon this Occasion  Your Imaginations Madam reply'd the Doctor are too quick for Language you conjecture too soon what you do not wait to hear and reason upon Suppositions which cannot be allow'd you  When I mention'd my Reflections upon human Misery I was far from concluding your Ladyship miserable compar'd with the rest of Mankind and though contemplating the abstracted  Idea of possible Felicity I thought that even You might be produc'd as an Instance that it is not attainable in this World I did not impute the Imperfection of your State to Wickedness but intended to observe That though even Virtue be added to external Advantages there will yet be something wanting to Happiness  Whoever sees you Madam will immediately say That nothing can hinder you from being the happiest of Mortals but Want of Power to understand your own Advantages And whoever is admitted to your Conversation will be convinc'd that you enjoy all that Intellectual Excellence can confer yet I see you harrass'd with innumerable Terrors and Perplexities which never disturb the Peace of Poverty of Ignorance  I cannot discover said  Arabella  how Poverty or Ignorance can be privileg'd from Casualty or Violence from the Ravisher the Robber or the Enemy I should hope rather that if Wealth and Knowledge can give nothing else they at least confer Judgment to foresee Danger and Power to oppose it  They are not indeed return'd the Doctor secur'd against real Misfortunes but they are happily defended from wild Imaginations They do not suspect what cannot happen nor figure Ravishers at a Distance and leap into Rivers to escape them  Do you suppose then said  Arabella  that I was frighted without Cause  It is certain Madam reply'd he that no Injury was intended you  Disingennuity Sir said  Arabella  does not become a ClergymanI think too well of your Understanding to imagine your Fallacy deceives yourself Why then should you hope that it will deceive me  The Laws of Conference require that the Terms of the Question and Answer be the same  I ask if I had not Cause to be frighted Why then am I answer'd that no Injury was intended  Human Beings cannot penetrate Intentions nor regulate their Conduct but by exterior Appearances And surely there was sufficient Appearance of intended Injury and that the greatest which my Sex can suffer  Why Madam said the Doctor should you still persist in so wild an Assertion  A coarse Epithet said  Arabella  is no Confutation It rests upon you to shew That in giving Way to my Fears even supposing them groundless I departed from the Character of a reasonable Person  I am afraid replied the Doctor of a Dispute with your Ladyship not because I think myself in Danger of Defeat but because being accustom'd to speak to Scholars with Scholastick Ruggedness I may perhaps depart in the Heat of Argument from that Respect to which you have so great a Right and give Offence to a Person I am really afraid to displease  But if you will promise to excuse my Ardour I will endeavour to prove that you have been frighted without Reason  I should be content replied  Arabella  to obtain Truth upon harder Terms and therefore intreat you to begin  The Apprehension of any future Evil Madam said the Divine which is called Terror when the Danger is from natural Causes and Suspicion when it proceeds from a moral Agent must always arise from Comparison  We can judge of the Future only by the Past and have therefore only Reason to fear or suspect when we see the same Causes in Motion which have formerly produc'd Mischief or the same Measures taken as have before been preparatory to a Crime  Thus when the Sailor in certain Latitudes sees the Clouds rise Experience bids him expect a Storm When any Monarch levies Armies his Neighbours prepare to repel an Invasion  This Power of Prognostication may by Reading and Conversation be extended beyond our own Knowledge And the great Use of Books is that of participating without Labour or Hazard the Experience of others  But upon this Principle how can you find any Reason for your late Fright  Has it ever been known that a Lady of your Rank was attack'd with such Intentions in a Place so publick without any  Preparations made by the Violator for Defence or Escape  Can it be imagin'd that any Man would so rashly expose himself to Infamy by Failure and to the Gibbet by Success  Does there in the Records of the World appear a single Instance of such hopeless Villany  It is now Time Sir said  Arabella  to answer your Questions before they are too many to be remembered  The Dignity of my Birth can very little defend me against an Insult to which the Heiresses of great and powerful Empires the Daughters of valiant Princes and the Wives of renowned Monarchs have been a thousand Times exposed  The Danger which you think so great would hardly repel a determin'd Mind for in Effect Who would have attempted my Rescue seeing that no Knight or valiant Cavalier was within View  What then should have hinder'd him from placing me in a Chariot Driving it into the pathless Desart And immuring me in a Castle among Woods and Mountains Or hiding me perhaps in the Caverns of a Rock Or confining me in some Island of an immense Lake  From all this Madam interrupted the Clergyman he is hinder'd by Impossibility  He cannot carry you to any of these dreadful Places because there is no such Castle Desart Cavern or Lake  You will pardon me Sir said  Arabella  it I recur to your own Principles  You allow that Experience may be gain'd by Books And certainly there is no Part of Knowledge in which we are oblig'd to trust them more than in Descriptive Geography  The most restless Activity in the longest Life can survey but a small Part of the habitable Globe And the rest can only be known from the Report of others  Universal Negatives are seldom safe and are least to be allow'd when the Disputes are about Objects of Sense where one Position cannot be inferr'd from another  That there is a Castle any Man who has seen it may safely affirm But you cannot with equal Reason maintain that there is no Castle because you have not seen it  Why should I imagine that the Face of the Earth is alter'd since the Time of those Heroines who experienc'd so many Changes of uncouth Captivity  Castles indeed are the Works of Art and are therefore subject to Decay But Lakes and Caverns and Desarts must always remain  And why since you call for Instances should I not dread the Misfortunes which happen'd  to the divine  Clelia  who was carry'd to one of the Isles of the  Thrasymenian  Lake  Or those which befel the beautiful  Candace  Queen of  Ethiopia  whom the Pyrate  Zenodonus  wander'd with on the Seas  Or the Accidents which imbitter'd the Life of the incomparable  Cleopatra  Or the Persecutions which made that of the fair  Elisa  miserable  Or in fine the various Distresses of many other fair and virtuous Princesses Such as those which happen'd to  Olympia Bellamira Parisatis Berenice Amalagantha Agione Albysinda Placidia A  sinoe Deidamia  and a thousand others I could mention  To the Names of many of these illustrious Sufferers I am an absolute Stranger replied the Doctor  The rest I saintly remember some Mention of in those contemptible Volumes with which Children are sometimes injudiciously suffer'd to amuse their Imaginations but which I little expected to hear quoted by your Ladyship in a serious Discourse  And though I am very far from catching Occasions of Resentment yet I think myself at Liberty to observe That if I merited your Censure for one indelicate Epithet we have engag'd on very unequal Terms if I may not likewise complain of such contemptuous Ridicule as you are pleas'd to exercise upon my Opinions by opposing them with the Authority of Scribblers not only of Fictions  but of senseless Fictions which at once vitiate the Mind and pervert the Unstanderstanding and which if they are at any Time read with Safety owe their Innocence only to their Absurdity  From these Books Sir said  Arabella  which you condemn with so much Ardour though you acknowledge yourself little acquainted with them I have learnt not to recede from the Conditions I have granted and shall not therefore censure the Licence of your Language which glances from the Books upon the Readers  These Books Sir thus corrupt thus obsurd thus dangerous alike to the Intellect and Morals I have read and that I hope without Injury to my Judgment or my Virtue  The Doctor whose Vehemence had hinder'd him from discovering all the Consequences of his Position now found himself entangled and reply'd in a submissive Tone  I confess Madam my Words imply an Accusation very remote from my Intention  It has always been the Rule of my Life not to justify any Words or Actions because they mine  I am asham'd of my Negligence I am sorry for my Warmth and intreat your Ladyship to pardonâ–ª a Fault which I hope never to repeat  The Reparation Sir said  Arabella  smiling overbalances the Offence and by thus daring  to own you have been in the Wrong you have rais'd in me a much higher Esteem for you  Yet I will not pardon you added she without enjoining you a Penance for the Fault you own you have committed and this Penance shall be to prove  First That these Histories you condemn are Fictions  Next That they are absurd  And Lastly That they are Criminal  The Doctor was pleas'd to find a Reconciliation offer'd upon so very easy Terms with a Person whom he beheld at once with Reverence and Affection and could not offend without extreme Regret  He therefore answered with a very chearful Composure  To prove those Narratives to be Fictions Madam is only difficult because the Position is almost too evident for Proof  Your Ladyship knows I suppose to what Authors these Writings are ascrib'd  To the  French  Wits of the last Century said  Arabella  And at what Distance Madam are the Facts related in them from the Age of the Writer  I was never exact in my Computation replied  Arablela  but I think most of the Events happen'd about two thousand Years ago  How then Madam resum'd the Doctor could these Events be so minutely known to  Writers so far remote from the Time in which they happen'd  By Records Monuments Memoirs and Histories answered the Lady  But by what Accident then said the Doctor smiling did it happen these Records and Monuments were kept universally secret to Mankind till the last Century  What brought all the Memoirs of the remotest Nations and earliest Ages only to  France  Where were they hidden that none could consult them but a few obscure Authors  And whither are they now vanished again that they can be found no more  Arabella  having sat silent a while told him That she found his Questions very difficult to be answer'd and that though perhaps the Authors themselves could have told whence they borrowed their Materials she should not at present require any other Evidence of the first Assertion  But allow'd him to suppose them Fictions and requir'd now that he should shew them to be absurd  Your Ladyship return'd he has I find too much Understanding to struggle against Demonstration and too much Veracity to deny your Convictions therefore some of the Arguments by which I intended to shew the Falshood of these Narratives may be now used to prove their Absurdity  You grant them Madam to be Fictions  Sir interrupted  Arabella  eagerly You are again infringing the Laws of Disputation  You are not to confound a Supposition of which I allow you only the present Use with an unlimited and irrevocable Concession  I am too well acquainted with my own Weakness to conclude an Opinion false merely because I find myself unable to defend it  But I am in haste to hear the Proof of the other Positions not only because they may perhaps supply what is deficient in your Evidence of the first but because I think it of more Importance to detect Corruption than Fiction  Though indeed Falshood is a Species of Corruption and what Falshood is more hateful than the Falshood of History  Since you have drawn me back Madam to the first Question returned the Doctor Let me know what Arguments your Ladyship can produce for the Veracity of these Books  That there are many Objections against it you yourself have allowed and the highest moral Evidence of Falshood appears when there are many Arguments against an Assertion and none for it  Sir replied  Arabella  I shall never think that any Narrative which is not confuted by its own Absurdity is without one Argument at least on its Side there is a Love of Truth in the human Mind if not naturally implanted so easily obtained from Reason and Experience that I should expect it universally to prevail where there is no strong Temptation to Deceit we hate to be deceived we therefore hate those that deceive us we desire not to be hated and therefore know that we are not to deceive Shew me an equal Motive to Falshood or confess that every Relation has some Right to Credit  This may be allowed Madam said the Doctor when we claim to be credited but that seems not to be the Hope or Intention of these Writers  Surely Sir replied  Arabella  you must mistake their Design he that writes without Intention to be credited must write to little Purpose for what Pleasure or Advantage can arise from Facts that never happened What Examples can be afforded by the Patience of those who never suffered or the Chastity of those who were never solicited The great End of History is to shew how much human Nature can endure or perform When we hear a Story in common Life that raises our Wonder or Compassion the first Confutation stills our Emotions and however we were touched before we then chase it from the Memory with Contempt as a Trifle or with Indignation as an Imposture Prove therefore that the Books which I have hitherto read as  Copies of Life and Models of Conduct are empty Fictions and from this Hour I deliver them to Moths and Mould and from this Time consider their Authors as Wretches who cheated me of those Hours I ought to have dedicated to Application and Improvement and betrayed me to a Waste of those Years in which I might have laid up Knowledge for my future Life  Shakespear  said the Doctor calls just Resentment the Child of Integrity and therefore I do not wonder that what Vehemence the Gentleness of your Ladyship's Temper allows should be exerted upon this Occasion Yet though I cannot forgive these Authors for having destroyed so much valuable Time yet I cannot think them intentionally culpable because I cannot believe they expected to be credited Truth is not always injured by Fiction An admirable  Richardson  Writer of our own Time has found the Way to convey the most solid Instructions the noblest Sentiments and the most exalted Piety in the pleasing Dress of a  Clarissa  Novel and to use the Words of the greatest  The Author of the Ra  bler  Genius in the present Age  Has taught the Passions to move at the Command of Virtue  The Fables of  Aesop  though never I suppose believed yet have been long considered as Lectures of moral and domestic Wisdom so well adapted to the Faculties of Man that they have been received by all civilized Nations and the  Arabs  themselves have honoured his Translator with the Appellation of  Looman  the Wise  The Fables of  Aesop  said  Arabella  are among those of which the Absurdity discovers itself and the Truth is comprised in the Application but what can be said of those Tales which are told with the solemn Air of historical Truth and if false convey no Instruction  That they cannot be defended Madam said the Doctor it is my Purpose to prove and if to evince their Falshood be sufficient to procure their Banishment from your Ladyship's Closet their Day of Grace is near an end How is any oral or written Testimony confuted or confirmed  By comparing it says the Lady with the Testimony of others or with the natural Effects and standing Evidence of the Facts related and sometimes by comparing it with itself  If then your Ladyship will abide by this last returned he and compare these Books with antient Histories you will not only find innumerable Names of which no Mention was ever made before but Persons who lived in different Ages engaged as the Friends or Rivals of each other You will perceive that your Authors have parcelled out the World at Discretion erected Palaces and established Monarchies wherever the Conveniency of their Narrative required them and set Kings and Queens over imaginary Nations Nor have they considered themselves as invested with less Authority over the Works of Nature than the Institutions of Men for they have distributed Mountains and Desarts Gulphs and Rocks wherever they wanted them and whenever the Course of their Story required an Expedient  raised a gloomy Forest or overflowed the Regions with a rapid Stream  I suppose said  Arabella  you have no Intention to deceive me and since if what you have asserted be true the Cause is undefensible I shall trouble you no longer to argue on this Topic but desire now to hear why supposing them Fictions and intended to be received as Fictions you censure them as absurd  The only Excellence of Falshood answered he is its Resemblance to Truth as therefore any Narrative is more liable to be confuted by its Inconsistency with known Facts it is at a greater Distance from the Perfection of Fiction for there can be no Difficulty in framing a Tale if we are left at Liberty to invert all History and Nature for our own Conveniency When a Crime is to be concealed it is easy to cover it with an imaginary Word When Virtue is to be rewarded a Nation with a new Name may without any Expence of Invention raise her to the Throne When  Ariosto  was told of the Magnificence of his Palaces he answered that the Cost of poetical Architecture was very little and still less is the Cost of Building without Art than without Materials But their historical Failures may be easily passed over when we consider their physical or philosophical Absurdities to bring Men together from different Countries does not shock with every inherent or demonstrable Absurdity and therefore when we read only for Amusement such Improprieries may be born But who can forbear to  throw away the Story that gives to one Man the Strength of Thousands that puts Life or Death in a Smile or a Frown that recounts Labours and Sufferings to which the Powers of Humanity are utterly unequal that disfigures the whole Appearance of the World and represents every Thing in a Form different from that which Experience has shewn It is the Fault of the best Fictions that they teach young Minds to expect strange Adventures and sudden Vicissitudes and therefore encourage them often to trust to Chance A long Life may be passed without a single Occurrence that can cause much Surprize or produce any unexpected Consequence of great Importance the Order of the World is so established that all human Affairs proceed in a regular Method and very little Opportunity is left for Sallies or Hazards for Assault or Rescue but the Brave and the Coward the Sprightly and the Dull suffer themselves to be carried alike down the Stream of Custom  Arabella  who had for some Time listened with a Wish to interrupt him now took Advantage of a short Pause I cannot imagine Sir said she that you intend to deceive me and therefore I am inclined to believe that you are yourself mistaken and that your Application to Learning has hindered you from that Acquaintance with the World in which these Authors excelled I have not long conversed in Public yet I have found that Life is subject to many Accidents Do you count my late Escape for nothing Is it to be numbered among daily and cursory Transactions that a  Woman flies from a Ravisher into a rapid Stream  You must not Madam said the Doctor urge as an Argument the Fact which is at present the Subject of Dispute  Arabella  blushing at the Absurdity she had been guilty of and not attempting any Subterfuge or Excuse the Doctor found himself at Liberty to proceed  You must not imagine Madam continued he that I intend to arrogate any Superiority when I observe that your Ladyship must suffer me to decide in some Measure authoritatively whether Life is truly described in those Books the Likeness of a Picture can only be determined by a Knowledge of the Original You have yet had little Opportunity of knowing the Ways of Mankind which cannot be learned but from Experience and of which the highest Understanding and the lowest must enter the World in equal Ignorance I have lived long in a public Character and have thought it my Duty to study those whom I have undertaken to admonish or instruct I have never been so rich as to affright Men into Disguise and Concealment nor so poor as to be kept at a Distance too great for accurate Observa+tion I therefore presume to tell your Ladyship with great Confidence that your Writers have instituted a World of their own and that nothing is more different from a human Being than Heroes or Heroines  I am afraid Sir said  Arabella  that the Difference is not in Favour of the present World  That Madam answered he your own Penetration will enable you to judge when it shall have made you equally acquainted with both I have no desire to determine a Question the Solution of which will give so little Pleasure to Purity and Benevolence  The Silence of a Man who loves to praise is a Censure sufficiently severe said the Lady May it never happen that you should be unwilling to mention the Name of  Arabella  I hope wherever Corruption prevails in the World to live in it with Virtue or if I find myself too much endanger'd to retire from it with Innocence But if you can say so little in Commendation of Mankind how will you prove these Histories to be vicious which if they do not describe real Life give us an Idea of a better Race of Beings than now inhabit the World  It is of little Importance Madam replied the Doctor to decide whether in the real or fictitious Life most Wickedness is to be found Books ought to supply an Antidote to Example and if we retire to a contemplation of Crimes and continue in our Closets to inflame our Passions at what time must we rectify our Words or purify our Hearts The immediate Tendency of these Books which your Ladyship must allow me to mention with some Severity is to give new Fire to the Passions of Revenge and Love two Passions which even without such powerful Auxiliaries it is one of the severest Labours of Reason and Piety to suppress and which yet must be suppressed if we hope to be  approved in the Sight of the only Being where Approbation can make us Happy I am afraid your Ladyship will think me too seriousI have already learned too much from you said  Arabella  to presume to instruct you yet suffer me to caution you never to dishonour your sacred Office by the Lowliness of Apologies Then let me again observe resumed he that these Books soften the Heart to Love and harden it to Murder that they teach Women to exact Vengeance and Men to execute it teach Women to expect not only Worship but the dteadful Worship of human Sacrifices Every Page of these Volumes is filled with such extravagance of Praise and expressions of Obedience as one human Being ought not to hear from another or with Accounts of Battles in which thousands are slaughtered for no other Purpose than to gain a Smile from the haughty Beauty who sits a calm Spectatress of the Ruin and Desolation Bloodshed and Misery incited by herself  It is impossible to read these Tales with out lessening part of that Humility which by preserving in us a Sense of our Alliance with all human nature keeps us awake to Tenderness and Sympathy or without impairing that Compassion which is implanted in us as an Incentive to Acts of Kindness If there be any preserved by natural Softness or early Education from learning Pride and Cruelty they are yet in danger of being betrayed to the Vanity of Beauty and taught the Arts of Intrigue  Love Madam is you know the Business the sole Business of Ladies in Romances  Arabella  's Blushes now hinder'd him from proceeding as he had intended I perceive continued he that my Arguments begin to be less agreeable to your Ladyship's Delicacy I shall therefore insist no longer upon false Tenderness of Sentiment but proceed to those Outrages of the violent Passions which though not more dangerous are more generally hateful  It is not necessary Sir interrupted  Arabella  that you strengthen by any new Proof a Position which when calmly considered cannot be denied my Heart yields to the Force of Truth and I now wonder how the Blaze of Enthusiastic Bravery could hinder me from remarking with Abhorrence the Crime of deliberate unnecessary Bloodshed  I begin to perceive that I have hitherto at least trifled away my Time and fear that I have already made some Approaches to the Crime of encouraging Violence and Revenge I hope Madam said the good Man with Horror in his Looks that no Life was ever lost by your Incitement  Arabella  seeing him thus moved burst into Tears and could not immediately answer Is it possible cried the Doctor that such Gentleness and Elegance should be stained with Blood Be not too hasty in your Censure said  Arabella  recovering herself I tremble indeed to think how nearly I have apprroached the Brink of Murder when I thought myself only consulting my own Glory but whatever I suffer I will never more demand or instigate Vengeance nor consider my Punctilios as  important enough to be ballanced against Life  The Doctor confirmed her in her new Resolutions and thinking Solitude was necessary to compose her Spirits after the Fatigue of so long a Conversation be retired to acquaint Mr  Glanville  with his Success who in the Transport of his Joy was almost ready to throw himself at his Feet to thank him for the Miracle as he called it that he had performed  CHAP XII  In which the History is concluded  MR  Glanville  who fancied to himself the most ravishing Delight from conversing with his lovely Cousin now recovered to the free Use of all her noble Powers of Reason would have paid her a Visit that afternoon had not a moments Reflection convinced him that now was the Time when her Mind was labouring under the force of Conviction to introduce the repentant Sir  George  to her who by confessing the ridiculous Farce he had invented to deceive her might restore him to her good Opinion and add to the Doctor's solid Arguments the poignant Sting of Ridicule which she would then perceive she had incurred  Sir  George  being now able to leave his Chamber and  Arabella  well enough recovered to admit a Visit in hers Mr  Glanville  intreated his Father to wait on her and get Permission  for Sir  George  to attend her upon a Business of some Consequence Sir  Charles  no sooner mentioned this Request than  Arabella  after a little Hesitation complied with it As she had been kept a Stranger to all the Particulars of Mr  Glanville  's Quarrels with the young Baronet her Thoughts were a little perplex'd concerning the Occasion of this Visit and her Embarrassment was considerably increased by the Confusion which she perceived in the Countenance of Sir  George  It was not without some Tokens of a painfully supprest Reluctance that Sir  George  consented to perform his Promise when Mr  Glanville  claim'd it but the Disadvantages that would attend his Breach of it dejected and humbled as he now was presenting themselves in a forcible manner to his Imagination confirmed his wavering Resolutions And since he found himself obliged to be his own Accuser he endeavoured to do it with the best Grace he could Acknowledging therefore to Lady  Bella  all the Artifices her Deception by Romances had given him Encouragement to use upon her and explaining very explicitly the last with relation to the pretended Princess of  Gaul  he submissively asked her Pardon for the Offence it would now give her as well as for the Trouble it had formerly  Arabella  struck with inconceivable Cnfusion having only bowed her Head to his Apology desired to be left alone and continued for near two Hours afterwards wholly absorb'd in the most disagreeable Reflections on the Absurdity of her past Behaviour and the Contempt and Ridicule  to which she now saw plainly she had exposed herself The Violence of these first Emotions having at length subsided she sent for Sir  Charles  and Mr  Glanville  and having with a noble Ingenuity expatiated upon the Follies her vitiated Judgment had led her into she apologized to the first for the frequent Causes she had given him of Uneasiness and turning to Mr  Glanville  whom she beheld with a Look of mingled Tenderness and Modesty To give you myself with all my remaining Imperfections is making you but a poor Present in return for the Obligations your generous Affection has laid me under to you yet since I am so happy as to be desired for a Partner for Life by a Man of your Sense and Honour I will endeavour to make myself as worthy as I am able of such a favourable Distinction  Mr  Glanville  kissed the Hand she gave him with an emphatic Silence while Sir  Charles  in the most obliging Manner imaginable thanked her for the Honour she conferred both on himself and Son by this Alliance  Sir  George  entangled in his own Artifices saw himself under a Necessity of confirming the Promises he had made to Miss  Glanville  during his Fit of Penitence and was accordingly married to that young Lady at the same Time that Mr  Glanville  and  Arabella  were united  We chuse Reader to express this Circumstance though the same in different Words as well to avoid Repetition as to intimate that the first mentioned Pair were indeed only married  in the common Acceptation of the Word that is they were privileged to join Fortunes Equipages Titles and Expence while Mr  Glanville  and  Arabella  were united as well in these as in every Virtue and laudable Affection of the Mind  FINIS
