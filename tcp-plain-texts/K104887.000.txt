 To which is Added A General INDEX to both Volumes  The Third Edition  LONDON  Printed for  James Knapton  at the  Crown  in St  Paul  's Churchyard MDCCV  To the Right Honourable EDWARD Earl of  ORFORD  Viscount  Barfleur  Baron of  Shingey  Principal Lord of the Admiralty Treasurer of His Majesty's Navy c and one of His Majesty's most Honourable Privy Council  My Lord  'TIS in Acknowledgment of the Favours your Lordship has conferr'd upon me that I presume to place your Name before these Papers The Honourable Person to whom I dedicated my former Volume could not have taken a more agreeable way to befriend me than by recommending me to your Patronage and I shall always retain a grateful sense of it And your Lordship has been pleas'd to prefer me in a way suitable to my Genius  and Experience and wherein therefore if in any way I may be able to do something toward the preserving the good Opinion you have been pleased to entertain of me 'Tis a further Satisfaction to me that my Employment is of such a Nature as does not alienate me fron your Lordship's more peculiar Jurisdiction but places me more immediately under it and chiefly accountable to your self Whatever parts of the World I shall range into I shall carry this Comfort along with me that next under the Providence of God and his Majesty's Protection I shall be so long as I am upon the Seas in the Province and under the Direction of your Lordship and the Honourable Board For whose Favours to me in general I have no better way of Expressing my Gratitude than by doing it thus to your Lordship who Presides there And with these Sentiments I am bold to subscribe my self  My Lord  Your Lordship's Most Faithful and Devoted Humble Servant  William Dampier  The PREFACE  IN the Preface to my former Volume I have accounted for the Design and Method and Stile of those Relations of my Travels What I have more to say of that kind is chiefly with reference to what I now offer the Reader Thus far I have thought fit to change my Method in this Volume as to divide it into distinct Parts because the Matters it treats of are so different from one another in point of Time or other Circumstances But still in each Part I have taken the same course of making several Chapters that this Volume might retain some Uniformity with the other  The First of these is that Account I promised of my Voyages from  Achin  in  Sumatra  to several Places in the  E Indies  of which I forbore to particularize in the former Volume for Reasons there mentioned I have now more than discharg'd my self of that Promise For I have improved my own Observations especially as to  Tonquin  by those of some  English  Gentlemen who made a considerable stay in that Kingdom I am abundantly satisfied my Self of their Ability and Integrity the proper Qualifications in things of this Nature And could I have obtained their leave the  Reader  also should have had the Satisfaction of knowing to whom he was to ascribe several of those particulars However I have taken frequent Occasions to distinguish in general what I saw from what I was informed of This part is the  Supplement  of what is contained in the  former Volume  and compleats the  Voyage round the World  The  Second  Part contains what relates to the Time I spent in the Bay of  Campeachy  either as a LogwoodCutter or a Trader to them This was before I made my Voyage round the World as the  Reader  will perceive And upon this Occasion therefore I have gone so far back as to speak of my first entrance upon this Rambling kind of Life For the Account it gives of  Campeachy  and the Neighbouring parts of  Jucatan  and  New Spain  c I refer the  Reader  to the Work it self  The  Third  Part is an Account of the Winds and Weather Storms Tides and Currents of the  Torrid Zone  round the World which may be of Use towards the Improvement of  Navigation  and that part of  Natural History  'Tis the substance of what I have remark't or learnt about Things of that kind in so long a course of Roving upon the Seas And tho' I have not omitted to speak of these Matters in the series of my Voyages as occasion offered yet I thought it might not be unacceptable  to put them together in one View also by themselves in a Methodical Discourse ranging the several Particulars under their proper Heads  To render these things the more intelligible I have prefixed peculiar  Maps  One to each of the foregoing Parts but two to this of the Winds c that the Variety of TradeWinds might some way be Pictured as it were to the Eye and the Reader might be the less liable to be confounded with the Multiplicity of words denoting the several Points of the Compass or other Terms necessary to the Descriptional part of the Discourse These Maps contain the  Torrid Zone  and so much towards each Pole as was of Use to my Design And the Projection differs in this only from the Common Maps that in order to shew the  Atlantick  and  South  Oceans each in one entire view the Division of the Hemispheres is made not at the first Meridian reckoning from  Teneriffe  nor at the th as is usual also and as 'tis in the GlobeMap prefixed to my first Volume but at the th yet still retaining the common Graduation in the  Equator  from that customary Meridian of the  Canaries  or C  Verd  And upon this mention of the  Atlantick  Sea there is one thing I would observe to the  Reader  that I use that name not only for the North Sea as 'tis called but for this whole Ocean on both sides of the  Equator  between  Europe  and  Africk  on one hand and  America  on the other If I be questioned for taking this Liberty I should think it enough to say that I wanted a general name for this whole Ocean and I could not find one more proper And yet even as to the Reason of the thing if the Discovery of a Sea to the South of the  Isthmus  of  Darien  or the  Mexican  Coast were ground sufficient for the extending the Name of the  South Sea  to all that largest Ocean of the World tho' it lies West rather of the whole Continent of  America  much more may I be allowed a less considerable Enlargement of the Name of  Atlantick  Sea which others have long since extended to so great a part of this Ocean from its Original narrow Confines the Neighbourhood of Mount  Atlas  and the Coasts of  Mauritania  I know that so much of this Ocean as lies South of the R  Niger  went usually by the Name of the  Aethiopick  Sea Yet I can't learn a sufficient Reason for it For tho' 'tis true that the Ancients call'd all the South parts of  Africk  to each Sea  Aethiopia  yet even upon this bottom the Name of  Aethiopick  Sea should have been left common to the Oceans on each side of the Cape of  Good Hope  But if the Name must be appropriated why to this on the West of  Africa  why not rather to that on its E Coast which lies nearer the  Inward  or more  proper Aethiopia  now the  Abissine  Empire and consequently might better be called  Aethiopick  Sea Accordingly I have ventured to call it so  Vol    page  making it there the same as the  Indian  which I also make to be all the Ocean from the East Coast of  Africa  to the remotest of the  E India  Islands  New Holland  and  New Guinea  Tho' this Name also of  Indian  Sea has been understood usually of narrower bounds But be that as it will I was for using comprehensive Names and therefore these three Names of  Atlantick Indian  and  South  Seas or Oceans serve me for the whole Ambit of the  Torrid Zone  and what else I have occasion to speak of  To these three Parts is added a general  Index  of both  Volumes  The first Volume should not have been published without one but that was reserved to be annexed to this that the Reader might not have the Trouble of turning over Alphabets  Thus what I designed as an Appendix to the former  Volume  is grown to its self a Volume answerable to the other And I am sensible there is one part of the intended  Appendix  yet behind  viz  The Descriprion of the  South Sea  Coasts of  America  from the  Spanish  Pilot Books c I confess I had thoughts of crowding it into this Volume But besides the dryness and fatigue of such a Work and the small leisure I had for it I was quite discouraged from attempting it when upon a nearer View of the matter I found in those Descriptions and Charts a repugnance with each other in many particulars and some things which from my own Experience I knew to be erroneous Indeed as they are they may be very useful to Sailors in those Parts being generally right enough in the main But I was loth to undertake a Work much of which must have consisted in correcting Mistakes and yet have left unaviodable many more to be rectified Others may have Time and Helps for this Affair and future Discoveries may give greater Light to direct them To me it shall suffice that bating this one particular I have here endeavoured to perform what I had made the Publick expect from me  The CONTENTS  PART I The  Supplement  of the

perusing my  Voyage round the World  that I then omitted to speak particularly of the excursions I made to  Tonquin  to  Malacca Fort St George  and  Bencouli  from  Achin  in the Isle of  Sumatra  together with the Description I intended to give of those parts I do but just mention them there but shall now proceed to a more distinct account of them  And to keep to the order of time the Reader may recollect that my first departure from  Achin  was to  Tonquin  along with Captain  Weldon  about  July  as I have said p th of my former Volume I have there related in a page or two before to how weak a condition my self and my Companions were brought through the fatigues of our passage from  Nicobar  to  Achin  yet did not my weakness take me off from contriving some employment or expedition whereby I might have a comfortable subsistence Captain  Weldon  touched here to sell the Slaves he had brought with him from  Fort St George  it being in his way to the Streights of  Malacca  and so to  Tonquin  whither he was bound This afforded me the opportunity of trying that Voyage to which he kindly invited me and to which I was the more incouraged because he had a good Surgeon in his Ship whose Advice I needed and my friend Mr  Hall  was particularly animated thereby who had also resolved upon this Voyage and was in a weaker condition than my self Besides Capt  Weldon  promised to buy a Sloop at  Tonquin  of which he would make me Commander to go a trading Voyage from thence to  Cochinchina Champa Cambodia  or some others of the adjacent Countries which Trade has been scarce yet has been attempted by our Countrymen and there were hopes it might turn to a good account but this project came to nothing  However Captain  Weldon  having finished his business at  Achin  I set out thence with him thro' the Streights of  Malacca  and we soon arrived at the Town of  Malacca  of which Town and Country I shall have a better occasion to speak hereafter Here we found the  Caesar of London  commanded by Captain  Wright  who came from  Bombay  and was bound to  China  He stopt here to water and refresh as is usual for Ships to do that pass these Streights By him we were informed that three other  English  Ships had touched here and were past on to the Fastward ten days before These Ships came from  Fort St George  in company with Captain  Weldon  but his business  alling him to  Achin  they in the mean time pro  ecuting their Voyage got the start of us thus much The  Caesar  was soon ready to sail again and went away the next Morning after our arrival at  Malacca  Our Captain being a Stranger to the Bay of  Tonquin  as were all his Ships company he hired a  Dutch  Pilot at  Malacca  and having finished his business there we set sail two days after the  Caesar  We were desirous to overtake these four Ships and therefore crouded all the Sail we could make having a strong westerly Wind accompanied with many hard Gusts and Tornadoes and the very next day we got sight of them for they had not yet passed through a narrow Passage called the Streights of  Sincapore  We soon got up with them and past through together and sailing about three leagues farther we anchored near an Island called  Pulo Nuttee  belonging to the Kingdom of  Jihore  Here Captain  Weldon  took in Wood and Water and some of the  Indian  Inhabitans came aboard us in their Canoas of whom we bought a few Coconuts Plantains and fresh Fish We staid here not above hours for the other Ships had filled most of their Water at other Islands near this before we came up with them for tho' Ships do usually take in Water at  Malacca  Town yet they do as frequently discharge it again at some of these Islands and take in better  We sailed the next day and kept near the  Malacca  shore and there passing by the Mouth of the River  Jihore  we left many other Islands on our Starboard side  The River of  Jihore  runs by the City of that name which is the seat of the little Kingdom of  Jihore  This Kingdom lies on the Continent of  Malacca  and consists of the extremity or doubling of that Promontory It abounds with Pepper and other goood Commodities  They are a  Mahometan  People very warlike and desirous of Trade They delight much in Shipping and going to Sea all the neighbouring  Islands in a manner being Colonies of this Kingdom and under its Government They coast about in their own Shipping to several parts of  Sumatra Java  c their Vessels are but small yet very serviceable and the  Dutch  buy up a great many of them at a small price and make good trading Sloops of them But they first fit them up after their own fashion and put a Rudder to them which the  Jihorians  don't use tho' they are very good Seamen in their way but they make their Vessels sharp at each end tho' but one end is used as the Head and instead of a Rudder they have on each side the Stern a thing like a very broad Oar one of which they let down into the Water at pleasure as there is occasion to steer the Ship either to the one side or the other always letting down that which is to the Leeward They have Proes of a particular neatness and curiosity We call them Halfmoon Proes for they turn up so much at each end from the Water that they much resemble a Halfmoon with the Horns upwards They are kept very clean sail well and are much used by them in their Wars The People of  Jishore  have formerly endeavoured to get a Commerce with our Nation For what reason that trade is neglected by us I know not The  Dutch  trade very much there and have lately endeavoured to bring the King who is very young to their bow  At the farther end of the Streights of  Malacca  among many other Islands we sailed by those of  Pulo Oro  and  Pulo Timaon  which last is a place often touched at for wood water and other refreshments tho' we past by it Among other things there are great plenty of excellent Green Turtle among these Islands  Being at length got clear of the Islands into the wide Ocean we steered away still together  till we came in sight of  Pulo Condore  when having all brought to and spoke with each other we parted for our several Voyages The  Caesar  and two others that were bound to  China  steered away to the Eastward keeping to the South of  Pulo Condore  it being their best course thereby to avoid the large sholes of  Pracel  We and the  Saphire  of  Fort St Geonge  commanded by Captain  Lacy  steered more Northerly and leaving  Pulo Condore  on our Starboard we hal  d in for the Continent and fell in with it near the River of  Cambodia  But leaving this also on our Starboard side we coasted along to the Eastward keeping near the  Champa  shore and coming to the point of Land that bounds the S W part of the Bay of  Tonquin  we doubled it and coasting to the North leaving  Champa  still on our Larboard side and the dangerous shoals of  Pracel  about or leagues off on our Starboard side we kept along fair by the shore just without  Pulo Canton  This Island lies in about d North It is much frequented by the  Cochinchinese  whose Country begins hereabouts bordering on the Kingdom of  Champa  They are most Fishermen that come hither and their chief business is to make Oyl of Porpusses for these Fish are found in great plenty here at some seasons of the year and then the  Cochinchinese  resort hither to take them The people that we found on  Pulo Condore  mentioned in the th Chapter of my Voyage round the World page were of these  Cochinchinese  The Turtle also which they catch is chiefly in order to make Oyl of their fat and there is a great store of Turtle on all this Coast  We coasted yet f  rther on this shore till we came to the Islands of  Champello  These may seem to have some affinity to  Champa  by the sound of the word which one would take to be a  Portugues  diminutive of  Champa  yet they lye on the  Cochinchina  Coast and belong to it tho' uninhabited They are or in number and lye or leagues from the shore They are called  Champella de la Mar  to distinguish them from others lying farther down in the Bay of  Tonquin  called  Champello de Terra  These last lye in about d m North but the Islands of  Champello de la Mar  lye in about d m N  Over against these last Islands on the Main there is a large navigable River empties it self into the Sea The City of  Quinam  stands on the banks of this River and is said to be the principal City of the Kingdom of  Cochinchina  As to its distance from the Sea its bigness strength riches c I am yet in the dark only I have been inform'd that if a Ship is cast away on this Kingdom the Seamen that escape drowning and get ashore become Slaves to the King Captain  John Tiler  was thus serv'd and despaired of ever getting his freedom but after a considerable stay there he was taken notice of by the King and upon promise of returning thither again to trade there he was sent away I sailed in a Vessel of his after this but I never found him inclin'd to Trade thither any more However notwithstanding this their severity to Shipwrackt People I have beeen informed by Captain  Tiler  and others that they have a desire to Trade tho' they are yet destitute of the means to attain it This desire of Trade they seem to have taken up from some  Chinese  Fugitives who fled from the  Tartars  when they conquered their Country and being kindly received by these  Cochinchinese  and having among them many Artificers they instructed their kind protectors in many useful Arts of which they were wholly ignorant before 'Tis probable this their custom of seizing Shipwrackt Seamen may soon vanish by the coming in of Trade which is already  advancing among them for the Merchants of  China  do now drive some small traffick among these people and fetch thence some small quantities of Pepper  Lignum Aloes  and  Aguala  Wood which is much esteemed for its rare scent and is very valuable in other places of  India  They also fetch Betle from hence it growing here in great plenty I have had no account of any Shipping the  Cochinchinese  have of their own but I have met with them in their open Boats of or Tun imploying themselves chiefly in getting Pitch and Tar from  Pulo Condore  in fishing about the Coast and Island to get Oyl and in fetching  Aguala  Wood from the Bay of  Siam  which whether it grows there or no I can't tell but I have heard that 'tis only Driftwood cast ashore by the Sea  The seizing Shipwrackt men has been also a custom at  Pegu  but whether still continued I know not They lookt on such as men preserved by God purposely for them to feed and maintain and therefore the King ordered them to be maintained by his Subjects neither was any work required of them but they had liberty to beg By this means they got food and rayment from the Inhabitants who were zealously charitable to them  But to proceed we kept a little without all the Islands and coasting or leagues further we stood right over towards the N E Cod of the Bay of  Tonquin  The Bay of  Tonquin  has its entrance between the S E point of  Champa  on the West side which lies in the lat of about d North and the Island of  Aynam  near the S W part of  China  on the East side The Island of  Aynam  is in about d North It is a pretty considerable Island well peopled with  Chinese  Inhabitants They have Ships of their own and drive  a great trade by Sea I have seen many of their Ships some of Tun with Outlagers on both sides and others like ordinary Jonks without Outlagers but am wholly ignorant of their Trade any farther than what I have mentioned of their having Pearl Oysters there in the th Chapter of my  Voyage round the World  page  Near the Cod of the Bay of  Tonquin  there are abundance of small Islands of which I shall speak more hereafter The mouth of the Bay seems to be barred up with the great shole of  Pracel  which lies stretched at length before it yet leaving two wide Channels one at each end so that Ships may pass in or out either way And therefore even the Ships that are bound from the Streigths of  Malacca  or  Siam  to  China  may as well pass to and from within the shole as without  The Bay of  Tonquin  is about leagues wide in the broadest place There is good sounding and anchoring all over it and in the middle where it is deepest there is about fathom water There you have black Oaze and dark Peppery Sand but on the West side there is reddish Oazy Sand Beside the other Islands beforementioned there are others of less note on the  Cochinchina  Coast but none of them all above or miles from the shore  In the bottom of the Bay also there are some small Islands close by the  Tonquin  shore of these are of especial note not for their bigness but for Seamarks for the principal Rivers or Mouth rather of the chief River of  Tonquin  One of these Rivers or Mouths is called  Rokbo  It discharges it self into the Sea near the the N W corner of the Bay and the mouth of it is in about d m N This River or branch I was not at but have been informed that it has not above foot water at the entrance but that its bottom  is soft Oaz and therefore very convenient for small Vessels and it is the way that all the  Chinese  and  Siamars  do use About a League to the Westward of this Rivers mouth there is a small pretty high Island call'd  Fishers Island  It lieth about mile from the shore and it hath good anchoring about it in or foot water and therefore it is not only a Seamark for the River but a secure place to ride in and very convenient for Ships to anchor at to shelter themselves when they come hither especially if they have not a present opportunity to enter the River either because of coming too late in the year or being hindred by bad weather  The other River or Mouth was that by which we entered and 'tis larger and deeper than the former I know not its particular name but for distinction I shall call it the River of  Domea  because the first Town of note that I saw on its bank was so called The mouth of the River is in lat d m It disembogues leagues to the N E of  Rokbo  There are many dangerous Sands and Shoals between these Rivers which stretch into the Sea leagues or more and all the Coast even from the  Cochinchina  shore on the West to  China  on the East admits of Shoals and Sands which yet in some places lie stretched farther off from the shore than in others  This River of  Domea  is that by which most  European  Ships enter for the sake of its depth yet here is a Bar of near mile broad and the Channel is about half a mile broad having Sands on each side The depth of the River is various at different times and seasons by the relation of the Pilots who are best acquainted here for at some times of the year here is not above or foot water on a spring tide and at other times here are or foot The highest tides are said to he in the month of  November  December  and  January  when the Northerly Monsoons blow and the lowest in  May June  and  July  when the Southerly Monsoons blow but to be particular in them is beyond my experience  The Channel of the Bar is hard Sand which makes it the more dangerous and the Tides whirling among the Sands set divers ways in a Tides time which makes it the more dangerous still Therefore Ships that come hither commonly wait for a Pilot to direct them and if they arrive when it is Nepetide they must stay for a Spring before a Pilot will come off to take charge of them The mark of this River is a great high ridgy Mountain in the Country called the  Elephant  This must be brought to bear N W by N then steering towards the shore the water runs shallower till you come into fathom and then you will be or miles from the foot or entrance of the Bar and about the same distance from a small Island called  Pearl Island  which will then bear nearest N N E Having these marks and depth you may anchor and wait for a Pilot  The Pilots for this River are Fishermen who live at a Village called  Batsha  at the mouth of the River so seated that they can see all Ships that wait for a Pilot and hear the Guns too that are often fired as signals by  Europeans  to give notice of their arrival  It was in the road before the Bar in sight of the  Elephant  Land that we found the  Rainbow  of  London  Captain  Pool  Commander riding and waiting for a Pilot when we and Captain  Lacy  arrived Captain  Pool  came directly from  England  and passing thro' the Streights of  Sundy  touched at  Batavia  He had lain here or days before we arriv'd but the Springtides coming on the Pilots came  aboard and we all in company passed in over the Bar and entring about halfflood we had foot and a half water on the Bar Being got over the Bar we found it deeper and the bottom soft Oaz The River at its mouth is above a mile wide but grows narrower as you run farther up We had a moderate Seabreeze and having a good tide of flood made the best of it to reach to our anchoring place  Having run about or leagues up the River we past by a Village called  Domea  This is a handsome Village and 'twas the first of note that we saw standing on the banks 'Tis seated on the Starboard side going up and so nigh the River that the tide sometimes washes the walls of the Houses for the tide rises and falls here or foot This Village consists of about Houses The  Dutch  Ships that trade here do always lye in the River before this Town and the  Dutch  Seamen by their annual returns hither from  Batavia  are very intimate with the Natives and as free here as at their own homes for the  Tonquinese  in general are a very sociable people especially the traders and poorer sort but of this more in its proper place The  Dutch  have instructed the Natives in the art of Gardening by which means they have abundance of Herbage for Sallading which among other things is a great refreshment to the  Dutch  Seamen when they arrive here  Tho' the  Dutch  who come to trade in this Kingdom go no higher with their Ships than this  Domea  yet the  English  usually go about mile farther up and there lye at anchor during their stay in this Country We did so at this time and passing by  Domea  came to an anchor at that distance The tide is not so strong here as at  Domea  but we found not one house near it yet our Ships had not lain their many days before the Natives came from  all the Country about and fell a building them Houses after their fashion so that in a Months time there was a little Town built near our anchoring place This is no unusual thing in other parts of  India  especially where Ships lye long at a place the poorer sort of Natives taking this opportunity to truck and barter and by some little offices or begging but especially by bringing Women to let to hire they get what they can of the Seamen  This place where our Ships rode at anchor was not above miles from the Sea but the Trade of the Kingdom is driven at  Cachao  the principal City where for that reason the  English  and  Dutch EastIndia  Companies have each of them their Factors constantly residing The City was farther up the River about miles from our Anchoring place and our Captains got themselves in a readiness to go up thither it being usual to send up the goods in the Country Boats which are large and commodious enough and the hire is pretty reasonable both for the Vessels and the Men who manage them They are  Tonquinese  and use both Oars and Sails Our Factory at  Cachao  had news of our arrival before we came to an anchor and immediately the chief of the Factory with some of the King of  Tonquin  's Officers came down to us by that time we had lain there about or days The  Tonquinese  Officers came to take an account of the Ships and Lading and our Captains received them with great civility firing of Guns feasting for two or three days and presents also at their return back to  Cachao  Soon after their departure the chief of the Factory returned thither again and with him went our three Captains and some others among whom I got leave to go also Captain  Weldon  had recommended me to the chief of the Factory while he was aboard us and my going up now to the  City was in order to have his assistance in the Voyage to  Cochinchina Champa  or  Cambodia  which Captain  Weldon  had contrived for me nor was it his fault that it came no nothing  We went from our Ships in the Country Boats we had hired with the Tide of flood and anchored in the ebb for the Tide runs strong for or miles beyond the place where we left our Ships Our Men contented themselves with looking after their goods The  Tonquinese  being very lightfinger'd and left the managment of the Boats entirely to the Boats Crew Their Boats have but one Mast and when the Wind is against them they take it down and ply their Oars As we advanced thus up the River sometimes rowing sometimes sailing we had a delightful prospect over a large level fruitful Country It was generally either Pasture or Ricefields and void of Trees except only about the Villages which stood thick and appeared mighty pleasant at a distance There are many of these Villages stand close to the Banks of the Rivers incompassed with Trees on the backside only but open to the River  When we came near any of these Villages we were commonly encounter'd with Beggars who came off to us in little Boats made of twigs and plaistered over both inside and outside with Clay but very leaky These were a poor Leprous People who for that reason are compell'd by the rest to live by themselves and are permitted to beg publickly As soon as they spied us they set up a loud doleful cry and as we past by them we threw them out some Rice which they received with great appearance of joy  In about four days time we got to  Hean  a Town on the East side of the River which is here entire for a little before we came to  Hean  we met  the main stream where it parts into the Channels that of  Domea  which we came up and the other of  Rokbo  making a large and triangular Island between them and the Sea the Mouths of those Channels being as I have said leagues asunder  Hean  is about miles from the place where we left our Ships and about from the Sea that way But along the River or Channel  Rokbo  where the Land trends more to the Southward it seems to be farther distant from the Sea 'Tis a considerable Town of about Houses but the Inhabitants are most poor People and Soldiers who keep a Garrison there tho' it has neither Walls Fort nor great Guns  Here is one street belonging to the  Chinese  Merchants For some years ago a great many lived at  Cachao  till they grew so numerous that the Natives themselves were even swallowed up by them The King taking notice of it ordered them to remove from thence allowing them to live any where but in the City But the major part of them presently forsook the Country as not finding it convenient for them to live any where but at  Cachao  because that is the only place of Trade in the Country and Trade is the Life of a  Chinese  However some of them were content to settle at  Hean  where they have remained ever since And these Merchants notwithstanding the prohibition go often to  Cachao  to buy and sell goods but are not suffer'd to make it their constant residence There were two of these  China  Merchants who traded yearly to  Japan  with raw and wrought Silks bringing back Money chiefly These all of them wore long Hair braided behind as their own Country fashion was before the  Tartarian  Conquest The  French  too have their Factory here not being allowed to fix at  Cachao  and their Bishops  Palace is the fairest building in  Hean  but of this I shall have occasion to speak more hereafter  The Governor of the adjacent Province lives here He is one of the principal  Mandarins  of the Nation and he has always a great many Soldiers in the Town and inferiour Officers whom he employs at his pleasure on any occasion Besides here are also some of the King's River Frigats which I shall hereafter describe ready to be sent on any expedition and tho' no  Europeans  come up so far as this with their Ships that I could learn yet the  Siamites  and  Chinese  bring their Ships up the River  Rokbo  quite to  Hean  and lie at anchor before it and we found there several  Chinese  Jonks They ride afloat in the middle of the River for the Water does not rise and fall much at this place Neither is the flood discerned by the turning of the stream for that always runs down tho' not so swift near full Sea as at other times for the tide pressing against the stream tho' faintly so far up the River has not power to turn it but only slackens its course and makes the Water rise a little  The Governor or his Deputy gives his  Chop  or Pass to all Vessels that go up or down not so much as a Boat being suffer'd to proceed without it For which reason we also made a stop yet we stayed here but a little while and therefore I did not now go ashore but had a while after this a better opportunity of seeing  Hean  From  Hean  we went up to  Cachao  in our Boats being about days more on our Voyage for we had no tide to help us We landed at the  English  Factory and I stayed there or days before I went down to our Ships again in one of the Country Boats We had good weather coming up but it rained all the time of this my first stay a  Cachao  and we had much wet weather after this  But having got thus far I shall now proceed to give some general account of this Country from my own observations and the experience of Merchants and others worthy of credit who have had their Residence there and some of them a great many years  CHAP II  Tonquin  its Situation Soil Waters and Provinces Its natural Produce Roots Herbs Fruits and Trees The  Camchain  and  Camquit  Oranges Their Limes c Their  Betle  and  Lichea  Fruit The  Pone  tree  Lack  trees  Mulberry  trees and Rice Their Land Animals Fowl tame and wild Nets for wild Ducks Locusts Fish  Balachuan Nukemum  Pickle

yearly Land Floods here and elsewhere in the Torrid Zone and of the overflowing of the  Nile  in  Egypt  Of Storms called Tuffoons and of the influence the Rains have on the Harvest at  Tonquin  and elsewhere in the Torrid Zone  THE Kingdom of  Tonquin  is bounded to the North and North East with  China  to the West with the Kingdom of  Laos  to the S and E with  Cochinchina  and the Sea which washes a part of this Kingdom As to the particular bounds or extent of it I cannot be a competent judge coming to it by Sea and going up directly to  Cachao  but it is reasonable to believe it to be a pretty large Kingdom by the many great Provinces which are said to be contained in it That part of the Kingdom that borders on the Sea is all  very low Land neither is there any Hill to be seen but the  Elephant  Mountain and a Ridge of a much less heigth continued from thence to the mouth of the River of  Domea  The Land for about miles up in the Country is still very low even and plain nor is it much higher for about miles farther quite to  Cachao  and beyond it being without any sensible Hill tho' generally of a tolerable good heighth and with some gentle risings here and there that make it a fine pleasant Champian and the further side of this also is more level than the Champian Country it self about  Hean  or  Cachao  Farther still to the North beyond all this I have been informed that there is a chain of high Mountains running cross the Country from East to West but I could get no intimation of what is beyond them  The Soil of this Country is generally very rich That very low Land I speak of towards the Sea is most black Earth and the mould pretty deep In some places there's very strong Clay The Champian Land is generally yellowish or greyish earth of a looser and more friable substance than the former yet in some places it has a touch of the Clay too In the plain Country near the Mountains last mentioned there are said to be some high steep rocks of Marble scattered up and down at unequal distances which standing in that large plain Savannah are like so many great Towers or Castles and they appear more visible because the Land about them is not burdened with Wood as in some places in its neighbourhood  I have said somewhat already of the great River and its branches  Rokbo  and  Domea  wherewith this Country is chiefly water'd tho' it is not destitute of many other pleasant streams that are lost  n these in their course towards the Sea and probably there are many others that run immediately  into the Sea through their own channels tho' not so navigable as the other The Country in general is very well watered and by means of the great Navigable River and its Branches it has the opportunity of Foreign Trade This rises about the Mountains in the North or from beyond them whence running Southerly toward the Sea it passes thro' the before mentioned Plain of Marble Rocks and by that time it comes to  Cachao  which is about or miles to the South of the Mountains 'tis about as broad as the  Thames  at  Lambeth  yet so shallow in the dry Season as that it may be forded on Horseback At  Hean  miles lower 'tis rather broader than the  Thames  at  Gravesend  and so below  Hean  to the place where it divides it self  The Kingdom of  Tonquin  is said to be divided into large Provinces  viz  the  East  and  West  Provinces the  North  and  South  Provinces and the Province of  Cachao  in the middle between those which I take to be the principal Provinces making the heart of the Country The other which are  Tenan Tenehoa  and  Ngeam  lie more upon the Borders  The Province of  Tenan  is the most Easterly having  China  on the S E the Island  Aynam  and the Sea on the S and S W and the  East  Province on the N W This is but a small Province its chiefest product is Rice  The  East  Province stretches away from  Tenan  to the  North  Province having also  China  on its East side part of the South Province and the Province on  Cachao  on the West and the Sea on the South This is a very large Province 'tis chiefly low Land and much of it Islands especially the S E part o  it bordering on the Sea towards  Tenan  and here the Sea makes the Cod of a Bay It has abundanc  of Fishermen inhabiting near the Sea but its chie  produce is Rice here is also good pasturage and much Cattle c  Hean  is the chief place of this Province and the Seat of the  Mandarin  its Governor  The S Province is the triangular Island made by Sea The River of  Domea  is on its E side dividing it from the East Province and  Rockbo  on the West dividing it from  Tenan  having the Sea to its South This Province is very low plain even Land producing Rice in great abundance here are large Pastures and abundance of Fishermen near the Sea  Tenehoa  to the West of  Rokbo  has the West Province on its North  Aynam  on its West and the Sea on its South this Province is also low Land chiefly abounds in Rice and Cattle and hath a great Trade in Fishing as all the Sea Coast has in general  The Province of  Ngeam  hath  Tenehoa  on the East and on the South and West it borders on  Cochinchina  and has the West Province on its North This is a pretty large Province abounding with Rice and Cattle and here are always Soldiers kept to guard the Frontiers from the  Cochinchineses  The West Provinces hath  Ngeam  on the South the Kingdom of  Laos  on the West the Province of  Cachao  on the East and on the North the North Province This is a large Province and good Champion Land rich in Soil partly woody partly pasture The product of this Province is chiefly in  Lack  and here are bred a great abundance of Silkworms for making Silk  The North Province is a large tract of Land making the North side of this whole Kingdom It hath the Kingdom of  Laos  on the West and  China  on the East and North the Kingdom of  Bao  or  Baotan  on the North West and on the South borders  on of the principal Provinces of  Tonquin viz  the West Province that of  Cachao  and the East Province The North Province as it is large so it has variety of Land and Soil a great deal of plain Champian Land and many high Mountains which yield Gold c the wild Elephants of this Country are found most on these Mountains The other parts of the Province produce Lack and Silk c  The Province of  Cachao  in the Heart of the Kingdom lies between the East West North and South Provinces 'tis a Champian pleasant Country the Soil is yellow or grey Earth and 'tis pretty woody with some Savannahs It abounds with the two principal Commodities of their Trade  viz  Lack and Silk and has some Rice Nor are any of the Provinces destitute of these Commodities tho' in different proportions each according to the respective Soil  This Country has of its own growth all necessaries for the Life of Man They have little occasion for eatable Roots having such plenty of Rice yet they have Yams and Potatoes for variety which would thrive here as well as any where were the Natives industrious to propagate them  The Land is every where cloathed with Herbage of one kind or other but the dry Land has the same Fate that most dry Lands have between the  Tropicks  to be overrun with Purslain which growing wild and being pernicious to other tender Herbs and Plants they are at the pains to weed it out of their Fields and Gardens tho' 'tis very sweet and makes a good Sallad for a hot Country  There is a sort of Herb very common in this Country which grows wild in stagnant Ponds and floats on the surface of the Water It has a narrow long green thick Leaf It is much esteemed  and eaten by the Natives who commend it for a very wholesome herb and say that 'tis good to expel poyson This Country produces many other sorts of wild Herbs and their Gardens also are well furnished with pleasant and wholesome ones especially many Onions of which here are great plenty  Plantains and Bonanoes grow and thrive here as well as any where but they are used here only as Fruit and not for Bread as in many places of  America  Besides these here are divers sorts of excellent Fruits both Groundfruit and Tree fruit The Groundfruits are Pumpkins Melons Pineapples c the Treefruits are Mangoes a few Oranges Limes Coconuts Guava's Mulberries their much esteemed Betle a Fruit called  Lichea  c The Oranges are of divers sorts and two of them more excellent than the rest One sort is called  Camchain  the other is call'd  Camquit Cam  in the  Tonquinese  Language signifies an Orange but what the distinguishing Words  Cam  and  Quit  signifie I know not  The  Camchain  is a large Orange of a yellowish colour the rind is prety thick and rough and the inside is yellow like Amber It has a most fragrant smell and the taste is very delicious This sort of Orange is the best that I did ever taste I believe there are not better in the World A Man may eat freely of them for they are so innocent that they are not denied to such as have Fevers and other sick People  The  Camquit  is a very small round Fruit not above half so big as the former It is of a deep red colour and the rind is very smooth and thin The inside also is very red the taste is not inferiour to the  Camchain  but it is accounted very unwholesome Fruit especially to such as are subject to Fluxes for it both creates and heightens that  distemper These sorts are very plentiful and cheap and they are in season from  October  till  February  but then the  Chamchain  becomes redder and the rind is also thinner The other sorts of Oranges are not much esteemed  The Limes of  Tonquin  are the largest I ever saw They are commonly as big as an ordinary Limon but rounder The rind is of a pale yellow colour when ripe very thin and smooth They are extraordinary juicy but not near so sharp or tart in taste as the  WestIndian  Limes  Coconnts and Guava's do thrive here very well but there are not many of the latter  The  Betle  of  Tonquin  is said to be the best in  India  there is great plenty of it and 'tis most esteemed when it is young green and tender for 'tis then very juicy At  Mindanao  also they like it best green but in other places of the  EastIndies  it is commonly chew'd when it is hard and dry  The  Lichea  is another delicate Fruit 'Tis as big as a small Pear somewhat long shaped of a reddish colour the rind pretty thick and rough the inside white inclosing a large black kernel in shape like a Bean  The Country is in some part woody but the low Land in general is either grassy Pasture or Rice Fields only thick set with small Groves which stand scattering very pleasantly over all the lowCountry The Trees in the Groves are of divers sorts and most unknown to us There is good Timber for building either Ships or Houses and indifferent good Masts may here be had  There is a Tree called by the Natives  Pone  chiefly used for making Cabinets or other Wares to be la  kred This is a soft sort of wood not much unlike Fir but not so serviceable Another Tree grows in this Country that yields the Lack with which Cabinets and other sine things are overlaid  These grow plentifully in some places especially in the Champion Lands Here are also Mulberry Trees in great plenty to feed the Silkworms from whence comes the chief Trade in the Country The Leaves of the old Trees are not so nourishing to the Silkworms as those of the young Trees and therefore they raise crops of young ones every year to feed the Worms for when the season is over the young Treees are pluckt up by the Roots and more planted against the next year so the Natives suffer none of these Trees to grow to bear Fruit I heard of no Mulberries kept for eating but some few raised by our  English  Merchants at  Hean  and these bare but small hungry Fruit  Here is good plenty of Rice especially in the low Land that is fatned by the overflowing Rivers They have two crops every year with great increase if they have seasonable Rains and Floods One crop is in  May  and the other in  November  and tho' the low Land is sometimes overflown with Water in the time of Harvest yet they matter it not but gather the crop and fetch it home wet in their Canoas and making the Rice fast in small bundles hang it up on their Houses to dry This serves them for Breadcorn and as the Country is very kindly for it so their Inhabitants live chiefly of it  Of LandAnimals in this Country there are Elephants Horses Buffaloes Bullocks Goats Deer a few Sheep for the King Hogs Dogs Cats Lizards Snakes Scorpions Centapees Toads Frogs c The Country is so very populous that they have but few Deer or wild Game for hunting unless it be in the remoter parts of the Kingdom But they have abundance of Fowls both tame and wild The tame Fowls are Cocks and Hens and Ducks also in great plenty of the same sort with ours The Inhabitants have little  Houses made purposely for the Ducks to lay their Eggs in driving them in every Night in laying time and letting them out again in the morning There are also some Geese Parrots Partridges Parakites TurtleDoves c with many sorts of smaller Birds Of wild Waterfowls they have Ducks Widgeons Teals Herons Pellicans and Crabcatchers which I shall describe in the Bay of  Campeachy  and other smaller Waterfowls The Duck Widgeon and Teal are innumerable They breed here in the Months of  May June  and  July  then they fly only in couples but from  October  to  March  you will see over all the low watry Lands great Companies together and I have no where seen such large flights nor such plenty of Game They are very shy since the  English  and  Dutch  settled here for now the Natives as well as they shoot them but before their arrival the  Tonquinese  took them only with Nets neither is this custom left off yet The Net that is used for this Game is made square and either bigger or less according as they have occasion They fix two Poles about or foot high upright in the Ground near the Pond where the Ducks haunt and the Net has a headcord which is stretched out streight made from the top of one Pole to the other from whence the lower part of the Net hangs down loose towards the Ground and when in the evening they fly towards the Pond many of them strike against the Net and are there entangled  There is a kind of Locust in  Tonquin  in great abundance This Creature is about the bigness of the top of a Mans Finger and as long as the first joynt It breeds in the Earth especially in the Banks of Rivers and Ditches in the low Country In the months of  January  and  February  which is the season of taking them being then only seen this Creature first comes out of the Earth in huge  swarms It is then of a whitish colour having small Wings like the Wings of a Bee at its first coming out of the Earth it takes its flight but for want of strength or use falls down again in a short time Such as strive to fly over the River do commonly fall down into the Water and are drowned or become a prey to the Fish of the River or are carried out into the Sea to be devoured there But the Natives in these Months watch the Rivers and take up thence Multitudes skimming them from off the Water with little Nets They eat them fresh broiled on the Coals or pickle them to keep They are plump and fat and are much esteemed both by rich and poor as good wholesome food either fresh or pickled  The Rivers and Ponds are stored with divers sorts of excellent Fish besides abundance of Frogs which they angle for being highly esteemed by the  Tonquinese  The Sea too contributes much towards the support of poor People by yielding plentiful stores of Fish that swarm on this Coast in their seasons and which are commonly preferr'd before the River Fish Of these here are divers sorts besides Sea Turtle which frequently come ashore on the sandy Bays in their seasons to lay their Eggs Here are also both Landcrabs and Seacrabs good store and other Shellfish  viz  Crawfish Shrimps and Prawns Here is one sort of small Fish much like an  Anchovy  both in shape and size which is very good pickled There are other sorts of small Fish which I know not the names of One sort of them comes in great  hoals near the shore and these the Fishermen with their Nets take so plentifully as to load their Boats with them Among these they generally take a great many Shrimps in their Nets which they  arry ashore mixt together as they take them and make  Balachaun  with them  Balachaun  is a composition of a strong favour yet a very delightsom Dish to the Natives of this Country To make it they throw the mixture of Shrimps and small Fish into a sort of weak pickle made with Salt and Water and put it into a tight earthen Vessel or Jar The pickle being thus weak it keeps not the Fish firm and hard neither is it probably so designed for the Fish are never gutted Therefore in a short time they turn all to a mash in the Vessel and when they have lain thus a good while so that the Fish is reduced to a Pap they then draw off the Liquor into fresh Jars and preserve it for use The masht Fish that remains behind is called  Balachaun  and the liquor pour'd off is called  Nukemum  The poor People eat the  Balachaun  with their Rice 'Tis rank scented yet the taste is not altogether unpleasant but rather savory after one is a little used to it The  Nukemum  is of a pale brown colour inclining to grey and pretty clear It is also very savory and used as a good sauce for Fowls not only by the Natives but also by many  Europeans  who esteem it equal with  Soy  I have been told that  Soy  is made partly with a fishy composition and it seems most likely by the taste tho a Gentleman of my acquaintance who was very intimate with one that sailed often from  Tonquin  to  Japan  from whence the true  Soy  comes told me that it was made only with Wheat and a sort of Beans mixt with Water and Salt  Their way of Fishing differs little from ours in the Rivers they take some of their Fish with Hook and Line others with Nets of several sorts At the Mouths of the Rivers they set Nets against the Stream or Tide These have two long Wings opening on each side the Mouth of the Net to guide the Fish into it where passing through a narrow neck they are caught in a bag at the farther end  Where the Rivers mouth is so wide that the wing of the Net will not reach from side to side as at  Batsha  particularly it will not there they supply that defect with long slender Canes which they stick upright near one another in a row for on both sides of the River when the tide runs strong which is the time that the Fish are moving the limber Canes make such a rattling by striking against each other that thereby the Fish are scared from thence towards the Mouth of the Net in the middle of the stream Farther up the River they have Nets made square like a great sheet This sort hath two long Poles laid across each other At this crossing of the Poles a long Rope is fastned and the Net hangs down in a bag by its corners from them To manage it there is a substantial post set upright and firm in the River and the top of it may be or foot above the water On the top of this post there is a Mortice made to receive a long pole that lies athwart like the Beam of a Balance to the heavier end of which they tie the Rope which holds the Net and to the other end another Rope to pull up the Net on occasion The Fishermen sink it with Stones to the Rivers bottom and when they see any Fish come over it one suddenly pulls the Rope at the opposite end of the Beam and heaves Net and Fish out of the Water They take a great deal of Fish this way and sometimes they use DragNets which go quite across and sweep the River  In the stagnant Ponds such as the  Mandarins  have commonly about their Houses they go in and trouble the water with their feet till 'tis all muddy and thick and as the Fish rise to the furface they take what they please with small Nets fastned to a hoop at the end of a pole  For all these sorts of provision there are Markets duly kept all over  Tonquin  one in the week in a neighbourhood of or Villages and held at each of them successively in its order so that the same Village has not the Market returned to it till or weeks after These Markets are abundantly more stor'd with Rice as being their chief subsistence especially of the poorer sort than either with Flesh or Fish yet wants there not for Pork and young Pigs good store Ducks and Hens plenty of Eggs Fish great and small fresh and salted  Balachaun  and  NukeMum  with all sorts of Roots Herbs and Fruits even in these Country Markets But at  Cachao  where there are Markets kept every day they have besides these Beef of Bullocks Buffaloes Flesh Goats Flesh Horse Flesh Cats and Dogs as I have been told and Locusts  They dress their food very cleanly and make savory for which they have several ways unknown in  Europe  but they have many sorts of dishes that would turn the Stomach of a Stranger which yet they themselves like very well as particularly a dish of raw Pork which is very cheap and common This is only Pork cut and minced very small fat and lean together which being afterwards made up in balls or rolls like Sausages and prest very hard together is then neatly wrapt up in clean Leaves and without more ado served up to the Table Raw Beef is another dish much esteemed at  Cachao  When they kill a Bullock they singe the hair off with Fire as we singe BaconHogs in  England  Then they open it and while the Flesh is yet hot they cut good Collops from off the lean parts and put them into a very tart Vinegar where it remains or hours longer till it is sufficiently soaked and then without more trouble they take it out and eat it with great delight As for Horseflesh I know not whether  they kill any purposely for the Shambles or whether they only do it when they are not likely  o live as I have seen them do their working Bullocks at  Galicia  in  Old Spain  where the Cattel falling down with labour and being so poor and tired that they cannot rise they are slaughtered and sent to Market and I think I never eat worse Beef than at the  Groin  The Horseflesh comes to Market at  Cachao  very frequently and is as much esteemed as Beef Elephants they eat also and the Trunk of this Beast is an acceptable present for a Nobleman and that too tho' the Beast dyes with Age or Sickness For here are but few wild Elephants and those so shy that they are not easily taken But the King having a great number of tame Elephants when one of these dyes 'tis given to the poor who presently fetch away the Flesh but the Trunk is cut in pieces and presented to the  Mandarins  Dogs and Cats are killed purposely for the Shambles and their Flesh is much esteemed by people of the best fashion as I have been credibly informed Great yellow Frogs also are much admired especially when they come fresh out of the Pond They have many other such choice dishes and in all the Villages at any time of the day be it Market day or not there are several to be sold by poor people who make it their Trade The most common sorts of Cookeries next to boiled Rice is to dress little bits of Pork spitted or of them at once on a small skiver and roasted In the Markets also and daily in every Village there are Women sitting in the Streets with a Pipkin over a small Fire full of  Chau  as they call it a sort of very ordinary Tea of a reddish brown colour and 'tis their ordinary drink  The Kingdom of  Tonquin  is in general healthy enough especially in the dry season when also it is very delightsom For the seasons of the year  at  Tonquin  and all the Countries between the  Tropicks  are distinguished into Wet and Dry as properly as others are into Winter and Summer But as the alteration from Winter to Summer and  vice versa  is not made of a sudden but with the interchangeable Weather of Spring and Autumn so also towards the end of the dry season there are some gentle showers now and then that precede the violent wet months and again toward the end of these several fair days that introduce the dry time These seasons are generally much alike at the same time of the year in all places of the Torrid Zone on the same side of the  Equator  but for or degrees on each side of it the weather is more mixt and uncertain tho' inclining to the wet extreme and is often contrary to that which is then settled on the same side of the  Equator  more toward the Tropick So that even when the wet season is set in in the Northern parts of the Torrid Zone it may yet be dry weather for or degrees North of the Line and the same may be said of the contrary Latitudes and Seasons This I speak with respect to the dryness or moisture of Countries in the Torrid Zone but it may also hold good of their Heat or Cold generally for as to all these qualities there is a further difference arises from the make or situation of the Land or other accidental causes besides what depends on the respective latitude or regard to the Sun Thus the Bay of  Campeachy  in the  West Indies  and that of  Bengal  in the East in much the same latitude are exceeding hot and moist and whether their situation being very low Countries and the scarcity and faintness of the Seabreezes as in most Bays may not contribute hereunto I leave others to judge Yet even as to the Latitudes of these places lying near the Tropicks they are generally upon that account alone more inclined to great Heats  than places near the Equator This is what I have experienc'd in many places in such Latitudes both in the  East  and  WestIndies  that the hottest parts of the World are these near the Tropicks especially or Degrees within them sensibly hotter than under the Line it self Many reasons may be assign'd for this beside the accidental ones from the make of the particular Countries Tropical Winds or the like For the longest day at the Equator never exceeds Hours and the Night is always of the same length But near the Tropicks the longest day is about hours and an half and an hour and an half being also taken from the Night what with the length of the day and the shortness of the night there is a difference of three hours which is very considerable Besides which at such places as are about Degrees within the Tropicks or in the Lat of Deg N the Sun comes within or degrees of the Zenith in the beginning of  May  and having past the Zenith goes not above or degrees beyond it before it returns and passeth the Zenith once more and by this means is at least Months within degrees of the Zenith so that they have the Sun in a manner over their Heads from the beginning of  May  till the latter end of  July  Whereas when the Sun comes under the Line in  March  or  September  it immediately posts away to the North or the South and is not days in passing from degrees on one side to degrees on the other side the Line So that by his small stay there the heat cannot be answerable to what it is near the Tropick where he so long continues in a manner Vertical at Noon and is so much longer above the Horrizon each particular day with the intervening of a shorter Night  But to return to  Tonquin  During the wet Months there 'tis excessive hot especially whenever  the Sun breaks out of the Clouds and there is then but little Wind stirring And I have been told by a Gentleman who lived there many Years that he thought it was the hottest place that ever he was in tho' he had been in many other parts of  India  And as to the Rains it has not the least share of them tho' neither altogether the greatest of what I have met with in the Torrid Zone and even in the same Latitude and on the same side of the Equator The wet Season begins here the latter end of  April  or the beginning of  May  and holds till the latter end of  August  in which time are very violent Rains some of many hours others of two or three Days continuance Yet are not these Rains without some considerable intervals of fair Weather especially toward the beginning or end of the Season  By these Rains are caus'd those Landfloods which never fail in these Countries between the Tropicks at their annual Periods all the Rivers then overflowing their Banks This is a thing so well known to all who are any way acquainted with the Torrid Zone that the cause of the overflowing of the  Nile  to find out which the Ancients set their Wits so much upon the Rack and fancied melting of Snows and blowing of  Etesi    and I know not what is now no longer a secret For these Floods must needs discharge themselves upon such low Lands as lie in their way as the Land of  Egypt  does with respect to the  Nile  coming a great way from within the Torrid Zone and falling down from the higher  Ethiopia  And any one who will be at the pains to compare the time of the Landflood in  Egypt  with that of the Torrid Zone in any of the parts of it along which the  Nile  runs will find that of  Egypt  so much later than the o+ther as 'twill be thought reasonable to allow for th  daily progress of the Waters along so vast a trac  of Ground They might have made the same wonderment of any other Rivers which run any long course from out the Torrid Zone but they knowing only the North Temperate Zone and the  Nile  being the only great River known to come thither a great way from a Country near the Line they made that only the subject of their enquiry but the same effect must also follow from any great River that should run from out of the Torrid Zone into the South Temperate Zone And as to the Torrid Zone the yearly Floods and their cause are every where as well known by People there as the Rivers themselves In  America  particularly in  Campeachy  Rivers in  Rio Grande  and others 'tis a vast havock is made by these Floods bringing down sometimes Trees of an incredible bigness and these floods always come at the stated season of the Year In the dry part of  Peru  along the Coasts of  Pacifick  Sea where it never rains as it seldom does in  Egypt  they have not only Floods but Rivers themselves made by the annual falling of Rain on the Mountains within Land the Channels of which are dry all the rest of the year This I have observ'd concerning the River  Ylo  on the Coast of  Peru  in my former Volume p But it has this difference from the Floods of  Egypt  that besides its being a River in the Torrid Zone 'tis also in South Latitude and so overflows at a contrary season of the Year to wit at such time as the Sun being in Southern Signs causes the Rains and Floods on that side the Line  But to eeturn from this digression in  August  the weather at  Tonquin  is more moderate as to heat or wet yet not without some showers and  September  and  October  are more temperate still yet the worst weather in all the year for Seamen is in one of the Months last mentioned for then the violent Storms called  Tuffoons Typhones  are expected  These Winds are so very fierce that for fear of them the  Chinese  that trade thither will not stir out of Harbour till the end of  October  after which Month there is no more danger of any violent Storms till the next year  Tuffoons  are a particular kind of violent Storms blowing on the Coast of  Tonquin  and the neighbouring Coasts in the Months of  July August  and  September  They commonly happen near the full or change of the Moon and are usually preceded by very fair weather small Winds and a clear Sky Those small Winds  er  from the common Trade of that time of the year which is here at S W and shuff  es about to the N and N E Before the Storm comes there appears a boding Cloud in the N E which is very black near the Horizon but towards the upper edge it looks of a dark Copper colour and higher still it is brighter and afterwards it fades to a whitish glaring colour at the very edge of the Cloud This Cloud appears very amazing and ghastly and is sometimes seen Hours before the Storm comes When that Cloud begins to move apace you may expect the Wind presently It comes on fierce and blows very violent at N E Hours more or less It is also commonly accompanied with terrible claps of Thunder large and frequent flashes of Lightning and excessive hard Rain When the Wind begins to aba  e it dies away suddenly and falling slat calm it continues so an hour more or less then the wind comes about to the S W and it blows and rains as fierce from thence as it did before at N E and as long  November  and  December  are very dry wholesom warm and pleasant months  January February  and  March  are pretty dry but then you have thick fogs in the morning and sometimes drisling cold rains the air also in these months particularly in  January  and  February  is very sharp especially  when the wind is at North East or North North East whether because of the Quarter it blows from or the Land it blows over I know not for I have elsewhere observed such Winds to be colder where they have come from over Land  April  is counted a moderate month either as to heat or cold driness or moisture  This is ordinarily the state of their year yet are not these various Seasons so exact in the returns but that there may sometimes be the difference of a month or more Neither yet are the several Seasons when they do come altogether alike in all years For sometimes the Rains are more violent and lasting at other times more moderate and some years they are not sufficient to produce reasonable Crops or else they come so unseasonably as to injure and destroy the Rice or at least to advance it but little For the Husbandry of this Country and other Countreys in the Torrid Zone depends on the Annual Floods to moisten and fatten the Land and if the wet seasons prove more dry than ordinary so as that the RiceLand is not well dranched with the overflowing of the Rivers the Crops will be but mean and Rice being their Bread the staff of Life with them if that fails such a populous Country as this cannot subsist without being beholding to its Neighbours But when it comes to that pass that they must be supplied by Sea many of the poorer sort sell their Children to relieve their wants and so preserve their Lives whilst others that have not Children to sell may be famished and dye miserable in the Streets This manner of Parents dealing with their Children is not peculiar to this Kingdom alone but is customary in other places of the  EastIndies  especially on the Coasts of  Malabar  and  Coromandel  There a famine happens more frequently and rages sometimes to a degree beyond belief for those Countries  are generally very dry and less productive of Rice than  Tonquin  Neither are they such large Rivers to fatten the Land but all their Crop depends on Seasons of Rains only to moisten the earth and when those seasons fail as they do very often then they can have no Crop at all Sometimes they have little or no rain in three or fore years and then they perish at a lamentable rate Such a Famine as this hapned or years before my going to  Fort St George  which raged so sore that thousands of people perished for want and happy were they that could hold out till they got to the Seaport Towns where the  Europeans  lived to sell themselves to them tho' they were sure to be transported from their own Country presently But the famine does never rage so much at  Tonquin  neither may their greatest scarcity be so truly called a famine for in the worst of times there is Rice and 'tis thro' the poverty of the meaner people that so many perish or sell their Children for they might else have Rice enough had they money to buy it with and when their Rice is thus dear all other provisions are so proportionably  There is a further difference between the Countries of  Malabar  and  Coromandel  and this of  Tonquin  that the more Rain they have there the greater is their blessing but here they may have too much rain for the lower part of the Kingdom but that is rare When this happens they have Banks to keep in the Rivers and Ditches to drain the Land tho' sometimes to little purpose when the floods are violent and especially if out of season For if the floods come in their seasons tho' they are great and drown all the Land yet are they not hurtful but on the contrary very beneficial because the mud that they leave behind fattens the Land And after all if the low Land  should be injured by the floods the dry Champion Land yields the better increase and helps out the other as that does them also in more kindly seasons In the dry seasons the low Lands have this advantage that Channels are easily cut out of the River to water them on each side So that let the Seasons be wet or dry this Country seldom suffers much Indeed considering the Number of its inhabitants and the poverty of the Major part it is sometimes here as in all populous Countries very hard with the poor especially the Tradespeople in the large Towns For the Trade is very uncertain and the people are imployed according to the number of Ships that come thither to fetch away their Goods and if but few Ships come hither as sometimes it happens then the poor are ready to famish for want of work whereby to get a subsistance And not only this but most Silk Countries are stockt with great multitudes of poor people who work cheap and live meanly on a little Rice which if it is not very cheap as it commonly is here the poor people are not able to maintain themselves  CHAP III  Of the Natives of  Tonquin  Their Form Disposition Capacity Cloaths Buildings Villages Groves Banks Ditches and Gardens Of  Cachao

Offerings and Prayers Their Language and Learning Their Mechanick Arts Trades Manufactures Commodities and Traffick  TOnquin  is very populous being thick set with Villages and the Natives in general are of a middle stature and clean limb'd They are of a Tawny  Indian  colour but I think the fairest and clearest that I ever saw of that Complexion for you may perceive a blush or change of colour in some of their faces on any sudden surprize of passion which I could never discern in any other  Indians  Their faces are generally flattish and of an oval form Their noses and lips are proportionable enough and altogether graceful Their hair is black long and lank and very thick and they wear it hanging down to their shoulders  Their teeth are as black as they can make them for this being accounted a great ornament they dye them of that colour and are or days doing it They do this when they are about or years old both Boys and Girls and during all the time of the operation they dare not take any nourishment besides Water Chau or some liquid thing and not much of that neither for fear I judge of being poyson'd by the Dye or Pigment So that while this is doing they undergo very severe Penance but as both Sexes so all Qualities the poor as well as the rich must be in this fashion they say they should else be like Brutes and that would be a great shame to them to be like Elephants or Dogs which they compare those to that have white teeth  They are generally dextrous nimble and active and ingenious in any Mechannick Science they profess This may be seen by the multitude of fine Silks that are made here and the curious Lackerwork that is yearly transported from thence They are also laborious and diligent in their Callings but the Country being so very populous many of them are extreme poor for want of employment and tho' the Country is full of Silk and other materials to work on yet little is done but when strange Ships arrive For 'tis the Money and goods that are brought hither especially by the  English  and  Dutch  that puts life into them for the Handicrafts men have not Money to set themselves to work and the Foreign Merchants are therefore forced to trust them with advancemoney to the value of at least a third or half their goods and this for or months or more before they have made their Goods and brought them in So that they having no Goods ready by them till they have Money from the Merchant strangers the Ships that trade hither must of necessity  stay here all the time that their Goods are making which are commonly or months  The  Tonquinese  make very good Servants I think the best in  India  For as they are generally apprehensive and do  il so are they faithful when hired diligent and obedient Yet they are low spirited probably by reason of their living under an Arbitrary Government They are patient in labour but in sickness they are mightily dejected They have one great fault extreme common among them which is gaming To this they are so universally addicted Servants and all that neither the awe of their Masters nor any thing else is sufficient to restrain them till they have lost all they have even their very Cloaths This is a reigning Vice among the Eastern Nations especially the  Chinese  as I said in the th Chaper of my former Volume And I may add that the  Chinese  I found settled at  Tonquin  were no less given to it than those I met with elsewhere For after they have lost their Money Goods and Cloaths they will stake down their Wives and Children and lastly as the dearest thing they have will play upon tick and mortgage their Hair upon honour And whatever it cost 'em they will be sure to redeem it For a free  Chinese  as these are who have fled from the  Tartars  would be as much ashamed of short Hair as a  Tonquinese  of white Teeth  The Cloaths of the  Tonquinese  are made either of Silk or Cotton The poor people and Soldiers do chiefly were Cotton Cloath died to a dark tawny colour The rich men and  Mandarins  commonly were English Broadcloath the chief colours are red or green When they appear before the King they wear long Gowns which reach down to their heels neither may any man appear in his presence but in such a garb The great men have also long Caps made of the same that their Gowns  are made of but the middle sort of men and the poor commonly go bareheaded Yet the Fishermen and such labourers as are by their employments more exposed to the weather have broadbrimm'd Hats made of Reeds Straw or Palmetoleaves These Hats are as stiff as boards and sit not plyant to their heads for which reason they have Bandstrings or Necklaces fastned to their Hats which coming under their chins are there tyed to keep their Hats fast to their Heads These Hats are very ordinary things they seldom wear them but in rainy weather Their other Cloaths are very few and mean a ragged pair of Britches commonly sufficeth them Some have bad Jackets but neither Shirt Stockings nor Shooes  The  Tonquinese  buildings are but mean Their Houses are small and low the Walls are either Mud or Watle bedawbed over and the Roofs are thatched and that very ill especially in the Country The Houses are too low to admit of Chambers yet they have here or partitions on the ground floor made with a watling of Canes or Sticks for their several uses in each of which there is a Window to let in the light The Windows are only small square holes in the Walls which they shut up at night with a Board fitted for that purpose The Rooms are but meanly furnished with a poor Bed or two or more according to the bigness of the family in the inner Room The outer Rooms are furnished with Stools Benches or Chairs to sit on There is also a Table and on one side a little Altar with two Incensepots on it nor is any House without its Altar One of these Incensepots has a small bundle of Rushes in it the ends of which I always took notice had been burnt and the fire put out This outer Room is the place where they commonly dress their food yet in fair weather they do it  as frequently in the open air at their doors or in their yards as being thereby the less incommoded by heat or smoak  They dwell not in lone houses but together in Villages 'tis rare to see a single house by it self The Country Villages commonly consist of or houses and are thick seated over all the Country yet hardly to be be seen till you come to their very doors by reason of the Trees and Groves they are surrounded with And 'tis as rare to see a Grove without a Village in the low Country near the Sea as to see a Village without a Grove but the high Lands are full of Woods and the Villages there stand all as in one great Forest The Villages and Land about them do most belong to great men and the Inhabitants are Tenants that manure and cultivate the ground  The Villages in the low Land are also surrounded with great banks and deep ditches These incompass the whole Grove in which each Village stands  The banks are to keep the water from overflowing their gardens and from coming into their houses in the wet time when all the Land about them is under water or foot deep The ditches or trenches are to preserve the water in the dry time with which they water their gardens when need requires Every man lets water at pleasure by little drains that run inward from the Townditch into his own garden and usually each mans yard or garden is parted from his neighbours by one of these little drains on each side The houses lie scattering up and down in the Grove no where joyning to one another but each apart and fenced in with a small hedge Every house hath a small gate or stile to enter into the garden first for the house stands in the middle of it and the gardens runs also from the backside of the house  to the TownDitch with its drain and hedge on each side In the Gardens every Man has his own Fruittrees as Oranges Limes Betle his Pumpkins Melons Pineapples and a great many Herbs In the dry season these Grovy dwellings are very pleasant but in the wet season they are altogether uncomfortable for tho' fenced in thus with banks yet are they like so many Duckhouses all wet and dirt neither can they pass from one Village to another but Midleg or to their Knees in Water unless sometimes in Boats which they keep for this purpose But notwithstanding these they are seldom out of mire and wet even in the midst of the Village or Garden so long as that season lasts The Inhabitants of the higher part of the Kingdom are not troubled with such inconveniences but live more cleanly and comfortably forasmuch as their Land is never overflown with water and tho' they live also in Villages or Towns as the former yet they have no occasion to surround them with banks or trenches but lie open to the Forest  The Capital City  Cachao  which stands in the high Country about Miles from the Sea on the West side of the River and on a pretty level yet rising Ground lies open in the same manner without wall bank or ditch There may be in  Cachao  about Houses The Houses are generally low the walls of the Houses are of mud and the covering Thatch yet some are built with Brick and the covering with Pantile Most of these Houses have a Yard or Backside belonging to them In each Yard you shall see a small arched building made somewhat like an Oven about six foot high with the Mouth on the Ground It is built from top to bottom with brick all over daub'd thick with mud and dirt If any House wants a yard they have nevertheless such a kind of Oven as this but  smaller set up in the middle of the House it self and there is scarce a House in the City without one The use of it is to thrust their chiefest Goods into when a Fire happens for these low thatch'd Houses are very subject to take fire especially in the dry times to the Destruction of many Houses in an instant that often they have scarce time to secure their Goods in the arched Ovens tho' so near them  As every private Person hath this contrivance to secure his own Goods when a Fire happens so the Government hath carefully ordered necessary means to be used for the preventing of Fire or extinguishing it before it gets too great a Head For in the beginning of the dry Season every Man must keep a great Jar of Water on the top of his House to be ready to pour down as occasion shall serve Besides this he is to keep a long Pole with a Basket or Bowl at the end of it to throw Water out of the Kennels upon the Houses But if the Fire gets to such a head that both these expedients fail then they cut the Straps that hold the Thatch of the Houses and let it drop from the Rafters to the Ground This is done with little trouble for the Thatch is not laid on as ours neither is it tyed on by single Leaves as in the  WestIndies  and many parts of the  EastIndies  where they Thatch with  Palmeto  or Palmtree Leaves but this is made up in Panes of or foot square before it is laid on so that or Panes more or less according to the bigness of the House will cover one side of it and these Panes being only fastned in a few places to the Rafters with Rattans they are easily cut and down drops half the covering at once These Panes are also better than loose Thatch as being more managable in case any of them should fall on or near the Oven where the Goods are for they are easily dragg'd off to another  place The neighbouring Houses may this way be soon uncovered before the Flame comes to 'em and the Thatch either carried away or at least laid where it may burn by it self And for this purpose every Man is ordered to keep a long Pole or Bambo at his Door with a Cuttinghook at the end of it purposely for uncovering the Houses and if any Man is found without his Jar upon the House and his BucketPole and long Hook at his Door he will be punish'd severely for his neglect They are rigorous in exacting this for even with all this caution they are much and often damaged by Fire  The principal Streets in this City are very wide tho' some are but narrow They are most of them pav'd or pitch'd rather with small Stones but after a very ill manner In the wet Season they are very dirty and in the dry time there are many stagnant Ponds and some Ditches full of black stinking Mud in and about the City This makes it unpleasant and a Man would think unwholesome too yet it is healthy enough as far as I perceiv'd or could ever learn  The Kings of  Tonquin  who make this City their constant Residence have two or three Palaces in it such as they be Two of them are very mean they are built with Timber yet have they many great Guns planted in Houses near them Stables for the Kings Elephants and Horses and pretty large square spots of Ground for the Soldiers to draw themselves up regularly before him The Third Palace is called the Palace Royal It is more magnificently built than the other two yet built also with Timber but all open as the Divans in  Turky  are said to be The Wall that incompasseth it is most remarkable It is said to be leagues in circumference The heigth of this Wall is about or foot and almost as many  broad or thick It is faced up on both sides with Brick there are several small Gates to go in and out at but the main Gate faceth to the City This they say is never opened but when the  Boua  or Emperor goes in or comes out There are two smaller Gates adjoyning to it one on each side which are opened on all occasions for any concerned there to pass in and out but Strangers are not permitted this liberty Yet they may ascend to the top of the Wall and walk round it there being Stairs at the Gate to go up by and in some places the Walls are fallen down  Within this Wall there are large Fishponds where also there are PleasureBoats for the Emperor's diversion I shall defer speaking of him whose Prison this is rather than Court till the next Chapter where I shall discourse of the Government  The House of the  English  Factory who are very few is pleasantly seated on the North end of the City fronting to the River 'Tis a pretty handsom lowbuilt House the best that I saw in the City There is a handsome Diningroom in the middle and at each end convenient Apartments for the Merchants Factors and Servants belonging to the Company to live in with other conveniences This House stands parallel with the River and at each end of it there are smaller Houses for other uses as Kitchin StoreHouses c running in a Line from the great House towards the River making two Wings and a square Court open to the River In this square space near the Banks of the River there stands a Flag Staff purposely for the hoysing up the  English  Colours on all occasions for it is the custom of our Countrymen aboard to let fly their Colours on  Sundays  and all other remarkable Days  The  Dutch  Factory joins to the  English  Factory on the South side I was never in it and therefore can say nothing of it but what I have heard that their ground is not so large as ours tho' they are the longest standers here by many years for the  English  are but newly removed hither from  Hean  where they resided altogether before  There is nothing more in or about the City worth noting but only a piece of Work on the same side up the River This is a massy Frame of Timber ingeniously put together and very artificially placed on great Piles that are set upright in the River just by its Banks The Piles are driven firmly into the Ground close one by another and all the space between them and the Bank is filled up with Stones and on them great Trees laid across and pinn'd fast at each end to the Piles so that the whole Fabrick must be moved before any part of it will yield This piece of work is raised about or foot above the Water in the dry time but in the wet Season the Floods come within or foot of the top It was made to resist the violence of the Water in the rainy season for the Stream then presseth so hard against this place that before this Pile was built it broke down the Bank and threatned to carry all before it even to the ruining of the City if this course had not timely been taken to prevent it And so much the rather because there is a large Pond just within Land and low Ground between it and the City So that had it made but a small breach into the Pond it would have come even to the Skirts of the City And tho' the City stands so high as that the Landfloods never reach it yet the Land on which it stands being a sort of yielding Sand could not be thought capable of always resisting such violence For the natural Floods do very often make great changes in the River breaking down  one point of Land and making another point in the opposite side of the River and that chiefly in this part of the Country where it is bounded with high Banks for nearer the Sea where it presently overflows the Floods do seldom make any considerable change and move more quietly  But to return to the People They are courteous and civil to Strangers especially the trading People But the great Men are Proud Haughty and Ambitious and the Soldiers very insolent The poorer sort are very Thievish insomuch that the Factors and Strangers that traffick hither are forced to keep good Watch in the Night to secure their Goods notwithstanding the severe Punishments they have against Thieves They have indeed great Opportunities of Thieving the Houses being so slightly built But they will work a way under Ground rather than fail and use many subtle Stratagems I am a Stranger to any Ceremonies used by them in Marriage or at the Birth of a Child or the like if they use any Polygamy is allowed of in this Country and they buy their Wives of the Parents The King and great Men keep several as their Inclinations lead them and their Ability serves The Poor are stinted for want of means more than desire For tho' many are not able to buy much less to maintain one Wife yet most of them make a shift to get one for here are some very low prized ones that are glad to take up with poor Husbands But then in hard times the Man must sell both Wife and Children to buy Rice to maintain himself Yet this is not so common here as in some Places as I before observed of the  Malabar  and  Coromandel  Coasts This custom among them of buying Wives easily degenerates into that other of hiring Misses and gives great liberty to the young Women who offer themselves of then  own accord to any Ssrangers who will go to their price There are of them of all prizes from Dollars to Dollars and the refuse of all will be caressed by the poor Seamen Such as the  Lascars  who are  Moors  of  India  coming hither in Vessels from  Fort St George  and other places who yet have nothing to give them but such Fragments of Food as their Commons will afford Even the great Men of  Tonquin  will offer their Daughters to the Merchants and Officers tho' their stay is not likely to be above or Months in the Country neither are they affraid to be with Child by  White  Men for thir Children will be much fairer than their Mothers and consequently of greater repute when they grow up if they be Girls Nor is it any great charge to breed them here and at the worst if their Mothers are not able to maintain them 'tis but selling them when they are young But to return the Women who thus let themselves to hire if they have been so frugal as to save what they have got by these loose Amours they soon procure Husbands that will love and esteem them well enough and themselves also will prove afterwards obedient and faithful Wives For 'tis said that even while they are with Strangers they are very faithful to them especially to such as remain long in the Country or make annual returns hither as the  Dutch  generally do Many of these have gotten good Estates by their  Tonquin  Ladies and that chiefly by trusting them with Money and Goods For in this poor Country 'tis a great advantage to watch the Market and these female Merchants having stocks will mightily improve them taking their opportunities of buying raw Silk in the dead time of the Year With this they will employ the poor People when work is scarce and get it cheaper and better done than when Ships are here for then every man being employed  and in a hurry of business he will have his price according to the haste of Work And by this means they will get their Goods ready against the Ships arrive and before the ordinary working Season to the profit both of the Merchant and the  Pagally  When a Man dies he is interr'd in his own Land for here are no common Buryingplaces And within a Month afterwards the Friends of the deceased especially if he was the Master of the Family must make a great Feast of Flesh and Fruit at the Grave 'Tis a thing belonging to the Priests Office to assist at this solemnity they are always there and take care to see that the Friends of the deceased have it duly performed To make this Feast they are obliged to sell a piece of Land tho' they have Money enough otherways Which Money they bestow in such things as are necessary for the Solemnity which is more or less according to the quality of the deceased If he was a great Man there is a Tower of Wood erected over the Grave it may be or Foot square and built or foot high About yards from the Tower are little Sheds built with Stalls to lay the Provisions on both of Meat and Fruits of all sorts and that in great plenty Thither the Country People resort to fill their Bellies for the Feast seems to be free for all Comers at least of the Neighbourhood How it is drest or distributed about I know not but there the People wait till 'tis ready Then the Priest gets within the Tower and climbs up to the top and looking out from thence makes an Oration to the People below After this the Priest descends and then they set Fire to the Foundation of the Tower burn it down to the Ground and when this is done they fall to their Meat I saw one of these GraveFeasts which I shall have elsewhere occasion to mention  The  Tonquinese  have two Annual Feasts The chief is at the first NewMoon of the  NewYear  and their NewYear begins with the first NewMoon that falls out after the middle of  January  for else that Moon is reckon'd to the Old Year At this time they make merry and rejoyce or days and then there is no business done but every Man makes himself as fine as may be especially the common sort These spend their time in gaming or sporting and you shall see the Streets full of People both Citizens and Country Folks gazing at several diverting Exercises Some set up Swings in the Streets and get Money of those that will swing in them The Frames are contrived like ours in the Fields about  London  in Holiday times but they who swing stand upright in the lower part of the Swing which is only a stick standing on each end being fastned to a pendulous Rope which they hold fast with their hands on each side and they raise themselves to such a prodigious heighth that if the Swing should break they must needs break their Limbs at best if not kill themselves outright Others spend their time in drinking Their ordinary Drink is Tea but they make themselves merry with hot Rack which sometimes also they mix with their Tea Either way it hath an odd nasty taste but is very strong and is therefore much esteemed by them especially at this time when they so much devote themselves to Mirth or Madness or even bestial Drunkenness The richer sort are more reserved yet they will also be very merry at this time The Nobles treat their friends with good Cheer and the best Rack but indeed there is none good in this Country Yet such as they have they esteem as a great Cordial especially when Snakes and Scorpions have been infused therein as I have been informed This is not only accounted a great Cordial but an Antitode against the Leprosie and  all sorts of Poyson and 'tis accounted a great piece of respect to any one to treat him with his Liquor I had this relation from one that had been treated thus by many o  the great men They also at this time more e  ecially chew abundance of Betle and mak presents thereof to one another  The Betle Leaf is the great entertainment in the East for all Visitants and 'tis always given with the Arek solded up in it They make up the Arek in pellets sit for use by first peeling off the outer green hard rind of the Nuts and then splitting it lengthways in or parts more or less according to its bigness Then they dawb the Leaf all over with  Chinam  or Lime made into a Mortar or Paste and kept in a Box for this purpose spreading it thin  And here by the way I shall take notice of a slip in the former Volume p which I desire may be corrected the Nut being there by mistake call'd the Betle and the Arektree call'd the Betletree whereas  Betle  is the name of the Leaf they chew In this Leaf thus spread with  Chinam  they roll up a slice of  Arek Nut  very neatly and make a pellet of about an Inch long and as big as the top of ones finger Every man here has a Box that will hold a great many of these pellets in which they keep a store ready made up for all persons of what quality soever from the Prince to the Beggar chew abundance of it The poorer sort carry a small pouchful about with them But the  Mandarius  or great men have curious oval Boxes made purposely for this use that will hold or Betle Pellets These Boxes are neatly lackered and gilded both inside or outside with a cover to take off and if any stranger visits them especially  Europeans  they are sure among other good entertainment to be treated with a Box of Betle The Attendant that brings it holds it to the left  hand of the stranger who therewith taking off the cover takes with his right hand the Nuts out of the Box 'Twere an affront to take them or give or receive any thing with the left hand which is confined all over  India  to the viler uses  It is accounted good breeding to commend the taste or neatness of this present and they all love to be flatter'd You thereby extreamly please the Master of the House and ingage him to be your friend and afterwards you may be sure he will not fail to send his Servant with a present of Betle once in two or three mornings with a complement to know how you do This will cost you a small gratuity to the Servant who joyfully acquaints his Master how gratefully you received the Present and this still engages him more and he will complement you with great respect whenever he meets you I was invited to one of these Newyears Feasts by one of the Country and accordingly went ashore as many other Seamen did upon like invitations I know not what entertainment they had but mine was like to be but mean and therefore I presently left it The staple Dish was Rice which I have said before is the common food Besides which my friend that he might the better entertain me and his others Guests had been in the morning a fishing in a Pond not far from his house and had caught a huge mess of Frogs and with great joy brought them home as soon as I came to his house I wonder'd to see him turn out so many of these creatures into a Basket and asking him what they were for he told me to eat but how he drest them I know not I did not like his Dainties so well as to stay and dine with him  The other great Feast they have is after their  May  crop is hous'd about the beginning of  June  At this Feast also they have publick Rejoycing but much inferiour to those of their Newyears Feast  Their Religion is Paganism and they are great Idolaters Nevertheless they own an omnipotent supream overruling power that beholds both them and their actions and so sar takes notice of them as to reward the good and punish the bad in the other world For they believe the immortality of the Soul but the notion that they have of the Deity is very obscure Yet by the Figures which they make representing this God they manifestly shew that they do believe him to excel in sight strength courage and wisdom justice c For tho' their Idols which are made in human shapes are very different in their forms yet they all represent somewhat extraordinary either in the countenance or in the make of the body or limbs Some are very corpulent and fat others are very lean some also have many eyes others as many hands and all grasping somewhat Their aspects are also different and in some measure representing what they are made to imitate or there is somewhat in their hands or lying by them to illustrate the meaning of the Figure Several passions are also represented in the countenance of the Image as love hatred joy grief I was told of one Image that was placed sitting on his Hams with his Elbows resting on his knees and his Chin resting on his Thumbs for the supporting his Head which lookt drooping forwards his Eyes were mournfully lifted up towards Heaven and the figure was so lean and the countenance and whole composure was so sorrowful that it was enough to move the beholder with pity and compassion My Friend said he was much affected with the sight thereof  There are other Images also that are in the shape of Beasts either Elephants or Horses for I have not seen them in any other shape The  Pagodas  or Idol Temples are not sumptuous and magnificent as in some of the Neighbouring Kingdoms  They are generally built with Timber and are but small and low yet mostly covered with Pantile especially the City  Pagodas  but in the Country some of them are thatched I saw the Horse and Elephant Idols only in the Country and indeed I saw none of the Idols in the City  Cachao  but was told they were generally in humane shapes  The Horse and Elephant Images I saw were both sorts about the bigness and height of a good Horse each standing in the midst of a little Temple just big enough to contain them with their heads towards the door and sometimes one sometimes two together in a Temple which was always open There were up and down in the Country other buildings such as  Pagodas  or Temples Tombs or the like less than these and not above the heighth of a man but these were always shut so close that I could not see what was within them  There were many  Pagan  Priests belonging to these  Pagodas  and 'tis reported that they are by the Laws tied to strict rules of Living as abstinence from Women and strong drink especially and enjoined a poor sort of Life Yet they don't seem to confine themselves much to these Rules but their subsistence being chiefly from Offerings and there being many of them they are usually very poor The Offerings to the Priest is commonly or  handfuls of Rice a box of Betle or some such like present One thing the people resort to them for is Fortunetelling at which they pretend to be very expert and will be much offended if any dispute their skill in that or the truth of their Religion Their Habitations are very little and mean close by the  Pagodas  where they constantly attend to offer the petitions of the poor people that frequently resort thither on some such errand For they have no set times of Devotion neither do they seem to esteem one day above another except  their Annual Feasts The people bring to the Priest in writing what Petition they have to make and he reads it aloud before the Idol and afterwards burns it in an Incensepot the Supplicant all the while lying prostrate on the Ground  I think the  Mandarins  and rich people seldom come to the  Pagodas  but have a Clerk of their own who reads the Petition in their own Courts or Yards and it should seem by this that the  Mandarins  have a better sense of the Deity than the common People for in these Yards there is no Idol before whom to perform the Ceremony but 'tis done with Eyes lift up to Heaven When they make this Petition they order a great deal of good meat to be drest and calling all their Servants into the Court where the Ceremony is to be persormed they place the food on a Table where also Incensepots are placed and then the  Mandarin  presents a paper to the Clerk who reads it with an audible voice In the first place there is drawn up an ample account of all that God has blest him withal as Health Riches Honour Favour of his Prince c and long Life if he be old and towards the conclusion there is a Petition to God for a continuance of all these blessings and a farther augmentation of them especially with long life and favour of his Prince which last they esteem as the greatest of all Blessings While this paper is reading the Master kneels down and bows his face down to the Earth and when the Clerk has done reading it he puts it to the burning rushes that are in the Incensepot where 'tis consum'd Then he flings in  or little bundles of sacred paper which is very fine and gilded and when that also is burnt he bids his Servans eat the Meat This Relation I had from an  English  Gentlemen who understood the Language very well and was present at such a Ceremony This burning of paper seems a great Custom  among the Eastern Idolaters and in my former Volume I observed the doing so by the  Chinese  in a Sacrifice they had at  Bencouli  The  Tonquinese  Language is spoken very much through the throat but many words of it are pronounced through the teeth It has a great affinity to the  Chinese  Language especially the  Fokein  dialect as I have been informed and tho' their words are differently pronounced yet they can understand each others writings the characters and words being so near the same The Court Language especially is very near the  Chinese  for the Courtiers being all Scholars they speak more elegantly and it differs very much from the vulgar corrupted Language But for the  Malayan  Tongue which Monsieur  Tavernier  's Brother in his History of  Tonquin  says is the Court Language I never could hear by any person that it is spoken there tho I have made particular inquiry about it neither can I be of his opinion in that matter For the  Tonquinese  have no manner of Trade with any  Malayans  that I could observe or learn neither have any of their neighbours and for what other grounds the  Tonquinese  should receive that language I know not It is not probable that either Conquest Trade or Religion could bring it in nor do they travel towards  Malacca  but towards  China  and commonly 'tis from one of these causes that Men learn the language of another Nation The remarkable smoothness of that Language I confess might excite some people to learn it out of curiosity but the  Tonquinese  are not so curious  They have Schools of Learning and Nurseries to tutor youth The Characters they write in are the same with the  Chinese  by what I could judge and they write with a hair Pencil not sitting at a Table as we do but stand upright They hold their Paper in one hand and write with the other  making their Characters very exact and fair They write their lines right down from the top to the bottom beginning the first line from the right hand and so proceeding on towards the left After they can write they are instructed in such Sciences as their Masters can tutor them in and the Mathematicks are much studied by them They seem to understand a little of Geometry and Arithmetick and somewhat more of Astronomy They have Almanacks among them but I could not learn whether they are made in  Tonquin  or brought to them from  China  Since the Jesuits came into these parts some of them have improved themselves in Astronomy pretty much They know from them the Revolution of the Planets they also learn of them natural Philosophy and especially  Ethic  s  and when young Students are admitted to make Graduates they pass through a very strict examination They compose something by way of trial which they must be careful to have wholly their own for if it is found out that they have been assisted they are punished degraded and never admitted to a second examination  The  Tonquinese  have learnt several Mechanick Arts and Trades so that here are many Tradesmen  viz  Smiths Carpenters Sawyers Joyners Turners Weavers Tailors Potters Painters Moneychangers Papermakers Workers on Lacker were Bellfounders c Their Saws are most in frames and drawn forwards and backwards by two men Moneychanging is a great Profession here It is managed by Women who are very dextrous and ripe in this employment They hold their Cabals in the night and know how to raise their Cash as well as the cunningest Stockjobber in  London  The  Tonquinese  make indifferent good Paper of two sorts One sort is made of Silk the other of the rinds of Trees This being pounded well with wooden Pestles in large Troughs make the best writing Paper  The vendible Commodities of this Kingdom are Gold Musk Silks both wrought and raw some Callicoes Drugs of many sorts Wood for Dying Lacker Wares EarhenWares Salt Anniseed Wormseed c There is much Gold in this Country It is like the  China  Gold as pure as that of  Japan  and much finer Eleven or twelve  Tale  of Silver brings one of Gold A Tale is the Name of a Summ about a Noble  English  Besides the raw Silk fetched from hence here are several sorts of wrought Silks made for Exportation  viz Pelongs Sues Hawkins Piniasco's  and  Gaws  The  Pelongs  and  Gaws  are of each sort either plain or flowered very neatly They make several other sorts of Silk but these are the principal that are bought by the  English  or  Dutch  The Lakerd Ware that is made here is not inferior to any but that of  Japan  only which is esteemed the best in the World probably because the  Japan  Wood is much better than this at  Tonquin  for there seems not any considerable difference in the Paint or Varnish The  Lack  of  Tonquin  is a sort of gummy Juice which drains out of the Bodies or Limbs of Trees It is gotten in such quantities by the Country People that they daily bring it in great Tubs to the Markets at  Cachao  to sell especially all the working Season The natural colour is white and in substance thick like Cream but the Air will change its colour and make it look blackish And therefore the Country People that bring it to Town cover it over with or sheets of Paper or Leaves to preserve it in its fresh native colour The Cabinets Desks or any sort of  Frames to be Lackered are made of Fir or Ponetree but the Joyners in this Country may not compare their Work with that which the  Europeans  make and in laying on the Lack upon good or fine joyned work they frequently spoil the joynts edges or corners of Drawers of Cabinets Besides our fashions of Utensils differ mightily from theirs and for that reason Captain  Pool  in his second Voyage to the Country brought an ingenious Joyner with him to make fashionable Commodities to be lackered here as also Dealboards which are much better than the Ponewood of this Country  The Workhouses where the Lacker is laid on are accounted very unwholesome by reason of a poisonous quality said to be in the Lack which fumes into the Brains through the Nostrils of those that work at it making them break out in Botches and Biles yet the scent is not strong nor the smell unsavoury The Labourers at this Trade can work only in the dry Season or when the drying North Winds blow for as they lay several Coats of Lack one on another so these must all have time to be throughly dry before an outer Coat can be laid on the former It grows blackish of it self when exposed to the Air but the Colour is heightned by Oil and other ingredients mixt with it When the outside Coat is dry they polish it to bring it to a gloss This is done chiefly by often rubbing it with the ball or palm of their Hands They can make the Lack of any colour and temper it so as to make therewith good Glew said to be the best in the World It is also very cheap and prohibited Exportation They make Varnish also with the Lack  Here is also  Turpentine  in good plenty and very cheap Our Captain bought a considerable quantity for the Ships use and of this the Carpenter  made good Pitch and used it for covering the Seams after they were caulked  The Earthen Ware of this Country is course and of a grey Colour yet they make great quantities of small Earthen Dishes that will hold half a Pint or more They are broader towards the brim than at the bottom so that they may be stowed within one another They have been sold by  Europeans  in many of the  Malayan  Countries and for that reason Capt  Pool  in his first Voyage bought the best part of in hopes to sell them in his return homeward at  Batavia  but not finding a Market for them there he carried them to  Bencouli  on the Island  Sumatra  where he sold them at a great profit to Governor  Bloom  And he also sold most of them at good Advantage to the Native  Malayans  there yet some thousands were still at the Fort when I came thither the Country being glutted with them Capt  Weldon  also bought or and carried them to  Fort St George  but how he disposed of them I know not The  China  Wares which are much finer have of late spoiled the sale of this Commodity in most places Yet at  Rackan  in the Bay of  Bengall  they are still esteemed and sell at a good rate  The several sorts of Drugs bought and sold here are beyond my Knowledge but here is  China  root Galingame Rhubarb Ginger c Neither do I know whether any of these grow in this Country for they are mostly imported from their Neighbours tho' as to the Ginger I think it grows here Here is also a sort of Fruit or Berry said to grow on small Bushes called by the  Dutch Annise  because its s  nt and taste is strong like that of the Anniseed This Commodity is only exported hence by the  Dutch  who carry it to  Batavia  and there  stil it among their Arack togive it an Anniseed b  vour This sort of Arack is not sit to make  Punch with neither is it used that way but for want of plain Arack It is only used to take a Dram of by it self by the  Dutch  chiefly who instead of Brandy will swallow large doses of it tho' it be strong but 'tis also much used and estemed all over the  EastIndies  There is one sort of Dyingwood in this Country much like the  Campeachy  Logwood tho' whether the same or Wood of greater value I know not I have heard that 'tis call'd  Sappan  Wood and that it comes from  Siam  It was smaller than what we usually cut in the Bay of  Campeachy  for the biggest stick that I saw here was no bigger than my Leg and most of it much smaller and crooked They have other sort of Dyes but I can give no account of them They dye several Colours here but I have been told they are not lasting They have many sorts of good tall Timbertrees in this Country fit for any sorts of building but by relation none very durable For Masting the Fir and Ponetrees are the best Here is much Wormseed but it grows not in this Kingdom It is brought from within the Land from the Kingdom of  Boutan  or from the Province of  Yunam  bordering on this Kingdom yet belonging to  China  From thence comes the Musk and Rhubard and these three Commodities are said to be peculiar to  Boutan  and  Yunam  The Musk grows in the Cods of Goats The same Countries yield Gold also and supply this Country with it for whatever Gold Mines the  Tonquinese  are said to have in their own Mountains yet they do not work upon them  With all these rich Commodities one would expect the People to be rich but the generality an very poor considering what a Trade is driven here For they have little or no Trade by Sea them selves except for Eatables as Rice and Fill  which is spent in the Country but the main Trade of the Country is maintained by the  Chinese English Dutch  and other Merchant Strangers who either reside here constantly or make their annual Returns hither These export their Commodities and import such as are vendible here The Goods imported hither besides Silver are Saltpeter Sulphur  English  Broadcloath Cloathrashes some Callicoes Pepper and other Spices Lead great Guns c but of Guns the long Saker is most esteemed For these Commodities you receive Money or Goods according to contract but the Country is so very poor that as I formerly observed the Merchant commonly stays or Months for his Goods after he has paid for them because the Poor are not employed till Ships arrive in the Country and then they are set to work by the Money that is brought thither in them The King buys great Guns and some pieces of Broadcloath but his pay is so bad that Merchants care not to deal with him could they avoid it But the Trading People by all accounts are honest and just That I heard a Man say who had traded there ten Years in which time he dealt for many thousands of pounds that he did not in all that time lose  l  by them all  CHAP IV  Of the Government of  Tonquin  The Kings  Boua  and  Choua  the Revolt of the  Cochinchinese  and Original of the present Constitution at  Tonquin  Of the  Boua's  confinement and the  Choua  's or ruling Kings Person and Government and the Treasure Elephants and Artillery Their manner of making Gunpowder Of the Soldiers their Arms Employment c Of the Naval Force their fine Gallies and Management of them The Watch kept in their Towns their Justice and punishing of Debtors and Criminals of all sorts Of the Eunuch  Manda  rins Their Promotion and Dispositions Of their swearing upon a draught of Hens Blood and the Trial by bitter Waters in  Guinea  Of the  Mandarins  Entertainments The Chopsticks used at Meals and their kindness to Strangers  THis Kingdom is an absolute Monarchy but of such a kind as is not in the World again for if has two Kings and each supreme in his particular way The one is called  Boua  the other  Choua  which last Name I have been told signifies  Masier  The  Boua  and his Ancestors were the sole Monarchs of  Tonquin  tho' I know not whether as independant Soveraigns or as Tributaries to  China  of which they have been thought to have been a  ro  tier Pro  ince if not a Colony for there is a great  between them in their Language  Religion and Customs These Kings they have at present are not any way related in their Descent or Families nor could I learn how long their Government has continued in the present form but it appears to have been for some Successions The occasion is variously reported but some give this account of it  The  Boua  's or antient Kings of  Tonquin  were formerly Masters of  Cochinchina  and kept that Nation in subjection by an Army of  Tonquinese  constantly kept there under a General or Deputy who rul'd them When  Cochinchina  threw off the  Tonquinese  Yoak the King had two great Generals one in  Cochinchina  and another in  Tonquin  it self These two Generals differing he who was in  Cochinchina  revolted from his Soveraign of  Tonquin  and by his Power over the Army there made himself King of  Cochinchina  since which these two Nations have always been at Wars yet each Nation of late is rather on the defensive part than on the offensive But when the General who commanded in  Cochinchina  had been thus successful in his Revolt from under the  Boua  the  Tonquinese  General took the Courage to do so too and having gained the Affections of his Army deprived the King his Master of all the Regal Power and kept it with all the Revenues of the Crown in his own Hands yet leaving the other the Title of King probably because of the great zeal the People had for that Family And thus the Kingdom came wholly into the Power of this  Tonquinese  General and his Heirs who carry the Title of  Choua  the  Boua's  of the Ancient Family having only the shadow of that Authority they were formerly Masters of The  Boua  lives the Life of a kind of a Prisoner of State within the old Palace with his Women and Children and diverts himself in Boats among his Fishponds  within the Palace Walls but never stirs without those bounds He is held in great Veneration by all the  Tonquinese  and seemingly by the  Choua  also who never offers any violence to him but treats him with all imaginable respect The People say they have no King but  Boua  and seem to have sad apprehensions of the loss they should have if he should dye without an Heir and whenever the  Choua  comes into his prefence which is or times in the year he useth abundance of Compliments to him and tells him that his very Life is at his service and that he governs and rules wholly to do him a kindness and always gives him the upper hand So also when any Ambassadors are sent from the Emperor of  China  they will deliver their Message to none but the  Boua  and have their Audience of him Yet after all this Pageantry the  Boua  has only a few Servants to attend him none of the  Mandarins  make their Court to him nor is he allow'd any Guards All the Magistracy and Soldiery Treasure and the ordering of all Matters of Peace or War are entirely at the  Choua  's disposal all preferment is from him and the very Servants who attend the  Boua  are such only as the  Choua  places about him Besides these Servants none are ever suffer'd to see the  Boua  much less Strangers So that I could learn nothing as to his Person But as to the  Choua  I have been informed that he is an angry illnatured leprous Person He lives in the second Palace where he has ten or twelve Wives but what Children I know not He governs with absolute Authority over the Subjects and with great tyranny for their Lives Goods and Estates are at his Command The Province of  Tenehoa  is said to have belonged properly to his Ancestors who were grea  Mandarins  before the usurpation So that he now  e  s to have a particular value  for it and keeps his Treasure there which by report is very great This Treasure is buried in great Cisterns full of Water made purposely for that use and to secure it he keeps a great many Soldiers there and commits the charge both of them and the Treasure to the Governour of the Province who is one of his principal Eunuchs  The  Choua  has always a strong guard of Soldiers about his Palace and many large Stables for his Horses and Elephants The Horses are about or hands high and are kept very fat there are or of them The Elephants are kept in long Stables by themselves each having a peculiar room or partition with a Keeper to dress and feed him The number of the King's Elephants are about or They are watered and washed every day in the River  Some of the Elephants are very gentle and governable others are more indocil and unruly When these rude ones are to pass through the Streets tho' only to be watered the Rider or Dresser orders a Gong or Drum to be beaten before him to warn People that an unruly Elephant is coming and they presently clear the Streets and give a passage for the Beast who will do mischief to any that are in the way and their Riders or Keepers cannot restrain him  Before the  Choua  's Palace there is a large parade or square place for the Soldiers to be drawn up On one side there is a place for the  Mandarins  to sit and see the Soldiers exercise on the other side there is a shed wherein all the Cannon and heavy Guns are lodged There may be or Iron Guns from Falcon to DemyCulverin or whole Culverin or DemiCannon and some old Iron Mortars lying on logs The Guns are mounted on their Carriages but the Carriages of these Guns are old and very ill made There is one  great Brass Gun much bigger than the rest supposed to be or pound weight It is of a taper bore of a foot diameter at the mouth but much smaller at the britch It is an ill shaped thing yet much esteemed by them probably because it was cast here and the biggest that ever they made It was cast about or years ago and it being so heavy they cou'd not contrive to mount it but were beholding to the  English  to put it into the Carriage where it now stands more for a show them service But tho this is but an ordinary piece of workmanship yet the  Tonquinese  understand how to run Metals and are very expert in tempering the Earth wherewith they make their mould  These are all the great Guns that I saw or heard of in this Kingdom neither are here any Forts yet the King keeps always a great many Solders 'Tis said that he has always or constantly in pay These are most Foot they are arm'd with  Curtans  or Sword and HandGuns of foot and an half or foot in the Barrel The bore is about the bigness of our Horse Pistols they are all Matchlocks and they are very thick and heavy The Soldiers do all make their own Powder They have little Engins for mixing the ingredients and make as small a quantity as they please They know not how to corn it and therefore it is in unequal lumps some as big as the top of a mans Thumb and some no bigger than a white Pea neither have I seen any Powder well corn'd that has been made in any of these Eastern Nations  The Soldiers have each a Cartage Box covered with leather after the manner of the  WestIndian  Privateers but instead of Paper Cartages these are filled with small hollow Canes each containing a load or charge of Powder which they empty out of the Cane into the Gun so that each Box has in it as it were so many Bandeleers Their Arms are kept  very bright and clean for which purpose every one of them has a hollow Bambo to lay over the Barrel of his Gun and to keep the dust from it as it lies over the wrack in his House When they march also in rainy weather they have another Bambo to cover their Guns This is large enough to cover the whole Barrel and very well lacker'd so that it is not only handsome but also preserves the Gun dry  The Soldiers when they march are led by an Officer who is leader of the File and every File consists of men but as I have been informed by one who has seen them march they don't keep their ranks in marching The Soldiers are most of them lusty strong well made men for 'tis that chiefly recommends them to the Kings service They must also have good Stomachs for that is a greater recommendation than the former neither can any ma  be entertain'd as a Soldier that has not a greater stroke than ordinary at eating for by this they judge of his strength and constitution For which reason when a Soldier comes to be listed his Stomach is first proved with Rice the common subsistence of the ordinary People in this Kingdom and according as he acquits himself in this first tryal of his manhood so he is either discharged or entertain'd in the service 'Tis reported that at these Tryals they commonly eat or cups of Rice each containing a pint and they are ever afterwards esteem'd and advanced according to the first days service and the greatest eaters are chiefly imploy'd as guards to the King and commonly attend on his person The Province of  Ngean  breeds the lustiest men and the best eaters for that reason those of that Province are generally imploy'd as Soldiers After years service a Soldier may petition to be disbanded and then the Village where he was born must send another Man to serve in his room  The Horsemen are but few and armed with Bows and long Spears or Lances like the  Moors  and  Turks  Both these and the Foot Soldiers are very dexterous in using their weapons and shoot very well either with Gun or Bow for they are often exercised by shooting at Marks The King orders a shooting match once a year and rewards the best marksman with a fine Coat or about  Cash  as 'tis called which is a summ above the value of a Dollar The mark is a white earthen Cup placed against a Bank The distance they stand to fire at it is about yards He who breaks the first Cup has the finest Coat for there are others also of less worth and finery for the rest that have the good fortune to break the other Cups or  Cash  in lieu of them This is all at the Kings charge who incourages this exercise very much as a means to make them good Marksmen and they generally prove such They will load and fire the quickest of any People They draw the Rammer at one motion and powring down the Powder and Bullet they ram all down at one motion more Then they withdraw the Rammer and put it into its place at motions more All the motions are performed very dexterously and quick and when they shoot at a mark they level and fire at first sight yet very successfully  Tho' the King of  Tonquin  has no Forts yet he keeps always a great many Soldiers in the Frontier Towns of his Kingdom especially on the S W part thereof to check the  Cochinchinese  his implacable Enemies and tho' there seldom happens a pitch'd Battel between them yet there are often Skirmishings which keep the Soldiers on each side upon thier guards and sometimes there are considerable excursions made by one or other party into the Enemies Territories where they  kill spoil and bring away what Booty they can find The King also has always about near his person and quarter'd in or about  Cachao  ready on all occasions The dry season is the time for his Armies to take the Field or go against an Enemy for in these Countries there is no marching in the Wet season When he sends an Army by Land on any expedition the General and other great Officers are mounted on Elephants These have neat little boarded Houses or Castles fastned on their backs where the great men sit in state secur'd from the Sun or Rain They have no Fieldpieces in their Armies but instead thereof they carry on mens backs Guns that will carry a four ounce Shot The barrels of these Guns are about or foot long but tho' one man carries one of them on his back yet he cannot hold it out to fire like small Guns but rests it on its Carriage which is another Man's burden and they two manage it between them The Carriage is only a round piece of Wood about inches thick and or foot long One end of the Carriage is supported with two Legs or a Fork of three foot high the other rests on the ground The Gun is placed on the top where there is an Iron Socket for the Gun to rest in and a Swivel to turn the Muzzel any way From the britch of the Gun there is a short stock for the man who fires the Gun to traverse it withal and to rest it against his shoulder The use of these Guns is to clear a Pass or to fire over the Rivers when the Enemy is so commodiously plac'd that there is no other way to move him and they are carry'd by these two men almost with as much ease as Muskets In these Landexpeditions they carry but little Baggage besides their necessary Arms Ammunition and Provender so that if they are routed they lightly scamper away and generally  in these Countries the Dispute is soon  over for they will not long sustain a smart Onset  Besides the Soldiers on the Frontiers and those who attend the King about  Cachao  he has many others that keep guards in several parts of his Kingdom especially in the great Roads and on the Rivers These search all exported goods to see that no prohibited goods are sent out of the Kingdom especially Arms and no prohibited goods brought in They also look after the Custome and see that all goods have paid before they may pass further All Travellers are also search'd by them and strictly examined and if any persons are taken only on suspicion they are used very severely till they can clear themselves so that no disaffected or rebellious person can stir without being presently known and this renders the King very safe in his Government  The Kings Navalforce consists only in a sort of flat bottom Gallies and these seemingly designed more for State than service except to transport Soldiers from one place to another These Vessels are or foot long and about or foot broad in the waste and the ends near as many foot high out of the water especially the hinderpart or Stern but the waste or middle of the Vessel is not above foot and an half from the water that being the place by which all the men go in and out from thence towards each end it is gently and very artificially raised to a considerable heighth so that the whole fabrick appears very graceful and pleasant as it moves on the water The head or forepart is not altogether so high as the Stern neither is there so much cost bestowed on it for ornament for tho' it wants neither carv'd work or painting yet 'tis not comparable to that of the Stern which has great variety of carving and is curiously lacker'd and gilded The place  where the Captain sits in is the Stern and is neatly covered to keep off the Sun or the Rain and it being higher than any other part of the Vessel appears like a little Throne especially that of the General's Galley This is more magnificent than the rest tho' all are built much of one form From the Stern to the waste it is covered over with a slight covering to shelter the Men and their Arms from the Rain in the wet season and the scorching Sun in the dry Before the waste there are places for the Oars on each side and a plain  ven Deck for the Rowers to stand by their ta  kling Each Galley carries a small brass Gun either Minion or Saker which is planted afore and looks out through a Port in the Bow They have a small Mast and Matt Sail and they are rowed with from  to Oars  The Soldiers are always the men that row and they are all naked except that they have a narrow piece of black Cloath like a Sash about their Wastes which is brought between their Thighs and tuckt again under their Waste Every one stands upright behind his Oar which lies in its  otch on the Gunnal and he thrusts or pushes it forward with a great strength and they plunge their Oars all at one instant into the Water keeping exact time with each other and that they may the better do this there is one that strikes on a small Gong or a wooden Instrument before every stroke of the Oar Then the Rowers all at once answer with a sort of a hollow noise through the Throat and a stamp on the Deck with one foot and immediately plunge their Oars into the Water Thus the Gong and the Rowers alternately answer each other making a sound that seems very pleasent and warlike to those who are at a small distance on the Water or Shoar  These Boats draw about foot and a half water They are only serviceable in Rivers or at Sea near the Shoar and that in very fair weather too They are best in the broad Rivers near the Sea where they may take the advantage of the Tides to help them for tho' they row pretty swift when they are light yet when they have or men aboard as sometimes they have they are heavy and row slowly against the stream Nevertheless when there is occasion they must go against the stream a great way tho' they perform it with great labour  The Soldiers in these Vessels are equipt with Bows Swords and Lances and when many of them are sent on any expedition they are divided into Squadrons They are distinguished by their several Flags of different colours as appeared by an expedition they made up the River against some of their Northern Neighbours while we were there There were then about of these Galleys sent out up the River and they had from to Soldiers in each all well armed Their General was called  Ungee Comei  who was a great  Mandarin  and was the person appointed by the King to inspect into our  English  Traffick being made director or protector of the  English  Factory who used to speak of him as a generous man There were two more great Officers under him each in a Vessel by himself These three had Flags of distinction the first was yellow the second blue the third red or green They went away from  Cachao  towards the Mountains but did not return while we were there but since we came from thence I have been informed that the expedition prov'd fruitless and that the General  Ungee Comei  was much disgraced  When the Galleys are not in service they are dragged ashoar and placed in Houses built for that purpose where they are set upright on their bottoms made very clean and kept neat and dry These GalleyHouses are or paces from the River side and when they bring the Galleys into them there is a strong Rope brought round the stern of the Vessel and both ends stretched along one on each side then or Men standing ready with the Rope in their Hands wait for the signal which being given by the beat of a Gong they begin to draw withal their strength and making a great shrieking noise they run her up in a trice into her place This also is their Soldiers work who having thus Housed all their Galleys return to their Landservice  Some of the Soldiers are employed also in keeping Watch and Ward for the security of private Men as well as in the King's business and the  Tonquinese  are observ'd to keep good orders in the Night in all Towns and Villages but more particularly in the great Cities and especially at  Cachao  There every Street is guarded with a strong Watch as well to keep silence as to hinder any disorder The Watchmen are armed with Staves and stand in the Street by the Watchhouses to examin every one that passeth by There is also a Rope stretched cross the Street breast high and no Man may pass this place till he is examin'd unless he will venture to be soundly bang'd by the Watch These Men can handle their Weapon so well that if they design mischief they will dextrously break a Leg or Thighbone that being the place which they commonly strike at There is a pair of Stocks by every Watchhouse to secure Night Ramblers in but for a small piece of Money a Man may pass quiet enough and for the  most part only the poor are taken up These Watchmen are Soldiers but belong to the Governor or some other Men of great Power who will hear no Complaints against them tho' never so justly made and therefore they often put Men in the Stocks at their pleasure and in the Morning carry them before a Magistrate who commonly fines the Prisoners to pay somewhat and be it more or less it falls part to the Magistrate Neither dares any Man complain of injustice upon such usage in this case especially tho' his cause be never so just and therefore patience is in this Country as necessary for poor People as in any part of the World  But notwithstanding these Abuses they have one Custom in the Administring Justice that is pleasing enough For if a difference or quarrel at any time happens between mean Men and they are not to be reconciled without going before a Magistrate he usually considering their Poverty lays no heavy mulct on the Offender but injoins him this as his penalty that he shall treat the injur'd Person with a Jarr of Arack and a Fowl or a small Porker that so feasting together they may both drown all animosity in good Liquor and renew their Friendship  But if it be a Controversy about a Debt they take a very different Method For the Debtors are many times order'd to be Prisoners in their Creditors houses where they are beaten or kept with a log of Wood made fast to their Legs to hinder them from running away These poor Prisoners eat nothing but Rice and drink Water and are tyranically insulted over by their rigid Creditors till the Debt is satisfied Their Corporal Punishments upon Malefactors and some times upon others are very severe Some an loaden with Iron Chains fastned to their  with logs also like the Debtors but now mentioned Others have their Necks inclosed between grea  heavy Planks made like a Pillory but moveable for they carry it about with them whereever they go and even when they go to rest they are forced to lye down and sleep in it as they can  There is another sort of punishing Instrument not unlike this called a  Gongo  This also is made to wear about the Neck but is shaped like a Ladder The sides of it are large Bamboes of about or foot long with several such rounds or sticks as Ladders have to keep the sides asunder but much shorter for the side Bamboes are no farther asunder than to admit of a narrow room for the Neck and the rounds in the middle are much at the same distance from each other on each side the Neck forming a little Square thro' which the Man looks as if he were carrying a Ladder on his Shoulders with his Head thro' the rounds If either of these Yokes were to be taken off in a short time as in or hours it would be no great matter but to wear one of them a Month or longer as I have been informed they sometimes do seems to be a very severe punishment Yet 'tis some comfort to some that they have the Liberty to walk abroad where they will but others are both yoak'd and imprison'd and the Prisoners in publick Prisons are used worse than a Man would use a Dog they being half starved and soundly beaten to boot  They have a particular punishment for such as are suspected to fire Houses or who are thought to have occasioned the Fire through their neglect The Master of the House where the Fire first breaks out will hardly clear himself from suspicion and the severity of the Law The punishment in this case is to sit in a Chair of or foot high bareheaded whole days successively in the hot scorching Sun this Chair is set for his greater disgrace before the place where his House stood  Other smaller Crimes are punished with blows which we call Bambooing The Criminal is laid flat on his Belly on the Ground with his Britches pluckt down over his Hams in which posture a lusty Fellow bangs his bare Britch with a split Bambo about fingers broad and foot long The number of his Blows are more or less according to the nature of the Crime or the pleasure of the Magistrate yet Money will buy favour of the Executioner who knows how to moderate his strokes for a Fee beforehand Otherwise his blows usually fall so heavy that the poor Offender may be lamed a Month or two After a Man has suffered any of these punishments he can never obtain any publick favour or employment  They have no Courts of Judicature but any single Magistrate issues out his Warrants for the apprehending of Malefactors and upon taking them immediately tries them and as the Sentence is final and without appeal so 'tis no sooner past but 'tis executed also without more ado Their punishment in capital crimes is usually beheading The Criminal is carried immediately from the Magistrates House to his own for there is no common place of Execution but the Malefactor suffers near his own House or where the fact was committed There he is placed sitting on the Ground with his Body upright and his Legs stretched out and the Executioner being provided with a large  Curtane  or Backsword and striking a full back blow on the Neck at one stroke he severs the Head from the Body the Head commonly tumbling down into the owners lap and the Trunk falling backward on the Ground  Theft is not thought worthy of Death but is punished with cutting off some Member or part of a Member according to the degree of the offence For sometimes only one joynt of a Finger  is chopt off for other Crimes a whole Finger or more and for some the whole Hand  The Magistrates and other great Men of this Kingdom are called  Mandarins  Most of them in Office about the King are Eunuchs and not only gelded but also their Members cut quite off quite flat to their Bellies These as I have been informed are all very learned Men after their way especially in the Laws of the Country They rise gradually by their merit or favour from one degree to another as well they who are employed in Civil as in Military Affairs And scarce place of trust or profit goes beside them No Man is permitted to walk familiarly about the King's Palace without the leave of the Eunuch  Mandarins  and for this Reason having such free access to the King themselves and excluding whom they will they engross his favour This is taken so much to Heart by some that through envy and discontent they often pine away as is commonly said even to Death And I heard of such an one who was called  Ungee Thuan Ding Ungee  seems a Title of Honour among them He was a Man of great Learning in the Laws extremely Politick and mighty high Spirited This Man sought all the means imaginable to be preferred but could not for want of being an Eunuch He fretted to see his Inferiours raised but plainly seeing that there was no rising without removing that objection he one day in a rage took up a sharp Knife and qualify'd himself effectually He had a Wife and or Children who were all in great fear of his Life but  he was not at all dismayed tho' in that condition and the King advanced him He was living when I was there and was a great  Mandarin  He had the care of the Armory and Artillery being great Master of the King's Ordnance  There was another  Mandarin  also one  Ungee Hane  who finding himself baffled by the Eunuchs was forced to make himself one to be upon the level with them This Gentleman it seems was Lord of a Village or two where both he and his Tenants were often plagued with the domineering Eunuchs and having born their Malice for some time and seeing no end of it he agreed with an expert Gelder to castrate him For here are many in this Country who profess this Art and are so expert at it that they will undertake to cut a Man of any Age for so many thousand Cash as the Man is Years old 'Tis reported that they first put the Patient into a Sleep But how long they are curing hm after the Operation is over I know not I heard of but three  Mandarins  of any grandeur in the Government who were not Eunuchs One was the Governour of the  East  Province whose Daughter was married to a Prince of the Royal Family The other two who were Governours of  Cachao  were also married Men and had Children and one of these married the Kings Daughter All the  Mandarins  rule with absolute Power and Authority in their several Precincts yet in great Obedience to the King who is as absolute over them as they are over the Common People  These Eunuch  Mandarins  especially live in great State Many of these have command of the Soldiery and have Guards attending them at their own Houses There being a certain number of Soldiers allowed to attend on each  Mandarin  according to his Quality They are generally covetous beyond measure and very malicious Some of them are Governours of Provinces but all are raised to Places of trustand profit  Once every Year the  Mandarins  receive an Oath of Allegiance to the King from all the principal  Officers under them This is done with great Ceremony they cut the Throat of a Hen and let the Blood fall into a Bason of Arack Of this Arack every Man has a small draught given him to drink after he has publickly declared his sincerity and readiness to serve his Prince 'Tis esteemed the solemnest tye by which any Man can ingage himself This way of giving solemn potions to drink is used also in other Countries on different occasions As particularly on the  Gold Coast  of  Guinea  where when Men or Women are taxed for a Crime be it of what Nature it will but especially Adultery and the matter cannot be proved by Evidence the  Fetissero  or Priest decides the difference by giving a Potion of bitter Water to the Person accused which if they refuse to take they are supposed to be guilty without farther proof but if they drink it off the event is said to be that if the Persons be guilty this Water immediately swells their bodies till they burst but if innocent they are not hurt thereby What tricks the  Fetissero's  may play in compounding this Water I know not but this kind of Tryal is frequent among them and seems to be a remainder of the old  Jewish  Tryal by the Waters of jealousy spoken of in the th Chapter of  Numbers  I am not sufficiently inform'd whether the Event of the Tryal be such as it was among the  Jews  but it seems they have a strong perswasion of it and a guilty Person does ordinarily so dread the being brought to this Trial that for the most part he or she choose rather to suffer the punishment of the Country which is to be sold to  Europeans  as Slaves This potion is called Bitterwater and 'tis given by way of Trial upon any light suspicion even of a small injury This account I have had from several who have been in  Guinea  but especially from Mr  Canby  But to return to the Eunuch  Mandarins  tho' they are bitter Enemies to those whom they take  aversion against yet on the other Hand they are as kind to their Favourites and as complacent to their Visitants whether Foreigners or others feasting them often They Love mightily to be visited esteeming themselves highly honoured thereby When they treat any they are best pleased with those who Eat and Drink heartily for this they suppose proceeds from their Love and hearty Affection to them And indeed the  Tonquineers  in general are very free to their Visitants treating them with the best cheer they are able to procure  In their entertainments and at their ordinary eating instead of Forks and Spoons they use two small round sticks about the length and bigness of a Tobacco Pipe They hold them both in the right Hand one between the fore Finger and Thumb the other between the middle Finger and the fore Finger as our Boys do their Snappers They use them very dextrously taking up the smallest grain of Rice with them nor is it accounted mannerly to touch the Food after it is drest with their Hands And tho' it be difficult for strangers to use them being unaccustom'd to them yet a little use will overcome that difficulty and Persons that reside here ought to learn this as well as other customs of the Country that are Innocent that so their Company may be more acceptable All the  Tonquineses  keep many of these Sticks in their Houses as well for their own use as to entertain Strangers at Meals They are as ordinarily placed at the Table here as Knives Forks and Spoons are in  England  And a Man that cannot dextrously handle these Instruments makes but an odd figure at their Tables The richer sort of People especially the  Mandarins  have them tipt with Silver In  China  also these things are constantly used they are called by the  English  Seamen  Chopsticks  When the Eunuch  Mandarins  dye all their riches sall to the King who as Heir presently seizeth on their Estates and by it gets vast Riches For there is but little Money in the Kingdom but what falls into the Clutches of these Birds of Prey This probably may be one Reason why the King is for preferring none but them for they are excellent Spunges for him and whatever some have said of their Love to Justice I could never learn that they deserve that Character But thro' their oppression and injurious dealings trading is discouraged and the Country is kept Poor which otherwise might be a flourishing Kingdom After all as very Eunuchs as these  Mandarins  are yet they are as great admirers of the Female Sex as any Men and not satisfied without them but they all keep several handsome young Wenches to dally and spend their time withal They also love to be courted by Strangers to favour them with a Miss of their procuring Nothing will ingage them more than to petition them on this account and the Person thus solicited will not fail to procure a young Damsel for his Friend be it but for a night or two or for or Months Ever afterwards he will take a more than ordinary care of the Persons he has thus brought together and their affairs and this base sort of Office is here accounted very decent and honourable Yet the common Baudyhouses tho' extreamly rife here are by all of them accounted hateful and scandalous  CHAP V  Some Vessels sent from  Cachao  to  Tenan  to fetch Rice A Rencounter with some suppos'd Robbers  Cash  a sort of Coin and PearlOysters The Author's second Journey up to  Cachao  Of the  Pagoda  's and Funeral Tower and Feast he met by the way the  French  Bishops and Missionaries at  Hean  their House the Author's entertainment there and discourse with one of their Priests The state of their Mission and of Christianity in these Idolatrous Countries His making of GunPowder He goes on from  Hean  to  Cachao  and after a short stay there back again to the Ships Of the Improvements that might be made of our  English  Factory here The Author's departure from  Tonquin  I Have already spoken of my first going up the River to  Cachao  and my returning back again to our Ships after a few days There I lay on board for a great while and sickly for the most part yet not so but that I took a Boat and went ashoar one where or other almost every day and by this means I took as particular notice as I could of the Country and have supplied my own observations with those of our Merchants residing there and other Persons of Judgment and Integrity  During this interval Rice being dear at  Cachao  as it had been for some time both our Merchants and Natives were for making up a Fleet of small  Vessels to fetch Rice from the Neighbouring Provinces both for their own use and to supply the Markets and they never go in single Vessels for fear of Pirates who infest the Coasts with their Canoas and shelter themselves among several little Islands lying at the edge of the East Province and bordering upon the Province of  Tenan  whither these Merchants were bound  Captain  Weldon  was one who concerned himself in this expedition hiring a Vessel and Seamen of the  Tonquinese  and sending some of his own Men with them as a Guard among whom I would very fain have gone had I not been indisposed Mr  Ludford  who had liv'd sometime at  Cachao  before our arrival was another Undertaker and went himself on board the Bark he had hired but Captain  Weldon  staid behind at the City yet took care to get a Commission from the Governour of the EastProvince for his Vessel In the Commission 'twas exprest that his Boat should be armed with  or other Weapons and that his Men should resist any that came to oppose them or any Vessels in their Company and that they might kill and destroy any Robbers that they met with The Passage to  Tenan  lay most within Land thro' Creeks and narrow Channels among the Islands beforementioned which are so many and lye on the Eastside of the Bay so thick together and so nigh the shoar that at a small distance off at Sea they appear to be part of the Main This little  Archipelago  lies within the precincts of the Governour of the EastProvince from whom Captain  Weldon  had his Commission and who was a very great Man in the Court of  Tonquin  When the Fleet came to this place some who lay here came forth and they concluded they must be the Pirates come to seize their Prey as at other times These always choose rather to take the outwardbound  Vessels because then they have all of the  Cash or Money aboard to purchase their Ladings but in their returns they would have only Rice which these People do not so much regard At this time Captain  Weldon  's  Dutch  Pilot the chief Man whom he sent in his Bark was aboard Mr  Ludford  's and when the supposed Pirates came up Mr  Ludford  and he made the Seamen row the Bark to meet them and in a short time got so near that they fired at them These Men not expecting to have met such a reception for the  Tonquinese  have no Guns but in the King's Gallies thought to save themselves by Flight but were so eagerly pursued by Mr  Ludford  that at last they yielded to his Mercy after they had lost one Man in Fight He joyful of this success secured the Prisoners and made the best of his course to the next Town on the Coast in his way there delivering up his Prisoners to the Magistrates and giving a full relation of the Action He expected a reward for his pains or at least to be highly applauded for it but found himself mistaken For the Prisoners obstinately denying what was alledged against them by Mr  Ludford  saying they were poor Fishermen they were immediately acquitted as very honest Persons and Mr  Ludford  was accused for committing a Riot on Men who were about their lawful occasions Mr  Ludford  brought many of the Natives that were in his company to justify what he had done but to no purpose for he was fined  Cash  as our Merchants call it for the Man that was killed  Cash  are a small kind of CopperMoney and 'tis the only Coin they have of their own if it be their own and not rather brought them from  China  They rise and fall in value according to the want or plenty of them or as the Womenexchangers can manage them but at this time they were at  the rate of a Dollar a thousand so that his fine was Dollars When Mr  Ludford  saw how hard it was like to go with him he thought to clear himself or lessen his fine by bringing Captain  Weldon  into the snare saying that he had no Guns in his Bark but made use of Captain  Weldon  's and that Captain  Weldon  's Pilot was aboard his Vessel and assisted in the Action But neither did this help him for upon trying the matter at  Cachao  whither 'twas carried by Appeal Captain  Weldon  's Commission saved him so that Mr  Ludford  was forced to pay the Money which was more than he got by the Voyage This might be a warning to him how he meddled with  Tonquin  Pirates again for it was not enough for him to plead that they came with an intent to rob him Indeed if he had been robb'd he might have been pitied by the Magistrates on complaint of his misfortune but yet it is very probable that if he should have taken them in the very fact possest of his Goods these Vermin would have had one hole or another to creep out at so corrupt are the great Men of this Kingdom And indeed 'tis not improbable that these Fellows were Fishermen and going about their business For there is good Fishing in all the Bay of  Tonquin  clear round it and there are many Boats that go out a fishing and the Fishermen are generally very honest and harmless Men except now and then they attempt to make a prize of some poor Vessel they meet and can overcome by their numbers without fighting for such an one they board and strip all the Men naked even to there Skin Among these Islands also by report their are plenty of Pearl Oysters that have good Pearls in them but the Seamen are discouraged from fishing for them by the King for he seizeth on all he finds But this by their way nor was any thing else observable in this Voyage to  Tenan  These Vessels were or weeks in their Voyage to and from  Tenan  And at their return Captain  Weldon  's Bark went not up to  Cachao  with the Rice but unladed it into our Ship to supply us Soon after this I went a second time up to  Cachao  not in a Boat as before but on Foot along the Country being desirous to see as much of it as I could and I hired a  Tonquinese  for about a Dollar to be my Guide This tho' but a small matter was a great deal out of my Pocket who had not above Dollars in all which I had gotten on board by teaching some of our young Seamen Plain Sailing  This was all I had to bear my own charges and my Guides and 'twas the worse with me because I was forced to make short Journeys every Day by Reason of my Weakness It was about the latter end of  Nov  when we set out We kept on the Eastside of the River where we found the Roads pretty dry yet in some places dirty enough We ferry'd over several Creeks and Brooks running into the great River whese are Ferry Boats always plying which have a few Cash for their fare The Feaver and Ague which I brought with me from  Achin  was gone yet the Fruits I eat here especially the small Oranges brought me into a Flux However tho' I was but weak yet I was not discouraged from this Journey being weary of lying still and impatient of seeing somewhat that might further gratify my curiosity  We found no Houses of Entertainment on the Road yet at every Village we came we got Houseroom and a Barbacue of split Bambooes to sleep on The People were very civil lending us an earthen Pot to dress Rice or any thing else Usually after Supper if the Day was not shut in I took a ramble about the Village to see what was worth taking notice of especially the  Pagoda  of  the place These had the Image of either an Horse an Elephant or both standing with the Head looking out of the Doors The  Pagodas  themselves were but small and low I still made it dark Night before I returned to my Lodging and then I laid me down to sleep My Guide carried my SeaGown which was my covering in the night and my Pillow was a Log of Wood but I slept very well tho' the weakness of my Body did now require better accommodation  The third day after my setting out about a Clock in the afternoon I saw before me a small Tower such as I mentioned before as erected for a time in honour of some great Person deceased But I knew not then the meaning of it for I had not seen the like before in the Country As I came nearer to it I saw a Multitude of People most of them Men and Boys and coming nearer still I saw a great deal of Meat on the Stalls that were plac'd at a small distance from the Tower This made me conclude that it was some great Market and that the Flesh I saw was for sale Therefore I went in among the Croud as well to see the Tower as to buy some of the Meat for my Supper it being now between and a Clock in the Afternoon My Guide could not speak  English  neither could I speak the  Tonquinese  Language So I askt him no questions about it and he too went readily in with me it may be not knowing my intent was to buy First I went round the Tower and viewed it It was foursquare each side about foot broad at the Ground the heighth of it was about foot but at the top somewhat narrower than at the bottom I saw no door to enter into it it seemed to be very slightly built at least covered with thin boards which were all joyned close together and painted of a dark reddish colour I then went on to the Stalls which  had sheds built over them and there I viewed the Fruits and Flesh each of which was ranged in order apart I past by abundance of Oranges packt up in Baskets which I think were the fairest I ever saw and for quantity more than I had seen gathered all the time I was at  Tonquin  I past by these and seeing no other Fruit I came to the FleshStalls where was nothing but Pork and this also was all cut into quarters and sides of Pork I thought there might be or Hogs cut up thus and all seemed to be very good Meat When I saw that there was none of it in small pieces fit for my use I as was customary in the Markets took hold of a quarter and made signs to the Master of it as I thought to cut me a piece of or Pound I was ignorant of any ceremony they were about but the superstitious People soon made me sensible of my errour For they assaulted me on all sides buffeting me and renting my Cloaths and one of them snatched away my Hat My Guide did all he could to appease them and dragg'd me out of the Crowd Yet some surly Fellows followed us and seemed by their Countenance and Gestures to threaten me but my Guide at last pacify'd them and fetched my Hat and we marched away as fast as we could I could not be informed of my Guide what this meant but sometime after when I was return'd to our Ship the Guide's Brother who spoke  English  told me it was a Funeral Feast and that the Tower was the Tomb which was to be burned and some  English  Men who lived there told me the same This was the only Funeral Feast that ever I was at among them and they gave me cause to remember it but this was the worst usage I received from any of them all the time that I was in the Country When I was out of this trouble my Guide and I marched forwards  I was both weary and hungry and I think my appetite was raised by seeing so much Food For indeed at first sight of it I concluded to have had a good Supper but now I was likely to sup only on Rice or a Yam roasted and two Eggs as I us'd to do For tho' there were Fowls to be bought at every House where I lay yet my Pocket would not reach them and for other Flesh there was none to be had unless my way had lain thro' the Town when it was Market day with them  Two Days after this I got with much ado to  Hean  for my Flux encreased and my strength decreased I presently made towards the  French  Bishops as the likeliest place for me both to rest at and get larger Informations of the Country from the  European  Missionaries whose seat it is The Bishop's Palace is a pretty neat low House standing at the North end of the Town by the side of the River 'Tis encompassed with a pretty high Wall and has a large Gate to enter at The Gate stands fronting to the Street and runs up with Houses on both sides and ends at the Palace Within the Wall there is a small Yard that goes round the Palace and at the farther end of the Yard there are small lodgingrooms for the Servants and other necessary Offices The House it self is not very large nor high it stands not in the middle of the Yard but rather nearest the Gate which Gate is open all day but shut in the Night That part that fronts the Gate has a pretty neat Room which seems to be designed for the reception of Strangers for it has no communication with any other Room in the House tho' joyned to it as one building the Door by which you enter it fronts to the Gate and this Dooor also stands open all the day  When I came hither I entred the Gate and seeing no Body in the Yard I went into that Room At the Door thereof I found a small Line hanging down which I pull'd and a Bell ringing within gave notice of my being there yet no Body appearing presently I went in and sate down There was a Table in the middle of the Room and handsome Chairs and several  European  Pictures hung upon the Walls  It was not long before one of the Priests came into the Room to me and received me very civilly With him I had a great deal of Discourse He was a  French  Man by Nation but spoke  Spanish  and  Portuguese  very well It was chiefly in  Spanish  that we entertained each other which I understood much better than I could speak yet I ask'd him Questions and made a shift to answer him to such Questions as he asked me and when I was at a loss in my  Spanish  I had recourse to  Latin  having still some smatterings of what I learnt of it at School in my youth He was very free to talk with me and first asked me my business thither I told him that my business was to  Cachao  where I had been once before that then I went by Water but now I was moved by my curiosity to travel by Land and that I could not pass by any  Europeans  without a Visit especially such a famous place as this He asked me many other Questions and particularly if I was a  Roman  Catholick I told him no but falling then into a Discourse about Religion he told me what Progress the Gospel was like to make in these Eastern Nations First he began with the  Nicobar  Islands and told me what I have related of that matter in the Chapter of my  Voyage round the World  page for this was the Person I there quoted and from whom I had that Relation as he told me he had it from the Friar who wrote to him from  Fort St George  But  that Friar having been a Passenger in Captain  Weldon's  Ship from one of the  Nicobar  Islands to  Fort St George  I askt the Captain's opinion of that relation since my writing that Book and he gave me a quite contrary account of the People of  Nicobar  that they were a very perverse false and thievish People and did not deserve the good character the Friar gave of them  But to proceed with the discourse I had with the  French  Priest at  Hean  He told me that in  Siom  the Gospel was in a very fair way to receive incouragement by the means of a  French  Bishop there and several Ecclesiasticks he had with him there to assist him That the great Minister of State  Constant Falcon  had embraced the  Romish  Faith and that the King was very much inclined to it the Courtiers also seeming well enough pleased with it Insomuch that 'twas hop'd that in a short time the whole Nation would be converted And that tho' the Country People in general were against it yet by the example of the King and his Court the rest might come over by degrees especially because the Priests had free Toleration to use their endeavours As for  Tonquin  he told me that the People in general were inclined to embrace the  Christian  Faith but that the Government was wholly averse to it that the Missionaries who lived here did not openly profess to be Teachers of their Doctrine but that they lived here under the notion of Merchants and not as ClergyMen that this was a great Obstacle to Christianity yet nevertheless they found ways to draw the People from their Ignorance that at present they had about  Converts and more coming in daily He told me that here were two Bishops I think both  French  Men one of them was entitled the Bishop of  Ascalon  the other of  Auran  and that here were  ten Priests of  Europe  and three more of the Natives of  Tonquin  who had been ordain'd Popish Priests But since I have been informed that these  French  Bishops were not suffered to live at  Cachao  neither may they at any time go thither without a Licence from the Governour and such a Licence also must be procur'd by the Favour of some  Mandarin  who lives at  Cachao  for whom the Bishop or other Missionary is to perform some trivial Work or other For the Missioners living here are purposely skill'd in mending Clocks Watches or some Mathematical Instruments of which the Country People are Ignorant and this gives them the opportunity of being often sent for to  Cachao  by the  Mandarins  And when they are there a small job that would not require above or Hours to perform they will be twice as many days about pretending great difficulty in the work by which means they take their liberty privately to teach their Disciples that live there and then also they enjoy themselves with the  English  and  Dutch  Merchants to whom they are always welcome  As to the Converts these People have made I have been credibly informed that they are chiefly of the very poor People and that in the scarce times their Alms of Rice have converted more than their preaching and as to those also who have been converted as they call it that is to Beads and new Images and belief in the Pope they have fallen off again as Rice grew plentiful and would no longer be Christians than while the Priests administred Food to them Yet I cannot think but that these People who have such Notions of a supreme Deity might by the industry and example of good Men be brought to embrace the Christian Faith But as things stand at present it seems very improbable that Christianity should fructify there For as the  English  and  Dutch  in these parts of the World are too loose Livers to gain Reputation to their Religion so are the other  Europeans  I mean the Missionary Priests especially the  Portuguese  but very blind Teachers But indeed as the Romanists are the only Men who compass Sea and Land to gain Proselytes so they may seem to have one advantage over  Protestant  Ministers in these Idolatrous Countries that they present them with such kind of Objects for Religious Worship as they have been used to already For the exchange is not great from  Pagan  Idols to Images of Saints which may serve altogether as well for the poor Souls they convert who are guided only by sense But then even here also these People having been bred up in the belief of the goodness of their own Gods or Heroes they will more hardly be brought over to change their own Idols for new ones without some better Arguments to prove these to be more valuable than the Missionaries ordinarily are able to afford them and If I may freely speak my opinion I am apt to think that the gross Idolatry of the Papists is rather a prejudice than advantage to their Missions and that their first care should be to bring the People to be virtuous and considerate and their next to give them a plain History and Scheme of the Fundmental Truths of Christianity and shew them how agreeable they are to natural light and how worthy of God  But to return to the  French  Priest he at length asked me if any of our  English  Ships brought Powder to sell I told him I thought not Then he asked me if I knew the composition of Powder I answered that I had receipts how to make either Cannon or fine Powder and told him the manner of the Composition Said he I have the same receipts from  France  and have tryed to make Powder but could not and therefore I think the  fault is in our Coals Then he asked me many questions about the Coals what were proper to be used but that I could not satisfie him in He desired me to try to make a pound and withal told me that he had all the ingredients and an Engine to mix them I was easily perswaded to try my skill which I had never yet tried not knowing what I might be put to before I got to  England  and having drank a glass or two of Wine with him I went to work and it succeeded so well that I pleased him extremely and satisfied my own desire of trying the Receipt and the Reader shall have the History of the Operation if he pleases He brought me Sulphur and Saltpetre and I weighed a portion of each of these and of Coals I gathered up in the hearth and beat to powder While his Man mixed these in a little Engine I made a small Sieve of Parchment which I pricked full of Holes with a small Iron made hot and this was to corn it I had large Coconuts to roul in the Sieve and work it thro' the holes to corn it When it was dry we proved it and it answer'd our expectation The Receipt I had out of Captain  Sturmey's Magazin  of Arts  The being so successful in this put me afterwards on the renewing of Powder at  Bencouli  when I was there Gunner of that Fort There being then about Barrels damnified which was like mud they took it out of the Cask and put it into earthen Jars that held about Barrels a piece These they call  Montaban  Jars from a Town of that name in  Pegu  whence they are brought and carried all over  India  In these 'twas intended to send the Powder to  Fort St George  to be renewed there But I desired the Governour to let me first try my skill on it because we had but little Powder in the Fort and might have wanted before any returns could be expected  from thence The Saltpetre was sunk to the bottom of the Jars but I mixt it and beat it altogether and corned it with Sieves which I made of my own old Parchment Draughts I made thus Barrels full of very good Powder before I went from thence The  French  Priest told me in conclusion that the Grandees make all their own Powder and since I have been informed that the Soldiers make Powder as I have already said  I spent the remainder of the day in the Palace with the Priest He told me that the Bishop was not well otherwise I should have seen him and that because it was a Fish day I could not expect such entertainment as I might have had on another day yet he ordered a Fowl to be broiled for my Dinner and I dined by my self In the Evening he sent me out of the Palace desiring to be excused that he could not entertain me all night yet he ordered his Man to lodge me in a  Tonquinese  Christian House not far from thence The People were civil but very poor and my Lodging such as I had met with on the Road I have since been told that the new Christians come to do their Devotion in the Palace at Night and for that reason probably I was so soon dismist  I was now again pretty well refreshed and might have gone to  Cachao  City a foot but fearing my strength I chose to go by Water Therefore I sent back my Guide yet before he departed back to our Ships he bargained with a  Tonquinese  Waterman for my Passage to  Cachao  The Tide not serving presently to imbark I walked about the Town and spent the Day in viewing it in the Evening I embarked and they choose an Evening for coolness rowing  all night The Boat was about the bigness of a  Gravesend  Wherry and was used purposely to carry Passengers having a small covering overhead to keep them dry when it rained There were or more of these Boats that went up this Tide full of Passengers In our Boat were about Men and Women besides or that rowed us The Women chose their places and sate by themselves and they had much respect shewed them but the Men stowed close together without shewing any respect more to one than to another yet all very civil I thrust in among the thickest of them at first but my Flux would not suffer me to rest long in a place About midnight we were set ashore to refresh our selves at a Baiting place where there were a few Houses close by the Rivers side and the people up with Candles lighted Arack and Tea and little spits of Meat and other Provisions ready drest to receive us For these were all Houses of entertainment and probably got their living by entertaining Passengers We stayed here about an hour and then entered again on our Boat and rowed forwards The Passengers spent the time in merry Discourse or Singing after their way tho' to us it seems like crying but I was mute for want of a person I could converse with About or a clock the next day I was set ashore the rest of the Passengers remained in the Boat but whither they were bound I know not nor whither the Boat went quite up to  Cachao  I was now or mile short of the City but in a good path for the Land here was pretty high level and sandy and the Road plain and dry and I reached  Cachao  by Noon I presently went to one Mr  Bowyers  House who was a free Merchant with whom Captain  Weldon  lodged and staid with them a few days but so weak with my Flux which daily encreased that I was s  a  e able to  go about and so was forced to learn by others in a great measure several particulars relating to this place This my weakness joyned with my disappointment for I found that I was not like to be employed in any Voyage to the Neighbouring Countries as it had been purposed to me made me very desirous of returning back again as soon as might be and it hapned opportunely that Captain  Weldon  had by this time done his business and was preparing for his departure  I went therefore down the River again to our Ships in a Vessel our Merchants had hired to carry their Goods aboard from  Cachao  Among other freight there were Bells of about weight each which had been cast at  Cachao  by the  Tonquinese  for my Lord  Falcon  the King of  Siam  's chief Minister of State and for the use of some of the Christian Churches in  Siam  The person who bespoke them and was to carry them was Captain  Brewster  who had not very long before come from  Siam  in a Ship of that King's and had been cast away on the Coast of  Tonquin  but had saved most of his Goods With these he traded at  Cachao  and among other goods he had purchased to return with to  Siam  were these Bells all which he sent down to be put on Board Captain  Weldon  's Ship But the Bark was no sooner come to  Hean  in going down the River but the Governor of  Hean  's Officers came on board the Bark and seized the Bells in behalf of the chief of the  English  Factory who understanding they were designed for the King of  Siam  which they were not so sure of as to the rest of the goods and the  English  being then at War with the  Siamers  he made this his pretence for seizing them and got the Governor to assist him with his Authority and the Bells were accordingly carried ashore and kept at  Hean  This was thought a very strange  action of the chief of the Factory to seize Goods as belonging to the King of  Siam  while they were in a River of  Tonquin  but he was a person but meanly qualified for the station he was in Indeed had he been a man of spirit he might have been serviceable in getting a Trade with  Japan  which is a very rich one and much cove  ed by the Eastern people themselves as well as  Europeans  For while I was there there were Merchants came every year from  Japan  to  Tonquin  and by some of these our  English  Factory might probably have settled a Corespondence and Traffick but he who was little qualified for the station he was in was less sit for any new undertaking and tho' men ought not to run inconsiderately into new discoveries or undertakings yet where there is a prospect of profit I think it not amiss for Merchants to try for a Trade for if our Ancestors had been as dull as we have been of late 'tis probable we had never known the way so much as to the  EastIndies  but must have been beholden to our Neighbours for all the product of those Eastern Nations What care was formerly taken to get us a Trade into the  E Indies  and othet Countries What pains particularly did some take to find out the  Muscovites  by doubling the North  Cape  and a way thence by land Trade into  Persia  but now as if we were cloy'd with Trade we sit still contented saying with  Cato Non minor est virtus quam quaerere parta tuiri  This was the saying of an eminent Merchant of the  EastIndia  Company to me but by his leave our Neighbours have encroached on us and that in our times too However 'tis certainly for the interest of our Merchants to imploy sit men in their Factories since the reputation of the Company riseth or falls by the discreet management or ill conduct of the Agents Nor is it enough for the chief of a Factory to be a good Merchant and an honest  man for tho' these are necessary Qualifications yet the Governour or chief of the Factory ought to know more than barely how to buy sell and keep Accompts Especially where other  European  Merchants reside among them or trade to the same places for they keep a diligent Eye on the management of our Affairs and are always ready to take all Advantages of our Misimprovements Neither ought this care to be neglected where we have the Trade to our selves for there ought to be a fair understanding between us and the Natives and care taken that they should have no reason to complain of unjust dealings as I could shew where there has been but 'tis an invidious subject and all that I aim at is to give a caution But to the matter in hand it seemed to me that our Factory at  Tonquin  might have got a Trade with  Japan  and to  China  as much as they pleased I confess the continual Wars between  Tonquin  and  Cochinchina  were enough to obstruct the designs of making a Voyage to this last and those other places of  Champa  and  Cambodia  as they are less known so was it more unlikely still to make thither any profitable Voyages yet possibly the difficulties here also are not so great but resolution and industry would overcome them and the profit would abundantly compensate the trouble  But to proceed we found there was no recovering the Bells so we fell down from  Hean  to our Ships and Captain  Weldon  coming to us in a few days and Captain  Brewster  with him to go as a Passenger in his ship together with one or two more and Ships who came with us being also ready for their departure we all weighed anchor and took leave of  Tonquin  CHAP VI  They set sail out of the Bay of  Tonquin  Of the R and Country of  Cambodia  Of  Chinese  Pirates settled there and the  Buggasses  a sort of Soldiers under the King of  Siam  both routed by the  English  in his service They pass by  Pulo Condore  are in fear of the King of  Siam  and enter the Streights of  Malacca  by  Brewster's  Streights They arrive at  Malacca  The Story

his Men and Vessel The State of Trade in those parts and the Restraint put upon it Captain  Johnson  's Vessel brought to  Malacca  by Mr  Wells  The Author's departure from  Malacca  and arrival at  Achin  IT was the beginning of  Febuary    when we left his Country We went over the Bar Ships in Company the  Rainbow  Captain  Pool  Commander bound for  London  and Captain  Lacy  in the  Saphire  bound for  Fort St George  and I was in Captain  Weldon  's Ship the  Curtane  bound thither also We kept Company some time after our departure from  Tonquin  and having an Easterly Wind we kept more to the middle of the Bay of  Tonquin  or towards the Eastern side than when we entred by which means we had the opportunity of sounding as well in the middle of the Bay  now as we had on the West side of it at our coming into the Bay  Coming out of the Bay of  Tonquin  we stood away Southward having the Sholes of  Pracel  on our Larboard and the Coasts of  Cochinchina Champa  and  Cambodia  on our Starboard I have just mentioned these Kingdoms in my former Volume and here I have but little to say of them having only sail'd by them But not altogether to fail the Readers expectation I shall give a brief account of one or two particulars relating to  Cambodia  for as to  Champa  I have nothing material to speak and  Cochinchina  I have already spoken of in this Volume as I went to  Tonquin  The Kingdom of  Cambodia  seems to be much such a kind of Country within Land as the lower parts of  Tonquin  low Land very woody and little inhabited lying on each side a great River that comes from the North a great way and falls into the Sea over against  Pulo Condore  I know not the particular product of  Cambodia  but in the Vessels mentioned in my former Vol p as taken at  Pulo Uby  and which came thither from  Cambodia  there were besides Rice Dragons Blood Lack in great Jars but it looked blackish and thick and the yellow purging Gum which we from thence call  Cambodia  in great Cakes but I know not whence they get it This River and Kingdom if it be one is but little known to our Nation yet some  English  men have been there particularly Captain  Williams  and Captain  Howel  the last of whom I came acquainted with some time after this at  Fort St George  and I had of him the following account the particulars of which I have also had confirmed by the Seamen who where with them  These two Captains with many more  English  men had been for some time in the service of the King of  Siam  and each of them commanded a  stout Frigat of his mann'd chiefly with  English  and some  Portuguese  born at  Siam  These the King of  Siam  sent against some Pyrates who made spoyl of his Subjects trading in these Seas and nested themselves in an Island up the River of  Cambodia  Captain  Howel  told me that they found this River very large especially at its mouth that 'tis deep and navigable for very great Vessels or Leagues up and that its depth and wideness extended much further up for ought we know but so far they went up at this time with their Ships The Course of the River is generally from North to South and they found the Land low on each side with many large Creeks and Branches and in some places considerable Islands They bended their Course up that branch which seemed most considerable having the Tide of flood with them and the River commonly so wide as to give them room to turn or make Angles where the bending of the River was such as to receive a contrary East or SouthEast SeaWind These Reaches or Bendings of the River East and West were very rare at least so as to make their Course be against the Seawind which commonly blew in their Stern and so fresh that with it they could stem the Tide of Ebb But in the night when the Landwinds came they anchored and lay still till about or a Clock the next day at which time the Seabreezes usually sprang up again and enabled them to continue their Course till they came to the Island where the Pirates inhabited They presently began to fire at them and landing their Men routed them and burnt their Houses and Fortifications and taking many Prisoners returned again  These Piratical People were by Nation  Chinese  who when the  Tartars  conquer'd their Country fled from thence in their own Ships as chosing  rather to live any were free than to submit to the  Tartars  These it seems in their flight bent their Course towards this Country and finding the River of  Cambodia  open before them they made bold to enter and settle on the Island before mentioned There they built a Town and fenced it round about with a kind of Woodpile or Wall of great Timber Trees laid along of the thickness of or of these Trees and of about as many in heighth They were provided with all sorts of Planters Instruments and the Land hereabouts was excellent good as our  English  men told me so that 'tis like they might have lived here happily enough had their inclinations led them to a quiet Life but they brought Arms along with them and chose to use them rather than their instruments of Husbandry and they lived therefore mostly by rapin pillaging their Neighbours who were more addicted to traffick than fighting But the King of  Siam  's Subjects having been long harrassed by them at Sea he first sent some Forces by Land to drive them out of their Fort till not succeeding that way he entirely routed them by sending these Ships up the River The  English  Captains having thus effected their business returned out of the River with many Prisoners but the South West Monsoon being already set in they could not presently return to  Siam  and therefore went to  Macao  in  China  as well to wait for the N East Monsoon as to ingratiate themselves with the  Tartars  who they thought would be pleased with the Conquest which they had made over these  Chinese  Pyrates They were well entertained there by the  Tartarian  Governor and gave him their Prisoners and upon the shifting of the Monsoon they returned to  Siam  There they were received with great applause Nor was this the first successful expedition the  English  have  made in the K of  Siam  's service They once saved the Country by suppressing an insurrection made by the  Buggasses  The  Buggasses  are a sort of warlike Trading  Malayans  and mercenary Soldiers of  India  I know not well whence they come unless from  Macasser  in the Island  Celebes  Many of them had been entertained at  Siam  in the King's service but at last being disgusted at some ill usage they stood up in their own defence Some hundreds of them got together all well armed and these struck a dread into the hearts of the  Siamites  none of whom were able to stand before them till  Constant Falcon  the chief Minister commanded the  English  that were then in the King's service to march against them which they did with success tho' with some considerable loss For these services the King gave every year to each of them a great Silk Coat on which were just buttons Those of the chief Commanders were of Massy Gold and those of the inferior Officers were of Silver Plate This expedition against the  Chinese  P  rats was about the year the other broyl with the  Buggasses  was as I take it some time before  But to proceed with our Voyage we still kept our way Southward and in company together till we came about  Pulo Condore  but then Captain  Pool  parted from us standing more directly South for the Streights of  Sundy  and we steered more to the Westward to go thro' the Streights of  Malacca  thro' which we came before Captain  Brewster  and another of our Passengers began now to be in fear that the King of  Siam  would send Ships to lye at the mouth of the Streights of  Malacca  and intercept our passage because there was a War broke out between the  English EastIndia  Company and that Prince This seemed the more likely because the  French  at this time were imployed in that King's service by the means of a  French  Bishop  and other  Ecclesiasticks  who were striving to convert the King and People to Christianity thro' the Interest they had got in  Constant Falcon  Particularly they were affraid that the King of  Siam  would send the Ships before mentioned which Captain  Williams  and Capt  Howel  had commanded a little before to lye at the west end of the Streights mouth but probably manned with  French  Men and  French  Commanders to take us Now tho' this made but little impression on the Minds of our Commanders and Officers yet so it hapned that we had such thick dark weather when we came near the first Entrance of the Streights of  Malacca  which was that we came by and by which we meant to return that we thought it not safe to stand in at night and so lay by till morning The next day we saw a Jonk to the Southward and chased her and having spoke with her we made Sail and stood to the Westward to pass the Streights and making the Land we found we were to the Southward of the Streights first mouth and were gotten to the Souther most Entrance near the  Sumatra  shore but Captain  Lacy  who chose to go the old way made sail again to the Northward and so passed nearer the  Malacca  shore by the  Sincapore  the way we went before His was also the best and nearest way bBut Captain  Weldon  was willing to satisfie his curiosity and try a new Passage which we got thro' tho' we had but little depth of Water and this Entrance we past is called  Brewer's  Streights  Brewer's  Streights are sometimes passed by small Ships that sail from  Batavia  to  Malacca  because for them it is a nearer cut than to run so far as  Pulo Timaon  or the Streights of  Sincapore  In this Channel tho' in some places we found but or foot Water yet the bottom was soft Oaze and it lies so among Islands that there cannot go a  great Sea Captain  Weldon  had also a  Dutch  man aboard who had been this way and he professing to know the Channel incouraged our Captain to try it which we affected very well tho sometimes we had but little more water than we drew This made us make but an easy Sail and therefore we were or days before we arrived at  Malacca  but Captain  Lacy  was there or days before us  Here we first heard of the Death of  Constant Falcon  for whom Captain  Brewster  seemed to be much concerned There also we found besides several  Dutch  Sloops and our Companion Captain  Lacy  an  English  Vessel of or Tuns This Vessel was bought by one Captain  Johnson  who was sent by the Governor of  Bencouli  in a small Sloop to trade about the Island of  Sumatra  for Pepper but Captain  Johnson  being killed the Sloop was brought hither by one Mr  Wells  Being thus insensibly fallen into the mention of this Captain  Johnson  and intending to defer what little I have to say of  Malacca  till my coming thither again from  Achin  I shall bestow the rest of this Chapter in speaking of this Man's Tragedy and other occurrences relating to it which tho' of no great moment in themselves yet the Circumstances I shall have occasion to relate with them may be of use to the giving some small light into the state of the opposite Coast of  Sumatra  which was the S  ne of what I am going to speake of for tho' I shall have other occasion to speak of  Achin  and  Bencouli  yet I shall not have opportunity to say any thing of this part of that Island opposite to  Malacca  unless I do it here To go on therefore with his Story it seems Captain  Johnson  was part owner of the small  Bencouli  Sloop but thinking it too small for his turn he came to  Malacca  intending to buy a larger Sloop of the  Dutch  if he could light of a bargain He had  the best part of a thousand Dollars in  Spanish  Money aboard for which one may purchase a good Sloop here for the  Dutch  as I have before observ'd do often buy Proebottoms for a small matter of the  Malayans  especially of the People of  Jihore  and convert them into Sloops either for their own use or to sell Of these sort of Vessels therefore the  Dutch  men of  Malacca  have plenty and can afford good pennyworths and doubtless it was for this reason that Captain  Johnson  came hither to purchase a Sloop Here he met with a bargain not such a Proe bottom reformed but an old ill shaped thing yet such a one as pleased him The  Dutch  man who sold him this Vessel told him withal that the Government did not allow any such dealings with the  English  tho' they might wink at it and that therefore the safest way for them both to keep out of trouble would be to run over to the other side of the Streights to a Town called  Bencalis  on  Sumatra  where they might safely buy and sell or exchange without any notice taken of them Captain  Johnson  accepting the offer they sailed both together over to  Bencalis  a  Malayan  Town on that Coast commanding the Country about it There they came to an anchor and Captain  Johnson  paying the price agreed on for the Vessel he had her deliver'd to him The  Dutch  man immediately returned over to  Malacca  again leaving Captain  Johnson  with Vessels under his Command  viz  the Sloop that he brought from  Bencouli  and this newbought Vessel The  Bencouli  Sloop he sent into a large River hard by to Trade with the  Malayans  for Pepper under the Command of Mr  Wells  He was no Seaman but a pretty intelligent Person that came first out of  England  as a Soldier  o serve the  EastIndia  Company in the Island  Santa Helena  He liv'd some time very meanly in that  Island  but having an aspiring mind he left that poor but  healthy place to serve the Company at  Bencouli  which tho' 'tis accounted the most unhealthy place of any that we trade to yet the hopes of preferment engaged him to remove thither After some stay there he was sent with Captain  Johnson  to assist him in this Pepper Expedition more because he could use his Pen than his Hands in Sea service He had or raw Seamen with him to work the Sloop up into the River Captain  Johnson  stayed near  Bencalis  to fit his new Vessel for with other necessaries she wanted a new Boltsprit which he intended to cut here having a Carpenter with him for that purpose as also to repair and fit her to his mind He had also a few other raw Seamen but such as would have made better Landmen they having served the King of  Siam  as Soldiers and they were but lately come from thence with the  French  who were forced to leave that Country But here in the  Indies  our  English  are forced for want of better to make use of any Seamen such as they can get and indeed our Merchants are often put hard to it for want of Seamen Here are indeed  Lascars  or  Indian  Seamen enough to be hired and these they often make use of yet they always covet an  English  man or in a Vessel to assist them Not but that these  Lascars  are some of them indifferent good Sailors and might do well enough but an  English  man will be accounted more faithful to be employed on matters of moment beside the more free Conversation that may be expected from them during the term of the Voyage So that tho' oft times their  English  men are but ordinary Sailors yet they are promoted to some charge of which they could not be so capable any where but in the  EastIndies  These Seamen would be in a manner wholly useless in  Europe  where we meet with more frequent and hard storms but here they serve indifferent well  especially to go and come with the Monsoons but enough of that  Mr  Wells  being gone to purchase Pepper Capt  Johnson  went ashore about or Leagues from  Bencalis  Town with his Carpenter to cut a Boltsprit there being there plenty of Timber Trees fit for his purpose He soon chose one to his mind and cut it down He and his Carpenter wrought on it the first and second days without molestation The d day they were both set upon by a band of armed  Malayans  who killed them both In the evening the Sailors who were left aboard lookt out for their Commander to come off but night approaching without seeing or hearing from him This put them in some doubt of his safety for they were sensible enough that the  Malayans  that inhabited thereabouts were very treacherous as indeed all of them are especially those who have but little Commerce with Strangers and therefore all people ought to be very careful in dealing with them so as to give them no advantage and then they may Trade safe enough  There were but Seamen aboard Captain  Johnson's  Sloop These being terrified by the absence of their Commander and suspecting the truth were now very apprehensive of their own safeties They charged their Guns and kept themselves on their guards expecting to be assaulted by the  Malayans  They had Blunderbusses and or Muskets each man took one in his Hand with a Caducebox at his Waste and looked out sharp for fear of any Enemy While they were thus on their guard the  Malayans  in or Canoas came very silently to attack the Sloop They were about or Men armed with Lances and Cresses The darkness of the night favoured their designs and they were even aboard before the Seamen perceived them Then these began to Fire and the  Enemy darted their Lances aboard and boarding the Vessel they entred her over the Prow The Seamen resolutely defended her and drove them overboard again Of the Seamen were desperately wounded in the first attack The  Malayans  took fresh Courage and entred again and the Seamen who were not wounded betook themselves to close quarters in the Steerage and there being Loopholes to fire out at they repulsed the  Malayans  again forcing them into their Canoas There bellies being now pretty full they returned ashore without hopes of conquering the Sloop The poor Seamen were still in fear and kept watch all night intending to sell their Lives as dear as they could if they had been attacked again For they might not neither did they expect quarter from these Salvage  Malayans  but they were no more assaulted These two that were wounded dyed in a short time  T  e next day the Seamen got up their Anchor and run as nigh the Town of  Bencalis  as they could it may be within half a mile There they Anchor'd again and made signs for the People to come aboard It was not long before the  Shabander  or chief Magistrate of the Town came off to him they told all their misfortunes and desired him to protect them because they were not of sufficient strength to hold out against another attack The  Shabander  seemed very sorry for what had hapned and told them withal that he could not help what was past for that the People that did it were wild unruly Men not subject to Government and that it was not in his power to suppress them but that as long as they lay there some of his men should lye aboard to secure the Ship and he in the mean time would send a Canoa to their consort Mr  Wells  to give him an account how things went Accordingly he left or of his own  Malayans  aboard the Bark and sent a Letter written by the Seamen to Mr  Wells  who was as I have said dealing with the Natives for Pepper in a River at some distance  It was or days before Mr  Wells  came to them He had not then received the Letter and therefore they suspected the  Shabander  of falshood tho' his men were yet very kind and serviceable to the Seamen Mr  Wells  had heard nothing of their disasters but returned for want of Trade at least such a full Trade as he expected For tho' here is Pepper growing yet not so much as might allure any one to seek after it for the  Dutch  are so near that none can come to Trade among them but by their permission And tho' the Natives themselves were never so willing to Trade with any Nation as indeed they are yet the Dutch could soon hinder it even by destroying them if in order to it they should set themselves to produce much Pepper Such small quantities as they do at present raise up or procure from other parts of the Island is lickt by the Dutch or by their friends of  Bencalis  for them for the Town of  Bencalis  being the principal of these parts and so nigh  Malacca  as only parted by the narrow Sea or Streights 'tis visited by the Dutch in their small Vessels and seems wholly to depend on a Trade with that Nation not daring to Trade with any besides and I judge it is by the friendship of the Town that the Dutch drive a small Trade for Pepper in these parts and by it also vend any of their own Commodities and these also trading with their Neighbours into the Country do bring their Cmmodities hither Where the Dutch come for them The People of  Bencalis  therefore tho' they are  Malayans  as the rest of the Country yet they are civil  nough engaged thereto by Trade for the more Trade the more civility and on the contrary  the less Trade the more barbarity and inhumanity For Trade has a strong influence upon all People who have found the sweet of it bringing with it so many of the Conveniencies of Life as it does And I believe that even the poor  Americans  who have not yet tasted the sweetness of it might be allured to it by an honest and just Commerce even such of them as do yet seem to covet no more than a bare subsistence of meat and drink and a clout to cover their nakedness That large Continent hath yet Millions of Inhabitants both on the  Mexican  and  Peruvian  parts who are still ignorant of Trade and they would be fond of it did they once experience it tho' at the present they live happy enough by enjoying such fruits of the Earth as nature hath bestowed on those places where their Lot is fallen and it may be they are happier now than they may hereafter be when more known to the  Avaritious World  For with Trade they will be in danger of meeting with oppression men not being content with a free Traffick and a just and reasonable gain especially in these remote Countries but they must have the Current run altogether in their own Channel tho' to the depriving the poor Natives they deal with of their natural Liberty as if all mankind were to be ruled by their Laws The Islands of  Sumatra  and  Java  can sufficiently witness this the Dutch having in a manner ingrost all the Trade of those and several of the Neighbouring Countries to themselves not that they are able to supply the Natives with a quarter of what they want but because they would have all the produce of them at their own disposal Yet even in this they are short and may be still more disappointed of the Pepper Trade if other People would seek for it For the greatest part of the Island of  Sumatra  propagates this Plant and the Natives would readily comply with any  who would come to Trade with them notwithstanding the great endeavours the  Dutch  make against it for this Island is so large populous and productive of Pepper that the  Dutch  are not able to draw all to themselves Indeed this place about  Bencalis  is in a manner at their devotion and for ought I know it was through a design of being revenged on the  Dutch  that Capt  Johnson  lost his life I find the  Malayans  in general are implacable Enemies to the  Dutch  and all seems to spring from an earnest desire they have of a free Trade which is restrained by them not only here but in the SpiceIslands and in all other places where they have any Power But 'tis freedom only must be the means to incourage any of these remote People to Trade especially such of them as are industrious and whose inclinations are bent this way as most of the  Malayans  are and the major part of the People of the  EastIndies  even from the Cape of  Good Hope  Eastward to  Japan  both Continent and Islands For tho' in many places they are limited by the  Dutch English Danes  c and restrain'd from a free Trade with other Nations yet have they continually shewn what an uneasiness that is to them And how dear has this Restraint cost the  Dutch  when yet neither can they with all their Forts and GuardShips secure the Trade wholly to themselves any more than the  Barlaventa  Fleet can secure the Trade of the  WestIndies  to the  Spaniards  but enough of this matter  You have heard before that Mr  Wells  came with his Sloop to  Bencalis  to the great joy of the two Men that were yet alive in Captain  Johnson  's Vessel These two Seamen were so just that they put all Captain  Johnson  's Papers and Money into one Chest then lockt it and put the Key of it into another Chest and locking that flung the Key of it into the Sea and when Mr  Wells  came aboard they offered him the Command of both Vessels He seemingly refused it saying that he was no Seamen and could not manage either of them yet by much importunity he accepted the Command of them or at least undertook the account of what was in the Sloop engaging to give a faithful account of it to Governor  Bloom  They were all now so weakned that they were but just enough to sail one of the Vessels Therefore they sent to the  Shabander  of  Bancalis  to desire some of his Men to help sail the Sloops over to  Malacca  but he refused it Then they offered to sell one of them for a small matter but neither would he buy Then they offered to give him the smallest To that he answered that he did not dare to accept of her for fear of the  Dutch  Then Mr  Wells  and his Crew concluded to take the Pepper and all the Stores out of the small Vessel and burn her and go away with the other to  Malacca  This they put in execution and presently went away and opening Captain  Johnson  's Chest they found or Dollars in Money This with all his Writings and what else they found of value Mr  Wells  took in his possession In a very short time they got over to  Malacca  There they stayed expecting the coming of some  English  Ship to get a Pilot to Navigate the Sloop for neither of them would undertake to Navigate her farther Captain  Lacy  coming hither first he spared Mr  Wells  his chief Mate to Navigate her to  Achin  When we came hither they were ready to sail and went away or days before us  To return therefore to our own Voyage Captain  Weldon  having finished his business at  Malacca  we sailed again steering towards  Achin  where he designed to touch in his way to  Fort St George  We overtook Mr  Wells  about Leagues short of  A  hi  against the River  Passange Jonca  and shortly after  we both arrived at  Achin  and anchored in the Road about the beginning of  March  Here I took my leave of Captain  Weldon  and of my friend Mr  Hall  who went with us to  Tonquin  and I went ashore being very weak with my Flux as I had been all the Voyage Captain  Weldon  offered me any kindness that lay in his Power at  Fort St George  if I would go with him thither but I chose rather to stay here having some small acquaintance than to go in that weak condition to a place where I was wholly unknown But Mr  Hall  went with Captain  Weldon  to  Fort St George  and from thence in a short time returned to  England  in the  Williamson  of  London  CHAP VII  The Country of  Achin  described its Situation and

Achin  BEing now arrived at  Achin  again I think it not amiss to give the Reader some short account of what observation I made of that City and Country  This Kingdom is the largest and best Peopled of many small ones that are up and down the Isle of  Sumatra  and it makes the North West end of that Island It reaches Eastward from that N W point of the Island a great way along the Shore towards the Streights of  Malacca  for about or Leagues But from  Diamond  point which is about Lagues from  Achin  towads the Borders of the Kingdom the Inhabitants tho' belonging to  Achin  are in less subjection to it Of these I can say but little neither do I know the Bounds of this Kingdom either within Land or along the West Coast That West side of the Kingdom is high and mountainous as is generally the rest of the West Coast of the whole Island The point also of  Achin  or extremity of the Island is High Land but  Achin  it self and the Country to the Eastward is lower not altogether destitute of small Hills and every where of a moderate heighth and a Champion Country naturally very fit for cultivation  There is one Hill more remarkable than ordinary especially to Seamen The  English  call it the  Golden Mount  but whether this name is given it by the Natives or only by the  English  I know not 'Tis near the N W end of the Island and  Achin  stands but or mile from the bottom of it 'Tis very large at the foot and runs up smaller towards the head which is raised so high as to be seen at Sea or Leagues This was the first Land that we saw coming in our Proe from the  Nicobar Islands  mentioned in my former Voyage The rest of the Land tho' of a good heighth was then undiscerned by us so that this Mountain appeared like an Island in the Sea which was the reason why our  Achin Malayans  took it for  Pulo Way  But that Island tho' pretty high Champion Land was invisible when this  Golden Mount  appeared so plain tho' as far distant as that Island  Besides what belong to  Achin  upon the Continent there are also several Islands under its Jurisdiction most of them uninhabited and these make the Road of  Achin  Among them is this  Pulo Way  which is the Eastermost of a Range of Islands that lye off the N W end of  Sumatra  It is also the largest of them and it is inhabited by Malefactors who are banisht thither from  Achin  This with the other Islands of this Range lye in a semicircular form of about Leagues diameter  Pulo Gomez  is another large Island about mile West from  Pulo Way  and about Leagues from the N W point of  Sumatra  Between  Pulo Gomez  and the Main are or other small Islands yet with Channels of a sufficient breadth between them for Ships to pass thro' and they have very deep Water All Ships bound from  Achin  to the Westward or coming from thence to  Achin  go in and out thro' one or other of these Channels and because shipping comes hither from the Coast of  Surrat  one of these Channels which is deeper than the rest is called the  Surrat  Channel Between  Pulo Gomez  and  Pulo Way  in the bending of the Circle there are other small Islands the chief of which is called  Pulo Rondo  This is a small round high Island not above or mile in circumference It lyes almost in the extremity of the bending on the N E part of the Circle but nearer  Pulo Way  than  Pulo Gomez  There are large deep Channels on either side but the most frequented is the Channel on the West side Which is called the  Bengal  Channel because it looks towards that Bay and Ships coming from thence from the Coast of  Coromandel  pass in and out this way Between  Pulo Way  and the main of  Sumatra  is another Channel of or Leagues wide which is the Channel for Ships that go from  Achin  to the Streights of  Malacca  or any Country to the East of those Streights and  vice versa  There is good riding  in all this Semicircular Bay between the Islands and  Sumatra  but the Road for all Ships that come to  Achin  is near the  Sumatra  Shore within all the Islands There they anchor at what distances they please according to the Monsoons or Seasons of the Year There is a small Navigable River comes out into the Sea by which Ships transport their Commodities in smaller Vessels up to the City The Mouth of this River is or Leagues from  Pulo Rondo  and or from  Pulo Way  and near as many from  Pulo Gomez  The Islands are pretty high Champion Land the Mold black or yellow the Soil deep and fat producing large tall Trees fit for any uses There are Brooks of Water on the great Islands of  Way  and  Gomez  and several sorts of wild Animals especially wild Hogs in abundance  The Mold of this Continent is different according to the natural position of it The Mountains are Rocky especially those towards the West Coast yet most that I have seen seems to have a superficial covering of Earth naturally producing Shrubs small Trees or pretty good Grass The small Hills are most of them cloathed with Woods the Trees whereof seem by their growth to spring from a fruitful Soil the Champion Land such as I have seen is some black some grey some reddish and all of a deep Mold But to be very particular in these things especially in all my Travels is more than I can pretend to tho' it may be I took as much notice of the difference of Soil as I met with it as most Travellers have done having been bred in my Youth in  Somersetshire  at a place called  East Cocker  near  Yeovil  or  Evil  in which Parish there is a great Variety of Soil as I have ordinarily met with any where  viz  black red yellow sandy stony clay morass or swampy c I had the more reason to take notice of this because this Village  in great measure is Let out in small Leases for Lives of or pound  per An  under Coll  Helliar  the Lord of the Mannor and most it not all these Tenants had their own Land scattering in small pieces up and down several sorts of Land in the Parish so that every one had some piece of every sort of Land his black Ground his Sandy Clay c some of or Shillings an Acre for some uses and others not worth Groats an Acre My Mother being possest of one of these Leases and having of all these sorts of Land I came acquainted with them all and knew what each sort would produce  viz  Wheat Barley Maslin Rice Beans Peas Oats Fetches Flax or Hemp in all which I had a more than usual Knowledge for one so young taking a particular delight in observing it but enough of this matter  The Kingdom of  Achin  has in general a deep Mold It is very well water'd with Brooks and small Rivers but none navigable for Ships of burthen This of  Achin  admits not of any but small Vessels The Land is some part very Woody in other places Savannah the Trees are of divers sorts most unknown to me by name The Cotton and Cabbagetrees grow here but not in such plenty as in some part of  America  These Trees commonly grow here as indeed usually whereever they grow in a Champion dry Ground such at least as is not drowned or morassy for here is some such Land as that by the Rivers and there grow Mangrove Trees and other Trees of that kind Neither is this Kingdom destitute of Timbertrees sit for building  The Fruits of this Country are Plantains Bonanoes Guava's Oranges Limes Jacks Durians Coconuts Pumplenoses Pomgranates Mangoes Magastans Citrons Watermelons Muskmelons  Pine apples c Of all these sorts of Fruits I think the Mangastan is without compare the most delicate This Fruit is in shape much like the Pomgranate but a great deal less The outside rind or shell is a little thicker than that of the Pomgranate but softer yet more brittle and is of a dark red The inside of the shell is of a deep crimson colour Within this shell the Fruit appears in or Cloves about the bigness of the top of a man's thumb These will easily seperate each from the other they are as white as Milk very soft and juicy inclosing a small black Stone or Kernel The outside rind is said to be binding and therefore many when they eat the Fruit which is very delicious do save the rind or shell drying it and preserving it to give to such as have Fluxes In a small Book entituled  A new Voyage to the EastIndies  there is mention made of Mangastans among the Fruits of  Java  but the Author is mistaken in that he compares it to a Sloe in shape and taste Yet I remember there is such a sort of Fruit at  Achin  and believe by the description he gives of it it may probably be the same that he calls the Mangastan tho' nothing like the true Mangastan  The Pumplenose is a large Fruit like a Citron with a very thick tender uneven rind The inside is full of Fruit It grows all in cloves as big as a small Barlycorn and these are all full of juice as an Orange or a Lemon tho' not growing in such partitions 'Tis of a pleasant taste and tho' there are of them in other parts of the  EastIndies  yet these at  Achin  are accounted the best They are ripe commonly about  Christmas  and they are so much esteemed that English men carry them from hence to  Fort St George  and make Presents of them to their Friends there The other Fruits mentioned here are most of them described by me in my first Volume  The eatable Roots of this Country are Yams and Potatoes c but their chiefest bread kind is Rice The Natives have lately planted some quanities of this Grain and might produce much more were they so disposed the Land being so fruitful They have here a sort of Herb or Plant called  Ganga  or  Bang  I never saw any but once and that was at some distance from me It appeared to me like Hemp and I thought it had been Hemp till I was told to the contrary It is reported of this Plant that if it is infused in any Liquor it will stupify the brains of any person that drinks thereof but it operates diversly according to the constitution of the person Some it makes sleepy some merry putting them into a Laughing fit and others it makes mad but after or hours they come to themselves again I never saw the effects of it on any person but have heard much discourse of it What other use this Plant may serve for I know not but I know it is much esteemed here and in other places too whither it is transported  This Country abounds also with Medicinal Drugs and Herbs and with variety of Herbs for the Pot The chief of their Drugs is Camphire of which there are quanities found on this Island but most of it either on the borders of this Kingdom to the Southward or more remote still without the precincts of it This that is found on the Island  Sumatra  is commonly sent to  Japan  to be refined and then brought from thence pure and transported whither the Merchants please afterterwards I know that here are several sorts of Medicinal Herbs made use of by the Natives who go often a simpling seeming to understand their Virtues much and making great use of them but this being wholly out of my Sphere I can give no account of them and tho' here are plenty of PotHerbs  yet I know the names of none but Onions of which they have great abundance and of a very good sort but small  There are many other very profitable Commodities on this Island but some of them are more peculiar to other parts of it than  Achin  especially Pepper All the Island abounds with that Spice except only this North West end at least so much of it as is comprehended within the Kingdom of  Achin  Whether this defect is through the negligence or laziness of these People I know not  Gold also is found by report in many parts of this Island but the Kingdom of  Achin  is at present most plentifully stored with it Neither does any place in the  EastIndies  that I know of yield such quantities of it as this Kingdom I have never been at  Japan  and therefore can make no estimate of the great Riches of that Kingdom but here I am certain there is abundance of it  The Land Animals of this Country are Deer Hogs Elephants Goats Bullocks Buffaloes Horses Porcupines Monkeys Squirrils Guanoes Lizards Snakes c Here are also abundance of Ants of several sorts and Woodlice called by the  English  in the  EastIndies  White Ants The Elephants that I saw here were all tame yet 'tis reported there are some wild but I judge not many if any at all In some places there are plenty of Hogs they are all wild and commonly very poor At some times of the Year when the wild Fruits fall from the Trees they are indifferent fat or at least fleshy and then they are sweet and good they are very numerous and whether for that reason or scarcity of Food it is very rare to find them fat The Goats are not very many neither are there many Bullocks but the Savannahs swarm with Buffaloes belonging to some or other of the Inhabitants  who milk them and eat them but don't work them so far as I saw The Horses of this Country are but small yet sprightly and sometimes they are transported hence to the Coast of  Coromandel  The Porcupines and Squirrels are accounted good food by the  English  but how they are esteemed by the Natives I know not  The Fowls of this Country are Dunghil Fowls and Ducks but I know of no other tame Fowls they have In the Woods there are many sorts of wild Fowls  viz  Maccaws Parrots Parakites Pigeons and Doves of or sorts There are plenty of other small Birds but I can say nothing of them  The Rivers of this Country afford plenty of Fish The Sea also supplies divers sorts of very good Fish  viz  Snooks Mullets Mudfish Eels Stingrays which I shall describe in the Bay of  Campeachy  Tenpounders Old Wives Cavallies Crawfish Shrimps c  The Natives of this Country are  Malayans  They are much the same People with those of  Queda Jihore  and other places on the Continent of  Malacca  speaking the same  Malayan  Language with very little difference and they are of the same  Mahometan  Religion and alike in their haughty humour and manner of living so that they seem to have been originally the same People They are People of a middle stature straight and well shaped and of a dark Indian copper colour Their Hair is black and lank their Faces generally pretty long yet graceful enough They have black Eyes middling Noses thin Lips and black Teeth by the frequent use of Betle They are very lazy and care not to work or take pains The poorer sort are addicted to theft and are often punished severely for it They are otherwise good natured in general and kindenough to strangers  The better sort of them wear Caps fitted to their Heads of red or other coloured Woollen Cloath like the Crown of a Hat without any Brims for none of the  Eastern  People use the Complement of uncovering their Heads when they meet as we do But the general wear for all sorts of People is a small Turban such as the  Mindanaians  wear described in the th Chap of my former Volume page They have small Breeches and the better sort will have a piece of Silk thrown losely over their Shoulders but the poor go naked from the Waste upwards Neither have they the use of Stockings and Shoes but a sort of Sandals are worn by the better sort  Their Houses are built on Posts as those of  Mindanao  and they live much after the same fashion but by reason of their Gold Mines and the frequent resort of Strangers they are richer and live in greater plenty Their common food is Rice and the better sort have Fowls and Fish with which the Markets are plentifully stored and sometimes Buffaloes flesh all which is drest very favourly with Pepper and Garlick and tinctured yellow with Turmerick to make it pleasant to the Eye as the  EastIndians  generally love to have their Food look yellow neither do they want good  Achars  or Sauces to give it a relish  The City of  Achin  is the chief in all this Kingdom It is seated on the Banks of a River near the N W end of the Island and about miles from the Sea This Town consists of or Houses and in it there are always a great many Merchantstrangers  viz English Dutch Danes Portuguese Chinese Guzarats  c The Houses of this City are generally larger than those I saw at  Mindanao  and better furnished with Houshold Goods The City has no Walls nor so much as a Ditch about it It has a great number of Mosques generally square  built and covered with Pantile but neither high nor large Every morning a Man made a great Noise from thence but I saw no Turrets or Steeples for them to climb up into for that purpose as they have generally in  Turky  The Queen has a large Palace here built handsomely with Stone but I could not get into the inside of it 'Tis said there are some great Guns about it of which are of Brass and are said to have been sent hither as a Present by our K  James  the first  The chief Trades at  Achin  are Carpenters Blacksmiths Goldsmiths Fishermen and Moneychangers but the Countrypeople live either on breeding Heads of Cattle but most for their own use or Fowls especially they who live near the City which they send weekly thither to sell others plant Roots Fruits c and of late they have sown pretty large Fields of Rice This thrives here well enough but they are so proud that it is against their Stomach to work neither do they themselves much trouble their heads about it but leave it to be managed by their Slaves and they were the Slaves brought lately by the  English  and  Danes  from the Coast of  Coromandel  in the time of a Famin there I spoke of before who first brought this sort of Husbandry into such request among the  Achinese  Yet neither does the Rice they have this way supply one quarter of their occasions but they have it brought to them from their Neigbouring Countries  The Fishermen are the richest working People I mean such of them as can purchase a Net for thereby they get great profit and this sort of imployment is managed also by their Slaves In fair weather you shall have or great Boats each with a Sain or haling Net and when they see a Shoal of Fish they strive to encompass them with these Nets and all the Boats that are near assist each other to drag them ashore Sometimes they  draw ashore this way or large Fish as big as a Man's Leg and as long and then they rejoyce mightly and scamper about making a great shout The Fish is presently sent to the Market in one of their Boats the rest looking out again for more Those who Fish with Hook and Line go out in small Proes with about or Slaves in each Proe These also get good Fish of other sorts which they carry home to their Masters  The Carpenters use such Hatchets as they have at  Mindanao  They build good Houses after their fashion and they are also ingenious enough in building Proes making very pretty ones especially of that sort which are  FlyingProes  which are built long deep narrow and sharp with both sides alike and Outlagers on each side the Head and Stern like other Boats They carry a great Sail and when the wind blows hard they send a Man or two to sit at the extremity of the Windward Outlager to poise the Vessel They build also some Vessels of or Tuns burthen to Trade from one place to another but I think their greatest ingenuity is in building their  FlyingProes  which are made very smooth kept neat and clean and will sail very well for which reason they had that name given them by the  English  There are but few Blacksmiths in this Town neither are they very skilful at their Trade The Goldsmiths are commmonly strangers yet some of the  Achinese  themselves know how to work Metals tho' not very well The Moneychangers are here as at  Tonquin  most Women These sit in the Markets and at Corners of the Streets with leaden Money called  Cash  which is a name that is generally given to small Money in all these Countries but the  Cash  here is neither of the same Metal nor value with that at  Tonquin  for that is Copper and this is Lead or Block Tin such as will bend about  the Finger They have but two sorts of Coin of their own the least sort is this Leaden Money call'd  Cash  and 'tis the same with what they called  Petties  at  Bantam  Of these make a  Mess  which is their other sort of Coin and is a small thin piece of Gold stampt with  Malayan  Letters on each side It is in value pence  English    Mess  make a  Tale  which here is  s English    Tale  make a  Bancal  a weight so called and  Bancal  make a  Catty  another weight But the Gold Coin seldom holds weight for you shall sometimes have  Tale  and  Mess  over go to make a  Pecul  and tho'  Cash  is the value of a  Mess  yet these rise and fall at the discretion of the Moneychangers for sometimes you shall have  Cash  for a  Mess  but they are kept usually between these two numbers seldom less than and never more than But to proceed with these Weights which they use either for Money or Goods  Catty  make a  Pecul  which is  l English  weight Three hundred  Catty  is a  Bahar  which is  l English  weight but in some places as at  Bencouli  a  Bahar  is near  English  weight  Spanish  pieces of Eight go here also and they are valued according to the plenty or scarcity of them Sometimes a Piece of Eight goes but for  Mess  sometimes for and a half sometimes  Mess  They Coin but a small quantity of their Gold so much as may serve for their ordinary occasions in their Traffick one with another But as the Merchant when he receives large Summs always takes it by weight so they usually pay him unwrought Gold and quantity for quantity the Merchants chuse rather to receive this than the coined Gold and before their leaving the Country will change their  Messes  for uncoined Gold perhaps because of some deceits used by the Natives in their Coining  This Gold they have from some Mountain a pretty was within Land from  Achin  but within their Dominions and rather near to the West Coast than the Streights of  Malacca  I take  Golden Mount  which I spoke of before to lye at no great distance from that of the Mines for there is very high Land all thereabouts To go thither they set out Eastward towards  Passange Jonca  and thence strike up into the heart of the Country I made some inquiry concerning their getting Gold and was told that none but  Mahometans  were permitted to go to the Mines That it was both troublesom and dangerous to pass the Mountains before they came thither there being but one way and that over such steep Mountains that in some places they were forced to make use of Ropes to climb up and down the Hills That at the foot of these Precipices there was a Guard of Soldiers to see that no uncircumcised person should pursue that design and also to receive custom of those that past either forward or backward That at the Mines it was so sickly that not the half of those that went thither did ever return again tho' they went thither only to Traffick with the Miners who live there being seasoned that these who go thither from the City stayed not usually above Months at the Mines and were back again in about Months from their going out That some there made it their constant imployment to visit the Miners once every Year for after they are once seasoned and have found the profit of that Trade no thoughts of danger can deter them from it for I was credibly told that these made  per cent  of whatever they carryed with them to sell to the Miners but they could not carry much by reason of the badness of the ways The rich men never go thither themselves but send their Slaves and if out of returns they think they make a very profitable journey  for their Master for these are able to bring home as much Gold as the Goods which all carried out could purchase The Goods that they carry thither are some sort of cloathing and liquor They carry their Goods from the City by Sea part of the way Then they land somewhere about  Passange Jonca  and get Horses to carry their Cargo to the foot of the Mountains There they draw it up with Ropes and if they have much goods one stays there with them while the rest march to the Mines with their load and return again for the rest I had this relation from Captain  Tiler  who lived at  Achin  and spoke the Language of the Country very well There was an  English  Renegado that used that trade but was always at the Mines when I was here At his Return to  Achin  he constantly frequented an  English  Punchhouse spending his Gold very freely as I was told by the Master of the house I was told also by all that I discoursed with about the Gold that here they dig it out of the Ground and that sometimes they find pretty large lumps  It is the product of these Mines that draws so many Merchants hither for the Road is seldom without or sail of Ships of several Nations These bring all sort of vendible Commodities as Silks Chints Muzlins Callicoes Rice c and as to this last a man would admire to see what great quanities of Rice are brought hither by the  English Dutch Danes  and  Chinese  when any arrives the Commanders hire each a House to put their goods in The Silks Muzlins Callicoes Opium and such like rich Goods they sell to the  Guzurats  who are the chief men that keep Shops here but the Rice which is the bulk of the Cargo they usually retail I have heard a Merchant say he has received and  l  a day for Rice when it has been scarce but when there are many sellers  then or  s  worth in a day is a good sale for then a  Mess  will buy or Bamboes of it whereas when Rice is scarce you will not have above or Bamboes for a  Mess  A Bamboe is a small seal'd measure containing to the best of my remembrance not much above half a Gallon Thus it rises and falls as Ships come hither Those who sell Rice keep one constantly attending to measure it out and the very Grandees themselves never keep a stock before hand but depend on the Market and buy just when they have occasion They send their Slaves for what they want and the poorer sort who have not a Slave of their own will yet hire one to carry a  Mess  worth of Rice for them tho' not one hundred paces from their own homes scorning to do it themselves Besides one to measure the Rice the Merchants hire a man to take the Money for here is some false Money as Silver and Copper  Mess  gilt over Besides here are some true  Mess  much worn and therefore not worth near their value in tale The Merchants may also have occasion to receive or  l  at a time for other Commodities and this too besides those little summs for Rice he must receive by his Broker if he will not be cheated for 'tis work enough to examin every piece and in receiving the value of  l  in  Mess  they will ordinarily be forc'd to return half or more to be chang'd for the Natives are for putting off bad Money if possibly they can But if the Broker takes any bad Money 'tis to his own loss These sort of Brokers are commonly  Guzurats  and 'tis very necessary for a Merchant that comes hither especially if he is a Stranger to have one of them for fear of taking bad or light Money  The  English  Merchants are very welcome here and I have heard that they do not pay so much Custom as other Nations The  Dutch  Freemen  may trade hither but the Company's Servants are deny'd that privilege But of all the Merchants that trade to this City the  Chinese  are the most remarkable There are some of them live here all the Year long but others only make annual Voyages hither from  China  These latter come hither some time in  June  about or sail and bring abundance of Rice and several other Commodities They take up Houses all by one another at the end of the Town next the Sea and that end of the City is call'd the  China Camp  because there they always quarter and bring their goods ashore thither to sell In this Fleet come several Mechanicks  viz  Carpenters Joyners Painters c These set themselves immediately to work making of Chests Drawers Cabinets and all sorts of  Chinese  Toys which are no sooner finish'd in their Workinghouses but they are presently set up in Shops and at the Doors to sale So that for two Months or ten Weeks this Place is like a Fair full of Shops stuft with all sort of vendible commodities and People resorting hither to buy and as their goods sell off so they contract themselves into less compass and make use of fewer Houses But as their business decreases their Gaming among themselves increases for a  Chinese  if he is not at work had as lieve be without Victuals as without Gaming and they are very dexterous at it If before their goods are all sold they can light of Chapmen to buy their Ships they will gladly sell them also at least some of them if any Merchant will buy for a  Chinese  is for selling every thing and they who are so happy as to get Chapmen for their own Ships will return as passengers with their Neighbours leaving their Camp as 'tis call'd poor and naked like other parts of the City till the next Year They commonly go away about the latter end of  September  and never fail to return again at the Season  and while they are here they are so much followed that there is but little business stirring for the Merchants of any other Nations all the discourse then being of going down to the  China Camp  Even the  Europeans  go thither for their diversion the  English Dutch  and  Danes  will go to drink their  Hocciu  at some  China  Merchants House who sells it for they have no tippling Houses The  European  Seamen return thence into the City drunk enough but the  Chinese  are very sober themselves  The  Achinese  seem not to be extraordinary good at Accounts as the  Banians  or  Guzurats  are They instruct their youth in the knowledge of Letters  Malayan  principally and I suppose in somewhat of  Arabick  being all  Mahometans  They are here as at  Mindanao  very superstitious in washing and cleansing themselves from defilements and for that Reason they delight to live near the Rivers or Streams of Water The River of  Achin  near the City is always full of People of both Sexes and all Ages Some come on purpose to wash themselves for the Pleasure of being in the Water which they so much delight in that they can scarce leave the River without going first into it if they have any business brings them near Even the sick are brought to the River to wash I know not whether it is accounted good to wash in all distempers but I am certain from my own Experience it is good for those that have Flux especially Mornings and Evenings for which reason you shall then see the Rivers fullest and more especially in the Morning But the most do it upon a Religious account for therein consists the chief part of their Religion  There are but few of them resort daily to their  Mosques  yet they are all stiff in their Religion and so zealous for it that they greatly rejoyce in making a Proyselyte I was told that while I was  at  Tonquin  a  Chinese  inhabiting here turn'd from his  Paganism  to  Mahometanism  and being circumcised he was thereupon carry'd in great state through the City on an Elephant with one crying before him that he was turn'd  Believer  This man was call'd the Captain of the  China Camp  for as I was informed he was placed there by his Countrymen as the chief Factor or Agent to negotiate their affairs with the People of the Country Whether he had dealt falsly or was only envied by others I know not but his Countrymen had so entangled him in Law that he had been ruin'd if he had not made use of this way to disingage himself and then his Religion protected him and they could not meddle with him On what score the two  English  Runagadoes turn'd here I know not  The Laws of this Country are very strict and offenders are punished with great severity Neither are there any delays of Justice here for as soon as the Offender is taken he is immediately brought before the Magistrate who presently hears the matter and according as he finds it so he either acquits or orders punishment to be inslicted on the Party immediately Small offenders are only whipt on the back which sort of punishment they call  Chaubuck  A Thief for his first offence has his right hand chopt off at the Wrist for the second offence off goes the other and sometimes instead of one of their hands one or both their feet are cut off and sometimes tho' very rarely both hands and feet If after the loss of one or both hands or feet they still prove incorrigible for they are many of them such very Rogues and so arch that they will steal with their Toes then they are banish'd to  Pulo Way  during their Lives and if they get thence to the City as sometimes they do they are commonly sent back again tho' sometimes they get a License to stay  On  Pulo Way  there are none but this sort of Cattle and tho' they all of them want one or both hands yet they so order matters that they can row very well and do many things to admiration whereby they are able to get a livelihood for if they have no hands they will get somebody or other to fasten Ropes or Withes about their Oars so as to leave Loops wherein they may put the stamps of their Arms and therewith they will pull an Oar lustily They that have one hand can do well enough and of these you shall see a great many even in the City This sort of punishment is inflicted for greater Robberies but for small pilfering the first time Thieves are only whipt but after this a Petty Larceny is looked on as a great crime Neither is this sort of punishment peculiar to the  Achinese  Government but probably used by the other Princes of this Island and on the Island  J  a  also especially at  Bantam  They formerly then the King of  Bantam  was in his prosperity  priv'd men of the right hand for Theft and may full for ought I know I knew a  Dutch  man so serv'd he was a Seaman belonging to one of the King of  Bantam  's Ships Being thus punished he was dismist from his service and when I was this time at  Achin  he lived there Here at  Achin  when a member is thus cut off they have a broad piece of Leather or Bladder ready to clap on the Wound This is presently applyed and bound on so fast that the Blood cannot issue forth By this means the great Flux of Blood is stop which would else ensue and I never heard of any one who died of  t How long this Leather is kept on the Wound  know not but it is so long till the blood is perfectly stanched and when it is taken off the  lods of Blood which were prest in the Wound by he Leather peel all off with it leaving the  ound clean Then I judge they use cleansing  or healing Plaisters as they see convenient and cur  the Wound with a great deal of ease  I never heard of any that suffer'd Death for Theft Criminals who deserve death are executed divers ways according to the nature of the offence or the quality of the offender One way is by Impaling on a sharp Stake which passeth up right from the Fundament through the Bowels and comes out at the Neck The Stake is about the bigness of a mans Thigh placed upright one end in the ground very sirm the upper sharp end is about or foot high I saw one man spitted in this manner and there he remain'd or days but I could not learn his offence  Noblemen have a more honourable death they are allowed to fight for their lives but the numbers of those with whom they are to engage soon put a period to the Combat by the death of the Malefactor The manner of it is thus the person condemned is brought bound to the place of excution This is a large plain Field spacious enough to contain thousands of People Thither the  Achinese  armed as they usually go with their Cresset but then more especially resort in Troops as well to be spectators as actors in the Tragedy These make a very large Ring and in the midst of the multitude the Criminal is placed and by him such Arms as are allowed on such occasions which are a Sword a Cresset and a Lance When the time is come to act he is unbound and left at his liberty to take up his fighting Weapons The spectators being all ready with each man his Arms in his hand stand still in their places till the Malefactor advances He commonly sets out with a shriek and daringly faces the multitude but he is soon brought to the ground first by Lances thrown at him and afterwards by their Swords and Cressets One was thus executed while  I was there I had not the fortune to hear of it till it was ended but had this relation the same evening it was done from Mr  Dennis Driscal  who was then one of the Spectators  This Country is governed by a Queen under whom there are  Oronkeys  or great Lords These act in their several precincts with great Power and Authority Under these there are other inferior Officers to keep the Peace in the several parts of the Queens Dominions The present  Shabander  of  Achin  is one of the  Oronkeys  He is a Man of greater knowledge than any of the rest and supposed to be very rich I have heard say he had not less than Slaves some of whom were topping Merchants and had many Slaves under them And even these tho' they are Slaves to Slaves yet have their Slaves also neither can a stranger easily know who is a Slave and who not among them for they are all in a manner Slaves to one another and all in general to the Queen and  Oronkeys  for their Government is very Arbitrary Yet there is nothing of rigour used by the Master to his Slave except it be the very meanest such as do all sorts of servile work but those who can turn their hands to any thing besides Drudgery live well enough by their industry Nay they are encouraged by their Masters who often lend them Money to begin some trade or business withal Whereby the Servant lives easie and with great content follows what his Inclination or Capacity fits him for and the Master also who has a share in the gains reaps the more profit yet without trouble When one of these Slaves dies his Master is Heir to what he leaves and his Children if he has any become his Slaves also unless the Father out of his own clear gains has in his life time had wherewithal to purchase their Freedom The Markets are kept by these People and you scarce  trade with any other The Moneychangers also are Slaves and in general all the Women that you see in the streets not one of them being free So are the Fishermen and others who fetch Firewood in Canoas from  Pulo Gomez  for thence those of this City fetch most of their Wood tho' there is scarce any thing to be seen but Woods about the City Yet tho' all these are Slaves they have habitations or houses to themselves in several parts of the City far from their Masters Houses as if they were free People But to return to the  Shabander  I was speaking of all Merchant Strangers at their first arrival make their Entries with him which is always done with a good Present and from him they take all their dispatches when they depart and all matters of importance in general between Merchants are determined by him It seems to have been by his Conversion and Acquaintance with Strangers that he became so knowing beyond the rest of the Greatmen and he is also said to be himself a great Merchant  The Queen of  Achin  as 'tis said is always an old Maid chosen out of the Royal Family What Ceremonies are used at the chusing her I know not Nor who are the Electors but I suppose they are the  Oronkeys  After she is chosen she is in a manner confin'd to her Palace for by report she seldom goes abroad neither is she seen by any People of inferiour rank and quality but only by some of her Domesticks except that once a Year she is drest all in white and placed on an Elephant and so rides to the River in state to wash her self but whether any of the meaner sort of People may see her in that Progress I know not for it is the custom of most Eastern Princes to s  reen themselves from the sight of their Subjects Or if they sometimes go abroad for their pleasure yet the People are then ordered either to turn the  b  ks  towards them while they pass by as formerly at  Bantam  or to hold their Hands before their Eyes as at  Siam  At  Mindanao  they may look on their Prince but from the highest to the lowest they approach him with the greatest respect and veneration creeping very low and ofttimes on their Knees with their Eyes fixt on him and when they withdraw they return in the same manner creeping backwards and still keeping their Eyes on him till they are out of his sight  But to return to the Queen of  Achin  I think Mr  Hackluit  or  Purchas  makes mention of a King here in our King  James  I time But at least of later Years there has always been a Queen only and the  English  who reside there have been of the Opinion that these People have been governed by a Queen  ab Origine  and from the antiquity of the present constitution have formed notions that the Queen of  Sheba  who came to  Solomon  was the Queen of this Country and the Author of an old Map of the World which I have seen was it seems of this Opinion when writing the old  Hebrew  names of Nations up and down the several parts anciently known of  Europe Asia  and  Africa  he puts no other name in the Isle of  Sumatra  but that of  Sheba  But be that as it will 'tis at present part of it under a Queen tho' she has little power or authority for tho' there is seemingly abundance of respect and reverence shewn her yet she has little more than the title of a Sovereign all the Government being wholly in the hands of the  Oronkeys  While I was on my Voyage to  Tonquin  the old Queen died and there was another Queen chosen in her room but all the  Oronkeys  were not for that Election many of them were for chusing a King Four of the  Oronkeys  who lived more remote from the Court took up Arms to oppose the new Queen  and the rest of the  Oronkeys  and brought or Men against the City and thus stood the state of affairs even when we arrived here and a good while after This Army was on the East side of the River and had all the Country on that side and so much of the City also as is on that side the River under their Power But the Queen's Palace and the main part of the City which stands on the Westside held out stoutly The River is wider shallower and more sandy at the City than any where else near it yet not fordable at low Water Therefore for the better communication from one side to the other there are Ferryboats to carry Passengers to and fro In other places the Banks are steep the River more rapid and in most places very muddy so that this place just at the City it self is the most convenient to transport Men or Goods from one side to the other  It was not far from this place the Army lay as if they designed to force their passage here The Queens party to oppose them kept a small Guard of Soldiers just at the Landingplace The  Shabander  of  Achin  had a Tent set up there he being the chief manager of her Affairs and for the more security he had or small brass Guns of a Minion Bore planted by his Tent all the day with their Muzzels against the River In the Evening there were or great Trees drawn by an Elephant and placed by the side of the River for a Barricado against the Enemy and then the Brass Guns were drawn from the  Shabander  's Tent which stood not far from it and planted just behind the Trees on the rising Bank So that they looked over the Trees and they might Fire over or into the River if the Enemy approached When the Barricado was thus made and the Guns planted the Ferryboat  passed no more from side to side till the nex  morning Then you should hear the Soldiers calling  to each other not in menacing Language but as those who desired peace and quietness asking why they would not agree why they could not be of one mind and why they should desire to kill one another This was the Tone all night long in the morning as soon as Sun was risen the Gu ns were drawn again to the  Shabanders  Tent and the Trees were drawn aside to open the Passage from one side to the other and every Man then went freely about his business as if all had been as quiet as ever only the  Shabander  and his Guard staid still in their stations So that there was not any sign of Wars but in the night only when all stood to their Arms and then the Townspeople seemed to be in fear and sometimes we should have a Rumour that the Enemy would certainly make an attempt to come over  While these Stirs  asted the  Shabander  sent to all the Foreigners and desired them to keep in their own Houses in the night and told them that whatever might happen in the City by their own civil Broyls yet no harm should come to them Yet some of the  Portuguese  fearing the worst would every night put their richest Goods into a Boat ready to take their flight on the first Alarm There were at this time not above or  English  Families in the Town and  English  Ships and one  Dutch  Ship besides or  Moors  Ships of the Moguls Subjects in the Road One of the  English  Ships was called the  Nellegree  the name taken from  Nellegree  Hills in  Bengal  as I have heard She came from the Bay of  Bengal  laden with Rice Cotton c the other was the  Dorothy  of  London  Captain  Thwait  Commander who came from  Fort St George  and was bound to  Bencouli  with Soldiers but touched here as well to sell some goods as to bring a Present to the Queen from our  EastIndia  Company Captain  Thwait  according to custom went with his Present  to the Queen which she accepted and complemented him with the usual Civilities of the Country for to honour him he was set upon an Elephant of the Queens to ride to his Lodgings drest in a  Malayan  Habit which she gave him and she sent also two Dancing Girls to shew him some pastime there and I saw them at his Lodgings that Evening dancing the greatest part of the night much after the same manner of the Dancingwomen of  Mindanao  rather writhing their Hands and Bodies with several Antick Gestures than moving much out of the place they were in He had at this time about twenty great Jars of  Bengal  Butter made of Buffaloes Milk and this Butter is said also to have Lard or Hogs fat mixt with it and rank enough in these hot Countries tho' much esteemed by all the  Achinese  who give a good price for it and our  English  also use it Each of the Jars this came in contained or Gallons and they were set in Mr  Driscal  's Yard at  Achin  What other Goods the Captain brought I know not  But not long after this he being informed that the  Moors  Merchants residing here had carried off a great Treasure aboard their Ships in order to return with it to  Surrat  and our Company having now Wars with the Great Mogul Captain  Thwait  in the Evening drew of all his Seamen and seized on one of the  Moors  Ships where he thought the Treasure was The biggest he let alone She was a Ship that one Captain  Constant  took in the Road sometime before and having plundered her he gave her to the Queen of whom the  Moors  bought her again The  Moors  Merchants had speedy notice of this Action of Captain  Thwait  and they presently made their Application to the Queen for satisfaction But her affairs at this time being in such a posture as I mentioned by reason of their intestine Broyls she said she could do nothing for them  It was or a Clock the next day before we who lived ashore heard of Captain  Thwaits  proceedings but seeing the  Moors  flock to Court and not knowing what answer they had from the Queen we posted off to the Ships for fear of being imprisoned as some  English  Men had been while I was at  Tonquin  on the like score Indeed I had at this time great cause to be afraid of a Prison being sick of a Flux so that a Prison would have gone near to have killed me yet I think it fared not much better with me for the Ships I fled to afforded me but little comfort For I knew no man aboard the  Dorothy  and could expect no comfort there So I and the rest went aboard the  Nellegree  where we could more reasonably expect relief than in a Ship that came from  England  for these which come so long a Voyage are just victualled for the Service and the Seamen have every one their stinted allowance out of which they have little enough to spare to Strangers  But tho' there were Victuals enough aboard the  Nellegree  yet so weak as I then was I had more mind to rest my self than to eat and the Ship was so pestered with Goods that I could not find a place to hang up my Hammock in Therefore it being fair weather I made a shift to lye in the Boat that I came aboard in My Flux was violent and I slept but little so I had the opportunity of observing the Moon totally Eclipsed had I been in a condition to observe any thing As soon as I perceiv'd the Moon to be eclipsed I gazed at it indeed as I lay till it was totally obscured which was a pretty while but I was so little curious that I remembred not so much as what day of the Month it was and I kept no Journal of this Voyage as I did of my other but only kept an account of several particular Remarks and Observations as they occurred to me I lay three or four days thus in this  Boat and the people of the Ship were so kind as to provide me with necessaries and by this time the  Moors  had got a Pass from the  Dutch  Captain then in the Road for or Dollars as I was then told and Captain  Thwait  delivered them their Ship again but what terms he made with them I know not Thus that Fray was over and we came ashore again recovered of the fright we had been in In a short time also after this the  Achinese  all agreed to own the new Queen and so the War ended without any Bloodshed  I was perswaded to wash in the River Mornings and Evenings for the recovery of my Health and tho' it seemed strange to me before I tryed it yet I found so much comfort in the first trial that I constantly appyed my self to it I went into the River till the water was as high as my waste and then I stooped down and found the water so cool and refreshing to my Body that I was always loth to go out again Then I was sensible that my Bowels were very hot for I found a great heat within me which I found refresht by the cool water My Food was Saltfish broyled and boyled Rice mixt with  Tire Tire  is sold about the Streets there 'tis thick sower milk It is very cooling and the Saltfish and Rice is binding therefore this is thought there the proper food for the common people when they have Fluxes But the Richer Sort will have  Sago  which is brought to  Achin  from other Countries and Milk of Almonds  But to return to the state of  Achin  before I go off from it I shall add this short account of the Seasons of year there that their weather is much the same as in other Countries North of the Line and their dry Seasons Rains and Landfloods come much at the same time as at  Tonquin  and other places of North Latitude Only as  Achin  lies within a few Degrees of the Line so upon the Suns crossing the  Line in  March  the Rains begin a little sooner there than in Countries nearer the Tropick of  Cancer  and when they are once set in they are as violent there as any where I have seen it rain there for or days without intermission and the River running but a short course its head not lying very far within Land it soon overflows and a great part of the Street of the City shall on a sudden be all under water at which time People row up and down the Streets in Canoas That side of the City towards the River especially where the Foreign Merchants live and which is lower ground is frequently under Water in the wet Season a Ships Longboat has come up to the very Gate of our  English  Factory laden with Goods which at other times is ground dry enough at a good distance from the River and moderately raised above it I did not find the heat there any thing different from other places in that Latitude tho' I was there both in the wet and dry Season 'Tis more supportable than at  Tonquin  and they have constantly the Refreshment of Sea and Land Breezes every Hours  CHAP VIII  The Author prepares to go for  Pegu  Among other  a Ship arrives here from  Merga  in  Siam  Of the Massacre of the  English  there His intended Cargo for  Pegu  The arrival of other  English  Men from the City of  Siam  The Author sets out for  Malacca  instead of  Pegu  They are becalmed and soon after in great danger of running aground The Coast of  Sumatra  from  Diamond  Point to the River  Dilly  They water there and at  Pulo Verero  where they meet a Ship of  Danes  and  Moors  from  Trangambar Pulo Arii  and  Pulo Parselore  a useful Seamark to avoid Sholes near  Malacca  Shore The Author arrives at  Malacca  Town The Town and its Forts described the Conquest of it by the  Dutch  from the  Portuguese Chinese  and other Merchants residing here The Sale of Flesh and Fish the Fruits and Animals The  Shabander  State of the Trade and GuardShips  Opium  a good Commodity among the  Malayans Rattan  Cables They prepare for their return back to  Achin  AS soon as I was pretty well recovered I was Shipt Mate of the Sloop that came from  Malacca  with us which Mr  Wells  had sold to Captain  Tyler  who lately came from  Siam  and I was sent aboard to take possession of her about the beginning of  May  He who was designed to command  her came to  Achin  Mate of the  Nellegree  and we were now to go to  Pegu  but before the middle of  June  he left the Employ being sick and loth to go at this dead time of the year to  Pegu  because the Westerly Wind was set in strong and the Coast of  Pegu  is low Land and we were both unacquainted on the Coast I was then made Commander and took in Goods in order to depart for that Coast In the mean time Mr  Coventry  arrived in his Ship from the Coast of  Coromandel  laden with Rice and a small Vessel belonging to Capt  Tyler  came also from  Merga  much about the same time  This last Ship had been at  Merga  a considerable time having been seized on by the  Siamites  and all the Men imprisoned for some difference that happened between the  English  and them Neither was a Prison then thought hard usage by them for during the Havock was made of the  English  there many of those who lived at  Merga  were massacred Those who were imprisoned were kept there till all the  English  who lived at the City of  Siam  on the other side of the Kingdom withdrew from thence and then these Men had their Liberty restored also and their Ship given them but no Goods nor satisfaction for their Losses nor so much as a Compass to bring with them and but litle Provision Yet here they safely arrived this being a better Ship that I was gone aboard of Captain  Tyler  immediately  itted her up for the Sea in order to send her to  Pegu  By this time my Vessel was loaden and my Cargo was eleven thousand Coconuts five or six hundred weight of Sugar and half a dozen Chest of Drawers of  Japan  work two were very large designed for a Present to the King Besides this Capt  Tyler  for so we used to call him tho' he was only a Merchant said he intended to send a good quantity of Gold thither by which he expected to gain or  per  Cent  for by report the King of  Pegu  had lately built a very magnificent  Pagoda  and was gilding it very richly with Gold besides he was making a large Image of Masly Gold for the chief  Pagod  of this Temple By this means Gold was risen in its value here and  Achin  being a place abounding in that Metal much of it had already been sent thither from hence and more was going in other Vessels belonging to the  Moors  of  Achin  beside what Captain  Tyler  designed to send  It was now about the middle of  August  and tho' I was ready to sail yet I was ordered to stay for Captain  Tyler  's other Vessel till she had taken in her lading which was daily sent off Her Cargo also was Coconuts and she had about or already aboard When I received an order from Captaln  Tyler  to hale aboard of her and put all my Cargo into her as also all my Waterca  k and whatever else I could spare that they wanted but withal he desired me to be satisfied and told me I should in a short time be sent to Sea but that Ship being the biggest he thought it more convenient to dispatch her first I presently did as I was ordered and finding that I should not go this Voyage I sold also my small Cargo which consisted only of some Coconuts and about Nutmegs which had the Shells on as they grew on the Trees I bought all that I could meet with in the Town and paid about  d  a piece and expected to have had  d  a piece for them at  Pegu  where they are much esteemed if the Shells be on for else they don't value them  About this time the  George  a great  English  Ship belonging to one Mr  Dalton  arrived here from the City of  Siam  coming thro' the Streights of  Malacca  He had been there some years trading to and fro and had made very profitable Voyages but the late Revolution that hapned there by the Death of the  King and the unhappy fate of my Lord  Falcon  caused the  English  to withdraw from thence The  French  were all sent away some Months before being not suffered to stay in the Kingdom but before this Ship came from thence the Broyls of State were over for the new King being settled all Tumults which commonly arise in these Countries at the Death of the King were appeased The  English  were then desired to stay there and those who had yielded up their Places and Offices were even intreated to accept them again for they owned that they had all served the Nation faithfully But not long before the Revolution the Governour of  Fort St George  sent for all the  English  from thence particularly and from the Service of all other  Indian  Princes to come and serve the  EastIndia  Company at the Fort or where else they should send them For that reason they all came away with Mr  Dalton  and he in kindness to his Countrymen refused to take in Goods or Freight because he would have room enough for their passage and their Houshold Goods for here were some Families of Men Women and Children  They were a long time coming from  Siam  to  Achin  because they came against the Monsoon and in their passage they touch'd at  Malacca  and when they arrived at  Achin  Mr  Dalton  went ashore and hired an House as did also most of his Passengers and among the rest Captain  Minchin  who had formerly served the  EastIndia  Company at  Surrat  but on some disgust left that place and came to  Siam  There he was made Gunner of a Fort and maintained his Wife and Family very well in that Employ till the Revolution there and the Companies orders came and called him from thence He being now destitute of employment the Merchants there thought of making him Commander of the Vessel that I was in because Captain  Tyler  was minded to sell part of her Accordingly they met about it and the Vessel was divided into four parts three of which were purchased by Mr  Dalton  Mr  Coventry  and Capt  Minchin  and Captain  Tyler  kept the th The next day Capt  Minchin  came off with an order to me to deliver him the possession of the Ship and told me that if I liked to go his Mate I might still keep aboard till they had agreed on a Voyage I was forced to submit and accepted a Mates Employ under Captain  Minchin  It was not long before we were ordered for  Malacca  to buy Goods there We carried no Goods with us besides or pound of Opium  It was about the middle of  September  when we sailed from  Achin  We were four white Men in the Vessel the Captain and Mr  Coventry  who went Supercargo my self and the Boatswain For common Seamen we had or  Moors  and generally in these Country Ships the Whitemen are all Officers Two days after we left  Achin  being becalmed under the Shore we came to an Anchor Not long after a Ship coming in from the Seaward came to an anchor about mile ahead of us Mr  Coventry  knew her to be a  Danish  Ship belonging to  Trangambar  and therefore we hoisted out our Boat and thought to have spoken with her but a small breeze springing up they weighed their Anchors and went away neither would they speak with us tho' we made signs for them to stay We weighed also and jogg'd on after them but they sailed better than we We met little Winds and Calms so that it was seven or eight days before we got as far as  Diamondpoint  which is about forty leagues from  Achin  Being about four leagues short of that point Captain  Minchin  desired me to set the Land and withal prick the Card and see what Course we ought to  keep all night for it was now about a clock and we had a fine gale at W S W our course yet being E S E  After I had set the Land I went into the Cabbin to look over the Draught to see what course we must steer after we came about the Point Mr  Coventry  followed me and when I had satisfied my self he asked me what course we must steer I told him E S E till a clock if the gale stood and then we might hale more Southerly He seemed to be startled at it and told me that the Captain and he had been pricking the Card and thought that S E or S E by S course would do well at a clock I said it was a good course to run ashore he argued a long time with me but I persisted in my opinion and when I told Captain  Minchin  of my opinion he was well satisfied Presently after this we had a pretty strong Tornado out of the S W which obliged us to hand our Topsail When the stress of the weather was over we set our sails again and went in to Supper and ordered the Man at Helm not to come to the Southward of the E S E We stayed in the Cabbin till about a clock and then we came out to set the Watch It was now very dark by reason of a ThunderCloud that hung rumbling over the Land yet by the flashes of lightning we plainly saw the Land right ahead of us I was much surprized and ran into the Steeridge to look on the Compass and found that we were steering S S E instead of E S E I clapt the Helm a Starboard and brought her to N E by E and N E and we very narrowly escap'd being cast away  When we first went to Supper we were leagues off Land and then E S E was a good course the Land lying E S E parallel with our course  But then the Man at Helm mistaking his Compass steer'd S S E which runs right in upon the Shore I believe we had also some countercurrent or Tide that help'd us in for we were quickly got into a Bay within the points of Land So that 'twas now absolutely necessary to steer Northerly to get out of the Bay and by this time Mr  Coventry  was satisfied with what I told him in the Evening and was convinced of his Error I undertook to direct the Man at Helm and the Wind continuing I kept off till ten a clock then I steered E S E till and then haled up S S E and in the morning we were about leagues S E from  Diamondpoint  and about leagues to the North of an Island  The Land from hence lying S S E we steered so but meeting with calms again we anchored several times before we came to the River of  Dilly  which is leagues from  Diamondpoint  The Land between seems to be uneven most of it pretty high and very woody and 'tis said that all this Country as far as the River  Dilly  is under the Queen of  Achin  About a League before we came to that River being within mile of the Shore we saw the Water of a muddy grey colour and tasting it sound it to be sweet Therefore we presently filled some of our Water Cask and 'tis an ordinary thing in several places to take up fresh Water at Sea against the mouth of some River where it floats above the Saltwater but we must dip but a little way down for sometimes if the Bucket goes but a foot deep it takes up Saltwater with the fresh  In the Evening we had a fine Land Breeze with which we ran along the Shore keeping on a wind and sounding every now and then At last we were got among the Sholes at the mouth of that River and puzled to get out again The River  is in Lat d m N It seems to be very large but it is not well known but only to the Natives who inhabit it and they are not very sociable but are by report a sort of Pirats living on rapin In the Morning we saw a Sail standing off to an Island called  Pulo Verero  lying in Lat d m N seven Leagues from the Mouth of the River  Dilly  We having a fair Wind stood after them intending there to wood and water at  Pulo Verero  For tho we took no fresh Water the Evening before out of the Sea yet at the River of  Dilly  it was brackish for tho' the fresh Water is born up by the Salt and it might be intire without mixture yet by plunging of the Bucket somewhat to low we might probably take up some of the Salt water with it They came to an Anchor about or a clock in the Afternoon but the Wind slacken'd and it was a Clock at night before we came thither We Anchored about a mile from them and presently hoysed out our Boat to go aboard for we judged that this was the  Danish  Ship that we saw when we came first from  Achin  I went in the Boat because Mr  Coventry  told me that Mr  Coppinger  was Surgeon of her the same Person who was with me in the Boat when I was set a shore at the  Nicobar  Isles but was not suffered to stay with me Mr  Coventry  was now in the Boat with me and we went and haled the Ship asking whence she came and who was Commander They answered they were  Danes  from  Trangambar  for 'twas the Ship we took it to be Then they askt who we were I answered  English  from  Achin  and that Mr  Coventry  was in the Boat but they would not believe it till Mr  Coventry  spoke and the Captain knew his Voice neither did they till then believe we were Friends for they had every man his Gun in his hand ready  o fire on us if we had gone aboard without haling  s Mr  Coventry  would have done in confidence  that they knew him had not I disswaded him For it seems they were extreamly afraid of us insomuch that the Commander seeing us follow them in the morning would not have touched at these Islands tho' he was in great want of Water and had not his Black Merchants fallen before him on their Knees and even prayed him to take pity on them they had not anchored here These Merchants were Inhabitants of  Trangambar  on the Coast of  Coromandel  They having no Ships of their own when the  Danes  fit out a Ship on any Voyage that they are inclined to these  Moors  are obliged to joyn Stock with them and they first make an Offer of it to them as a kindness and the  Moors  being generally desirous to Trade frequently accept of it almost on any Terms but should they be unwilling yet dare they not refuse for fear of disobliging the  Danes  who are Lords of the place In this Ship I found Mr  Coppenger  and he was the first that I had seen of all the Company that left me at the  Nicobar  Islands The next morning we filled our water and weigh'd again the  Dane  being gone a little before He was bound to  Jihore  to load Pepper but intended to touch at  Malacca  as most Ships do that pass these Streights He also sailed better than we and therefore left us to follow him  We stood on yet nearest to the  Sumatra  Shore till we came in sight of  Pulo Arii  in Lat d m N These are several Islands lying S E by E ▪Easterly from  Pulo Verero  about Leagues distant These Islands are good marks for Ships bound thro' the Streights for when they bear S E at  or Leagues distance you may steer away E by S for the  Malacca  Shore from whence you then may be about leagues The first Land you will see is  Pulo Parsalore  which is a high peeked Hill in the Country on the  Malacca  Coast which standing by it self amidst a low Country it appears like an Island  tho' I know not whether it is really one for it stands some miles within the Shoar of the Continent of  Malacca  It is a very remarkable Hill and the only Seamark for Seamen to guide themselves through certain Sands that lye near the Main and if it is thick hazy Weather and the Hill is obscur'd Pilots unless they are very knowing in the Soundings will hardly venture in for the Channel is not above a League wide and there are large Shoals on each side These Shoals lye ten leagues from  Pulo Arii  and continue till within or of the  Malacca  shoar In the Channel there is or fathom water but you may keep in or fathom on either side and sounding all the way you may pass on without danger  We had a good gale at West which brought us in sight of  Pulo Parsalore  and so we kept sounding till we came within the Shoar and then we had the Town of  Malacca  about leagues distant from us to the S E and by E Being shot over to the  Malacca  shore there is a good wide Channel to sail in you having the Shoals on one side and the Land on the other to which last you may come as nigh as you see convenient for there is water enough and good anchoring The Tide runs pretty strong here the Flood sets to the Eastward and the Ebb to the West and therefore when there is little wind and Ships cannot stem the Tide they commonly anchor But we being in with the  Malacca  Shoar had a westerly Wind which brought us before  Malacca  Town about the middle of  October  and here I first heard that King  William  and Queen  Mary  were crowned King and Queen of  England  The  Dane  that left us at  Pulo Verero  was not yet arrived for as we afterwards understood they could not find the way through the Sands but were forced to keep along without them and fetch a great Compass about which retarded their Passage  Malacca  is a pretty large Town of about or Families of  Dutch  and  Portuguese  many of which are a mixt breed between those Nations There are also many of the Native  Malayans  inhabiting in small Cottages on the Skirts of the Town The  Dutch  Houses are built with Stone and the Streets are wide and straight but not paved At the North West of the Town there is a Wall and Gate to pass in and out and a small Fort always guarded with Soldiers The Town stands on a level low ground close by the Sea The Land on the backside of the Town seems to be morassy and on the West side without the Wall there are Gardens of Fruits and Herbs and some fair  Dutch  Houses but that Quarter is chiefly the habitation of the  Malayans  On the East side of the Town there is a small River which at a Spring Tide will admit small Barks to enter About paces from the Sea there is a Drawbridge which leads from the midst of the Town to a strong Fort built on the East side of the River  This is the chief Fort and is built on a low level ground close by the Sea at the Foot of a little steep Hill Its form is semicircular according to the natural position of the adjacent Hill It fronts chiefly to the Sea and having its foundation on firm Rocks the Walls are carried up to a good height and of a considerable thickness The lower part of it is washed by the Sea every Tide On the back of the Hill the Land being naturally low there is a very large Moat cut from the Sea to the River which makes the whole an Island and that back part is stockadoed round with great Trees set up an end so that there is no entring when once the Drawbridge is haled up On the Hill within this Fort stands a small Church big enough to receive all the Townspeople who come hither on  Sundays  to hear Divine Service and on the Main  beyond the Fort the  Malayans  are also seated close by the Sea  The first  Europeans  who setled here were the  Portuguese  They also built the great Fort but whether they moted round the Hill and made an Island of that spot of ground I know not nor what charges have been bestowed on it since to make it defenceable nor what other alterations have been made but the whole Building seems to be pretty ancient and that part of it which fronts to the Sea was in all probability built by the  Portugnese  for there are still the marks of the Conquerours shot in the Walls It is a place so naturally strong that I even wonder how they could be beaten out but when I consider what other places they then lost and their mismanagements I am the less surprized at it The  Portuguese  were the first discoverers by Sea of the  EastIndies  and had thereby the Advantage of Trade with these rich  Eastern  People as also an opportunity thro' their weakness to settle themselves where they pleased Therefore they made Settlements and Fortsamong them in divers places of  India  as here for one and persuming upon the strength of their Forts they insulted over the Natives and being grown rich with Trade they fell to all manner of looseness and debauchery the usual concomitant of Wealth and as commonly the forerunner of Ruin The  Portuguese  at this place by report made use of the Native Women at their pleasure whether Virgins or Married Women such as they liked they took without control and it is probable they as little restrained their lust in other places for the Breed of them is scattered all over  India  neither are there any People of more different Complexions than of that Race even from the coalblack to a light tawney These injuries exasperated the Native  Maylayans  here who joyning with the  Dutch  as I have been informed found means to betray to them their insolent Masters the  Portuguese  than whom there are not a more despicable people now in all the  Eastern  Nations and of all they once possest they have now only  Goa  left of any place of consequence The  Dutch  are now Masters of most of the places they were once possest of and particularly this of  Malacca  Malacca  is a place of no great Trade yet there are several  Moors  Merchants always residing here These have Shops of Wares such as come from  Surrat  and the Coast of  Coromandel  and  Bengal  The  Chinese  also are seated here who bring the Commodities of their Country hither especially Tea Sugarcandy and other Sweetmeats Some of them keep Teahouses were for a Stiver a man has near a pint of Tea and a little Porrenger of Sugarcandy or other Sweetmeats if he pleases Others of them are Butchers their chief flesh is Pork which you may have very reasonably either fresh or salted Neither are you desired to take any particular piece but they will cut a piece at one place and the like at another either  at or lean as you would have it▪ Others among these  Chinese  are Tradespeople and they are all in general very industrious but withal extraordinary Gamesters and if they can get any to play with them all business must submit to that  This Town is plentiful stored with Fish also When the Fishermen come in they all resort to a place built purposely for the sale of them There are Soldiers waiting who take the best for the Officers of the Fort Whether they pay for it or that 'tis a Toll of Custom belonging to the Governor I know not but after they have served the rest are sold to any who will buy The manner  of selling is thus The Fish which every man brings in is sorted yet all sold by the lump at once in the manner of an Outcry or Auction but not by raising but lowering the price for there is one appointed for this sale who sets the First price higher than the value of the Fish and falls by degrees till the price seems reasonable then one or other buys But these first Bargains are commonly bought by the Fishwives who retail them out again Oysters are  great plenty here and very good when the  alt but sometimes they are fresh and unsavo    As for other Provisions their Rice is brought to them from abroad Such Fruits as they have are much the same as I have already described and are proper to the Climate as Plantains Bonanoes Pineapples Oranges Watermelons Pumplenoses Mango's c but these are only in their Gardens in no great plenty and the Country is all covered with Wood like one Forest and most of our WalkingCanes used in  England  are brought from thence They have also a few Cattle Bullocks and Horses c having but little Pasturage but good store of tame Fowl Ducks and Poultry The principal person in the Town is the  Shahander  a  Dutch  man next in power to the Governour who lives in the Fort and meddles not with Trade which is the  Shahander  's Province who seems to be chiefly concerned about the Customs of Goods  This Town has no great Trade by what I could see but it seems to be designedly built to command the passage of Shipping going this way to the more  Eastern  Nations Not but that Ships may pass far enough out of reach of their Cannon but Guardships belonging to the Town and lying in the Road may hinder others from passing How the  Portuguese  managed their Affairs I know not  but the  Dutch  commonly keep a Guardship here and I have been told they require a certain Duty of all Vessels that pass this way the  English  only excepted for all Ships touch at this place especially for Wood Water and Refreshment  Two days after our arrival here the  Danish  Ship came also to an Anchor but reporting that they were bound to  Jihore  to lade Pepper the  Dutch  told them it was but in vain for them to seek a Trade there for that the King of  Jihore  had agreed with the  Dutch  to Trade only with them and that to secure that Trade they had a Guardship lying there I had this account from the Surgeon Mr  Coppinger  who seemed a little concerned at it because when he told me this he could not tell whether they should proceed thither or no but they did go thither and sound all this a sham and Traded there to their own and the Natives satisfaction as he told me the next time I met him This of  Jihore  being but a small Kingdom on the same  Malacca  Coast 'tis not of strength sufficient to resist the power of the  Dutch  neither could it benefit the  Dutch  to take it should they attempt it for the people would probably forsake it and it would be too great a charge for the  Dutch  to settle it themselves And therefore they only endeavour to ingross the Pepper Trade and it is probable enough that the  Dutch  might sometimes keep a Guardship there as they do at other places particularly at  Queda Pulo Dinding  c For where there is any Trade to be had yet not sufficient to maintain a Factory for where there may not be a convenient place to build a Fort so as to secure the whole Trade to themselves they send their Guardships which lying at the mouth of the Rivers deter Strangers from coming thither and keep the petty Princes in awe of them They commonly make a  shew as if they did this out of kindness to those People yet most of them know otherwise but dare not openly resent it This probably causes so many petty Robberies and Piracies as are commited by the  Malayans  on this Coast The  Malayans  who inhabit on both sides the Streights of  Malacca  are in general a bold People and yet I do not find any of them addicted to Robbery but only the pilfering poorer sort and even these severely punished among the Trading  Malayans  who love Trade and Property But being thus provoked by the  Dutch  and hindred of a free Trade by their Guardships it is probable they therefore commit Piracies themselves or connive at and incourage those who do So that the Pirates who lurk on this Coast seem to  o it as much to revenge themselves on the  Dutch  for restraining their Trade as to gain this way what they cannot obtain in way of Traffick  But to return to our concerns here I have said already that we had only or  l  of  Opium  in Goods the rest was in Money to the value of Dollars in the whole but we did not pretend that we came hither purposely to trade but that finding our Vessel unfit for the Sea we put in here to mend and repair her Leave was granted us for this and I prepared to hale our Vessel ashore at the West end of the Town not far from the small Fort It is there soft Oazy ground near a mile off shore and it deepens very leisurely being shole water just by the shore and when the Tide goes out it leaves the Oaz dry a quarter of a mile from the shore but a mile from shore you have clean Sand and about fathom at low Water Our Vessel floated in close to the Fort and lay not yards from it and at low water it sunk down into the mud that we could not fit the afterpart as I would  have done  Opium  which is much used by the  Malayans  in most places was a great Commodity here at this time but it is prohibited Goods and therefore tho' many asked for it we were shy of having it too openly known that we had any But in short Mr  Coventry  found a Customer and they found means to get it ashore while the Soldiers of the Fort were at dinner The Customer was a  Dutch  Man and the price he was to pay for it was as much as he was worth and finding it to be nought he would have been off his Bargain and when Mr  Coventry  would not release him he absconded But Mr  Coventry  having an Interest in the  Shabander  he compell'd the Man's Wife to pay for the  Opium  under the Name of Gold for so Mr  Coventry  call'd it The  Shabander  chid Mr  Coventry  for smugling with an inferiour when he might have done it better with him but stood his Friend in compelling the Woman tho' unjustly to pay for the  Opium  I saw this  Dutch  man on board his own Vessel when he had bought the  Opium  and he was very pensive and sad He had a pretty fine House without the Gates and a Garden which maintained his Family with PotHerbs Sallading and Fruits besides some for the Market This was managed by his Wife and he himself had two Sloops and either imployed them in Trading among the  Malayans  for Pepper carrying them such Commodities as they wanted especially  Opium  or by hiring himself and Sloop to the  Dutch EastIndia  Company to go whither they would send him It was not long since he had been at the Spice Islands with Rice which he sold at a profitable rate but he told me he was not suffered to bring any Spice from thence except eight or ten pound for his own spending neither was there so much profit that way for him  as by trading at home among the  Malayans  either on the Coast of  Malacca  or  Sumatra  For tho' he and other free Men are not suffered to trade for themselves to any places where the Company have Factories or Guardships yet they could find Trade enough nearer home and by this Trade the Freemen of  Malacca  pick up a good livelihood It was on this Home Trade that he was now bound and the  Opium  had been very beneficial to him had it been good but he went away and ordered his Wife not to pay for it but left Mr  Coventry  to take it again and upon the  Shabander  's compelling her to take it and pay for it she complained they were utterly undone for the  Opium  when it came to be examined was really very bad and worth little or nothing  Here Mr  Coventry  bought Irons Bars Arack Canes and Rattans wherewith we load our Vessel which was now set afloat again The  Dutch  brought most of our Goods aboard and were more kind then I expected for they had not used to Trade with us and I believe the news of our Revolution in  England  had sweetned them for they often drank the Konings Health with us very heartily While we were here we made two new Cables of Rattans each of them Inches about Our Captian bought the Rattans and hired a  Chinese  to work them who was very expert at making such wooden Cables These Cables I found serviceable enough after in mooring the Vessel with either of them for when I carried out the Anchor the Cable being thrown out after me swam like Cork in the Sea so that I could see when it was tight which we cannot so well discern in our Hemp Cables whose weight sinks them down nor can we carry them out but by placing two or three Boats at some distance asunder  to buoy up the Cable while the LongBoat rows out the Anchor To conclude with  Malacca  our Goods being all aboard we fill'd our Water and got all in a readiness for our departure back again  CHAP IX  The Author departs from  Malacca  They lose a Yard

Conclusion of the  Supplement  WE departed from  Malacca  towards  Achin  about the middle of  November  Mr  Coventry  being weary of Captain  Minchin  's Company had bought a small Vessel of or Tuns and laded her also with the same kind of Goods This he commanded himself having a  Portuguese  Pilot and or Mariners under him and we set out both Ships in Company together We had now in Captain  Minchin  's Ship but white Men the Captain and I the Boatswain being gone with Mr  Coventry  but we took in as a Passenger one Mr  Richards  an  Englishman  who having lately married a  Dutch  Woman at  Malacca  came aboard us with her to go as Passengers to  Achin  with us  We had a Land Wind in the morning and about a clock had the Wind at N W a pretty strong gale and at our Foreyard broke in the middle We made signs to Mr  Coventry  to bear down to us who weighing before was a mile to Windward of us but he kept on fearing to return as having bought his Ship there by stealth and we therefore returned alone into  Malacca  Road As soon as we anchored Mr  Richards  was sent ashore to buy a new Yard I gave him the length and bigness It was Evening before he came aboard again and he brought aboard an old Yard much too big and too long for us This piece I shortned and shaped to my mind and by a clock at Night had it fixed and slung rigg'd and the Sail bent to it  Then we weighed again having a small land Wind but the Tide of flood was against us and drove us to the Eastward When the Ebb came we jogg'd on and got about three leagues anchoring when the flood came because the Winds were against us Thus we continued plying with the Ebb and anchoring every flood till we came to  Pulo Parselore  where the Captain told me he would not go out the same way we came in as I would have persuaded him but kept the  Malacca  Shore aboard and past within the Sholes But in a few Hours after we ran upon a Shole driven on it by the Tide of Flood which here set to the Eastward tho' by our reckoning it should have been half Ebb and the flood should have set Westward as we had it all the rest of the way from  Malacca  but the Sholes probably caused some whirling about of the Tide However the Sand we were stuck upon was not above yards in circumference and the flood being rising we  waited the time of high Water and then drove over it having sent our Boat to discover how the Sholes lay while our Ship was aground Mr  Richards  all the while being in great fear lest the  Malayans  should come off in their Boats and attack the Vessel  We were now afloat again and soon got without all the Sholes yet we did not stand over towards  Sumatra  but coasted along nearest the  Malacca  shore it being now most proper for us so to do yet for having the Winds westerly we could not have beat under the other shore or days after this we had sight of some Islands called  Pulo Sambilong  which in the  Malayan  Language signifies nine Islands there being so many of them lying scattering at unequal distances from each other It was near one of these Islands that Captain  Minchin  in a former Voyage was like to loose his hand by a prick with a Catfishes Fin as I have said in my former Vol p und tho' his hand was cured yet he has lost the use of it ever since and is never likely to regain it more  We stood in pretty near the shore in hopes to gain a fresh Land Wind About a Clock the Land Wind came off a gentle breez and we coasted along the shore But a small Tornado coming off from the shore about midnight we broke our Mizen Yard and being near a  Dutch  Island called  Pulo Dinding  we made in for it and anchored there the Night ensuing and found there a  Dutch  Sloop mann'd with about Soldiers at an anchor  This is a small Island lying so nigh the Main that Ships passing by cannot know it to be an Island It is pretty high Land and well watered with Brooks The Mould is blackish deep and fat in the lower Ground but the Hills are somewhat Rocky yet in general very Wood The Trees are of divers sorts many of which are good Timber and large enough for any use Here are also some good for Masts and Yards they being naturally  light yet tough and serviceable There is good riding on the East side between the Island and the Main You may come in with the Sea Breeze and go out with a Land Wind there is Water enough and a secure Harbour  The  Dutch  who are the only Inhabitants have a Fort on the East side close by the Sea in a bending of the Island which makes a small Cove for Ships to anchor in The Fort is built square without Flankers or Bastions like a House every Square is about or yards The Walls are of a good thickness made of stone and carried up to a good heighth of about foot and covered over head like a dwelling House There may be about or Guns in it some looking out at every Square These Guns are mounted on a strong Platform made within the Walls about Foot high and there are steps on the out side to ascend to the Door that opens to the Platform there being no other way into the Fort Here is a Governour and about or Soldiers who all lodge in the Fort The Soldiers have their lodging in the Platform among the Guns but the Governour has a fair Chamber above it where h  lies with some of the Officers About a hundred yards from the Fort on the Bay by the Sea there is a low timbered House where the Governour abides all the day time In this House there were two or three Rooms for their use but the chiefest was the Governours Dining Room This fronted to the Sea and the end of it looked towards the Fort There were two large Windows of about or Foot Square the lower part of them about or foot from the Ground These Windows were wont to be left open all the day to let in the refreshing Breeze but in the night when the Governour withdrew to the Fort they were closed with strong shutters and the Doors made fast til  the next day The Continent of  Malacca  opposite to the Island is pretty low champion Land cloathed with lofty Woods and right against the Bay where the  Dutch  Fort stands there is a navigable River for small Craft  The product of the Country thereabouts besides Rice and other Eatables is  Tutaneg  a sort of  Tin  I think courser than ours The Natives are  Malayans  who as I have always observed are bold and treacherous yet the Trading People are affable and courteous to Merchants  These are in all respects as to their Religion Custom and manner of Living like other  Malayans  Whether they are governed by a King or Raja or what other manner of Government they live under I know not They have Canoas and Boats of their own and with these they fish and traffick among themselves but the Tin Trade is that which has formerly drawn Merchant Strangers thither But tho' the Country might probably yield great quanities of this Metal and the Natives are not only inclinable but very desirous to trade with Strangers yet are they now restrained by the  Dutch  who have monopoliz'd that Trade to themselves It was probably for the lucre of this Trade that the  Dutch  built the Fort on the Island but this not wholly answering their ends by reason of the distance between it and the Rivers mouth which is about or miles they have also a Guardship commonly lying here and a Sloop with or armed men to hinder other Nations from this Trade For this  Tutaneg  or Tin is a valuable Commodity in the Bay of  Bengal  and here purchased reasonably by giving other Commoditiesin exchange neither is this Commodity peculiarly found hereabouts but farther Northerly also on the Coast and particularly in the Kingdom of  Qu  da  there is much of it The  Dutch  also commonly keep a  Guardship and have made some fruitless essays to bring that Prince and his Subjects to trade only with them but here over against  P Dinding  no Strangers dare approach to trade neither may any Ship come in hither but with consent of the  Dutch  Therefore as soon as we came to an Anchor at the East end of the Island we sent our Boat a shore to the Governour to desire leave to wood water and cut a new Mizin yard He granted our request and the Boat returned again aboard and brought word also that Mr  Coventry  touch'd here to water and went out that morning The next morning betimes Captain  Minchin  sent me ashore to cut a Yard I applyed my self to the Governour and desired one of his Soldiers might go with me and shew me the best Timber for that use but he excused himself saying that his Soldiers were all busie at present but that I might go and cut any Tree that I lik'd So I went into the Woods where I saw abundance of very fine strait Trees and cut down such a one as I thought fit for my turn and cutting it of a just length and stripping off the Bark I left it ready to be fetcht away and return'd to the Fort where I dined with the Governour Presently after dinner our Captain with Mr  Richards  and his Wife came ashore and I went aboard The Governour met them at Landing and conducted them into the Dining Room I spoke of where they treated the Govenour with Punch made of Brandy Sugar and Limejuice which they brought with them from aboard for here is nothing not so much as the Governours drink but what is brought from  Malacca  no Herbs or Fruit growing here but all is either fetch from  Malacca  or is brought by the  Malayans  from the Main It is not through any sterility in the Soyl for that is very fat and fruitful neither is it through laziness o  the  Dutch  for that is a vice they are net guilty of  but it is from a continual fear of the  Malayans  with whom tho' they have a Commerce yet dare they not trust them so far as to be ranging about the Island in any work of Husbandry or indeed to go far from the Fort for there only they are safe But to return to the Governour he to retalliate the Captains and Mr  Richard  's kindness sent a Boat a fishing to get some better entertainment for his Guests than the Fort yielded at present About or a Clock the Boat returned with a good Dish of Fish These were immediately drest for Supper and the Boat was sent out again to get more for Mr  Richards  and his Lady to carry aboard with them In the mean time the Food was brought into the DiningRoom and placed on the Table The Dishes and Plates were of Silver and there was a Silver PunchBowl full of Liquor The Govenour his Guests and some of his Officers were seated but just as they began to fall to one of the Soldiers cried out  Malayans  and spoil'd the Entertainment for immediately the Governour without speaking one word leapt out of one of the Windows to get as soon as he could to the Fort His Officers followed and all the Servants that attended were soon in motion Every one of them took the nearest way some out of the Windows others out of the Doors leaving the Guests by themselves who soon followed with all the haste they could make without knowing the meaning of this sudden consternation of the Governour and his People But by that time the Captain and Mr  Richards  and his Wife were got to the Fort the Governour who was arrived before stood at the door to receive them As soon as they were entred the Fort the Door was shut all the Soldiers and Servants being within already nor was any man suffered to fetch away the Victuals or any of the Plate but they fired several Guns to give notice  to the  Malayans  that they were ready for them but none of them came on For this Uproar was occasioned by a  Malayan  Canoa full of armed Men that lay skulking under the Island close by the Shore and when the  Dutch  Boat went out the second time to fish the  Malayans  set on them suddenly and unexpected with their Cressets and Lances and killing one or two the rest leapt overboard and got away for they were close by the Shore and they having no Arms were not able to have made any resistance It was about a mile from the Fort and being landed every one of them made what haste he could to the Fort and the first that arrived was he who cried in that manner and frighted the Governour from Supper Our Boat was at this time ashore for water and was filling it in a small Brook by the Banquettinghouse I know not whether our Boats Crew took notice of the Alarm but the  Dutch  call'd to them and bid them make haste aboard which they did and this made us keep good watch all night having all our Guns loaden and primed for service But it rained so hard all the night that I did not much fear being attack'd by any  Malayans  being informed by one of our Seamen whom we took in at  Malacca  that the  Malayans  seldom or never make any attack when it rains It is what I had before observed of other  Indians  both  East  and  West  and tho' then they might make their Attacks with the greatest advantage on Men armed with Handguns yet I never knew it practised at which I have wondered for it is then we most fear them and they might then be most successful because their Arms which are usually Lances and Cressets which these  Malayans  had could not be damaged by the Rain as our Guns would be But they cannot endure to be in the Rain and it was in the Evening before the Rain fell that they assaulted the  Dutch  Boat The next Morning the  Dutch  Sloop weighed and went to look after the  Malayans  but having sailed about the Island and seeing no Enemies they anchored again I also sent Men ashore in our Boat to bring off the Mizenyard that I had cut the Day before But it was so heavy a kind of Timber that they could not bring it out of the Woods Captain  Minchin  was still ashore and he being acquainted with it desired the Governor to send a Soldier to shew our Men what Trees were best for our use Which he did and they presently cut a small Tree  about the bigness and length of that which I cut and brought it aboard I immediately went to work and having fitted it for use bent my Sail and hoised it up in its place In the Evening Captain  Minchin  and Mr  Richards  and his Wife came aboard having staid one Night at the Fort and told me all that hapned to them ashore  We now waited only for a Land Wind to carry us out The former part of the Night we had much Rain with Thunder and Lightning but no Wind At one a Clock we had a small Land Wind and got up our Anchors We got out before Day clear of the Island and we steered along shore to the Northward intending to keep this shore aboard for or Leagues farther if the Winds did not favour us for the Sea Winds were now at N W This Day we kept near the shore and the Night ensuing but the next Day the Wind coming at N and N N E we stood over for  Sumatra  and the next Evening we past by  Diamond  Point And the Wind coming at E N E we got in about Days more to  Achin  about the end of  November    Here we found Mr  Coventry  who had got hither or Days before us Captain  Minchin  went ashore with his Passengers and was discharged of his Command I kept aboard till all the Goods were unladen and then lay ashore and was very sick for a  Fortnight of a kind of Fever But after  Christmas  I was sent aboard again by order of Mr  Coventry  who had then bought out Mr  Dalton  's and Capt  Tiler  's shares to take the Charge of the Vessel which he had then laded with Pepper Cubebs which I think grow somewhere in  Sumatra  and  Tutanegg  which he bought of an  English  Vessel that came from  Queda  to  Achin  and with these he had also some of our  Malacca  Cargo which we kept on board  viz  Rattans and Walking Canes With this Cargo we were bound for  Fort St George  We took in also  English  Passengers who had escaped out of Prison in the  Mogul  's Country The one belong'd to the  Defence  Capt  Heath  's Ship which I came home to  England  in afterwards he was Purser of it the other was a Midshipman in the  Princess Ann  which return'd to  England  at the same Time But during our War with the  Mogul  these Ships had been in the Bay of  Bengal  to fetch away our Effects from the  of  Hugly  These Men with or others went ashore upon some Occasion and were taken Prisoners by the  Mogul  's Subjects who sent them a great way up into the Country where they were kept in close Custody and often threatned with Death The old  Anabob  or Governor of the Province being remov'd and a new one coming thither he released these Men and gave them leave to go to the Sea side where finding a  Dutch  ship bound to  Batavia  these and one more went aboard her the rest getting other Passage But she meeting with that  English  Ship coming from  Queda  which brought the  Tutanegg  I but now mentioned to  Achin  they left the  Dutch  Ship and went to  Achin  with the other  English  Vessel and those were now for going with us to  Fort St George  'Twas about Newyears day that we set out from  Achin  again We steered away toward the  Nicobar  Islands and came in sight of that which I had been formerly set ashore upon But leaving  it on our Starboard we stood more Northerly up into the Bay for by Mr  Coventry  I had learnt there were Northerly and North Easterly winds in the Bay at this time of Year We stood over therefore as high as  Pallacat  and having then a fair North East Wind we run along the Coast till we came before  Fort St George  which was about the middle of  January  I was much pleased with the beautiful prospect this place makes off at Sea For it stands in a plain Sandy spot of Ground close by the shore the Sea sometimes washing its Walls which are of Stone and high with Half Moons and Flankers and a great many Guns mounted on the Battlements so that what with the Walls and fine Buildings within the Fort the large Town of  Maderas  without it the Pyramids of the  English  Tombs Houses and Gardens adjacent and the variety of fine Trees scatter'd up and down it makes as agreeable a Landskip as I have any where seen  But 'tis not my design to enter into a Description of a place so well known to my CountryMen as this is It may suffice to have mentioned it and that after some Months stay here and meeting with Mr  Moody  and  Jeoly  the Painted Prince I prepared to go for  Sumatra  again to  Bencouli  as I have said in my former Vol p I set out from  Fort St George  with Captain  Howel  in  July  we steered a pretty way along the Coast of  Coromandel  before we stood over for  Sumatra  and then made the best of our way for  Bencouli  I have in that Volume spoken of my Arrival there but having given no account of the place I shall do it briefly now and so shut up this  Suppliment  Bencouli  lies on the West Coast of the Island of  Sumatra  in about d S Lat It is a place noted enough at Sea by reason of a high slender Hill in the Country It has a small Island before it within which Ships ride The point of  Stillabar  lies or  Leagues to the Southward of it and runs out farther than any part of the Shore making a small Bay within it Besides these marks when you come within or Leagues of the Shore you'll see the  English  Fort fronting to the Sea which makes a fine show On the N W of the Fort is a small River at the Mouth of which is a large Storehouse to put Pepper in About a quarter of a Mile from the Sea stands a small  Indian  Village close by the River on the same side that the Fort is on and but a small distance from it The Houses are small and low all built on Posts after the  Malayan  manner as at  Mindanao  and  Achin  for 'tis a Swamp that the Town stands on But the  Malayans  usually choose to build in such low places near Rivers for the convenience of washing themselves which they greatly delight in as 'tis indeed a part of their Religion as  Mahometans  And if they can they will have their Houses stand on Posts over the River  The Weather here is none of the pleasantest There are great Rains chiefly in  September October  and  November  and pretty great Heats But when the Wind blew hard which 'twould often do the Air would be chill And the Seabreezes in fair Weather were generally pretty fresh and comfortable The Land Winds coming over Swamps usually brought a Stink with them 'Tis in general an unhealthy Place and the Soldiers of the Fort were sickly and died very fast On the South side of the Fort is a fair champion Savannah of a Mile or Two Square called  Greenhil  It produces long thick Grass The N W part of it fronts the Sea and the S E is bounded with lofty Woods  The Soil of this Country is very different according to its different position For within Land 'tis hilly yet those Hills are clothed with Trees which shews it to be fruitful enough The low Land near the River especially near the Sea is swampy producing nothing but Reeds or Bamboes  But the higher Ground which is of a reasonable heighth is very fruitful The Mould is deep and is either black or yellow and in some places Clay or such Mould as is very proper for making Bricks  The Trees in the Woods are mostly large bodied straight and tall They are of divers sorts some or other of them fit for any uses The Fruits of the Country are much the same as at  Achin  and  Malaca viz  Limes Oranges Guava's Plantains Bonanoes Coco Nuts Jacks Durains Mangoes Mangastans Pomkins Pine apples and Pepper The Roots are Yams and Potatoes Rice grows here pretty well also but whether the Natives sow enough for their own spending or no I know not The Land Animals are Buffaloes Bullocks Deer Wild Hogs Porcupines Guanoes Lizards c The tame Fowls are Ducks and Dunghil Fowls both in great plenty The wild Fowl are Parrots Parakites Pidgeons TurtleDoves and many sort of smaller Birds  The Natives also are swarthy  Indians  like their Neighbours of  Achin  They are slender straight active and industrious They are sociable and desirous of Trade but if they are affronted they are treacherous and revengeful They live together in Towns and speak the  Malayan  Language Conforming themselves in their Habit Food and Customs to other  Malayans  who are all so far as I learnt of the  Mahometan  Religion There are some Mechanicks among them a few Smiths But most of them are Carpenters and let themselves out to hire to the  English  at the Fort The Hatchets they work with are such as they use at  Mindanao  so contrived as to serve also for an Ads Here are also Fishermen who get a livelihood by Fishing and there are several sorts of Fish on the Coast besides plenty of Green Turtle Such of the  Malayans  as live near the  English  Fort are usually employed in the  EastIndia  Companies Service to work for  them but the Country People are most Husbandmen They plant Roots Rice Pepperbushes c  Pepper is the chief vendible Commodity in this Country it thrives very well on all the Coast but the greatest quantity of what is exported from hence is either brought down this River out of the Country or fetched from  Sillabar  or other places bordering on the Sea in small Vessels Pepper grows plenty in other places of this Island as at  Indrapore Pangasanam Jamby Bancalis  c It grows also on the Island  Java  on the Coast of  Malacca Malabar Cochinchina  c The Coast of  Malabar  is said to produce the best or at least there the Natives take most care to have the best by letting it grow till it is full ripe for which reason it is larger and fairer than here where they gather it too soon to avoid losing any for as soon as it grows ripe 'tis apt to shed and fall in waste to the ground  It was the Pepper Trade that drew our  English  Merchants to settle here For after  Bantam  was lost our  English  who were wont to trade thither for this spice were at a great loss to regain the Pepper Trade which now was in a manner fallen with the other sorts of Spice into the hands of the  Dutch  tho' the Pepper which we were wont to fetch from  Bantam  did not all grow on this Island  Java  nor perhaps the tenth part of it for as I have been informed it came most from  Sumatra  particularly from  Bencooly  and the adjacent parts For this Reason it behoved our Merchants to get an Interest here to prop up their declining Trade Yet as I have been told the success was more owing to the Natives of this place than themselves for that some of the  Raja  's of the Country sent Ambassadors to  Fort St George  to invite the  English  hither to take possession before the  Dutch  should get it who are never slack to promote their Interest and were now setting out on the same design But however that were the  English  had the good fortune to get hither first  though so narrowly that the  Dutch  were within an ace of preventing them their Ships being in sight before our Men got ashore But the  Dutch  coming thus too late were put by their designs for the  English  immediately got ashore some Guns and stood ready to defend their interest This might happen about the Year as I was informed for they told me it was or years before I came hither and the  English  immediately fortified themselves The Fort as I said before fronts to the Sea and stands about paces from the River There has been a great deal of cost bestowed on it but to little purpose for 'tis the most irregular piece I ever saw I told the Governor the best way was to new model it and face it with Stone or Brick either of which might be easily had He said he liked my Counsel but being saving for the Company he rather chose to repair it by the making some Alterations but still to as little purpose for 'twas all made ground and having no facing to keep it up 'twould moulder away every wet season and the Guns often fall down into the Ditches What was possible to be done I endeavoured to do while I was there I made the Bastions as regular as I could upon the Model they were made by and whereas the Fort was designed to be a  Pentagone  and there were but of the Bastions made I staked out ground for a th and drew a plan of it which I gave the Government and had I staid longer I should have made up the other Bastion but the whole Plan is too big by half for so sorry a Garison and the best way of mending it is to demolish all of it and make a new one  The Fort was but sorrily governed when I was there nor was there that care taken to keep a fair Correspondence with the Natives in the Neighbourhood as I think ought to be in all Trading places especially When I came thither there were Neighbouring  Raja  's in the Stocks for no other reason but  because they had not brought down to the Fort such a quantity of Pepper as the Governor had sent for Yet these  Raja  's rule in the Country and have a considerable number of Subjects Who were so exasperated at these Insolencies that as I have since been informed they came down and assanlted the Fort under the Conduct of one of these  Raja  's But the Fort as bad as it is is Guard enough against such indifferent Soldiers as they are Who tho' they have Courage enough yet scarce any Arms besides Backswords Cressets and Lances nor skill to use Artillery if they had it At another Time they made an Attempt to surprize the Fort under pretence of a Cock match to which they hoped the Garrison would come out to share in the Sport and so the Fort left with small Defence For the  Malayans  here are great lovers of Cockfighting and there were about of them got together about this Match while their armed Men lay in ambush But it so  that none of the Garrison went out to the Cock match but one  John Necklin  a  Dane  who was a great Gamester himself And he discovering the Ambush gave notice of it to the Governor who was in Disorder enough upon their Approach But a few of the great Guns drove them away  I have nothing more to add but what concerns my self which is not so material that I should need to trouble the Reader with it I have said in my former Volume  p  upon what Motives I left  Bencouli  And the particulars of my Voyage thence to  England  are also in that Volume So that I may here conclude this Supplement

self of that Promise and because my  Campeachy Voyages  were in order of time before that  Round the World  I shall upon this occasion go so far back as to speak briefly of my first going to  Sea  and the Rambles I made till my setting out for  Campeachy  My Friends did not originally design me for the  Sea  but bred me at  School  till I came to Years fit for a Trade But upon the Death of my Father and Mother they who had the disposal of me took other Measures and having removed me from the  Latine School  to learn  Writing  and  Arithmetick  they soon after plac'd me with a Master of a Ship at  Weymouth  complying with the Inclinations I had very early of seeing the  World  With him I made a short Voyage to  France  and returning thence went to  Newfoundland  being then about eighteen Years of Age In this Voyage I spent one  Summer  but so pinched with the rigour of that cold Climate that upon my return I was absolutely against going to those parts of the  World  but went home again to my Friends Yet going up a while after to  London  the offer of a  warm Voyage  and a  long  one both which I always desired soon carried me to Sea again For hearing of an outwardbound  EastIndia  Man the  John  and  Martha  of  London  Capt  Earning  Commander I entered my self aboard and was employed before the Mast for which my two former  Voyages  had some way qualified me We went directly for  Bantam  in the Isle of  Java  and staying there about two Months came home again in little more than a year touching at St  Jago  of the  Cape Verd  Islands at our going out and at  Ascension  in our return In this  Voyage  I gain'd more experience in Navigation but kept no Journal We arrived at  Plymouth  about two Months before  Sir Robert Holms  went out to fall upon the  Dutch Smyrna  Fleet and the second  Dutch  Wars breaking out upon this I forbore going to Sea that Summer retiring to my Brother in  Somersetshire  But growing weary of staying ashore I lifted my self on board the  Royal Prince  Commanded by Sir  Edward Sprague  and served under him in the Year being the last of the  Dutch War  We had three Engagements that  Summer  I was in two of them but falling very sick I was put aboard an Hospital Ship a day or two before the third Engagement seeing it at a distance only and in this Sir  Edward Sprague  was kill'd Soon after I was sent to  Harwich  with  the rest of the  Sick  and  Wounded  And having languished a great while I went home to my Brother to recover my health  By this time the War with the  Dutch  was concluded and with my health I recovered my old Inclination for the Sea A Neighbouring Gentleman Colonel  Hellier  of  EastCoker  in  Somersetshire  my Native Parish made me a seasonable offer to go and manage a Plantation of his in  Jamaica  under one Mr  Whalley  for which place I set out with Capt  Kent  in the  Content  of  London  I was then about Years old and had never been in the  WestIndies  and therefore lest I might be trapann'd and sold as a  Servant  after my arrival in  Jamaica  I agreed with Capt  Kent  to work as a Seaman for my Passage and had it under his hand to be cleared at our first arrival We sailed out of the River  Thames  in the beginning of the Year and meeting with favourable Winds in a short time got into the Tradewind and went merrily along steering for the Island  Barbadoes  When we came in sight of it Captain  Kent  told his Passengers if they would pay his PortCharges he would anchor in the Road and stop whilst they got refreshment But the Merchants not caring to part with their Money he bore away directing his Course towards  Jamaica  The next Island that appeared in our view was St  Lucia  'Tis distant from  Barbadoes  about Leagues and very wealthy in large Timber Trees fit for all uses For this reason 'tis often visited by the  English  who stock themselves here with Rollers c They have endeavoured to settle an  English Colony  there but hitherto unsuccessfully because of the  CaribbeIndians  The  Caribbees  are a sort of Warlike  Indians  delighting to  ove on the Sea in Periagoes or large Canoas Their chiefest Habitations are on the Main  but at certain Seasons of the Year they visit the Islands for their Pleasure  Barbadoes  was formerly much frequented by them but since the English settled there they have been forced to abandon it and content themselves in their SeaVoyages or with such Islands only as are not possess'd by the  Europeans  except where they have hopes of conquering as they have done at St  Lucia  Near the Main where these  Indians  live lies  Tabago  which when it was first settled by the  Dutch  was much infested by them These  Indians  as I have heard had formerly Plantations on most of the  CaribbeIslands  and in their  Sea Voyages  did use to remain Weeks or a Month at a time on an Island and then remove to another and so visit most of them before their return to the Main  St  Vincent  is another of these Islands lying near St  Lucia  We passed between them and seeing a smoke on St  Lucia  we sent our Boat ashore there Our men found some of the  CaribbeIndians  and bought of them Plantains Bonanoes PineApples and SugarCanes and returning aboard again there came with them a Canoa with or of the  Indians  These often repeated the word  Captain Warner  and seemed to be in some disquiet about him We did not then understand the meaning of it but since I have been informed that this Captain  Warner  whom they mentioned was born at  Antego  one of our English Islands and the Son of Governour  Warner  by an  Indian Women  and bred up by his Father after the  English  manner he learned the  Indian  Language also of his Mother but being grown up and finding himself despised by his  English  Kindred he forsook his Fathers House got away to St  Lucia  and their lived among  he  CaribbeIndians  his Relations by the Mother  side Where conforming himself to their Customs he became one of their Captains and roved from one Island to another as they did About this time the  Caribbees  had done some spoil on our  English  Plantations at  Antego  and therefore Governour  Warner  's Son by his Wife took a Party of Men and went to suppress those  Indians  and came to the Place where his Brother the  IndianWarner  lived Great seeming Joy there was at their Meeting but how far it was real the Event shewed for the  English Warner  providing plenty of Liquor and inviting his half Brother to be merry with him in the midst of his Entertainment ordered his Men upon a signal given to murder him and all his  Indians  which was accordingly performed The Reason of this inhumane Action is diversly reported some say that this  Indian Warner  committed all the spoil that was done to the  English  and therefore for that Reason his Brother kill'd him and his Men Others that he was a great Friend to the  English  and would not suffer his Men to hurt them but did all that lay in his power to draw them to an amicable Commerce and that his Brother kill'd him for that he was ashamed to be Related to an  Indian  But be it how it will he was call'd in question for the Murder and forced to come home to take his Tryal in  England  Such perfidious Doings as these beside the Baseness of them are great hindrances of our gaining an Interest among the  Indians  Putting from these Islands we steered away further  West  and falling in with the East end of  Hispaniola  we ranged down along on the South side even to  Cape Tihuron  which is the  Westend  of the I sland There we lay by and sent our Boat ashore for Captain  Kent  had been informed that there were great Groves of  OrangeTrees  near this Cape but our Men not finding any he then  concluded there were none But I have been since informed my self by several that have been there that their are enough of them thereabouts From hence we steered away for  Jamaica  where we arrived in a short time bringing with us the first News they had of the Peace with the Dutch  Here according to my Contract I was immediately discharged and the nevt day I went to the  Spanish Town  call'd  Sant' Jago de la Vega  where meeting with Mr  Whalley  we went together to Colonel  Hellier  's Plantation in  MileWalk  In our way thither we past through  Sir Tho Muddiford  's Plantation at the  Angells  where at that time were  Otta  and  Cacao Trees  growing and fording a pretty large River we past by the side of it or Miles up the Stream there being high Mountains on each side The way to  MileWalk  was formerly a great deal about round a large Mountains till Mr  Cary Hellier  the Colonel's Brother found out this way For being desirous of making out a shorter cut he and some others coasted along the River till they found it run between a Rock that stood up perpendicularly steep on each side and with much difficulty they climbed over it But a Dog that belonged to them finding a hole to creep through the Rock suggested to them that there was a hollow Passage and he clear'd it by blowing up the Rock with Gunpowder till he had made a way through it broad enough for a Horse with a Pack and high enough for a Man to ride through This is called the  Hollow Rock  Some other Places he levell'd and made it an indifferent good Passage  He was a very ingenious Gentleman and doubtless had he lived he might have propagated some advantagious Arts on that Island He was once endeavouring to make  Salt Petre  at the  Angells  but did not bring it to Perfection Whether the  Earth there was not right I know not but probably there may be  Saltpetre Earth  in other Places especially about PassageFort where as I have been informed the Canes will not make good Sugar by Reason of the Saltness of the Soil  I liv'd with Mr  Whalley  at  Milewalk  for almost six Months and then entred my self into the Service of one Captain  Heming  to manage his Plantation at  St Anns  on the North side of the Island and accordingly rode from  St Jago de la Vega  toward  St Anns  This Road has but sorry accommodations for Travellers The first night I lay at a poor Hunters Hut at the foot of  Mount Diabolo  on the  South  side of it where for want of Clothes to cover me in the Night I was very cold when the Landwind sprang up  This Mountain is part of the great Ridge that runs the length of the Island from  East  to  West  to the East 'tis call'd the  Blew Mountain  which is higher than this The next day crossing Mount  Diabolo  I got a hard Lodging at the Foot of it on the North side and the third day after arrived at Captain  Heming  's Plantation  I was clearly out of my Element there and therefore as soon as Captain  Heming  came thither I disingaged my self from him and took my passage on Board a Sloop to  PortRoyal  with one Mr  Statham  who used to trade round the Island and touched there at that time  From  PortRoyal  I sailed with one Mr  Fishook  who traded to the North side of the Island and sometimes round it and by these coasting  Voyages  I came acquainted with all the Ports and Bays about  Jamaica  and with all their Manufactures as also with the Benefit of the Land and Seawinds For our Business was to bring Goods  to or carry them from Planters to  PortRoyal  and we were always entertain'd civilly by them both in their Houses and Plantations having Liberty to walk about and view them They gave us also Plantains Yams Potatoes c to carry aboard with us on which we fed commonly all our Voyage  But after six or seven Months I left that Employ also and shipt my self aboard one Capt  Hudsel  who was bound to the Bay of  Campeachy  to load  Logwood  We sailed from  PortRoyal  about the beginning of  August  in Company with Capt  Wren  in a small  Jamaica  Bark and Capt  Johnson  Commander of a Ketch belonging to  NewEngland  This Voyage is all the way before the Wind and therefore Ships commonly sail it in or Days Neither were we longer in our Passage for we had very fair Weather and touch'd no where till we came to  Trist  Island in the Bay of  Campeachy  which is the only place they go to In our way thither we first sailed by little  Caimanes  leaving it on our Larboard side and  Key Monbrack  which are two small Islands lying South of  Cuba  The next Land we saw was the Isle of  Pines  and steering still Westerly we made  Cape Corientes  and sailing on the South side of  Cuba  till we came to  Cape Antonio  which is the West end of it we stretched over towards the  Peninsula  of  Jucatan  and fell in with  Cape Catoch  which is in the extream part of that Promontory towards the East  The Land trends from this Cape one way South about Leagues till you come to the Island  Cozumel  and from thence it runs S W down into the Bay of  Honduras  About Leagues from  Cape Catoch  between it and  Cozumel  lies a small Island called by the Spaniards  KeyMuger  or  WomensIsland  because 'tis reported that when they went first to settle in these  parts they left their Wives there while they went over on the Main to find some better habitation Tho' now they have no settlement near it whatever they have had formerly  About Leagues from  Cape Catoch  and just against it is a small Island called  LoggerheadKey  probably because it is frequently visited by a sort of Turtle so call'd near this Island we always find a great Ripling which Seamen call the Ripraps This Cape tho' it appears to be part of the Main yet is divided from it by a small Creek scarce wide enough for a Canoa to pass through though by it 'tis made an Island This I have been credibly informed of by some who yet told me that they made a shift to pass it in a Canoa  The Cape is very low Land by the Sea but somewhat higher as you go further from the shore It is all overgrown with Trees of divers sorts especially Logwood and therefore was formerly much frequented by the  Jamaica  Men who came thither in Sloops to load with it till all the Logwoodtrees near the Sea were cut down but now 'tis wholly abandoned because the Carriage of it to the shore repuires more labour than the cutting logging and chipping Besides they find better Wood now in the Bays of  Campeachy  and  Honduras  and have but a little way to carry it not about Paces when I was there whereas at  Cape Catoch  they were forc'd to carry it Paces before they left that Place  From  Cape Catoch  we coasted along by the shore on the North side of  Jucatan  towards  Cape Condecedo  The Coast lies nearest West The distance between these two Capes is about Leagues The shore lies pretty level without any visible Points or Bendings in the Land It is Woody by the shore and full of sandy Bays and lofty Mangroves  The first place of note to the West of  Cape Catoch  is a small Hill by the Sea call'd the  Mount  and  is distant from it about Leagues It is very remarkable because there is is no other HighLand on all this Coast I was never ashore here but have met with some well acquainted with the Place who are all of opinion that this Mount was not natural but the Work of Men And indeed it is very probable this place has been inhabited for here are a great many large Cisterns supposed to have been made for the receiving of Rainwater for there are no fresh Springs to be found here the Soil being all sandy and very salt So that as I have been credibly informed by an intelligent Person the Spaniards do fetch of it to make SaltPetre He also told me that being once there in a Privateer and landing some Men on the Bay they found about Packs of this Earth bound up in Palmeto leaves and a  Spanish Mulatto  to guard it The Privateers at first sight of the Packs were in hopes there had been Maiz or Indian Corn in them which they then wanted but opening them they found nothing but Earth and examining the  Mulatto  for what use it was he said to make Powder and that he expected a Bark from  Compeachy  to fetch it away He further told me that tasting of it he found it very salt as all the Earth thereabouts was So that 'tis not improbable that those Cisterns were made for the carrying on of SaltPetre Work But whatever was the design at first it is now wholly laid aside for there is no use made of them neither are there any Inhabitants near this Place  Between the  Mount  and  Cape Condecedo  close by the Sea are many little Spots of Mangrove Trees which at a distance appear like Islands but coming nearer when other lower Trees appear it shews like ragged and broken Ground but at last all the Land presents it self to your view very even  The next place of note on this Coast is  Rio de la Gartos  almost in the midway between  Cape Cotoch  and  Cape Condecedo  This also is a very remarkable Place for here are Groves of High Mangroves one on each side the River by which it may be known very well The River is but small yet deep enough for Canoas The Water is good and I know not any other Brook of fresh River on all the Coast from  Cape Catoch  till within or Leagues of  Campeachy  Town  A little to the East of this River is a FishRange and a small Indian Hutt or two within the Woods where the Indian Fishers who are subject to the Spaniards lye in the FishingSeasons their Habitations and Families being farther up in the Country Here are Poles to hang their Nets on and Barbecues to dry their Fish When they go off to Sea they fish with Hook and Line about or Leagues from the shore for  Snappers  and  Gropers  which I have already described in my Voyage round the World Chap pag  Since the Privateers and Logwoodships have sailed this way these Fishermen are very shy having been often snapp'd by them So that now when they are out at Sea if they see a Sail they presently sink their Canoas even with the edge of the Water for the Canoas when they are full of Water will sink no lower and they themselves lye just with their heads above Water till the Ship which they saw is pass'd by or comes nigh I have seen them under sail and they have thus vanished on a sudden The Fish which they take near the Shore with their Nets are  Snooks DogFish  and sometimes  Tarpoms  The  Tarpom  is a large scaly Fish shaped much like a Salmon but somewhat flatter 'Tis of a dull Silver Colour with Scales as big as a Half Crown A large  Tarpom  will weight or Pound 'Tis good sweet wholsome Meat and the Flesh solid and firm  In its belly you shall find two large Scalops of Fat weighing two or three Pound each I never knew any taken with Hook and Line but are either with Nets or by striking them with Harpoons at which the  Moskito  Men are very expert The Nets for this purpose are made with strong double Twine the Meshes or Inches square For if they are too small so that the Fish be not intangled therein he presently draws himself a little backward and then springs over the Net Yet I have seen them taken in a Sain made with small Meshes in this manner After we have inclosed a great number whilst the two ends of the Net were drawing ashore or naked Men have followed and when a Fish struck against the Net the next Man to it grasped both Net and Fish in his Arms and held all fast till others came to his assistance Besides these we had three Men in a Canoa in which they mov'd sideways after the Net and many of the Fish in springing over the Net would fall into the Canoa And by these means we should take two or three at every draught These Fish are found plentifully all along that shore from  Cape Catoch  to  Trist  especially in clear Water near sandy Bays but no where in muddy or rocky Ground They are also about  Jamaica  and all the Coast of the Main especially near  Carthagena  West from  Rio de le Gartos  there is a Lookout or Watchtower called  Selam  This is a Place close by the shore contrived by the  Spaniards  for their  Indians  to watch in There are many of them on this Coast Some built from the Ground with Timber others only little Cages placed on a Tree big enough for one or two Men to sit in with a Ladder to go up and down These Watchtowers are never without an  Indian  or two all the day long the  Indians  who live near any of them being obliged to take their turns  About three or four Leagues Westward of  Selam  is another Watchbox on a high Tree called  Linchanchee Lookout  from a large  Indian  Town of that Name Leagues up in the Country and two Leagues farther within Land is another Town called  Chinchanchee  I have been ashore at these  Lookouts  and have been either rowing in a Canoa or walking ashore on all this Coast even from  Rio de la Gartos  to Cape  Condecedo  but did never see any Town by the shore nor any Houses besides Fishinghutts on all the Coast except only at  Sisal  Between  Selam  and  Linchanchee  are many small regular Salt Ponds divided from each other by little Banks the biggest Pond not above yards long and broad  The Inhabitants of these two Towns attend these Ponds in the Months of  May June  and  July  to gather the Salt which supplies all the Inland Towns of these Parts and there is a skirt of Wood between the Sea and the Ponds that you can neither see them nor the People at work till you come ashore  From these Salt Ponds further West about three or four Leagues is the  Lookout  called  Sisal  This is the highest and most remarkable on all the Coast it stands close by the Sea and it is built with Timber This is the first Object that we make off at Sea and sometimes we take it for a Sail till running nearer we discover the High Mangrovetrees appearing in small Tufts at several distances from it  Not far from hence there is a Fort with or Soldiers to Guard the Coast and from this place there is a Road through the Country to the City of  Merida  This is the chiefest City in all the Province of  Jucatan  it being inhabited mostly with Spaniards Yet there are many Indian Families among them who live in great subjection as do the rest of the  Indians  of this Country The Province of  Jucatan  especially this Northern and the most Easterly part of it is but indifferently fruitful in comparison of that rich Soil farther to the West Yet is it pretty populous of  Indians  who all live together in Towns but none within five or six Miles of the Sea except as I said at or Fishing places and even there the  Indians  resort to fish but at certain Seasons of the Year Therefore when Privateers come on this Coast they fear not to land and ramble about as if they were in their own Country seeking for Game of any sort either Fowl or Deer of both which there are great plenty especially of the latter though sometimes they pay dear for it A small  Jamaica  Privateer once landed or Men at this  Lookout  of  Sisal  who not suspecting any danger ordered the Canoa with or Men to row along by the shore to take them in upon their giving a sign or firing a Gun But within half an hour they were attack'd by about  Spanish  Soldiers who had cut them off from the shore to whom they surrendered themselves Prisoners The Spaniards carried them in triumph to the Fort and then demanded which was the Captain Upon this they all stood mute for the Captain was not among them and they were afraid to tell the Spaniards so for fear of being all hanged for Straglers Neither did any one of them dare to assume that Title because they had no Commission with them nor the Copy of it for the Captains don't usually go ashore without a Copy at least of their Commission which is wont to secure both themselves and their MenAt last one  John Hullock  cock'd up his little crop  Hat and told them that he was the Captain and the Spaniards demanding his Commission he said it was aboard for that he came ashore only to hunt not thinking to have met any Enemy The  Spaniards  were well satisfied with this Answer and afterwards respected him as the Captain and served him with  better Provision and Lodging than the rest and the next day when they were sent to the City of  Merida  about or Leagues from thence Captain  Hullock  had a Horse to ride on while the rest went on Foot And though they were all kept in close Prison yet  Hullock  had the honour to be often sent for to be examined at the Governour's House and was frequently Regal'd with Chocolate c From thence they were carried to  Campeachy  Town where still Captain  Hullock  was better served than his Comrades At last I know not how they all got their Liberties and  Hullock  was ever after called  Captain Jack  It is about Leagues from  Sisal  to  Cape Condecedo  twenty Leagues North of which lies a small Island call'd by the Spaniards  Isles des Arenas  but the  English  Seamen as is usual with them corrupt the Name strangely and some call it the  Desarts  others the  Desarcusses  but of this Island having never seen it I can give no account  All this Coast from  Cape Catoch  to  Cape Condecedo  is low Land the  Mount  only excepted It is most sandy Bay by the Sea yet some of it is Mangrovy Land within which you have some Spots of dry Savannah and small scrubbed Trees with short thick Bushes among them The Sea deepens gradually from the shore and Ships may anchor in sandy Ground in any depth from or Foot to or Fathom Water  In some Places on this Coast we reckon our distance from the shore by the depth of the Sea allowing Fathom for the first League and for every Fathom afterward a League more  But having got thus to  Cape Condecedo  I shall defer the further description of these Parts from this Cape Southward and Westward to the HighLand of St  Martin  which is properly the Bay of  Campeachy  and from thence also further Westward till my second  coming on this Coast when I made so long a stay here To proceed therefore with my present Voyage having past  Cape Catoch  the  Mount Rio de la Gartos Sisal  and  Cape Condecedo  we stood Southward directly for  Trist  the Haven of our LogwoodCutters at which Place being not above Leagues distant we soon arrived  Trist  is the Road only for big Ships Smaller Vessels that draw but a little Water run Leagues farther by crossing over a great Lagune that runs from the Island up into the MainLand where they anchor at a place called  OneBushKey  We stayed at  Trist  days to fill our Water and then with our Consorts sailed thence with the Tide of Flood and the same Tide arrived there This  Key  is not above Paces long and or broad having only a little crooked Tree growing on it and for that reason it is called  OneBushKey  It seems to be only a heap of Shells for the Island is covered with them The greatest part are Oystershells There are a great many Oystersbanks in this Lagune and the adjacent Creeks but none afford better either for largeness or taste than the Bank about this Island In the wet Season the Oysters as well of  OneBushKey  as other Places here are made fresh by the Freshes running out of the Country But in the dry time they are salt enough In the Creeks they are smaller but more numerous and the MangroveRoots that grow by the sides of the Creeks are loaden with them and so are all the Branches that hang in the Water  OneBushKey  is about a Mile from the shore and just against the Island is a small Creek that runs a Mile farther and then opens into another wide Lagune and through this Creek the Logwood is brought to the Ships riding at the  Key  Between the OysterBanks that lye about the Island and the Main there is good Riding in about Foot Water  The bottom is very soft Oaz insomuch that we are forced to shooe our Anchors to make them hold The Main by it is all low MangrovyLand which is overflow'd every Tide and in the Wet Season is covered with Water Here we lay to take in our Lading  Our Cargo to purchase Logwood was Rum and Sugar a very good Commodity for the Logwoodcutters who were then about Men most  English  that had settled themselves in several Places hereabouts Neither was it long before we had these Merchants came aboard to visit us we were but Men and a Boy in the Ship and all little enough to entertain them for besides what Rum we sold by the Gallon or Firkin we sold it made into Punch wherewith they grew Frolicksome We had none but small Arms to fire at their drinking Healths and therefore the noise was not very great at a distance but on Board the Vessels we were loud enough till all our Liquor was spent We took no Money for it nor expected any for Logwood was what we came hither for and we had of that in lieu of our Commodities after the rate of Pound  per  Tun to be paid at the Place where they cut it and we went with our Longboat to fetch small Quantities But because it would have taken up a long time to load our Vessel with our own Boat only we hired a Periago of the LogwoodCutters to bring it on Board and by that means made the quicker dispatch I made two or three Trips to their Huts where I and those with me were always very kindly entertain'd with Pig and Pork and Pease or Beef and DoughBoys Their Beef they got by hunting in the  Savannahs  As long as the Liquor lasted which they bought of us we were treated with it either in Drams or Punch But for a more particular account of the LogwoodCutters I shall refer the Reader to my second Voyage hither  which I made shortly after my return to  Jamaica  because I saw a great prospect of getting Money here if Men would be but diligent and frugal  But let's proceed with our Voyage It was the latter end of  September  when we sailed from  OneBushKey  with the Tide of Ebb and anchored again at  Trist  that same Tide where we watered our Vessel in order to sail This we accomplished in two Days and the third day sailed from  Trist  toward  Jamaica  A Voyage which proved very tedious and hazardous to us by reason of our Ships being so sluggish a Sailor that She would not ply to Windward whereby we were necessarily driven upon several Shoals that otherwise we might have avoided and forced to spend Weeks in our Passage which is usually accomplished in half that time  We had now a Passenger with us one  Will Wooders  a  Jamaica  Seamen that with three others that were taken by the  Spaniards  was sent to the City of  Mexico  where they remained Prisoners six or eight Months but at last wereremanded to  La Vera Cruz  and from thence by Sea to  Campeachy  They were not imprisoned but only kept to work on Board the Ship that brought them and soon found an opportunity to make their escapes in this manner They had been imployed ashore all the day and being sent aboard at Night they fell to contrive how to run away with the Boat but considering that they wanted necessaries for their Voyage they resolved first to go back and supply themselves which they might then do the better because they knew there were none but a few  Indians  on Board Accordingly having seiz'd and bound the  Indians  taking with them a Compass with some Bread and Water they put off to Sea and arriv'd at  Trist  a Week before our departure And this  Will Wooders  was the means under God of the Preservation of our Ship  The third day after we left  Trist  about in the Morning near or Leagues W S W from  Campeachy  we saw two Sail about Leagues to Windward coming directly towards us the Captain supposing that they had been  Jamaica  Vessels would have lain by to hear some News and to get some Liquor from them for we had now none on Board but a few Bottles in a small Case that the Captain reserved for his own Drinking But  Wooders  withstood the Captains Proposal and told him that when he came from  Campeachy  there were two small Vessels ready to sail for  Tobasco  River which is not above or Leagues Leeward of  Trist  and that it was more probable these were those two Vessels than any from  Jamaica  Upon this we edged off more to Sea and they also alter'd their Course steering away still directly with us so that we were now assured they were  Spaniards  and therefore we put away quartering and steering N W and though they still fetch'd on us apace yet to make the more speed they turned a Boat loose that was in a Tow at one of their Sterns and She being a good Sailor came within Gunshot of us when as it pleased God the Landwind dyed away o  a sudden and the Sea Breez did not yet spring up  While the Wind lasted we thought our selves but a degree from Prisoners neither had we yet great hopes of escaping for our Ketch  even when light  was but a dull Sailor worse being deep loaden However we had now time to unbend the Foresail and make a studding Sail of it to put right before the SeaBreez when it should spring up This was accordingly done in a trice and in less than an hour after the Breez sprung up fresh and we put right before the Wind We had this advantage in it that all the Sail we had did us service while on the contrary those who chased us being three  Mast Vessels could not bring all theirs to draw for their Aftersails becalmed their Headsails and we held them tack for two or three Hours neither gaining nor losing Ground At last the Wind freshing on by the coming of a Tornado we gained considerably of them so they fired a Gun and left their Chase but we kept on crouding till Night and then clapp'd on a Wind again and saw no more of them  In about a Fortnight after this we were got as far to the East as  Rio de la Gartos  and there overtook us a small  Barmudoes  Boat belonging to  Jamaica  which had not been above ten days come from  Trist  who sailed much better than we did Therefore our Merchant went on board of Her for he saw we were like to have a long Passage and Provision began to be scarce already which he could not so well brook as we Our Course lay all along against the Tradewind  All the hopes that we had was a good North this being the only time of the Year for it and soon after we saw a black Cloud in the N W which is a sign of a North but of this more in my Discourse of Winds for two days Morning and Evening The third day it rose apace and came away very swiftly We presently provided to receive it by furling all but our Mainsail intending with that to take the advantage of it Yet this did us but little service for after an Hours time in which it blew fresh at N W the Cloud went away and the Wind came about again at E N E the usual trade in these Parts We therefore made use of the Sea and LandBreezes as we had done before and being now as high as the before mentioned  Fishing Banks  on the North of  Jucatan  we so ordered our Business that with the Landwinds we run over to the Banks and while it was calm between the Landwinds and SeaBreez we put out our Hooks and Lines and  fished and got plenty every Morning One time our Captain after he had haled in a good Fish being eager at his sport and throwing out his Line too hastily the Hook hitched in the Palm of his Hand and the weight off the Lead that was thrown with a jerk and hung about six Foot from the Hook forced the beard quite through that it appeared at the back of his Hand  Soon after this we got as high as the Mount and then stood off about Leagues from Land in hopes to get better to Windward there than near the shore because the Wind was at E S E and S E by E a fresh gale continuing so or days We steered off to the North expecting a SeaBreez at E N E and the third day had our desire Then we tack'd and steered in again S E for the shore of  Jucatan  Our Ketch as I said was a heavy Sailer especially on a Wind for she was very short and having great round Bows when we met a HeadSea as now she plunged and laboured not going ahead but tumbling like an Eggshell in the Sea It was my fortune to be at the Helm from a Clock in the Evening till The first Glasses she steered very ill for every Sea would strike her dead like a Log then she would fall off or Points from the Wind though the Helm was a Lee and as she recovered and made a little way she would come again to the Wind till another Sea struck her off again By that time Glasses were out the Sea became more smooth and then she steered very well and made pretty fresh way through the Water I was somewhat surprized at the sudden Change from a rough Sea to a smooth and therefore looked overboard or times for she steered open on the Deck and it being very fair Weather all our Men were layn down on the Deck and fallen asleep My Captain was just behind me on the Quarter Deck fast asleep too for neither he nor they dreaded any Danger we being  about Leagues from the MainLand at Noon and as we thought not near any Island  But while I was musing on the sudden alteration of the Sea our Vessel struck on a Rock with such force that the Whipstaff threw me down on my back This frighted me so much that I cryed out and bad them all turn out for the Ship struck The surge that the Ship made on the Rock avvakened most of our Men and made them ask What the matter vvas But her striking a second time soon ansvvered the Question and set us all to vvork for our Lives By good fortune she did not stick but kept on her way still and to our great comfort the water was very smooth otherwise we must certainly have been lost for we very plainly savv the Ground under us so we let go our Anchor in fathom Water clean White Sand When our Sails vvere furled and a sufficient scope of Cable veered out our Captain being yet in amaze vvent into his Cabin and most of us with him to vievv his draught and we soon found vve were fallen foul of the  Alcranes  The  Alcranes  are or low sandy Islands lying in the Lat of about d North and distant from the Coast of  Jucatan  about Leagues the biggest is not above a Mile or two in Circuit They are distant from one another or Miles not lying in a Line but scattering here and there with good Channels of or Fathom Water for a Ship to pass between All of them have good Anchoring on the West sides where you may ride in what depths you please from to Fathom Water clean sandy Ground On some there are a fevv lovv Bushes of Burtonvvood but they are mostly Barren and Sandy bearing nothing but only a little ChickenWeed neither have they any fresh Water Their LandAnimals are only large Rats vvhich are in great Plenty and of Fovvls Boobies in vastabundance vvith Men of War and EggBirds These inhabit  only some of the Northermost of them not promiscuously one among another but each sort within their own Precincts  viz  the Boobies and the other two sorts each apart by themselves and thus two or three of the Islands are wholly taken up The Boobies being most numerous have the greatest portion of Land The EggBirds tho' they are many yet being but small take up but little room to the rest Yet in that little part which they inhabit they are sole Masters and not disturbed by their Neighbours All three sorts are very tame especially the Boobies and so thick settled that a Man cannot pass through their Quarters without coming within reach of their Bills with which they continually peckt at us I took notice that they sat in Pairs and therefore at first thought them to be Cock and Hen but upon striking at them one flew away from each place and that which was left behind seemed as malicious as the other that was gone I admired at the boldness of those that did not fly away and used some sort of violence to force them but in vain for indeed these were young Ones and had not yet learned the use of their Wings tho' they were as big and as well feathered as their Dams only their Feathers were something whiter and fresher I took notice that an old one either the Cock or Hen always sat with the young to secure them for otherwise these fowls would prey on each other the strong on the weak at least those of a different Kind would make bold with their Neighbours the MenofWarBirds as well as the Boobies left Guardians to the Young when they went off to Sea lest they should be starved by their Neighbours for there were a great many old and lame MenofWarBirds that could not fly off to Sea to seek their own Food These did not inhabit among their Consorts but were either expelled the Community or else chose to lye out at some distance  from the rest and that not altogether but scattering here and there where they could rob securest I saw near of them on one of the Islands which sometimes would sally into the Camp to seek for Booty but presently retreated again whether they got any thing or nothing If one of these lame Birds found a young Booby not guarded it presently gave him a good poult on the back with his Bill to make him disgorge which they will do with one stroak and it may be cast up a Fish or two as big as a Mans Wrist this they swallow in a trice and march off and look out for another Prize The sound MenofWar will sometimes serve the old Boobies so off at Sea I have seen a ManofWar fly directly at a Booby and give it one blow which has caused it to cast up a large Fish and the ManofWar flying directly down after it has taken it in the Air before it reach'd the Water  There are abundance of Fish at some distance from these Islands by which the Fowls inhabiting here are daily supplied  The Fish near the Island are Sharks SwordFishes and Nurses all three sorts delighting to be near sandy Bays those that I saw here were but of a small size the SwordFish not above a Foot and a half or two Foot long neither were the Sharks much longer and the Nurses about the same length The Nurse is just like a Shark only its Skin is rougher and his used for making the finest Rasps Here are many Seals they come up to sun themselves only on two or three of the Islands I don't know whether exactly of the same kind with those in colder Climates but as I have noted in my former Book they always live where there is plenty of Fish  To the North of these Islands lyes a long ledge of Rocks bending like a Bow it seems to be or Yards wide and about Leagues long and Leagues distant from the Island They are above Water  all joyning very close to one another except at one or two Places where are small Passages about nine or ten Yards wide 'twas through one of these that Providence directed us in the Night for the next Morning we saw the Riffabout half a Mile to the North of us and right against us was a small Gap by which we came in hither but coming to view it more nearly with our Boat we did not dare to venture out that way again One Reason why we would have gone out to the Northward was because from our Maintop we saw the Islands to the Southward of us and being unacquainted knew not whether we might find among them a Channel to pass through our second reason was the hopes of making a better slant in for the shore if we could weather the East end of the Riff In order to this we weighed Anchor keeping down by the side of the Riff till we were at the West end of it which was about a League from where we Anchored then we stood off to the North and there kept plying off and on to weather the East end of the Riff three Days but not being able to effect it by reason of a strong Current setting to the N W we ran back again to the West end of the Riff and steered away for the Islands There we Anchored and lay three or four days and visited most of them and found plenty of such Creatures as I have already described  Though here was great store of such good Food and we like to want yet we did neither salt any nor spend of it fresh to save our Stock I found them all but one Man averse to it but I did heartily wish them of another mind because I dreaded wanting before the end of the Voyage a hazard which we needed not to run there being here such plenty of Fowls and Seals especially of the later that the Spaniards do often come hither to make Oyl of their Fat upon which account it has been visited by Englishmen  from  Jamaica  particularly by Capt  Long  who having the Command of a small Bark came hither purposely to make SealOyl and anchored on the North side of one of the sandy Islands the most convenient Place for his designHaving got ashore his Cask to put his Oyl in and set up a Tent for lodging himself and his Goods he began to kill the Seal and had not wrought above three or four days before a fierce Northwind blew his Bark ashore By good fortune she was not damnified but his Company being but small and so despairing of setting her afloat again they fell to contriving how to get away a very difficult task to accomplish for it was or Leagues to the nearest Place of the Main and above Leagues to  Trist  which was the next English Settlement But contrary to their expectation instead of that Capt  Long  bid them follow their Work of Sealkilling and making Oyl assuring them that he would undertake at his own peril to carry them safe to  Trist  This though it went much against the grain yet at last he so far prevailled by fair Words that they were contented to go on with their Sealkilling till they had filled all their Cask But their greatest work was yet to do  viz  how they should get over to the Main and then coast down before the Wind to  Trist  Their Boat was not big enough to transport them so they concluded to cut down the Barks Masts and rip up her Deck to make a Float for that purpose  This being agreed on the next Morning betimes pursuant to their Resolution they were going to break up their Vessel but it happned that very Night that two  NewEngland  Ketches going down to  Trist  ran on the backside of the Riff where they struck on the Rocks and were bulged and Captain  Long  and his Crew seeing them in distress presently took their Boat and went off to help them unlade their Goods and bring them ashore and  in requital they furnished the Captain with such tackle and other necessaries as he wanted and assisted him in the launching his Vessel and lading his Oyl and so they went merrily away for  Trist  This lucky accident was much talked of amongst the Captain's Crew and so exasperated the  NewEngland  Men when they heard the whole story that they were thinking if the Commanders would have suffered them to have thrown him into the Sea to prevent his doing more mischief For they were sure that he by his Art had caused them to run aground The whole of this Relation I had from Captain  Long  himself  From the main to these Islands the Sea deepens gradually till you come to about Fathom Water and when you are or Leagues off shore to the Eastward of them if you steer away West keeping in that Depth you cannot miss them The same Rule is to be observed to find any other Island as the  Triangles  the Isles  Des Arenas  c for the Bank runs all along the shore on which are Soundings of equal Depth and the Sea appears of a muddy palish Colour but when past the Bank on the North side of it it resumes its natural greenness and is too deep for any Sounding till you are within Leagues of the North side of the Bay of  Mexico  where by relation there is such another Bank abounding with Oysters running all along the shore But to return to our Voyage  Having spent or Days among the  Alcranes  Islands we set sail again and steering in Southerly for the Main having the Wind at E N E we fell in with it a little to Leeward of Cape  Catoch  plying under the shore till we reach'd the Cape from thence we continued our Course Northerly the Wind at E by S The next Land we designed for was  Cape Antonio  which is the Westermost Point  of the Island  Cuba  and distant from Cape  Catoch  about Leagues  Some when they sail out of the Bay keep along by the Land of  Jucatan  till they come as far as the Island  Cozumel  and from thence stretch over towards  Cuba  and if the Wind favours them any thing they will get as high as Cape  Corientes  before they fall in with  Cuba  for in their Passage from thence they are not in so much danger of being hurried away to the North by the Current between the two Capes or to the North of them as we were For taking our Course Northward till the Latitude of d m we tack'd again and the Wind at E steered away S S E hours and having taken an Observation of the Sun as we did the Day before found our selves in d being driven backwards in hours Miles We had then the Channel open between the two Capes but to the North of either Yet at last we got over to the  Cuba  shore and fell in with the North of the Island about or Leagues from Cape  Antonio  Now we both saw and ran thro' some of the  Colorado  Sholes but found a very good Channel among a great many Rocks that appear'd above Water Being thus got within the Sholes between them and  Cuba  we found a pretty wide clear Channel and good Anchoring and advancing further within a League of the Cape we Anchored and went ashore to get Water but found none In the Evening when the Landwind sprung up we weighed again and doubling the Cape coasted along on the Southside of the Island taking the Advantages both of Sea and Landwinds For though we had now been about two Months from  Trist  and this the time of the Year for Norths yet to our great trouble they had hitherto failed us and besides as I said before our Ketch was such a Leewardly Vessel that we did not yet expect we could possibly reach  Jamaica  meerly by turning  though sometimes assisted by Sea and LandWinds In about a Week after this we got up with and coasted along the Isle of  Pines  for or Leagues and then stood off to Sea and the third Morning fell in with the West end of Grand  Caymanes  This Island is about leagues South from  Pines  and about to the West of little  Caymanes  We anchored at the West end about half a mile from the shore We found no Water nor any Provision but saw many Crocodiles on the Bay some of which would scarce stir out of the way for us We kill'd none of them vvhich vve might easily have done though Food began to be short vvith us indeed had it been in the Months of  June  or  July  vve might probably have gotten Turtle for they frequent this Island some Years as much as they do little  Caymanes  We stayed here but or Hours and steered back for  Pines  intending there to hunt for Beef or Hog of both vvhich there is in great plenty The second day in the morning vve fell in vvith the Westend of  Pines  and running about or miles Northvvard vve anchored in fathom Water clean Sand about mile from the shore and right against a small Creek through the Mangroves into a vvide Lagune  The Isles of  Pines  lies on the Southside tovvards the Westend of  Cuba  and is distant from it or Leagues Cape  Corientes  on  Cuba  is five or six Leagues to the Westward of the Isle of  Pines  Between  Pines  and  Cuba  are many small woody Islands scattered here and there with Channels for Ships to pass between and by report there is good anchoring near any of them  Jamaica  Sloops do sometimes pass through between  Cuba  and  Pines  when they are bound to Windward because there the Sea is always smooth They are also certain to meet good Landwinds besides they can anchor  when they please and thereby take the benefit of the Tides and when they are got past the Eastend of  Pines  they may either stand out to Sea again or if they are acquainted among the small Islands to the East of it which are called the  South Keys  of  Cuba  they may range amongst them to the Eastward still taking the greater benefit of the Landwinds and Anchoring besides if Provision is scarce they will meet  Jamaica  Turtlers or else may get Turtle themselves at which many of them are expert There is also plenty of Fish of many sorts but if they are not provided with Hooks Lines or Harpoons or any other FishingCraft nor meet with any Turtlers  Cuba  will afford them Sustenance of Hog or Beef The great inconvenience of going in the inside of  Pines  between it and  Cuba  proceeds from a  Spanish  Garrison of about Soldiers at Cape  Corientes  who have a large Periago well fitted with Oars and Sails and are ready to launch out and seize any small Vessel and seldom spare the Lives as well as the Goods of those that fall into their Hands for fear of telling Tales Such Villanies are frequently practised not only here but also in several other places of the  WestIndies  and that too with such as come to Trade with their Countrymen The Merchants and Gentry indeed are no way guilty of such Actions only the Soldiers and Rascality of the People and these do commonly consist of Mulatoes or some other sort of Coppercolour'd Indians who are accounted very Barbarous and Cruel  The Isle of  Pines  is about or Leagues long and or broad The West end of it is low MangrovyLand and within which is a Lagune of about or Miles wide running to the Eastward but how far I know not with a small Creek of or Foot Water reaching to the Sea The Lagune it self is so shallow especially near the Island that  you cannot bring a Canoa within or Paces of the shore The South side of the Island is low flat and rocky the Rocks are perpendicularly steep towards the Sea so that there is no Anchoring on that side but the Westend very good in sandy Ground The Body of the Island is high Land with many little Hills incompassing a high Pike or Mountain standing in the middle The Trees that grow here are of divers sorts most of them unknown to me Red Mangroves grow in the low swampy Land against the Sea but on the firm hilly part PineTrees are most plentiful Of these here are great Groves of a good height and bigness streight and large enough to make Topmasts or standing Masts for small Vessels at the West end there is a pretty big River of fresh Water but no coming at it near the Sea for red Mangroves which grow so thick on both sides of it that there is no getting in among them  The LandAnimals are Bullocks Hogs Deer c Here are small Savannahs for the Bullocks and Deer to feed in as well as Fruit in the Woods for the Hogs Here are also a sort of Racoons or Indian Conies and in some places plenty of LandTurtle and LandCrabs of two sorts white and black Both of them make holes in the Ground like Conies where they shelter themselves all day and in the Night come out to feed they will eat Grass Herbs or such Fruit as they find under the Trees The Manchaniel Fruit which neither Bird nor Beast will taste is greedily devoured by them without doing them any harm Yet these very Crabs that feed on Manchaniel are venemous both to Man and Beast that feeds on them though the others are very good Meat the white Crabs are the largest sort some of them are as big as a Mans two Fists joyned together they are shaped like SeaCrabs having one large Claw wherewith they will pinch very  hard neither will they let go their hold though you bruise them in pieces unless you break the Claw too but if they chance to catch your Fingers the way is to lay your Hand Crab and all flat on the Ground and he will immediately loose his hold and scamper away These whiteones built in wet swampy dirty Ground near the Sea so that the Tide washes in their Holes but the black Crab is more cleanly delighting to live in dry Places and makes its House in sandy Earth black Crabs are commonly fat and full of Eggs they are also accounted the better Meat tho' both sorts are very good  Here are also a great many Alligators and Crocodiles that haunt about this Island and are said to be the most daring in all the  WestIndies  I have heard of many of their Tricks as that they have followed a Canoa and put their Noses in over the Gunnal with their Jaws wide open as if ready to devour the Men in it and that when they have been ashore in the Night near the Sea the Crocodiles have boldly come in among them and made them run from their Fire and taken avvay their Meat from them Therefore when Privateers are hunting on this Island they always keep Sentinels out to vvatch for these ravenous Creatures as duly as they do in other Places for fear of Enemies especially in the Night for fear of being devoured in their sleep  The Spaniards of  Cuba  have here some Craules  i e  Herds of Hogs with a few Indians or Mulatoes to look after them Here are also Hunters that gain a livelihood by killing wild Hog and Beef  This Island is reported to be very wet I have heard many say that it rains here more or less every day in the Year but this I suppose is a mistake for there fell no rain about us so long as we stayed  here neither did I see any appearance of it in other Places of the Island  We were no sooner at an Anchor but five of us went ashore leaving only the Cook and CabbinBoy aboard We had but two bad fowling Pieces in the Ship those we took with us with a design to kill Beef and Hog We went into the Lagune where we found Water enough for our Canoa and in some Places not much to spare when we were got almost over it we saw or Bulls and Cows feeding on the shore close by the Sea This gave us great Hopes of good success We therefore rowed away aside of the Cattle and landed on a sandy Bay about half a mile from them there we saw much footing of Men and Boys the Impressions seemed to be about or days old we supposed them to be the Track of Spanish Hunters This troubled us a little but it being now their  Christmas  we concluded that they were gone over to  Cuba  to keep it there so we went after our Game the Boatswain and our Passenger  Will Wooders  having one Gun and persuming on their skill in shooting were permitted to try their fortune with the Cattle that we saw before we landed while the Captain and my selfwith our own Gun struck up directly into the Woods The fifth Man whose genius led him rather to fish than hunt stayed in the Canoa and had he been furnished with a Harpoon he might have gotten more Fish than we did Flesh for the Cattle smelling our two Men before they came nigh them ran away after that our Men rambled up into the Country to seek for some other Game  The Captain and I had not gone half a Mile before we came among a Drove of near great and small wild Hogs The Captain firing wounded one of them but they all ran away and though we followed the Blood a good way yet did not come up with him nor with any other to get a second shot  however because there was such a great track of Hogs in the Woods we kept beating about being still in hopes to meet with more Game before Night but to no purpose for we saw not one more that Day In the Evening we returned to our Boat weary and vext at our ill success The Boatswain and his Consort were not yet returned therefore we stayed till 'twas dark and then went aboard without them the next Morning betimes we went ashore again as well to try our fortune at Hunting as to recover our two Men which we thought might now be returned to the place where they landed but not seeing them the Captain and I went again out to Hunt but came back at Night with no better success than before neither did we see one Beef or Hog though much track all the day This day he that look'd to the Boat kill'd a young Swordfish with the Boathook there were a great many of them as also Nurses and Dogfish playing in shole Water he had also discover'd a stream of Fresh Water but so inclosed with thick red Mangroves that 'twas impossible to fill any in Cask we could scarce get a little to drink Our two Men that went out the day before were not yet returned therefore when 'twas dark we went aboard again being much perplex'd for fear of their falling into the hands of the Spanish Hunters if we had been certain of it we would have sail'd presently for we could not expect to redeem them again but might have been taken our selves either by them or by the Cape Soldiers before mentioned Indeed these thoughts about their danger and our own kept me waking all Night However the next Morning betimes we went ashore again and before we got into the Lagune we heard a Gun fired by which we knew that our Men were arrived so we fired another in answer and rowed away as fast as we could to fetch them designing to fail as soon as we came aboard for by the flattering South and S W  Winds together with the Clearness of the Sky we supposed we should have a North the Land intercepted our prospect near the Horizon in the N W therefore we did not see the black Cloud there which is a sure Prognostick of a North when we came ashore we found our two Men They kill'd a Hog the first day but losing their way were forced to march like Tigres all the next Day to get to us and threw away most of their Meat to lighten themselves yet 'twas Night before they got to the side of the Lagune and then being or Miles still from us they made a fire and roasted their Meat and having fill'd their Bellies lay down to sleep yet had still a small Pittance left for us We presently returned aboard and feasted on the remains of the Roastmeat and being now pretty full got up our Anchor and stood away to the South coasting along by the Island and doubling the S W Point we steered away E S E We had the Wind when we weighed at West a moderate Gale but veering about to the North got at N W By that time we got to the South West Point of  Pines  and it now blew a fierce Gale and held thus two Days and then came to the N N W blowing hard still and from thence to the North then we edged away S E for it blew hard and we could not bring her nearer the Wind From the N it came about to the N N E then we knew than the heart of it was broke however it blew hard still then it came about to the N E and blew about hours and so by degrees dyed away and edged more Easterly till it came to the E by N and there it stood We were in good hopes while the North continued to have gotten to  Jamaica  before it ceased and were sorry to find our selves thus disappointed for we could not see the Island though we judged we could not be far from it at Noon we had a good observation and found ourselves in the Latiude of the Island  We now had not one bit of any kind of Food  aboard therefore the Captain desired to know out opinions what to do and which way we might soonest get to some shore either to beat for  Jamaica  or to bear away before the Wind for the South Keys All the Seamen but my self were for going to the South Keys alledging that our Ship being such a dull Sailer would never get to Windward without the help of Sea and Land Breezes which we could not expect at such a distance as we were being out of the sight of any Land and that it was probable that in three or four days time we might be among the South Keys if we would put for it and there we should find Provision enough either Fish or Flesh I told them that the Craft was in Catching it and it was as probable that we might get as little Food in the Souths Keys as we did at  Pines  where though there was plenty of Beefs and Hogs yet we could not tell how to get any besides we might be six or seven days in getting to the Keys all which time we must of necessity fast which if 'twere but two or three days would bring us so low that we should be in a weak condition to Hunt On the contrary if they would agree to beat a day or two longer for the Island  Jamaica  we might in all probability see and come so near it that we might send in our Boat and get Provision from thence though we could not get in to Anchor for by all likelihood we were not so far from the Island but that we might have seen it had it been clear and that the hanging of the Clouds seemed to indicate to us that the Land was obscured by them Some of them did acquiesce with me in my Opinion however 'twas agreed to put away for the South Keys and accordingly we veered out our Sheets trimm'd our Sails and steered away N N W I was so much dissatisfied that I turned into my Cabbin and told them we should be all starved  I could not sleep tho' I lay down for I was very much troubled to think of fasting or Days or a Week having fared very hard already Indeed 'twas by meer accident that our Food lasted so long for we carried two Barrels of Beef out with us to sell but 'twas so bad that none would buy it which proved well for us for after our own Stock was spent this supplied us We boiled every day two pieces of it and because our Pease were all eaten and our Flour almost spent we cut our Beef in small bits after 'twas boiled and boiled it again in Water thicken'd with a little Flour and so eat it altogether with Spoons The little Pieces of Beef were like Plums in our Hodgpodg Indeed 'twas not fit to be eaten any other way for tho' it did not stink yet it was very unsavory and black without the least sign of Fat in it Bread and Flour being scarce with us we could not make Doughboys to eat with it But to proceed I had not lain in my Cabbin above three Glasses before one on the Deck cryed out  Land Land  I was very glad at the News and we all immediately discerned it very plain The first that we saw was Highland which we knew to be  BlewfieldsHill  by a bending or Saddle on the Top with two small Heads on each side It bore N E by E and we had the Wind at E therefore we presently clapp'd on a Wind and steered in N N E and soon after we saw all the Coast being not above or Leagues from it We kept jogging on all the Afternoon not striving to get into any particular place but where we could fetch there we were resolved to Anchor The next day being pretty near the shore between  Blemfields Point  and  PointNigrill  and having the Wind large enough to fetch the latter we steered away directly thither and seeing a small Vessel about two Leagues N W of us making signs to speak with us by hoysing and lowring her Topsails  we were afraid of her and edged in nearer the shore and about three a Clock in the Afternoon to our great joy we anchored at  Nigrill  having been Weeks on our Passage I think never any Vessel before nor since made such Traverses in coming out of the  Bay  as we did having first blunder'd over the  Alcrany Riff  and then visited those Islands from thence fell in among the  Colorado Shoals  afterward made a trip to  Grand Caymanes  and lastly visited  Pines  tho' to no purpose In all these Rambles we got as much experience as if we had been sent out on a design  As soon as we came to Anchor we sent our Boat ashore to buy Provisions to regale our selves after our long fatigue and fasting and were very busie going to drink a Bowl of Punch When unexpectedly Capt  Rawlins  Commander of a small  NewEngland  Vessel that we left at  Trist  and one Mr  John Hooker  who had been in the  Bay  a Twelvemonth cutting Logwood and was now coming up to  Jamaica  to sell it came aboard and were invited into the Cabbin to drink with us the Bowl had not yet been touch'd I think there might be six Quarts in it but Mr  Hooker  being drunk to by Captain  Rawlins  who pledg'd Capt  Hudswel  and having the Bowl in his hand said That he was under an Oath to drink but Draughts of strong Liquor a Day and putting the Bowl to his Head turn'd it off at one Draught and so making himself drunk disappointed us of our Expectations till we made another Bowl The next day having a brisk N W Wind which was a kind of  Chocolatto North  we arrived at  PortRoyal  and so ended this troublesome Voyage  CHAP II  The Author's second Voyage to the Bay of  Campeachy  His arrival

Crocodiles how they differ from Alligators A narrow escape of an  Irish  man from  n Alligator  IT was not long after our arrival at  PortRoyal  before we were payed off and discharged Now Captain  Johnson  of  NewEngland  being bound again into the  Bay  of  Campeachy  I took the opportunity of going a Passenger with him being resolved to spend some time at the Logwood Trade and accordingly provided such necessaries as were required about it  viz  Hatchets Axes Macheats  i e  Long Knives Saws Wedges c a Pavillion to sleep in a Gun with Powder and Shot c and leaving a Letter of Attorney with Mr  Fleming  a Merchant of  PortRoyal  as well to dispose of any thing that I should send up to him as to remit to me what I should order I took leave of my Friends and Imbarked  About the middle of  Feb  We sailed from  Jamaica  and with a fair Wind and Weather soon got as far as  Cape Catoch  and there met a pretty strong North which lasted two days After that the Trade settled again at E N E which speedily carried us to  Trist  Island In a little time I setled my self in the West Creek of the West Lagune with some old LogwoodCutters to follow the Employment with them But I shall proceed no farther with the Relation of my own Affairs till I have  given a description of the Country and its Product with some particulars of the LogwoodCutters their hunting for Beef and making Hides c  I have in my former Voyage described the Coast from Cape  Catoch  to Cape  Condecedo  Therefore I shall now begin where I then left off and following the same method proceed to give some Account of the Seacoast of the Bay of  Campeachy  being competently qualified for it by many little Excursions that I made from  Trist  during my Abode in these Parts  The Bay of  Campeachy  is a deep bending of the Land contained between Cape  Condecedo  on the East and a Point shooting forth from the HighLand of St  Martins  on the West The distance between these two place is about Leagues in which are many large and navigable Rivers wide Lagunes c Of all which I shall treat in their order as also of the Land on the Coast its Soil Product c Together with some Observations concerning the Trees Plants Vegetables Animals and Natives of the Country  From Cape  Condecedo  to the  Salinas  is or Leagues the Coast runs in South It is all a Sandy Bay between and the Land also within is dry and sandy producing only some scrubbed Trees Halfway between these two Places you may dig in the Sand above Highwater Mark and find very good fresh Water  The  Salina  is a fine small Harbour for Banks but there is not above or Foot Water and close by the Sea a little within the Land there is a large Salt Pond belonging to  Campeachy  Town which yields abundance of Salt At the time when the Salt Kerns which is in  May  or  June  the  Indians  of the Country are ordered by the  Spaniards  to give their attendance to rake it ashore and gather it into a great Pyramidal Heap broad below and sharp at the top  like the Ridge of a House then covering it all over with dry Grass and Reeds they set Fire to it and this burns the outside Salt to a hard black Crust The hard Crust is afterwards a defence against the Rains that are now settled in and preserves the Heap dry even in the wettest Season The  Indians  whose business I have told you is to gather the Salt thus into Heaps wait here by turns all the Kerning Season not less than or Families at a time yet here are no Houses for them to lie in neither do they at all regard it for they are relieved by a fresh supply of  Indians  every Week and they all sleep in the open Air some on the Ground but most in very poor Hammocks fastned to Trees or Posts stuck into the Ground for that purpose There Fare is no better than their Lodging for they have no other Food while they are here but Tartilloes and Posole Tartilloes are small Cakes made of the Flour of  Indian  Corn and Posole is also  Indian  Corn boiled of which they make their Drink But of this more hereafter when I treat of the Natives and their manner of Living When the Kerning Season is over the  Indians  march home to their settled Habitations taking no more care of the Salt But the  Spaniards  of  Campeachy  who are owners of the Ponds do frequently send their Barks hither for Salt to load Ships that lye in  Campeachy  Road and afterwards transport it to all the Ports in the Bay of  Mexico  especially to  Aluarado  and  Tompeck  two great Fishing Towns and I think that all the Inland Towns thereabouts are supplied with it for I know of no other Salt Ponds on all the Coast besides this and those before mentioned This  Salina  Harbour was often visited by the  English  LogwoodCutters in their way from  Jamaica  to  Trist  And if they found any Barks here either light or laden they made bold to take and sell both the Ships and the  Indian  Sailors that belonged to them This they  would tell you was by way of reprizal for some former injuries received of the  Spaniards  though indeed 'twas but a pretence for the Governours of  Jamaica  knew nothing of it neither durst the  Spaniards  complain for at that time they used to take all the  English  Ships they met with in these Parts not sparing even such as came laden with Sugar from  Jamaica  and were bound for  England  especially if they had Logwood aboard This was done openly for the Ships were carried into the  Havanna  there sold and the Men imprisoned without any Redress  From the  Salinas  to  Campeachy  Town is about Leagues the Coast runs S by W The first Leagues of it along the Coast is drowned MangroveLand yet about two Mile South of the  Salina  about Yards from the Sea there is a fresh Spring which is visited by all the  Indians  that pass this way either in Bark or Canoa there being no Water besides near it and there is a small dirty Path leads to it thro' the Mangroves after you are past these Mangroves the Coast riseth higher with many sandy Bays where Boats may conveniently land but no fresh Water till you come to a River near  Campeachy  Town The Land further along the Coast is partly Mangrovy but most of it dry Ground and not very fruitful producing only a few scrubbed Bushes and there is no Logwood growing on all this Coast even from Cape  Catoch  to  Campeachy  Town  About six Leagues before you come to  Campeachy  there is a small Hill called  Hina  where Privateers do commonly Anchor and keep Sentinels on the Hill to look out for Ships bound to the Town There is plenty of good Firewood but no Water and in the Surf of the Sea close by the shore you find abundance of Shellfish called by the  English Horsehoofs  because the under part or Belly of the Fish is flat and somewhat resembling that Figure in shape and Magnitude but the Back is round like a Turtles  the Shell is thin and brittle like a Lobsters with many small Claws and by report they are very good Meat but I never tasted any of them my self  There are three small low sandy Islands about or Leagues from  Hina  bearing North from it and Leagues from  Campeachy  On the South side of these Islands there is good Anchorage but neither Wood nor Water and as for Animals we saw none but only great numbers of large Rats and Plenty of Boobies and MenofWarBirds These Islands are call'd the  Triangles  from the Figure they make in their Position There are no other at any distance from the shore but these and the Alcranies mentioned in the former Chapter in all this Coast that I have seen  From  Hina  to  Campeachy  as I have said before is about Leagues  Campeachy  is a fair Town standing on the shore in a small bending of the Land and is the only Town on all this Coast even from Cape  Catoch  to  La vera Cruz  that stands open to the Sea It makes a fine shew being built all with good stone The Houses are not high but the Walls very strong the Roofs flattish after the  Spanish  Fashion and covered with Pantile There is a strong Cittadel or Fort at one end planted with many Guns where the Governour resides with a small Garrison to defend it Though this Fort commands the Town and Harbour yet it has been twice taken First by Sir  Christopher Mims  who about the Year having summoned the Governour and afterwards stayed days for an Answer before he landed his Men yet then took it by Storm and that only with small Arms I have been told that when he was advised by the  Jamaica  Privateers to take it by Stratagem in the Night he replyed that he scorned to steal a Victory therefore when he went against it he gave them warning of his Approach by his  Drums and Trumpets yet he took the Fort at the first Onset and immediately became Master of the Place  It was taken a second time by  English  and  French  Privateers about the Year by surprize They landed in the Night about two Leagues from the Town and marching into the Country lighted on a Path that brought them thither The next Morning near Sunrising they entred the Town when many of the Inhabitants were now stirring in their Houses who hearing a noise in the Street looked out to know the Occasion and seeing armed Men marching towards the Fort supposed them to be some Soldiers of their own Garrison that were returned out of the Country for about a Fortnight or Weeks before they had sent out a Party to suppress some  Indians  then in Rebellion a thing very common in this Country Under favour of this Supposition the Privateers marched through the Streets even to the Fort without the least Opposition Nay the TownsPeople bad them  Good Morrow  and Congratulated their safe return not discovering them to be Enemies till they fired at the  Sentinels  on the Fortwall and pesently after began a furious Attack and turning two small Guns which they found in the Parade against the Gates of the Fort they soon made themselves Masters of it The Town is not very rich though as I said before the only  Seaport  or all this Coast The chiefest Manufacture of the Country is CottonCloth this serves for cloathing the  Indians  and even the poorer sort of  Spaniard  wear nothing else It is used also for making Sails for Ships and remitted to other parts for the same purpose  Besides CottonCloth and Salt fetched from the  Salinas  I know of no other vendible Commodity exported hence Indeed formerly this place was the Scale of the whole  LogwoodTrade  which is there  fore still called  Palo    i e  Wood  de Campeachy  tho' it did not grow nearer than at or Leagues distance from the Town  The place where the  Spaniards  did then cut it was at a River called  Champeton  about or Leagues to Leeward of  Campeachy  Town the Coast from thence South the Land pretty high and rocky The Native  Indians  that lived hereabouts were hired to cut it for a Ryal a Day it being then worth or  l per Tim  After the English had taken  Jamaica  and began to cruise in this Bay they found many Barks laden with it but not knowing its value then they either set them adrift or burned them saving only the Nails and Iron work a thing now usual among the Privateers taking no notice at all of the Cargo till Capt  James  having taken a great Ship laden with it and brought her home to  England  to fit her for a Privateer beyond his Expectation sold his Wood at a great rate tho' before he valu'd it so little that he burned of it all his Passage home After his return to  Jamaica  the English visiting this Bay found out the Place where it grew and if they met no Prize at Sea they would go to  Champeton  River where they were certain to find large Piles cut to their Hand and brought to the Sea side ready to be shipp'd off This was their Common Practice till at the last the  Spaniards  sent Soldiers thither to prevent their Depredations  But by this time the  English  knew the Trees as growing and understanding their value began to rummage other Coasts of the Main in search of it till according to their desire they found large Groves of it first at Cape  Catoch  which as I have said before was the first Place where they settled to Logwoodcutting and loaded many Vessels from thence to  Jamaica  and other Places But it growing scarce there they found out the Lagune of  Trist  in the  Bay of  Campeachy  where they followed the same Trade and have ever since continued it even to the time of my being here But to proceed  From the River  Champeton  to  PortRoyal  is about Leagues the Coast S S W or S W by S Lowland with a sandy Bay against the Sea and some Trees by the shore with small  Savannahs  mixt with small shrubby Woods within Land all the way There is only one River between  Champeton  and  PortRoyal  called  Port Escondedo  PortRoyal  is a broad entrance into a Salt  Lagune  of or Leagues long and or wide with Mouths one at each end This Mouth of  PortRoyal  hath a Barr whereon there is or Foot Water Within the Barr it is deep enough and there is good Anchoring on either side The entrance is about a Mile over and two Miles in length it hath fair sandy Bays on each side with smooth Landing  Ships commonly anchor on the Weather or East side next  Champeton  both for the convenience of some Wells they dug on the Bays by the Privateers and LogwoodCutters as also to ride more out of the Tide which here runs very strong This Place is remarkable enough because from hence the Land trends away West and runs so for about or Leagues farther  On the West side of this Harbour is a low Island call'd by Us  PortRoyalIsland  which makes one side of the Mouth as the Main does the other It is about Miles wide and Leagues long running East and West The East end of this Island is sandy and pretty clear of Woods with some Grass bearing a small prickly Bur no bigger than a Grey Pea which renders it very troublesome to those that walk barefoot as the BayMen often do There are some Bushes of Burtonwood and a little further to the West grow large  SapadilloTrees  whose Fruit is  long and very pleasant The rest of the Island is more woody especially the North side which is full of white Mangrove close to the shore  On the West side of this Island is another small low Island called  Trist  separated from the former by a small Salt Creek scarce broad enough for a Canoa to paddle through  The  Island Trist  is in some Places three Miles wide and about Leagues in length running E and W The East end is swampy and full of white Mangroves and the South side much the same The West part is dry and sandy bearing a sort of long Grass growing in Tufts very thin This is a sort of Savannah with some large  PalmetoTrees  growing in it The North side of the West end is full of  CocoPlum Bushes  and some Grapes  The  CocoPlum Bush  is about or Foot high spreading out into many Branches Its Rind black and smooth the Leaves oval and pretty large and of a dark Green The Fruit is about the bigness of a HorsePlum but round some are black some white others reddish The Skin of the Plum is very thin and smooth the inside white soft and woolly rather fit to suck than bite inclosing in the Middle a large soft Stone This Fruit grows commonly in the Sand near the Sea and I have tasted some that have been saltish but they are commonly sweet and pleasant enough and accounted very wholsom  The Body of the  GrapeTree  is about two or three Foot in Circumference growing or Foot high then sends forth many Branches whose Twigs are thick and gross the Leaves are shaped much like an Ivy Leaf but broader and more hard the Fruit is as big as an ordinary Grape growing in Bunches or Clusters among the Twigs all over the Tree it is black when ripe and the inside reddish with a large hard Stone in the middle This Fruit is very pleasant and wholsom but of little substance the Stones  being so large The Body and Limbs of the Tree are good Fewel making a clear strong Fire therefore often used by the Privateers to harden the Steels of their Guns when faulty  The Animals of this  Island  are  Lizards Guanoes Snakes  and  Deer  Beside the common small  Lizard  there is another sort of a large kind call'd a  LyonLizard  This Creature is shap'd much like the other but almost as big as a Man's Arm and it has a large Comb on its Head when it is assaulted it sets its Comb up an end but otherways it lies down flat Here are two or three sorts of Snakes some very large as I have been told  At the West end of the  Island  close by the Sea you may dig in the Sand or foot deep and find good fresh Water There are commonly Wells ready made by Seamen to water their Ships but they soon fill up if not cleared and if you dig too deep your Water will be Salt This  Island  was seldom clear of Inhabitants when the  English  visited the Bay for Logwood for the biggest Ships did always ride here in or fathom Water close by the shore but smaller Vessels ran up Leagues farther to  OneBushKey  of which in my former Chapter  The second Mouth or Entrance into this Lagune is between  Trist  and  BeefIsland  and is about mile wide It is shoal without and only two Channels to come in The deepest Channel on the Spring Tide has Foot Water It lyes near the middle of the Mouth hard Sand on the Bar the West Channel is about Foot Water and lyes pretty near  BeefIsland  you run in with the  SeaBreez  and sound all the way taking your sounding from  BeefIsland  shore The bottom is soft Oaz and its shoals gradually Being shot in within  BeefIsland  Point you will have three Fathom then you may stand over towards  Trist  till you come near the shore and  there anchor as you please There is good Anchoring any where within the Bar between  Trist  and  BeefIsland  but the Tide is much stronger than at  PortRoyal  This is the other Mouth or opening to the Salt Lagune before mentioned This Lagune is call'd by the  Spaniards Laguna Termina  or the Lagune of Tides because they run very strong here Small Vessels as Barks Periagoes or Canoas may sail thro' this Lagune from one Mouth to the other or into such Creeks Rivers or smaller Lagunes as empty themselves into this of which here are many The first of note on the East part of this Lagune as you come in at  PortRoyal  is the River  Summasenta  This River though but small yet is big enough for  Periagoes  to enter It disembogues on the South side near the middle of the Lagune There was formerly an  Indian  Village named  Summasenta  near the Mouth of the River and another large  Indian  Town called  Chucquebul  or Leagues up in the Country This latter was once taken by the Privateers by whom I have been informed that there were about two thousand Families of Indians in it and two or three Churches and as many Spanish Friers though no white Men beside The Land near this River yields plenty of Logwood  From  Summasenta  River to  OneBushKey  is or Leagues the shore running West I have described  OneBushKey  and the Creek against it which as I said is very narrow and not above a mile long before it opens into another wide Lake lying nearest N and S called the  Lagune  It is about a League and a half wide and Leagues long encompassed with MangroveTrees At the S E corner of it there is another Creek about a mile wide at the Mouth running or Miles into the Country on both sides of it grows plenty of Logwood therefore it was inhabited by Englishmen who lived in  small Companies from three to ten in a Company and setled themselves at their best convenience for Cutting At the Head of the Creek they made a path leading into a large Savannah full of black Cattle Horses and Deer which was often visited by them upon occasion  At the North end and about the middle of the East Lagune there is another small Creek like that which comes out against  OneBushKey  but less and shallower which dischargeth it self into  Laguna Termina  against a small sandy Key called by the  English Serles  's  Key  from one Captain  Serles  who first Careen'd his Vessel here and was afterwards killed in the Western Lagune by one of his Company as they were cutting Logwood together This Captain  Serles  was one of Sir  Henry Morgans  Commanders at the Sacking of  Panama  who being sent out to cruise in a small Vessel in the South Seas happened to surprize at  Taboca  the Boatswain and most of the Crew belonging to the  Trinity  a  Spanish  Ship on Board which were the Friers and Nuns with all the old Gentlemen and Matrons of the Town to the number of Souls besides an immense Treasure in  Silver  and  Gold  as I was informed by Captain  Peralta  who then Commanded her as he did afterwards when she was taken by Captain  Sharp  all which he might have taken in the Ship had he pursued her  On the West side of the East Lagune there is a small  Skirt  of Mangroves that separates it from another running parallel with it called the  EastLagune  which is abou  bigness of the former  Towards the North  of this Lagune runs a small Creek coming out of the  East Lagune  deep enough for small Barks to pass through  At the South end of this  Lagune  there is a Creek about a mile wide at its Mouth and half a mile from thence it divides into two Branches one called  the East the other the West Branch both deep enough for small Barks or Miles up The Water is fresh Months but in the midst of the dry  Season  'tis brackish Four Miles from the Mouth the Land on both sides these two Branches is wet and swampy affording only Mangroves by the Creeks sides only at the Heads of them there are many large Oaks besides which I did never see any growing within the Tropicks but Paces within that grows plenty of Logwood therefore the Cutters settled themselves here also  On the West side of the West Branch lyes a large Pasture for Cattle about Miles from the Creek to which the LogwoodCutters had made paths from their Huts to hunt Cattle which are always there in great numbers and commonly fatter than those in the Neighbouring  Savannahs  and therefore was called the fat  Savannah  and this West Creek was always most inhabited by LogwoodCutters  The  LogwoodTrade  was grown very common before I came hither here being as I said before about or Men living in all the  Lagune  and at  BeefIsland  of which  Isle  I shall speak hereafter This Trade had its Rise from the decay of  Privateering  for after  Jamaica  was well settled by the  English  and a Peace established with  Spain  the  Privateers  who had hitherto lived upon plundering the  Spaniards  were put to their shifts for they had prodigally spent whatever they got and now wanting subsistance were forced either to go to  Petit Guavas  where the PrivateerTrade still continued or into the Bay for  Logwood  The more Industrous  ort of them came hither yet even these though they could work well enough if they pleased y  thought it a dry business to toil at Cutting Wood They were good MarksMen and so took more delight in Hunting but neither of those Employments affected them so  much as Privateering therefore they often made Sallies out in small Parties among the nearest  Indian  Towns where they plundred and brought away the  Indian Women  to serve them at their Huts and sent their Husbands to be sold at  Jamaica  besides they had not forgot their old Drinkingbouts and would still spend or  l  at a sitting aboard the Ships that came hither from  Jamaica  carousing and firing of Guns or days together And tho' afterwards many sober Men came into the Bay to cut Wood yet by degrees the old Standards so debauched them that they could never settle themselves under any Civil Government but continued in their Wickedness till the  Spaniards  encouraged by their careless Rioting fell upon them and took most of them singly at their own Huts and carried them away Prisoners to  Campeachy  or  La Vera Cruz  from whence they were sent to  Mexico  and sold to several Tradesmen in that City and from thence after two or three Years when they could speak  Spanish  many of them made their Escapes and marched in byPaths back to  La Vera Cruz  and by the  Flota  conveyed to  Spain  and so to  England  I have spoke with many of them since who told me that none of them were sent to the Silver Mines to work but kept in or near the City and never suffered to go with their Caravans to  New Mexico  or that way I relate this because it is generally suggested that the  Spaniards  commonly send their Prisoners thither and use them very barbarously but I could never learn that any  European  has been thus served whether for fear of discovering their Weakness or for any other Reason I know not But to proceed It is most certain that the LogwoodCutters that were in the Bay when I was there were all routed or taken a thing I ever feared and that was the reason that moved me at last to come away  although a Place where a Man mi  have gotten an Estate  Having thus given an Account of the first setling of this Place by my Countrymen I shall next say something concerning the Seasons of the Year some particulars of the Country its Animals of the LogvvoodTrade and their manner of Hunting and several remarkable Passages that happened during my stay there  This part of the Bay of  Campeachy  lyes in about  d of North Lat The SeaBreezes here in fair weather are at N N E or N The Landwinds are at  S E and S but in bad Weather at E S E a hard gale for two or three days together The dry Season begins in  September  and holds till  April or May  then comes in the wet Season which begins with Tornadoes first one in a day and by degrees increasing till  June  and then you have set Rains till the latter end of  August  This svvells the Rivers so that they overflow and the Savannahs begin to be covered with Water and although there may be some intermissions of dry Weather yet there are still plentiful showers of Rain so that as the water does not increase neither does it decrease but continues thus till the North Winds are set in strong and then all the Savannahs for many Miles seem to be but part of the Sea The Norths do commonly set in about the beginning of  October  and continue by intervals till  March  But of these I shall speak more in my Chapter of Winds These Winds blowing right in on the Land drive in the Sea and keep the Tides from their constant Course as long as they last which is sometimes two or three Days by this means the Freshes are pent up and overflow much more th  n before tho' there be less Rain They blow most  in  December  and  January  but afterwards th  decrease in strength and are neither so frequent nor lasting and then the Freshes begin to drain from off  the low Ground By the middle of  Feb  The Land is all dry and in the next Month perhaps you will scarce get Water to drink even in those Savannahs that but Weeks before were like a Sea By the beginning of  April  the Ponds also in the Savannahs are all dryed up and one that knows not how to get Water otherways may perish for thirst but those that are acquainted here in their Necessity make to the Woods and refresh themselves with Water that they f  d in wild  Pines  Ths wild  Pine  is a Plant so called because it somewhat resembles the Bush that bears the Pine they are commonly supported or grow from some Bunch Knot or Excrescence of the Tree where they take root and grow upright The Root is short and thick from whence the Leaves rise up in folds one within another spreading off at the top They are of a good thick Substance and about or Inches long The outside Leaves are so compact as to contain the Rainwater as it falls They will hold a Pint and a half or a Quart and this Water refreshes the Leaves and nourishes the Root When we find these  Pines  we stick our Knives into the Leaves just above the Root and that lets out the Water which we catch in our Hats as I have done many times to my great relief  The Land near the Sea or the Lagunes is Mangrovy and always wet but at a little distance from it it is fast and firm and never overflow'd but in the w  Season The Soil is a strong yellowish Clay But yet the upper Coat or surface is a black mould tho' not deep Here grow divers sorts of Trees of no great bulk or height Among these the LogwoodTrees thrive best and are very plentiful this being the most proper Soil for them for they do not thrive in day Ground neither shall you see any growing in rich black mould They are much like our WhiteThorns in  England  but generally a great deal bigger  the Rind of the young growing Branches is white and smooth with some prickles shooting forth here and there So that an  Englishman  not knowing the difference would take them for WhiteThorns but the Body and old Branches are blackish the Rind rougher with few or no prickles The leaves are small and shaped like the Common WhiteThornLeaf of a palish Green We always chuse to cut the old blackrinded Trees for these have less sap and require but little pains to chip or cut it The sap is white and the heart red The heart is used much for dying therefore we chip off all the white sap till we come to the heart and then it is fit to be transported to  Europe  After it has been chip'd a little while it turns black and if it lyes in the Water it dyes it like Ink and sometimes it has been used to write with Some Trees are or Foot in Circumference and these we can scarce cut into Logs small enough for a Man's Burthen without great Labour and therefore are forced to blow them up It is a very ponderous sort of wood and burns very well making a clear strong fire and very lasting We always harden the Steels of our FireArms when they are faulty in a  Logwoodfire  if we we can get it but otherways as I said before with  Burton wood  or the Grapetree The true  Logwood  I think grows only in the Country of  Jucatan  and even there but only in some Places near the Sea The chiefest places for it are either here or at Cape  Catoch  and on the  South  side of  Jucatan  in the Bay of  Honduras  There are other sorts of Wood much like it in colour and used for dying also some more esteemed others of lesser value Of these sorts Bloodwood and Stockfishwood are of the natural growth of  America  The Gulph of  Nicaragua  which opens against the Isle of  Providence  is the only Place that I know in the North Seas that produces the Bloodwood  And the Land on the other side of the Country against it in the South Seas produceth the same sorts  This Wood is of a brighter red than the Logwood It vvas sold for  l per  Tun vvhen Logwood vvas but at or and at the same time StockFishWood vvent at or This last sort grows in the Country near  Rio la Hacha  to the East of St  Martha  by the sides of Rivers in the LovvLand It is a smaller sort of Wood than the former I have seen a Tree much like the Logwood in the River of  Conception  in the  Sambaloes  and I knovv it will dye but whether it be either of these tvvo sorts I know not Besides here and in the places beforementioned I have not met with any such Wood in  America  At  Cherburg  near  SierraLeone  in  Africa  there is Camvvood which is much like Bloodvvood if not the same And at  Tunqueen  in the  EastIndies  there is also such another sort I have not heard of any more in any part of the World But to proceed  The Land as you go farther from the Sea riseth still somewhat higher and becomes of a more plantable Mould There the Trees are generally of another sort growing higher and taller than the Logvvoodtrees or any near them Beyond this you still enter in large Savannahs of long Grass two or three Miles wide in some Places much more  The Mould of the Savannahs is generally black and deep producing a course sort of sedgy Grass In the latter end of the dry time vve set fire to it which runs like Wildfire and keeps burning as long as there is any Fewel unless some good shovver of Rain put it out Then presently springs up a new green Crop vvhich thrives beyond all belief The Savannahs are bounded on each side vvith Ridges of higher Land of a lightbrown Colour deep and very fruitful producing extraordinary great high  Trees The Land for or Miles from the Sea is generally compos'd of many Ridges of delicate Woodland and large Furrows of pleasant grassy Savannahs alternately intermix'd with each other  The Animals of this Country are Horses Bullocks Deer Warree Precary Squashes Possums Monkies Ant Bears Sloths Armadilloes Porcupines Landturtle Guanoes and Lizards of all kinds  The Squash is a fourfooted Beast bigger than a Cat Its Head is much like a Foxes with short Ears and a long Nose It has pretty short Legs and sharp Claws by which it will run up Trees like a Cat The Skin is covered with short fine yellowish Hair The flesh of it is good sweet wholesom Meat We commonly skin and roast it and then we call it Pig and I think it eats as well It feeds on nothing but good Fruit therefore we find them most among the SapadilloTrees This Creature never rambles very far and being taken young will become as tame as a Dog and be as roguish as a Monkey  The Monkies that are in these Parts are the ugliest I ever saw They are much bigger than a Hare and have great Tails about two foot and a half long The under side of their Tails is all bare with a black hard skin but the upper side and all the Body is covered with course long black staring Hair These Creatures keep together or in a Company and ramble over the Woods leaping from Tree to Tree If they meet with a single Person they will threaten to devour him When I have been alone I have been afraid to shoot them especially the first time I met them They were a great Company dancing from Tree to Tree over my Head chattering and making a terrible Noise and a great many grim Faces and shewing Antick Gestures Some broke down dry Sticks and threw at me others scattered  their Urine and Dung about my Ears at last one bigger than the rest came to a small Limb justover my Head and leaping directly at me made me start back but the Monkey caught hold of the Bough with the tip of his Tail and there continued svvinging to and fro and making Mouths at meAt last I past on they still keeping me Company with the like menacing Postures till I came to our Huts The Tails of these Monkies ars as good to them as one of their Hands and they will hold as fast by them If two or more of us were together they would hasten from us The Females with their young ones are much troubled to leap after the Males for they have commonly two one she carries under one of her Arms the other sits on her back and clasps her tvvo fore Paws about her Neck These Monkies are the most sullen I ever met with for all the Art we could use would never tame them It is a hard matter to shoot one of them so as to take it for if it gets hold with its Clavvs or Tail it will not fall as long as one breath of Life remains After I have shot at one and broke a Leg or an Arm I have pitied the poor Creature to see it look and handle the vvounded Limb and turn it about from side to side These Monkies are very rarely or as some say never on the Ground  The AntBear is a fourfooted Beast as big as a pretty large Dog with rough blackbrown Hair It has short Legs a long Nose and little Eyes a very little Mouth and a slender Tongue like an Earthworm about or Inches long This Creature feeds on Ants therefore you alvvays find them near an Ants Nest or Path It takes its Food thus It lays its Nose down flat on the Ground close by the Path that the Ants travel in whereof here are many in this Country and then puts out his Tongue athwart the Path the Ants passing forwards and  backwards continually when they come to the Tongue make a stop and in two or three Minutes time it will be covered all over with Ants which she preceiving draws in her Tongue and then eats them and after puts it out again to trapan more They smell very strong of Ants and taste much stronger for Ihave eaten of them I have met with these Creatures in several places of  America  as well as here  i e  in the  Sambaloes  and in the  SouthSeas  on the  Mexican Continent  The Sloth is a fourfooted hairy sad coloured Animal somewhat less than the Antbear not so rough Its Head is round its Eyes small it has a short Nose and very sharp Teeth short Legs but extra ordinary long sharp Claws This Creature feeds on Leaves whether indifferently of all sorts or only on some particular kinds I know not They are very mischievous to the Trees where they come and are so slow in motion that when they have eaten all the Leaves on one Tree before they can get down from that and climb another and settle themselves to their fresh Banquet which takes them up or days tho' the Trees stand near They are nothing but skin and bones altho' they came down plump and fat from the last Tree They never descend till they have stript every Limb and Bough and made them as bare as Winter It takes them up or Minutes to move one of their Feet Inches forward and they move all their four Feet one after another at the same slow rate neither will stripes make them mend their pace which I have tryed to do by whipping them but they seem insensible and can neither be frighted or provoked to move faster  The  Armad  o  so called from its Suit of Armour is as big as a small sucking Pig the body of it pretty long This Creature is inclosed in a thick Shell  which guards all its back and comes down on both sides and meets under the belly leaving room for the four Legs the Head is small with a Nose like a Pig a pretty long Neck and can put out its Head before its Body when it walks but on any danger she puts it in under the shell and drawing in her Feet she lies stock still like a LandTurtle And though you toss her about she will not move her self The Shell is joynted in the middle of the back so that she can turn the forepart of her body about which way she pleases The Feet are like those of a LandTurtle and it has strong Claws wherewith it digs holes in the Ground like a Cony The flesh is very sweet and tastes much like a LandTurtle  The  Porcupine  being a Creature well known I'll pass it in silence  The Beasts of prey that are bred in this Country are TigreCats and as is reported by our Men Lions The TigreCat is about the bigness of a BullDug with short Legs and a truss Body shaped much like a Mastiff but in all things else  viz  its Head the colour of its Hair and the manner of its Preying much resembling the Tigre only somewhat less Here are great numbers of them They prey on young Calves or other Game whereof here is plenty And because they do not want Food they are the less to be feared But I have wisht them farther off when I have met them in the Woods because their aspect appears so very stately and fierce I never did see any Lion in this Country but I have been informed by two or three persons that they did see Lions here But I am assured that they are not numerous  Here are a great many poisonous Creatures in this Country more particularly Snakes of divers sorts some yellow some green and others of a dun Colour with black and yellowish spots The yellow  Snake is commonly as big as the small of a Man's Leg and or Foot long These are a lazy sort of Creatures for they lye still and prey on Lizards Guanoes or other small Animals that come in their way  It is reported that sometimes they lirk in Trees and that they are so mighty in strength as to hold a Bullock fast by one of his Horns when they happen to come so near that she can twist her self about the Limb of the Tree and the Horn at once These are accounted very good Meat by some and are eaten frequently I my self have tryed it for curiosity but cannot commend it I have heard some Baymen report that they have seen some of this kind here as big as an ordinary Man's Waste but I never saw any such  The green Snakes are no bigger about than a Man's Thumb yet or Foot long The Backs are of a very lively green colour but their Bellies inclining to yellow These are commonly in Bushes among the green Leaves and prey upon small Birds This I have often seen and was once in danger to be bit by one before I saw it For I was going to take hold of a Bird that fluttered and cryed out just by me yet did not fly away neither could I imagine the reason till reaching out my hand I perceived the head of a Snake close by it and looking more narrowly I saw the upper part of the Snake about two or three Inches from his Head twisted about the poor Bird  What they feed on besides Birds I know not but they are said to be very venemous  The dun coloured Snake is a little bigger than the green Snake but not above a Foot and a half or two Foot long these we should often see in and about our Huts but did not kill them because they destroyed the Mice and are very nimble in chacing those Creatures Besides Snakes here are Scorpions  and Centapees in abundance Here are also Gallywasps These are Creatures somewhat resembling Lizards but larger their Bodies about the thickness of a Man's Arm having four short Legs and small short Tails their colour a dark brown These Creatures live in old hollow Trunks of Trees and are commonly found in wet swampy Ground and are said to be very poisonous  Here are also a sort of Spiders of a prodigious size some near as big as a Man's fist with long small Legs like the Spiders in  England  they have two Teeth or rather Horns an Inch and a half or two Inches long and of a proportionable bigness which are black as Jett smooth as Glass and their small end sharp as a Thorn they are not strait but bending These Teeth we often preserve Some wear them in their Tobacco pouches to pick their Pipes Others preserve them for ToothPickers especially such as were troubled with the Toothach for by report they will expel that pain tho' I cannot justifie it of my own Knowledge The backs of these Spiders are covered with a dark yellowish Down as soft as Velvet Some say these Spiders are venemous others not whether is true I cannot determine  Tho' this Country be so often overflown with Water yet it swarms with Ants of several sorts  viz  great small black yellow c The great black Ant stings or bites almost as bad as a Scorpion and next to this the small yellow Ants bite is most painful for their sting is like a spark of fire and they are so thick among the boughs in some places that one shall be covered with them before he is aware These Creatures have Nests on great Trees placed on the Body between the Limbs some of their Nests are as big as a Hogshead this is their Winter Habitation for in the wet Season they all repair to these their Cities  Here they preserve their Eggs AntsEggs are as much esteemed by the Planters in the WestIndies for feeding their Chickens as Great Oatmeal with us in  England  In the dry Season when they leave their Nests they swarm over all the Woodland for they never trouble the Savannahs You may then see great Paths made by them in the Woods of three or four Inches broad beaten as plain as the Roads in  England  They go out light but bring home heavy Loads on their backs all of the same substance and equal in bigness I never observed any thing besides pieces of green Leaves so big that I could scarce see the Insect for his Burthen yet they would march stoutly and so many still pressing after that it was a very pretty sight for the Path lookt prefectly green with them There was one sort of Ants of a black Colour pretty large with long Legs these would march in Troops as if they were busie in seeking somewhat they were always in hast and followed their Leaders exactly let them go whither they would these had no beaten Paths to walk in but rambled about like Hunters Sometimes a Band of these Ants would happen to march through our Huts over our Beds or into our Pavilions nay sometimes into our Chests and there ransack every part and whereever the foremost went the rest all came after We never disturbed them but gave them free liberty to search where they pleased and they would all march off before night These Companies were so great that they would be two or three hours in passing by though they went very fast  The Fowls of this Country are Humming Birds Black Birds Turtle Doves Pigeons Parrots Parakites Quames Corresoes Turkies Carrion Crows Subtle Jacks Bill Birds Cockrecoes c The Humming Bird is a pretty little feather'd Creature no bigger than a great overgrown Wasp with a black Bill no bigger than a small Needle and his Legs and  Feet in proportion to his body This Creature does not wave his Wings like other Birds when it flies but keeps them in a continued quick motion like Bees or other Infects and like them makes a continual humming Noise as it flies It is very quick in motion and haunts about Flowers and Fruit like a Bee gathering Hony making many near addresses to its delightful Objects by visiting them on all sides and yet still keeps in motion sometimes on one side sometime on the other as often rebounding a foot or two back on a sudden and as quickly returns again keeping thus about one Flower five or six minutes or more There are two or three sorts of them some bigger than others but all very small neither are they coloured alike the largest are of a blackish colour  The Black Bird is somewhat bigger than ours in  England  it has a longer Tail but like them in Colour They are sometimes called Chattering Crows because they chatter like a Magpy  There are three sorts of Turtle Doves  viz  white brested Doves dun coloured Doves and ground Doves The white breasts are the biggest they are of a blewish gray Colour with white Breasts these are fine round and plump and almost as big as a Pigeon The next sort are all over of a dun lesser than the former and not so round The ground Dove much bigger than a SkyLark of a dull grey very round and plump and commonly runs in pairs on the ground and probably thence have their name The other two sorts flie in pairs and feed on Berries which they commonly gather themselves from the Trees where they grow and all threes sorts are very good Meat  Pigeons are not very common here they are less than our Wood Quests and as good food  The Quam is as big as an ordinary Hen Turkey of a blackish dun Colour its Bill like a Turkeys  it flies about among the Woods feeds on Berries and is very good meat  The Correso is a larger Fowl that the Quam The Cock is black the Hen is of a dark brown The Cock has a Crown of black Feathers on his Head and appears very stately These live also on Berries and are very good to eat but their Bones are said to be poisonous therefore we do either burn or bury them or throw them into the Water for fear our Dogs should eat them  Carrion Crows are blackish Fowls about the bigness of Ravens they have bald Heads and redish bald Necks like Turkeys and therefore by Strangers that come newly from  Europe  are often mistaken for such These live wholly on flesh and are therefore called Carrion Crows There are great numbers of them They are heavy dull Creatures and by their perching long at one place they seem to be very lazy yet they are quick enough to find out their Prey for when we hunt in the Woods or Savannahs as soon as we have killed a Beast they will immediately flock about us from all parts and in less than an hours time there will be two or three hundred though at first there was not one to be seen I have sometimes admired from whence so many came so suddenly for we never see above two or three at a place before they come to feast on a Carkass  Some of the Carrion Crows are all over white but their Feathers look as if they were sullied They have bald Heads and Necks like the rest they are of the same bigness and make without any difference but in Colour and we never see above one or two of these white ones at a time and 'tis seldom  lso that we see a great number of the black ones but we see one white one amongst them  The LogwoodCutters call the white ones King Carrion Crows and say that they are much bigger  than the others and that when a great number are assembled about a Carcass if a King Carrion Crow be among them he falls on first and none of the others will taste the least Morsel till he has filled his Belly and is withdrawn nay that they will sit perching on the Trees about him without approaching the Carcass till he flies away and then in an instant they fall on all together I have seen of the King Carrion Crows but could not perceive them to be bigger than the rest neither were the black ones their Companions so unmannerly as to let them eat without Company they are very voracious and will dispatch a Carcass in a Trice For that reason the Spaniards never kill them but fine any one that shall And I think there is also an Act in  Jamaica  that prohibits their destruction and the LogwoodCutters tho' under no such obligation yet are so zealously superstitious that none will hurt them for fear of receiving some damage afterwards  Subtle Jacks are Birds as big as Pidgeons they are mostly blackish the tips of their Wing Feathers are yellowish as are also their Bills They have a peculiar and wonderful cunning way of building different from any others Their Nests hang down from the boughs of lofty Trees whose Bodies are clean without limbs for a considerable height The branches to which they fasten them are those that spread farthest out from the body and the very extremities of those boughs are only used by them O  Trees that grow single by themselves at some distance from others they build clear round but i  they joyn to others they make choice of such only as are bordering upon a Savannah Pond or Creek and hang down those Nests from those limbs that spread over their Savannahs c neglecting such as are near other Trees Their Nests hang down two or three foot from the twigs to which they are  fastned and look just like CabbageNets stuft with Hay The Thread that fastens the Nest to the twig is made of long Grass as is also the Nest it self very ingeniously twisted together It is but small at the twig but near the Nest grows thicker The Nest has a hole in the side for the Bird to enter at and 'tis very pretty to see twenty or thirty of them hanging round a Tree They are all called by the English  Subtle Jacks  because of this uncommon way of building  There are two or three sorts of BillBirds so called by the English because their Bills are almost as big as themselves The largest I ever saw are about the size of English Woodpeckers and much like them There are others of a smaller sort but they are not often met with and I never saw many of them  Cockrecoes are short winged Birds coloured like Partridge but somewhat lesser neither are they so plump and round They have long Legs delighting to run on the Ground among Woods in swampy Places or near Creeks They make a loud Noise Mornings and Evenings and Answer one another very prettily and they are extraordinary sweet Meat  The WaterFowls are Duck and Mallard Curlews Herons Crabcatchers Pelicans Cormorants FishingHawks MenofWarBirds Boobies c  There are three sorts of Ducks  viz  The Muscovy the Whistling and the common Duck Muscovy Ducks are less than ours but otherwise exactly alike They perch on old dry Trees or such as have no leaves on them and seldom light on the Ground but to feed Whistling Ducks are somewhat less than our Common Duck but not differing from them in shape or Colour In flying their Wings make a pretty sort of loud whistling Noise These also perch on Trees as the former The  other sort are like our Common Ducks both in bigness and colour and I have never observed them to pitch upon Trees All three sorts are very good Meat  Here are two sorts of Curlews different in bigness and colour the greater are as big as Turkeys with long Legs and long crooked Bills like a Snipes in length and bigness proportionable to the Bulk of their Bodies They are of a dark colour their Wings black and white their Flesh black but very sweet and wholesom They are call'd by the  English  double Curlews because they are twice as big as the other sort  The small Curlews are of a dusky brown with long Legs and Bills like the former their Flesh is most esteemed as being the sweetest  Herons are like ours in  England  in bigness shape and colour  Crabcatchers are shaped and coloured like Herons but they are smaller They feed on small Crabs no bigger than ones Tumb of which there is great plenty  Pelicans are large flatfooted Fowls almost as big as Geese and their Feathers in colour like them they have short Legs long Necks and their Bills are about two Inches broad and or long the fore part of their Necks or Breasts is bare and covered with a soft smooth yet loose Skin like that about the Necks of Turkies This Skin is of the colour of their Feathers mixt with a dark and light grey so axactly interwoven that it appears very beautiful They are a very heavy Bird and seldom fly far or very high from the Water They commonly sit on Rocks at some distance from the shore where they may look about them They seem to be very melancholy Fowls by their perching all alone they sit as if they were sleeping holding their Heads upright and resting the ends of their  Bills on their Breast they are better Meat than Boobies or MenofWarBirds  Cormorants are just like young Ducks in shape having such Feet and Bills They are black with white Breasts and live on small Fish which they take near the shore or on Worms which they get out of the Mud at low Water They taste very fishy yet are indifferent good Meat they being very fat  Fishing Hawks are like our smallest sort of Hawks in colour and shape with such Bills and Talons They perch upon stumps of Trees or dry Limbs that hang over the Water about Creeks Rivers or against the Sea and upon sight of any small Fish near them they Skim along just over them and snatching up the Prey with their Talons presently rise again without touching the Water with their Wings They don't swallow the Fish whole as all other Fishing Fowls that ever I saw do but tear it with their Bills and eat it PieceMeal  The Lagunes Creeks and Rivers are plentifully stored with great variety of Fish  viz  Mullets Snooks Tenpounders Tarpoms Cavallies Parricootas Garfish Stingrays Spanish Mackril with many others  Tenpounders are shaped like Mullets but are so full of very small stiff Bones intermixt with the Flesh that you can hardly eat them  Parricootas are long Fish with round Bodies like Mackril They have very long Mouths and sharp Teeth they are about or Inches round and three Foot and half long They commonly haunt in Lagunes among Islands or in the Sea near the shore They are a floating Fish and greedily take the Hook and will snap at Men too in the Water We commonly take them when we are under sail with a Hook towing after our Stern They are firm welltasted Fish but 'tis dangerous  eating them for some Men have been poisoned with them  Divers Persons are of Opinion that these Creatures are poysonous in some Places only and that but at some times of the Year I know that in many Parts of the  WestIndies  some have been injured by eating them and that at different Seasons of the Year therefore Seamen commonly taste the Liver before they venture any further and if that has a biting taste like Pepper they esteem the fish unwholsom but if not they eat it and yet I have found even this Rule fail too I judge the Head and the Parts near it to be chiefly venomous  Garfish are round but neither so big nor long as the former but what is more peculiar they have long bony Snouts like the Swordfish only as the Swordfishes Snout is flat and indented like a Saw on each side so on the contrary these have their Snouts like a Spear round smooth and sharp at the end and about a foot long These area sort of floaty or Flying Fish for they skip along a Foot or two above the Water for the length of twenty or thirty Yards then they just touch the edge of the Water and spring forward so much farther and them touch the Water and spring forward again a great many times before they cease They dart themselves with such a force that they strike their Snout through the sides of a CottonTree Canoa and we often fear that they will strike quite through our very BodiesThey are extraordinary sweet Fish  Spanish Mackril are in shape and colour like our Mackril but larger They are three Foot or three and half long and nine or ten Inches about and they also are generally esteemed very excellent Fish  The Ray is a flat Fish like Skate and I have seen three sorts of them  viz  the Stingray the Raspray and the Whipray The Stingray and Raspray are much a like in shape but the former has three or four strong sharp Prickles near two Inches long at the Root of its Tail which are said to be very venomous but the rest of his Skin is smooth The Raspray has a rough knotty Skin wherewith Rasps are made the Skins of the largest are so rough that the Spaniards in some Places grate their Cassavy with them which is a Root very common all over the  WestIndies  and of which the Spaniards and English frequently make their Bread but the fairest Skins are used to cover Surgeons Instrument Cases and other such fine Things but of late they are counterfeited I have been told that in  Turkey  Asses Skins are stamped with small hard Seeds which gives them Impressions like Raspray  The Whipray differs from the other two sorts having a small but longer Tail and ending with a Knob shaped like a Harpoon All these three sorts are much about a Foot and half broad There is yet another sort of these flat Fish of the Whipray kind but of a prodigious bigness  viz  three or four Yards square and their Tails as long these we call SeaDevils they are very strong Fish and are sometimes Gamesom but they make an odd Figure when they leap out of the Water tumbling over and over  Neither are Turtle and Manatee wanting in this Lagune Here are some HawksbillTurtle but the green Turtle is most plentiful They are of a middle size yet here was once a very large one taken as I have mentioned in my  Voyages round the World  Here are abundance of Manatee which are both large and sweet  Alligators are also in great numbers in all the Creeks Rivers and Lagunes in the Bay of  Campeachy  and I think that no part of the Universe is better stock'd with them  The Alligator is a Creature so well known every where that I should not describe it were it not to give an Account of the difference between it and the Crocodile for they resemble each other so nearly in their shape and bulk as also in their Natures that they are generally mistaken for the same Species only the one supposed to be the Male the other the Female Whether they are so or not the World may judge by the following Observations As to their Bulk and length I never saw any so large as some I have heard and read of but according to my best Judgment though I have seen Thousands I never met with any above sixteen or seventeen Foot long and as thick as a large Colt He his shaped like a Lizard of a dark brown colour with a large head and very long Jaws with great strong Teeth especially two of a Remarkable Length that grow out of and at the very end of the under Jaw in the smallest part on each side one there are two holes in the upper Jaw to receive these otherways he could not shut his Mouth It has short Legs and Broad Claws with a long Tail The Head Back and Tail is fenced with pretty hard Scales joyned together with a very thick tough Skin Over its Eyes there are two hard scally Knobs as big as a Mans Fist and from the Head to the Tail along the Ridge of his Back 'tis full of such knotty hard Scales not like FishScales which are loose but so united to the Skin that it is all one with it and can't be taken asunder but with a sharp Knife From the Ridge of the Back down on the Ribs towards the Belly which is of a dusky yellow colour like a Frog there are many of these Scales but not so substantial nor so thick placed as the other  These Scales are no hindrance to him in turning for he will turn very quick considering his length When he goes on Land his Tail drags on the Ground  The Flesh smells very strong of Musk especially four Kernels or Cods that are always found about them two of which grow in the Groin near each Thigh the other two at the Breast one under each Foreleg and about the bigness of a Pullets Egg therefore when we kill an Alligator we take out these and having dried them wear them in our Hats for a perfume The Flesh is seldom eaten but in case of Necessity because of it strong scent  Now the Crocodile hath none of these Kernels neither doth his Flesh taste at all Musky therefore esteemed better Food He is of a yellow colour neither hath he such long Teeth in his under Jaw The Crocodile's Legs also are longer and when it runs on Land it bears its Tail above the Ground and turns up the tip of it in a round bow and the Knots on the back are much thicker higher and firmer than those of the Alligator and differ also as to the Places where they are found For in some Parts as here in the Bay of  Campeachy  are abundance of Alligators where yet I never saw nor heard of any Crocodiles At the Isle  Grand Caymanes  there are Crocodiles but no Alligators At  Pines  by  Cuba  there are abundance of Crocodiles but I cannot say there are no Alligators tho' I never saw any there Both Kinds are called  Caymanes  by the Spaniards therefore probably they may reckon them for the same And I know of no other difference for they both lay Eggs alike which are not distinguishable to the Eye They are as big as a GooseEgg but much longer and good Meat yet the Alligators Eggs taste very musky They prey both alike in either Element  for they love Flesh as well as Fish and will live in either fresh or salt Water Beside these Creatures I know none that can live any where or upon any sort of Food like them 'Tis reported that they love Dogs Flesh better than any other Flesh whatsoever This I have seen with my own Eyes that our Dogs were so much afraid of them that they would not very willingly drink at any great River or Creek where those Creatures might lurk and hide themselves unless they were through Necessity constrained to it and then they would stand five or six Foot from the brink of the Creek or River and bark a considerable time before they would Adventure nearer and then even at the sight of their own Shadows in the Water they would again retire to the Place from whence they came and bark vehemently a long time so that in the dry Season when there was no fresh Water but in Ponds and Creeks we used to fetch it our selves and give it our Dogs and many times in our Hunting when we came to a large Creek that we were to pass through our Dogs would not follow us so that we often took them in our Arms and carried them over  Besides the forementioned difference between the Alligator and Crocodile the latter is accounted more fierce and daring then the Alligator Therefore when we go to the Isles of  Pines  or  Grand Caymanes  to hunt we are often molested by them especially in the Night But in the Bay of  Campeachy  where there are only Alligators I did never know any Mischief done by them except by accident Men run themselves into their Jaws I remember one Instance of this Nature which is as follows  In the very height of the dry time seven or eight Men English and Irish went to a place called  Pies Pond  on  BeefIsland  to hunt This Pond was never dry so that the Cattle drew hither in swarms but after two or three days hunting they were shy and would not come to the Pond till Night and then if an Army of Men had lain to oppose them they would not have been debarr'd of Water The Hunters knowing their Custom lay still all Day and in the Night visited this Pond and killed as many Beefs as they could This Trade they had driven a Week and made great profit At length an Irishman going to the Pond in the Night stumbled over an Alligator that lay in the Path The Alligator seized him by the Knee at which the Man cries out  Help help  His Consorts not knowing what the matter was ran all away from their Huts supposing that he was fallen into the Clutches of some  Spaniards  of whom they were afraid every dry Season But poor  Daniel  not finding any assistance waited till the Beast opened his Jaw to take better hold because it is usual for the Alligator to do so and then snatch'd away his Knee and slipt the Butend of his Gun in the room of it which the Alligator griped so hard that he pull'd it out of his Hand and so went away The Man being near a small Tree climb'd up out of his reach and then cried out to his Consorts to come and assist him who being still within Call and watching to hear the Issue of the Alarum made haste to him with Firebrands in their Hands and brought him away in their Arms to his Hut for he was in a deplorable condition and not able to stand on his Feet his Knee was so torn with the Alligators Teeth  His Gun was found the next day ten or twelve Paces from the place where he was seized with  two large Holes made in the Butend of it one on each side near an Inch deep for I saw the Gun afterwards This spoiled their sport for a time they being forc'd to carry the Man to the Island  Trist  where their Ships were which was six or seven Leagues distant  This Irishman went afterwards to  NewEngland  to be cured in a Ship belonging to  Boston  and nine or ten Months after returned to the Bay again being recovered of his Wound but went limping ever after  This was all the

Campanies building their Huts close by the Creeks sides for the benefit of the SeaBreezes as near the Logwood Groves as they can removing often to be near their Business yet when they are settled in a good open Place they chuse rather to go half a Mile in their Canoas to work than lose that convenience Tho' they build their Huts but slightly yet they take care to thatch them very well with Palm or Palmeto Leaves to prevent the Rains which are there very violent from soaking in  For their Bedding they raise a Barbecue or wooden Frame Foot and a half above Ground on one side of the House and stick up four Stakes at each corner one to fasten their Pavilions out of which here is no sleeping for Moskitoes  Another Frame they raise covered with Earth for a Hearth to dress their Victuals and a third to sit at when they eat it  During the wet Season the Land where the Logwood grows is so overflow'd that they step from their Beds into the Water perhaps two Foot deep and continue standing in the wet all Day till they go to Bed again but nevertheless account it the best Season in the Year for doing a good days Labour in  Some fell the Trees others saw and cut them into convenient Logs and one chips off the Sap and he is commonly a principal Man and when a Tree is so thick that after it has lodg'd it remains still too great a Burthen for one Man we blow it up with Gunpowder  The LogwoodCutters are generally sturdy strong Fellows and will carry Burthens of three or four hundred Weight but every Man is left to his choice to carry what he pleaseth and commonly they agree very well about it For they are contented to labour very hard  But when Ships come from  Jamaica  with Rum and Sugar they are too apt to mispend both their Time and Money If the Commanders of these Ships are Free and treat all that come the first Day with Punch they will be much respected and every Man will pay honestly for what he drinks afterwards but if he be niggardly they will pay him with their worst Wood and commonly they have a stock of such lay'd by for that purpose nay they will cheat them with hollow Wood fill'd with dirt in the middle and both ends plugg'd up  with a piece of the same drove in hard and then sawed off so neatly that it's hard to find out the deceit but if any Man come to purchase with Bills payable at  Jamaica  they will be sure to give him the best Wood  In some places especially in the West Creek of the West Lagune they go a hunting every  Saturday  to provide themselves with Beef for the Week following  The Cattle in this Country are large and fat in  February March  and  April  At other times of the Year they are sleshy but not fat yet sweet enough When they have kill'd a Beef they cut it into four Quarters and taking out all the Bones each Man makes a hole in the middle of his Quarter just big enough for his Head to go through then puts it on like a Frock and trudgeth home and if he chances to tire he cuts off some of it and flings it away  It is a diversion pleasant enough though not without some danger to hunt in a Canoa for then the Cattle having no other feeding Places than the sides of the Savannahs which are somewhat higher Ground than the middle they are forced sometimes to swim so that we easily come to shoot them when they are thus in the Water  The Beast when she is so hard pursued that she cannot escape turns about and comes full tilt at the Canoa and striking her Head against the Prow drives her back or Paces then she scampers away again But if she has received a wound she commonly pursues us till she is knock'd down Our chiefest care is to keep the head of the Canoa towards her for if she should strike against the broad side it would indanger oversetting it and consequently wetting our Arms and Ammunition Besides the Savannahs at this time swarm with Alligators and therefore are the more dangerous on that account  These Creatures in the wet Season forsake the Rivers and inhabit the DrowndSavannahs to meet with Purchase and no Flesh comes amiss to them whether alive or dead Their chief Subsistence then is on young Cattle or such Carkasses as we leave behind us which in the Dry Season feed the CarrionCrows but now are a Prey to the Alligators They remain here till the Water drains off from the Land and then confine themselves to the Stagnant Ponds and when they are dry they ramble away to some Creek or River  The Alligators in this  Bay  are not so fierce as they are reported to be in other Places for I never knew them pursue any Man although we do frequently meet them nay they will flee from us and I have drank out of a Pond in the dry time that hath been full of them and the Water not deep enough to cover their backs and the compass of the Pond so small that I could get no Water but by coming within two Yards of the Alligators Nose they lying with their Heads towards mine as I was drinking and looking on me all the while Neither did I ever hear of any bit in the Water by them tho' probably should a Man happen in their way they would seize upon him  Having thus given some Description of the Country I shall next give an Account of my Living with the LogwoodMen and of several Occurrences that happened during my stay here  Tho' I was a Stranger to their Employment and manner of Living as being known but to those few only of whom we bought our Wood in my former Voyage hither yet that little Acquaintance I then got incouraged me to visit them after my second arrival here being in hopes to strike in to work with them There were six in Company who had a Hundred Tuns ready cut log'd and chip'd but not brought to the Creeks side and they  expected a Ship from  NewEngland  in a Month or two to fetch it away  When I came hither they were beginning to bring it to the Creek And because the Carriage is the hardest Work they hired me to help them at the rate of a Tun of Wood  per  Month promising me that after his Carriage was over I should strike in to work with them for they were all obliged in Bonds to procure this Tuns jointly together but for no more  This Wood lay all in the Circumference of or Yards and about from the Creekside in the middle of a very thick Wood unpassable with Burthens The first thing we did was to bring it all to one Place in the middle and from thence we cut a very large Path to carry it to the Creeks side We laboured hard at this Work Days in the Week and on Saturdays went into the Savannahs and killed Beeves  When we killed a Beef if there were more than four of us the Overplus went to seek fresh Game whilst the rest dress'd it  I went out the first Sunday and complyed very well with my Master's Orders which was only to help drive the Cattle out of the Savannahs into the Woods where two or three Men lay to shoot them And having kill'd our Game we marched Home with our Burthens The next Saturdy after I went with a design to kill a Beef my self thinking it more honour to try my own Skill in Shooting than only to drive the Game for others to shoot at We w  t now to a Place called the  Upper Savannah  going four Miles in our Canoas and then landing walk'd one Mile thro' the Woods before we came into the Savannah and marched about two Miles in it before we came up with any Game Here I gave my Companions the slip and wandred so far into the Woods that I lost my self neither could I find the  way into the open Savannah but instead of that ran directly from it through small spots of Savannahs and Skirts of Woods This was sometime in  May  and it was between ten a Clock and one when I began to find that I was as we called it I suppose from the Spaniards  Morooned  or Lost and quite out of the Hearing of my Comrades Guns I was somewhat surpriz'd at this but however I knew I should find my way out as soon as the Sun was a little lower So I sat down to rest my self resolving however to run no farther out of my way for the Sun being so near the Zenith I could not distinguish how to direct my Course Being weary and almost faint for want of Water I was forced to have recourse to the WildPines and was by them supplied or else I must have perished with Thirst About three a Clock I went due North as near as I could judge for the Savannah lay East and West and I was on the South side of it  At Sunset I got into the clear open Savannah being about two Leagues wide in most Places but how long I know not It is well stored with Bullocks but by frequent hunting they grow shy and remove farther up into the Country Here I found my self four or five Mile to the West of the Place where I stragled from my Companions I made homewards with all the speed I could but being overtaken by the Night I lay down on the Grass a good distance from the Woods for the benefit of the Wind to keep the Muskitoes from me but in vain for in less than an Hours time I was so persecuted that though I endeavoured to keep them off by Fanning my self with Boughs and shifting my Quarters or times yet still they haunted me so that I could get no sleep At Daybreak I got up and directed my Course to the Creek where we landed from which I was then about two Leagues I did not see one Beast of any  sort whatever in all the way though the day before I saw several Young Calves that could not follow their Dams but even these were now gone away to my great Vexation and Disappointment for I was very hungry But about a Mile farther I spied ten or twelve Quams perching on the Boughs of a CottonTree These were not shy therefore I got well enough under them and having a single Bullet but no shot about me fired at one of them but miss'd it though I had before often kill'd them so Then I came up with and fired at or Turkies but with no better success So that I was forced to march forward still in the Savannah toward the Creek and when I came to the Path that led to it through the Woods I found to my great Joy a Hat stuck upon a Pole and when I came to the Creek I found another These were set up by my Consorts who were gone home in the Evening as Signals that they would come and fetch me Therefore I sat down and waited for them for although I had not then above three Leagues home by Water yet it would have been very difficult if not impossible for me to have got thither over Land by reason of those vast unpassable Thickets abounding every where along the Creeks side wherein I have known some puzzled for two or three days and have not advanced half a Mile though they laboured extreamly every day Neither was I disappointed of my hopes for within half an Hour after my arrival at the Creek my Consorts came bringing every Man his Bottle of Water and his Gun both to hunt for Game and to give me notice by Firing that I might here them for I have known several Men lost in the like manner and never heard of afterwards  Such an Accident befel one Captain  Hall  of  NewEngland  who came hither in a  Boston  Ship to take in Logwood and was fraighted by two Scotchmen  and one Mr  W Cane  an Irishman who designing to go with Goods from  Jamaica  to  NewEngland  for that reason when his Logwood was aboard tarried at  Trist  with the Ship and hunted once in or three Days for Beef to lengthen out his Salt Provision One Morning the Captain designing to hunt took five of his Men with his Mate as also his Merchant Mr  Cane  along with him They Landed at the East end of the Island which is low  Mangroveland  the Savannah is a considerable distance from the Sea and therefore troublesom to get to it However unless they would row four or five Leagues farther they could not find a more convenient place beside they doubted not of Mr  Canes  skill to conduct them After they had followed him a Mile or two into the Woods the Captain seeing him to make a Halt as being in some doubt to consider of the way told him in derision that he was but a sorry Woodsman and that he would swing him but twice round and he should not guess the way out again and saying no more to him went forwards and bid his Seamen follow him which they did accordingly Mr  Cane  after he had recollected himself struck off another way and desired them to go with him But instead of that they were all for following the Captain In a short time Mr  Cane  got out of the Woods into the Savannah and there kill'd a good fat Cow and quartering it made it fit for Carriage supposing the Captain and Crew would soon be with him But after waiting or hours and firing his Gun several times without hearing any Answer took up his Burden and returned towards the Seaside and upon giving a Signal a Boat came and brought him aboard In the Mean time the Captain and his Men after or Hours ranging the Woods began to grow tired and then his Mate happily trusting more to his own Judgment left him and the four Seamen and about  four or five a Clock being almost spent with Thirst got out of the Woods to the Sea shore and as weak as he was fired his Gun for the Boat to fetch him which was immediately done  When he came Aboard he gave an Account whereabout and in what a condition he left the Captain and his Men but it being then too late to seek him the next Morning very early Mr  Cane  and two Seamen taking Directions from the Mate who was so fatigued that he could not stir where he had left the Captain went ashore and at length came within call of him and at last found him laid down in a Thicket having just sense to call out sometimes but not strength enough to stand so they were forced to carry him to the Seaside When they had a little refreshed him with Brandy and Water he told them how his Company had fainted for Thirst and drop'd down one after another though he still incouraged them to be chearful and rest themselves a while till he got some supplies of Water for them that they were very patient and that two of his Men held out till five a Clock in the Afternoon and then they fainted also but he himself proceeded in quest of his way till night and then fell down in the place where they then found him  The two Seamen carried the Captain Aboard while Mr  Cane  scarched about for the rest but to no purpose for he returned without them and could never hear of them afterwards  This was a warning to me never to straggle from my Consorts in our Hunting But to proceed  When my Months Service was up in which time we brought down all the Wood to the Creek side I was presently pay'd my Tun of Logwood with which and some more that I borrow'd I bought a little Provision and was afterwards entertained as a  Companion at work with some of my former Masters for they presently broke up Consortships letting the Wood lye till either Mr  West  came to fetch it according to his Contract or else till they should otherwise dispose of it Some of them immediately went to  BeefIsland  to kill Bullocks for their Hides which they preserve by pegging them out very tite on the Ground First they turn the fleshy side and after the hair upwards letting them lye so till they are very dry strong Pegs as big as a Man's Arm are required to stretch the Hide as it ought to be When they are dry they fold them in the middle from Head to Tail with the Hair outward and then hang them cross a strong pole so high that the ends may not touch the Ground or one upon another and once in Weeks or a Month they beat them with great Sticks to strike off the Worms that breed in the Hair and eat it off which spoils the Hide When they are to be ship'd off they soak them in salt Water to kill the remaining Worms and while they are yet wet they fold them in folds and afterwards spread them abroad again to dry When they are fully dry they fold them up again and so send them Aboard I was yet a Stranger to this Work therefore remained with of the old Crew to cut more Logwood My Consorts were all three Scotchmen one of them named  Price Morrice  had lived there some Years and was Master of a pretty large Periago for without some sort of Boat here is no stirring from one place to another The other two were young Men that had been bred Merchants  viz  Mr  Duncam Campbell  and Mr  George  These two not liking either the Place or Employment waited an opportunity of going away by the first Ship that came hither to take in Logwood Accordingly not long after the abovementioned Capt  Hall  of  Boston  came hither on that design and was  fraighted by them with Tun It was agreed that  George  should stay behind to cut Logwood but  Campbell  should go to  NewEngland  to sell this Cargo and bring back Flower and such other Commodities that were proper to purchase Hides and Logwood in the Bay This retarded our business for I did not find  Price Morrice  very intent at Work for 'tis like he thought he had Logwood enough And I have particularly observed there and in other Places that such as had been wellbred were generally most careful to improve their Time and would be very industrious and frugal when there was any probability of considerable Gain But on the contrary such as had been inur'd to hard Labour and got their Living by the sweat of their Brows when they came to a plenty would extravagantly squander away their Time and Money in Drinking and making a Bluster  To be short I kept to my Work by my self till I was hindred by a hard red and angry Swelling like a Boyl in my right Leg so painful that I was scarce able to stand on it but I was directed to roast and apply the Roots of White Lillies of which here is great plenty growing by the Creek sides to draw it to a head This I did three or four Days without any benefit At last I perceived two White Specks in the middle of the Boil and squeezing it two small white Worms spurted out I took them both up in my Hand and perceived each of them to be invested with three Rows of black short stiff Hair running clear round them one Row near each end the other in the middle each Row distinct from other and all very regular and uniform The Worms were about the bigness of a Hens Quill and about three fourths of an Inch long  I never saw Worms of this sort breed in any Man's Flesh Indeed  Guinea Worms  are very frequent in some Places of the  WestIndies  especially at  Curasao  They breed as well in Whites as Negroes And because that Island was formerly a Magazin of Negroes while the Dutch drove that Trade with the Spaniards and the Negroes were most subject to them 'twas therefore believed that other People took them by Infection from them I rather judge that they are generated by drinking bad Water and 'tis as likely that the Water of the other Island of  Aruba  and  Bonariry  may produce the same Effects for many of those that went with me from thence to  Virginia  mentioned in my former Volume were troubled with them after our arrival there particularly I my self had one broke out in my Ancle after I had been there five or six Months  These Worms are no bigger than a large brown Thread but as I have heard five or six Yards long and if it breaks in drawing out that part which remains in the Flesh will putrifie and be very painful and indanger the Patients Life or at least the use of that Limb and I have known some that have been scarified and cut strangely to take out the Worm I was in great torment before it came out my Leg and Ancle swell'd and look'd very red and angry and I kept a Plaister to it to bring it to a Head At last drawing off my Plaister out came about three Inches of the Worm and my pain abated presently Till then I was Ignorant of my Malady and the Gentlewoman at whose House I was took it for a Nerve but I knew enough what it was and presently roll'd it up on a small Stick After that I opened it every Morning and Evening and strained it out gently about Inches at a time not without some pain till at length I had got out about two Foot  Riding with one Mr  Richardson  who was going to a Negro to have his Horse cured of a gall'd Back I asked the Negro if he could undertake my Leg and which he did readily and in the mean  time I observed his Method in curing the Horse which was this First he strok'd the sore Place then applying to it a little rough Powder which looked like Tobacco Leaves dryed and crumbled small and mumbling some Words to himself he blew upon the part three times and waving his Hands as often over it said it would be well speedily His Fee for the Cure was a White Cock  Then coming to me and looking on the Worm in my Ancle he promised to cure it in three Days demanding also a White Cock for his pains and using exactly the same Method with me as he did with the Horse He bad me not open it in three Days but I did not stay so long for the next Morning the Cloath being rubb'd off I unbound it and found the Worm broken off and the Hole quite healed up I was afraid the remaining part would have given some trouble but have not felt any pain there from that day to this  To return I told you how I was interrupted in following my Work by the Worms breeding in my Leg And to compleat my misfortune presently after we had the most violent Storm for above Hours that ever was known in these Parts An Account of which I shall give more particularly in my  Discourse of Winds  and shall now only mention some Passages  I have already said we were four of us in Company at this Place cutting Logwood and by this Storm were reduced to great Inconveniencies for while that lasted we could dress no Victuals no  even now it was over unless we had done it in the Canoa for the highest Land near us was almost Foot under Water besides our Provision too was most of it spoiled except the Beef and Pork which was but little the worse  We had a good Canoa large enough to carry us all and seeing it in vain to stay here any longer we  all embarked and rowed away to  OneBushKey  about Leagues from our Huts There were Ships riding here when the Storm began but at our arrival we found only one and hoped to have got some Refreshment from it but found very cold entertainment For we could neither get Bread nor Punch nor so much as a Dram of Rum though we offered them Money for it The Reason was they were already overcharged with such as being distressed by the Storm had been forced to take Sanctuary with them Seeing we could not be supplied here we asked which way the other three Ships were driven they told us that Capt  Prout  of  NewEngland  was driven towards  Trist  and 'twas probable he was carried out to Sea unless he struck on a Sand called the  Middle Ground  that Capt  Skinner  of  NewEngland  was driven towards  BeefIsland  and Captain  Chandler  of  London  drove away towards  ManofWar Lagune  BeefIsland  lies North from  OneBushKey  but the other two Places lie a little on each side One to the East the other to the West So away we went for  BeefIsland  and coming within a League of it we saw a Flag in the Woods made fast to a Pole and placed on the Top of a high Tree And coming still nearer we at last saw a Ship in the Woods about Yards from the Sea We rowed directly towards her and when we came to the Woods side found a pretty clear Passage made by the Ship through the Woods the Trees being all broke down and about three Foot Water Home to the Ship We rowed in with our Canoa and went aboard and were kindly Entertained by the Seamen but the Captain was gone Aboard Captain  Prout  who stuck fast on the middle Ground beforementioned Captain  Prout  's Ship was afterwards got off again but the Stumps of the Trees ran clear through the bottom of Captain  Skinner  's therefore there was no hope of saving her Here we got Victuals and Punch and stayed about two Hours in which time the Captain came aboard and invited us to stay all Night But hearing some Guns fired in  ManofWar Lagune  we concluded that Captain  Chandler  was there and wanted assistance Therefore we presently rowed away thither for we could do no Service here and before Night found him also stuck fast on a Point of Sand The Head of his Ketch was dry and at the Stern there was above foot Water Our coming was very seasonable to Captain  Chandler  with whom we stayed two Days in which time we got out all his Goods carried off his Anchor c and so not being able as yet to do him more Service we left him for the present and went away to hunt at  BeefIsland  At  Trist  were four Vessels riding before this Storm one of them was driven off to Sea and never heard of afterwards Another was cast dry upon the shore where she lay and was never got off again But the third rode it out Another was riding without the Bar of  Trist  and she put to Sea and got to  NewEngland  but much shattered About  days before this Storm began a small Vessel Commanded by Captain  Vally  went hence bound to  Jamaica  This Vessel was given for lost by all the LogwoodCutters but about Months after she returned thither again and the Captain said he felt nothing of the Storm but when he was about Leagues to Windward of  Trist  he had a fresh  Summasenta Wind  that carried him as high as  Cape Condecedo  but all the time he saw very black Clouds to the Westward  BeefIsland  is about Leagues long and or broad It lies in length East and West The East end looks toward the Island  Trist  and is low drowned Land and near the Sea produceth nothing but  white and black MangroveTrees The North side lies open to the Main Sea running straight from East to West The Eastermost part for about three Leagues from  Trist  is Low and Mangrovy at the end of which there is a small salt Creek deep enough at high Water for Boats to pass  From this Creek to the West end is Leagues all sandy Bay closed on the backside with a low Sandbank abounding with thick prickly Bushes like a Whitethorn bearing a whitish hard shellFruit as big as a Sloe much like a Callabash The West end is washed with the River St  Peter  St  Paul  This end is overgrown with red Mangroves About Leagues up from the Mouth of this River shoots forth a small Branch running to the Eastward and dividing  BeefIsland  from the Main on the South and afterwards makes a great Lake of fresh Water called  Fresh Water Lagune  This afterward falls into a Salt Lake called  ManofWar Lagune  which empties it self into  Laguna Termina  about Leagues from the South East Point of the Island  The inside or middle of this Island is a Savannah bordered all round with Trees most Mangrovy either black white or red with some Logwood  The South side between the Savannahs and the Mangroves is very rich Some of this Land lyes in Ridges higher than the Savannahs  The Savannahs produce plenty of long Glass and the Ridges curious high flourishing Trees of divers sorts  The Fruits of this Island are  Penguins  both red and yellow  Guavers Sapadilloes Limes Oranges  c These last but lately planted here by a Colony of  Indians  who revolted from the Spaniards and settled here  It is no new thing for the Indians in these Woody Parts of  America  to fly away whole Towns at once and settle themselves in the unfrequented  Woods to enjoy their Freedom and if they are accidentally discovered they will remove again which they can easily do their HousholdGoods being little else but their Cotton Hammacks and their Callabashes They build every Man his own House and tye up their Hammacks between two Trees wherein they sleep till their Houses are made The Woods afford them some Subsistance as  Pecary  and  Warree  but they that are thus stroling or  morooning  as the Spaniards call it have PlantainWalks that no Man knows but themselves and from thence they have their Food till they have raised Plantation Provision near their Newbuilt Town They clear no more Ground than what they actually employ for their Subsistance They make no Paths but when they go far from Home they break now and then a Bough letting it hang down which serves as a Mark to guide them in their return If they happen to be discovered by other Indians inhabiting still among the Spaniards or do but mistrust it they immediately shift their Quarters to another Place This large Country affording them good fat Land enough and very Woody and therefore a proper Sanctuary for them  It was some of these fugitive Indians that came to live at  BeefIsland  where besides gaining their Freedom from the Spaniards they might see their Friends and Accquaintances that had been taken some time before by the Privateers and sold to the LogwoodCutters with whom some of the Women lived still though others of them had been conducted by them to their own HabitationsIt was these Women after their return made known the Kind Entertainment that they met with from the English and perswaded their Friends to leave their Dwellings near the Spaniards and settle on this Island and they had been here almost a Year before they were discovered by the English and even then were accidentally  found out by the Hunters as they followed their Game They were not very shy all the time I lived there but I know that upon the least disgust they would have been gone  The Animals of this Island are  Squashes  in abundance  Porcupines Guanoes Possomes Pecary Deer Horses  and  Horn Cattle  This Island does properly belong to  John d' Acosta  a Spaniard of  Campeachy  Town who possess'd it when the English first came hither to cut Logwood His Habitation was then at the Town of  Campeachy  but in the dry Season he used to come hither in a Bark with six or seven Servants and spend two or three Months in hocksing and killing Cattle only for their Hides and Tallow  The English LogwoodCutters happened once to come hither whilst  John d' Acosta  was there and he hearing their Guns made towards them and desired them to forbear firing because it would make the Cattle wild but told them that any time when they wanted Beef if they sent to him he would hor as many as they pleased and bring the Meat to their Canoas The  English  thankfully accepted his Offer and did never after shoot his Cattle but sent to him when they wanted and he according to his Promise supplied them This created him so much Friendship that they intended when they returned to  Jamaica  to bring him a present and Goods also to Trade with him which would have been very Advantagious to both Parties but some of his Servants acquainted the Townsmen of it at his return to  Campeachy  And they being Jealous of the English and envying him complained to the Governour who presently cast him into Prison where he remained many Years This happened about the Year or Thus the Project of Trading with the English miscarried here and  John d' Acosta  was forced to relinquish his Right of this  s  nt and profitable Island leaving it wholly to the English for neither he nor any other Spaniard ever came hither afterward to hocks Cattle  This way of Hocksing Bullocks seems peculiar to the  Spaniards  especially to those that live hereabouts who are very dextrous at it For this Reason some of of them are constantly employed in it all the Year and so become very expert The  Hockser  is mounted on a good Horse bred up to the Sport who knovv so well vvhen to advance or retreat upon occasion that the Rider has no trouble to manage him His Arms is a Hocksing Iron which is made in the shape of a Half Moon and from one corner to the other is about or Inches vvith a very sharp Edge  This Iron is fastned by a Socket to a Pole about or Foot long When the Hockser is mounted he lays the Pole over the Head of his Horse with the Iron forward and then rides after his Game and having overtaken it strikes his Iron just above the Hock and Hamstrings it The Horse presently wheels off to the left for the wounded Beast makes at him presently with all his force but he scampers away a good distance before he comes about again If the Hamstring is not quite cut asunder with the stroke yet the Bullock by continual springing out his Leg certainly breaks it and then can go but on three Legs yet still limps forward to be revenged on his Enemy Then the Hockser rides up softly to him and strikes his Iron into the Knee of one of his foreLegs and then he immediately tumbles down He gets off his Horse and taking a sharppointed strong Knife strikes it into his Pole a little behind the Horns so dextrously that at one blow he cuts the string of his Neck and down falls his Head This they call  Poling  Then the Hockser immediately Mounts and Rides after more Game leaving the other to the  Skinners who are at hand and ready to take off his Hide  The right Ear of the HocksingHorse by the weight of the Pole lay'd constantly over it when on Duty hangs down always by which you may know it from other Horses  The  Spaniards  pick and chufe only the Bulls and old Cows and leave the young Cattle to breed by which means they always preserve their Stock entire On the contrary the  English  and  French  kill without distinction yea the young rather than the old without regard of keeping up their Stock  Jamaica  is a remarkable Instance of this our Folly in this Particular For when it was first taken by the  English  the Savannahs were well stockt with Cattle but were soon all destroy'd by our Souldiers who suffered great Hardships afterwards for it and it was never stock'd again till Sir  Thomas Linch  was Governour He sent to  Cuba  for a supply of Cattle which are now grown very plentiful because every Man knows his own proper Goods Whereas before when there was no Property each Man destroyed as fast as he could The  French  I think are greater Destroyers than the  English  Had it not been for the great care of the  Spaniards  in Stocking the  West Indies  with Hogs and Bullocks the Privateers must have starved But now the Main as well as the Island is plentiful provided particularly the Bay of  Campeachy  the Islands of  Cuba Pines Hispaniola Portarica  c Where besides wild Hogs there are abundance of Crawls or Hogfarms in some of which I have heard there are no less than This was the main Subsistence of the Privateers  But to return again to  BeefIsland  Our  English  Hunters have much lessened the numbers of the Cattle there And those that are left by constant shooting are now grown so wild and desperate that it  is dangerous for a single Man to fire at them or to venture through the Savannahs For the old Bulls that have been formerly shot will make at him and they will all draw up in Battalia to defend themselves upon our approach the old Bulls in the Front behind them the Cows in the same manner and behind them the young Cattle And if we strive to wheel about to get in the Reer the Bulls will certainly face about that way and still present a Front to us Therefore we seldom strive to shoot any out of a great Herd but walk about in the Woods close by the Savannah and there we light of our Game The Beast makes directly at the Hunter if it be desperately wounded as I have experienced my self but if but slightly they comcomly run away The old Hunters tell us that a Cow is more dangerous of the two because they say she runs at her Enemy with her Eyes open but the Bull shuts his so that you may easily avoid him But this I cannot affirm upon my own knowledge and rather doubt the truth of it for I knew one shrewdly gor'd by a Bull He was a Consort with Mr  Baker  in the West Lagune where having tir'd themselves with cutting of Logwood they took an occasion to go in their Canoa to  BeefIsland  to refresh themselves there a fortnight or three Weeks because here were several sorts of Fruits and plenty of Cabbage to eat with their fresh Beef which they could not fail to meet with They came to a Place call'd the  SaltGreek  and there built them a Hut About a clock while Mr  Baker  lay down to sleep his Consort march'd out into the Savannah about a Mile from their Huts and there coming within shot of a Bull wounded him desperately but yet the Bull had still so much strength left as to pursue and overtake his Adversary trampling on him and goring his Thigh so that he was not able  to rise The Bull by this time was spent and fell down dead by him And there the Man had also perished if Mr  Barker  had not come the next Morning to seek him who finding him by the dead Beast took him on his Back and lug'd him home to their Hut The next day he put him in his Canoa and delivered him aboard a Ship into the hands of a Surgeon who cured him in a little time  I told you we left Capt  Chandler  with a design of going to  BeefIsland  to spend some time in Hunting at  Pies Pond  before mentioned But before we came thither we went a shore to kill a Beef for Supper where I was surprized with an odd accident Passing throught a small Savannah about or Foot deep we smelt a strong scent of an Alligator and presently after I stumbled over one and fell down immediarely I cry'd out for help but my Consorts instead of assisting me ran away towards the Wood I had no sooner got up to follow them but I stumbled on him a second time and a third time also expecting still when I fell down to be devoured Yet at last I got our safe but so frighted that I never cared for going through the Water again as long as I was in the Bay  CHAP IV  The River  St Peter St Paul  The MountainCow and Hippopotamus  Tobasco  Island  Guavers Tobasco  River Manatee  Villa de Mosa Estapo Halapo Tacatalpo de Sierra  Small Bees Indians Tartillos Posole Cotton Garments Early Marriages Towns Festivals Shape and Features  THE River St  Peter  St  Paul  springs from the high Mountains of  Chiapo  about Leagues within the Country which are so called from a City not far distant Its first Course is Easterly for a considerable length till it meets with Mountains on that side then it turns short about Northward till within Leagues of the Sea And lastly it divides its self into two Branches The Western Branch falls into the River  Tobasco  the other keeps its Course till within Leagues of the Sea then divides it self again The Eastermost of these Branches separates  BeefIsland  from the Main and falls into  ManofWar Lagune  as is before related The other keeps its Course and Name till it falls into the Sea between  BeefIsland  and  Tobasco Island  where it is no broader than the  Thames  at  Gravesend  There is a Bar at its Entrance but of what depth I know not over which small Vessels may pass well enough by the Benefit of the Tide It is both deeper and broader after you are in for there it is or Foot Water and very good Riding By Report of the Privateers who have been up this River it is very broad before it  parts and beyond that farther in the Country has divers large Indians Towns built on its Banks the chief of which is called  Summasenta  and many large Cacao and Plantains walks the Soil on each side being very fruitful The unmanur'd Land is overgrown with lofty Trees of many sorts especially the Cotten or Cabbage of the latter there are whole Groves and in some Places especially a little way from the Rivers side great Savannahs full of Bullocks Horses and other Animals amongst which the Mountain Cow called by the Spaniards  Ante  is most remarkable  This Beast is as big as a Bullock of two Years old It is shaped like a Cow in Body but her Head much bigger Her Nose is short and the Head more compact and round She has no Horns Her Eyes are round full and of a prodigious size She has great Lips but not so thick as the Cows Lips Her Ears are in proportion to the Head rather broader than those of the Common Cow Her Neck is thick and short Her Legs also shorter than ordinary She has a pretty long Tail thin of Hairs and no Bob at the end She has course thin Hair all over her Body Her Hide is near two Inches thick Her flesh is red the grain of it very fine The Fat is white and all together it is sweet wholsom Meat One of them will weigh or Weight  This Creature is always found in the Woods near some large River and feeds on a sort of long thin Grass or Moss which grows plentifully on the Banks of Rivers but never feeds in Savannahs or Pastures of good Grass as all other Bullocks do When her Belly is full she lies down to sleep by the brink of the River and at the least Noise slips into the Water where sinking down to the bottom tho' very deep she walks as on dry Ground She cannot run fast therefore never rambles far from the River for there she always takes Sanctuary in case  of danger There is no shooting of her but when she is asleep  They are found beside this Place in the Rivers in the Bay of  Honduras  and on all the Main from thence as high as the River of  Darien  Several of my Consorts have kill'd them there and knew their Track which I my self saw in the Isthmus of  Darien  but should not have known it but as I was told by them For I never did see one nor the Track of any but once The Impression in the Sand seemed much like the Track of a Cow but I was well assured that none of our common Cows could live in that Place neither are there any near it by many Miles  My Consorts than gave me this Relation and since I have had the same from other Englishmen as well as Spaniards  Having shew'd the foregoing Description to a Person of Honour he was pleased to send it to a Learned Frend in  Holland  from whom he received this Answer  SIR  THE Account I have of this Paper from the English Minister at  Leyden  is this The Description of your  SeaCow  agrees with the  Hippopotamus  kept hereso exactly that I take them to be Creatures of the same kind Only this here at  Leyden  is bigger than any Ox For the Eyes Ears and Hair nothing can be said seeing this Skin wants all these The Teeth are worth noticing which are very large and firm and fine as any Ivory  I have spoke with a very Intelligent Person Kinsman to the Burgomaster of  Leyden  who having had that  Hippopotamus  as they call it presented to him made a Present thereof to the University who having viewed that Skin very well saith It's much bigger than  you make yours and cannot weigh less than one Thousand Weight  Let me add of mine own that perhaps they are greater about the  Cape of Good Hope  whence that of  Leyden  came And seeing there are no Horns perhaps it may as well be called a  RiverHorse  as a  RiverCow  But for that it must bear the denomination given it by the People of the Place where they are which may be different in  Africa  and  America  But what he says of her sinking to the bottom in deep Rivers and walking there if he adds what I think he supposes that he rises again and comes on the Land I much question For that such a huge Body should raise it self up again though I know  Whales  and great Fishes can and do transcends the Faith of I H  I readily acknowledge there is some resemblance between this  MonntainCow  of  America  and the  African Hippopotamus  but yet am of Opinion that they must needs be of a different Species for the  MountainCow  is never known to swim out to Sea nor to be found near it and is not above half so big and has no long Teeth But for further satisfaction I have here infected two Accounts of the  African Hippopotamus  as they were sent the one of the Honourable Person beforementioned from Captain  Covent  of  Porbury  near  Bristol  a Gentleman of great Ability and Experience as well as known Integrity who used to Trade to  Angola  The other to my self from my worthy Friend Captain  Rogers  as he has seen them in the River  Natal  in the Latitude of on the East side of the  Cape of Good Hope  The Sea Horse's Head Ears and Nostrils are like our Horses with a short Tail and Legs And his Footsteps in the Sand like a Horses but the Body above  twice as big He grases on the shore and dungs like a Horse Is of a darkbrown but glittering in the Water His pace is but slow on the shore in the Water more swift He there feeds on small Fish and what he can get and will go down to the bottom in Fathom Water For I have watch'd him and he hath staid above half an hour before he arose He is very mischievous to white Men I have known him open his Mouth and set one Tooth on the Gunnel of a Boat and another on the second Strake from the Keel which was more than four foot distant and there bit a hole through the Plank and sunk the Boat and after he had done he went away shaking his Ears His strength is incredibly great for I have seen him in the Wash of the shore when the Sea has tossed in a Dutchman's Boat with Hogsheads of Water in her upon the said Beast and left it dry on his Back and another Sea came and fetch'd the Boat off and the Beast was not hurt as far as I could perceive How his Teeth grow in his Mouth I could not see only that they were round like a Bow and about Inches long and in the biggest part more than Inches about We made several shot at him but to no purpose for they would glance from him as from a Wall The Natives call him a  Kittimpungo  and say he is  Fetisso  which is a kind of a God for nothing they say can kill him And if they should do to him as the White Men do he would soon destroy their Canoas and FishingNets Their Custom is when he comes near their Canoas to throw him Fish and then he passeth away and will not meddle with their Fishing Craft He doth most mischief when he can stand on the Ground but when afloat hath only power to bite As our Boat once lay near the shore I saw him go under her and with his Back lift her out of the Water and overset her with Men aboard but as it happened did them no harm  Whilst we lay in the Road we had three of them which did trouble this Bay every Full and Change and two or three Days after the Natives say they go together two Males and one Female Their Noise is much like the bellowing of a large Calf  This past Remark was made of a SeaHorse at  Loango  in the Year  Captain  Roger  's Letter  SIR  THE  Hippopotamus  or  SeaHorse  lives as well on the Land as in the Sea or in Rivers It is shaped much like an Ox but bigger weighing or  l  This Creature is very full bodied and covered with Hair of a Mouse Colour thick short and of a very beautiful sleekness when he first comes out of the Water The Head is flattish on the top It has no Horns but large Lips a wide Mouth and strong Teeth four of which are longer than the rest  viz  two in the upper Jaw one on each side and two more in the under These last are four or five Inches long the other two are shorter It has large broad Ears great goggle Eyes and is very quick sighted It has a thick Neck and strong Legs but weak Footlocks The Hoofs of his Feet are Cloven in the middle And it has two small Hoofs above the Footlock which bending to the Ground when it goes make an Impression on the Sand like four Claws His Tail is short and tapering like a Swines without any Bob at the end This Beast is commonly fat and very good Meat It grazeth ashore in wet swampy Ground near Rivers or Ponds but retires to the Water if purused When they are in the Water they will sink down to the bottom and there walk as on dry Ground They will run almost as fast as a Man but if chased hard they will turn about and look very fierce like a Boar and fight if put to it The Natives  of the Country have no Wars with these Creatures but we had many Conflicts with them both on Shore and in the Rivers and though we commonly got the better by killing some and routing the rest yet in the Water we durst not molest them after one Bout which bad like to have proved fatal to Men that went in a small Canoa to kill a single SeaHorse in a River where was or Foot Water The Horse according to his Custom was marching in the bottom of the River and being spied by these Men they wounded him with a long Lance which so enraged the Beast that he rose up immediately and giving a fierce look he opened his Jaws and bit a great piece of the G  nal or upper edge of the Canoa and was like to overset it but presently sunk down again to the bottom and the Men made away as fast as they could for fear he should come again  The West branch of the River St  Peter  St  Paul  after it has run or Leagues N W loseth it self in  Tobasco  River about Leagues from the Sea and so makes the Island  Tobasco  which is Leagues long and broad at the North end for from the River St  Peter  St  Paul  to the mouth of  Tobasco  River is accounted Leagues and the Shore lies East and West  The first League on the East is  Mangrove Land  with some Sandy Bay where Turtle come ashore to lay their Eggs  The West part of it is Sandy Bay quite to the River  Tobasco  But because here is constantly a great Sea you have no good Landing till within the  River  The N W part of it is full of  Guaver Trees  of the greatest variety and their Fruit the largest and best tasted I have met with and 'tis really a very delicious Place There are also some  CocoPlums  and  Grapes  but not many The Savannahs here are naturally fenced with Groves of Guavers and produce  good Grass for Pasture and are pretty well stock'd with fat Bullocks and I do believe it is from their eating the Guaver Fruit that these Trees are so thick For this fruit is full of small seeds which being swallowed whole by the Cattle are voided whole by them again and then taking root in their Dung spring up abundantly  Here are also Deer in great numbers these weconstantly find feeding in the Savannahs Mornings and Evenings And I remember an unlucky Accident whilst I was there Two or three Men went out one Evening purposely to hunt when they were in the spots of Savannahs they separated to find their Game and at last it so happened that one of them fired at a Deer and killed it and while he was skinning it he was shot stark dead by one of his Consorts who fired at him mistaking him for a Deer The poor Man was very sorry for so sad a mischance and for fear of the dead Man's Friends durst never go back again to  Jamaica  The River of  Tobasco  is the most noted in all the Bay of  Campeachy  and springs also from the high Mountains of  Chiapo  but much more to the Westward than that of St  Peter  St  Paul  From thence it runs N E till within Leagues of the Sea where it receives the forementioned Branch of St  Peter  St  Paul  and then runs North till it falls into the Sea Its Mouth is about two Miles wide and there is a Bar of Sand lying off it with not above or foot Water but a Mile or two within the Mouth at a nook or bending of the River on the Eastside there is three Fathom and good Riding without any danger from the strength of the Current The Tide flows up about four Leagues in the dry Season but in the Rains not so far for then the Freshes make the Ebb run very strong  During the Norths it overflows all the low Land  for or Leagues up the River and you may then take up fresh Water without the Bar  This River near its Mouth abounds with Catfish with some Snooks and  Manatee  in great plenty there being good feeding for them in many of its Creeks especially in one place on the Starbord side about Leagues from the Sea which runs into the Land or paces and then opens very wide and is so shoal that you may see their backs above Water as they feed a thing so rare that I have heard our  MusketoMen  say they never saw it any where else on the least noise they will all scamper out into the  River  yet the  Musketomen  seldom miss of striking them There are a sort of Freshwater  Manatee  not altogether so big as the Sea kind but otherwise exactly alike in shape and tast and I think rather fatter The Land by the Rivers especially on the Starbord side is swampy and overgrown with Trees  Here are also abundance of Trees the largest that I ever saw till I came to the  Gallapagos  Islands in the S Seas  viz Mangroves Macaws  and other sorts that I know not In some places near the River side further up the Country are Ridges of dry Land full of lofty Cabbage and Cotton Trees which make a very pleasant Landskip There is no Settlement within Leagues of the River's Mouth and then you come to a small Breastwork where there is commonly a  Spaniard  with or  Indians  posted on each side the River to watch for Boats coming that way And because there are divers Creeks running in from the Savannahs some of these Sentinesl are so placed in the Woods that they may look into the Savannahs for fear being surprized on the back side Yet for all their caution these Sentinels were snap'd by  Captain Nevil  Commander of a small  Brigantine  in a second Expedition that he made to take the Town called  Villa de Mose  His  first attempt miscarried by his being discovered But the second time he got into a Creek a League below these Sentinels and there dragging his Canoas over some Trees that were laid cross it purposely to hinder his passage he came in the night upon their backs in their several Post so that the Town having notice of his coming by their firing as they should have done was taking without any ressistance  Villa de Mose  is a small Town standing on the Starboard side of the River Leagues beyond this Breastwork 'Tis inhabited chiefly by  Indians  with some  Spaniards  there is a Church in the middle and a Fort at the West end which commands the River Thus far Ships come to bring goods especially  European  Commodities  viz  Broadcloth Serges Perpetuana's Kersies ThredStockings Hats Osnabrugs white and blew Kentins Platilloes Britannias Hollandilloes Ironwork c They arrive here in  November  or  December  and stay till  June  or  July  selling their Commodities and then load chiefly with  Cacao  and some  Sylvester  All the  Merchants  and petty Traders of the Country Towns come hither about  Christmas  to Traffick which makes this Town the chiefest in all these parts  Campeachy  excepted yet there are but few Rich Men that live here Sometimes Ships that come hither load Hides and Tallow if they cannot fraight with Cacao But the chiefest place for Hides is a Town lying on a Branch of this River that comes out a League below the Breastwork where  Spanish  Barks usually lade once a Year but I can give no further account of it Four Leagues beyond  Villa de Mose  further up the River lies  Estapo  inhabited partly with  Spaniards  but most  Indians  as generally the Towns in this Country are It's said to be pretty rich stands close by the River on the South side and is so built between two Creeks that there is but one Avenue leading to it and so well guarded  with a Breastwork that  Captain Hewet  a Privateer who had under him near Men was there repulsed losing many of them and himself wounded in the Leg In his way thither he took  Villa de Mose  and left a Party there to secure his Retreat If he had taken  Estapo  he designed to pass on to  Halpo  a Rich Town three Leagues farther up the River and from thence to visit  Tacatalpo  lying or Leagues beyond which is accounted the wealthiest of the three the Spaniards call it  Tacatalpo de Sierra  whether to distinguish it from another Town of that name or to denote its nearness to the Mountains I know not 'Tis the best Town on this River having three Chnrches and several Rich Merchants and between it and  Villa de Mose  are many large Cacao Walks on each side the River  I have seen a sort of white Cacao brought from hence which I never met with any where else It is of the same bigness and colour on the outside and with such a thin husky Coat as the other but the inner substance is white like fine Flower and when the outward Coat is broken it crumbles as a lump of Flower doth Those that frequent the Bay call it  Spama  and affirm that it is much used by the  Spaniards  of those parts to make their Chocolate froth who therefore set a great value on it But I never yet met with any in  England  that knew it except the Right Honourable the Earl of  Carbery  who was pleased to tell me he had seen of it  The Land on the South side of the River is low Savannahs or Pasture The side where the Town of  Villa de Mose  stands is a sort of grey sandy Earth and the whole Country the Upland I mean seems to be much the same But the Lowland is of a black deep Mould and in some places very strong Clay and there is not a Stone to be found in all the Country The healthy dry Land is very Woody except where inhabited or planted It is pretty thick settled  with  Indian  Towns who have all a Padre or two among them and a Cacique or  Governour  to keep the Peace The  Cacao Tree  thrives here very well but the Nuts are smaller than the  Caraccus Nuts  yet Oyly and Fat whilst new They are not planted near the Sea as they are on the Coast of  Caraccus  but at least or Miles up in the Country The Cacaowalks belong chiefly to the Spaniards and are only planted and dress'd by Indians hired for that purpose yet the Indians have of their own Plantainwalks Plantations of Maiz and some small Cacaowalks about which they spent the chiefest of their time Some employ themselves to search in the Woods for Bees that build in hollow Trees and get a good livelihood by the Honey and Wax These are of two sorts One pretty large the other no bigger but longer than an ordinary black Fly in other respects just like our common Bees only of a darker colour Their Stings are not strong enough to enter a Man's Skin but if disturbed they will fly at one as furiously as the Great Bees and will tickle but cannot hurt you Their Honey is white and clear and they make a great deal of it The Indians keep of them tame and cut hollow Trunks for them to make their Combs in They place one end of the Log which is saw'd very even on a Board leaving a hole for the Bees to creep in at and the upper end is covered with a Board put close over it The young and lusty Indians such as want Employment hire themselves to the Spaniards They Work cheap and are commonly paid in such Goods as the Spaniards do not value And I have been told that they are obliged to Work for their Masters one day in a Week  gratis  But whether this Priviledge belongs only to the  Padres  or to the Laity also I know not The Indians inhabiting these Villages live like Gentlemen in Comparison  of those that are near any great Town such as  Campeachy  or  Merida  for there even the Poorer and Rascally sort of People that are not able to hire one of these poor Creatures will by violence drag them to do their Drudgery for nothing after they have work'd all day for their Masters nay they often take them out of the Market from their Business or at least enjoyn them to come to their Houses when their Market is ended and they dare not refuse to do it  This Country is very fruitful yelding plentiful Crops of Maiz which is there chiefest Subsistence After it is boiled they bruise it on such a RubbingStone as Chocolate is ground on Some of it they make into small thin Cakes called  Tartilloes  The rest they are put into a Jar till it grows sowr and when they are thirsty mix a handful of it in a Callabash of Water which gives it a sharp pleasant taste then straining it through a large Callabash prick'd full of small Holes to keep out the Husks they drink it off If they treat a Friend with this Drink they mix a little Honey with it for their Ability reaches no higher And this is as acceptable to them as a Glass of Wine to us If they travel for two or three Days from Home they carry some of this ground Maiz in a Plantain Leaf and Callabash at their Girdles to make their drink and take no farther care for Victuals till they come home again This is called  Posole  And by the English  Poorsoul  It is so much esteemed by the Indians that they are never without some of it in their Houses  Another way of Preparing their Drink is to parch the Maiz and then grind it to Powder on the Rubbingstone putting a little  Anatta  to it which grows in their Plantations and is used by them for no other purpose They mix it all  with Water and presently drink it off without straining  In long Journeys they prefer this Drink before Posole  They feed abundance of Turkies Ducks and Dunghill Fowls of which the Padre has an exact Account and is very strict in gathering his Tithe and they dare not kill any except they have his Leave for it  They plant Cotton also for their Cloathing The Men wear only a short Jacket and Breeches These with a PalmetoLeaf Hat is their  Sundays  Dress for they have neither Stockings nor Shoes neither do they wear these Jackets on Week Days The Women have a CottonPetticoat and a large Frock down to their Knees the Sleeves to their Wrists but not gathered The Bosom is open to the Breast and Imbroidered with black or red Silk or Grogram Yarn two Inches broad on each side the Breast and clear round the Neck In this Garb with their Hair ty'd up in a Knot behind they think themselves extream fine  The Men are obliged by the Padres as I have been inform'd to Marry when they are Fourteen Years old and the Women when Twelve And if that Age they are not provided the Priest will chuse a Virgin for the Man or a Man for the Virgin of Equal Birth and Fortune and joyn them together  The Spaniards give several Reasons for this Imposition  viz  That it preserves them from Debaucher and makes them IndustriousThat it brings them to pay Taxes both to the King and Church for as soon as they are Married they pay to bothAnd that it keeps them from rambling out of their own Parish and settling in another which would by so much lessen the Padres  Profit They love each other very well and live comfortably by the sweat of their Brows They build good large Houses and inhabit altogether in Towns The side Walls are Mud or Watling plaister'd on the inside and thatch'd with Palm or Palmeto Leaves  The Churches are large built much higher than the Common Houses and covered with Pantile and within adorned with Coarse Pictures and Images of Saints which are all painted tauny like the Indians themselves Besides these Ornaments there are kept in the Curches Pipes Hautboys Drums Vizars and Perruques for their Recreation at solemn Times for they have little or no Sport or Pastime but in Common and that only upon Saints Days and the Nights ensuing  The Padres that serve here must learn the Indian Language before they can have a Benefice As for their Tithes and other Incoms Mr  Gage  an English Man hath given a large Account of them in his  Survey  of the  WestIndies  But however this I will add of my own knowledge that they are very dutiful to their Priests observing punctually their Orders and behave themselves very circumspectly and reverently in their Presence  They are generally well shaped of a middle size streight and clean Limbed The Men more spare the Women plump and fat their Faces are round and flat their Foreheads low their Eyes little their Noses of a middle size somewhat flattish full Lips pretty full but little Mouths white Teeth and their Colour of a dark tauny like other Indians They sleep in Hammacks made with small Cords like a Net fastned at each end to a Post Their Furniture is but mean  viz  Earthen Pots to boil their Maiz in and abundance of Callabashes They are a very harmless sort of People kind to  any strangers and even to the Spaniards by whom they are so much kept under that they are worse than Slaves nay the very Negroes will domineer over them and are countenanced to do so by the Spaniards This makes them very melancholy and thoughtful however they are very quite and seem contented with their Condition if they can tolerably subsist But sometimes when they are imposed on beyond their Ability they will march off whole Towns Men Women and Children together as is before related  CHAP VI  The River of  Checapeque

for  Eng  land  HAving given the Reader an Account of the Indians inhabiting about the River of  Tobasco  I come next to describe the Western Coast of this Bay with its Rivers and other most remarkable Particulars From  Tobasco  River to the  River  Checapeque  is Leagues The Coast lies East and West all Woody low Ground sandy Bay and good Anchoring but there falls in a pretty high Sea on the shore therefore but bad Landing yet Canoas may with care run in if the Men are ready to leap out as soon as she touches the Ground and then she must immediately be drag'd up out of the Surf And the same caution and dexterity is to be used when they go off again There is no fresh Water between  Tobasco  River and  Checapeque  This latter is rather a salt Creek than a River for the Mouth of it is not above Paces wide and about or Foot Water on the Bar but within there is or Foot at low Water and good riding for Barks half a Mile within the Mouth  This Creek runs in E S E about two Miles and then strikes away South up into the Country At its Mouth between it and the Sea is a bare sandy Point of Land Where on the side next the River close by the Brink of it and no where else you may scrape up the Sand which is course and brown with your Hands and get fresh Water but if you dig lower the Water will be salt Half a Mile within the Mouth when you are past the sandy Point the Land is wet and swampy bearing only Mangroves on each side for or Leagues up and after that firm Land where you will find a Run of fresh Water it being all salt till you come thither A League beyond this is a Beef Estantion or Farm of Cattle belonging to an Indian Village In the Woods on each side this River there are plenty of Guanoes Land Turtle and abundance of Quams and Corresos with some Parrots and there is no Settlement nearer than the Beef Estantion nor any thing else remarkable in this River that I know  A League West from  Checapeque  there is another small River called  Dos Boccas  'tis only fit for Canoas  to enter It has a Bar at its Mouth and therefore is somewhat dangerous Yet the Privateers make light of it for they will govern a Canoa very ingeniously However Captain  Rives  and Captain  Hewet  two Privateers lost several Men here in coming out for there had been a North which had raised the Bar and in going out most of their Canoas were overset and some Men drowned  This River will not float a Canoa above a League within its Mouth and so far is salt but there you meet with a fine clear Stream of fresh Water about a League up in the Country and beyond this are fair Savannahs of long Grass fenced in with Ridges of as rich Land as any in the World The Mold such as is formerly described all plain and level even to the Hills of  Chiapo  There are no Indian Towns within or Leagues of the Sea but further off they are pretty thick lying within a League or one after another  Halpo  is the chiefest  The Indians make use of no more Land than serves to maintain their Families in Maiz and to pay their Taxes And therefore between the Towns it lies uncultivated  In all this Country they rear abundance of Poultry  Viz  Turkies Ducks and Dunghil Fowls but some of them have CacaoWalks The Cacao of these Parts is most of it sent to  Villa de Mose  and ship'd off there Some of it is sold to Carriers that travail with Mules coming hither commonly in  Nov  or  Dec  and staying till  Febr  or  March  They lye a Fortnight at a time in a Village to dispose of their Goods which are commonly Hatchets Macheats Axes Hoes Knives Cizars Needles Thread Silk for sowing Womens Frocks small Lookingglasses Beads Silver or Copper Rings wash'd with Gold set with Glass instead of Stones small Pictures of Saints and such like Toys for the Indians  And for the Spaniards Linnen and Woollen Cloaths Silk Stockings and old Hats new dress'd which are here very valuable and worn by those of the best Quallity so that an old English Beaver thus ordered would be worth Dollars so much is Trade wanted here in this Country When he has sold off his Goods he is generally paid in Cacao which he carries to  La Vera Cruz  From  Dos Boccas  to the River  Palmas  is Leagues low Land and sandy Bay between  From  Palmas  to the  Halover  is Leagues  The  Halover  is a small Neck of Land parting the Sea from a large Lagune It is so call'd by the Privateers because they use to drag their Canoas in and out there  From the  Halover  to St  Anns  is Leagues  St  Anns  is a Mouth that opens the Lagune before mention'd there is not above or Foot Water yet Barks often go in there to Careen  From St  Anns  to  Tondelo  is Leagues The Coast still West the Land low and sandy Bay against the Sea a little within which are pretty high SandBanks cloathed with prickly Bushes such as I have already described at  BeefIsland  Against the Sea near the West end within the Sand Bank the Land is lower again the Woods not very high and some spots of Savannahs with plenty of fat Bullocks In hunting of which a Frenchman unhappily lost his Life For his Company being stragled from him to find Game he unluckily met a Drove of Cattle flying from them in the Woods which were so thick that there was no passing but in these very narrow Paths that the Cattle themselves had made so that not being able to get out of their way the foremost of the Drove thrust his Horns into his Back and carried him Paces into the Savannah where he fell down with his Guts trailing on the Ground  The River  Tondelo  is but narrow yet capable to receive Barks of or Tuns there is a Bar at the Entrance and the Channnel crooked On the West side of the Bar there is a spit of Sand shoots out therefore to avoid it at your coming in you must keep the East side aboard but when once entred you may run up for two or three Leagues on the East side a quarter of a Mile within the Mouth you may lie secure but all this Coast and especially this River intolerably swarms with  Musketoes  that there is no sleeping for them  About or Leagues from the Mouth this River is fordable and there the Road crosses it where two French Canoas that lay in this River intercepted the Caravan of Mules laden with Cacao that was returning to  La Vera Cruz  taking away as much as they could carry with them  From  Tondelo  River to the River of  Guasickwalp  is Leagues more the Coast still West all along sandy Bay and Sandhills as between  St Anns  and  Tondelo  only towards the West part the Bank is lower and the Trees higher This is one of the Principal Rivers of this Coast 'tis not half the breadth of the  Tobasco River  but deeper Its Bar is less dangerous than any on this Coast having foot Water on it and but little Sea Within the Bar there is much more and soft Oasie Ground The Banks on both sides are low The East side is woody and the West side Savannah Here are some Cattle but since it has been frequented by Privateers the Spaniards have driven most of their Bullocks from hence farther into the Country This River hath its rise near the South Sea and is Navigable a great way into Land especially with Boats or small Barks  The River  T  guantepeque  that falls into the South Seas has its Origine near the Head of  Guasickwalp  and it is reported that the first Naval Stores for the  Manila Ships  were sent through the Country from the North to the South Seas by the conveniency of these two Rivers whose heads are not above or Leagues asunder I heard this discoursed by the Privateers long before I visited the South Seas and they seemed sometimes minded to try their Fortunes this way supposing as many do still that the South Sea shore is nothing but Gold and Silver But how grosly they are mistaken I have satisfied the World already And for this part of the Country though it is rich in Land yet it has not the least appearance of any Mine neither is it thick inhabited with Spaniards And if I am not deceived the very Indians in the heart of the Country are scarce their Friends  The Town of note on the S Sea is  Teguantapeque  and on the N Seas  Keyhooca  is the chiefest near this River Besides these two the Country is only inhabited by Indians therefore it is wholly unfrequented by Shipping  Keyhooca  is a large rich Town of good Trade about Leagues from the River  Guasickwalp  on the West fide It is inhabited with some few  Spaniards  and abundance of Mulatoes These keep many Mules they being most Carriers and frequently visit the Cacao Coast for Nuts and travel the Country between  Villa de Mose  and  La Vera Cruz  This Country is pleasant enough in the dry Season but when the furious North Winds rage on the Coast and violently drive in the Sea it suffers extreamly being so much overflown that there is no travelling It was in the wet Season when Capt  Rives  and Capt  Hewet  made an Expedition in Canoas from the Island  Trist  to the River  Guasickwalp  and there landed their Men designing to attack  Keyhooca  but the Country was so wet that there was no marching neither was the Water high  enough for a Canoa Here are great plenty of  Vinelles  From the River  Guasickwalp  the Land runs West or Leagues all low Land with sandy Bay to the Sea and very woody in the Country About three Leagues to the West of it the Land trends away to the North for about Leagues rising higher also even from the very Shore as you go up within Land making a very high Promontory called St  Martins  Land but ending in a pretty bluff point which is the West Bounds of the Bay of  Campeachy  From this bluff Point to  Alvarado  is about Leagues the first four of it a high rocky shore with steep Cliffs to the Sea and the Land somewhat woody Afterwards you pass by very high SandHills by the Sea and an extraordinary great Sea falls in on the shore which hinders any Boats from Landing Within the Sandhills again the Land is lower pretty plain and fruitful enough in large Trees  The River of  Alvarado  is above a Mile over at the Mouth yet the entrance is but shole there being Sands for near two Mile off the shore clear from side to side nevertheless there are two Channels through these Sands The best which is in the middle has or Foot Water The Land on each side of the Mouth is high  Sandbanks  above Foot high  This River comes out of the Country in three Branches meeting altogether just within the Mouth where it is very wide and deep One of these Branches comes from the Eastward Another from the Westward And the third which is the true River of  Alvarado  and the biggest comes directly out of the Country opposite to the Sandhills about a Mile West of the Rivers Mouth This last springs a great way from the Sea passing through a very fertile Country thick setled with Towns of  Spaniards  and  Indians  On the West side and just against the Mouth of the River the  Spainiarde  have a small Fort of Guns on the declivity of the  Sandbank  a great height above the River which commands a small  Spanish  Town on the back of it built in a Plain close by the River It is a great Fishery chiefly for Snooks which they catch in the Lake and when they are salted and dryed drive a great Trade in Exchanging them for Salt and other Commodities Besides salt Fish they export from hence abundance of dry CodPepper and some pickled and put in Jars This Pepper is known by the Name of  Guinea Pepper  Yet for all this Trade 'tis but a poor Place and has been often taken by the Privateers chiefly to secure their Ships while they should go up in their Canoas to the rich Towns within Land which notwithstanding they never yet attempted by reason that  La Vera Cruz  bordering so near they were still afraid of being attacqued both by  Sea  and  Land  from thence and so never durst prosecute their designs on the Country Towns  Six Leagues West from  Alvarado  there is another large Opening out into the Sea and it is reported to have a Communication by a small Creek with this River of  Alvarado  and that Canoas may pass through it from one River to the other And at this Opening is a small Fishing Village The Land by the Sea is a continued high Sandbank and so violent a Sea that it is impossible to land with Boat or Canoa  From this River to  La Vera Cruz  is six Leagues more the Coast still West There is a Riff of Rocks runs along the shore from  Alvarado  to  Vera Cruz  yet a good Channel for small Vessels to pass between it and the Shore And about two Leagues to the East of  Vera Cruz  are two Islands called  Sacrifice Islands  I have set down the distance between  Alvarado  and  La Vera Cruz  according to the Common Account of Leagues which I take to be truer but our Draughts make it The Land by the Sea is much the same  La Vera Cruz  is a fair Town seated in the very bottom of the Bay of  Mexico  at the S W Point or Corner of the Bay for so far the Land runs West and there it turns about to the North There is a good Harbour before it made by a small Island or Rock rather just in its Mouth which makes it very Commodious Here the  Spaniards  have built a strong Fort which commands the Harbour and there are great Iron Rings fix'd in the FortWall against the Harbour for  Ships  to fasten their Cables For the North Winds blow so violently here in their  Seasons  that  Ships  are not safe at Anchors  This Fort is called St  John d' Ulloa  and the  Spaniards  do frequently call the Town of  Vera Cruz  by this Name  The Town is a Place of great Trade being the  SeaPort  to the City of  Mexico  and most of the great Towns and Cities in this Kingdom So that all the European Commodities spent in these Parts are Landed here and their Goods brought hither and exported from hence Add to this that all the Treasure brought from  Manila  in the  EastIndies  comes hither through the Country from  Accapulca  The  Flota  comes hither every three Years from  Old Spain  and besides Goods of the Product of the Country and what is brought from the  EastIndies  and ship'd aboard them The King's Plate that is gathered in this Kingdom together with what belongs to the Merchants amounts to a vast  Summ  Here also comes every Year the  Barralavanta Fleet  in  October  or  November  and stays till  March  This is a small  Squadron  consisting of  or Sail of stout Ships from to Guns Thes  are ordered to visit all the  Spanish SeaPort Town  once every Year chiefly to hinder Foreigners from Trading and to suppress Privateers From this Por  they go to the  Havana  on the North side of  Cuba  to sell their CommoditiesFrom hence they pass through the Gulph of  Florida  standing so far to the North as to be out of the TradeWinds which are commonly between d and d of Lat and being in a variable Windsway they stretch away to the Eastwards till they may fetch  Portarica  if they have Business there if not they keep still to the Eastward till they come to  Trinidado  an Island near the Main inhabited by the  Spaniards  and the most Eastern part of any Consequence in the  North Seas  The  Barralaventa Fleet  touches there first and from thence sails to the  Margarita  a considerable  Spanish Island  near the Main From thence they Coast down to  Comana  and  La Guiary  and passing by the Coast of  Carraccus  they sail towards the Gulph of  Mericaia  from thence they double  Cape La Vell  and so down to  Rio la Hacha St Martha  and  Carthagena  If they meet with any English or Dutch Trading Sloops they chase and take them if they are not too nimble for them The Privateers keep out of their way having always Intelligence where they are  From  Carthagena  they sail to  Portobelo  and from thence to  Campeachy  and lastly to  La Vera Cruz  And this is their Annual Navigation about the  WestIndian  Coast  La Vera Cruz  was taken by the Privateers about the Year under the conduct of one  John Russel  an old Logwood Cutter that had formerly been taken by the  Spaniards  and sent to  Mexico  where learning  Spanish  he by that means escaped to  La Vera Cruz  and being released from thence he afterwards managed this Expedition  From hence to  Old Vera Cruz  is Leagues This was the first Town of that Name but wanting a good Harbour there it was removed to the place where it now stands  From  Old Vera Cruz  to  Tispo  is about Leagues the Coast lies N and S  Tispo  is a pretty handsom small Town built close by the Sea and watered with a little Rivulet but wanting a Harbour 'tis destitute of any MaritimeTrade  From  Tispo  to the River  Panuk  is about Leagues The Coast lies N and S nearest 'tis a large River descending out of the very Bowels of the Country and running East falls into the Gulph of  Mexico  in Lat about m It has or Foot Water on the Bar and is often visited with Barks that sail up it as far as the City  Panuk  lying distant from the Sea about Leagues and is the principal of this Country being a Bishops See There are two Churches one Convent and a Chapel and about Families of  Spaniards Mulatoes  and  Indians  The Houses are large and strong with Stone Walls and they are thatched with  Palmeto Leaves  One Branch of this River comes out of the Lagune of  Tompeque  and mixes with this three Leagues before it falls into the Sea Therefore 'tis sometimes called the River of  Tompeque  The Lagune of  Tompeque  lies on the South side of the River and breeds abundance of Fish especially  Shrimps  There is a Town of the same Name built on its Banks whose inhabitants are most Fishermen Beyond this Lagune there is another large one wherein is an Island and Town named  Haniago  its Inhabitants most Fishermen whose chief employment is to take Shrimps These they boil with Water and Salt in great Coppers for the purpose and having dryed them afterwards in the Sun they are made up in Packs and  sent to all the chief Towns in the Country especially to  Mexico  where tho' but a hungry sort of Food they are mightily esteemed  The Account I have given of the  Campeachy  Rivers c was the result of the particular Observations I made in cruising about that Coast in which I spent or Months For when the violent  Storm  beforementioned took us I was but just settling to Work and not having a stock of Wood to purchase such Provision as was sent from  Jamaica  as the old  Standards  had I with many more in my circumstances was forced to range about to seek a subsistance in Company of some Privateers then in the Bay In which rambles we visited all the Rivers from  Trist  to  Alvarado  and made many Descents into the County among the Villages there where we got IndianCorn to eat with the Beef and other Flesh that we got by the way or Manatee and Turtle which was also a great support to us  Alvarado  was the Westermost place I was at Thither we went in two Barks with Men in each and had or kill'd and desperately wounded in taken the Fort being four or five Hours engag'd in that Service in which time the Inhabitants having plenty of Boats and Canoas carried all their Riches and best Moveables away It was after Sunset before the Fort yielded and growing dark we could not pursue them but rested quietly that Night the next day we kill'd salted and sent aboard or Beefs and a good quanity of Saltfish and Indian Corn as much as we could stow away Here were but few Hogs and those eat very fishy therefore we did not much esteem them but of Cocks Hens and Ducks were sent aboard in abundance The tame Parrots we found here were the largest and fairest Birds of their kind that I ever saw in the  WestIndies  Their colour was yellow  and red very coursly mixt and they would prate very prettily and there was scarce a Man but what sent aboard one or two of them So that with Provision Chests HenCoops and ParrotCages our Ships were full of Lumber with which we intended to sail But the second Day after we took the Fort having had a Westerly Wind all the Morning with Rain Armadilloes that were sent from  La Verd Cruz  appeared in sight within a Mile of the Bars coming in with full sail but they could scarce stem the Current of the River which was very well for us for we were not a little surprized Yet we got under sail in order to meet them and clearing our Decks by heaving all the Lumber overboard we drove out over the Bar before they reached it But they being to Windward forced us to exchange a few shot with them Their Admiral was called the  Toro  She had Guns and Men another had Guns and Men The rest having no great Guns had only or Men apiece armed with Muskets and the Vessels barricadoed round with Bullhides Breast high We had not above Men in both Ships Guns in one and two in the other Assoon as we were over the Bar we got our LarboardTacks aboard and stood to the Eastward as nigh the Wind as we could lye The Spaniards came away quartering on us and our Ship being the Headmost the  Toro  came directly towards us designing to board us We kept firing at her in hopes to have lamed either Mast or Yard but failing just as she was shearing aboard we gave her a good Volley and presently clapp'd the Helm a Weather wore our Ship and got our Starboard Tacks aboard and stood to the Westward and so left the  Toro  but were saluted by all the small Craft as we past by them who stood to the Eastward after the  Toro  that was now in pursuit and close by our Consort We stood to the Westward  till we were against the River's Mouth then we tackt and by the help of the Current that came out of the River we were near a Mile to Windward of them all Then we made sail to assist our Consort who was hard put to it but on our approach the  Toro  edged away towards the Shore as did all the rest and stood away for  Alvarado  And we glad of the Deliverance went away to the Eastward and visited all the Rivers in our return again to  Trist  and searched the Bays for  Munjack  to carry with us for the Ship's use as we had done before for the use both of Ships and Canoa's  Munjack  is a sort of Pitch or Bitumen which we find in Lumps from three or four pounds to thirty pounds in a lump washed up by the Sea and left dry on all the SandyBays on all this Coast It is in Substance like Pitch but blacker it melts by the Heat of the Sun and runs abroad as Pitch would do if exposed as this is on the Bays The smell of it is not so pleasant as Pitch neither does it stick so firmly as Pitch but it is apt to peel off from the Seams of Ships Bottoms however we find it very useful here where we want Pitch and because it is commonly mixed with Sand by lying on the Bays we melt it and refine it very well before we use it and commonly temper it with Oyl or Tallow to correct it for though it melts by the heat of the Sun yet it is of a harsher Nature than Pitch I did never find the like in any other Part of the World neither can I tell from whence it comes  And now the Effects of the late Storm being almost forgot the Lagune Men settled again to their Imployments and I among the rest fell to Work in the East Lagune where I remained till my departure for  Jamaica  I will only add as to this LogwoodTrade in general that I take it to be one of the most profitable to  England  and it nearest resembles that of  Newfoundland  since what arises from both is the product of bare Labour and that the Persons imployed herein are supported by the Produce of their Native Country  It is not my Business to determine how far we might have a right of cutting Wood there but this I can say that the Spaniards never receive less Damage from the Persons who generally follow that Trade than when they are employed upon that Work  While I was here the last time Capt  Gibbs  arriv'd in a Ship of about Tuns and brought with him stout  NewEngland Indians  that were taken in the Wars there designing to have sold them at  Jamaica  but not finding a good Market brought them hither to cut Logwood and hired one Mr  Richard Dawkins  to be their Overseer who carried them to work at  Summasenta  But it so happened that about a Week after the Captain came thither in his Boat from  OneBushKey  where his Ship lay and the Overseer having some Business desired leave to be absent for two or three Days But as soon as he and the Seamen were gone the Indians taking their Opportunity killed the Captain and marched off designing to return to their own Country by Land They were seen about a Month afterward and one of them was taken near the River  Tondelo  After I had spent about ten or twelve Months at the Logwood Trade and was grown pretty well acquainted with the way of Traffick here I left the Imployment yet with a design to return hither after I had been in  England  and accordingly went from hence with Captain  Chambers  of  London  bound to  Jamaica  We sailed from  Trist  the beginning  ginning of  April  and arrived at  Jamaica  in  May  where I remained a small time and then returned for  England  with Captain  Leader  of  London  I arriv'd there the beginning of  August  the same Year and at the beginning of the following Year I set out again for  Jamaica  in order to have gone thence to  Campeachy  but it proved to be a Voyage round the World of which the Publick has already had an Account in my former Volume and the

Introduction  Of the  General TradeWind  at Sea Of the best time of the Year to cross the  Equinoctial  The Winds near the  Line  commonly uncertain and attended with Calms and Tornadoes A Reason of the Winds blowing South near the  Line  in the  Atlantick Sea  How Ships homewardbound from the Bite of  Guinea  should cross the  Line  Of the  TradeWind  in the  SouthSea  and in the  EastIndian  Ocean  I Shall reduce what I have to say on this Subject to some general Heads beginning with the Tradewinds as being the most remarkable  TradeWinds are such as do blow constantly from one Point or Quarter of the Compass and  the Region of the World most peculiar to them is from about d North to d South of the Equator  There are divers sorts of these Winds some blowing from East to West some from South to North others from West to East c Some are constant in one Quarter all the Year some blow one half the Year one way and the other six Months quite contrary and others blow six Months one way and then shifting only eight or ten Points continue six Months more and then return again to their former Stations as all these shifting TradeWinds do and so as the Year comes about they alternately succeed each other in their proper Seasons  There are other sorts called SeaWinds and Landwinds differing much from any of the former the one blowing by Day the other by Night constantly and regularly succeeding each other  Within the Torrid Zone also are violent Storms as fierce if not fiercer than any are in other Parts of the World And as to the Seasons of the Year I can distinguish them there no other way than by  Wet  and  Dry  and these wet and dry Seasons do as successively follow each other as Winter and Summer do with us  Here are also strong Currents sometimes setting one way sometimes another which though it is hard to describe with that accuracy which is desirable yet I shall give as particular an Account of them as also of the several sorts of  Winds  as my own Observations and the Judicious Informations from others will afford me Matter to do  Of the General TradeWind  Of all Winds beforementioned I shall endeavour to treat distinctly beginning with the  True  TradeVVind  first which I call the  General  TradeVVind at Sea because all other TradeVVinds whether constant or shifting seem to have their dependance on some accidental Cause whereas the Cause of these be it what it will seems uniformand constant  These General TradeVVinds are only in the Atlantick Ocean which parts  Africa  from  America  in the  EastIndian  Ocean and in the  Great SouthSea  In all these Seas except just under or near the Line they constantly blow without Intermission as well to the South as to the North of the Equator but not with equal force at all Times nor in all Latitudes Neither do these constant TradeVViuds usually blow near the shoar but only in the Ocean at least or Leagues off at Sea clear from any Land especially on the VVest Coast or side of any Continent For indeed on the East side The Easterly VVind being the true TradeVVind blows almost home to the shore so near as to receive a check from the LandVVind and ofttimes to admit of the SeaBreez by which it is drawn from its Course frequently or Points of the Compass But of the SeaBreez I shall speak in its place In some Places and particularly the South Seas in Sonth Lat the true Eastern Trade  s not found to blow within or near Leagues of the Coast but in North Lat in those Seas it comes within or Leagues distance of the Shore And this I shall give as a general Rule That in North Lat these VVinds are commonly at E N E in South Lat at E S E  VVhen we go from  England  and are bound to  e  East  or  WestIndies  or to  Guinea  we commonly find these VVinds in the Lat of d some  imes sooner as in the Latitudes of or And  may so happen that we may meet with an Easterly  Wind in d or go out of our Channel with a North East Wind which sometimes also fails us not till we come into a true Tradewind but this is only accidental therefore is not the Wind that I speak of but between and I did never know nor hear that the true Tradewind failed  If in coming from  England  we have a North Easterly Wind that brings us hither  i e  into the true Tradewind it sometimes stays at North East especially if we keep near the  African  Shore as  Guinea  Ships do till we are near the Tropick of  Cancer  and then comes to the E N E where it settles but commonly it settles there in d if we are so far off Shore as to receive the true Trade VVhen the VVind is thus settled we have commonly fair Weather and a clear Sky especially if the Sun is in any Southern Sign but if in a Northern Sign the Weather is usually cloudy  On the contrary when we are in South Lat in the Atlantick if the Sun is in Northern Signs the Sky is clear but if in Southern Signs the Sky is cloudy This I once experienced to my sorrow in my return from  Bantam  in the Year VVe had cloudy VVeather and brisk VVinds while we were crossing the  EastIndian  Ocean and had a very good Passage also about the  Cape of good Hope  where we had fair clear VVeather And steering from thence for the Island St  Hellena  where we thought to VVater and refresh as all our  English East India  Ships do we mist it for want of an  Observation  For before we came to the Tropick of  Capricorn  the Sky was again clouded so that we seldom saw the Sun or Stars till we were quite past the  Island  However we found the Isle of  Ascention  where we struck two Turtle for this was not the laying time but the beginning of the  Cooting  or Ingendring Season therefore some few  only were drawn hither This was the latter end of  November  From the time that we thought our selves to the VVest of St  Hellena  we had our VVater measured out to us Pints a Man  per  day till we came into our Channel This was the first time that I began to know the value of fresh VVater for we took in none in all our way home from  Bantam  But so much for this Digression  The VVinds as I said before as we run to the Southward from  England  do first settle in the E N E about the Lat of d or be sure between that and d especially when the Sun is to the Southward of the Line but in  May June  and  July  you will find the Winds at E by S or E S E  These Winds whether we meet them to the North of the East or to the South of it we find blowing a moderate Gale from our first meeting them in or d till we come to the Tropick there we find the Trade stronger It commonly blows a good Topsailgale as we sail large And if we were to sail on a Wind our lower Sails would be enough  These brisk Gales blow in the Atlantick Ocean and North of the Equator from the Lat of to or constantly between the E N E and the E but between or degrees and the Line they are not so fresh nor constant to that Point for in the Months of  July  and  August  the South Winds do oft times blow even to d or d of North Lat keeping between the S S E and the S S W or S W but in  December  and  January  the true Trade blows within d or d of the Equator And as the Sun returns again to the Northward so the Southerly Winds do increase and draw more to the Northward of the Line till  July  and them gradually withdraw back again towards the Line VVhen the Sun is in Southern Signs 'tis the best time of the Year to cross the Line if bound to the Southward  for besides the benefit of the true Trade to bring a Ship near the Line the Wind is then more constant and fresh the Weather clearer and the Winds which at other times are between the S S E and S S W are now at S E or S E and by E but in our Summer Months we find nothing but Calms and Tornadoes and tho' Tornadoes do usually rise against the settled Wind yet but few Commanders will endeavour to take the Advantage of the Winds that come from them but rather furl their Topsails hall up their Corses and lye still till the gust of Wind is past except necessity requires haste for the sudden Tornadoes do not continue long and besides often very violent and fierce so that a Ship with her sails loose would be in danger to be overset by them or at least lose Masts or Yards or have the Sails split besides the Consternation that all Men must needs be in at such a time especially if the Ship by any unforeseen accident should prove unruly as by the mistake of the Man at Helm or he that Conns or by her broaching to against all endeavours which often happens when a fierce gust comes which tho' it does not last long yet would do much damage in a short time and tho' all things should fall out well yet the benefit of it would not compensate the danger For 'tis much if a Ship sails a Mile before either the Wind dyes wholly away or at least shifts about again to the South Nor are we sure that these Winds will continue Minutes before they shift and sometimes they fly round faster than the Ship will tho' the Helm lies for it and all Seamen know the danger of being taken aback in such Weather  But what has been spoken of the Southerly Winds Calms and Tornadoes is to be understood of the East side of the Atlantick to as far West as the Longitude of d or thereabouts for farther Westerly we find the Winds commonly at S  E even in crossing the Line and a very brisk gale 'tis for that reason our experienced  Guinea  Commanders do keep to the Southward of the Line till they are about that Longitude Some run over nearer the  American  Shore before they cross the Line Our  EastIndia  Commanders do also cross the Line coming from  India  near the  American  Coast and find brisk Gales at S E all the times of the Year but going to the  Indies  they steer away South from the Island St  Jago  where they commonly Water and meet the Winds in that Longitude But of this enough  The Winds near the Line in the  Indian  Ocean and South Sea are different from this yet there the Winds are also Southerly and therefore different from what they are farther off for d or d on each side the Line the Winds are commonly very uncertain and oftentimes there are perfect Calms or at least very small Winds and some Tornadoes in the  EastIndian  Sea In the  South Seas  near and under the Line the Winds are at South Leagues off from the Shoar but how farther off I know not there the Winds are but small yet constant and the Weather clear from  March  till  September  but about  Christmas  there are Tornadoes yet in both the  EastIndian  Sea and the  South Sea  the Winds near or under the Line are often at South yet these Winds do not blow above or d to the North or South of the Line except near some Land but in the Atlantick Sea as I have said before the South and South West Winds do sometimes blow even to or d North of the Line And for the South Winds to blow constantly near the Line in the Atlantick between  Cape Verd  in  Africa  and  C Blanco  in  Brazil  is no wonderful thing if a Man will but consider those Promontories that shoot out from the Continents on each side the Sea one on the North the other on the South side of the Equator  leaving but a small space clear for the Winds to blow in where there is always a pretty brisk Gale especially on the  American  side And as within or d of the Equator it is most subject to Calms and Tornadoes and small faint Breezes in other Seas not pend up as this is So this Sea except just in the very opening between both Promontories is much more subject to it than any other especially on the East side that is from the Bite or the Inland corner of the Coast of  Guinea  to or d distance West But this seems not to be altogether the effects of the Line but owing partly to the nearness of the Land to the Line which shoots out from the Bite of  Guinea  even to  Cape St Anns  almost in a parallel with the Equator allowing for the Bays and Bendings and this is or d of Longitude and not above Leagues from the Line in some Places So that this part of the Sea between the Coast of  Guinea  and the Line or d South of it lying as it were between the Land and the Line is seldom free from bad Weather especially from  April  to  September  but when the Sun is withdrawn towards the Tropick of  Capricorn  then there is something better Weather there  And in the Sea under the Line between the  African  Promontory and the  American  it is free from Tornadoes and Calms and more subject to fair Weather and fresh Breezes Therefore both our  English  and  Dutch EastIndia  Ships when outwardbound endeavour to Cross the Line as near as they can in the mid Channel between both Promontories and although they meet the Winds some times at S S E or at S S W or farther Easterly or VVesterly yet will they not run above a degree to the East or a degree to the VVest of the mid Channel before they tack again for fear of meeting with the soaking Current on the VVest or Calms on the East side either of which would be alike prejudicial to their Course  The  Portuguese  in their Voyages to  Brazil  take the same method and get to the South of the Line before they fall in with the Land for fear of falling to leward of  Cape St Augustine  for there are so many things which make that a difficult Cape to pass that hardly any Man would try to do it but at a distance  But our  Guinea  Ships do generally pass on to their Ports on the Coast of  Guinea  at any time of the Year without using such Methods because their Business lies mostly on the North of the Line where they always find a fair VVesterly VVind But in their returns from thence they cross the Line and run or d to the Southward of it where they meet the Wind between the S S E and the S S W and a brisk gale with this VVind they run away in the same parallel or d before they cross the Line again to the Northward which is about midway between the Extreams of both Promontories there they find a brisk gale which carries them to the  West Indies  or where they please Some run VVest d before they cross the Line and find strong Gales whereas should they come from  Old Callabar  or any other Place in the  Bite  on the North of the Line and steer away VVest thinking to gain their Passage the sooner because it is the nearest way they would doubtless be mistaken as many Men have been For if they keep near the Line they meet with great Calms and if they keep near the Land they meet with VVesterly VVinds and if they keep in the middle between both they must of necessity meet with both Inconveniencies as also with Tornadoes especially in  May June July  and  August  By which means some Ships if they go any of these three ways now cautioned against spend more time in going from the  Bite  to  Cape Verd  than another Ship will do if it cross the Line in the right  Places beforementioned in going to the  Barbadoes  Sometimes unexperienced  Guinea  Masters in their return from thence after they have cross'd the Line from N to S and are in a fair way to gain a speedy Passage will be so obstinate in their Opinions after they have run or d West from  Old Callabar  with a fair Wind to steer away W by N or W N W it being the directest Course they can steer for  Barbadoes  then they must of necessity keep within a degree of the Line while they are running or Leagues which may prove to be a long time in doing because of the uncertainty of the Winds near the Equator therefore they that cross it near the middle between both Promontories or near the  American  Coast when they are minded to fall away to the Northward steer away N W or N W by N and so depress or raise a degree in running Leagues at most therefore which is best they are but a short time near the Equator And besides in thus crossing it in the middle between both Promontories they seldom miss of a Wind for the Wind in these Seas has no other Passage but between these two Promontories  What I have said already on this Head has been chiefly of the  Atlantick  and of that too mostly about the Line because it is the most difficult Place to pass in going to the Southward In other Seas as in the  EastIndia Sea  and the  Great South Sea  there is no such difficulty to pass any way because there is Searoom enough without coming into such Inconveniencies as we meet with in the Atlantick and as to the Winds between the Line and the Tropicks in the  EastIndian Sea  and the  South Sea  they are in their Latitudes as I said before  viz  in South Latitude at E S E and in North Lat at E N E blowing constantly fresh Breezes especially in the South Seas even  from within a degree or two of the Line on each side to the Tropick or to degrees of Lat And this I may truly say That neither the Atlantick nor the  EastIndian Seas  have the true TradeWinds so constant nor brisk at all times of the Year and in all Latitudes as they are here For being once got in the Trade I mean without the verge of the coasting TradeWind it blows a very brisk gale all over the Ocean Capt  Eaton  experienced this in sailing from the  Gallapagos  Islands to the  Ladrones  in the latter end of the Year We had the like experience sailing from  Cape Corientes  to  Guam  the Year after as appears by my Journal of that Run in my Voyage round the World Chap Pag And as for the Wind to the Southward of the Line I had great Experience of it in my ramble there with Capt  Sharp  and since that Capt  Davis  in his return out of the South Sea had greater Experience because he took his departure from the  Gallapagos  Islands also and steering W S W from thence till he met the True Trade at E S E he steered directly South clear from the Line till he got to the Southward of the Tropick of  Capricorn  and so quite without the Trade  In the  EastIndian  Sea between the Lat of d and degrees South of the Equator the true Breez is at E S E or S E by E yet not so constant nor brisk as in the South Seas besides that part of it which lyes to the Northward of the Line has not such a constant steady Breez but is more subject to Calms and near the shoar to shifting Winds according to the Seasons of the Year  CHAP II Of the constant coasting TradeWinds  A Parallel of the South Part of  Africa  and  Peru  The TradeWinds blowwith an acute Angle on any Coast The Winds about  Angola  and in the South Seas alike as also at  Mexico  and  Guinea  The Winds shift not in some Places Sand blown from the Shore about  Cape Blanco  in  Guinea  An Account of the TradeWinds from thence to  Cape Logos  THE Tradewinds which blow on any Coast are either Constant or Shifting  The Coasts that are subject to Constant Tradewinds are the South Coast of  Africa  and  Peru  and part of the Coast of  Mexico  and part of  Guinea  The South part of  Africa  and  Peru  are in one Lat both Coasts trending North and South both on the West side of their Continents both in South Lat and tho' they do not lye exactly parallel by Reason of some Capes or Bendings in the Land yet are the Winds much alike on both Coasts all the Year long  On the Coast of  Angola  the Winds are between the S VV and S And on the Coast of  Peru  we reckon them between the S S VV and S S E But this the Reader must take notice of That the Tradewinds that blow on any Coast except the North Coast of  Africa  whether they are constant and  blow all the Year or whether they are shifting VVinds do never blow right in on the Shoar nor right along Shoar but go slanting making an accute Angle of about degrees Therefore as the Land trends more Easterly or VVesterly from the North or South on these Coasts so the VVinds do alter accordingly as for example where the Land lies N and S the VVind would be at S S VV but where the Land lies S S W the Trade would be at S VV But if the Land lies S S E then the Wind would be at South This is supposed of Coasts lying on the VVest side of any Continent and on the South side of the Equator as the two Coasts of  Africa  and  Peru  are but the North part of  Africa  has the Trade blowing off from the shoar two or three Points  These Southerly VVinds do blow constantly all the Year long on both the Coasts of  Peru  and  Africa  they are brisk and blow farther off from the Coasts than any shifting Winds  On the Coast of  Peru  these VVinds blow or Leagues off Shore before you can perceive them to alter But then as you run farther off so the Wind will come about more Easterly and at about Leagues distance it settles at E S E which is the true Trade  Between  Angola  and  Brazil  the Winds are much as they are in the South Seas on the West side of the  Peruvian  Coast only near the Line within degrees of it in South Lat the Wind holds in the S S W or S W for or d of Longitude and so it may in the same Lat in the South Seas for ought I know for it was at South as far as any of us were which was Leagues  As the Coasts of  Peru  and  Angola  have their constant Tradewinds so has the Coast of  Mexico  and  Guinea  And as the Coast of  Peru  lies North and South so those lye nearer East and West  According to the Course of the general Trade the Winds should be Easterly on these Coasts but here we meet with the quite contrary for from the Lat of d North to d North on the Coast of  Mexico  the Winds are constantly near the West on all the Coast except check'd sometimes with Tornadoes which do commonly rise against the Wind the same is observed on the Coast of  Angola  where there are Tornadoes also But the Coast of  Peru  is not subject to any yet on that Coast there are sometimes Calms two or three days together off of the Bay of  Arica  between the Lat of and In the Lat of you shall have Calms or Leagues off Shore but not so far on either side the Bay neither are such Calms usual on the Coasts of  Angola  and  Mexico  only after a Tornado as is common in other Places  As the Coasts of  Angola  and  Peru  do in most things run parallel each with other so do the Coasts of  Mexico  and  Guinea  And if I am not mistaken the VVinds on both these Coasts are much alike Both these Coasts do begin at the Bite or Bending of the Land where the other two Parallel Lands do end for as the  Mexican  Continent begins at or near  Panama  which is or degrees North of the Equator so that part of  Guinea  which I speak of begins about  Old Callabar  in about or degrees of North Lat  The Land trends away VVesterly from both these Places some hundreds of Leagues and tho' not on one Point of the Compass because of the small Points Bays and Bending in the Land yet the VVinds that on more regular Shores keep their constant Course and blow in upon the Shore about two Points from the Sea do also here on the  Guinea  Coast blow on the Shore from the VVest Quarter and as the Land lies pointing in on the Shore even from  Cape Mount  to  Old Callabar  which is above  Leagues and that with such constancy that the East part of that Coast is called the  Leeward Coast  and the West part the  Windward Coast  And yet this is so contrary to the general Opinion of Seamen concerning the Course of the Winds that nothing but their own Experience will convince them of the Truth of it for thus they generally reason  Barbadoes  is the Eastermost of the  Carribbe  Islands therefore the rest are said be to Leeward of it and so of any other Island as indeed it usually holds true because the Winds there are commonly at East but this Counter Wind on the Coast of  Guinea  astonishes most Seamen that have seen nothing like what they meet with here There are other Coasts where the Winds shift very little as on the Coast of  Carraccos  and the South side of the Bay of  Mexico i e  in the Bay of  Campechy  and all the  Carribbe  Islands Indeed there may be sometimes some small flurts of a Westerly VVind on these Coasts but neither constant certain or lasting  And indeed this was the great stumbling Block that we met with in running from the  Gallapagos Islands  for the Island  Cocos  mentioned in my former Book Chap Pag  But that part of  Africa  which lies between  Cape Verd  in d North and  Cape Bayedore  in has commonly Northerly Winds or between the N and N E very fresh gales therefore our  Guinea  Ships bound to  Guinea  strive to keep near that Shore and oft times make the Capes And being to the Southward of  Cape Blanco  which lyes in Lat about they are sometimes so troubled with the Sand which the Wind brings off Shore that they are scarce able to see one another Their Decks are also strewed with it and their Sails all red as if they were tanned with the Sand that sticks to them it being of a reddish colour  From  Cape Verd  to  Cape St Anns  which is about degrees North the Trade is between the E and S E from  Cape St Anns  to  Cape Palmas  in about d North the Trade is at S W from  Cape Palmas  to the  Bite  of  Guinea  which is at the bending of the Coast the Wind is at W S W from this bending the Land begins to turn about to the South and from thence to  Cape Logos  which is to the South of the Line the Trade is at S W as it is on all that Coast even to degrees South  This last Account I had from Mr  Canby  who has made many Voyages to  Guinea  CHAP III Of the Coasting TradeWinds that shift  The Coasts where the Winds shift Of the Winds between  Gratia de Dios  and  Cape La Vela  Of those on the Coast of  Brazil  At  Panama  About  Natal  And  Cape Corientes  And the  RedSea  From the  Gulph  of  Persia  to  Cape Comorin  Of the  Monsoons  in  India  Their Benefit for sailing from Place to Place Sea and Land Breezes serviceable for the same purpose By what helps long Voyages are made in an open Sea  THE Coasts where the VVinds do usually shift are some in the  WestIndies  as that part of the Coast between  Cape Gratia de Dios  and  Cape La Vera  chiefly The Coast of  Brazil  the Bay of  Panama  in the South Seas and all the Coast of the  EastIndies  even from the River  Natal  which is in the Lat of d South on the East side of  Africa  beyond the  Cape of good Hope  to the NorthEast Parts of  China  comprehending all the Bays between The Islands also have their Annual changes Of all these I shall treat in their order beginning first with that Coast which lyes between  Cape Gratia de Dios  and  Cape La Vela  And I the rather begin with this part first because this part of the  WestIndies  is all that is subject to change neither is the change altogether  so orderly or certain as the  Monsoons  in the  EastIndies  or the shifting Winds on the Coast of  Brazil  The Common TradeWind on this Coast is betweea the N E and the East This Trade blows constantly from  March  till  November  but is often check'd with Tornadoes in the Months of  May June July  and  August  especially between the River of  Darien  and  Costarica  but to Windward there is a more serene Air and a brisker Wind From  October  till  March  there are Westerly Winds not constant nor violent but blowing moderately sometimes or Days or a Week and then the Breez may blow again as long These VVinds are most in  December  and  January  before and after these two Months the TradeVVind is only check'd a Day or two near the full or change of the Moon and when the VVesterly VVinds blow longest and strongest on the Coast the Easterly Tradewind blows off at Sea as at other times Near  Cape La Vela  the true Trade blows within or Leagues off the Shore when the Westerly Winds blow on the Coast except in a strong North which turns the TradeWind back and on the  Costorica  and between it and the River  Darien  the Westerly Winds as they are more frequent and lasting than toward  Cape La Vela  so also they blow farther of  at Sea as sometimes as far as to or Leagues from the Shore  Therefore Ships bound to Windward if they have far to go either take the opportunity of the Westerly WindSeason or else go through the Gulph of  Florida  and stretch away to the North till they get into a variable Winds way and then run to the Eastward as far as they think convenient before they stretch to the Southward again All that are bound from the  WestIndies  to  Guinea  must take this course if they sail from  Jamaica  because  they must pass thro' the Gulph of  Florida  but from other Islands they may stretch away directly to the North and use the same method  But if Ships have only a small way to Sail to Windward they make use of the Sea and Land Breezes making no account of the time of the Year  The Winds on the Coast of  Brazil  are from  September  till  March  at E N E and from  March  till  September  again they are at South  The Winds in the Bay of  Panama  are from  September  till  March  Easterly and from  March  till  September  again they are at S and S S W  From the  Cape of good Hope  Eastwards as far as the River  Natal  which lies in d South Latitude and  Cape Corientes  in Lat of degrees South the Winds from  May  to  October  are constantly from the West to the North West within Leagues of the Shore They blow hardest at North West When the Wind comes to North West it is commonly stormy and tempestuous Weather attended with much Rain and then the Weather is cold and chilly From  October  till  March  the Winds are Easterly from the E N E to the E S E you have then very fair Weather The E N E Winds are pretty fresh but the Winds at E S E are small and faint sometimes affording some drops of Rain  From  Cape Corientes  to the  RedSea  from  October  till the middle of  January  the Winds are variable but most times Northerly and oft shifting round the Compass The strongest Winds are at North these are often very violent and stormy and accompanied with much Rain and thus it blows about the Island of  Madagascar  and the adjacent Islands  These storms are commonly preceded by a great Sea out of the North From  January  till  May  the Winds are at N E or N N E sine fresh gales and  fair VVeather From  May  till  October  the VVind  are Southerly in  July August  and  September  then are great Calms in the Bay of  Pate  and  Melende  and a strong Current setting into the Bay Therefore Ships that have occasion to pass this way in those three Months ought to keep at least Leagues from the Coast to avoid being driven by the Current into the Bay for these Calms do sometimes last Weeks yet off at Sea at the distance of Leagues the Winds are fresh a  South At the entrance into the  RedSea  near  Cape Guardefuer  there are commonly very hard gales and turbulent Weather even when the Calms are so great in the Bay of  Melende  and not above or Leagues at Sea from the said  Cape  there is also very fair Weather and pretty fresh Gales  In the  RedSea  from  May  till  October  the Winds are strong at S VV and the Current setting out strong so that there is no entring into that Sea in those Months except you keep close to the South Shore there you have LandVVinds and an eddy Current In the Months of  September  or  October  the VVind shuffles about to the North and at last settles at N E then comes fair VVeather on this Coast and so continues till the  Monsoon  shifts which is in  April  or  May  then it first takes one flurry at North and from thence veers to the East and so about to the South and there it settles  The Account of this Coast from the  Cape of good Hope  hither I had from Capt  Rogers  And as this hithermost part of the  EastIndies  even from the  Cape of good Hope  to the  RedSea  which Coast lies nearest N E and S VV hath its shifting Seasons so the other Parts of  India  from the Gulph of  Persia  to  Cape Comorin  has its constant Annual change and from  Comorin  clear round the Bay of  Bengal  the change is no less and even from thence through the  Streights  of  Malacca  and Eastwards as far as  Japan  the shifting TradeWinds do alternately succeed each other as duly as the Year comes about  It cannot be supposed that the TradeWind in all these Places should be exactly on one Point of the Compass For I have already shown that these TradeWinds on any Coast do commonly blow slanting in on the Shore about or Points therefore in Bays where the Land lies on several Rombs the Winds must alter accordingly Tho' that Rule does not hold altogether true in Bays that are deep but is chiefly meant for a pretty streight Coast which lies near alike allowing for Points of Land and small Coves which make no alteration But on the sides and in the bottom of large Bays such as the Bay of  Bengall  the Bay of  Siam  c the VVind differs much on one side of the Bay from what it does on the other and both sides differ from the constant Trade on the open Coast yet all shift in the shifting Seasons which are  April  and  September  at one and the same time to their opposite Points I mean on the open Coast for in some Bays there is a little alteration from that general Rule  These shifting VVinds in the  East Indies  are called  Monsoons  one is called the East  Monsoon  the other the VVest  Monsoon  The East  Monsoon  sets in about  September  and blows till  April  then ceaseth and the VVest  Monsoon  takes place and blows till  September  again  And both the East and VVest  Monsoons  blow in their Seasons slanting in on the Coast as is before described The East  Monsoon  brings fair VVeather the VVest brings Tornadoes and Rain For as I said before in the first Chap of the General TradeVVind at Sea when the Sun comes to the North of the Linethen all Places North of the Equator within the Tropicks are troubled with Clouds and Rain but when the Sun is in Southern Signs then the Sky is  clear And as most of the Trading Countries in the  EastIndies  especially those on the Main Continent do lye between the Line and the Tropick of  Cancer  So these Countries are all subject to the Changes and Seasons already described But the Islands lying under the Line and to the South between the Line and the Tropick of  Capricorn  have contrary Seasons to these Yet do they change at the selfsame time  The difference between the  Monsoons  on the North of the Line and the  Monsoons  on the South of the Line is that in  April  when the West  Monsoon  sets in to the North of the Line the S S W VVinds sets in to the South of the Lat and is called the S S VV  Monsoon  And in  September  when the East  Monsoon  sets in to the North of the Line the N N E VVind blows in South Lat and is called the N N E  Monsoon  And whereas the West  Monsoon  is accompanied with Tornadoes and Rain in North Lat the S S W  Monsoon  which blows at the same time in South Lat is accompanied with fair Weather And as the East  Monsoon  is attended with fair Weather in North Lat the N N E  Monsoon  which blows at the same time in South Lat is attended with Tornadoes and very bad Weather And tho' these Winds do not shift exactly at one time in all Years yet  Sept  and  Apr  are always accounted the turning Months and do commonly participate of both sorts of Winds For these  Monsoons  do as constantly shift by turns as the Year comes about And by means of this change of Wind Ships have the benefit to sail from one part of  India  with one Wind and return with the contrary So that most of the Navigation in  India  depends on the  Monsoons  And Ships do constantly wait for these Changes and the Merchants fit out to any Place according as the Season of the Year draws on And wheresoever they go they certainly dispatch their business so as to return  back again with the next or contrary  Monsoon  For here is no sailing to and from any Place but with the  Monsoon  One carries them out the other brings them back Neither do I know how it were possible for Merchants in these Parts to Trade by Sea from one Country to another were it not for these shifting  Monsoons  For as I have said before most of the Trading Kingdoms in  India  do lye between the Line and the Tropick of  Cancer  And the Land lies so to the North that Ships cannot go to the North of the Tropick and by that means get into variable Winds way as they may and do in the  WestIndies  when they are bound far to the Eastward Neither could it be any advantage to stand off to Sea as they may in the South Sea for that would be of little moment because they would then come so near the Line that they would be always lyable to Tornadoes and Calms and should they cross the Line and run to the Southward of it thinking that way to gain their Passage it is likely they might succeed no better there For that part of the Sea which lies to the Southward of the Line is open and free to the true Trade which seldom fails But indeed that Wind would carry them to the Southward quite beyond the Trade into a variable VVindsway But the Sea is not open there for Ships to pass so far to the Eastward as to gain their Ports  For our  EastIndia  Ships that are bound to  Siam Tunqueen China  c cannot get thither but in the Season of the West  Monsoon  tho' they go directly from  England  and though after they are past the  Cape  they have the convenience to stretch to the Eastward as far as the Land will permit yet they cannot go so far as is convenient before they will be obliged to steer down within the Course of the TradeWinds which would obstruct their Passage if they were as constant here as in other Places And therefore if these Anniversary  Monsoons  did not constantly succeed each other Ships could not pass but one way they might sail to the Westward but there they must lye up or be or Years in their return from a place which may be failed in Weeks yet I say that to Places near each other Ships may and do very often sail against the  Monsoon  and that with success For here are Sea and LandBreezes under the shore and in many Places good Anchoring by which means Ships may stop when they find the Current against them But Voyages of a great distance cannot be made only with Land and SeaWinds without some other helps  In the  WestIndies  we have these helps of LandWinds and SeaBreezes by which we sail from one place to another provided they are no great distance asunder and perform our Voyages well enough but when we are to sail a great way to the Eastward against the TradeWind then we are forced as is said before either to pass thro' the Gulph of  Florida  if we are far to Leeward or else to pass between the Islands and so stretch away to the Northward till we are clear out of the Trade and so get our Longitude that way So in the South Seas also and on the Coasts of  Guinea  the Coast of  Brazil  and the Coast of  Africa  between the  Cape of good Hope  and the  RedSea  there are Sea and Land Breezes which may be made use of to sail against the Trade if the Voyages be short But when we are to sail a great way against the TradeWind we must not wholly depend on the Sea and Land Breezes for then we should be a long time in accomplishing such Voyages In such Cases we have recourse to other helps such as Providence has supplied these Seas with which seems to be wanting in the  EastIndies  as for example in the South Seas on the Coast of  Peru  where the Sontherly Winds blow constantly all the Year there Ships that are bound to the Southward stretch off to the Westward till they are out of the  Coasting TradeWind and there meet with the true Trade at E S E with which they sail as far as they please to the Southward and then steer in for their Port So on the Coast of  Mexico  where the Coasting Trade is westerly there they run off to Sea till they meet the true E N E Trade and then stretch away to the Northward as far as their Port and Ships that come from the  Philipines  bound for the Coast of  Mexico  stretch away to the North as far as degrees to get a Wind to bring them on the Coast  Thus also all Ships bound to the  EastIndies  after they have past the Line in the Atlantick Ocean stretch away to the Southward beyond the Trade and then stand over to the Eastward towards the Cape so in returning home after they have crost the Line to the Northward they steer away North with the Wind at E N E till they are to the Northward of the TradeWind and then direct their Course Easterly All  Guinea  Ships and  WestIndia  Ships do the same in their returns And this is the Benefit of an open Sea But to return  The  Monsoons  among the  EastIndia  Islands that lye to the Southward of the Line as I said before are either at N N E or S S W These also keep time and shift as the  Monsoons  do to the North of the Line in the Months of  April  and  September  but near the Line as a degree or two on each side the Winds are not so constant Indeed there they are so very uncertain that I cannot be particular so as to give any true Account of them Only this I know that Calms are very frequent there as also Tornadoes and sudden Gusts in which the Winds fly in a moment quite round the Compass  CHAP IV Of Sea and LandBreezes  How SeaBreezes differ from Common TradeWinds The time and manner of their Rise And particularly at  Jamaica  Of the LandBreezes The time and manner of their Rise As on the Isthmus of  Darien  and at  Jamaica  The places where these Winds blow strongest or slackest as at Capes and Head Lands deep Bays Lagunes and Islands SealsSkin Bladders used instead of Bark Loggs  SEABreezes generally speaking are no other than the Common TradeWind of the Coasts on which they blow with this difference that whereas all TradeWinds whether they are those that I call the general TradeWinds at Sea or coasting TradeWinds either constant or shifting do blow as well by Night as by Day with an equal briskness except when Tornadoes happen So contrarily SeaWinds are only in the Day and cease in the Night and as all TradeWinds blow constantly near to one Point of the Compass both where the constant TradeWinds are or where they shift on the contrary these SeaWinds do differ from them in this that in the Morning when they first spring up they blow commonly as the TradeWinds on the Coast do at or near the  same Point of Compass but about MidDay they fly off or Points further from the Land and so blow almost right in on the Coast especially in fair Weather for then the SeaBreezes are truest as for instance on the Coast of  Argola  the Land lies almost North and South there the TradeWind is from the S S W to the S W the true SeaBreezes near the shore are at W by S or W S W and so of any other Coast  These SeaBreezes do commonly rise in the Morning about Nine a Clock sometimes sooner sometimes later they first approach the shore so gently as if they were afraid to come near it and of  times they make some faint breathings and as if not willing to offend they make a halt and seem ready to retire I have waited many a time both ashore to receive the pleasure and at Sea to take the benefit of it  It comes in a fine small black Curle upon the Water when as all the Sea between it and the shore not yet reach'd by it is as smooth and even as Glass in Comparison in half an Hour's time after it has reached the shore it fans pretty briskly and so increaseth gradually till a Clock then it is commonly strongest and lasts so till or a very brisk gale about at Noon it also veers off to Sea or Points or more in very fair Weather After a Clock it begins to dye away again and gradually withdraws its force till all is spent and about a Clock sooner or later according as the Weather is it is lull'd asleep and comes no more till the next Morning  These Winds are as constantly expected as the day in their proper Latitudes and seldom fail but in the wet Season On all Coasts of the Main whethre in the  East  or  WestIndies  or  Guinea  they rise in the Morning and withdraw towards the Evening yet  Capes and HeadLands have the greatest benefit of them where they are highest rise earlier and blow later  Bays contrarily have the disadvantage for there they blow but faintly at best and their continuance is but short Islands that lye nearest East and West have the benefit of these Winds on both sides equally for if the Wind is at S W or S W and by S on the South side of any Island then on the North side it would be at N W or N W by N  i e  in fair Weather but if turbulent Weather it would be E S E on the Southside and E N E on the other But this true Sea Breez does not veer so far out except only near the shore as about or Leagues distant for farther than that you will find only the right Coasting TradeWind This I have experienced in several Parts of the World particularly at  Jamaica  about which I have made many Voyages both on the North and the South side where I have experienced the SeaBreezes very much to differ for on the South side I have found the true SeaWind after a Clock and in very fair Weather at S or S S E though it sprung up in the Morning at E S E or S E And on the North side I have found the SeaBreeze at N or N N E though it rose in the Morning at E N E but whether there may be the like difference about smaller Islands as at  Barbadoes  c I cannot determine tho' I am apt to believe there is not So much far the SeaWinds next of the LandBreezes  Land Breezes are as remarkable as any Winds that I have yet treated of they are quite contrary to the SeaBreezes for those blow right from the shore but the SeaBreez right in upon the shore and as the SeaBreezes do blow in the Day and rest in the Night so on the contrary these do blow in the Night and rest in the Day and so they do alternately  succeed each other For when the SeaBreezes have performed their Offices of the Day by breathing on their respective Coasts they in the Evening do either withdraw from the Coast or lye down to rest Then the LandVVinds whose Office is to be breath in the Night moved by the same order of Divine Impulse do rouze out of their private recesses and gently fan the Air till the next Morning and then their task ends and they leave the Stage  There can be no proper time set when they do begin in the Evening or when they retire in the Morning for they do not keep to an hour but they commonly spring up between and in the Evening and last till or in the Morning They both come and go away again earlier or later according to the VVeather the Season of the Year or some accidental Cause from the Land For on some Coasts they do rise earlier blow fresher and remain later than on other Coasts as I shall shew hereafter  They are called LandVVinds because they blow off shore contrary to the SeaBreez which way soever the Coast lies Yet I would not so be understood as if these VVinds are only found to breathe near the shores of any Land and not in the Inland Parts of such Countries remote from the Sea for in my Travels I have found them in the very heart of the Countries that I have passed through as particularly on the Isthmus of  Darien  and the Island of  Jamaica  Both which places I have travelled over from Sea to Sea yet because these are but small Tracts of Land in comparison with the two main Bodies of Land of  Mexico  and  Peru  and those vast Regions in  Asia  and  Africa  lying within the Tropicks I cannot determine whether the LandVVinds are there as I have fonnd them in my small Travels therefore I shall only confine this particular Discourse  to these and other Places within my ow  Observations I shall begin first with the Isthmu  of  Darien  there I have found the LandWinds it the middle of the Country blowing all Night and till or a Clock in the Morning before I could perceive the SeaBreeze to arise and that not discernable many times but by the flying of the Clouds especially if I was in a Valley and it was in Vallies that I did chiefly perceive the LandWinds which blew in some places one way in others contrary or sideways to that according as the Vallies lay pend up between the Mountains and that without any respect to either the North or the South Seas but indeed near either side of the Land they always bent their course towards the nearest Sea unless there was any Hill between them and the Sea and then they took their Course along in the Vallies but from both shores as well from the North as the South they blow right forth into the Sea  In the Island of  Jamaica  these LandWinds are in the middle of the Country also I have found them so as I travelled from one side of the Island to the other having lain Nights by the way as I had before observed them when I liv'd at Miles Walk where I continued about Months but there and in other Islands the LandWinds do blow towards the nearest shores and so from thence off to Sea whether the shore's lye East West North or South  These Winds blow off to Sea a greater or less distance according as the Coast lies more or less exposed to the SeaWinds For in some Places we find them brisk or Leagues off shore in other Places not so many Miles and in some Places they scarce peep without the Rocks or if they do sometimes in very fair Weather make a sally out a Mile or they are not lasting but suddenly vanish away  though yet there are every Night as fresh LandWinds ashore at those Places as in any other part of the World  Places most remarkable for the fewest or faintest LandWinds are those that lye most open to the Common TradeWinds as the East ends of any Islands where the TradeWinds do blow in upon the Shore or the HeadLands on Islands or Continents that are open to the Seabreez especially where the TradeWind blows down sideways by the Coast for there such HeadLands as stretch farthest out to Sea are most exposed to Winds from the Sea and have the less benefit of the LandBreezes  I shall give a few Instances of either And first of all begin with the N E and S E Points of the Island of  Jamaica  These Points are at the East end of the Island one is at the very Extreme of the North side towards the East the other on the South Extreme towards the same Point at these two Places we seldom light of a LandWind nor very often at the End of the Island between them except near the shore For that Reason the  Sloopmen  of  Jamaica  that Trade round the Island are commonly put to their Trumps when they come there in their Voyages For if they meet no LandWind they are obliged to beat about by turning to Windward against the Seabreez in the Day time they then curse these Points of Land and are foolishly apt to believe that some  Daemon  haunts there  And if they are or days in beating about as sometimes they are when they return to  PortRoyal  they will talk as much of their Fatigues as if they had been beating a Month to double the  Cape of Good Hope  though indeed the Men are brisk enough and manage their Sloops very well which also are generally very good Boats to sail on a Wind I think they are the best small TradingBoats in the King's Dominions  Point  Pedro  on the  Southside  of the Island is another very bad Point to double if a  Ship  come from the Westend of the Island This Point runs out far into the  Sea  and is not only destitute of the Common LandVVinds But if there is any Current setting to Leeward here the  Sloopmen  meet it Therefore they are many times longer beating about it then about the two former Points of the  SouthEast  and the  NorthEast  and not without bestowing some Curses upon it Nay some Captains of Privateers when they have been beating about it have stood close into the Point and fired their Guns to kill the old  Daemon  that they say inhabits there to disturb poor  Seamen  I have related these odd Passages to shew how ignorant Men are that cannot see the Reason of it And because I am not willing to leave my Reader in the dark I shall give a few Instances more on this subject The North side of  Jucatan  at the entrance into the Bay of  Campeachy  gives us another Instance of bad LandVVinds and commonly where the LandVVinds are scanty the SeaBreezes are but indifferent neither This will partly appear by what I have observed of them on this Coast between  Cape Catoach  and  Cape Condecedo  at the entrance of the  Bay  of  Campeachy  which two places are about Eighty Leagues distant for there the Land trends East and West It is a streight Coast and lies all of it equally exposed to the TradeVVind which is commonly there at E N E To the VV of these Places the Sea and LandVVinds do as duly succeed each other as on any other Coast but here they are each of them of a Bastard kind for the SeaBreezes are at N E by E which is no better than a Coast TradeVVind and the LandVVind is at E S E or S E by E whereas if the Winds were as true there as on other Coasts the SeaBreez would be at N N E  sometimes at N and the LandWinds would be at S S E and S as they are indeed close under the shore which if they do at any time come off from they are very faint The Land on this Coast is low and even and the LandWinds ashore are pretty brisk  The Capes on the  Peruvian  Coast in the  South Seas  will more fully make it appear that HeadLands do seldom afford any LandWinds I shall only Instance in  Cape Passao  in Lat Minutes  South Cape St Laurence  in Lat d  South  and  Cape Blanco  in d  South  I have pass'd by them all several times and at different Seasons yet did never find any Landwinds there though between these Places there are very good Landwinds Therefore  Ships  that sail to the  Southward  against the Breeze must beat it about by hard Labour especially about  Cape Blanco  for that lyes more exposed than the other and if there is any Current as commonly the Spaniards are a long time getting about sometimes a Fortnight or Weeks and when they have split their  Sails  which are seldom very good they run back to  Guiaquill  to mend them again We found it hard getting about tho' our  Sails  were good and I think we could work our  Ships  better than the  Spaniards  are ever able to do in those  Seas  I have already given several Instances of such Places as have no Landwinds or at least but very ordinary ones I shall next proceed in order to shew where the strongest or best LandWinds are met with and then I shall speak of those Places where there blows a moderate and indifferent Gale between both Extreams That so any one may judge by the Lying of the Land whether it may afford a good Landwind or know  The briskest Landwinds are commonly in deep Bays in great Lakes within Land and among great Ranges of Islands or small Keys that lye near the shore I shall give Instances of all these And as for Bays I shall first pitch on the Bay of  Campeachy  which lies between  Cape Condecedo  and the HighLand of  St Martin  between both these Places the Landwinds are as brisk or Leagues off at  Sea  as in any Place that I know In the Cod or Middle of the Bay the Land trends from East to West there the  SeaBreezes  are at North and the Landwinds at South they commonly begin to blow at or a Clock in the Evening and continue till or the next Morning in the dry  Season  especially In that Bay there is an Island call'd by the  English BeefIsland  from the multitude of Bulls and Cows that inhabit it The smell of these wild Cattle is driven off to  Sea  by the Landwinds so fresh that by it Masters of  Ships  sailing in the Night on this Coast have known where they were and have presently anchored that Night and come into the Island of  Trist  the next Day whereas they would otherwise have past farther to the Westward quite out of their way if they had not smell'd the strong scent of these Cattle  So all the bottom of the Bay of  Mexico  even from the HighLand of  St Martin  down to  Lavera Cruz  and from thence Northerly towards the River  Meschasipi  affords good Landwinds and Seabreezes The Bay of  Honduras  also and almost all the Coast between it and  Cape La Vela  affords the like allowing for the Capes and Points of Land which lye between where it fails more or less as the  Points  do lye more or less exposed to the SeaBreezes  So in the  South Seas  the Bays of  Panama Gui  quil Paita  c have their fresh Landwinds and Seabreezes But in some Places as particularly at  Paita  the Landwinds do not spring up till a Clock in  the Night but then are always very fresh and last till or the next Morning and they are constant all the Year long Whereas in the Bay of  Panama  and also in all the Bays and Coasts of the other or North side of  America  already described they are not so constant in the wet  Season  as they are in the dry  The Bay of  Campeachy  will also afford us Instances of the Landwinds that blow in  Logunes  As for Instance the  Lagune  of  Trist  which is about or Leagues long and broad is barricadoed from the Sea by the Island of  Trist  There the Landwinds blow in the dry  Season  from or a Clock in the Evening till or in the Morning There are two other  Lagunes  lying within that and parted from it by low  MangroveLand  there the Landwinds are fresher and the SeaBreeze duller and of a less continuance than in the  Lagune  of  Trist  Nay sometimes the Landwind blows all Day so in the  Lagune  of  Maracabo  to Windward of  Cape Alta Vola  the Landwinds are very fresh and lasting The like may be said of the  Lagune  of  Venizuella  or  Comana  Sometimes in the forementioned  Lagunes  the Landwinds do blow for or Days and Nights together scarce suffering the SeaBreez to breath there though at the same time the SeaBreez may blow fresh out at Sea and if the SeaBreez at such times should make a bold  Sally  into these  Lagunes  it would be but of a short continuance On the other Hand at Capes and HeadLands more exposed to SeaBreezes the Landwinds are shier of coming there than the Seawinds are into  Lagunes  Neither may we forget the Harbour of  Jamaica  for there are very good Landwinds It is compassed in on one side with a long Neck of Sand and many small Islands at the mouth of it and within there is a  pretty deep Lake in which are constant Sea and Landwinds by which the Wherrymen run with full sail both to  Legamy  or  Passage Fort  from the Town and back again They go away with the SeaBreeze and return with the Landwind Therefore Passengers that have occasion to go either way wait for the coming of these Winds except their Business requires hast for then they are rowed against the Breez and tho' the Landwinds do sometimes fail or come very late yet the Wherries seldom stay beyond their constant Hours of or a Clock and sometimes the Landwinds do come by or but when they come so early it is commonly after a Tornado from the Land This may suffice as to the Landwinds in Lakes or Bays  As to what may be spoken concerning the Landwinds among Islands I shall only mention Places both of them in the  WestIndies  the first are the  Keys  of  Cuba  which are abundance of small Islands bordering on the  South side  of  Cuba  reaching in length from East to West or near those Points as the Island lies about Leagues and in some Places reaching near Leagues from the said Island Among these Islands even from the outermost of them quite home to  Cuba  there are very brisk Landwinds They spring up early in the Evening and blow late in the Morning The  Jamaica  Turtlers visit these  Keys  with good success for Turtle all the Year long and from thence bring most of their Turtle wherewith the Market of  PortRoyal  is served The other Islands I shall mention are the  Sambaloe  Islands betwixt  Cape Samblass  and  Golden Island  tho' they are not so large a Range as the  Keys  of  Cuba  yet do they afford very good Landwinds near as good as the  Keys  of  Cuba  do And thus much for the Places where the best as well as where the scantiest or faintest Landwinds are  found I shall next give some Instances of the Medium between both Extreams  I have already shewn that Capes and such HeadLands as lye out farthest from the rest of the shore are thereby most exposed to the Seawinds and consequently the Landwinds are there much fainter than in other Places especially in deep Bays or Lagunes within Land or among Islands and small Keys near the Land All which is no more than my own experience has taught me I shall now shew how the Landwinds blow on Coasts that do lye more level As all Coasts have their Points and bendings so accordingly the Landwinds are fresher or fainter as you come either towards these bendings or towards intermitting Points or HeadLands  I shall give an Instance of this by shewing how the Winds are on the Coast of  Coraccos  It is as streight a  Shore  as I can pitch on yet full of small Bays divided from each other by a like number of Ridges of HighLand that shoot forth their Heads a little way without the Bays on each side There in the Night or Morning while the Landwind blows we find fresh Gales out of the Bays but when we come abreast of the HeadLands we find it Calm yet see the Breeze curling on the Water on both sides of us and sometimes get a spurt of it to help us forward and having recovered the Wind out of the next Bay we pass by the Mouth of it presently till we come to the next Head and there we lye becalmed as before  These Bays are not above half a Mile or a Mile wide neither are the Heads much wider but these Heads of the Ridges lying in between the Bays have steep Cliffs against the Sea and whereever I have met the like steep Cliffs against the Sea I have seldom found any LandWinds But in all other Places where the Bays strike deeper into the Land there we find the Landwinds more  lasting and strong and where the Points are farther out there are still the less Landwinds and the brisker SeaBreezes For the Capes and smaller Points on all shores seem to be so many Barricadoes to break off the violence of the SeaBreezes for this we always find when we are turning to Windward being to Leeward of a Cape that the Breez is moderate especially if we keep very near the shore but when once we come within a Mile more or less of the Cape and stand off to Sea as soon as we get without it we find such a hussing Breez that sometimes we are not able to ply against it but in the Night we find a fresh Landwind to Leeward tho' when we come to the Cape we find it Calm or perhaps sometimes meet with a Seawind The LandBreezes on the Coast of  Guinea  between  Cape St Anns  and  Cape Palmas  mentioned in the second Chapter of this Discourse are at E blowing brisk Leagues off shore the Seawinds there are at S W The Landwinds on the Coast of  Angola  are at E N E the Seawinds at W S W these are very true Winds of both kinds  The Landwinds on the Coast of  Peru  and  Mexico  in the  South Seas  are in most Places right off from the shore else the Fishermen could never go out to Sea as they do on BarkLoggs And as the Landwinds are true there so are the SeaBreezes also for with the Landwind they go out to Fish and return in again with the Seawinds In some Places they use SealsSkins instead of BarkLoggs they are made so tight that no Bladder is tighter To these they have long Necks like the Neck of a Bladder into which they put a Pipe and blow them up as we do Bladders two of these being fastned together a Man sets astride them having one before and the other behind him and so sits firmer than in a Troopers Saddle His Paddle is like a  Quarterstaff with a broad Blade at each end with this he strikes the  Sea  back first on one side and then on the other with each end of his Paddle and so gives himself fresh way through the Water  In the  EastIndies  also there are true SeaBreezes as well on the Islands as on the Main On Islands as at  Bantam  in the Island  Java  and at  Achin  in the Island  Sumatra  and in many Places on the Island  Mindanao  And on the Main also as particularly at  Fort St George  on the Coast  Coromandel  There the Landwinds blow right off from the shore and the Seawinds right in but sometimes they come slanting in and about  Christmas  they blow from the N E or N N E I found them so when I came on the Coast and being advised of it by Mr  Coventry  in whose Sloop I then was I fell in with the Land or Leagues to the Northward of the Fort and had a brisk Northerly Seawind to bring me into the Road  I think these Instances are enough to shew how these Landwinds do usually blow in most parts of the World should I be very particular 'tis not a larger Treatise then I intend this to be would hold a quarterpart of it But I have been more particular in the  WestIndies  and  South Seas  because these Landwinds are of more use there than in the  EastIndies  For though sometimes Men in the  EastIndies  do turn against the  Monsoons  yet they do generally tarry for them before they budge  Indeed these Winds are an extraordinary blessing to those that use the Sea in any part of the World within the Tropicks for as the constant Tradewinds do blow there could be no sailing in these Seas But by the help of the Sea and LandBreezes Ships will sail or hundred Leagues as particularly from  Jamaica  to the  Lagune  of  Trist  in  the Bay of  Campeachy  and then back again all against the Tradewind And I think this is one of the longest Voyages that is used of this kind If any of our  Jamaica Sloops  do go to  Trist  and design to carry their Wood to  Curasao  then they put through the Gulph of  Florida  The  Spaniards  also that come from any part of the Bay of  Mexico  and are bound to any Place to Windward of the Island  Cuba  are wont to put through the Gulph and so stretch away to the Northward till they come clear of the Trade and then stand away as far as they please to the Eastward This is also the usual way from  Jamaica  to  Barbadoes  though sometimes they turn up by the  Carribbee  Islands only taking the Benefit of these Sea and Landwinds So also  Ships  may and do pass from  Portobello  to  Carthagena  or to  St Martha  or to any other Place by the help of these Breezes if the distance is not too far So by taking the Advantage of these Winds Sloops in the  WestIndies  sail clear round the Islands or to any part of them in a short time  In the South Seas also the  Spaniards  in their Voyages from  Panama  to  Lima  by taking the Advantage of these Winds do sail as high as  Cape Blan  o  but in all their Voyages to the Southward of that Cape they stand quite off to Sea into the Trade Thus you see the use and advantage of them  The Seamen that sail in  Sloops  or other small Vessels in the  WestIndies  do know very well when they shall meet a brisk LandWind by the Foggs that hang over the Land before Night for it is a certain sign of of a good LandWind to see a thick Fogg lye still and quiet like Smoak over the Land not stirring any way and we look out for such Signs when we  are plying to Windward For if we see no Fog over the Land the Landwind will be but faint and short that Night These signs are to be observed chiefly in fair Weather for in the wet  Season  Foggs do hang over the Land all the Day and it may be neither Landwind nor SeaBreeze stirring If in the Afternoon also in fair Weather we see a Tornado over the Land it commonly sends us forth a fresh LandWind  These Landwinds are very cold and though the SeaBreezes are always much stronger yet these are colder by far The SeaBreezes indeed are very comfortable and refreshing for the hottest time in all the Day is about or a Clock in the Morning in the interval between both Breezes For then it is commonly Calm and then People pant for breath especially if it is late before the SeaBreez comes but afterwards the Breez allays the heat However in the Evening again after the SeaBreez is spent it is very hot till the Landwind springs up which is sometimes not till a Clock or after  For this reason Men when they go to Bed uncloath themselves and lye without any thing over them Nay the ordinary sort of People spread mats at their Doors or else in their Yards in  Jamaica  and lye down to sleep in the open Air  In the  East Indies  at  Fort St George  also Men take their Cotts or little FieldBeds and put them into the Yards and go to sleep in the Air And Seamen aboard Ships in these hot Countries lye on the Deck till the Landwind comes  The Inhabitants of  Jamaica  or  Fort St George  have somewhat to cover themselves when the Landwind comes beside a Pillow on their  Breast or between their Arms But Seamen who have wrought hard all Day lye naked and exposed to the Air it may be all Night long before they awake without any covering especially if they have had their dose of Punch But next Morning they are scarce able to budge being stiff with cold that brings them to Fluxes and that to their Graves and this is the fate of many stout and brave Seamen and it is a great pity that Masters of Ships have so little regard for their Men as not by some good Orders to prohibit this dangerous Custom of lying abroad and naked in the Nights  CHAP V Of Landwinds and SeaBreezes peculiar to some Coasts at some particular seasons of the Year as also of some Winds that produce strange Effects  Of the  SummasentaWinds  in the Bay of  Campeachy  Of the Winds peculiar to the Coasts of  Carthagena  Winds on the  Mexican  Coasts call'd  Popogaios  Others on the Coast of  Coromandel  call'd  Terrenos  The same about  Malabar  but at a different Season As also in the  Persian Gulph  And of the  Hermatans  on the Coast of  Guinea  I Shall begin with the  SummasentaWinds  as they are called which blow in the Bay of  Campeachy  These are Winds that come in the Months of  Feb March  and  April  and they blow only in that Bay between the HighLand of St  Martin  and  Cape Condecedo  which Places are about Leagues asunder They are properly speaking neither SeaBreezes nor true Landwinds yet in respect of their blowing in some measure from the shore they are in that somewhat of kin to the Landwinds These Winds are commonly at E S E in the Cod or Middle of the Bay where the Land lies E and W and the true Landwinds there are at S S E but from thence towards  Cape Condecedo  the Land trends away N E and N N E and N So that they become Landwinds there respecting the Land from  whence they blow but then they differ both from Sea and LandBreezes in respect to their duration For these  SummasentaWinds  blow or Days sometimes a Week both Night and Day before they cease They are commonly dry Winds and blow very fresh and Ships that go from  Trist  with Logwood at the time when these Winds blow will be at  Cape Condecedo  in or Days whereas if they go at any other time it will take up or Days tho' seldom more than that For here are good Landwinds and SeaBreezes at other times  These Winds are commonly colder than the Seawinds though not so cold as the Landwinds yet stronger than either I never could perceive that these Winds did make any alteration on our Bodies different from other Winds But the Tides when these Winds blow on that Coast are very small especially in the  Lagunes  of  Trist  so that the  LegwoodBa  s  that bring the Wood aboard of the Ships are then forced to lye still for want of Water to float them over some flats in the  Lagunes  On the Coast of  Ca  thagena  there are a peculiar sort of Winds that blow in the Months of  April May  and  June  so very fierce that Ships are not able to ply to Windward on that Coast while these Winds last These Winds blow about or  Leagues  to  Windward  of  Carthagena  Town and about to Leeward of it They are very fierce from the middle of the Channel between it and  Hispaniola  and so continue almost to the Coast of  Carthagena  Tho' they are sometimes a little fainter within or  Leagues  of the shore especially Mornings and Evenings They commonly rise in the Morning before day sometimes at or a Clock and so continue till or at Night and thus they will blow or Days together very fiercely At this time the Landwinds besides their short continuance are very faint and blow but a little way off shore So that from or at Night till  in the  Morning 'tis quite Calm and not one breath of Wind from a  League  distant off the shore tho' or further off you'll find the Breez and nearer a small  LandWind  These Winds are at E N E as the Common Trade is whereas the SeaBreezes are at N E by N or N N E  While these fierce Winds stay the Sky is commonly clear without any Cloud to be seen tho' doubtless 'tis imperceptibly hazy for then the Sun does not give a true black shade on the Ground but very faint and dusky The Horizon too looks very dusky thick and hazy and while the Sun is near the Horizon either in the Morning or Evening it looks very red Sometimes tho' but seldom when these Winds blow the Sky is overcast with small Clouds which afford some drizling small Rain But tho' these Winds are so fierce on the Coast of  Carthagena  yet both to Windward and to Leeward at the distances beforementioned the Breezes blow moderate as at other times For the Sea and Landwinds do there keep their constant and regular Courses Neither are the Coasts of  Hispaniola  or  Jamaica  troubled with these fierce Winds any nearer than half Channel over as was said before  It has not been my fortune to have been on this Coast when these Winds have blown yet I have had the Relation of it so often and from so many Persons that I am very well satisfi'd of the truth of it Nay it is so generally known among the  Jamaica  Seamen and Privateers that they call a  Talkative Person  in derision a  CarthageneBreeze  I remember or Men that went by that Name and I knew them by no other tho' I was in the same Ship with them several Months  Some of our English Frigots that have been sent to  Jamaica  have experienced these Breezes when the Governour has sent them upon business to that Coast For plying between  Portobello  and  Carthagena  when they have been within Leagues of  Carthagena  they  have met with the Sea Breez so strong that they have been forced to riff their Topsail which even then they could not maintain but have been obliged to furle it quite up and so with only their lower Sails which sometimes they have been forced to riff too have been beating or Days to get only so many Leagues which tho' at last they have done yet has it been with much trouble and not without damage to their Sails and Rigging Neither can I forget a  Squadron  of French Frigots Commanded by the Count  de Estrees  that came to  Jamaica  and demanded leave of the Governour to Wood and Water there which because it seemed strange that they should want in coming only from  Petit Guavas  it was demanded of them why they came from thence so ill provided They said they went from  Petit Guavas  over to the Coast of  Carthagena  with a design to have plyed to Windward under that shore but met the Breezes so hard on the Coast that they were not able to hold up their sides against it and for that Reason stood back again towards  Petit Guavas  but not being able to fetch it therefore they came to Wood and Water at  Jamaica  designing to go from thence thro' the Gulph And tho' the Pilots of  Jamaica  did all conclude that the Breezetime was past by more than a Month yet the Governour gave them leave to Wood and Water at  Blewfields Bay  and sent one Mr  Stone  to be their Pilot thither This was in and in one of our Summer Months but I can't tell which tho' I was there  In the  South Seas  on the  Mexican  Coast between  Cape Blanco  in the  Lat  of D M North and  Realeja  in  Lat  North which two Places are about  Leagues  distance there are Winds which blow only in the Months of  May June  and  July  call'd by the  Spaniards Popogaios  They blow Night and Day without intermission sometimes or Days or a Week together They are very brisk Winds but not violent I have been in one of them when w  went from  Caldera  Bay bound to  Realeja  mentioned in my Voyage round the World Chap Pag which blew at  North  In the  EastIndies  on the Coast of  Coromandel  there are Winds call'd by the  Portuguese Terrenos  because they blow from the  Land  These are not those  LandWinds  that I have already treated of for these blow only in  June July  and  Aug  and are in several respects quite contrary to them For whereas the true  LandWinds  blow only in the Night including Evenings and Mornings on the contrary these blow or Days without intermission nay sometimes a Week or Days together and as the true Nocturnal  LandWinds  are very cold on the contrary these are the hottest of all Winds I ever heard of They come with hot Blooms such as I have mentioned in my  Voyage round the World  Chap Pag These  Winds  are at  West  and they blow only in the Months of  June July  and  August  which is the  West MonsoonSeason  tho' the proper  Monsoon  then on this Coast is S W When these hot Winds come the better sort of People at  Fort St George  keep close They also shut up their Windows and Doors to keep them out and I have heard Gentlemen that lived there say that when they have been thus shut up within Doors they have been sensible when the Wind shifted by the Change they have felt in their Bodies And notwithstanding that these Winds are so hot yet the Inhabitants don't sweat while they last for their Skins are hard and rough as if they had been parched by the Fire especially their Faces and Hands yet does it not make them sick The Sands which are raised by these Winds are a great annoyance to those whose business lyes abroad and who can't keep their Houses For many times they wheel about and raise the  Sands  so thick that it flies like  moak in Peoples Eyes and the  Ships  also  that lye in the road at that time have their Decks covered with this  Sand  On the Coast of  Malabar  they have of these sons of Winds also but not at the same time of the Year For as these on the Coast of  Coromandel  blow in the Months of  June July  and  August  when the  West Monsoon  Reigns on the contrary on the  Malabar  Coast they blow in the Months of  December January  and  February  when the East or North East  Monsoon  blows for then the Easterly Wind which is then the true  Monsoon  comes from over the  Land  of this Coast This being the  Westside  as the Coast of  Coromandel  is the  Eastside  of this long  EastIndian  Promontory  The  Person  Gulph is as remarkable for these hot Winds as either of the former they come there in the Months of  June July  and  August  in the  WestMonsoon  time and the heat there by all Accounts does by far exceed that on the other two Coasts  The European Merchants that are imployed in the Ports within the King of  Persia  his Dominions do leave their Coast Habitations and Business there during these hot Months and spend their time at  Ispahan  till the Air is more agreeable to their Bodies but their  Servants  must indure it And if any  Ships  are there then the  Seamen  also must do as well as they can 'Tis reported the Commanders do keep BathingTroughs full of Water to lye and wallow in and hide their Bodies from the noisom hot Blooms I was never in any of these hot  Winds  for I went from  Fort St George  before they came on the Coast  On the Coast of  Guinea  there are a particular sort of Landwinds which are very remarkable not for their Heat as those lastmentioned but for their exceeding Cold and Searching Nature They are called  Harmatans  I have had an Account of them from several who have Traded to  Guinea  but more especially from a very Sensible and Experienced Gentleman Mr  Greenhill  Commissioner of His Majesties Navy at  Portsmouth  who upon my Request was pleased to send me the following Account which the Reader cannot have better than in his own Words Where together with the  Harmatans  he gives an Account also of all the Winds on that Coast  Mr  Greenhill's  Letter  SIR  I Have been very ill since my return Home with the Gout so that I have not been capable of answering your Expectation But being a little better recovered I shall make as good a return to your Enquiry of the  Harmatans  on the Coast of  Guinea  as my Circumstances will permit The usual Time of their blowing is between the latter part of  December  and the beginning of  February  before and beyond which Seasons they never exceed They are of so very cold sharp and piercing a Nature that the Seams of the Floors of our Chambers and the Sides and Decks of our Ships as for as they are above Water will open so wide as that with facility you may put a Caulking Iron a considerable way into them in which condition they continue so long as the  Harmatan  blows which is sometimes two or three and very rarely five Days which is the very utmost I ever observed or heard of and when they are gone they close again and are as tight as if it never had been The Natives themselves and all Persons who inhabit  those parts during that short Season to preven  their pernicious Effects are obliged to confine themselves within Doors where they endeavour their own security by rendering their Habitations as close and impenetrable as possible Neither will they once sti  abroad unless induced thereto by a more than ordinary Occasion It is as destructive to the Cattle also whose safe Guard consists in their Proprietors Care who against this Season ought to provide some such like place for them Otherwise they must expect but a pittiful Account when the Season is over for it most certainly destroys them and that in a very short time  This I accidentally experimented by exposing a couple of Goats to the Asperity thereof which in four hours space or thereabouts were depriv'd of Life Nay we our selves unless assisted by the like Conveniency and the benefit of some sweet Oyls to correct the Air cannot fetch our Breath sofreely as at other times but are almost suffocated with too frequent and Acid Respirations They generally blow between the E and E N E to the Northward of which they never exceed being the most settled and steddy but fresh Gale I ever observ'd coming without Thunder Lightning or Rain but close gloomy Weather the Sun not shining all the time And when they expire the Tradewind which constantly blows on that Coast at W S W and S W returns with the accustomary seasonableness of Weather  The Coast of  Africa  from  Cape Palmas  to  Capes Formosa  lies E and E by N and near those Pointy the LandBreezes blow on that Coast which commo  ll begin about seven in the Evening and continue al  Night till near that time the next Morning During which interval we are troubled with slinking Fogs and Mists off Shore which by return of the Sea Breezes upon the opposite Points are all driven away  and we have the benefit of them in a curious fresh Gale till about in the Afternoon  And here let me Note it for a general Observation That in these and all eother Places within the Tropicks as far as ever I took notice the Wind is drawn by the Land For if an Island or HeadLand were inclining to a circular Form the Sea and LandBreezes fall in Diametrically opposite to that part where you are So that if you are on the South side the SeaBreez shall be at South and the LandBreez when it comes in its Season at North  In getting on the Coast we indeavour to fall in with  Cape Mount  or  Cape Miserada  which is about Leagues to the E S Eastward thereof and after that we double  Cape Palmas  whence as aforesaid the Land trends away E by N the Current near the shore sets upon that Point down into the  Bite  But in getting off we as much attempt if possible to lay hold of  St Thomas  and thence to run to the Southward of the  Line  perhaps or Degrees for the further Southerly we go the stronger we find the Gales and more beneficial for getting off the  African  Coast but those who keep to the Northward thereof generally meet with more Calms and consequently longer Voyages ensue In or about those Latitudes we continue till we are got between and Degrees to the Westward of  Cape Lopez de Gonsalvo  and then we cross again to go either for  England  or the  West Indies  But by the way let me observe to you that when once we are to the Westward of the said  Cape  and in South Latitude the  Current  sets Northerly and the Wind to Degrees of Latitude is at E S E as to the like number of Degrees on the North side of the Line it blows at E N E Neither did I ever observe any Mutation of the Currents unless in the TornadoSeason when during their blowing they commonly set to Windward tho' perhaps the Moon upon Full and Change may  have the like influence there as in other Places but I never took any particular notice thereof  The said  Tornadoes  usually come in the beginning of  Apr  and seldom relinquish the  Gold Coast  till  July  commences and with frequent visits make us sensible of their Qualities We have sometimes three or four in a day but then their continuance is but short perhaps not above two hours and the strength or fury it may be about a quarter or half an Hour but accompanied with prodigious Thunder Lightning and Rain and the violence of the Wind so extraordinary as that it has sometimes roled up the Lead wherewith the Houses are cover'd as close and compactly as possible it could be done by the Art of Man The Name implies a variety of Winds But the strength of them is generally at  S E  and by Ships that are bound off the Coast they are made use of to get to Windward  I shall conclude with that most worthy Observation of the Season wherein the Rains begin which on the  Gold Coast  is about the th of  April  and this may be generally remarked from d N to d South Latitude that they follow the Sun within or d And so proceed with him till be has touched the  Tropick  and returns to the like Station again This I shall illustrate by the following Example  Viz Cape Corso  Castle lies in d North About the th of  April  the Sun has near degrees N Declination At that time the Rains begin and continue with the Inhabitants of that Place until he has performed his Course to the greatest obliquity from off the Equator and returned to the like Position South The same I suppose may be observed and understood of other places within the  Tropicks  The  Variation  of which in the Y ar I made frequent Observations was d m Westerly And it generally  flows  at the aforesaid place  S S E  and  N N W  upon the  Full  and  Change  The Water rising upon  Spring Tides  about or Foot up and down I remain  SIR  Your Humble Servant  Henry Greenhill  From His Majesties Yard near  Portsmouth  the th  June    Upon the Receipt of this from the Gentleman aforesaid I wrote to him again to have his Opinion about what I have said concerning the particular Longitude in which 'tis best to cross the Line in going from  Guinea  to the  WestIndies  And so much of his Answer as concerns this Matter was in these Words  Mr  Greenhill  's second Letter  SIR  I Do not dissent from Crossing the Line at or d Longitude Westward of  Cape Lopes  and it may as well be done at provided the Breezes continue fresh But if we have but little Winds we generally run on the South side of the  Line  till we reach the distance West And then Crossing we steer away West North VVest and VVest by North for  Barbadoes  And this you may observe as I have already hinted to you that the further we keep to the Southward  of the  Line  the fresher and consequently more advantageous the Breezes are  I remain  SIR Your obliged Friend And most humble Servant  Henry Greenhill  And here I judge it will not be unacceptable to the Reader to insert two other Letters from an Experienced Captain of a Ship because they have a general Relation to the Subject I am now upon as well as to the Coast of  Guinea  in particular  Part of two Letters from Captain  John Covant  of  Portbury  to a Gentleman in  London  LETTER I  Honoured Sir  I Have sent Mr  Dampier's  Book which you were pleased to send me to Captain  S  I have gone through it and find it very well worth my time being very delightsome and I believe true  I have made some Remarks on it as having found the like of what be asserts in other places As  p  mention is made of the  SuckingFish  or  Remora  as Mr  Dampier  calls it These are mighty plenty on the Coast of  Angola  and at  Madagascar  and between  Cape Lopes de Gonsalvas  and the River  Gabon  They are shaped as he describes them  As to what he saith  p  I have found the Indians in the Gulph of  Florida  offering false  Ambergreece  to sale and particularly in Lat d where in the Year several of our Men were cheated with it  What Mr  Dampier  saith of the Laziness of the People of  Mindanao p  the very same may be said of the People of  Loango  on the Coast of  Guinea  exactly  Their manner of Worship mentioned  p  is the very same with what I have seen at  Algier  on the Coast of  Barbary  The Nocturnal Dancings used by the  Hottantotts  at the  Cape of good Hope  every Full and New Moon  p  are also practised by the Inhabitants of  Loango Molinbo  and  Cabendo  I shall give you the trouble of a small Relation of a Passage to  Loango  in the Year When we came so far to the  Southward  as d m N Lat and d m Longi  Westward  from the  Meridian  of  Lundi  it being st of  March  we had small Wind at S S W and S W with showers of Rain There we met with prodigious shoals of Fish consisting chiefly of  Albicores  and  Bonetoes  There were also great numbers of Sharks some or foot long For diversion we catch'd above an of them at times The other Fish we took as we had occasion fresh and fresh and one day we caught a Barrel of them with empty Hooks These shoals of Fish kept us Company till we were under the Equator in Long d m Eastward of the  Meridian  of  Lundy  This was  April  we had the Winds at S E and S E by E fresh Gales and clear Weather but a mighty Leeward Current At the Fishes parting with us that day I caught an  Albicore  that weighed  l  It is a mighty strong Fish so that the FishingCraft must be very strong to take them  The  City  of  Loango  I find to lye in Lat d m S and Longi d m Eastward from the  Meridian  of  Lundy  from whence I took my departure bound for  Jamaica Oct    When we find the Winds South S by W and S S W fresh Gales veerable to S W and back to South we  stand off to the Westward with Larboard Tacks on Board till we get d Long to the Westward of  Loango  And there we find the Winds veerable from S S E to S E fresh Gales When we get d to the Westward of  Loango  we are then d Westward from the  Meridian  of  Lundy  and there we find the Winds veerable from S E by E to E by S and East and so they continue blowing fresh as we will still run to the Westward between the Lat of and d South till we make the Island  Fernando de Noronho  which I find to lye in Lat d m s South And by the Experience of two Voyages have found its Longi d m Westward from  Loango  and d m from the  Meridian  of  Lundy  This Island appears with a very high Pyramid And when we come close to it the Pyramid looks like a large Cathedral On the N W side is a small Bay to anchor in But Ships must come pretty near the shore because it is deep Water Here is plenty of Fish And on the Island is some fresh Water and low shrubs of Trees We could see no living Creature on it but Dogs It was formerly inhabited by the  Portuguese  but the  Dutch  having then War with them took it and carried the  Portuguese  all away The Body of the Island I judge to be about Miles long lying N E and S W near on the North side are some Rocks pretty high above Water and many Birds as  Sea Gulls  and  ManofWarBirds  which are something like our  Kites  in  England  I find the Current sets strong to the N W The variation very little From thence I steered N VV with fresh Gales S E and at E S E in order to cross the Equator and designing to make the Island  Tobago  which by my Run from the aforesaid Island I find to lye in Lat d m North Longi VVestward of  Fernando  d m The  Meridian  distance from  Fernando  Miles▪ And by my reckoning or Journal  Tobago  is VVest from the  Meridian  of the Isle of  Lundy  d m  In this Passage between the said Islands we find strange Ripling and Cockling Seas ready to leap in upon the Ships Deck which makes us think the Current to be strong And it seems to be occasioned by the great River on the main Land which is not far from us in this Passage  Tobago  is an high Island with a brave sandy Bay on the S W side where the  Dutch  had formerly a great Fort till molested by the  English  in the last  Dutch  War From this Island I shaped my Course for  Jamaica  and found the N E Corner to lye in Lat d North and in Longi West from  Tobago  d The  Meridian  distance from  Tobago  is Miles West In our passage we saw no Land or Island till we made the N E end of  Jamaica  which lyeth in Longi West from the  Meridian  of  Lundy  d m and VVest from the City of  Loango  d m I shall only add that I am of Opinion that the  Gallopagos  Islands do lye a great deal further to the Westward than our  Hydrographers  do place them

and at a distance from my Journals c  Answers  to the  Queries  The Common  TradeWinds  on the Coast of  Angola  blow from the S W to South till about d Long from the  Meridian  of the Isle of  Lundy  I have found them always in the same Quarter and not subject to shift in all the time I have used this Coast except that at a small distance off the shoar they are sometimes a Poine more to the

time of the  Wet Seasons  The true  SeaBreez  I have commonly found here to be from W S W to W by S if it be fair Weather and the  LandBreez  is at E by N But if a  Tornado  happens it causes the

Tropicks Presages of their coming of Norths the times and Places where they blow Signs of their approach N Banks A Chocolatta North A North beneficial to Ships going from  Campeachy  to  Jamaica  A very uncommon way of wearing a Ship in a North Of Souths the Times and Places where they Blow A Description of a South at  Jamaica  and at the Bay of  Campeachy  Much Fish kill'd by that Storm Of Hurricanes A Description of a terrible one at  Antegoe  where abundance of Fish and Sea Fowls were destroyed by it The difference between North Banks and the Clouds before an Hurricane the latter adorned with radiant Colours Tuffoons in the  EastIndies  the same with Hurricanes in the  West  Of Monsoons in the  EastIndies  A Storm called by the  Portuguese  the  Elephanta  which is the violentest Monsoon of that Season  STorms within the Tropicks are generally known to us by some Name or other to distinguish them from other common Winds and tho' Storms are not so frequent there as they are in Latitudes nearer the Poles yet are they nevertheless expected yearly in their proper Months and when they do come they blow exceeding fierce  though indeed some years they do not come at all or at least do not blow with that fierceness as at other times And as these Winds are commonly very fierce so are they but of a short continuance in comparison with Storms that we meet with in higher Latitudes  In the  WestIndies  there are three sorts  viz Norths Souths  and  Hurricanes  In the  EastIndies  there are only two sorts  viz Monsoones  and  Tuffoones  All these sorts of violent Storms except the  Norths  are expected near one time of the year and this is taken notice of by those that have been in any of them that they give certain Presages of their being at hand several hours before they come Norths are violent Winds that frequently blow in the  Bay  of  Mexico  from  October  till  March  They are chiefly expected near the full or change of the Moon all that time of the year but they are most violent in  December  and  January  These Winds are not confined to the  Bay  of  Mexico  only but there they are most frequent and rage with the greatest Violence They blow on the North side of  Cuba  very fierce too and in the Gulph of  Florida  as also about  Hispaniola Jamaica  c and in the Channel between  Jamaica  and  Portabel  and in all the West Indian Sea between the Islands and the Main as high as the Island  Trinidado  But from  Jamaica  Eastward except on the North side of the Island  Hispaniola  they blow no harder than a pretty brisk Sea Wind They are here at W N W or N W though in the  Bay  of  Mexico  they blow strongest at N N W and this is the Season of Westerly Winds in these East parts of the  WestIndies  as I have before noted in the third Chapter of this Discourse I shall be most particular of them that blow in the  Bay  of  Mexico  and what Signs they give us before hand  Commonly before a North the Weather is very serene and fair the Sky clear and but little Wind and that too veering from its proper Point or the common TradeWind of the Coast and breathing gently at S at S W and West a Day or two before the North comes The Sea also gives notice of a Storm by an extraordinary and long Ebb For a Day or two before a North there will be hardly any discernable Flood but a constant ebbing of the Sea And the SeaFowls also before a Storm do commonly hover over the Land which they do not at other times use to do in such great flights and numbers All these Signs concurring may give any Man notice of an approaching Storm but the greatest and most remarkable Sign of a North is a very black Cloud in the N W rising above the Horizon to about or degrees the upper edge of the Cloud appears very even and smooth and when once the upper part of the Cloud is or degrees high there it remains in that even form parallel to the Horizon without any motion and this sometimes or Days before the Storm comes At other times not above or hours but never less  This Cloud lying so near the Horizon is not seen but in the Mornings or Evenings at least it does not appear so black as then this is called by English Seamen a  North Bank  and when ever we see such a Cloud in that part of the World and in the Months before mentioned we certainly provide for a Storm and tho' sometimes it may happen that such a Cloud may appear several Mornings and Evenings and we may not feel the effects of it or but very little yet we always provide against it for a North never comes without such a foreboding Cloud But if the Winds also whiffle about to the South with fair flattering Weather it never sails While the Wind remains at S S W or any thing to the South of the West it blows very faint but  when once it comes to the North of the West it begins to be brisk and veers about presently to the North West where it blows hard yet does it not stay there long before it veers to the N N W and there it blows strongest and longest Sometimes it continues or even hours and sometimes longer When the Wind first comes to the N W if the black Cloud rises and comes away it may chance to give but one flurry like that of a Tornado and then the Sky grows clear again and either the Wind continues at N W blowing only a brisk Gale which the  Jamaica  Seamen call a  Chocolatt North  or else it veers about again to the East and settles there But if when the Wind comes to the N W the Cloud still remains settled the Wind then continues blowing very fierce even so long as the black Bank continues near the Horizon It is commonly pretty dry and clear but sometimes much Rain falls with a North and tho' the Clouds which bring Rain come from the N W and N N W yet the black Bank near the Horizon seems not to move till the Heart of the Storm is broke When the Wind starts from the N N W to the N 'tis a sign that the Violence of the Storm is past especially if it veers to the East of the North for then it soon flies about to the East and there settles at its usual Point and brings fair Weather But if it goes back from the N to the N W it will last a day or two longer as fierce as before and not without a great deal of Rain  When our  Jamaica  Logwoodships are coming loaden out of the Bay of  Campeachy  in the North Season they are glad to have a North For a good North will bring them almost to  Jamaica  neither have any of our Vessels miscarried in one of these Storms that I did ever hear of though sometimes much shattered but the Spaniards do commonly suffer by them and there is seldom a Year but one  or more of them are cast away in the Bay of  Campeachy  in this Season for they don't work their ships as we do ours They always bring their ships too under a Foresail and Mizan but never under a Mainsail and Mizan nor yet under the Mizan alone but we generally bring too under Mainsail and Mizan and if the Wind grows too fierce we bring her under a Mizan only and if we cannot maintain that then we balast our Mizan which is by riffing and taking up great part of the Sail If after all this the Winds and Seas are two high for us then we put before it but not before we have tryed our utmost especially if we are near a Leeshore On the contrary the  Spaniards  in the  WestIndies  as I said before lye under a Foresail and Mizan But this must needs be an extraordinary strain to a Ship especially if she be long Indeed there is this convenience in it when they are minded to put away before it 'tis but halling up the Mizan and the Foresail veers the Ship presently and I judge it is for that Reason they do it For when the Wind comes on so fierce that they can no longer keep on a Wind they put right afore it and so continue till the Storm ceaseth or the Land takes them up  i e  till they are run ashore I knew two  Spaniards  did so while I was in the Bay One was a Kings ship called the  Piscadore  She run ashore on a Sandy Bay a Mile to the Westward of the River  Tobasco  The other was come within or Leagues of the shore and the Storm ceasing she escaped shipwreck but was taken by Captain  Hewet  Commander of a Privateer who was then in the Bay Her Mainmast and Mizan were cut down in the storm Both these Ships came from  La Vera Cruz  and were in the North side of the Bay when first the storms took them And tho' we don't nse this method yet we find means to wear our ships as well as they for if after the Mizan is hall'd up  and furled if then the ship will not wear we must do it with some Headsail which yet sometimes puts us to our shifts As I was once in a very violent storm sailing from  Virginia  mentioned in my  Voyage round the World  we scudded before the Wind and Sea some time with only our bare Poles and the ship by the mistake of him that con'd broched too and lay in the Trough of the Sea which then went so high that every Wave threatned to overwhelm us And indeed if any one of them had broke in upon our Deck it might have foundred us The Master whose fault this was rav'd like a mad Man and called for an Axe to cut the Mizan Shrouds and turn the Mizan Mast over Board which indeed might have been an Expedient to bring her to her course again Cap  Davis  was then Quartermaster and a more experienced Seamen than the Master He did him hold his hand a little in hopes to bring her some other way to her course The Captain also was of his Mind Now our Mainyard and Foreyard were lowered down a Port last as we call it that is down pretty nigh the Deck and the Wind blew so fierce that we did not dare to loose any Headsail for they must have blown away if we had neither could all the Men in the ship have furled them again therefore we had no hopes of doing it that way I was at this time on the Deck with some others of our Men and among the rest one Mr  John Small  on  who was the main Instrument at that time of saving us all Come said he to me let us g  a little way up the Foreshrouds it may be that may make the Ship wear for I have been doing it before now He never tarried for an Answer but run forward presently and I followed him We went up the Shrouds Halfmast up and there we spread abroad the Flaps of our Coats and presently the Ship wore I think we did not stay there above  Minutes before we gain'd our Point and came dow  again but in this time the Wind was got into our Mainsail and had blown it loose and tho' the Mainyard was down a Portlast and our Men were got on the Yard as many as could lye one by another besides the Deck full of Men and all striving to furl that Sail yet could we not do it but were forced to cut it all along by the Headrope and so let it fall down on the Deck  Having largely treated of Norths I shall next give some account of Souths  South Winds are also very violent Winds I have not heard any thing of these sorts of Storms but at  Jamaica  or by  Jamaica  Sailers The time when they blow at  Jamaica  is about  June July or August  Months that Norths never blow in The greatest stress of Wind in these storms is at South from whence its probable they are named  Souths  In what they differ from the  Hurricanes  that rage among the  Carribee Islands  I know not unless in this that they are more Constant to one Point of the Compass or that they come sooner in the Year than  Hurricanes  do but those Storms call'd  Hurricanes  had never been known at  Jamaica  when I was there Yet since I have heard that they have felt the fury of them several times But I was at  Jamaica  when there happened a violent South It made great havock in the Woods and blew down many great Trees but there was no great damage done by it  Port Royal  was in great danger then of being washed away for the Sea made a breach clear through the Town and if the violence of Weather had continued but a few hours longer many of the Houses had been washed away For the Point of Land on which that Town stands is Sand which began to wash away apace but the Storm cealing there was no further damage This was in  July  or  August  in the Year  I was afterwards in the Bay of  Campeachy  when we had a much more violent Storm than this called also by the LogwoodCutters a  South  It happened some time in  June    I was then cutting Logwood in the Western Creek of the West Lagune Two days before this storm began the Wind whiffled about to the South and back again to the East and blew very faintly The Weather also was very fair and the Menof WarBirds came hovering over the Land in great numbers which is very unusal for them to do This made some of our LogwoodCutters say that we should have some Ships come hither in a short time for they believed it was a certain token of the arrival of Ships when these Birds came thus hovering over the Land And some of them said they had lived at  Barbadoes  where it was generally taken notice of and that as many of these Birds as they saw hovering over the Town so many Ships there were coming thither And according to that Rule they foolishly guest that here were a great many Ships coming hither at that time Tho' 'tis impossible that they could imagine there could be the hundredth part of the Ships arrive that they saw Birds fly over their Heads But that which I did most admire was to see the Water keep ebbing for two Days together without any flood till the Creek where we lived was almost dry There was commonly at low Water or foot Water but now not above even in the middle of the Creek  About a Clock the d day after this unusual Ebb the Sky looked very black and the Wind sprung up fresh at S E and increasing In less than two hours time it blew down all our Huts but one and that with much labour we propt up with Posts and with Ropes cast over the Ridge and fastning both ends to stupms of Trees we secured the Roof from flying away In it we huddled altogether till the storm ceased It  rained very hard the greatest part of the storm and about two hours after the Wind first sprang up the Waters flowed very fast in The next Morning it was as high as the Banks of the Creek which was higher than I had ever seen it before  The Flood still increased and run faster up the Creek than ever I saw it do in the greatest SpringTide which was somewhat strange because the Wind was at South which is right off the shore on this Coast Neither did the Rain any thing a bate and by a Clock in the Morning the Banks of the Creek were all overflown About at Noon we brought our Canoa to the side of our Hut and fastned it to the stump of a Tree that stood by it that being the only refuge that we could now expect for the Land a little way within the Banks of the Creek is much lower than where we were So that there was no walking through the Woods because of the Water Besides the Trees were torn up by the Roots and tumbled down so strangely across each other that it was almost impossible to pass through them  The storm continued all this Day and the Night following till a Clock then it began to abate and by two in the Morning it was quite calm  This storm made very strange work in the Woods by tearing up the Trees by the Roots The Ships also riding at  Trisl  and at  OneBushKey  felt the fury of it to their sorrow for of four that were riding at  OneBushKey  three were driven away from their Anchors one of which was blown into the Woods of  BeefIsland  And of the four Ships that were at  Trist  three also were driven from their Anchors one of which was cast up about Paces beyond high Water Mark on the  Island  of  Trist  The other two were driven off to Sea and one of them was never heard of since  The poor Fish also suffered extreamly by thi storm for we saw multitudes of them either cas on the shore or floating dead on the Lagunes Ye this storm did not reach Leagues to Windwar  of  Trist  for Captain  Vally  of  Jamaica  went henc  but days before the storm began and was no  past Leagues off when we had it so fierce ye  he felt none of it But only saw very black dismal Clouds to the Westward as he reported at his return from  Jamaica  to  Trist  Months after  I shall speak next of  Hurricanes  These are violent storms raging chiefly among the  Carribee Islands  though by Relation  Jamaica  has of late been much annoyed by them but it has been since the time of my being there They are expected in  July August  or  September  These storms also as well as the Norths or Souths give some signs of their approach before they come on I have not been in any one of them my self but have made enquiry of many Men that have and they all agree that either they are preceded by flattering unusual small Winds and very fair Weather or by a great glut of Rain or else by both Rains and Calms together  I shall give an Instance of one that gave such warning It happened at  Antego  in  August  I had the Relation of it from Mr  John Smallbone  before mentioned who was Gunner of a Ship of Tuns and Guns Commanded by Capt  Gadbury  Before this storm it rained two days excessively then it held up two or three days more but the Sky was clouded and appear'd to be much troubled yet but little Wind The Planters by this were certain of a Hurricane and warned the ShipCommanders to provide for it especially Capt  Gadbury  who had careen'd his Ship in  Muskito Cove  in  St John's Harbour  but a little before and by this warning given him by the Planters had gotten his Goods on  Board again which though all he had yet was but about half his lading of Sugar Molosses and Rum He also moored his Ship as secure as he could with all his Cablesand Anchors besides some Cables which he had made fast ashore to great Trees And about a Clock that evening that the storm came he dreading it went ashore with all his Men and retired into a poor Planters House about half a Mile from the shore By that time he and his Men were arrived at the House which was before a Clock the Wind came on very fierce at N E and veering about to the N and N W settled there bringing with it very violent Rains Thus it continued about four hours and then fell flat calm and the Rain ceased  In this Calm he sent or of his Men down to the  Cove  to see what condition the Ship was in and they found her driven ashore dry on the Sand lying on one side with the Head of her Mast sticking into the Sand after they had walked round her and view'd her a while they return'd again to the Capt to give him an Account of the Disaster and made as much haste as they could because the Wind began to blow hard at S W and it blew so violently before they recover'd the House that the Boughs of the Trees whipt them sufficiently before they got thither and it rained as hard as before The little House could scarce shelter them from the wet for there was little beside the Walls standing For the st Northerly Gust blew away great part of the Ridg and most of the Thatch Yet there they stayed till the next Morning and then coming to the Ship found her almost upright but all the Goods that were in the Hold were wash'd out and the Sugar was wash'd out of the Cask Some of the Rum they found a Cask in one place and a Cask in another some on the shore and some half a Mile in the Woods and some stav'd against the Trees and leek'd out for it seems there had been a violent Motion in the Sea as well  as in the Air For in the beginning of the Night when the N E Gust raged the Sea ebb'd so prodigiously or else was driven off the shore by the violence of the Wind so far that some Ships riding in the Harbour in or fathom Water were a ground and lay so till the S W Gust came and then the Sea came rowling in again with such prodigious fury that it not only set them afloat but dash'd many of them on the shore One of them was carried up a great way into the Woods another was strangely hurl'd on two Rocks that stood close by one another with her Head resting on one Rock and her Stern on the other And thus she lay like a Bridge between the two Rocks about or Foot above the Sea even in the highest Tides for the Tides do usually rise here but little not above or Foot but in these Hurricanes it always ebbs and flows again prodigiously  It was not the Ships only that felt the fury of this Storm but the whole Island suffered by it for the Houses were blown down the Trees tore up by the Roots or had their Heads and Limbs sadly shattered neither was there any Leaves Herbs or green Thing left on the Island but all look'd like Winter Insomuch that a Ship coming thither a little after that used that Trade could scarce believe it to be the same Island Neither did the fury of this Storm light only here for  Nevis  and St  Christophers  had their shares also but  Mountsurat  felt little of it tho' not above a Fortnight after there happened another Storm as violent as this and raged extreamly there but did little damage at  Nevis  and St  Christophers Antego  had a great share of this too Capt  Gadbury  's Ship that lay aground before it came was by it hurled over to the opposite part of the Harbour and there thrown dry on the Sand  The day after the storm the shore was strew'd with Fish of divers sorts as well great as small  such as Porpoises Sharks c and abundance of Sea Fowls also were destroyed by it  I would not have any Man think that these Hurricanes or any other Storms do always give warning of their coming exactly alike For there may be some difference in those signs tho' all of them be plain enough if well observed Besides sometimes they are duplicated sometimes only single signs and sometimes the signs may be more visible and plain than at other times when by some accidental cause those signs may be less visible by Reason of some high Hill or Mountain that may be interpos'd between you and the Horizon especially if any Hill lies N E from you which is the Quarter that Hurricanes do commonly rise in  The Clouds that precede a Hurricane are different from the North Banks in this that whereas the Clouds preceding Norths are uniform and regular of an exact blackness even from the Horizon to the upper edg of it and that as streight and even as a Line stretched out On the contrary the HurricaneClouds tower up their Heads pressing forwards as if they all strove for precedency yet so linked one within another that all move alike Besides the edges of these Clouds are guilded with various and afrighting Colours the very edg of all seems to be of a pale fire colour next that of a dull yellow and nearer the Body of the Cloud of a Copper Colour and the Body of the Cloud which is very thick appears extraordinary Black and altogether it looks very terrible and amazing even beyond expression Tho' I have never been in any Hurricane in the  West Indies  yet I have seen the very Image of them in the  East Indies  and the effects have been the very same and for my part I know no difference between a Hurricane among the Carribee Islands in the  West Indies  and a Tuffoon on the Coast of  China  in the  East Indies  but only the Name▪ And I am apt to believe that both Words have one signification which is a  violent Storm  I have given a large Account of one of these in my  Voyage round the World  Chapter XV Page That gave warning by flattering Weather before hand and a very dismal Cloud set out with such colours as I have before described rising in the N E from whence the violence of the first Gust came which was wonderful fierce and accompanied with extraordinary hard Rain then it afterwards fell calm about an hour and then the Wind came about at S W and blew as fierce as it did before at N E which is much like the Hurricane beforementioned at  Antego  but of a longer continuance than that Besides in both places they blow at one time of the Year which is in  July August  or  September  and commonly near the Full or Change of the Moon  Another thing that we must also take notice of is that both Places are North of the Equator though not exactly in one Latitude  But of these Tuffoons I shall say no more now having described them particularly in my Voyage to  Tonquin  Chap II Pag  The Monsoons in the  East Indies  are the next to be treated of by which I do not mean the Coasting Tradewind so called which I have already described in Page of this Discourse for tho'  Monsoon  is a general word for the Wind there distinguished by East or West according to the Points from whence they blow yet it sometimes also signifies a  Storm  as I now take it And it is easie to be understood when it is used in reference to the Tradewind or when spoken of a Storm for if applied to a Storm 'tis express'd by some  pethite going before As Violent Terrible  c without any distinction of East or West which is commonly used in speaking of the TradeWind  These Monsoons or Storms on the Coast of  Coromandel  are expected either about  April  or  September  which are accounted the two shifting Months For in these two Months the Winds begin to shift and turn from that Point on which they have blown several Months before to the contrary Points of the Compass as from East to West or the contrary but commonly this shift is attended with a turbulent Sky which ends in a violent storm of Wind or excessive Rains or both And this is called also the breaking up of the Monsoon It was in one of these that I past from  Nicobar  Island to  Sumatra  mentioned in my  Voyage round the World  Chap XVIII Page This was the  April  Monsoon  The  Septemb  Monsoons are generally more violent than these last yet by the Account I have lately had from  Fort  St  George  they have suffered very much by one of the  April  Monsoons if it may be so called for it came before its usual time even before it could be expected  As for the  September  Monsoons tho' the time of the Year is so well known and the warnings of their approach almost certain yet our  East India  Merchants have had very considerable losses there for the stress of the Winds blows right in upon the shore and often hurries the Ships from their Anchors and tosses them in a moment on the sandy Bay  Indeed the want of a secure Place to Ride in is the greatest Inconvenience of that Factory a Place doubtless designed by the English from its Original to be the Center of the Trade of these Parts For all our Factories and the Trade in general East from Cape  Comorin  are now subordinate to this  The  Dutch  had once a place of Consequence called  Pallacat  on this Coast about Leagues to the North of it but they withdrew most of their Families and Effects from thence in the Year mentioned in my  Voyage round the World  Chap XX Page And it is very probable that these raging Winds might be one cause of this their deserting it whatever was the Motive of settling here for they have secure Harbours and Roads enough in  India  which we to our great disadvantage very much want  But to return to the Monsoons  These as I have told you blow fiercest in  September  and as I have been informed blow on several Points of the Compass  The stormy Monsoons on the  Mallabar  Coast differ from these on the Coast of  Coromandel  in that they are more common and last even from  April  to  September  which is as long as the common West Monsoon lasts though not so frequent and lasting in the beginning of the Monsoon as towards the latter end  The Months of  July  and  August  afford very bad Weather for then there is hardly any intermission but a continued troubled Sky full of black Clouds which pour down excessive Rains and often very fierce Winds But towards the breaking up of the Monsoon they have one very terrible Storm called by the  Portuguese  the  Eliphanta  which concludes the bad Weather For after that they put to Sea without fear of any more Storms that Season  These violent Winds blow directly in upon the shore and they dam up the Harbours on this Coast especially that of  Goa  so that no Ships can go in or come out then but after the violent Winds are past the Channel opens again and so continues till the next Season  This Relation I had from a very ingenious Gentleman who was at  Goa  during the bad Weather  I shall only take notice that these Storms are also at the same time of the Year when the Hurricanes and Souths are in the West  Indies  and the Tuffoons on the Coasts of  China Tunqueen Cochinchina  and  Cambodia  in the Eastern Parts of the  East Indies  and that all these Places are to the North of the Equator  CHAP VII Of the Seasons of the Year  The Wet and Dry Seasons on the North side of the Equator and on the South of it Places famous for much dry Weather as part of  Peru  and  Africa  A Comparison between those Coasts Of raining Coasts as  Guinea  Why  Guinea  more subject to Rains than the opposite Coast of  Brazil  The time of Sugarmaking Of the Seasons at  Suranam  Bays more subject to Rain than HeadLands Several instances of this as at  Campeachy Panama Tunqueen Bengala  c Mountains more subject to Rains than Low Land An instance of this at  Jamaica  The Isle of  Pines  near  Cuba  a wet Place So is also  Gorgonia  in the South Seas The manner how Tornadoes arise  AS Summer and Winter are the two most different Seasons in our Climate so the Dry and the Wet are within the torrid Zone and are always opposite to each other They are often called by Europeans  Winter  and  Summer  but more generally  Dry  and  Wet  The Seasons on each side of the Equator are as different as the Seasons of Summer and Winter are in temperate Climates or near each Pole For as 'tis Summer near the North Pole when 'tis Winter near the South Pole and the contrary so when 'tis fair and  dry Weather North of the Equator 'tis blustering and rainy Weather South of it and the contrary except within a few degrees of the Line and that in some places only  There is also this difference between the Torrid and Temperate Zones either North or South of the Equator that when it is fair and dry Weather in the one it is Winter in the other and when it is wet in the one it is Summer in the other I speak now of Places lying on the same side of the Equator For as the Sun when it passes the Equinox and draws towards either of the Tropicks begins to warm their respective Poles and by how much the nearer he approaches by so much is the Air without the Tropicks clear dry and hot On the contrary within the Torrid Zone though on the same side of the Line the farther the Sun is off the drier is the Weather And as the Sun comes nearer the sky grows more cloudy and the Weather more moist for the Rains follow the Sun and begin on either side of the Equator within a little while after the Sun has crost the Equinox and so continue till after his return back again  The wet Season on the North side of the Equator in the torrid Zone begins in  April  or  May  and so continues till  September  or  October  The dry Weather comes in  November  or  December  and continues till  April  or  May  In South Latitudes the Weather changes at the same times but with this difference that the dry Months in South Latitude are wet Months in North Latitude and the contrary as I have said before Yet neither do the wet or dry Seasons set in or go out exactly at one time in all Years neither are all places subject to wet or dry Weather alike For in some places it rains less than in others and consequently there is more dry Weather But generally  Places that lye under the Line or near it have their greatest Rains in  March  and  September  HeadLands or Coasts that lye most exposed to the Tradewinds have commonly the best share of dry Weather On the contrary deep Bays or bendings of the Land especially such as lye near the Line are most subject to Rains Yet even among Bays or Bendings there is a great deal of difference in the Weather as to dry or wet for the Weather as well as the Winds seem to be much influenced by accidental Causes and those Causes themselves whatever they are seem to be subject to great variation  But to proceed with Matter of Fact I shall begin with the driest Coasts and first with that of  Peru  from d South d South There it never Rains neither at Sea for a good distance off shore as for or Leagues no nor on the shore for a considerable way within Land though exactly how far I know not yet there are small Mists sometimes in a Morning for two or three Hours but seldom continuing after a Clock and there are Dews also in the Night  This Coast lies N and S it has the Sea open to the West and a chain of very high Mountains running a long shore on the East and the Winds constantly Southerly as I said before in the second Chapter of Winds  In which Head I have made a Comparison as well of the Winds on the Coast of  Africa  in the same Latitude as of the lying of the Coasts Only there is this difference that the coasting Tradewinds on the American side do blow further from the Land than those on the African side Which difference may probably arise from the disporportion of the Mountains that are in the two Continents for 'tis known that the  Andes  in  America  are some of the highest Mountains in the World but whether there  are any on the Continent of  Africa  in those Latitudes so high I know not I have not heard of any at least none such are visible to Seamen  I come now to speak of the Weather on the African Coast which though 'tis not so dry as the Coast of  Peru  yet is it the next to it The Weather there is very dry from  March  till  October  which is the dry Season  The rainy Season which is from  October  till  March  is moderate without that excess that is in most other Places in those Latitudes so that the wettest Season can only be called so from some gentle showers of Rain  There are some Tornadoes but not so many as are in any other Places both of the  East  or  West Indies  the  Peruvian Coast  excepted And if the height of the  Andes  are the cause that the true East Breez does not take place in the Pacifick Sea within Leagues distance from the shore when yet the Trade blows within Leagues of the African Coast that Coast may perhaps be supposed to want such high Mountains And if those American Mountains do stop the Winds from their Career why may they not as well break the Clouds before they reach near the shore and be the cause of the dry Weather there And seeing both Coasts do lye alike and the Wind is alike why should not the Weather be the same were it not for the disproportion between the Mountains of these Coasts For the East side of those Mountains are supplied with Rain enough as may be known by the great Rivers that disembogue from thence into the Atlantick Sea whereas the Rivers on the South Sea Coast are but very few and small some of which do wholly dry away for a good part of the Year but yet they constantly break out again in their Seasons when the Rains in the Country do come which always fall on  the West side of those Mountains and this is about  February  As I have spoken before of dry Coasts so now I shall speak of rainy ones I shall begin with the Coast of  Guinea  from Cape  Lopos  which lies one degree South taking in the Bite or Bending of the Land and all the Coast West from thence as far as Cape  Palmas  This is a very wet Coast subject to violent Tornadoes and excessive Rains especially in  July  and  August  In those Months there is scarce any fair Day This Coast lies all of it very near the Equator and no where above or degrees distance so that from its nearness to the Equator only we might probably conjecture that it is a rainy Coast for most places lying near the Line are very subject to Rains yet some more than others and  Guinea  may be reckoned among the wettest Places in the World There may be Places where the Rains continue longer but none are more violent while they last  And as its nearness to the Line may be a great cause of its moisture so by its situation also one would guess that it should be subject to a great deal of Rain because there is a great Bite or Bending in of the Land a little to the North of the Line and from thence the Land stretcheth West parallel with the Line And the  e Circumstances singly taken according to my observations do seldom fail but more especially where they both meet Yet there may be other causes that may hinder those Effects or at least serve to allay the violence of them as they do on some other Coasts I shall only instance in the opposite Coast of  America  between the North Cape which lies North of the Equator and Cape  Blanco  on  Brazil  in South Latitude Now this Land lies much after the Form of the Coast of  Guinea  with this difference that one Coast lies in  South Lat the other lies North of the Equator both of these Promontories lay parallel with the Equator and there's not much difference in their distance from it but that which makes the difference is that one juts out Westward the other Eastward and so one is the very Westermost Land of the Continent of  Africa  the other is the Eastermost Land of the Continent of  America  The one has only an eddy Wind which seems to me to be the Effect of two contrary Winds The other Coast lies open to the Trade and never wants a Breez And the former is troubled with Tornadoes and violent Rains during the wet Season which is  May June July August  and  September  But the extreamest wet Months are  July  and  August  when it Rains in a manner continually  April  and  October  also sometimes are wet Months  The other Coast on the  American  Continent which lies open to the E and N E or S E and which enjoys the freer TradeWind is less subject to Rain only as it lies near the Line it has its part but not to excess nor in any comparison with  Guinea  And as the Line is to the N of it so its wet Months are from  October  till  April  and the dry Season from  April  to  October  And these Seasons reach even to or degrees North of the Line Which I do not know to be so in any other part of the World again Indeed Cape  Lopes  in  Guinea  is in one degree South yet participates of the same Weather that the rest of  Guinea  has which lies to the North of the Line  Now the reason why  Europeans  do account the dry Season Summer and the wet Season Winter is because the dry Season is their Harvest time especially in our Plantations where we chiefly make Sugar for then the Canes are as yellow as Gold They have then indeed less juice but that little there is is very sweet Whereas in the wet Season tho'  the Canes are ripe and come to their Maturity yet do they not yield such quantities of Sugar neither is it so good tho' the pains in boiling it be also greater Therefore in Northern Climates as all our Plantations are in they commonly begin to work about making of Sugar at  Christmas  after the dry Season has brought the Canes to a good perfection But in South Climates as on the Coast of  Brazil  they begin to work in  July  Some Places there are in the North Latitudes also near the Line where the Weather bears time with the Seasons in South Lat as at  Suranam  which tho' it is in North Lat yet are the Seasons there the same as in South Latitudes but I know not such another instance any where And tho' the dry Season is the time to gather in the Canes and the wet Season to plant yet are they not so limited as to make use only of these Seasons for either but do it chiefly for their best convenience for they may plant at any time of the Year and that with good success especially after a moderate shower of Rain which often happens even in the dry Seasons  But I must proceed  I have said before that Bays have greater quantities of Rain than HeadLands  The Bay of  Campeachy  is a good Instance of this for the Rains are very great there especially in the Months of  July  and  August  On the contrary the Coast from Cape  Catoch  to Cape  Cond  cedo  which lies more exposed to the Trade has not near the Rains as the Bay of  Campeachy  hath  The Bay of  Honduras  also is very wet and all that bending Coast from Cape  Gratia de Dios  even to  Carthagena  But on the Coast of  Caraccos  and about Cape  La Vela  where the Breezes are more brisk the Weather is more moderate Whereas in those little Bays between there is still a difference For in the Bay of  Mericaya  which lies a little to  the East of Cape  La Vela  there is much more Rain than at or near the Cape  The Bay of  Panama  also will furnish us with a proof of this by its Immoderate Rains especially the South side of it even from the Gulph of St  Michael  to Cape St  Francis  the Rains there are from  April  till  November  but in  June July  and  August  they are most violent  There are many small Bays also West from the Bay of  Panama  which have their shares of these wet Seasons as the Gulph of  Dulce Caldera  Bay  Amapala  c but to the West of that where the Coast runs more plain and even there are not such wet Seasons yet many times very violent Tornadoes  The  EastIndies  also has many Bays that are subject to very violent Rains as the Bay of  Tonqueen  that of  Siam  the bottom and the East side of the Bay of  Bengall  But on the Coast of  Coromandel  which is the Westside of that Bay the Weather is more moderate that being an even plain low Coast But on the Coast of  Mallabar  which is on the West side of that Promontory the Land is high and mountainous and there are violent Rains Indeed the West sides of any Continents are wetter than the East sides the Coast of  Peru  and  Africa  only excepted in the former of which the driness may be occasioned as is said before by the height of the  Andes  And 'tis probable that the violence of the Rains near those Mountains falls chiefly on the Eastsides of them and seldom reaches to their Tops which yet if the Rains do they may there be broke in pieces and reach no further For among other Observations I have taken notice that Mountains are supplied with more Rains than low Lands I mean the low Land bordering on the Sea As for instance the South side of  Jamaica  beginning at  Leganea  and from thence away to the Westward as far as Black River including all the plain Land and Savannahs  about St  Jago de la Vego Old Harbour  and  Withywood  Savannahs This is a plain level Country for many Miles lying near East and West having the Sea on the South and bounded with Mountains on the North  Those Mountains are commonly supplied with Rain before the low Lands I have known the Rains to have begun there three Weeks before any has fallen in the plain Country bordering on the Sea yet every Day I have observed very black Clouds over the Mountains and have heard it Thunder there And those very Clouds have seemed by their Motion to draw towards the Sea but have been check'd in their Course and have either returned towards the Mountains again or else have spent themselves before they came from thence and so have vanished away again to the great Grief of the Planters whose Plantations and Cattle have suffered for want of a little Moisture Nay these Tornadoes have been so nigh that the Sea Breeze has dyed away and we have had the Wind fresh out of the Clouds yet they have vanished and yielded no Rain to the low parch'd Lands  And I think that the want of seasonable Showers is one of the greatest Inconveniencies that this part of the Country suffers for I have known in some very dry Years that the Grass in the Savannahs has been burned and wither'd for want of Rain and the Cattle have perished thereby for want of Food The Plantations also have suffered very much by it but such dry Seasons have not been known on the Northside of the Island where the Mountains are bordering on the Sea or at least but a little distance off it For there they are supplied with seasonable Showers almost all the Year and even in the dry time it self near the Full and Change of the Moon But in the wet Season the Rains are more violent which is their Inconvenience  As for the Valleys in the Country they are not subject to such Droughts as the plain Land by the Sea at least I have not observed it my self nor have I heard it mentioned by others  The Isle of  Pines  near  Cuba  is so noted a Place for Rain that the  Spaniards  inhabiting near it on  Cuba  say that it Rains more or less every Day in the Year at one Place or another It is generally spoken also and believ'd by Privateers for it has been oft visited by them I have been there my self but cannot confirm that Report However it is well known to be a very wet and rainy Place  It is but a small Island of about or Leagues long and or broad and in the midst is a high picked Mountain which is commonly clouded and the Privateers say that this Hill draws all the Clouds to it for if there is not another Cloud to be seen any where else yet this Hill is seldom or never clear  Gorgonia  in the South Seas also has the same Report It is much smaller than  Pines  I have mentioned it in my  Voyage round the World  Chap VII Page  This Isle lies about Leagues from the Main but the Isle of  Pines  not above and is a great deal bigger than it The Main against  Gorgonia  is very low Land but  Cuba  near  Pines  is pretty high and the Mountain of  Pines  is much bigger and higher than the Hill of  Gorgonia  which yet is of a good height so that it may be seen or Leagues off and tho' I cannot say that it Rains every Day there yet I know that it Rains very much and extraordinary hard  I have been at this Isle three times and always  ound it very rainy and the Rains very violent I remember when we touch'd there in our return from Capt  Sharp  we boiled a Kettle of Chocolate before we clean'd our Bark and having every Man  his Callabash full we began to sup it off standing all the time in the Rain but I am confident not a Man among us all did clear his Dish for it rained so fast and such great drops into our Callabashes that after we had sup'd off as much Chocolate and Rainwater together as sufficed us our Callabashes were still above half full and I heard some of the Menswear that they could not sup it up so fast as it rained in At last I grew tir'd with what I had left and threw it away and most of the rest did so likewise  As Clouds do usually hover over Hills and Mountains so do they also keep near the Land I have mentioned something of this in my  Voyage round the World  Chap X Page where I have said that in making Land we commonly find it Cloudy over the Land tho' 'tis clear every where beside And this may still confirm what I have said in the foregoing Discourse that Hills are commonly clouded for high Land is the first discerned by us and that as I said before is commonly clouded But now I shall speak how we find the Clouds when we are but a little way from Land either coasting along the shore or at an Anchor by it I hope the Reader will not imagine that I am going to prove that it never Rains at Sea or but very little there for the contrary is known to every Body and I have already said in this Discourse of Winds in my first Chapter That there are very frequent Tornadoes in several Seas especially near the Equator and more particularly in the  Atlantick  Sea Other Seas are not so much troubled with them neither is the  Atlantick  so to the North or South of the Line especially at any considerable distance from the shore but yet 'tis very probable however that the Sea has not so great a portion of Tornadoes as the Land hath For when we are near the shore within the Torrid Zone we often sec it Rain on the Land and perceive it to be  very cloudy there when it is fair at Sea and scarce a Cloud to be seen that way And tho' we have the Wind from the Shore and the Clouds seeming to be drawing off yet they often wheel about again to the Land as if they were Magnetically drawn that way Sometimes indeed they do come off a little but then they usually either return again or else insensibly vanish and that's the Reason that Seamen when they are sailing near the Shore and see a Tornado coming off they don't much mind it but cry  The Land will devour it  But however sometimes they fly off to Sea and 'tis very rare that Tornadoes arise from thence for they generally rise first over the Land and that in a very strange manner for even from a very small Cloud arising over the top of a Hill I have often seen it increase to such a bulk that I have known it Rain for or Days successively This I have observed both in the  East  and  WestIndies  and in the  South  and  North Seas  And 'tis impossible for me to forget how oft I have been disturbed by such small Clouds that appeared in the Night 'Tis usual with Seamen in those parts to sleep on the Deck especially for Privateers among whom I made these Observations In Privateers especially when we are at an Anchor the Deck is spread with Mats to lie on each Night Every Man has one some two and this with a Pillow for the Head and a Rug for a Covering is all the Bedding that is necessary for Men of that Employ  I have many times spread my Lodging when the Evening has promised well yet have been forced to withdraw before Day and yet it was not a little Rain that would afright me then neither at its first coming could I have thought that such a small Cloud could afford so much Rain And oftentimes both my self and others have been so deceived by the appearance of so small a Cloud that thinking the  Rain would soon be over we have lain till we were dropping wet and then have been forced to move at last But to proceed  I have constantly observed that in the wet Season we have had more Rain in the Night than in the Day for tho' it was fair in the Day yet we seldom escaped having a Tornado or two in the Night If we had one in the Day it rose and came away presently and it may be we had an Hour's Rain more or less but when it came in the Night tho' there was little appearance of Rain yet we should have it or hours together but this has commonly been nigh the Shore and we have seen thick Clouds over the Land and much Thunder and Lightning and to our appearance there was more Rain there than we had and probably out farther off at Sea there might be still less for it was commonly pretty clear that way  CHAP VIII Of Tides and Currents  The difference between Tides and Currents No place in the Ocean without Tides Where the Tides are greatest and where smallest Of the Tides in the Harbour and Lagunes of  Trist  in the Bay of  Campeachy  Of those between the Capes of  Virginia  The Tides in the Gulph of St  Michael  and the River of  Guiaquil  in the South Sea A mistaken Opinion of a Subterranean Communication between the North and South Seas under the Isthmus of  Darien  Of the Tides at the  Gallapagos  Islands at  Guam  one of the  Ladrones  about  Panama  In the Gulph of  Dulce  and  Necoya  River on the Coast of  Peru  in the  WestIndies  and at  Tonqueen  where and at  NewHolland  they are very irregular A guess at the Reason of so great an irregularity Of the Tides between the  Cape of Good Hope  and the  Red Sea  Of Currents They are influenced by the TradeWind Instances of them at  Berbadoes  c at  Cape la Vela  and  Gratia de Dios Cape Roman  Isle  Trinidado Surinam Cape Blanco  between  Africa  and  Brazil  Of  CounterCurrents  Of Currents in the Bay of  Campeachy  and of  Mexico  in the Gulph of  Florida  Of the  Cacuses  No strange thing  for the surface of the Water to run Counter to its lower Parts Of the Currents on the Coa  of  Angola  Eastward of the  Cape of Good Hope  On the Coast of  India  North of the Line And in the  South Sea  HAving treated of the  Winds  and  Seasons  of  the Year  in the Torrid Zone I now come to speak of the  Tides  and  Currents  there  And by the way Note That  By  Tides  I mean Flowings and Ebbings of the Sea on or off from any Coast Which property of the Sea seems to be Universal though not regularly alike on all Coasts neither as to Time nor the height of the Water  By  Currents  I mean another Motion of the Sea which is different from Tides in several Respects both as to its Duration and also as to its Course  Tides may be compar'd to the  Sea  and  LandBreezes  in respect to their keeping near the shoar tho' indeed they alternately flow and ebb twice in hours Contrarily the Sea Breezes blow on the shoar by Day and the Land Winds off from it in the Night yet they keep this Course as duly in a manner as the Tides do Neither are the Tides nor those Breezes far from the Land  Currents may be compar'd to the  Coasting TradeWinds  as keeping at some farther distance from the shoar as the Tradewinds do and 'tis probable they are much influenced by them  'Tis a general belief especially among Seamen That the Tides are governed by the Moon That their Increase and Decrease as well as their Diurnal Motions are influenced by that Planet tho' sometimes accidental Causes in the Winds may hinder the true regularity thereof  We are taught as the first Rudiments of Navigation to shift our Tides  i e  to know the Time of full Sea in any Place which indeed is very necessary to be known by all English Sailors because the Tides are more regular in our Channel than in other parts of the World  But my subject being to speak of the Tides within or near the Tropick I leave those in places nearer  England  to be discoursed on by Coasters who are the only knowing Men in this Mystery They having by Experience gained more knowledge in it than others and that is always the best Master  I have not been on any Coast in the World but where the Tides have ebb'd and flow'd either more or less and this I have commonly observ'd that the greatest Indraughts of Rivers or Lagunes have commonly the strongest Tides Contrarily such Coasts as are least supplied with Rivers or Lakes have the weakest Tides at least they are not so perceptible Where there are great Indraughts either of Rivers or Lagunes and those Rivers or Lagunes are wide tho' the Tide runs very strong into the Mouths of such Rivers or Lagunes yet it does not flow so high as in such Places where the Rivers or Lakes are bounded in a narrow Room tho' the Tides do run of an equal strength at the Mouths o  Entrances of either Neither do the Tides flow so much on or about Islands remote from the main Land as they do on the Coasts of it  I shall first give some Instances of these general Observations and then proceed to Particulars  The Places that I shall mention shall be such as I have been in my self and where I have made the Observations before mentioned I shall begin with the Lagune of  Triest  in the Bay of  Campeachy  This Place is very remarkable in that it has two Mouths of a considerable bigness the one is about a Mile and half wide and about two Mile thro'  before you come to a Lagune which is seven o  eight Leagues long and three wide The othe  Mouth is Leagues from it and is about Mile and half or Miles wide and about Miles long before it opens into the Lagune Besides farthe  within Land there are or more Lagunes les  than the former  The Tides that flow or ebb in all the Lagunes pass in or out at the two Mouths beforementioned which makes them run very swift insomuch that the  Spaniards  have named that Great Lagune  Laguna Termina  or the Lake of Tides because the Tides are so very strong in those two Mouths Yet tho' the Tides do run so swift at the Mouth of the Lagune they do not rise in height proportionable to that swiftness for the greatest Tides here do not rise or fall above or Foot except forced by extraordinary Causes as Storms or the like Of which I have spoken before  I could also instance in the Channel between the Capes of  Virginia  where the Tides do run very swift yet the Floods and Ebbs are not proportionable to the swiftness of the Tides between the Capes There are not indeed such Lagunes as at  Triest  in the Bay of  Campeachy  but there are many wide Rivers and abundance of smaller Creeks Besides in some places there is low Land which is overflown by the Tides so that all the Water that runs in with such swiftness within the Capes is insensibly swallowed up there  These are instances of strong Tides occasioned by great Indraughts yet where there is but little Rising and Falling of the Water in comparison with the strength of the Tides at the Mouths of those Indraughts  shall next give some Instances of the great Indraughts where the Tides flow and ebb much more than in the former Places tho' the Tide at the Mouths of those Indraughts does not run swi  e  than in those Places beforementioned  I shall only mention two Rivers in the South Sea that I have taken Notice of in my  Voyage round the World viz  the Gulph of  St Michael  and the River of  Guiaquill  In the Gulph of  St Michael  there are many large Rivers which all disembogue into a Lagune of or Leagues wide This Lagune is barricadoed from the Sea with some small low Mangrovy Islands and between them are Creeks and Channels through which the Tides make their daily passes into the Lagune and from thence into the Rivers and so back again many times overflowing the said Islands and leaving the tops of the lower Trees above Water  The Rivers that run into this Lagune are pretty narrow and bounded on each side with steep Banks as high as the Floods use to rise and but very little higher For at Highwater and on a Springtide the Water is almost or altogether even with the Land  The Lagune at the Mouth of the Rivers is but small neither is there any other way for the Water to force it self into beside the Lagune and Rivers and therefore the Tides do rise and fall here or Foot  The River of  Guiaquil  in this respect is much the same with the Gulph of  St Michael  but the Lagunes near it are larger Here the Tides rises and fall Foot perpendicular  I don't know of any other such Places in all the South Seas yet there are other large Rivers on the Coast between these Places but none so remarkable for high Tides The great Tides in the Gulph of  St Michael  have doubtless been the occasion of that Opinion which some hold that there's a subterranean Communication between the North and the South Seas and that the Isthmus of  Darien  is like an Arched Bridge under which the Tides make their constant Courses as duly as they do under  LondonBridge  And more to confirm this Opinion some have said that there are continual and strange Noises made by those Subterranean Fluxes and Refluxes and that they are heard by the Inhabitants of the Isthmus and also that Ships sailing in the Bay of  Panama  are toss'd to and fro at a prodigious rate Sometimes say they they are by the boiling of the Water dash'd against Islands and in a moment left dry there or staved in pieces at other times they are drawn or suck'd up as 'twere in a Whirlpool and ready to be carried under Ground into the North Seas with all Sails standing They have said also that when the Tide flows especially on a Spring the Islands in the Bay are all overflown nay and even the Country for a great way together and then nothing is to be seen but the tops of Trees But if this were so 'tis much that I and those that I was with should not have heard or seen something of it For I pass'd the Isthmus twice and was Days in the last Trip that I made over it but yet did I never hear of any Noises under Ground there I sailed also in the South Seas taking in both times that I was there near Years and several Months of it I was in the Bay of  Panama  And after I went away those of our Crew that remained there spent a great deal more time in that Bay Yet did they never meet with such strange WhirlPools but found as pleasant sailing there as any where in the World Neither did I ever hear any of the  Spaniards  or  Indians  make mention of any such thing in all my Converse with them which certainly they would have done if they had ever experienced it had it been only to terrifie us and scare us away from their Coasts  I remember indeed our Countryman Mr  Gage  gives some hints of these strange Currents in this Bay in his Book called  A New Survey of the  WestIndies from  p  to but I am afraid he took  most of it upon trust from others or else he was Seasick all that little Voyage for he gives a very imperfect and lame Account of that Business as if he understood not what he wrote I should dislike his whole Book for that one stories sake if I did not know that he has writ candidly upon other Matters but I think I have said enough of this To proceed then  As to the great Tides which are reported to be in these Seas I have given instances of them but they are not so great as is reported neither do they ebb and flow so much any where as in the Gulph of  St Michael  only where indeed they flow over those small low Mangrove Islands at the Mouth of the Lagune and leave only the tops of the low Trees above Water for those Islands are very low neither do they afford any high Trees But however the Islands at the Mouth of the Gulph before you come to these low ones are near overflown yet are they very small and low in comparison with other Islands in the Bay of  Panama  And indeed should the Islands in that Bay be overflown the City of  Panama  would soon be many Yards under Water But so far is this from being true that the  Pearl Islands  which are very flat and low are yet never overflown For there the Tide riseth and falls not above or Foot on a Spring at the Southermost end of them which is almost opposite to the Gulph of  St Michael  and not above or Leagues distant from it And yet there it flows more than it does at or near  Panama  or any other Place in the Bay except just at the Mouths of Rivers by or Foot Therefore all that report is wholly groundless  But to go on  I have also observed that Islands lying afar off at Sea have seldom such high Tides as those that are near the Main or as any Places on the Main it self  as for example at the  Gallapagos Islands  which lie about Leagues from the Main the Tides don't rise and fall above a Foot and half or two Foot which is less than they do on the Coast of the Main For on most places of the Main it rises and falls or Foot more or less according as the Coast is more or less exposed to Indraughts or Rivers  Guam  one of the  Ladrone  Islands is also another instance of this There the Tide riseth not above or Foot at most In the Bay of  Panama  the Tides do keep a more constant and regular Course than on other places on the Coasts of  Peru  and  Mexico  it was for that reason I called them Currents in some places mentioned in my  Voyage round the World  as particularly near  Guatuloa  on the  Mexican Continent  in Chap IX Page but it was truly a Tide which there I called a Current and it sets to the Eastward as the Ebb doth to the West The Tides there do rise and fall about Foot as they do on most parts of that Coast  At  Ria Leja  they rise and fall about or Foot  At  Amapala  they also rise and fall about or Foot and the Flood there runs to the East and the Ebb to the West  In the Gulph of  Dulce  and  Neicoya  River they rise to or Foot but on the Coast of  Peru  they don't rise so high especially on all the Coast between Cape  St Francis  and the River  Guiaquil  there the Flood runs to the South and the Ebb to the North  At the Island  Plata  the Tide rises and falls or Foot but from Cape  Blanco  in about d South to d South the Tides are smaller there they rise and fall not above a Foot and a half or Foot The Flood on this Coast sets to the South and the Ebb to the North  In all my Cruisings among the Privateers I took notice of the risings of the Tides because by knowing it I always knew where we might best hall ashore and clean our ships which is also greatly observed by all Privateers  In most Places of the  WestIndies  the Tide flows but little over what it does in our Channel  In the  EastIndies  also the Tides are but small on most Coasts neither are they so regular as with us  The most irregular Tides that I did ever meet with are at  Tonqueen  in about d North Latitude and on the Coast of  New Holland  in about d South In both these places the neap Tides are scarce discernable Those of  Tonqueen  are described at large by Mr  Davenport  who was imp  oyed by Mr  James  when he was chief of the English Factors there to observe them And the whole Discourse is published in  The Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society  whither I refer you  At  New Holland  I had two Months time to observe the Tides There the Flood runs E by N and the Ebb W by S And they rise and fall about five Fathom  In all the Springs that we lay here the highest were Days after the Full or Change and that without any perceptible Cause in the Winds or Weather I must confess we were startled at it and though some of us had observed it in the Springs that happened while we lay on the Sand to clean our Ship as I have mentioned in my former Volume  ntituled  A New Voyage round the VVorld  Ch XVI  Page yet in that Spring that we designed to hall off in order to be gone from thence we did all take more particular notice of it than in the preceding Springs for many had not taken notice of it before And therefore the Major part of the Company supposing that it was a mistake in us who made those former Observations expected to hall off the Ship the third Tide after the Change but our Ship did not float then nor the next Tide neither which put them all into an amazement and a great Consternation too For many thought we should never have got her off at all but by digging away the Sand and so clearing a Passage for her into the Sea But the sixth Tide cleared all those doubts for the Tide then rose so high as to float her quite up when being all of us ready to work we hall'd her off and yet the next Tide was higher than that by which we were now all throughly satisfied that the Tides here do not keep the same time as they do in  England  This I must also observe That here was no River nor Lagune nor any other Indraught on the Land near us that might occasion these great Tides tho' 'tis very probable that the great Bending between  New Holland  and  New Guinea  may have both Rivers and Lagunes which may cause these great Tides or else there may be a Passage of the Sea between both Places as it is laid down in some Draughts Or if neither of these there may be at least a large and deep Sound  This is the more probable because of the extraordinary Flood that sets to the Eastward in all that Sea between  New Holland  and the Islands lying North of it which we most sensibly perceived when we were near  New Holland  And such a Tide as this must of necessity have a greater Indraught than barely a River or Lagune and 'tis the more  likely still that this Tide should have a Passage through between  New Holland  and  New Guinea  or at least a deep Sound there because it keeps along by the Main and doth not run in among the Islands to the North of it And besides the Northermost Promontory of  New Holland  shoots down almost to the Line which seems to be a Barrier to it on that side therefore it may in reason be supposed to have its Passage some other way but of this guess I have said enough  In the Streights of  Malacca  the Flood sets to the East and the Ebb to the West  I have found the Tides at  Malacca  Town to rise and fall about six Foot on a Spring I had the Experience of two SpringTides when I was Captain  Minchins  Mate as is beforementioned in my Voyage from  Achin  to  Malacca  On the East side of the African Coast between the  Cape of good Hope  and the  RedSea  the Tide keeps its constant Course The Flood runs to the Southward the Ebb to the Northward And at a Springtide in the Rivers on that Coast the Tide rises and falls six Foot especially in the River of  Natal  in Lat d South  I have this Relation from Capt  Rogers  who is a very Ingenious Person and well experienced on that Coast and is now gone Commander of a small Vessel thither to Trade  Having already largely treated of Tides I come now to speak somewhat of Currents  CUrrents and Tides differ many ways for Tides run forward and back again twice every Hours on the contrary Currents run a Day a VVeek nay sometimes more one way and then it may be run another way  In some particular Places they run six Months one way and six Months another  In other Places they constantly run one way only a day or two about full Moon and then they run strong against the former Course and after that return the same way again  In some Places they run constantly one way and never shift at all  The force of Tides is generally felt near the shore whereas Currents are at a remote distance neither are the Effects of them sensibly discerned by the rising or falling away of the VVater as those of the Tides are for these commonly set along shore  'Tis generally observed by Seamen that in all Places where Tradewinds blow the Current is influenced by them and moves the same way with the VVinds but 'tis not with a like swiftness in all Places neither is it always so discernable by us in the wide Ocean as it is near to some Coast and yet it is not so discernable neither very near any Coast except at Capes and Promontories that shoot far forth out into the Sea and about Islands also the Effects of them are felt more or less as they lye in the way of the TradeWinds  I shall Instance  Barbadoes  for one and all the Carribbes may as well be included  The greater Islands as  Hispaniola Jamaica  and  Cuba  have only some particular Capes or HeadLands exposed to Currents as Cape  Tiberoon  on  Hispaniola Point Pedro  and the N E Point of  Jamaica Cape de Cruz Cape Corientes  and  Cape Antonios  on  Cuba  But of all the Islands in the  WestIndies  there are none more sensible of Currents than  Corrisao  and  Aruba  nor any Capes on the Continent so remarkable for Currents as  Cape Roman  which shoots out against the Sea between those two Places as also  Cape Coquibaco  and  Cape La Vela  to Leeward all three on the same HeadLand which shoots forth far without any other Land on the Coast  There is no such HeadLand till you come to  Cape Gratia de Dios  which is about Leagues to Leeward Indeed to the Eastward there is Land that trends out almost so far within Leagues of it  Viz  The Island  Trinidado  and the Land against it and there also are great Currents But I shall first speak of the Currents between  Cape La Vela  and  Cape Gratia de Dios  The Currents at  Cape La Vela  do seldom shift therefore Ships that ply to Windward to get about it do not ply near the shore but stand off to Sea till they come in sight of  Hispaniola  and then back again till within about or Leagues of the Cape but not nearer But in the Westerly WindSeason which is from  October  till  March  Ships often meet Westerly Winds that last two or three Days with which they may run to the Eastward without any trouble  Between  Cape La Vela  and  Cape Gratia de Dios  the Currents are much different from what they are against the Cape and this seems to proceed from the make of the Land for the shore between the  two Capes runs into the Southward making  great Bay And this Bay affords more varieties  Winds and Currents than any one part of the  VVestIndies  besides  Here in the Westerly WindSeason the Current sets to the Westward constantly but sometimes stronger than at other times At about four Leagues off shore you find it and so it continues till you are or Leagues off Beyond that you meet with an Easterly Wind and if there is any Current it runs also to the Westward therefore Ships that are bound to the Westward must run off to Sea Thirty or Forty Leagues to get a Wind or else if they have but a little way to go they must ply close under the shore that so they may Anchor when they please Otherwise they will be carried away to the Eastward Fourteen or Sixteen Leagues in a Nights time and that too tho' they have a faint Easterly Wind as frequently they meet with tho' 'tis the Westerly WindSeason  To the East of  Cape Roman  as high as the Island  Trinidado  you meet only a soaking faint Current setting to the Westward except only near such places as shoot out farthest into the Sea as about the  Testegos  which are small Islands lying to Windward of the Island  Margarita  Between those Islands and the Main you meet with a pretty strong Current therefore it is hard getting to the Eastward there but on all the Coast between  Cape Roman  and the HeadLand shooting out towards the  Testegos  you may ply up with the Land and SeaBreezes  From thence till you come as high as the Eastend of  Trinidado Isle  you meet with an extraordinary strong Current  From the Eastend of  Trinidado  till you come to  Surinam  though you meet an Easterly Current yet 'tis possible to beat it up with the Land and SeaBreezes  From  Surinam  also to  Cape Blanco  you may turn it up though to be sure you'll meet with Currents setting to the West except near the Full of the Moon and then on all the Coasts before mentioned we commonly meet with Currents setting to the Eastward at least then it slackens and stands still if it doth not run to the Eastward But when you are come as far to the East as  Cape Blanco  on the North of  Brazil  you meet with a Current always against you and so from thence Southerly as far as Cape  St Augustine  There is no dealing with this Promontory for it shoots out so far into the Sea and thereby lies so exposed to the SeaBreezes and the Currents that soak down between  Africa  and  Brazil  that it is quite contrary to reason to think there should not always be a strong Current setting to the N W  I have before hinted That in all Places where the Trade blows we find a Current setting with the Wind which is not so perceptible in the wide Sea as nearer the Shores yet even there the force of the Winds constantly blowing one way may and probably does move the surface of the Water along with it  From hence it may be inferred that the Southerly Winds on the Coast of  Africa  and the true Trade between it and  Brazil  gently move the surface of the Sea with it and the Trade being mostly at S E drives the Sea to the Northward slanting in on the Coast of  Brazil  which being there stopp'd  by the Land bends its Course Northerly toward  Cape St Augustine  And after it has doubled that great Promontory it falls away more gently towards the Coast of  Surinam  and from thence towards the  VVestIndies  For after it has doubled that Promontory it has more room to spread it self and thereby becomes weaker in motion being agitated by the Tradewinds which to the North of the Line we find commonly blowing at E N E and this still bears the Sea slanting down along the Coast to the Westward And probably 'tis for this reason that we find the Current setting strongest near those HeadLands beforementioned Whereas at  Barbadoes  and other of the Caribbee Islands we find only a soaking Current such as seems to arise only from the constancy of the Tradewinds blowing there and not from an original Current from the South part of the Atlantick which as I said before doubles about  Cape St Augustine  and so Coasts along pretty nigh the shore  The Currents about the Island  Trinidado  and at  Currisao  and  Aruba  as also between them and  Cape Roman  seem to indicate as much The Currents also between  Cape Roman  and  Cape La Vela  indicate the same  From  Cape La Vela  the Currents set still to the Westward towards  Cape Gratia de Dios  but in a direct Line and not borrowing or slanting in towards the shore For as I said before it is a large Bay and Currents commonly set from one HeadLand to another so that Bays have seldom any or if they have they are only Counter Currents And these Counter Currents too do set from one Point to another without interfering with the little Bays between And 'tis also very probable that these Counter Currents suchas we meet with in this Bay  in their Seasons after they have surrounded the Bay and are got as far to the East as  Cape La Vela  wheel off there and turn about again with the Stream to the Westward like an Eddy in a River  From  Cape Gratia de Dios  the Current sets away N W towards  Cape Catoch  and so passes away to the Northward between Cape  Catoch  on  Jucatan  and Cape  Antonio  on  Cuba  In the Channel between those two Capes we commonly find a strong Current setting to the Northward And here I have found them extraordinary strong  On the North side of  Jucatan  as you pass into the Bay of  Campeachy  you meet with a small soaking Current to the Westward even down to the bottom of the Bay of  Mexico  but on the North side of the Bay of  Mexico  the Current sets to the Eastward And 'tis probable that is the reason that the Spaniards coming from  La Vera Cruz  keep that shore aboard And 'tis as probable that the Current which sets to Leeward on all the Coast from Cape  St Augustine  to Cape  Catoch  never enters the Bay of  Mexico  but bends still to the Northward till 'tis check'd by the  Florida  shore and then wheels about to the East till it comes nearer the Gulphs Mouth and there joyning with the soaking Current that draws down on the North sides of  Hispaniola  and  Cuba  passes altogether with great strength through the Gulph of  Florida  which is the most remarkable Gulph in the World for its Currents because it always sets very strong to the North Yet near the shores on each side this Gulph there are Tides especially on the  Florida  shore and Ships may pass which way they please if they are acquainted  It has formerly been accounted very dangerous to meet with a North in this Gulph and for that  our  Jamaica  Ships to avoid them have rather  chosen to go to the Eastward and pass through th  Cacuses  in the Season that the Norths do blow Th  Cacuses  are Sands that lye off the N W end of  Hispaniola  Those that went from  Port Royal  in  Jamaica  had good Reason for this for if a North took them at their going out it would help them forward in their way which should they have been going towards the Gulph it would obstruct them Then besides if a North take a Ship in the Gulph the Wind blowing against the Current makes an extraordinary Sea and so thick come the Waves one after another that a ship can't possibly live in it yet of late they go through at all times of the Year and if a North takes them in the Gulph they put a way right before the Wind and Sea with a small HeadSail yet the Current is then as strong or stronger then at other times and forces them back stern foremost against both Wind and Sea For tho' the surface of the Sea is raised in Waves and driven violently with the Winds to the Southward yet the Current underneath runs still to the Northward neither is it any strange thing to see two different Currents at one place and time the superficial Water running one way and that underneath running a quite contrary For sometimes at an Anchor I have seen the Cable carryed thus by two different Streams the under part having been doubled one way and the upper part the contrary But 'tis certain in all other parts of the World the Current shifts at certain times of  he Year As in the  EastIndies  they run from East to West one part of the Year and from West to East the other part Or as in the  West Indies  and  Guinea  where they shift only near a Full Moon This is meant of parts of the Sea near any Coast yet there are strong Currents in the wide Ocean also setting contrary to the Rules beforegoing I mean against the Trade but 'tis not common  On the Coast of  Guinea  the Current sets East  except at or near a Full Moon but to the South of the Line from  Loango  to or d the Current  ets with the Wind from S to N except near the Full  To the Eastward of the  Cape of good Hope  from d South to d South the Currents from  May  ill  Oct  set E N E and the Winds then are at W S W or S W but from  Oct  till  May  when the Winds are between the E N E and E S E the Currents run to the West These Currents are thus found from or Leagues off the shore to about Within Leagues off the shore you have the Tide and not a Current and being past Leagues off shore the Current either ceaseth quite or is imperceptible  On the Coast of  India  North of the Line the Current sets with the Monsoon but does not shift altogether so soon sometimes not by Weeks or more and then never shifts again till after the Monsoon is settled in the contrary way As for Example the West Monsoon sets in the middle of  April  but the Current does not shift till the beginning of  May  So when the East Monsoon sets in about the middle of  September  the Current does not shift till  October  In the South Seas on the Coast of  Peru  the Current sets from South to North even from d to the Line and to or d North of it  At the  Gallapagos Islands  we found a soaking Current not very strong but so strong that a ship could get very little by turning and 'tis probable that nearer the Main they are stronger because of the constant Southerly Winds  The most remarkable Places for Currents in the South Seas are Cape  St Francis  Cape  Passao  Cape  St Laurence  and Cape  Blanco  This last has commonly very strong Currents setting to the N W which hinders ships mightily and the more because  t is a very windy place so that many times ships are not able to carry their Topsails and then it is but  ad plying to Windward against a Current I  had not so much Experience of the Mexican Coast because we commonly kept within the Verge of the Tides But on the Coast of  Guatamala  in the Lat of d m and d we had a Current setting S VV and it is probable that there also the Current sets with the VVinds For as it is before noted the Currents on all Coasts sets as the coasting Trade does  And thus have I finished what my own Experience or Relations from my Friends have furnished me with on this useful Subject of  Winds Tides Currents  c which I humbly offer not as a compleat and perfect account but as a rude and imperfect Beginning or Specimen of what may better be done by abler Hands hereafter And I hope this may be useful so far as to give a few hints to direct the more accurate Observations of others  The following Paper containing a short Description of a part of  Africk  that is not well known to  Europeans  I thought would not be unacceptable to the curious Reader I have therefore annexed it as I received from my ingenious Friend Capt  Rogers  who is lately gone to that Place and hath been their several times before  THE Country of  Natal  takes about d and half of Lat from N to S lying between the lat of d m South and N 'Tis bounded on the S by a Country inhabited by a small Nation of Savage People called by our English  Wildbush Men  that live in Caves and in holes of Rocks and have no other Houses but such as are formed by Nature They are of a low stature tauny colour  d with crisped Hair They are accounted very cruel to their Enemies Their Weapons are Bows and Poisoned Arrows These People have for their Neighbours on the S the  Hottantots Dellagoa  is a Navigable River in Lat S that bounds  Natal  on the N The Inhabitants of this River have a Commerce with the  Portuguese  of  Mozambique  who oft visit them in small Barks and trade there for Elephants Teeth of which they have great plenty Some English too have lately been there to purchase Teeth particularly Capt  Freak  just mentioned in my former Volume Ch P c who after he had been in the River of  Dellagoa  and purchased or Tun of Teeth lost his Ship on a Rock near  Madagascar  The Country of  Natal  lies open to the Indian Sea on the East but how far back it runs to the Westward is not yet known  That part of the Country which respects the Sea is plain Champion and Woody but within Land it appears more uneven by Reason of many Hills which rise in unequal Heights above each other Yet is it interlaced with pleasant Valleys and large Plains and 'tis checker'd with Natural Groves and Savannahs Neither is there any want of Water for every Hill affords little Brooks which glide down several ways some of which after several turnings and windings meet by degrees and make up the River of  Natal  which dischargeth it self into the EastIndian Ocean in the Lat of d South There it opens pretty wide and is deep enough for small Vessels But at the Mouth of the River is a Bar which has not above or foot Water on it in a Springtide though within there is Water enough This River is the principal of the Country of  Natal  and has been lately frequented by some of our English Ships particularly by a small Vessel that Captain  Rogers  formerly mentioned commanded  There are also other Streams and Rivers which bend their Courses Northerly especially one of a considerable bigness about Mile within Land and which runs due North  The Woods are composed of divers sorts of Trees many of which are very good Timber and fit for any uses they being tall and large The Savannahs also are cloathed with kindly thick Grass  The LandAnimals of this Country are Lyons Tigers Elephants Buffaloes Bullocks Deer Hogs Conies c Here are also abundance of SeaHorses  Buffaloes and Bullocks only are kept tame but the rest are all wild  Elephants are so plenty here that they feed together in great Troops or in a Company Mornings and Evenings they are seen grazing in the Savannahs but in the heat of the Day they retire into the Woods and they are very peaceable if not molested  Dears are very numerous here also They feed quietly in the Savannahs among the tame Cattle for they are seldom disturbed by the Natives  Here are Fowls of divers sorts some such as we have in  England viz  Duck and Teal both tame and wild and plenty of Cocks an d Hens Besides abundance of wild Birds wholly unknown to us  Here are a sort of large Fowls as big as a Peacock which have many fine coloured Feathers They are very rare and shy  There are others like Curlews but bigger The flesh  these is black yet sweet and wholesome Meat  The Sea and Rivers also do abound in Fish of divers sorts yet the Natives do but seldom endeavour to take any exce  Tortoises and that is chiefly when they come ashore in th Night to lay their Eggs Though they have also anothe very odd way which they sometimes make use of to cat  Turtle or Tortoises They take a living sucking Fish or  R  +mora  and fastning a couple of strings to it one at the hea  and the other at the tail they let the sucking Fish down int the Water on the Turtle Ground among the halfgrown o young Turtle and when they find that the Fish hath fastne  himself to the back of a Turtle as he will soon do they the draw him and the Turtle up together This way of Fishin as I have heard is also used at  Madagascar  The Natives of this Country are but of a middle Statur  yet have very good Limbs The Colour of their Skins i black their Hair crisped they are oval visaged their Nose neither flat nor high but very well proportioned their Teet are white and their Aspect is altogether graceful  They are nimble People but very lazy which probable for want of Commerce Their chief Employment is Husbandry They have a great many Bulls and Cows which the carefully look after for every Man knows his own thoug they run all promiscuously together in their Savannahs y  they have Pens near their own Houses where they mak them gentle and bring them to the Pail They also pla  Corn and fence in their Fields to keep out all Cattle as we tame as wild They have  Guinea Corn  which is their Bread and a small sort of Grain no bigger than Mustard seed w  which they make their Drink  Here are no Arts nor Trades profess'd among them b  every one makes for himself such necessaries as Need or O  +nament requires the Men keeping to their Employment an the Women to theirs  The Men build Houses Hunt Plant and do what is to  done abroad And the Women Milk the Cows dress the  +ctuals c and manage all Matters within Door  The Houses are not great nor richly furnished but they are ma  close and well thatched that neither Winds nor Weather  hurt them  They wear but few Cloaths and those extraordinary me  The Men go in a manner naked their common  arb being o  +ly a square piece of Cloath made with Silk Grass or  M  h  R  and wrought in form of a short Apron At the upper Corne it has two straps to tye round their Wastes and the lower or being finely fringed with the same hang▪ down to their Kne  They have Caps made with Beef Tallow of about or Inches high They are a great while of making these Caps for the Tallow must be made very pure before 'tis fit for this use Besides they lay on but a little at a time and mix it finely among the Hair and so it never afterwards comes off their Heads When they go a Hunting which is but seldom they p  re off or Inches from the top of it that so it may sit the snugger but the next Day they begin to build it up again and so they do every Day till 'tis of a decent and fashionable height  It would be a most ridiculous thing for a Man here to be seen without a Tallow Cap But Boys are not suffered to wear any till they come to Maturity and then they begin to build upon their Heads The Women have only short Petticoats which reach from the Waste to the Knee When it Rains they cover their Bodies with a simple Cowshide thrown over their Shoulders like a Blanket  The common Subsistence of these People is Bread made of  Guinea  Corn Beef Fish Milk Ducks Hens Eggs c They also drink Milk often to quench their Thirst and this sometimes when it is sweet but commonly they let it be sower first  Besides Milk which is the common Drink they make a better sort of the same Grain before mentioned purposely to be merry with And when they meet on such occasions the Men make themselves extraordinary fine with Feathers stuck into their Caps very thick They make use of the long Feathers of Cocks Tails and none else  Besides these Head Ornaments they wear a piece of Cowhide made like a Tail and 'tis fastened behind them as a Tail reaching from their Waste to the Ground This piece of Hide is about six Inches broad and each side of it is adorned with little Iron Rings of their own making  When they are thus attired their Heads a little intoxicated and the Musick playing they'll skip about merrily and shake their Tails to some purpose but are very innocent in their Mirth  Every Man may have as many Wives as he can purchase and maintain And without buying here are none to be had neither is there any other Commodity to be bought or sold but Women  Young Virgins are disposed of by their Fathers Brothers or nearest Male Relations The price is according to the Beauty of the Damsel  They have no Money in this Country but give Cows in exchange for Wives And therefore he is the richest Man that has most Daughters or Sisters for to be sure he will get Cattle enough  They make merry when they take their Wives but th Bride cries all her Wedding Day They live together in sma  Villages and the oldest Man governs the rest for all th  live together in one Village are a kin and therefore willing  to his Government  They are very just and extraordinary civil to Strangers This was remarkably experienced by two English Seame  that lived among them five Years their Ship was cast awa  on the Coast and the rest of their Consorts marched to th  River of  Dellagoa  but they stayed here till Captain  Roger  accidentally came hither and took them away with him They had gained the Language of the Country And the Native freely gave them Wives and Cows too They were belove  by all the People and so much reverenced that their Word  were taken as Laws And when they came away many o  the Boys cryed because they would not take them with them  FINIS  A General INDEX To both Volumes of  DAMPIER  's VOYAGES
