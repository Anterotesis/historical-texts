M  R  MASON WITH NOTES  Vatibus addere calcar  Ut studio majore petant Helicona virentem  HOR  EPISTLE THE FIRST  ARGUMENT OF THE FIRST EPISTLE  IntroductionDesign of the Poem to remove prejudices which obstruct the cultivation of Epic writingOrigin of PoetryHonors paid to its infancyHomer the first Poet remainingDifficulty of the question why he had no Successor in GreeceRemark of a celebrated Writer that as Criticism flourishes Poetry declinesDefence of CriticsDanger of a bigoted acquiescence in critical Systemsand of a Poet's criticising his own worksAdvantages of Friendship and Study of the higher Poets  AN ESSAY ON EPIC POETRY  EPISTLE I  PERISH that critic pride which oft has hurl'd  Its empty thunders o'er the Epic world  Which eager to extend its mimic reign  Would bind free Fancy in a servile chain  With papal rage the eye of Genius blind  And bar the gates of Glory on the mind  Such dark decrees have letter'd Bigots penn'd  Ver See NOTE I    Yet seiz'd that honor'd name the Poet's Friend  But Learning from her page their laws will blot  Scorn'd be their arrogance their name forgot  Th' indignant Bard abhorring base controul  Seeks the just Critic of congenial soul  Say MASON Judge and Master of the Lyre  Harmonious Chief of Britain's living Choir  Say wilt Thou listen to his weaker strains  Who pants to range round Fancy's rich domains  To vindicate her empire and disown  Proud System seated on her injur'd throne  Come while thy Muse contented with applause  Gives to her graceful song a little pause  Enjoying triumphs past at leisure laid  In thy sweet Garden's variegated shade  Or fondly hanging on some favorite Oak  That Harp whose notes the fate of Mona spoke  Strung by the sacred Druid's social band  And wisely trusted to thy kindred hand  Come for thy liberal and ingenuous heart  Can aid a Brother in this magic art  Let us and Freedom be our guide explore  The highest province of poetic lore  Free the young Bard from that oppressive awe  Which feels Opinion's rule as Reason's law  And from his spirit bid vain fears depart  Of weaken'd Nature and exhausted Art  Phantoms that literary spleen conceives  Dullness adopts and Indolence believes  While with advent'rous step we wind along  Th' expansive regions of Heroic song  From different sources let our search explain  Why few the Chieftains of this wide domain  Haply inspiriting poetic youth  Our verse may prove this animating truth  That Poesy's sublime neglected field  May still new laurels to Ambition yield  Her Epic trumpet in a modern hand  Still make the spirit glow the heart expand  Be such our doctrine our enlivening aim  The Muse's honor and our Country's fame  Thou first and fairest of the social Arts  Sovereign of liberal souls and feeling hearts  If in devotion to thy heavenly charms  I clasp'd thy altar with my infant arms  For thee neglected the wide field of wealth  The toils of int'rest and the sports of health  Enchanting Poesy that zeal repay  With powers to sing thy universal sway  To trace thy progress from thy distant birth  Heaven's pure descendant dear delight of Earth  Charm of all regions to no age confin'd  The prime ennobler of th' aspiring mind  Nor will thy dignity sweet Power disdain  What Fiction utters in her idle strain  Thy sportive Friend who mocking solemn Truth  Tells her fond tales of thy untutor'd youth  As wrong'd Latona so her tale begins  To Delphos travell'd with her youthful twins  Th' envenom'd Python with terrific sway  Cross'd the fair Goddess in her destin'd way  The heavenly parent in the wild alarm  Her little Dian in her anxious arm  High on a stone which she in terror trod  Cried to her filial guard the Archer God  Bidding with force that spoke the Mother's heart  Her young Apollo launch his ready dart  In measur'd sounds her rapid mandate flow'd  The first foundation of the future Ode  Thus at their banquets fabling Greeks rehearse  Ver See NOTE II  The fancied origin of sacred Verse  And though cold Reason may with scorn assail  Or turn contemptuous from their simple tale  Yet Poesy thy sister Art may stoop  From this weak sketch to paint th' impassion'd group  Though taste refin'd to modern Verse deny  The hacknied pageants of the Pagan sky  Their sinking radiance still the Canvass warms  Painting still glories in their graceful forms  Nor canst thou envy if the world agree  To grant thy Sister claims denied to thee  For thee the happier Art the elderborn  Superior rights and dearer charms adorn  Confin'd she catches with observance keen  Her single moment of the changeful scene  But thou endu'd with energy sublime  Unquestion'd arbiter of space and time  Canst join the distant the unknown create  And while Existence yields thee all her state  On the astonish'd mind profusely pour  Myriads of forms that Fancy must adore  Yet of thy boundless power the dearest part  Is firm possession of the feeling Heart  No progeny of Chance by Labor taught  No slowform'd creature of scholastic thought  The child of Passion thou thy lyre she strung  To her parental notes she tun'd thy tongue  Gave thee her boldest swell her softest tone  And made the compass of her voice thy own  To Admiration source of joy refin'd  Chaste lovely mover of the simple mind  To her though sceptics in their pride declaim  With many an insult on her injur'd name  To her sweet Poesy we owe thy birth  Thou first encomiast of the fruitful Earth  By her inspir'd the earliest mortal found  The eardelighting charm of measur'd sound  He hail'd the Maker of a world so fair  And the first accent of his song was prayer  O most attractive of those airy Powers  Who most illuminate Man's chequer'd hours  Is there an Art in all the group divine  Whose dawn of Being must not yield to thine  Religion's self whose provident controul  Takes from fierce Man his anarchy of soul  She o'er thy youth with fond affection hung  And borrow'd music from thy infant tongue  Law sterner Law whose potent voice imprest  Severest terror on the human breast  With thy fresh flow'rs her aweful figure crown'd  And spoke her mandate in thy softer sound  E'en cold Philosophy whom later days  Saw thy mean rival envious of thy praise  Who clos'd against thee her ungrateful arms  And urg'd her Plato to defame thy charms  She from thy childhood gain'd no fruitless aid  From thee she learnt her talent to persuade  Gay Nature view'd thee with a smiling glance  The Graces round thee fram'd the frolic dance  And well might festive Joy thy favor court  Thy song turn'd strife to peace and toil to sport  Exhausted Vigor at thy voice reviv'd  And Mirth from thee her dearest charm deriv'd  Triumphant Love in thy alliance blest  Enlarg'd his empire o'er the gentle breast  His torch assum'd new lustre from thy breath  And his clear flame defied the clouds of death  But of the splendid train who felt thy sway  Or drew existence from thy vital ray  Glory with fondest zeal proclaim'd thy might  And hail'd thee victor of oblivious Night  Her martial trumpet to thy hand she gave  At once to quicken and reward the Brave  It soundshis blood the kindling Hero pays  A cheap and ready price for thy eternal praise  Tho' selfish Fear th' immortal strain deride  And mock the Warrior's wish as frantic pride  Ye gallant hapless Dead of distant time  Whose fame has perish'd unembalm'd in rhyme  As thro' the desert air your ashes fly  In Fancy's ear the nameless atoms cry  "To us unhappy cruel Fates refuse  "The wellearn'd record of th' applauding Muse"  Blest are those Chiefs who blazon'd on her roll  Still waken virtue in each kindred soul  Their bright existence still on earth prolong  And shine for ever in the deathless song  Yet oft Oblivion in a treacherous shade  Has sunk the tuneful rites to Valor paid  Her palsied lips refusing to rehearse  The sacred old traditionary verse  As well the curious eye with keen desire  Might hope to catch that spark of vital fire  Which first thro' Chaos shot a sudden light  And quicken'd Nature in its transient flight  As the fond ear to catch the fleeting note  Which on the ravish'd air was heard to float  When first the Muse her Epic strain began  And every list'ning Chief grew more than Man  But as the Ruler of the newborn day  From Chaos rose in glory's rich array  So from deep shades impenetrably strong  That shroud the darken'd world of antient song  Bright HOMER bursts magnificently clear  The solar Lord of that poetic sphere  Before whose blaze in wide luxuriance spread  Each Grecian Star hides his diminish'd head  Whose beams departed yet enchant the sight  In Latium's softer chaste reflected light  Say ye whose curious philosophic eye  Searches the depth where Nature's secrets lie  Ye who can tell how her capricious fit  Directs the flow and ebb of human wit  And why obedient to her quick command  Springtides of Genius now enrich her fav'rite land  Now sink by her to different climes assign'd  And only leave some worthless weeds behind  Say why in Greece unrival'd and alone  The Sovereign Poet grac'd his Epic throne  Why did the realm that echoed his renown  Produce no kindred heir to claim his crown  If as the liberal mind delights to think  Fancy's rich flow'rs their vital essence drink  From Liberty's pure streams that largely roll  Their quick'ning virtue thro' the Poet's soul  Why in the period when this Friend of Earth  Made Greece the model of heroic worth  And saw her votaries act beneath her sway  Scenes more sublime than Fiction can display  Why did the Epic Muse's silent lyre  Ver See NOTE III  Shrink from those feats that summon'd all her fire  Or if as courtly Theorists maintain  The Muses revel in a Monarch's reign  Why when young Ammon's soul athirst for fame  Call'd every Art to celebrated his name  When ready Painting at his sovereign nod  With aweful thunder arm'd this mimic God  Why did coy Poesy tho' fondly woo'd  Refuse that dearer smile for which he sued  And see him shed in martial Honor's bloom  The tear of envy on Achilles' tomb  In vain would Reason those nice questions solve  Which the fine play of mental powers involve  In Bards of ancient time with genius fraught  What mind can trace how thought engender'd thought  How little hints awak'd the large design  And subtle Fancy spun her variegated line  Yet sober Critics of no vulgar note  But such as Learning's sons are proud to quote  The progress of Homeric verse explain  As if their souls had lodg'd in Homer's brain  Laughs not the spirit of poetic frame  However slightly warm'd by Fancy's flame  When grave Bossu by System's studied laws  Ver See NOTE IV  The Grecian Bard's ideal picture draws  And wisely tells us that his Song arose  As the good Parson's quiet Sermon grows  Who while his easy thoughts no pressure find  From hosts of images that croud the mind  First calmly settles on some moral text  Then creepsfrom one divisionto the next  Nor if poetic minds more slowly drudge  Thro' the cold comments of this Gallic judge  Will their indignant spirit less deride  That subtle Pedant's more presumptive pride  Whose bloated page with arrogance replete  Imputes to VIRGIL his own dark conceit  Ver See NOTE V  And from the tortur'd Poet dares to draw  That latent sense which HORACE never saw  Which if on solid proof more strongly built  Must brand the injur'd Bard with impious guilt  While such Dictators their vain efforts waste  In the dark visions of distemper'd Taste  Let us that pleasing happier light pursue  Which beams benignant from the milder few  Who justly conscious of the doubts that start  In all nice questions on each finer Art  With modest doubt assign each likely cause  But dare to dictate no decisive laws  'Tis said by one who with this candid claim  Ver See NOTE VI  Has gain'd no fading wreath of Critic fame  Who fondly list'ning to her various rhyme  Has mark'd the Muse's step thro' many a clime  That where the settled Rules of Writing spread  Where Learning's code of Critic Law is read  Tho' other treasures deck th' enlighten'd shore  The germs of Fancy ripen there no more  Are Critics then that bold imperious tribe  The Guards of Genius who his path prescribe  Are they like Visirs in an Eastern court  Who sap the very power they should support  Whose specious wiles the royal mind unnerve  And sink the monarch they pretend to serve  No of their value higher far I deem  And prize their useful toil with fond esteem  When LOWTH's firm spirit leads him to explore  The hallow'd confines of Hebraic lore  When his free pages luminous and bold  The glorious end of Poesy unfold  Assert her powers her dignity defend  And speak her as she is fair Freedom's friend  When thus he shines his mitred Peers above  I view his warmth with reverential love  Proud if my verse may catch reflected light  From the rich splendor of a mind so bright  Blest be the names to no vain system tied  Who render Learning's blaze an useful guide  A friendly beacon rais'd on high to teach  The wand'ring bark to shun the shallow beach  But O ye noble and aspiring few  Whose ardent souls poetic fame pursue  Ye on whom smiling Heaven perfection's source  Seems to bestow unlimitable force  The inborn vigor of your souls defend  Nor lean too fondly on the firmest friend  Genius may sink on Criticism's breast  By weak dependance on her truth opprest  Sleep on her lap and stretch his lifeless length  Shorn by her soothing hand of all his strength  Thou wilt not MASON thou whose generous heart  Must feel that Freedom is the soul of Art  Thou wilt not hold me arrogant or vain  If I advise the young poetic train  To deem infallible no Critic's word  Not e'en the dictates of thy Attic HURD  No not the Stagyrite's unquestion'd page  The Sire of Critics sanctified by age  The noblest minds with solid reason blest  Who feel that faculty above the rest  Who argue on those arts they never try  Exalt that Reason they so oft apply  Till in its pride with tyrannous controul  It crush the kindred talents of the soul  And hence in every Art will systems rise  Which Fancy must survey with angry eyes  And at the lightning of her scornful smile  In frequent ruin sinks the labor'd pile  How oft my ROMNEY have I known thy vein  Swell with indignant heat and gen'rous pain  To hear in terms both arrogant and tame  Some reas'ning Pedant on thy Art declaim  Its laws and limits when his sovereign taste  With firm precision has minutely trac'd  And in the close of a decisive speech  Pronounc'd some point beyond the Pencil's reach  How has thy Genius by one rapid stroke  Refuted all the sapient things he spoke  Thy Canvass placing in the clearest light  His own Impossible before his sight  O might the Bard who loves thy mental fire  Who to thy fame attun'd his early lyre  Learn from thy Genius when dull Fops decide  So to refute their systematic pride  Let him at least succeeding Poets warn  To view the Pedant's lore with doubt or scorn  And e'en to question with a spirit free  Establish'd Critics of the first degree  Among the names that Judgment loves to praise  The pride of ancient or of modern days  What Laws of Poesy can Learning shew  Above the Critic song of sage DESPREAUX  His fancy elegant his judgment nice  His method easy and his style concise  The Bard of Reason with her vigor fraught  Her purest doctrine he divinely taught  Nor taught in vain His precept clear and chaste  Reform'd the errors of corrupted Taste  And French Imagination who was bit  By that Tarantula distorted Wit  Ceasing her antic gambols to rehearse  Blest the pure magic of his healing verse  With his loud fame applauding Europe rung  And his just praise a rival Poet sung  Yet had this Friend of Versedevoted Youth  This tuneful Teacher of Poetic truth  Had he but chanc'd his doctrine to diffuse  Ere Milton commun'd with his facred Muse  And could that English selfdependant soul  Born with such energy as mocks controul  Could his high spirit with submissive awe  Have stoop'd to listen to a Gallic Law  His hallow'd subject by that Law forbid  Ver See NOTE VII    Might still have laid in silent darkness hid  And this bright Sun not rising in our sphere  HOMER had wanted still his true compeer  From hence let Genius to himself be just  Hence learn ye Bards a liberal distrust  Whene'er 'tis said by System's haughty Son  That what He cannot do can ne'er be done  'Tis Fancy's right th' exalted throne to press  Whose height proud System can but blindly guess  Springs whose existence she denies unlock  And call rich torrents from the flinty rock  Let the true Poet who would build a name  In noble rivalship of antient fame  When he would plan to triumph over Time  The splendid fabric of his lofty rhyme  Let him the pride of Constantine assume  Th' imperial Founder of the second Rome  Who scorn'd all limits to his work assign'd  Ver See NOTE VIII  Save by th' inspiring God who rul'd his mind  Or like the fabled  Jupiter ut perhibent spatium quum discere vellet  Naturae regni nescius ipse sui  Armigeros utrimque duos aequalibus alis  Misit ab Eois Occiduisque plagis  Parnassus geminos fertur junxisse volatus  Contulit alternas Pythius axis aves  CLAUDIAN  Jove to ascertain  The doubtful confines of his wide domain  Two Eagles let him send of equal wing  Whose different flight may form a perfect ring  And at the point where Sense and Fancy meet  There safely bold and though sublime discreet  His fame's foundation let him firmly lay  Nor dread the danger of disputed sway  Yet if the Bard to glory must aspire  By free exertion of unborrow'd fire  Nor like the Classic Bigot vainly deem  No modern Muse can challenge just esteem  Unless her robe in every fold be prest  To fall precisely like the Grecian vest  If the blind notion he must boldly shun  That Beauty's countless forms are only one  And not when Fancy from her magic hoard  Would blindly bring him treasures unexplor'd  Snap her light wand and force her hand to bear  The heavier Compass and the formal Square  Let him no less their dangerous pride decline  Who singly criticise their own design  In that nice toil what various perils lurk  Not Pride alone may mar the needful work  But foes more common to the feeling nerve  Where Taste and Genius dwell with coy Reserve  The sickly Doubt with modest weakness fraught  The languid Tedium of o'erlabour'd thought  The Pain to feel the growing work behind  The finish'd model in the forming mind  These foes that oft the Poet's bosom pierce  These that condemn'd to fire Virgilian Verse  Prove that the Bard a bold yet trembling elf  Should find a Critic firmer than himself  But what fine Spirit will assume the Judge  Patient thro' all this irksome toil to drudge  'Tis here O Friendship here thy glories shine  The hard th' important task is only thine  For thou alone canst all the powers unite  That justly make it thy peculiar right  Thine the fixt eye which at no foible winks  Thine the warm zeal which utters all it thinks  In those sweet tones that hasty Spleen disarm  That give to painful Truth a winning charm  And the quick hand of list'ning Genius teach  To grasp that excellence he burns to reach  Thou Sweet subduer of all mental strife  Thou Source of vigor thou Support of life  Nor Art nor Science could delight or live  Without that energy thy counsels give  Genius himself must fink in dumb despair  Unblest uncherish'd by thy cheering care  Nor let the Bard elate with youthful fire  When Fancy to his hand presents the lyre  When her strong plumes his soaring spirit lift  When Friendship Heaven's more high and holy gift  With zeal angelic prompts his daring flight  And round him darts her doubtdispelling light  Let him not then by Vanity betray'd  Look with unjust contempt on Learning's aid  But as th' advent'rous Seaman to attain  That bright renown which great Discoverers gain  Consults the conduct of each gallant name  Who sail'd before him in that chace of Fame  Reviews with frequent glance their useful chart  Marks all their aims and fathoms all their art  So let the Poet trace  their  happy course  So bravely emulate  their  mental force  Whose daring souls from many a different clime  Have nobly ventur'd on the sea of Rhyme  Led by no fear his swelling sail to slack  Let him with eager eyes pursue the track  Not like a Pirate with insidious views  To plunder every vessel he pursues  But with just hope to find yet farther shores  And pass each rival he almost adores  END OF THE FIRST EPISTLE  EPISTLE THE SECOND  ARGUMENT OF THE SECOND EPISTLE  Character of Antient PoetsHomerApollonius RhodiusVirgilLucan  AN ESSAY ON EPIC POETRY  EPISTLE II  HAIL mighty Father of the Epic line  Thou vast prolific intellectual Mine  Whence veins of antient and of modern gold  The wealth of each poetic world have roll'd  Great Bard of Greece whose everduring Verse  All ages venerate all tongues rehearse  Could blind idolatry be justly paid  To aught of mental power by man display'd  To thee thou Sire of soulexalting Song  That boundless worship might to thee belong  For as thy Jove on his Olympian throne  In his unrivall'd sway exults alone  Commanding Nature by his aweful nod  In high seclusion from each humbler God  So shines thy Genius thro' the cloud of years  Exalted far above thy Pagan peers  By the rich splendor of creative fire  And the deep thunder of thy martial lyre  The conscious world confesses thy controul  And hails thee Sovereign of the kindling soul  Yet could thy mortal shape revisit earth  How would it move great Bard thy scornful mirth  To hear vain Pedants to thy Verse assign  Scholastic thoughts that never could be thine  To hear the quaint conceits of modern Pride  Blaspheme thy Fancy and thy Taste deride  When thus in Vanity's capricious fit  We see thy fame traduc'd by Gallic wit  Ver See NOTE I  We see a Dwarf who dares his foot to rest  On a recumbent Giant's ample chest  And lifting his pert form to public sight  Boasts like a child his own superior height  But neither envious Wit's malignant craft  Tho' arm'd with Ridicule's envenom'd shaft  Nor fickle Fashion's more tyrannic sway  Whose varying voice the sons of Earth obey  Can shake the solid base of thy renown  Or blast the verdure of thy Laurel crown  Tho' Time who from his manycolour'd wings  Scatters ten thousand shades o'er human things  Has wrought unnumber'd changes since thy birth  And given new features to the face of earth  Tho' all thy Gods who shook the starry pole  Unquestion'd Rulers of the Pagan soul  Are fallen with their fanes in ruin hurl'd  Their worship vanish'd from th' enlighten'd world  Still its immortal force thy Song retains  Still rules obedient man and fires his glowing veins  For Nature's self that great and constant power  One and the same thro' every changing hour  Gave thee each secret of her reign to pierce  And stampt her signet on thy sacred Verse  That aweful signet whose imperial sway  No age disputes no regions disobey  For at its sight the subject passions start  And open all the passes of the heart  'Twas Nature taught thy Genius to display  That host of Characters who grace thy lay  So richly varied and so vast the store  Her plastic hand can hardly model more  'Twas Nature noblest of poetic Guides  Gave thee thy flowing Verse whose copious tides  Gushing luxuriant from high Fancy's source  By no vain art diverted in their course  With splendid ease with simple grandeur roll  Spread their free wealth and fertilize the soul  There are whom blind and erring zeal betrays  To wound thy Genius with illjudging praise  Who rashly deem thee of all Arts the sire  Who draw dull smoke from thy resplendent fire  Pretend thy fancied Miracles to pierce  And form quaint riddles of thy clearest Verse  Blind to those brighter charms and purer worth  Which make thy Lays the lasting joy of earth  For why has every age with fond acclaim  Swell'd the loud note of thy increasing fame  Not that cold Study may from thee deduce  Vain codes of mystic lore and laws abstruse  But that thy Song presents like solar light  A world in action to th' enraptur'd sight  That with a force beyond th' enervate rules  Of tame Philosophy's pedantic Schools  Thy living Images instruct mankind  Mould the just heart and fire th' heroic mind  E'en SOCRATES himself that purest Sage  Ver See NOTE II  Imbib'd his Wisdom from thy moral page  And haply Greece the Wonder of the Earth  For feats of martial fire and civic worth  That glorious Land of noblest minds the nurse  Owes her unrivall'd race to thy inspiring Verse  For O what Greek who in his youthful vein  Had felt thy soulinvigorating strain  Who that had caught amid the festive throng  The public lesson of thy patriot Song  Could ever cease to feel his bosom swell  With zeal to dare and passion to excel  In thee thy grateful country justly prais'd  The noblest Teacher of the tribes she rais'd  Thy voice which doubly gave her fame to last  Form'd future Heroes while it sung the past  What deep regret thy fond admirers feel  That mythologic clouds thy life conceal  That like a distant God thou'rt darkly shewn  Felt in thy Works but in Thyself unknown  Perchance the shades that hide thy mortal days  From keen Affection's disappointed gaze  And that Idolatry so fondly proud  With which thy Country to thy genius bow'd  Might form the cause why kindling with thy fire  No Grecian rival struck thy Epic lyre  Perchance not seeing how thy steps were train'd  How they the summit of Parnassus gain'd  On thy oppressive Glory's flaming pride  Young Emulation gaz'd and gazing died  The Muses of the Attic Stage impart  To many a Votary their kindred art  And she who bids the Theban Eagle bear  Her lyric thunder thro' the stormy air  How high soe'er she leads his daring flight  Ver See NOTE III  Guides his bold rivals to an equal height  Of all the Grecian Bards in Glory's race  'Tis thine alone by thy unequall'd pace  To reach the goal with loud applause and hear  No step approaching thine no rival near  Yet may not Judgment with severe disdain  Slight the young RHODIAN's variegated strain  Ver See NOTE IV  Tho' with less force he strike an humbler shell  Beneath his hand the notes of Passion swell  His tender Genius with alluring art  Displays the tumult of the Virgin's heart  When Love like quivering rays that never rest  Darts thro' each vein and vibrates in her breast  Tho' Nature feel his Verse tho' she declare  Medea's magic is still potent there  Yet Fancy sees the slighted Poet rove  In pensive anger thro' th' Elysian Grove  From Critic shades whose supercilious pride  His Song neglected or his Powers decried  He turns indignantunopprest by fears  Behold he seeks the sentence of his Peers  See their just band his honest claim allow  See pleasure lighten on his laurell'd brow  He soars the Critic's cold contempt above  For VIRGIL greets him with fraternal love  Hail thou rich Column on whose highwrought frame  The Roman Muse supports her Epic fame  Hail great Magician whose illusive charms  Gave pleasing lustre to a Tyrant's arms  To Jove's pure sceptre turn'd his iron rod  And made the Homicide a Guardian God  Hail wond'rous Bard to Glory's temple led  Thro' paths that Genius rarely deigns to tread  For Imitation she whose syren song  Betrays the skilful and unnerves the strong  Preserving thee on her perfidious shore  Where many a Poet had been wreck'd before  Led thee to heights that charm th' astonish'd eye  And with Invention's heaven in splendor vie  As Rome herself by long unwearied toil  Glean'd the fair produce of each foreign soil  From all her wide Dominion's various parts  Borrow'd their laws their usages their arts  Imported knowledge from each adverse zone  And made the wisdom of the world her own  Thy patient spirit thus from every Bard  Whose mental riches won thy just regard  Drew various treasure which thy skill refin'd  And in the fabric of thy Verse combin'd  It was thy glory as thy fond desire  To echo the sweet notes of HOMER's lyre  But with an art thy hand alone can reach  An art that has endear'd the strain of each  So the young Nymph whose tender arms embrace  An elder Sister of enchanting grace  Though form'd herself with every power to please  By genuine character and native ease  Yet fondly copies from her favourite Fair  Her mien her motion her attractive air  Her robe's nice shape her riband's pleasing hue  And every ornament that strikes the view  But she displays by imitative art  So quick a spirit and so soft a heart  The graceful mimic while our eyes adore  We think the model cannot charm us more  Tho' seen together each more lovely shews  And by comparison their beauty grows  Some Critics to decide which Bard prevails  Weigh them like Jove but not in golden scales  In their false balance the wrong'd GREEK they raise  VIRGIL sinks loaded with their heavy praise  Ver See NOTE V  Ingenuous Bard whose mental rays divine  Shaded by modest doubts more sweetly shine  Thou whose last breath unconscious of the wrong  Doom'd to destruction thy sublimest Song  How dull their incense in thy sight must burn  How must thy spirit with abhorrence turn  From their disgusting rites who at thy shrine  Blaspheme thy Master's name to honor thine  More equal tribute in their simpler flowers  The Poets offer to your separate powers  For all poetic eyes delight to view  Your different forms and with devotion due  In each the radiant Delphic God they own  By beauteous majesty distinctly shewn  But they behold the lofty HOMER stand  The bright Colossus of the Rhodian land  Beneath whose feet the waves submissive roll  Whose towering head appears to prop the pole  Stupendous Image grand in every part  And seeming far above the reach of mortal art  In thee thou lovely Mantuan Bard appear  The softer features of the Belvidere  That finish'd grace which fascinates all eyes  Yet from the copying hand elusive flies  Charms so complete by such pure spirit warm'd  They make less perfect beauty seem deform'd  O had thy Muse whose decorating skill  Could spread rich foliage o'er the leafless hill  Had she who knew with nicest hand to frame  The sweet unperishable wreaths of fame  Had she exalted by a happier fate  Virtue's free Herald and no Slave of State  Deck'd worthier shrines with her unfading flower  And given to Freedom what she gave to Power  Then with more keen delight and warmer praise  The world had listen'd to thy bolder lays  Perchance had ow'd to thee a mighty debt  Verse where Perfection her bright seal had set  Where Art could nothing blame and Nature nought regret  Of coarser form with less pathetic charms  Hating with Stoic pride a tyrant's arms  In the keen fervor of that florid time  When youthful Fancy pours her hasty rhyme  When all the mind's luxuriant shoots appear  Untrimm'd by Art by Interest or Fear  See daring LUCAN for that wreath contend  Which Freedom twines for her poetic friend  'Tis thine thou bold but injur'd Bard 'tis thine  Tho' Critic spleen insult thy rougher line  Tho' wrong'd thy Genius and thy Name misplac'd  By vain distinctions of fastidious Taste  Indignant Freedom with just anger fir'd  Shall guard the Poet whom herself inspir'd  What tho' thy early uncorrected page  Betrays some marks of a degenerate age  Tho' many a tumid point thy verse contains  Like warts projecting from Herculean veins  Tho' like thy CATO thy stern Muse appear  Her manners rigid and her frown austere  Like him still breathing Freedom's genuine flame  Justice her idol Public Good her aim  Well she supplies her want of softer art  By all the sterling treasures of the heart  By Energy from Independance caught  And the free Vigor of unborrow'd Thought  Thou Bard most injur'd by malicious fate  Could not thy Blood appease a Tyrant's hate  Must He still gall'd by thy poetic claim  With falshood persecute thy moral fame  Shall History's pen to aid his vengeance won  Ver See NOTE VI  Brand thee brave Spirit as an impious Son  Who meanly fear'd to yield his vital flood  And sought his safety by a Parent's blood  Base calumny at which Belief must halt  And blind Credulity herself revolt  Could that firm Youth become so vile a slave  Whose voice new energy to virtue gave  Whose Stoic soul all abject thoughts abhorr'd  And own'd no sordid passion as its lord  Who in the trying hour of mortal pain  While life was ebbing from his open vein  Alike unconscious of Remorse and Fear  His heart unshaken and his senses clear  Smil'd on his doom and like the fabled bird  Whose music on Meander's bank was heard  Form'd into tuneful notes his parting breath  And sung th' approaches of undreaded death  Rise thou wrong'd Bard above Detraction's reach  Whose arts in vain thy various worth impeach  Enjoy that fame thy spirit knew to prize  And view'd so fondly with prophetic eyes  Tho' the nice Critics of fastidious France  Survey thy Song with many a scornful glance  And as a Goth the kinder judge accuse  Who with their great CORNEILLE commends thy Muse  Let Britain eager as the Lesbian State  To shield thy Pompey from the wrongs of Fate  To thee with pride a fond attachment shew  Thou Bard of Freedom tho' the world's thy foe  As keenly sensible of Beauty's sway  Let our just isle such generous honor pay  To the fair partner of thy hapless life  As Lesbos paid to Pompey's lovely Wife  Ver See NOTE VII  Ye feeling Painters who with genius warm  Delineate Virtue in her softest form  Let ARGENTARIA on your canvass shine  Ver See NOTE VIII  A graceful mourner at her Poet's shrine  For nobly fearless of the Tyrant's hate  She mourns her murder'd Bard in solemn state  With pious care she decks his splendid tomb  Where the dark Cypress sheds its soothing gloom  There frequent takes her solitary stand  His dear Pharsalia in her faithful hand  That hand whose toil the Muses still rehearse  Which fondly copied his unfinish'd Verse  See as she bends before his recent urn  See tender Grief to Adoration turn  O lovely Mourner could my Song bestow  Unfading glory on thy generous woe  Age after age thy virtue should record  And thou should'st live immortal as thy Lord  Him Liberty shall crown with endless praise  True to her cause in Rome's degenerate days  Him like his Brutus her fond eye regards  And hails him as the last of Roman Bards  END OF THE SECOND EPISTLE  EPISTLE THE THIRD  ARGUMENT OF THE THIRD EPISTLE  Sketch of the Northern and the Provençal PoetryThe most distinguished Epic Poets of Italy Spain Portugal France and England  AN ESSAY ON EPIC POETRY  EPISTLE III  BLEST be the hand that with a generous care  To the bright Crown which Learning loves to wear  Restores the Gem whose lustre faint and pale  Died in the fold of dark Oblivion's veil  Such praise O MASON to the Bard is due  In whose fraternal guard thy Genius grew  O'er whose untimely grave thy Lyre has paid  Its just devotion to a Brother's shade  And thus hereafter shall the British Muse  In Memory's fane the fairest tablet chuse  To bid her sons your blended names admire  The pride of Friendship's as of Fancy's choir  Thy modest GRAY solicitous to pierce  The dark and distant source of modern Verse  By strings untried first taught his English Lyre  To reach the Gothic Harp's terrific fire  The North's wild spectres own his potent hand  And Hell's nine portals at his voice expand  With new existence by his Verse endued  See Gothic Fable wakes her shadowy brood  Which in the Runic rhymes of many a  Scald  With pleasing dread our Northern sires appall'd  Ye brave Progenitors ye vigorous Source  Of modern Freedom and of Europe's force  While your rude minds athirst for martial strife  Mock'd all the meaner arts of polish'd life  The Muse still led you by her magic clue  And from your savage strength new vigor drew  In War's dire field your dauntless Bards appear'd  Aloft their animating harps they rear'd  Pour'd through the charging host their potent strain  And swell'd the fiery flood in Valor's vein  Souls thus inspir'd in every scene elate  Defied the utmost rage of adverse fate  In tort'ring death the Royal Captive sang  And smiles of triumph hid his mortal pang  Ver See NOTE I  Thus to brave ODIN's Songs our Northern sire  Rude early framer of the modern Lyre  Fierce Freedom gave an energy sublime  Parent and Guardian of the Gothic Rhyme  While nurtur'd in the North's protecting arms  The modern Muse display'd her infant charms  Like Jove's undaunted Child her spirit glow'd  And force Herculean in her cradle shew'd  Her native scene in roughness she surpast  Her breath tempestuous as the Northern blast  But when to softer climes the vagrant flew  And bask'd beneath a sky of azure hue  When for her throne the flowery South she chose  And form'd her crown of the Provençal Rose  Warm'd by a brighter Sun's relaxing beams  She tun'd her alter'd voice to tender themes  Here her gay form a gaudier dress assumes  And shines in Chivalry's imperial plumes  Her votaries wear proud Honor's mystic glove  And every lyre resounds Romantic Love  Save when to burst Oppression's mental chain  Keen Satire mingles with this gallant train  Strikes Priestly pride with Wit's vindictive flash  And galls the ghostly Tyrant with her lash  Ver See NOTE II  Afraid of Poesy's expansive flood  These early Bards along the shallows scud  In some light skiff for on the depths untried  No fulltrimm'd vessel floats in Epic pride  As infants eager for regard abound  In sportive efforts of uncertain sound  Before their little artless lips can reach  The harder elements of perfect speech  So the young language of each modern clime  Rose by prelusive lays to lofty rhyme  Thro' many an age while in the Convent bred  O'er the chill'd mind scholastic darkness spread  Those keener Spirits who from Nature caught  The warmth that kindles to Poetic thought  Betray'd Ambition by thy blind desire  Struck with illfated zeal the Latian lyre  Ver See NOTE III  Tho' Discord's hand the jarring strings had crost  And all the sweetness of their tone was lost  At length fair Italy luxuriant land  Where Art's rich flowers in earliest bloom expand  Thy daring DANTE his wild Vision sung  Ver See NOTE IV  And rais'd to Epic pomp his native Tongue  Down Arno's stream his newform'd music floats  The proud vale echoing with his Tuscan notes  See the bold Bard now sink and now ascend  Wherever Thought can pierce or Life extend  In his wide circuit from Hell's drear abyss  Thro' purifying scenes to realms of perfect bliss  He seems begirt with all that airy throng  Who brighten or debase the Poet's song  Sublimest Fancy now directs his march  To opening worlds through that infernal arch  O'er whose rough summit aweful words are read  That freeze each entering soul with hopeless dread  Now at her bidding his strong numbers flow  And rend the heart at Ugolino's woe  While Nature's glorygiving tear bedews  A tale unrivall'd by the Grecian Muse  Now to those notes that milder grief inspire  Pathetic Tenderness attunes his lyre  Which soft as murmurs of the plaintive dove  Tells the sad issue of illicit love  But all the worse conpanions of his way  Soon into different sounds his ductile voice betray  Satiric Fury now appears his guide  Thro' thorny paths of Enmity and Pride  Now quaint Conceit his wand'ring steps misleads  Thro' all the hideous forms that Folly breeds  Now Priestly Dullness the lost Bard enshrouds  In cold confusion and scholastic clouds  Unequal Spirit in thy various strain  With all their influence Light and Darkness reign  In thy strange Verse and wayward Theme alike  New forms of Beauty and Disorder strike  Extremes of Harmony and Discord dwell  The Seraph's music and the Demon's yell  The patient Reader to thy merit just  With transport glows and shudders with disgust  Thy Failings sprung from thy disastrous time  Thy stronger Beauties from a soul sublime  Whose vigor burst like the volcano's flame  From central darkness to the sphere of fame  Of gentler mind and with a heart to feel  The fondest warmth of emulative zeal  Thy festive Scholar who ador'd thy Lays  And grac'd thy Genius with no scanty praise  The gay BOCCACIO tempts th' Italian Muse  Ver See NOTE V  More varied notes and different themes to chuse  Themes which her voice had dar'd not yet to found  Valour's heroic feats by Beauty crown'd  Sweet was the glowing Song but strange to tell  On his bold lyre Oblivion's shadows fell  His richer Tales engross'd the World's regard  And the bright Novelist eclips'd the Bard  In following ages when Italia's shore  Blaz'd with the rising light of Classic lore  Stern System led from her newfounded school  A Poet fashion'd by her rigid rule  Behold my Son his sapient Tut'ress cried  Who throws the bonds of Gothic rhyme aside  For whom these hands the Grecian Lyre new strung  She spoke exulting and TRISSINO sung  Ver See NOTE VI  In his cold Verse he kept her Critic laws  While Pedants own'd their pow'r and yawn'd applause  Indignant Fancy who with scorn survey'd  The sleepy honors to proud System paid  Smiling to see that on her rival's brow  The Poppy lurk'd beneath the Laurel bough  Resolv'd in sportive triumph to display  The rich extent of her superior sway  From Necromancy's hand in happiest hour  She caught the rod of visionary power  And as aloft the magic wand she rais'd  A peerless Bard with new effulgence blaz'd  Born every law of System to disown  And rule by Fancy's boundless power alone  High in mid air between the Moon and Earth  The Bard of Pathos now and now of Mirth  Pois'd with his lyre between a Griffin's wings  Her sportive darling ARIOSTO sings  As the light cloud whose varying vapors fly  Driven by the zephyr of the evening sky  Fixes and charms the neverwearied view  By taking every shape and every hue  So by Variety's supreme controul  His changeful numbers seize the willing soul  Enchanted by his Song Attention fits  With features catching every cast by fits  Like the fond infant in whose tender brain  Young Sensibility delights to reign  While rapid Joy and Pain each other chase  Thro' the soft muscles of its April face  In vain the slaves of System would discard  From Glory's classic train this airy Bard  Delighted Nature her gay fav'rite crown'd  And Envy's clamour in her plaudit drown'd  Severe Morality to censure mov'd  His wanton Lyre with juster blame reprov'd  But his sweet Song her anger so beguil'd  That ere she finish'd her reproof she smil'd  Of chaster fire a rival name succeeds  Whose bold and glowing hand Religion leads  In solemn accent and in sacred state  With classic lore and Christian zeal elate  Sweetly pathetic and sublimely strong  TASSO begins his more majestic song  The Muse of Sion not implor'd in vain  Guides to th' impassion'd soul his heavenly strain  Blush BOILEAU blush and for that pride atone  Which slander'd Genius far above thy own  And thou great injur'd Bard thy station claim  Amid the Demigods of Epic name  Heir to a mantle by the Muses spun  Of a poetic Sire the more poetic Son  Ver See NOTE VII  Nor tho' just Fame her richer palm devote  To the highsounding lyre of serious note  Shall gay TASSONI want his festive crown  Ver See NOTE VIII  Who banish'd from the Muse her aweful frown  And tuning to light themes her lofty style  O'er her grave features spread a comic smile  Such various Sons of Epic fire possest  Italia foster'd on her feeling breast  Spain whose bold genius with misjudging pride  O'ersteps true glory by too large a stride  Claims higher merit from one Poet's birth  Who rivals all the different Bards of earth  With more than Niobe's parental boast  She calls her single Son himself an Host  And rashly judges that her VEGA's lyre  Ver See NOTE IX  Is equal to the whole Aonian quire  Impetuous Poet whose full brain supplied  Such floods of Verse and in so quick a tide  Their rapid swell by its unrivall'd height  Pleas'd yet produc'd more wonder than delight  Tho' thy free rhyme from Fancy's fountain gush  And with the grandeur of the torrent rush  Its troubled streams in dark disorder roam  With all the torrent's noise and all its foam  To Emulation fir'd by TASSO's strain  Thy spirit quitted the dramatic plain  To seek those Epic heights sublimely calm  Whence he had pluck'd his Idumean palm  But vainly struggling in a task too hard  Sunk at the feet of that superior Bard  Brave Spaniard still thy wounded pride console  Time shall not strike thy name from Glory's roll  On which thy generous and fraternal hand  Emblaz'd each brother of thy tuneful band  Thy Muse shall share the praise she joy'd to give  And while thy language lasts thy fame shall live  Perchance tho' strange the paradox may seem  That fame had risen with a brighter beam  Had radiant Fancy less enrich'd thy mind  Her lavish wealth for wiser use design'd  Ruin'd the Poet by its splendid lure  As India's mines have made his country poor  With warmth more temperate and in notes more clear  That with Homeric richness fill the ear  The brave ERCILLA sounds with potent breath  Ver See NOTE X  His Epic trumpet in the fields of death  In scenes of savage war when Spain unfurl'd  Her bloody banners o'er the western world  With all his Country's virtues in his frame  Without the base alloy that stain'd her name  In Danger's camp this military Bard  Whom Cynthia saw on his nocturnal guard  Recorded in his bold descriptive lay  The various fortune of the finish'd day  Seizing the pen while Night's calm hours afford  A transient slumber to his satiate sword  With noble justice his warm hand bestows  The meed of Honor on his valiant foes  Howe'er precluded by his generous aim  From high pretensions to inventive fame  His stronglycolour'd scenes of sanguine strife  His softer pictures caught from Indian life  Above the visionary forms of art  Fire the awaken'd mind and melt the heart  Tho' fiercest tribes her galling fetters drag  Proud Spain must strike to Lusitania's flag  Whose ampler folds in conscious triumph spread  Wave o'er her NAVAL POET's laureate head  Ye Nymphs of Tagus from your golden cell  That caught the echo of his tuneful shell  Rise and to deck your darling's shrine provide  The richest treasures that the deep may hide  From every land let grateful Commerce shower  Her tribute to the Bard who sung her power  As those rich gales from whence his GAMA caught  A pleasing earnest of the prize he sought  The balmy fragrance of the East dispense  So steals his Song on the delighted sense  Astonishing with sweets unknown before  Those who ne'er tasted but of classic lore  Immortal Bard thy name with GAMA vies  Thou like thy Hero with propitious skies  The sail of bold adventure hast unfurl'd  And in the Epic ocean found a world  'Twas thine to blend the Eagle and the Dove  At once the Bard of Glory and of Love  Ver See NOTE XI  Thy thankless Country heard thy varying lyre  To PETRARCH's Softness melt and swell to HOMER's Fire  Boast and lament ungrateful land a Name  In life in death thy honor and thy shame  Thou nobler realm whom vanity betrays  To load thy letter'd sons with lavish praise  Where Eulogy with one eternal smile  Ver See NOTE XII  Heaps her faint roses in a withering pile  A City milkmaid on the first of May  Who pertly civil and absurdly gay  Forms her dull garland in fantastic state  With illadjusted flow'rs and borrow'd plate  Canst thou selfflattering France with justice vaunt  One Epic laurel as thy native plant  How oft a Gallic hand with childish fire  Has rattled Discord on th' heroic lyre  While their dull aid associate Critics bring  And vainly teach the use of every string  In Morals as with many an empty boast  They practise virtue least who preach it most  So haughty Gallia in thy Epic school  No great Examples rise but many a Rule  Ver See NOTE XIII  Yet tho' unjust to TASSO's nobler lays  Keen BOILEAU shall not want his proper praise  Ver See NOTE XIV  He archly waving his satiric rod  Thro' the new path which first TASSONI trod  Pursued his sportive march in happy hour  And pluck'd from Satire's thorn a festive flower  His sacerdotal War shall wake delight  And smiles in Gravity herself excite  While Canons live to quarrel or to feast  And gall can tinge the spirit of a Priest  Nor gentle GRESSET shall thy sprightly rhyme  Ver See NOTE XV  Cease to enchant the list'ning ear of Time  In thee the Graces all their powers instill  To touch the Epic chords with playful skill  The hapless Parrot whom thy lays endear  In piety and woe the Trojan's peer  His heart as tender and his love more pure  Shall like Aeneas live of fame secure  While female hands with many a tender word  Stroke the soft feathers of their fav'rite bird  Yet not in childish sport or trifling joy  Do Gallic Fairones all their hours employ  See lovely BOCCAGE in ambition strong  Ver See NOTE XVI  Build with aspiring aim her Epic Song  By Glory fir'd her rosy lips rehearse  Thy feats Columbus in unborrow'd Verse  If this new Muse in War's dire field displays  No Grecian splendor no Homeric blaze  Attractive still tho' not in pomp array'd  She charms like Zama in her Verse portray'd  Whose form from dress no gorgeous pride assumes  Clad in a simple zone of azure plumes  England's dear guest this Muse of Gallia caught  From our inspiring Isle her ardent thought  Here first she strove to reach with vent'rous hope  MILTON's chaste grandeur and the grace of POPE  And sweetly taught in her mimetic strain  The Songs of Britain to the Banks of Seine  But see with wounded Pride's indignant glance  The angry Genius of presuming France  From ancient shrines their Epic wreaths would tear  To swell the glory of her great VOLTAIRE  Ver See NOTE XVII  O form'd in Learning's various paths to shine  Encircled from thy birth by all the Nine  On thee blest Bard these rivals seem'd to shower  Their various attributes and blended power  But when their lofty leader bade thee frame  The rich Heroic song on Henry's fame  Sarcastic Humour trifling with her lyre  Took from th' inspiring Muse her solemn fire  No more her spirit like the Eagle springs  Or rides the buoyant air with balanc'd wings  Tho' rapid still to narrow circuits bound  She like the darting Swallow skims the ground  Thy Verse displays beneath an Epic name  Wit's flinty Spark for Fancy's solar Flame  While yet thy hand the Epic chords embrac'd  With playful spirit and with frolic haste  Such lively sounds thy rapid fingers drew  And thro' the festive notes so lightly flew  Nature and Fancy join'd their charms to swell  And laughing Humour crown'd thy new Pucelle  But the chaste Muses startled at the sound  Amid thy sprightly numbers blush'd and frown'd  With decent anger and becoming pride  Severer Virtue threw the Song aside  While Justice own'd it with a kinder glance  The wittiest Levity of wanton France  Now graver Britain amiably severe  To thee with native zeal to thee I steer  My vent'rous bark its foreign circuit o'er  Exulting springs to thy parental shore  Thou gorgeous Queen who on thy silvery coast  Sittest encircled by a filial host  And seest thy sons the jewels of thy crown  Blaze with each varying ray of rich renown  If with just love I hold their Genius dear  Lament their hardships and their fame revere  O bid thy Epic Muse with honour due  Range her departed Champions in my view  See on a partycolour'd steed of fire  With Humour at his side his trusty Squire  Gay CHAUCER leadsin form a Knight of old  And his strong armour is of steel and gold  But o'er it age a cruel rust has spread  And made the brilliant metals dark as lead  Now gentle SPENSER Fancy's fav'rite Bard  Awakes my wonder and my fond regard  Encircling Fairies bear in sportive dance  His adamantine shield and magic lance  While Allegory drest with mystic art  Appears his Guide but promising to dart  A lambent glory round her list'ning Son  She hides him in the web herself has spun  Ingenuous COWLEY the fond dupe of Wit  Seems like a vapour o'er the field to flit  In David's praise he strikes some Epic notes  But soon down Lethe's stream their dying murmur floats  While COWLEY vanish'd in an amorous riddle  Up rose the frolic Bard of Bear and Fiddle  His smile exhilarates the sullen earth  Adorning Satire in the mask of Mirth  Taught by his Song Fanatics cease their jars  And wise Astrologers renounce the Stars  Unrivall'd BUTLER blest with happy skill  To heal by comic verse each serious ill  By Wit's strong flashes Reason's light dispense  And laugh a frantic nation into sense  Apart and on a sacred hill retir'd  Beyond all mortal inspiration fir'd  The mighty MILTON sitsan host around  Of list'ning Angels guard the holy ground  Amaz'd they see a human form aspire  To grasp with daring hand a Seraph's lyre  Inly irradiate with celestial beams  Attempt those high those soulsubduing themes  Which humbler Denizens of Heaven decline  And celebrate with sanctity divine  The starry field from warring Angels won  And God triumphant in his Victor Son  Nor less the wonder and the sweet delight  His milder scenes and softer notes excite  When at his bidding Eden's blooming grove  Breathes the rich sweets of Innocence and Love  With such pure joy as our Forefather knew  When Raphael heavenly guest first met his view  And our glad Sire within his blissful bower  Drank the pure converse of th' aetherial Power  Round the blest Bard his raptur'd audience throng  And feel their souls imparadis'd in song  Of humbler mien but not of mortal race  Illfated DRYDEN with Imperial grace  Gives to th' obedient lyre his rapid laws  Tones yet unheard with touch divine he draws  The melting fall the rising swell sublime  And all the magic of melodious rhyme  See with proud joy Imagination spread  A wreath of honor round his aged head  But two base Spectres tho' of different hue  The Bard unhappy in his march pursue  Two vile disgraceful Fiends of race accurst  Conceiv'd by Spleen by meagre Famine nurst  Malignant Satire mercenary Praise  Shed their dark spots on his immortal bays  Poor DAVENANT march'd before with nobler aim  His keen eye fixt upon the palm of Fame  But cruel Fortune doom'd him to rehearse  A Theme illchosen in illchosen Verse  Next came Sir RICHARD but in woeful plight  DRYDEN's Ledhorse first threw the luckless Knight  He rose advent'rous stillO who may count  How oft he tried a different Steed to mount  Each angry steed his awkward rider flung  Undaunted still he fell and falling sung  But Aesculapius who with grief distrest  Beheld his offspring made a public jest  Soon bade a livelier Son with mirth efface  The shame he suffer'd from Sir RICHARD's case  Swift at the word his sprightly GARTH began  To make an  And his high helmet was a Closestool Pan  DISPENSARY  helmet of a Closestool Pan  An Urinal he for his trumpet takes  And at each blast he blows see Laughter shakes  Yet peacenew music floats on Aether's wings  Say is it Harmony herself who sings  No while enraptur'd Sylphs the Song inspire  'Tis POPE who sweetly wakes the silver lyre  To melting notes more musically clear  Than Ariel whisper'd in Belinda's ear  Too soon he quits them for a sharper tone  See him tho' form'd to fill the Epic throne  Decline the sceptre of that wide domain  To bear a Lictor's rod in Satire's train  And shrouded in a mist of moral spleen  Ver See NOTE XVIII  Behold him close the visionary scene  END OF THE THIRD EPISTLE  EPISTLE THE FOURTH  ARGUMENT OF THE FOURTH EPISTLE  Remarks on the supposed Parsimony of Nature in bestowing Poetic GeniusThe Evils and the Advantages of Poetry exemplified in the Fate of different Poets  AN ESSAY ON EPIC POETRY  EPISTLE IV  SAY generous Power benignant Nature say  Who temp'rest with thy touch our human clay  Warming the fields of Thought with genial care  The various fruits of mental growth to bear  Shall not thy vot'ries glow with just disdain  When Sloth or Spleen thy bounteous hand arraign  Art thou the Niggard they pretend thou art  A grudging Parent with a Stepdame's heart  And dost thou shed with rare reluctant toil  Bright Fancy's germens in the mental soil  Is Genius thy sweet Plant of richest power  Whose dearlypriz'd and longexpected flower  More tardy than the Aloe's bloom appears  Ordain'd to blow but in a thousand years  Perish the sickly thoughtlet those who hold  Thy quick'ning influence so coy so cold  Calmly the habitable earth survey  From time's first aera to the passing day  In what rude clime beneath what angry skies  Have plants Poetic never dar'd to rise  In torrid regions where 'tis toil to think  Where souls in stupid ease supinely sink  And where the native of the desert drear  Yields to blank darkness half his icy year  In these unfriendly scenes where each extreme  Of heat and cold forbids the mind to teem  Poetic blossoms into Being start  Spontaneous produce of the feeling heart  Can we then deem that in those happier lands  Where every vital energy expands  Where Thought the golden harvest of the mind  Springs into rich luxuriance unconfin'd  That in such soils with mental weeds o'ergrown  The seeds of Poesy were thinly sown  Shall we deny the labor of the swain  Who to the cultur'd earth confides the grain  If all the vagrant harpies of the air  From its new bed the pregnant treasure tear  If when scarce rising with a stem infirm  It dies the victim of the mining worm  If mildew riding in the eastern gust  Turns all its ripening gold to sable dust  These foes combin'd and with them who may cope  Are not more hostile to the Farmer's hope  Than Life's keen passions to that lighter grain  Of Fancy scatter'd o'er the infant brain  Pleasure the rambling Bird the painted Jay  May snatch the richest seeds of Verse away  Or Indolence the worm that winds with art  Thro' the close texture of the cleanest heart  May if they haply have begun to shoot  With partial mischief wound the sick'ning root  Or Avarice the mildew of the soul  May sweep the mental field and blight the whole  Nay the meek errors of the modest mind  To its own vigor diffidently blind  And that cold spleen which falsely has declar'd  The powers of Nature and of Art impair'd  The gate that Genius has unclos'd may guard  And rivet to the earth the rising Bard  For who will quit tho' from mean aims exempt  The cares that summon and the joys that tempt  In many a lonely studious hour to try  Where latent springs of Poesy may lie  Who will from social ease his mind divorce  To prove in Art's wide field its secret force  If blind to Nature's frank parental love  He deems that Verse descended from above  Like Heaven's more sacred signs whose time is o'er  A gift miraculous conferr'd no more  O Prejudice thou bane of Arts thou pest  Whose ruffian powers the freeborn soul arrest  Thou who dethroning Reason dar'st to frame  And issue thy proud laws beneath her name  Thou Coaster on the intellectual deep  Ordering each timid bark thy course to keep  Who lest some daring mind beyond thee steer  Hast rais'd to vouch thy vanity and fear  Herculean pillars where thy sail was furl'd  And nam'd thy bounds the Limits of the World  Thou braggart Prejudice how oft thy breath  Has doom'd young Genius to the shades of death  How often has thy voice with brutal fire  Forbidding Female hands to touch the lyre  Deny'd to Woman Nature's fav'rite child  The right to enter Fancy's opening wild  Blest be this smiling hour when Britain sees  Her Fairones cancel such absurd decrees  In one harmonious group with graceful scorn  Spring o'er the Pedant's fence of wither'd thorn  And reach Parnassian heights where laurelcrown'd  This softer Quire the notes of triumph sound  Where SEWARD leader of the lovely train  Pours o'er heroic tombs her potent strain  Potent to sooth the honor'd dead and dart  Congenial virtue thro' each panting heart  Potent thro' spirits masculine to spread  Poetic jealousy and envious dread  If Love and Envy could in union rest  And rule with blended sway a Poet's breast  The Bards of Britain with unjaundic'd eyes  Will glory to behold such rivals rise  Proceed ye Sisters of the tuneful Shell  Ver See NOTE I  Without a scruple in that Art excel  Which reigns by virtuous Pleasure's soft controul  In sweet accordance with the Female soul  Pure as yourselves and like your charms design'd  To bless the earth and humanize mankind  Where'er that Parent of engaging thought  Warm Sensibility like light has taught  The bright'ning mirror of the mind to shew  Nature's reflected forms in all their glow  Where in full tides the fine affections roll  And the warm heart invigorates the soul  In that rich spot where winds propitious blow  Culture may teach poetic Fame to grow  Refin'd Invention and harmonious Rhyme  Are the slow gifts of Study and of Time  But to the Bard whom all the Muses court  His Sports are study and his Studies sport  E'en at this period when all

Invective's edge  Say can the Muse no just defence alledge  In striking contrast has she not to paint  Her prosp'rous Hero as her murder'd Saint  'Tis true she oft has fruitless vigils kept  And oft

still shines above  Each perishable mark of Royal Love  If humbler views the tuneful mind inflame  If to be rich can be a Poet's aim  The Muse may shew but in a different clime  Wealth the fair

on Fortune's glittering wings  And almost reach the opulence of Kings  The highsoul'd Nobles of his native land  Enrich their Poet with so frank a hand  For him Pieria's rock with treasure teems  For

distant fame illuminates his soul  Too oft the wealthy to proud follies born  Have turn'd from letter'd Poverty with scorn  Dull Opulence thy narrow joys enlarge  To shield weak Merit is thy noblest charge  Search the dark scenes where drooping Genius lies  And keep from sorriest sights a nation's eyes  That from expiring Want's reproaches free  Our generous country may ne'er weep to see  A future CHATTERTON by poison dead  An OTWAY fainting for a little bread  If deaths like these deform'd our native isle  Some English Bards have bask'd in fortune's smile  Alike in Station and in Genius

from its worst disease  From mean Dependance bright Ambition's bane  Which blushing Fancy strives to hide in vain  To POPE the titled Patron joy'd to bend  Still more ennobled when proclaim'd his friend  For him the hands of jarring Faction join  To heap their tribute on his HOMER's shrine  Proud of the frank reward his talents find  And nobly conscious of no venal mind  With the just world his fair account he clears  And owns no debt to Princes or to Peers  Yet while our nation feels new thirst arise  For that pure joy which Poesy supplies  Bards whom the tempting Muse enlists by stealth  Perceive their path is not the road to wealth  To honorable wealth young Labor's spoil  The due reward of no inglorious toil  Whose wellearn'd comforts noblest minds engage  The just asylum of declining age  Else had we seen a warm Poetic Youth  Change Fiction's roses for the thorns of Truth  From Fancy's realm his native field withdraw  To pay hard homage to severer Law  O thou bright Spirit whom the Asian Muse  Had fondly steep'd in all her fragrant dews  And o'er whose early Song that mental feast  She breath'd the sweetness of the rifled East  Since independant Honor's high controul  Detach'd from Poesy thy ardent soul  To seek with better hopes Persuasion's seat  Blest be those hopes and happy that retreat  Which with regret all British Bards must see  And mourn a Brother lost in losing thee  Nor leads the Poet's path to that throng'd gate  Where crouching Priests on proud Preferment wait  Where while in vain a thousand vot'ries fawn  She robes her fav'rite few

Pathetic MASON with just pride declare  Thy breast must feel a more exulting fire  Than Pomp can give or Dignity inspire  When Nature tells thee that thy Verse imparts  The thrill of pleasure to ten

gratitude for joy refin'd  Gift of thy Genius to the feeling mind  These are the honors which the Muse confers  The radiant Crown of living light is her's  And on thy brow she gave those gems to blaze  That far outshine the Mitre's transient rays  Gems that shall mock malignant Envy's breath  And shine still brighter thro' the shades of death  For me who feel whene'er I touch the lyre  My talents sink below my proud desire  Who often doubt and sometimes credit give  When Friends assure me that my Verse will live  Whom health too tender for the bustling throng  Led into pensive shade and

Peace and social Pleasure springs  And Friendship dearer than the smile of Kings  While keener Poets querulously proud  Lament the Ills of Poesy aloud  And magnify with Irritation's zeal  Those common

sigh'd in numbers or he laugh'd in rhyme  While thy kind cautions warn'd him to beware  Of Penury the Bard's perpetual snare  Marking the early temper of his soul  Careless of wealth nor fit for base

fairer image in his brain  To blank confusion and her crazy train  'Twas thine with constant love thro' ling'ring years  To bathe thy Idiot Orphan in thy tears  Day after day and night succeeding night  To turn incessant to the hideous sight  And frequent watch if haply at thy view  Departed Reason might not dawn anew  Tho' medicinal art with pitying care  Cou'd lend no aid to save thee from despair  Thy fond maternal heart adher'd to Hope and Prayer  Nor pray'd in vain thy child from Pow'rs above  Receiv'd the sense to feel and bless thy love  O might he thence receive the happy skill  And force proportion'd to his ardent will  With Truth's unfading radiance to emblaze  Thy virtues worthy of immortal praise  Nature who deck'd thy form with Beauty's flowers  Exhausted on thy soul her finer powers  Taught it with all her energy to feel  Love's melting softness Friendship's fervid zeal  The generous purpose and the active thought  With Charity's diffusive spirit fraught  There all the best of mental gifts she plac'd  Vigor of Judgment purity of Taste  Superior parts without their spleenful leaven  Kindness to Earth and confidence in Heaven  While my fond thoughts o'er all thy merits roll  Thy praise thus gushes from my filial soul  Nor will the Public with harsh rigor blame  This my just homage to thy honor'd name  To please that Public if to please be mine  Thy Virtues train'd melet the praise be thine  Since thou hast reach'd that world where Love alone  Where Love Parental can exceed thy own  If in celestial realms the blest may know  And aid the objects of their care below  While in this sublunary scene of strife  Thy Son possesses frail and feverish life  If Heaven allot him many an added hour  Gild it with virtuous thought and mental power  Power to exalt

the great desideratum in English literatureThe Author's wish of seeing it supplied by the genius of Mr MASON  AN ESSAY ON EPIC POETRY  EPISTLE V  ILLFATED Poesy as human worth  Prais'd yet unaided often sinks to earth  So sink thy powers not doom'd alone to know  Scorn or neglect from an unfeeling foe  But destin'd more oppressive wrong to feel  From the misguided Friend's perplexing zeal  Such Friends are those who in their proud display  Of thy young beauty and thy early sway  Pretend thou'rt robb'd of all thy warmth sublime  By the benumbing touch of modern Time  What is the Epic Muse that lofty Fair  Who makes the discipline of Earth her care  That mighty Minister whom Virtue leads  To train the noblest minds to noblest deeds  Is she in office great in glory rich  Degraded to a poor pretended Witch  Who rais'd her spells and all her magic power  But on the folly of the favoring hour  Whose dark despis'd illusions melt away  At the clear dawn of Philosophic day  To such they sink her who lament her fall  From the high Synod of th' Olympian Hall  Who worship System hid in Fancy's veil  And think that all her Epic force must fail  If she no more can borrow or create  Celestial Agents to uphold her state  To prove if this fam'd doctrine may be found  To rest on solid or on sandy ground  Let Critic Reason all her light diffuse  O'er the wide empire of this injur'd Muse  To guide our search to every varied source  And separate sinew of her vital force  To three prime powers within the human frame  With equal energy she points her aim  By pure exalted Sentiment she draws  From Judgment's steady voice no light applause  By Nature's simple and pathetic strains  The willing homage of the Heart she gains  The precious tribute she receives from these  Shines undebas'd by changing Time's decrees  The noble thought that fir'd a Grecian soul  Keeps o'er a British mind its firm controul  The scenes where Nature seems herself to speak  Still touch a Briton as they touch'd a Greek  To captivate admiring Fancy's eyes  She bids celestial decorations rise  But as a playful and capricious child  Frowns at the splendid toy on which it smil'd  So wayward Fancy now with scorn surveys  Those specious Miracles she lov'd to praise  Still fond of change and fickle Fashion's dupe  Now keen to soar and eager now to stoop  Her Gods Dev'ls Saints Magicians rise and fall  And now she worships each now laughs at all  If then within the rich and wide domain  O'er which the Epic Muse delights to reign  One province weaker than the rest be found  'Tis her Celestial Sphere or Fairy Ground  Her realm of Marvels is the distant land  O'er which she holds a perilous command  For plac'd beyond the reach of Nature's aid  Here her worst foes her tottering force invade  O'er the wide precinct proud Opinion towers  And withers with a look its alter'd powers  While lavish Ridicule pert Child of Taste  Turns the rich confine to so poor a waste  That some who deem it but a cumbrous weight  Would lop this Province from its Parent State  What mighty voice first spoke this wond'rous law  Which ductile Critics still repeat with awe  That man's unkindling spirit must refuse  A generous plaudit to th' Heroic Muse  Howe'er she paint her scenes of manly life  If no superior Agents aid the strife  In days of courtly wit and wanton mirth  The loose PETRONIUS gave the maxim birth  Ver See NOTE I  Perchance to sooth the envious Nero's ear  And sink the Bard whose fame he sigh'd to hear  To injure LUCAN whose advent'rous mind  Inflam'd by Freedom with just scorn resign'd  Th' exhausted fables of the starry pole  And found a nobler theme in CATO's soul  To wound him in the mask of Critic art  The subtle Courtier launch'd this venom'd dart  And following Critics fond of Classic lore  Still echo the vain law from shore to shore  On Poets still for Deities they call  And deem mere earthly Bards no Bards at all  Yet if by fits the mighty HOMER nods  Where sinks he more than with his sleepy Gods  E'en LUCAN proves by his immortal name  How weak the dagger levell'd at his fame  For in his Song which Time will ne'er forget  If Taste who much may praise will much regret  'Tis not the absence of th' Olympian state  Embroil'd by jarring Gods in coarse debate  'Tis nice arrangement Nature's easy air  In scenes unfolded with superior care  'Tis softer diction elegantly terse  And the fine polish of Virgilian Verse  O blind to Nature who assert the Muse  Must o'er the human frame her empire lose  Failing to fly in Fancy's wild career  Above this visible diurnal sphere  Behold yon pensive Fair who turns with grief  The tender Novel's soulpossessing leaf  Why with moist eyes to those soft pages glu'd  Forgetting her fix'd hours of sleep and food  Why does she keenly grasp its precious woes  Nor quit the volume till the story close  'Tis not that Fancy plays her revels there  Cheating the mind with lucid forms of air  'Tis not that Passion in a style impure  Holds the warm spirit by a wanton lure  'Tis suffering Virtue's sympathetic sway  That all the fibres of her breast obey  'Tis Action where Immortals claim no part  'Tis Nature grappled to the human heart  If this firm Sov'reign of the feeling breast  Can thus the fascinated thought arrest  And thro' the bosom's deep recesses pierce  Ungrac'd unaided by enchanting Verse  Say shall we think with limited controul  She wants sufficient force to seize the soul  When Harmony's congenial tones convey  Charms to her voice that aid its magic sway  If Admiration's hand with eager grasp  Her darling HOMER's deathless volume clasp  Say to what scenes her partial eyes revert  Say what they first explore and last desert  The scenes that glitter with no heavenly blaze  Where human agents human feelings raise  While Truth enamor'd of the lovely line  Cries to their parent Nature "These are thine"  When Neptune rises in Homeric state  And on their Lord the Powers of Ocean wait  Tho' pliant Fancy trace the steps he trod  And with a transient worship own the God  Yet colder readers with indifference view  The Sovereign of the deep and all his vassal crew  Nor feel his watery pomp their mind enlarge  More than the pageant of my Lord May'r's barge  But when Achilles' wrongs our eyes engage  All bosoms burn with sympathetic rage  And when thy love parental Chief of Troy  Hastes to relieve the terrors of thy boy  Our senses in thy fond emotion join  And every heart's in unison with thine  Still in the Muse's ear shall Echo ring  That heavenly Agents are her vital spring  Those who conclude her winning charms arise  From Beings darting from the distant skies  Appear to cherish a conceit as vain  As once was harbour'd in Neanthus' brain  When he believ'd that harmony must dwell  In the cold concave of the Orphic shell  The ancient Lyre to which the Thracian sung  Whose hallow'd chords were in a temple hung  The shallow Youth with weak ambition sought  And of the pilfering Priest the relique bought  Viewing his treasure with deluded gaze  He deem'd himself the heir of Orphic praise  But when his awkward fingers tried to bring  Expected music from the silent string  Not e'en the milder brutes his discord bore  But howling dogs the fancied Orpheus tore  Ver See NOTE II  When the true Poet in whose frame are join'd  Softness of Heart and Energy of Mind  His Epic scene's expansive limit draws  Faithful to Nature's universal laws  If thro' her various walks he boldly range  Marking how oft her pliant features change  If as she teaches his quick powers supply  Successive pictures to th' astonish'd eye  Where noblest passions noblest deeds inspire  And radiant souls exhibit all their fire  Where softer forms their sweet attractions blend  And suffering Beauty makes the world her friend  If thus he build his Rhyme with varied art  On each dear interest of the human heart  His genius by no vain conceits betray'd  May spurn faint Allegory's feeble aid  Th' Heroic Muse in earthly virtue strong  May drive the host of Angels from her Song  As her fair Sister Muse the Tragic Queen  Has banish'd Ghosts from her pathetic scene  Tho' her high soul by SHAKESPEARE's magic sway'd  Still bends to buried Denmark's aweful Shade  If we esteem this Epic Queen so great  To spare her heavenly train yet keep her state  'Tis not our aim with systematic pride  To sink their glory or their powers to hide  Who add when folded in the Muse's arms  Celestial beauty to her earthly charms  Sublimely fashion'd by no mortal hands  The dome of mental Pleasure wide expands  Form'd to preside o'er its allotted parts  At different portals stand the separate Arts  But every portal different paths may gain  Alike uniting in the mystic Fane  Contentious mortals on these paths debate  Some wrangling on the road ne'er reach the gate  While others arm'd with a despotic rod  Allow no pass but what themselves have trod  The noblest spirits to this foible prone  Have slander'd powers congenial with their own  Hence on a Brother's genius MILTON frown'd  Scorning the graceful chains of final sound  And to one form confin'd the free sublime  Insulting DRYDEN as the Man of Rhyme  Caprice still gives this lasting struggle life  Rhyme and Blank Verse maintain their idle strife  The friends of one are still the other's foes  For stubborn Prejudice no mercy knows  As in Religion Zealots blindly warm  Neglect the Essence while they grasp the Form  Poetic Bigots thus perversely wrong  Think Modes of Verse comprize the Soul of Song  If the fine Statuary fill his part  With all the powers of energetic Art  If to the figures that with skill exact  His genius blends in one impassion'd act  If to this Group such speaking force he give  That startled Nature almost cries "They live"  All tongues with zeal th' enchanting work applaud  Nor the great Artist of due praise defraud  Whether he form'd the rich expressive mass  Of Parian marble or Corinthian brass  For each his powers might fashion to fulfil  The noblest purpose of mimetic skill  Each from his soul might catch Promethean fire  And speak his talents till the world expire  'Tis thus that MILTON's Verse and DRYDEN's Rhyme  Are proof alike against the rage of Time  Each Master modell'd with a touch so bold  The rude materials which he chose to mould  That each his portion to perfection brought  Accomplishing the glorious end he sought  False to themselves and to their interest blind  Are those cold judges of fastidious mind  Who with vain rules the suffering Arts would load  Who ere they smile consult the Critic's code  Where puzzled by the different doubts they see  For who so oft as Critics disagree  They lose that pleasure by free spirits seiz'd  In vainly settling how they should be pleas'd  Far wiser those who with a generous joy  Nor blindly fond nor petulantly coy  Follow each movement of the varying Muse  Whatever step her airy form may chuse  Nor to one march her rapid feet confine  Whilee ase and spirit in her gesture join  Those who facilitate her free desire  To melt the heart or set the soul on fire  Who if her voice to simple Nature lean  And fill with Human forms her Epic scene  Pleas'd with her aim assist her moral plan  And feel with manly sympathy for Man  Or if she draw by Fancy's magic tones  Aetherial Spirits from their sapphire thrones  Her Heavenly shapes with willing homage greet  And aid with ductile thought her bright deceit  For if the Epic Muse still wish to tower  Above plain Nature's firm and graceful power  Tho' Critics think her vital powers are lost  In cold Philosophy's petrific frost  That Magic cannot her sunk charms restore  That Heaven and Hell can yield her nothing more  Yet may she dive to many a secret source  And copious spring of visionary force  India yet holds a Mythologic mine  Her strength may open and her art refine  Tho' Asian spoils the realms of Europe fill  Those Eastern

VERSE  SUCH dark decrees have letter'd Bigots penn'd  Yet seiz'd that honor'd name the Poet's Friend    Of the several authors who have written on Epic Poetry many of the most celebrated are more likely to confound and depress than to enlighten and exalt the young Poetical Student The Poetics of Scaliger which are little more than a laboured panegyric of Virgil would lead him to regard the Aeneid as the only standard of  perfection and the more elegant and accomplished Vida inculcates the same pusillanimous lesson though in spirited and harmonious verse  Unus hic ingenio praestanti gentis Achivae  Divinos vates longè superavit et arte  Aureus immortale sonans stupet ipsa pavetque  Quamvis ingentem miretur Graecia Homerum  Ergo ipsum ante alios animo venerare Maronem  Atque unum sequere utque potes vestigia serva  VIDA  See how the Grecian Bards at distance thrown  With reverence bow to this distinguish'd son  Immortal sounds his golden lines impart  And nought can match his Genius but his Art  E'en Greece turns pale and trembles at his fame  Which shades the lustre of her Homer's name  Hence sacred Virgil from thy soul adore  Above the rest and to thy utmost power  Pursue the glorious paths he struck before  PITT's Translation  A Critic who lately rose to great eminence in our own country has endeavoured by a more singular method to damp the ardour of inventive Genius and to annihilate the hopes of all who would aspire to the praise of originality in this higher species of poetical composition He has attempted to establish a Triumvirate in the Epic world with a perpetuity of dominion Every reader who is conversant with modern criticism will perceive that I allude to the following passage in the famous Dissertation on the sixth Book of Virgil  "Just as Virgil rivalled Homer so Milton emulated both of them He found Homer possessed of the province of Morality Virgil of Politics and nothing left for him but that of Religion This he seized as aspiring to share with them in the government of the Poetic world and by means of the superior dignity of his subject hath gotten to the head of that Triumvirate which took so many ages in forming These are the three species of the Epic Poem for its largest sphere is  human action  which can be considered  but in a  moral  political or religious view and These the three  Makers  for each of their Poems was struck out at a heat and came to perfection from its first essay Here then the grand scene was closed and all farther improvements of the Epic at an end"  I apprehend that few critical remarks contain more  absurdity  to use the favourite expression of the author I have quoted than the preceding lines Surely Milton is himself a proof that  human action  is not the largest sphere of the Epic Poem and as to Virgil his most passionate admirers must allow that in subject and design he is much less of an original than Camoens or Lucan But such a critical statute of limitation if I may call it so is not less pernicious than absurd To disfigure the sphere of Imagination with these capricious and arbitrary zones is an injury to science Such Criticism instead of giving spirit and energy to the laudable ambition of a youthful Poet can only lead him to start like Macbeth at unreal mockery and to exclaim when he is invited  by Genius to the banquet  "The Table's full"  NOTE II VERSE  Thus at their banquets fabling Greeks rehearse  The fancied origin of sacred Verse    For this fable such as it is I am indebted to a passage in Athenaeus which the curious reader may find in the close of that fanciful and entertaining compiler page of Casaubon's edition  NOTE III VERSE  Why did the Epic Muse's silent lyre  Shrink from those feats that summon'd all her fire    I have ventured to suppose that Greece produced no worthy successor of Homer and that her exploits against the Persians were not celebrated by any Poet in a manner suitable to so sublime a subjectyet an author named Chaerilus is said to have recorded those triumphs of his country in  verse and to have pleased the Athenians so highly as to obtain from them a public and pecuniary reward He is supposed to have been a cotemporary of the historian Herodotus But from the general silence of the more early Greek writers concerning the merit of this Poet we may I think very fairly conjecture that his compositions were not many degrees superior to those of his unfortunate namesake who frequented the court of Alexander the Great and is said to have sung the exploits of his Sovereign on the curious conditions of receiving a piece of gold for every good verse and a box on the ear for every bad one The old Scholiast on Horace who has preserved this idle story concludes it by saying that the miserable Bard was beat to death in consequence of his contract Some eminent modern Critics have indeed attempted to vindicate the reputation of the more early Chaerilus who is supposed to be confounded both by Horace himself and afterwards by Scaliger with the Chaerilus rewarded  by Alexander Vossius  De Historicis Graecis  in particular appears a warm advocate in his behalf and appeals to various fragments of the ancient Bard preserved by Aristotle Strabo and others and to the testimony of Plutarch in his favour But on consulting the fragments he has referred to they rather fortify than remove my conjecture The scrap preserved by Aristotle in his Rhetoric is only half a verse and quoted without any commendation of its author The two citations in Strabo amount to little more The curious reader may also find in Athenaeus an Epitaph on Sardanapalus attributed to this Poet who is mentioned by the same author as peculiarly addicted to the grosser excesses of the tableLet us now return to that Chaerilus whom Horace has  "damn'd to everlasting fame"  The judicious and elegant Roman Satirist seems remarkably unjust in paying a compliment to the poetical judgment of his patron Augustus at the expence of the Macedonian hero Alexander appears to have possessed much  more poetical spirit and a higher relish for poetry than the coldblooded Octavius It is peculiarly unfair to urge his liberality to a poor Poet as a proof that he wanted critical discernment when he had himself so thoroughly vindicated the delicacy of his taste by the enthusiastic Bonmot That he had rather be the Thersites of Homer than the Achilles of Chaerilus  NOTE IV VERSE  When grave Bossu by System's studied laws  The Grecian Bard's ideal picture draws    Though Bossu is called  "the best explainer of Aristotle and one of the most learned and judicious of modern critics"  by a writer for whose opinions I have much esteem I cannot help thinking that his celebrated Essay on Epic Poetry is very ill calculated either to guide or to inspirit a young Poet The absurdity of his advice concerning the mode of forming the fable by chusing a moral inventing the incidents and then searching history for names to suit them has been sufficiently exposed and as to his leading  idea concerning the design of Homer in the composition of the Iliad and Odyssey I apprehend most poetical readers must feel that he is probably mistaken for it is a conjectural point and placed beyond the possibility of decision Perhaps few individuals differ more from each other in their modes of thinking by the force of education and of national manners than a modern French Critic and an early Poet of Greece yet the former will often pretend with the most decisive air to lay open the sensorium of an ancient Bard and to count every link in the chain of his ideas Those who are most acquainted with the movements of imagination will acknowledge the steps of this airy power to be so light and evanescent in their nature that perhaps a Poet himself in a few years after finishing his work might be utterly unable to recollect the exact train of thought or the various minute occurrences which led him to the general design or directed him in the particular parts of his poem But in spite of the interval of so many  centuries the decisive magic of criticism can call up all the shadows of departed thought that ever existed in his brain and display with a most astonishing clearness the precise state of his mind in the moment of composition  "Homere" says Bossu "  Livre i chap  voyoit les Grecs pour qui il écrivoit diviséz en autant d'etats qu'ils avoient de villes considerables chacune faisoit un corps à part avoit sa forme de gouvernement independamment de toutes les autres Et toutefois ces etats differens etoient souvent obligéz de se reünir comme en un seul corps contre leurs ennemis communs Voila sans doute deux sortes de gouvernemens bien differens pour etre commodement reunis en un corps de morale en un seul poëme  "Le poëte en a donc fait deux fables separées L'une est pour toute la Grece reünie en un seul corps mais composée de parties independantes les unes des autres comme elles etoient en effet  l'autre est pour chaque etat particulier tels qu'ils etoient pendant la paix sans ce premier rapport sans la necessité de se reünir  "Homere a donc pris pour le fond de sa fable cette grande verité que la Mesintelligence des princes ruine leurs propres etats"  On the Odyssey Bossu remarks  "Que la verité qui sert de fond à cette fiction qui avec elle compose la fable est que l'absence d'une personne hors de chez soi ou qui n'a point l'oeil à ce qui s'y fait y cause de grands desordres  Livre i chap  "  On the mature consideration of these two moral axioms the Critic supposes the sublime Bard to have begun his respective Poems for Homer continues he  "  Livre i chap  n'avoit point d'autre dessein que de former agreablement les moeurs de ses Citoïens en leur proposant comme dit Horace ce qui est utile ou pernicieux ce qui est honnete  ou ce qui ne l'est pasil n'a entrepris de raconter aucune action particuliere d'Achille ou d'Ulysse Il a fait la fable et le dessein de ses poemes sans penser à ces princes ensuite il leur a fait l'honneur de donner leurs noms aux heros qu'il avoit feints"  The preceding remarks of this celebrated Critic have been frequently admired as an ingenious conjecture which most happily illustrates the real purpose of Homer To me they appear so much the reverse that if I ventured to adopt any decided opinion on a point so much darkened by the clouds of antiquity I should rather incline to the idea which Bossu affects to explode and suppose the Poems of Homer intended panegyrics on the very princes whom the Critic affirms he never thought of while he was designing the works which have made them immortal  There is a striking passage on this subject in a dialogue of Plato which I shall enlarge upon for two reasons st As it proves that the latter  persuasion concerning the purpose of Homer was entertained at Athens and dly Because it gives me a pleasing opportunity of supporting the learned Madame Dacier against an illgrounded censure of a late English critic In her Preface to the Odyssey she asserts that the judgment of antiquity decided in favour of the Iliad and she appeals to part of the sentence in Plato to which I have alluded as a proof of her assertion Mr Wood in a note to the Introduction of his Essay on Homer endeavours to shew the insufficiency of this proof and still farther to convince us that Madame Dacier was utterly mistaken in her sense of the passage to which she appealed If he ventures to contradict this learned lady he does not however insult her with that insolent pertness with which she is frequently treated in the notes to Pope's Homer and which for the honour of our English Poet I will not suppose to be his But though Mr Wood endeavours to support his opinion by argument I apprehend that he is  himself mistaken and that Madame Dacier is perfectly right in understanding the words of Socrates in their literal sense without the least mixture of irony It is true indeed that the aim of Socrates in the course of the dialogue is to ridicule the presumption and ignorance of the sophist Hippias in the most ironical manner but the particular speech on which Madame Dacier founds her opinion is a plain and simple address to Eudicus before he enters on his debate with the Sophist It turns on the most simple circumstance the truth of which Eudicus could hardly be ignorant of namely the sentiments of his own father concerning the Poems of Homer As these sentiments are such as I believe most admirers of the ancient Bard have entertained on the point in question I perfectly agree with Madame Dacier in thinking that Socrates means to be literal and serious when he says to Eudicus    Plat Hip min edit Serrani tom i p  "I have heard your father Apemantus say that the Iliad of Homer was a finer poem than his Odyssey and as far surpassed it in excellence as the virtue of Achilles surpassed the virtue of Ulysses for those two poems he said were purposely composed in honour of those two heroes the Odyssey to shew the virtues of Ulysses the Iliad those of Achilles"  Plato's Lesser Hippias translated by Sydenham page  Let us now return to Bossu whose opinion concerning the purpose of Homer we may venture to oppose supported as it is by an ingenious interpretation of some ambiguous passages in the Poetics of Aristotle and this opposition may be grounded not so much on the sentence which I have quoted from Plato as on the probable conduct of Epic composition in the early ages of poetry In  such periods as produced the talents of Virgil and of Dryden when all the arts of refined flattery were perfectly understood we can easily conceive that they might both be tempted to compliment the reigning monarch under the mask of such heroic names as history could supply and their genius accommodate to their purpose We find accordingly that the Roman Bard is supposed to have drawn a flattering portrait of his Emperor in the character of Aeneas and that the English Poet has with equal ingenuity enwrapt the dissolute Charles the Second in the Jewish robes of King David But in so rude an age as we must admit that of Homer to have been when the Poet was certainly more the child of Nature than of Art when he had no history to consult perhaps no patron to flatter and no critics to elude or obey in such an age may we not more naturally conjecture that poetical composition was neither laboured in its form nor deep in its design that instead of being the slow and systematic  product of political reasoning it was the quick and artless offspring of a strong and vivifying fancy which brooding over the tales of tradition soon raised them into such life and beauty as must satisfy and enchant a warlike and popular audience ever ready to listen with delight to the heroic feats of their ancestors  If the learned Bossu appears unfortunate in his system concerning the purpose of Homer he may be thought still more so in his attempt to analyse the Divinities of Virgil for to throw new light on the convention of the Gods in the opening of the tenth Aeneid he very seriously informs us that  "  Book v chap i  Venus is divine mercy or the love of God towards virtuous men and Juno his justice"  I cannot conclude these very free strictures on a celebrated author without bearing a pleasing testimony to the virtues of the manBossu is allowed by the biographers of his country to have been remarkable for the mildest manners and  most amiable disposition totally free from that imperious and bigotted attachment to speculative opinions which the science he cultivated is so apt to produce He endeared himself to Boileau by a generous act of friendship that led to an intimacy between them which was dissolved only by the death of the former in  NOTE V VERSE  Imputes to Virgil his own dark conceit    As it requires much leisure to examine and more skill to unravel an intricate hypothesis twisted into a long and laboured chain of quotation and argument the Dissertation on the sixth Book of Virgil remained for some time unrefuted The public very quietly acquiesced in the strange position of its author  "That Aeneas's adventure to the Infernal Shades is no other than a figurative description of his initiation into the Mysteries and particularly a very exact one of the spectacles of the Eleusinian"  At length a superior but anonymous  Critic arose who in one of the most judicious and spirited essays that our nation has produced on a point of classical literature completely overturned this illfounded edifice and exposed the arrogance and futility of its assuming architect The Essay I allude to is intitled "Critical Observations on the Sixth Book of the Aeneid" printed for Elmsly and as this little publication is I believe no longer to be purchased the curious reader may thank me for transcribing a few of its most striking passages  Having ridiculed with great spirit and propriety Warburton's general idea of the Aeneid as a political institute and his illsupported assertion that both the ancient and modern poets afforded Virgil a pattern for introducing the Mysteries into this famous episode the author proceeds to examine how far the Critic's hypothesis of initiation may be supported or overthrown by the text of the Poet  "It is" says he "from extrinsical circumstances that we may expect the discovery of Virgil's allegory Every one of these circumstances  persuades me that Virgil described a real not a mimic world and that the scene lay in the Infernal Shades and not in the Temple of Ceres  "The singularity of the Cumaean shores must be present to every traveller who has once seen them To a superstitious mind the thin crust vast cavities sulphureous steams poisonous exhalations and fiery torrents may seem to trace out the narrow confine of the two worlds The lake Avernus was the chief object of religious horror the black woods which surrounded it when Virgil first came to Naples were perfectly suited to feed the superstition of the people  Strabo l v p  It was generally believed that this deadly flood was the entrance of Hell  Sil Ital l xii  and an oracle was once established on its banks which pretended by magic rites to call up the departed spirits  Diod Siculus l iv p edit Wesseling  Aeneas  who revolved a more daring enterprize addresses himself to the priestless of those dark regions Their conversation may perhaps inform us whether an initiation or a descent to the Shades was the object of this enterprize She endeavours to deter the hero by setting before him all the dangers of his rash undertaking  Facilis descensus Averni  Noctes atque dies patet atri janua Ditis  Sed revocare gradum superasque evadere ad auras  Hoc opus hic labor est  Aeneid vi  "These particulars are absolutely irreconcileable with the idea of initiation but perfectly agreeable to that of a real descent That every step and every instant may lead us to the grave is a melancholy truth The Mysteries were only open at stated times a few days at most in the  course of a year The mimic descent of the Mysteries was laborious and dangerous the return to light easy and certain In real death this order is inverted  Pauci quos aequus amavit  Jupiter aut ardens evexit ad aethera virtus  Diis geniti potuere  Aeneid vi  These heroes as we learn from the Speech of Aeneas were Hercules Orpheus Castor and Pollux Theseus and Pirithous Of all these antiquity believed that before their death they had seen the habitations of the dead nor indeed will any of the circumstances tally with a supposed initiation The adventure of Eurydice the alternate life of the Brothers and the forcible intrusion of Alcides Theseus and Pirithous would mock the endeavours of the most subtle critic who should try to melt them down into his  favourite Mysteries The exploits of Hercules who triumphed over the King of Terrors  Tartareum ille manu custodem in vincla petivit  Ipsius a solio regis traxitque trementem  Aeneid vi    was a wild imagination of the Greeks  Homer Odyss l xi ver Apoll Bib l ii c  but it was the duty of ancient Poets to adopt and embellish these popular traditions and it is the interest of every man of taste to acquiesce in  their poetical fictions  "  "Virgil has borrowed as usual from Homer his episode of the Infernal Shades and as usual has infinitely improved what the Grecian had invented If among a profusion of beauties I durst venture to point out the most striking beauties of the sixth Book I should perhaps observe That after accompanying the hero through the silent realms of Night and Chaos we see with astonishment and pleasure a new creation bursting upon us That we examine with a delight  which springs from the love of virtue the just empire of Minos in which the apparent irregularities of the present system are corrected where the patriot who died for his country is happy and the tyrant who oppressed it is miserable As we interest ourselves in the hero's fortunes we share his feelingsthe melancholy Palinurus the wretched Deiphobus the indignant Dido the Grecian kings who tremble at his presence and the venerable Anchises who embraces his pious son and displays to his sight the future glories of his race all these objects affect us with a variety of pleasing sensations  "Let us for a moment obey the mandate of our great Critic and consider these awful scenes as a mimic shew exhibited in the Temple of Ceres by the contrivance of the priest or if he pleases of the legislator Whatever was animated I appeal to every reader of taste whatever was terrible or whatever was pathetic evaporates into lifeless allegory  Tenuem sine viribus umbram  Dat inania verba  Dat sine mente sonum gressusque effingit euntis  The end of philosophy is truth the end of poetry is pleasure I willingly adopt any interpretation which adds new beauties to the original I assist in persuading myself that it is just and could almost shew the same indulgence to the Critic's as to the Poet's fiction But should a grave Doctor lay out fourscore pages in explaining away the sense and spirit of Virgil I should have every inducement to believe that Virgil's soul was very different from the Doctor's"  Having shewn in this spirited manner how far the hypothesis of the Critic is inconsistent with particular passages and with the general character of the Poet the Essayist proceeds to alledge  "two simple reasons which persuade him that Virgil has not revealed the secret of the Eleusinian mysteries the first is  his ignorance  and the  second  his discretion  "  The author then proves by very ingenious historical arguments st That it is probable the Poet was never initiated himself and dly That if he were so it is more probable that he would not have violated the laws both of religion and of honour in betraying the secret of the Mysteries particularly as that species of profanation is mentioned with abhorrence by a cotemporary Poet  Vetabo qui Cereris sacrum  Vulgârit arcanae sub iisdem  Sit trabibus fragilemque mecum  Solvat phaselum  HOR l iii od  When Horace composed the Ode which contains the preceding passage  "the Aeneid continues my author and particularly the sixth Book were already known to the public  Donat in Virgil Propert l ii el xxv v  The detestation of the wretch who reveals the Mysteries of Ceres  though expressed in general terms must be applied by all Rome to the author of the sixth Book of the Aeneld Can we seriously suppose that Horace would have branded with such wanton infamy one of the men in the world whom he loved and honoured the most  Hor l i od l i serm v ver c    "Nothing remains to say except that Horace was himself ignorant of his friend's allegorical meaning which the Bishop of Gloucester has since revealed to the world It may be so yet for my own part I should be very well satisfied with understanding Virgil no better than Horace did"  Such is the forcible reasoning of this ingenious and spirited writer I have been tempted to transcribe these considerable portions of his Work by an idea perhaps an illfounded one that the circulation of his little Pamphlet has not been equal to its merit But if it has been in any degree neglected by our country it has not escaped the researches  or wanted the applause of a learned and judicious foreigner Professor Heyne the late accurate and accomplished Editor of Virgil has mentioned it in his Comments to the sixth Book of the Aeneid with the honour it deserves He remarks indeed that the Author has censured the learned Prelate with some little acrimony  "Paullò acrius quam velis"  But what lover of poetry unbiassed by personal connection can speak of Warburton without some marks of indignation If I have also alluded to this famous Commentator with a contemptuous asperity it arises from the persuasion that he has sullied the page of every Poet whom he pretended to illustrate and that he frequently degraded the useful and generous profession of Criticism into a mean instrument of personal malignity or to use the more forcible language of his greatest antagonist that he  "invested himself in the high office of Inquisitor General and Supreme Judge of the Opinions of the Learned which he assumed and exercised with a ferocity and despotism without  example in the Republic of Letters and hardly to be paralleled among the disciples of Dominic  Letter to Warburton by a late Professor c p d edition  "  It is the just lot of tyrants to be detested and of all usurpers the literary despot is the least excusable as he has not the common tyrannical plea of necessity or interest to alledge in his behalf for the prevalence of  his edicts  will be found to sink in proportion to the arbitrary tone with which they are pronounced The fate of Warburton is a striking instance of this important truth What havock has the course of very few years produced in that pile of imperious criticism which he had heaped together Many of his notes on Shakespeare have already resigned their place to the superior comments of more accomplished Critics and perhaps the day is not far distant when the volumes of Pope himself will cease to be a repository for the lumber of his  friend The severest enemies of Warburton must indeed allow that several of his remarks on his Poetical Patron are entitled to preservation by their use or beauty but the greater part I apprehend are equally destitute of both and how far the Critic was capable of disgracing the Poet must be evident to every reader who recollects that the nonsense in the Essay on Criticism where Pegasus is made to  snatch a grace  which is justly censured by Dr Warton was first introduced into the poem by an arbitrary transposition of the editor  Though arrogance is perhaps the most striking and characteristical defect in the composition of this assuming Commentator he had certainly other critical failings of considerable importance and it may possibly be rendering some little service to the art which he professed to investigate the peculiarities in this singular writer which conspire to plunge him in the crowd of those  evanescent critics  if I may use such an expression  whom his friend Pope beheld in so clear a vision that he seems to have given us a prophetical portrait of his own Commentator  Critics I saw that others' names efface  And fix their own with labour in the place  Their own like others' soon their place resign'd  Or disappear'd and left the first behind  I shall therefore hazard a few farther observations not only on this famous Critic of our age and country but on the two greater names of antiquity to each of whom he has been declared superior by the partial voice of enthusiastic friendship I wish not to offend his most zealous adherents and though I cannot but consider him as a literary usurper I speak of him as a great Historian said of more exalted tyrants sine ira et studio quorum causas procul habeoThere seem to be three natural endowments requisite in the formation of an accomplished  criticstrong understanding lively imagination and refined sensibility The first was the characteristic of Aristotle and by the consent of all ages he is allowed to have possessed it in a superlative degree May I be pardoned for the opinion that he enjoyed but a very moderate portion of the  other two  I would not absolutely say that he had neither Fancy nor Feeling but that his imagination was  not brilliant  and that his sensibility was not exquisite may I think be fairly presumed from the general tenor of his prose nor does the little relique of his poetry contradict the idea The two qualities in which Aristotle may be supposed defective were the very two which peculiarly distinguish Longinus who certainly wanted not understanding though he might not possess the philosophical sagacity of the Stagyrite When considered in every point of view he appears the most consummate character among the Critics of antiquity If Warburton bore any resemblance to either of these mighty names I apprehend it  must be to the former and perhaps in imagination he was superior to Aristotle but of the three qualities which I have ventured to consider as requisite in the perfect Critic I conceive him to have been miserably deficient in the last and certainly the most essential of the three for as the great Commentator of Horace has philosophically and truly remarked in a note to that Poet  "Feeling or Sentiment is not only the surest but the sole ultimate arbiter of works of genius  Notes on the Epistle to Augustus ver  "  A man may possess an acute understanding and a lively imagination without being a found Critic and this truth perhaps cannot be more clearly shewn than in the writings of Warburton His understanding was undoubtedly acute his imagination was lively but Imagination and Sentiment are by no means synonymous and he certainly wanted those finer feelings which constitute accuracy of discernment and a perfect perception of literary excellence In consequence  of this defect instead of seizing the real sense and intended beauties of an author he frequently followed the caprices of his own active fancy which led him in quest of secret meanings and mysterious allusions these he readily found and his powers of understanding enabled him to dress them up in a plausible and specious form and to persuade many readers that he was what he believed himself to be the restorer of genuine Criticism As a farther proof that he was destitute of refined sensibility I might alledge the peculiarity of his diction which as Dr Johnson has very justly remarked is coarse and impure Perhaps it may be found that in proportion as authors have enjoyed the quality which I suppose him to have wanted they have been more or less distinguished by the ease the elegance and the beauty of their language were I required to fortify this conjecture by examples I should produce the names of Virgil and Racine of Fenelon and Addisonthat Addison who though insulted by the Commentator  of Pope with the names of an indifferent Poet and a worse Critic was I think as much superior to his insulter in critical taste and in solidity of judgment as he confessedly was in the harmony of his style and in all the finer graces of beautiful composition  NOTE VI VERSE  'Tis said by one who with this candid claim  Has gain'd no fading wreath of critic fame    These and the six subsequent lines allude to the following passage in Dr Warton's Essay on Pope  "I conclude these reflections with a remarkable factIn no polished nation after Criticism has been much studied and the rules of writing established has any very extraordinary work ever appeared This has visibly been the case in Greece in Rome and in France after Aristotle Horace and Boileau had written their Arts of Poetry In our own country the rules of the Drama for instance  were never more completely understood than at present yet what uninteresting though faultless Tragedies have we lately seen so much better is our judgment than our execution How to account for the fact here mentioned adequately and justly would be attended with all those difficulties that await discussions relative to the productions of the human mind and to the delicate and secret causes that influence them whether or no the natural powers be not confined and debilitated by that timidity and caution which is occasioned by a rigid regard to the dictates of art or whether that philosophical that geometrical and systematical spirit so much in vogue which has spread itself from the sciences even into polite literature by consulting only  reason  has not diminished and destroyed  sentiment  and made our poets write from and to the  head  rather than the heart or whether lastly when just models from which the rules have necessarily been drawn have once appeared succeeding writers by vainly and ambitiously  striving to surpass those just models and to shine and surprise do not become stiff and forced and affected in their thoughts and diction"  Warton's Essay page d edition  I admire this ingenious and modest reasoning but for the honour of that severer art which this pleasing writer has the happy talent to enliven and embellish I will venture to start some doubts concerning the fact itself for which he endeavours to account Perhaps our acquaintance with those writings of Greece and Rome which were subsequent to Aristotle and Horace is not sufficiently perfect to decide the point either way in respect to those countries But with regard to France may we not assert that her poetical productions which arose after the publication of Boileau's Didactic Essay are at least equal if not superior to those which preceded that period If the Henriade of Voltaire is not a fine Epic poem it is allowed to be the best which the French have to boast not to mention the  dramatic works of that extraordinary and universal author If this remarkable fact may indeed be found true I should rather suppose it to arise from the irritable nature of the poetic spirit so peculiarly averse to restraint and controul The Bard who could gallop his Pegasus over a free and open plain might be eager to engage in so pleasing an exercise but he who observed the directionposts so thickly and so perversely planted that instead of assisting his career they must probably occasion his fall would easily be tempted to descend from his steed and to decline the course Let me illustrate this conjecture by a striking fact in the very words of the Poet just mentioned who was by no means deficient in poetical confidence and who has left us the following anecdote of himself in that pleasing little anonymous work intitled Commentaire Historique sur les Oeuvres de l'Auteur de la Henriade  "Il lut un jour plusieurs chants de ce poeme chez le jeune Président de Maisons son intime ami On  l'impatienta par des objections il jetta son manuscrit dans le feu Le Président Hénaut l'en retira avee peine "Souvenez vous lui dit Mr Hénaut dans une de ses lettres que c'est moi qui ai sauvé la Henriade et qu'il m'en a couté une belle paire de manchettes"  To return to the Essay on PopeI rejoice that the amiable Critic has at length obliged the public with the conclusion of his most engaging and ingenious work he has the singular talent to instruct and to please even those readers who are most ready to revolt from the opinion which he endeavours to establish and he has in some degree atoned for that excess of severity which his first volume discovered and which sunk the reputation of Pope in the eyes of many who judge not for themselves even far below that mortifying level to which he meant to reduce it Had Pope been alive to add this spirited essay to the bundle of writings against himself which he is said to have collected he must have felt that  like the dagger of Brutus it gave the most painful blow from the character of the assailant  "All the conspirators save only he  Did that they did in envy of great Caesar  He only in a general honest thought  And common good to all made one of them"  Yet Pope ascended not the throne of Poetry by usurpation but was seated there by a legal title of which I shall speak farther in a subsequent note  NOTE VII VERSE  His hallow'd subject by that Law forbid  Might still have laid in silent darkness hid    Boileau's Art of Poetry made its first appearance in six years after the publication of Paradise Lost The verses of

Poetique de DESPREAUX chant iii ver c  The preceding lines which are said to have been levelled at the Clovis of Desmaretz appear so pointed against the subject of Milton that we might almost believe them intended as a satire on our divine Bard There is nothing in Boileau's admirable Didactic Essay so liable to objection as the whole passage concerning Epic poetry His patronage of the old Pagan divinities and his oblique recommendation of Classical heroes are alike exceptionable Even a higher name than Boileau has failed in framing precepts for the Epic Muse The maxims delivered by Tasso himself in his Discourse on Epic poetry are so far from perfect that an agreeable and judicious French critic has very justly said of him  "S'il eût mis sa theorie en pratique son poeme n'auroit pas tant de charmes  Marmontel Poetique Françoise  "  I am not so vain as to think of succeeding in the point where these immortal authors have failed and I must beg my  reader to remember that the present work is by no means intended as a code of laws for the Epic poet it is not my design  To write receipts how poems may be made  for I think the writer who would condescend to frame this higher species of composition according to the exact letter of any directions whatever may be most properly referred to that admirable receipt for an Epic poem with which Martinus Scriblerus will happily supply him My serious desire is to examine and refute the prejudices which have produced as I apprehend the neglect of the Heroic Muse I wish to kindle in our Poets a warmer sense of national honour with ambition to excel in the noblest province of poesy If my Essay should excite that generous enthusiasm in the breast of any young poetic genius so far from wishing to confine him by any arbitrary dictates of my own imagination I should rather say to him in the words of Dante's Virgil  Non aspettar mio dir più nè mio cenno  Libero dritto sano è tuo arbitrio  E fallo fora non fare a suo senno

adversaries of Homer the French are most remarkable for their severity and injustice nor is it surprising that the nation which has displayed the faintest sparks of Epic fire should be the most solicitous to reduce the oppressive splendor of this exalted luminary  The most depreciating remarks on genius in every walk are generally made by those who are the least able to prove its rivals and often perhaps not so much from the prevalence of envious malignity as from the want of vivid and delicate perception The merits and the failings of Homer were agitated in France with all the heat and acrimony of a theological dispute Madame Dacier distinguished herself in the contest by her uncommon talents and erudition she combated for the Grecian Bard with the spirit of Minerva defending the father of the Gods It must however be confessed that she sometimes overstepped the modesty of wisdom and caught unwarily the scolding tone of Juno It is indeed amusing to observe a people who pique themselves on their extreme politeness and censure Homer for the gross behaviour of his Gods engaging among themselves in a squabble concerning this very Poet with all the unrefined animosity of his Olympian Synod In the whole controversy there is nothing more worthy of remembrance  and of praise than the lively elegance and the pleasing goodhumour of Mr de la Motte who though not one of the most exalted was certainly one of the most amiable characters in the literary world and made a generous return to the severity of his female antagonist by writing an ode in her praise Voltaire has pointed out with his usual spirit the failings of La Motte in his Abridgement of the Iliad but he has frequently fallen himself into similar defects and is equally unjust to Homer against whom he has levelled the most bitter sarcasms both in prose and verse Voltaire attacking Homer is like Paris shooting his arrow at the heel of Achilles the two Poets are as unequal as the two ancient Warriors yet Homer like Achilles may have his vulnerable spot but with this happy difference that although the shaft of ridicule which is pointed against him may be tinged with venom its wound cannot be mortal Perhaps no better answer can be made to all those who amuse themselves with writing against Homer than the following reply of Madame  Dacier to the Abbé Terrasson who had attacked her favourite Bard in two abusive volumes  "Que Monsieur l' Abbé Terrasson trouve Homere sot ridicule extravagant ennuyeux c'est son affaire le public jugera si c'est un defaut à Homere de deplaire à M l' Abbé Terrasson ou à M l' Abbé Terrasson de ne pas gouter Homere"  NOTE II VERSE  E'en Socrates himself that purest Sage  Imbib'd his Wisdom from thy moral page    Dio Chrysostom in one of his orations has called Socrates the disciple of Homer and drawn a short parallel of their respective merits observing in honour of both  "  "  DION CHRYS p  NOTE III VERSE  How high soe'er she leads his daring flight  c  I mean not to injure the dignity of Pindar by this assertion Though Quinctilian in drawing the character of the Grecian Lyric Poets has given him high preeminence in that choir we may I think very fairly conjecture that some odes of Alcaeus and Stesichorus were not inferior to those of the Theban Bard who is said to have been repeatedly vanquished in a poetical contest by his female antagonist Corinna The absurd jealousy of our sex concerning literary talents has led some eminent writers to question the merits of Corinna as Olearius has observed in his Dissertation on the female Poets of Greece But her glory seems to have been fully established by the public memorial of her picture exhibited in her native city and adorned with a symbol of her victory Pausanias who saw it supposes her to have been one of the handsomest women of her time and the ingenuity of some Critics imputes her success  in the poetical contest to the influence of her beauty They have taken some liberties less pardonable with her literary reputation and by their curious comments on a single Greek syllable made the sublime Pindar call his fair rival  a Sow  though the unfortunate word  which may be twisted into that meaning signifies in its more obvious construction that the Poet challenged his successful antagonist to a new trial of skillFor a more minute account of this singular piece of criticism I must refer the reader to the notes on Corinna in the Fragmenta Poetriarum by Wolfius Time has left us only a few diminutive scraps of Corinna's Poetry but Plutarch in his Treatise on the Glory of the Athenians has preserved one of her critical Bonmots which may deserve to be repeated That author asserts that Corinna instructed Pindar in his youth and advised him to adorn his composition with the embellishments of fable The obedient Poet soon brought her some verses in which he had followed her advice rather too freely when his Tutress  smiling at his profusion    NOTE IV VERSE  Yet may not Judgment with severe disdain  Slight the young Rhodian's variegated strain    Apollonius surnamed the Rhodian from the place of his residence is supposed to have been a native of Alexandria where he is said to have recited some portion of his Poem while he was yet a youth Finding it ill received by his countrymen he retired to Rhodes where he is conjectured to have polished and completed his Work supporting himself by the profession of Rhetoric and receiving from the Rhodians the freedom of their city He at length returned with considerable honour to the place of his birth succeeding Eratosthenes in the care of the Alexandrian Library in the reign of Ptolemy Euergetes who ascended the throne of Egypt in the year before  Christ That prince had been educated by the famous Aristarchus and rivalled the preceding sovereigns of his liberal family in the munificent encouragement of learning Apollonius was a disciple of the poet Callimachus but their connection ended in the most violent enmity which was probably owing to some degree of contempt expressed by Apollonius for the light compositions of his master The learned have vainly endeavoured to discover the particulars of their quarrelThe only Work of Apollonius which has descended to modern times is his Poem in four Books on the Argonautic expedition Both Longinus and Quinctilian have assigned to this Work the mortifying character of Mediocrity but there lies an appeal from the sentence of the most candid and enlightened Critics to the voice of Nature and the merit of Apollonius has little to apprehend from the decision of this ultimate judge His Poem abounds in animated description and in passages of the  most tender and pathetic beauty How finely painted is the first setting forth of the Argo and how beautifully is the wife of Chiron introduced holding up the little Achilles in her arms and shewing him to his father Peleus as he sailed along the shore But the chief excellence in our Poet is the spirit and delicacy with which he has delineated the passion of love in his Medea That Virgil thought very highly of his merit in this particular is sufficiently evident from the minute exactness with which he has copied many tender touches of the Grecian Poet Those who compare the third Book of Apollonius with the fourth of Virgil may I think perceive not only that Dido has some features of Medea but that the two Bards however different in their reputation resembled each other in their genius and that they both excel in delicacy and pathos  NOTE V VERSE  Virgil sinks loaded with their heavy praise    Scaliger appears to be the most extravagant of all the Critics who have lavished their undistinguishing encomiums on Virgil by asserting that he alone is entitled to the name of Poet Poetices lib iii c Though the opinion of Spence and other modern Critics concerning the character of Aeneas considered as an allegorical portrait of Augustus seems to gain ground yet it might perhaps be easy to overturn the ingenious conjectures and the fanciful reasoning by which that idea has been supported This attempt would have the sanction of one of the most judicious Commentators of Virgil for the learned Heyne expressly rejects all allegorical interpretation and thinks it improbable that a Poet of so correct a judgment could have adopted a plan which must necessarily contract and cramp his  powers He even ventures to assert that if the character of Aeneas was delineated as an allegorical portrait of Augustus the execution of it is unhappy The strongest argument which has been adduced to support this conjecture is founded on the ingenious interpretation of the following passage in the opening of the third Georgic  Primus ego in patriam mecum modo vita supersit  Aonio rediens deducam vertice Musas  Primus Idumaeas referam tibi Mantua palmas  Et viridi in campo templum de marmore ponam  Propter aquam tardis ingens ubi flexibus errat  Mincius et tenerâ praetexit arundine ripas  In medio mihi Caesar erit templumque tenebit c  These lines in which Virgil expresses his intention of dedicating a temple to Augustus have been considered as the  noblest allegory of ancient  Poetry  Hurd's Horace vol ii page  and the great Critic who first started the idea has expatiated in the triumph of his discovery on the  mysterious  beauties they contain but the whole of this hypothesis is unfortunately built upon the rejection of three verses which are pronounced unworthy of the Poet and which though found in every MS the Critic claims a right of removing A licence so extraordinary cannot even be justified by the talents of this accomplished writer for if the less elegant passages of the ancient Poets might be removed at pleasure their compositions would be exposed to the caprice of every fantastic commentator The obvious and literal interpretation not only renders this violence unnecessary but is more agreeable to the judgment of the Poet and the manners of his age The custom of erecting real temples was so familiar to antiquity that a Roman would never have suspected the edifice was to be raised only with poetical materials We may even conjecture from a line of Statius that  the Poet himself had a temple erected to his memory and without any breach of probability we may admit his intention of giving his living Emperor such a testimony of his gratitude This adulation though shocking to us was too generally justified by example to oblige the Poet to palliate it by a fiction He had before acquiesced in the divinity of his Imperial Patron and had expressed the idea in its full sense  Namque erit ille mihi semper  Deus  illius aram  Saepè tener nostris ab ovilibus imbuet agnus  ECLOG I  Ingredere et votis jam  nunc  assuesce vocari  GEORG I  Having made such an invocation in the beginning of his Work was his  delicacy  afterwards to be shocked and oblige him to pay a compliment under the disguise of an obscure conceit for that  allegory must be allowed to be obscure which had remained through so many ages unexplained The unfortunate rejected lines for whose elegance we do not contend may at least be rescued from impropriety by a literal interpretation of the preceding passage for dismiss the conjectured allegory and the chief objections against them remain no longer If the phraseology be peculiar it is at least supported by concurring MSS The adjective  ardens  is sometimes undoubtedly joined to a word that does not denote a substance of heat or flame as the Critic himself admits in the case of  ardentes hostes  to which we may add the  verbum ardens  of Cicero  A Friend who possesses much elegant erudition has remarked to me that the learned Prelate is particularly unhappy in his assertion respecting the use of the word  ardens  an assertion completely contradicted by the following passages from Lucretius and Virgil  Vulneris  ardenti  ut morsu premat icta dolore  LUCRET lib iii ver  Quos  ardens  evexit ad aethera virtus  AENEID VI  As to the line which is  said to contain the most glaring note of illegitimacy  Tithoni primâ quot abest ab origine Caesar  many reasons might induce the Poet to use the name of Tithonus which at this distance of time it is not easy for us to conjecture Perhaps he chose it to vary the expression of  Assaraci Proles  which he had adopted in the preceding lines The absurdity of the subjectmatter and the place in which it is introduced that are insisted on as the principal objections arise solely from the allegorical hypothesis without it the construction will be plain and natural The Poet expresses his intention of erecting a temple to Augustus and expatiates on the magnificence with which it was to be adorned he then returns to his present poetical subject  Interea  Dryadum sylvas saltusque sequamur  and having dwelt a little on that to avoid too long a digression very naturally resumes the  praises of the Emperor by alluding to the sublimer song which he intended to devote to him  hereafter  Mox  tamen ardentes accingar dicere pugnas  Caesaris  Perhaps the important position that gave rise to this conjecture and to others of a similar complexion  "that the propriety of allegorical composition made the distinguished pride of ancient poetry"  is as questionable as the conjecture itself and a diligent and judicious perusal of the ancient Poets might convince us that simplicity was their genuine character and that many of their allegorical beauties have originated in the fertile imagination of their commentators Aristarchus indeed the celebrated model of ancient criticism rejected with great spirit the allegorical interpretations of Homer as we are informed by Eusthathius but the good Archbishop of Thessalonica who like some modern prelates had a passion for allegory censures the great Critic of  Alexandria for his more simple mode of construction and supposes it an injury to the refined beauties and profound wisdom of the Poet  '    EUSTH vol iii page  Having considered in this note some conjectures on Virgil that appear to me fantastical and ill founded I am tempted to produce two illustrations of the same great poet which if I am not deceived by friendship reflect more light and honour on the first of the Roman poets At all events they will be esteemed as a literary curiosity by the reader when I tell him they were written by a Critic whose name is doubly entitled to respect in the republic of letters from his own taste and erudition and from the poetical genius of his daughterIn the early part of his life Mr Seward of Lichfield had thoughts of publishing a translation of Virgil in blank verse Among his remarks on different passages of his  author the two following appeared to me particularly happy and I transcribe them from the papers of my worthy old friend in the persuasion that every lover of Virgil will peruse them with pleasure  "THERE are two passages in the Aeneid which seem to me misunderstood by all the commentators and translators from the age of the Roman classics to the present and yet when properly explained they will I hope appear beautiful clear and almost indisputable I shall mention them as they occurred to me The first of these lines is in the eighth book of the Aeneid verse It is in the prophetic description of the battle of Actium between Augustus and Antony carved by Vulcan on the shield of Aeneas  Arva novâ Neptunia caede rubescunt  Regina in mediis patrio vocat agmina sistro  Necdum etiam geminos a tergo respicit angues  Omnigenûmque deûm monstra et latrator Anubis  Contra Neptunum et Venerem contraque Minervam  Tela tenent saevit medio in certamine Mavors  Caelatus ferro tristesque ex aethere Dirae  Et scissà gaudens vadit Discordia pallà  Quam cum sanguineo sequitur Bellona flagello  The difficulty in this passage is to know what and where the two prophetic snakes were behind Cleopatra's back Most commentators say that they were carved upon her shield which hung upon her back but surely this could not be designed by Virgil if he meant to represent Cleopatra in armour as he undoubtedly did he would not have hung her shield behind her back in the hour of battle In the next place why does he give her two serpents when both her sculptors painters and historians give her only  one  the bite of which in that country of venomous creatures was quite sufficient to slay her Nor would Virgil the model of perspicuity express himself so confusedly as to talk of her  turning her eyes to what is carved upon her own back If the reader is convinced that the passage wants perspicuity he will be pleased to find the whole cleared up by observing that the two snakes were on the  caduceus  of  Anubis  which consisted of a  dog's head  on a human figure with a  caduceus  in one hand on the top of which were two beautifully curling asps or snakes and a purse or a porridge pot in his left  Le Pluche  from whence the Greeks perhaps without knowing the meaning of this emblem took their  Mercury  They discarded the  dog's head  as unsightly and placed a human one in its stead by which they destroyed the emblematic figures though they left the name of  latrator  or  barker  sufficient to lead us to its real meaning which was that of the  dogstar  the rising of which just preceded the  overflow of the Nile  As soon therefore as the astronomers of Egypt could discern the  dogstar  risen in the spring they gave notice of it by their  Anubis  or  dog  which was hung out on their several towers that  all the people might fly to their terraces and places of safety but if clouds had before obstructed the view of the star and it was risen high before it was discerned they added wings to his feet and shoulders put his caduceus in his right hand and a porridge pot or purse in his left to hurry the people in their preparations against the deluge Virgil therefore in describing Cleopatra in her ship evidently supposes the name of her ship to have been  Anubis  whose image was carved on the poop of it holding his  caduceus  behind Cleopatra The rest of the Egyptian fleet having  "omnigenûm deûm monstra"  other Egyptian deities on their poops who  Contra Neptunum et Venerem contraque Minervam  Tela tenent  that is the  Egyptian  ships and  Roman  were ranged in battle against each other  Cana fides et Vesta Remo cum fratre Quirinus  Jura dabunt  AENEID I ver  Scarce any passage in Virgil has given me greater trouble took longer time or gave me greater pleasure in the discovery than this The difficulty was to know how Virgil came to chuse Romulus and Remus the one the murderer of the other as the joint legislators of a new golden age of peace and prosperity Much historical knowledge has been in vain applied to form many strange interpretations with which the Critics themselves are plainly dissatisfied much the most plausible is that of Ruaeus that "  Cana Fides  " was the ancient faith of citizens to each other  Vesta  religion and  Romulus  and  Remus  the power of the  Princes  united as legislators But how a  Fratricide  could represent such an union would be strange indeedI will not detain the reader with enumerating the many absurd conjectures of interpretation but shall only mention some facts relating to a new solution First this book of Virgil was evidently written soon after  the battle of  Actium  when Antony being subdued the whole world seemed at peace and Augustus shut the gate of Janus Mecaenas was his favourite Minister and Praetor Urbanus and had just then with wonderful sagacity discovered and suppressed a conspiracy against the Emperor's life on his return in triumph to Rome One of the principal actors in this conspiracy was the son of the late Triumvir Lepidus whom with several other conspirators he had unknown each to the other seized imprisoned and privately destroyed without any noise or public disturbance The knowledge of this recent fact makes it still more surprising that Virgil who is full of compliments to his patron in most of his other works should in his principal poem totally omit speaking of him unless he is supposed to have represented him by the character of "fidus Achates" which amounts to no more than that of lighting a fire to dry their clothes and their corn after a storm or to bring Ascanius to his father to partake of Dido's entertainment I hope to prove that Virgil's  supposed neglect of his friend is not true and that he is in the line above elegantly and judiciously complimented as also very intelligibly so to all who knew the history of this conspiracy and that Mecaenas was Praetor Urbanus with a power equal if not superior to our Lord Chief Justice and our Lord Chancellor conjoined It occurred to me many years before I knew any proof of it that "Cana Fides et Vesta et Remo cum fratre Quirinus" were the names of those temples where Mecaenas held his beds of justice in the same manner as in the former note "Anubis" and "Deorum monstra" were only the names of the Egyptian ships opposed to those of the Romans named Mercury Venus and Minerva I had many years a strong suspicion of this when accidentally reading Horace's Epistle "Ibam fortè viâ sacrâ" I found that the temple of Vesta was employed by Mecaenas for trials of civil causes See Sat IX Book IHaving therefore found my conjecture with regard to the temple of Vesta verified I pursued my search to the others viz  of Romulus and Remus and of Fides The first I found to be the place of trial and punishment of criminals and the next to be the temple where the tablets of all the Senatûs Consulta were hung up and which in Caesar's time were so numerous that the walls of the temple could not contain them and therefore an additional building was erected this therefore seems extremely proper to accompany the seats of judicature The compliment to Mecaenas is this When civil wars shall cease and all power regal consular and tribunitial centre in Augustus his friend and favourite Mecaenas shall be Praetor Urbanus who shall rule by the equitable laws suspended in the ancient temple of Fides shall decide civil causes in the temple and grove of Vesta and criminal ones in the temple of Romulus and Remus  The foundation walls of which still remain and on them is built a modern temple dedicated to two brother saints  Roma Antica  All this would be clearly understood by those who knew the ample powers conferred on Mecaenas by his judicial office of Praetor Urbanus"  NOTE VI VERSE  Shall History's pen to aid his vengeance won    There is hardly any eminent personage of antiquity who has suffered more from detraction both in his literary and moral character than the poet Lucan His fate indeed seems in all points to have been peculiarly severe His early death at an age when few Poets have even laid the foundation of their capital work is itself sufficient to excite our compassion and regret but to perish by the envious tyranny of Nero may be considered as a blessing when compared with the more cruel misfortune of being branded with infamy in the immortal pages of Tacitus As I am persuaded that the great Historian has inadvertently adopted the grossest calumny against our Poet I shall most readily assign my reasons for thinking so It may first be proper to give a short sketch of Lucan's lifeHe was the son of Anneus Mela the youngest brother of Seneca  and though born at Corduba was conveyed to Rome at the age of eight months a circumstance as his more indulgent critics observe which sufficiently refutes the censure of those who consider his language as provincial At Rome he was educated under the Stoic Cornutus so warmly celebrated by his disciple Persius the Satirist who was the intimate friend of our Poet In the close of his education Lucan is said to have passed some time at Athens On his return to Rome he rose to the office of Quaestor before he had attained the legal age He was afterwards inrolled among the Augurs and married a lady of noble birth of whose amiable character I shall speak more at large in a subsequent note Lucan had for some time been admitted to familiarity with Nero when the Emperor chose to contend for poetical honours by the public recital of a poem he had composed on Niobe and some verses of this imperial production are supposed to be preserved in the First Satire of Persius Lucan had the hardiness to repeat a poem  on Orpheus in competition with that of Nero and what is more remarkable the judges of the contest were just and bold enough to decide against the Emperor From hence Nero became the persecutor of his successful rival and forbade him to produce any poetry in public The wellknown conspiracy of Piso against the tyrant soon followed and Tacitus with his usual sarcastic severity concludes that Lucan engaged in the enterprize from the poetical injuries he had received a remark which does little credit to the candour of the Historian who might have found a much nobler and I will add a more probable motive for his conduct in the generous ardour of his character and his passionate adoration of freedom In the sequel of his narration Tacitus alledges a charge against our Poet which if it were true must lead us to detest him as the most abject of mankind The Historian asserts that Lucan when accused of the conspiracy for some time denied the charge but corrupted at last by a promise of impunity and desirous to atone for  the tardiness of his confession accused his mother Atilla as his accomplice This circumstance is so improbable in itself and so little consonant to the general character of Lucan that some writers have treated it with contempt as a calumny invented by Nero to vilify the object of his envious abhorrence But the name of Tacitus has given such an air of authority to the story that it may seem to deserve a more serious discussion particularly as there are two subsequent events related by the same Historian which have a tendency to invalidate the accusation so injurious to our Poet The events I mean are the fate of Annaeus and the escape of Atilla the two parents of Lucan The former died in consequence of an accusation brought against him after the death of his son by Fabius Romanus who had been intimate with Lucan and forged some letters in his name with the design of proving his father concerned in the conspiracy These letters were produced to Nero who sent them to Annaeus from an eager desire says Tacitus to get possession  of his wealth From this fact two inferences may be drawn according to the different lights in which it may be consideredIf the accusation against Annaeus was just it is clear that Lucan had not betrayed his father and he appears the less likely to have endangered by his confession the life of a parent to whom he owed a still tenderer regardIf Annaeus was not involved in the conspiracy and merely put to death by Nero for the sake of his treasure we may the more readily believe that the tyrant who murdered the father from avarice might calumniate the son from envy But the escape of Atilla affords us the strongest reason to conclude that Lucan was perfectly innocent of the abject and unnatural treachery of which Tacitus has supposed him guilty Had the Poet really named his mother as his accomplice would the vindictive and sanguinary Nero have spared the life of a woman whose family he detested particularly when other females were put to death for their share in the conspiracy That Atilla was not in that  number the Historian himself informs us in the following remarkable sentence Atilla mater Annaei Lucani sine absolutione sine supplicio dissimulata thus translated by Gordon  "The information against Atilla the mother of Lucan was dissembled and without being cleared she escaped unpunished"  The preceding remarks will I hope vindicate to every candid mind the honour of our Poet whose firmness and intrepidity of character are indeed very forcibly displayed in that picture of his death which Tacitus himself has given us I shall present it to the English reader in the words of GordonLucan  "while his blood issued in streams perceiving his feet and hands to grow cold and stiffen and life to retire by little and little to the extremities while his heart was still beating with vital warmth and his faculties no wise impaired recollected some lines of his own which described a wounded soldier expiring in a manner that resembled this The lines themselves he rehearsed and they were the last words he  ever uttered"  The Annals of Tacitus Book xv  The critics differ concerning the verses of the Pharsalia which the author quoted in so memorable a manner I shall transcribe the two passages he is supposed to have repeated and only add that Lipsius contends for the latter  Sanguis erant lacrymae quaecunque foramina novit  Humor ab his largus manat cruor ora redundant  Et patulae nares sudor rubet omnia plenis  Membra fluunt venis totum est pro vulnere corpus  Lib ix  Now the warm blood at once from every part  Ran purple poison down and drain'd the fainting heart  Blood falls for tears and o'er his mournful face  The ruddy drops their tainted passage trace  Where'er the liquid juices find a way  There streams of blood there crimson rivers stray  His mouth and gushing nostrils pour a flood  And e'en the pores ouze out the trickling blood  In the red deluge all the parts lie drown'd  And the whole body seems one bleeding wound  ROWE  Scinditur avulsus nec sicut vulnere sanguis  Emicuit lentus ruptis cadit undique venis  Discursusque animae diversa in membra meantis  Interceptus aquis  Lib iii v  No single wound the gaping rupture seems  Where trickling crimson wells in slender streams  But from an op'ning horrible and wide  A thousand vessels pour the bursting tide  At once the winding channel's course was broke  Where wand'ring life her mazy journey took  At once the currents all forgot their way  And lost their purple in the azure sea  ROWE  Such was the death of Lucan before he had  completed his twentyseventh year If his character as a man has been injured by the Historian his poetical reputation has been treated not less injuriously by the Critics Quintilian by a frivolous distinction disputes his title to be classed among the Poets and Scaliger says with a brutality of language disgraceful only to himself that he seems rather to  bark  than to  sing  But these insults may appear amply compensated when we remember that in the most polished nations of modern Europe the most elevated and poetic spirits have been his warmest admirers that in France he was idolized by Corneille and in England translated by RoweThe severest censures on Lucan have proceeded from those who have unfairly compared his language to that of Virgil but how unjust and absurd is such a comparison it is comparing an uneven block of porphyry taken rough from the quarry to the most beautiful superficies of polished marble How differently should we think of Virgil as a poet if we possessed only the verses which he  wrote at that period of life when Lucan composed his Pharsalia In the disposition of his subject in the propriety and elegance of diction he is undoubtedly far inferior to Virgil but if we attend to the bold originality of his design and to the vigour of his sentiments if we consider the Pharsalia as the rapid and uncorrected sketch of a young poet executed in an age when the spirit of his countrymen was broken and their taste in literature corrupted it may justly be esteemed as one of the most noble and most wonderful productions of the human mind  NOTE VII VERSE  As Lesbos paid to Pompey's lovely Wife    Pompey after his defeat at Pharsalia proceeded to Lesbos as he had left his wife Cornelia to the protection of that island which received the unfortunate hero with a sublime generosity The Lesbians entreated him to remain amongst them and promised to defend him Pompey expressed  his gratitude for their fidelity but declined the offer and embarked with Cornelia The concern of this gallant people on the departure of their amiable guest is thus described by Lucan  dixit moestamque carinae  Imposuit comitem Cunctos mutare putares  Tellurem patriaeque solum sic litore toto  Plangitur infestae tenduntur in aethera dextrae  Pompeiumque minus cujus fortuna dolorem  Moverat ast illam quam toto tempore belli  Ut civem videre suam discedere cernens  Ingemuit populus quam vix si castra mariti  Victoris peteret siccis dimittere matres  Jam poterant oculis tanto devinxit amore  Hos pudor hos probitas castique modestia vultus  Lib viii v  He ceas'd and to the ship his partner bore  While loud complainings fill the sounding shore  It seem'd as if the nation with her pass'd  And banishment had laid their island waste  Their second sorrows they to Pompey give  For her as for their citizen they grieve  E'en though glad victory had call'd her thence  And her Lord's bidding been the just pretence  The Lesbian matrons had in tears been drown'd  And brought her weeping to their wat'ry bound  So was she lov'd so winning was her grace  Such lowly sweetness dwelt upon her face  ROWE  NOTE VIII VERSE  Let Argentaria on your canvass shine    Polla Argentaria was the daughter of a Roman Senator and the wife of Lucan She is said to have transcribed and corrected the three first books of the Pharsalia after the death of her husband It is much to be regretted that we possess not the poem which he wrote on the merits of this amiable and accomplished woman but her name is immortalized by two surviving Poets of that age The  veneration which she paid to the memory of her husband is recorded by Martial and more poetically described in that pleasing and elegant little production of Statius  Genethliacon Lucani  a poem which I the more readily commend as I may be thought by some readers unjust towards its author in omitting to celebrate his Thebaid I confess indeed the miscellaneous poems of Statius appear to me his most valuable work in most of these there is much imagination and sentiment in harmonious and spirited verse The little poem which I have mentioned on the anniversary of Lucan's birth is said to have been written at the request of Argentaria The Author after invoking the poetical deities to attend the cere  omy touches with great delicacy and spirit on the compositions of Lucan's childhood which are lost and the Pharsalia the production of his early youth he then pays a short compliment to the beauty and talents of Argentaria laments the cruel fate which deprived her so immaturely  of domestic happiness and concludes with the following address to the shade of Lucan  At tu seu rapidum poli per axem  Famae curribus arduis levatus  Qua surgunt animae potentiores  Terras despicis et sepulchra rides  Seu pacis meritum nemus reclusae  Felix Elysiis tenes in oris  Quo Pharsalica turba congregatur  Et te nobile carmen insonantem  Pompeii comitantur et Catones  Tu magna sacer et superbus umbra  Nescis Tartaron et procul nocentum  Audis verbera pallidumque visa  Matris lampade respicis Neronem  Adsis lucidus et vocante Polla  Unum quaeso diem deos silentum  Exores solet hoc patere limen  Ad nuptas redeuntibus maritis  Haec te non thiasis procax dolosis  Falsi numinis induit figuras  Ipsum sed colit et frequentat ipsum  Imis altius insitum medullis  Ac solatia vana subministrat  Vultus qui simili notatus auro  Stratis praenitet excubatque somno  Securae Procul hinc abite mortes  Haec vitae genitalis est origo  Cedat luctus atrox genisque manent  Jam dulces lacrymae dolorque festus  Quicquid fleverat ante nunc adoret  But you O whether to the skies  On Fame's triumphant car you rise  Where mightier souls new life assume  And mock the confines of the tomb  Or whether in Elysium blest  You grace the groves of sacred rest  Where the Pharsalian heroes dwell  And as you strike your Epic shell  The Pompeys and the Catos throng  To catch the animating song  Of Tartarus the dread controul  Binds not your high and hallow'd soul  Distant you hear that wailing coast  And see the guilty Nero's ghost  Grow pale with anguish and affright  His mother flashing on his sight  Be present to your Polla's vows  While to your honour'd name she bows  One day let your entreaties gain  From those who rule the shadowy train  Their gates have op'd to bless a wife  And given a husband back to life  In you the tender Fair invites  No fancied god with frantic rites  You are the object of her prayers  You in her inmost heart she bears  And stampt on mimic gold your head  Adorns the faithful mourner's bed  And sooths her eyes before they close  The guardian of her chaste repose  Away with all funereal state  From hence his nobler life we date  Let Mourning change the pang severe  To fond Devotion's grateful tear  And festal grief its anguish o'er  What it lamented now adore  I cannot close this note without observing that the preceding verses have a strong tendency to prove that Lucan was perfectly innocent in regard to the accusation which I have examined before Had he been really guilty of basely endangering the life of his mother it is not probable that his wife would have honoured his memory with such enthusiastic veneration or that Statius in verses designed to do him honour would have alluded to  the mother  of Nero The Reader will pardon my recurring to this subject as it is pleasing to make use of every argument which may remove so odious and unjust a stain from a manly and exalted character  END OF THE THIRD VOLUME
