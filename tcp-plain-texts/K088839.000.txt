this Oc∣casion not so much to  protect  my  Book  as to  complete  my  Argument  I HAVE ventured to criticize the Works of a very celebrated Writer who took it into his Head to oppose the solid Wis∣dom of the  Gospel  by the Visi∣ons of  false Philosophy  As His at best is but the Cause of  Wit  and  Eloquence  all the Sup∣port he could give it was only to tell us  how  PLATO  wrote  Mine

Characteristics  beyond that of most other Books to be idolized by one Party and detested by another While the first regard it as a Work of  perfect Ex∣cellence  as containing every Thing that can render Mankind wise and happy the lat∣ter are disposed to rank it among the most pernicious of Writings and brand it as one  continued Heap of  Fustian Scurrility  and  Falsehood  THIS Circumstance hath always appeared to me a Demonstration that Passion and Prejudice have had a greater Share than Reason in deciding upon the Merits of this Work which many read with Displeasure more with Admiration but few with im∣partial Judgment 'Tis probable the Truth lies between the two Extremes of these discordant Opinions and that the noble Writer hath mingled Beauties and Blots Faults and Excellencies with a liberal and unsparing Hand  THESE so far as they relate to  Religion  and  Morals  it is my present Intention to point out without Regard to the bigoted Censures of his Friends or Enemies While I foresee that some will  frown  upon me for allowing him any Thing and others treat me with a  contemptuous Smile  for pre∣suming to differ with him at all  THE first Thing that occurs to an unpre∣judiced Mind in the Perusal of the  Cha∣racteristics  is that generous Spirit of  Free∣dom  which shines throughout the whole The noble Author every where asserts that natural Privilege of Man which hath been  so often denied him of seeing with his own Eyes and judging by his own Reason It may possibly appear strange to some why he should so extremely labour a Point so plain But in Justice to his Lordship these Gentlemen must remember or be informed that in former Times some welldesigning Men among ourselves from a groundless Dread of an unlimited Freedom of the Press attempted to make a most unnatural and cruel Separation between  Truth  and  Liberty  Having shaken off the Corrup∣tions of  Popery  and established what they thought a pure and perfect System they un∣happily stopped short in their full Carrier of Glory preposterously attempting to deprive others of that common Privilege which they had so nobly exercised themselves This mistaken Spirit seemed entirely subdued by the excellent LOCKE and others about the Time of the Revolution But at the Period when our noble Author wrote it not only revived but was heightened by a terrible Accession of Bitterness and Rancour Hence those frequent Sallies of Invective which he throws out against this intolerant Principle which he justly stigmatizeth as equally im∣politic irrational and unchristian  'TIS the Glory of our Days that this ac∣cursed Spirit of Persecution is at least dying away What Pity that we cannot add it is wholly extinguished It is true we most of us profess ourselves Friends to a Free∣dom of Inquiry  in the Main  But why  in the Main  Why that needless Circumstance of Hesitation Would we embrace Error Or do we think that Truth can suffer by the most rigid Scrutiny On the contrary not only the Perfection but the very Being of Knowledge depends on the Exercise of Freedom For whatever some may fear from an open and unlimited Enquiry it seems evidently the only Means vouch∣safed us for the Attainment of Truth The  Abuse  of it may be  hurtful  but the  Want  of it is  fatal  Such indeed are the clear and undoubted Principles of our Religion Nei∣ther sure can these Declarations surprize us For if human and political Establishments had been sacred or unviolable where had been our  Protestantism  nay where our  Christianity  Dare we then to desert or dis∣countenance a Principle on which not only the Purity but the very Existence of our Religion depends Nor is this Principle less consonant with the strictest Reason It  is Falsehood only that loves and retires into Darkness Truth delights in the Day and demands no more than a just Light to ap∣pear in perfect Beauty A rigid Exami∣nation is its only Test For Experience hath taught us that even  Obstinacy  and  Error  can endure the  Fires  of Persecution But it is genuine Truth and that alone which comes out pure and  unchanged  from the  severer Tortures  of Debate  IT will ever be our truest Praise there∣fore to join the noble Apologist in his En∣comiums on  Freedom  the only permanent Basis on which  Religion  or  Virtue  can be established Nor can we less approve his frequent Recommendations of  Politeness Chearfulness  and  Goodhumour  in the Pro∣secution of our most important Enquiries The morose contemptuous and surly Species of Composition is generally an Appendage to Bigotry as appears in Instances innu∣merable both among the mistaken Friends and Enemies of Religion On the con∣trary the amiable Qualities of Chearful∣ness and Goodhumour cast a Kind of Sun∣shine over a Composition and naturally en∣gage us in Favour of the Writer They resemble that gentle Smile that often lights  up the human Countenance the neverfailing Indication of a humane Temper How naturally then must we be disposed to listen how open our Minds to receive Con∣viction when we perceive our Opponent's Intention is benevolent When we perceive that his Aim is not  Victory  but  Informa∣tion  that he means not to  insult  but to  instruct  us  SO far out of an unfeigned Regard to Truth it should be my Boast to take Party with the noble Writer On the same Prin∣ciple it will now be necessary to depart from him For not content with establishing the free Exercise of Reason and the Way of Chearfulness in treating the Subjects of Religion and Morals he revolts from the Principle on which the rational Advocates for Religion were willing to have joined him and appeals to a new Test  the Test of Ridicule  This in his two first Treatises he attempts to establish as a surer Method of Conviction And  that  Ridicule which had hitherto been employed in  disgracing known Falsehood  he informs us may be suc∣cessfully applied to the  Investigation  of  un∣known Truth  HE hath gained a numerous Train of Followers in this new Opinion It may be therefore necessary to examine its Foun∣dations  SECTION II  'TIS great Pity the noble Author hath not condescended to a little more  Precision  in treating the Question now before us He indulges the Gaiety of Spirit the Freedom of  Wit  and  Humour  so far that a Reader who seeks Information rather than Amuse∣ment is often at a Loss to know where his Argument or even his Opinion lies This no doubt was in Part owing to a generous Abhorrence of  Pedantry  which he takes all Occasions of exposing to Contempt Yet a better Reason may possibly be alledged For in recommending and enforcing the  Use of Ridicule  what could be more natural and proper than the  Power of Ridicule  itself To draw a striking Picture of demure Folly and solemn Imposture was a Masterpiece of Prudence But to have argued  seriously  would have destroyed his Argument It would have been a tacit Confession that there is a deeper Foundation on which  Ridicule itself must rest he must there∣fore have overturned even while he intend∣ed to establish this new Pillar and  Ground of Truth  HERE then we discover why the noble Author is so witty in Defence of Wit and chuses to maintain the Cause of Raillery by Raillery itself He smiles at his Adversary who had attempted to find Coherence in his first Letter  Vol iii p  He glories in being an Adventurer in the Way of  Miscellany  where  "Cuttings and Shreds of Learning with various Fragments and Points of Wit are drawn together and tacked in any fantastic Form Where the Wild and Whimsical under the Name of the Odd and Pretty succeed in the Room of the Graceful and Beautiful Where Just∣ness and Accuracy of Thought are set aside as too constraining and of too painful an Aspect to be endured in the agreeable and more easy Commerce of Gallantry and modern Wit  Ibid p c  "  Hence with Reason he proceeds to his Conclusion that  "Grounds and Foundations are of no Moment in a Kind of Work which ac∣cording  to modern Establishment has pro∣perly neither  Top  nor  Bottom Beginning  nor  End  Vol iii p  "  IT must be confessed that in the Con∣duct of the literary Warfare they who de∣pend on the Regularity and Force of  Argu∣ments  have but a sorry Chance against these nimble Adventurers in the  Sallies  of Wit and Ridicule these  Hussars  in Dis∣putation who confide more in their Agi∣lity than Strength or Discipline and by sudden  Evolutions  and timely  Skulking  can do great Mischiefs without receiving any Ill qualified indeed is the  saturnine  Com∣plexion of the dry  Reasoner  to cope with this  mercurial  Spirit of modern  Wit  The Formalist is under a double Difficulty not only to  conquer  his Enemy but to  find  him Though it must be owned the Search is a harder Task than the  Victory  and more mortifying as it ends in shewing us that this redoubted Figure of  Ridicule  armed at all Points like  Reason  is no other than an airy Phantom tricked up by the Goddess of Folly to confound formal Wisdom as that other in the Poet to mislead his Hero  Tum dea nube cava  tenuem sine viribus umbram  In faciem Aeneae visu mirabile monstrum  Dardaniis ornat telis  clypeumque jubasque  Divini  assimilat  capitis  dat  inania verba  Dat  sine mente sonum  gressusque effingit euntis  Illum autem absentem Aeneas in praelia poscit  Tunc levis haud ultra  latebras  jam  quaerit  imago  Sed sublime volans  nubi  se  immiscuit  atrae  Virg Aen x ℣ c    SINCE therefore the noble Writer de∣clines treating this Subject in the Way of close Argument we must take our Chance with him upon the Terms he hath been pleased to prescribe We must be content to go a  Gleaning  for his Opinions and  pick them up  as they lie thinly scattered through a wide Extent of Pages  BUT however his Lordship's high Qua∣lity may exempt him from the established Forms of Argument it were the Height of Imprudence in Writers of inferior Rank to attempt an Imitation of his peculiar Man∣ner His delicate Raillery therefore will best be repayed by sober Reasoning This sure his most zealous Admirers cannot take amiss It is the noble Author's allowed Maxim that  "a Jest which will not bear a serious Examination is certainly false Wit  Vol i p  "  Neither was he a Stranger to  the methodical Species of Composition As appears from that fine Chain of moral Rea∣soning which connects his Enquiry concern∣ing Virtue Where he proceeds through the Work with a Pace equally regular and ma∣jestic Indeed should we form our Idea of him from the Attitudes in which his sorry Mimics present him to our View we should see him labouring through a con∣fused Mass of Words and random Halfmeanings entangled in his own Argument and throwing himself into every unnatural and awkward Posture to make his Way though in vain into common Sense But this is a very bad Picture of our noble Au∣thor Though it be all his affected Ad∣mirers can exhibit of him in their own Productions Deformities are easily copied True Features and graceful Attitudes are caught by the Hand of a  Master  only For in Reality none ever knew the Value of Order and Proportion better than Lord SHAFTESBURY He knew that Confusion can only tend to  disgrace  Truth or  disguise  Falsehood Method indeed may dege∣nerate into Stiffness but to despise Order is the silliest  Affectation  Especially when the slovenly and consused Form of the Com∣position  if it may be properly said to have any pretends to the Character of  Elegance  it becomes of all others the grossest and most  contemptible Pedantry  SECTION III  THE divine Author of our Being having given us several different Powers  Sense Ima∣gination Memory  and  Reason  as the Inlets Preservers and Improvers of Knowledge it may be proper here briefly to remark their respective Provinces As the  Senses  are the Fountains whence we derive all our Ideas so these are infinitely combined and asso∣ciated by the  Imagination Memory  preserves these Assemblages of Things  Reason  com∣pares distinguishes and separates them By this Means determining their Differences and pointing out which are  real  and which  fictitious  THE  Passions  are no more than the se∣veral Modes of Pleasure and Pain to which the Author of Nature hath wisely subjected us for our own and each others Preser∣vation  Love Hope and Joy fair Pleasure's smiling Train  Hate Fear and Grief the Family of Pain  To these we may add two more of a mixed Kind  Pity  and  Contempt  which seem to partake of both Pain and Pleasure  AS the  Senses  and  Imagination  are the Sources of all our Ideas it follows that they are the Sources of all our Modes of Plea∣sure and Pain That is of all our  Passions  Nor is any Passion  strongly excited  in the Soul by mere Knowledge only till the  Ima∣gination  hath formed to itself some Kind of  Picture  or  Representation  of the Good or Evil apprehended Thus ARISTOTLE just∣ly defines Fear to be a Kind of Pain arising from the  Phantasy  or  Appearance  of future Evil  Arist Rhet ii c  Consistently with this he again truly observes that though all Men know they must die yet while  Death  is at a Distance they never think of it  Ib ii c  The same may be observed concerning the Be∣lief of  future Existence  which never sways the Conduct of Mankind till the  Imagi∣nation  is strongly  impressed  by steady and repeated Contemplation  AS therefore it appears to be the Pro∣vince of  Sense  and  Imagination  to present and associate Ideas but not to mark their real Differences and as the Passions are al∣ways excited according to the Suggestions of these two powers it follows that  ap∣parent  not  real  Good and Evil are univer∣sally the Objects of all our Passions Thus the respective Objects of Joy Fear An∣ger are apparent Good apparent Danger apparent Injury Universally whether the Object be real or fictitious while it is  ap∣parent  that is while the Imagination re∣presents it as  real  it will produce its rela∣tive Passion  IT is the Province of  Reason  alone to  correct  the Passions Imagination and Pas∣sion can never correct themselves Every Assemblage of Ideas every Impression made upon them hath an Object  apparently real  Therefore without the Aids of  Reason  the  active  and  separating  Power the Mind can never distinguish  real  from  fictitious  Objects And as it is the Province of Reason only thus to regulate the Senses and Imagination and to determine when they impress a Truth or suggest a Falsehood so it is no less the Province of the same corrective Power to  determine concerning the Modes of  appa∣rent  Good and Evil and thus to fix both our  Opinions  and  Passions  on their proper Objects  Some of these Truths are both finely and philosophi∣cally expressed by our great Poet in the following Pas∣sage  But know that in the Soul  Are many lesser Faculties that serve  Reason as chief Among these Fancy next  Her Office holds Of all external Things  Which the five watchful Senses represent  She forms Imaginations aery Shapes  Which Reason joining or disjoining frames  All what we affirm or what deny and call  Our Knowledge or Opinion  Parad Lost  B v ℣ c    UPON this just Dependance of Imagi∣nation and Passion on the superior and lead∣ing Faculty of Reason the whole Weight of this Question concerning the Application and Use of  Ridicule  depends But that we may obtain as wide a View as possible of our Subject it may be proper to ascertain the Nature Limits and Ends of the different Kinds of literary Composition which take their Rise from these three different Powers as they subsist in Man Thus we shall dis∣cover to which of them  the Way of Ridi∣cule  is to be referred and determine how far  it  may  or  may not  with Propriety be re∣garded as a  Test of Truth  PERHAPS there is no Species of Writing except only that of mere  Narration  but what will fall under the Denomination of  Poetry Eloquence  or  Argument  The first lays hold of the Imagination the second through the Imagination seizes the Passions the last addresseth itself to the Reason of Mankind The immediate  essential  End therefore of Poetry is to  please  of Elo∣quence to  persuade  of Argument to  instruct  To this End the Poet dwells on such Images as are  beautiful  the Orator selects every Circumstance that is  affecting  the Philosopher only admits what is  true  But as all these in their several Kinds of Writ∣ing address themselves to  Man  who is compounded of  Imagination Passion  and  Reason  so they seldom confine themselves to their respective Provinces but lay hold of each others Art the more effectually to gain Admission and Success to their own Yet still the  Masters  in these various Kinds of Composition know how to keep their several Boundaries  distinct  not to make un∣warrantable Inroads into each others Pro∣vinces nor remove those Lines which Na∣ture  hath prescribed But so to limit their Excursions that the Intelligent may always know what is designed a  Poem  an  Oration  or an  Argument  Would it not carry us too far from our Subject it might perhaps be both a new and pleasing Speculation to point out the Writers in these several Kinds who have been most remarkably  excellent  or  defective  with Regard to  this just Union of these three Species of Com∣position  At present it must suffice to have hinted such a Criticism which the Reader may easily prosecute    THUS the judicious Poet though his im∣mediate and universal Aim is beautiful Imi∣tation yet in order to become more  pleasing  endeavours often to be  interesting  always to be  rational  His Application being made to  Man  should he let loose Imagination to its random Flights he must shock the  Rea∣son  of every penetrating Observer Hence appears the Necessity of cultivating that Maxim in poetical Composition which the two best of  French  Critics  Boileau  and  Bou∣hours  have so much insisted on  "that all poetical Beauty must be founded in Truth  Que si on me demande ce que c'est que cet agré∣ment et ce felà mon avis il consiste principalement à ne jamais presenter au lecteur que des  pens  s vrais  et des  expressions justes  Oeuvres de Boileau  tom i  Pref  p  Car enfin pour vous dire un peu par ordre ce quc je pense la dessu  la verité  est la premiere qualité et com∣me le fondement des pensées les plus belles sont viti∣euses ou plutot celles qui passent pour belles et qui semblent l'etre ne le sont pas en effet si ce fonds leur manque  Bouhours Man de bien pens  p  "  Because in the unlimited Ex∣cursions of Fancy though one Faculty should approve yet another is disgusted  Though Imagination  acquiesce  in false Beauty Reason will  reject  it with Disdain Thus although the primary and essential End of Poetry is to  please  by Imitation yet as it is addressed to Man  Instruction  makes a necessary though an  adventitious  Part of its Character  Hence the Debate mentioned by  Strabo  l i be∣tween  Eratosthenes  and some of the  Ancients  may easily be decided The first insisting that  Pleasure  the other that  Instruction  was the only End of  Poetry  They were both wrong as it appears that these two Ends must always be united in some Degree However  Eratosthenes  was nearer the Truth as he alledged the  essential  End 'Tis no bad Description given by Mr  Dryden  and others of the End of Poetry that it is  "to  instruct  by  pleasing  "  Though upon the whole it throws more Weight on the Circumstance of  In∣struction  than the Thing will bear The Admirers of Lord  S  who love pompous Declamation may see a great deal said on this Subject and with little Precision in  Strada's  Third Prolusion    FROM this View of Things we may in passing further see the  Nature Limits  and  comparative Excellence  of the various Kinds of Poetry The  Descriptive  holds entirely  of the Imagination and may be termed  pure Poetry  or Imitation Yet with regard to the  secondary  End of Instruction it seems to merit only the lowest Place because it is then perfect when it satisfies the Imagina∣tion and while it offends not Reason or the Affections nothing further with regard to these Faculties is expected from it The  Tragic Comic Satiric  and the  Elegy  as they chiefly regard the  Passions  and the Heart of Man so they draw much of their Force from the Sources of  Eloquence  On the other hand the  Didactic  as it makes its chief Application to Reason though it re∣tains so much of the Graces of Imagi∣nation as to merit the Name of Poetry is principally of the  logical  Species The  Epic  by its great Extent includes all these Kinds by turns and is therefore the  noblest  both in its  primary  and  secondary  Intention Much indeed hath been occasionally asserted by several Writers concerning the superior Dignity of the  tragic  Species  Thus the excellent Mr  Addison  "A perfect Tra∣gedy is the noblest Production of humane Nature"  Spectator  N  o    But this hath been more in the Way of Assirmation than Proof Their Opinion seems to have  been founded on a mistaken Interpretation of ARISTOTLE whose supposed Authority on this Subject hath generally passed un∣questioned But whoever shall thoroughly examine the Sentiments of the  grand Master  will find he only meant to assert that the  Mode of Imitation  in  Tragedy  is more forci∣ble and therefore superior to that of the  epic  Kind because in the  last  the Action is only  told  in the former it is  visibly repre∣sented  This is the Truth But if we con∣sider not the  Mode  of Imitation but the  Subjects  imitated if we consider the com∣parative  Greatness  of the Action which these two Kinds of Poetry can comprehend and the moral Ends of  Instruction  no less than the Variety and Beauty of  Description  which constitutes the very Essence of Poe∣try we shall find the Epic greatly superior on account of the Extent and Importance of those  Actions  and the Variety of  Cha∣racters  which it is capable of involving Thus for Instance such an Action as the Death of OEDIPUS or CATO may be more perfectly imitated because  visibly  repre∣sented in Tragedy than in the Epos But a much greater and more extensive Action such as the  Establishment of an Empire  with  all its subordinate Episodes religious poli∣tical and moral cannot be comprehended or exhibited in  Tragedy  while yet they may be perfectly described in the  Epopée  SO much concerning  Poetry  will be found to have Relation to our Subject But as the Question concerning  Ridicule  will turn chiefly on the proper Subordination of  Elo∣quence  it will be necessary to consider this Kind of Composition in a more particular Manner  ELOQUENCE then is no other than a Species of Poetry applied to the particular End of Persuasion For Persuasion can only be effected by rowzing the Passions of the Soul and these we have seen are only to be moved by a Force impressed on the Ima∣gination assuming the Appearance of Truth which is the essential Nature of poetical Composition Thus the Lord VERULAM  "In all Persuasions that are wrought by Eloquence and other Impression of like Nature which paint and disguise the true Appearance of Things the chief Recom∣mendation unto  Reason  is from the  Ima∣gination  De Aug Scient ii  "  And the judicious  Strabo  consistently with this Theory tells us that  in Fact  "the oratorial Elocution was but an Imitation of the poetical This ap∣peared first and was approved They who imitated it took off the Measures but still preserved all the other Parts of Poetry in their Writings Such were CADMUS the Milesian PHERECYDES and HECATAEUS Their Followers then took something more from what was left and at length Elocution descended into the Prose which is now among us  Strabo lib i    THUS as the Passions must have an  ap∣parent Object  of Good or Evil offered by the Imagination in order to excite them so Eloquence must offer  apparent Evidence  ere it can be received and acquiesced in For the Mind cannot embrace known False∣hood So that every Opinion which Elo∣quence instills though it be the pure Result of certain fictitious Images impressed on the Fancy is always regarded as the Result of rational Conviction and received by the Mind as Truth  HENCE we may perceive the just Foun∣dation of the wellknown Maxim in rheto∣rical Composition  Artis est celare artem  In every other Art where the End is Plea∣sure Instruction or Admiration the greater Art the Master displays the more effectu∣ally he gains his Purpose But where the End is Persuasion the Discovery of his Art must defeat its Force and Design For ere he can persuade he must seem to apply to his Hearer's  Reason  while in Fact he is working on his Imagination and Affections Now this once known must defeat his Purpose because nothing can persuade but what has the  Appearance of Truth  HENCE too we may see where the true Medium lies between the too frequent  Use  and delicate  Avoidance  of poetical Images in Eloquence Metaphors Similies bold Figures and glowing Expressions are pro∣per so far as they point the Imagination to the main Subject on which the Passion is to be excited When they begin to  amuse  they grow absurd And here by the way lies the essential Difference between the  Epic  and  Tragic  Composition For the  Epic  tending chiefly to Admiration and In∣struction allows a full Display of Art But  the  Tragic  being of the persuasive Kind must only regard and touch upon poetical Images in this single View  as they tend to rowze the Passions of the Soul  MACRO∣BIUS  Saturnal iv passim  hath collected many elegant Exam∣ples of this  poctic Elocution  from the  Eneid  He hath ranged them in Classes and pointed out the Fountains whence the great Poet drew his  Pathos  And sure it may with Truth be affirmed that  "the Master∣strokes of that divine Work are rather of the  Tragic  than the  Epic  Species"  THESE Remarks will enable us to disco∣ver the Impropriety of an Opinion com∣monly held  See Mr Hume's Essay on Eloquence    "that the Reason why Elo∣quence had such Power and wrought such Wonders in  Athens  and  Rome  was because it had become the general Taste and Study of the Times That conse∣quently these Cities were more sensible to its Charms and therefore more warmly affected by it"  Now though with re∣gard to pure  Poetry  or strict  Argument  where either Pleasure or Truth are the pur∣posed Ends this Reasoning might hold yet when applied to  Eloquence  it seems to  be without Foundation For where  Igno∣rance  is predominant  there  any Application to the Fancy or the Passions is most likely to wear the Appearance of Reason and therefore the most likely to persuade As Men improve in Knowledge such Appli∣cation must proportionably lose its Force and true Reasoning prevail Hence it should seem that they who make the constituent Principles of Eloquence familiar to their Imagination must of all others be best ena∣bled to separate  Truth  from its  Appearances  and distinguish between  Argument  and  Co∣louring  An artful Oration will indeed af∣ford great Pleasure to one who hath applied himself to the Study of Rhetoric Yet not so as that he shall be  persuaded  by it On the contrary his Pleasure consists in a reflex Act of the Understanding and arises from the very Circumstance which prevents Per∣suasion a  Discovery of the Master's Art  THE true Reason therefore why Elo∣quence gained such mighty Power in these famed Republics was  "because the Ora∣tors addressed themselves to the  People  as their  Judges  "  Here the Art triumphed for it had not  Reason  to instruct but  Imagi∣nation  and  Passion  to controul According∣ly  we find that no sooner was the popular Government destroy'd and the supreme Power lodged in a single Hand than Elo∣quence began sensibly to languish and de∣cay The mighty Orators who could sway the Passions of a mixed Multitude found their Art baffled and overthrown when op∣posed to the cool Determinations of cunning Ministers or the determined Will of arbi∣trary Masters Thus with great Judgment though not much Honesty the  Roman  Poet exhorts his Countrymen to disdain the low Accomplishments of Eloquence He knew they belonged to a Republic  Excudent alii spirantia mollius aera  Orabunt causas melius  Tu regere imperio populos Romane me∣mento  Hae tibi crunt artes  Eneïd vi    With the same Penetration he lays the Scene in a  popular Assembly  when he gives us a Picture of Eloquence triumphant I mean in that sine Passage where he com∣pares NEPTUNE  stilling the Noise of the Waves  to an  Orator appeasing the Madness of the People  Ac veluti  magno in populo  cum saepe coorta est  Seditio saevitque animis  ignobile vulgus  Jamque saces et saxa volant furor arma mi∣nistrat  Tum pietate gravem ac meritis si forte virum quem  Conspexere silent  arrectisque auribus astant  Ille  regit dictis animos  et pectora mulcet  Sic cunctus pelagi cecidit fragor  En i    'Tis true we have a supposed Instance on Record of the Power of TULLY's Elo∣quence after Liberty was destroy'd even on the great  Destroyer  himself When we read the Oration  Pro Ligario  we stand amazed at its Effects For sure there is nothing  equal  to them in the Composition itself And it ap∣pears an Event almost unaccountable that CESAR who was himself an accomplished Orator who knew all the Windings of the Art and was at the same Time of the most determined Spirit should be so shaken on this Occasion as to tremble drop his Papers and acquit the Prisoner Though many have attributed this to the Force of TUL∣LY's  Elocution  Casaubon Sir W Temple Mr Hume c  it seems rather to have been the Effect of CESAR's  Art  We  know with what unwearied Application he courted CICERO's Friendship he saw where his Vanity and his Weakness lay With perfect Address therefore he play'd back the Orator's Art upon himself His concern was  feigned  and his Mercy  artificial  as he knew that nothing could so effectually win TULLY to his Party as giving him the Pride of having  conquered  CESAR  BUT whatever of Truth there may be in this Conjecture so much is evident that the Scene where alone Eloquence can work its mighty Effects is that of a  popular As∣sembly  An absolute Monarchy quencheth it at once Nor can public Freedom itself give it any considerable Play where the public Freedom hath any firmer Basis than that of a mere Democracy For where the Councils of a Nation depend on the united Reason of elected Representatives or wise and cunning Statesmen though the laboured Essays of Eloquence may often  amuse  they will seldom  determine  This seems to be the Case of our own Age and Country And were it necessary to enlarge on this Subject it might be made appear that they who complain of the Decay of public Elo∣quence among us assign a Cause which hath  no real Existence when they attribute that Decay to a Neglect of the Art  See Mr Hume's Essay on Eloquence  while in Fact it necessarily arises from the ruling Principles of the Times and the Nature of our Constitution  THUS Eloquence gains its End of Per∣suasion by offering  apparent  Truth to the Imagination as Argument gains its proper End of Conviction by offering  real  Truth to the Understanding Mr HOBBES seems to have been well aware of this Distinction  "This says he  viz  laying Evidence be∣fore the Mind is called  teaching  the Hearer is therefore said to  learn  But if there be not such Evidence then such teaching is called  Persuasion  and beget∣teth no more in the Hearer than what is in the Speaker's  bare Opinion  Hobbes on Hum Nature  "  HERE then we perceive that the Conse∣quences of Eloquence with regard to spe∣culative  Instruction  and  Inquiry  are of a very different Nature from those which relate to  Morals  and  Action  To Instruction or In∣quiry every Species of Eloquence must for ever be an Enemy For though it may lead the Mind to acquiesce in a just Opinion yet  it leads it to acquiesce upon a false Foun∣dation It puts the Hearer or Reader in the Speaker's or Writer's Power And though he be so honest as to lead him in the Path of Truth yet still he leads him  blindfold  In this Sense and under this Limitation Mr LOCKE's Remark is true  "We must allow that all the Art of Rhetoric besides Order and Clearness all the artificial and figurative Application of Words Elo∣quence hath invented are for nothing else but to  insinuate wrong  Ideas  move the Passions  and  thereby mislead  the Judgment and so indeed are perfect Cheats  Locke on Hum Und  "  But if we regard what is of more Im∣portance to Man than mere speculative Truth I mean the  practical Ends  of hu∣man Life and moral Action then Elo∣quence assumes a higher Nature Nor is there in this practical Sense any ne∣cessary Connexion between  moving  the Passions and  misleading  the Judgment For though the Ends of Truth and Persuasion are then essentially different when the Ora∣tor strikes the Imagination with fictitious Images in which case Falsehood becomes apparent Truth and Eloquence the Instru∣ment  of Deceit yet the Ends of Persuasion and Conviction Opinion and Knowledge  concur  when such Impressions are made on the Imagination and Passions as consist with the Dictates of right Reason In this case Eloquence comes in to the Aid of Argu∣ment and  impresses  the Truths which Lo∣gic teaches in a warmer and more effectual Manner It paints real Good and Evil in all the glowing Colours of Imagination and thus inflames the Heart with double Ardor to embrace the one and reject the other  NAY so far is Eloquence from being the universal Instrument of practical Deceit that on the contrary it should seem the  moral  is more natural than the  immoral  Ap∣plication of it Because ere the dishonest Application can take place Circumstances must be wrested and Misrepresentations imposed on the Fancy in Opposition to Truth and Reason Whereas in the proper Application nothing further is necessary than to draw out and impress those Images and Analogies of Things which really exist in Nature  IT may be further observed that as Elo∣quence is of a vague unsteady Nature  merely relative to the Imaginations and Pas∣sions of Mankind so there must be several Orders or Degrees of it subordinate to each other in Dignity yet each perfect in their Kind The common  End  of each is Per∣suasion The  Means  are different according to the various Capacities Fancies and Af∣fections of those whom the Artist attempts to persuade The pathetic Orator who throws a  Congregation  of  Enthusiasts  into Tears and Groanings would raise Affections of a very different Nature should he at∣tempt to proselyte an  English Parliament  As on the other hand the finest Speaker that ever commanded  the House  would in vain point the Thunder of his Eloquence on a  Quakermeeting  So again with re∣gard to the Oratory if it may be called so of the  Bar  at a  Country Assize  for the higher Courts of Justice admit not Elo∣quence it is easy to observe what a different Tour the learned Council takes in ad∣dressing himself to the  Judge  or  Jury  He is well aware that what passes with the  one  for  Argument  of Proof would be derided by the  other  as pastboard  Declamation  This Difference in the Kind with respect to the Eloquence of the  Pulpit  is no less remark∣able  in different Countries Thus the very agreeable and sensible VOLTAIRE observes that  "in  France where Reasoning hath lit∣tle Connexion with Religion  a Sermon is a long Declamation spoken with Rapture and Enthusiasm That in  Italy where Taste and Vertú give a Tincture to Super∣stition itself  a Sermon is a Kind of de∣votional Comedy That in  England where Religion submits to Reason  it is a solid Dissertation  sometimes a dry one  which is read to the Congregation without Action or Elocution  The Passage in the Original is thus  "Un sermon en France est une longue declamation scrupuleuse∣ment divisée en trois points et recitée avec enthou∣siasme En Angleterre un sermon est une dissertation solide  et quelquesois seche  qu'un homme lit au peu∣ple sans geste et sans aucune eclat de voix En Ita∣lie c'est une comedie spirituelle"  "  And he justly concludes that the Discourse which raiseth a French Audience to the highest Pitch of Devotion would throw an  English  one into a Fit of Laughter  HENCE too and hence alone we may account for a Fact which however seem∣ingly improbable is too wellknown to be doubted of  "That although in  France  the applauded Pulpit Eloquence is of the  Enthusiastic  in  England  of the severe and  rational  Species yet the Taste of these two Nations in Tragedy or  Theatrical Eloquence  is mutually  reversed  The  English  are Enthusiastic the  French  se∣vere and rational"  Now though this Fact may carry the Appearance of Self∣contradiction yet on the Principle here laid down the known Circumstances of the two Kingdoms will explain it sufficiently In  England  a general Spirit of  Reasoning  and Enquiry hath extinguished the natural En∣thusiasms of the human Mind in  religious Subjects  while our unrestrained Warmth of Imagination and habitual Reverence for the noble Irregularities of SHAKESPEAR concur to make us despise the rigid Laws of the Stage On the contrary in  France  the Severities of the  Academy  have utterly quenched the high Tragic Spirit while as yet  religious Criticism  hath made but little Progress among the Subjects of the  most Christian King  IN further Proof of this Principle we may appeal to ancient Fact To the Pro∣gress of Eloquence in  Greece  There we find it first appeared decked in all the glow∣ing Colours of Poetry afterwards in an  Age of more polished Manners and exten∣sive Knowledge when the Rhetors at∣tempted to carry this Kind of Eloquence to a still higher Degree they found the Times would not bear it They were baffled in their Attempt As succeeding Ages grew more knowing they grew more fastidious and refined The Orators were obliged gradually to lower and bring down Elo∣quence from its high Standard Till at length it gained a Form and Character en∣tirely new as we find it in XENOPHON's chastised Manner of  Attic  Elegance  See the Passage quoted above from Strabo p §    TO conclude with one Proof more in Fa∣vour of this Principle It appears that these different Kinds were acknowledged suffici∣ently in ancient  Rome  though the true Distinction between them seems not to have been thoroughly perceived unless by TULLY himself The correct and  Attic  Species having gained a Number of Ad∣mirers under the Patronage of SALLUST who first encouraged it in  Rome  Sic  Sallustio  vigente amputatae sententiae et verba ante expectatum cadentia et obscura brevitas fuere pro cultu  Senec Epist  many  were the Debates concerning the superior Force and Propriety of  this  or the more  elevated Manner  The Patrons of the  Attic  Style derided CICERO as being  loose tumid  and  exuberant  Constat nec Ciceroni quidem obtrectatores defuisse quibus inflatus et tumens nec satis pressus supra mo∣dum exultans et superfluens et  parum Atticus  videretur  Dialog apud Tacit  On the contrary he too had his Partizans who despised the calm and correct Species as void of Energy and Power  Mihi falli multum videntur qui solos esse Atticos cre∣dunt tenues et lucidos et significantes sed quadam elo∣quentiae frugalitate contentos ac manum semper intra pallium continentes  Quintil  Thus by overlooking the  relative  Nature of Eloquence they mutually fell into an Extreme both forgetting that ei∣ther of these Kinds might be of superior Propriety and Force according to the Ima∣ginations Passions and Capacities of those to whom they should be applied But TULLY with a superior Sagacity saw clear∣ly where the true Distinction lay For speaking of CALVUS a Patronizer of the  Attic  Manner he says  "HENCE his Elo∣quence gained a high Reputation among  the Learned and Attentive  but among  the Vulgar  for whom Eloquence was chiefly formed it was of no Esteem  Sed ad  Calvum  revertamurejus oratio nimia re∣ligione attenuata doctis et attente audientibus erat il∣lustris a multitudine autem et à soro cui nata eloquen∣tia est devorabatur  In Brut  "  NOW among these several Kinds of Elo∣quence Justness of Thought and Expression striking Figures Argument adorned with every pathetic Grace are the Characters of the  highest  Sophistry and Buffoonry am∣biguous and dishonest Hints coarse Lan∣guage false and indecent Images are the Characters of the  lowest  Between these two Extremes there lies a Variety of inter∣mediate Kinds each ascending towards the highest in Proportion as they abound with its proper Characters For as the Imagi∣nation and Passions are then most refined and just when they bear to the same Point with Reason so that Species of Eloquence is the noblest which tends to conduct them thither  Les Egyptiens comparoient ceux qui preferent le co∣loris au dessein dans la peinture à ceux qui en matiere d'eloquence et de poesie preferent les pensées brillantes aux pensées justes Ciceron le maitre et le modele de l'eloquence latine a dit en appliquant sa reflexion à l'orateur que nous laissons bientôt des Tableaux qui nous attirent d'abord par la force du coloris au lieu que nous revenons toujours à ceux qui excellent par la beauté du dessein qui est le vrai caractere de l'antique  Sethos ii p  On this Principle and on this  alone we may with Propriety and Precision determine the comparative Excellence and Dignity of those who aspire to the Palm of Eloquence On this Principle it seems to be that a severe but able Judge prefers DEMOSTHENES to TULLY  See Dr Swift's Letter to a Young Clergyman  and on this Principle he deserves the Preference  THUS we are at length arrived at the Point where Eloquence and Argument Persuasion and Conviction unite where the Orator's Art becomes subservient to the In∣terests of  Truth  and only labours to adorn and recommend Her  WE come now to the third Species of Composition that of  Argument  Which applying solely to the Reason of Man and to the Proof or Investigation of Truth is of a more simple and uncompounded Na∣ture in its Principles and therefore needs not to be so particularly explained For Pleasure being the primary End of Poetry and Persuasion that of Eloquence the real Nature of Things is often in Part disguised and compelled to bend to the Imagination  and the Passions But  Truth  being the End of Argument the varying Colours of Ima∣gination and Passion must be drawn off and human Reason itself bend to the real uniform Nature of Things  YET on this Occasion it may be proper to remark that the  rational Faculty  in Man cannot be comprehensive or perfect in its Operations without a Union with a  strong Imagination  And this not only in the Arts of Poetry or Eloquence but in the  severest Investigations  of Truth For Reason alone cannot search out new Ideas but only com∣pare and distinguish those which Sense and Imagination present to her and the Senses being of small Extent Imagination is there∣fore the great universal Instrument of hu∣man Knowledge and human Action With∣out the Aids of Imagination therefore Rea∣son works in a contracted Sphere being destitute of Materials unable to make the necessary Excursions into the Immensity of Nature and wanting that Power which alone can range through the whole Extent of created Being and bring Home all the possible and apparent Analogies of Things setting them before her discerning Eye and submitting them to her sovereign Appro∣bation  or Dislike From this noble Union arises that  boundless Penetration  which so far surpasseth  mere Judgment  and which ac∣cording as it is exerted in Poetry Eloquence Philosophy Morals or Religion strikes into the various and untroden Paths of Nature and Truth forms the distinguished Names of HOMER SHAKESPEAR MILTON DE∣MOSTHENES TULLY ARISTOTLE BACON LOCKE BAYLE PASCAL NEWTON HOOKER BERKLEY WARBURTON giving that essential Superiority and Preheminence which hath ever been first the  Envy  and then the  Admiration  of Mankind  THUS as it appeared above how necessary the Restraints of Reason are to the Per∣fection of Works of Imagination so here it is evident that a full Union of Imagi∣nation is necessary to the perfect Operations of Reason Taken singly they are each  defective  When their Powers are joined they constitute TRUE GENIUS  BUT however requisite the Force of Ima∣gination may be to the Perfection of Rea∣son and the Production of  true Genius  yet still Reason remains the superior and cor∣rective Power Therefore every Repre∣sentation of Poetry or Eloquence which  only apply to the Fancy and Affections must finally be examined and decided upon must be  tried rejected  or  received  as the  rea∣soning Faculty  shall  determine  AND thus REASON alone is the  Detecter of Falsehood  and the TEST OF TRUTH  SECTION IV  HE who would judge aright of the Proportions of a spacious Dome must not creep from one Corner to another by the Help of a glimmering Taper but rather light up a central Branch which may illu∣minate the whole at once By doing some∣thing like this in our Remarks on the three different Kinds of Composition we have enabled the intelligent Reader to see with ease  "That Wit Raillery and Ri∣dicule in every Shape they can possibly assume are no other than so many Species of  Poetry  or  Eloquence  "  PURE  Wit  when not applied to the Cha∣racters of Men is properly a Species of Poe∣try It amuses and delights the Imagi∣nation by those sudden Assemblages and pleasing Pictures of Things which it creates and from every common Occasion can raise  such striking Appearances as throw the most phlegmatic Tempers into a Convulsion of goodhumoured Mirth and  undesigning Laughter  BUT  Ridicule  or  Raillery  which is the Subject of our Inquiry hath a further Scope and Intention It solely regards the Opi∣nions Passions Actions and Characters of Men and may properly be denominated  "that Species of Writing which excites Contempt with Laughter"  STILL more particularly we may ob∣serve that as Eloquence in general is but the Application of Poetry to the End of Persuasion so Ridicule in particular is no more than the Application of that particu∣lar Species of Poetry called Wit to the same End of Persuasion It tends to excite  Con∣tempt  in the same Manner as the other Modes of Eloquence raise Love Pity Ter∣ror Rage or Hatred in the  Heart  of Man  NOW that  Contempt  which certain Ob∣jects raise in the Mind is a particular  Mode of Passion  The Objects of this Passion are apparent  Falsehood Incongruity Impropriety  or  Turpitude  of certain Kinds But as the Object of every excited Passion must be examined by Reason ere we can determine  whether it be proper or improper real or fictitious so every Object that excites Contempt must fall under this general Rule Thus before it can be determined whether our Contempt be  just  Reason alone must  examine  Circumstances separate Ideas distin∣guish Truth from its Appearances decide upon restrain and  correct the Passion  Thus  Ridicule  is no other than a  Species of Eloquence  and accordingly we find it mentioned and expresly treated as such by the best Writers of Antiquity ARISTO∣TLE as in every Subject leads the Way  "As Ridicule seems to be of some Use in  pleading  it was the Opinion of GORGIAS that you ought to confound your Adver∣sary's  serious Argument  by  Raillery  and his  Raillery  by  serious Argument  And he judged well  Arist Rhet iii c  "  Here he first gives the Sentiments of a  Sage  and then con∣firms them by his own Authority  TO offer all that TULLY hath said upon the Subject of Ridicule would be to trans∣cribe a considerable Part of his second Book  De Oratore  After having gone through se∣veral Topics of Rhetoric he comes at length to this of  Ridicule  and assigns to the elder CESAR the Task of explaining the Force and Application of this Art In the Course of his Reasonings on this Subject he affirms First That Ridicule is a Branch of Eloquence  Est autem plane oratoris movere risumRes saepe quas argumentis dilui non facile est joco risuque dissol∣vit    dly  That certain Kinds of Turpitude or Incongruity are its proper Object  Locus autem et regio quasi ridiculi turpitudine qua∣dam et deformitate contineturNec insignis improbi∣tas et scelere juncta nec rursus miseria insignis agitata rideturQuamobrem materies omnis ridiculorum est in istis vitiisquae neque odio magno nec misericordia maxima digna sunt    dly  That the Orator must be temperate in the Application of it  In quo non modo illud praecipitur ne quid insulse sed etiam si quid perridicule possis vitandum'est oratori utrumque ne aut scurrilis jocus sit aut mimicus    thly  That its Force may consist either in Thought or Expression but that its Perfection lies in a Union of both  Duo sunt genera sacetiarum quorum alterum re tractatur alterum dictoNam quod quibuscunque ver∣bis dixeris facetum tamen est  re  continetur quod mutatis verbis salem amittit in verbis habet leporem omnemmaxime autem homines delectari si quando risus conjuncte  re verboque  moveatur  And lastly That af∣ter  all it is but the lowest Kind of Elo∣quence  Est mea sententia vel tenuissimus ingenii fructus  De Oratore  ii  passim    QUINTILIAN builds chiefly on TULLY when he treats of Ridicule in the sixth Book of his Institutions He too considers it as a Branch of Eloquence and gives Rules for its Efficacy and Restraint  Risum judicis movendo et illos tristes solvit affectus et animum ab intentione rerum frequenter avertit et aliquando etiam resicit et à satietate vel à fatigatione re∣novatHabet enim ut  Cicero  dicit sedem in deformi∣tate aliqua et turpitudineRerum autem saepe ut dixi maximarum momenta vertit cum odium iramque fre∣quentissime frangatEa quae dicit vir bonus omnia salva dignitate ac verecundia dicet nimium enim risus pretium est si probitatis impendio constat  Quint Inst  vi    NOW in Consequence of these Proofs a few Observations will naturally arise with regard to  Ridicule in particular  similar to those which were made in the last Section upon  Eloquence in general  AS first Ridicule must render every Pro∣position it supports  apparently true  ere it can be received and acquiesced it Thus every Opinion which Ridicule instills tho' it be the pure Result of certain Images im∣pressed on the Imagination by which the Passion of Contempt is excited is always  regarded as the Conviction of Reason and received by the Mind as Truth And thus by offering apparent Truth Ridicule gains its End of Persuasion  AGAIN it may be observed that the Consequences of Ridicule with regard to  speculative  Instruction or Inquiry are of a very different Nature from those which re∣late to Morals and Action To the first it must ever be an  Enemy  But to the latter it may be an Enemy or Friend according as it is fairly or dishonestly applied It comes in to the Aid of Argument when its Im∣pressions on the Imagination and Passions are consistent with the real Nature of Things When it strikes the Fancy and Af∣fections with fictitious Images it becomes the Instrument of Deceit  THUS Ridicule may befriend either Truth or Falsehood and as it is morally or im∣morally applied may illustrate the one or disguise the other Yet it should seem that the moral is more natural than the immoral Application of Ridicule inasmuch as Truth is more congenial to the Mind than False∣hood and so the  real  more easily made  apparent  than the  sictitious  Images of Things  RIDICULE therefore being of a vague unsteady Nature merely relative to the Imaginations and Passions of Mankind there must be several Orders or Degrees of it suited to the Fancies and Capacities of those whom the Artist attempts to influence Among these several Kinds of Ridicule Justness of Thought and Expression adorn∣ed with striking Figures is the  highest  Coarse Language Buffoonry false and inde∣cent Images are the Characters of the  low∣est  For as the Imagination and Passions are then most refined and just when they bear to the same Point with Reason so that Species of Ridicule is most genuine which tends to conduct them thither  BUT however Ridicule may  impress  the Idea of apparent Turpitude or False∣hood on the Imagination yet still Reason remains the superior and corrective Power Therefore every Representation of Ridi∣cule which only applies to the Fancy and Affections must  finally  be  examined  and  de∣cided  upon must be  tried rejected  or  re∣ceived  as the  reasoning Faculty  shall  deter∣mine  AND thus  Ridicule  can never be a  De∣tector of Falsehood  or a  Test of Truth  SECTION V  IN further Confirmation of these Truths the direct Proofs of which may possibly lie somewhat remote from common Appre∣hension let us appeal to Experience to the general Sense and Practice of Mankind And here we shall find that Contempt and Ridicule are always founded on  preconceived Opinion  whatever be the Foundation of it whether  Reason  or  Imagination Truth  or  Falsehood  FOR in Fact do not we see every diffe∣rent Party and Association of Men despising and deriding each other according to their various Manner of Thought Speech and Action Does not the Courtier deride the Foxhunter and the Foxhunter the Cour∣tier What is more ridiculous to a Beau than a Philosopher to a Philosopher than a Beau Drunkards are the Jest of sober Men and sober Men of Drunkards Phy∣sicians Lawyers Soldiers Priests and Free∣thinkers are the standing Subjects of Ridi∣cule to one another Wisdom and Folly the Virtuous and the Vile the Learned and Ignorant the Temperate and Debauched  all give and return the Jest According to the various Impressions of Fancy and Af∣fection the Aspects of Things are varied and consequently the same Object seen un∣der these different Lights and Attitudes must in one Mind produce  Approbation  in another  Contempt  IF we examine the Conduct of  political  Bodies or  religious  Sects we shall find it of a similar Nature Each of these  railly  every other according to the Prejudices they have imbibed in Favour of their own System How contemptible and ridiculous are the  European  Forms of Government in the Eyes of an  Asiatic  A  Venetian  was introduced to the King of  Pegu  When this Prince was informed by him that the  Vene∣tians  had  no King  he  laughed  so excessively that he lost his Breath and could not speak for a good while  Recueil des Voyages c  And do not we on this Side the  Hellespont  repay them in their own Kind Are we a whit more united among ourselves in our Ideas of the  Ridi∣culous  when applied to Modes of Empire What is more contemptible to an  English∣man  than that slavish Submission to arbi∣trary Will and lawless Power which pre∣vails almost universally on the Continent And they are little acquainted with the State  of Affairs  abroad  who know not that within the Precincts of Tyranny  English Freedom  is one of the commonest Topics of Raillery and Ridicule Every Man's judg∣ing for himself is the Subject of the  French∣man's  Drollery One Man's judging  for all  is the Subject of ours The Case is parallel with regard to religious Tenets where Peo∣ple are at Liberty to speak their Thoughts Is there any Species of Invective which the Church of  Rome  hath not exercised upon all who have dissented from its Measures And have not the Divines of the  reformed  Churches been as arrant  Droles  in Vindi∣cation of their respective Systems What Ribaldry and coarse Banter hath been thrown nay rather what hath  not  been thrown by the  Freethinkers  on Religion and  Christi∣anity  And how basely have some of our Divines prostituted their Pens in former Days by descending to the same dirty Le∣vel Even the Soureness of Puritanism nay the Sullenness of  Quakerism  have sometimes relaxed and yielded themselves up to the Love of  Joking  And sly Hints in demure Phrase and sober Countenance have as plainly spoken their Contempt of those they pitied as the loud Laughter and Grimace  of worldly Men the Disdain of those they profess to hate  BUT what need we wonder that a Diffe∣rence of Opinion in such weighty Affairs as those of Government and Religion should inspire a mutual Contempt when we see that any considerable Variation of Manners in the most ordinary Circumstances of Life has the same Effect The Customs of an∣cient Times have been held so ridiculous by many Moderns that honest HOMER hath been branded as a Dunce only because he hath recorded them What Raillery hath been thrown on the venerable Bard as well as the Hero he describes only because he hath told us that PATROCLUS acted in the Capacity of  Cook  for himself and his Friend  Achilles  Il  And that the Princess  Nausicaa  followed by all her Maids went down to wash the King's and Queen's Cloaths along with her own  Odyss    Rebecca  and her  Histo∣rian  Genesis  have fallen under the same ignorant Censure because she went down  to draw Water  And so have the Daughters of AU∣GUSTUS for spinning their Father's Cloaths  when he was Master of the World Thus the undebauched Simplicity of ancient Times becomes the Jest of modern Luxury and Folly From the same Principle any new Mode of Speech or Action seen in our own Times appears ridiculous to those who give Way to the Sallies of  uninformed  Con∣tempt and Laughter What superior Airs of Mirth and Gayety may be seen in a Club of Citizens passing Judgment on the  Scotch  the  Western  or any other  remote provincial Dialect  while at  the other End of the Town  the Stream of  Ridicule  runs as strong on the Manners and Dialect of the  Ex∣change  The least unusual Circumstance of Habit beyond what the Fashion pre∣scribes is by turns so sensibly ridiculous that one half of the Expence of Dress seems to consist in accommodating it to the Dic∣tates and Caprice of the current Opinion And it is a just Complaint of the greatest Tragic Poet of the Age that this indulged Spirit of Ridicule is a fundamental Ob∣struction to the Improvement of the  French  Theatre  "We dare not says he ha∣zard any thing new upon the Stage in the Presence of a People whose constant  Practice is  to ridicule every thing that is not fashionable  Nous craignons de hazarder sur la scene de specta∣cles nouveaux devant une nation accoutumée à tourner en ridicule tout ce qui n'est pas  d'Usage  Voltaire  Disc sur la trag  "  NEITHER is the Taste of Mankind less capricious with regard to the Methods of Ridicule  Quaenam tandem in loquendo aut in scribendo quasi titillatione risum lacessunt dictum unum aut al∣terum brevicula narratio nonnibil repentinum et fortuitum et recens et novitate sua primum  Vavassor  De ludicra dictione  than the Objects of it How many  Sayings  and  Repartées  are recorded from Antiquity as the Quintessence of Rail∣lery which among  us  only raise a Laugh because they are  insipid  TULLY himself often attempts in vain to extort a Smile from his modern Reader Even the  sales Plautini  have in great Measure lost their  Poignancy  There is a certain  Mode  of Ridicule peculiar to every Age and Country What a curious Contrast to each other are an  Italian  and a  Dutch  Buffoon And I suppose the Raillery of a  French  and a  Russian  Drole are as different as the nim∣ble Pranks of a  Monkey  from the rude Gam∣bols of a  Bear  Even the same Country hath numerous Subdivisions and  under  Species  of Ridicule What is high Hu∣mour at  Wapping  is rejected as nauseous in the  City  What is delicate Raillery in  the City  grows  coarse  and  intolerable  as you approach  St James's  And many a well meant Joke that passes unheeded in all these various Districts would set an innocent Country Village in an Uproar of Laugh∣ter  THIS Subject might be much enlarged on For the Modes and Objects of Ridi∣cule are as indefinite as the imagined Com∣binations of Things But from these Ex∣amples drawn from the Conduct of parti∣culars it appears no less than from the ge∣neral Nature and Faculties of Man that Ridicule hath no other Source than Imagi∣nation Passion Prejudice and preconceived Opinion And therefore can never be  the Detecter of Falsehood  or  Test of Truth  SECTION VI  THE Cause might be safely rested here Yet to throw a still clearer Light on the Subject of our Enquiry let us now examine what his Lordship hath advanced in Sup∣port of his new Method of Investigation  And as the noble Writer hath not thought it expedient to descend often to the argu∣mentative Way we must make the most of what we find in him that looks like a Reason  HE tells his Friend that  "nothing is ri∣diculous except what is deformed nor is any thing Proof against Raillery except what is handsome and justone may defy the World to turn real Bravery and Generosity into Ridicule A Man must be soundly ridiculous who with all the Wit imaginable would go about to ridi∣cule Wisdom or laugh at Honesty or good Manners  Vol i p  "  HERE we have a Mixture of equivocal Language and pompous Declamation If he means to assert that  "nothing is ridicu∣lous except what is  apparently  deform∣ed"  the Proposition is true but foreign to the Purpose Because through the Er∣ror of Imagination Things  apparently de∣formed  may be  really beautiful  If he means to assert that  "nothing can be made to ap∣pear ridiculous but what is  really  de∣formed"  I should be glad to know where the noble Author had conversed In the  Platonic Republic  it may be so But in our  Gothic  Systems Matters go quite otherwise So far as common Observation reaches it is easiest of all Things to make that  appear  ri∣diculous which is not  really  deformed And how should it be otherwise while the human Imagination is liable to be imposed on and capable of receiving  fictitious  for  real  Representations  THE noble Author tells us next that  "nothing is Proof against Raillery except what is handsome and just"  Perhaps nor  that  neither Though it be true that nothing of the opposite Kind is proof against Raillery yet sure it is a strange Mistake to imagine that what is really handsome and just is always Proof against it For by sictitious Images impressed on the Fancy what is  really  handsome and just is often rendered  apparently  false and deformed and thus becomes  actually  contemptible and ridiculous  BUT  "one may defy the World to turn real Bravery and Generosity into Ridi∣cule"  Safely my Lord while they retain their  native Appearance  and Beauty of Proportion But alas how easy is it to  disguise  them It is but concealing varying  or adding a Circumstance that may strike the Fancy and they at once assume new Shapes new Names and Natures Thus the  Virtues  which seen in a direct Light attract our Admiration by their  Beauty  when beheld through the oblique Mediums of Ridicule start up in the Forms of  Ideots Hags  and  Monsters  BUT the noble Writer enforces these ge∣neral Appeals to Fact by one extraordinary Instance He tells us  "The divinest Man who had ever appeared in the Hea∣then World was in the Height of witty Times and by the wittiest of all Poets most abominably ridiculed in a whole Comedy writ and acted on Purpose But so far was this from sinking his Repu∣tation or suppressing his Philosophy that they each increased the more for it  Vol i p  "  It must be owned this is an extraordinary As∣sertion unless he means to affirm that the Reputation and Philosophy of SOCRATES arose from his Blood as  "the  Christian  Sects sprung from the Blood of Martyrs  Vol i  "  For it appears from all the Records of Antiquity that the Wit of ARISTOPHANES was the most formidable Enemy that ever attacked  the divine Philosopher This whetted the Rage of a  misled  Multitude and dragged to Death that Virtue which hath ever since been the Admiration of Mankind In this Opinion we have the Concurrence of the first Writer of the present Age  Ded to the  Div Leg of Moses  p  And the Confession of another who although of a Turn conceited and fantastical enough is yet of unquestioned Credit for his Inge∣nuity and Learning This Writer speak∣ing of the wild Wit of an ARISTOPHANES tells us that  "the Comedy inscribed  The Clouds  is an execrable Attempt to ex∣pose one of the wisest and best of Men to the Fury and Contempt of a  lewd Multitude  in which it had but  too much Success  Letters on Mythology  p  "  'TIS true PALMERIUS a learned  French  Critic of the last Age had from the Num∣ber of Years between the acting  The Clouds  of ARISTOPHANES and the Death of SO∣CRATES pretended that AELIAN was mis∣taken in assigning this Play as one of the principal Causes of his Destruction P BRUMOY who has wrote so excellently of the  Greek Theatre  after having examined  the Affair with the utmost Candour con∣cludes thus  "His Account AELIAN's seems only defective in that he hath not remarked the long interval that passed be∣tween the Representation of  The Clouds  and the Condemnation of SOCRATES But although the Comedy did not give the finishing Stroke to SOCRATES yet it might have indisposed the Minds of the People since these  comic Accusations  be∣came  very serious ones  which at length destroyed the wisest of the  Greeks  Son recit ne semble defectueux que pour n'avoir pas marqué le long intervalle qui se passa entre la represen∣tation des Nuees et la condemnation de Socrate Con∣cluons que bien que sa comedie n'ait pas porté le der∣nier coup à Socrate elle a pu indisposer les esprits puis∣que les accusations comiques devinrent des accusations tres serieuses qui perdirent ensin le plus sage des Grees  Tom v p  "  But since the noble Author seems to have adopted the other Opinion and as I am told some shallow Mimics of modern Platonism have lately stollen PALMERIUS's Criticism and revived this stale Pretence of the Num∣ber of Years between the Representation of  The Clouds  and the Death of SOCRATES it may be necessary to transcribe the follow∣ing Passage from PLATO's  Apology  which puts the Matter beyond all Doubt  "But it  is just O  Athenians  that I should first reply to the false Charge of my FIRST ACCUSERS Because several laid their groundless Accusations against me MANY YEARS AGO  whom  I DREAD MORE  than the Adherents of  ANYTUS though these too be very powerful in Persuasion But those are still  more powerful  who have pos∣sessed and sway'd you FROM YOUR VERY IN∣FANCY in laying false Accusations against me Many indeed have been these my Accusers and LONG HAVE THEY CON∣TINUED thus to accuse me and  persuaded  and  misled  you at that EARLY AGE when you were MOST EASY OF BELIEF While I in the mean Time was without one Defender And what is worst of all I know not so much as their very Names  except only that of  THE COMEDIANWhat then do my Accusers saySO∣CRATES is criminal in that he enquires too curiously concerning what is under the Earth and in the Heavens and in that he can make the worse appear the better Reason and that he teaches these Things to others Such then is the Ac∣cusation  For such Things you saw in  ARISTOPHANES's COMEDY where a fictitious SOCRATES  is carried about  af∣firming that he takes Journeys through the Air and talking much more idle Stuff of the same Nature  Plat  Apel Sec  "  HERE we see the Philosopher refers their Accusation to its  original Cause  And this he positively affirms was no other than the  old Impressions  made against him on the  Minds of the  Athenians by the Comedy of  THE CLOUDS  As so much stir hath been made about the Case of  Socrates  with regard to Ridicule it may not be amiss to shew what  his  Opinion of it was in general when con∣sidered as a  Test of Truth  In the fifth Book of  Plato's  Republic  Socrates  proposes that Women should engage in all the public Affairs of Life along with Men This to  Glauco  appears  ridiculous  in some of its Circum∣stances  Socrates  replies  "That may be But let us go to  the Merits  of the Question  setting aside all Raillery  advising the Railleurs  to be serious  and put∣ting them in Mind that the very Practice now ap∣proved in  Greece  of Men appearing naked was not long ago treated there with the highest Ridicule as it is to this Day among many Barbarians"  The following Part of this Passage I would recommend to the modern Patronizers of the  Way of Ridicule    SO much for the Silencing which is the only Conviction of Obstinacy and Igno∣rance But in Reality it is a Matter of small Consequence in the present Question Whether the Ridicule of the comic Poet was in Fact destructive to the divine Philo∣sopher or not But as it demonstrably was it is therefore a Case in Point However suppose it was not what is the Conse∣quence Why only this That dishonest  Ridicule failed of its desired Success  in one Instance  And how does this affect the Question so long as Ten thousand other Instances may be alledged to the contrary which no Man that is not void of common Sense or common Honesty can possibly deny  FROM the Appeals to Fact already made  See above §  may be drawn innumerable Instances of this Nature There we see Truth Wis∣dom Virtue Liberty successfully disguised and derided by this very means the Cause of Falsehood Folly Vice Tyranny main∣tained If to these it were necessary to add more we cannot perhaps in History find a more flagrant Proof of the Power of Ridi∣cule against  Virtue herself  than in that Heap of  execrable Comedies  which have been the Bane and Reproach of this Kingdom thro' a Series of ninety Years During this Pe∣riod the Generality of our comic Poets have been the unwearied  Ministers of Vice  And have done her Work with so thorough an Industry that it would be hard to find one Virtue which they have not  sacrificed  at her Shrine As Effects once established are not easily removed so not only this but the  succeeding Generation will probably retain the Impressions made in the two preceding ones when Innocence was the Sport of abandoned Villany and the  successful Adul∣terer decked out  with all the  Poet's Art  at the Expence of the  ridiculed  and  injured Husband  When moral Virtue and Religion were made the Jest of the  licentious  and female  Modesty  was banished to make Way for shameless  Effrontery  The Fair sat panting at a  Courtier's  Play  And not a Mask went unimprov'd away  The  modest  Fan was lifted up no more  And Virgins  smil'd  at what they  blush'd  before  Essay on Criticism    SECTION VII  HERE then we have accumulated Proofs of the fatal Influences of Ridicule when let loose from the Restraints of Rea∣son  YET still his Lordship insists that  "Truth 'tis supposed may bear all Lights  Vol i p  "  To which it is replied that  "Truth will indeed bear every Light  but a false one  "  He adds that  "one of those principal Lights or natural Mediums by which  Things are to be viewed in order to a thorow Recognition is Ridicule itself  Vol i p  "  This is full as wise a Method to manifest the Rectitude of Truth as it would be to shew the Rectitude of a ruling Staff to emerge one part of it in clear Water The Staff indeed would still continue strait but the two  Mediums  in which it lies though both  natural  ones would concur to make it appear crooked Just so it is with Truth when half shewn by the  Medium of Reason  and the other half by the  Medium of Ridi∣cule  BUT the noble Writer asks us  "How can any one of the least Justness of Thought endure a Ridicule wrong placed  Ibid p  "  I answer by being  misled  or  mistaken  and then Men are ready to  bear  any thing Shew me him whose Imagi∣nation never received or retained a false Im∣pression and I shall readily allow he can never  endure a Ridicule wrong placed  But of this  infallible  Race I know none except the Inhabitants of  Utopia  'Tis true he candidly acknowledges that  "the  Vulgar  may swallow any  sordid Jest  any  mere Drollery  and  Bussoonry  Ibid  "  Indeed How  then can he  desy the World to turn real Bra∣very or Generosity into Ridicule or laugh suc∣cessfully at Honesty or Goodmanners  And where was the Wonder or Improbability that the Wit of ARISTOPHANES should in∣cite a  lewd Multitude  to destroy the  divine Philosopher  L'Impudence qu'il avoit de tourner en ridicule la re∣ligion devoit être reprimée car une refutation serieuse ne fait pas à beaucoup près tant de mal que les raille∣ries d'un homme d'esprit Les  jeunes gens  se laissent gater par ces sortes de moqueurs plus que l'on ne scau∣roit dire  Bayle art BION    BUT then he tells us  "It must be a siner and truer Wit that takes with the men of  Sense  and  Breeding  Vol i p  "  This Sentence it must be owned is artful enough Because it obliges one to make a Separation that may look like  illnatured  before one can expose its Weakness A truer Wit in∣deed may be necessary to take with the  Men of Sense  but these I apprehend may sometimes be distinguished from the  Men of Breeding  For it is certain that in most Countries the Vulgar are a much more  con∣siderable  Body than is generally imagined Yet although neither  Reason  nor the  Pas∣sions  gain any Advantages from  high Life  it must be owned the Imagination acquires a certain  Delicacy  which the  low Vulgar  are generally Strangers to The coarse Pranks of a  merry Andrew  that engage the At∣tention of a  Country Fair  would make but a poor Figure at  St James's  But still it is only in the  Modes  not the Objects of Ridi∣cule with regard to which the  Courtier  dif∣fers from the  Clown  The  Peasant  and his  Lord  are equally susceptible of false Im∣pressions equally liable to have Falsehood obtruded on them for Truth Folly for Wis∣dom Vice for Virtue The Methods only of Ridicule the Engines of Deceit must vary must be accommodated to the dif∣ferent Views of Things and Circumstances of Life among which they have respectively been conversant Thus it must indeed be a  finer  but by no means a  truer  Kind of Wit that takes with the  Men of Breed∣ing  THE noble Writer proceeds to ask  "What Rule or Measure is there in the World except in the considering the real Temper of Things to find which are truly serious and which ridiculous And how can this be done unless by applying  the Ridicule to see whether it will bear  Vol i p  "  Yes sure there is another Rule The Rule of Reason Which alone can distinguish Appearances from Realities and fix the true Nature of Things From whose Determinations alone we ever can distin∣guish true from pretended Gravity just from groundless Raillery But the Way of Investigation here proposed by his Lordship inverts the very Order and Constitution of Things By this means Appearances take the Place of Realities Imagination usurps the Sovereignty which belongs to Reason and RIDICULE IS MADE THE TEST OF WHAT IS RATIONAL INSTEAD OF REA∣SON BEING MADE THE TEST OF WHAT IS RIDICULOUS  YET still the noble Author suspects ill Consequences That Subjects  "may be very grave and weighty  in our Imagination  but very ridiculous and impertinent in their own Nature  Ibid p  "  True and on the other hand Things may appear ridiculous and impertinent  in our Imagination  which are very grave and weighty in their own Na∣ture What then is the Consequence in either Case Why only this That  Ima∣gination  and therefore  Ridicule  which de∣pends upon it can never be a  Test  of Truth  BUT his Lordship insists that  "Gravity is of the very Essence of Imposture  Vol i p  "  Yet this will do little for his Purpose un∣less he can prove too that  "Imposture is of the Essence of Gravity"  And if so what will become of the  Enquiry concerning Virtue  Gravity it is true is commonly an Attendant of Imposture And so is Laugh∣ter generally speaking of Folly With as much Reason therefore as the noble Writer infers from hence that Gravity is Imposture we may infer that Laughter is Folly in Dis∣guise In Truth the Inference is ground∣less in both Cases Though every Knave should affect Gravity yet every grave Man is not a Knave Though every Fool will be Laughing yet every Man that laughs is not a Fool We may be serious and honest as well as merry and wise Mirth and Gra∣vity are both harmless Things provided they be properly applied And we have seen that it is the Province of Reason alone to determine when they are so  BUT after all the Proposition that  Gra∣vity is of the Essence of Imposture  is false  It is only an occasional though indeed a pretty close attendant since this other Maxim was taken for granted that  Reason was the Test of Truth  Let once his Lord∣ship's be generally embraced that  Ridicule  is so and we should soon see  Buffoonry  as close an Attendant on Imposture as now  Gravity  The Tryal has been made and successfully enough too by him who has kept the Multitude in Opinion for twenty Years together and by this Time perhaps himself that Learning and Religion are bet∣ter taught in his Conventicle than in all the Universities and Churches of  Christendom  put together And sure if any thing be the  Essence  of his  Imposture  it is  Buffoonry  AND here let us not forget to observe that the noble Writer often as in the Pas∣sage last cited confounds  Mirth Urbanity  or  Goodhumour  with  Raillery  or  Ridicule  Than which no two Things in Nature are more diametrically opposite The first as it ariseth solely from  sudden  and  pleasing Re∣semblances  impressed on the Imagination is justly regarded by all as the best  Mediator  in every Debate The last as it ariseth solely from  Contempt  is therefore no less justly regarded by most as an  Embroiler  and  Incendiary  He sets out with a formal Pro∣fession of proving the Efficacy of Humour and Ridicule in the Investigation of Truth Yet by shifting and mixing his Terms he generally slides insensibly into mere Enco∣miums on  Goodbreeding Chearfulness Ur∣banity  and  free Enquiry  and then from these Premises often draws Consequences in Favour of  Ridicule  as if it were an  equi∣valent Term  This indeed keeps some∣thing like an Argument on Foot and mis∣leads the superficial Reader  BUT the noble Author triumphs in an∣other Observation When speaking of  mo∣dern Zealots  he tells us that  "whatever they think grave and solemn they sup∣pose must never be treated out of a grave and solemn Way Though what another thinks so they can be contented to treat otherwise And are forward to try the Edge of Ridicule against any Opinions be∣sides their own  Vol i p  "  Now if this be so how is  Gravity of the Essence of Imposture  as he had before affirmed But whatever becomes of that Proposition the Remark is just And whomsoever he means to Com∣pliment with the Name of  Zealots  whe∣ther  in Religion or Freethinking I shall not compliment as Exceptions to the Truth of it There is scarce a Topic of Religion either for its Dishonour or Support that hath not been exposed to the illiberal Jokes of some Bungler in Controversy And a much coarser Advocate in the Cause of Ri∣dicule  Supposed to be Mr Collins  hath wrote an elaborate and most te∣dious Dissertation to prove that the Way of Raillery hath been successfully applied by every Sect of Religionists and Infidels to the Destruction of each other's Tenets and the Establishment of their own How he gains his Conclusion that an Engine which tends to fix Mankind in their preconceived Opinions and establish so many Species of Error is of Importance and Efficacy in the Search of Truth may not be so easy to de∣termine In the mean time in Reply to his whole Treatise as well as to the last mentioned Remark of our noble Author it may be sufficient to observe that Mankind often retain their own and oppose others' Opinions from an imperfect View of the Nature of Things Their peculiar Tenets in Religion as in other Subjects are often founded in Imagination only Their Ob∣jections  to those of others are often as groundless and fanciful How natural then is it for them to communicate their Opi∣nions on that Foundation on which they re∣ceived them How natural that they should throw the Colours of Imagination on the Tenets they oppose That they should ob∣trude the like fictitious Images on others which themselves have embraced as Truth That they should hold forth Appearances for Realities employ Eloquence instead of Logick and endeavour to  persuade  whom they should but cannot  convince  IT seems therefore that his Lordship's Observation which contains the Quintes∣sence of his Associate's Work and which probably was the  Leaven  that  leavened  the whole  Lump  of Malice and Dulness instead of being favourable to Ridicule as a Test of Truth can only tend to disgrace it For since every religious and unbelieving Sect hath  alike successfully  employed it in support∣ing their respective Tenets and in render∣ing those of their Adversaries contemptible it follows inasmuch as Doctrines which are essentially repugnant cannot all be true that RIDICULE IS ONE OF THE MOST POWER∣FUL  ENGINES BY WHICH ERROR CAN BE MAINTAINED AND ESTABLISHED  SECTION VIII  WE shall only mention one more of the noble Writer's Arguments in Favour of his new  Test  But it is indeed the very  KeyStone  of this visionary Arch which he hath with such fantastic Labour thrown over the Depths of Error in order to invite Mankind over it as a short and secure Passage to the Abode of Truth and Wisdom  HE tells us that a new Species of En∣thusiasts  French Prophets  having lately risen up among us  "We have delivered them over to the cruellest Contempt in the World I am told for certain that they are at this very Time the Subject of a choice Droll or Puppetshow at Bart'lmyFairAnd while Bart'lmyFair is in Possession of this Privilege I I dare stand Security to our national Church that no Sect of Enthusiasts no new Venders of Prophecy or Mira∣cles shall ever get the Start or put her to the Trouble of trying her Strength with them in any Case  Vol i p  "  SO far for Peace sake we venture to agree with the noble Writer But now comes a finishing Stroke indeed  FOR he proceeds to congratulate the pre∣sent Age that in the Beginnings of the Re∣formation when Popery had got Possession  Smithfield  was used in a more  tragical Way  And that  "had not the Priests as is usual preferred the Love of Blood to all other Passions they might in a  merrier Way  perhaps have  evaded the greatest Force of our reforming Spirit  Vol i p  "  AND now for Form's sake let us suppose the noble Author to be what he assumes a Friend to Religion and Reformation Un∣der this Character he recommends  Ridicule  to us as of sovereign Use to investigate Truth try Honesty and unmask formal Hypocrisy and Error To prove this Use he tells us what we should least have ex∣pected that if instead of the tragical Way of  Smithfield  the  Romish  Priests had pre∣ferred the comic Drollery of Bart'lmyFair they had perhaps gained their Point and  evaded the greatest Force of our reforming Spirit  Here the noble Writer forgets his Part which is that of a  Believer  and a  Pro∣testant  But in his Scarcity of Proofs for the  Use  of Ridicule he has put the Change upon us and perhaps upon himself and offered at one to shew its  Force  Which without doubt must wonderfully recom∣mend it to the Favour of all sober Men Here then lies the Dilemma Let his Fol∣lowers then get him off as they can If their Master be a Believer he has reasoned ill if a Freethinker he has managed worse Had he been a little more knowing in the Times he speaks of he might have found an Instance more pertinent to his Argu∣ment and more conformable to his Cha∣racter an Instance which shews not what  Ridicule  might be supposed capable of do∣ing but what it actually effected And this not to stop  Reformation  but to discre∣dit  Popery  Bishop BURNET tells us that in the Year  "Plays and Interludes were a great Abuse In them MockRepresentations were made both of the Clergy and of the Pageantry of their Worship The Clergy complained much of these as an Introduction to Atheism when Things sacred were thus laughed at And said they that begun to laugh at Abuses would not cease till they had  re∣presented  all the Mysteries of Religion as  ridiculous  The graver Sort of Re∣formers did not approve of it But poli∣tical Men encouraged it and thought nothing could more  effectually pull down  the Abuses that yet remained than the exposing them to the  Scorn  of the Na∣tion  History of the Reformation  A D  "  THIS curious Piece of History is re∣markable and tends no less to support our general Argument than to recommend what the noble Writer is pleased to snear at the Sobriety  of our reforming Spirit Political  men says the Historian whose Business and therefore whose aim was to  persuade  encouraged the Way of Ridicule But the  graver Sort of Reformers  whose nobler Ministry and consequently whose purpose was to  convince  did not  approve  of it  BUT his Lordship is so fond of his Re∣flection that he pushes it still further  "I never heard says he that the ancient Heathens were so well advised in their  ill Purpose  of suppressing the  Christian  Re∣ligion in its first Rise as to make use at any Time of this Bart'lmyFair Method  But this I am persuaded of that had  the Truth of the Gospel  been any way  sur∣mountable  they would have bid much fairer for the silencing it if they had chosen to bring our primitive Founders upon the Stage in a pleasanter Way than that of BearSkins and PitchBarrels  Vol i p  "  And as to the  Jews  he says that  "with all their Malice and Inveteracy to our Savi∣our and his Apostles after him had they but taken the Fancy to act such PuppetShows in his  Contempt  as at this Hour the Papists are acting in his Honour I am apt to think they might possibly have done our Religion more harm than by all their other Ways of Severity  Ibid  "  WHAT a Favourite is that  facetious Droll of Wood and Wire the Bart'lmy Fair Hero  with these modern Advocates for Mirth and Raillery And indeed not without cause for of him they seem to have learnt their very wittiest Practices Who taught them to turn their Backs upon their Betters to disturb the most serious Scenes with an un∣savoury Joke and make a Jest of the De∣vil Indeed they have so well taken off his Manners that one Description will serve  them both And whether you suppose the fine one which follows to be meant of the  original  or one of the  Copies  you are equally sure you have a good Likeness  Sed praeter reliquos incedit  Homuncio rauca  Voce strepensPygmaeum  territat agmen  Major et immanem  miratur turba gigantem  Hic magna fretus mole imparibusque lacertis

in the Way of  Scenery  and  dramatic  Representation are no more than so many Kinds of  silent Eloquence  and  Persuasion  That Facts which ought to be proved are always  taken for granted  and Things and Persons often rendered  apparently  absurd which  really  are not so That  the Vulgar  both  high  and  low    are apt to swallow any sordid Jest or Buffoonry  so it be but accom∣modated to their  preconceived Opinions  That this Way of Ridicule like every other  as it is fairly or dishonestly applied will sweep away Truth or Falsehood without Distinction That it will confound  French Prophets  with  English Reformers  and on the same false Foundation establish the Truths of Protestantism or the Absurdities of Popery That as  Virtue  herself cannot bear up against a Torrent of Ridicule so neither can  Religion  That therefore  Christi∣anity  had indeed more to fear from the  contemptuous Misrepresentations  than the  bitterest Rage  of its Enemies That  Christi∣anity  did in Fact endure this more than firey Trial That its divine Founder was  de∣rided  Prophesy unto us who it was that smote thee  as well as  crucified  That they who in succeeding Times suffered for the Faith endured  cruel Mockings  no less than  Scourg∣ings Bonds  and  Imprisonment  That many a brave Martyr offered up his Prayers to Heaven that he might be released by Death from the  Contempt  of his Enemies And af∣ter being  baited  in the  BearSkin  found a  Refuge  in the  Faggot  or the  PitchBarrel  SECTION IX  HOWEVER the noble Writer's Mo∣desty must not be forgotten For while he  might have arrogated to himself the Glory of this wondrous Discovery he hath in∣formed us of an  ancient Sage  whose Idea of Ridicule coincided with his own  "'Twas the Saying of an ancient Sage that Humour was the only Test of Gra∣vity  Vol i p  "  THE Reader will probably be surprized to find that the Passage here referred to by the noble Writer is no other than what hath been already quoted from ARISTO∣TLE  See above p  as a Direction to the Conduct of an Orator 'Tis likewise remarkable that his Lordship in quoting the original Passage in his  Margin  has by the  prudent  Omission of an emphatical Expression converted it from a particular Rule of Rhetoric into a general Maxim of Philosophy  The Words    Adversariorum  are omitted  But 'tis of all most remarkable that in his pretended Translation he hath entirely perverted the Sense of the Author whose Authority he attempts to build upon  "As Ridicule says the great Philoso∣pher seems to be of some Use in Plead∣ing it was the Opinion of GORGIAS  that you ought to confound your Adver∣sary's serious Argument by Raillery and his Raillery by serious Argument"  This is almost a literal Translation of the Pas∣sage But how the noble Author could so far impose upon himself or others as to strip it of its native Dress and disguise it under the fantastical Appearance of a Maxim  "that Humour is the only Test of Gravity and Gravity of Humour"  this is not so easy to account for  HOWEVER this came to pass 'tis cer∣tain that the Observation as it lies in ARI∣STOTLE is a just and a fine one as it lies in the noble Writer's maimed Translation it is  false  if not  unmeaning  THAT an Orator should  confound his Ad∣versary's Raillery by serious Argument  is ra∣tional and just By this means he tears off the false Disguises of Eloquence and dis∣tinguisheth real from apparent Truth That he should  confound his Adversary's serious Argument by Raillery  is if not a just yet a legal Practice The Aim and End of the Advocate or Orator is Persuasion only to Truth or Falsehood as it happens If he hath Truth on his Side it is likely what he will have then to do will be  to confound his  Adversary's Raillery by serious Argument  If Truth be against him he will be forced to change Weapons with his Adversary  whose serious Argument he must try to con∣found by Raillery  This is all the Mystery there is in the Matter By which we see that whenever in this case Ridicule is op∣posed to Reasoning it is so far from being the  Test  or Support that it is the  Destruction  of  Truth  And the judicious QUINTILIAN fairly confesses it where he assigns the Cause why Ridicule is of such mighty Force in Oratory  "Quia animum ab in∣tentione rerum frequenter avertit"    Be∣cause it draws off the Mind from attending to the real Nature of Things  Thus you see the Propriety and Beauty of the  Saying of our ancient Sage  when fairly represented  BUT as the noble Writer hath translated the Passage it is a Curiosity indeed  "Hu∣mour is the only Test of Gravity and Gravity of Humour"  He applies it not to Eloquence but Philosophy not to Per∣suasion but Conviction And so by the strangest Conversion in Nature makes the Trier and the Thing tried each in their turns become Agent and Patient to one an∣other But what Artist ever attempted to  try  the Justness of his  Square  or  Level  by the Work which he has formed by the As∣sistance of those Instruments Or was ever the Gold which hath been put to the Test reciprocally applied to  try  the TouchStone If therefore  Gravity  or Reasoning be the Test of  Humour  Humour never can be the Test of Gravity As on the other hand if Humour be the Test of Gravity then Gra∣vity can never be the Test of Humour  SINCE therefore this  seesaw  Kind of Proof returns into itself and consequently ends in an Absurdity 'tis plain that one half of the noble Writer's Proposition must effectually destroy the other Let us see then which Moiety deserves to be sup∣ported His own Comment on the Pas∣sage will help us to determine Which however he seems desirous his Reader should receive as a Part of the  Saying of his ancient Sage  But whoever will turn to the Passage as it lies in ARISTOTLE will find that GORGIAS is entirely innocent of the whole Affair  "GRAVITY says his Lordship is the Test of  Humour  Because a Jest that will not bear a serious Examination is cer∣tainly false Wit"  True here we have a  rational Test established Next he inverts the Proposition sets it with its Head down∣wards like a Traytor's Scutcheon and now says he behold  "Humour is the Test of Gravity"  To prove this Reason re∣quires he should have added  "Because an Argument which can be successfully ri∣diculed is certainly false Logic"  But this was too hardy a Proposition to be di∣rectly advanced He therefore contents himself with hinting that  "a Subject which will not bear Raillery  is suspicious  "  Now we know that  Suspicion  is often ground∣less That what is suspected to be false may yet be true So that the noble Writer again suffers this new Test to slip through his Fingers even while he is holding it up to your Admiration But if any thing fur∣ther be necessary to clear up this Point it may be observed in short that Gravity or Argument is the Test of Humour because Reason marks the real Differences of Things That Humour can never be the Test of Gravity because Imagination can only suggest their apparent Analogies  THUS the Sentiment of GORGIAS is grosly mistaken or designedly misrepre∣sented by the noble Writer as it lies in  ARISTOTLE it is rational and consistent as it is taken up by his Lordship it is chi∣merical and groundless  IT might have been difficult to assign a Reason why the noble Writer should have attempted to establish this  twofold  Method of Proof had not he explained his Intention in another Place He there  Vol iii Misc v c § c  wisely re∣commends the old  scholastic Manner  to the  Clergy  as being most suitable to their Abi∣lities and Character The  Way of Ridicule  he appropriates to the Men of Taste and Breeding declaring it ought to be kept sacred from the impure Touch of an Eccle∣siastic For as Clubs and  Cudgels  have long been appropriated to Porters and Footmen while every Gentleman is ambitious to un∣derstand a  Sword  so the clumsy Way of  Argumentation  is only fit for Priests and Pedants but  pointed  Wit is the Weapon for the Man of Fashion This decides a Quarrel  handsomely  The  pretty Fellow  is at your Vitals in a Moment while the Pedant keeps labouring at it for an Hour together and neither gets nor gives so much as a broken Bone  BUT still higher is the noble Writer's Idea of Wit and Ridicule While he ap∣plies it not only to  Conquest  but  Investiga∣tion  And we must own it was an At∣tempt worthy of his Genius to establish this new and  expeditious  Method of Search and Conviction In which by the sole Ap∣plication of so cheap and  portable an In∣strument  as that of  Raillery  a Gentleman might obtain the certain Knowledge of the  true Proportion  of Things without the te∣dious and vulgar Methods of  Mensuration  In the mean Time we whom the noble Author hath so often condescended to dis∣tinguish by the honourable Title of For∣malists and Pedants finding ourselves inca∣pable of this  sublime  Way of Proof must be content to drudge on in the old and beaten Track of  Reasoning  And after all 'tis probable this new Attempt will succeed no better than the curious Conceit of the  learned Taylor  in  Laputa  Who being employed in making a  Suit  for the facetious GULLIVER disdained the  vulgar Measures  of his Pro∣fession and took that Gentleman's  Altitude  by the Help of a  Quadrant  This it must be acknowledged was a Theory no less sublime than our noble Author's Yet it  failed miserably when applied to Practice For the sagacious Traveller informs us that notwithstanding the Acuteness and Pene∣tration of the Artist his cloaths were  wretchedly ill made  SECTION X  WE have now obviated every thing ma∣terial that the noble Writer hath advanced in Support of his new System But as one of his most zealous Followers hath under∣taken  in Form  to explain and defend his Notions on this Subject  See a Note on the  Pleasures of Imagination  a Poem Book iii  it may be proper to examine how far this Gentleman's Ar∣gument is consistent with Truth  HE tells us that  "to ask whether Ridi∣cule be a Test of Truth is in other Words to ask whether that which is ri∣diculous can be morally true can be just and becoming or whether that which is just and becoming can be ridiculous"  HERE as the Foundation of all we see the same Kind of Ambiguity lurking as was observed in the noble Writer in the Pas∣sage already remarked on  See above p  For if by  "that  which is ridiculous"  he means that which is  really  ridiculous it is allowed this can ne∣ver be morally true But this is so far from proving Ridicule to be a Test of Truth that it implies the contrary It implies some further Power which may be able to dis∣tinguish what is  really  ridiculous from what is only  apparently  so On the contrary if by  "that which is ridiculous"  he means that which is  apparently  ridiculous it may be affirmed this may be morally true Be∣cause Imagination and Passion often take up with Fictions instead of Realities and can never of themselves distinguish them from each other He tells us his Question  "does not deserve a serious Answer"  At least it wanted an Explanation  THE Gentleman proceeds  "For it is most evident that as in a metaphysical Proposition offered to the Understanding for its Assent  the Faculty of Reason  exa∣mines the Terms of the Proposition and finding one Idea which was supposed equal to another to be in Fact unequal of Consequence rejects the Proposition as a Falsehood So in Objects offered to the Mind for its Esteem or Applause the  Faculty of Ridicule  feeling an Incongruity in  the Claim urges the Mind to reject it with Laughter and Contempt"  HERE the  Faculty of Reason  is excluded from the Examination of moral Truths and a  new  Faculty never before heard of  the Faculty of Ridicule  is substituted in its Place Now when a  Stranger  is introduced into good Company and sure these can be no better than the  Public  it is usual not only to tell his Name but  what he is  and what his  Character  This the Gentleman hath not condescended to do 'Tis true in a preceding Page he tells us that  "the Sensa∣tion of Ridicule is not a bare Perception of the Agreement or Disagreement of Ideas but a  Passion or Emotion of the Mind consequential to that Perception  "  In another Place he expresly calls it  "a gay Contempt"  Now if the  Faculty of Ri∣dicule  be the same as the  Sensation of Ridi∣cule  or  a gay Contempt  then by substituting the plain old Term of  Contempt  instead of the  Faculty of Ridicule  we shall clearly see what the above cited Passage contains  "As in a metaphysical Proposition the  Fa∣culty of Reason  examines the Terms and rejects the Falsehood so in Objects of∣fered to the Mind for its Esteem and Ap∣plause  the Passion of Contempt  feeling an Incongruity in the Claim urges the Mind to reject it  with Laughter and  CON∣TEMPT"  Why was not honest  Reason  admitted of the Council and set on the  Seat of Judgment  which of right belongs to her The Affair would then have stood thus  "As in a metaphysical Proposition the Faculty of Reason examines the Terms and rejects the Falsehood so in Objects offered to the Mind for its Esteem or Applause  the same Faculty of Reason  finding an Incongruity in the Claim urges the Mind to reject it with  Contempt  and  Laughter  "  This would have been Sense and Argument but then it had not been  Characteristical  WE shall now clearly discover the Dis∣tinction that is to be made on the following Passage  "And thus a double Advantage is gained For we both  detect  the moral Falsehood  sooner  than in the Way of spe∣culative Enquiry and impress the Minds of Men with a stronger Sense of the Va∣nity and Error of its Authors  Ibid p  "  Here 'tis evident that the Design  "of  detecting  the moral Falsehood  sooner  than in the  Way of speculative Enquiry"  is an ab∣surd Attempt But that  "to impress the Minds of Men with a stronger Sense of the Vanity and Error of its Authors"  when Reason hath made the proper Search is both a practicable and a rational Inten∣tion  "BUT it is said continues he that the Practice is dangerous and may be incon∣sistent with the Regard we owe to Ob∣jects of real Dignity and Excellence  Ibid p  "  Yet this is but a secondary Objection The principal one is  that the Attempt is absurd  However the Circumstance of Danger is not without its Weight Nor is the Gen∣tleman's reply at all sufficient  "that the Practice fairly managed can never be dan∣gerous"  For though Men are not dis∣honest in obtruding false Circumstances upon us we may be so  weak  as to  obtrude  them upon ourselves Nay it can hardly be otherwise if instead of exerting our Rea∣son to correct the Suggestions of Fancy and Passion we give them an unlimited Range and acquiesce in their partial or groundless Representations without calling in Reason to decide upon their Truth or Falsehood  By this means we shall often  "view Ob∣jects of real Dignity and Excellence"  in such Shapes and Colours as are foreign to their Nature and then sit down and laugh most profoundly at the Phantoms of our own creating  BUT still he insists that though false Cir∣cumstances be imposed upon us yet  "the Sense of Ridicule always  judges right  "  or in more vulgar Terms  "The Passion of Contempt always judges right"  Whereas in Truth it never  judges  at all being equal∣ly excited by Objects real or imaginary that present themselves  OBSERVE therefore what a Number of  new  Phrases and  blind  Guides this of Ridi∣cule if once admitted would bring in upon us and all on equal Authority For with the same Reason as the Passion of Contempt is styled the  Sense of Ridicule  the Passion of  Fear  may be called the  Sense of Danger  and  Anger  the  Sense of Injury  But who hath ever dreamt of exalting these Passions into so many Tests of the Reality of their respective Objects The Design must have been re∣jected as absurd because it is the Province of Reason alone to correct the blind Sal∣lies of every Passion and fix it on its proper  Object Now the Scheme of Ridicule is of the same Nature It proposes the Pas∣sion of Contempt as the Test of moral Falsehood which from the very Terms appears to be a Project full as wise as to make Fear the Test of Danger or Anger the Test of Injury  THE Gentleman proceeds next to the Case of SOCRATES He owns  "the SO∣CRATES of ARISTOPHANES is as truly ri∣diculous a Character as ever was drawn But it is not the Character of SOCRATES the divine Moralist and Father of ancient Wisdom"  No indeed and here lay the Wickedness of the Poet's Intention and the Danger of his Art in imposing Fictions for Realities on the misled Multitude and put∣ting a Fool's Coat on the Father of ancient Wisdom 'Tis true the People laughed at the  ridiculous Sophist  but when the ridicu∣lous Sophist came to drink the Poison what think you became of the Father of ancient Wisdom  BUT then he tells us that as the comic Poet introduced foreign Circumstances into the Character of SOCRATES and built his Ridicule upon these  "So has the Reason∣ing of SPINOZA made many Atheists  he has founded it indeed on Suppositions utterly false but allow him these and his Conclusions are unavoidably true And if we must reject the Use of Ridicule because by the Imposition of false Cir∣cumstances things may be made to seem ridiculous which are not so in them∣selves why we ought not to reject the Use of Reason because by proceeding on false Principles Conclusions will appear true which are impossible in Nature let the vehement and obstinate Declaimers against Ridicule determine  Page  "  BUT why so much Indignation against  Declaimers  in one who writes in Defence of  Ridicule  a Species of  Declamation  Then as to  rejecting  the Use of Ridicule a very material Distinction is to be made As a  Mode of Eloquence  nobody attempts totally to reject it while it remains under the Do∣minion of Reason But as a  Test of Truth  I hope the Reader hath seen sufficient Rea∣son totally to reject it  NEITHER will the Parallel by any means hold good which the Gentleman hath at∣tempted to draw between the Abuse of  Ri∣dicule  and  Reason  Because the Imagina∣tion  to which the Way of Ridicule applies is apt to form to itself innumerable fictitious Resemblances of Things which tend to con∣found Truth with Falsehood Whereas the natural Tendency of Reason is to separate these apparent Resemblances and determine which are the  real  and which the  fictitious  Although therefore SPINOZA hath advanced many Falsehoods in the Way of speculative Affirmation and founded his Reasonings on these yet still Reason will be her own Cor∣rectress and easily discover the Cheat But if the Imagination be impressed with false Appearances and the Passion of Contempt strongly excited neither the  Imagination  nor the  Passion can ever correct themselves  but must inevitably be misled unless  Reason  be called in to rectify the Mistake and bring back the Passion to its proper Channel  NAY so far is the Use of Ridicule when prior to rational Conviction from being par∣allel to Reason or cooperative with it that on the contrary it hath a strong Ten∣dency to prevent the Efforts of Reason and to confound its Operations It is not pre∣tended that human Reason though the  ul∣timate  is yet in all Cases an  adequate  Test of Truth It is always fallible often errone∣ous  But it would be much less erroneous were every Mode of Eloquence and Ridi∣cule above all others kept remote from its Operations were no Passion suffered to blend itself with the Researches of the Mind For Ridicule working on the Ima∣gination and Passions disposes the Mind to receive and acquiesce in any Opinion with∣out its proper Evidence Hence Preju∣dice arises and the Mind which should be  free  to examine and weigh those  real  Cir∣cumstances which PROVE SOCRATES to be indeed a divine Philosopher is drawn by the  prior  Suggestions of  Ridicule  to receive and acquiesce in those false Circumstances which PAINT him as a  contemptible Sophist  TO conclude 'Tis no difficult Matter to point out the Foundation of this Gentle∣man's Errors concerning Ridicule They have arisen solely from his mistaking  the Passion of Contempt  for a  judicial Faculty  Hence all those newfangled Expressions of  "the Faculty of Ridicule""the Sense of Ridicule"and "the feeling of the Ridiculous"  In the Use of which he seems to have imposed upon himself new Phrases for Realities and Words for Things I cannot better illustrate this Remark than  by transcribing a Passage from the incom∣parable LOCKE  "Another great Abuse of Words is the taking them for Things To this Abuse Men are most subject who confine their Thoughts to any one System and give themselves up to the firm Belief of the Perfection of any re∣ceived Hypothesis whereby they come to be persuaded that the Terms of that Sect are so suited to the Nature of Things that they perfectly correspond with their real Existence Who is there that has been bred up in the Peripatetic Philoso∣phy who does not think the ten Names under which are ranked the ten Predica∣ments to be exactly conformable to the Nature of Things Who is there of that School that is not persuaded that  sub∣stantial Forms vegetative Souls Abhorrence of a Vacuum intentional Species etc  are something real""There is scarce any Sect in Philosophy has not a distinct Set of Terms that others understand not But yet this  Gibberish  which in the Weakness of human Understanding serves so well to palliate Men's Ignorance and cover their Errors comes by familiar Use amongst those of the same Tribe to seem  the most important Part of Language and of all other the Terms the most signifi∣cant  Locke  on Hum Understanding  B iii c §  "  And now to save the Trouble of Repetition the Reader is left to deter∣mine how far  "the  Faculty of Ridicule  feeling the Incongruity"  and  "the  Sense of Ridicule  always judging right"  may with Propriety be placed among the learned  Gibberish  abovementioned  'TIS strange this Gentleman should have erred so widely in so plain a Subject when we consider that he hath accidentally thrown out a Thought which if pursued would have led him to a full View of the Point debated  "The Sensation of Ridi∣cule is not a bare  Perception  of the Agree∣ment or Disagreement of Ideas but  a Passion  or  Emotion  of the Mind  conse∣quential to that Perception  P  "  SECTION XI  TO return therefore to the noble Wri∣ter As it is evident that  Ridicule  cannot in general without Absurdity be applied as a Test of Truth so can it least of all be  admitted in  examining Religious Opinions  in the Discussion of which his Lordship seems principally to recommend it Because by inspiring the contending Parties with  mutual Contempt  it hath a violent Tendency to de∣stroy  mutual Charity  and therefore to pre∣vent  mutual Conviction  TO illustrate this Truth let us consider the following Instance which seems clear and full to the Point  THERE is not perhaps in any Language a bolder or stronger Ridicule than the well∣known Apologue of  The Tale of a Tub  Its manifest Design is to recommend the  Eng∣lish Church  and to disgrace the two Extremes of  Popery  and  Puritanism  Some indeed have pretended otherwise Thus Mr  Wotton  in his  Reflections on Learning  says  "It is a de∣signed Banter upon all that is esteemed sacred among Men"  And the pious Author of the  Independent Whig  affirms it was  "the sole  open  Attack that had been made upon  Christianity  since the Revolution except the  Oracles of Reason  and was not inferior in Ban∣ter and Malice to the Attacks of  Celsus  or  Julian  or  Porphyry  or  Lucian  " p  Where by the Way the Oddity of the  Contrast  is remarkable enough that he should pronounce the  Tale of a Tub  to be a  Libel on Christianity  while it is in Fact  a Vindication of our Ecclesiastical Establishment  and at the same Time entitle his own Book  a Vindication of our Ecclesiastical Establish∣ment  while in Fact it is  a Libel on Christianity  Now if we  consider this exquisite Piece of Raillery as a Test of Truth we shall find it impotent and vain For the Question still recurs whether MARTIN be a just Emblem of the  English Jack  of the  Scotch  or  Peter  of the  Roman Church  All the Points in Debate between the several Parties are taken for granted in the Representation And we must have Re∣course to  Argument  and to that alone ere we can determine the Merits of the Que∣stion  IF we next consider this Masterpiece of Wit as a Mode of  Eloquence  we shall find it indeed of great  Efficacy  in confirm∣ing every Member of the  Church of England  in his own Communion and in giving him a thorough Distaste of those of  Scotland  and  Rome  And so far as this may be regarded as a Matter of  public Utility  so far the Ri∣dicule may be laudable  BUT if we extend our Views so as to comprehend a larger Plan of  moral Use  we shall find this Method of Persuasion is such as Charity can hardly approve of For by representing the one of these Churches un∣der the Character of  Craft and Knavery  the other under that of  incurable Madness  it must needs tend to inspire every Member  of the  English  Church who believes the Re∣presentation with such  Hatred  of the one and  Contempt  of the other as to prevent all  friendly Debate  and  rational Remonstrance  ITS effect on those who hold the Do∣ctrines of CALVIN or of  Rome  must be yet worse Unless it can be proved that the Way to attract the Love and convince the Reason of Mankind is to shew that we hate or despise them While they revere what we deride 'tis plain we cannot  both  view the Subject in the same Light And though we deride what appears to us  con∣temptible  we deride what to them appears  sacred  They will therefore accuse us of misrepresenting their Opinions and abhor us as  unjust  and  impious  THUS although this noted Apologue be indeed a Vindication of our  English  Church yet it is such as had been better spared Be∣cause its natural Effect is to create Preju∣dice and inspire the contending Parties with mutual Distaste Contempt and Hatred  BUT if the Way of Ridicule is thus wholly to be rejected in treating every  con∣troverted  Subject it will probably be asked  "Where then is it to be applied Whether it is reasonable  to calumniate and blacken  it without Distinction  And whether it is not Impiety thus  to vilify the Gifts of our Maker  "  AND 'tis certain that to do this were ab∣surd and impious As on the other hand there is an equal Absurdity and Impiety in confounding that Order of Things which the Creator hath established and endeavour∣ing to raise  a blind Passion  into the  Throne of Reason  One Party or other in this Debate hath certainly incurred the Censure The Censure is severe and let it fall where it is deserved I know none that endeavour to vilify and blacken Ridicule without Dis∣tinction unless when it presumes to elevate itself into a  Test of Truth  And then as a Rebel to the Order and Constitution of Na∣ture it ought to be resolutely encountered and repelled till it take Refuge in its own inferior Station  THE proper Use of Ridicule therefore is  "to disgrace  known  Falsehood"  And thus negatively at least  "to enforce  known  Truth"  Yet this can only be affirmed of certain Kinds of Falsehood or Incon∣gruity to which we seem to have appro∣priated the general Name of  Folly  And among the several Branches of this chiefly  I think to AFFECTATION For as every  Affectation  arises from a false Pretence to  Praise  so a  Contempt incurred  tends to  con∣vince  the Claimant of his  Error  and thus becomes the natural Remedy to the Evil  MUCH more might be said on this Head We might run through numerous Divisions and Subdivisions of  Folly  But as the Task would be both insignificant and endless I am unwilling to trouble the Reader with such elaborate Trifles  IT seems an Observation more worthy of our Attention and Regard that  Contempt  whence Ridicule arises being a  selfish Passion  and nearly allied to  Pride  if not absolutely founded on it we ought ever to keep a strict Rein and in general rather curb than forward its Emotions Is there a more im∣portant Maxim in Philosophy than this that we should gain a Habit of controuling our Imaginations and Passions by the Use of Reason Especially those that are rather of the selfish than the benevolent Kind That we should not suffer our Fears to sink us in Cowardice our Joys in Weakness our An∣ger in Revenge And sure there is not a Passion that infests human Life whose Con∣sequences are so generally pernicious as those  of  indulged Contempt  As the common Occurrences of Life are the Objects which afford it Nourishment so by this means it is kept more constantly in Play than any other Affection of the Mind And is indeed the general Instrument by which Individuals Families Sects Provinces and Nations are driven from a State of mutual Charity into that of Bitterness and Dissention We pro∣ceed from Raillery to Railing from Con∣tempt to Hatred Thus if the Love of Ri∣dicule be not in itself a Passion of the male∣volent Species it leads at least to those which are so Add to this that the most ignorant are generally the most contemptu∣ous and they the most forward to  deride  who are most incapable or most unwilling to  understand  Narrow Conceptions of Things lead to groundless Derision And this Spirit of Scorn in its Turn as it cuts us off from all Information confirms us in our preconceived and groundless Opinions  THIS being the real Nature and Ten∣dency of Ridicule it cannot be worth while to descant much on its Application or ex∣plore its Subserviency to the Uses of Lise For though under the severe Restrictions of Reason it may be made a proper Instru∣ment  on many Occasions for disgracing  known Folly  yet the Turn of Levity it gives the Mind the Distaste it raises to all candid and rational Information the Spirit of Ani∣mosity it is apt to excite the Errors in which it confirms us when its Suggestions are false the Extremes to which it is apt to drive us even when its Suggestions are true all these conspire to tell us it is rather to be wished than hoped that its Influence upon the whole can be considerable in the Service of  Wisdom  and  Virtue  LORD SHAFTESBURY himself in many other Parts of his Book strongly insists on the Necessity of bringing the Imagination and Passions under the Dominion of Rea∣son  "The only Poison to  Reason  says he is  Passion  For  false Reasoning  is soon redressed where Passion is removed  Wit and Humour  Part ii §  "  And it is difficult to assign any Cause that will not reflect some Dishonour on the no∣ble Writer why he should thus strangely have attempted to privilege this Passion of  Contempt  from so necessary a Subjection Let it suffice in Conclusion to observe that Inconsistencies must ever arise and be persisted in when a roving Fancy con∣ducted  by  Spleen  and  Affectation  goes in Quest of idle Novelties without subjecting itself to the just Restraints of  Reason  UPON the whole This new Design of  discovering  Truth by the  vague  and  un∣steady Light  of Ridicule puts one in Mind of the honest  Irishman  who applied his  Candle  to the  SunDial  in order  to see how the Night went  ESSAYS ON THE Characteristics etc  ESSAY II On the Obligations of Man to Vir∣tue and the Necessity of religious Principle  HAVING considered the noble Wri∣ter's two first Treatises so far as they regard the  Use of Ridicule  we now come to his  Soliloquy  or  Advice to an Author  And here bating only a few accidental Passages which will be occasionally pointed out here∣after we shall have little more to do than to approve and admire The whole Disser∣tation being in its general Turn one con∣tinued  Instance of its Author's Knowledge and refined Taste in Books Life and Man∣ners I could dwell with Pleasure on the Beauties of this Work if indeed they needed an Explanation But that noble Union of Truth and Eloquence which shines through the whole as it supersedes so it would dis∣grace any Attempt of this Kind To the Work itself therefore I recommend the Reader  THE noble Writer having thus prepared us for the Depths of Philosophy by enjoin∣ing an unfeigned and rigorous  SelfExami∣nation  proceeds to that highest and most interesting of all Subjects  The Obligations of Man to the Practice of Virtue  And here it will probably appear that with a Variety of useful Truths he hath blended several plausible Mistakes which when more near∣ly viewed seem to be attended with a Train of very extraordinary Consequences What he hath given us on this Subject lies chiefly in the two Treatises which compose his se∣cond Volume But as he frequently refers us to the other Parts of his Writings where he hath accidentally treated the same Points in a more explicit Manner so the same Liberty of comparing one Passage with an∣ther  will I apprehend be judged reasona∣ble by the candid Reader Thus we shall more effectually penetrate into his true Scope and Intention and draw off as far as may be that Veil of  Mystery  in which for Reasons best known to himself he hath so often wrapped his Opinions  SECTION II  'TIS no uncommon Circumstance in Controversy for the Parties to engage in all the Fury of Disputation without precisely instructing their Readers or truly knowing themselves the Particulars about which they differ Hence that fruitless Parade of Ar∣gument and those opposite Pretences to Demonstration with which most Debates on every Subject have been infested Would the contending Parties first be sure of their own Meaning a Species of SelfExamination which I think the noble Writer hath not condescended to mention and then communicate their Sense to others in plain Terms and Simplicity of Heart the Face of Controversy would soon be changed And real Knowledge instead of imaginary Conquest would be the noble Reward of literary Toil  IN the mean Time a History of  Logo∣machies  A Strife about Words  well executed would be no unedi∣fying Work And in order to open a Path to so useful an Undertaking I will venture to give the present Section as an Introduction to it For sure among all the Questions which have exercised the Learned this con∣cerning  the Obligations of Man to Virtue  hath given Rise to the greatest Profusion of loose Talk and ambiguous Expression The Ar∣gument hath been handled by several of great Name And it might possibly be deemed Presumption to differ from any of them had they not so widely differed among themselves Much hath been said and various have been their Opinions con∣cerning our  Obligations  to  Virtue  but lit∣tle hath been said in any definitive Man∣ner on the previous and fundamental Question  What Virtue is  By which I do not mean what Actions are called Virtuous for about that Mankind are pretty well agreed but  what makes Virtue to be what it is  And till we have determined this with all possible Precision we cannot de∣termine  "upon what Foundation Man∣kind  are obliged to the Practice of it"  Our first Enquiry therefore must be con∣cerning the  Nature  of  Virtue  In the In∣vestigation of which the Moralists of most Ages seem to have been remarkably de∣fective  LET us first consider what our noble Au∣thor hath said on this Subject He tells us  "The Mind cannot be without its Eye and Ear so as to discern Proportion dis∣tinguish Sound and scan each Sentiment and Thought which comes before it It can let nothing escape its Censure It feels the soft and harsh the agreeable and disagreeable in the Affections and finds a  foul  and  fair  an  harmonious  and a  dissonant  as really and truly here as in any musical Numbers or in the outward Forms and Representations of sensible Things Nor can it withold its Admi∣ration and Extasy its Aversion and Scorn any more in what relates to one than to the other of these Subjects So that to deny the common natural Sense of a  sublime  and  beautiful  in Things will ap∣pear an  Affectation  merely to any one who considers duly of this Affair  Inquiry concerning Virtue  Part iii §  "  The  Perception of this Beauty he calls the  moral Sense  or  Taste  and affirms that Virtue con∣sists in  "a perfect Conformity of our Af∣fections and Actions with this supreme Sense and Symmetry of Things"  Or to use his own Words  "The Nature of Virtue consists in a certain just Disposition or proportionable Affection of a rational Creature towards the  moral Objects of Right and Wrong  Inquiry concerning Virtue  Part iii §  "  THE next Writer I shall mention is the learned and amiable Dr CLARKE He thinks it necessary to reject this Idea of Vir∣tue which the noble Writer had establish∣ed and as a surer Foundation than what mere  Affection Sense  or  Taste  could pro∣duce lays the Basis of Virtue in  Reason  And insists that its true Nature lies in  "a Conformity of our Actions with certain eternal and immutable Relations and Dif∣ferences of Things That from these which are necessarily perceived by every rational Agent there naturally arise cer∣tain  moral Obligations  which are of them∣selves incumbent on all antecedent to all positive Institution and to all Expectation of Reward or Punishment  Clarke's  Demonst  passim  "  AFTER these comes an ingenious and candid Writer and in Opposition to both these Schemes of Moral fixes the Nature of Virtue in  "a Conformity of our Actions with  Truth  "  He affirms that  "no Act whether Word or Deed of any Being to whom moral Good and Evil are im∣putable that interferes with any  true  Pro∣position or  denies  any thing to be as it is can be  right  That on the contrary every Act is right which does not contra∣dict Truth but treats every thing as being what it is  Wollaston's  Rel of Nat  § passim  "  There are besides these several other philosophical Opinions concerning the Na∣ture of Virtue as that it consists in fol∣lowing  Nature  in avoiding all  Extremes  in the Imitation of the  Deity  But these are still more loose and indeterminate Ex∣pressions if possible than the former If therefore the first should appear vague and ineffectual the latter must of Course sall under an equal Censure  NOW it will appear that all the three Definitions of Virtue which Lord SHAFTES∣BURY Dr CLARKE and Mr WOLLASTON have given us in designed Opposition to  each other are equally defective  "Be∣cause they do not give us any more parti∣cular or determinate Ideas than what we have from that  single Word  which with so much fruitless Labour they attempt to define"  LET us first examine the noble Writer's Definition in this View He says that  "Virtue consists in a Conformity of our Af∣fections with our natural Sense of the Sublime and Beautiful in Things or with the moral Objects of Right and Wrong"  Now what new Idea do we gain from this pompous Definition Have we not the same general Idea from the Word  Virtue  as from the more diffused Expression of  the Sublime and Beautiful of Things  And can∣not we gather as much from either of these as from the subsequent Phrase the  moral Objects of Right and Wrong  "They are all general Names relative to something which is yet unknown and which is no more explained by the pretended Definition than by the Word which is attempted to be defined Indeed when his Lordship further affirms that to relieve the Needy or help the Friendless is an Instance of this Sublime and Beautiful of Things we then  obtain a more determinate Idea with Re∣gard to that particular Case But still we are as much as ever at a Loss for a general  Criterion  or  Test  by which the Virtue of our other Actions is to be determined To say therefore that Virtue consists in acting ac∣cording to the  fair  the  handsome  the  sub∣lime  the  beautiful  the  decent  the  moral Ob∣jects  of  Right  and  Wrong  is really no more than ringing Changes upon Words We might with equal Propriety affirm  "that  Virtue  consists in  acting virtuously  "  This Deficiency Mr WOLLASTON clearly saw  "They says he who reckon nothing to be  morally  good but what they call  ho∣nestum  may denominate Actions accord∣ing as that is or is not the Cause or End of them But then what is  honestum  Something is still wanting to measure Things by and to separate the  honesta  from the  inhonesta  Rel of Nat  p  "  DR CLARKE's Definition seems not to include any thing more precise or determi∣nate than the noble Writer's He affirms that  "Virtue consists in a Conformity of our Actions with right Reason or the eter∣nal and immutable Relations and Dif∣ferences  of Things"  Here then a paral∣lel Question ariseth  "What is  right Rea∣son  and what these  eternal Relations  which are affirmed by the learned Writer to be the Test or Criterion of Virtue"  And 'tis observable that when he comes to prove the Truth and Reality of these  Relations  he is forced to resolve it into a  selfevident  Pro∣position  "These Things saith he are so notoriously plain and  selfevident  that no∣thing but the extremest Stupidity of Mind Corruption of Manners or Per∣verseness of Spirit can possibly make any Man entertain the least Doubt concerning them  Demonst  p  "  Thus too his ingenious  Advo∣cate  when pushed by his Adversary to de∣clare whether he perceives the Truth of these Relations by  Proof  or  Intuition  con∣fesses  "they may be looked upon as  selfevident  Balguy's  Tracts    d  Part of  Mor Goodness  p  "  Here then we may observe a strong Coincidence between the noble Wri∣ter's System of Expression and this of Dr CLARKE For as the one affirms that the  Sublime  and  Beautiful  of Things is  selfevident  so the other affirms the same of the  Fit  and  Reasonable  And as the  Sublime  and  Beautiful  give us no more determinate Ideas than the  Virtuous  so neither can we obtain any additional Information from the  Fit  and  Reasonable  We are equally at a Loss to know what is  fit  and  reasonable  as to know what is  virtuous  Therefore the  one  can ne∣ver be an adequate Definition of the other Here too Mr WOLLASTON plainly saw the Want of Precision As to those he saith  "who make  right Reason  to be a Lawit is true that whatever will bear to be tried by right Reason is right and that which is condemned by it wrongBut the Manner in which they have delivered themselves  is not yet explicit enough  It leaves Room for so many Disputes and  opposite right Reasons  that nothing can be settled while every one pretends that  his  Reason is right  Rel of Nat  p  "  NOW it will doubtless appear a Circum∣stance of Singularity that Mr WOLLAS∣TON who saw the essential Defects of these two Definitions should himself offer a  third  which is precisely liable to the same Ob∣jection  "Virtue saith this learned Wri∣ter consists in a Conformity of our Actions with Truth in treating every  thing as being what it is"  Well be it so Yet the Question still recurs what is  moral Truth  And this demands a  Definition  no less than  Virtue  which was the Thing to be defined Had Lord SHAFTESBURY lived to see this new Theory proposed how naturally would he have retorted Mr WOL∣LASTON's Objection  "You Mr WOL∣LASTON reckon nothing to be  morally Good  but what you call  Truth  And you may indeed denominate Actions accord∣ing as that is or is not the Cause or End of them But then what is  Truth  Something further is still wanting to mea∣sure Things by and to separate  Truth  from  Falsehood  "  Thus too would Dr CLARKE have naturally replied  "'Tis true that whatever will bear to be tried by  Truth  is right and that which is con∣demned by it wrong But the Manner in which you have delivered yourself is not yet explicit enough You have ra∣ther confounded my Definition than gi∣ven a new one of your own All that you have added is an Impropriety of Speech I speak of the  Rectitude  of Actions you of the  Truth  of Actions which I call an Impropriety of Speech  because  Truth  relates to  Affirmations  not to  Actions  to what is  said  not to what is  done  But supposing the Propriety of your Expression what further Criterion have you gained You confess that  Truth  is discovered by  Reason  only for you say that  to deny Things to be as they are is the Transgression of the great Law of our Nature the Law of Reason  Rel of Nat  p  If so then Reason is as good a Guide as Truth We can as certainly know what is  right Reason  as what is  Truth  If therefore my Definition is defective yours must be so too If mine leaves Room for so many Disputes and  opposite right Reasons  that nothing can be settled while every one pretends that this Reason is  right  yours must of Necessity be liable to the same Objection must leave Room for so many Disputes and  opposite Truths  that nothing can be settled while every one pretends that his Idea of  Truth  is the  right  one Truth then can never be a better Cri∣terion than Reason because our Idea of  Truth  must always  depend  upon our  Reason  "  THUS it should seem that our three ce∣lebrated Writers have not given the Satif∣faction which might have been expected in an Affair of such philosophical Importance Their common Attempt is to define the Nature or fix the Criterion of Virtue To this End the first affirms it consists in a a Conformity of our Actions to the  Fair  and  Handsome  the  Sublime  and  Beautiful  of Things The Second the  Fitness Reasons  and  Relations  of Things The Third the  Truth  of Things But inasmuch as these general Terms of  Beauty Fitness Truth  convey not any more determinate Idea than that of  Virtue  which they are brought to define the several pretended Definitions are therefore  inadequate  and  defective  Let it be observed once for all that the Desinitions here censured as defective are little more than direct Transcripts of what the old  Greek  Philosophers and  Tully  after them have said on the same Subject To shew how generally this Kind of Language infects the Writers on Morality we need only transcribe the fol∣lowing Passage from a Follower of the noble Writer  "We need not therefore be at a Loss said he for a  Description  of the sovereign GoodWe may call it  Rectitude  of ConductIf that be too contracted we may enlarge and say 'tisto live perpetually select∣ing and rejecting according to  the Standard of our Be∣ing  If we are for still different Views we may say 'tisto live in the Discharge of  Moral Offices  to live  according to Nature  To live  according to Virtue  to live according to  just Experience  of those Things which happen around us"  Three Treatises by  J H  Treat  d  p    WHAT then is  Virtue  Let us consider its true Nature in the following Section  SECTION III  THERE are few among Mankind who have not been often struck with Admi∣ration at the Sight of that Variety of Co∣lours and Magnificence of Form which ap∣pear in an Evening  Rainbow  The  un∣instructed  in Philosophy consider that splen∣did Object not as dependent on any other but as being possessed of a  selfgiven  and  original Beauty  But he who is led to know that its Place and Appearance al∣ways varies with the Situation of the  Sun  that when the latter is in his Meridian the former becomes an inconsiderable Curve skirting the Horizon that as the Sun des∣cends the Rainbow rises till at the Time of his  Setting  it encompasses the Heavens with a glorious Circle yet  dies  away when he  disappears  the Enquirer is then con∣vinced that this gay Meteor did but shine  with a  borrowed  Splendor derived from the Influence of that mighty  Luminary  THUS in like Manner though the  Beau∣ty Fitness Truth  or VIRTUE of all those Actions which we term  morally Good  seem at first View to reside in the several Actions in an original and independent Manner yet on a nearer Scrutiny we shall find that properly speaking their Nature ariseth from their  Ends  and  Consequences  that as these  vary  the Nature of the several Actions  varies  with them that from these alone Actions gain their  Splendor  are denomi∣nated  morally Good  and give us the Ideas of  Beauty Fitness Truth  or  Virtue  THE first Proofs in Support of this Opinion shall be drawn from those very Writers who most zealously oppose it And here 'tis first remarkable that  "while they attempt to fix their several Criterions of absolute independent Beauty Fitness and Truth they are obliged to admit  Exceptions  which effectually destroy what they design to establish"  The follow∣ing Instance from one of these celebrated Writers is equally applicable to the other two  MR WOLLASTON speaks in the following Manner  "To talk to a Post or otherwise treat it as if it was a Man would surely be reckoned an  Absurdity  if not  Dis∣traction  Why Because this is to treat it as being what it is not And why should not the converse be reckoned as bad that is to treat a Man as a Post As if he had no Sense and felt not In∣juries which he doth feel as if to him Pain and Sorrow were not Pain Happi∣ness not Happiness  Rel of Nat  p  "  Now you see that on his Scheme of absolute irrelative Truth the Absurdity of  talking to a Post  is precisely of the same Nature with that of  injuring a Man  For in both Cases we treat the Post and the Man as being  what they are not  Consequently on this Philo∣phy if it be morally Evil to  injure a Man  'tis likewise morally Evil to  talk  to a  Post  Not that I suppose Mr WOLLASTON would have maintained this Consequence He knew that the First of these Absurdities would only deserve the Name of  Folly  that the latter of a  Crime  As therefore he allows that Truth is equally violated in either Case as there is something  highly  immoral  in the one and  nothing immoral  in the other here is an Exception which over∣turns his Principle which proves that the Morality or Immorality of Actions depends on something  distinct  from mere abstract irrelative  Truth  THE same Exception must be admitted on Dr CLARKE's System of Expression For sure 'tis neither  fit  nor  reasonable  nor agreeable to the Relations of Things that a Man should talk to a Post Yet although it be admitted as  irrational  and  absurd  I do not imagine any of Dr CLARKE's De∣fenders would say it was  immoral  So again with regard to Lord SHAFTESBURY 'tis clear there can be nothing of the  Sublime  or  Beautiful  in this Action of talking to a Post On the contrary there is to use his own Manner of Expression an apparent Indecency Impropriety and  Dissonance  in it Yet although his Admirers might justly denominate it  incongruous  they would surely be far from branding it as  vile  Here then the same Exception again takes place which demonstrates that  Virtue  can∣not consist either in  abstract Fitness  or  Beauty  but that something further is re∣quired in order to constitute its Nature  POSSIBLY therefore the Patrons of these several Theories may alledge that Actions which relate to  inanimate Beings  only can properly be called no more than  naturally  beautiful fit or true But that  moral  Fit∣ness Beauty or Truth can only arise from such Actions as relate to Beings that are  sensible  or  intelligent  Mr BALGUY ex∣presly makes this Exception He affirms that  "moral Actions are such as are know∣ingly directed towards some Object intel∣ligent or sensible  First Treat on Moral Goodness  p  "  AND so far indeed this Refinement ap∣proaches towards the Truth as it excludes all  inanimate  Things from being the Ob∣jects of moral Good and Evil Yet even this Idea of moral Beauty Fitness or Truth is highly indeterminate and defective Be∣cause innumerable Instances may be given of Actions directed towards Objects sensible and intelligent some of which Actions are manifestly  becoming fit  or  true  others as manifestly  incongruous irrational  and  false  yet none of them in any Degree  virtuous  or  vicious meritorious  or  immoral  Thus to speak to a Man in a Language he under∣stands is an Action  becoming fit  or  true  'tis treating him according to the Order Relations and Truth of Things 'tis treat∣ing him according to  what he is  On the contrary to speak to him in a Language he understands not is an Action neither  be∣coming fit  nor  true  'tis treating him ac∣cording to  what he is not  'tis treating him  as a Post  But although the first of these Actions be undeniably becoming fit or true who will call it  Virtue  And though the latter be undeniably incongruous irra∣tional and false who will call it  Vice  Yet both these Actions are directed towards a Being that is sensible and intelligent It follows therefore that an Action is not either morally Good or Evil merely because it is conformable to the Beauty Fitness or Truth of Things even though it be di∣rected towards an Object both  sensible  and  intelligent  but that something still further some more distinguishing and characteristic Circumstance is necessary in order to fix its real Essence  WHAT this peculiar Circumstance may be we come now to enquire And the first Lights in this Enquiry shall be bor∣rowed from these very celebrated Writers whom we have here ventured to oppose  For such is the Force and Energy of Truth that while they are attempting to involve her in a Cloud of Metaphysics she breaks through the mystic Veil they had prepared and woven for her with so much Art and diffuseth a Stream of genuine Lustre which the most obdurate Prejudice can only with∣stand by winking hard  AND first though the  noble  Writer every where attempts to fix an original indepen∣dent moral Beauty of Action to which every thing is to be referred and which it∣self is not to be referred to any thing fur∣ther  Essay on WitSoliloquyEnquiryMoralistsMiscellanies  passim  Yet when he comes to an Enume∣ration of those  particular  Actions which may be called morally Beautiful he always singles out such as have a direct and neces∣sary Tendency to  the Happiness of Mankind  Thus he talks of the Notion of  a public In∣terest  Enqu  B i p §  as necessary towards a proper Idea of Virtue He speaks of public Affection in the same Manner and reckons Generosity Kindness and Compassion as the Qualities which alone can render Mankind truly Vir∣tuous So again when he fixes the Bounds of the social Affections he evidently refers  us to the same End of human Happiness  "If Kindness or Love of the most natural Sort be immoderate it is undoubtedly vicious For thus overgreat Tenderness  destroys the Effect of Love  and excessive Pity renders us incapable of giving Suc∣cour  Enqu  B i p §  "  When he fixes the proper De∣grees of the  private Affections  he draws his Proof from this one Point  "that by having the SelfPassions too intense or strong a Creature becomes miserable  Ibid  "  Lastly when he draws a Catalogue of such Affections as are most opposite to Beauty and moral Good he selects  "  Malice Hatred  of  SocietyTyrannyAngerRevengeTreacheryIngratitude  Ibid  "  In all these Instances the Reference to human Happi∣ness is so particular and strong that from these alone an unprejudiced Mind may be convinced that the Production of  human Happiness  is the great universal Fountain whence our Actions derive their  moral Beauty  THUS again though the excellent Dr CLARKE attempts to six the Nature and Essence of Virtue in certain Differences Relations and Fitnesses of Things to which  our Actions ought ultimately to be referred yet in enumerating the several Actions which he denominates  morally Good  he mentions none but what evidently promote the same great End  "the Happiness of Man"  He justly speaks of the  Welfare  of the  Whole  as being the  necessary  and most  important  Con∣sequence of  virtuous  Action He tells us  "that it is  more fit  that GOD should regard the  Good  of the  whole  Creation than that he should make the Whole continually miserable That all Men should endea∣vour to promote the  universal Good  and  Welfare  of all than that all Men should be continually contriving the  Ruin  and  Destruction  of all  Demonst  p c  "  Here again the Reference is so direct and strong to  the Hap∣piness of Mankind  that even from the In∣stances alledged by the worthy Author it appears that a Conformity of our Actions to this great End is the very Essence of  moral Rectitude  MR WOLLASTON is no less explicit in this particular For in every Instance he brings  the Happiness  of Man is the single End to which his Rule of Truth verges in an unvaried Manner Thus in the Passage  already cited though he considers the  talk∣ing to a Post  as an  Absurdity  he is far from condemning it as an  immoral  Action But in the same Paragraph when he comes to give an Instance of the Violation of  moral  Truth he immediately has recourse to  Man  and not only so but to the  Happiness  of Man  "Why saith he should not the Converse be reckoned as bad that is to treat a  Man  as a Post as if he had no  Sense  and  felt  not  Injuries  which he doth  feel  as if to him  Pain  and  Sorrow  were not  Pain Happiness  not  Happiness  "  At other Times he affirms that  "the  Impor∣tance  of the Truths on the one and the other Side should be diligently  compared  Rel of Nat  p  "  And I would gladly know how one Truth can be more important than another un∣less upon this Principle and in Reference to  the Production of Happiness  Himself indeed confirms this Interpretation when he speaks as follows  "The Truth violated in the former Case was B had a Property in that which gave him such a Degree of  Happiness  That violated in the latter was B had a Property in that which gave him a  Happiness  vastly  superior  to the other  The Violation  therefore  in the latter Case was  upon this Account  a vastly  greater  Violation than in the former  Rel of Nat  p  "  THESE Evidences may seem sufficient But that all possible Satisfaction may be gi∣ven in a Circumstance which is of the greatest Weight in the present Question these further Observations may be added  AS therefore these celebrated Writers give no Instances of moral Beauty Fitness or Truth but what finally relate to the Happiness of Man so if we appeal to the common Sense of Mankind we shall see that the Idea of Virtue hath never been uni∣versally affixed to any Action or Affection of the Mind unless where this Tendency to produce Happiness was at least  apparent  What are all the Black Catalogues of Vice or moral Turpitude which we read in History or find in the Circle of our own Experience what are they but so many In∣stances of  Misery produced  And what are the fair and amiable Atchievements of  Le∣gislators Patriots  and  Sages  renowned in Story what but so many Efforts to raise Mankind from Misery and establish the public Happiness on a sure Foundation  The first are  vicious immoral deformed  be∣cause there we see Mankind  afflicted  or  de∣stroyed  The latter are  virtuous right beautiful  because here we see Mankind  pre∣served  and  assisted  BUT that  Happiness  is the last Criterion or Test to which the moral Beauty Truth or Rectitude of our Affections is to be re∣ferred the two following Circumstances  de∣monstrate  First  "those very Affections and Actions which in the ordinary Course of Things are approved as virtuous do change their Nature and become vicious in the strictest Sense when they contra∣dict this fundamental Law of the greatest public Happiness"  Thus although in ge∣neral it is a Parent's Duty to prefer a Child's Welfare to that of another Person yet if this natural and just Affection gain such Strength as to tempt the Parent to violate the  Public  for his Child's  particular  Wel∣fare what was before a  Duty  by this be∣comes immoderate and  criminal  This the noble Writer hath allowed  "If Kindness or Love of the most natural Sort be  im∣moderate  it is undoubtly  vicious  Enq on Virtue  "  And hence he says  "the Excess of motherly  Love is owned to be a vicious Fond∣ness  Enq on Virtue  "  The same  Variation  takes Place with regard to every other Relation between Man and Man Insomuch that the supe∣rior Regards which we owe to our Family Friends FellowCitizens and CountrymenRegards which in their proper Degree aspire to the amiable and high Names of  domestic  Love  Friendship Patriotism  when once they desert and violate the grand Principle of  universal Happiness  become a  vicious  Fondness a mean and odious  Parti∣ality  justly stigmatized by all as ignomini∣ous and  unworthy  SECONDLY with such uncontrouled Au∣thority does this great Principle command us that  "Actions which are in their own Nature most shocking to every  humane  Affection lose at once their moral Desor∣mity when they become subservient to the general Welfare and assume both the Name and the Nature of Virtue"  For what is more contrary to every gentle and kind Affection that dwells in the hu∣man Breast than to shed the Blood or de∣stroy the Life of Man Yet the ruling Prin∣ciple abovementioned can reconcile us  even to  this  And when the Necessity of public Example compels us to make a Sa∣crifice of this Kind though we may la∣ment the  Occasion  we cannot condemn the  Fact  So far are we from branding it as  Murder  that we approve it as  Justice  and always defend it on this great Principle alone  that it was necessary for the public Good  THUS it appears that those Actions which we denominate Virtuous Beautiful Fit or True have not any absolute and in∣dependent but a relative and reflected Beau∣ty And that their Tendency to produce Happiness is the only Source from whence they derive their Lustre Hence therefore we may obtain a just and adequate Defi∣nition of Virtue Which is no other than  "the  The Gentlemen above examined seem to have mis∣taken the  Attributes  of Virtue for its  Essence  Virtue is procuring Happiness To procure Happiness is  beauti∣ful reasonable true  these are the Qualities or Attri∣butes of the Action But the Action itself or its  Essence  is procuring Happiness  The Reader who is curious to examine further into this Subject may consult the  Prelim Dissert to Dr  LAW's  Translation of  KING's  Origin of Evil  Toge∣ther with several Passages in the Translator's  Notes  where he will find  Sense  and  Metaphysics  united in a very eminent and extraordinary Degree  Conformity of our Affections with the  public Good"  Or  "the voluntary Pro∣duction of the greatest Happiness"  SECTION IV  IT may possibly seem strange that so much has been thought necessary to be op∣posed to these metaphysical  Refinements  con∣cerning the Nature of Virtue But in Rea∣lity 'tis a Point of the utmost Consequence For these Refinements have given rise to a plausible Objection which hath been re∣tailed in a popular Manner by a late wordy Writer whose least merit it is to have sup∣plied our modish Coffeehouse Philosophers with such a Variety of fashionable Topics that they have never felt the least Want of that antiquated Assistance derived from Knowledge Parts and Learning  THIS Gentleman taking Advantage of these metaphysical Refinements and parti∣cularly of the noble Writer's imaginary Scheme of  absolute irrelative  Beauty  "the Hunting after which he elegantly af∣firms is not much better than a wild Goose Chase  Fable of the Bees  vol i p oct Ed  "  attempts from hence to demonstrate for the  Benefit  of his  Country  that we are utterly mistaken when we  "look upon Virtue and Vice as permanent Realities that must ever be the same in all Countries and all Ages  Fable of the Bees  p  "  And thus he prosecutes his Argument  THE Worth or Excellence of every thing he says varies according to Fancy or Opi∣nion  "Even in human Creatures what is beautiful in one Country is not so in anotherThree hundred Years ago Men were shaved as closely as they are now since that they have wore BeardsHow mean and comical a Man looks that is otherwise welldressed in a narrowbrimed Hat when every Body wears broad ones And again how monstrous is a very great Hat when the other Ex∣treme has been in Fashion for a consideraTimeThe many Ways of laying out a Garden judiciously are almost innumera∣ble and what is called Beautiful in them varies according to the different  Taste  of Nations and Ages  P  "  Thus capricious and uncertain he tells us are our Ideas of natural Beauty and these he brings home to the Point of Morals  "In Morals there is no greater Certainty Plurality of  Wives is odious among  Christians  and all the Wit and Learning of a great Genius in Defence of it has been rejected with Contempt But Polygamy is not shock∣ing to a  Mahometan  What Men have learnt from their Infancy enslaves them and the Force of Custom warps Nature and at the same Time imitates her in such a Manner that it is often difficult to know which of them we are influenced by In the East formerly Sisters mar∣ried Brothers and it was meritorious for a Man to marry his Mother Such Al∣liances are abominable But it is certain that whatever Horror we conceive at the Thoughts of them there is nothing in Nature repugnant against them but what is built upon Mode and Custom A re∣ligious  Mahometan  may receive as great an Aversion against Wine  Fable of the Bees  p  "  Hence with great Stretch of Reasoning he concludes  "that Virtue and Vice are not permanent Realities"  but vary as other Fashions and are subject to no other Law than that of  Fancy  and  Opinion  AND so far indeed this Gentleman seems to have argued justly while he contends  that mere  Approbation  and  Dislike  the mere Idea of  Beauty  and  Deformity Truth  or  Rectitude  without Reference to some fur∣ther  End  can never constitute a real or per∣manent Foundation of  Vice  or  Virtue  For as he hath observed there  have  indeed been considerable Differences of Opinion upon  some Kinds  of moral Beauty and Deformity in the different Nations and Ages of the World And each Age and Nation hath ever been alike positive in asserting the Pro∣priety of its own Therefore unless we have some further Test some other distin∣guishing and characteristic Circumstance to refer to besides that of mere  Approbation  and  Dislike  how shall we ever know which of these  anomalous  Opinions are  right  or  wrong  If we have nothing further to appeal to than the mere Propriety of  Taste  though each may be thoroughly satisfied of the Justness of his own yet he ought in Reason to allow the same Right of Choice to the rest of Mankind in every Age and Nation And thus indeed  moral  Beauty and Deformity  Virtue  and  Vice  could have no other Law than that of  Fancy  and  Opinion  BUT when the great End of public Hap∣piness is ultimately referred to as the  one  uniform  Circumstance that constitutes the  Rectitude  of human Actions then indeed  Virtue  and  Vice  assume a more  real  and  per∣manent  Nature The common  Sense  nay the very  Necessities  of Mankind will urge them to make an unvaried and just  Dis∣tinction  For  Happiness  and  Misery  make too strong an Appeal to all the Faculties of Man to be borne down by the  Caprice  of Fancy and Opinion That it was either an accidental or a designed Inattention to this great Principle of  Happiness  that gave this coarse Writer an Occasion to call in Question the permanent  Reality  of Vice and Virtue the following Considerations may sufficiently convince us  SHOULD any one ask whether  Health  and  Sickness  are two different Things no Doubt we should answer in the Affirmative And would surely suspect any Man's Sincerity who should tell us that what was accounted Health in one Age or Nation was ac∣counted Sickness in another There are likewise such Things as wholesome Food and Poisons Nor would we entertain a much better Opinion of him who should affirm that  all  depends upon  Fancy  that  Bread  or  Milk  are nourishing or destructive  that  Arsenic  and  Sublimate  are wholesome or poisonous as  Imagination  and  Opinion  dictate On the contrary we know their Nature with Respect to Man is  invariable  The one universally wholesome the other poisonous Further we know there have been Debates among Physicians about  Re∣gimen  and  Diet  That some have main∣tained the Wholesomeness of  Animal  others of  vegetable  Food Some recommended the Drinking of  Water  others of  Wine  Yet none was ever so weak as to conclude from these different Opinions about wholesome  Diet  that the nourishing Qualities of  Bread  or the noxious ones of  Arsenic  were not  permanent  Realities with regard to Man or that the first could be made  poisonous  the latter  wholesome  by Dint of  Fancy  and  Opinion  NOW the Case we are debating is exact∣ly parallel For sure the  Happiness  and  Misery  of Mankind are Things as distinct as  Health  and  Sickness  Whence it follows that certain Actions under the same Cir∣cumstances must universally produce Hap∣piness or Misery as naturally as Food pro∣duceth Health or Poison Sickness and Death We have already seen that what∣ever  tends to the Good of all is by the con∣sent of all denominated  Virtue  that what∣ever is contrary to this great End is univer∣sally branded as  Vice  in the same Manner as whatever nourishes the Body is called  Food  whatever destroys it  Poison  Ac∣cordingly we find the Agreement among Mankind as uniform on the one Subject as on the other All Ages and Nations having without Exception or Variance maintained that Humanity Fidelity Truth Tem∣perance and mutual Benevolence do as na∣turally produce Happiness as Food gives Health to the Body That Cruelty Trea∣chery Lying Intemperance Inhumanity Adultery Murder do as naturally give Rise to Misery as Poison brings on Sickness and Death  BUT hath not this Author given such Instances as prove that what is detested as  Vice  in one Country is applauded as  Virtue  in another That  Polygamy  and  incestuous Marriages  have been in some Nations re∣puted  lawful  in others  meritorious  And if one Virtue or Vice be imaginary or  variable  doth it not clearly follow that  all  are so  NOW a Man of a common Turn of Thought would be apt to make a very dif∣ferent  Inference If from the  Variety  of Opinions among Mankind as to  some  Vir∣tues or Vices he concluded  these  were  va∣riable  then from the universal  Agreement  of Mankind with regard to  other  Virtues and Vices he would conclude  these  were  fixed  and  invariable  The  Consent  of Man∣kind in the  one  proves as much as their  Disagreement  in the  other  And 'tis evident that both their Consent and Disagreement arise from the same Principle A Principle which destroys the Tenets which this Au∣thor labours to establish For to resume our Illustration as the various Opinions concerning the superior Wholesomeness of this or that kind of  Diet  does not change the Nature of  Bread  or  Poison  so neither can the various Opinions concerning  Poly∣gamy  or  Incest  affect or change the Nature of  Benevolence  and  Generosity Adultery  and  Murder  'Tis plain these various Opinions have been formed  "upon such Actions only as are not universally and clearly con∣nected with the Happiness or Misery of Mankind"  As these Actions have been deemed productive of the  one  or the  other  they have been regarded as  Virtues  or  Vices  But this Variety of Opinions does no  more unsettle the Nature of those Actions whose  Tendency  is clear and  certain  than the Debates on the superior Wholesomeness of animal or vegetable  Diet  can change the Nature of  Bread  and  Poison  Hence it ap∣pears that Virtue and Vice are permanent Realities and that their Nature is fixed certain and  invariable  THUS one Extreme produceth another For the noble Writer and this Gentleman through a strong Dislike of each other's Systems have  both  endeavoured to prove  too much  and in Consequence have proved  nothing  The one contending for the per∣manent  Reality  of Virtue and not content to fix it on its proper Basis attempts to esta∣blish certain  absolute  and  immutable  Forms of Beauty without Regard to any  further End  and thus by laying a chimerical Foundation  betrays  the Cause which he so generously defends The other intent on destroying the permanent Reality of Virtue and Vice and perceiving how weak a Basis the noble Writer had laid for their Esta∣blishment after proving  this  to be imagi∣nary as wisely as honestly infers there is no real one in Nature We now see the Folly of these Extremes That as on the  one Part  Virtue  and  Vice  are Things merely  relative  to the  Happiness  of Man so on the other while Man continues what he is all those  Relations  which concern his  Happi∣ness  and arise from his present Manner of Existence are likewise  permanent  and  im∣mutable  SECTION V  BUT this idle Objection against the per∣manent  Reality  of Virtue and Vice is not the only one which the Writer last men∣tioned hath laboured for the Destruction of Religion and Virtue For the main Drift and Intention of his Book is to prove no less a Paradox than this that  "private Vices are public Benefits"  Now till this Ob∣jection be removed our Idea and Definition of Virtue can never be thoroughly esta∣blished For if  private Vices  be  public Be∣nefits  then private  Virtues  are public  Mis∣chiefs  And if so what becomes of our  Definition  NOW the first notable Circumstance in this formidable Assertion of Dr MANDE∣VILLE is its utter Inconsistency with all that he hath advanced in order to destroy the Reality of Vice and Virtue For if indeed  these be mere  Names  the Creatures of Fancy and Opinion how can they be at∣tended with any  uniform  Effects How can they be either public  Benefits  or public  Evils  If on the contrary they really produce certain uniform Effects as he hath attempted to prove how can they be mere  NonEntities  the Creatures of Fancy and Opinion Here lies a gross and palpable Incoherence Take which of his two Theories you please the other absolutely destroys it If Vice be a public  Benefit  it must be a permanent  Reality  If it is not a permanent  Reality  it cannot be a public  Benefit  LET us now examine the Foundations on which he hath built this strange Hypo∣thesis His Book may be analysed into four different Principles which he hath variously combined or rather jumbled together ac∣cording as each in their Turn would best serve his Purpose  THE first Principle he lays down or ra∣ther takes up  i e  for granted is  "that Man is a compound of evil Passions"  In other Words  "that the Gratisication of the natural Appetites is in itself a Vice"  There are in his Book at least a hundred  Pages of the lowest commonplace Decla∣mation all founded on this one Principle brought from the  solitary Caves  and  Visions  of the  Desart  Thus the Desire of being esteemed by others he stigmatizes with the Name of  Pride  The natural Desire of so∣cial Converse between the two Sexes he distinguisheth by a  grosser  Appellation In a word through the whole Course of his Argument he  supposes  that every  selfish  Ap∣petite that is every Appetite which hath regard to  ourself  is in its own Nature vile and abominable This the candid Reader will probably think a little hard upon hu∣man Nature That no Man can be  virtu∣ous  while he endeavours to be  esteemed  while he loves to quench his Thirst mi∣nister to Posterity or eat his Dinner On the Weight of these plain Instances the Value of this first Principle may be safely left to any Man's impartial Trial  HAVING thus branded every Gratifi∣cation of the natural Appetites he gains from hence a proper Foundation for the second  Pillar  of this  Temple  of Vice For he acquaints us with great Solemnity that of all other Vices that of  Luxury  is most beneficial to a State And that if this were  banished the Nation all Kinds of manual Occupations would immediately languish and decay  Fable of the Bees  passim  He says indeed that  Pedants  make Objections to this Vice of Luxury and tell you that it  enervates  a People But he adds that  "since he has seen the World the Consequences of Luxury to a Nation seem not so dreadful to him as they did  Ibid p  "  Had he left the Matter here we should have been at a Loss to know how he would have made out this strange Tale But the Riddle is cleared up at once when we hear him say that  "every thing is Luxury that is not immediately necessary to make Man subsist as he is a living Creature  Ibid p  "  WE should have been startled perhaps had he assured us that he had a  Windmill  which laid  Eggs  and bred  young  ones But how easily had he reconciled us to his Ve∣racity by only saying that by a  Windmill  he meant a  Goose  or a  Turkey  THUS when he affirms that Luxury pro∣duceth public Happiness we stand ready for some deep and subtile Speculation to support so wondrous a Paradox But when he poorly tells us  "that every thing is  Luxury that is not immediately necessary to make Man subsist as he is a living Creature"  we laugh not so much at his Impudence as at our own Folly in giving Ear to so idle a Prater whose widemouthed Paradoxes so soon dwindle into a little harmless Nonsense and when we thought we had him reforming States and newmodeling Philosophy he was all the while playing at  Crambo  LEST it should be suspected that the Features of this Man's Folly are here ag∣gravated take a Copy of his Countenance in one Instance out of many that might be given  "The Consequences saith he of this Vice of Luxury to a Nation seem not so dreadful to me as they did"  For  "clean Linen weakens a Man no more than Flannel  Fable of the Bees  p  "  Now from these Pas∣sages laid together it appears first that Luxury is a Vice secondly that to wear clean Linen is Luxury and therefore it comes out as clear as the Day  "that  to wear clean Linen  is a Vice"  SERIOUSLY the Sophistry here em∣ployed is one of those Insults that can be safely offered only to an  English  Under∣standing  which though none of the brightest is always ready to reflect the pre∣sent Object Did ever any Man beforeexcept only a Set of wrongheaded Enthu∣siasts whose Visions he is here obliged to adoptdid ever any Man maintain that to use the Bounties of Nature or enjoy the Conveniences of Life was a criminal Indul∣gence Did ever any Man maintain that  he  could be  viciously  luxurious who neither  hurt  his  Neighbour  nor  himself  At this Rate by an arbitrary Use of Words and putting one Expression for another we might boldly advance the most palpable Contradictions and maintain that Dr MDLE was a Man of Modesty and Virtue  THUS far we have seen this Writer en∣deavouring to throw the  false  Colours of  Vice  upon the  natural Passions  and such a  Use  of the Gifts of Nature as is really  In∣nocent  In examining his two remaining Principles we shall find him acting a Part the very  reverse  and with the same Ef∣frontery endeavouring to throw the  false  Colours of  public Utility  on such  Actions  and  Affections  as are really  criminal  and  de∣structive  TO this Purpose he boldly selects some of the most flagrant Crimes and assures us that without their happy Influence the Pub∣lic would suffer exceedingly Who had ever dreamt that Mankind receives Benefit from  Thieves  and  Housebreakers  Yet he tells us that  "if all People were strictly honest half the Smiths in the Nation would want Employment  Fable of the Bees  p  "  HIGHWAYMEN too and  Robbers  are use∣ful in their Generation For  "if a Miser should be robbed of Five hundred or a thousand Guineas  There is a common Error with regard to  Misers  on which this pretended Argument is built They are generally accounted the greatest Enemies of  Society  be∣cause they  hoard  the  Wealth  which ought to  circulate  Now to give even a  Miser  his due this is really a groundless Charge For they seldom  hoard  more than certain useless Papers or Parchments in the Shape of  Notes Bonds  and  Mortgages  While the Wealth which they thus  hoard  in  Imagination  circulates  freely  among all Ranks of People The Guilt of the Miser's Passion lies in its being essentially destructive both of Justice and Benevolence  it is certain that as soon as this Money should come to circu∣late the Nation would be the better for the Robbery and receive the same and as real a Benefit from it as if an Archbishop had left the same Sum to the Public  Fable of the Bees  p  "  HE is abundantly rhetorical on  "the large Catalogue of solid Blessings that accrue from and are owing to intoxicating Gin  Fable of the Bees  p  "  Insomuch that if the Drunken∣ness and Frenzy arising from the excessive Use of this salutary Liquor were curbed by the Magistrate he seems to foretel the most fatal Consequences to the public Wealth and Welfare  HERE then he enumerates several real Crimes which are  necessarily  attended with  great Evils  and these he demonstrates are  accidentally  productive of  some Good  And this indeed is the only Part of his Argu∣ment that is attended with any Degree of Plausibility For here it must be owned there is Room for a dishonest Mind to  con∣found  though by no Means to  convince  an impartial Reader Because the Conse∣quences of these Crimes being of a various and  discordant  Nature some having the Ap∣pearance of  Good  and others of  Ill  to So∣ciety a  rhetorical  Display of the  former  may possibly induce a superficial Enquirer who is caught by a Glare of Eloquence to doubt whether  these  do not really  predomi∣nate  But a moderate Share of Attention  will convince us that this is impossible Because all the real Vices he mentions though they be accidentally productive of some Good yet 'tis such as might effectu∣ally be obtained without them Thus the Money taken wrongfully by Stealth or Rob∣bery is only of Service to the Public by its Circulation But Money may circulate with∣out Stealth or Robbery and therefore 'tis neither the Stealth nor Robbery that is of Service to the Public On the other part there are great and substantial Evils which these Crimes and these alone give Rise to On this Occasion one might be very large on the Terrors and Distress the Murders and consequent Miseries which the Villa∣nies patronized by this Writer do necessa∣rily produce One who was Master of Dr MANDEVILLE's TownRhetoric and  TownExperience  might draw a striking Picture of honest and industrious Families rowzed from Sleep at Midnight only to be plun∣dered and destroyed of the horrid Attempts of abandoned Wickedness let loose from Fear by the Security of Darkness the Shrieks of ravished Maids and Matrons the dying Groans of Brothers Fathers Husbands weltring in their Blood the  Cries of innocent and helpless Orphans weeping over their murdered Parents de∣prived at once of all that were dear to them of all that could yield them Consolation or Support and suffering every vile Indignity that unrelenting Villainy can suggest or per∣petrate And how think you does this Scene of domestic Horror change its ori∣ginal Nature and rise at length into a pub∣lic Blessing Why because the Adven∣turers having made off with their Booty may possibly  "lay it out upon a  Harlot  or squander it in a  Nightcellar  or a  Gin∣shop  Fable of the Bees  p  "  And thus the Money circulates through the Nation But in the mean Time our Philosopher hath forgot the help∣less Family reduced to Beggary by the Prow∣ess of his  nocturnal Herces  He hath for∣got that the fond and indulgent Parent might no less probably have laid out the Money in the temperate Maintenance and liberal Edu∣cation of his Children which is now squan∣dered in unprofitable  Riot  and  Excess  That these Destroyers of other Men's Happiness and their own had they been employed in honest Labour in the Cultivation of  Lands  or the Improvement of  Manufactures  might  have done substantial Services to the Pub∣lic and themselves without the guilty  Alloy  of unprovoked Mischief From these Cir∣cumstances impartially compared 'tis evi∣dent that the only essential Consequence of private Vice is public Misery And thus our Author's new fashioned System of Morals falls back again into nothing  HIS fourth Principle is much less plausi∣ble Indeed he never applies to this but when reduced to the last Necessity When therefore every other Foundation fails him he attempts to impose upon his Reader's Negligence or Simplicity by representing Vice as a  Cause  where in Reality 'tis a  Con∣sequence  Thus he tells us  "Great Wealth and foreign Treasure will ever scorn to come among Men unless you'll admit their  inseparable Companions  Avarice and Luxury Where Trade is considerable Fraud will  intrude  To be at  once well∣bred  and  sincere  is no less than a Contra∣diction And therefore whilst Man ad∣vances in Knowledge and his Manners are polished we must expect to see at the same Time his Desires enlarged his Ap∣petites refined and his  Vices increased  Fable of the Bees  p  "  So again having been driven from his other strong Holds by certain impertinent Re∣markers whom he wisely dismisseth with an Air of Superiority and Contempt he takes Refuge in the same ambiguous Phrases As that  "Vice is  inseparable  from great and potent Societies in the same Manner as  dirty Streets  are a necessary Evil inse∣parable from the  Felicity  of  London  Fable of the Bees  Preface p c  "  NOW though this happy  Simile  may work Wonders in a  CoffeeHouse  amongst those who see every  dirty Alley  pregnant with Demonstration yet 'tis to be hoped more serious Readers may distinguish bet∣ter And be enabled to tell him that be∣fore they grant his Position  that private Vice is public Benefit  they expect he should prove  "that the Dirt in  London  Streets is the Cause or Instrument whereby  London  becomes a populous and flourishing City"  A Proposition almost as remote from com∣mon Apprehension as that  Tenterden Steeple  is the  Cause  of  Goodwin Sands  Thus we see how dextrously he puts the Change upon the unwary Reader and while he pretends to exhibit an  essential Cause  slurs him off with an  accidental Consequence  INTO these four Principles all evidently  False  or  Foreign  to the Purpose his whole Book may be justly analysed Nor is there one Observation in the Compass of so many hundred Pages which tends to support the pernicious Falsehood that disgraceth his  TitlePage  but what will naturally resolve itself into one or other of these wretched  Sophisms  'Tis therefore unnecessary to lead the Reader through all the  Windings  of this immense  Labyrinth  of Falsehood 'tis enough to have given the  Clue  which may safely conduct him through them  SECTION VI  HAVING at Length gained an Ade∣quate Idea of Virtue and found that it is no other than  "the voluntary Production of the greatest public Happiness"  we may now safely proceed to consider  "upon what Foundations Mankind are  obliged  to the Practice of it"  AND here we shall find another meta∣physical  Cloud  resting upon  this  Path in itself plain and easy to all Mankind For the very Notion of  Obligation  to Virtue hath been as much consounded by moral Wri∣ters  as the Idea of  Virtue  itself And here we might travel through another System of  Logomachies  while one asserts that we are obliged to  love  and  pursue  Virtue because  she  is  beautiful  another because Virtue is  good  another because Virtue is  good in itself  a fourth because Virtue is  Truth  a fifth because it is  agreeable to Nature  a sixth be∣cause it is agreeable to the  Relations of Things  BUT 'tis supposed that the intelligent Reader from a review of the first Section of this Essay may be convinced that all these  amusing  Expressions amount to no more than this  "that there is some Rea∣son or other why we ought to practise Virtue but that the particular Reason doth not appear notwithstanding all this refined Pomp of Affirmation"  And as it hath already been made evident that the  Essence  of Virtue consists in a Conformity of our Affections and Actions with the greatest  public Happiness  so it will now appear that  "the only  Reason  or  Motive  by which Individuals can possibly be  induced  or  obliged  to the Practice of Virtue must be the  Feeling  immediate or the  Prospect  of future  private Happiness  "  DOUBTLESS the noble Writer's Admirers will despise and reject this as an unworthy Maxim For so it hath happened that in the Height of their Zeal for supporting his Opinions they generally stigmatize  private Happiness  as a Thing scarce worth a wise Man's enquiring after Indeed the many ambiguous Phrases of their Master have contributed not a little to this  vulgar Error  For in one Place he brands the modern Philosophers and Divines with the Name of Sophisters and Pedants for  "rating Life by the Number and Exquisiteness of the pleasing Sensations  Wit and Hum  Part iii §  "  At other Times he speaks of  Pleasure  with all the Con∣tempt of an antient  Stoic  Moral  Part iii §  In the same high Style of the  Athenian Porch  he pas∣seth Judgment on the Hopes of the Reli∣gious  "They have made Virtue so mer∣cenary a Thing and have talked so much of its  Rewards  that one can hardly tell what there is in it after all which can be  worth  rewarding  Wit  Part ii §  "  So again he de∣rides those  "modern Projectors who would new frame the human Heart and have a mighty Fancy to reduce all its Motions  Balances and Weights to that one Prin∣ciple and Foundation of a cool and deli∣berate  Selfishness  And thus Love of one's Country and Love of Mankind must also be  Selflove  Wit  Part ii §  "  NOW ere we proceed further it may be necessary to remark that in some Degree there hath been a  Strife about Words  in this particular too For these Expressions of  Selfishness  and  Disinterestedness  have been used in a very  loose  and  indeterminate  Man∣ner In one Sense a  Motive  is called  disin∣terested  when it consists in a pure  benevo∣lent  Affection or a Regard to the  moral Sense  In another no Motive is  disin∣terested  For even in acting according to these Impulses of Benevolence and Con∣science we gratify an Inclination and act upon the Principle or  immediate Feeling  of  private Happiness  Thus when we say  "We love Virtue for Virtue's Sake"  'tis only implied that we find immediate Happiness from the Love and Practice of Virtue with∣out Regard to external or future Conse∣quences  ANOTHER Source of mutual Misappre∣hension on this Subject hath been  "the In∣troduction  of  metaphorical  Expressions in∣stead of  proper  ones"  Nothing is so common among the Writers on Morality as  "the Harmony of Virtue""the Pro∣portion of Virtue"  So the noble Writer frequently expresseth himself But his fa∣vourite Term borrowed indeed from the Antients is  "the BEAUTY of Virtue"  Quae si videri posset mirabiles excitaret amores  Cicero  Of this our Author and his Fol∣lowers especially the most ingenious of them  Mr Hutcheson  are so  enamoured  that they seem ut∣terly to have forgot they are  talking in Me∣taphor  when they describe the Charms of this  sovereign Fair  Insomuch that an unexperienced Person who should read their  Encomiums  would naturally fall into the Mistake of him who asked the Philo∣sopher  "Whether the Virtues were not living Creatures  Senecae Epist cxiv  "  Now this  figurative  Manner so essentially interwoven into phi∣losophical Disquisition hath been the Oc∣casion of great Error It tends to mislead us both with regard to the Nature of Vir∣tue and our Obligations to the Practice of it For first it induceth a Persuasion that Virtue is  excellent  without Regard to any of  its Consequences And secondly that he must either want Eyes or common Discern∣ment who doth not at first Sight fall in Love with this  matchless Lady  THEREFORE setting aside as much as may be all ambiguous Expressions it seems evident that  "a Motive from its very Na∣ture must be something that affects  our∣self  "  If any Man hath found out a Kind of Motive which doth not affect  himself  he hath made a deeper Investigation into the  "Springs Weights and Balances"  of the human Heart than I can pretend to Now what can possibly affect  ourself  or deter∣mine us to Action but either the Feeling or Prospect of  Pleasure  or  Pain Happiness  or  Misery  BUT to come to the direct Proof 'Tis evident even to Demonstration that no  Affection  can in the strict Sense be more or less  selfish  or  disinterested  than another because  whatever  be its  Object  the  Af∣fection  itself is  still  no other than a  Mode  either of  Pleasure  or of  Pain  and is there∣fore  equally  to be referred to the  Mind  or  Feeling  of the  Patient  whatever be its  ex∣ternal Occasion  Indeed a late Writer of Subtilty and Refinement hath attempted to  make a Distinction here He says  "It hath been observed that every Act of Virtue or Friendship is attended with a secret  Pleasure  from whence it hath been concluded that Friendship and Vir∣tue could not be disinterested But the Fallacy of this is obvious The virtuous Sentiment or Passion  produces  the Plea∣sure and does not  arise  from it I feel a Pleasure in doing good to my Friend  because  I love him but I do not love him for the Sake of that Pleasure  Hume's  Essays Mor  and  Polit  p  "  Now to me the Fallacy of  this  is obvious For in Fact neither the  Passion  nor the  Plea∣sure  are either the  Cause  or the  Consequence  of each other they neither  produce  nor  arise  from each other because in Reality they are the  same Thing  under  different Ex∣pressions  This will be clear if we state the Case as follows  "To  love  my Friend is to  feel  a  Pleasure  in  doing him Good  "  And conversely  "to feel a  Pleasure  in  doing Good  to my Friend is to  love him  "  Where 'tis plain that the  Terms  are  synony∣mous  The  Pleasure  therefore is the very  Passion itself  and neither  prior  nor  posterior  to it as this Gentleman supposeth  AGAIN that the Pleasures arising from Benevolence and the moral Sense are strictly  Selfish  in this Sense of the Word like every other Enjoyment seems evident from some parallel Concessions of the noble Writer For these seemingly disinterested Pleasures he perpetually sets on a Level with the Perceptions of natural Beauty Order Harmony and Proportion These last are by all acknowledged to be of the selfish Kind therefore the other are so too be∣ing only a  higher Order of the same  and ex∣presly called so by the noble Writer  Moralists  Part ii    THE Reasons why the great universal Principle of  private Happiness  hath not been so clearly seen in the  Benevolent  as in the  SelfPassions  seem to be these First Am∣biguous Expressions such as have been re∣marked above  dly  Perhaps some De∣gree of  Pride  and Affectation of  Merit  because  Merit  seems to appear in what is called  Disinterest    dly  And perhaps principally because in the Exercise of the benevolent Passions the Happiness is essen∣tially  concomitant  with the Passion itself and therefore is not easily separated from it by the  Imagination  so as to be considered  as a  distinct End  Whereas in the Passions called  Selfish  the Happiness sought after is often  unattainable  and therefore easily and necessarily distinguished by the Imagination as a  positive End  This Circumstance of Union however as is judiciously remarked by one of the noble Writer's Followers  Three Treatises by  J H  Treat  d    On Hap∣piness  p  proves the great Superiority and Excellence of the benevolent Affections considered as a Source of Happiness beyond the Passions and Appetites commonly called the  Selfish  BUT although these Observations be ne∣cessary in order to clear up an Affair which hath been much perplexed with philosophi∣cal or  unphilosophical  Refinements yet on a closer Examination it will appear in the most direct Manner from the noble Writer himself that  "there is no other Principle of human Action but that of the  imme∣diate  or  foreseen  Happiness of the Agent"  That all these amusing Speculations con∣cerning the  Comely Fit  and  Decent  all these  verbal  Separations between  Pleasure Interest Beauty  and  Good  might have been sunk in one  precise  and plain Disquisition concerning such Actions and Affections as  yield a  lasting  and such as afford only a  short  and transient  Happiness  For thus af∣ter all his Lordship explains himself  "That  Happiness  is to be pursued and in Fact is always sought after that the Question is not who  loves himself  and who  not  but who  loves  and  serves himself  the  righest  and after the  truest  MannerThat 'tis the Height of  Wisdom  no doubt to be  rightly Selfish  ""Even to leave Family Friends Country and Societyin good Earnest  who would not  if it were  Happiness  to do so  Wit and Hum  Part iii §  "  THESE Expressions are so strongly point∣ed as to leave no further Doubt concern∣ing the noble Writer's Sentiments on this Subject Indeed they are the natural Dic∣tates of common Sense unsophisticated with false Philosophy In every subsequent De∣bate therefore wherein his Lordship's Opi∣nions are concerned we may safely build on this as an acknowledged and sure Foun∣dation  "that the Motives or natural Obli∣gations of Man to the Practice of Virtue can only arise from a Sense of his  present  or a Prospect of his  future Happiness  "  SECTION VII  NOW this Conclusion will carry us to another Question of a very interesting and abstruse Nature That is  "How far and upon what Foundation the uniform Practice of Virtue is  really  and  clearly  connected with the Happiness of every Individual"  For so far as we have seen and no further can every Individual be na∣turally moved or obliged to the Practice of it  THIS is evidently a Question of  Fact  And as it relates to the  Happiness  of  Man  can only be determined by appealing to his  Constitution  If  this  be indeed  uniform  and  invariable  that is if every Individual hath the same Perceptions Passions and Desires then indeed the Sources of Happiness must be  similar  and  unchangeable  If on the con∣trary different Men be differently consti∣tuted if they have  different  Perceptions Passions and Desires then must the Sources of their Happiness be equally  va∣rious  IT should seem therefore that  "while Moralists have been enquiring into hu∣man Happiness they have generally con∣sidered  it as arising from one  uniform  and  particular  Source instead of tracing it up to those various Fountains whence it really springs which are indefinitely various combined and indeterminable"  And this seems to have been the most general Foundation of Error  IF we speak with Precision there are but three Sources in Man of Pleasure and Pain Happiness and Misery These are  Sense Imagination  and the  Passions  Now the slightest Observation will convince us that these are associated separated and combined in Man with a Variety almost infinite In some the Pleasures and Pains of  Sense  pre∣dominate Imagination is dull the Passions inactive In others a more delicate Frame awakens all the Powers of Imagination the Passions are refined the Senses dis∣regarded A third Constitution is carried away by the Strength of Passion The Calls of Sense are contemned and Imagination becomes no more than the necessary Instru∣ment of some further Gratification  From overlooking this plain Fact seems to have arisen the Discordance among Phi∣losophers concerning the Happiness of Man And while  each  hath attempted to exhibit  one favourite Picture as the  Paragon  or  Standard  of human Kind they have  all  omitted some Ten thousand other Resem∣blances which actually subsist in Nature  THUS most of the  Epicurean  Sect tho' not the Founder of it have discarded  Be∣nevolence  and  Virtue  from their System of  private  Happiness The modern Patro∣nizers of this Scheme Mr HOBBES Dr MANDEVILLE and several  French  Writers after heaping up a Collection of sordid In∣stances which prove the  sensual  Inclinations and  Selfishness  of Man leap at once to their desired Conclusion that the pretended pub∣lic Affections are therefore no more than the same low Passions in Disguise That  Benevolence  makes no Part of Man's Na∣ture that the human Kind are absolutely unconnected with each other in Point of Affection And that every Individual  seeks  and  finds  his  private  Happiness in and  from himself alone  THE noble Writer on the contrary viewing the brighter Parts of human Na∣ture through the amiable Medium of the  Socratic  Philosophy and fixing his Atten∣tion on the  public Affections  as the Instru∣ments both of public and private Happi∣ness  rejects the  Epicurean's  Pretences with Disdain And fully conscious of the high Claims and Energy of Virtue affirms that the  private Affections  are by no means a Foundation for  private Happiness  That on the contrary we must universally pro∣mote the Welfare of others if we would effectually secure our own And that in every Case  "  Virtue  is the  Good  and  Vice  the  Ill  of every one  Enquiry concerning Virtue  passim  "  'TIS plain no two Systems of Philosophy can be more  discordant  than these yet each of them have obtained a Number of Parti∣zans in all Ages of the World The Que∣stion relates to a  Fact  and the Fact lies open to the  personal Examination  of all Mankind Whence then can so strange an Opposition of Sentiments arise  THIS seems to have arisen not from a  false  but a  partial  View and Examination of the Subject The  Stoic  Party dwell alto∣gether on the  social  or  public  the  Epicurean  no less on the  private  or  selfish  Affections On these respectively they declaim so that according to the one Mankind are naturally a Race of  DemiGods  according to the other a Crew of  Devils Both  forgetting  what is unquestionably the Truth that these  social  and  private  Affections are blend∣ed in an endless Variety of Degrees and thus form an infinite Variety of Inclinations and of Characters Many of the particular Facts therefore which these two Sects al∣ledge are true But the  general  Conse∣quence they draw from these  particular  Facts is groundless and imaginary Thus 'tis true that Mankind reap high Enjoy∣ments from the Senses Imagination and Passions without any regard to the public Affections But the Consequence which the  Epicurean  would draw from hence that  "therefore the public Affections are never in any Case a Source of private Happi∣ness"  this is entirely void of Evidence It supposeth Mankind to be  one uniform  Subject while it is a Subject infinitely  va∣rious  that every Individual has the same Feelings Appetites Fancies and Affections while in Fact they are mixed and com∣bined in an endless Variety of Degrees So on the contrary it must appear to every im∣partial Observer that  "the Exercise of the public Affections is a Source of the highest Gratification to many Individuals"  But the  Stoic's  Conclusion that  "therefore the  uniform Exercise of the public Affections in Preference to every other is the only Source of Happiness to every Individual"  this is a Conclusion equally void of Evi∣dence For like its opposite Extreme it supposeth Mankind to be one uniform Sub∣ject while in Fact it is a Subject indefi∣nitely various It supposes that every Indi∣vidual has the same Feelings Appetites Fancies and Affections while in Reality they are mixed and combined in an endless Variety of Degrees  LET us now assign the most probable Foundation on which these  narrow  and  partial  Systems have been so commonly embraced For that two Theories so op∣posite and so devoid of all rational Support should have made their Way in the World without some  permanent  Cause beyond the Instability of mere  Chance  seems hardly credible  IT should seem therefore that  "while the Patronizers of these two Systems have attempted to give a general Picture of the human Species they have all along taken the Copy from themselves And thus their Philosophy instead of being a true History of Nature is no more than the  History of their own  Imaginations  or  Af∣fections  "  This Truth may receive suf∣ficient Confirmation from the Lives and Conduct of all the old Philosophers from the  elegant  PLATO walking on his rich  Car∣pets  to the  unbred  CYNIC snarling in his  Tub  As every Man's  Constitution  led him so he adopted this or that Sect of  Philoso∣phy  and reasoned concerning  Fitness De∣cency  and  Good  Read the Characters of CATO and CESAR and you will clearly dis∣cover the true Foundation on which the one became a rigid  Stoic  the other a gross  Epicurean  The first yet a  Boy  discovered such an  inflexible  Adherence to the Privi∣leges of his Country that he refused his As∣sent to what he thought a Violation of them though threatened with immediate Death  Plutarchi  Cato Utic  The  latter  yet unpractised in the Subtilties of Philosophy and under the sole Dominion of natural Temper discovered at his first Appearance in the World such Traits of  Art Spirit  and  Ambition  that SYLLA declared he saw something more formidable than MARIUS rising in him  Suetonii  Julius Cesar  To bring down the Observation to modern Times 'tis evident that the Patronizers  of these two Systems inlist themselves ac∣cording to the secret Suggestions of their several Passions 'Tis well known that the Writer of the  Fable of the Bees  was nei∣ther a  Saint  in his Life nor a  Hermit  in his Diet He seems to have been Master of a very considerable  Sagacity  much Know∣ledge of the World as it appears in popu∣lous  Cities  extremely sensible to all the grosser  bodily  Enjoyments but for  Delicacy  of Sentiment Imagination or Passion for an exquisite  Taste  either in  Arts  or  Morals  he appears to have been  incapable  of itThe noble Writer is known to have been of a Frame the very Reverse of this His  Con∣stitution  was neither more nor less opposite to Dr MANDEVILLE's than his Philoso∣phy His sensual Appetites were weak his Imagination all alive noble and capaci∣ous his Passions were accordingly refined and his public Affections in  Fancy  at least predominant To these Instances a mo∣derate Share of Sagacity and Knowledge of the World may add others innumerable in observing the Temper and Conduct of the Followers os these two Systems who al∣ways take Party according to the Biass of their own Constitution Among the  Epi∣cureans  we ever find Men of high Health florid Complexions firm Nerves and a Ca∣pacity for Pleasure Of the  Stoic  Party are the delicate or sickly Frames Men incapa∣ble of the grosser sensual Enjoyments and who either  are  or  think  themselves  virtu∣ous  Now from these accumulated Proofs we may be convinced that  "they who give us these  uniform  Pictures of a Subject so  various  as  Mankind  cannot have drawn them from  Nature  That on the con∣trary they have copied them from their own  Hearts  or  Imaginations  and fondly erected  themselves  into a general Standard of the  human Species  "  BUT although these Observations may afford sufficient Proof that the  Stoic  and  Epicurean  Pictures of Mankind are equally partial yet still it remains to be enquired how far upon the whole the human Kind in Reality leans towards the  one  or the  other  That is  "how far and in what Degree the uniform Practice of Virtue constitutes the Happiness of Individuals"  Now the only Method of determining this Question will be to select some of the most striking  Features  of the human Heart By this Means we may  approach  towards a real  Likeness  though from that infinite Variety which subsists in Nature the  Draught  must ever be inadequate and  defective  TO begin with the lowest Temperature of the human Species  "there are great Numbers of Mankind in whom the  Senses  are the chief Sources of Pleasure and Pain"  To the Harmony of Sounds the Beauty of Forms the Decorum of Actions they are utterly insensible They are sagacious and learned in all the Grati∣fications of Sense but if you talk to them of the public Affections of Generosity Kindness Friendship Goodwill you talk in a Language they understand not They seem in a Manner unconnected with the rest of their Kind they view the Praises Censures Enjoyments and Sufferings of others with an Eye of perfect Indifference To Men thus formed how can Virtue gain Admittance Do you appeal to their  Taste  of Beauty They have none To their acknowledged Perceptions of  Right  and  Wrong  These they Measure by their pri∣vate  Interest  To the Force of the public  Affections  They never felt them Thus every Avenue is foreclosed by which  Virtue  should enter  THE next remarkable Peculiarity is  "where not the Senses but  Imagination  is the predominant Source of Pleasure"  Here the Taste always runs into the elegant Refinements of polite Arts and Acquire∣ments of Painting Music Architecture Poetry Sculpture Or in Defect of this truer Taste on the false Delicacies of Dress Furniture and Equipage Yet Experience tells us that this Character is widely dif∣ferent from the virtuous one That all the Powers of Imagination may subsist in their full Energy while the  public Affections  and  moral Sense  are weak or utterly inactive Nor can there be any necessary Connexion between these different Feelings because we see Numbers immersed in all the finer Pleasures of Imagination who never once consider them as the Means of  giving Plea∣sure  to  others  but merely as a  selfish  Gratifi∣cation This the noble Writer seems to have been aware of and not without great Ad∣dress endeavours to convert the Fact into a Proof of his main Theory though in Rea∣lity it affords the strongest Evidence against him  "The  Venustum  the  Honestum  the  Decorum  of Things will sorce its Way They who refuse to give it Scope in the  nobler Subjects of a rational and moral Kind will find its Prevalency elsewhere in an inferior Order of Thingsas either in the Study of common  Arts  or in the Care and Culture of mere mechanic  Beauties  The  Specter  still will  haunt  us in  some Shape or other  and when driven from our cool Thoughts and frighted from the  Closet  will meet us even at Court and fill our Heads with Dreams of Grandeur Titles Honours and a false Magnificence and Beauty  Wit and Hum  Part iv §  "  All this is ingenious and plausible And the very ele∣gant Allusion of  "the Specter still haunt∣ing us in some Shape or other"  seems at first View to imply that even the most ob∣stinate Endeavours to get rid of the Force of moral Beauty are ineffectual and vain But a nearer Examination will convince us that the noble Writer applies here to  Elo∣quence  rather than  Argument  and puts us off with a  Metaphor  instead of a  Reason  For the Pleasures of Imagination whether they run in the Channel of polite Arts Fur∣niture Planting Building or Equipage are indeed no  Specters  but independent  Reali∣ties  sairly existing in the Mind They have  no immediate or necessary Connexion with the Happiness of Mankind which is often and  designedly  violated in order to gain the Possession of them 'Tis true the Pleasures of Imagination and Virtue are often  united  in the same Mind but 'tis equally true that they are often  separate  that they who are most sensible to the  one  are entire Strangers to the  other  that one Man to  purchase  a fine  Picture  will  oppress  his Tenant that another to  relieve  his distressed Tenant will  sell  his Statues or his Pictures The Reason is evident The one draws his Plea∣sure from  Imagination  the other from  Af∣fection  only 'Tis clear therefore that  "where  Imagination  is naturally the pre∣dominant Source of Pleasure"  the Mo∣tives to Virtue must be very  partial  and  weak  since the chief Happiness ariseth from a Source entirely distinct from the  benevolent Affections  ANOTHER and very different Tempera∣ture of the Heart of Man is that  "wherein neither Sense nor Imagination but the PASSIONS are the chief Sources of Plea∣sure and Pain"  This often forms the  best  or the  worst  of Characters As it runs either First Into the Extreme of Selfish∣ness  Jealousy Pride Hatred Envy and Revenge or  dly  Into the amiable Af∣fections of Hope Faith Candour Pity Generosity and Goodwill or  dly  Into a various Mixture or Combination of these which is undoubtedly the most common Temperature of human Kind  NOW to the first of these Tempers how can we affirm with Truth that there is a natural Motive or Obligation to Virtue On the contrary it should seem that if there be any Motive it must be to  Vice  For 'tis plain that from the Losses Disap∣pointments and Miseries of Mankind such vile Tempers draw their chief Felicity The noble Writer indeed in his Zeal for Virtue considers these black Passions as  un∣natural  and brands them as a Source of  constant Misery  Enquiry  And sure it would be matter of Joy to all good Men to find his Proofs convincing But if indeed this be not a true Representation of the Case I see not what Service can be done to the In∣terests of  Virtue  by  disguising  Truth 'Tis not the Part of a Philosopher to write  Pane∣gyrics  but to  investigate  the real State of human Nature and the only Way of doing  this to any good Purpose is to do it  impar∣tially  For with regard to human Nature as well as Individuals  "Flattery is a Crime no less than Slander"  WHEN therefore the noble Writer calls these Affections  unnatural  he doth not suf∣ficiently explain himself If indeed by their being unnatural he means that  "they are such in their Degrees or Objects as to violate the public Happiness which is the main Intention of Nature"  in this Sense 'tis acknowledged they are  unnatural  But this Interpretation is foreign to the Que∣stion because it affects not the  Individual  But if by their being  unnatural  he would imply that they are  "a Source of constant Misery to the Agent"  this seems a Pro∣position not easy to be determined in the Affirmative  FOR the main Proof which he brings in Support of this Assertion is  "that the Men of  gentlest Dispositions  and  best of Tempers  have at some time or other been sufficiently acquainted with those Distur∣bances which at ill Hours even small Occasions are apt to raise From these slender Experiences of Harshness and ill Humour they fully know and will con∣fess  the ill Moments which are passed when the Temper is ever so little galled and fretted How must it fare therefore with those who hardly know any better Hours in Life and who for the greatest Part of it are agitated by a thorow  active Spleen  a close and settled Malignity and Rancour  Enquiry  B ii Part ii §  "  NOW this Instance is by no means suf∣ficient to support the Affirmation For 'tis plain that in the Case of the  "Men of gentlest Dispositions and best of Tempers occasionally agitated by ill Humour"  there must be a strong Opposition and Dis∣cordance a violent Conflict between the ha∣bitual Affections of Benevolence and these accidental Eruptions of Spleen and Rancour which rise to obstruct their Course A Warfare of this Kind must indeed be a State of complete Misery when all is Uproar within and the distracted Heart set at Va∣riance with itself But the Case is widely different where  "a thorow active Spleen prevails a close and  settled  Malignity and Rancour"  For in this Temper there is no parallel Opposition of contending Pas∣sions Nor therefore any similar Founda∣tion  for inward Disquiet and intense Misery So much the noble Writer himself is obliged to own elsewhere  "Is there that sordid Creature on Earth who does not prize his own EnjoymentIs not  Malice  and  Cruelty  of the  highest Relish  with some Natures  Moralists  Part i  "  Again and still more fully to the Purpose  "Had we Sense we should consider 'tis in Reality the  thorow  Profli∣gate the very  complete unnatural Villain  alone who can any way  bid  for  Happiness  with the honest Man True Interest is wholly on the one Side or the other All between is Inconsistency Irresolution Remorse Vexation and an Aguefit  Wit and Hum  Part iv §  "  Neither is this Acknowledgment peculiar to himself  "To be  consistent  either in Vir∣tue or in Vice"  was the farthest that some of the most penetrating among the Ancients could carry the Point of  Morals  See Arrian  Epict  lib iii c  Thus where the  selfish  or  malevolent  Af∣fections happen to prevail there can be no internal  Motive  or natural  Obligation  to  Virtue  ON the contrary where the amiable Af∣fections of Hope Candour Generosity and  Benevolence predominate in this best and happiest of Tempers Virtue hath indeed all the Force and Energy which the noble Writer attributes to her Charms For where the Calls of Sense are weak the Imagination active and refined the public Affections predominant there the  moral Sense  must naturally reign with uncontrouled Authority must produce all that SelfSatisfaction that Consciousness of merited Kindness and Esteem in which his Lord∣ship affirms the very Essence of our Obli∣gation to Virtue doth consist This shall with Pleasure be acknowledged nay as∣serted as  "the happiest of all Tempera∣ments"  whenever it can be  found  or  ac∣quired  To a Mind thus formed Virtue doth indeed bring an  immediate  and  ample Reward  of perfect Peace and sincere Happi∣ness in all the common Situations of Life It may therefore be with Truth affirmed that a Temper thus framed is indeed na∣turally and internally obliged to the uni∣form Practice of Virtue  THERE are besides these an endless Va∣riety of Characters formed from the vari∣ous Combinations of these essential  Ingre∣dients  which are not designed as a full  Expression  of all the Tempers of Mankind They are the Materials only out of which these Characters are formed They are no more than the several Species of  simple Co∣lours  laid as it were upon the  Pallet  which variously  combined  and associated by the Hand of an experienced Master would indeed call forth every striking  Resemblance  every changeful Feature of the  Heart  of  Man  NOW among all this infinite Variety of Tempers which is found in Nature we see there cannot be any uniform Motive or Ob∣ligation to Virtue save only  "where the Senses are weak the Imagination refined and the public Affections strongly predo∣minant"  For in every other Character where either the Senses gross Imagination or selfish Passions prevail a natural Oppo∣sition or Discordance must arise and destroy the uniform Motive to Virtue by throwing the Happiness of the Agent into a different Channel How seldom this sublime Tem∣per is to be found is hard to say But this may be affirmed with Truth that every Man is not  really  possessed of it in the Conduct of Life who  enjoys  it in  Imagination  or  admires  it in his Closet as it lies in the  En∣quiry  concerning Virtue  A Character of this supreme Excellence must needs be  ap∣proved  by most And the  Heart  of Man be∣ing an unexhausted Fountain of  SelfDeceit  what it  approves  is forward to think itself possessed of Thus a lively  Imagination  and unperceived  SelfLove  fetter the Heart in certain  ideal  Bonds of their own creating Till at Length some turbulent and furious Passion arising in its Strength breaks these fantastic Shackles which Fancy had im∣posed and leaps to its Prey like a  Tyger  chained by  Cobwebs  SECTION VIII  FROM these different Views of hu∣man Nature let us now bring this Argu∣ment to a Conclusion  THE noble Writer's Scheme of Morals therefore being grounded on a Supposition which runs through the whole Course of his Argument that  "all Mankind are na∣turally capable of attaining a  Taste  or  Re∣lish  for  Virtue  sufficient for every Pur∣pose of social Life"  seems essentially de∣fective For from the Enquiry already made into the real and various Constitution  of Man it appears that a great Part of the Species are naturally incapable of this  fan∣cied  Excellence That the various Mix∣ture and Predominancy of  Sense Imagi∣nation  and  Passion  give a different Cast and Complexion of Mind to every Individual That the  Feeling  or  Prospect  of Happiness can only arise from this Combination That consequently where the benevolent Af∣fections and moral Sense are weak the selfish Passions and Perceptions headstrong there can be no internal Motive or natural Obligation to the  consistent  Practice of Vir∣tue  THE most plausible Pretence I could ever meet with amidst all the Pomp of Decla∣mation thrown out in Support of this  AllSufficiency  of a  Taste  in Morals is this  "That although the Force and Energy of this Taste for Virtue appears not in every Individual yet the Power lies dormant in every human Breast and needs only be called forth by a  voluntary SelfDiscipline  in order to be brought to its just Per∣fection That the Improvement in our Taste in Morals is parallel to the Progress of the Mind in every other Art and Ex∣cellence in  Painting Music Architecture  Picture  In which a  true  Taste how∣ever  natural  to Man is not born with him but formed and brought forth to Action by a proper  Study  and  Applica∣tion  "  THE noble Writer hath innumerable Passages of this Kind So many indeed that it were Labour lost to transcribe them  Charact  passim  And one of his Followers hath affirmed in still more emphatical Expressions if possi∣ble than his Master that  "the Height of  Virtuosoship  is VIRTUE  Letters of Hydaspes to Phi∣lemon  Let vi  "  NOW this State of the Case though at first View it carries some Degree of Plausi∣bility yet on a closer Examination destroys the whole System For if as it certainly is the  Capacity  for a Taste in  Morals  be similar to a  Capacity  for a Taste in  Arts  'tis clear that the most assiduous Culture or SelfDiscipline can never make it even  ge∣neral  much less  universal  One Man we see hath a Capacity or Genius for Painting another for Music a third for Architecture a fourth for Poetry Torture each of them as you please you cannot infuse a Taste for any but his own  congenial  Art If you at∣tempt  to make the Poet an Architect or the Painter a Musician you may make a pre∣tending  Pedant  never an accomplished  Master  'Tis the same in Morals Where the benevolent Affections are naturally strong  there  is a  Capacity  for a high  Taste  in Virtue Where these are  weak  or  wanting  there is in the same Proportion  little  or  no Capacity  for a  Taste  in Virtue To harangue therefore on the superior Happiness attend∣ing the Exercise of the public Affections is quite foreign to the Purpose This superior Happiness is allowed where the public Af∣fections can be  found  or  made  predominant But how can any Consequence be drawn from hence so as to influence those who never felt the Impulse of public Affection Are not the Pleasures of Poetry Painting Music sublime pure and lasting to those who  taste  them Doth it therefore follow that all Mankind or any of them can be harangued into a  Taste  and  Love  of these elegant Arts while the very Capacity of re∣ceiving Pleasure from them is  wanting  Thus in Morals where a similar Incapacity takes Place through the natural Want of a lively Benevolence no Progress can ever be made in the  Taste  or  Relish  for virtuous En∣joyment  Though therefore you should prove as indeed one of Lord SHAFTES∣BURY's Followers hath done  "that Virtue is accommodate to all Places and Times is  durable selfderived  and  indeprivable  Three Treat by  J H  Treat  d    On Happiness  "  whence he concludes it has the best Title to the Character of the sovereign Good yet all the while the main Point in Debate is taken for granted that is  "whether the Possession of it be any  Good  at all"  Now to those who receive no Increase of  internal  Happiness from it it cannot be a  Good  And where there is a natural  Defect  of be∣nevolent Affection it can give no  internal  Happiness Consequently though it have all the other Characters of the  Sumnium Bonum  though it be  durable selfderived  and  indeprivable  it can never by such be regarded as the  sovereign Good  'TIS pleasant enough to observe the Ar∣gumentation of the Writer last mentioned After describing  "the fairest and most ami∣able of Objects the true and perfect Man that Ornament of Humanity that god∣like Being without Regard either to Plea∣sure or Pain uninfluenced either by Pro∣sperity or Adversity superior to the World  and its best and worst Events"  He then raiseth an Objection  "Does not this System border a little upon the Chimeri∣cal"  On my Word a shrewd Que∣stion and well worth a good Answer and thus he clears it up  "It seems to require said I a Perfection to which no Indivi∣dual ever arrived That very Transcen∣dence said he is an Argument on its be∣half Were it of a Rank inferior it would not be that Perfection which we seek Would you have it said I beyond Nature If you mean replied he beyond any particular or individual Nature most undoubtedly I would  Three Treat by  J H  Treat  d    On Happiness  p  "  'Tis not there∣fore to be wondered at that this Gentleman wrapped up in  Visions  of ideal Perfection should express  "his Contempt of those su∣perficial Censurers who profess to refute what they want even Capacities to com∣prehend  Ibid p  "  Doubtless he means those  groveling  Observers who draw their Ideas of Mankind  "from particular or individual Natures"  and have not yet risen to  "the  beatific Vision  Ibid  of the perfect Man"  Indeed the Gentleman frankly owns  "that  Practice too often  creeps  where Theory can  soar  Three Treat by  J H  Treat  d    On Happiness  p  "  And this I take to be a true Account of the Matter  THUS as according to these Moralists the  Relish  or  Taste  for Virtue is similar to a Taste for Arts so what is said of the Poet the Painter and Musician may with equal Truth be said of the Man of Virtue  Nascitur non fit  Hence it is evident that the noble Writer's System which supposeth all Men capable of this exalted Taste is chimerical and groundless  BUT even supposing all Men capable of this refined Taste in Morals there would arise an unanswerable Objection against the Efficacy of this refined Theory Though it were allowed that all Mankind have the same delicate Perception of  moral  as some few have of  natural  Beauty yet the Parallel would by no means hold that  "as the  Vir∣tuoso  always pursues his Taste in Arts  consistently  so the Man of  Virtue  must be equally  consistent  in  Action  and  Beha∣viour  "  For the  Virtuoso  being only en∣gaged in mere  Speculation  hath no oppo∣site Affections to counteract his Taste He  meets with no Obstructions in his Admira∣tion of Beauty His Enthusiasm takes its unbounded Flight not retarded by any Im∣pediments of a discordant Nature But the Man of  Virtue  hath a different and more difficult Task to perform He hath often a numerous Train of Passions and these per∣haps the most violent to oppose He must labour through the surrounding Demands and Allurements of selfish Appetite Must subdue the Sollicitations of every the most natural Affection when it opposes the Dic∣tates of a pure Benevolence Hence even supposing the most refined Taste for Virtue common to all it must ever be retarded in its Progress often baffled and overthrown amidst the  Struggle  of contending  Passions  THIS seems to be a full and sufficient Reply to all that can be urged in Support of this fantastic System from a View of  human Nature  But as the noble Writer hath at∣tempted to confirm his Theory by some collateral Arguments of another Kind it may be proper here to consider their real Weight  HE urges therefore the Probability at least if not the certain Truth of his Hypo∣thesis from hence  "That it would be an  Imputation on the Wisdom of the Deity to suppose that he had formed Man so imperfect that the true Happiness of the Individual should not always coincide with that of the whole Kind  Enquiry  "  And beyond Question the Assertion is true But the Consequence he draws from it  "that therefore human Happiness must always consist in the immediate Feeling of virtu∣ous Enjoyment"  is utterly groundless This Inference seems to have been drawn from a View of the  Brute  Creation in which we find  Instincts  or  immediate Feel∣ings  are the only Motives to Action and in which we find too that these immediate Propensities are  sufficient  for all the Pur∣poses of their Being In this Constitution of Things the Creator's Wisdom is emi∣nently displayed because through a Defect of  Reason  or  Reflexion  no other kind of Principle could possibly have taken Place But the Conclusion drawn from thence  "that Man must have a similar Strength of Instinct implanted in him in order to di∣rect him to his supreme Happiness"  this is without Foundation Because the Deity hath given him not only  present  Per∣ceptions  but  Reason Reflexion  and a  Fore∣sight  of  future  Good and Evil together with a sufficient Power to obtain the one and avoid the other As therefore Man hath sufficient Notices of the  moral Government  of GOD which will at length produce a perfect Coincidence between the  virtuous  Conduct and the  Happiness  of every Indivi∣dual it implies no essential Defect of Wis∣dom in the Creator to suppose that he hath not given this  universal  and  unerring  Biass towards Virtue to the whole human Species Man is enabled to pursue and obtain his pro∣per Happiness by  Reason  Brutes by  Instinct  AGAIN the noble Writer often attempts to strengthen his Argument by  "represent∣ing the  external Good  which naturally  flows  from  Virtue  and the  external  Evils which naturally  attend  on Vice  Enquiry  B ii P i §  "  But sure this is rather deserting than confirming his  particular  Theory which is to prove that Happiness is  essential  to  Virtue  and  inseparable  from it  "That Misery is  essential  to  Vice  and inseparable from it"  Now in bringing his Proofs from Happiness or Misery of the  external  Kind he surely deserts his original Intention Be∣cause  these  Externals  are not  immediate  but  consequential  not  certain  but  contingent  They are precisely of the Nature of  Reward  and  Punishment  and therefore can have no Part in the Question now before us which relates solely to  "that Happiness or Misery arising from the inward State of the  Mind Affections  and  moral Sense  on the Commission of Vice or the Practice of  Virtue  "  And this hath been already considered at large  HOWEVER that nothing may be omitted which can even remotely affect the Truth we may observe in passing that after all the laboured and  wellmeant  Declamation on this Subject 'tis much easier to prove  "that  Vice  is the Parent of  external  Misery than that  Virtue  is the Parent of  external  Hap∣piness"  'Tis plain that no Man can be vici∣ous in any considerable  Degree  but he must suffer either in his  Health  his  Fame  or  For∣tune  Now the Generality of Moralists after proving or illustrating this have taken it for granted as a certain Consequence that the external Goods of Life are by the Law of Contraries in a similar Manner annexed to the Practice of Virtue But in Reality the Proof can reach no further than to shew  the happy Consequences of  Innocence  which is a very different Thing from  Virtue  for  Innocence  is only the  abstaining  from  Evil Virtue  the actual Production of  Good  Now 'tis evident indeed that by  abstaining  from  Evil  that is by  Innocence  we  must  stand clear of the Miseries to which we expose ourselves by the  Commission  of it And this is as far as the Argument will go But if we rigorously examine the external Conse∣quences of an  active  Virtue in such a World as this we shall find it must be often maintained at the Expence both of  Health Ease  and  Fortune  often the Loss of Friends and Increase of Enemies not to mention the unwearied Diligence of  Envy  which is ever watchful and prepared to blast distin∣guished Merit In the mean time the  in∣noxious  Man sits unmolested and tranquil  loves  Virtue and  praiseth  it avoids the  Miseries  of  Vice  and the  Fatigues  of  active  Virtue offends no Man and therefore is beloved by all and for the rest makes it up by fair  Words  and civil Deportment  "Thus  Innocence  and not  Virtue Ab∣slinence  from  Evil  not the  Production  of Good is the furthest Point to which Mankind in general can be carried from  a Regard to the  external  Consequences of Action"  BUT whenever Appearances grow too strong against the noble Writer's System he takes Refuge in an  apage Vulgus  As he had before allowed that  "the Vul∣gar may swallow any sordid Jest or Buf∣foonry"  so here he frequently suggests that among the same Ranks  "any kind of sordid Pleasure will go down"  But  "as it must be a finer Kind of Wit that takes with the Men of Breeding"  so in Morals  "the  Relish  or  Tasle  for Virtue is what na∣turally prevails in the higher Stages of Life That the  liberal  and  polished  Part of Mankind are disposed to treat every other Principle of Action as groundless and  ima∣ginary  But that among these the  Taste  in Morals if properly cultivated must needs be sufficient for all the Purposes of Virtue  See Misc  d  c and many other detached Pas∣sages  "  IN reply to this which is perhaps the weakest Pretence of all that the noble Wri∣ter hath alledged we need only observe that those who are born to  Honours Power  and  Fortune  come into the World with the  same  various  Mixture and  Predominancy  of  Sense Imagination  and  Affections  with the  lowest  Ranks of Mankind So that if they really enjoy better Opportunities of being compleatly virtuous these must arise not from their internal  Constitution  but their external  Situation  in Life Let us examine how far this may give a Biass either towards Vice or Virtue  NOW 'tis plain that with regard to the  Senses  or bodily  Appetites  the Possession of Power and Fortune must be rather hurtful than favourable to Virtue Wealth gives Opportunity of  Indulgence  and Indulgence naturally  inflames  Hence the Habits of  sensual  Inclination must in general be stronger in the  Lord  than the  Peasant  Therefore as nothing tends so much to imbrute the Man and sink every nobler Affection of the Mind as a servile Attendance on sensual Pleasure so in this Regard the Possession of Power and Fortune is rather  dangerous  than savourable to Virtue  THE same may be affirmed in respect to the  Passions  or  Affections  Can any thing tend so much to render any Passion ungo∣vernable as to know that we  need not  go∣vern it That our Power Riches and Au∣thority  raise us  above Controul  That we can hate oppress revenge with  Impunity  Are not the  Great  of all others most ob∣noxious to  Flattery  Does not this tend to produce and nourish an  overweening  Opinion of  themselves  an unjust  Contempt  of  others  And is not  true Virtue  more likely to be  lost  than improved amidst all these surrounding Temptations  THE  Imagination  indeed is often refined and  Reason  improved in the higher Ranks of Life beyond the Reach of the  mere Vul∣gar  But they are little acquainted with human Nature who think that  Reason  and  Imagination  among the Bulk of Mankind are any thing more than the  Ministers  of the  ruling Appetites  and  Passions  Especially where the Appetites and Passions are in∣flamed by the  early  and  habitual  Possession of Honours Power and Riches  BUT still it will be urged that the  Great  are under the Dominion of a powerful Prin∣ciple which is almost unknown among the  Vulgar  The Principle of HONOURwhich is a perfect  Balance  against all these surrounding Difficulties and a full  Security  to  Virtue  WITH regard to this  boasted  Principle a very material Distinction must be made By  Honour  is sometimes meant  "an Af∣fection of Mind determining the Agent to the Practice of what is right without any Dependence on other Men's Opi∣nions"  Now this is but the  moral Sense  under a new Appellation It ariseth too not from any particular  Situation  of Life but from the natural  Constitution  of the Mind Accordingly it is not confined to any one Rank of Men but is seen promiscu∣ously among the  Great  and  Vulgar  'Tis therefore entirely beyond the present Que∣stion which only relates to such Circum∣stances as are peculiar to  high Life  THE other and more common Accep∣tation of the Word  Honour  and in which alone it belongs peculiarly to the  Great  is  "an Affection of the Mind determining the Agent to such a Conduct as may gain him the  Applause  or  Esteem  of those whose good Opinion he is fond of"  Now this Love of  Fame  and Fear of  Disgrace  though as a  secondary  Motive to Action it be often of the highest Consequence in Life though it often  counterfeits  some∣times even  rivals  Benevolence itself yet as  a  principal  Motive there cannot be a more  precarious  Foundation of Virtue For the  Effects  of this Principle will always depend on the  Opinions  of others It will always take its particular Complexion from  these  and must always  vary  with them Thus 'tis a Matter of mere  Accident  whether its Consequences be  good  or  bad wholesome  or  pernicious  If the  applanded Maxims  be founded in  Benevolence  the Principle will so far lead to  Virtue  If they be founded in  Pride Folly  or  Contempt  the Principle will lead to  Vice  And without any designed Satire on the  Great  it must be owned the latter of these hath ever been the  predomi∣nant  Character of  Honour  It were false indeed to affirm that the Principle hath no Mixture of  benevolent  Intention yet 'tis equally clear that its  chief  Design is not so much to secure the  Happiness  of  all  as to maintain the  Superiority  of a  few  And hence this Principle hath ever led its Vota∣ries to abhor the Commission not so much of what is  unjust  as of what is  contemptible  Thus it is clear that the Principle of  Ho∣nour  as distinguished from  benevolent  Af∣fection and the  moral Sense  can never be a  sufficient Foundation for the  uniform  Prac∣tice of  Virtue  THESE are the main Arguments by which the noble Writer hath attempted to support this imagined  Allsufficiency  of the  Relish  or  Taste  in  Morals  Had human Nature been indeed that  uniform  and  noble  Thing which he seems to have  thought  it he had surely been right in fixing the  Obligations  of  Man  to  Virtue  on so generous and amiable a Principle But as on Examination it ap∣pears that he hath all along supposed this human Nature to be  what it is not  his System is  visionary  and  groundless  and his applauded Theory only fit to find a Place with the boasted Power of the great old  Geometer  when he said  Give me but a  Place  to set my Foot on and I will move the whole Earth    MOST full indeed and clear to this pur∣pose are the Words of the noble Writer himself Who in his  miscellaneous  Capa∣city and in a  merry  Mood seems to have spoken more of Truth than I believe he would care to stand to  "Such has been of late our dry Task No wonder if it carries indeed a  meagre  and  raw  Ap∣pearance  It may be looked on in Philo∣sophy as worse than a mere  Egyptian  Imposition For to make Brick without Straw or Stubble is perhaps an easier Labour than to prove Morals without a World and establish a Conduct of Life without the Supposition of any thing living or extant besides our  immediate Fancy  and World of  Imagination  Misc iv c  "  THESE Sallies might possibly have seem∣ed difficult to account for had not the no∣ble Writer himself saved us the Labour of this Task For he elsewhere tells us that  "all sound  Love  and Admiration is ENTHU∣SIASM The Transports of Poets Ora∣tors Musicians Virtuosi the Spirit of Travellers and Adventurers Gallantry War Heroism all all Enthusiasm 'Tis enough I am content to be this new EN∣THUSIAST  Moralists  sub sin  "  And thus in another Place he describes the Effects of this high Passion That  "  Enthusiasm  is wonderfully powerful and extensiveFor when the Mind is  taken up in Vision  its Horror Delight Confusion Fear  Admiration  or  whatever Passion  belongs to it or is uppermost on this Occasion will have something  vast  immane  and as Painters say BEYOND LIFE And this is what gave Occasion to the Name of  Fanaticism  as it was used by the Ancients in its original Sense for  an  APPARITION  transporting the  MIND  Letter on Enthusiasm  "  SECTION IX  HAVING sufficiently evinced the  flimzy  though curious Contexture of these  Cobweb  Speculations  spun  in the  Closet  let us now venture abroad into the World let us pro∣ceed to something applicable to Life and Manners and consider what are the real Motives by which Mankind may be sway'd to the  uniform  Practice of  Virtue  AND first in Minds of a  gentle  and  gene∣rous  Disposition where the sensual Appetites are weak the Imagination refined and the benevolent Affections naturally predomi∣nant these very Affections and the  moral Sense  arising from them will in all the com∣mon Occurrences of Life secure the Prac∣tice of Virtue To these fine Tempers thus happily formed the inward Satisfaction of a virtuous Conduct exceeds that of every outward Acquisition and affords to its Pos∣sessor  a more true and lasting Happiness than Wealth or Fame or Power can be∣stow  SECONDLY Where the same Degrees of public Affection subsist but stand opposed by sensual or selfish Passions of equal Vio∣lence even here the Agent may rise to very high Degrees of Virtue but not without the Aids of  Discipline  and  Culture  Yet 'tis ob∣servable that the Virtues of such a Temper are rather  conspicuous  than  consistent  With∣out some strengthening Assistance the Pro∣gress of the Mind towards Perfection is of∣ten broke by the Sallies of disordered Passion  THERE is yet another Character essen∣tially different from these but seldom distin∣guished because generally taken for the  first  Many esteem themselves and are esteemed by others as having arrived at the most  consummate Virtue  whose Conduct never merits a higher Name than that of be∣ing  innoxious  This is generally the Case of those who love  Retreat  and  Contemplation  of those whose Passions are naturally  weak  or carefully  guarded  by what the World calls  Prudence  Now as in the last mentioned Character a  Curb  from  Irregularity  was re∣quisite so here a  Spur  to  Action  is equally  necessary for the Support and Security of Virtue  AS we descend through more common and inferior Characters the internal Motives to virtuous Action grow less and less ef∣fectual  Weak  or  no  Benevolence a moral Sense proportionably  dull  strong sensual  Ap∣petites  a clamorous Train of  selfish  Af∣fections these mixed and varied in endless Combinations form the real Character of the  Bulk  of Mankind Not only in  Cottages  but in  Cities Churches Camps  and  Courts  So that some stronger Ties some Motives more efficacious are necessary not only for the Perfection of  Virtue  but the Welfare nay the very Being of  Society  'TIS not denied nay 'tis meant and in∣sisted on that among all these various Cha∣racters and Tempers the Culture of the be∣nevolent Affections ought to be assiduously regarded For though we have seen that the Design of introducing an universal high  Relish  or  Taste  for Virtue be  visionary  and  vain  yet still a lower or a lower Degree may  possibly  be instilled We have only at∣tempted to prove that the Capacity for this high Taste in Morals is not universally or essentially interwoven with the human  Frame but dispensed in various Degrees in the same Manner as the Capacity for a Taste in  inferior  Beauties in  Architecture Paint∣ing Poetry  and  Music  TO remedy this  Defect  of  unerring  In∣stinct in Man by which he becomes a Crea∣ture so much less consistent than the Brute Kinds Providence hath afforded him not only a Sense of  present  but a Foresight of  future Good  and  Evil  HENCE the Force of human Laws which being established by common Con∣sent for the Good of all endeavour so far as their Power can reach by the Infliction of Punishment on Offenders to establish the general Happiness of Society by making the  acknowledged Interest  of every  Individual  to coincide and unite with the  public  Wel∣sare  BUT as human Laws cannot reach the  Heart  of Man as they can only inflict  Punishment  on Offenders but cannot bestow  Rewards  on the Obedient as there are many Duties of  imperfect  Obligation which they cannot recognize as  Force  will some∣times  defy  and  Cunning  often  elude  their Power so without some further Aids some Motives to Action more  universally  interest∣ing  Virtue must still be left betrayed and deserted  Now as it is clear from the Course of these Observations that nothing can work this great Effect but what can produce  "an entire and universal Coincidence be∣tween private and public Happiness"  so is it equally evident that nothing can ef∣fectually convince Mankind that their own Happiness universally depends on  procuring  or at least  not violating  the Happiness of others save only  "the lively and active Be∣lief of an allseeing and allpowerful GOD who will hereafter make them happy or miserable according as they designedly promote or violate the Happiness of their FellowCreatures"  And this is the  Es∣sence  of RELIGION  THIS at first View should seem a Mo∣tive or Principle of Action sufficient for all the Purposes of Happiness and Virtue In∣deed the Bulk of Mankind seem agreed in this Truth Yet refining Tempers who love to quit the common Tracks of Opi∣nion have been bold enough to call even this in Question Among these the noble Writer hath been one of the most diligent  It will therefore be necessary to consider the Weight of his Objections  TO prevent Misinterpretation it may be proper to observe that Lord SHAFTESBURY sometimes talks in earnest of the  Nobleness  and  Dignity  of  Religion  But when he ex∣plains himself it appears he confines his Idea of it to that Part which consists solely in Gratitude to and Adoration of the su∣preme Being without any Prospect of fu∣ture Happiness or Misery Now though indeed this be the noblest Part yet it is be∣yond the Reach of all save only those who are capable of the most  exalted  Degrees of Virtue His Theory of  Religion  therefore is precisely of a Piece with his Theory of the  moral Sense  not calculated for Use but Admiration and only existing in the Place where they had their Birth that is as the noble Writer well expresseth it in  a Mind taken up in Vision  HE sometimes talks or seems to talk in earnest too on the  Usefulness  of  Religion  in the common Acceptation of the Word With Regard to which 'tis only necessary to observe that whatever he hath said on this Subject I readily assent to But this is no Reason why it may not be necessary to ob∣viate  every thing he hath thrown out to the contrary to prejudice common Readers against Religion through the Vanity of be∣ing thought  Original  To  invent  what is  just  or  useful  is the Character of  Genius  'Tis  Folly  only and  Impertinence  to broach  Absurdities  FIRST therefore he often asserts that  "the Hope of future Reward and Fear of future Punishment is utterly unworthy of the free Spirit of a Man and only fit for those who are destitute of the very first Principles of common Honesty He calls it  miserable vile mercenary  And compares those who allow it any Weight to  Monkies  under the Discipline of the Whip  Wit and HumourEnquiryc  "  IN Answer to these general Cavils pro∣bably aimed principally at  Revelation  which are only difficult to confute as they are vague and fugitive let it be observed first that whatever can be objected against  religi∣ous  Fear holds good against the Fear of  hu∣man  Laws They  both  threaten the De∣linquent with the Infliction of Punishment nor is the Fear of the one more unworthy than of the other Yet the noble Writer  himself often speaks with the highest Re∣spect of  Legislators  of the Founders of  Society  and  Empire  who by the Establish∣ment of wise and wholesome Laws drew Mankind from their State of natural Bar∣barity to that of cultivated Life and social Happiness Unless indeed he supposes that ORPHEUS and the rest of them did their Business  literally  by  Taste  and a  Fiddle  If therefore the just Fear of  human  Power might be inforced without insulting or vio∣lating the  Generosity  of our Nature whence comes it that a just Fear of the  Creator  should so miserably degrade the Species The religious Principle holds forth the same Motive to Action and only differs from the other as the Evil it threatens is infinitely greater and more lasting  FURTHER If we consider the religious Principle in its true Light there is nothing in it either  mean slavish  or  unworthy  To be in a  Fright  indeed to live under the Sug∣gestions of  perpetual Terror  in which the noble Writer would persuade us the religi∣ous Principle consists is far from an amia∣ble Condition But this belongs only to the  Superstitious  or the  Guilty  The first of these are  salsely  religious and to the last I  imagine the noble Writer's most zealous Admirers will acknowledge it  ought  to be∣long But to the rest of Mankind the  re∣ligious  Principle or  Fear  of GOD is of a quite different Nature It only implies a lively and habitual Belief that we shall be here∣after miserable if we disobey his Laws Thus every wise Man nay every Man of common Understanding hath a  like Fear  of every  possible Evil  of the destructive Power of natural Agents of  Fire Water Serpents Poison  Yet none of these Fears more than the religious one imply a State of  perpetual  Misery and Apprehension None of them are inconsistent with the most generous Temper of Mind or truest Courage None of them imply more than a  rational Sense  of these several Kinds of Evil and from that Sense  a Determination to avoid them  Thus the noble Writer himself when it answers a different Purpose acknowledges that  "a Man of Courage may be  cautious  without real Fear  Inquiry  B ii Part ii §  "  Now the Word  Caution  in its very Nature implies a Sense of a Possi∣bility of Evil and from that Sense a Deter∣mination to avoid it Which is the very  Essence of the religious Principle or the  Fear  of GOD  AND as to the other Branch of religious Principle  "the Hope and Prospect of higher Degrees of future Happiness and Perfection"  What is there of  mean slavish  or  unworthy  in it Are all Mankind to be blown up into the  Mockmajesty  of the  kingly  STOIC seated on the Throne of  Ar∣rogance  and  lording  it in an  empty  Region of CHIMAERA's Is not the Prospect of Happiness the great universal Hinge of hu∣man Action Do not all the Powers of the Soul centre in this one Point Doth not the noble Writer himself elsewhere acknow∣ledge this  See above Sect VI of this Essay  And that our Obligations to Virtue itself can only arise from this one Principle that it gives us real Happiness Why then should the Hope of a happy Im∣mortality be branded as  base  and  slavish  while the Consciousness or Prospect of a happy Life on Earth is regarded as a just and honourable Motive  THE noble Writer indeed confesseth that  "if by the Hope of Reward be understood the Love and Desire he ought to have said the  Hope  of  virtuous Enjoyment  it  is not derogatory to Virtue"  But that in every other Sense the indulged Hope of Reward is not only mean and mercenary but even  hurtful  to Virtue and common  Hu∣manity  "For in this religious Sort of Dis∣cipline the Principle of  SelfLove  which is  naturally so prevailing  in us  indeed  being no way moderated or restrained but rather improved and made stronger every Day by the Exercise of the Pas∣sions in a Subject of more extended SelfInterest there may be reason to appre∣hend lest the Temper of this kind should extend itself in general through all the Parts of Life"  THIS to say the best of it is the very  Phrenzy  of Virtue Religion proposeth true Happiness as the End and Consequence of virtuous Action This is granted It proposeth it by such Motives as must in∣fluence SelfLove and consequently hath given the best Means of procuring it Yet it seems SelfLove being not restrained but made stronger will make Man kind miss of true Happiness That is by leading SelfLove into the Path of  true  Happiness Religion will inevitably conduct it to  false  by commanding us to  cherish  our  public  Af∣fections  it will certainly  inflame  the  private  ones by assuring us that if we would be happy hereafter we must be  virtuous  and  benevolent  it will beyond Question render us  vile  and  void  of  Benevolence  But this Mode of Reasoning is common with the noble Writer  HOWEVER at other Times his Lordship can descend to the Level of common Sense and prosecute his Argument by Proofs dia∣metrically opposite to what he here ad∣vanceth For in proving the Obligations of Man to Virtue after having modelled the inward State of the human Mind according to his own Imagination he proceeds to con∣sider the  Passions  which regard  ourselves  and draws another and indeed a stronger Proof from  these  He there proves  Inquiry  B ii Part ii §  the Folly of a vicious Love of Life  "because Life itself may often prove a Misfortune"  So of  Cowardice  "because it often robs us of the Means of Safety"  Excessive  Re∣sentment  "because the Gratification is no more than an Alleviation of a racking Pain"  The Vice of Luxury  "creates a Nauseating and Distaste Diseases and constant Craving"  He urges the same Ob∣jections  against intemperate Pleasure of the amourous kind He observes that Am∣bition is ever  "suspicious jealous captious and uncapable of bearing the least Dis∣appointment"  He then proceeds thro' a Variety of other Passions proving them all to be the Sources of some internal or ex∣ternal Misery Thus he awakens the same Passions of  Hope  and  Fear  which in a reli∣gious View he so bitterly inveighs against Thus he exhibits a Picture of future  Re∣wards  and  Punishments  even of the most  selfish  Kind He recommends the Confor∣mity to Virtue on the Score both of pre∣sent and future  Advantage  He  deters  his Reader from the Commission of Vice by representing the Misery it will produce And these too such  Advantages  and such  Miseries  as are entirely distinct from the mere Feeling of virtuous Affection or its contrary From the Considerations of Safe∣ty Alleviation of  bodily  Pain the Avoid∣ance of  Distaste  and  Diseases  Now doth not his own Cavil here recoil upon him  "That in this Sort of Discipline and by exhibiting such Motives as these the Prin∣ciple of SelfLove must be made stronger by the Exercise of the Passions in a Sub∣ject  of more extended SelfInterest And so there may be Reason to apprehend lest the Temper of this Kind should extend itself in general through all the Parts of Life"  Thus the Objection proves equally against both In Reality against neither For as we have seen the  Sense  or  Prospect  of Happiness is the only possible Motive to Action and if we are taught to believe that  virtuous Affection  will produce  Happiness  whether the expected Happiness lies in  this  Life or  another  it will  tend  and  equally  tend to produce  virtuous  Affection The noble Writer therefore and his Ad∣mirers might as well attempt to remove Mountains as to prove that the  Hope  and Prospect of a happy Immortality can justly be accounted more servile mercenary or  hurtful  than the View of those transient and earthly Advantages which his Lordship hath so rhetorically and honestly display'd for the Interest and Security of  Virtue  In Truth they are precisely of the same Na∣ture and only differ in Time Duration and Degree They are both established by our Creator for the same great End of Happi∣ness And what GOD hath thus  connected  it were  absurd  as well as  impious  to attempt to  separate  Hence we may see the Weakness and Mistake of those  fulsely religious  who fall into an  Extreme  directly  opposite  to this of the noble Writer who are  scandalized  at our being determined to the Pursuit of Virtue through any Degree of Regard to its happy Consequences in this Life which Regard they call  worldly carnal prophane  For it is evident that the religious Motive is precisely of the same Kind only  stronger  as the Happiness ex∣pected is  greater  and more  lasting  While therefore we set the  proper  and  proportioned  Value upon each it is impossible we can act irrationally or offend that GOD who established  both  This naturally leads to a further Observation which shews the Danger as well as Folly of  groveling  in  Systems  Virtue we see comes recommended and en∣forced on three Principles It is attended with  natural  and immediate  Pleasure  or AdvantageIt is com∣manded by human  Laws  It is enjoined by  Religion  Yet the  Religionists  have often decry'd the first of these Sanctions The  fanatical Moralists  the  last  And even the  second  hath not escaped the Madness of an  en∣thusiastic  Party which however never grew considera∣ble enough in this Kingdom to merit Consutation    THERE is yet another Circumstance ob∣servable in human Nature which still fur∣ther proves that the Hope of a happy Im∣mortality hath no Tendency to produce selfish Affection but its contrary For let the  stoical  Tribe draw what Pictures they please of the human Species this is an un∣doubted Truth  "that  Hope  is the most uni∣versal Source of human  Happiness  And  that Man is never so sincerely and heartily  benevolent  as when he is truly  happy  in himself"  Thus the high Consciousness of his being numbered among the Children of GOD and that his Lot is among the Saints that he is destined to an endless Pro∣gression of Happiness and to rise from high to higher Degrees of Perfection must needs inspire him with that Tranquillity and Joy which will naturally diffuse itself in Acts of sincere Benevolence to all his FellowCreatures whom he looks upon as his Com∣panions in this Race of Glory Thus will every noble Passion of the Soul be awakened into Action While the joyless Infidel possessed with the gloomy Dread of Anni∣hilation too naturally contracts his Af∣fections as his Hopes of Happiness decrease while he considers and despiseth himself as no more than the Beasts that perish  THE noble Writer indeed insinuates that there is  "a certain Narrowness of Spirit occasioned by this Regard to a future Life peculiarly observable in the  devout  Persons and  Zealots  of almost every reli∣gious Persuasion  Enquiry  B i Part iii §  "  In reply to which 'tis only necessary to affirm what may be  affirmed with Truth that with Regard to  devout  Persons the Insinuation is a  Falsehood  It was prudently done indeed to join the  Zealots  or  Bigots  in the same Sentence because it is true that  these  being under the Dominion of  Superstition  forget the true Nature and End of  Religion  and are there∣fore scrupulously exact in the Observation of outward  Ceremonies  while they neglect the superior and  essential  Matters of the Law of  Justice Benevolence  and  Mercy  AND as to the Notion of confining the Hope of future Reward to  "that of virtu∣ous Enjoyment only"  This is a  Refine∣ment  parallel to the rest of the noble Wri∣ter's System and like all Refinements contracts instead of enlarging our Views 'Tis allowed indeed that the Pleasures of Virtue are the highest we know of in our present State and 'tis therefore commonly supposed they may constitute our chief Fe∣licity in another But doth it hence follow that no other Sources of Happiness may be dispensed which as yet are utterly unknown to us Can our narrow and partial Imagi∣nations set Bounds to the Omnipotence of GOD And may not our Creator vouchsafe us such Springs of yet untasted Bliss as shall  exceed even the known Joys of Virtue as far as  these  exceed the Gratifications of Sense Nay if we consider what is gene∣rally believed that our Happiness will arise from an Addition of new and higher Facul∣ties that in the present Life the Exercise of Virtue itself ariseth often from the  Imper∣fection  of our State if we consider these Things it should seem highly probable that our future Happiness will consist in some∣thing quite beyond our present Compre∣hension Will be  "such as Eye hath not seen nor Ear heard neither hath it en∣tered into the Heart of Man to conceive"  SECTION X  BUT beyond these Objections the no∣ble Writer hath more than once touched upon another which merits a particular Consideration For he affirms that  "after all 'tis not merely what we call  Princi∣ple  but a  Taste  which governs Men"  That  "even Conscience such as is owing to religious Discipline will make but a slight Figure where this Taste is set amiss  Misc  iii c  "  THE Notion here advanced is not pecu∣liar to himself He seems to have drawn it from a much more considerable Writer who hath endeavoured to support the same Proposition by a great Variety of Examples  BAYLE  Pens sur une  Comete  Several Authors of inferior Rank have bor∣rowed the same Topic for popular Decla∣mation Nay one hath gone so far as to assert  "that Man is so unaccountable a Creature as to act most commonly against his Principle  Fable of the Bees  "  THE Objection indeed carries an Ap∣pearance of Force Yet on a near Exami∣nation it entirely vanisheth  IT must be owned that in most Coun∣tries a considerable Part of what is called  Religion  deserves no other Name than that of  Absurdity  made  sacred  And it were strange indeed should  Bigotry  and  false  Re∣ligion produce that Uprightness of Heart that Perfection of Morals which is the ge∣nuine Effect of  Truth  IT must be owned that with Regard to religious Principle as well as moral Prac∣tice every Man has the Power of being a  Hypocrite  That Knaves in order to be  accounted  honest  may appear  devout  And we may reasonably suppose if we consider the innumerable Artifices of Villainy that the outward Profession of Religion becomes a frequent  Disguise  to an  atheistical  and  cor∣rupted  Heart  BUT though these Circumstances may sufficiently account for the Appearance in many particular Cases yet with Regard to the  general  Fact  here  seems to lie the pro∣per Solution of the Difficulty  "That even where true Religion is known professed and in Speculation  assented  to it is seldom so thoroughly  inculcated  as to become a Principle of Action"  We have seen that Imagination is the universal Instrument of human Action that no Passion can be strongly excited in the Soul by mere Know∣ledge or Assent till the Imagination hath formed to itself some kind of Picture or Representation of the Good or Evil appre∣hended  See above Essay I §  Now the Senses and their attend∣ant Passions are continually urging their Demands through the immediate Presence of their respective Objects So that nothing but the  vivid Image  of some greater Good or Evil in Futurity can possibly resist and  overbalance their Sollicitations The  Idea  therefore of future Happiness and Misery must be strongly impressed on the Imagi∣nation ere they can work their full Effects because they are  distant  and  unseen  But this  Habit  of  Reflexion  is seldom properly fixed by  Education  and thus for want of a pro∣per Impression  "religious Principle is sel∣dom  gained  and therefore seldom ope∣rates"  BUT where a sincere and lively Impression takes Place where the Mind is convinced of the Being of a GOD that he  is  and is a  Rewarder  of them that diligently seek him where the  Imagination  hath gained a Habit of connecting this great Truth with every Thought Word and Action there it may be justly affirmed that Piety and Virtue can∣not but  prevail  To say in a Case of this Nature that Man will not act according to his Principle is to contradict the full Evi∣dence of known Facts We see how true Mankind commonly are to their Principle of  Pride  or mistaken Honour how true to their Principle of  Avarice  or mistaken Interest how true to their Principle of a Regard to  human  Laws Why are they so Because they have strongly and habi∣tually  connected these Principles in their Imagination with the Idea of their own Happiness Therefore whenever the reli∣gious Principle becomes in the same Man∣ner habitually connected in the Imagination with the Agent's Happiness that is when∣ever the religious Principle takes Place at all it must needs become infinitely more powerful than any other because the  Good  it promiseth and the  Evil  it threatens are infinitely greater and more lasting Hence it appears that the Corruption of Mankind even where the purest Religion is  professed  and in Theory  assented  to doth not arise from the  Weakness  of religious Principle but the  Want  of it  AND indeed on other Occasions and to serve different Purposes the noble Writer and his Partisans can allow and give Exam∣ples of all that is here contended for No∣thing is so common among these Gentle∣men as to declaim against the terrible Ef∣fects of  priestly Power  'Tis their favourite Topic to represent Mankind as groaning under the Tyranny of the  sacred Order  Now what does this Representation imply but  "the Force of religious Principle im∣properly directed"  If Mankind can be  swayed by religious Hope and Fear to re∣sign their Passions and Interests to the  Arti∣fice  or Advantage of the  Priest  why not to the  Benefit  of  Mankind  'Tis only impres∣sing a different Idea of  Duty  The Motive to Action is in both Cases the same and consequently must be of equal Efficacy Thus if religious Principle were void of  Force  the Priesthood must be void of  Power  The Influence therefore of the Priesthood however dishonestly applied is a Demonstration of the Force of  religious Principle  This therefore seems to be the Truth Although by timely and continued Cul∣ture the religious Principle might be made more universally predominant yet even as it is though not so thoroughly inculcated as to become generally a consistent Princi∣ple of Action in Fact it hath a frequent and  considerable  though  partial  and imper∣fect Influence None but the thoroughly Good and Bad act on continued or con∣sistent Principles all the intermediate De∣grees of Good and Bad act at different Times on various and inconsistent Princi∣ples that is their  Imaginations  are by turns given up to  Impressions  of a  different  or  even  contrary  Nature This explains the whole Mystery For hence it appears that the consistent or inconsistent Conduct of Men depends not on the Nature of their Principles but on having their Principles whatever they are  counteracted  by opposite ones Although therefore through a Fai∣lure of timely Discipline Numbers of Men appear to be of that capricious Temper as not to be steddy to any Principle yet still the religious one will  mix  with the rest and naturally  prevail  in its  Turn  This is cer∣tainly a common Circumstance among the  looser  and more  inconsiderate  Ranks of Men who although by no Means uniformly swayed by the Precepts of Religion are yet frequently struck with Horror at the Thought of Actions  peculiarly  vile and deterred by the Apprehension of an allseeing GOD from the Commission of Crimes  uncommonly atrocious  HERE then lies the essential Difference between the Efficacy of  Taste  and  religious  Principle That the first being a Feeling or Perception dispensed in various Degrees and in very weak ones to the Bulk of Man∣kind is incapable even through the most assiduous Culture of becoming an universal  or consistent Motive to Virtue But the re∣ligious Principle arising from such Passions as are common to the whole Species must if properly inculcated  universally  prevail  'Tis evident therefore that in the very first Dawns of Reason religious Principles ought to be impressed on the Minds of Chil∣dren and this early Culture continued through the succeeding Stages of Life But as the noble Writer hath strangely at∣tempted to ridicule and dishonour Religion in every Shape so here he hath endea∣voured to throw an Odium on this Method of religious Discipline by representing it as the Enemy to true Morals and practical Phi∣losophy as it fetters the Mind with early Prejudices  "Whatever Manner in Phi∣losophy happens to bear the least Resem∣blance to that of  Catechism  cannot I am persuaded of itself seem very inviting Such a smart Way of questioning our∣selves in our Youth has made our Man∣hood more averse to the  expostulatory  Dis∣cipline And though the metaphysical Points of our Belief are by this Method with admirable Care and Caution instilled into tender Minds yet the Manner of this  anticipating  Philosophy may make  the Afterwork of Reason and the in∣ward Exercise of the Mind at a riper Age proceed the more heavily and with greater Reluctance'Tis hard after having by so many pertinent Interroga∣tories and decisive Sentences declared  who  and  what  we are to come leisurely in another to enquire concerning our  real Self  and  End  the Judgment we are to make of  Interest  and the Opinion we should have of  Advantage  and  Good  Which is what must necessarily determine us in our  Conduct  and prove the leading Principle of our Lives  Advice c  Part iii §  "  IN reply to this  most philosophical  Para∣graph let it be observed that it is not the Design of Religion to make  Sophists  but  good Subjects  of Mankind That Man be∣ing designed not for  Speculation  but  Action  religious Principle is not to be instilled in a  philosophical  but a  moral  View Therefore with Regard to  Practice  nothing can be more fit and rational than to impress ac∣knowledged  Truths  at an Age when the  Re∣cipient  is incapable of their  Demonstrations  in the same Manner as we teach the  Me∣chanic  to  work  on  Geometric  Principles while the Proofs are  unknown  to him  BUT then the  Prejudices of Education  yes these are the great  Stumblingblock  to a modern  Freethinker  It still runs in his Head that all Mankind are born to dispute  de omni scibili  On all Subjects  Let therefore this  mi∣nute  Philosopher reflect first that a  Preju∣dice  doth not imply as is generally sup∣posed the  Falsehood  of the Opinion instilled but only that it is taken up and held with∣out its proper  Evidence  Thus a Child may be prejudiced in Favour of Truth as well as Falsehood and in him neither the one nor the other can properly be called more than an  Opinion  Further The human Mind cannot remain in a State of  Indifference  with regard either to  Opinion  or  Practice  'Tis of an  active  Nature and like a  fertile  Field if by due Cultivation it be not made to produce good  Fruit  will certainly spring up in  Tares  and  Thislles  Impressions Opi∣nions  Prejudices  of one kind or other a Child will inevitably contract from the Things and Persons that  surround  him And if rational Habits and Opinions be not infused in order to  anticipate  Absurdities  Absurdities will rise and  anticipate  all ra∣tional Habits and Opinions His  Reason  and his  Passions  will put themselves in  Action  however untoward and inconsistent in the same Manner as his  Limbs  will make an Effort towards progressive  Motion  how∣ever awkward and absurd The same Ob∣jection therefore that lies against instilling a  salutary Opinion  will arise against  teaching  him to walk  erect  For this too is a kind of  "  anticipating  Philosophy"  And sure a Child left to his own  SelfDiscipline  "till he could come  leisurely  to enquire con∣cerning his  real Self  and  End  "  would stand as fair a Chance to  grovel  in Absurdity and bring  down  his Reason to the sordid  Level  of Appetite as to  crawl  upon all  four  and dabble in the  Dirt  Thus the noble Writer's Ridicule would sweep away the whole System of Education along with the religious Principle Not an Opinion or In∣clination must be controuled or so much as controverted  "lest by this  anticipating  Philosophy the Work of Reason and the inward Exercise of the Mind at a  riper  Age should proceed the more heavily and with greater Reluctance"  The Ca∣price of Insancy must rule us till the very  Capacity  of Improvement should be  de∣stroyed  and we must turn  Savages  in order to be made perfect in the  sovereign Philo∣sophy  'TIS no difficult Matter therefore to de∣termine whether a Child should be left to the Follies of his own  weak  Understanding and  nascent  Passions be left to imbibe the Maxims of corrupt Times and Manners Maxims which setting aside all Regard to their speculative Truth or Falsehood do lead to certain Misery or on the other hand shall be happily conducted to embrace those religious Principles which have had the Approbation of the best and wisest Men in every Age and Nation and which are known and allowed to be the only Means of true Happiness to Individuals Families and States  THIS therefore ought to be the early and principal Care of those who have the Tui∣tion of Youth And they will soon find the happy Effects of their Instruction For as the Child's Understanding shall improve what was at first instilled only as an  Opinion  will by Degrees be embraced as  Truth  Reason will then assume her just Empire and the great universal religious Principle  a rational Obedience to the Will of GOD will raise him to his utmost Capacity of moral Perfection will be a wide and firm Foundation on which the whole Fabric of Virtue may rise in its just Proportions will  extend  and  govern  his  Benevolence  and  moral Sense  will strengthen them if weak will confirm them if strong will supply their Want if naturally defective In fine will direct all his  Passions  to their proper  Objects  and  Degrees  and as the great  Masterspring  of Action at once  promote  and  regulate  every Movement of his  Heart  IT must be owned the noble Writer's Caution against this  "anticipating Philo∣sophy"  hath of late been deeply imbibed In Consequence of it we have seen  religious Principle  declaimed against ridiculed la∣mented The Effect of this hath been an abandoned Degree of Villainy in one Class of Mankind a lethargic Indifference to∣wards Virtue or Vice in another and in the third which boast the Height of mo∣dern Virtue we seldom see more than the first natural Efforts the mere  Buddings  of Benevolence and Honour which are too generally blasted ere they can ripen in∣to  Action  This Contempt of Religion  hath always been a fatal  Omen  to  free  States Nor if we may credit Experience can we entertain any just Hope that this fantastic Scheme this boasted  Relish  for Beauty and Virtue can ever give Security to Empire without the more solid Supports of religious Belief For it is remarkable that in the Decline of both the  Greek  and  Roman  States after Religion had lost its Credit and Ef∣ficacy this very  Taste  this  sovereign Philo∣phy  usurped its Place and became the com∣mon Study and Amusement as it is now among ourselves both of the  Vile  and  Vul∣gar  The Fact with Regard to  Greece  is sufficiently notorious with Regard to  Rome  it may seem to demand a Proof And who would think that QUINTILIAN in the fol∣lowing Passage was not describing our own Age and Nation  "Nunc autem quae vel∣ut propria philosophiae asseruntur passim tractamus  omnes  Quis enim modo de JUSTO AEQUO AC BONO non et VIR PESSIMUS loquitur  Quint Proaemium  "  What was for∣merly the Philosopher's Province only is now invaded by all We find every wicked and worthless Fellow in these Days haranguing on  VIRTUE BEAUTY  and  GOOD"  What  this  Leprosy  of  false  Knowledge may end in I am unwilling to say But this may be said with Truth because it is justified by Expe∣rience that along with the Circumstance now remarked every other  Symptom  is rising among us that hath generally attended the dark and troubled  Evening  of a  Common∣wealth  DOUBTLESS many will treat these Ap∣prehensions with  Derision  But this  De∣rision  is far from being an Evidence of their Falsehood For no People ever fell a Sa∣crifice to themselves till  lulled  and infatuated by their own Passions  Blind Security  is an essential Characteristic of a People devoted to Destruction The Fact is equally un∣deniable whether it ariseth from the moral Appointment of Providence or the Con∣nexion of natural Causes Though this is seen and acknowledged by those who are conversant with the History of Mankind yet 'tis hard to convey this Evidence to those who seldom extend their Views beyond their own short Period of Existence because they see the Prevalence of the  Cause  assigned while yet the pretended  Consequence  appears not But they who look back into ancient Time are convinced that the  public  Effects  of  Irreligion  have never been sudden or  im∣mediate  One Age is  falsely  polite  irreli∣gious  and  vile  the next is sunk in  Servi∣tude  and  Wretchedness  This is analogous to the Operation of other Causes A Man may be intemperate for twenty Years be∣fore he feels the Effects of Intemperance on his Constitution The Sun and Moon raise the Tides yet the Tides rise not to their Height till a considerable Time after the Conjunction of these two Luminaries We cannot therefore justly decide concerning the future  Effects  of Irreligion from its pre∣sent State The  Examples  of former Times are a much better  Criterion  And these are such as ought to make every Man among us that regards Posterity tremble for his Posterity while he reads them  FOR this is but too just an  Epitome  of the Story of Mankind That TYRANNY and SUPERSTITION have ever gone Hand in Hand mutually supporting and supported taking their Progress and fixing their Do∣minion over all the Kingdoms of the Earth overwhelming it in one general Deluge as the Waters cover the Sea Here and there a happy Nation  emerges  breathes for a while in the enlightened Region of KNOW∣LEDGE  RELIGION VIRTUE FREEDOM Till in their appointed Time IRRELIGION and LICENTIOUSNESS appear  mine  the Foundations of the  Fabric  and sink it in the general Abyss of IGNORANCE and OP∣PRESSION  POSSIBLY the fatal Blow may yet be averted from us 'Tis surely the Duty of every Man in every Station to contribute his Share however  inconsiderable  to this great End This must be my Apology for opposing the noble Writer's fantastic Sy∣stem which by exhibiting a false Picture of human Nature is in Reality an  Inlet  to  Vice  while it seems most  favourable  to  Vir∣tue  And while it pretends to be drawn from the  Depths  of  Philosophy  is of all others  most unphilosophical  ESSAYS ON THE Characteristics etc  ESSAY III On revealed RELIGION and CHRISTIANITY  SECTION I  IN the Course of the preceding  Essay  we have seen the noble Writer assum∣ing the Character of the professed  Dog∣matist  the  Reasoner  in  Form  In what re∣mains to be considered concerning  revealed Religion  and CHRISTIANITY we shall find him chiefly affecting the  miscellaneous  Capa∣city  the Way of  Chat Raillery Innuendo  or  Storytelling  In a Word that very Species of the present modish Composition which he so contemptuously ridicules  "where as he tells us Justness and Accuracy of Thought are set aside as too constraining where Grounds and Foundations are of no Moment and which hath properly neither  Top  nor  Bottom Beginning  nor  End  See above  Essay  i §  "  In this however his Lordship is not quite so much to blame as might be imagined In his Critical Progress he had treated this  dishabille  of Composition as the Man in the Fable did his Pears uncon∣scious he should be ever afterwards reduced to diet on them himself The Truth of the Matter is that the broken Hints the ambiguous Expression and the Ludicroserious of the gentle Essayist perfectly secure him from the rough Handling of the LogicalDisputer  INDEED the noble Author has a double Advantage from this  Cloud  in which the  Graces  so frequently secure their Favourite He not only eludes the Force of every Ar∣gument the Defenders of Christianity alledge in it's Support but even pleads the Privilege of  being ranked in the Number of  sincere  Chris∣tians He takes frequent Occasions of express∣ing his Abhorrence of  idle Scepticks  and  wicked Unbelievers  in Religion He declares himself of a more resigned Understanding a ductile Faith ready to be moulded into any Shape that his spiritual Superiors shall prescribe At other Times and in innu∣merable Places he scatters such Insinuations against  Christianity  and that too with all the Bitterness of  Sarcasm  and  Invective  as must needs be more effectual in promoting  Irreli∣gion  than a formal and avowed Accusation For in the Way of open War there is fair Warning given to put Reason upon Guard that no pretending Argument be suffered to pass without Examination On the con∣trary the noble Writer's concealed Method of  Raillery  steals insensibly on his Reader fills him with endless Prejudice and Suspi∣cion and without passing thro' the  Judg∣ment  sixeth such Impressions on the Imagi∣nation as  Reason  with all its Effects will be hardly able afterwards to efface  THESE inconsistent Circumstances in his Lordship's Conduct have made it a Ques∣tion among some what his real Sentiments were concerning Religion and  Christianity  If it be necessary to decide this Question we may observe that a disguised Unbe∣liever may have his Reasons for making a formal Declaration of his Assent to the Re∣ligion of his Country But it will be hard to find what should tempt a real  Christian  to load  Christianity  with Scorn and  Infamy  Indeed the noble Writer to do him Justice never designed to leave us at a Loss on this Subject For he hath been so good fre∣quently to remind his Reader to  look out  for the true Drift of his  Irony  lest his real Meaning should be mistaken or disregarded  HERE then lies the Force of his Lordship's Attack on  Christianity  "In exciting Con∣tempt by Ridicule"  A Method which as we have already seen  Essay  i passim  tho' devoid of all ra∣tional Foundation is yet most powerful and efficacious in working upon vulgar Minds Thus the Way of  Irony  and false Enco∣mium which he so often employs against the blessed Founder of our Religion serves him for all Weapons the deeper he strikes the Wound the better he shields himself  WE are not therefore to be surprized if we find the noble Writer frequently affect∣ing a Mixture of  solemn Phrase  and  low  Buffoonry  not only in the same  Tract  but in the same  Paragraph  In this Respect he resembles the facetious Drole I have somewhere heard of who wore a  transpa∣rent Masque  Which at a Distance exhi∣bited a Countenance wrap'd up in profound Solemnity but those who came nearer and could see to the Bottom found the native Look distorted into all the ridiculous Grimace which Spleen and Vanity could imprint  SECTION II  BUT as  natural  Religion is the only Foundation of  revealed  it will be necessary e'er we proceed to the last to obviate any Insinuations which the noble Writer may have thrown out against the Former  AS to the Expectation of future Happiness considered as the natural Consequence of virtuous Action his Lordship hath not that I know of either assirmed or insinuated any thing against it's Reasonableness But with Regard to the other Branch of Reli∣gion  "the Belief of a future State of Misery or Punishment considered as the ap∣pointed Consequence of Vice"  this he  hath frequently endeavoured to discredit in such a Manner as would be no small De∣gree of Guilt to transcribe were it not to shew at once the Impiety and Falsehood of his Affirmations  IN his Letter on  Enthusiasm  he hath ob∣liged us with several Passages of this Kind These it must be owned are so obscure that we must be content to refer them rather to the Reader's equitable Construction than urge them as direct Proofs  THE Apprehension and  Fear  of some∣thing  supernatural  so universal among Man∣kind he seems all along to deride as a visionary and  groundless Pannic  Let on Enthus  passim  He adds that  "while some Sects such as the  Py∣thagorean  and latter  Platonick  joined in with the Superstition and Ethusiasm of the Times the  Epicurean  the  Academic  and others were allowed to use all the Force of Wit and Raillery against it  Ib  "  To convince us how much he approves the Conduct of these libertine Sects he boldly follows their Example He assures us that  "such is the Nature of the liberal po∣lished and refin'd Part of Mankind so far are they from the mere Simplicity of  Babes and Sucklings that instead of applying the Notion of a future Reward or Punishment to their immediate Be∣haviour in Society they are apt much rather thro' the whole Course of their Lives to shew evidently that they look on the pious Narrations to be indeed no better than Children's Tales and the Amusement of the mere Vulgar  Misc  iii c  "  He confirms these Opinions by assigning the Reason why Men of Sense should stand clear of the Fears of a Futurity  "GOD is so  good  as to exceed the very best of us in  Goodness  And after this Manner we can have no Dread or Suspicion  to render us uneasy  for it is  Malice only  and  not Goodness  which can make us afraid  Let on Enthus  "  IS this the  Philosopher  and  Patriot  the Lover of his Country and Mankind  This  the Admirer of ancient Wisdom of venera∣ble Sages who founded  "Laws Constitu∣tions civil and religious Rites whatever civilizes or polishes Mankind  Moralists  P i §  "  Tu Pater et Rerum inventor Tu patria nobis  Suppeditas praecepta  THIS sure is unhinging Society to the  utmost of his Power For the Force of  re∣ligious Sanctions  depends as much on their being believed as the Force of  human Laws  depends on their being executed To  de∣stroy  the  Belief  of the  one  therefore is equi∣valent to suspending the  other  BUT as the present Debate concerns not the  Utility  but the  Truth  of  Religion  'tis chiefly incumbent on us to shew that the noble Writer's  Opinion  and  Reasoning  on this Subject are void of all Foundation  'TIS observable therefore First that his Lordship in other Places allows that  "If there be naturally such a Passion as Enthu∣siasm 'tis evident that Religion itself is of the Kind and must be therefore natural to Man  Misc  ii c  "  And in his  Letter on Enthusiasm  even while he derides the Proneness of Mankind to the  conscientious Fear  he adds  "that tho' Epicurus thought these Appre∣hensions were  vain  yet he was forced to allow them in a Manner  innate  ""From which Concession a  Divine  me∣thinks might raise a  goood Argument  against him for the  Truth  as well as  Usefulness  of Religion"  Now as some may possibly be at a Loss to determine here  whether the noble Writer be in  Jest  or  Earnest  the Argument he hints at is plainly this That if we look round the Works of Nature we shall find an Analogy establish∣ed which seems a Proof that this natural Fear which  presseth  so universally on the human Mind hath a real and proportioned Object The Argument hath been urged by many of great Name in Favour of the  Hope  of future  Good  and 'tis surely of equal Force whatever that Force may be when apply'd to the  Fear  of future  Ill  For we see thro' the whole Creation every Animal of whatever Species directed by it's Nature or the Hand of Providence to fear and shun it's proper and appointed Enemy We find these Apprehensions universally suited to the Nature and Preservation of every Species among Birds Beasts Fishes Insects Nor is there one  Fear  tho' some∣times  excessive  in it's  Degree  that is  erroneous  with Regard to it's  Object  The  religious Fear  therefore which  forceth itself  so uni∣versally on the human Mind in every Age and Nation ignorant or knowing civilized or barbarous hath  probably  an Object suited to it's Nature ordained for the Welfare of the human Species At least this Argu∣ment  must ever be of Weight with those who draw their Ideas of future Existence from the  Instincts Hopes  and  Expectations  of the human Mind  INDEED on the noble Writer's refined Scheme of Morals in which the natural Affections of the Mind are represented as allsufficient for the Purposes of human Happiness this Argument must lose it's Force because on this Supposition the re∣ligious Fear is  supernumerary  and  useless  But then this shews the Supposition itself to be  monstrous absurd  and contrary to the established Course of Nature because Na∣ture gives no Power or Passion but to some proper and appointed End The very  Ex∣istence  of the Passion therefore is a Proof of it's Necessity  NOW if indeed the religious Fear be  necessary  as we presume hath been suffi∣ciently proved in the preceding Essay then from hence will arise a strong and convincing Proof that the Object of reli∣gious Fear is  real  For we find thro' the whole Extent of created Being that the Author of Nature hath annexed to all his Designs and Purposes the proper Means or Objects by which they may be fulfilled  As therefore the religious Fear is not only interwoven with the Frame of Man but  absolutely necessary  to his  Happiness  it's Ob∣ject must be  real  because if  not  you sup∣pose the Creator to have given a NECESSA∣RY  Passion  without it's  proper  and  appointed Object  which would be a Contradiction to the  universal  and  known Constitution  of Things  ON this Occasion we may observe the Weakness of the  Epicurean  System concern∣ing  Providence  For that Sect hath ever deny'd that the Deity concerns himself with the  moral  Conduct of Man But from the wise and benevolent Constitution of the natural World itself a strong Proof ariseth in Support of GOD's  moral  Government of it and of the Truth of the  Fears  and  Ex∣pectations  of the human Mind For if we allow that he regards and preserves the natural Order and Symmetry of the Crea∣tion that he hath formed this immense System of Being and secured it's Continu∣ance and Welfare by certain Laws neces∣sary to the Happiness of his Creatures then we must on the same Foundation conclude that he hath likewise established such  Mo∣tives  and  Laws  of  Action  as may determine  Man  to prosecute the same End It were an Imputation on the Wisdom of the Deity to conceive him as  doing  the  one  and  omit∣ting  the  other  Unless  Mind  and  Morals  be less worthy of his Regard than  Matter  and  Motion  BUT still the noble Writer proceeds in the Spirit of Derision to expose the Ab∣surdities and Mischiefs this misguided reli∣gious Principle hath occasioned he often expatiates on the  superstitious Horrors  and  surious Zeal  which have had their Source in this  Principle  and thence in the Way of Insinuation concludes it  irrational  and  groundless  THE Facts it must be owned are no∣torious and undeniable But the Conse∣quence is no less evidently chimerical and vain Lord SHAFTESBURY himself hath observed that in Failure of a  just Prince  or  Magistrate  Mankind are ready to sub∣mit themselves even to a  Tyrant  "Like newborn Creatures who have never seen their  Dam  they will fancy one for themselves and apply as by Nature prompted to some like Form for Favour and Protection In the Room of a  true FosterFather  and  Chief  they will take  after a  false one  and in the Room of a legal Government and just Prince obey even a Tyrant  Wit and H  P iii §  "  And hence he draws a strong Proof of the Force of the  social  or  herding  Principle even from  despotic  Power itself Again he hath remarked that  "  Heroism  and  Philanthropy  are almost one and the same yet by a small Misguidance of the Affection a Lover of Mankind becomes a Ravager a Hero and Deli∣verer becomes an Oppressor and Destroy∣er  Ib §    "  'Tis the same in Religion Where the human Mind ever restless in it's Search for the great Center of created Being on which alone it can perfectly repose itself seeks but cannot find the  true  GOD it naturally sets up a  false one  in his Place Here too Mankind  "like newborn Creatures who have never seen their  Dam  will fancy one for themselves and apply as by Nature prompted to some like Form for Favour and Protection In the Room of a  true FosterFather  they will take after  a false one  and in the Room of an  allperfect  GOD worship even an  Idol  "  The religious Principle thus misguided breaks forth indeed into Enor∣mities  the most pernicious and destructive Hence indeed  "by a small Misguidance of the Affection a  Lover of Mankind  be∣comes a  Ravager  a  Saint  an  Oppressor  and  Destroyer  "  But as from the Abuse of the  social  Principle so here in that of the  religious  one no other Consequence can be justly drawn but that it is  natural  and  strong  BUT further the noble Writer finds the Notion of future Punishment  inconsistent  with his Idea of  divine Goodness  Therefore says he  "We can have no Dread or Sus∣picion to make us uneasy For it is  Malice only  and not  Goodness  which can make us afraid  Enq  B ii Part ii §  "  YET on another Occasion his Lordship can affirm and justly that  "a Man of  Tem∣per  may resist or  punish without Anger  "  And if so why may not divine  Goodness  make us  afraid  For as divine Goodness regards the greatest Happiness of all it's Creatures so if Punishment be  necessary  to that End divine  Goodness  will  therefore  ORDAIN PUNISHMENT To this Purpose a Writer of distinguished Rank and Pene∣tration  "In Reality Goodness is the natu∣ral  and just Object of Fear to an ill Man Malice may be appeased or satiated Humour may change But Goodness is as a fixed steady immoveable Principle of Action If either of the Former holds the Sword of Justice there is plainly Ground for the greatest of Crimes to hope for Impunity But if it be Goodness there can be no possible Hope whilst the Reasons of things or the Ends of Government call for Punishment Thus every one sees how much greater Chance of Impunity an ill Man has in a partial Administration than in a just and up∣right one It is said that the Interest or Good of the Whole must be the Interest of the universal Being and that he can have no other Be it so This Author Ld  S  has proved that Vice is naturally the Misery of Mankind in this World Consequently it was for the Good of the Whole that it should be so What Shadow of Reason then is there to assert that this may not be the Case hereafter Danger of future Punishment and if there be Danger there is Ground of Fear no more supposes Malice than the pre∣sent Feeling of Punishment does  Dr  Butler's  Sermons Preface p  "  THUS the noble Writer's Derision and Argumentation are equally chimerical and impious as it appears that the natural Fears and Expectations of the human Mind are at least founded in Probability  SECTION III  HIS Lordship's Opinions being so little favourable to  natural Religion  we cannot wonder if we find him on every possible Occasion throwing out Insinuations and virulent Remarks in Order to disgrace  re∣vealed  The First that will deserve our Notice are such as tend to invalidate the  Credibility  of  Scripture History  HE tells us  "He who says he believes  for certain  or is  assured  of what he be∣lieves either speaks  ridiculously  or says in Effect he believes strongly but  is not  sure So that whoever is not conscious of Reve∣lation nor has certain Knowledge of any Miracle or Sign can be no more than  scep∣tick in the Case  And the best Christian in the World who being destitute of the Means of Certainty depends only on History and Tradition for his Belief of these particu∣lars is at best but a  sceptick  Christian  Misc  ii c  "  NOW it should seem that the Dexterity of this Passage lies in a new Application of two or three Words For by  "  certain  and  assured  "  he means  more  by  "  Scepticism  "  he means much  less  than it is ever used to signify And thus as in Dr  Mandeville's  Philosophy already  See above  Essay  ii  criticized wherever we have not  Demonstration  'tis plain we must needs be  Sceptics  BUT if indeed we must be  Sceptics  in  revealed Religion  on this Account the same Consequence will follow with Regard to every other Kind of Knowledge that de∣pends on  human Testimony  We must be  Scep∣tics  too in our Belief of every  past  Trans∣action nay of every thing transacted in our own Times except only of what falls with∣in the narrow Circle of our proper  Obser∣vation  The Manners of  Men  the Site of  Countries  the Varieties of  Nature  the Truths of Philosophy the very Food we eat and Liquids we drink are all received on the sole Evidence of human Testimony But what Name would he merit among Men who in these Instances should say  "he does not believe for certain or is not assured of what he believes"  till in every Case he  should be impelled by the Force of  Demon∣stration  or the Evidence of  Sense  AND indeed on other Occasions where  Christianity  is not concerned the noble Writer can speak in a very different and much juster Manner For thus he appeals to Nature in  Proof  of the Wisdom and Goodness of the Creator  "Thus too in the System of the  bigger  World  See there  the mutual Dependency of things The Relation of one to another of the Sun to this inhabited Earth and of the  Earth  and  other Planets  to the  Sun  The  Order Union  and  Coherence  of the  whole  And know my ingenious Friend that by this  Survey  you will be obliged to own the  universal System  and  coherent Scheme  of things to be  established on  ABUNDANT PROOF capable of  convincing  any fair and just Contemplator of the Works of Nature  Moralists  P ii §  "  His Lordship's Argument is surely just Yet is there one to be found among five Hundred of those who are thus  convinced  of the wise Structure of the Uni∣verse who have ever taken a  Survey  of this immense System except only in the  Books  and  Diagrams  of  experienced Philosophers  How few are capable even of comprehend∣ing the  Demonstrations  on which the Truth of the  Copernican  System is established or receiving on any other Proof than that of  human Testimony  "the Relation of the  Earth  and  other Planets  to the  Sun  the  Order Union  and  Coherence  of the  whole  "  It cannot be supposed that even the noble writer himself ever went thro' the tedious Process of  Experiment  and  Calculation  which alone can give absolute  Certainty  in this ex∣tensive Subject Yet we find he is not in any Degree  "sceptical in the Case"  but very rationally determines that the Wisdom of the Deity in  "this universal System is  established  on  abundant Proof  capable of  convincing  any  fair  and  just  Contem∣plator of the Works of Nature"  IT appears then that a Confidence in the Veracity of others is not peculiar to the Belief of  revealed Religion  The same takes Place in almost every Subject More par∣ticularly we see that in the  History of Na∣ture  as in that of  Revelation  the Evidence of human  Testimony  is the only Sort of Proof that can be given to Mankind And whoever allows this Proof as being  "  abun∣dant  and  convincing  "  in the  one  and dis∣allows  or despiseth it in the  other  how self satisfied soever he may be in his own  Imagi∣nation  is neither a  fair  nor a  just  Contem∣plator of the Works and the Ways of  Pro∣vidence  IF therefore any Objection lies against the Credibility of the  Scripture History  it must consist in maintaining not  "that human Testimony is insufficient to sup∣port it"  but  "that in Fact it is not suffi∣ciently supported by the Evidence of human Testimony"  If so this Defect must arise either from a Want of  External Evidence  Or Secondly because the Facts Doctrines and Composition of the Bible are such that no Testimony whatever can con∣vince us that it is a  divine Revelation  WITH Regard to the first of these  "the Testimony on which the Authenticity of the Gospel History is founded"  This the noble Writer hath attacked by a long Chain of Insinuations in his last  Miscellany  Misc  v c  Where in the Way of  Dialogue  he hath indeed amply repaid the Treatment which in the preceding Chapter he charges upon the  Clergy  For here he hath introduced two of that  Order  who to use his own Ex∣pression  "are indeed his very legitimate and obsequious  Puppets  who cooperate in the most officious Manner with the Author towards the Display of his own proper Wit and the Establishment of his private Opinion and Maxims  Ib c  " "Where after the poor Phantom or Shadow of an Adversary has said as little for his Cause as can be imagined and given as many Opens and Advantages as could be de∣sired he lies down for good and all and passively submits to the killing Strokes of his unmerciful Conqueror  Ib  "  TO these Gentlemen the noble Writer assigns the  herculean  Labour of proving the Necessity of an absolute  Uniformity  in Opi∣nion  A hopeful Project indeed  as his Lordship calls it elsewhere No Wonder he comes off  Conqueror  in such a Debate But here lies the Peculiarity of his Conduct That while he pretends only to prove that the Scripture cannot be a Foundation for Uniformity of Opinion  in all things  he hath thrown out such Insinuations as evi∣dently imply that there can be no Founda∣tion for believing the Truth of  any thing  the Gospel History contains He says he  began by desiring them  "to explain the Word  Scripture  and by enquiring into the Original of this Collection of antient∣er and later Tracts which in general they comprehended under that Title whether it were the  apocryphal  Scripture or the more  canonical  the  full  or  halfauthorized  the  doubtful  or the  certain  the  controverted  or  uncontroverted  the  singly  read or that of  various  Reading the Texts of  these  Manuscripts or of  those  the Transcripts Copies Titles Catalogues of  this  Church and Nation or of  that other  of this Sect and Party or of another of those in one Age called Orthodox and in Possession of Power or of those who in another overthrew their Predecessor's Authority and in their Turn also assumed the Guardianship and Power of holy things For how these sacred Records were guarded in those Ages might easily he said be  imagined  by any one who had the least insight into the History of those Times which we called  Primitive  and those Charac∣ters of Men whom we styled Fathers of the Church  Misc  v c  "  HERE as his Lordship drags us into the  beaten Track  of  Controversy  the best Com∣pliment that can be paid the Reader is to carry him thro' it by the shortest Way The stale Objections here raked together by the noble Author have been so often and so fully refuted by a Variety of excellent Writers that to many it may seem a needless Task even to touch upon the Subject  Du Pin Le Clerc Tillemont Whitby Lardner Phil Lipsiensis  c and very lately Mr  Jortin  in his learned Remarks on  Ecclesiastical History    HOWEVER for the Satisfaction of those who may think it necessary a summary View of the Evidence is here subjoined  THE Authenticity therefore of the Books of the  new Testament  appears to be founded on the strongest moral Evidence because from the earliest Ages we find them ascribed to the Apostles and Evangelists whose Names they bear Thus St PAUL's Epistles are mentioned by St PETER and cited by CLEMENS ROMANUS who lived in the Reign of CLAUDIUS even before St PAUL was carried Prisoner to ROME PO∣LYCARP and IRENAEUS were for some Time contemporary with St JOHN They both cite  the four Gospels and affirm they were all wrote by the Apostles and Evangelists whose Names they bear JUSTIN MARTYR and CLEMENS ALEXANDRINUS confirm their Accounts in the following Century And the great ORIGEN with whom I shall close the Catalogue and who lived in the Reign of SEVERUS in his Book against CELSUS hath cited  all  the  Gospels  and  most  if not  all  the  Epistles  under the Names they now bear And the Words of the several Citations per∣fectly agree with those of the new Testament now in Use Such a full Proof of the Genuineness of these sacred Records as is not to be parallel'd concerning any other Book of  equal  or even of much  less Anti∣quity  The  internal  Proof of their Genuineness arising from their  Style  and  Composition  is no less eminent and particular The Genius of every Book is so perfectly agreeable to the Character and Education of it's respec∣tive Author every Custom described or alluded to either  Jewish Greek  or  Roman  so entirely suited to the  Times  every Inci∣dent so  natural  so  occasional  so  particular  so perfectly  identify'd  that it were the very  extreme of Ignorance and Folly to raise a Doubt on this Subject  THAT the GospelHistory hath been trans∣mitted to us  pure  and  uncorrupted  we have no less Reason to believe 'Tis well known how zealous the primitive Christians were in the Preservation of the Scriptures We know they regarded them as their chief and dearest Treasure and often laid down their Lives rather than deliver the sacred Records to their Enemies who used every Art of Terror to seize and destroy them Again the Scriptures were not then locked up from the Laity as now in the  Roman  Church But Copies were taken dispersed and became immensely numerous They were universally read at the Times of pub∣lic Worship in different Nations of the World To this we may add that as  now  so  then  different Sects and Parties subsisted who all appealed to Scripture for Proof of their several Opinions and these 'tis evi∣dent must have been so many  Checks  upon each other to the general Exclusion of Mistake and Fraud  The JEWS and SAMARITANS were  Checks  upon each other in the same Manner for the Preservation of the Purity of the  Pentatouch  The  Samaritan Penta∣touch  was printed in the last Century And  "after  Two thousand Years  Discord between the Two Na∣tions varies as little from the other as any  Classic  Author in less Tract of Time has disagreed from it∣self by the  unavoidable Mistakes  of so many  Tran∣scribers  "  See  Phil Lipsiens    THIS being the real State of the Case let us now consider the noble Writer's Questions He asks whether by Scripture be under∣stood  "the apocryphal or more canonical the full or halfauthorized the doubtful or the certain the controverted or un∣controverted"  These Questions are nearly synonymous and one short Reply will clear them all There are many Books concerning which there never was  any Doubt  There are some concerning which the Doubts have been fully  cleared up  There are others concerning which the Doubts have been  confirmed  Of the first Kind are  all  the  Gospels  and  most  of the  Epistles  Of the second are the Epistle to the  Hebrews  the  second  of  Peter second  and  third  of  John  that of  Jude  and the  Apocalypse  Of the third Kind are the  apocryphal  Books therefore indeed so call∣ed  THE noble Author goes on  "The  single  read or that of  various  Reading"  My Lord if by single read you mean a Book in which there are no various Readings there are none  single read  Nor probably was there ever any Book  single read  that went thro' more than one Edition at least before the Invention of  Printing  And as the Scriptures were oftener transcribed than any other Book so a greater Variety of of Readings must naturally take Place But I must inform your Lordship from the learned PHILELEUTHERUS LIPSIENSIS that this is the most illiterate of all Cavils For that in Fact we have the  Sense  of those an∣cient Authors most  entire  where the vari∣ous Readings are most numerous As of those Authors where the Varieties are  few∣est  the Sense is most mutilated or obscure  For a full View of this Argument  See  Phil Lip∣siens  But if by  single read  your Lordship means an authentic Text collected and composed out of the various Readings I beg leave to inform you there is no such in the Protes∣tant Churches They have been too mo∣dest to attempt any such Thing Nor does the  Truth  suffer by it For as the learned Critic just before quoted observes the most faulty Copy of the new Testament now in  being does not obscure one moral Doc∣trine or one Article of Faith  AGAIN the noble Writer goes on in a Profusion of synonymous Terms  "The Transcripts Copies Titles Catalogues of this Church or that of this Sect or Party or another of those in one Age called orthodox or those who in another Age overthrew them"  What unexperi∣enced Person would not imagine from hence that  different  Churches Sects or Parties had  each  of them a Bible different from the rest Yet 'tis certain that however these Parties differed in Opinions we find from their Writings now subsisting that they all appealed to one common Scripture for their Support  THE noble Writer takes his Leave by paying a Compliment to these primitive Writers called the Fathers of the Church  "How these sacred Records were  guarded  in those Ages might be easily  imagined  " c  But to  imagine  is a much easier Task than to  prove  especially when Ima∣gination is helped forward by Inclination  Guarded  indeed they were as we have seen from Interpolation and Falshood But if he means to insinuate that they were  guard∣ed  from  Inspection  and  Criticism  he does great Injustice to Christianity For what∣ever Marks of secular Views may be disco∣vered in the Conduct of the ancient Chris∣tians in the succeeding Ages we may safe∣ly bid Defiance to the noble Writer's Ad∣mirers to shew any thing of this Kind in the Characters of those to whose Testimo∣ny we have here appealed and on whose Testimony joined to that of their nume∣rous and ingenuous Contemporaries the Authenticity of the GospelHistory depends They were far from acting or writing with a View to temporal Advantage they were struggling under the Weight of heavy Per∣secutions had no Motives to preach or write but the great Expectation of Happi∣ness hereafter founded on a firm Belief of that holy Religion which they propagated with an Effect  almost  if not  indeed miracu∣lous  ON this Occasion I cannot but observe a strange Insinuation thrown out elsewhere by the noble Writer which however is so glaring a Falshood that he finds himself obliged to disavow it even while he labours to impress it on his Reader's Imagina∣tion in all the Colours of Eloquence  "If  saies he the collateral Testimony of other ancient Records were destroyed there would be less Argument or Plea remain∣ing against that natural Suspicion of those who are called Sceptical that the holy Records themselves were no other than the pure Invention or artificial Compile∣ment of an interested Party in Behalf of the  richest Corporation  and most  profita∣ble Monopoly  in the World  Misc  v c  "  Now if his Lordship be indeed in earnest in urging this Insinuation he must believe that  one Set  of Men  preached  and  wrote  and en∣dured  Bonds  and  Imprisonment Torments  and  Death  to the End that  another Set  of Men some  three  or  four Hundred Years  after might enjoy the  rich Corporations  and  profitable Monopoly  of  Church Preferments  How far this may be a Proof of the noble Writer's  Sagacity  I shall leave others to de∣termine But if he  believes not  the Insinu∣ation as indeed he seems to  disbelieve  it then we cannot surely hesitate a Moment concerning the Measure of his  Since∣rity  THE Gentleman therefore who makes so ridiculous a Figure in the supposed Con∣versation  had he not been a poor  obsequious Puppet  might have returned one general and satisfactory Answer to all these extraor∣dinary Questions He might have desired his Lordship  "to chuse which he should like  best  or  worst  among all these contro∣verted Copies various Readings Manu∣scripts and Catalogues adopted by what∣ever Church Sect or Party"  Nay he might have desired him to chuse any of the almost infinite Number of Translations made of these Books in distant Countries and Ages And taking that to be the Scrip∣ture he appealed to might safely have re∣lied on it as amply sufficient for all the great Purposes of  Religion  and  Christianity  SECTION IV  SINCE therefore the  Scripture History  appears to be supported by  higher Degrees  of human Testimony than any other anci∣ent Writing the only Objections of real Weight against it must be drawn from it's  internal Structure  from the Facts it  relates  the Doctrines it  inculcates  or the Form of it's  Composition  THE  Facts  related being as it were the Foundation of all will naturally come first  under Consideration  "Now these say the Enemies of Christianity are  miracu∣lous  or  out of Nature  and therefore ab∣surd For  as they can prove nothing  so it is impossible that Accounts of this Kind could be so essentially mingled with a Religion that should come from God"  ON this Foundation the noble Writer hath taken frequent Occasion to deride what he calls the  "Mockery of Miracles  Misc  ii c  "  par∣ticularly those of our Saviour  Ib c  Here we shall find him striking at the very Basis of all revealed Religion while he asserts that even supposing the Truth of the Facts  "Miracles cannot witness either for God or Men nor are any Proof either of Divi∣nity or Revelation  Moralists  Part ii § passim  "  But that his Ar∣gument may be fairly represented let it appear in his own Words  "The Con∣templation of the Universe it's Laws and Government was I aver'd the only Means which could establish the sound Belief of a Deity For what tho' innumerable Miracles from every Part assailed the Sense and gave the trembling Soul no Respite What tho' the Sky should suddenly open and all kinds of Prodigies appear Voices be heard or  Characters read What would this evince more than that there was certain Powers could do all this But what Powers whether one or more whether superior or subaltern mortal or immortal wise or foolish just or unjust good or bad This would still remain a Mystery as would the  true Intention  the  Infallibility  or  Certainty  of whatever  these Powers as∣serted  Ib  "  'TIS remarkable that the noble Writer pretends here only to shew that Miracles are no Proof of the  Existence  of God Yet in the Conclusion of his Argument he brings it home to the Case of  Revelation  To  "the true  Intention  the  Infallibility  or  Certainty  of whatever  these Powers  AS∣SERTED"  This is clearly the Scope of his Argument And so indeed hath it been understood by his  Underworkmen  in  Infide∣lity  who have with great Industry retailed this Objection As it is a Circumstance of the last Importance in Regard to the Truth of  Christianity  it cannot be an unseasonable Task to shew in the fullest Manner the Vanity and Error of this tritc Cavil  BUT instead of considering  single Acts  of of supernatural or  miraculous Power  as be∣ing  performed in Attestation of any  particu∣lar Doctrine  which hath been the general Way of treating this Question 'tis my Design to consider as one Object  "that vast  Series  and  Concatenation  of miraculous Acts recorded in the Old and New Testament wrought thro' a long Succession of Ages for the  carrying on Support  and  Comple∣tion  of the  Christian Dispensation  WITH this View therefore let us first consider the means by which Mankind are justly convinced of the  Being  of a  God  Now this Conviction 'tis allowed by all ariseth from a  Union  of  Power Wisdom  ann  Good∣ness  displayed in the visible Creation From this  Union  alone arises the Idea of an  allperfect Being  so that a Failure in any of these three essential Circumstances would  destroy  the Idea of a  God  The  Goodness  of the Deity is seen in the designed End or Purpose of the Creation which is  "The Happiness of all his Creatures"  His  Wisdom  is seen in the proper Means employed for the Accomplish∣ment of this great End His  Power  fulfills what Goodness had intended and Wisdom contrived by putting these Means in Ex∣ecution Hence then alone we obtain the Idea of a  Divinity  from a  Union  of perfect  Goodness Wisdom  and  Power  'TIS likewise I think acknowledged by all  Theists  that as to the divine Power it may work it's Intentions either by a con∣tinued and uninterrupted Superintendency or Agency on Matter or by impressing certain original and permanent Qualities upon it Which of these two Kinds of Operation may really prevail in Nature is perhaps beyond the Reach of human Know∣ledge clearly to determine The  Newto∣nian  Philosophy indeed renders it highly probable that the  continued Agency  of  God  prevails But a Determination in this Sub∣ject is indeed of no Consequence since which soever of these Methods be ordained the  divine Power  is equally display'd while it ministers to the Ends of  Goodness  and  Wisdom  'TIS equally plain that if the divine Goodness should determine to raise Man∣kind to  higher Degrees  of  Knowledge  and  Virtue  than what they could attain to by the preestablished Laws of Nature or to free them from  Defects  and  Miseries  occasioned by any incidental and  voluntary  Corruptions  posterior  to their  Creation  'tis equally plain I say that an Exertion of  supernatural Power  for the Accomplishment  of  this End  would be a  Display Proof  or  Revelation  of the  Divinity  entirely similar to that which arises from the Works of Nature For both  here  and in the Works of  Nature  the Proof of the Divinity ariseth not from mere uniform Acts of Power but from the  Subserviency  of divine  Power  to this one great End the  Production  of human  Happiness  Here then the noble Writer's Objection is essentially defective What he affirms is either  false  or  foreign  to the Question For if we suppose and the present Question is put upon this Footing only that the miraculous or supernatural Effects are evidently subservient to similar Ends of  Wisdom  and  Goodness  as appear in the Works of the Creation then sure we have equal Reason to conclude and be convinced that they are the Effects of  one  Powerof one  superior  and  immortal  Powerof one Power  wise just  and  good  In a Word of that Power which first brought Nature into Being established Laws for the Welfare of his Creatures and when the Happiness of his Creatures requires an Interposition gives still further Evidences of his  Goodness Wisdom  and  Om∣nipotence  by controuling those Laws which himself had established  LET us now apply these Principles to the  Christian  Dispensation  "This we say was a Scheme of Providence which still continues operating whereby the Deity determined to raise fallen and cor∣rupted Man to higher Degrees of  Know∣ledge Virtue  and  Happiness  than what by Nature he could have attained"  In this Design the  divine  GOODNESS is emi∣nently display'd  THE Means whereby this great Design was accomplished was  "by separating a peculiar People from the rest of Man∣kind not for their own Sakes but for the Sake of all by preserving them amidst their Enemies by leading them forth into a distant Country by establishthere the Worship of the  one  God in Opposition to the Idolatries of surround∣ing Nations 'Till when the Fulness of Time should come and Mankind be ca∣pable of receiving a more perfect Reve∣lation a Saviour JESUS CHRIST should be sent to free Mankind from the Power of Ignorance and Sin to bring Life and Im∣mortality to Light and communicate to  all Men the most perfect practical Know∣ledge of the true God and of every moral Duty"  In this Dispensation is no less eminently displayed the  divine  WISDOM  BUT what less than Omnipotence itself could secure the perfect Execution of a Plan so  mighty  and  extensive  Which reaching thro' the Compass of many and distant Ages must combat the  Power  controul the  Prejudices  and work it's Way thro' the  discordant Manners  and  Opinions  of all the Kingdoms of the Earth On this Account the immediate Exertion of divine Power was necessary for it's  Proof Support  and  Completion  Accordingly we find it's om∣nipotent Author carrying on this Scheme of  Wisdom  and  Goodness  with a  mighty Hand  and an  outstretched Arm  "He sent a Man before his People even JOSEPH who was sold to be a BondServant He increased his People exceedingly and made them stronger than their Enemies He sent MOSES his Servant and AARON And these shewed his  Tokens  among them and  Wonders  in the Land of  Ham  He sent Darkness and it was dark and turned their Waters into Blood Their Land brought forth Frogs yea even in their  King's Chambers He gave them Hail∣stones for Rain and Flames of Fire in their Land He spake the Word and the Locusts came innumerable and de∣voured the Fruit of their Ground He smote all the firstborn in their Land even the chief of all their Strength He brought forth his People from among them He spread out a Cloud to be a Covering and Fire to give them Light in the NightSeason He rebuked the  RedSea  also and it was dried up so he led them thro' the Deep as thro' a Wilder∣ness At their Desire he brought Quails and filled them with the Bread of Heaven He opened the Rock of Stone so that Rivers ran in dry PlacesYet within a while they forgat his Works and tempt∣ed God in the Desert Then the Earth opened and swallowed up  Dathan  and covered the Congregation of  Abiram  They joined themselves unto  BaalPeor  and provoked him with their own Inven∣tions so the Plague was great among them Then being chastised they turn∣ed to their God He led them over  Jor∣dan  the Waters divided to let them pass He discomfited their Enemies At his  Word the Sun abode in the midst of Heaven and the Moon stood still and hasted not to go down for a whole Day So he gave the Kingdoms of  Canaan  to be an Heritage unto his People that all the Nations of the World might know that the Hand of the Lord is mighty and that they might fear the Lord con∣tinually"  HRRE then we see that this mighty Se∣ries of miraculous Acts recorded in the  Old Testament  being  the very Means  of  preserving  and  separating  the ISRAELITES from the  rest  of Mankind and at the same time designed to  impress  them with a  lasting Idea  of the un∣controulable and  immediate Power  of  God  were generally  awakening  Instances of  Om∣nipotence  often of  Justice  and  Terror  in the Punishment of  cruel  EGYPTIANS  rebellious  JEWS and  idolatrous Nations  IN pursuing this vast Concatenation of divine Power thro' the Series of Miracles recorded in the  New Testament  and wrought for the same End the  Completion  of  Christi∣anity  we shall find them of a very  different  Nature and  Complexion  Yet still admira∣bly suited to accomplish the  same  designed  Ends  of  Providence  For now the  Fulness  of Time  was come in which the Wisdom of the Deity ordained the immediate Establish∣ment of a Religion of perfect  Purity  and boundless  Love  Accordingly the Series of miraculous Acts wrought for this great End were such as must naturally  engage  Mankind to a  favourable Reception  of  Christianity  were the very  Image  and Transcript express∣ed the very  Genius  of that most  aimable  Re∣ligion they were brought to  support  and  esta∣blish  in a Word were continued Instances of  Omnipotence  joined with  unbounded Cha∣rity  divine  Compassion  and  Benevolence  THE Birth of JESUS was proclaimed by a glorious Apparition of superior Beings who declared the End of his coming in that divine Song of Triumph  "Glory to God in the highest and on Earth Peace Good Will towards Men"  His Life was one continued Scene of divine Power Wisdom and Beneficence He gave Eyes to the Blind Ears to the Deaf and Feet to the Lame He raised the Dead to Life re∣buked the raging Elements and made the Winds and Seas obey him When to ful∣fill the Decrees of Heaven and complete the great Work of Man's Redemption he submitted to an ignominious Death the  Vail of the Temple was rent in twain A general Darkness involved and an Earth∣quake shook the City The same Omni∣potence by which he wrought his Miracles raised him from the Grave and after a short stay on Earth during which he strengthened and confirmed his desponding Followers translated him to Heaven And now a new and  unexpected  Scene of divine and miraculous Power opened on Mankind for the full Establishment of  Christianity  The Spirit of God came down and dwelt with the Apostles they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and spake with other Tongues as the Spirit gave them Utterance They were invested with supernatural Power to heal Diseases were impowered to strike dead the deceitful ANANIAS and SAPPHI∣RA and when imprisoned were delivered by the immediate Hand of GOD By these Means Christianity gained a numerous Train of Proselytes among the JEWS but the great Work of converting the Gentiles was not yet begun To this End the Apostle PAUL was destined and converted to Christianity by an amazing Act of super∣natural and divine Power In this impor∣tant Ministry he was frequently preserved  by the miraculous Care of Providence did himself perform stupendous Acts of Power and Beneficence by these Means convert∣ing Multitudes among the Gentiles and planting Christianity in the most knowing and polished Nations of the Earth  TO this irresistible Chain of Evidence arising from the miraculous Exertion of divine Power we may add another  collate∣ral  Proof arising from the  miraculous  Em∣anations of divine  Foreknowledge  recorded in the Bible and delivered in PROPHECY thro' a Series of Ages all  centering  in the same Point the foretelling the  Completion  of this immense Plan of  Wisdom  and  Good∣ness  These  Predictions  were fulfilled in the Advent Life Death and Resurrection of our  Saviour  who himself foretold the Success of his Apostles among the Gentiles and the final Dissolution of the Jewish Po∣lity This came to pass in the Destruction of the  Temple  And when a bitter Enemy to Christianity attempted to make void the Decrees of Heaven in rebuilding this  Temple  the only Circumstance of Union that could ever make the JEWS  once more a People  the very Foundations were rent in Pieces by an  Earthquake and the mad Assailants against  Omnipotence  buryed in the Ruins  FROM this mighty  Union  therefore ariseth a Proof similar to that which we ob∣tain from the Works of Nature For as in  these  we see the Happiness of the Crea∣tion  intended plann'd  and  produced  and from hence discover the Agency of the Deity So in the Progress and Completion of  Christianity  we find a parallel Display of the divine Attributes We see the Advance∣ment of Man's Happiness  determined  by divine GOODNESS  plann'd  by divine WIS∣DOM  foretold  by divine KNOWLEDGE  ac∣complished  by divine POWER and hence as in  Nature  obtain a full  Manifestation Proof  or  Revelation  of the DEITY  AS this seems to be the true Light in which the Evidence arising from the Scrip∣tureMiracles ought to be placed it may be proper now to add a few Observations on what hath been offered on this Subject both by the  Defenders  and the  Adversaries  of  Christianity  I AS to the Degree of Proof or Evi∣dence arising from a  single Miracle  in Sup∣port of any  particular Doctrine  whatever Force it may carry 'tis a Point which we  are by no Means at present concerned to de∣termine Because as we have seen in the Progress of the Christian Dispensation there is a vast  Series  or  Chain  all  uniting  in one common End It might be considered in the same Manner by those who write in Proof of the Being of a God  "What Evi∣dence of his Being would arise from a single  Vegetable  or  Animal  unconnected with the rest of the Creation"  But how∣ever satisfying a single Fact of this Kind may be to impartial Minds it were surely weak to argue on this Foundation  only  while we can appeal to that mighty  Union of Design  which appears in the Works of Nature It should therefore seem that the Defenders of Christianity have generally set this Evidence in too  detached  and  par∣ticular  a Light For tho' the Proof arising from a single Miracle in Support of a par∣ticular Doctrine may be of sufficient Force to convince an equitable Mind yet sure 'tis infinitely stronger and more satisfactory if we  view at once  the whole  Chain  of Mira∣cles by which the great Scheme of  Christi∣anity  was propagated as  one  vast  Object  Because in this View we discover innume∣rable Circumstances of  mutual Relation  and  Agreement  similar to those which are Proofs of  final Causes  in the natural World In a Word we discover that  Union of Design  that Concurrence of infinite  Goodness Wis∣dom  and  Power  which is the sure Indica∣tion of the  Divinity  II IF in a Dispensation thus proved to be from God by all these concurring Sig∣natures of Divinity any  incidental Circum∣stances  should be found which are  unac∣countable  to  human Reason  'tis the Part of human Reason to  acquiesce  in this  mysterious  and  unknown  Part from what is  clear  and  known  Because in a System or Dispensa∣tion planned by  infinite  Wisdom there  must  of Necessity be something which  finite  Wisdom cannot comprehend This the noble Writer allows with Regard to the Works of Nature  "If saith he in this  mighty Union  there be such Relations of Parts one to another as are not easily dis∣covered if on this Account the  End  and  Use  of Things does not every where ap∣pear there is  no Wonder  since 'tis indeed no more than what  must happen  of  Necessity  Nor could supreme Wisdom have otherwise ordered it For in an In∣finity of things thus relative  a Mind  which sees not infinitely can see nothing fully  Moralists  P ii §  "  III HENCE therefore may be evinced the Vanity of this Cavil  "that nothing can be proved to be a divine Revelation which is not discoverable by human Reason since whatever is reasonable needs no Miracle to confirm it and whatever is beyond the Reach of Reason cannot be made to ap∣pear reasonable by any Miracle whatso∣ever  An Objection urged by  Tindal Morgan  and others  "  Hence I say the Vanity of this Cavil is evident Because as in Nature so in Revelation the full Evidence of Di∣vinity is founded not on single detached Circumstances but on a mighty  Union  or  Concatenation  of Facts implying the most perfect  Wisdom Power  and  Goodness  This Foundation being once laid if any thing  in∣cidental  in either Case appears unaccounta∣ble as to it's  End  or  Use  it is naturally and properly involved or taken in as  a Part  of this  immense Design  which thro' it's vast Extent must needs be  incomprehensible  to  human Reason  IV As to the Objection  "that Mira∣cles may be wrought by inferior or sub∣altern  baltern Beings"  This vanishes at once with Regard to the  Christian  Dispensation on the Evidence as here stated For as the miraculous Acts of Power recorded in the Bible were wrought for the Support and Accomplishment of a Dispensation full of  Goodness  and  Wisdom  we have the same Proof that they were the Work of the  su∣preme God  as we have  that Nature is so  'Tis true that in either Case for aught we know  inferior  or  subaltern  Beings may have been commissioned by the  Supreme  as  immediate Agents  But this Possibility in either Case can be a Matter of no Con∣sequence to us while it is manifest that the  delegated  Beings whatever they might be acted in full  Subserviency  to the  Goodness Wisdom  and  Omnipotence  of the  one eter∣nal  GOD  V To the noble Writer's Objection  "that while we labour to unhinge Nature we bring Confusion on the World and destroy that Order from whence the one infinite and perfect Principle is known  Moral  P ii §  "  the Reply is easy and convincing For while the supernatural Power is directed to advance the Happiness of Mankind 'tis so  far from destroying any Principle from whence the one perfect Being is known that on the contrary it gives us still clearer and more satisfying Notices of the divine Providence 'Tis allowed on all Hands that there are Imperfections in the Crea∣tion And tho' there may be and doubtless are good Reasons unknown to us why these should not in every Instance be re∣moved by a particular Exertion of superna∣tural Power yet when the divine Wisdom sees fit thus to interpose for the further Ad∣vancement of his Creatures' Happiness can any thing be more irrational than to say that  "this is bringing Confusion on the World"  The only Question is Whether  "  Happiness  shall be destroyed for the sake of a preestablished  Law  or a preesta∣blished  Law  be  suspended  for the sake of  Happiness  "  In other Words whether  Power  shall be subservient to  Goodness  or  Goodness  yield to  Power  A Question which no sound  Theist  can be left at a Loss to answer As therefore the Exertion of di∣vine Power  in Nature  is for the Pro∣duction of  Happiness  the  miraculous  Exer∣tion of Power for the further  Advancement  of Man's  Happiness  is so far from  "bring∣ing  Confusion on the World either the Chaos and Atoms of the  Atheists  or the Magick and Daemons of the POLYTHE∣ISTS"  that it is even the clearest  Proof  or  Revelation  of the DIVINITY  VI WITHOUT this apparent Subservi∣ency to the Designs of Wisdom and Good∣ness all Accounts of miraculous Facts must be highly improbable Because we have no Reason to believe that the Deity will ever counteract the established Laws of Nature unless for the Sake of advancing the Happiness of his Creatures  VII ON this Account most of the pre∣tended Miracles recorded in the  Heathen  Story are highly  improbable  For it doth not appear they were ever said to have been wrought in any  Series  or  Chain  they never were  directed  to the Accomplishment of any  one End  thro'  different Periods  of Time Were frequently far from being  beneficent  Seldom accommodated even to any  rational  Purpose but generally mere pretended Acts of  arbitrary  and  unmeaning Power  Thus they are essentially distin∣guished from the Scripture Miracles and are utterly destitute of that INTERNAL  Evidence  which ariseth from an  Union  of  Design  VIII HENCE we may clearly discover the Reason why the wiser Heathens ridi∣culed the  Jews  even to a  Proverb  for their extravagant Regard to  Miracles  They knew their own to be  absurd  and  irratio∣nal  this at once prevented them from en∣quiring into the real Nature of the  Jewish  Miracles and at the same Time led them to  deride  and  reject  these boasted  Wonders  as being no better than their own  IX BUT on the Evidence as here stated the Scripture Miracles become even  proba∣ble  from the Circumstances under which they are recorded As they are beneficent As they were wrought thro'  different Pe∣riods  of Time in  Support  of  one  Dispensation full of  Wisdom  and  Goodness  As it is highly improbable that this Dispensation could have been  completed  in all it's immense  Vari∣ety  of  Circumstances  without such an imme∣diate  Interposition  of divine  Power  X AND now we shall plainly see the Reason why we reject the Accounts of Miracles given by Heathen Writers while we believe the other Parts of their Story and yet cannot reject the  Jewish  and  Chris∣tian  Miracles without rejecting at the same Time the whole History in which they are contained For in the first Case as the Miracles are  useless unmeaning  and  uncon∣nected  with the rest of the Facts it appears they are merely political But the  Jewish  and  Christian  Miracles make an essential Part of the several Events related they are strongly connected with this great HIS∣TORY  of  PROVIDENCE and are indeed  the very Means  by which  Providence  completed it's gracious  Purpose  "the Establishment of Christianity"  We cannot therefore reject these  miraculous  Accounts without re∣jecting all the  natural Events  with which they are thus intimately  interwoven  And this we cannot do without destroying every received Principle of Assent and shaking the Faith of all ancient History  I cannot conclude this Argument with∣out transcribing a noble Passage from the Book of  Wisdom  where several of these Truths are finely illustrated And which may convince us how just an Idea the JEWS entertained of  miraculous Interposition  beyond what their Enemies have industri∣ously represented The Writer after re∣counting the stupendous Chain of Miracles  wrought for the Deliverence of the chosen People concludes thus  "In all things O Lord thou hast magnified and glori∣fied thy People and hast not despised to assist them in every Time and PlaceFor every Creature in it's Kind was fa∣shioned a new and served in their own  Offices enjoyned them  that thy Children might be kept without HurtFor the things of the Earth were changed into things of the Water and the thing that did swim went upon the Ground The Fire had power in the Water contrary to his own Virtue and the Water forgat his own Kind to quenchThus the Elements were  changed  among themselves by  a Kind of Harmony  as when one  Tune  is  changed  upon an  Instrument  of Music and  the Melody still remaineth  THUS he nobly expresseth the  Subservi∣ency  of the  Elements  to the  divine Will  And under the Image of a musical Instru∣ment which the skilful Master  tunes changes  and  directs  to the  one  Purpose of  Harmony  he aptly and beautifully represents the  whole Creation  as an  Instrument  in the Hands of GOD which he  orders varies  and  con∣trouls  to the  one unvary'd End  of HAPPI∣NESS  SECTION V  HAVING vindicated the Scripture  Miracles  from the noble Writer's Objec∣tions and shewn that they are so far from being  useless  or  absurd  that the grand Scheme of Providence could neither have been  evi∣denced  nor  accomplished  without them we have destroyed the chief Foundation on which his Lordship hath attempted to fix his Cavils against Christianity on another Subject I mean that of  Enthusiasm  which naturally offers itself next to our Considera∣tion As this is the noble Writer's favourite Topic we may reasonably expect to see him shine in it And in one Respect indeed he does He never touches on the Subject but he riseth above himself His Imagi∣nation kindles he catches the Fire he de∣scribes and his Page glows with all the Ardors of this high Passion  IT will I presume be unnecessary to make any Remarks on the large and emi∣nent List of  Enthusiasts  Poets Orators Heroes Legislators Musicians and Philo∣sophers  which his Lordship cites from PLATO He may call them  Enthusiasts  if it seem good to him and may justly rank himself in the Number too if by that Name be understood no more than a Man of uncommon Strength or Warmth of Imagi∣nation for this indeed is the requisite Found∣ation of Excellence in any of the Charac∣ters here enumerated  THE only Circumstance we are concern∣ed  calmly  to examine is that of  religious En∣thusiasm  Chiefly to point out the essential Qualities and Characteristics which dis∣tinguish  this  from  divine Inspiration  Hence to prove that our  Saviour  and his  Apostles  were not  religious Enthusiasts  as the noble Writer hath suggested  'TIS indeed as his Lordship observes  "a great Work to judge of Spirits whether they be of God"  We shall willingly join him in this Principle too  "that in or∣der to this End we must antecedently judge our own Spirit whether it be of Reason or sound Sense free of every byassing Passion every giddy Vapour or melancholy Fume This is the first Knowledge and previous Judgment to understand ourselves and know what  Spirit we are of Afterwards we may judge the Spirit in others consider what their personal Merit is and prove the Va∣lidity of their Testimony by the Solidity of their Brain"  On this Principle then let the Cause be determined  IN examining this Subject therefore we shall find First that in  some  Respects  En∣thusiasm  must from it's Nature always re∣semble  divine Inspiration  Secondly that in others it hath generally attempted a fur∣ther Resemblance but hath always betrayed itself Thirdly that in other Circum∣stances it is diametrically opposite to divine Inspiration and void even of all seeming Resemblance  FIRST  Enthusiasm  must from it's very Nature in some Respects always resemble divine  Inspiration  They both have the  Deity  for their Object and consequently must both be attended with a devout Turn of Mind They must both be subject to strong and unusual Impressions the one  supernatural  the other  praeternatural  that is beyond the ordinary Efforts of Nature tho' really produced by Nature  these  thro' their uncommon Force will often resemble and not easily be distinguished from  those  which are the real Effect of  supernatural  Power This Circumstance deserves a par∣ticular Attention For these two Qualities which are common to both have induced many to reject the very Notion of divine Inspiration as mere Ethusiasm Whereas we see that supposing such a thing as di∣vine  Inspiration  it cannot but resemble  En∣thusiasm  in these two Characters  BUT tho' it were strange if  Counterfeits  did not hit off some Features of their genuine  Originals  yet it were more strange if they should be able to adopt them all by such a perfect Imitation as to prevent their being detected  THERE are therefore secondly other Circumstances in which  Enthusiasm  hath generally attempted a further Resemblance of divine  Inspiration  but in these hath al∣ways betrayed itself  spurious  The first of this Kind is  "A Pretence to and Persuasion of the Power of work∣ing  Miracles  "  This Persuasion must needs be natural to the Enthusiast because he imagines himself in all things highly favoured of Heaven The Notion of a Communication of  divine Power  will there∣fore be among the chief of his  Deliriums  In this the Enthusiast hath been detected  sometimes  by the  Absurdity  of the Miracle attempted  always  by his  Inability  to per∣form what he proposed There is scarce an  Absurdity  so great but what hath some Time or other been aimed at by Enthu∣siasts in the Way of miraculous Power Their Attempts have ever been void of all  rational Intention  void of  Beneficence  void of  common Discernment  And hence mani∣festly the Effects of a heated Imagination That they have always failed in their At∣tempts is no less known But these are Truths so willingly allowed by the Enemies of Religion that we need not enlarge on them On the contrary we have seen the Miracles of the Gospel are  rational be∣neficent united  in one great  End  perform∣ed before  Numbers  before  Enemies  record∣ed by  EyeWitnesses  His Lordship indeed objects or insinuates that the Testimony even of EyeWitnesses cannot in this Case be a Foundation for Assent unless we know them to have been  "free both from any particular Enthusiasm and a general Turn to Melancholy"  But with Regard to the Miracles of the Gospel we know that many were converted by them from their former  Prejudices and therefore could not pos∣sibly be under the Influence of the  Christian  Enthusiasm supposing it such And as to their being free from  Melancholy  for this we may safely appeal to the rational and consistent Accounts given by the sacred Penmen Melancholy and Enthusiasm must ever produce inconsistent Visions For a Proof that the Scripture Miracles are not of this Nature we appeal to what hath been already said on this Subject in the preceeding Section  BUT there is  one  miraculous Gift  the Gift of Tongues  which hath more generally been supposed the peculiar Effect of Inspi∣ration We have an Account of this Kind recorded in holy Writ  Acts  ii  And this Account the noble Writer hath thought it expedient to turn to Ridicule by representing this supposed miraculous Gift as the mere Ef∣fect of strong  Melancholy  and natural  Ine∣briation  To this Purpose having observed from Dr MORE that  "the Vapours and Fumes of Melancholy partake of the Na∣ture of Wine"  he adds  "One might conjecture from hence that the malicious Opposers of early Christianity were not un∣versed  in this Philosophy when they so∣phistically objected against the apparent Force of the divine Spirit speaking in di∣vers Languages and attributed it  to the Power of new Wine  Misc  ii §  "  Agreably to this in∣sinuated Charge he tells us of  "A Gen∣tleman who has writ lately in Defence of revived Prophecy and has since fallen himself into the prophetic Ecstasies"  The noble Writer adds  "I saw him lately un∣der an  Agitation  as they call it  uttering Prophecy  in a pompous  Latin Style  of which out of his Ecstasy it seems  he is wholly incapable  Let on Enthu  §  "  HERE we may see how ready some People are to strain at a  Gnat  and yet swal∣low a  Camel  The noble Writer ridicules the Gift of Tongues from  divine Inspira∣tion  as absurd and impossible Yet he be∣lieves you see or  affects  to believe that this Man could speak  Latin  by the sole Force of  Imagination  and  Enthusiasm  A com∣pendious Method this of learning Langua∣ges I have somewhere met with a very ra∣tional Remark That whereas it was charg∣ed by FESTUS upon St PAUL  "that  Learning  had made him  mad  "  this No∣tion  inverts the Charge for thus  "  Mad∣ness  may make a Man  learned  "  BUT leaving his Lordship's Admirers to determine which is the greater Miracle a  Gift  of Tongues from  God  or a Gift of Tongues from  Melancholy  'tis our Part to shew the essential Characters of Distinction between the  Reality  of  one  and the  Pretences  of the  other  Now this will appear most evident if we compare them both in their  Manner  and their  End  As to the  Manner  of this  new prophecying Sect  the noble Wri∣ter himself tells us it was that of  Ecstacy  and  Convulsion  and that he saw this Gen∣tleman under an  Agitation  when he had the  Gift of Tongues  As to the  End  pretended in this miraculous  Gift  it appears there was really  none  For the  pompous Latin Style  was uttered among a People who in general understood the  English  Language  only  It could therefore serve to no  rational Purpose  On the contrary it appears that the miraculous Gift of Tongues conferred on the Apostles was  rational  both in its  Man∣ner  and it's  End  There is not the least Hint of it's having been attended with  Ecs∣tasies  or  Convulsions  nay it appears from  the Account that it could not have been so attended And from the  Occasion  it appears how proper it was with Regard to it's  End  The Recital is noble and rational Let it answer for itself  "And there were dwelling at Jerusalem JEWS devout Men out of  every Nation  under HeavenAnd they were all amazed and marvelled saying one to another Behold are not all these which speak  Galileans  And how hear we  every  Man in  our own Tongue  wherein we were born  Parthians  and  Medes  and  Elamites  the Dwellers in  Me∣sopotamia  and in  Judea  and  Cappodocia  in  Pontus  and  Asia Phrygia  and  Pam∣phylia  in  Egypt  and in the Parts of  Libya  about  Cyrene  And Strangers of  Rome Jews  and  Proselytes Cretes  and  Arabians  we do  hear them speak in our Tongues the wonderful Works of God  "  How just an Effort of divine Power which should at once give  Instruction  to those who most wanted it and be the  natural Means  of conveying and  dispersing  the glad Tydings of the  Gospel  to  every Nation under Heaven  It should seem probable therefore that the Men who  "mocked and said these Men are full of new Wine"  were the  Natives of  Judea  For PETER we find immediately arose and addressed himself to these in par∣ticular  "Ye Men of  Judea  " c  And it was natural for them to entertain this Suspicion because they neither understood what the Apostles uttered nor could imagine how they should obtain a Knowledge of so many various Tongues They must there∣fore naturally suspect that the Apostles were uttering  unmeaning Sounds  And this they regarded as the Effect of  Wine  ANOTHER remarkable Circumstance in which Enthusiasts have often pretended to resemble the divinely inspired is  "the Gift of Prophecy"  Which indeed is no more than another Kind of Miracle In this too Enthusiasm hath always betrayed itself First and principally with regard to the Event The frequent Attempts of this Kind and their perpetual  Failure  need not here been umerated They are known sufficiently This cannot be charged on the  Apostles  with the least Appearance of Reason For it is a Gift they hardly ever pretended to Our  Saviour  indeed foretold many and great Eventsthe Defection of PETER his own Sufferings Death Resurrection and Ascen∣sion the Descent of the Holy Spirit the  Persecution of his Disciples the Propagation of his Religion among the Gentiles the ap∣proaching Miseries and final Destruction of  Jerusalem  Now all these Events were clearly accomplished So far therefore are they from proving him an  Enthusiast  that they demonstrate him possessed of  di∣vine ForeKnowledge  BUT besides the  Event  there is a not∣able Circumstance in the  Manner  which hath ever distinguished  real  from  pretended true  from  false  Prophecy And which the noble Writer's groundless Affirmations have made it necessary to insist on  HE says  "I find by present Experience as well as by all Histories sacred and pro∣phane that the Operation of this Spirit is every where the  same  as to the  bodily Organ  Let on Enth  §  "  In Confirmation of this he cites a Passage from the Gentleman who was sub∣ject to the prophetic Ecstasies which in∣forms us  "that the ancient Prophets had the Spirit of God upon them under Ec∣stasy with divers strange Gestures of Body denominating them Madmen or Enthu∣siasts as appears evidently says he in the Instances of  Balaam Saul David  Ezekiel Daniel  Ib  " c  And he adds the Gentleman  "proceeds to justify this by the Practice of the apostolic Times and by the Regulation which the Apostle himself applies to these seemingly irregu∣lar Gifts  Ib  "  In this Instance it is not unpleasant to observe the different Views of his Lordship and the Gentleman he refers to in their Endeavours to establish this pretended Fact The  one  was zealous to fix a Resemblance between the  old  and the  new  prophetic Manner in order to strengthen the Credit of the  revived  Prophecy The  other's  Intention plainly was by that very  Resemblance  which he was willing should pass for  real  to destroy the Credit of the  Scripture  Prophecies well knowing that the other deserved none  BUT so it happens that the noble Wri∣ter's Friend proves as bad an  Historian  as he was a  Prophet  And fails as miserably in relating  past  Events as in foretelling  future  The Truth is that both his Lord∣ship and the Gentleman seem to have been in a  Fit of Enthusiasm  and have therefore been induced to mingle a little  pious Fraud  thro' a Zeal for their respective  Theories  For in Reality this pretended Resemblance is utterly fictitious There is not the least Hint in Scripture that any of the Persons mentioned as true Prophets were ever sub∣ject to these  Ecstatic convulsive  Motions which the enthusiastic Gentleman and his Tribe were always seized with As to the Regulation made by the Apostle PAUL whoever consults the Place    Corinth  c xiv  will find there is no Mention made of  Ecstasies Convulsions  or extraordinary  bodily Motions  And 'tis clear that our Saviour always delivered his Prophecies on every  incidental  Occasion under all the  common Circumstances  of hu∣man Life  calm serene  and with  unaffected Deliberation  So that the whole Charge is a bold continued Falshood void of Truth and even the Appearance of it  INDEED from the Instances which the noble Writer cites from VIRGIL and LIVY 'tis evident that the old  heathen Pretenders  to Prophecy were affected in the same  con∣vulsive  Manner as the  modern Christian  En∣thusiasts His Lordship might have cited twenty more from ancient Writers And what can be rationally inferred from them What but this  "That this  convulsive  Agitation  of the bodily Organs is a Cir∣cumstance that effectually  betrays Enthu∣siasm  and distinguisheth it from the real  Inspirations  recorded in  holy Writ  "  THESE are the Circumstances in which Enthusiasm will generally  seem  to  resemble  real Inspiration tho' on a nearer Scrutiny these very Circumstances will always  detect  it We come now to enumerate those other Qualities peculiar to Enthusiasm in which it bears no Resemblance to divine Inspira∣tion and in which they are at first View clearly distinguished from each other And here it is remarkable that as the noble Writer  dwells  on the  former  so he scarce ever  touches  on these following Characters of  clear distinction  This pecu∣liar Conduct can hardly be judged  acciden∣tal  For a Man of Wit can easily improve a  partial  Resemblance into a  complete  one But to have added other  Features  of abso∣lute  Dissimilarity  would have weakened the  Likeness  and consequently have disgraced the  intended Representation  THE chief Qualities which clearly and at first View distinguish  Enthusiasm  from divine  Inspiration  I find enumerated by the  fine Writer of  the Letter on St Paul's Con∣version  These are  "  Heat  of Temper  Me∣lancholy Credulity SelfConceit  and  Ig∣norance  "  So far as these relate to St PAUL the Reader is referred to the excel∣lent Work here cited 'Tis our Part to consider them as they may affect our Sa∣viour and the rest of his Apostles And a brief Consideration may suffice For all except the last are so repugnant to their Characters that the very Mention of them refutes the Imputation  WITH Regard to the first of these Qua∣lities  "uncommon Heat of Temper"  'tis of all others most abhorrent from our  Sa∣viour's  Character He is every where sedate cool and unmoved even under the most bit∣ter Circumstances of Provocation  See Dr  Law's  Life of  Christ  Where his Character is described at large  He every where appears a perfect Model of Benevolence Meekness and mild Majesty The same Temper generally prevails among his Apostles More particularly we may observe of the  Evangelists  who are the  im∣mediate Evidences  that in their Writings they discover the most perfect  Coolness  Had they been of a fiery Disposition they had  not failed to load the Enemies of their crucified Lord with the bitterest  Sarcasms  WITH as little Reason can  Melancholy  be charged on the Founders of Christianity Our  Saviour  came  "eating and drinking"  So entirely  open unreserved  and  social  that he was branded by his Enemies as  a Friend of Publicans and Sinners  Another Cir∣cumstance besides the Passion for  Solitude  hath ever distinguished  Melancholy  That is  "an  OverFondness  and  Desire  to  suffer  in the apprehended Cause of Truth be∣yond the just and rational  Ends of Suffer∣ing  "  Now this is diametrically opposite to the Character of our Saviour and his Apostles For even JESUS himself was in an  Agony  at the Apprehension of his ap∣proaching Sufferings So far were his Dis∣ciples from being tainted with this Melan∣choly that they discovered  unmanly Fear  for  they all forsook him and fled  'Tis true they afterwards endured the severest Trials with unshaken Constancy yet still with the  resigned  Spirit of  Martyrs  not the  Eager∣ness  and  fanatic Vaunts  of all known  En∣thusiasts  For a remarkable Instance of this see a Story re∣lating to SAVANOROLA  Charact Misc  ii c in the Notes    THE Charge of  Credulity  hath no better Foundation To our Saviour himself it is in it's very Nature utterly  inapplicable  His Disciples have been often charged with  Cre∣dulity  But on impartial Examination it will appear that the Charge is groundless For this is an unvarying Circumstance in the Credulity of an Enthusiast  "that it never admits a Doubt"  But it is evident from the united Accounts of the GospelHistory that they osten nay always  doubted  of our Saviour's  Death  tho' himself foretold it 'Tis equally evident they not only doubted of but almost disbelieved his Resurrection till overcome by irresistible Evidence These Circumstances afford another collateral Proof that the Apostles were not Enthusiasts Be∣cause it is essentially of the Nature of En∣thusiasm  "to run on headlong in the  open  Channel of the  First conceived Opinion  "  Now 'tis evident they  changed  their  first Opinion  concerning the  temporal  Dominion of CHRIST into the firm Belief of his  Death Resurrection  and  spiritual  Kingdom We cannot therefore justly charge them with that  Credulity  which is the Characteristic of  Enthusiasm  See this Point treated with great Particularity of Proof in a Pamphlet intitled "  A Discourse proving that the Apostles were no Enthusiasts  " By  A Campbel  S T P    THE next Circumstance  SelfConceit  which hath ever been one of the most dis∣tinguishing Qualities of Enthusiasm is so distant from the Character of JESUS and his  Apostles  that it hath never I believe been laid to their Charge The Enthusiast is perpetually boasting of immediate  Con∣verse  and  Communication  with the  Deity  and overflows with a Contempt of all who are not of his own System In our Saviour we discover the most unfeigned  Humility  and  Compassion  towards all Men When urged to shew his  Pretensions  to a divine Mission so far is he from resolving them into  in∣ward Feelings Impulses  or  Notices  from God the constant Practice of every Enthu∣siast that on the contrary he calmly ap∣peals to his Works and Doctrines  Mat  vii  adding in a Strain the  Reverse  of all  Enthusiasm  that  "in what we bear Witness only to ourselves our Witness cannot be esta∣blished as a Truth  John  v  "  The same Turn of Mind appears in the Apostles They affect no Superiority themselves nor express or  discover any Contempt or  spiritual Pride  with Regard to others  THE last Quality common to Enthusiasts is that of  Ignorance  This hath been some∣times charged on our Saviour himself often on his Apostles with an Air of Triumph But so it is that  seeming Objections  against Truth become often the  strongest Evidence  in Support of it This will eminently ap∣pear in the present Case if we consider  "that Ignorance or Want of Letters when joined with Enthusiasm must always produce the most  inconsistent  Visions  whimsical  Conduct and  pernicious  Doc∣trines"  These Effects  Ignorance  and  En∣thusiasm  have wrought wherever they ap∣peared in every Age and Nation Nor can it indeed be otherwise For a  lettered  En∣thusiast may be supposed to have an  inter∣nal Balance  which must in some Degree  counteract  and  regulate  his Visions while the  unlettered  is subject to no Controul but must become the Sport and Prey to the  de∣lirious  Flights of an  unreined Imagination  NOW that the Apostles and Evangelists were  unlearned  must needs be granted And tho' the noble Writer hath taken upon him to deride them on this Account yet  this very Circumstance compared with their Conduct and Writings clears them at once from the Charge of Enthusiasm So far were they from the  ravings  of this Passion common to all  ignorant  Enthusiasts that we may defy the Enemies of  Christianity  to produce any Instance either of Speech or Practice that hath the smallest Tincture of  Extravagance  Their Conduct was regu∣lar and exemplary their Words were  the Words of Truth and Soberness  AS to the Charge of Ignorance against our Saviour the Enemies of Christianity have been more  cautious  Yet it hath been insinuated And indeed that he had not the common Aids of  human Learning  is not only  acknowledged  but  insisted  on Could  ignorant  and  blind Enthusiasm  then have produced the sublime  religious Doctrines  and  moral Precepts  which the Evangelists have  recorded  from his Mouth With as much Truth it might be affirmed that the  Crea∣tion  is the Produce of  Chance  With Reason then may we ask the noble Writer this Question  "Whence then had this Man  such Wisdom  seeing he spake as never Man spake"  And the Answer sure is  one  only  "That as it was not from  Man  it must  have been from GOD"  For even the Ene∣mies of Christianity have born Witness to it's Excellence even when they intended to disgrace it While with fruitless Labour they have attempted to prove  "that the most exalted  Truths  and  Precepts  of the  Gospel  may be found  scattered  among the Writings of the  heathen Sages  "  FROM these concurrent Circumstances therefore we obtain a full  internal Proof  that the  Founders of Christianity  were not  Enthusiasts  as the noble Writer hath by the most laboured and repeated Insinuations attempted to represent them  SECTION VI  SINCE therefore we have appealed to the  religious  and  Moral  Doctrines of  Christianity  as a concurrent Proof of it's  divine Original  it will be necessary now to examine what the noble Writer hath al∣ledged or suggested against this most  essen∣tial  Part of our Religion  AND first it appears from the general Turn of the  Characteristics  that the noble Author regards  religious Establishments  as being quite at a distance from  Philosophy  and  Truth  with which he tells us in ancient Times they never interfered He therefore derides every Attempt to make them  co∣alesce  Thus he tells us  "Not only  Visio∣naries  and  Enthusiasts  of all Kinds were tolerated by the Ancients but on the other Side Philosophy had as free a Course and was permitted as a Balance against SuperstitionThus Matters were happily balanced Reason had fair Play Learning and Science flourished Won∣derful was the Harmony and Temper which arose from all these  Contrarieties  Let on Enthus  "  Such therefore being his Lordship's Idea of a  public Religion  which he ever opposes to  private Opinion  and Philosophy 'tis no Wonder he should insinuate the Folly of Christianity which promiseth to all it's Pro∣selytes  "that they shall know the  Truth  and the Truth shall make them  free  "  BUT notwithstanding the noble Writer's Partiality to the System of ancient Paganism which he had deeply imbibed from his fa∣miliar Converse with ancient Writers no unprejudiced Mind can hesitate a Moment in determining the superior Excellence of the  Christian  Religion compared with these  wellmeant  but defective Schemes of  heathen Policy  For as gross Error and Misap∣prehension of the divine Nature and Attri∣butes was deeply interwoven with ancient Paganism so 'tis well known that in Fact the most horrid Enormities were committed  upon Principle  under the Authority and Example of their pretended Gods Lord SHAFTESBURY himself owns what indeed it were folly to deny that the  Imitation  of the  Deity  is a  powerful  Principle of Action  Enq on Virtue  If so it follows that to communicate a just Idea of the divine Perfections to all Man∣kind must tend to  secure  their  Virtue  and  promote  their  Happiness  'Tis therefore equally  ungenerous  and  impolitic  to suffer Mankind to live in  Ignorance  and  Idolatry  Hence 'tis evident that  Reformations  in Re∣ligion are not the ridiculous Things his Lordship would represent them and that  Christianity  if indeed it  reveals  the  Truth  is a Religion in it's Tendency much more  beneficial  to Mankind than ancient  Pa∣ganism  'TIS no difficult Task to assign the ori∣ginal Cause of this so different and even  op∣posite Genius  of the  pagan  Systems from that  of  Christianity  In early and ignorant Ages the Necessity of religious Belief and religious Establishments was seen by the Leaders of Mankind On this Account they instituted the most  salutary  Forms and Doctrines which their unexperienced Reason could suggest As Nations grew wiser and more polished they saw the Weakness and Absurdity of these established Systems but thro' a Regard and perhaps a  mistaken  one to the  public Good  were unwilling to dis∣cover these Defects and Absurdities to the People Hence probably the Rise of  ex∣oteric  and  esoteric  Doctrines For the fur∣thest that human Policy dared to go was to reveal the Truth to a  few initiated  While the Bulk of Mankind even in the  wisest  and politest  Ages  continued the  Dupes  to the  Prejudices  and  Superstitions  of the most  ignorant  ones On the contrary it was a main Design of the Christian Dis∣pensation to dispel this Cloud of Ignorance which excluded Mankind from all Partici∣pation of  divine Truth  to reveal those just and sublime Ideas of the  Divinity  which are the noblest as they are the surest Foun∣dation not only of  Piety  but of  Morals  And which so far as they can affect either  Piety  or  Morals  such is the Triumph of  Christianity  over the laboured Researches of  false Wisdom  are no less  intelligible  to the  Peasant  than the  Philosopher  On this Ac∣count Christianity was perfect  relatively  perfect in it's first Delineation All At∣tempts to change or add to its Doctrines have but discovered their own Absurdity And Experience every Day more and more convinceth us that the only Method of ob∣taining a pure and uncorrupt System of practical Religion and moral Precepts is to search for them in the uncommented Pages of the Gospel  THUS what was the Effect of  Necessity  among the  Heathens  the noble Writer very partially attributes to  Choice  He mistakes a  Defect  for an  Excellence  And blindly prefers the Weakness of  Man  to the Wis∣dom of GOD  ANOTHER Cavil frequently urged or in∣sinuated by his Lordship against  Christianity  seems to have been the natural Consequence of the lastmentioned He much admires the Pagan Religions as having been  sociable  and mutually  incorporated  into each other And often represents  Christianity  as of an  unsociable surly  and  solitary  Complexion  tending to  destroy  every other but itself The Consequence of this he tells us hath been a  "new Sort of Policy which extends it∣self to another World and hath made us leap the Bounds of natural Humanity and out of a  supernatural Charity  has taught us the Way of plaguing one an∣other most devoutly  Let on Enthu  "  Now with Regard to this pretended  unsociable  Temper of  Christianity  it must be owned indeed that our Religion tends to swallow up and de∣stroy every other in the same Manner as  Truth  in every Subject tends to destroy  Falsehood  That is by  rational Conviction  The same Objection might be urged against the  Newtonian Philosophy  which destroyed the  Cartesian Fables  Or against the  Coper∣nican System  because the clumsy  Visions  of  Ptolemy and TychoBrahe  vanished before it The same might be urged against the Use∣fulness of the great  Source of Day  because it  dims  and  extinguishes  every inferior Lustre For the glimmering Lamps of human Know∣ledge lighted up by the Philosophers served indeed to conduct them as  a Light shining in a dark Place  but these must naturally be sunk in a superior Lustre when  the Sun of Righteousness should arise  The Gospel therefore is so far  unsociable  as to discredit  Error  and is incompatible with  this  as  Light  with  Darkness  But not so  unsociable  as to  compel  the erroneous As to the religious Debates then which Christi∣anity hath occasioned and the Wars and Massacres consequent upon them which the noble Writer so justly detests Christianity stands clear of the Charge till it can be shewn that it countenanceth the inhuman Principle of Intolerance And this it's bitterest Enemies can never do 'Tis true that if we be so irrational as to take our Idea of Christianity from the Representations of Enthusiasts and Bigots nothing can ap∣pear more absurd and mischevious As in like Manner if we consider the  Heavens  under the perplexed Revolutions and ma∣lignant Aspects of the old Astronomers and Astrologers nothing can be more unworthy either of divine Wisdom or Goodness But how can these false  Images  affect the noble  Simplicity  and  Benignity  of the  Gospel  or the  Solar System  To the  Works  and the  Word  of God we must repair for a true Idea of their undisguised Perfection And there we shall read their divine Author in  the brightest Characters of Wisdom and Goodness So far therefore is Christianity from encouraging Wars and Massacres on Account of a Difference in Opinion that it's divine Founder hath expressly warned his Followers against the Suggestions of this horrid Temper  Luke  ix  Nor can these fatal Con∣sequences ever arise among  Christians  till they have divested themselves of  Christian Charity  and  Ib  mistaken the very Principles of their Profession  BUT the noble Writer proceeds to still more bitter Invectives if possible against  Christianity  For he often insinuates that the Prospect of Happiness and Misery in another Life revealed in the Gospel tends to the Destruction of all  true Virtue  Wit and H  p ii §  In∣deed we cannot much Wonder that his Lordship should treat Christianity in this Manner when we consider what he hath thrown out against Religion in general in this Respect These Cavils have already been considered at large Whatever there∣fore he hath insinuated against our Religion in  particular  will naturally be refer'd to and effectually be refuted by these more  general  Observations  See above  Ess  ii §  However there are  two or three Passages on this Subject so re∣markable that they may seem to deserve a separate Consideration  AFTER having ridiculed and branded Christianity as destroying the  disinterested  Part of Virtue he tells us  "The  Jews  as well as Heathens were left to their Philo∣sophy to be instructed in the sublime Part of Virtue and induced by  Reason  to that which was never enjoyn'd them by Com∣mand No Premium or Penalty being inforced in these Cases the disinterested Part subsisted the Virtue was a free Choice and the Magnanimity of the Act was left intire  Wit and H  p ii §  "  HERE again the noble Writer hath got to his  Peculiarities  What other Title this Passage may deserve we shall soon discover For first supposing his Assertion true what he notes in the  Jewish  and  Heathen  Religions as an  Excellence  had certainly been a  Defect  For are not  Hottentots  wild  In∣dians  and  Arabs  "left to their Philoso∣phy to be induced by Reason to that which was never enjoined them by Command No Premium or Penalty  being inforced in these Cases the disin∣terested Part subsists the Virtue is a free Choice and the Magnanimity of the Act is left entire"  Thus the noble Writer would again debase us into Savages  See above  Essay  ii §  and rather than not disgrace Christianity would put the State of  Palestine Greece  and  Rome  on a Level with that of the  Cape of Good Hope Blindly  or shall we say  knowingly  disparaging what he elsewhere so justly ap∣plauds  "Laws Constitutions civil and RELIGIOUS Rites whatever  civilizes  or  polishes  rude Mankind  Moralists  Part i §  "  BUT in Fact neither the JEWS nor  civilized Heathens  were ever tainted with this  Phrenzy  They saw the Necessity of religious Belief and as they saw it's Ne∣cessity so they inforced it With Regard to the JEWS the noble Writer contradicts himself within the Compass of ten Lines For there he says  "their Religion taught no future State nor exhibited any Rewards or Punishments  besides such as were tem∣poral  "  This is the very Truth Here then he owns a  temporal Sanction  of Pre∣mium and Penalty  Reward  and  Punish∣ment  Yet in the Passage above cited and  which stands close by the other in the Ori∣ginal he says  "there was no Premium or Penalty inforced no Reward or Pun∣ishment"  His Lordship deals as  fairly  and  consistently  by the civilized Heathens For could he indeed have forgot the dis∣tinguished Rank which in the  Elysian Fields  was assigned to those who  fell  to save  their Country  Hic  Manus  ob PATRIAM pugnando vulner a passi  Omnibus his nivea cinguntur tempora vitta  Eneid  lib vi    AND now let the Impartial determine whether the noble Writer's Observation hath more of  Sagacity  or of  Truth  in it  BUT the Christian Doctrines relating to an  hereafter  are to undergo a yet severer  Inquisition  from the noble Writer They are to be tortured and  mangled  on the  Rack  of  Wit  shall I say or of  Buffoonry  "The Misfortune is we are seldom taught to comprehend this SELF by placing it in a distinct View from it's Representative or  Counterfeit  In our  holy  Religion which for the greatest Part is adapted to the very meanest Capacities 'tis not to be expected that a Speculation of this  Kind should be openly advanced 'Tis enough that we have Hints given us of a  nobler  SELF than that which is commonly supposed the Basis and Foundation of our Actions  SelfInterest  is there taken as it is vulgarly conceivedIn the same Man∣ner as the celestial Phaenomena are in the sacred Volumes generally treated ac∣cording to common Imagination and the then current System of Astronomy and natural Science so the moral Appear∣ances are in many Places preserved without Alteration according to  Vulgar Prejudice  Our real and genuine  Self  is sometimes supposed that  ambitious  one which is fond of Power and Glory some∣times that  childish  one which is taken with  vain Shew  and is to be invited to Obedience by Promise of  finer Habitations precious Stones  and  Metals  shining  Gar∣ments Crowns  and other such  dazling Beauties  by which another Earth or material City is represented  Solil  Part iii §  "  THIS Passage contains two insinuated Charges of a very different Nature The one is  true  but no  Objection  The other would indeed be an  Objection  but that it is  absolutely  groundless  'Tis true  "that our Religion is for the greatest Part adapted to the very meanest Capacities and that the celestial Phaenomena are in the sacred Volumes generally treated according to  common Imagination  " c  And would the noble Writer indeed have had it other∣wise Would he indeed have had them spoken of according to the Philosophical Construction of the Universe rather than the received Notions of Mankind With how little Reason we may soon be con∣vinced if we consider First that the  End  of  Revelation  was not to make Mankind Proficients in Philosophy since the Situa∣tion of the Generality can never admit it And had the Scriptures supposed this as indeed such a Conduct would have supposed it this very Circumstance had been an Argument of their Falsehood Secondly even Philosophers themselves tho' inti∣mately acquainted with the Construction of the Universe do still  descend  to the  Level of Mankind  when they speak of the Phae∣nomena of Nature The  Sun sets  and  rises  as it did three thousand Years ago The  Moon changes wains  is  new  and  old  The  Stars  are  in the Firmament  the  Sun  still  rules the Day  and the  Moon  the  Night  The Reason is evident Because  astronomi∣cal Discoveries  have not the least Influence on the  Practice of Mankind  Because altho' the  natural Appearances  of things are merely  relative  to the  Imagination only  yet they are for that very Reason necessary to be referred to as the  Imagination  is the great  universal Instrument  of  Life  and human  Action  AN Objection therefore to the Scriptures on this Account betrays either a gross  Misapprehension  of human Nature or the most unpardonable  Insincerity  yet we find Objections of this kind frequently urged as if because the sacred Penmen were im∣powered by God to reveal to us a certain Measure of  religious  and  moral  Truth suited to our present State they must therefore be endued with  Omniscience  in order to make all Men not only  good Subjects  but good  Astronomers  too  BUT tho' it were  Folly  to object against the  sacred Penmen  because they appear not to have been  omniscient  yet I cannot con∣clude this Argument without producing a remarkable Instance wherein their very  Ig∣norance  of these  speculative  and  unnecessary  Truths  becomes a convincing Proof of their VERACITY A Circumstance which much more nearly concerns us We read in the Book of  Joshua  "And he said in the Sight of  Israel  SUN stay thou in  Gibeon  and  thou  MOON in the Valley of  Ajalon  And the  Sun abode  and THE MOON STOOD STILLand hasted not to go down for a whole Day  Joshua  x  "  Here the  standing still  of these Luminaries is related in such a Manner as concurs with the com∣mon Appearances of things and yet con∣sists with the best Discoveries in Astronomy tho' unknown to the Writer For we are now assured that if  the Sun stood still  it must have been by suspending the diurnal Rotation of the Earth The  standing still of the Moon  was therefore the  necessary Consequence  This the Writer appears not to have known Yet he relates the  Fact  tho' it was of no Importance with Regard to that Event for which the Miracle was wrought It is therefore of singular Force in proving the  Veracity of the Writer  because had it not been true in Fact it is  a Circumstance which could never have occurr'd to him  THE noble Writer's other Charge re∣lating to the  moral Representations  of the  Scriptures would indeed be of Weight if it were founded in Truth But so far from this that he hath utterly  reversed  the Fact For in Reality these  sensible  Representa∣tions of  visible  Beauty and Glory are only  occasionally  or  accidentally  hinted while the whole  Weight  and  Energy  of the  Gospel  is employed in inforcing the Idea of  moral Perfection  of our  nobler  SELF of  SelfInterest  in the  higher  Sense of the Necessity of extirpating every meaner Passion and cherishing the great one of  un∣bounded Love  as the necessary and only Discipline that can qualify us for future Happiness 'Tis evident that the noble Writer lays the principal Stress of his Charge on the  Apocalypse  a Work in it's whole Turn  strictly allegorical  and therefore necessarily conversant in  Imagery  and  visible Representation  To this he hath most  perversly  added a figurative Expression of St PAUL who writing to a People among whom the  PrizeRaces  prevailed represents the Christian  Progress  as a  Contest  of this Kind and shews it's Superiority over the Former  "because saith he they labour to obtain a  corruptible  but we an  incorruptible Crown  "  In the mean  Time he hath omitted the many  Discourses Parables Maxims  of our Saviour in which he perpetually exhorts his Disciples to en∣deavour after unfeigned Virtue and univer∣sal Benevolence as the only Means that can bring them to future  Perfection  He hath forgot too the repeated Exhortations of St PAUL who sets CHARITY so high above every other Gift or Possession and adds the Reason of it's Preheminence  "because it shall never fail"  'Tis true indeed as the noble Writer observes with what In∣tention 'tis no difficult Matter to determine  "that our holy Religion is for the greatest Part adapted to the very meanest Capa∣cities"  We may add  "and to the very worst of Dispositions too"  And 'tis one of it's chief Glories that it is so There∣fore we find it inforcing  every Motive  that can work on  every Mind  Which must surely be acknowledged as the Character of  the Religion  that should come from him  who knew what was in Man  But if the noble Writer would further insinuate that the Idea of future Happiness ought to be  confined  to that of  virtuous  Enjoyment whereas the  Christian  Religion doth not so  confine  it we have already seen that from  the Nature of things this Refinement is  visionary  and  groundless  See above  Essay  ii §  "  WE now come to the Examination of a Passage more  extraordinary  and  original  than any yet produced The noble Writer tells us  "I could be almost tempted to think that the true Reason why some of the most  heroic Virtues  have so little Notice taken of them in our  holy Religion  is because there would have been no Room left for  Disinterestedness  had they been entitled to a Share of that infinite Reward which Providence has  by Revelation  assigned to other Duties  Private Friendship  and  Zeal  for the  Public  and  our Country  are Virtues purely  voluntary  in a  Christian  They are no essential  Parts  of his  Charity  He is not so tied to the Affairs of  this Life  nor is he obliged to enter into such Engagements with this  lower World  as are of  no Help  to him in acquiring a  better  His  Conversation  is in  Heaven  Nor has he Occasion for such  supernumerary Cares  and Embarrassments here on Earth as may  obstruct his Way  thither or retard him in the careful Task of working out his own Salvation  Wit and H  Part ii §  "  WE have already seen that the real Nature of Virtue consists  "in procuring or promoting the greatest public Happi∣ness"  And that this Truth is often  occasionally  acknowledged by Lord  Shaftes∣bury  himself Consequently the  highest  or most  heroic Virtue  is that which tends to  accomplish  this great  End  Nor can any  pretended  Virtue be either  great  or  heroic  that tends to  obstruct  or  destroy it  ON this plain Principle selfevident to unbyassed  Reason  let us examine the Passage now before us And first as to  private Friendship  which the noble Writer says  "is a Virtue purely voluntary in a Chris∣tian"  Let us consider how far it may be regarded as a Virtue  at all  Now on strict Enquiry we shall find that the ex∣treme Degree of Friendship recommended and applauded by the Ancients and here pa∣tronized by the noble Author is essentially  repugnant  to  true Virtue  In  Friendship  they placed the  Chief Happiness  And if this consists in the supreme Love of  one  it must needs  diminish  if not  extinguish  the Love of  all  because our chief or whole  Atten∣tion  must be  employed  our every  View  and  Design centered  in giving Pleasure or  procuring  Happiness  to one  Individual  And this is the very fairest Light it can be view'd in  FOR we shall further see how little it generally partakes of the Nature of true Virtue if we consider whence it hath it's Rise This is universally allowed to be  "a Similarity of  Disposition Will  and  Manners  "  This Circumstance demon∣strates that in general it must be  contrary  to Virtue For hence the  general  Good must be often sacrificed to gratify the Will of  one  Of this dreadsul Effect Instances might be produced almost innumerable Let one suffice  "Between TIBERIUS GRACCHUS and C BLOSIUS a  dear and perfect Friendship  subsisted The latter being seized for aiding the former in his Conspiracy was brought before the  Con∣suls  He pleaded his Friendship to GRAC∣CHUS in Excuse for his Crime"  He was then asked  "What suppose he had bid you  fire the Capitol  would you have done it"  To this he boldly replied  "He never would have laid me under such a Necessity but if he had  I would have obey'd him  Cic  Laelius  "  A  thorough Friend  sure But a  vile Citizen  notwithstanding the  artful Gloss of an ingenious Modern who hath attempted to make out the Innocence of his Intentions  See Montaigne's  Essay  on this Subject    'TIS true the Advocates for this  Attach∣ment  sometimes assert that it cannot consist but with  Virtue  That it  ought not  is cer∣tain That it  cannot  or  doth not  is a ground∣less Conceit unless they chuse to make this Circumstance a Part of the Definition which were idle Sophistry But if by Friend∣ship be meant what indeed is always meant  "a violent Love and Attachment to another on Account of a Similarity of Manners"  this 'tis certain hath often nay most com∣monly subsisted without Virtue Among  Savages Robbers Heroes  and  Banditti  In LUCIAN's Tract on Friendship we find that out of Twelve notable Instances al∣ledged near half the Number were sup∣ported at the Expence of  Justice  or  Huma∣nity  either by the Commission of Rapine Adultery or Murder or by aiding the Es∣cape of those who ought to have suffered for these enormous Crimes Will any one alledge the Emperor TIBERIUS or his Fa∣vourite SEJANUS as Patterns of Virtue Yet their Friendship was so remarkable  that in Honour of it Altars were dedicated to  Friendship  by a  senatorial Decree  Nay some of the applauded Instances appealed to by the noble Author in his Comment on this Passage are even notorious in this Re∣spect Such were THESEUS and PIRI∣THOUS equally remarkable for  Friendship Rapes  and  Plunder  And such Instances may still be found in every  savage  Country where the strongest Friendships are com∣monly formed Where Men thus  leagued  go upon bold Adventures and hazard and give up Life for each other without Reluc∣tance while they  ravish  their Neighbours  Wives  and  carry off  their  Cattle  With as little Reason can it be urged that Friendships in general are  disinterested  so as to aspire to the Name of  Merit  For  Merit  if it exists can only arise from  Vir∣tue  And Virtue we have seen doth not essentially belong to Friendship Nay in LUCIAN's Tract 'tis warmly debated be∣tween the contending Parties whether  Af∣fection  or  private Advantage  hath a more considerable Share in this applauded  Union  Indeed the  civilized  and haughty  Greek  stands upon the Punctilio of  Honour  and piques himself on the Notion of  Disinterest  But the  undisguised Scythian  insists that mu∣tual  Advantage and Support  are the ruling  Motives  However in Conclusion they fairly agree in comparing a set of fast Friends to GERYON with  three Heads  and  six Hands  enabled thro' this Increase of Strength to overturn all Opposition  Luciani  Toxaris  But suppose  Affection  the ruling Principle as unquestionably it often is where is the  Merit  while  confined  to  one  Person Nay it must rather lean towards  Demerit  be∣cause it appears 'tis rather  dangerous  than  favourable  to  public Affection  and  Virtue  'Tis evident then that the  friendly Affection  is no more  meritorious  than the  conjugal paternal  or  filial Affection  which being of a  contracted  Nature are often consistent with great Baseness of Mind and destructive of a more enlarged Benevolence  Thus a Writer of distinguished Abilities  "Many Instances occur in History and daily Experience of Men not ashamed to commit base and selfish Enor∣mities who have retained a Tenderness for their Posterity by the strong and generous Instinct of Na∣ture The Story of  Licinius Macer  who was Father to  Calvus  the great Orator is very remarkable as related by a Roman Annalist Having gone thro' the Office of Praetor and governed a Province he was accused upon returning Home of Extortion and Abuses of his Power The very Morning of his Tryal he strangled himself after having sent Word to  Cicero  who was preparing to plead against him that being determined to put an End to his Life before Sentence tho' the Penalty did not extend to taking it away the Prosecution could not go on and his Fortune would be saved to the Benefit of his Son"  Considerations on the Law of Forfeiture  p  And  what Degree of  Merit  or  Disinterest  there is in Regards of this Nature when sepa∣rate from more extensive ones we may learn from the noble Writer himself who says  "there is a  Selfishness  in the Love that is paid to a  Wife  and in the Attendance on a  Family  and all the little Affairs of it which had I my full Scope of Action in the Public I should hardly have sub∣mitted to  Ld S's  Let to Mr Molesworth  Let ix  "  SO far then is clear That  Friendship  or  "a violent Affection founded on a Simila∣rity of Disposition and Manners"  is more likely to produce  Vice  than  Virtue  as it tends to fix such Habits of Mind as must lessen our Concern for the  general Good  And in Fact every one's Experience will point out to him Numbers of Men natu∣rally benevolent  to all  but so strongly by∣assed and  drawn in  by  particular  Attach∣ments  that their  Regards  and  Beneficence  are centered wholly on a  select Few  while the rest of Mankind pass unheeded and un∣assisted and have no Share in their Bene∣volence further than what  SelfDeceit  throws out in  unmeaning Wishes  for their Welfare  'TIS no less evident that thro' the natu∣ral Advantages of this partial Alliance Mankind must ever be prone to embrace it in Exclusion of more extensive Affections where no such Advantages can follow It would therefore have been a  Defect  in the  Christian  Religion to have enjoined or even recommended it in this Extreme Ac∣cordingly we find in the Gospel every At∣tachment of this Kind however natural and alluring it may be set very little above the  lowest Selfishness  and justly represented as entirely consistent with it  "If ye do do good to them which do good to you what thank have ye Do not the Publi∣cans even the same  Mat  v    BESIDES there is something so extraor∣dinary in the noble Writer's Scheme of  "enjoying Friendship"  as sufficiently ex∣poseth it's own Weakness Friendship his  Lordship allows can only arise  "from a Consent and Harmony of Minds  In the Note  "  How then could Christianity have  enjoyned  us the Practice of this  supposed  Virtue What must it have  enjoyned  us Why to  go in Quest  of a  Mind  resembling our own It might with equal Propriety have enjoyned us to go in Quest of a  Face  resembling our own And with as much Reason for all the Pur∣poses of  true Virtue  BUT if by  Friendship  be meant what indeed is  not  generally meant  "A parti∣cular Love and Esteem for the virtuous or worthy"  in which Sense alone it can have any Tendency to produce true Virtue then we may justly affirm that it is recommend∣ed in the Gospel both by  Example  and by  Precept  It is naturally involved in that allcomprehensive Command of  universal Charity  For tho' many have been zealous in their Friendships while they were in∣sensible to publick Affection yet such is the Temperament of human Nature that no Instance was ever known of a Man zealous for the Happiness  of all  yet remiss in or incapable of a  true Friendship  for  the worthy  It is recommended by St PAUL  who says that  "peradventure for a  good Man  one would even  dare to die  "  It is recommended by our Saviour's Example who selected a beloved Disciple as his bosom  Friend  whose Writings are the overflow∣ings of a Heart filled with the purest and most unbounded Love  St  John  " Above all it is recommended by our Saviour in that noble and divine Passage  "Who is my Mother or my Brethren Even  he that doth the Will of my Father  which is in Heaven he is my  Brother  and  Sister  and  Mother  Matt  xii  "  SO much for the spurious Virtue of  pri∣vate Friendship  Let us next consider the noble Writer's Charge against  Christianity  on Account of it's not enjoyning  "a Zeal for the  Public  and our Country"  For this too it seems  "is a Virtue purely  vo∣luntary in a Christian  "  Now all the Ab∣surdities which load his Charge with Re∣gard to  Friendship  fall with equal Weight on this groundless Imputation For if by  "Zeal for the Publick and our "Country"  be meant a Zeal that is inconsistent with the Rights and common Welfare of Man∣kind 'tis so far from being a  Virtue  that as in the case of  Friendship  it is really a  Crime  because it tends to produce the most fatal Consequences And an Army of victorious Warriors returning triumphant on this vile Principle however graced with the flattering Title of  Heroes  and Ensigns of  Glory  are in Truth no better than a Band of  publick Robbers  or as our  great Poet  a Christian and a Lover of Mankind finely expresseth it  An impious Crew  Of Men conspiring to uphold their State  By worse than hostile Deeds violating the Ends  For which our Country is a Name so dear  Sampson Agonistes    Now 'tis evident beyond a Doubt that at the Time when our Saviour appeared this destructive  Partiality  this avowed Conspi∣racy against the common Rights of Man∣kind was universally prevalent among the most civilized Nations The JEWS were not exempted from this common Excess  "  Inter ipsos Fides obstinata adversus alios hostile Odium  "  was their Character among the Heathens The  Greeks  and  Romans  committed and boasted of the most cruel Enormities conquered and inslaved inno∣cent Nations plundered Cities and laid  waste Kingdoms thro' this absurd and  im∣pious Love  of their  Country  a Principle no better in many of it's Consequences than the most horrid and accursed  Bigotry  It had therefore been an essential Defect nay rather a mischievous Absurdity in the Christian Religion to have enjoyned en∣couraged or countenanced a Partiality un∣just in itself to which from Views of private Advantage Mankind must ever be prone and which at the Time when Christianity began to spread was indeed the reigning and  predominant Error  BUT if by  "Zeal for the Publick and Love of our Country"  be meant such a Regard to it's Welfare as shall induce us to sacrifice every View of private Interest for it's Accomplishment yet still  in Subordi∣nation  to the  greater Law  of  universal Justice  this is naturally nay necessarily in∣volved in the Law of  universal Charity  The noble Writer indeed affirms  "it is no essen∣tial Part of the Christian's Charity"  On the contrary it is a  chief Part  of the Chris∣tian's Charity It comes nobly recommend∣ed by the Examples of JESUS and St PAUL The one wept over the approaching Deso∣lation of his Country The other declared  his Willingness to be cut off from the Chris∣tian Community if by this Means he might save his Countrymen And that it necessa∣rily ariseth from the Principle of universal Love will be evident if we consider the  Nature  and  Situation  of  Man  His  Nature  is such that he inevitably contracts the  strongest  Affection for those with whom he converseth most  intimately  and whose  Man∣ners  and  Relations civil  and  religious  are most nearly connected with  his own  His  Situa∣tion  is such that he seldom hath an Oppor∣tunity of doing good Offices to any Society of Men save only those of his  own Country  all others being naturally removed beyond the narrow Sphere of private Beneficence Hence the great Precept of universal Charity doth essentially involve  "a Zeal for the Publick and Love of our Country"  At once it  curbs  the  Exorbitance  of this natu∣ral Partiality and  carries  it to it's full  Per∣fection  THE Necessity of this great  Regulating  Principle will further appear if we consi∣der that with Regard to the Conduct of separate States and Kingdoms towards each other no Sanctions of human Law can ever take place In this respect all Nations must ever be in a State of Nature There was  therefore a more particular Necessity on this Account of regulating their Conduct towards each other by the great Law of  universal Charity  IT may seem strange that the noble Writer should be ignorant of these Truths But after the Imputations he hath here thrown on  Christianity  it will surely appear  more strange  that he was  not ignorant  of them And that these bitter Sarcasms were thrown out against the clear Convictions of his own Mind Yet nothing is more evi∣dent as will now appear That he un∣derstood the Nature of  Christian Charity  is indisputable He defines it and properly in the Note annexed to the Passage here re∣fer'd to In another Place he calls it  "the Principle of  Love  the greatest Principle of our Religion  Moralists  Part ii §  "  In a following Para∣graph he calls it  "that divine Love which our Religion teaches  Ib  "  But what is of all  most remarkable  he sets it under the new and whimsical Denominations of  GoodNature  and  Friendship to Mankind  far above  private  Friendship and Love of our  Country  Take the Passages as they lie in the noble Writer  "Can any  Friendship  be so  heroic  as that towards  Mankind  or  particular  Friendship well subsist without such an enlarged Affection  Ib §  "  Again  "  Theocles  had almost convinced me that to be a Friend to any one in particular 'twas necessary first to be a Friend to Man∣kind  Ib §  "  Lastly and above all  "And can your  Country  and what is  more your  KIND require less Kindness from you or deserve less to be consider'd than even  one  of these  ChanceCreaturesO Phi∣locles  how little do you know the Extent and Power of  GoodNature  and to what an  heroic Pitch  a Soul may  rise  which knows the thorow Force of it  and distri∣buting it rightly  frames in itself an  equal just  and  universal Friendship  Ib §  "  Here then we see the former Paragraph utterly reversed For  "  universal Love  is now the only  heroic  Principle"  And  "  private Friendship  and the Love of  our Country  are only commendable as they make  subordinate Parts  of it"  TO this astonishing and wilful Perver∣sion of the Moral Principles of  Christianity  we may add the subsequent Part of the same invenomed Paragraph For he pro∣ceeds  to  insinuate  as if  Christian Charity  were no  active  Principle but such as leads it's Proselytes to a State of mere  Contempla∣tion  and  Inaction  without Regard to  social  Life and the Affairs of this  lower World  We may defy the noble Writer's most zealous Admirers to find any other rational Con∣struction for the following Passage  "The Christian he says is not obliged to en∣ter into such  Engagements  with this  lower World  as are of no Help to him in ac∣quiring  a better His Conversation  is  in Heaven  Nor has he Occasion for such  supernumerary Cares  and  Embarrassments  here on Earth as may  obstruct his Way  thither or  retard  him in the  careful Task  of working out  his own Salvation  "  Un∣exampled Prevarication thrown out a∣gainst that Religion which enjoyns an  active  Virtue a  Regard  to the  present  Happiness of Man in  every possible Relation  as the on∣ly Way to obtain Felicity hereafter Against that Religion whose  Founder  did not  idly harangue  in a  Closet  upon  Beauty Virtue  and  Decorum  amidst the  Indolence  and  Pride  of Life but  practised  the Divine  Truths  he  taught  and  "  went about doing Good  "  a∣mongst  the meanest and most despised of his Fellow Citizens  TO be unmoved on this Occasion were  Stupidity  not to confess it  Cowardice Er∣ror  should be exposed with  Calmness  but  Dishonesty  merits our Abhorrence  YET from these Cavils tho' groundless and Misrepresentations tho'  voluntary  we may draw an Observation which highly re∣commends  Christianity  We may hence see the superior Excellence and Dignity of it's moral Precepts above the most  applaud∣ed  among the Heathen And how nobly by one great Principle it rectifies every lit∣tle Partiality to which the human Heart is subject For this is clear that in one Age or Nation  Friendship  hath been  idolized  as the supreme Virtue in another  Hospitali∣ty  Indeed the noble Writer pursuing the same kind Intention to Christianity pretends that the Law of  Hospitality  or  Regard  to  Strangers  among the  anci∣ent Heathens  was  equivalent  nay he gives a very dis∣ingenious Suggestion as if it was far  superior  to  Christian Charity  "Such says he was ancient  Hea∣then Charity  and pious Duty towards the whole of Mankind both those of different Nations  and diffe∣rent Worships  "  Misc  iii c  in the Notes  For Instances of this he is forced to go back as far as  Ho∣mer  who indeed hath given us some fine Pictures of ancient Manners of this kind in his  Odyssey  The noble Writer might have found others in no Respect inferior in the Old Testament recorded long before  universal Charity  was ever thought of in the Stories of  Abraham  and  Lot  The Truth is the  Guest  or  Stranger  was held  sacred  because he was under the  Protection  of his  Host  It was therefore deemed  crimi∣nal  to violate a  Trust  thus  reposed  But it happens unfortunately for his Lordship's Argument that in these Old Times  Rapine  and  Plunder  were as much in Vogue as either  Friendship  or  Hospitality  and equally creditable These  phantom  Appearances of  Virtue  are still to be seen in the  Arabian Deserts  as frequently as ever If a Traveller comes to the Door of a wild  Arab's  Tent at Night he is received with so bound∣less an  Hospitality  that the  Host  would expose himself his Wife and Children to certain Destruction to save the Life of his  Guest  Had this  hospitable Savage  met the Traveller in the Deserts at Noon he would have  strip'd  him to the Skin and on the least Resistance laid him  dead at his Feet  And this was the true Extent of the noble Writer's boasted  Heathen Cha∣rity  in a Third the Love of our  Country  in a Fourth enthusiastic  Contemplation  in a Fifth the  Austerities  of the Hermit in a Sixth the  external Practice  of Religion in a Seventh which is the  fashionable  Pe∣culiarity of  our own  Times  occasional Acts  of Humanity and Compassion while the more  extensive  and  Publick  Views of Bene∣ficence are  neglected  or even  derided  How different how superior is the great Chris∣tian Principle of  universal Love  Which rising gradually by a Progress thro' all the  less enlarged Affections towards Parents Children Friends Country and spreading till it embraceth all Mankind and every Creature that hath Life forms that  perfect Virtue  in which human Weakness is most prone to be  defective  and which implies and includes every moral Perfection  Chris∣tianity  alone hath  kindled  in the Heart of Man this  vital  Principle which  beaming  there as from a  Center  like the great  Foun∣tain  of  Light  and  Life  that sustains and chears the attendant Planets renders it's Proselytes indeed  "  burning and shining Lights  "  shedding their  kindly Influence  on all around them in that just  Proportion  which their  respective Distances  may de∣mand  SECTION VII  THE preceding Remarks may suffici∣ently obviate every Cavil of the noble Writ∣er against the  essential  Parts of  Christianity  But as his Lordship hath casually intersper∣sed several Random Insinuations we must be content to receive them as they happen to appear since they are of that disjointed Kind as to be incapable of Connection  IN a marginal Note he gives an Account of the Migration of the  Israelites  from  Egypt  under the Conduct of MOSES He thinks proper to reject the clear Account which the  Jewish Legislator  himself gives  "That they departed in order to worship the true God"  and preposterously pre∣fers what TACITUS and JUSTIN have said on that Subject who affirm indeed but without Proof  "that the  Jews  were driven out of  Egypt  on Account of their  Lepro∣sy  Misc  ii c Notes  "  This Partiality might of itself appear  mysterious  enough when we consider the particular and consistent Account given us by the very Leader of the Expedition For what should we think of the Man who should prefer the random Conjectures of an ignorant Modern to XENOPHON's  Retreat  or CAESAR's  Commentaries  But the noble Writer's Partiality will appear still more un∣accountable if we consider the following Passage of STRABO a Writer as much be∣yond TACITUS in Candour as beyond JUSTIN if indeed JUSTIN and not TRO∣GUS POMPEIUS be answerable for this Slan∣der in true Judgement This Author STRABO second to none in Antiquity  speaks thus  "MOSES an  Egyptian  Priest retreated along with a number of  religious Followers  For he affirmed and taught that the  Egyptians  were mistaken who imaged the Deity under the Forms of the BruteCreation as likewise the  Libyans  and  Greeks  who represented the  Gods  under the  human Shape  He held that alone to be  God  which comprehends eve∣ry living Creature the Earth and Sea which is called  Heaven  the  World  or the  universal Nature  whose  Image  who that is in his right Mind would dare to form out of any  earthly  Materials  Re∣jecting  therefore all use of  Images  he de∣termined to dedicate to him a Temple worthy of his Nature and worship him without ImagesOn this Principle he persuaded and brought over many  well∣disposed  Men and led them forth into that Country  where now  Jerusalem  is built  Strabo xvi  "  A noble Testimony sure from  a Heathen Writer  Less  he could not say if he was well informed and unless he had embraced the  Jewish  Religion he could not have said  more  THERE is another Passage  Misc  v c which discovers somewhat of unfair dealing in the noble Writer In the Margin he prettily enough criticizes the Preface to St LUKE's Gospel But in the Text he hath paraphrased the Evangelist's Expression in a Manner so distant from any thing St LUKE either wrote or  meant  as must not a little astonish every candid Reader St LUKE says  "  It seemed good  to him to write in Or∣der the Things that he knew"  To which the noble Writer adds  "As there were many it seems long afterwards who did and undertook accordingly to write in Order and  as seemed good to them c  "  What shall we say of the noble Writer on this Occasion Why this only  "That  inasmuch as it  seemed good to him  to inter∣pret this Preface of St LUKE he therefore thought himself at Liberty to interpret it  as it seemed good to him  "  THERE are three more Subjects which his Lordship hath thought fit to represent in the Manner which  seemed good to him  These are first the divine Foreknowledge communicated to JOSEPH in the Interpreta∣tion of PHARAOH's Dreams Secondly the Rise of  Bigotry  or religious  Intolerance  and  Persecution  Thirdly and principal∣ly The Relation which the  Jewish  Institu∣tions bear to the  Egyptian  See  Misc  ii c  In all these the noble Writer hath employed every Art of  Insinuation  and  Address  that he might throw an Odium on the  Mosaic  Dispensati∣on These Passages might well merit a particular Consideration had I not been happily prevented by my most learned Friend who hath fully exposed their Weakness in that inestimable Treasure of all true Knowledge  The divine Legation of  MOSES Thither the Reader is reserr'd where he will find these Questions treated  with that  Reach  and  Mastery  so peculiar to the Author of that great Work  With Relation to the first of these Points see the  Div Leg  Vol ii p For the second see  ib  Book ii § For the third see Book iv § passim    IT may now be necessary to examine the third Chapter of the noble Writer's second Miscellany where he makes it his Pretence  "to prove the Force of  Humour  in Religion"  Of which it may be said that it is the truest Piece of  RandomWork  the most genuine  Farce  that is perhaps to be met with in any Writer of whatever Age or Nation He  divides  it as every  Farce  ought to be  divid∣ed  into three  Acts  In its Progress we are carry'd into a very  FairyLand  of  Thought  if not more properly a  confused Chaos  For first he sets about with great Solemnity to prove  "that  Wit and Humour  are corroborative of Religion and promotive of true Faith"  To prove this a Story is told by which it appears that  not Wit and Humour  but  good Humour  or  Easiness of Temper  is thus  corroborative  and  promotive  Then in Conclusion  Wit and Humour  come in again to overturn all that hath been done and shew that  good Humour  hath suf∣fered itself to be ridiculously  imposed upon  THO' it doth not appear that our mo∣dern Advocates for  Wit and Humour  are so  nearly interested  in their Fate as they seem to  think  themselves yet it must be owned their Generosity is so much the more to be applauded in thus  pleading  the Cause of  Clients  who  never employed them  Howe∣ver taking for granted what seems to be the real Foundation of their Writings on this Subject  "that  talking  in Praise of  Wit and Humour  is a Proof of their being  possessed  of them and that consequently they are  Parties in the Cause  "  I shall not  envy  the noble Writer  any Man's Ad∣miration  who may think proper to esteem him a  Wit  on account of the  grotesque  Ap∣pearances he assumes throughout this pre∣sent  Miscellany  'Tis my Intention only to convince the plain Reader that this  supposed Wit  is by no means  Philosophical  THE first  Head  therefore he tells us is  "to make it appear that Wit and Humour are corroborative of Religion and promo∣tive of true Faith"  To this Purpose he tires us with a Story not the most elegant∣ly plann'd in my Apprehension of a  "Club of  merry  Gentlemen who in a travelling Expedition meeting with sorry Roads and  worse Fare laugh'd themselves into a Belief that both Roads Accommodations and Cookery were perfectly good"  What follows is the Moral or Application of this curious Conceit  "Had I to deal with a malicious Reader he might per∣haps pretend to infer from this Story of my travelling Friends that I intended to represent it as an easy Matter for Peo∣ple to persuade themselves into what Opinion or Belief they pleased"  NOW without troubling ourselves to en∣quire how far this Story is a Proof of the noble Writer's fundamental Maxim  "That Ridicule is a Test of Truth"  let us pro∣ceed to the intended  Moral  which seems evidently calculated to throw a false Light on  religious Belief  by representing it as the mere Effect of  Prejudice SelfImposition  and  Deceit  To rescue it therefore from this insinuated Calumny we need not  deny  but  insist  that the Passions false Interests and Prejudices of Mankind must indeed for ever hang as a Byass upon their Opinions But it must be farther observed too that these Passions and false Interests will at least as often prejudice them  against  Religion as  in its Favour  'Tis true there are Preju∣dices  in Favour of Religion arising from  Education  but there are Prejudices against it too arising from  vicious Passions  Some are  sanguine  in their  Hopes  and hence while their Conduct is virtuous  wish  and therefore  believe  Religion to be  true  O∣thers are  sanguine  in their  Hopes  but  aban∣doned  in their Conduct and therefore  live  themselves into a Belief that Religon is  false  Some thro' a Dread of Annihilation per∣suade themselves beyond the Strength of Evidence Others thro' the Prevalence of a suspicious cast of Mind reject even what is probable Thus Passions and Prejudices work powerfully indeed but they work both  for  and  against Religion  It should seem then that the noble Writer's Moral which he aims at  Religion  may with equal Force be apply'd to  Infidelity  For it is but supposing a Man given up to  Vanity  or  Vice  and we shall soon  "see him enter into such a Plot as this against his own Under∣standing and endeavour by all possible Means to persuade both himself and o∣thers of what he thinks  convenient  and  useful  to DISBELIEVE"  'Tis idle there∣fore to insist on the Prejudices either  for  or  against  Religion they will both naturally  arise and it is the Part of Reason to con∣troul them But we may safely leave it to any one's Determination which Temper of Mind is the most  amiable  that which en∣tertains Prejudices  in Favour  of  Religion  or  against it  THE noble Writer proceeds to his  second  Head but seems at the same time consci∣ous how little it was to any good Purpose However in Failure of  Truth  and  Method  he again hath recourse to what he seems to think  Wit and Humour  and which for aught I know may pass for such among his Admirers  "However says he lest I should be charged for being worse than my Word I shall endeavour to satisfy my Reader by pursuing my Method pro∣posed if peradventure he can call to Mind what that Method was Or if he cannot the Matter is not so very impor∣tant but that he may safely pursue his Reading without further Trouble"  BUT tho' it was prudently done in the noble Writer to throw the Subject of his  second  Head into  Shades  yet for the Sake of Truth we must drag it into  Light  It was therefore to prove  "That  Wit and Hu∣mour  are used as the proper Means of  promoting true Faith by the holy Foun∣ders of Religion"  But when we come to the Point for  Wit and Humour  by Vir∣tue of a certain Dexterity of Hand the Reader is again unexpectedly presented with  good Humour  in their Stead This it will be said is nimble dealing but what of that so long as it may tend to disgrace  Christianity  and its  Founder  The noble Writer's Application therefore is still more Extraordinary  "The Affection and Love which procures a true Adherence to the new religious Foundation must depend either on a real or  counterfeit Goodness  in the  religious Founder  Whatever  ambitious Spirit  may  inspire him  whatever  savage Zeal  or  persecuting Principle  may lie  in Reserve  roady to disclose itself when Au∣thority and Power is once obtained the  first Scene  of  Doctrine  however fails not to present us with the agreeable Views of  Joy Love Meakness Gentleness  and  Moderation  "  To speak my inmost Sen∣timents of this Passage it is of too black a Nature to deserve a Reply There are certain Degrees of  Calumny  so  flagrant  as injured Truth disdains to answer and this is of the Kind On this Occasion there∣fore  we shall leave the noble Writer to the Reflections of every  honest Man  in Con∣formity to the Example of that blessed Per∣son  "  who when he was reviled reviled not again  See above § of this  Essay  p  "  THE next Circumstance in holy Writ that falls under his Lordship's Animadver∣sion is what he calls  "The famous  Entry  or  high Dance  perform'd by DAVID in the Procession of the sacred Coffer"  In which he hath again represented Things  as it seemed good to him  Here by confound∣ing  ancient  with  modern Manners  in such a Way as is quite unworthy of his Charac∣ter and suited only to the Genius of a  Coffeehouse  Freethinker he hath endeavour∣ed to bring down the  solemn Procession  of a grand  religious Festival  to a Level with the Merriments of an Apish  DancingMaster  This Representation may very probably pass current among many of his Admirers so that it had been necessary to set the Mat∣ter in its true Light but that here too I am happily prevented by a judicious Wri∣ter who hath done all imaginable Justice to the Argument and effectually ex∣posed  the noble Writer's Weakness and In∣sincerity  See Dr Leland's  Answer to the Moral Philosopher  p c    HIS Lordship now proceeds to the Story of the Prophet JONAH which he hath bur∣lesqued and turned to Farce with that De∣licacy so peculiar to himself The Story itself is indeed authenticated by our SAVI∣OUR's mention of it as emblematical of his own Death and Resurrection Its Moral is excellent being an illustrious Display of the divine Mercy to penitent and returning Sinners exemplify'd in GOD's remitting the Punishment denounced and sparing a de∣voted City on its sincere Repentance as al∣so of the Frailty and Imperfection of the best of Men set forth in the Prophet's Be∣haviour on the Occasion To this we may add  "the Propriety of the Miracle record∣ed"  which was itself an extraordinary and most awakening  "Instance of Punishment  inflicted on Disobedience  and  remitted on Repentance  "  and therefore bearing a  strong Relation  to the  Event  for which it was wrought being peculiarly  adapted  when made known to the  Ninevites  to in∣duce  them to hearken to the Prophet's Preaching to  believe  what he  denounced  and  promised  and rouze them at once into a  Fear  of GOD's  Justice  and a  Reliance  on his  Mercy  SUCH then being the real Nature of the Fact the Secret of the noble Writer's po∣lite Representation lies in his burlesquing the Circumstances of the  supposed Dialogue  between GOD and the Prophet an easy Task for any one who is disingenuous or ignorant enough to represent as strictly  litteral  what is evidently  parabolical  ac∣cording to the frequent and known Manner of  Composition  in the earliest Ages  See the  Div Leg  Vol ii where a full Account is given of the Origin and Progress of this kind of Writ∣ing  This his Lordship seems to have been aware of  "Whatsoever of this Kind may be  allego∣rically  understood or in the Way of  Pa∣rable  or  Fable  c"  Now had he treat∣ed the Scripture Story with the same Can∣dour which he affords to other ancient Writers he would not have abused this Passage in so unworthy a Manner A Writer of no Abilities if provided only with a suf∣ficient Quantity of Spleen and false Con∣ceit  might easily ridicule his favourite Piece "The Judgment of HERCULES" And to a raw Imagination disgrace that instructive Fable by burlesquing the supposed Confe∣rence between the  Goddesses  and the  Heroe  VIRGIL hath in Fact been so served And if Works of mere Invention and of the he∣roic Kind studiously contrived to avoid every thing low obscure or equivocal are subject to this Abuse can we wonder if the succinct History of an ancient Fact recording the Dispensations of Providence a Matter very obscure in itself and relative to ancient Manners so distant from our own should be liable to the false and dishonest Lights of Buffoonry We may further ob∣serve that the noble Writer's Ridicule some∣times falls on divine Providence itself  "His  Tutor had good Eyes  and a  long Reach  he  overtook  the Renegade at Sea c"  Could an  Epicurean  have used more inde∣cent Language  His Lordship goes on to ridicule  "the  Descriptions Narrations Expressions  and  Phrases  "  of holy Scripture But these we shall pass over at present as they will de∣serve a separate Consideration He touches once more on the  Patriarch  ABRAHAM  and they who are curious enough to look for the Objection may find a full Answer to it in the Place here referred to  Div Leg  Vol ii p    THE next and only remaining Circum∣stance worthy of Notice in this Miscellany is a  pretended Translation  from PLUTARCH In which the noble Writer deals as honour∣ably by that Author as before by GORGIAS or ARISTOTLE  See above  Essay  i § ix  But here too I am pre∣vented by the learned PHILELEUTHERUS LIPSIENSIS However as his Lordship's Conduct is  remarkable  on this Occasion it may not be improper to exhibit a View of it in the great Critic's Words who it must be owed hath chastised the noble Writer somewhat  roughly  and  Aristarchus∣  like  "HE Mr COLLINS quotes the Place as it is translated forsooth in the  Cha∣racteristics  a Book writ by an anony∣mous but whoever he is a very whim∣sical and conceited Author  O wretched  Grecians  so that Author renders  PLU∣TARCH  who bring into Religion that frightful Mien of sordid and vilifying Devotion illfavoured Humiliation and  Contrition abject Looks and Countenances Consternations Prostrations Disfigura∣tions and in the Act of worship Distor∣tions constrained and painful Postures of the Body wry Faces beggarly Tones Mumpings Grimaces Cringings and the rest of this Kind  Thus far that name∣less Opiniatre And our worthy Writer Mr COLLINS introduces it with a grave Air  that  PLUTARCH  thus satirizes the public Forms of Devotion which yet are such as in almost all Countries pass for the true Worship of God  This would partly be true if those were really the Words of PLUTARCH But as not one Syllable of them is found there what must we think of this  Couple  of  Corrup∣ters  and  Forgers  There is nothing in all this but their own  Disfigurations  and  Distortions  of the Original their own  Mumpings  and  beggarly Tones  while they pretend to speak in PLUTARCH's VoicePLUTARCH having observed that Superstition alone allows no Ease nor Intermission even in Sleep their Dreams adds he do as much torment them then as their waking Thoughts did before  they seek for Expiations of those  Visions nocturnal Charms Sulfurations Dippings in the Sea Sittings all Day on the Ground  O  Greeks  Inventors of  Barbarian  Ills  whose Superstition has devised Rowlings in the Mire and in the Kennels Dippings in the Sea Grovelings and Throwings upon the Face deformed Sittings on the Earth absurd and uncouth Adorations  This is a verbal Interpretation of that Placeand now I dare ask the Reader if he has seen a more flagrant Instance of  Unfaithfulness  and  Forgery  than this of our two Writers  Humiliation  and  Con∣trition  known Words in your  English Liturgy  are to be traduced here under PLUTARCH's Name Where do those and their other Phrases appear in the Original or where do the Rites he really speaks of appear in your Form of Worship who among you  rowl them∣selves in Mire or wallow in Kennels  a Ceremony fit only to be enjoyned to such  crackbrained  and  scandalous  Writers  Phil Lipsiens  p  c  "  THE remaining Part of this random Essay is so completely vague and unintel∣ligible that although it be evidently de∣signed  as a continued Sneer at  Christia∣nity  'tis impossible to pick so much as an  Objection  or even an  Idea  out of it 'Tis therefore below Criticism To conclude when I see the noble Writer debase himself in this strange Manner exercising at once the  lowest Derision  and inflicting the  dead∣liest Wounds on Religion and Christianity  I must own the Appearance he makes call up to my Imagination a Remark of his own  "That there cannot be a Sight more shock∣ing and contemptible than that of a Man acting at once the Part of a  MerryAndrew  and an  Executioner  Wit  and  H  Part i § iii  "  It may be necessary finally to obviate his Lordship's perpetual Sneer at the  Mys∣teries  of our Religion These when parti∣cular Topics fail him are the standing Ob∣jects of his Raillery To cite particular Passages of this Kind were needless be∣cause they are innumerable The plain Im∣plication of all his gross Banter is  "That because in the  Christian  Dispensation there are some things which surpass hu∣man Comprehension  Christianity  is there∣fore  absurd  and  ridiculous  "  With Regard to this Cavil therefore  'tis not my Intention to insist on proving the  "Difference between Things being  above  Reason and Things being  contrary  to Rea∣son or that Propositions may be true though they are  above  our Reason so long as they are not  contrary  to it"  Full enough has been said on this Subject and by no body better than by the excellent Mr  Boyle  'Tis a Question of more Im∣portance to decide  "Why any thing  mys∣terious  should be admitted into a Religion  revealed  for the  Use  of Man"  And in Answer to this we need only observe that revealed Religion being designed for Man's  Use  its  essential  Doctrines are plain  intelligi∣ble  to all  accommodated  to the Nature and Faculties of the  human  Kind But as this System not only reveals to us our  Duty  but all  Motives  too which may induce us to practise it so in Order to  inforce these  and  convince  us of the  Truth  of their divine Ori∣ginal it was necessary that a  History of Pro∣vidence  or GOD's  Dispensation  should be revealed along with them Hence some∣thing  mysterious  must needs arise unless you suppose Man  infinite  in Knowledge For as this System reveals to us several Particulars so far as they stand connected with  Piety  and  Morals  which relate to the Nature of GOD the State of other and superior Be∣ings the original Condition of Man the In∣terposition of Providence for his Redemp∣tion the Change of his Nature and Facul∣ties through the future Periods of his Exis∣tence in all which Circumstances his pre∣sent Reach of Thought could give him no Information 'tis evident that in these Ac∣counts many Subjects must be  touched upon  and  other Systems  of  Being  occasionally  glanced at  the full Knowledge of which must be far beyond his present Compre∣hension Now so far as these Truths and Facts though  imperfectly revealed  have any Tendency to  enlighten  his Mind as to the general  Plan of Providence  or stand connected in any other Manner with  Reli∣gion  and  Virtue  so as to  encourage  and  pro∣mote  them they must surely be admitted as Circumstances of great  Propriety  and  Use  Or even supposing some of them to be of  none  yet if they stand so essentially  connect∣ed  with others  which are  so that the one cannot be destroyed without the other this very Circumstance of  essential Union  effectually destroys every Objection against their being of divine Original  There may be likewise and undoubt∣edly are some few Mysteries of another Kind in the  Mosaic  Dispensation Such I mean as may seem to some Apprehen∣sions not so easily reconcileable to the  mo∣ral  Attributes of GOD Of which Kind there are  some  too in the Constitution of the natural World Now here in  Reve∣lation  as in  Nature  'tis the Part of human Reason to acquiesce in this  mysterious  and  unknown  Part from what is  clear  and  known  See above § iv of this  Essay  Of this Kind perhaps is the Expulsion of the  Canaanites  under  Joshua  which the noble Writer hath taken such Pains to vili∣fy  Advice  P iii § iii  He might with as much Reason in∣sult the Creator for the Admission of  Storm Famine  or  Pestilence  For as in Nature so in  revealed  Religion we are not to judge of the  whole  Constitution or Dispensation of Things from  small  and  seeming  Exceptions On the Contrary 'tis the Part of Wisdom to determine concerning these  seeming  Ex∣ceptions from a full View of the  whole  Dis∣pensation If  this  evidently tend to Good the unprejudiced Enquirer into  Nature  and  Revelation  attributes the Doubt and Dark∣ness  which may involve any particular Part to his own  Incapacity  and  Ignorance  And justly for as the noble Writer hath told us on this very Occasion  "In an  In∣finity  of Things thus  relative  a Mind which sees not  infinitely  can see nothing  fully  Mor  Part ii § iv    LET us therefore while as yet we see but  as through a Glass and darkly  contemplate the Works of God with Reverence and Sub∣mission Let us wait the happier Hour when  we shall know even as we are known  when we shall be raised to a more enlarged Comprehension of our Creator's immense Designs and the whole intelligent Crea∣tion shall joyn in confessing and adoring the unerring Rectitude of all his Dispensa∣tions  SECTION VIII  HITHERTO we have seen the noble Writer buffooning and disgracing  Christianity  from a false Representation of its  material  Part we shall now consider what he hath thrown out against the  Com∣position Style  and  Manner  of the sacred  Scriptures for on this too he has thought it expedient to  point  his  Raillery  He tells us in the  ironical Tone  "that the Scriptural Descriptions Narrations Expressions and Phrases are in them∣selves many Times exceedingly pleasant entertaining and facetiousThat our Saviour's Stylehis Parables Si∣milies Comparisonshis Exhortations to his Disciples the Images under which he often couches his Morals and pruden∣tial Rulescarry with them a certain  Festivity Alacrity  and good Humour so remarkable that I should look upon it as impossible not to be mov'd in a  plea∣sant Manner  at their Recital  Misc  ii c  "  To these general Cavils he hath added a  Simile  in another Miscellany which as is usual with all fanciful Writers is to stand for an Argument He says  "'tis no otherwise in the grammatical Art of Characters and  painted Speech  than in the Art of  Paint∣ing  itself I have seen in certain Chris∣tian Churches an ancient Piece or two affirm'd on the solemn Faith of priestly Tradition to have been angelically and divinely wrought by a supernatural  Hand and sacred Pencil Had the Piece happen'd to be of a Hand like RAPHA∣EL's I could have found nothing  cer∣tain  to oppose to this Tradition But having observed the whole  Style  and  Manner  of the pretended heavenly Work∣manship to be so indifferent as to vary in many Particulars from the Truth of Art I presum'd within myself to beg Pardon of the Tradition and assert con∣fidently that if the Pencil had been  Heavenguided  it could never have been so  lame  in it's Performance  Misc  v c  "  This in∣genious Conceit in the subsequent Para∣graph he very  clearly  tho'  slyly  applies to the holy Scriptures  'TIS the Province of  Wit  to form  Com∣parisons  of  Philosophy  to  detect  their  Weak∣ness  when they are obtruded on us as a  Test  of Truth On Examination therefore I will venture to say the noble Writer's  Parallel  will be found highly irregular and defective  FOR there is an  essential  Difference be∣tween  Paintings  and  Writing  both in their  End  and  Execution  Paintings with Re∣gard to their End are things of mere  A∣musement  and  Taste  Consequently all their Value lies in the  Exquisiteness  of the  Art  and the  fine Hand  of the Master 'Tis likewise a Species of Art that lies chiefly among the  Few  the Bulk of Mankind or in the noble Writer's more elegant Phrase  the mere Vulgar  being  incapable  thro' a Want of  Leisure  of gaining any Proficien∣cy in this  Taste  or of acquiring that curious Discernment in  Ordonnance Drawing  and  Colouring  which is at once the Pride and Pleasure of the  VirtuosoTribe  BUT with Respect to Language the Af∣fair is otherwise It's  Ends  are  various  From the Four different Kinds of literary Composition as explained above  See  Essay  i §  there must arise a correspondent Variety of Style the  Poetical  the  Oratorial  the  Historical  and  Didactic  The First of these Kinds alone partakes of the Nature of  Picture  and therefore can alone be properly compared with it as they are both referr'd to the  Imagination  for the End of  Pleasure  The other three Species of Composition tend∣ing chiefly to  Utility  by the Means of  Persuasion  or  Instruction  draw their prime Value from  Plainness Clearness  and  Pre∣cision  From being adapted not to the  Taste  of the  fastidious Critic  but to the  Ca∣pacities  of those who are the intended Ob∣jects of  Perswasion  or  Instruction  Here then the noble Writer's Parallel is essenti∣ally defective Since it was the Intention of  Providence  in the sacred Scriptures to condescend to what his Lordship's Quality and refined Wisdom intitle him to disdain even  to instruct the mere Vulgar  Whereas the End of  Painting  is only  the Amusement of the Few  IN Regard to the  Execution  we shall find as wide a Difference There is in Philosophical strictness but one  unvary'd Language  or  Style  in  Painting  which is  "such a Modification of  Light  or  Colours  as may imitate whatever Objects we find in Nature"  This consists not in the  Ap∣plication  of  arbitrary Signs  but hath it's Foundation in the  Senses  and  Reason  of Mankind and is therefore  the same  in eve∣ry Age and Nation But in the literary  Style  or  Language  the Matter is far otherwise For Language being the  voluntary  Appli∣cation of  arbitrary  Signs according to the Consent of different Men and Nations there is no  single uniform Model of Nature  to be  followed Hence  Gracefulness  or  Strength  of Style  Harmony  or  Softness copious  Ex∣pression  terse  Brevity or  contrasted  Peri∣ods have by turns gained the Approbation of particular Countries Now all these  supposed  Beauties of Speech are  relative lo∣cal  and  capricious  and consequently un∣worthy the Imitation of a divine Artist who to fit the Speech he  ordains  to the great Work of  universal Instruction  would we may reasonably suppose strip it of eve∣ry  local peculiar  and  grotesque  Ornament and convey it unaccompany'd by all but the more  universal  Qualities common to eve∣ry Tongue  THE noble Writer then might with some shew of Reason have objected to the  Style  of Scripture had the Writers boast∣ed it's  Elegance  as MAHOMET did that of his  Koran  and defy'd all his Opposers to write any thing approaching it in this Re∣spect But the sacred Penmen discover no  Design  or  Desire  of excelling as  fine  Writ∣ers On the contrary St PAUL says  "they came not with the Power of human Speech"  and gives a Reason for it which does Honour to his Mission  THO' this Scrutiny alone might be suffi∣cient to detect and discredit the Wantonness of the noble Writer's Comparison yet it will further lead us to a full Disclosure of the Truth by shewing  that  to be the peculiar Characteristic of the Scripture  Composition  which hath ever held the first Rank among the Qualities of human Writings I mean that of  unadorned  SIMPLICITY  AS much hath been said by many Writ∣ers on the Subject of  Simplicity  with very little Precision and particularly by the noble Writer who seems to separate the  simple  Manner from the  Sublime  as if they were  incompatible  Advice  Part ii §  and indeed in his own Compositions preposterously deserts the  one  when ever he attempts the  other  See the  Moralists  passim  It may be necessary here to fix the Idea of a  just  SIMPLICITY This may be said to consist  "in  Truth  and  Weight  of SENTIMENT cloathed in such IMAGES and STYLE as may most effectually  convey  it to the Read∣er's Mind"  If any of these Circumstan∣ces be wanting if the SENTIMENT be  false  or  tristing  if the IMAGES or STYLE be such as tend rather to  fix the Attention on  themselves  than on the  Sentiment  they are employed to  convey  the  just Simplicity  is destroyed This as might be proved by a large Induction of Particulars is the Cir∣cumstance in which the best Critics of Anti∣quity placed the supreme Excellence of Writing And in this Use of the Term it appears that not only the  familiar  the  narrative  the  didactic  but the  pathetic  and  sublime  Manner too are so far from being inconsistent with  Simplicity  that they are then only in their Perfection when  founded on it  'TIS true indeed that the sacred Re∣cords are as the noble Writer calls them  "  multifarious  and of different Characters varying according to the Situation Inten∣tion and natural Capacity of the Writers  Misc  v c  "  Yet amidst all this Variety of Manner the reigning Quality of  Simplicity  is so  uniform  and  conspicuous  that the boldest Enemy of  Christianity  will not be forward to hazard the Credit of his  Taste  by calling it in Question  IF we examine them in this Light we shall find that according to the Division made above  Essays  i §  they consist of Four diffe∣rent Kinds the  poetic oratorial historical  and  didactic  Forms The poetic lies chief∣ly in the Book of  Psalms  of  Job  and seve∣ral detached Passages in the  Prophets  parti∣cularly of  Isaiah  They contain many noble Efforts of  unmixed Poetry  or  pure Imi∣tation  yet  these  being all centered in  one Intention  that of  extolling  the Works and celebrating the Power Wisdom and Good∣ness of the  Deity  do generally partake of the Character of  Eloquence  being chiefly of the  lyric  Kind  See  Essay  i §  In all these the great Character of  Simplicity  is so strongly predo∣minant that every Attempt to  embellish  them by adding the supernumerary Decorations of  Style  in  Translation  hath ever been found to  weaken  and  debase  them  AS to the  oratorial  or  pathetic  Parts innu∣merable might be produced equal if not superior to any recorded by prophane An∣tiquity In these the leading Character of  Simplicity  is no less remarkable Our SA∣VIOUR's  Parables  and Exhortations are ge∣nerally admirable in this Quality Filled with unfeigned Compassion for the Weak∣ness and Miseries of Man they breathe no∣thing but the purest Benevolence St PAUL's last Conversation with his Friends  at  Ephesus  on his Departure for  Jerusa∣lem  Acts  c xx  his Discourses on the  Resurrection  and on  Charity  his Reproofs his Commenda∣tions his Apologies especially that before AGRIPPA  Ib  c xxvi  are wrote in the noblest Strain of Simplicity And as a perfect Model of this Kind we may give the Story of JO∣SEPH  and his Brethren  which for Tender∣ness true  Pathos  and unmixed Simplicity is beyond Compare superior to any thing that appears in ancient Story  BUT as the most important Part of Scrip∣ture lies in the  historical  and  preceptive  Part especially in the  new Testament  whence chiefly our Idea of  Duty  must be drawn so we find this uniform and  simple  Manner eminently prevailing throughout in every  Precept  and  Narration  The History is conveyed in that artless Strain which alone could  adapt  it to the  Capacities  of  all Man∣kind  the Precepts delivered by our SAVI∣OUR are drawn from the Principles of  com∣mon Sense  improved by the most exalted Love of GOD and  Man  and either expres∣sed in clear and direct Terms or couched under such  Images  and  Allusions  as are every where to be found  in Nature  such as  are  and  must ever be  universally  known  and  fa∣miliar  to all Mankind  See Newton on  Daniel  Mr Jortin's  Dis∣courses  Dr Law's  Life of  CHRIST  in which we may further observe his Manner of teaching was greatly superior even to the noble Writer's justly applauded SOCRATES who for the most part drew his  Images  and Allusions from the  less known  ARTS and MANNERS of the  City  tho' indeed not without Rea∣son He did not aim at the Instruction of Mankind but of the more literate Part of his fellow Citizens His proper End was rather reforming the Minds of those who had been ill taught than instructing those who had never learnt To return thro' all this Variety of striking Allusion and mo∣ral Precept the  Style  ever continues the same  unadorned simple  and even by the noble Writer's own Confession  "  vehement  and  majestic  Misc  ii c  "  yet never drawing the Reader's Attention on itself but on the di∣vine  Sentiments  it  conveys  TO this we may further add that these several Kinds of Composition are mixed and united with such Propriety and Force as is scarce to be equalled in any other Writings  The poetical Parts are heightened by the great Strokes of  Eloquence  and  Precept  the  pathetick  by the noblest  Imagery  and just∣est  Morals  and the  preceptive  is strengthen∣ed and inforced by all the Aids of  Poetry Eloquence  and  Parable  calculated at once to engage the  Imagination  to touch the  Passions  and command the  Reason  of Man∣kind  'TIS true this unadorned  Simplicity  so conspicuous in the Scripture Composition hath often given Offence to puerile Critics The noble Writer hath but revived the Objection it was weakly urged by CEL∣SUS in the Infancy of the Christian Religi∣on  Origen  contra Cels  vii  At the Period when  Letters  reviv∣ed in  Europe  the  florid  Taste was so pre∣valent in  Italy  under the Pontificate of LEO the Tenth that the Composition of the Scriptures was on this Account held in ge∣neral Contempt and one of the fine Gen∣tlemen in Literature  Cardinal PIETRO BEMBO  of those Days is known to have declared  "that he dared not to read the  Bible  lest it should  en∣danger his Style  "  We may easily form Judgment of the Taste of that Age from  this one Circumstance  "that their most elaborate and celebrated Compositions were all wrote in a  dead Language  "  For thus they became mere  Imitators  even to a Degree of  Servility  And 'tis sufficient for the Defenders of the  Bible  to observe that along with  it  every other great Model of antient Writing fell into the same Disgrace at the abovementioned Period while the general Taste and Attention was turned from weight of  Sentiment  and strength of  Image  and  Expression  to the  local  and  ca∣pricious  Decorations of  Style  and  Language  But the Reign of this false Taste was of short Duration so that for a long Time past the comparative Merit of ancient Writers hath been  weighed  in a juster  Scale  NOW if we examine the Writers whose Composition hath stood the Test of Ages and obtained that highest Honour  "the concurrent Approbation of distant Times and Nations"  we shall find that the Cha∣racter of  Simplicity  is the  unvarying  Cir∣cumstance which alone hath been able to gain this universal Homage from Mankind Among the  Greeks  whose Writers in gene∣ral are of the  simple  Kind the divinest Poet  Homer    the most commanding  Orator  Demosthenes  the finest  Historian  Xenophon  and deepest  Philosopher  Aristotle  are above the rest conspicuously eminent in this great Quality The  Roman  Writers rise towards Perfection according to that Measure of true  Simplicity  which they min∣gle in their Works Indeed they are all inferior to the  Greek  Models But who will deny that LUCRETIUS HORACE VIRGIL LIVY TERENCE TULLY are at once the  simplest  and  best  of  Roman  Wri∣ters Unless we add the noble  Annalist  Tacitus  who appeared in after Times who not∣withstanding the  political Turn  of his Ge∣nius which sometimes  interferes  is admira∣ble in this great Quality and by it far su∣perior to his Contemporaries 'Tis this one Circumstance that hath raised the ve∣nerable DANTE the Father of modern Poe∣try above the succeeding Poets of his Country who could never long maintain the  local  and  temporary  Honours bestowed upon them but have fallen under that just Neglect which  Time  will ever decree to those who desert a  just Simplicity  for the  florid  Colourings of Style contrasted Phra∣ses  affected Conceits the mere  Trappings  of Composition and  Gothic  MINUTIAE 'Tis this hath given to BOILEAU the most lasting Wreath in  France  to SHAKESPEAR and MILTON in  England  especially to the last whose Writings are more  unmixed  in in this Respect and who had formed him∣self entirely on the  simple  Model of the best  Greek  Writers and the  sacred  Scriptures  Mr DRYDEN somewhere observes  "that MIL∣TON never sinks so far below himself as when he falls on  some Track of Scripture  "  'Tis equally true that he never  rises  so far  above himself  as when he falls on some  Track of Scripture  'Tis easy to guess what was the Drift of Mr DRYDEN's Remark But the Observations made above  Essay  i § will easily reconcile these seeming Contradictions When MILTON adopts the  poetical  Parts of Scripture he  rises  above himself But by an  injudicious Application  of the  historical  or  didactic  Parts he  often falls indeed  THIS naturally leads us to an Observation on Mr HUME's Essay "  on Simplicity and Refinement in Writ∣ing  " He hath attempted to fix a certain  Union  of these two Qualities which he says constitutes the most perfect Form of Composition It were to be wished he had given us some better  Reasons  in support of this  Opinion  which itself seems to be a mere  Re∣finement  The Progress of his Argument is remarkableHe draws all his Instances from  Poets  and having given some Examples of Poets who are both  simple  and  unpoetical  in the Extreme he arbitrarily throws the Censure on the too great Degree of  Simplicity  instead of fixing it where he ought  viz  on the too great Mixture of the  historical oratorial  or  argumentative  Species In Proof of this we need only alledge the Examples of HOMER PINDAR and CALLIMACHUS where  Simplicity  and at the same Time  Sublimity  and the  true poetic Forms  are in their last  Perfection  Thus all he proves is  "that a  Poet  ought not to be  unpoetical  "  Next he puts VIRGIL and RACINE on a  Level  as having attained the nearest to this  ima∣gined Union  of  Simplicity  and  Refinement  Here he obligeth us again to call his Taste in Question For every Page of RACINE is full of  Turns  both of  Phrase  and  Sentiment  Whereas we scarce meet with three Instances of this Kind in all VIRGIL's WritingsHe then gives us his Idea of  Simplicity  "Those Com∣positions which have the Recommendation of Sim∣plicity have  nothing surprizing  in the Thought when divested of that  Elegance of Expression  and  Harmony of Numbers  with which it is cloathed"  From these extraordinary  Premises  we are naturally prepared to expect his  Conclusion  "that CATULLUS and PARNEL are his  favourite  Authors"    AS it appears from these Instances that  Simplicity  is the only universal Characteri∣stic of just Writing so the superior Emi∣nence of the sacred Scriptures in this prime Quality hath been generally acknowledged One of the greatest Critics in Antiquity himself conspicuous in the  sublime  and  sim∣ple  Manner hath born this Testimony to the Writings of MOSES and St PAUL  Longinus  And by Parity of Reason we must conclude that had he been conversant with the other sa∣cred Writers his  Taste  and  Candour  would have allowed them the same Encomium  BUT we need not have Recourse to Au∣thorities for the Proof of the superior Weight and Dignity of the sacred Scrip∣tures in this great Quality 'Tis evident to Demonstration from the following Cir∣cumstance It hath been often observed even by Writers of no mean Rank that  "the Scriptures suffer in their Credit by the  Disadvantage  of a  literal Version  while other ancient Writings enjoy the  Advantage  of a  free  and  embellished Trans∣lation  "  But in Reality these Gentle∣men's Concern is illplaced and groundless For the Truth is  "That most other Writ∣ings are indeed  impaired  by a  literal Trans∣lation  whereas giving only a due Re∣gard to the  Idioms  of different Languages the sacred Writings when  literally trans∣lated  are then in their full Perfection"  Now this is an  internal  Proof that in all other Writings there is a Mixture of  lo∣cal relative exterior  Ornament which is often lost in the Transfusion from one Lan∣guage to another But the  internal  Beau∣ties which depend not on the  particular  Construction of  Tongues  no  Change  of  Tongue  can destroy Hence the  BibleComposition  preserves its native Beauty and Strength  alike in every Language by the sole Ener∣gy of unadorned Phrase natural Images weight of Sentiment and  great Simpli∣city  'TIS in this Respect like a rich Vein of  Gold  which under the severest Trials of Heat Cold and Moisture retains its origi∣nal  Weight  and  Splendor  without either Loss or Alloy while baser Metals are corrupted by Earth Air Water Fire and assimilated to the various Elements thro' which they pass  THIS Circumstance then may be justly regarded as sufficient to vindicate the Com∣position of the sacred Scriptures as it is at once their chief  Excellence  and greatest  Se∣curity  'Tis their  Excellence  as it renders them  intelligible  and  useful to all  'tis their  Security  as it prevents their being disguised by the  false  and  capricious  Ornaments of  vain  or  weak Translators  WE may safely appeal to Experience and Fact for the Confirmation of these Remarks on the superior Simplicity Utility and Ex∣cellence of the Style of holy Scripture Is there any Book in the World so perfect∣ly adapted to all Capacities that contains such  sublime  and  exalting  Precepts convey'd  in such an  artless  and  intelligible  Strain that can be read with such Pleasure and Advan∣tage by the lettered  Sage  and the unlettered  Peasant  To whom then would the noble Writer send Mankind for religious and mo∣ral Instruction To the divine PLATO it may be supposed or more probably to the  inraptured  Strains of PHILOCLES and THE∣OCLES And sure Mankind must reap much Instruction and Advantage from the  puffed Epithets  and  sustian Style  of a  philoso∣phical Romance  We may reasonably hope indeed soon to see nay do we not already see the happy Effects of this high Disci∣pline For in Fact the noble Writer's  Characteristics  are now the standing  Ora∣cle  in the  Office  the  Shop  nay as I am in∣formed sometimes even in the  Cobler's Stall  We need not wonder therefore that in these new Habitations of  Taste sublimed Phrase  and  abstruse Philosophy  the  simple  Strains of the Gospel are  damned  and  discarded  TO return then to the noble Writer's Comparison if indeed we have departed from it these united Observations may con∣vince us that the only circumstance in Painting which can with any Propriety be compared to literary  Style  is that of  colouring  And on this principle we may farther confirm all that hath been said on the superior Excellence of the  simple  Man∣ner For 'tis well known and the noble Writer knew it that while the Masters in this fine Art confined the Pencil to the ge∣nuine Forms of  Grace  and  Greatness  and only superadded to these the temperate Em∣bellishments of a  chastised  and  modest  co∣louring the Art grew towards its  Perfec∣tion  but no sooner was their Attention turned from  Truth Simplicity  and  Design  to the gaudy Decorations of a rich and luscious  Colouring  than their Credit de∣clined with their Art and the experienced Eye which contemplates the  old  Pictures with  Admiration  surveys the  modern  with Indifference or  Contempt  TO conclude We see there are two Kinds of  Composition  essentially opposed to each other The  one  turns the Atten∣tion on  itself  the  other  on  the Truths it conveys  The first may be justly compared to a  SunBeam playing  on the  Surface  of the Water which  attracts  and  dazzles  the Beholder's Eye by its own  useless Splendor  The last is like a  SunBeam  darting to the Bottom which while itself is  unseen  or  unobserved communicates  its brightness and  illumines every Object on which it falls  HOW far the  first  of these may belong to to the noble Writer let others determine 'Tis sufficient to have proved that the  last  is the  unvaried  Style and Manner of the  sacred Scriptures  SECTION IX  IT would have been strange had his Lordship emptied so much of his Gall on  Christianity  without bestowing a Share on its  Ministers  It may therefore be ex∣pected that something should be said on his Treatment of the  English Clergy  SO far as his Spirit of Satire may have been provoked by the persecuting and into∣lerant Principles of some of the  Clergy  in his Time 'tis highly commendable It matters not in what Rank Order or Pro∣fession the Enemies of  Freedom  may ap∣pear What shape or Pretence soever they may assume 'tis a work of true Charity to stigmatize and disgrace them as the Ene∣mies of Mankind  BUT it appears too evidently that the noble Writer's  Spleen  arose from another Foundation For his Satire is not so often  pointed against them as being the  Enemies of Freedom  as the  Friends of Christianity  With a view of disgracing them in this Regard he hath ridiculed and abused their  Writings  their  Preaching  and even their  Persons  It will only be necessary to select a few Instances of this kind from an infi∣nite Number in all which the  Delicacy  of the  Raillery  is so  conspicuous  as to need  no Illustration  IN his  Soliloquy  he hath paid his Com∣pliments to the  Writings  of the  Clergy  under the Title of "Candidates for Authorship of the sanctify'd Kind"  "These he says may be termed a sort of  PseudoAscetics  who can have no real Converse either with themselves or with Heaven""And although the Books of this sort by a common Idiom are called  good Books  the Authors for certain are a  sor∣ry Race  ""  A SaintAuthor of all Men least values Politeness  He is above the Consideration of that which in a narrow Sense we call  Manners  nor is he apt to examine any other Faults than those which he calls  Sins  Solil  Part i §  "  THUS he deals with the Clergy when they are  dull  enough to write  seriously  on the most  interesting Subjects  But if any of the Order happens to fall into a gayer turn of Composition the Charge is re∣newed under another Form Then  "the  burlesque  Divinity grows mightily in vogue and the cry'd up Answers to He∣terodox Discourses are generally such as are written in Drollery  Joy  to the Re∣verend Authors who can afford to be thus gay and condescend to correct us in this  LayWit  Misc  v c  "  THEIR  Preaching  is another standing Sub∣ject of Derision and ridiculed they must be whether they  divide  their Discourse or  divide it not  If the first then the follow∣ing stroke of Raillery is prepar'd for them  "Come we now as our  authentic Rhetori∣cians  express themselves to our  second Head  Misc  ii c  "  If the latter then  "our reli∣gious  Pastors  have changed their Manner of distributing to us their  Spiritual Food  they have run into the more savory way of  learned Ragout  and  Medley  The elegant CourtDivine exhorts in  Miscel∣lany  and is ashamed to bring his  two's  and  three's  before a fashionable Assem∣bly  Misc  ii c  "  The  Defenders  of  Christianity  are baited in their Turn  "For Example let a  zealous Divine  and  flaming Champion  of our  Faith  when inclined to shew him∣self in Print make choice of some  tre∣mendous Mystery  of Religion opposed heretofore by some  damnable Heresiarch  ""A Ring is made and Readers gather in Abundance Every one takes Party and encourages his own Side "  This shall be my ChampionThis Man for my MoneyWell hit on our SideAgain a good StrokeThere he was even with himHave at him next BoutEx∣cellent Sport  Misc  i c  "  The same  familiar Elegance  of Com∣position joyned with a surprising Effort in the noble Writer's  own Sublime  runs through the following Paragraph where he compares a Controversy in  Divinity  to a Match at  FootBall  "So have I known a  crafty Glazier  in time of Frost pro∣cure a FOOTBALL to draw into the Street the  emulous Chiefs  of the  robust  Youth  The  tumid Bladder  bounds at every KICK  bursts  the  withstanding  CASEMENTS the  Chassys Lanterns  and all the  brittle vitreous  WARE The  Noise  of  Blows  and  Outcries  fills the WHOLE NEIGHBOURHOOD and the Ruins of Glass cover the  stony Pavements  till the  bloated battering Engine subdued  by Force of FOOT and FIST and  yield∣ing up its Breath  at many a  fatal  CRAN∣NY becomes lank and harmless sinks in its Flight and can no longer uphold the Spirit of the contending Parties  Misc  i c  "  NOT content with these  severe Strokes  of Raillery the noble Writer prepares a more deadly Blow at the Clergy even no less than ruining their Fortunes among the  FairSex  And here the discerning Rea∣der will readily guess that his Ridicule must be needs levelled at their  Persons  He introduces or drags in the Story of OTHELLO and DESDEMONA represents the one as a  miraculous  Storyteller the other as a  credulous  Hearer He then adds  "But why the Poet amongst his  Greek  Names should have chosen one which denoted the Lady  superstitious  I can't  imagine unless as Poets are sometimes Prophets too he should figuratively un∣der this dark Type have represented to us that about a hundred Years after his time the Fair Sex of this Island should by  other monstrous Tales  be so seduced as to turn their Favour chiefly on the  TaleTellers  and change their natural Incli∣nation for fair  candid  and  courteous Knights  into a Passion for  a mysterious Race of black Enchanters  Solil  Part ii §  "  I CANNOT think this  elegant  Passage de∣serves a particular Reply 'Tis supposed the noble Writer designed it only as a Proof  "That the  SaintAuthor  of all Men  least values Politeness  "  as a Proof how  inca∣pable  he was of  violating his own Rule  or exercising any Degree of  "that  gross  sort of  Raillery  which is so  offensive in good Com∣pany  Wit and H  Part i §  "  Indeed all the  delicate  Paragraphs here cited are much of the same nature and afford an undeniable Proof how great a Master his Lordship was in the true  re∣fined  Manner of  Attic  Wit I shall only add that if according to the noble Wri∣ter's projected Scheme of Confutation the  English Clergy  should ever be  baited  in the way of  Puppetshow  at  Bart' l' mewFair  I would recommend the above Passages with many parallel ones in the  Characteristics  to the Managers of the  Drama  as being ad∣mirably suited to the  Genius  of their  wooden  DROLE whether he should chuse to  swag∣ger  in the  Sock  or  strut  in the  Buskin  WERE the Clergy disposed to return these Compliments  in Kind  it may be questioned whether his Lordship's Admirers would acquit them of  coarse Manners  But how∣ever some of that Body may  blindly hate  and others as  blindly admire  the Author of the  Characteristics  yet the best and wisest of the Profession so far as I have been able to learn from their Conversation would probably rather chuse to return his Saluta∣tions in the following Manner  Notwithstanding the superior Airs of  Contempt  which on all Occasions yourLordship is pleased to assume we cannot think you of such Ability as you seem to appear in your own Eyes neither can we think this overweening Opinion of your self this Disdain of all who adopt not your peculiar Tenets is any Proof of real Wisdom since yourself have taught us  to believe  "that as we grow  wiser  we shall prove  less conceited  "  Though we scorn to  revile  you yet we judge our∣selves  well intitled  to tell you  the Truth  on every Subject We regard therefore a fine  Imagination  an extensive  Knowledge  and a commanding  Judgment  as three Qualities independent of each other In the first we think you  eminent  in the second considerable in the last we must be excused if we think you  neither emi∣nent nor considerable  And on this Account we can allot you  no high Rank  in the Scale of  true Genius  Suitable to this your  Taste  in  Arts  is much superior to your  Talents  for  Philosophy  The only  Chain  of  Reasoning  you have exhibited is found in your  Enquiry concerning Virtue  nor is even this fastened to the  Throne of Truth  but hangs trembling from a  shadowy  and  aerial  Fabric blown up by a sportive Imagination You have indeed obtained the Character of an  original Writer  in  Phi∣losophy  how little you deserve this must needs be known to all who are versed in the  Greek Schools  for thence the  rational Part  of your System is chiefly drawn What you  borrow  you often  embellish  some∣times  disguise  never  strengthen  but when you attempt to become  original  you only convince us how ill qualified you are for such a Task Accordingly we find in the general turn of your Writ∣ings  meagre Sentiments  studiously adorned by a  glare  of  Words  and a  waste  of  Ima∣gery  with these you amuse the common Reader like the unqualified Painter who unable to reach the Beauties of a just and  vigorous Expression  covers a lifeless Fi∣gure with  gaudy Draperies  And we cannot but think that had you studied the Writings of that great and excellent Man whom you so weakly deride  Mr  Locke  See  Advice  c  Part  iii §  your Vo∣lumes whatever they had lost in  Bulk  would have gained in  weight  and  splendor  With regard to the Buffoonries which you have occasionally exercised on Chri∣stianity in what you call  "your Random Essays"  they are so much below the Character of  the Philosopher  that it is matter of Surprize to us that you could think they can become the  Man of Wit  It is true among those whom you most despise the  mere Vulgar  they have gained you the Character of an  inimitable  Author  among Readers of that Rank  "who are ready to swallow any low Drollery or Jest"  among those whom you have else∣where  "described who while they pre∣tend to such a Scrutiny of other Evidences are the readiest to take the Evidence of the greatest Deceivers in the World  their own Passions  Mor  P ii §  "  But whatever these Passages may be in their  Consequences  we cannot but think them in their own  Na∣ture  even  contemptible  For to use your own  Attic  Phrase  "to  twitch snap snub  up or  banter  to torture  Sentences  and  Phrases  and turn  a few Expressions into Ridicule  is not sufficient to constitute what is properly esteemed  a Writer  Misc  v c  "  On this Account we look upon these boasted Passages in your Book to be of that Kind which are calculated only  "  to create Diversion  to those who look no fur∣ther  Misc  i c  "  and in which as you elsewhere observe  "the most  confused Head  if  fraught with a little Invention  and pro∣vided with  CommonPlaceBook Learning  may exert itself to as much Advantage as the most  orderly  and  wellsettled Judg∣ment  Ibid  "  We cannot therefore express any  Esteem either for the  Scurrilities  of the  coarse  JESTER or the  trim Delicacy  and  SelfAdmiration  of the  literary  NARC IS∣SUS  BUT  my Lord  there lies a heavier Charge against you than that of  bad Writ∣ing  We mean the  Indecency  and  Immo∣rality  of  your Conduct  in your  Manner  of attacking  Christianity  You would be thought a  Lover  of your  Country  yet you pour  Contempt  upon its  Laws  and  In∣stitutions  You allow the Propriety of a  religious Establishment  yet you take every Occasion to  deride  it You contend for a  public Leading  in Religion yet you per∣petually insinuate that Mankind are  led by the Nose  You say  "The  Public  ought not to be  insulted to its Face  "  yet your Writings are one  continued Insult  upon its  Opinions  Our excellent and unrivaled Constitution allows a perfect  Freedom  of  Enquiry  had you then argued  ingennous∣ly  and  fairly  against  Christianity  without attempting  Ridicule  whatever Opinion we might have entertained of your  Head  we might at least have thought favourably of your  Heart  But in direct Opposition to this Rule you always  ridicule  scarce  ever  argue  you endeavour to instil  illegal Opinions  without bringing any Evidence to support either their  Usefulness  or  Truth  You give these  crude Buffoonries  to the World in  Print  and is not this  insulting the Public to its Face  In this Instance we must think you  a bad Citizen  and to be ranked among those whom a Writer by no Means prejudiced in Favour of Re∣ligion thus justly stigmatizes  "Who I hardly know for what End have written against the Religion of their Country and without pretending to substitute any thing better or more practicable in its Place would deprive us of our happy Establishment merely as it should seem for the Pleasure of pulling down and do∣ing Mischief  Enquiry into  Homer's  Life and Writings  §  "  Besides this  my Lord  we must take the Liberty to say that you betray such frequent Marks of  Insincerity  and  designed Misrepresentation  in your Treatment of  Christianity  as but ill con∣sists with that  Reverence  which you owe to  Truth  and to  yourself  such as becomes not  a  MAN much less a  Man  whom the Public consent hath distinguished by the Title of RIGHT HONOURABLE  WHAT your particular Motives may have been to this Treatment of  Christianity  you best know The most  excusable Tempta∣tion  to this strange Conduct that we can assign must have been the  natural Preva∣lence  of  Spleen  For as you observe  "all  splenetic  People have a necessary Propen∣sity to Criticism and Satire""The Spirit of Satire rises with the  ill Mood  and the chief Passion of Men thus  diseased  and thrown  out of good Humour  is to find  Fault censure unravel confound  and leave no∣thing without  Exception  and  Controversy  Misc  ii c  "  FAR be it from us to derogate from your  private Virtues  tho' we cannot but wish that in your Treatment of  Christianity  you had given better Proofs of that  universal Cha∣rity  which you so  warmly profess  even while you are reviling  that Religion  where alone it is to be foundThere is another Circumstance that sure the more humane Part of your Admirers would hesitate up∣on we mean that  extreme Contempt  you express for those you call the  mere Vulgar  Your Regard seems solely centered in esta∣blishing your  peculiar System  among those you call  "Men of  Fashion  and  Breeding  "  while you give up  the Vulgar  that is to speak with due Reverence of the Works of GOD the Bulk of your  FellowCrea∣tures  as a proper Prey to the supposed De∣lusions and Tyranny of those whom you brand as the Enemies of Mankind How this  Contempt  for the greatest Part of your  Species  can consist with true  Virtue  or  Charity  we are at a Loss to comprehend 'Tis certain  Christianity  would have taught you otherwise Nay  my Lord  a great  Roman  as much your Superior in  Station  as in  Genius  and  active Virtue  would have told you  "that true Goodness extends it∣self to the  Multitude  that Virtue is not disdainful or proud but regards all Ranks of Men and consults their Welfare which it could not do if it  despised the Vulgar  Cicero  Lael  "  Christianity  hath nobly heightened this Principle and recom∣mends the  Weak  the  Poor  the  Ignorant  as the proper Objects not only of our  Cha∣rity  but  Instruction  And however mor∣tifying it may be to proud Minds we must say that we frequently meet with Men in the lower Ranks of Life sometimes even in  Cities  often in  Cottages  who when  instructed  in the Principles of true  Christi∣anity  are superior in  Knowledge Worth  and  Happiness  to those who hold them in Contempt  WITH Regard to your Treatment of  ourselves  It gives us no Concern For in one Word Calumnies thrown on whole Bodies of Men are  unmeaning  and  self∣confuted  "You may therefore proceed in your Invectives bestowing as free Language of that Kind as your  Charity  and superior  Breeding  will permit You may liberally deal your  courtly Compliments  and  Salutations  in what Dialect you think fit since for our own Part neither the the Names of  Bigots Impostors Pedants Formalists Gladiatorian Penmen Flaming Champions of the Faith Black Tribe  or  Black Enchanters  Names bestowed on the English Clergy throughout the  Characteristics  will in the least scan∣dalize us while the Sentence comes only from  the Enemies of our Master  On the contrary we rather strive with ourselves to suppress whatever Vanity might natu∣rally arise in us from such Favour be∣stow'd For whatever may in the Bot∣tom be intended us by such a Treatment  'tis impossible for us to term it other than  Favour  since there are certain  Enmities  which it will be ever esteemed a real Ho∣nour  to have merited  See  Misc  v c  "  YOU have indeed wisely and artfully endeavoured to  intimidate  us from expos∣ing the Folly of your  Insults  on  Religion  and  Christianity  by representing such an Attempt as being in itself  Contemptible  For thus you are pleased to speak  "It must be own'd that when a Writer of any Kind is so  considerable  as to deserve the Labour and Pains of some  shrewd Heads  to refute him in Public he may in the Quality of  an Author  be justly congra∣tulated on that Occasion 'Tis supposed necessarily that he must have writ with some kind of  Ability  or  Wit  Misc  i c  "  TO obviate this Remark is the only fur∣ther Trouble we shall give your Lordship on the present Occasion And here without any particular Application to yourself we must beg Leave to offer the plain Reason why we think your Observation however plausible and commonly received is yet entirely groundless Indeed with regard to Writings of mere  Speculation  or  Criti∣cism  which affect not the Happiness of  Mankind  "if Authors write ill they are despised"  and forgotten At least as the  Satirist  observes they ought to be so  Quel Demon vous irrite vous porte à medire  Un Livre vous deplait Qui vous force à le lire  Laissiz mourir un Fat dans son Obscurité  Un Auteur ne peut il  pourrir  Sureté  Boileau  Sat  ix  And on this Account many Parts of the  Characteristics  will probably pass for ever  uncensured  by us  BUT there are other Kinds of bad Writing which will ever bid fair to  live  and be  admired  We mean such as  mini∣ster  to the  low Passions  and  Vices  of Man∣kind among which RIDICULE  on  RE∣LIGION is of all others the most favourite Topic And even where these Affections do not prevail the generality of Men thro' the Weakness of Nature are easily misled in Matters even of the nearest Concern∣ment by  Sophistry  or  Buffoonry  by a  Hint  a  Sarcasm  or an  Allusion  Now in this Case 'tis surely a proper and  rational  tho' perhaps no  easy  Task to  detect Misre∣presentation  and lead Mankind back again to the Paths of  Truth  and  Happiness  For the Effects of  Ridicule  on the  Mind  re∣semble those of  Venom  on the  Body  which  tho' struck into the Blood by a  puny Rep∣tile  may yet  demand  nay even  baffle  the Power of the  strongest Medicines  How then can you affirm that an Effect of this Kind  "  implies  either  Ability  or  Wit  "  if  Buffoonry  and  Sophistry  can do the Busi∣ness And that they  may  we have your Lordship's  full Acknowledgment  for to adopt and conclude with your own Ex∣pression  "In the same Manner as a  ma∣licious  CENSURE  craftily  worded and pronounced with  Assurance  is apt to pass with Mankind for  shrewd  WIT so a  virulent  or a  visionary  MAXIM in  bold  Expressions tho' without any  Justness  of Thought is readily received for  true  PHI∣LOSOPHY  Moralists  P ii §  "  FINIS  ERRATA  Page    l    for  emerge  read  immerge  P    l  pen∣ult  for  enjoying  read
