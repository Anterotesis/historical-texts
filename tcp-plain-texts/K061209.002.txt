CatharineStreet in the Strand M DCC LXVII  THE HISTORY OF LOUISA MILDMAY  LETTER XIII  Miss  HARRIOT BEAUCLERK  to Miss  LOUISA MILDMAY  O my sweet friend my dearest Louisa are our sorrows never to have an end and is every day that should mitigate the severity of our fortune to bring us nothing but an aggravation of distress Your poor brotherI cannot keep it from youwas a few hours ago brought to us desperately  wounded by that barbarous villain Harold with whom he accidentally met at the Crown in Reading and there with more courage than discretion called to an account for his infamous behaviour to the most beautiful and most worthy of her sex Pistols were the cursed weapons they fought with and your brother received a shot a little above the groin the ball was extracted by an eminent surgeon at Reading and the colonel was brought home in a litter as the physicians judged it better to remove him even such a number of miles than to let him remain in any place where he could not have proper accommodations  Your poor mother when she saw him borne in fainted away and was immediately removed to her own apartment where after applying the necessary restoratives we happily recovered her  she then told me that this was nothing more than what she expected and that she was the less affected at the shock as she had rendered it continually familiar to her imagination"Yet Miss Beauclerk" continued the venerable lady  it is a severe stroke though an expected one but God's will be done  A large tear then rolled down her fine face which she endeavoured to restrain as she saw how much I was touched with the general misfortune after this she sent for the surgeon and doctor who attended the colonel from Reading and begged they would give her their candid opinion of his situation  Don't be afraid to tell me gentlemen  says she endeavouring at a smile  for though I have all the tenderness of a mother I hope I also possess the resignation of a Christian  The gentlemen looked at one another in admiration both of her piety and her fortitude and  very freely owned that the colonel was in some danger but that they were nevertheless in hopes if they could prevent a fever to see him tolerably recovered in a little time The gentlemen then preparing to withdraw I whispered the doctor to feel her own pulse which he did in a very respectful manner and advised her to loose a few ounces of blood she assented to the motion and the doctor at going out gave me a look of benignity for my recollection that indicated a goodness of heart in himself which has raised him not a little in my estimation After your mother had been bled we prevailed upon her to lye down and I left her just now in a sweet doze which I flatter myself will do her a world of benefit  As my attention at your brother's first coming in was called off by your mother's distress I sent for Butler his Irish  servant who is principally employed about his person to be informed of particularsThe poor fellow though deeply affected for his master's accident told me he should ever love and honour his old master for bearing up so like a man against the stroke of misfortune"Madam" says he  instead of exclaiming as the generality of father's would have done on such an occasion and censuring the rashness of his son he took hold of my master's hand kissed it with an air of inconceiveable satisfaction and praised him for the attention which he had shewn to the honour of his family the only regret he testified was at hearing that the person who had injured his honour was not hurt in the engagement for had he fallen says my old master that would have been a great satisfactionAnd so it would you know madam  continued the honest Hibernian    The honour of a good family is a very nice affair I am come of as good a family myself as any in Ireland and know how to feel for such a misfortune as has happened to my master's  Though I could not help smiling at the egotism of poor Butler I nevertheless desired him to answer my questions and not teaze me with his reflections he therefore proceeded to inform me that your father and brother were both more than ever incensed against Harold and that your brother had solemnly swore to call him to a second account the moment he recovered from the present accident that your father however had been forced out of the room from the colonel as talking did much injury to the latter and that the old gentleman upon withdrawing said something about altering his will Butler added that  your brother desired a visit from me above all things and he believed would request a favour of that kind if he was any way better in the morning  You conjure me by all our friendship my dearest Louisa to give you a minute account of every thing to mitigate no description and to conceal no distress I obey you though against my inclinanation as I know how a sensibility like your's must be wounded by a repetition of some circumstances but my sweet my ever amiable friend exert your utmost resolution and prepare to meet those evils with fortitude which are impossible to be avoidedTrue magnanimity is never seen till the day of distress and those have naturally the noblest minds who make the firmest stand against affliction  From some things which have escaped your brother since I wrote the foregoing part of this letter I have reason to imagine that Sir Robert Harold was not altogether so much in fault in the late rencounter as we were inclined to imagine colonel Mildmay himself acknowledges that he used every provocation before he could prevail upon the baronet to engage and he even intimates that Sir Robert was actually going to town with an intention of throwing himself at your feet and imploring your forgivenessIf this was the case it was certainly rash in the colonel to carry matters to such an extremity he ought to consider that the happiness of more people than one is dependent upon his welfare and that the hazarding of his life may increase the general misfortune but can never have the smallest tendency to remove it but he has too nice a sensibility for his own ease and is frequently running  into real ills to avoid imaginary misfortunes You know my dear my partiality for your brother and you also know that on the present occasion prudence will not allow me to give such a loose to my feelings as I should naturally shew were we on such a footing as you have frequently wished usPerhaps it may be something of this very partiality which induces me to wish that in the course of the recent transaction he had made use of a little less spirit and a little more understanding You cannot conceive my dearest Louisa how it distresses me to think of his situation to find myself in the same house with him and yet to be under a necessity of seeming only a friendly partaker in the common calamityThis cruel constraint is too much and I pine I sicken I die for an interview with him though I am sensible such a circumstance in his present condition must fill me with the  most poignant affliction hitherto he has never said a single syllable that could furnish a reasonable hope of his considering me with any tenderness of prepossession but he has nevertheless been studious to gain my good opinion though he has declined to solicit for my love and I have a strong notion that he intends to be particular the very first opportunity my heart at least interprets things in that sense and who knowsBut my sweet Louisa forgive me how could I possibly indulge the most distant thought of happiness while you are sinking under the deepest distress and while the life of the dear youth is at stake on whom my whole happiness so materially depends O Louisa excuse the woman at my heart which in spite of my best efforts would talk about your brother though the share which you know I partake in his danger must add in a very considerable  degree to your anxiety If possible I will forbear to mention him with regard that I may avoid wounding so nice a part of your sensibility since I am conscious with what a generous concern you feel for your Harriot and am but too apprehensive that this concern will lead you into some self accusations equally injurious to the recovery of your own peace and the stability of her friendship  In my last I told you that my mother upon hearing what an unexpected cloud had overcast the happiness of your family gave me permission to stay for a few days with her dear Mrs Mildmay tenderly as well as wisely considering that in the present state of things her venerable friend would naturally want somebody to sooth the anguish of her mind who was really interested in her distress You cannot conceive how kindly the worthy lady your mother has  received this little instance of our attachmentShe wept over me when I mentioned my design to remain at Mildmay Hall till my attendance became unnecessary and ardently pressing me to her bosom condescended to kiss my cheek and called me her true Harriot her other LouisaEver since she has honoured me with a more than common share of her confidence is desirous of being alone with me upon every occasion and you may easily conjecture my ever amiable girl what subject principally engrosses our conversation  Just this moment she sent for me to her bedside having been some minutes awake and seeing my fingers marked with ink"I suppose my love" says she  you have been writing to poor Louisa  I replied in the affirmative and insinuated what a consolation it would be to you if you were honoured  with her remembrance  My dear Miss Beauclerk  returned she  have not I already told you that she is still my child that she even may write to me if she pleases and that I shall always consider her unhappy fall with a much greater share of pity than resentment To be candid with you my obliging love  continued the dear lady  I am more to be blamed for leaving Sir Robert Harold and Louisa so frequently together than either is for abusing the confidence which I reposed in their discretion Young people where they tenderly love each other and where a day is set apart for their marriage are very dangerous companions the woman loses all her fear and the man all his veneration they become insensibly more and more familiar till their imaginations are intensely heated and their recollection totally lostIn such  a situation the consequence is but too obvious the woman wakes into distraction and the man into doubt or disgustShe trembles for his constancy and he fears for her virtue recriminations naturally ensue and they either go to the altar with sentiments very little calculated to preserve their future felicity or break off in such a manner as draws a general disgrace upon the woman and her family O Miss Beauclerk why did'nt I consider this matter with propriety when such a consideration would have been essential to my happiness Why would I expose the darling of my heart to dangers which it was scarcely possible for her to avoid or ensnare the inexperience of my child with unecessary temptationsBut alas  because  she was  my  child I must foolishly suppose her above the reach of human infirmities and be guilty  of an inattention in my own conduct which I would have severely censured in the mother of any body else O my sweet Louisa your doating mother's extravagant fondness has been the cause of all our calamities and your indiscretion was nothing more than the natural result of her mistaken partiality  In this manner my beautiful friend did the generous minded lady proceed while my tears could only testify the warmth of my approbation She was pleased to see me touched and more than once kissing away the drops from my cheeks declared she was never sorry to see a young lady miserable at a scene of distress because those only could continue unmov'd who were utterly destitute of humanity and understandingYour father came in about this time and seeing both our eyes red assigned  in the fury of his resentment a very different cause from the real one  What do you cry for my dear  says he to your venerable mother  If the villain who has brought all this affliction upon our heads is not yet sacrificed be satisfied that justice shall overtake him in the end for I have a gallant boy still living who shall pursue him with unceasing vengeance till he has washed away the disgrace of our family in his blood O had the inhospitable monster but fallen to day how light should I have made of my son's misfortune but he shall yet feel meBy the great God of heaven and earth he shall and so my dear be pacified  "O Mr Mildmay" replied your mother  too much blood has been spilled already and if something which I have casually heard from Miss Beauclerk of Sir Robert's repentance  be true I must say that it would be much better to think of an accommodation than to expose ourselves to any additional share of distress lady Haversham is an excellent woman and I have strong reason to imagine that her influence will have every weight we could wish with the thoughtless young man her brother suffer me therefore my dear to make an enquiry into the foundation of Miss Beauclerk's intelligence that if we find  "Find what madam" interrupted your father with an uncommon degree of vehemence  You would not surely have the dishonour of your family pass unpunished nor think of receiving a villain as your soninlaw who has covered you with the most infamous disgrace Would you give your daughter to a ruffian who has possibly  murdered your son or would you basely beg of lady Haversham to speak a good word for us to her scoundrel of a brother Are we reduced at once so low as to kneel where we have been barbarously injured and must we think of supplicating a monster for compassion whose hands have been equally steeped in our reputation and our blood Fie Mrs Mildmay fie this is a language unworthy both of your character and your descent and could I find a thought of so dishonourable a nature rising in my bosom I should do instant justice on the traytor and stab it to the heart  Your mother made no reply to this but by a shower of tears which your father being utterly unable to withstand he flew out of the room leaving me to give the dear lady what consolation I could which in fact was but very  trifling as I stood in no little need of consolation myself Such my sweet friend is the state of matters at Mildmay Hall Your brother though his wounds pain him considerably slept a full hour this evening so Butler just now acquainted me adding that he and the surgeon were to sit up all night with him and assuring me that there should be no want of attendance on either of their parts"As for myself" says Butler  I shall have but little inclination to sleep while my poor master continues in any danger and as for the surgeon I will take care that he shall wake whenever there is the smallest necessity for his assistance  So saying he gave a significant look as if he should be angry with the gentleman in case of any neglect and marched off to the housekeeper for some old linen to cut up in bandages You desired me at the conclusion of your letter to inform  you whether there is any other visitor at the HallIt is with pleasure I can acquaint you that there is not The morning after your departure messengers were sent to every body invited but myself to let them know that an unexpected circumstance had happened which must delay the wedding for some time but that they should receive early intelligence against the day of celebration And now my dearest Louisa let me again insist that you will bear up with all your fortitude against the hand of adversityFortune believe me will yet wear a propitious countenance and we shall all experience a degree of happiness in proportion to the severity of our present distress Your mother my sweet girl on her reverend knees with streaming eyes and uplifted hands is this moment blessing you such a woman's prayers to the Throne of Mercy must be effectualProvidence looks with  delight upon all parental supplications but where a parent is peculiarly distinguished for every virtue the petition is sanctified into a kind of claim and is no sooner pronounced than rewarded Good night sister of my soul my ever amiable Louisa By the next post you shall hear from me again and I hope infinitely more to your satisfaction  HARRIOT BEAUCLERK  LETTER XIV  Miss  MILDMAY  to her Mother  IF I have yet delayed paying my humblest duty to my ever revered mama if I have yet denied myself the unspeakable satisfaction of approaching her by letter it was neither from a want of the deepest respect nor the strongest inclinationBut alas covered with confusion and dishonour sinking beneath a consciousness of my guilt and knowing myself utterly unworthy of her smallest consideration I wanted courage to address her and even blushed at my presumption when I supposed it might be possible for her to remember a miserable wretch like me with any distant traces of pity or affectionAnd O my mama did you really on your reverend knees condescend to beg  a blessing for your unfortunate daughter did you really with streaming eyes implore the Throne of Mercy in my favour and extend your benignant hands to pluck down comfort on my head Could you pray for the restoration of her peace who has so barbarously destroyed your happiness and wish a length of prosperous years to an unnatural monster whose infamy has shortened your own date of days and blackened the little remnant with affliction and disgraceO madam where shall I hide myself from this excess of goodnessWhere shall I take refuge from this unbounded amplitude of generosity The severity of reproach I could have borne because it is deserved and I could have withstood the shock of indignation because it is merited But this astonishing tenderness is insupportableit overcomesit destroys meand at this moment I am forced to  make a full pause being unable to bear up against the conflict of my own heart which is no less torn with the keenness of my gratitude than tortured by the pungency of my remorse  A few drops of hartshorn having somewhat relieved a faintingness that came over me just then I now endeavour to resume my letter though totally at a loss in what manner to proceed for alas my dear mama can I possibly mention any subject that will not aggravate the nature of my guilt and add to the greatness of your affliction If I ask after my ever honoured father the pangs with which I have filled his venerable bosom immediately occurIf I mention the best beloved and noblest of brothers I find him weltering in blood on my account and if I even address myself to you who have treated me with such an infinite degree of unexampled  generosity do I not find you languishing on the bed of sickness and drooping at the infamy of a daughter who should have been the happy source of your consolationO my dear mama revoke your gracious your inestimable blessingRenounce mecurse meand detest me for I am detestable in my own eyes and am ready to commit some instant act of desperation when I recollect what ruin I have brought upon you allWhat a dreadful return have I made for all your unbounded tenderness and affection Yet madam presumptuous as it must be in me to name either you my father or my brother after what has past still I must take the liberty of offering up my prayers for the recovery of your peace still must I pray for the reestablishment of my brother's health who is so great an ornament to the family if the  goodness of that God who sees into the bottom of my afflictions would be pleased to restore him and to take me speedily out of the world I should hope it was yet possible for you to be happy together notwithstanding the misconduct of a guilty wretch who is now so just an object of your contempt and detestation  The good lady Haversham ever since my arrival in town has been a constant visitor at Mrs Darnel's and tries by every means in her power to alleviate the poignancy of my distressShe laments the behaviour of her brother with the sincerest concern and has shewn me some letters from him which give me reason to think he is very sorry for it himself and is desirous of taking every possible step to effect a reconciliation but that madam is a matter not to be thought of nowHe has shewn  himself unworthy of being a son to you and my papa and for any thing that should depend on my determination could I gain the world by a union with him or what is more could I recover my lost peace of mind I should spurn him without hesitation and think it an increase of my present infamy to retain him a moment in my remembranceNo madam though I have disgraced my family by the madness of one guilty moment my mind is yet incapable of a premeditated baseness and would scorn to vow duty and obedience where it cannot look without an equal mixture of abhorrence and contempt You do not know my dear mama how very scandalous a part he has acted You do not know with how elaborate a meanness with how ingenious a littleness he has behaved in the course of this unfortunate transaction but Miss Beauclerk in a few days will be able to  make you acquainted with the minutest circumstance I am writing out the whole melancholy story at her request and I know it will give your generous bosom some satisfaction to find that though I am guilty I have not by any subsequent action rendered myself despicable  Lady Haversham madam was this moment here she came to me in an absolute state of distraction so that it was a full hour before Mrs Darnel and I could restore her to any tollerable share of tranquilityShe had a letter in her hand directed to Mr Melmoth of whom you heard her brother speak so very highly when he was down in the country This letter it seems was a circumstantial account of the unhappy quarrel between my brother and Sir Robert from which we learn that the worthless man was coming after me in  a great hurry to London to throw himself at my feet and to implore my forgiveness for his barbarous behaviour O that my brother had not seen him at Reading his life had then been entirely out of a danger and I should have the pleasure at least of mortifying his cruel antagonist with a repulse  The countess when she came a little to herself entered into a long conversation with me about the impropriety of refusing her brother since he was now brought to so happy a conviction of his errors and was attached to me still with so unabating an ardency of affection  I am sure my dear Louisa  argued she  notwithstanding you have very great cause for being offended with him you have not yet erased him from your heart and it would of consequence be punishing yourself not to think of forgiving him in the end  I begged  at last that her ladyship would say no more on the subject that it pained me excessively and that I could never hear her brother's name without reflecting on my own disgrace and the general dishonour of my family she then obligingly waved the discourse but said that she and Mr Melmoth were to set off for Mildmay Hall in the morning and that she hoped to find you and my papa more propitious to her entreaties than what the justice of my resentment would at present suffer me to be I then only said that I had disobliged my papa and mama too much not to wish for some opportunity of making an attonement but that the circumstance she hinted at was a method which I was pretty sure would not meet with their approbation however she left me after making some professions of a nature so extremely generous yet delicate that I could not help lamenting  after her departure to find so very worthless a man as her brother engrossed so great a share of her affection For my own part I once loved him once tenderly loved him but why do I torture my recollection with his name his baseness has cured me of that passion and I am now alive to nothing but the sense of my dishonour and the afflictions of my family  That these afflictions may be speedily removed my dearest mama is my incessant prayer life has now no other charm but the hope of seeing your happiness the happiness of my papa and the happiness of my brother reestablished could I once see these desirable events I should sink contented into my grave for though I shall never know a moment's peace in this world I shall not enter upon the next with any satisfaction if I have but the smallest  cause to think that you remember me with regret Do not therefore my evertoberevered mama suffer yourself to feel any uneasiness on my account Do not let the recollection of a guilty creature like me prey upon your health and render the family misfortune irreparable My dear brother madam deserves all your tenderness and could a union be brought about between him and my amiable Miss Beauclerk she would supply every thing which I once endeavoured to bebefore I was unworthy to be called your dutiful daughter  LOUISA MILDMAY  LETTER XV  Mr  MELMOTH  to Sir  ROBERT HAROLD  Dear  HAROLD  YOU are certainly one of the happiest fellows in the world every thing is in a fair way of being adjusted to your wishes and before the end of six weeks I am in hopes to give you joy on your marriage with the amiable Miss Mildmay  The moment I received your last letter I went to lady Haversham with it and you may easily judge how much that excellent woman was affected at the contents Tremblingly attentive to your safety it was with the greatest difficulty she could go through your account of the duel and generously sensible to the distresses of the Mildmay  family she felt very severely for the misfortune of the colonel  O Mr Melmoth  cried she  what must poor Louisa suffer what must the good Mrs Mildmay suffer on this shocking occasion My brother conscious of his guilt should have borne every thing and yet upon the whole he has acted with more temper than I expectedSee Sir  continued she  how wide how general a ruin may be occasioned by one bad action Did young fellows consider what a number of evils may possibly spring from the commission of a single crime a moment's recollection would be sufficient to deter them from their most favourite pursuits but alas totally regardless of consequences in the progress of their licentious designs they think the young lady is the only person to be injured without considering that there is a mother to die at  her destruction and a father or a brother to madden at her disgrace  After lady Haversham had given way for some time to her emotion I asked her if it would not be the most prudent step that could be taken for her ladyship to set out instantly to Mildmay Hall with your letter in her hand and fairly shew the father and mother how little you were to be blamed in your rencounter with the colonel I observed that notwithstanding their resentment against you they had every reason to treat her with the most unreserved affection and I offered my service as an escorte if she imagined I could accompany her with any degree of propriety The motion met her approbation and she accepted of my offer with great satisfaction saying that as Miss Mildmay's misfortune could not possibly remain a secret the presence of a man  so intimate with your family could by no means be indelicate She however put off the expedition till the morning being first of all desirous to see Louisa whom she had not visited that dayAnd here I must inform you Harold that your sister has bought a very elegant chariot and settled matters just as you could wish with Mrs Darnel When lady Haversham came to that part of your letter which mentions such a provisionit was too much for her she laid the paper down and bursting into a flood of tears exclaimed  Why this is well thought of Mr Melmoththere is soul in this what pity it is that he will not be uniformly good and take as much pains to avoid the commission of an injury as he manifests inclination to repair it  But to business  Yesterday morning we set out in a chariot and six for Mildmay Hall and  arrived there about two o'clock quite surprizing Mr and Mrs Mildmay as you may naturally imagine by our unexpected appearance The old gentleman at first carried matters very high and seemed to think himself under a necessity of keeping a prodigious distance but lady Haversham who has a degree of consideration that equals her benignity kindly made allowances for his behaviour and seizing him by the arm with all that candour of cordiality which generally disarms an illgrounded resentment begged of him to consider her as a faithful friend to his family who deeply partook in his misfortunes though these misfortunes were unhappily created by the profligacy of her brother"My dear Mr Mildmay" expostulated the admirable woman  I am almost as much to be pitied as yourself you know how much my heart was in an alliance  with your house and you also know how tender a friendship I ever entertained for the amiable Louisa don't therefore instead of giving me consolation add ungenerously to my distress but consider me as a person deeply sensible of all your wrongs and warmly animated with all your resentments The author of the present calamity is my brother but I am sure you cannot think me the sister of his crime nor imagine that because I am allied to him in blood I must likewise be allied to the guilty part of his character Look at me I beseech you with complacency and tell me that my presence is not unwelcome in the country  This address there was no possibility of resistingMr Mildmay's heart was melted and in spite of all his pride he took hold of her hand with an air of  the greatest respect held it to his lips and endeavoured to make an apologyA rising flood of grief however choaked the passage of his words he broke into a sob of inexpressible affliction and hastily retired out of the room You know Harold how readily the mother as you call it comes into my eyes you know besides that I am twenty good years older than you and have been once a father I could not therefore stand the excess of poor Mr Mildmay's emotion my handkerchief was out in an instant and notwithstanding my utmost efforts to suppress my concern I blubbered so heartily as to be under a necessity of retiring also unacquainted as I was with the house and ridiculous as I must have made myself to the servants As to Mrs Mildmay nothing can be more tender or affecting than the reception of your sisterThe two ladies at their first meeting remained  clasped for some moments in each other's arms each unable to speak a syllable and both giving a very copious freedom to their tears  When we had all a little recovered ourselves and taken a dish of chocolate lady Haversham with her usual delicacy began to enter upon the business of her journey lamenting the colonel's wound in terms the most friendly and hoping that the unfortunate affair at Reading would not prevent the possibility of a reconciliation between the two families she then set forth your extreme contrition for the part you had acted by Louisa and insinuated that she had a letter from you in her pocket which if Mr Mildmay would take the trouble of reading she was certain would in some measure lessen the severity of his present indignation Mr Mildmay upon this took fire swearing with great  vehemence that so far from consenting to a reconciliation he never would enjoy a moment's peace of mind till you were sacrificed to his vengeance and that if he but knew where you were then concealed he would himself old as he was call you to an instant account for murdering the reputation of his family  This was a sally of passion which we naturally expected and therefore did not once interrupt him till it was entirely exhausted lady Haversham then resumed the subject and begged of him to consider that she was now talking as much for the sake of his happiness as for the happiness of her brother"Indeed my dear Mr Mildmay" continued she  if I was not sensible that the present calamity under which we all labour requires great allowances I should be apt to think you almost  as culpable as my brother himself Does it follow because he has grossly injured the honour of your house that you yourself should do it still greater injuries or can it admit of a moment's debate which is the most proper course to followthat which will recover the tranquility of your family or that which will expose it to an additional distress  If calling my brother to an account for his misbehaviour could be attended with any advantages I should not wonder so greatly at your resentment but when to do that as has been already unhappily the case the safety of a dear and deserving son must be hazarded and when even if he should kill his antagonist he must forfeit his own life to the violated laws of his countryI say when these things are considered and when it is  moreover recollected that though the lenity of the laws should spare the life of your son it can by no means restore your peace I am in hopes that your own good sense will induce you to abate the warmth of your indignation and that you will prefer a certain felicity to a precarious revengeJustice you see by the colonel's unfortunate wound may sometimes be unattended with success and should you still prosecute a quarrel with a man who desires who supplicates who implores to make every reparation that  can  be made the world will think your resentment carried to an unreasonable length and be apt even to rejoice should you meet with any new calamity  To the arguments which I have already offered my dear Mr Mildmay I have another very forcible  plea to add which I am sure must operate on your tenderness as a husband and upon your justice as a manTurn Sir to this venerable this excellent woman the companion of your youth the partner of your sorrows the possessor of your heartsee where she is sinking under the sternness of your resolution and bleeding with an apprehension of future misfortunes as well as with a sensibility of the present distressShe Sir has a mother's claim in the son whose life you are so willing to expose Do not drive her into absolute distractionHer anguish is already excessive and her death must be inevitable if you think of washing away her daughter's stain with nothing but the blood of her son On my knees therefore Mr Mildmay  and down the wonderful woman dropped  let me beg of you to think of a reconciliation  My brother is deeply wounded by the consciousness of his own guilt and will I am certain from motives of gratitude as well as affection make a good son and a deserving husband Do not my dear Mr Mildmay because one affliction has interrupted your happiness rashly devote yourself to wretchedness for life but rather seize the best means of dispelling the cloud which at present overcasts your peace and endeavour at recovering the genial sunshine of that tranquility which has been so recently and so fatally lost  Mr Mildmay who all the time of your sister's kneeling in vain attempted to raise her up seemed greatly struck with what she said but though his reason was convinced his pride nevertheless held an obstinate struggle and he several times attempted to quit the  roomLady Haversham and I as often prevented him from going out we prevailed upon him with difficulty to hear the principal part of your letter read and Mrs Mildmay herself kneeling to him and in very pathetic terms requesting him to oblige lady Haversham he was at last overcome and consented that you might be sent for as soon as we pleased desiring only that the ceremony might be delayed till the recovery of the colonel  When we had thus settled the material affair our conversation naturally turned upon the colonel's case and the abilities of his attendantsMr Mildmay said that though the wound at first appeared extremely dangerous as it was very near the groin nevertheless the surgeons now told him that there was but little doubt of a fine cure provided he escaped a fever  "And this" said the old gentleman  I am no way uneasy about as the weather is very cold and his pulse so very temperate but  added he  suppose you go and see him there is nobody with him but Miss Beauclerk and he had so fine a morning's sleep that we shan't in the least fatigue him with our company  We accordingly went and were received as I expected with great coldness though with great civilityThe sight of people so very near to you naturally hurting that impatience which we all labour under where we have received any thing which looks like a disgrace Lady Haversham however went up to him as if she had been his sister and expressed her concern for the cause of his misfortune with so unaffected an air of cordiality as reconciled him a little to his visitors We then acquainted him with the business of our journey talked matters over again and  read all your letter but that part where the provision for his sister is mentioned he was extremely attentive to your account of the duel and begged more than once to hear a repetition of some particular passages When I had done he paused a little and said you were  very  exact in the relation and that had he imagined you were actuated by a sincere concern for your indiscretion and were really going up to town with a view of entreating Louisa's forgiveness he would not have been so rash "But" says he  my heart was in the matchand to find every thing broken off while I was flattering my imagination with the happiness my family was to possesto find the rupture also so dishonourable to us and to think that a sister who was my principal pride should be guilty of such a crime made me absolutely mad so that I almost wonder how I refrained from  shooting Sir Robert through the head before I even offered him the choice of a pistol  Notwithstanding the colonel's seeming frankness I could easily see he was secretly dissatisfied that he had not been consulted by his father in the conclusion of our accommodation When the old gentlemen told him what he had consented to he was extremely grave and observed  That to be sure it was better to settle matters any how than to think of going farther with family resentments  The tone and look with which he delivered this were visibly sarcastic and I could however readily perceive he somewhat disconcerted his father We took no notice of the expression however lady Haversham thinking with me that those may be allowed to complain a little who feel a great deal Dinner being ready by this  time we took our leave of the colonel and sat down in a very sociable manner to a very good repast Your sister was all life and Mrs Mildmay who has been a very fine woman was animated with a chearfulness that really filled me with pleasure as from the character lady Haversham gave me of her worth I could not but share very sensibly in her afflictions  In short we were all extremely happy but Miss Beauclerk This young lady who ought to be the gayest person in company was remarkably thoughtful and reserved she scarcely touched a morsel of any thing and even more than once let a sigh escape her pretty audible she is a very fine girl indeed Harold and if she is but half as good as she is handsome it would be ten thousand pities that any thing should give her the least uneasiness You cannot conceive how  excessively I am taken with herthere is so much real good sense so much genuine delicacy and so much true benevolence in every word and action that was it possible for me ever to marry a second time or possible for her to look on such an old fellow I really believe she would be the woman in the world whom I should first think ofbut what have I do with the sex In my youth I lost the woman of my heartWhen I last saw her she was just such another young creature as this Miss Beauclerk all beauty and beneficence all sensibility and love Miss Beauclerk has in fact her very form her very face the same irresistable sweetness of voice and elegance of manner which once distinguished my Nancy and which though long since buried in the grave have been continually present to my imagination Be good natured Harold and bear with me a little on this tender subjectYou  know I seldom break out and therefore may now and then be entitled to a little indulgence especially as I am always so ready to put up with your everlasting impertinence  The ladies retiring a little after dinner and leaving Mr Mildmay and I to chat over a bottle of Burgundy I took the liberty to make some enquiry about Miss Beauclerk assuring the old gentleman that I was strongly prepossessed in her favour  Why truly Mr Melmoth  returned he  I don't know a sweeter better tempered girl in the world than this young lady my Louisa and she contracted an intimacy at the boarding school when they were both very young and have ever since been remarkably distinguished for the closeness of their friendship the one never knowing joy or a sorrow in which the other did not  immediately enhance the satisfaction or mitigate the distress I am sure in the late unhappy affair my daughter's misfortune affected Miss Beauclerk as closely as if Louisa had actually been her sisterDuring the time of her being here she has applied herself with such assiduity to comfort and take care of my poor wife that I consider her as a principal instrument in Mrs Mildmay's preservationHer mother Sir lost her husband while Harriot was yet an infant at the breast he died it seems in the EastIndies and left the good lady in such very slender circumstances that had not a relation of her own who died also about the same time left her a fortune of l in the funds she must have gone into some little way of business for the maintenance of herself and her daughter Upon the interest of this sum she keeps a carriage and  has a most delightful retirement about thirty miles offWhat is extremely remarkable is that though she was not much above twenty when her husband died and when she came into possession of this fortune yet so far from acting like the generality of women and listening to the addresses of every coxcomb who might have designs either upon her person or her purse she retired immediately from London to the spot I have been speaking of and there continued ever since confining her visits within a very narrow circle and dedicating her attention to the education of her daughter Within a mile of her house my Louisa was at school when a child and the intimacy between the little ones naturally creating an acquaintance between the parents Mrs Beauclerk and our family have been upon the most unreserved footing of friendship these  sixteen years and I dare say shall continue in friendship till the end of our lives as there is but one circumstance which can possibly disturb the harmony of our correspondence  As it would have been extremely rude in a stranger to ask what this circumstance was I did not interrupt Mr Mildmay nevertheless I was lucky enough in the naturally communicativeness of his temper to have my curiosity gratified his heart was now open and he considered me as a good natured friendly man who might be trusted with a secret drawing his chair therefore closer to mine and lowering his voice he proceeded to unbosom himself to the following purport  You must know Mr Melmoth that during the intimacy between Mrs Beauclerk's family and mine I have  discovered that my son entertains very favourable sentiments of her daughter and between ourselves I can see plainly enough that her daughter is no way disinclined to my son I have been a young fellow myself Mr Melmoth and in my timeyou understand mebut that is nothing to the purposeAs I was saying this mutual good opinion between Harry and Miss Beauclerk is a thing which gives me no little uneasinessthe young lady to be sure possesses a very high place in my esteem and I don't know a woman in the kingdom whom I should be better pleased to have for a daughter but the misfortune is she does not carry sufficient weight of metal and I have some family views in my head which though I am pretty well in the world require a considerable addition of fortune My house Mr Melmoth is a very antient one  there have been more than two peerages in it and I have myself some expectation of a title Now Sir as the support of such a dignity cannot allow me to marry my son to a woman of little fortune on this account I am greatly concerned that any secret correspondence should be carried on between him and Miss Beauclerk I should be very sorry to oppose his inclinations or to wound her sensibility but you know the raising of one's family is a very essential point and that ridiculous as a coronet may appear to some people it is nevertheless entitled to priviledges which are far from being disagreeableThis is not alla noble lord in the neighbourhood who is able to give his daughter a prodigious sum of money has lately intimated a desire of uniting his family with mine and I think so very well of the affair that I  mentioned it yesterday to my son when I found him launching out into some passionate encomiums on Miss Beauclerk  Mr Mildmay pausing in this place I could not help observing that though the plan which was thus laid down for the aggrandization of his family might in itself be extremely right nevertheless if his son entertained a cordial affection for the young lady the possession of her hand might be more conducive to his happiness than the possession of a title and that therefore it might be difficult to make him sacrifice the interest of his heart even to gratify the laudable ambition of his fatherBut the old gentleman stopped me short by declaring He believed the colonel would do any thing to oblige him "However" says he  if I should be unhappily disappointed of his obedience in the matter we have been talking of I know how  to punish his obstinacy when I come to dispose of my fortune  Here our conversation ended for the ladies coming in we were obliged to talk of something else though I should have told you that Mr Mildmay more than once insinuated a fear that his lady secretly approved of the passion subsisting between Miss Beauclerk and the colonel  I could moralize in this place Sir Robert on the preposterous behaviour of those fathers who are willing to give their children every thing but happiness Reflections of this nature however are too common to be useful and it would be just as new to tell you that the parts of a day consist of twentyfour hours as to tell you that the very fondness of such fathers is the most insupportable of all tyrannies Poor Miss Beauclerkand is the tawdry gewgaw of a coronet to be put in competition  with the charms of exalted virtue elevated sense and sweetness ineffable But love would be too exquisite an enjoyment Harold had not Providence wisely thrown these bars in our way and tempered the inexpressible raptures which it bestows with some occasional mixtures of infelicity  Lady Haversham just now called me aside and hinted that she had spoken to Mrs Mildmay relative to some expressions which Louisa had dropped in your sister's last interview with her indicating the most positive determination of never seeing you more Mrs Mildmay is to write to her on this subject and therefore she can but little doubt of Louisa's altering her determination the resolution of her family in your favour was the principal point to gain and since we could work upon their pride there can be no doubt of influencing  her sensibility A woman Harold can forgive every thing where she really loves the ladies have a softness about them which turns even contempt into kindness and gives the tenderness of their hearts a constant superiority over the goodness of their understandings I should be sorry however that all coxcombs were for reducing this precept into practice as we have already but too many fools among the fair who are desirous of stamping their weakness with the immediate image of destiny and solicitous to call that an absolute decree of fate which arises from their own apparent want of resolution  I have been this moment at a consultation of colonel Mildmay's surgeons and have the very great pleasure of informing you that he is entirely out of dangerYou may therefore by the next Helvoetsluys packet make a trip  to Harwich since at the utmost it can't be above twelve hours from Rotterdam to Helvoet If you should stop at the Hague pray call at Fitzpatrick's in the Hoogstraat who is as modest as sensible and as well behaved a man as I ever saw at the head of a tavern and who without mentioning any body's name will treat you with the utmost civility if you know the man already my character will be needless if you do not you will find a very good house and so far be obliged to me for this accommodation  As we have done our business at Mildmay Hall your sister and I shall set out for London in order to wait upon Louisa and acquaint her with the determination of her father Mrs Mildmay has a letter to send by us to her daughter which will put a finishing hand to the reconciliation so that Bob you  may look upon the whole affair as concluded to your wish yet it is ten to one that now happiness is again within your reach but what you strive to start difficulties and endeavour to destroy all that lady Haversham and I have been labouring to bring about with such an unremitting degree of fedulity  Take care however dear Harold how you act at this time and do not idly play the prodigal with your own happinessYouth can never excuse a bad action though it may extenuate the indiscretion of a foolish one and the man who is twice guilty of the same crime is in much more danger of making himself abhorred than in rendering others wretched or contemptible take the hint therefore Bob and believe me with the utmost cordiality  Your real Friend C MELMOTH  LETTER XVI  Mr  MELMOTH  in Continuation to Sir  ROBERT HAROLD  Dear  HAROLD  IF you have not yet set out from Rotterdam you may as well continue where you are or go to any other part of the continent which is best adapted to your inclination England is not a place which I would have you return to yet awhile if you really love Miss Mildmay and would be concerned to find her actually allied to infamy and prostitution  Your sister and I arrived in town this morning and unable to contain the satisfaction with which our bosoms naturally swelled at your approaching felicity  we immediately drove to Louisa's with a view of dispelling her unhappiness by acquainting her with the fortunate reconciliation effected between her and her familyBut judge our astonishment when instead of meeting with her Mrs Darnel came down stairs with an air of the utmost affliction and informed us that Miss Mildmay had eloped in a postchaise and six with a gentleman richly dressed the preceding evening  Having no authority to watch her motions  said Mrs Darnel  and imagining from her specious air of penitence if I even had that every attention of that nature would be utterly unnecessary I went to hear a lecture at our parishchurch after tea never once dreaming that during my absence she would think of running away from a house into which she had entered a voluntary visitor and in which there was no likelihood of her  receiving the smallest disgustYou may however easily guess my consternation when my maid Jenny the moment I came home ran up and informed me that Miss Mildmay had gone off with a gentleman in a postchaise I naturally concluded that had it been any relation I should have received some notice of her intended departure and therefore as she went away in so unaccountable a manner I as naturally ascribed her flight to some preconcerted design especially as Jenny informed me that a gentleman in brown and gold had for two or three nights been seen to hang about the house and to peep in at the windows with a degree of breeding much below the elegance of his appearanceNotwithstanding these unpromising accounts I nevertheless sat up till four o'clock rather hoping than expecting the unfortunate young  lady's return but alas I might have sat up till this moment without reaping the least advantage from my anxiety or my fatigue she never once approached the house and which way she has gone I am by no means able to conjecture  And this Sir Robert is the end of all our expectations For my own part strenuously solicitous as I was but a few hours ago in her favour I now sincerely congratulate with you on your fortunate escape I now begin to think you were right in rejecting her from the first and am perfectly satisfied that the error which I thought the effect of her partiality for you was nothing more than the result of her own constitution Lady Haversham however will not subscribe to my opinion of her levity tho' she knows not any cause to which  her elopement can be so probably attributedNevertheless she thinks all enquiry after her needless and almost wishes that she had not taken the journey into Oxfordshire  For this new disappointment Mr Melmoth  says she  will come with additional weight upon her family and if it does not entirely kill the poor mother it will certainly drive her distracted  Mrs Darnel who appears to be a decent well behaved woman notwithstanding your suspicions is to send down an account of Louisa's elopement to Mildmay Hall What consequences it may produce there I know not but of this I am certain that you have every reason in nature to be happy in the timely discovery of her levityHad such a discovery been made after your marriage with her I suppose the result would  have been her immediate death and your certain executionYou would have sacrificed her instantly to your fury and your life would have been the penalty of your rashness Return thanks therefore to Providence for having such a fortunate escape and do not meanly regret the loss of a woman whom you know to be guilty when you could so readily give her up at a time that you thought her innocence in a manner unquestionable But you see Harold that innocence like contrition may be easily affected and that those may seem the most strenuous votaries of virtue who are in fact the least unhappy at its loss  If any thing new should occur before you think of returning home you need not doubt of my readiness to communicate it Lady Haversham is extremely affected with Louisa's behaviour but  attempts very little if any thing in her defence she sends her best wishes to you by this letter and desires me to assure you that she is as much your affectionate sister as I am  Your faithful Friend C MELMOTH  LETTER XVII Miss  HARRIOT BEAUCLERK  to her Mother  Dear  MAMA  A DISTRESS of a more piercing nature than ever has fallen upon this unhappy family You will scarcely conceive and I have scarcely power to inform you but my wretched friend Miss Mildmay while lady Haversham was down here as I told you in my last letter settling every thing to our wishes and restoring every body to peace eloped from Mrs Darnel's in London with a strange gentleman in a chariot and six while her cousin was at church and where she is gone there is no likelihood of discovering Mrs Darnel's account of this affair reached us this morning  and from the pain which I know your own worthy heart will feel on this melancholy occasion you may easily imagine what an effect it had on her poor father and mother upon her brother and myself I would if possible have kept it from the colonel as I thought the knowledge of so fatal an accident might materially retard his recoveryBut Mr Mildmay's rage was too violent and the venerable lady's anguish too excessive to admit of such a salutary secrecy so that in less than five minutes he was made acquainted with the minutest circumstances and the agitation of his mind has been so prodigious ever since that his physicians begin to be apprehensive about the consequences  Indeed my dear mama I am inexpressibly wretched from the part which I am to act in the general calamityevery body turns to me for consolation  when my own bosom is torn with a thousand distressesand expects that I should be able to administer comfort when I am equally if not more miserable myself You my dearest mama must sooth my afflictionsYou must enable me by the magnanimity of your example and the wisdom of your advice to bear up against this unexpected stroke of misfortune which now falls on me with an aggravated heaviness as it comes in the hour of my utmost security and invades me in the most unsuspecting moment of my hopesI was feasting my imagination madam with numberless prospects of future felicity and preparing my heart for nothing but happiness and youWhen alas the golden scene is instantly ravished from my eyes and the whole void as instantly filled up with disappointment and despair  When I consider this unaccountable step of Louisa's I am lost in perplexity and doubtMrs Darnel's letter acquaints us that she went away of her own accord that she was not carried off by force but that she absolutely eloped and the maid even describes the gentleman with whom she went as a tall handsome man drest in brown richly laced with gold she says also that he was a very fair man and wore a bob wig All this is mighty oddI have known her from her infancy up have shared every secret of her heart and never conceived that she entertained the least affection for any body but Sir Robert HaroldHim it cannot be as by Mr Melmoth's account he set out for Holland the moment after the unhappy duel between him and the colonel and besides he has a complexion remarkably black and wears his own hair When I put all these  things together my dear mama I am astonishedLouisa would hardly go off with a man for whom she felt no affection and the whole tenor of her life has been so generously frank and open and so repugnant to every thing like hypocrisy or artifice that I could stake my existence Sir Robert is the only man for whom she cherished a favourable sentimentBesides madam if you were to see the letter which she sent her mother you would be satisfied that notwithstanding her unhappy lapse with that gentleman she is infinitely above the appearance of dissimulationHer error is there acknowleged in such forcible terms and lamented with such a sense of unextenuating penitence that her faults almost render her amiable and the only emotions which we feel are those of pity and admiration  For these reasons I am positive my amiable friend can be no way depraved in her principles yet on the other hand Mrs Darnel is a woman of known sobriety and character is received among people of the first distinction in consequence of her good behaviour and she mentions Louisa's elopement with so positive a degree of certainty that there can be no possibility of disputing the factGod grant that this contradiction may be happily reconciled My own soul is not dearer in my estimation than the happiness of Miss Mildmay and I don't know that I could be able to survive any instance of her premediated unworthinessPremeditated unworthiness No my ever amiable Louisa you are incapable of a deliberate guilt and the bare supposition was a blasphemy against the purity of our mutual affectionThe heart which can question the virtue of a friend till it  argues upon absolute conviction is a traitor to the cause of amity the most alarming appearance should never shake the confidence of our friendship and though in every thing else a nice combination of accidents may justify a doubt yet here we ought never to hesitate upon circumstances nor to lessen in our regards till conjecture is evidently lost in certainty  These arguments my dear mama I have repeatedly urged in the present state of things to the good Mrs MildmayBut she shakes her head when I want her to reduce the precept into practice and while the large drops course one another down her venerable cheeks she tells me the sentiment sounds prettily enough upon the ear but is little calculated to convince the understanding I wish my dear mama you could come over to us there never was a  greater necessity for your supporting presence than nowMrs Mildmay seems in a very declining way and her situation alarms me the more strongly as she does every thing in her power to put on an air of the utmost composure and serenity  As you my dear mama are one of those excellent women who bring up a daughter rather in a state of respectful familiarity with you than endeavour to establish an authority by keeping her in a distant degree of abject subjectionAs you are generous enough to receive those instances of confidence as a favour which you can command as a right and can blend all the tenderness of the parent with all the freedom of the friend I am enabled to talk to you on a subject which few young women ever care to mention to a mother though a mother's  ear is the properest by much for a business of such importance  You have often my dear madam kindly hinted your apprehension that the merits of colonel Mildmay were making too deep an impression on my heart and that I should by all means resist every impulse of a tender nature in his favour as there was but too much reason to apprehend that the disparity of our fortunes would be a material bar to our union notwithstanding the harmony subsisting so long between our two families Your advice my ever honoured mama I was convinced was perfectly just neverthelessbut why should I think of concealing any thing from my best friendfrom the only person in the world who by nature and inclination must be the readiest to rejoice at my felicity or to participate in my distressYes madam I must own  in spite of all your judicious precautions my heart was insensibly engaged and I loved before I was aware that the colonel had any other place in my affections than what was due to the brother of LouisaYou madam I am sure must have seen upon several occasions what an awkward constraint I have laboured under when I have been in his companyYour penetration could not be eluded though I then fondly thought nobody could see into my sentiments and piqued myself upon the address with which I behaved in so very critical a situation  Indeed the respectful tenderness with which the colonel all along treated me contributed not a little to raise him in my esteemUpon a thousand little occasions he gave me proof of his good opinion though he never made me the most distant tendre of his heart but  judging of his sentiments by my own or possibly believing because I wished it might be so that he really saw me with more than a common degree of friendship I suffered the flame imperceptibly to spread and was solicitous only of concealing my weakness from his observation but matters madam have at last come to something of a crisis and I have the satisfaction of  knowing  that my tenderness is at least returned whether I am ever blest with the object of it or not  The second day after the colonel's coming down wounded before he was yet pronounced out of danger he sent his compliments to me and begged I would favour him with a visit as he had something of importance to acquaint me with The light in which I was considered by every body in the family joined to the nature of his situation would  have made it affectation to the last degree had I not immediately complied with his requestI therefore went and the attendants being ordered out of the room he begged of me to seat myself close to the bedside where taking hold of my hand and desiring I would not be offended at what he was going to say he went on to the following purport  The distresses of my mind and the anguish of my wound rendering my recovery extremely precarious I have presumed Miss Beauclerk to beg your ear upon a subject which though very near my heart I would not for particular reasons enter upon was there a certainty either that medicine or time could do me any essential benefit As it is therefore doubtful how long I may be in a capacity of delivering myself intelligibly I have determined to seize the present opportunity  of opening my mind since was I to leave the world without telling you how dear you have always been to my soul my parting moments would be imbittered with an anxiety that must render the natural gloominess of death inconceivably afflictingO Miss Beauclerk from the first moment I beheld you young as we both were I loved youEvery day as you rose into perfection I felt an encrease of passion though I strove to conceal my sentiments very carefully from the world as I saw but too many difficulties in the way of our union had I even merit enough to solicit with a likelihood of success In short madam I found my father's ambition was utterly unfavourable to my hopesAnd I saw that you had too much dignity of disposition to come into a family that would look upon your alliance in a disagreeable light or  shew a less regard to the invaluable requisites of beauty and virtue than to the infinitely meaner circumstances of ancestry and fortuneThese madam were the motives of my silence and silence however mortifying in my situation was at least the most prudent part if it was not the most generous I have always looked with detestation on those men who though they were conscious of some family consideration that must prevent them from accepting the honour of a lady's hand were nevertheless insolent enough or cruel enough to aim at engaging her affectionsOn these accounts I say madam had I even reason to think you would have blest me with a reciprocal esteem I had avoided the presumption or the baseness of a declaration since as there was no prospect of leading you into any certain state of felicity it  would be infamy itself to think of plunging you into distress  O mama what a mind has this manHere however he was obliged to rest himself a little while the only reply I could make was with my tears  After a pause of some moments he resumed the affecting subject and thus continued his discourse  I do not now my ever adorable Miss Beauclerk meanly intend by an address to your generosity to make any interest with your heartYour esteem I should be proud of possessing but thus hovering as I may say on the verge of eternity I should be sorry for your own sake was I honoured with your loveMay that madam be reserved for some fortunate man whose merits are sufficient to justify your choice and whose situation will not create any  impediments in the road of your happinessHad I been destined for such a blessingbut why do I harrow up my own reflection or wound your sensibilityI know the ineffable sweetness of that temper and have seen numberless occasions where a tale of calamity has deluged it in tearsFrom an ungenerous lamentation I shall therefore proceed to business and if I can but gain your acquiescence to a last request the hand of death will lye light upon my brows and I shall go out of the world in a comparative state of content  O my dear mama how I trembled at the solemnity the tenderness of his mannerthe dangerous extremity to which I saw him reduced In short as he himself phrased it very happily the distresses of his mind and the anguish of his wound interested me so much in  his favour that I never thought of interrupting him but continued one passive hand all the time in his the other being employed in holding up my handkerchief to my eyes which were by this time quite red and swollen with my emotionAfter another pause to recover strength he thus went on  The request which I have to make my dear Miss Beauclerk may perhaps be inconsistent with your very refined notions of delicacybut consider that some indulgences are due to your friends and that I am entitled to your good wishes though I have no claim to your love by these wishes therefore by the generosity of your temper by all your regards in this world and by all your hopes in the next I conjure you to oblige meO Harriot I would die for you shew me therefore one little mark of  esteem and as a token of your friendship only accept of this paperIt is an instrument which has been executed above two years and by all that's holy whether you accept of it or not it shall never be revoked  O good God my dear mama it was his will hiswillhad the universe been offered me I could not touch itmy sensibility now became audible  I quite sobbed yet scarcely knowing what I did I disengaged my hand from his and falling down upon my knees by the bedside cried out  O spare me Sirspare methis is too muchindeed it is  At the same time sinking my face upon the bed cloaths wholly unable to look up as if I was conscious of some manifest improprietyTo be sure madam it was very wrong in me to let him see how much I was distressedBut what could I doConsider  his tenderness for me and then think of his melancholy situation In short my ever revered mama consider also that I had sentiments of a softer nature than gratitude or friendship to occasion my agitation and then you will be much more apt to pity than to condemn it  The colonel madam seemed greatly affected by my emotion and by endeavouring to assist me up occasioned me to rise considerably sooner than what I would have done had he made use of the most earnest entreaties for the moment I found him exerting himself to that purpose I recollected his wound and was instantly in my former situation notwithstanding my cheeks were visibly studded over with tears and notwithstanding my perturbation was so excessive as to furnish a man of his fine sense with some reasonable suspicions of  the causeBe this as it may he pressed my hand to his lips with an air of inexpressible tenderness and apologizing for the uneasiness which he had given me he continued to enforce his request with so much vehemence and to declare in so positive a manner that he could never enjoy a moment's peace unless I gratified him in this point that I told him I would consider the matter a little farther and give him an answer in two or three days  Two or three days Harriot  replied he with a mixture of sorrow and surprize  Two or three days Suppose that in this time I should be taken offYour answer then will be a little of the latest and I shall go out of the world without my principal consolationThe thing and the time require an immediate determination and my reason for mentioning it to you at all is to prevent the rashness of your  generosityI know that should I die without exacting a sacred promise from you to enjoy yourself this last little mark of my affection you would think it an indispensable obligation to give every thing back to my familyBut my family is already too rich for its own happiness and if I am to be removed will have still less occasion for its extraordinary opulencePromise therefore Harriot solemnly promise in the presence of that God who sees with how aking a sense of tenderness I love you that you will according to the true purport of my request accept of this testamentIn it I have not forgot some proper remembrances for my father and mother and because I knew you would receive more pleasure on that account I have not ordered any erasure to be made in an article that relates  to the wretched Louisa Talking my dear Miss Beauclerk I find becomes inconvenient to meIndulge me therefore at once and consider that to be generous upon some occasions may be the highest instance of barbarity  Whether I was right or wrong my dear mama you must determine but unable to resist his solicitations any longer I took the paper with a reluctant hand and in my confusion putting it into my bosom instead of my pocket the colonel seemed transported at the action kissed my hand a thousand times and declared he could now quit the world with content All the time I was sinking under a load of equal awkwardness and anxiety till the surgeons happily coming in gave me an opportunity of retiring and unlading the fullness of my heart in a fresh shower of tears  The good Mrs Mildmay knowing that I had been a considerable while in the colonel's apartment came up to my room and finding my eyes extremely red she threw her kind arms round my neck and calling me by the tenderest appellations you can conceive told me she had been long sensible that her son was passionately in love with me and that she also had been long sensible notwithstanding my delicate reserve so she was pleased to say that I considered him with an eye of affection  But my sweet girl my dear Harriot  continued she finding me distressed and astonished at this information  don't imagine I have seen this mutual regard with any other regret but my fear that Mr Mildmay would not be propitious to the happiness of his son for my own part I am so convinced of your worth that the colonel has an additional share in my regard on  account of his attachment to you and could I but prevail upon his father I should still have a daughter no less dear in my estimation than the miserable LouisaBut my love this familypride so runs away with my poor Mr Mildmay's good sense that I despair of making him sacrifice the suggestions of his vanity to the sentiments of his reason his mind has been always taken up with an idea of making his children great and so he could gain them an empty title he payed but little consideration to what might secure their felicity  And thus my dear mama are matters at present situated and thus all the time that I have been supposing my affection for the colonel a secret this excellent woman has seen into the most latent recesses of my heart and even kindly sympathized with my anxiety  You may be sure madam that after this excessive goodness had a little emboldened me I made her acquainted with every circumstance which passed with the colonel though I scarcely knew how to mention the affair of the will as I thought she might fancy me on that account an enemy though an involuntary one to the interest of her familyBut Mrs Mildmay madam is a counterpart of yourself she has a soul incapable of listening to any little considerations and observes the practice of generosity too much in her own conduct not to love it in other people'sAs I went on with my story she was gradually affectedher heart labouredand her eye rose in perfect unison to mine and upon the conclusion of my narrative "Harriot" says she  the more I know you the more I wish you for my daughterMy son has pleased me exceedingly by his conduct on this  occasion and I think you would have acted rather below the dignity of your character had you not condescended to oblige him but notwithstanding the little likelihood of present appearances I have yet a dawn of hope which beams across my bosom and assures me you shall one day be happy with the colonelHad the unfortunate LouisaBut why do I afflict myself with recollecting a creature who now has really dishonoured usHer scandalous elopement in the very moment of her seeming penitence argues an uncommon turpitude of sentiment and shews that her first indiscretion was not so much the consequence of an extravagant tenderness for her lover as the result of her natural depravity God will I hope however forgive the unhappy wretch her guilt and mercifully incline to swell the  enormity of her crime by putting down her death to my account  My unhappy LouisaYou may be sure my dear mama I did what I possibly could to alleviate the distresses of the venerable Mrs Mildmay at the same time that I said every thing which could extenuate the seeming misbehaviour of my friend the good old lady seemed willing to catch at any twig of probability which might keep her hopes entirely from sinking but alas the fatal force of appearances rendering the very strongest quite unequal to the task she changed the conversation and asked me if I had any scruple to shew her the colonel's willI replied that I could have no scruple to shew her any thing as I was sensible she could never have a desire that was not founded on the strictest propriety and therefore immediately produced it from my bosom  "My dear" says she  you are very good and yet be assured I should not make this request on any account was I not convinced that you wish as cordially as myself that the testator's recovery may prevent the will from being ever carried into execution  Indeed madam returned I"Harriot" interrupted she  let minds that doubt each other's candour break out into professions of regard and sentimental exclamations it is below us however my love to enter into a vindication of our motives since any argument to prove them just would be tacitly to acknowlege that it was possible for them to be otherwise We will not my dearest girl even wrong the rectitude of our own principles by implication nor be the first to deny ourselves that merit which has been hitherto granted us by every  body else  So saying she opened the will which is very short containing little more than a general reason for the colonel's appointing me his heir and leaving a miniature of himself set in diamonds to his mother his horses arms and watch to his father his library to Louisa a diamond ring to yourself some trifling remembrances to other friends and his cloaths and about two hundred pounds among the servants  Short as the will was my dear mama I could scarcely stand the shock of reading it there is something so awful in a will you know even where one's self is not concerned but when it is made by a person for whom one entertains an esteem when a partiality is absolutely shewn in one's own favour and when there is another person by who is infinitely more entitled to a preference it  must be inexpressibly distressing to us if we are not wholly divested of sentiment and delicacy You cannot therefore imagine my confusion when I found the colonel had left me two thousand pounds in money the magnificent service of plate which had been his godfather Harley's and the Buckinghamshire estate which is seven hundred pounds a year and which was formerly his great aunt Ingoldsby's Mrs Mildmay saw my anxiety and kindly pitied it restoring me the paper and acknowleging she had been to blame in suffering her curiosity to carry her so far  But my dear Harriot  says she  a mother will pay but little attention to decorum in any thing which concerns the conduct of her children  After this we had a long conversation about the colonel in which Mrs Mildmay seemed so highly pleased with his behaviour to me that I was somewhat reassured and  had fresh opportunities of admiring the greatness of her generosity Notwithstanding this the circumstances of the will rendered me excessive awkward till we were flattered with some certain hopes of the colonel's recovery From that moment I breathed a freeer air and considered myself as less an interloper in the family he is now thank God in a very fine way and has borne the fresh shock of his sister's abrupt departure with a much greater share of fortitude than could be expected  And now my dear mama how do you do and what do you say to the boldness of your girl in thus presuming to talk to you upon such a point as the foregoing subject Do you condemn her of temerity or approve her for candour do you imagine that she has grown forward on your indulgence or do you think that she has made only a  proper use of your tenderness and treated you with the openness which is doubly your due from the closeness of your relation and the greatness of your indulgence I wish I knew your sentiments for as you have always studied to anticipate every desire of mine I should be a monster indeed if I hesitated but an instant to comply with your inclinations The whole family here my dear mama are impatient to see youMrs Mildmay longs she says to talk with you about the colonel and you know whothe old gentleman repeatedly tells me that the value of a friend is only to be experienced in the day of adversity and the colonel hopes that nothing at the Hall has given you any cause of disgust Come to us then dear madam for your company is greatly wanted and by none you may believe so much as your daughter the colonel's tenderness oppresses me the amiable  Louisa's fate distracts me and Mrs Mildmay's goodness is insupportable Come then madam to her rescue the arms of maternal affection are always fraught with peace and if they bring comfort in proportion to their benignity who is so likely to receive the balm of consolation as  Your ever dutiful and affectionate Daughter HAR BEAUCLERK  PS  When I write to my dear mama I never know where to leave offI should have told you that Butler a very sensible fellow who is servant to the colonel has been sent away to London to make a minute enquiry at Mrs Darnel's in relation to LouisaGod grant the honest man may succeed for if friendship is liable to be attended with such anguish  as I feel upon this dear but unfortunate girl's account I must for the future avoid every acquaintance with the most amiable part of my sex for fear of being plunged into continual calamities  LETTER XVIII  Sir  ROBERT HAROLD  to  CHARLES MELMOTH  Esq  VIENNA  August    IT is in vain my dear Melmoth I find for your unfortunate friend to continue any longer abroad the change of country in no manner tends to alleviate the distresses of his bosom nor erases in the least the form of that amiable wretch that Miss Mildmay from his recollection If possible she gives him every moment an additional pang and till he becomes utterly deprived both of memory and sense he must feel the sharpest affliction on her account  In reality Charles though it is now twelve months since the infamous flight  of that unfortunate girl I am rather more wretched than everShe is continually present to my imagination and I find in spite of my pride and my reason that she holds an absolute empire over my heart and that I must actually cease to live before I can actually cease to love her Don't despise me however my dear MelmothI blush for my own baseness in suffering the abandoned woman even to steal a single instant upon my thoughts but alas the more I would banish her the more forcible she returns and I am distracted with a perpetual round of tenderness and shame of pity and indignation wherever I go I am torn with a variety of opposite passions and to use the language of poor Sciolto  All within is anarchy and uproar"  How Melmoth when I received your first letter at Rotterdam did my soul exult in the expectation of being completely happy with Louisa The most distant insinuation of that delicacy which originally caused all our misfortunes was then argued down into silence and the universal joy which I thought would flow from a reconciliation added to the tumultuous tide of transport that swelled about my heart from a still more natural cause gave me an absolute foretaste of elysiumBut Providence thought proper by an accident which I considered at that time as the greatest of all calamities to snatch me from the smiling destruction and graciously counteracted the warmth of my wishes to preserve me from everlasting disgraceO Melmoth had I been married to her before this fortunate discovery of her infamythink what would have been the consequenceTo the remotest  confine of the world I had pursued her and as Othello says  Had all her hairs been lives my great revenge  Had stomach for them all  In fact Charles I should have proceeded upon some immediate act of desperation and perhaps after I had sacrificed her to the justice of my resentment it is more than probable I had been tempted to lay violent hands on myself  You see however my dear friend from the conduct of this unhappy wretch how much reason I had for supposing that the woman who deviates from the rules of virtue with one man will have very little scruple to indulge the licentious turn of her disposition with another you see what reason I had to set Louisa's crime down to the account of genuine constitution instead of attributing it to the weakness of an  extravagant loveBut your women of strong passions Charles are continually falling in love every fresh object inspires a fresh desire and when they have once conquered that exalted delicacy of sentiment which is the principal bulwark of their honour they give an unbounded license to enjoyment and imagine that since they have been familiar with one person there can be no addition to their guilt by an equal familiarity with all Thus instead of an endeavour to recover the hallowed paths of innocence they make a single indiscretion an excuse for the commission of a thousand and indulge every rising gust of inclination by arguing themselves into a belief that it cannot in the least increase the infamy of their characters  You pleased me extremely by your repeated accounts of colonel's Mildmay's  perfect recovery Poor fellow he now sees for what a worthless woman he ventured his life and those madheaded puppies that are for resenting the ruin of a sister impatient to be ruined and one who places the principal of all felicities in her absolute destruction will I hope be warned by Louisa's conduct from hazarding their throats whenever a profligate hussey thinks proper to throw away her reputation Is it not however surprizing that in all this time notwithstanding the most diligent search of the Mildmay house no account whatsoever can be heard of their delicate daughter But I suppose she is in some secluded corner of the kingdom wallowing in the stye of unbounded prostitution and even entertaining some underbred scoundrel of a keeper with the pangs which her infamous flight has thrust into the bosom of her miserable familyO for some  quick some executing curse to strike the strumpet and her paramour this moment to the center though I was to follow them the nextPerhaps Charles she is diverting him with a ludicrous representation of your friend and laughing with him this moment at my stupidity in once believing her a woman of virtuePerhaps my manner is mimicked to a circle of intoxicated foxhunters and perhaps a whole table of brutal country squires are at this very instant roaring at the seriousness and solemnity of my first declarationO that I was near herthat I could reach her prostituted heartBy the great God of heaven it would give me more pleasure to tear it from her bosom than to receive the empire of the whole universe and I am not sure but I would forfeit my hopes of everlasting salvation if I could but commit a piecemeal murder on her villain and make him feel but  one half one fiftieth part of that hell which his possession of her has kindled in this breast and which is at this moment furiously blazing for revenge  Yet Charles what have I to do with this abandoned womanwhat is her infamy to meI'll talk no more of herI'll think no more of herI'll stab her idea to the heart if it ever rises again to my imaginationI'llAlas my dear MelmothI can talk of nothing elseI can think of nothing else and base polluted prostitute as she isI will not answer but what she might yet find it possible to argue me into an opinion of her innocence and persuade me even against the sense of my own conviction into such a belief of her purity as would induce me to forget every thing which is past and urge me to snatch her again to my bosom with all the passionate phrenzy of a desperate  loveO Melmoth had you ever seen herhad you ever heard her talkBut I will drop the subject I will speak of something else and only observe that the greatest of all curses is to doat upon the object of our utmost contempt and to feel an invincible fondness in our hearts for what our reason points out as an everlasting mark of detestation  I have by this post wrote to my sister and informed her of my intention to comply immediately with her wishes and return home Edwards has orders to prepare every thing for my departure and in six weeks or a couple of months I flatter myself with a hope of finding you in high spirits and in good health You my dear Melmoth and that exalted woman lady Haversham shall have the direction of my future lifeYou are people upon whose friendship  I can safely rely and notwithstanding all the parade which is made about a knowledge of the world I am not satisfied but what the integrity of our friends is much more essential to our welfare than their knowledge of mankindBut a truce with philosophical reflections  What you tell me in relation to my sister's refusal of lord Winworth does not at all surprize meA woman of eight and twenty with a prodigious fortune a fine person and such a mind as lady Haversham's cannot fail of having a number of admirersBut I am satisfied deserving as those admirers may be she will never think of changing her situationI know Theodosia possesses a delicacy of mind perhaps superior to all the rest of her sex and am sensible however she may respect the matrimonial union that she is no friend  to second marriagesShe has in confidence repeatedly told me that a heart which is deserving of regard can admit but of one impression and that she who can love a second time is utterly unworthy of being ever loved at allHer notions to some may appear a little romantic but I dare say Charles they will never lessen her in any body's estimation whose esteem can be necessary to her peace or advantageous to her characterThis I am sure of at any rate that they will excite your admiration as much as they have done that of  Your ever faithful ROBERT HAROLD  LETTER XIX  Miss  LOUISA MILDMAY  to Miss  HARRIOT BEAUCLERK  Magdalen House Goodman's Fields  AND have I at last the unspeakable happiness of writing once more to my dear Harriot does she still acknowledge me for her friend or does she join in the general obloquy which the whole world must naturally throw upon a mysterious absence of above eleven months at a time too that the most criminal levity of conduct had banished me from the protecting arms of parental affection and cast me out in the full face of the whole universe as a disgrace to my sex and a scandal to my family O Harriot it will be no more than what I expect if you should  both despise and detest meYet when my story my melancholy story comes to be related when you find how basely how cruelly I have been betrayed I know your tender heart will bleed at what I have suffered and I know also that the generosity of your disposition will be sensibly affected if during a period in which I have been most entitled to your pity I have been materially lessened in your esteem To begin then at once know that the specious the sanctified Mrs Darnel who had such obligations to our family and in whose house I was to find so certain an asylum is a fiend of darkness an instrument of hell a priestess of destruction  For the first day or two of my residence at her house after I was turned out from my father's she seemed so heartily touched with my misfortune and so immediately interested in my  welfare that abstracted from the closeness of our relation she acquired a considerable share of my esteem and I could not help considering her as a woman of unbounded good nature who was kindly appointed by the pitying hand of Providence to mitigate the severity of my afflictionActuated by this opinion I made her acquainted with my whole heart and determined as she had the character of being extremely sensible and devout to regulate my conduct entirely by her advice till I should be happily blest with the forgiveness of my father  I had not however been at her house above three days when she began to alter her tone a little instead of lamenting the unhappy step I had taken as she did first she spoke of it with more and more indifference and at last pretty plainly insinuated that I had  erred rather against the severities of custom than the laws of moralitythat the very best women in the kingdom had not always been able to preserve themselves unsullied and that it was even idle to distress myself so much on account of a slip which she herself knew would not be in the least prejudicial to my fortune I must confess I was so astonished to hear a woman of whose delicacy in matters of reputation I entertained the highest opinion so easily reconciled to an action I considered as criminal as it was scandalous and to be no less repugnant to the principles of virtue than the customs of society I therefore continued silent some moments hoping that I had misconceived her meaning and expecting that she would explain herself more to my satisfaction but here I was totally disappointed for mistaking my silence as a mark of my approbation she ventured  to be still more explicit and delivered herself to the following purpose with an air half gay half serious yet carefully attending through the whole to the various changes of my countenance  Indeed my dear Miss Mildmay to be candid with you I cannot imagine however widely I differ from the sentiments of the righteous over much that the indulgence of the passions is any way repugnant to the laws of moralityI shall grant that the indulgence of them in a manner conformable to the practice of one's country is the most eligible mode but where people are not married human nature as the poet says will be human nature and a casual lapse from the rigid rules of form must be sometimes expected Come my dear  continued the unblushing creature  taking hold of my hand that Harold is a villain but if  you will be governed by me your little affair with him shall by no means deprive you of a good husband You recollect your old admirer Sir Harry Hastings Sir Harry passionately loves you and has followed you up to town to make another tendre of a heart which has long been devoted to your service he is my intimate acquaintance and has in fact requested my assistance and if you have no objection shall drink tea with us this evening  You cannot imagine my dear Harriot what indignation I felt during the whole time of this delicate harangue yet willing to discover her utmost designs I endeavoured to bridle my impatience till she had finished it When she concluded I strove to assume as unembarrassed a tone of voice as I was able and fixing my eyes with an unremitting attention upon her's  I think this was someting like my reply  When I was free enough madam in obedience to the commands of a mother to take up my residence at your house I never expected to be insulted with a conversation of this nature I did not scruple to acknowledge that I had been accidentally guilty but at the same time I was in hopes Mrs Darnel would good naturedly consider that I was far from being habitually depravedHow therefore she can so widely mistake my character or rather how she can act in a manner so unworthy of her own as to become a kind of advocate for dishonour fills me with an equal degree of surprize and afflictionWhen I came here I expected a friend that would sympathize with my sorrows not a flatterer that would study to lessen the blackness of my crime Human nature as you say madam may be human nature  but be assured notwithstanding the error which I have so recently committed I have no wishes to gratify by a new sacrifice either of my peace or my character and that I shall never be so lost to sentiment or shame as to accept the hand of a worthless fellow who was formerly discarded on account of his own profligacy and who is now mean enough to build his hopes of success upon an opinion of mine Excuse me Mrs DarnelYou have a right to receive what company you please in your own house but consider that I am under no necessity of remaining here to be affronted by your visitorsI have other relations madam in town who I doubt not will favour me with protection and if you will only suffer some body to order a chair I shall ease you directly of all uneasiness on my account  Alarmed at a reply which I dare say from my silence at first she no way expected Mrs Darnel seemed greatly surprized that I should put so unaccountable a construction upon her words if she seemed to speak slightly she said of a deviation from the spotless path's of innocence it was on purpose to restore me to some degree of temper with myself and if she had recommended Sir Harry Hastings to my consideration it was entirely from a solicitude for my welfare that deserved a very different return from such a severity of animadversion as I had been pleased to distinguish it with Sir Harry was a man of good family and large fortune unexceptionable in his person and for aught she had ever heard to the contrary unexceptionable also in his manners On these accounts she did not think him unworthy of my notice however since I was so averse to an interview with him  she would take care he should never visit at her house so long as I continued to honour her with my company and that for the future I might be satisfied she would not drop a single syllable which was capable of giving me the least offenceAdding that from the unremitting rectitude of her past life there could be no room to suppose she would now become an advocate for dishonour or betray the cause of that virtue in the decline of her days which in the giddiest part of her youth she had always regarded as the principal beauty of the female character  We are all of us my dear Harriot ready enough to believe what we wish may be true and Mrs Darnel defended herself with such an appearance of integrity that I was grieved for the tartness of my reply and begged she would excuse it on account of the distraction  with which my mind must at that time be naturally torn I then let her into a few passages of Sir Harry's character particularly his ruining the two Miss Nettervilles his insolent attempt to run away with myself for which you know my poor brother would have called him to a severe account had not Mr Townshend put them both under an arrest and mentioned some instances of his tyranny to inferiors that had rendered him either contemptible or detested through all the country Mrs Darnel affected great surprize at these accounts declaring she had never heard of any thing but his attempt to run away with me which could be mentioned to his prejudice"Even of that" says she  I heard but vaguely I however set it down as a proof of that passion for you which he still continues to express with the greatest vehemence and which before I heard your sentiments  I did not know but the family might be induced to overlook  Matters continued entirely to my mind at Mrs Darnel's till lady Haversham took her leave of me and went down on the scheme of reconciliation to the Hall Mrs Darnel then began to hint something of a concern for Sir Harry and insinuated though distantly a fear lest the amiable countess should prevail in her brother's favour and lest after all I should be doomed to the arms of a man who was entitled to nothing but my eternal detestationI again appeared extremly dissatisfied she however apologized and we were again reconciled but the night after Harriotthe night afterDoes not your heart ach with the strongest apprehensions for your poor LouisaI know it doesand I even anticipate at this passage  the distress which I am sensible you must feel upon my account  Next morning after breakfast Mrs Darnel told me she was in a great dilemma with regard to an engagement which she had annually at Sir William Nicholson's in the next street  You must know my dear  says she  Sir William and his lady always celebrate the anniversary of their marriage and for twenty years I have never been absent on that occasionNow I would not for the world leave you aloneand yet I don't know how to get excused if I stay away from Sir William's this is the day and there is to be a prodigious croud of company there in the evening  My dear Mrs Darnel returned I you quite distress me with your civilityYou must on no condition stay from your friends for I shall be quite miserable if I think I interfere in the  least with your engagements I insist therefore absolutely on your goingand"Well well" interrupted she  since you are so good I'll gobut depend upon it I shall be at home by eleven in the evening  The stating of an hour for her return occasioned a fresh dispute but at last she set out ordering a chariot which she had kindly set up on my account the day or two before notwithstanding the slenderness of her fortune to come at twelve  As I was no way inclined to sleep I sat up in the back parlour reading Clarissa Harlowe and had just got into that passage where the vile Lovelace attempts the sanctity of her chamber at midnight in the house of that detestable monster Sinclair I don't know how it was but I felt an instinctive kind of terror when I came to this placeI could not go on with the story  and began to reflect that if any body was to break into our house I should be in a very dangerous situationIt was now almost one o'clock and not a single soul at home besides myself and the cook my Sally and Mrs Darnel's women had received leave to be at a dance with some servants in the neighbourhood and the men were attending the chariot at Sir William Nicholson's to bring home their mistressThe time the place a remote street bordering on the fields of Marybone and above all the subject which I had been just reading served to fill me with the strongest apprehensions and I was going more than once to call the cook to sit with me but that I was fearful the poor woman might be in a doze from excessive fatigue as she was housemaid also and therefore considered it cruel to disturb herAt last I heard somebody unlock the street door on the outside and naturally  supposing it to be my Sally and Mrs Darnel's woman who had now returned from their evening's entertainment I rang the bell when who should enter the room to my inexpressible astonishment but the villain Hastings wrapped up in a large surtout and carrying a dark lanthorn in his hand which gleamed an inconceivable horror round the whole apartmentI screamed out you may naturally imagine at the sight of so unexpected and suspicious a visitor and called the cook as loud as I could to come up stairs instantly at the same time ringing the bell with the greatest violence but whether she was too fast asleep to hear me or whether she was privy to the designs of her infamous mistress I know not this only I know that she never once made her appearance and that I was left entirely to the brutality of a wretch whom I  knew to be equally destitute of shame and of humanity  Finding myself thus barbarously betrayed I assumed what spirits I could and asked the midnight ruffian by what authority he had dared to break into my chamber at such an hour in such a disguise and threatened him with the utmost resentment not only of the laws but my family He had now laid down his lanthorn and unbuttoned his surtout and was striving by all the affectation of the deepest respect to silence my exclamations declaring that the happiness of his whole life depended upon me and that nothing but the dictates of a desperate love could possibly urge him to break in thus violently on my repose  Consider ever beautiful Miss Mildmay  cried the monster on his knee  consider how long and how passionately  I have loved youRecollect also madam that you are now thrown out by the inhumanity of a relentless father and the perfidy of a profligate villain upon an inhospitable world which so far from commiserating your situation will even feast its malevolence with your distressTo guard you from the ruin which must inevitably burst upon your head in these melancholy circumstances behold these faithful armsMy fortune and my soul are your's if you condescend to accept of them and I shall think myself eternally obliged if the solicitude which I manifest for your felicity may be able to influence the natural generosity of your temper to prevent the everlasting destruction of mine  As he pronounced this ridiculous speech with every seeming appearance  of sincerity I suppressed the indignation which I should have otherwise discovered at his presumption in joining my father's name to so opprobrious an epithet in hopes that I should be able to turn his own arts upon him and draw some advantages from all this affectation of generosity and affectionI therefore told him that he had taken an odd way to testify his regard for me by breaking thus at midnight into my apartment and that the mysterious manner of his intrusion looked as if he came with some intentions which were totally different from the ends of this passionate protestationOn which account I begged he would immediately retire and hinted that if he still continued his sentiments in my favour he need not despair of being heard to his satisfaction in the morning  "A thousand thanks my angel" returned the wretch kissing my hand with a wildness of vehemence  for this condescending goodnessYet why my adorable Miss Mildmay if I am to receive any marks of your benignity in the morning need you now scruple to bless me with some little some distant token of your approbationWhere a man doats to distraction like me an hour's delay is a whole eternity of tortureShorten therefore the time I beseech you madam and encrease the greatness of the obligation by a generous alacrity in bestowing it  He was going on in this manner my dear Harriot and even proceeding to kiss my cheek when summoning all the fortitude of my soul I seized him by the breast and threw the wretch from me above half the length of the room  "Despicable villain" cried I at the same time  unhand me or by the holy host of heaven this moment is your last  I was really frantic HarriotI saw myself betrayed and had seized a penknife that lay accidentally open on the reading table absolutely determined to put my threats in execution if he presumed to affront me with another approachFinding me so greatly enraged he seemed totally at a loss how to behave and for some moments stood musing in a state of mingled surprize and irresolution  Perceiving him thus embarrassed at my behaviour I determined immediately to alarm the neighbourhood and with that view snatched up one of the candles thinking before he recovered from his consternation to reach the streetdoor but the cautious villain was too well prepared he had five other  ruffians planted in the foreparlour who were to seize me in case I attempted any thing of this kind and to carry me through a little garden at the back of the house into a lane that led to the fields there it seems a coach was in waiting to hurry me off and the scheme was so settled that two of these five should ride withinside the vehicle to prevent my screaming while the three others were to be posted armed without for fear after all their precautions I might find some opportunity of calling for assistance and excite the humanity of any accidental passengers to an attack  You cannot conceive my dear Harriot when I quitted the room and found Sir Harry no way inclined to follow me how my heart throbbed with the expectation of counteracting  all Mrs Darnel's barbarous machinations and the hope of being able to engage the compassion of some charitable neighbour for my protection till daylight but when the other wretches rushed out of the streetparlour and barred my passage to the door I was next to absolutely distractedI screamed with a violence that almost tore my head to pieces and losing all my resolution at once I fell upon my knees crying out  Spare me dear gentlemen spare meI am a poor unfortunate creature cast out from my family and friendsand I conjure you by the tender mercies of the living God not to assist the infamous purposes of that monster Sir Harry Hastings  "Madam" replied one of the fellows whose appearance was superior to the rest  Sir Harry is a fine gentleman  has long loved youand means you nothing but what is strictly honourable remove your apprehensions therefore    "O Sir" interrupted I  whence this violence if he means nothing but what is honourable Why am I at such an hour as this beset in my own lodgings and treated with all the illiberal freedoms of a brothellike audacity If you are gentlemen you will surely snatch a poor unhappy young creature from destruction who has never done any human being the least injury or if you are men whose necessities have obliged you to undertake an office repugnant to the natural goodness of your hearts you must surely perform a virtuous action for reward with as much readiness as you can consent to the perpetration of a monstrous crime  Hear me then dear gentlemen I beseech you conduct me but to lady Haversham's in Grosvenor SquareLodge me but safely in the next house and I solemnly protest before God that let the wretch who has employed you for this barbarous purpose promise what he will you shall receive double that sum and a thousand thanks into the bargain for consulting your own safety and disappointing his infamous designs  I would have expostulated farther with the savages my dear Harriot but the vile Sir Harry now made his appearance and asked on what account they delayed the execution of their plan endeavouring to raise me from the ground at the same time and ordering the rest to assist in carrying me to the coachIt was in vain I struggledin vain I  shrieked for helpthe monsters obeyed his commands with the most implicit readiness and my spirits were at last so exhausted by the sharpness of my terror and the fatigue of my resistance that I sunk lifeless on the floorIn this state they easily carried me to the coach and it was ten o'clock next or more properly speaking that morning before I recovered my senses sufficiently to recollect any one circumstance of the whole transaction  About ten o'clock however I came a little to myself and found that I was in a very handsome bed that the room was extremely well furnished and that there were two female attendants with hartshorn and a number of other restoratives ready to administer every assistance which might be necessary for my recovery From these women who  were Sir Harry's housekeeper and her daughter I learned that I was brought to this house about four o'clock in the morning that several times on the road Sir Harry and his companions were in violent apprehensions for my life that the moment they arrived I was consigned over to the care of the women and that till within the last two hours I had been in the strongest hysterics imaginable The housekeeper added that she was sure her master must love me with the sincerest affection for he had been like a distracted man on my account and had repeatedly sworn to lay violent hands on himself if my indisposition should be productive of any fatal consequences As the women seemed to be not only communicative but goodnatured weak as I was I made them acquainted with their master's conduct told them my name and family and offered to reward them above their utmost  expectations if they could by any fortunate contrivance facilitate my escapeTo this they replied that they should be very willing to oblige me but that their lives would not be safe if they acted in the least contrary to the will of their masterThe youngest particularly thought it surprizing that I should wish to quit so fine a gentleman as Sir Harry who had so great an estate and who was ready she was sure to marry me the moment I thought proper to give my consent From this and some other expressions which dropped from the daughter I found that she herself was in love with the wretch and consequently thought it wonderful how any body else could mention him with the smallest indication either of aversion or contempt  Disappointed in my hopes of escaping by means of the women and finding them entirely at the devotion of  their profligate master I desired they would help me up not knowing how soon they might leave me to the monster's brutality They complied but reluctantly observing that after what I had undergone rest was absolutely necessary for me and declaring that they were certain I must be greatly indisposed Indeed Harriot they said true I was extremely ill and could I have removed my apprehensions of Sir Harry I should have followed their advice with the utmost satisfaction When they had dressed me or more properly speaking when they restored my dress to a little order they led me into the diningroom and prevailed upon me to swallow two dishes of tea and a dish of chocolate after this they withdrew but the daughter returned in a few minutes after to tell me that Sir Harry was coming to attend me and the message was scarcely delivered before the horrid  fellow actually entered with an air of forced complaisance very visibly mixed with some degree of confusion and a great deal of malignity  I was sitting in a great chair when he entered and thinking it best to betray as little fear as possible I fixed my eyes upon him with an intenseness of determined indignation and asked him how long I was to remain a prisoner in his house To which he replied till I wanted an inclination to quit it  But madam  says he seating himself on the opposite side of the fireplace  I am now come to have a little serious conversation with you and as the nature of this conversation will be of the last importance to your own happiness I hope upon that account you will favour me with your attentionFrom the closeness of our neighbourhood in the country my dear Miss Mildmay  it is impossible but what some particulars of my conduct must have reached your family that were no way advantageous to my characterYet from the same closeness of neighbourhood you yourself must have heard that I declined all alliance with many young ladies of distinction merely on account of my attachment for you declaring that so long as you continued single I never should think of any other womanYou also know madam that when you thought proper to reject my addresses your whole house allowed my proposal to be extremely disinterested and acknowledged that I did not want for love however I might be deficient in desert That love madam instead of being extinguished by repulse has on the contrary acquired additional force from opposition and has driven me upon expedients in  which I have acquired nothing but disgraceIt has forced me to the meanness of keeping spies continually about your person and your very woman Sally in whom you so confidently trustednay madam don't startis nothing better than one of my instruments  As long however as you remained absolutely disengaged I bore my own rejection and even the shame which resulted from my unsuccessful attempt to carry you off before with some tollerable share of temper but the moment that cursed Harold was declared the happy man I determined let the consequence be what it would to prevent the celebration of your union and had not a rupture happened otherwise between you I was resolved you never should be his tho' I even got him pistoll'd on his way  to the churchWhen you were sent up to town I followed you instantly and established my interest so effectually with Mrs Darnel that she consented to my carrying you off from her house if there was no likelihood of my succeeding by any other meansThere was no likelihood on the contrary lady Haversham set off to bring about a reconciliation between her family and your's and the thing may be concluded done for every body knows that woman is irresistable  Such madam is the history of your present captivityNow to what must followAfter having gone these lengths to get you into my possession it cannot be supposed that the power of man will ever prevail upon me to give you upNor indeed is it likely that any body will be able to discover  you since Mrs Darnel's own interest as well as her reputation must oblige her to account for your absence in a manner widely different from the truthFor these reasons therefore madam I leave it to the determination of your own good sense whether it will not be much better for you to think of uniting chearfully with me than urge me to the disagreeable necessity of exerting a power which however unjustly it may be obtained nevertheless places your destiny entirely in my handsBelieve me Miss Mildmay I love you with the most passionate extravagance yet with the nicest sentiment of honourIf I did not intend honourably what could prevent me in a house where my will is as absolute as fate from gratifying my inclination in any manner I might wishBut I don't know how it isculpable as I may have been with  regard to others there is something about you which always excited my deepest veneration and awes me at this instant when I am in possession of your person from entertaining any intention injurious to your characterI have talked a great deal and shall now acquaint you with my final determination in a few words From the purity of my views madam and the impossibility of your ever escaping from this house I am in hopes that your generosity and your goodness will induce you to accept of the offer which I again repeat of my hand and fortune Make a merit therefore madam of necessity and consent to my propositions with a good gracefor be assured your refusal shall excuse you nothing as I have a clergyman already in the house who is not to be terrified from his duty by screams and will perform the necessary  ceremony were you even struggling in the pangs of death and he himself to be destined the next moment to inevitable destruction  Inhuman barbarous remorseless villainO Harriot don't you wonder at my patience in listening so tamely to so long and so audacious an address But indeed my dear the odious man terrified me to the last degree by the excess of his confidence and in proportion as it was proper for me to interrupt him I found myself less and less able to break in upon his horrid harangueBut a motion which he made to seize my hand roused me instantly to an exertion of my spirits and spurning him from me with all the disdain I could possibly assume yet still possessing my recollection I spoke to him in the following manner  Hear me HastingsExecrable monster hear meNor imagine because  I have been infamously betrayed into your power that any thing can fright away my reluctance to your person or my hatred of your heartKnow then that should instant death be the consequence of my refusal no force on earth shall ever make me yoursI always despised I always detested youand this last outrage or which you have been guilty gives such an everlasting edge to my aversion that I if retain in the next world any sense of what has passed in this I shall still consider you through all eternity with the same unremitting contempt and the same unremitting detestationWhat Sir do you suppose that the more reason I have for my abhorrence the more I should relax in my resentments or think that if your addresses were repulsed when I thought you infinitely less atrocious there is a possibility of succeeding  now when you are covered with aggravated crimes No Hastings noThe very supposition of such a circumstance is a fresh argument of your unworthiness and only serves to render you additionally odious to my imaginationFree me therefore from this infamous house I desire youFree me instantly from this housefor by the mighty God of heaven the hour that makes me your's puts an end to my life and may possibly endanger the safety of your own  "Upon my word madam" replied the insulting wretch  this tone of voice is perfectly tragical you really talk this admirablyand if your favourite Harold was not to the full as great a profligate as myself I should think it impossible for you to overlook the smallest deviation from the paths of virtueBut I appeal to the  rectitude of your judgment against the preposession of your heartand since you force me to put the question let me ask you which is most entitled to your regard the man who has not only ruined but forsaken you or the man who with all the obloquy of that ruin upon your head is willing to take you to his arms and is ready even to think himself happy in a participation with your disgrace  O Harriot don't you pity me don't you bleed for me hereStained and polluted as I was how could I reply to the equity of this reproachI felt it as Hamlet says  in my heart's corein my heart of heart's  and the propriety of it struck me instantly dumbO how mean how despicable is guilt when it is even incapable to retort an insult from the unworthy and shrinks before the judgement seat of vice with as great a  degree of timidity as if it was immediately arraigned before the awful tribunal of virtueThat Harold toobut save me HarriotI must not suffer myself to thinkof thatI cannot find an epithet to distinguish him bymy reason is impatient to brand him with the most detestablebut this infatuated bosom eternally beats in his behalf and though I strive to despise and abhor him yet I feel I passionately love  As I continued in a state of silent confusion at this unanswerable retort of Sir Harry's the wretch rang the bell with a determined air and the housekeeper entering to know his commands"Mrs Lawson" says he  desire the gentlemen in the parlour to walk up  The woman withdrew and before I could recollect myself sufficiently to ask him for what purpose they were to walk up three of the fellows  who had been concerned in carrying me off the night before attended by a most bold looking man in a clergyman's habit were in the room This was a sight which I was utterly unable to withstand my brain was instantly on fire I screamed with a wildness of distraction and just as the clergyman was coming up to me I sunk down lifeless on the floor What became of me for six whole weeks I know notMrs Lawson tells me that I was in such strong hysterics after the presence of the men had terrified me into a swoon that they were under a necessity of giving over their purpose for that time and that it was with the greatest difficulty she her daughter and two of the housemaids could remove me to my room Here it seems the violent agitation of mind and the excessive fatigue which I had undergone threw me into a fortunate fever which deprived me of my  senses and though the monster Hastings omitted nothing which could possibly tend to my recovery yet it was full six weeks before I was brought to my recollection About this time the natural goodness of my constitution triumphing over the fury of my disorder I became somewhat sensible and was called back to the pungent reflections of a sensibility which made me look with an inconceivable envy upon madness  During the dangerous part of my illness Mrs Lawson informed me that her wretch of a master was absolutely frantic that he frequently tore his hair and stamped upon the ground with all the agitation of a bedlamite swearing he would not survive me if I happened to die and raving that the grave should at least unite him to me should there be no possibility of a union with me by any other means Though nothing was  ever more odious to me than the thoughts of this fellow's passion yet it was very fortunate that he loved me to so preposterous an excessfor his brutal companions before I fell dangerous ill being no strangers to the crime of your unhappy friend were continually ridiculing his intention of marrying a creature who had already parted with her honour and were as often advising him to profit by the opportunity which Mrs Darnel had put so luckily in his handsThey assured him that a woman who had been familiar with one man would make no mighty scruple to be familiar with a secondthey mentioned my hatred of him as the greatest of all affectations and insisted that nothing could be so contemptible as his stooping to accept of a woman for his wife whom another had already possessed as his mistress These arguments Mrs Lawson hinted would wind him up sometimes  to a downright determination of proceeding to the most absolute violationshe seemed fearful of being despised by his friendsand frequently talked of pursuing their advicebut in the midst of all his resolutions the desire which he had to make me his irrevocably and the dread he was under lest I should commit some instant act of desperation on myself if he went to such shocking extremities prevented him from executing his horrid design so that when he found I was really in danger every thought of an illicit nature was immediately sacrificed to his concern for my recoveryBy this means my dear Harriot I very happily escaped every actual dishonour and tho' his detestable passion was the source of such exquisite distress still it was that very passion which was the ultimate cause of my preservation  I will not my dear Harriot trespass on your patience by a minute detail of all I suffered in this odious house during a period of seven monthsSuffice it that I was scarcely recovered from my first fit of illness but a fresh attempt to force me into a marriage brought on a relapse which saved me from a world of the most insupportable persecution and changed the detestable importunities of Hastings into a fresh concern for my lifeThis second interposition of Providence for I consider it as such in my favour lasted three monthsand the wretch was so miserable at that time on my account that he expressed a resolution of using no means but humility and confinement to work upon my temper for the futureIn about three months time I was again tollerably recovered and beginning again to dread some lawless attempt from Sir Harry when one of these common yet unexpected accidents  which are sometimes productive of events which cannot be brought about by the utmost exertion of human wisdom set me free from captivity and opened a new scene in my history perhaps not less extraordinary than any of the former passages  Sir Harry and some of his fellowlibertines had been making merry below stairs one day for I should have told you that during the whole time of my imprisonment I never once eat a morsel out of those rooms which were particularly set apart for my use and sat up according to custom so extremely late that none of them retired sober to their roomsI myself heard some of them very noisy on the stairs when they broke up and therefore could give a probable guess at their situationsI don't know what was the matter with me but that night I would not pull off my cloaths and only threw  myself across the bed to indulge myself in one of those melancholly reveries which are generally pleasing to the unfortunatebetween three and four however I grew a little heavy and had just began to doze when Mrs Lawson and her daughter who always lay in an adjoining bed in the same room as well to prevent me from any possibility of escaping as to take care that my apartments were not approached by any of her master's friends gave a violent shriek and jumping out of bed with the utmost precipitation exclaimed that the house was in flames It was now about the beginning of October and wanted a considerable while to day I started up and found the matter just as they represented it the fire blazing fiercely through the windows and the servants who were by this time alarmed were some of them unlocking the street door and unbolting the parlour windows while  others were busied in assisting their intoxicated masters out of bedThis was an opportunity my dear Harriot not to be neglected already dressed I took advantage of the general confusion and slipping out in nothing but a black silk nightgown while every body's attention was employed on something else I gained the road dark as it was and trudged on without knowing or indeed caring which way I went so I could but get far enough from that detested HastingsThe only apprehension I laboured under was that of being pursued and overtaken by some of the wretch's emissaries the moment he became acquainted with my flight But as if Providence was particularly determined to rescue me from his hands I was overtaken by a ministring angel in the humble shape of a gardener's wife who was singing with all the chearfulness of a benevolent mind and going with a cartload of vegetables to one of the London  marketsI addressed myself to her at once told her that I was an unfortunate young woman who had been carried off from my friends by force about seven months before and that the villain's house who had taken me away being that moment on fire I had seized the opportunity and made my escape I therefore begged her protection and assured her I would make it worth her while if she would be kind enough to take me along with her as I was fearful of being pursued and carried back The good woman who had ordered a boy that drove the horses to stop the moment I spoke to her replied that whoever I was I appeared to be in distress and that she said was a sufficient claim to her assistance at any time So saying she let down a little ladder from the cart and desiring the boy to help me up I was seated by herself in an instant As she had a lanthorn by her in the vehicle she could now have a tolerable  idea of my person and after looking at me for a minute or so in the least offensive manner she could assume she stood up and taking off a warm joseph in which she was buttoned up herself "Come madam" said she  this is a cold morning you don't seem much acquainted with this way of travelling therefore let me help you on with this coat Indeed you must have it  perceiving I made a motion to decline being obliged at her expence  and you must let me tie this handkerchief about your head tooPoor soul how you tremblebut have a stout heartI'll be sworn from your looks that you are a good creature and depend upon it you shan't want for a friend while my name is Deborah Dobson  O Harriot how was I charm'd with the uncultivated benignity of this worthy rustica tear of gratitude rose instantly  into my eye and all I could say was "Good Mrs Dobson I thank you" We had not rode above a mile from Hampstead for there my dear it was that Hastings had his house when the honest obliging creature's joseph and handkerchief preserved me almost miraculously for Sir Harry having missed me in a very little time had dispatched servants every way I suppose in search of me not at all attending to the safety of his house and two of them now came up to the cart and enquired of Mrs Dobson if she had met any young woman on the road Mrs Dobson replied she had not and the fellows pursued their course furiously on towards town saying that probably somebody on horseback or in a postchaise had taken her up since it was impossible for her to walk so far in the time  You can't think how my heart flutter'd my dear Harriot at this rencounter nor imagine  what a degree of satisfaction the worthy woman expressed at my fortunate escape "You see Madam" says she  how lucky it was that you consented to be wrapped upthat joseph is an old companion of mine and I shall love it as long as I live for being the means of your deliverance  In this manner we reached Whitechapel I think she called it where there is a market kept and where she had a sister she told me a widow woman who kept a snug little house and would afford me all the accommodation in her powerAccordingly she led me directly to her sister's who it seems was a considerable dealer in butter and eggs and was now preparing to set out upon the business of the day a most comfortable breakfast of coffee being already on the table in a neat stone kitchen amply furnished with pewter and brass of so shining a complexion as bore the  strongest testimony imaginable to the cleanliness of the owner  "Molly" says Mrs Dobson to her sister upon entering  I have brought a stranger with me to town this morning here is a young lady who was carried off from her friends by some scoundrel about seven months ago and kept all that time at the villain's house at Hampstead The house thank God was afire as we passed by and the young lady while all the family was busy about other affairs slipped out overtook my cart and here I have brought her to be taken care of 'till she can send to her relations  "God bless her dear soul" returned the other  I shall take as much care of her as if she was my own childI warrant her poor father and mother have felt many an aching heart upon her account  but come Madam sit down let us have a dish of coffee and then we'll shew you to a bed where you may rest a little after the fatigue of your journey  So saying she helped me off with my joseph and handkerchief while a pretty modestlooking young woman about eighteen who appeared to be her daughter kindly reached me a chair and seemed studious for opportunities to oblige me  After breakfast the two sisters preparing to go away recommended me to the care of Sally the young woman of whom I have been just speaking and wished me in a very affectionate manner a good morning Before they withdrew however I begged to speak to my worthy friend Mrs Dobson in a private room the good woman readily indulged my request and if I might judge by the benignity which enlightened her honest countenance  she came with the more readiness from a supposition that I stood in farther need of her services When we were alone  My dear Mrs Dobson  says I  you have eternally obliged me you have been my preservermy guardian angelbut I shall be the most miserable creature in the world unless you kindly accept this trifle endeavouring to squeeze five guineas into her hand for a pair of gloves  "Madam" replied the generous Mrs Dobson in a stile much above her condition  I am no way sorry that you make me this offer because it confirms my good opinion of youbut I should think very meanly of myself if I was capable of taking a reward for performing a common act of humanityGod bless you my sweet young lady  continued she kissing my cheek  and send you a happy meeting with your friendsWhile you stay here every thing will be at your service I dare say and humble  as we are in the world be assured you have fallen among people who would rather confer obligations than receive them  Oh Harriot these are the persons whom your great ones look upon with contemptthese are the persons whom the insolence of the opulence or pomp so frequently considers as little superior to the merely animal creation yet see by what souls they are informedThe mind of this woman my dear would have done honour to a coronet yet how many women are there with coronets who would shed the smallest degree of credit upon her cart  After the departure of the two industrious sisters Sally to whose care I was consigned advised me in a very pretty manner to lie down insisting upon helping me to undress and begging I would consider myself at home in their family I complied with Sally's  obliging intreaties and accordingly went to bed but alas my dear I awoke in a high fever and was actually delirious before the good young woman's mother returned from market By the excess of the worthy people's tenderness and care of an excellent apothecary who it seems attended that admirable institution called the Magdalen about which you and I have so frequently talked in the country I was in as short a time as possible recovered from my illnessbut though my health was reestablished my mind was totally unhingedThe numberless distresses which I had of late sustained joined to the consciousness of having been the original author of every misfortune myself was too much for me Ignorant whether my brother was living or deadsatisfied that my poor father and mother must be torn by the sharpest of all anxietiesand convinced that my Harriot herself must have given me up as a lost abandoned  creature I was continually raving about my fall and wishing for some asylum where I might waste out the remainder of my days in penitence for my sin Instead therefore of desiring+ing to write to those who would interest themselves in my behalf I looked upon the whole world as my irreconcileable enemy yet though I incessantly raved I was nevertheless apparently calm and perfectly consistent It was in vain that poor Mrs Dobson the honest woman her sister and the whole family opposed my resolution of entering the Magdalen it was in vain that they assured me of a perpetual asylum with themI continued inflexible and what was the absolute result of my delirium they who could naturally judge by nothing but appearances set down as the consequence of premeditated determination so that at last they consented and I was received though with some essential deviations from the customary mode  of accepting Penitents the good apothecary managing matters with as much delicacy as could be wished I have since however learned that had any of Hastings's people remained about Hampstead to satisfy Mrs Dobson's enquiries or could she have prevailed on me to give any account of myself after my illness I never should have entered this place But Sir Harry's house it seems being entirely burnt down the whole family was removed before her enquiries began and I was so strenuously bent upon my scheme that I evaded an answer to her questions to myself with a degree of cunning almost wonderful in my circumstances  I have now my dear Harriot been in this house above three months and find that my little understanding is as well established as my healthI have therefore employed myself for some  time in drawing up the foregoing account for your information and submit it entirely to your own discretion either to conceal it or to lay it before my relations My friend Mrs Dobson and her sister with their goodnatured niece and daughter visit me at every convenient opportunity and I have now made the worthy people acquainted with the history of my misfortunes though I have not yet informed them either of my betrayer's name or the name of my own family and what is still more I have perswaded Sally's mother to accept of fifty guineas which I had in my purse for all her trouble and expence and Mrs Dobson has promised to wear a ring for my sake but not 'till she sees me out of this houseSomehow worthy as these people are they look upon public penance as disreputableperhaps according to the modes of this country it may be so but what in  fact is custom where conscience is solely to determine upon virtues and upon crimesIt is true if my imagination had not been disturbed I had never dreamt of entering into a place particularly dedicated to the public penitence of prostitutionYet alas Harriot how am I better than the unhappy poor creatures whom the pinching hand of necessity or the poignant stings of remorse have brought to the same salutary yet humiliating habitationHave I not violated the sacred laws of virtueHave I not blasted my reputationHave I not torn a father's heart with unutterable anguishHave I not steeped the pillow of an excellent mother in despairAnd may not the generous youth my brother be long since murdered on my accountO save me Harriot from that dreadful suppositionSnatch me if possible from my fears upon this occasionor  my portion must be distraction without endGracious God what a wretch do I appear on the smallest recollectionAnd shall such a creature as I imagine she is any ways lessened by mingling with those who like herself have sacrificed the dignity of their sex and the honour of their familiesNo Harriot this is the properest habitation for me nowHere meditation as the poet says may find room even to madnessAnd here the streaming eye of a heartdirected contrition may possibly wash away the stains of guilt and induce the awful Father of Mercies to overlook my crimesBut my poor parentsmy nobleminded brotherO Harriot if I yet retain any share in your remembrance write to me instantlyI shall not close my eyes till the return of the postA letter directed to Mrs Carter's my kind hostess in Whitechapel for Charlotte Windham the name which  I assumed in the unsettled state of my mind to prevent my family from receiving any farther disgrace will be immediately forwarded to the lost unhappy wretch who possessed the first place in your friendship when she was  LOUISA MILDMAY  LETTER XX  Sir  ROBERT HAROLD  to  CHARLES MELMOTH  Esq  Calais  December  OH Melmoth my Louisa is innocenther account is authenticated by the strongest of all testimoniesthe acknowledgment of Hastings himself and the villain has by this time probably attoned with his life for all the tortures of her bosom and all the agonies of mineI have just reached this place and have sat down while a little vessel is getting ready to sail with me for Dover to send you a cursory account of particulars lest any accident should prevent me from being with you in London as early as the post  I had just received lady Haversham's copy of Louisa's affecting history which you sent me with your last when all life and spirits I dressed for the opera and happened to be introduced into a box where an English gentleman was sitting alone with whom I fell into so familiar a conversation that I accepted a proposal which he made of eating a bit of supper at a tavern after the performance and this the more readily as his appearance bore an indication of fashion and as in the course of our chat he mentioned his being intimate with two or three gentlemen of my acquaintance  When the opera was over we retired to one of the best houses in the neighbourhood of the theatre where after drinking two or three glasses of Burgundy he mentioned that his name was Sir Harry Hastings and that he had a seat in the county of OxfordI need  not tell you that this information set me instantly on fire I was just going to break out and to demand satisfaction for his outrages to Louisa when recollecting it would be best to hear his own account of mattersfor fear after all that Miss Mildmay might draw up a story to answer her own purposes and trespass a little upon veracity to extenuate the infamy of her flight With this view I asked Sir Harry if he was acquainted with the Mildmays as I knew something of a gentleman who had paid his addresses to a young lady of that family  Acquainted with them  replied Sir Harry  yes I am perfectly acquainted with them and it is in a great measure on account of that very young lady that I have quitted EnglandYou must know Sir  continued the communicative baronet  that I am a near neighbour of the Mildmays and have  for above four years entertained a passion of the most extravagant nature for their daughterbut somehow though my fortune was as good as any other admirer's and my proposals much more advantageous still some freedoms which I had taken with the women created unsurmountable objections to my character and my addresses were rejected with a degree of disrespect that gave me no little mortification Stung with resentment at the cavalier manner in which I was treated and burning also to obtain Miss Mildmay I made a fruitless attempt to carry her offIn some time after the failure of this design one Sir Robert Harold possibly the gentleman you mean sir commenced an acquaintance at Bath with Miss Mildmay and worked himself so successfully into her affections that a day was set apart for  the celebration of their nuptials though this happy lover was to the full as great a profligate as myself The family however paid dear for the preference which they gave this gentleman for before the wedding day Sir Robert found means to gain the last favour from Miss Mildmay and a quarrel happening between them immediately after the intended bridegroom fairly took his leave and left the disdainful Louisa to feel in turn every sting of disappointment and every pungency of disgrace  Miss Mildmay on this was instantly sent to town to the house of a relation one Mrs Darnel and as I had my spies continually at work I found out at once the place of her destination and followed her instantly being still so ridiculously besotted that her affair with Harold no way  lessened either the excess of my love or the extravagance of my veneration In fact what would have damped the ardour of any other man's passion only served to increase the fervour of mine so that instead of thinking to possess her on the same terms with that lucky dog Harold I was uncommonly desirous of making her mine for ever I wanted to be sure of her and notwithstanding I had a thousand times ridiculed other fellows for scandalously stooping to patch up a cracked reputation still I went on as if her character had been unblemished and felt infinitely more uneasiness on account of her prepossession for the destroyer of her honour than for her actual deviation from the sentiments of virtueBut I beg your pardon  cried Hastings interrupting himself  I am trespassing on your leisure by a dull repetition  of an affair which cannot possibly afford you the smallest entertainment People are apt to teize others with those circumstances which affect their own peace and I never hear Miss Mildmay's name mentioned but what I am for entering into an account of my passion for her and a narrative of my various disappointments  "O Sir" replied I  you cannot oblige me more than by indulging yourself on the subject I am extremely entertained by relations of this nature and if there is no particular secret  "Secret Sir" returned my brother baronet  O there is no secretI dare say by this time every thing is public enough in England and therefore I can have no objection to gratify your curiosity since such a gratification is the highest pleasure I can do myself You must  know Sir that Miss Mildmay had scarcely arrived at her cousin Darnel's when the prevailing rethoric of one thousand guineas and a five hundred pound annuity for life prevailed upon the worthy relation to deliver her into my hands The price extravagant as it was I did not matter sixpence but it seems the unconscionable Jezabel was to receive something very handsome from Harold's sister lady Haversham for contriving a method of removing those inconveniencies to which the beautiful delinquent might be exposed during her absence from her family such as want of equipage and other essential articlesThese lady Haversham as Harold's sister could not be seen immediately to furnish as Miss Mildmay's delicacy would be alarmed and as Mrs Darnel's circumstances were narrow she was to  receive a secret sufficiency for the purpose and to be properly considered for her politeness into the bargain This was the reason why she insisted upon the exorbitant terms I have mentionedBut enough of termslet it satisfy therefore that she contrived a feasible excuse to leave Louisa alone one eveningthat the servants were all sent out of the way and that with the assistance of four or five friends who were provided in case of accidents I carried her off to a house which I had at Hampstead and kept her there for full seven months  Now Melmoth see my astonishing command of temper"Seven months" interrupted I  so  calmly  Well and surely in that time you had opportunities enough of carrying your point either by marriage or a more expeditious  methodyou understand me  "No by all that's good" replied he  strange as it may appearI was totally disappointed of successShe was in a violent fever the principal part of the time and in the intervals of her recovery nothing could either perswade or terrify her into an acceptance of meThe few friends who were in the secret advised me to proceed by other means and laughed incessantly on account of my romantic purity of affection as they termed it for a cast mistressTheir ridicule too was the more severe because I had been myself one of the very wildest in the whole knot and had taken such liberties at various times with the sex as rendered my present behaviour to the last degree extraordinaryThere is nothing which we can stand so little as the shaft of ridiculeI was a  thousand times determined to prosecute their adviceand frequently blushed in secret at the littleness of my conduct in thinking of Miss Mildmay for a wifeYet my unaccountable love got the better of my shame and I was terrified from attempting any actual violation because I knew the greatness of her spirit and was apprehensive that in such a case she might lay a desperate hand upon her personShe had repeatedly threatened as much and I am positive would have been as good as her word  "It is wonderful" interrupted I  that some of your friends did not speak of her being with youthat none of your servants as you were so near a neighbour of the Mildmays did not at some time write to their friends in the country about the  young ladyor that the physicians    O the easiest things in the world to manage  cried Sir Harry  I had secrets of my friends as a security for the preservation of minemy servants were all true to the back bone and had been tried a thousand timesand as for the physiciansan additional fee made them as silent as the grave at any time    "Well" interrogated I  and was it possible that she could escape at last out of your hands without rewarding you for all the trouble which you were at upon her account  "It  was  possible" replied Sir Harry  because she  did  and I will tell you by what unfortunate accidentA parcel of us had been making merry  one evening below stairs and we were all pretty well in for it before we thought of going to bedFor my part though I had drank very near four bottles I had no inclination to undressI therefore took up a volume of Tristram Shandy which lay by the bedside and continued so long at this that nature was at last wearied out and I sunk insensibly into so found a sleep that it was with much difficulty they could wake me when the house was in flamesfor the bedcurtains by some means reaching my candle the whole furniture was instantly in a blaze and the fire I suppose spread through the other apartments with the greatest rapidityin the confusion occasioned by this unlucky circumstance Miss Mildmay contrived to make her escape and though the moment her flight was discovered I  posted messengers through all the different roads and even continued an indefatigable search after her for above two months I never could gain any satisfactory accountTired out at length with a search which was productive of nothing but disappointment and mortification I gave her over and quitted England in hopes that distance and time would mitigate the distresses of my mind if it could not even restore my tranquillitySo much Sir for Miss Mildmayand now I have been so communicative I hope you will not think me impertinent if I ask your name and beg to know which part of England is favoured with your residence  "That" returned I  you shall soon knowMy name is HaroldI have an estate in Somersetshirebut my  principal residence when I am in England is in GrosvenorSquare    Have you ever my dear Charles particularly remarked Garrick in the second act I think it is of Lear where Goneril has struck off one half of his followers and the poor old king tells his melancholly tale to Regan from whom he expects to meet the most dutiful returns of filial gratitude and affectionHave you I say remarked the intense the inexpressible astonishment of the venerable monarch when instead of receiving the least consolation from the only child of which he now reckons himself possessed the unnatural harpy aggravates the indignity he has suffered and desires him even to dismiss one half of those knights which have yet been spared him by her infamous sisterIf you recollect the face of our modern Roscius in that celebrated scene you  will have some tolerable idea of the amazement which this reply instantly spread over the whole countenance of Hastings"Harold"exclaimed he"Harold" drawing his chair insensibly from the table and fixing his eyes on me with an absolute wildness of surprize  Pray Sir are you the Sir Robert Haroldwho so lately courted Miss Mildmay  "The very same" cried I running to the door and bolting it  and you are the Sir Harry Hastings who have been villain enough to carry off that admirable woman in a forcible manner from her family and to imprison her for several months in a house where her delicacy was to be treated with a continued round of outrage and where the imprisonment of her person was to do an irreparable injury to her reputationDraw  Sirfor the same providential dispensation which has delivered her out of your hands now delivers you up for punishment to mine  "Mighty pretty truly" returned Sir Harry clapping his hand also upon his sword but retreating a little  and so I have been all this while unbosoming myself to my greatest enemy upon a full supposition that I was making an agreeable acquaintance if not a valuable friendTruly a very pretty rencounterbut I deserve it allWhat business had this damn'd tongue of mine to run on so impertinently in the company of an absolute strangerAnd so Sir Robert Harold I must give you satisfaction for behaving like an infamous scoundrel to Miss Mildmay  "Sir" replied I impatiently  this is no time for wordsThe man who could behave basely to Louisa Mildmay must be the greatest of all villains and  I am glad to find you so extremely candid Sir Robert  interrupted he sneeringly  because if you will only take the trouble of reflecting a little you will find yourself much a greater villain than your humble servantYou Sir  continued he altering his voice and coming up fiercely to me  You are a mighty proper person to commence a champion for the cause of virtueI carried off Louisa it is true and though I own the action to be highly criminal yet is it by any means so poor so paltry so despicable as your conduct in assuming the sacred appearance of honour and attachment to break in upon the  unsuspecting confidence of her soul and to blast her reputation Her character Sir was as unsullied as the noontide beams of heaven 'till you insidiously found means to steal upon her affections and in an accursed hour like the basest of all scoundrels infamously violated every law of hospitalityevery sentiment of friendshipand every protestation of loveI have violated no law of hospitalityhave broke no link of friendshiphave burst no protestation of loveOn the contrary so far was I from wishing to betray Louisa Mildmay that I was even willing to take her stained and polluted as she was by your baseness and did not hesitate an instant to participate in her shameAnd shall you the original author of all her misfortunes shall you take upon you to call others to an accountShall you a villain of such deeper  dye stand up as an advocate for injured innocence and talk of chastizing offenders who are comparatively spotless to yourselfAudacious scoundrel let me rather as infinitely the least culpable of the two here take vengeance upon  you  for all the calamities which have befallen a woman whom I doat upon to distractionFrom the moment I first heard of your success with her your very name planted a thousand scorpions in my bosom and I would have sacrificed you to my rage had not an indication of my resentment been likely to disappoint my designs upon LouisaI therefore studiously avoided seeing you well knowing the vehemence of my own temperBut the time is now comeand it is not a little of your blood which can gratify the greediness of my revenge  Melmoth cowardice and guilt are inseparable companionsBy the God of Heaven this harangue of Sir Harry's almost petrified meI felt myself a paltry despicable villain and I actually believe had not his sword been already pointed at my bosom the justice of his reply would have sham'd my resentment into silence and awed me into all conscientious acknowledgments of the keenest selfreproachbut my manhood was roused at the sight of his naked weapon and to it we went with as determined a malignity as ever rankled in the breasts of menSir Harry had great command of his sword and was prodigiously strong in the armfor some time he thought to conquer me by a mere exertion of forcebut finding this method ineffectual he threw out one of those exquisite feints which none but a master indeed should ever think of giving intoI don't believe  he thought me so good a swordsman as I really amhowever before he could possibly recover himself I made so rapid a lunge that my sword was half way through his right breast and the violence of the thrust together with the acuteness of the pain brought him instantly to the floorThe noise which our combat occasioned by this time bringing up the people of the house I thought it highly necessary to think of making my escape especially as they all cried out  he's a dead man  and he himself advised me to set immediately offI did soand leaving Edwards to follow with my baggage I quitted Paris in less than an hour and shall embark in a few minutes for Dover  Such is the history of this quarreland now Charles hear me attentivelyThe moment you receive this go to lady Haversham and tell her that if  Louisa and her friends are not entirely reconciled and ready to receive me at my going over I shall take an everlasting leave of England and perhaps banish myself for life from any degree of converse with human societyTell her that what my angel has suffered and suffered chiefly through my means has rendered her so inconceivably dear to my fond heart that a new disappointment will probably drive me to some instant act of desperationIn short Charles tell lady Haversham every thing which is most likely to alarm her tenderness or work upon her generosityBut why do I affront the excellent woman with a doubt of this unnecessary natureWhy do I supposeBut Charles I will neither talk of doubts  nor  supposesThe first are the greatest injury to the benignity of her heart and the latter I hope is a violence to the justice of my  own Adieu therefore my dear Melmoth and be assured that let my fate be whatsoever it may I must be as long as I live  Your true friend  R HAROLD  LETTER XXI  Lady  HAVERSHAM  to the Countess of  BLANDFORD  My dear Lady  BLANDFORD  MY cares are now overBob is at last married to Miss Mildmayand has turned out the very thing I always thought he woulda man of real probity and sound understandingYour ladyship already knows what a variety of misfortunes attended my sweet sister from the time of her expulsion from her father's till her departure from the MagdalenSo that all which is necessary for me to relate is the reception which her family gave her and the reception which she gave my brother  I have already told you that the moment her poor parents saw her letter to  Miss Beauclerk they wrote up to me desiring me to take her instantly away from the strange asylum which she had chosen in her delirium and promising to be in town within a week when every thing should be settled to my satisfaction for I had frequently told them how passionately Bob continued to love the unfortunate young lady under all the disadvantages of what we considered a scandalous elopementThey at the same time sent me up Louisa's little history where I saw plainly enough that notwithstanding the unaccountable part which my brother had acted the dear deceived girl could not by any means erase him from her heartA copy of this letter I therefore got that worthy man Mr Melmoth to take for Bob's immediate use and flew myself to the Magdalen to which as I have been upon some occasions a benefactress I have always access and enquired for  Louisa by her assumed appellation of WindhamThe good Mrs Dobson and her sister who have acquired so just a consideration with Louisa were with her when I went inthe two honest women it seems are intimately acquainted with the matron and that acquaintance admitted them whenever they pleased to Miss WindhamThey were now sitting in the matron's room when my appearance threw the little group into the greatest consternationLouisa the moment she saw me started from her seat with a light'ninglike rapidity and exclaiming  Lady Haversham lady Haversham  fainted instantly in my armsHer two friends seemed prodigiously struckbut nevertheless exerted themselves so successfully in recovering her that she was quickly in a capacity of conversing which when they found they proposed to withdraw though Mrs Dobson had a visible reluctance  in her manner that made me consider her with extraordinary attentionMiss Mildmay however would not suffer them to stir but taking each by the hand presented them with  such  a grace to me that I could not help kissing her heartily for the condescending dignity of the recollection  My dear lady Haversham  says she  you have I suppose seen my letter to Miss Beauclerk  I answered in the affirmative"Why then" continued she  give me leave to present two of the worthiest creatures in the universe to your ladyshipThis Madam is the excellent Mrs Dobsonand this the beneficent Mrs Carter whom I have mentioned in that paper  I rose and saluted each of them thanking them in the warmest terms for their generous attention to Miss Mildmay and begging to know in what  manner I could be serviceable to them on her account"O Madam" cried Mrs Dobson falling on her knees and kissing my hand with great eagerness  you have been long entitled to our utmost servicesto the everlasting prayers of me and my whole familyYour ladyship's munificent hand and your noble brother's have been the blessed instruments of Providence to snatch both me and mine from destructionYour ladyship may remember the unhappy farmer Jenkins of Salisbury who was thrown into gaol through the inhumanity of a brutal landlord for resenting an indecent liberty taken with his daughter I Madam was wife to that Jenkins and mother to that daughterYour gracious brother redeemed my husband from prison and gave a marriage portion with my childYour ladyship scarcely heard of Sir Robert's  unexampled generosity before you sent us down such a sum as enabled us to pay off all our debts and set us once more above the frowns of the worldWe were utterly unknown both to your brother and you and had no recommendation to your pity but the merit of our distressMay the great God of heaven and earth shower down eternal blessings upon both your heads and may you both feel that happiness a hundred times doubled with which you filled the hearts of both me and mine  Grateful generouslyminded creatureMy dear lady Blandford you can't think how the tears rolled down my cheeks at this pathetic addressI remembered the name perfectly well and it was the merit of my brother's behaviour on that occasion which originally rivetted him to the bosom of Louisa  You recollect the affair yourself I dare say for I believe I shewed you as a curiosity what a wellwritten letter of thanks I received from poor Mrs Jenkins immediately after I had ordered the remittance which dwelt so strongly upon the good woman's memory I raised her up you may be sure as soon as I possibly could and told her that the young lady whom she had befriended so much would I hope in a short time honour my brother with her hand as the match was what lay closely to the heart of both our familiesShe heard me with a look that indicated a wildness of satisfaction and bursting into a loud flood of tears ran about the room crying "Thank Godthank GodI have lived to be of some little use to my benefactors"  You will undoubtedly be surprized my dear lady Blandford at finding the  wife of a poor husbandman expressing herself with such an air of elegance as Mrs DobsonThe heart of the meanest peasant may be as sentimentally elegant as a prince'sbut it is education alone which forms the delivery of our sentiments and gives the customary characteristic of order and distinctionFor my own part I was so much surprized at her manner that I could not help telling her how greatly it struck meTo which she modestly replied  That I was all goodnessbut that her father was a curate in Wiltshire who had several children and not more than forty pounds a yearAt the same time therefore  continued she  that he took every necessary care about the improvement of our minds he took care to bring us up in a manner that suited with the narrowness of our fortunesso that we became somewhat remarkable through  the neighbourhood for our industry and our educationWe all married men of humble situations and hence arises the trifling disparity which your ladyship is pleased to observe between our conversation and our circumstances  But to go on  Having shewn Louisa the letter I received from her father she consented to go away with me instantly but begged that Mrs Dobson and Mrs Carter would favour her with their company whenever she took the liberty to request itThe worthy women assured her of their immediate concurrence and we parted with many tears on both sides after I had left a fifty pound bill for the use of the charity  Louisa was at my house about four days when her father and her mother came to townThe dear girl though  she impatiently longed to see them was however extremely terrified at the thoughts of their approach "How my dear lady Haversham" would she exclaim  shall I be ever able to look them in the faceThere is one guilt which I acknowledge and they have nothing but my own word to purge away the imputation of a secondMrs Darnell's assertion may be taken as soon as mineGood God how shall I look them in the face  They came at lastbut with hearts prepossessed entirely as she could wish They had seen some of Hastings's favourite servants before their departure from the country and partly by menaces and partly by bribes they came at the truth which corresponded exactly with the relation of LouisaSensible therefore only to her late sufferings  the father and the brother entirely forgot their resentment on account of her original error and the doating mother who considered matters in a more tender light than either was even ready to condemn herself for agreeing to the expulsion of so deserving a daughter when she came to weigh all the misfortunes which that expulsion had fatally producedIn this frame of mind the three came to town attended by Mrs and Miss Beauclerck when Louisa was informed they were all below stairsSweet girl how she trembledhow she weptBy the force of hartshorn and argument I however recovered her and she came down leaning on my arm into the back parlour where they were assembledShe had scarcely entered the room when the poor mother frantic almost with impatience and joy sprung from her seat and fastening round her neck strained her in her arms with a violence  that almost bordered upon distractionLouisa's feelings were no less exquisiteShe endeavoured to return the embrace with an equal degree of fervour and both sunk lifeless upon the floor before either could give utterance to a single wordThe colonel ran to his sister while the venerable old gentleman seemed entirely employed about the recovery of his excellent ladyas to Mrs Beauclerck her daughter and myself we could scarcely afford them any assistance for our tears  When the mother and the daughter became somewhat composed the latter threw herself at her father's feet and begged at once his pardon and his blessingThe old gentleman whose heart was long since melted looked at her for some time with an eagerness of silent rapture as if he was perfectly willing yet totally unable to comply with  her request at last no longer master of himself he fell instinctively upon his knees as she knelt and catching her in his arms exclaimed  O my child my child  and sobbed out with such a violence that one would imagine his heart was absolutely burstingWe therefore tore him up in a mannerbut Louisa was rivetted on her kneesthere was no prevailing upon her to riseAfter her father was forced into a chair she turned to her brother who now hung weeping over her and while a large drop seem fastened upon each of her cheeks she cried out  O Harry what has my infamy cost youCan youbut it is impossibleyou never can forgive the wretch who hasbut are you actually recoveredO what a wretch am I to involve every body who loves me in destruction  The colonel replied to this in a manner equally polite and tender and Mrs  and Miss Beauclerk now coming to claim some little share of her attention Louisa began to grow more temperate and received them both with the warmest tokens of a most cordial affectionIn a little time we were all restored to ourselves and the whole company were kind enough to become my guests during their continuation in town nay in less than two hours Miss Mildmay at the desire of her parents consented to overlook my brother's behaviour and a chariot was dispatched for Mrs Dobson and Mrs Carter whom Mrs Mildmay impatiently wanted to see and who goodnaturedly came to us in less than two hours moreBut now my dear lady Blandford prepare for something extraordinary  Mr Melmoth whom we have long thought a mighty worthy man and who for many years past has been indulging  a most melancholly turn of disposition on account of a wife and an infant who died while he was quite a young man and abroad is now the happiest of human beingshe has found that wife and that child in the person of Mrs Beauclerck and her amiable daughterTwo days after Mr Mildmay came to town Mr Melmoth received a letter from my brother with orders to communicate it instantly to me and as Mr Melmoth has a friendship of an uncommon nature for Bob he never hesitates a moment to execute his commandsbut by the bye lady Blandford you will see what a narrow escape Bob has had in another duelGod grant it may be the lastfor if any accident should happen to him I should absolutely run distractedWell as I was saying Mr Melmoth came to my house after dinner and requesting to speak with me in private produced my  brother's letter observing that Providente seemed particularly inclined to exculpate Miss Mildmay and no less desirous of punishing those in an exemplary manner who had been  intentionally  instrumental that was his qualifying word for Bob's sake in that young lady's distressI took the letter with a trembling hand and though I rejoiced at this undeniable confirmation of Louisa's rectitude still it was with the greatest difficulty I could get through the account of the duel which you will find inclosed in this pacquetI was obliged to use my har  shorn twenty timesand I don't know that I could have read it at all had not Mr Melmoth previously assured me that my brother was in health  When I had at last got through the contents I insisted upon Mr Melmoth's going in with me to the company as  he was intimately known by character to every body though with some he might be unacquainted by personHe accordingly complied but judge my dear the universal astonishment when at the very instant of his entrance Mrs Beauclerck screamed out "Mr Villars"and fell back into her chairAlarmed at the name the manner and the voice he flew to her and exclaiming  O my Nancy my Nancy  raised her up in his arms while her beautiful daughter ran wild to her assistance not knowing what to think of this extravagant surprizeNot to keep you any longer in suspence my dear lady Blandford the company soon discovered that Mrs Beauclerk was the long lost wife of Mr Melmoth and that some very extraordinary circumstance had divided them without any fault on either side for a painful series of yearsWhat however appeared very strange was  that each imagined the other to be dead and that the information concerning the death of each was communicated to the other by no less indubitable a channel of intelligence than Mr Melmoth's own fatherMr Melmoth's father it seems was a great EastIndia merchant and intended to give his son a large fortunebut the young gentleman falling in love and marrying contrary to his father's consent the old man would not be reconciled to him upon any terms but his taking a voyage to the Indies and continuing abroad for an interval of three yearsMr Melmoth having no resource for the maintenance of his wife but his father's bounty thought it better to accept of these cruel conditions than to expose the woman of his soul to penury and distress he complied therefore though with a bleeding heart and accordingly set out in about thirteen months after their marriage  just as she had been delivered of a daughterHe had scarce reached the place of his destination in the Indies when his father wrote over a melancholly letter containing an account of his wife's death and his child's and advising him to think of enlarging the term of his residence in that quarter of the globe This was an advice which the young gentleman readily pursued After the loss of all that was most dear to his wishes England became hateful to his thoughts and he did not return till two years after the death of his father when he had the mortification to find that the old gentleman had left all his wealth to some remoter branches of his familyYoung Mr Villars for so I shall now call him though disappointed in his expectations of succeeding to his father's fortune was however in very affluent circumstances himself During his residence abroad he had acquired  immense riches and had been left by a friend no less than eighty thousand pounds to take the name of Melmoth His property when he came home he chiefly laid out in the purchase of lands and Bob has told me repeatedly the value of his estates is a clear seven thousand a yearYet though he came home a very young man and a very rich one he still avoided mixing much with societyThe company of women he particularly shunned and employed himself chiefly in acts of beneficence and literary researchesI don't recollect by what accident my brother Bob and he became originally acquaintedbut notwithstanding the disparity of years and the diametrically opposite cast of complexions he entertained a very high esteem for Bob and would sometimes on his account visit at my house and be sociableI always respected himI saw what an excellent heart he  possessed and he gained my esteem entirely by the almost parental solicitude which he shewed for the welfare of my giddyheaded brotherand see my dear how Providence has rewarded himIn the very moment that he was labouring for the happiness of other people we see his own tranquillity restored and find that the benignity which induced him to mitigate the distresses of his friends has been the principal means of removing all those distresses under which he struggled himselfWho lady Blandford ought not to be virtuous even from interestsince if the consciousness of having performed a good action is not a sufficient reward we are so generally certain of finding it highly to our advantage in the endBut now to say something of Mrs VillarsThis lady on the supposed death of her husband was reduced to some difficulties for supportand had not a  distant relation unexpectedly left her a considerable sum of money she perhaps had found it necessary to work for bread Old Mr Villars would not advance her a shillingand few are fond of cultivating a friendship with calamitySoured therefore at the world and absolutely wretched for the loss of her husband the moment she found herself in circumstances she retired to a sequestered habitation in the country and has lived there ever since in a very private manner visiting very few people and continuing an intimacy scarcely at any house but Mr Mildmay's  Thus far lady Blandford Mr and Mrs Villars's story seemed to account for their separation but still there wanted some probable causes for old Mr Villars's conduct as well as for his daughterinlaw's assuming the name of Beauclerk Most of us therefore honestly  expressed our surprize that the consideration of Mr Melmoth's marrying a young lady without a fortune could induce his father to practise so barbarous a deceit upon an only son and Mr Melmoth himself seemed astonished that his lady should without any reasonable foundation sacrifice his name while she continued to dedicate herself so religiously to his memoryMrs Melmoth blushed and only said she had her reasons  "That she had" cried out Mrs Dobson who had been in the house some time and now eagerly thrust herself forward I was amazed at the good woman and indeed so was all the companybut as she appeared pregnant with something of importance Mr Melmoth entreated she would go on  "I will Sir" answered she  but first of all give me leave to ask you a question or twoPray do you recollect one William Dobson who formerly was a favourite servant of your father's    "Yes very well" returned Mr Melmoth  And pray don't you recollect that before your marriage with Miss Nancy Markham the lady who now stands here was publicly known the same William Dobson one day told you in confidence that your father was in love with Miss Markham and intended to offer very advantageous settlements in hopes that the greatness of the proposal might obviate the difference of his age and induce her to accept of him as a husband Pray Sir do you remember this  "Yes Madam" replied Mr Melmoth "I remember it perfectly well"  Why then Sir the whole affair is nothing more than thisYour father stung almost to madness at finding himself cut off from the first wish of his heart resolved upon the barbarous method of separating you and making each believe that the other was dead An assurance of this nature coming from a father could admit of no doubt and you might either of you have entered into a second marriage even before accident had undeceived you In either case the discovery of the deceit would have only increased your distress and in the former so long as it remained undiscovered so long he was certain of making you miserableThis was not however the whole of his designIf he could make your lady  entertain a belief of your demise he thought it still possible for himself at some opportunity to gratify the horrid purposes of his imaginationThough she was his daughter he still continued to love her and once I believe actually insinuated a proposition that must be shocking to humanityThis was at a time when her necessities were extreme and when he hoped the severity of her situation would lessen the horror of his overtureBut let me hurry from this dreadful part of my narrativeWhen he found himself treated with the abhorrence which he meritedwhen your lady even threatened to expose him to the world and talked of applying instantly to a magistrate if he ever more came within her doors he grew outrageoushe hired ruffians to insult her and omitted no opportunity of slandering her reputation  When therefore she retired from London she found it I suppose necessary to change her name for fear of his infamous machinationsThis was what he told my husband he was fearful of and it is very fortunate the lady took that precaution for I have been well assured he made every possible enquiry to discover the place of her retreat    "Gracious God" exclaimed Mr Melmoth  and can there be such fathersBut pray Madam tell me by what means you have gained this information    From the repository of all his secrets William Dobson Sir whom after the death of a former husband once the object of lady Haversham's benevolence I marriedMr Dobson often told me the story and severely  reproached himself at times for continuing in the old gentleman's serviceBut it seems he was a liberal master and therefore William I suppose endeavoured to check the pungency of his reflectionsMr Dobson Sir died about six months ago and on his deathbed conjured me if ever I found a proper opportunity to make this discoveryI would not disturb the ashes of the dead unnecessarily but the surprize which you expressed at your lady's change of name affecting me in a very particular manner I could conceal the circumstance no longerPerhaps I have been presumptuousI beg pardon of the honourable company and hope they will excuse my impertinence from a just consideration of my end    Lady Blandford did you ever hear so dreadful a storyThe barbarousbut let us not think of the monsterthe bare idea of him curdles my very blood and I shake with horror at the recollection of having written so much on so detestable a subject  When Mrs Dobson had done her story every body endeavoured to shift the conversation and none of us having yet felicitated Mr Melmoth on his happy discovery of such a wife and such a daughter we took this opportunity of doing it very sincerelyThe worthy man was all extasy while the two ladies sat between Mrs Mildmay and Louisa enjoying a thousand exquisite feelings at so fortunate an event and every now and then testifying their satisfaction with an expressive flood of tearsMr Melmoth my dear lady Blandford will be now quite another  creatureHis temper has already undergone a total alteration and you cannot think how pleased I am at the impatience which he manifests if he is but a moment absent from his newfound happiness He loves his wife with an excess of tenderness and indeed well he mayfor a more excellent or a more lovely woman of her age I believe is not to be found in EnglandHis daughter too is as fine a young lady in person as ever I saw and has a mind that even adds a lustre to her external accomplishmentsWell and what do you think has been already done about herwhy her father offered fifty thousand pounds with her to colonel Mildmay and old Mr Mildmay is so heartily for the match that he proposes to make a double wedding of it the moment my brother arrives in townFour and twenty hours ago Mr Mildmay would not have consented  so readily to his son's marriage with Miss BeauclerkBut Miss Melmoth's fortune has an irresistible charm and fifty thousand pounds will be no trifling affair to support the coronet which he expects in his familyYet I don't know but this reflection would be a little cruel to the good old man if I was writing to any body but lady Blandford  Mr Mildmay his lady and the colonel for Mr Melmoth deprived me of two visitors were now in town about five days when Bob arrived at my door The father and son were looking through the parlour window when he stopped and both ran out goodnaturedly to meet him and insisted he would make no apologies for what was pastFaults they observed had been on both sides and since he had chastized that villain Hastings they could forgive him every thingBob lady  Blandford was in a most elegant undress and really looked charminglyLouisa who was prepared to expect him every hour was not much alarmed when he was introduced She and her mamma were sitting in the dining room when he came up between Mr Mildmay and the colonelI led the van and Alexander himself in the midst of all his victories I am pretty certain never experienced one half of my satisfactionYou know how I love the recreant and how I esteem the MildmaysThis happy reconciliation therefore almost overcame meso that instead of saying any thing to Louisa on my entrance I retired to a sopha in one corner of the room and indulged myself in a delicious flood of tearsBob however was all himself with an air of the deepest respect yet of the greatest manliness he went up to the two ladies and falling on his knee  held a hand of each alternately to his lips without once breaking out into any aukward excuses which as matters then stood must have called back disagreeable images and been little else in fact than so many insinuated affrontsLouisa was all sweetness and confusionthe mother nothing but sensibility and joyboth at length however insisted upon his rising and he got up with  such  a graceto be sure lady Blandford there is not a finer young fellow in the kingdomand as he is now in so fair a way of being good you must allow me to speak of him with my utmost partiality In the evening Mr Melmoth came with his lady and daughterHow did my generous BobI will call him  my  Bob  now  exult in the happiness of his friend and how did that equally generous friend rejoice at the happiness of my brotherIn short all our hearts overflowed with  delight and to render this delight the more permanent we fairly married the two couple at St George's HanoverSquare the very next morning  I have been so busy since the celebration of these weddings that the writing of this letter has taken me up a whole week and yet long as it is now and fatigued as I am with drawing it up I cannot conclude without informing you of some farther particularsHastings's wound blessed be God is not mortalA friend from Paris sends word that it had a dangerous appearance at first but that by the skill of a very able surgeon the patient will be soon in a fair way of recoveringCriminal as that man may be still it is a terrible thing to have the blood of a fellowcreature upon our handsBut the vile Mrs DarnelI know not whether it is improper sometimes to be unconcerned  at the misfortunes of the uncommonly wickedThat wretch finding her infamous hypocrisy thus palpably detected and fearing both the reproach of the whole world and the utmost severity of the law on account of her behaviour to Louisa sold off her house and furniture and with the money it produced prepared to embark for Francebut in going down the river for that purpose the boat accidentally overset and the miserable creature together with the woman who had been the principal instrument in the barbarous behaviour to my sister was drownedAs for lady Harold's own maid Sally one of my brother's men assures him she died in an hospital of a distemper that naturally resulted from her crimesThus you see in the short story of our family my dear lady Blandford that vice is sure to be punished at  last however prosperous it may appear in the setting out whereas virtue let it be never so depressed in the beginning is always certain of triumphing in the endIn the course of our little novel all the worthy characters of distinction have been made happy and Louisa will take care that none of the inferior ones shall go unrewarded Mrs Dobson is to be her housekeeper with an annuity of a hundred pounds for life and the good woman's garden is to be settled on her children in the countryMrs Carter's Sally is to attend my sister in quality of woman and my Bob has taken a large house in St James's Market for the mother which when properly stocked and fitted up he intends her as a present and has no doubt but she will be soon able to give her daughter such a fortune as will get her a very excellent husband  God bless you my dear lady Blandfordtake care of your health and set me down as  Your ever affectionate THEODOSIA HAVERSHAM  THE END
