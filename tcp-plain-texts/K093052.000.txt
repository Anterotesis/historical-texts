 Annus Mirabilis  Annus Mirabilis  OR The Wonderful Effects of the approaching Conjunction of the Planets  Jupiter Mars  and  Saturn  By  ABRAHAM GUNTER  Philomath  A WellWisher to the Mathematicks  In nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas  Corpora  I Suppose every Body is sufficiently appriz'd of and duly prepar'd for the famous Conjunction to be celebrated the th of this Instant  December  foretold by all the Sages of Antiquity under the Name of the  Annus Mirabilis  or the  Metamorphostical  Conjunction a Word which denotes the mutual Transformation of Sexes the Effect of that Configuration of the Celestial Bodies the human Males being to be turned into Females and the human Females into Males As to Brutes Antiquity is divided nor will I interpose amongst those eminent Personages or anticipate what the Event of a few Days will determine  The  Egyptians  have represented this great Transformation by several very significant Hieroglyphicks particularly one very remarkable There are carv'd upon an Obelisk a  Barber  and a  Midwife  the Barber delivers his Razor to the Midwife and she her Swadling Cloaths to the Barber  Accordingly  Thales Milesius  who like the rest of his Countrymen borrow'd his Learning from the  Aegyptians  after having computed the Time of this famous Conjunction  Then  says he  shall Men and Women mutually exchange the Pangs of Shaving and Childbearing  Anaximander  modestly describes this Metamorphosis in Mathematical Terms  Then  says he  shall the negative Quantity of the Women be turn'd into positive their into +  i e their  less  into  more  Plato  not only speaks of this great Change but describes all the Preparations towards it  "Long before the bodily Transformation says he Nature shall begin the most difficult Part of her Work by changing the Ideas and Inclinations of the two Sexes Men shall turn effeminate and Women manly Wives shall domineer and Husbands obey Ladies shall ride a Horseback dress'd like Cavaliers Princes and Nobles appear in Nighttrails and Petticoats Men shall squeak upon Theatres with Female Voices and Women corrupt Virgins Men shall knot and cut Paper and even the  Northern  People  A Phrase which for Modesty's Sake I forbear to translate which denotes a Vice too frequent amongst us"  So far  Plato  Nor was our own  Merlin  ignorant of this Transformation witness that mysterious Stanza of his the Meaning of which is now plain  Then a Ministry full wise  When they have spoil'd the Plotter's Guize  Shall hang a Man right quickely  Before he can plead his Belly  That the Ministry foresaw this great Change is plain from the  CallicoAct  whereby it is now become the Occupation of the Women all over  England  to convert their useless Female Habits into Beds WindowCurtains Chairs and Jointstools undressing themselves as it were before their Transformation  The Philosophy of this Transformation will not seem surprizing to People who search into the  Bottom  of Things Madam  Bourignon  a devout  French  Lady has shewn us how Man was at first created Male and Female in one Individual having the Faculty of Propagation within himself A Circumstance necessary to the State of Innocence wherein a Man's Happiness was not to depend upon the Caprice of another It was not till after he had made a  faux pas  that he had his Female Mate first join'd to him as the  Bohemian  Girls were join'd and then separated Many such Transformations of Individuals have been well attested particularly one by  Montaigne  and another by the late Bishop of  Salisbury  From all which it appears that this System of Male and Female has already undergone and may hereafter suffer several Alterations Every Smatterer in Anatomy knows that a Woman is but an introverted Man a new Fusion and  Flatus  will turn the hollow Bottom of a Bottle into a Convexity but I forbear for the Sake of my Men Readers who are in a few Days to be Virgins  In some Subjects the smallest Alterations will do some Men are sufficiently spread about the Hips and contriv'd with that Female Softness that they want only the Negative Quantity to make them Buxon Wenches and there are Women who are as it were already the  Ebauche  of a good sturdy Man If Nature cou'd be puzzl'd  it will be how to bestow the redundant Matter of the exuberant Bubbies that now appear about Town or to roll out the short dapper Fellows into wellsiz'd Women  Aristotle  has with great Nicety determin'd the Case of Eunuchs and Hermophrodites  The first  says he  will be transform'd into Barren Women  I suppose he means like a spay'd Hen  The second will change their predominant Inclination  I am glad of this Circumstance of Eunuchs because the Opera will not be interrupted by their big Bellies  This great Conjunction will begin to operate on  Saturday  the th Instant Accordingly about Eight at Night as  Senzino  begins  Si videte Did you but see  He shall be observ'd to make an unusual Motion upon which the Audience will be affected with a red Suffusion over their Countenance And because a strong Succussion of the Muscles of the Belly is necessary towards performing this great Operation both Sexes will be thrown into a profuse involuntary Laughter then to use the modest Terms of  Anaximander  shall negative Quantity be turn'd into positive  c  Time never beheld nor will it ever assemble such a Number of untouch'd Virgins within those Walls but alas such will be the Impatience and Curiosity of People to act in their new Capacity that many of them will go to Pot that very Night To prevent the Disorders that may happen upon this Occasion is the chief Design of this Paper  Gentlemen have begun already to make use of this Conjunction to compass their filthy Purposes They tell the Ladies forsooth that it is only parting with a perishable Commodity hardly of so much Value as a Callico Underpetticoat since like its Mistress it will be useless in the Form it is now in If the Ladies have no Regard to the Dishonour and Immorality of the Action I desire they will consider that Nature who never destroys her own Productions will exempt bigbelly'd Women till the Time of their Lyingin so that not to be transform'd will be the same as to be pregnant If they don't think it worth while to defend a Fortress that is to be demolish'd in a few Days let them reflect that it will be a melancholly thing Nine Months hence to be brought to Bed of a Bastard a posthumous Bastard as it were to which the  Quondam  Father can be no more than a dry Nurse  This wonderful Transformation is the Instrument of Nature to balance Matters between the Sexes Then shall the Cruelty of scornful Mistresses be return'd and they forc'd to sue to their new form'd Lovers with yet stronger Desires Happy Lovers shall repay in kind the Favours they have receiv'd and be as bless'd as their fellow Worms of the Earth who contemptible as they seem are fram'd by Nature to enjoy both Pleasures The slighted Maid shall grow into an imperious Gallant and reward her Undoer with a big Belly and a Bastard The Coquette Wife shall turn the jealous Husband and every Individual shall be able to decide the Question so much disputed concerning the comparative Delights of the Sexes  It is hardly possible to imagine the Revolutions that this wonderful Phaenomenon will occasion over the Face of the Earth I long impatiently to see the Proceedings of the Parliament of  Paris  as to the Title of  Succession to their Crown this being a Case not provided for by the  Salique  Law There will be no preventing Disorders amongst Friars and Monks for certainly Vows of Chastity don't bind but under the Sex in which they were made The same will hold good with Marriages tho' I think it will be a Scandal amongst Protestants for Husbands and Wives to part since there remains still a possibility to perform the  Debitum Conjugale  by the Husband being  femme Couverte  I submit it to the Judgment of the Gentlemen of the Long Robe whether this Transformation does not discharge all Suits of Rapes  The Pope must undergo a new groping but the false Prophet  Mahomet  has contriv'd Matters well for his Successors for as the Grand Signior has now a great many fine Women he will then have as many fine young Gentlemen at his Devotion  These are surprizing Scenes but I beg leave to affirm that the solemn Operations of Nature are Subjects of Contemplation but not of Ridicule therefore I make it my earnest Request to the merry Fellows and giggling Girls about Town that they would not put themselves in a high Twitter when they go to visit a General Lyingin of his first Child his Officers serving as Midwives Nurses and Rockers dispensing Caudle or if they behold the Reverend Prelates dressing the Heads and airing the Linnen at Court I beg they will remember that these Offices must be fill'd with People of the greatest Regularity and best Characters For the same Reason I am sorry that a certain Prelate who notwithstanding his Confinement still preserves his healthy chearful Countenance cannot come in time to be a Nurse at Court  I likewise earnestly intreat the Maids of Honour then Ensign and Captains of the Guards that at their first setting out they have some Regard to their former Station and not run wild through all the infamous Houses about Town That the present Grooms of the BedChamber the Maids of Honour would not eat Chalk and Lime in their GreenSickness And in general that the Men would remember that they are then become  Retromingent  and not by Inadvertency lift up against Walls and Posts Petticoats will not be burdensome to the Clergy but Balls and Assemblies will be indecent for some Time  As for you Coquettes Bawds and Chambermaids the future Ministers Plenipotentiaries and CabinetCounsellors to the Princes of the Earth manage the great Intrigues that will be committed to your Charge with your usual Secrecy and Conduct and the Affairs of your Masters will go better than ever  O ye  Exchange  Women our Right Worshipful Representatives that are to be be not so griping in the Sale of your Ware as your Predecessors but consider that the Nation like a spendthrift Heir has run out Be likewise a little more continent in your Tongues than you are at present else the Length of Debates will spoil your Dinners  You Housewively good Women who now preside over the Conjectionary henceforth Commissioners of the  Treasury  be so good as to dispense the Sugar Plumbs of the Government with a more impartial and frugal Hand Ye Prudes and censorious old Maids the Hopes of the  Bench  exert but your usual Talent of finding Faults and the Laws will be strictly executed only I would  not have you proceed upon such slender Evidences as you have done hitherto It is from you eloquent OysterMerchants of  Billingsgate  just ready to be call'd to the Bar and quoif'd like your SisterSerjeants that we expect the shortening the Time and lessening the Expences of LawSuits For I think you are observ'd to bring your Debates to a short Issue and even Custom will refrain you from taking the Oyster and leaving only the Shell to your Clients O ye Priests who now in a clandestine Way exercise your Office of coupling when you continue your Practice in a lower Sphere I question not but you will be more successful than you have been hitherto in pleasing both Parties O ye Physicians who in the Figure of old Women are to clean the Tripe in the Markets scour it as effectually as you have done that of your Patients and the Town will fare most deliciously on  Saturdays  I cannot but congratulate human Nature upon this happy Transformation the only Expedient left to restore the Liberties and Tranquility of Mankind which is so evident that it is almost an Affront to common Sense to insist upon the Proof it If there can be any such stupid Creature who doubts of it I desire he will make but the following obvious Reflection There are in  Europe  alone at present about a Million of sturdy Fellows under the Denomination of standing Forces with Arms in their Hands That those are Masters of the Lives Liberties and Fortunes of all the rest I believe no body will deny It is no less true in Fact that Reams of Paper and above a square Mile of Skins of Vellum have been employ'd to no Purpose to settle Peace amongst those Sons of Violence Pray who is he that will say unto them  Go and disband your selves  But lo by this Transformation it is done at once and the  Halcyon  Days of publick Tranquillity return For neither the military Temper nor Discipline can taint the soft Sex for a whole Age to come  Bellaque matribus invisa Wars odious now to Mothers  will not grow immediately palatable in their Paternal State  Nor will the Influence of this Transformation be less in FamilyTranquillity than it is in National Great Faults will be amended and Frailties forgiven on both Sides A Wife who has been disturb'd with late Hours and choak'd with the Hautgoût of a Sot will remember her Sufferings and avoid the Temptation and will for the same Reason indulge her Mate in his female Capacity in some Passions which she is sensible from Experience are natural to the Sex Such as Vanity of fine Cloaths being admir'd  c  And how tenderly must she use her Mate under the breeding Qualms and LabourPains which she felt her self In short all unreasonable Demands upon Husbands must cease because they are already satisfy'd from natural Experience that they are impossible That the Ladies may govern the Affairs of the World and the Gentlemen those of their Houshold better than either of them have hither done is the hearty Desire of  Their Most Sincere WellWisher ABRAHAM GUNTER  ADVERTISEMENTS  PLanetary Powders as
