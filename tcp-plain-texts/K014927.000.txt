 THE CELEBRATED SPEECH OF RICHARD BRINSLEY SHERIDAN  Esq  IN WESTMINSTERHALL ON THE d th th and th of JUNE ON HIS SUMMING UP THE EVIDENCE ON THE BEGUM CHARGE AGAINST WARREN HASTINGS ESQUIRE  LONDON PRINTED FOR C FOSTER POULTRY AND SOLD BY THE BOOKSELLERS IN PICCADILLY MDCCLXXXVIII Price Two Shillings ENTERED AT STATIONERS HALL  ADVERTISEMENT  THE Editor of Mr SHERIDAN'S Speech which has been collected with great diligence and corrected with great attention will make no apology for giving to the world the celebrated Oration which all the world could not possibly hear For arrangement of matter acuteness of observation pointedness of sarcasm and pathos of expression this Speech which excited expectation without disappointment has been seldom surpassed and  seldomer equalled It is however fair for Mr Hastings's friends to request that judgment may be suspended till the other side shall be heard since brilliancy of eloquence and cogency of proof have very different effects on judicious minds  th June  Mr  SHERIDAN  's SPEECH IN WESTMINSTER HALL  TUESDAY JUNE THE d  THE Court being seated precisely at twelve o'clock MR SHERIDAN aroseIt would be superfluous he observed for him to call the attention of their Lordships to the magnitude and importance of the subject before them to advert to the parties who were engaged in the business or to depict the situation of those multitudes who were ultimately to be affected All this had already been done by the Hon Gentleman Mr Burke who opened the prosecutionby him who alone was equal to the taskby him to whom mankind was indebted for the embodied stand which was now made in defence of the general rights of humanityNeither was it his intention to enter into any detail which might be deemed foreign to the queftion immediately before the Courthe would only indulge himself in a few words respecting some insinuations which had been thrown out against the persons concerned in this prosecution It had been whispered by whom he could not say that there was something malicious and something  perhaps too violent in the manner in which it had been conducted Speaking for himself and as far as the heart of man could be known for the other managers appointed by the Commons he would boldly assert that they had acted solely from conviction not a conviction born in error and nursed by prejudice but a conviction founded on deliberate and wellgrounded enquirythat they had proceeded not as rejoicing in punishment but impelled by a sanguine hope of remedyPersonal malice God forbid that they should indulge such a sensation against the unfortunate gentleman at the bar but how when they were to speak of Rapine of Cruelty and of Extortion could such ideas be conveyed but in consonant language There was undoubtedly a difference between Impeachment for capital Crimes and those for Misdemeanours only In proceedings on the former every latitude had been indulged by usage every aggravation was employed and every act of the Prisoner tortured into Criminality No such privilege was claimed by the managers on the present occasion but yet it should be considered by those whose pity seemed to rise in proportion with the guilt of its objectthat if such a mode of proceeding was admissible in the former Case where the life of the Prisoner was affected it was still more justifiable on an Impeachment like the present where the utmost consequences of guilt when proved would be but a  splendid exclusion  of the Criminal from that Society which he had injured or a  trifling deduction  from the spoils of a long continued Extortion  It had been observed what was undoubtedly true that no complaint from the natives of India had been presented in the course of these proceedings Those however who were first to make this observation were fully convinced that meekness in suffering was there a part of the national character and that their terrors had been too deeply impressed not to be long remembered But though a despair of British Justice had prevailed through that Peninsulathough their  subdued hearts could not even hope for reliefyet their claims on the Justice and Humanity of their Lordships were not thereby diminished but recommended He would not mention this Despair without accompanying the observation by proof he therefore read Extracts from two Letters the first lately received from Lord  Cornwallis  the second enclosed from Captain Kirkpatrick to his Lordship from both which it appeared that such was the prevailing sense through India of the injuries inflicted by the English and of their repeated violations of every compact that it would be long indeed before their confidence in English faith or their reliance on English justice could again be restored  To these complaints their Lordships were now to answer not by professions but by factsnot by remedial acts directed to the future but by an exemplary punishment inflicted on past delinquency It was incumbent on them to shew to the oppressed natives of India and to future Governors and Judges that there could be no authority so high no office so sacred as not to be subject to the paramount power of British JusticeHe did not however mean to say that the Example should be made unless the Guilt was first fully proved No God forbid that in this free and just land legal proof and legal guilt should ever be separated Though the greater part of the Evidence on this occasion had been with a few exceptions wrung from the unrelenting accomplices of the prisonerfrom men who had partook of the spoils and were involved in the guilt yet had he therefore no indulgence to demand nor had he to request that the Court should take that as evidence on this occasion which on any other they might deem themselves bound to refuse He on the contrary was now to bring forward to their Lordships a Mass of Evidence as full as strong as competent and as conclusive as ever established the guilt of a criminal or ever brought conviction home to the breasts of conscientious Judges In the performance of this task he observed he should have the less difficulty as  their Lordships had attended to the whole voluminous and complicated as it appeared with a diligence which did honor to their feelings and shewed their individual sense of the dignity of that high Tribunal which they collectively formed  The first part of this Evidence to which he should call the attention of the Court was the Defences delivered in by Mr Hastings to the House of Commons and to their Lordships On these as being the voluntary admissions of the Prisoner unextorted by any threat and unbiassed by any persuasion much stress had undoubtedly been laid To a part of these however an objection had been made the most extraordinary perhaps that had ever been advanced in a Court of Criminal Justicean objection which when Mr Hastings was well advised as he undoubtedly was when he was saved from his own  rash Guidance  the Managers could scarcely have expected This objection was that a Part of the  first  Defence in particular not having been written by Mr Hastings but by some of his friends that Gentleman was not bound by any admissions therein contained Mr Hastings on appearing at the Bar of the House of Commons had pleaded the haste in which he had written in palliation of his inaccuracies he had even made a merit of doing that himself which would be less dangerous if he had committed it to anotherBut now said Mr Sheridan that he finds that there is something more than inaccuracysomething fraught with that actual danger which he had apprehendedhe reverts to that plea which he had abandoned and declares that he had committed the trust to othersHe disclaims all his former merits and avers that in making up his tale he had not trusted solely to his own powersthat he had put his  Memory  into  Commission  and  parcelled  out his  Conscience  into different departments The structure it appeared went on whilst Mr Hastings was content with overseeing and cheering his Labourers "Mr Shore said he you will take care to make  me appear a good  Financier  Major Scott my  Judgment  is reposed in your hands Mr  Middleton  my HUMANITY is your'sThe work being thus done Mr Hastings surveyed it with a careless glance and adopted it as his own But now that its defects appear the Child of his Adoption becomes the object of his aversion his approbation ceases and his language is totally changedThe Defence is in general made up of general denials of the Charges intermixed with encomiums on his own conduct yet Mr Hastings exclaims "Subject me to all the other evidence against me I know I can trust to their want of Recollection and their force of AttachmentBare my bosom to every shaft of Enmity but save me from the  Perils  of my own  Panegyric  " The  haste  in which these productions were written was also alledged by Mr Hastings as an apology for every error but did it follow that because a man wrote rapidly he should also write falsely or was it that the truth and candour of Mr Hastings were so deeply buried in his bosom that long study alone could bring them upwards whilst the natural falshood floating on the surface could be transferred with extemporaneous readiness to every topic whether to be written or to be utteredThese were the apologies offered for the variations the admissions and the inconsistency of Mr Hastings's Defences but these it was to be hoped for the sake of propriety and good sense would never again be repeated  Mr Sheridan on quitting this subject entered into a very full and happy delineation of the situation of the Princesses of  Oude  No perusal of the Turkish History he observed nor attention to the precepts of the Mahometan religion could give their Lordships any idea of the manners of the women of high  casts  in Hindostan Educated in a profound respect to the customs of their Persian ancestors they maintained a purer style of Prejudice and a loftier degree of Superstition dwelling perpetually within the precincts of their Zenanas the Simplicity of their sentiments was equalled only by the  Purity of their conduct In those innocent retreats they were circumscribed not immured for such was the force of Prejudice that Liberty would be looked on as a curse to those to whom the common gaze of men would be regarded as an unexpiable violation However mistaken their ideas they were placed there by the hand of Piety and could not be disturbed but by a sacrilege They were as Relics on an altar which though deposited by Superstition none but the impious would disturb  In addition to those claims Mr Hastings himself had borne testimony to the Duty which Children owed to Parents in Hindostan yet the Bhow Begum or mother of the reigning Nabob had still stronger demands on the affection of her sonIn the year when  Sujah Dowlah  after the battle of Buxar was driven from that territory by the Englishwhich their politic Generosity afterwards restored she bore her private treasures to his assistance and was rewarded by the respectful attachment of his future life with the devise of all his territories to her son she had also interfered in a quarrel between her son and her husband and when the savage father was about to strike down his son with a sabre at the expence of her blood preserved that life which she gaveThese were pleas in her favor which would have exacted the reverence of any man  but one  But these pleas the sex the age and character of the Begums and what was yet more the deathbed recommendation of Sujah Dowlah were all of no weight with Mr Hastings This was therefore the object of the present chargethat where he owed protection he had been the severest oppressor that the weakness which should have claimed his aid but excited his violence that he had subjected the son thus to make him the ungracious instrument of his tyranny over the parent and had first made him a  slave  in order that he might becomea  monster  The interference of Mr  Bristow  in in the differences between the Begums and the Nabob in consequence  of the claims of the latter was the next ground of Mr SHERIDAN'S observationsMr Bristow had then in a conversation with the superior or elder Begum thrown out an insinuation that the treasures which she possessed were the treasures of the Stateand on this insinuation so termed by Mr Bristow himself had Mr Hastings founded all his arguments on that head and on which he lately appeared to place so much relianceThe Begums at that time gave up to the  Asoph ul Dowla  sums amounting to five hundred and fifty thousand poundsOf this a part was to be paid in goods which as they consisted of arms elephants c the Nabob alledged to be his property and refused to accept as payment This occasioned a dispute which was referred to the Board of  Calcutta  Mr Hastings then vindicated the right of the Begums to all the goods in the Zenana and brought over the majority of the Council to his opinion The ideas then placed on record he had since found it convenient to disown as belonging not to him but to the majority of the CouncilHow these opinions could be transferred it might be difficult for their Lordships though well informed of the effects of  Majorities  and  Minorities  to determine As well might Mr BURKE on a future day deliver an encomium on that  great  and  good  man Mr  Hastings  and if reminded of his share in the prosecution alledge that he was not accountable for so  nefarious  a proceeding that his opinions when once delivered were no longer his own that at the time he had constantly acted in a  Minority  The claims however it was observable of the Nabob as to the treasure of the Begums were at this time the only plea alledged for the seizure These were always founded on a passage of that  Koran  which was perpetually quoted but never provedNot a word was then mentioned of the strange rebellion which was afterwards conjured up and of which the  existence  and the  notoriety  were equally a secret A disaffection which was at its height at the very time when the Begums were dispensing their liberality to the Nabob  and exercising the greatest generosity to the English Officers in distressa disturbance in short without its parallel in history which was raised by two  Women  carried on by two  Eunuchs  and finally suppressed by an  Affidavit  Mr Sheridan then adverted to the negociations of Mr Middleton with the Begums in when the discontents of the superior Begum would have induced her to leave the country unless her authority was sanctioned and her property secured by the Guarantee of the CompanyThis Guarantee the Council or Mr Hastings had thought it necessary to deny as knowing that if the agreements with the Elder Begum were proved it would affix to Mr Hastings the guilt of all the sufferings of the Women of the Khord Mahal the revenues for whose support were secured by the same engagement In treating this part of the subject the principal difficulty arose from the  uncertain  evidence of Mr Middleton who though concerned in the negociation of  four  treaties could not recollect affixing his signature to  three  out of that number Mr Sheridan proved however from the evidence even of Mr Middleton that a Treaty had been signed in October wherein the rights of the Elder Begum were fully recognized a provision secured for the Women and Children of the late Vizier in the Khord Mahal and that those engagements had received the fullest sanction of Mr Hastings These facts were confirmed by the evidence of Mr Purling a gentleman who Mr Sheridan said had delivered himself fairly and as having no  foul secrets  to conceal He had transmitted copies of these engagements in to Mr Hastings at Calcutta the answer returned was that in arranging the taxes on the other districts he should pass over the Jaghires of the Begums No notice was then taken of any impropriety in the transactions in nor any notice given of an intended revocation of those engagements  But in June when General Clavering and Colonel Monson being no more and Mr Francis having returned  to Europe all the  hoard  and  arrear  of collected evil burst forth without restraint and Mr Hastings determined on his Journey to the Upper Provincesit was then that without adverting to intermediate transactions he met with the Nabob Asoph ul Dowlah at Chunar and received from him the mysterious present of lTo form a proper idea of this transaction it was only necessary to consider the respective situation of him who gave and him who received this presentIt was not given by the Nabob from the superflux of his wealth nor in the abundance of his esteem for the man to whom it was given it was on the contrary a prodigal bounty drawn from a country depopulatedno matter whether by natural causes or by the grinding of Oppression It was raised by an exaction which took what Calamity had spared and Rapine overlookedand pursued those angry dispensations of Providence when a  prophetic  chastisement had been inflicted on a  fated  realmThe secrecy which had marked this transaction was not the smallest proof of its criminality When  Benaram Pundit  had a short time before made a present to the Company of a lack of rupees Mr Hastings in his own language deemed it "worthy the praise of being recorded" But in this instance when ten times that sum was given neither Mr Middleton nor the Council were acquainted with the transaction until Mr Hastings four months after felt himself compelled to write an account to England and the intelligence returned thus circuitously to his friends in IndiaIt was peculiarly observable in this transaction how much the  Distresses  of the different parties were at variance Mr Hastings travels to the Nabob to see no doubt and enquire into his  Distresses  but immediately takes from him l to be applied to the necessities of the  distressed  EastIndia Company But on farther deliberation these considerations vanish a  third  object arises more worthy than either of the former and the money is taken from the one and  demanded from the other to be applied to the use ofthe  distressed  Mr Hastings  The money it was alledged by Mr Hastings had been originally taken to discharge the Arrear of the Army It had not been applied to that use because it was received in bills on Gopal Dos a rich Banker of Benares who was then kept a prisoner by Cheit SingMajor Scott being questioned on the subject declared that bills on Gopal Dos were as good as cash for that though the principal of the house was a prisoner that circumstance made no difference whatsoever with the other partners Thus Mr Hastings was inconsistent with himself by alledging an objection which should have prevented his taking the money in the first instance for the purpose he had stated and Major Scott contradicting Mr Hastings removed the objection and restored the business to its original footingBut through all those windings of mysterious Hypocrisy and of artificial Concealment it was easy to mark the sense of hidden Guilt Mr Hastings himself being driven from every other hold advanced the stale plea of  State Necessity  but of this necessity he had brought no proof it was a necessity which listened to whispers for the purpose of crimination and dealt in rumour to prove its own existenceTo a General leading the armies of Britain to an Admiral bearing her thunders over the seasthe plea of Necessity might be indulged if the wants of those were to be supplied whose blood had been spilt in the service of their country but then like the imperial eagle descending from its nest though it desolated the skirts of the rock the Motive and the Conduct would be equally conspicuous No concealment would then be necessary and they would disdain the veil which covered the dark mean arts of busy Peculation  On the business of the Treaty of Chunar which succeeded the acceptance of this bribe Mr Sheridan was equally perspicuous and equally severe It was a proceeding he observed  which as it had its beginning in Corruption had its continuance in Fraud and its end in Violence The first proposition of the Nabob after his recent liberality was that the army should be removed and all the English recalled from his dominions The Bribe which he had given was the obvious price of their removal He felt the weight of their oppressionhe knew to speak his own language "that when the English staid they staid to ask for something" Though their predecessors had exhausted the revenue though they had shaken the tree until nothing remained upon its  leafless  branches yet a new flight was on the wing to watch the first  buddings  of its prosperity and to nip every promise of future luxuriance  To this demand Mr Hastings had promised to accede and to recal every Englishman from the province but by an evasion which Mr Middleton disclosed with so much difficulty to their Lordships on the last day of his appearance the promise was virtually recalled No  orders  were afterwards given for the establishment of Englishmen in the province but  recommendations  of the same effect with Mr Middleton and the Vizier were sent and the practice continuedIn the agreement respecting the Refumption of the Jaghires the Nabob had been duped by a similar deception He had demanded and obtained leave to resume those of certain individuals Mr Hastings however defeated the permission by making the order general knowing that there were some favourites of the Nabob whom he could be by no means brought to dispossessSuch was the conduct of Mr Hastings not in the moment of cold or crafty policy but in the hour of confidence and the effervescence of his gratitude for the favour he had just received Soaring above every common feeling he could deceive the man to whose liberality he stood indebtedeven his  Gratitude  was  perilous  and a  danger  actually awaited on the return which he was to make to an effusion of generosity  The transactions in which Sir  Elijah Impey  bore a share and the tenor of his evidence were the next objects of Mr Sheridan's animadversionThe late Chief Justice of Bengal he remarked had repeatedly stated that Mr Hastings left Calcutta with  two  Resources in his viewthose of  Benares  and of  Oude  It appeared however from every circumstance that the latter resource was never in his contemplation until the insurrections in Benar  terminating in the capture of Bedjeygur had destroyed all his hopes in that province At that instant the min  of Mr Hastings fertile in resources fixed itself on the Treasures of the Begums and Sir Elijah Impey was dispatched to collect materials for their crimination "But I have ever thought" said Mr Sheridan "the selection of such a personage for such a purpose one of the greatest aggravations of the guilt of Mr Hastings"That he the purity of whose character should have influenced his conduct even in his most domestic retirements that he who if consulting the dignity of British Justice should have remained as stationary as his Court in Calcuttathat such a man should be called to travel  Five Hundred  miles for the transaction of such a business was a deviation without a plea and a degradation without exampleThis however was in some degree a question to be abstracted for the consideration of those who adorned and illumined the seats of Justice in Britain and the purity of whose character precluded the necessity of any further observations on so different a conduct  With respect to the manner in which Sir Elijah Impey had delivered his evidence it required some observation though made without imputing to that gentleman the smallest culpability Sir Elijah had admitted that in giving his evidence he had never answered without looking equally to the probability and the consequences of the fact in question Sometimes he had even admitted circumstances of which he had no recollection beyond the mere probability that they  had taken place By consulting in this manner what was  probable  and the contrary he might certainly have corrected his memory at times and Mr Sheridan said he would accept that mode of giving his testimony provided that the inverse of the proposition might also have place and that where a circumstance was  improbable  a similar degree of credit might be subtracted from the testimony of the witness  Five  times in the House of Commons and  twice  in that Court for instance had Sir Elijah Impey borne testimony that a rebellion was raging at Fyzabad at the time of his journey to Lucknow Yet on the  eighth  examination he had contradicted all the former and declared that what he meant was that the rebellion  had  been raging and the country was then in some degree restored to quietThe reasons assigned for the former errors were that he had forgotten a letter received from Mr Hastings informing him that the rebellion was quelled and that he had also forgotten his own proposition of travelling through Fyzabad to Lucknow With respect to the letter nothing could be said as it was not in evidence but the other observation would scarcely be admitted when it was recollected that in the House of Commons Sir Elijah Impey had declared that it was his proposal to travel through Fyzabad which had originally brought forth the information that the way was obstructed by the rebellionFrom this information Sir Elijah Impey had gone by the way of Illyabadbut what was yet more singular was that on his return he would again have returned by the way of Fyzabad if he had not been again informed of the dangerso that had it not been for these friendly informations the Chief Justice would have run plump into the very  focus  of the rebellionThere were two circumstances however worthy of remarkthe  first  was that Sir  Elijah Impey  should when charged with so dangerous a commission as that of procuring evidence to prove that the  Begums  had meditated the expulsion of their son from the Throne and of the English from Bengal  should twice intend to pass through the city of their residenc and that he as he alledged from mere motives of schoolboy coriosity should choose the  primrose  pathand with when engaged in such a business to loiter in the way and idle in the sunshineThe second circumstance worthy of observation was that if a conclusion could be made from a cloud of circumstances the inference on this occasion would undoubtedly be that Sir Elijah Impey was dissuaded by Mr Hastings and Mr Middleton from passing by the way of Fyzabad as well knowing that if as a friend to Mr Hastings he were to approach the Begums he would be convinced by his reception that nothing could be more foreign from the truth than the idea of their supposed disaffection It was also observable that Sir Elijah Impey at Lucknow taking evidence in the face of day in support of this charge of rebellion against the Begums when conversing with the Nabob and his Minister heard not a single word from either of a rebellion by which it was proposed to dethrone the Nabob and to change the Government of his dominionsAnd equally unaccountable it appeared that Sir Elijah Impey who had advised the taking of those affidavits for the safety of Mr Hastings had never read them at the time for the purpose of seeing whether they were sufficient for the purpose or the contraryAfter so long a reserve however and after declaring on oath that he thought it unnecessary the next step taken by Sir Elijah Impey was to read the affidavits as however late they might contribute something to his information He had been led to this study by his own allegation from having been misted by Mr SHERIDAN one of the managers on the part of the Commons who by looking at a book which he held in his hand had persuaded him to declare that a sworn interpreter was present on the receiving of thoseaffidavits that Major Davy was present for that purposeand that whoever it was he was perfectly satisfied with his conduct on the occasion when it was actually in evidence that no interpreter whatsoever  was presentNow said Mr Sheridan how I by merely looking into a book could  intimate  the presence of an interpreter could  inculcate  the assistance of Major Davy and could also  look  the satisfaction conceived by Sir Elijah Impey are questions which I believe that Gentleman alone is able to determine  He should admit however he said that Sir Elijah Impey had not strictly attended to forms on the occasion of taking those affidavits that he had merely directed the bible to be given to the Whites and the Koran to the Blacks and had packed up in his wallet the returns of both without any further enquiry or that he had glanced over them in India having previously cut off all communication between his  eye  and his  mind  so that no consciousness was transferred from the former to the latter and that he had read them in England if possible with less informationhowever strange these circumstances might be he would admit them all he would even admit that the affidavits were legally and properly takenand yet would prove that those affidavits were not sufficient to sustain any one point of criminality against those who were the subjects of the present Charge  Adjourned to Friday  Mr  SHERIDAN  's SPEECH CONTINUED  FRIDAY JUNE THE th  MR SHERIDAN then resumed his speech where he had left off on Tuesday last with a short preface to the following effect  In obedience to the commands of the Honourable Managers he said he rose to continue the observations which he had to make in summing up the evidence on the second Charge against Warren Hastings EsqIn doing this he trusted it would be believed that he had been and would continue to be most guarded in quoting the evidence on which he might have to animadvert correctly and accurately and that for this purpose he had left off where he did a part of what he wished to observe on not being in the way He left off at the affidavits and here it was that he meant to resume his speech he considered their Lordships as in fact  employ  d in trying the truth of the matter of those affidavits and the allegations therein contained upon which he would have no objection to rest the whole truth of the charge brought against the prisoner It was in this view and for this purpose that he wished to take up some part of their Lordships time but before he entered into the discussion of the affidavits there were two or three matters on which he was desirous of saying a few words In the outset of this business it had been held forth as an allegation on the part of the prisoner at the bar and as an excuse of the atrocious proceeding against the Begums that they had been guilty of various acts of hostility as well as of a wish to dethrone the Nabob and it was assorted that the affidavits taken at Lucknow all tended to prove these facts Of the first of these two allegations he challenged the Counsel for the prisoner to produce a single instance drawn from those affidavits There was not a single instancenay the allegation was even abandoned by themselvesa pretty strong proof that it had been taken up lightly When a charge consisted of two parts and one of them was abandoned it was very natural for a man to distrust the other It certainly was not a proof that the other was false also nor did he mean to assume any such argument he said only that it would influence the mind so far as to make it curious and particular in the enquiry and to make it at least distrust the truth of the other branch of the charge also But their Lordships in this particular case would have additional reason for jealousy and distrust they would recollect from whom these assertions and charges against the Begums came and by whom they were made they were made by Mr Hastings who went forth from Calcutta in the year for the avowed purpose of collecting a large sum of money and who acknowledged that he had but two resources Here then we had in the same person the accuser and the judgenay more we had a judge corruptly interested in the accusation he was to make and who intended to draw a profit and reap an advantage  from deciding on the accusation which he himself made He would not take up their Lordships time in sayinga word on the gross turpitude of such a double character nor on the frontless disregard of all the feelings which ought to actuate the human heart in thus mixing characters that ought never to be joined What did he desire from all this Only that an accusation made under such circumstances should not meet with implicit belief and that their Lordships remembering that it was so made would accompany him through the discussion of the affidavits free and uninfluenced by those prefatory and general assertions  The next matter that he was anxious to pross on their consideration previous to his taking up the affidavits was the infinite improbability of such an intention being true from the utter impossibility of executing the design Estimating the power of the Begums at the most sanguine standard it could not evidently be in their reach to accomplish any overthrow decisive or momentary of the Nabob much less of the English He was not however so weak as to assert a doctrine that because a thing was improbable it was not therefore attempted or that because they had no interest in the accomplishment of the object they therefore did not undertake it He could not look to Mr Hastings without knowing and being forced to acknowledge that there were people with such a perverse turn of mind as to prosecute mischief without interest and that there were passions in the human soul which lead to turpitude without a motive  He now came to the consideration of the affidavitsthat mass of legal evidence on which the prisoner meant to rest his defence and which he considered of so much consequence to his acquittal on this charge He had said that when the Honourable Mover of the Impeachment came to this charge he treated the affidavits in his peculiar manner and loaded them with terms of opprobrious reproach What the peculiar manner of his Honourable Friend was as hinted in this  manner he could not tell but he for his own part would say that if they were treated otherways than with disdain they had not their desert It was asserted that they were taken in the desire of procuring the best possible evidence of the state of the country and of the circumstances of the insurrection This was a direct falshoodthey were taken for no other purpose but that of justifying Mr Hastings in his plunder of the Begums that no other intention was in the minds of any of the persons concerned and that the design was not formed until by the failure of one of his resources this only remained for the plunderer  He left off with the crippled testimony of his friend Dewen Sing Here then he began and he entered into a minute discussion of all the affidavits reading comparing and commenting on the passages To enumerate all these would require much space nor unless the reader was well acquainted with all the facts would it be possible for us to make him taste and feel the strength of Mr Sheridan's reasoning which was as close connected and convincing as any speech we ever heard on any occasion He particularly animadverted on the affidavits of Hyder Beg Cawn who though the Minister of the Nabob and the man of all others the best acquainted with the transactions then passing in the country did not say one syllable on the subject of the pretended rebellion nor hint any thing of the kind and this though the affidavit was made in November and the rebellion was pretended to have been at least previous to that timeon that of Mr Middleton which also was taken on the th of November and that after he knew the pleasure of Mr Hastings as to the plunder of the Begums The only passage which his affidavit contained respecting the insurrection was that he had heard from rumour that they had given much encouragement and some aid to the Jaghiredars in resisting the resumption and that he heard there had been a good disposition in them towards the Rajah Cheit Sing The whole of his evidence went on mere hearsay  and rumour and it amounted to much encouragemet and some aidon which circumstance it was that he made up his conscience to the plunder and probably to the destruction of the ladies He knew nothing of it himself though he was the Resident He saw no insurrection he met with no indispositions he knew nothing of it himself but he had heard that they had encouraged the Jaghiredars to resist and on this and no more was this conscientious servant of Mr Hastings ready to execute any scheme of plunder that he should deviseThe Hon Manager also particularly adverted to the affidavit of Major M 'Donald of Captain Gordon and of a Frenchman whose deposition was quite in the French style magnificent and glittering it talked of his having penetrated the desartsof his having seen tygersof his having kept the best companyand heard a vast number of important rumours but not one word about the rebellion of the BegumsHe went through the affidavits of Colonel Hannay and among others to that stating that three Zemindars on the st of December had said that they were credibly informed that there was a design in the Begums against the Nabob But these conscientious Serjeants would not suffer their names to be mentioned all the reward that they expected was to be concealed although they were thus rendering service to their Sovereign and that that Sovereign was now in entire possession of power and free from all possible effects of any meditated hostility from the quarter alledged to have designs  Having stated the contents of the several affidavits he said he knew that in a Court of Law if the trial were depending merely on the truth and validity of these affidavits he should be stopt if he attempted to begin any answer to and observation upon them He should be told from the BenchWhat do you mean to answer There is nothing contained in these affidavits upon which we can suffer you to take up the time of the Court one minute There is not from the beginning to the end one particle of legal substantial  or even a defensible proof Nothing but hearsay and rumour Such he knew would be the admonition which he should receive in any Court of Law but meaning and wishing to meet every thing at their Lordship's bar on which the prisoner could build the smallest degree of dependance it was his wish to examine separately the points which it was the aim of the prisoner to set up by these affidavits They were three in number and he should treat of each singly  That the Begums gave assistance to the Rajah Cheyt Sing  That they encouraged and assisted the Jaghiredars to resist the resumptions of the Jaghires  And That they were the principal movers of all the commotions in Oude  Th  se were the three allegations which it was meant to insinuate these affidavits containedand all these were accompanied with a general charge that the Begums were in rebellion He declared that in regard to the last insinuation he had searched with all the indefatigable industry of an antiquary hunting for a precious vestige that was to decide some important point in history for this rebellion But of this rebellion which in the mouth of Mr Hastings was spoken of with as much certainty as that of was mentioned in England no trace nor appearance could he findHe could neither find the place where it raged nor time when No battle had been foughtno army had marchedno blood had been spiltnot one single thing had happened by which any one creature in the country where it was said to happen could possibly have discovered that a rebellion was there It was a rebellion that never struck a blow and that never was struckIt was a rebellion the object of which was unnatural but which died a natural death If rebellions of such a kind could be there was no saying where a rebellion might not exist Perhaps at the very moment that he was speaking there might be a rebellion  raging in the heart of London Perhaps it might be at this moment lying perdue in some of the adjacent villages or like the ostentatious encampment that had given celebrity to Brentford and Ealing it might have taken up its head quarters at Hammersmith or Istington ready to pour down its violence on the approach of night He was very eager to ascertain the time of this horrid rebellion There was nothing so clear and manifest as this factthat there was none in the beginning of August On the th of that month there were confidential letters from Col Morgan the commanding officer and there was not one syllable in these letters of any such thing He afterwards detache  troops from Cawn Poote and on the th of September he gives an account of some insurrection at Lucknow but of none at Fyzabad nor of any thing like it There was a letter from Major Hannay then at the Rajah's Court dated the th of September in which there is an account of the state of the Rajah's affairs but not one syllable of any design of his being assisted by the Begums There was after this a letter from the same Court communicating the refources of the Rajah In this letter he was advised to apply to the Nabob himself from whom there was a probability of his receiving succour but not to apply to Hyder Beg who was stated to be interest of the English During all this time therefore there was no rebellion The Nabob went to see his mother the very lady who was said to have risen in rebellion against him But Mr Middleton stated that he was accompanied by horse having no martial memory on common occasions Mr Middleton could exactly tell that these troops kept pace with the Nabob who travelled very fast so much so that he could hardly keep up with him but the Nabob having according to Mr Middleton taken horse with him he observed the Counsel seized on the horse and certainly meant to assert that these horse were taken for no other purpose than to quell the insurrection unfortunately however for the  martial memory of Mr Middleton Captain Edwards who was rather more of a military man and whose duty it was to accompany the Nabob stated that he had but five or six hundred horse and those so miserably equipped and so bad that they were not able to keep up with him and but a few indeed were near his person or within the reach of any command so as to be applied to any service for of these few the most were disaffected and mutinous from being ill paid so that the horse that he had with him were rather disposed to assist than to quell any insurrections Still more unfortunately the memory of Mr Middleton had unexpectedly cleared up and informed the Court that it was a constant thing for the Princes of India to travel with a great equipage and that it was considered as a disrespect to the person whom they visited to come unattended But the Counsel should have the whole of the horse camels elephants and all and they should all gallop as fast as they might please to wishWhat did they mean or wish to establish from this fact It never was their intention to insinuate that the Nabob went to pay his respects to his mother unattended by his retinue He could not mean to go  incog  unless he wished to keep pace with the rebellionThat hearing of a rebellion of two old women without an army he thought that it should be quelled by a Prince in disguise without his guards They did not mean to say that the Indian Princes travelled like the Princes of Europe who sometimes from one motive and sometimes from anotherat times from political views and at times from curiositytravelling some to France to learn manners others to England to learn libertychose to be relieved from the pomps of state and from the drudgery of equipageIt was not so in India where the manners required ostentation and where it would be considered as an insult for one Prince to visit another without maintaining his state  He then as he said would put to the route a thousand audges who were said to be dispatched by the Begums for  the purpose of promoting an insurrection He detected all the contradictory accounts that had been given of these matchlockmen and having shewn the complete fallacy attempted to be imposed on the credulity of the world in this instance he asked why the younger son of the Bhow Begum had not been suspected of having any concern or interest in this rebellion This particularly had been very thoroughly explained Sir Elijah Impey had been asked whether this Prince had any wealthNo nonehe was miserably poor and was a pensionerthere was the solution of the difficulty There never was in the mind of Mr Hastings a suspicion of  treason  where there was not  treasure  Penury was a complete and satisfactory proof that he could not be disaffected opulence on the contrary was a manifest indication of disloyalty Mr Hastings in his political sagacity took the converse of the doctrine that the experience of history had established that opulence and wealth as they attached a man to the country where they lay made him cautious and circumspect how he hazarded any enterprize that might draw on himself the jealousy of Government Poverty on the other hand made a man giddy and desperate having no permanent stake he was easily seduced into commotion Mr Hastings on the contrary never failed to find a convincing and selfevident proof of attachment in penury and an unanswerable evidence of rebellion in wealth  In enumerating the various strong instances of the steady friendship and good disposition of the Begums to the English interests Mr Sheridan particularly animadverted on the representation they had made in favour of Captain whose life they had saved at the very moment when if they had meant to strike any blow against the English interests the blow would have been feltThis gentleman whose life the Bhow Begum had saved and who in the first and natural feelings of the soul had repeatedly poured forth his grateful acknowledgements of the obligation had afterwards been made the instrument of the destruction of his faviour  It had been asked why the Managers had not called Captain to the barWhy call him to the barHe never hoped to see him at the bar till he came there with fervent contrition and penitentiary zeal to make atonement to the Princess who was to him his second creator and whom with the breath of life the gift of the Begum he had accused and in the presence of their common God had solemnly poured forth a part of that breath in an affidavit by which her ruin was to be accomplished He would not believe it possible that after having repeatedly acknowledged that he owed his life and liberty to the beneficent hand of this Lady he could so far forget all that he owed as of his own mere motion to come forward and make this affidavit His knowledge of human feelings would not permit him to believe that it could be possible for any human creature to be guilty of an act so atrociousHe must imagine that the Gentleman had been deluded and imposed uponthat he had been falsely and scandalously deceivedand that at the moment when he made that affidavit he was ignorant of the use to which it was to be appliedHe hoped and trusted that seeing that he was made the instrument of the ruin and overthrow of his benefactress he would come forward and state the imposition that had been practised upon himfor he could not be persuaded that any human creature could be capable of standing up in the presence of God and exclaiming To this woman I owe my life and my gratitude shall be her destruction  Mr Sheridan continued in a strain of eloquence more lofty and commanding than any thing we ever heard to state the circumstance of the book the leaves of which were torn out and which was mutilated for the purpose of concealment After stating all the circumstances of this fact and the manner in which the fact had been accounted for he called it a black perjuryThen rising in his eloquence to a flight beyond our power to trace him he said that these letters though thus torn and mangled were brought  lightThat power which gives to the arms of infant innocence the strength of Herculeswhich controuls the mighty and abashes the confidentwhich gives to truth persuasion beyond the reach of eloquencethe look that appallsthe supplicating tear that softensthe tone tender but confirmed which at once foothes and convinces the soulthat power which in all the turns and windings of hypocritical and impudent falsehood ever ranges on the side of simple and unobtruding truth leads the mind through all the mazes of craft and wickedness with which this mysterious villainy is covered and arousing all the indignation of justice points its punishment Heavendirected to the head of the detested but unrepenting author  Mr Sheridan proceeded to shew in how many instances and at what critical times the sincere friendship of the Begums had distinguished itself and been exerted in our favour In that critical moment when after the affair of Captain Gordon the interests of Mr Hastings were according to his own account almost desperate during the whole time from the d of August to the d of September when with a prodigality of truth he truly confessed that the situation of himself and his small party was desperate when the hoarded vengeance of Heaven was about to burst and seemed to wait only for the completion of his guilt in the attempt on Cheit Sing to break on his head and precipitate him to ruinwhat did they do Instead of seizing on the crisis to carry into effect any scheme they might have engendered against himinstead of accomplishing his overthrow which with their aid would at that moment have been certain these women with a nobleness worthy of the sex though ill applied as to the object came forward to share in not to contribute to his fall  So much as to the first head of charge against the Begums The second charge that of their assisting the Jaghiredars he should say but little on We learned in February of the Begums having countenanced the resistanceTrue  And they now gave this presumed countenance discovered in February as a reason which operated to the ruin of the Princesses in November He took notice also of the curious circumstance of Mr Middleton's sending back the troops at the desire of the Nabob but stating that having done so the Nabob must pay an extraordinary price in future as these troops might be employed against his own Aumeels  He now came to the third charge said to be established by those affidavitsThat the Begums had been the principal movers of all the commotions in Oude and here he confessed he thought there was such a body of damning evidence as required only to be stated and which would render all elucidation unnecessary The commotions in Oude were simply and solely to be attributed to the English gentlemen The Nabob's description of their rapacity and violence was itself a full extention of all that was now to be attributed to the poor old women He gave a very particular account of their depredations They had but one argument consisting of two words They wanted all the money that could possibly be raised in the country by violence by extortion by rapine or by stealth but for two purposes to pay the army and fee the administration of Justice He stated the various steps which had been taken by the Nabob to deliver his devoted country from their violence and particularly from the vulture grasp of Colonel Hannay until at length as Major Naylor wrote a gentleman whose soul possessed the qualities of his species "the inhabitants whose meek natures no irritation had been theretofore able to provoke were at length goaded into tumult and in their despair that meekness that yielding and womanish softness which characterized every action changed to a persevering obstinacy that was not to be subdued"So that on the banks of the Ganges where the insurrection happened the routed would not fly the wounded would not suffer themselves to be curedHere again we had opened to us another vein of the richest and  purest eloquence and which in daring to touch we are sensible we shall debase  If exclaims Mr Sheridan if a stranger had at this tim in gone into the kingdom of Oude ignorant of what had happened since the death of Sujah Dowla that man who with a savage heart had still great lines of character and who with all his ferocity in war had still with a cultivating hand preserved to his country the riches which it derived from benignant skies and a prolific soilif this stranger ignorant of all that had happened in the short interval and observing the wide and general devastation and all the horrors of the sceneof plains uncloathed and brown of vegetation burnt up and extinguishedof villages depopulated and in ruinof temples unroofed and perishingof reservoirs broken down and dryhe would naturally enquire what war has thus laid waste the fertile fields of this once beautiful and opulent countrywhat civil dissensions have happened thus to tear asunder and separate the happy societies that once possessed those villagesWhat disputed successionWhat religious rage has with unholy violence demolished those temples and disturbed servent but unobtruding piety in the exercise of its dutiesWhat merciless enemy has thus spread the horrors of fire and swordWhat severe visitation of Providence has thus dried up the fountains and taken from the face of the earth every vestige of greenOr rather what monsters have stalked over the country tainting and poisoning with pestiferous breath what the voracious appetite could not devourTo such question what must be the answer No wars have ravaged these lands and depopulated these villagesNo civil discords have been feltNo disputed successionNo religious rage No merciless enemyNo affliction of Providence which while it scourged for the moment cut off the sources of resuscitation No voracious and poisoning monstersNoAll this has been accomplished by the  friendship    generosity  and  kindness  of the English nationThey have embraced us with  their protecting armsand lo these are the fruits of their allian  What then shall we be told that under such circumstances the exasperated feelings of a whole people thus goaded and spurred on to clamour and resistance were excited by the poor and feeble influence of the Begums When we hear from Capt Naylor the description that he gives of the paroxism fever and delirium into which despair had thrown the natives when on the banks of the polluted Ganges panting for death they tore more widely open the lips of their gaping wounds to accelerate their dissolution and while their blood was issuing presented their ghastly eyes to Heaven breathing their last and fervent prayer that the dry earth might not be suffered to drink their blood but that it might rise up to the throne of God and rouse the eternal Providence to avenge the wrongs of their country Will it be said that all this was brought about by the incantations of these Begums in their secluded Zenana or that they could inspire this enthusiasm and this despair into the breasts of a people who felt no grievance and had suffered no torture What motive then could have such influence in their bosoms What motive That which Nature the common parent plants in the bosom of man and which though it may be less active in the Indian than in the Englishman is still congenial with and makes a part of his beingThat feeling which tells him that man was never made to be the property of man but that when in the pride and insolence of power one human creature dares to tyrannize over another it is a power usurped and resistance is a dutyThat feeling which tells him that all power is delegated for the good not for the injury of the people and that when it is converted from the original purpose the compact is broken and the power is to be resumed That principle which tells him that resistance to power usurped is not merely a duty which he owes to himself and to his neighbour but a duty which he owes to his God in asserting and maintaining the rank which he gave  him in his creationTo that common God who where he gives the  form  of  man  whatever may be the complexion gives also the  feelings  and the  rights  of  man  That principle which neither the rudeness of ignorance can stifle nor the enervation of resinement extinguishThat principle which makes it base for a man to suffer when he ought to act which tending to preserve to the species the original designations of Providence spurns at the arrogant distinctions of man and vindicates the independent quality of his race  Mr Sheridan after this proceeded to say that he thought an attentive perusal of all the circumstances as he had endeavoured to exhibit them to the view of their Lordships would satisfy them of the innocence of the Begums But he was sensible that the proof of their innocence carried with it no conclusive proof of the guilt of the prisoner and this was the next object of his speech In a close chain of argument he proved that the rebellion was not projectedwas not even in the imagination of Mr Hastings until their ruin had been determined that the rebellion was an afterthought and was taken up as a means of justification in the consciousness that justification was necessary To prove this he shewed that he never wrote to the Council until the month of February that though he wrote letters to Mr Wheeler and though in his famous narrative he called the God of Truth to witness that he had made no concealment he concealed every particle both of the rebellion and of the plunder until he had been able to make up the body of rant and craft rhapsody and enigma which he produced under the title of "A Narrative of the Transactions" He shewed that his pretended reasons for the concealment of five months were direct fallacies and having taken pains to elucidate these points he said that it had been a practice with Mr Hastings to hold himself out as a preternatural being gifted with good fortune or else the peculiar favourite of Heaven and that Providence never failed to take up and carry by wise but hidden means every project of his  to its destined end In this blasphemous way did the prisoner at the bar libel the course of Providence Thus according to him when his corruptions and briberies were on the eve of exposure Providence inspired the heart of Nundcomar to commit a low base crime in order to save Mr Hastings from ruin Thus also when in his attempts on Cheyt `Sing and his plunder of the Begums Providence stepped in and inspired the one with resistance and the other with rebellion to forward his purposes Thus did he arrogantly hold himself forth as a man not only the favourite of Providence but as one for whose sake Providence departed from the eternal course of its own wise dispensations Thus did he presume to say that he was honoured and assisted in the administration of office by inspired felonies heaven born armies and providential treasons arraigning that Providence whose works are goodness and whose ways are right  It seemed through the whole of his defence upon this charge that Mr Hastings sensible that truth would undo him thought that falshood of any nature would serve his turn In this view he had drawn together a set of falsehoods without consistency and without connection not knowing or not remembering that there is nothing which requires so much care in the fabrication as a system of lies The series must be regular and unbroken but his falshoods were eternally at variance and demolished one another Indeed in all his conduct he seemed to be actuated but by one principleto do things contrary to the established form This architecture militated against the first principles of the art He begun with the frieze and the capital and laid the base of the column at the top Thus having his house turned upside down he plumed himself on the novelty of his idea till it came trembling about his ears His fortification was equal to his architecture He raised a rampart on a spot which the enemy might command he meant to surround himself with a fosse but left an opening for the  assailant He built on a precipice and encamped on a mine  Perhaps it might be said that that guilt could not be great where the veil with which it was covered was so thin He was not of this opinion His honourable and exalted friend who had opened generally to their Lordships the articles of Impeachment and whose name he never could mention but with the respect and admiration due to his virtue and his talents whose proud disdain of vice could only be equalled by the ability with which he corrected it whose eloquence was not transitory as happily there were portions of it that would be felt and admired when all of the assembly then present would be mute and most of them forgotten his honourable friend had said in opening the charges "that there was something in the nature and conformation of vice which made it inconsistent with prudence" He could not agree implicitly with his honourable friend in this sentiment If the true definition of prudence were the discrete management and conduct of a purpose to its successful end he thought he could imagine to himself instances in which this species of prudence might be discovered in minds distinguished by the atrocity of their acts When he observed the actions of a Philip of Macedon of a Caesar of a Cromwell he could perceive great guilt successfully conducted to its end if not by legitimate prudence at least by consummate craft It was therefore his opinion that the doctrine of his honourable friend held true only in those minds which could not be satisfied with the indulgence of a single crime where instead of one base masterpassion having the complete sway to which all the faculties were subject and on which alone the mind was bent there was a combustion and rivalry among a number of bad passions where pride vanity avarice lust of power cruelty and so forth all at once actuated the human soul and distracted its functions all of them clamouring for destruction and each in it own barbarous jargon preferring its claimall dissonant  and tumultuousall of them struggling for preeminence and each counteracting the other In such a mind undoubtedly great crimes could never be accompanied by prudence There was a fortunate disability occasioned by the contention that rescued the human species from the villainy of the intention Such was the original denunciation of Nature Not so was it with the pure passions in the breast where they resided the harmony was never interrupted by the number a perfect and substantial agreement gave an accession of vigour to each and spreading their influence in every direction like the divine intelligence and benignity from which they flowed all of them filling their several spaces some in their larger some in their more contracted orbits moving by sweet consent in their allotted placethey secured true glory and happiness to the individual by whom they were possessed and extended it to the community of which he was a member  Mr Sheridan was then proceeding to shew that the Nabob had violated the covenant of Nature in rising up against his mother but that to this shameless outrage he was driven by the tyranny of the prisoner who as he had before said had made him a  slave  to compel him to become a  monster  Adjourned to Tuesday  MR SHERIDAN'S SPEECH CONTINUED  TUESDAY JUNE THE th  MR SHERIDAN began without any other preface than this that relying on the indulgence with which he had been hitherto so largely honored he would resume his speech he said where he had stopped on the preceding day without taking up any of their Lordships time in preliminary matter He had left off with that part of the body of evidence which proved the abject state of vassalage in which the Nabob was held and by which it was in his opinion rendered manifest that every act of his particularly those strong acts in which he violated every obligation of a son were done not merely at the instigation but absolutely at the command of the prisoner It would not be difficult to prove that if he had been independent he certainly would not have committed those acts and this he should be able to demonstrate to their Lordships But first he begged leave to say that in the perpetration of those shameful and atrocious crimes which made the subject of the present charge there were three principal and three subordinate actors The three principal or rather the one great and leading principal with his two chief coadjutors were Mr Hastings Mr Middleton and Sir Elijah ImpeyThe three subordinate actors were Colonel Hannay Hyder Beg Cawn and Ali Abram Cawn Before he proceeded to shew that every  one of the acts were forcibly imposed on the Nabob he made some observations on part of the evidence of Sir Elijah Impey He had given as a reason for not having at any time after he took the affidavits conversed with Mr Hastings on the subject to which they alluded that he quitted Chunar the next day and that therefore he had not had an opportunity of seeing in order to converse with him on that or any subject Mr Sheridan shewed from letters written by Sir Elijah and Mr Hastings that they had quitted Chunar in company and had continued together for some time Sir Elijah had stated also that he had delivered the affidavits into the hands of Mr Hastings and knew nothing of them afterwards Mr Sheridan shewed that Major Davie had received the Persian affidavits from Sir Elijah to translate on the th of December although Sir Elijah had said that he gave them to Mr Hastings previous to his quitting Chunar which was on the st of December Mr Sheridan said he took notice of these facts just to shew the respect that was to be paid to the testimony of Sir Elijah  With regard to the affidavits as a body of evidence the whole was mere hearsay and rumour Captain Scott who by being in the country where the scene of the rebellion was said to lye had had a good opportunity of knowing the facts was not examined and the testimony of Hoolas Roy who of all others was the best informed on the subject was suppressed That his affidavit was taken was manifest and he called on the prisoner to say where this affidavit was concealed and why it was withheld Mr Sheridan said that in the celebrated letter written by Mr Hastings dated the th of December his own knowledge of the transactions was the most confused and contradictory that could be imagined He enumerated the various contradictions of that letterHe said that Mr Hastings had made a number of curious assertions in regard to the plunder of the treasures and resumption of the jaghiresThe proposition was first made to him that the treasures should be taken as an alternative  for the jaghires but in making that proposition it was said that they belonged of right to the NabobMr Hastings took it in the first sense as he called it that was he determined to seize on the treasures not as an alternative for the jaghires but to take them first because the proposition was made and to take the jaghires afterwards He was very anxious to have it believed that the proposition came from the Nabob although by the whole tenor of Mr Middleton's letters confidential as well as public it was demonstrated with what difficulty they were able to extort from him his consent to the violence Mr Sheridan adverted to the curious letter written by Mr Hastings to Mr Middleton and Mr Johnson saying that the treaty made by him with the Nabob at Chunar from its favourable tendency had given rise to suspicions that money had been taken to procure it and calling on them to exculpate themselves Upon which they with great formality declared on their honours and before God that they had neither received any bribe nor had an idea of any which declaration made with so much solemnity satisfied Mr Hastings arising a little perhaps from the consciousness that he had the money in his pocket Mr Sheridan proceeded to shew that so far from these acts being done at the instigation of the Nabob it was with the utmost difficulty that they could receive from him a formal sanction and on this subject several letters were read by Mr Adam and in particular he reconciled the letters written by Middleton on the st and th of December by saying that in regard to the seizure of the treasure of the Begums he only required a hint from Mr Hastings but as the resumption of the jaghires was likely to be a service of danger there nothing less than a public order would satisfy Mr Middleton After arguing this point with dexterity Mr Sheridan came to the extraordinary letters of Mr Middleton dated on the th of December wherein they are intended for the confidential and private use of Mr Hastings he denied the truth of what he had  said in his public dispatch which was to be submitted to the Council and saying at the same time that if Mr Hastings wished him to say any thing or to give any other colour to the proceedings he was ready to do it Mr Sheridan after placing this disgraceful subserviency in so glaring a point of view requested Mr Adam to read other letters necessary to illustrate this part of the charge and to shew the anxious pains and solicitude of Mr Hastings to establish something like an excuse for the turpitude of his conduct  ⁂While these letters were reading Mr Sheridan who was seized with a sudden though flight indisposition retired to the Managers room He was after some refreshment desirous of proceeding but his friends persuaded him to the contrary and Mr Fox came into the Court and said that Mr Sheridan being by his indisposition prevented from doing that justice to the charge which it was his wish to do the Managers requested that their Lordships would be pleased to adjourn and appoint another day on which he might proceed  Their Lordships accordingly withdrew and sent a message to the House of Commons that the Court will sit again on Friday the th  MR SHERIDAN'S SPEECH CONTINUED  FRIDAY JUNE THE th  MR SHERIDAN rose and being in a great measure recovered from the indisposition which prevented him from proceeding on Tuesday resumed his speech by thanking their Lordships for the indulgence they had shewn him and assured them that nothing but positive inability to proceed on Tuesday in a manner worthy of the importance and the dignity of his cause could have induced him to give them the trouble of sitting another day  He then reminded their Lordships that in commenting on the evidence respecting the resumption of the jaghires and the plunder of the Begums he had left off with the public and private correspondence between Mr Hastings and Mr Middleton This correspondence demanded the most minute attention for it contained all the facts of that foul and unmanly conspiracy it contained a true account of the cause of that conspiracy and also the quibbles the tricks the mean shifts and evasions by which it had been attempted to conceal it  On the public correspondence as contrasted with the private he animadverted with the most penetrating acuteness and exposed the gross contradictions the laboured fallacies and studied misrepresentations that pervaded the wholeTheir Lordships would naturally enquire with some  degree of surprise how the private letters that were thus to establish the guilt of their authors had come to lightIn the middle of December a coldness had taken place between Mr Hastings and Mr Middleton Mr Hastings had been hurt at the tardiness with which Middleton proceeded and had charged him with the heinous offence of permitting two days forbearance from the Nabob to his mother From this moment shyness and suspicion between the principal and the agent took place Mr Middleton hesitated about the expediency of the measure and began to doubt whether the advantage would be equal to the risk Mr Hastings whether he apprehended that Middleton was retarded by any return of humanity or sentiments of justice by any secret combination with the Begum and her son or a wish to take the lion's share of the plunder to himself was incensed at the delay Mr Middleton represented the unwillingness of the Nabob to put in execution the resumption of the jaghires the low state of his finances that his troops were mutinous for want of pay and that his life had been in danger from an insurrection among them That in this moment of distress he had offered one hundred thousand pounds in addition to a like sum paid before as an equivalent for the resumption which was demanded of him Of this offer however it appeared the Nabob knew nothing In conferring an obligation it was sometimes contrived from motives of delicacy that the name of the donor should be concealed from the person obliged but here was delicacy of a new sortthe person conferring the favour was to be kept ignorant that he had conferred it Yet after the return of Middleton in there was the same friendly collusion the same fraudulent familiarity between him and Mr Hastings that had existed before this difference took place He was brought down in December and no charge was brought against him till April following Then it was that Mr Hastings in a sudden fit of justice preferred the charge against him and threw down his letters on the  Counciltable Whatever was the meaning of this charge whether it was a juggle to elude enquiry or whether it was intended to make an impression at Fyzabad whether Mr Hastings drew up the charge and instructed Mr Middleton to draw up an easy defence or whether Middleton drew up the charge and Mr Hastings the defence there appeared in the whole transaction the same habitual collusion in which they livedand it ended in a rhapsody a repartee and a poetical quotation By this act of providential folly the private letters were produced and the production of them was conclusive proof of the conspiracy The private letters were the only part of the correspondence to be looked to They were written in the confidence of private communication without any of the motives to palliate and colour facts to confound and mislead the judgment which appeared on the very face of the public correspondence  Mr Sheridan then referred to a letter from Lucknow written under such particular circumstances and at such a particular period that had the alledged rebellion of the Begums ever existed but in imagination it must have been mentioned in that letter Where then was the proof of the rebellion Not where it ought naturally to be found but in the affidavits collected by Sir Elijah ImpeyIn the fabricated public correspondence between him Mr Hastings and Mr Middleton In that letter there was no mention of rebellion It was indeed said that if such measures were rigorously pursued as had been set on foot the people might be driven from murmur to resistance and rise up in arms against their oppressors Then indeed a little providential slaughter would substantiate the rebellion which they wished to find and afford a pretext for premeditated plunder But there was a clumsiness in the fraud a coarseness in the execution which defeated its purpose and exposed it to detection  He animadverted with much severity on the conduct of Sir Elijah Impey in collecting the affidavits At one moment  he appeared in Oude at another in Chunar at a third in Benares collecting affidavits The gravity of his business and the vivacity the rapidity the celerity of his movements made a singular contrast To him might have been applied the words of Hamlet to the ghost "What Truepenny are you there" Like the ghost he was heard in every quarter crying aloud  swear  But the similitude went no farther he was never heard to give the injunction  Taint not thy mind nor let thy soul contrive  Against thy mother ought  In the memorable private letter from Mr Middleton of the th of December in which he acknowledged the receipt of a private letter from Mr Hastings although no private letters from the prisoner had been produceda circumstance which could only be accounted for and arise from the habitual awe in which Middleton was kept by the domineering power and fascinating influence of his master In this letter Middleton told him that in the present fermented state of the country the resumption could not be accomplished but with infinite hazardAt the same time Mr Johnson wrote him to the same purpose The words of his letter were memorable He thought it would require a  campaign  to carry into execution the orders for the resumption of the Jaghires A campaign against whom Against the officers and army of their ally the Nabob who had given the order This resumption was stated to be for his good and for the good of his country and it was only to be accomplished by a campaign Such was the manner in which the English under the auspices of Mr Hastings protected their allies in India The protection of the English was the misery and ruin of the protected It was the protection of the vulture to the lamb which covers while it devours its preywhich stretching its baleful pinions and hovering in mid air disperses the kites and lesser birds of prey and saves the innocent and helpless victim from all talons but its own  It was curious to remark that in the correspondence of these creatures of Mr Hastings and in their earnest endeavours to dissuade him from the resumption of the Jaghires not a word is mentioned of the measure's being contrary to honour to faith derogatory to national character unmanly or unprincipledNo such thingThey knew the man to whom they were writing and their only arguments were that it was contrary to policy to expediencyand that the event was not likely to prosper in the only way in which it could be worth the attemptin the accumulation of money Not one word did they mention of the just claims which the Nabob had to the gratitude and friendship of the English Not one syllable of the treaty by which we were bound to protect himNot one syllable of the relation which subsisted between him and the ladies they were about to plunder Not one syllable was hinted about justice or mercynothing was ever addressed to him but the apprehension that the money to be procured would not be worth the danger and labour with which it must be attended Such was the source and origin of all his actions and it was that base and profligate motive that urging him to every species of meanness and of cruelty did give such a stamp and impression to his acts as made them unparalleled in ancient or modern history He would be bold to say that nothing could be found in the history of human turpitude nothing in the nervous delineations and penetrating brevity of Tacitus nothing in the luminous and luxuriant pages of Gibbon or of any other historian dead or living who searching into measures and characters with the rigour of truth presented to our abhorrence depravity in its blackest shapes could equal in the grossness of the guilt in the hardness of heart with which it was conducted or in the low and groveling motive the acts and character of Mr HastingsHe who in the base desire of stripping two helpless women could stir the son to rise up in vengeance against themwho when that son had certain touches of nature in his breastcertain feelings of  an awakened conscience to indicate that he was a manaccused that son of entertaining peevish objections to the plunder and sacrifice of his motherWho having destroyed in his bosom all thoughtall reflectionall memoryall conscienceall tenderness and duty as a sonall dignity as a monarchhaving destroyed his character and depopulated his country at length brought him to violate the dearest ties of nature and countenance the destruction of his parents and who having thus debauched this poor and miserable instrument of his crimes to his purpose deceived and ruined him in turn Hethis inhuman violator of all ties sacred and profane had in this single crime he would be bold to say no parallel nor prototype in the old world or the new from the day of original sin to the present hour  And yet when in this climax he thought he had got to the summit and pinnacle of his guilt he found something still more transcendently flagitious He particularly alluded to his famous letter falsely dated the th of February in which at the very moment that he had given the order for the entire destruction of the Begums and for the resumption of the jaghires expressed to the Nabob the warm and lively interest which he took in his welfarethe sincerity and ardour of his friendshipand that though his presence was imminently wanted at Calcutta he could not rest a moment without coming to the Nabob's assistance and in the mean time he had sent four regiments to his aidSo deliberate and coolso hypocritical and insinuating was the villainy of this man The heart was exasperated by the malignity of this arch treasonBut at length the Nabob was on his guard He could not be deceived by this maskThe offer of the four regiments developed the object of Mr HastingsHe perceived the dagger bunglingly concealed in the hand that was held out with a smile to meet himand we accordingly heard no more from the Nabob of reliance on the friendship of Mr HastingsThis letter was sent at the very time when the troops had surrounded the walls of Fyzabad and now  began the scene of horrors which if he merely wished to rouse their Lordships feelings he should only have occasion minutely to describe To state the violence committed on that palace which the piety of the kingdom had raised for the retreat and seclusion of the objects of its pride and veneration He thought he saw innocence reposing in those shades rendered sacred by superstitionVenerable age and helpless infancy here found an asylum and to the violation of this scene were sent an Impey to invigorate the flagging conscience of a Middletonand an Ali Khan assisted by the stouter villainy of a Hyder Beg Rapine outrage and violence followed in the train while Hastings though standing aloof was in fact the master general of the war and through the whole of the dreadful scene of horror their Lordships saw him"ride in the whirlwind and direct the storm"  He now with an admirable accuracy and force of reasoning went over the correspondence which then passed between Middleton and the Begums he particularly alluded to the letter sent by the Begum to Middleton with his answer in which he declared himself equally the friend of the Nabob and the Begum although he had previously sworn in the presence of God that he thought she had hostile designs against her son and the English and had made up his conscience to strip her of every thing she possessed He execrated the shameless sycophancy of this conduct that like some of the monsters of India cringed to its prey and fawned on the objects of its vengeance In going over these private letters he came to that from Mr Middleton which the Council for the prisoner had been anxious to have read to the end in order to publish an anecdote which they thought would do something towards supporting the character of Mr Middleton It contained some expressions of earnest and anxious solicitude for the recovery of a beloved sonand which they meant to insinuate were indications of feeling and of his sense of the nature of the relative duty and affection which subsisted between the parent and the child How fortunate they had  been in their desire of having this anecdote heard he knew notHe confessed he thought it did not tend to raise the character of Mr Middletonbut on the contrary it operated very much to his prejudice It would not be imputed to him that speaking abstractedly he considered the trait of parental tenderness as a degrading feature in the human heart Their Lordships knew well the force of the soft and endearing relation which subsisted between parent and child but surely it would not be said that the circumstance brought to their Lordships view by the Counsel of the fact of Mr Middleton's having this sentiment and feeling in his bosom was therefore intitled to commendation when with the feeling in his own bosom he was outraging it in others Was it not an aggravation of his guilt that he who felt the ardent solicitude of a parent and who consequently must be sensible of the reciprocal feelings of a child could bring himself to tear asunder and to violate all those dear and sacred bonds Did it not enhance his guilt that his cruelty was not the result of ideotic ignorance or of savage barbarityThat he whose soul was thus sensible to the impressions of tenderness and love should be so abandoned as to sacrifice those feelings to the inhuman will of the tyrant whom he served He averred that it increased and magnified his guilt He would have been less criminal had he been insensible of tendernessless criminal if he had not been so thoroughly acquainted with the true quality of parental love and filial duty Here Mr Sheridan gave a picture of filial duty which as a piece of chaste and beautiful painting in language we know not where to equal and which we are utterly unable to copy  Filial duty he said it was impossible by words to describe but description by words was unnecessary It was that duty which they all felt and understood and which required not the powers of language to explain It was in truth more properly to be called a principle than a duty It required not the aid of memoryit needed not the exercise of the understanding it awaited not the slow deliberations of reasoning  It flowed spontaneously from the fountain of our feelings It was involuntary in our naturesIt was a quality of our being innate and coeval with life which though afterwards cherished as a passion was independent of our mental powersIt was earlier than all intelligence in our souls It displayed itself in the earliest impulses of the heart and was an emotion of fondness that returned in smiles of gratitude the affectionate solicitudethe tender anxietiesthe endearing attentions experienced before memory began but which were not less dear for not being rememberedIt was the sacrament of nature in our hearts by which the union of parent and child was sealed and rendered perfect in the community of love and which strengthening and ripening with life acquired vigour from the understanding and was most lively and active when most wantedwhen those who had supported infancy were sinking into age and when infirmity and decrepitude found their best solace in the affections of the children they had rearedBut he was ashamed to take up so much of their Lordships time in attempting to give a cold picture of filial duty when he saw so many breathing testimonies in the assembly that surrounded him and when he saw every feature of that assembly beaming and erecting itself in confession of the universal principle  The manner of disposing of the goods violently seized from the unfortunate Princesses their jewels their wearing apparel their furniture even to their table utensils though in significant objects when compared with other circumstances of their unhappy situation was marked with injustice and oppression They were sold or at least put up to sale by auction a pretended sale where there were no bidders who had not previously agreed on what they should purchase and how much they should pay for dividing the spoil This the Begum herself lamented in very affecting terms in a representation to Mr Middleton when she says that she finds from woeful experience that even bullion gold and jewels lose their value the moment it is known they come from her  But the rapacity of Middleton did not stop there for after having thus fraudulently disposed of the goods a new claim was made for the deficiency and new cruelties were perpetrated to enforce the payment of a sum which did not constitute a part of the original fine Attempts were made to find out new crimes and new debts due by the Nabob to the Company though he had already offended to the amount of l Mr Hastings writes to Mr Middleton not to come to a final settlement with the Nabob till he should consult his CASHBOOK which was the faithful record of the crimes of their allies and in which he had already discovered l worth of treason that no person had ever before dreamed of He accuses by the  Multiplication Table  tries by the  Rule of Three  and condemns not by the sublime institute of Timur or the simple maxims of English jurisprudence but by the unerring rules of  Cocker's Arithmetic  He then proceeded to animadvert on the testimony of Major Scott whom he called the incomparable agent of Mr Hastings He had come to the bar and said that though the Defence of Mr Hastings had not been drawn up by himself yet there was one paragraph which he Mr Hastings had written with his own  proper  hand That paragraph was avowing the resumption of the Jaghires and averring it to be consistent with the dictates of humanity policy and justice "Give me the pen said Mr Hastings "I will defend the measure as just and necessary Do you find  memory  I will find  character  " And thus the  twin warriors  came into the field each in his proper sphere of action and armed for either purpose Such had been the daring and unblushing defence of Mr Hastings for the commission of an act on which their Lordships could have but one opinion That it was not consistent with the dictates of justice he appealed to those whose peculiar province it was to administer justice Those of your Lordships said be who have been distinguished as Statesmen will spurn at the idea of its being a measure that can be justified on the  principles of good policy and that it is not to be defended by the laws of humanity he would appeal to that venerable part of the august tribunal who heard himthey who had ever proved themselves the distinguished advocates of religion and truth  He now came to the recital of the cruelties perpetrated by the agents of Mr Hastings which he pledged himself to bring home to the bold culprit at the bar The first act of their tyranny was the imprisonment of the Ministers of the Begums who were persons of considerable eminence and distinction in that country and who had enjoyed much of the confidence and favour of the late Nabob Not satisfied with this they were loaded with irons and suffered the combined horrors of want imprisonment and ignominy but what aggravated the scandalous injustice of this measure was that they had suffered without even the formality of an enquiry while that  arch traitor  Shumshaw Cawn though accused of disaffection to the English Government was suffered to go about without notice he had been so much neglected by those in power that he had not even been complimented with  fetters  the usual badge of distinction which it was the practice to bestow on opulent traitorsTo his poverty he owed his protectionThe unfortunate Ministers of the Begums not having yet satisfied the rapacity of these plunderers were ordered to Chunar where the English flag was flying as the signal of oppression there to have corporal punishment inflicted on them and one of them actually suffered it to the disgrace of the honour the justice and humanity of the British nation What must have been the feelings of the British officers upon that occasion he must leave those to say who were present To Major Gilpin he gave much praise not only for the candid evidence he gave at the bar but for his humane endeavour to alleviate the sufferings of the unhappy women for they were the next objects of Mr Middleton's  humanity  The conduct of Mr Johnson was of a different kind though he certainly had  some claim to praise from his  forbearance  he very  humanely  writes to Middleton that he did not think it would be  worth while  to put to death women and children for the purpose of enforcing prompt payment of their demands but actuated by the fear of the dreadful responsibility under which Mr Hastings had placed all his agents they proceeded to carry his orders into execution and took possession of the Palace The sufferings of the women were pathetically described by Major Gilpin In a letter dated the th October he writes as follows  Last night about eight o'clock the women in the Khord Mohul Lesser Palace or Zenana womens apartment under the charge of Latafut Ally Khan assembled on the tops of the buildings crying in a most lamentable manner for food that for the last four days they had got but a very scanty allowance and that yesterday they had got none The melancholy cries of famine are more easily imagined than described  After such a description of calamity he said he would not trespass on the feelings of their Lordships by any comments on it Their indignation against the author of those calamities rendered any further observations on that subject unnecessary It was now for him to prove that Mr Hastings was responsible for the actions of his agents That he was responsible for the Treaty of Chunar he believed would scarcely be disputedthough Mr Middleton had on the last day of his examination refused to answer some questions on that subject lest it might criminate himself With an avarice for infamy and an anxious desire of monopolizing guilt Mr Middleton when questioned about his conduct at Fyzabad had answered that he alone was to blame for Mr Hastings had written an angry letter to him disapproving of what he had done but what said he will be your Lordships astonishment when you are told that this letter from Mr Hastings contained a gentle reproach to Mr Middleton not for his want of humanity but for his lenity Such was his anxiety to court infamy  and to solicit guilt that he scrupled not to encounter ignominy when he might have claimed praise  Mr Hastings had urged in his defence that as he was not privy to the actions he could not be responsible for the guilt This was not true Mr Hastings well knew what was going forward though perhaps he might be unacquainted with the miserable detail When a person in authority desires another to do an illegal act he certainly is to all intents and purposes answerable for the consequences He becomes the principal in the crime though he might not be the actual perpetrator of it and is considered by every principle of natural law and natural reason as the first object of punishment What were the orders given by Mr Hastings They were peremptoryand it is proved by Middleton himself that he could not have carried them into execution by any other means than those which had been adopted Would any man then be hardy enough to assert that Mr Hastings was not in this instance answerable for the act of his agent The communications of Mr Hastings and Mr Middleton had been frequent and uninterrupted though he must say they were more like the secret machinations of a banditti in a cavern plotting the destruction of some innocent family than the deliberations of British Representatives in India  Mr Middleton however had at least some regard to decorum on particular occasions for in answer to Mr Hastings's letter accusing him of lenity and forbearance in the execution of his orders he answers "That the Nabob was  son  to the Begum whom we were to proceed against a  son  against his  mother  must at least save  appearances  in his mode of proceeding" But Mr Hastings all along pretends complete ignorance of the cruelties that were perpetrated that is he was ignorant of the exact number of lashes which were inflected and the precise weight of the iron which formed the fettersSuch was the miserable sophistry by which he defended himself though his guilt  was the same as if he had with his own hand inflicted the punishment  He then took notice of that part of Mr Hastings's defence the object of which was to criminate the rest of the Board or at least to prove that they were equally guilty with him Had Sir John Macpherson then of whose character he thought highly no friend that would call him to the bar to vindicate himself from so foul an aspersion Was there nobody to do justice to the memory of Mr Wheeler For his own part he was ready to acquit the Members of the Board from any share in the guilt of the black catalogue of Mr Hastings's crimes though their agreeing to sign the dispatch to the Court of Directors not one paragraph of which was true was a very inexcusable and even a criminal credulity After commenting with great ingenuity and force of reasoning on the different paragraphs of the letter to the Court of Directors with a view to prove that the whole was a fabrication calculated solely to promote the views of Mr Hastings he said he was convinced that Sir John Macpherson was now ashamed of his credulity and would be glad of an opportunity of vindicating himself from the imputed guilt of which Mr Hastings had been anxious to give to the Board more than fell to their share  The tyranny of Mr Hastings he said was not to be reconciled to the common rules nor could it be judged of by the common standard of tyrants The atrocious cruelties of a Nero and a Caligula might be ascribed to the impetuosity of passions inflamed to madness which knew no check and which felt no correction In their delirious career they suffered no reflection to intervene and they knew of no responsibility they had no interval of remorse no feeling of equalitythey were born to rule and they considered their subjects as creatures over whom they had a right to domineer That such men with turbulent headstrong passions should be tyrants was not so wonderful as it was melancholy But how different was the case of Mr Hastings He was a coolthinking  deliberate tyrant Born to no ruleentitled to no superiorityaccustomed to converse to act and to live with his equalsbred in mercantile habits which forced him to estimate on every measureand entrusted by a mercantile Company with a government which was to be carried on by mercantile principlesBound to give a faithful account of every transactionand to expose not only the measure itself but the motives that led to itWho could never go to bed without discharging this dutywithout balancing the transactions of the dayand reconciling his acts to justice and policyWho held up as it were a glass rightly to his own conscience and was bound to purge it That such a man should become a tyrant militated against every rational principle of manYet here we saw the monstera philosophical tyranta cool deliberate reasoning tyrantwho violated the rights of man with a perfect consciousness of what those rights wereand who endowed with the knowledge of the equal rank as to freedom granted by the Deity to human kind arraigned the wisdom of Providence by opposing its dispensations in favour of his species A tyrant against man was a libeller of Godand the Court beheld in the prisoner a creature who had presumed to deface and disorder the beauty and harmony of that system which was originally granted by Heaven for the happiness of the earth  Mr Sheridan now drew to his conclusion He said their Lordships would not be surprized if after all that they had heard he should think the cause for which he stood up perfectly safe if he called on them to discharge from their minds all that they had heard of mere language and only to attend to facts A strict examination of the evidence would so fully and thoroughly convince them of the turpitude of the prisoner that he wished to place the whole cause on that single ground unornamented by eloquence and unassisted by reasoning One only passage more he should take notice ofMr Hastings in the moment when he  stifled the pretended enquiry into the atrocious acts committed under his own authority entered a minute of the most remarkable kind  If we cannot heal let us not inflame the wounds which have been inflicted If the Begums think themselves aggrieved to such a degree as to justify them in an appeal to a foreign jurisdiction  speaking of wounds inflicted by his own positive ordersand talking of a foreign jurisdiction as if Sir Elijah Impey's Court at Lucknow had not been a foreign jurisdiction  let us at least permit them to be the judges of their own feelings and prefer their complaints before we offer to redress them  But now came the magnificent paragraph to which he requested their Lordships attention  I hope I shall not depart from the simplicity of official language in saying the majesty of Justice ought to be approached with solicitation not descend to provoke or invite it much less to debase itself by the suggestion of wrongs and the promise of redress with the denunciation of punishments before trial and even before accusation  This strutting and pompous apology for not listening to the voice of real justice and mercy he was very much surprised to find had met the approbation of Sir John Macpherson of whose good sense and understanding he had heard a good report but who by the minute which he added proved that he had not studied and corrected his taste for the sublime and beautiful from the immortal leader of this prosecution If he dad done so he would have felt and treated this passage as it deservedas a piece of bombastic jargon unworthy of the sober approbation of the understanding The Majesty of Justice in the eyes of Mr Hastings was a being of terrific horrora dreadful idol placed in the gloom of graves accessible only to cringing supplication and which must be approached with offerings and worshipped by sacrifice The majesty of Mr Hastings was a being whose decrees were written with blood and whose oracles were at once obscure and terrible From such an idol exclaims  Mr Sheridan I turn my eyes with horrorI turn them here to this dignified and high tribunal where the Majesty of Justice really sits enthronedHere I perceive the Majesty of Justice in her proper robes of truth and mercychaste and simpleaccessible and patientawful without severityinquisitive without meannessI see her enthroned and sitting in judgment on a great and momentous cause in which the happiness of millions is involved Pardon me my Lords if I presume to say that in the decision of this great cause you are to be envied as well as venerated You possess the highest distinction of the human character for when you render your ultimate voice on this cause illustrating the dignity of the ancestors from whom you springjustifying the solemn asseveration which you makevindicating the people of whom you are a partand manifesting the intelligence of the times in which you live you will do such an act of mercy and blessing to man as no men but yourselves are able to grant  My Lords I have done  FINIS
