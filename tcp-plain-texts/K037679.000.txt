mores facta haec fabula est  Qui pudicitiae esse voltis praemium plausum date  PLAUTUS  LONDON PRINTED FOR J DEBRETT OPPOSITE BURLINGTONHOUSE PICCADILLY MDCCLXXXVI  TO THE EARL OF DERBY  MY DEAR LORD  OUR connection and friendship as well as the partiality I know you will entertain in favour of any attempt at regulated Drama mark you as the person to whom with the most propriety and inclination I can inscribe the Comedy of the Heiress  It also comes to your Lordship's hand with a secondary claim to your acceptance as owing its existence to the leisure and tranquility I enjoyed during the two last summers at Knowsley  I long intended as your Lordship can witness to keep the name of the author concealed After the success with which the Play has been honoured I must expect that the change of my design will be imputed by many to vanity I shall submit without murmuring to that belief if I may obtain equal credit for the sincerity of another pride  which this discovery gratifiesthat of testifying in the most public manner the respect and affection with which I have the honour to be  My dear Lord  Your most obedient And most humble servant J BURGOYNE  H  rtford street  Feb    st    PREFACE  THE approbation the following Comedy has received upon the Stage and the candour with which every criticism that has come to the Author's knowledge has been accompanied might encourage him to trust it to the closet without any other preface than an acknowledgement of his gratitude to the Public for the honours done to him And if he detains the reader a few moments more it is not to disavow what has been hinted at in some of the daily prints as a species of plagiarism but to plead it in behalf of dramatic writing in generalâ–ª against rules that if carried to the extent they lead to would fix shackles upon genius and give a very undue limitation to variety  In point of fable for instance  Is it a reproach to borrow  Surely the dramatist like the architect brings his talents equally to the test whether he builds upon another man's ground or his own And if instead of small and detached parts the writer of the Heiress had taken the compleat plot of his play from a novel he would have imitated the examples the only imitation to which he has any pretence of the best dramatic Poets of every age  In point of originality of characters  It is humbly hoped this Comedy is not without it But present instances apart it is submitted to the judicious whether such an exaction of novelty as would make a resemblance to any thing ever seen upon the stage before unacceptable might not materially vitiate the public taste carry the major part of writers beyond the scope of nature  and probability and deprive the spectator of that pleasing and infinite diversity of shape and colouring that the leading passions vices and follies of civilised life admit Love avarice misanthropy c c if drawn a thousand and a thousand times with new shades and in different points of view will do as much credit to invention and have as just an effect in exhibition as if Moliere or Congrave had never touched the subjects It is not whether there may not be personages in the Heiress in whom we may discover family features that is asked but whether they are not still individuals with whom we have been hitherto unacquainted i  a question not for the Author to determine  Original thought  It has been observed that there is an image in a speech of Lord Gayville copied closely from Rousseau Very possibly it may be so The Author of the Heiress certainly has read that elegant writer and to shew how easily invention may be deceived he will quote another writer in his estimation still more elegant who thus accounts and apologizes for unconscious plagiarism  "Faded ideas" says Mr Sheridan "Float in the fancy like half forgotten dreams and imagination in its fullest enjoyments becomes suspicious of its offspring and doubts whether it has created or adopted"  More sentiments and expression due to the imagination of others may possibly be challenged though they are equally out of the recollection of the AuthorHe would only wish the candid to admit the probability that while he believed them his own he thought them his best  Many of the scenes now submitted to perusal have been shortened in representation and a few  words have been altered occasionally to preserve connectiona circumstance necessary to be known lest the performers should be suspected of negligence when on the contrary too much cannot be said of their attention and zeal When all have been eminent it would be unnecessary if not invidious to particularize any There is nevertheless a Lady to whom by her standing separately and individually in one part of the performance the Author without departing from his maxim may express his more than ordinary obligation Miss Farren by her inimitable manner of delivering the Epilogue has made a better apology to the public than any his pen could have produced for a composition which from an accident was much too hastily written in some parts and in others pieced together with a like insufficiency of time  The Epilogue excepted no defects in the following sheets can be covered by the excuse of hurry They cannot be so consistently with truth nor indeed with inclination For the Author had rather be thought incapable of pleasing after his greatest cares than wanting in the attention and respect which every man who ventures to publish a production of this nature owes to the world and to himselfNot to let it pass from his hands without frequent revisal and the best considered finish his abilities can give  PROLOGUE By the Rt Hon RICHARD FITZPATRICK Spoken by Mr KING  AS sprightly sunbeams gild the face of day  When low'ring tempests calmly glide away  So when the Poet's dark horizon clears  Array'd in smiles the Epilogue appears  She of that house the lively emblem still  Whose brilliant speakers start what themes they will  Still varying topicks for her sportive rhymes  From all the follies of these  fruitful  times  Uncheck'd by forms with flippant hand may cull  Prologues  like Peers  by privilege are dull  In solemn strain address th' assembled Pit  The legal judges of dramatic wit  Confining still with dignified decorum  Their observationsto the Play before 'em  Now when each batchelor a helpmate lacks  That sweet exemption from a double Tax  When laws are fram'd with a benignant plan  Of light'ning  burdens  on the married man  And Hymen adds one solid comfort more  To all those  comforts  he conferr'd before  To smooth the rough laborious road to fame  Our bard has chosenan  alluring name  As wealth in wedlock oft is known to hide  The imperfections of a homely bride  This tempting title he perhaps expects  May heighten beautiesand conceal defects  Thus sixty's wrinkles view'd thro' fortune's glass  The rosy dimples of sixteen surpass  The modern suitor grasps his fair one's hand  O'erlooks her person and adores  her land    Leers  on her houses with an  ogling eye  O'er her rich acres heaves an  am'rous  sigh  His  heartfelt  pangs thro' groves of  timber  vents  And runs distracted for  her three per cents  Will thus the Poet's mimic Heiress find  The bridegroom critic to  her  failings blind  Who claims alas his nicer taste to hit  The Lady's portion paid in  sterling  wit  On your decrees to fix her future fate  Depends our Heiress for her whole estate  Rich in your smiles she charms th' admiring town  A very  bankrupt  should your chance to frown  O may a verdict giv'n in your applause  Pronounce the prosp'rous issue of her cause  Confirm the name an anxious parent gave her  And prove her Heiress ofthe Public Favour  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  Sir Clement Flint  Mr KING  Clifford

Letitia Blandish discovered writing letters folded up and message cards scattered upon the table  Mrs Blandish  Leans upon her elbows as meditating Writes as pleased with her thought lays down the pen  THERE it is compleat  reads conceitedly  "Adieu my charming friend my amiable my all  Accomplished sociate conceive the ardor of  Your lover's united with your own sensibility  Still will the compound be but faintly expressive  Of the truth and tenderness of your  "LETITIA BLANDISH"  There's phraseThere's a period Match it if you can  Blandish  Not I indeed I am working upon a quite different plan but you are as welcome to my cast off style as you shou'd be to my old embroidery Pick out the gold if it be of any use  Mrs Blandish  Cast off style Excellent assurance And pray Sir to whom are you indebted for the very elements of wheedling and all that has attended it's progress from the plaything in your nursery to the brilliant upon your finger  Blandish  For the elements my honour'd sister and partner I confess the obligation but for the proficiency I have attain'd the sublime of the science while you with more experience are still a novice like a Miss at her stuttering harpsicord with a nimble finger but no earYou keep in tune 'tis true for that is the merit of the instrument but you are continually out of time and allways thrumming the same key  Mrs Blandish  Which in plain English is as much as to say  Blandish  That human vanity is an instrument of such ease and compass the most unskilful can play something upon it but to touch it to the true purpose  Mrs Blandish  Well Sir and look round you pray these apartments were not furnished from the interest of two miserable thousand pounds in the three per cents any more than our table and equipage have been maintained by  your  patrimonyA land estate of three hundred a year out of repair and mortgaged for nearly it's value I believe I have stated our original family circumstances pretty accurately  Blandish  They wanted improvement it must be acknowledg'd But before we bring our industry  to a comparison in the name of the old father of flattery to whom is that perfect phrase address'd  Mrs Blandish  To one worth the pains I can tell youMiss Alscrip  Blandish  What sensibility to Miss Alscrip my dear sister this is too much even in your own way had you run changes upon her fortune stocks bonds and mortgages upon Lord Gayville's coronet at her feet or forty other coronets to make footballs of if she pleasedit would have been plausible but the quality you have selected  Mrs Blandish  Is one she has no pretensions to therefore the flattery is more persuasivethat's my maxim  Blandish  And mine also but I don't try it quite so highSensibility to Miss Alscrip you might as well have applied it to her Uncle's Pigiron from which she derives her first fifty thousand or the harder heart of the old Usurer her Father from whom she expects the second But come  rings  to the business of the morning  Enter Prompt  the Valet de Chambre  Here Promptsend out the chairmen with the billets and cards Have you any orders madam  Mrs Blandish  delivering her letter  This to Miss Alscrip with my impatient enquiries after her last night's rest and that she shall have my personal statute in half an hourYou take care to send to all the lyingin ladies  Prompt  At their doors Madam before the first load of straw  Blandish  And to all great men that keep the house Whether for their own disorders or those of the nation  Prompt  To all Sirtheir secretaries and principal clerks  Blandish  aside to Prompt  How goes on the business you have undertaken for Lord Gayville  Prompt  I have convey'd his letter and expect this morning to get an answer  Blandish  He does not think me in the secret  Prompt  Mercy forbid you should be  archly  Blandish  I should never forgive your medling  Prompt  Oh never never  Blandish  aloud  Well dispatch  Mrs Blandish  Holdapropos to the lying in list at Mrs Barbara Winterbloom's to enquire after the Angola kittens and the last hatch of Java sparrows  Prompt  Reading his memorandum as he goes out  Ladies in the strawMinisters cOld Maids Cats and Sparrows never had a better list of how d'ye's since I had the honour to collect for the Blandish family  Exit  Mrs Blandish  These are the attentions that establish valuable friendships in female life By adapting myself to the whims of one submitting to the jest of another assisting the little plots of a third and taking part against the husbands with all I am become an absolute essential in the polite world the very foul of every fashionable party in town or country  Blandish  The country Pshaw Time thrown away  Mrs Blandish  Time thrown away As if women of fashion left London to turn freckled shepherdesses  No no cards cards and backgammon are the delights of rural life and slightly as you may think of my skill at the year's end I am no inconsiderable sharer in the pinmoney of my society  Blandish  A paltry resource Gambling is a damn'd trade and I have done with it  Mrs Blandish  Indeed  Blandish  Yes 'twas high timeThe women don't pay And as for the men the age grows circumspect in proportion to it's poverty It's odds but one loses a character to establish a debt and must fight a duel to obtain the payment I have a thousand better plans but two principal ones And I am only at a loss which to chuse  Mrs Blandish  Out with them I beseech you  Blandish  Whether I shall marry my friend's intended bride or his sister  Mrs Blandish  Marry his intended bride What pigiron and usury Your opinion of her must advance your addresses admirably  Blandish  My Lord's opinion of her will advance them he can't bear the sight of her and defiance of his uncle Sir Clement Flint's eagerness for the match is running mad after an adventure which I who am his confidant shall keep going till I determineThere's news for you  Mrs Blandish  And his sister Lady Emily the alternative The first match in England in beauty wit and accomplishment  Blandish  Pooh A fig for her personal charms she will bring me connexion that wou'd soon supply fortune the other wou'd bring fortune enough to make connexion unnecessary  Mrs Blandish  And as to the certainty of success with the one or the other  Blandish  SuccessAre they not women Why even you can cajole themWhat then must I do who have advantage of sex and am equally ready to adore every feature of the face or to fall incorporeally in love with the mindBut no more of theory I must away to practiseAnd first for Gayville and his fellow student Clifford who is come home with a wise face and a conceited confidence in his old ascendancy over his Lordship but thanks to the accident that kept him two months behind Mr Monitor will find himself mistaken  Mrs Blandish  Beware of the Monitor notwithstanding in another quarter Lady Emily and he were acquainted at the age of first impressions  Blandish  I dare say he always meant to be the compleat friend of the family tho' without a single talent for the purpose I question whether he ever made a compliment in his life  Mrs Blandish  Oh the brute  Blandish  His game I find has been to work upon Lord Gayville's understanding he thinks he must finally establish himself in his esteem by inexorably opposing all his folliesPoor simpletonNow my touch of opposition goes only to inhance the value of my acquiescence So adieu for the morningYou to Miss Alscrip with an unction of flattery fit for a house painter's brush I to Sir Clement and his family with a composition as delicate as aether and to be applied with the point of a feather  Going  Mrs Blandish  Hark you Blandish a good wish before you go To make your success compleat may you find but half your own vanity in those you have to work on  Blandish  Thank you my dear Letty this is not the only  tap  you have hit me today and you are right for if you and I did not sometimes speak truth to each other we should forget there was such a quality incident to the human mind  Exeunt  SCENE II  Lord Gayville's Apartment  Enter Lord Gayville and Mr Clifford  Lord Gayville  My dear Clifford urge me no more How can a man of your liberality of sentiment descend to be the advocate of my uncle's family avarice  Clifford  My lord you do not live for yourself You have an ancient name and title to support  Lord Gayville  Preposterous policy Whenever the father builds games or electioneers the heir and title must go to market Oh the happy families Sir Clement Flint will enumerate where this practice has prevail'd for centuries and the estate been improved in every generation tho' specifically spent by each individual  Clifford  But you thought with him a month ago and wrote with transport of the match  "Whenever you think of Miss Alscrip visions of equipage and splendor villas and hotels the delights of independance and profuseness dance in your imagination"  Lord Gayville  It is true I was that dissipated fashionable wretch  Clifford  Come this reserve betrays a consciousness of having acted wrong You wou'd not hide what wou'd give me pleasure But I'll not be officious  Lord Gayville  Hear me without severity and I'll tell you all Such a woman such an assemblage of all that's lovely in the sex  Clifford  Well butthe who the how the where  Lord Gayville  I met her walking and alone and indeed so humbly circumstanced as to carry a parcel in her own hand  Clifford  I cannot but smile at this opening of your adventurehow many such charmers have we met in our former excursions from Cambridge I warrant she had a smart hat and a drawn up petticoat like a curtain in festoons to discover a new buckle and a neat ancle  Lord Gayville  No Clifford her dress was such as a judicious painter wou'd chuse to characterize modesty But natural grace and elegance stole upon the observation and through the simplicity of a Quaker shew'd all we cou'd conceive of a Goddess I gazed and turn'd idolater  Clifford  Smiling  You may as well finish the description in poetry at once you are on the very verge of it  Lord Gayville  She was under the persecution of one of those beings peculiar to this town who assume the name of gentlemen upon the sole credentials of a boot a switch and round hatThe  things  that escape from counters and writing desks to disturb public places insult foreigners and put decent women out of countenance I had no difficulty in the rescue  Clifford  And having silenced the dragon in the true spirit of chivalry you conducted the damsel to her castle  Lord Gayville  The utmost I could obtain was leave to put her into a hackney coach which I followed unperceived and lodged her in the house of an obscure milliner in a bye street  Clifford  The sweet Cyprian retreat Such a priestess of your goddess I dare say did not refuse access to the shrine  Lord Gayville  It is true a few guineas made the milliner my own I almost liv'd in the house and often when I was not suspected to be there passed whole hours list'ning to a voice that wou'd have captivated my very soul tho' it had been her only attraction At last  Clifford  What is to follow  Lord Gayville  By the persuasions of the woman who laugh'd at my scruples with an unknown girl a lodger upon a second floor I hid myself in the closet of her apartment And the practiced trader assured me I had nothing to fear from the interruption of the family  Clifford  Oh for shame my Lord whatever may be the end of your adventure such means were very much below you  Lord Gayville  I confess it and have been punish'd Upon the discovery of me fear indignation and resolution agitated the whole frame of the sweet girl by turnsI would sooner have committed sacrilege than have offered an affront to her personConfusedoverpower'dI stammer'd out a few incoherent wordsInterest in her fortunerespectentreaty of forgivenessand left her to detest me  Clifford  You need go no farther I meant to rally you but your proceedings and emotion alarm me for your peace and honour If this girl is an adventurer which I suspect you are  making yourself ridiculousIf she is strictly innocent upon what ground dare a man of your principle think farther of her you are on a double precipice on one side impell'd by folly on the other  Lord Gayville  Hold Clifford I am not prepar'd for so much admonition Your tone is changed since our separation you seem to drop the Companion and assume the Governor  Clifford  No my Lord I scorn the Sycophant and assert the Friend  Enter servant follow'd by Blandish  Servant  My Lord Mr Blandish  Exit  Clifford  significantly  I hope every man will do the same  Blandish  Mr Clifford do not let me drive you awayI want to learn  your  power to gain and to preserve dear Lord Gayville's esteem  Clifford  with a seeming effort to withdraw his hand which Blandish holds  Sir you are quite accomplish'd to be an example  Blandish  I have been at your apartment to look for youwe have been talking of you with Sir ClementLady Emily threw in her word  Clifford  disengaging his hand  Oh Sir you make me too proud  aside  Practised Parasite  Exit  Blandish  aside  Sneering Puppy  to Lord Gayville  My Lord you seem disconcerted has any thing new occur'd  Lord Gayville  No for their is nothing new in being disappointed in a friend  Blandish  Have you told your story to Mr Clifford  Lord Gayville  I have and I might as well have told it to the Cynic my Uncle he cou'd not have discourag'd or condemn'd me more  Blandish  They are both in the right I see things exactly as they dobut I have less fortitude or more attachment than othersThe inclinations of the man I love are spells upon my opposition  Lord Gayville  Kind Blandish you are the confidant I want  Blandish  What has happen'd since your discovery in the closet  Lord Gayville  The lovely wanderer left her lodgings the next morningbut I have again found hershe is in a house of equal retirement but of very different character in the city and inaccessable I have wrote to her and knowing her to be distress'd I have enclos'd Bank Bills for two hundred pounds the acceptance of which I have urged with all the delicacy I am master of and by heaven without a purpose of corruption  Blandish  Two hundred pounds and Lord Gayville's name  Lord Gayville  She has never known me but by the name of Mr Heartly Since my ambition has been to be loved for my own sake I have been jealous of my title  Blandish  And prithee by what diligence or chance did Mr Heartly trace his fugitive  Lord Gayville  By the acuteness of Mr Prompt your Valet de Chambre You must pardon me for pressing into my service for this occasion the fellow in the world fittest for it  Blandish  You know I am incapable of being angry with youbut that dog to practice upon my weakness and engage without my consent  Lord Gayville  The blame is all mine He is now waiting an answer to my letterhow my heart palpitates at the delay  Enter Prompt  Prompt  Starts at seeing his master  Are you alone my Lord  Lord Gayville  Don't be afraid Promptyour peace is made  Prompt  Then there is my return for your Lordship's goodness  Giving the letter  This letter was just now brought to the place appointed by a porter  Lord Gayville  By a Cupid honest Prompt and these characters were engraved by the point of his arrow  kissing the superscription  "To Heartly Esq" Blandish did you ever see any thing like it  Blandish  If her style be equal to her handwriting  Lord Gayville  If it be equalInfidel you shall have proof directly  opens the letter precipitaely  Hey day what the Devil's here my bills again and no linenot a wordDeath and disappointment what's this  Prompt  Gad it's well if she is not off again faith I never ask'd where the letter came from  Lord Gayville  Should you know the messenger again  Prompt  I believe I should my Lord For a Cupid he was somewhat in years about six feet high and a nose rather given to purple  Lord Gayville  Spare your wit Sir till you find him  Prompt  I have a shorter waymy life upon it I start her myself  Blandish  And what is your device sirrah  Prompt  Lord Sir nothing so easy as to bring  every living creature in this town to the window a tame bear or a mad ox two men or two dogs fighting a balloon in the airor tied up to the ceiling 'tis the same thing make but noise enough and out they come first and second childhood and every thing betweenI am sure I shall know her by inspiration  Lord Gayville  Shall I describe her to you  Prompt  No my lord time is too precious I'll be at her last lodgings and afterwards half the town over before before your Lordship will travel from her forehead to her chin  Lord Gayville  Away then my good fellow He cannot mistake her for when she was form'd nature broke the mould  Exit Prompt  Blandish  Now for the blood of me cannot I call that fellow back it is absolute infatuation ah I see how this will end  Lord Gayville  What are your apprehensions  Blandish  That my ferret yonder will do his part completely that I shall set all your uncle's doctrine at nought and thus lend myself to this wild intrigue till the girl is put into your arms  Lord Gayville  Propitious be the thought my best friendmy uncle's doctrine but advise me how shall I keep my secret from him for the present He is suspicion personified the eye of Sir Clement is a very probe to the mind  Blandish  aside  Yes and it sometimes gives one a cursed deal of pain before he is convinced of touching a sound part  To Lord Gayville  Your best chance would be to double your assiduities to Miss Alscrip But then dissimulation is so mean a vice  Lord Gayville  It is so indeed and if I give into it for a moment It is upon the determination  of never being her husband I may despise and offend a woman but disgust wou'd be no excuse for betraying her Adieu Blandish if you see Prompt first I trust to you for the quickest communication of intelligence  Blandish  I am afraid you mayI cannot resist you  Exit Lord Gayville  Ah wrongwrong wrong I hope that exclamation is not lost A blind compliance with a young man's passions is a poor plot upon his affections  Exit  SCENE III  Mrs Sagely's House  Enter Mrs Sagely and Miss Alton  Mrs Sagely  Indeed Miss Alton since you are resolved to continue that name you may bless yourself for finding me out in this wilderness Wilderness this town is ten times more dangerous to youth and innocence every man you meet is a wolf  Miss Alton  Dear Madam I see you dwell upon my indiscretion in flying to London but remember the safeguard I expected to find here How cruel was the disappointment how dangerous have been the consequences I thought the chance happy that threw a retired lodging in my way I was upon my guard against the other sex but for my own to be treacherous to an unfortunate cou'd I expect it  Mrs Sagely  Suspect every body if you wou'd be safebut most of all suspect yourself Ah my pretty truantthe heart that is so violent in it's aversions is in sad danger of being the same in it's affections depend upon it  Miss Alton  Let them spring from a just esteem and you will absolve me my aversion was to the character of the wretch I was threaten'd with can you reprove me  Mrs Sagely  And tell me truly now do you feel the same detestation for this worse character you have made acquaintance with This rake this abominable HeartlyAh child your look is suspicious  Miss Alton  Madam I have not a thought that I will not sincerely lay open to you Mr Heartly is made to please and to be avoided I desire never to see him morehis discovery of me here his letters his offers have greatly alarmed me I conjure you lose not an hour in placing me under the sort of protection I solicited  Mrs Sagely  If you are resolved I believe I can serve you Miss Alscrip the great Heiress you may have heard of the name in your family has been enquiring among decay'd gentry for a companion She is too fine a lady to bear to be alone and perhaps does not look to a husband's company as a certain dependance Your musical talent will be a great recommendationShe is already apprized and a line from me will introduce you  Miss Alton  I will avail myself of your kindness immediately  Prompt  without  I tell you I have business with Mrs SagelyI must come in  Mrs Sagely  As I live here is an impudent fellow forcing himself into the passage  Miss Alton  Oh heaven if Mr Heartly shou'd be behind  Mrs Sagely  Get into the back parlour be he who he will I'll

what do you want  Prompt  still prying about  Madam I want I wantI want  Mrs Sagely  To rob the house perhaps  Prompt  Just the contrary Madamto see that all is safe within itYou have a treasure in your possession that I wou'd not have lost for the worldA young Lady  Mrs Sagely  Indeedbegone about your business friendthere are no young ladies to be spoke with here  Prompt  Lord Madam I don't desire to speak with herMy attentions go to ladies of the elder sortI come to make proposals to you alone  Mrs Sagely  You  make proposals  to me  Did you know my late husband Sir  Prompt  Husband My good Mrs Sagely be at easeI have no more views upon you that way than upon my grandmotherMy proposals are of a quite different nature  Mrs Sagely  Of a different nature Why you audacious varlet Here call a constable  Prompt  Dear Madam how you continue to misunderstand meI have a respect for you that will set at nought all the personal temptations about you depend upon it powerful as they are And as for the young Lady my purpose is  only that you shall guard her safeI wou'd offer you a pretty snug house in a pleasant quarter of the town where you two wou'd be much more commodiously lodg'dthe furniture new and in the prettiest tasteA neat little sideboard of platea black boy with a turban to wait upon you  Mrs Sagely  And for what purpose am I to be bribedI am above it sirrah I have but a pittance 'tis true and heavy outgoingsMy husband's decayed bookkeeper to maintain and poor old Smiler that so many years together drew our whole family in a chaise Heavy chargesbut by cutting off my luxuries and stopping up a few windows I can jog on and scorn to be beholden to you or him that sent you  Prompt tries at the door and peeps thro' the keyhole  What wou'd the impertinent fellow be at now Keep the door bolted and don't stand in sight  Prompt  aside  Oh ohShe is here I find and that's enoughMy good Mrs Sagely your humble servant I woud fain be better acquainted with youin a modest waybut must wait I see a more happy hour  Aside going out  When honesty and poverty  do  happen to meet they grow so fond of each other's company it is labour lost to try to separate them  Exit  Mrs Sagely  Shut the street door after him and never let him in again  Enter Miss Alton from the inner room  Miss Alton  For mercy Madam let me begone immediately I am very uneasyI am certain Mr Heartly is at the bottom of this  Mrs Sagely  I believe it my dear and now see the necessity of your removal I'll write your letter  and heaven protect you Remember my warning Suspect yourself  Exit  Miss Alton sola  In truth I will I'll forget the forbearance of this profligate and remember only his intentions And is Gratitude then suspicious Painful lesson A woman must not think herself secure because she has no  bad  impulse to fear she must be upon her guard lest her very best should betray her  Exit  End of the First Act  ACT II  SCENE I  An apartment in Sir Clement Flint's house  Lady Emily Gayville and Clifford at Chess  Sir Clement sitting at a distance pretending to read a parchment but slyly observing them  Lady Emily  CHECKIf you do not take care you are gone the next move  Clifford  I confess Lady Emily you are on the point of compleat victory  Lady Emily  Pooh I wou'd not give a farthing for victory without a more spirited defence  Clifford  Then you must engage with those if those there are that do not find you irresistible  Lady Emily  I cou'd find a thousand such but I'll engage with none whose triumph I could not submit to with pleasure  Sir Clement  Apart  Pretty significant on both sides I wonder how much farther it will go  Lady Emily  Uncle did you speak  Sir Clement  Reading to himself  "And the parties to this indenture do farther covenant and agree that all and every the said lands tenements and hereditamentsumum"How useful sometimes is ambiguity  Loud enough to be heard  Clifford  A very natural observation of Sir Clement's upon that long parchment  Pauses again upon the chess board  Lady Emily looking pensively at his face  Clifford  To what a dilemma have you reduced  me Lady Emily If I advance I perish by my temerity and it is out of my power to retreat  Sir Clement  Apart  Better and betterTo talk in cypher is a curious faculty  Clifford  Sir  Sir Clement  Still reading  "In witness whereof the said parties have hereunto interchangeably set their hands and seals thisumumday of umum"  Lady Emily  Resuming an air of vivacity  Come I trifle with you too longThere's your coup de graceUncle I have conquer'd  Both rising from the table  Sir Clement  Niece I do not doubt itand in the style of the great proficients without looking upon the board Clifford was not your mother's name Charlton  Folding up the parchment and rising  Clifford  It was Sir  Sir Clement  In looking over the writings Alscrip has sent me preparatory to his daughter's settlement I find mention of a conveyance from a Sir William Charlton of Devonshire Was he a relation  Clifford  My grandfather Sir The plunder of his fortune was one of the first materials for raising that of Mr Alscrip who was steward to Sir William's estate then manager of his difficulties and lastly his sole creditor  Sir Clement  And no better monopoly than that of a man's distresses Alscrip has had twenty such or I should not have singled out his daughter to be Lord Gayville's wife  Clifford  It is a compensation for my family losses that in the event they will conduce to the interest of the man I most love  Sir Clement  Hey day Cliffordtake care don't trench upon the Blandish  Your  cue you know is Sincerity  Clifford  You seem to think Sir there is no such quality I doubt whether you believe there is an honest man in the world  Sir Clement  You do me great injusticeseveralseveraland upon the old principle that "honesty is the best policy"Selfinterest is the great end of life says human natureHonesty is a better agent than craftsays proverb  Clifford  But as for ingenuous or purely disinterested motives  Sir Clement  Clifford do you mean to laugh at me  Clifford  What is your opinion Lady Emily  Lady Emily  Endeavouring again at vivacity  That there may be such but it's odds they are troublesome or insipid Pure ingenuousness I take it is a rugged sort of thing which scarcely will bear the polish of common civility and for disinterestednessyoung people sometimes set out with it but it is like travelling upon a broken springone is glad to get it mended at the next stage  Sir Clement  Emily I protest you seem to study after me proceed child and we will read together every character that comes in our way  Lady Emily  Read one's acquaintancedelightful what romances novels satires and mock heroics present themselves to my imagination Our young men are flimsy essays old ones political pamphlets coquets fugitive pieces and  fashionable beauties  a compilation of advertized perfumery essence of pearl milk of roses and Olympian dewLord I should now and then  tho' turn over an acquaintance with a sort of fear and trembling  Clifford  How so  Lady Emily  Lest one should pop unaware upon something one should  not  like a naughty speech in an old comedy but it is only skipping what wou'd make one blush  Sir Clement  Or if you did not skip when a woman reads  by  herself and  to  herself there are wicked philosophers who doubt whether her blushes are very troublesome  Lady Emily  To Sir Clement  Do you know now that for that speech of your'sand for that saucy smile of yours  to Clifford  I am strongly tempted to read you both aloud  Sir Clement  Come tryI'll be the first to open the book  Lady Emily  A treatise of the Houyhnhnms after the manner of Swift tending to make us odious to ourselves and to extract morose mirth from our imperfections  turning to Clifford  Contrasted with an exposition of ancient morality address'd to the moderns a chimerical attempt upon an obsolete subject  Sir Clement  Clifford we must double down that page And now we'll have a specimen of her Ladyship  Lady Emily  I'll give it you myself and with justice which is more than either of you wou'd  Sir Clement  And without skipping  Lady Emily  Thus thena light airy fantastic sketch of genteel manners as they are with a little endeavour at what they ought to berather entertaining than instructive not without art but sparing in the use of it  Sir Clement  But the passions Emily Do not  forget what should stand in the foreground of a female treatise  Lady Emily  They abound but mixed and blended cleverly enough to prevent any from predominating like the colours of a shot lutestring that change as you look at it sideways or full they are sometimes brighten'd by vivacity and now and then subject to a shade of capricebut meaning no illnot afraid of a critical review and thus gentlemen I present myself to you fresh from the press and I hope not inelegantly bound  Sir Clement  Altogether making a perfectly desireable companion for the closet I am sure Clifford you will agree with me Gad we are got into such a pleasant freedom with each other it is a pity to separate while any curiosity remains in the companyPrithee Clifford satisfy me a little as to your history Old Lord Hardacre if I am rightly informed disinherited your father his second son  Clifford  For the very marriage we have been speaking of The little fortune my father could call his own was sunk before his death as a provision for my mother upon an idea that whatever resentment he might personally have incurredit would not be extended to an innocent offspring  Sir Clement  A very silly confidence How readily now should you and I Emily have discover'd in a sensible old man the irreconcilable offence of a marriage of the passionsYou understand me  Lady Emily  Perfectly  aside  Old petrifaction your hints always speak forceably  Sir Clement  But your uncle the present Lord made amends  Clifford  Amply He offer'd to send me from Cambridge to an academy in Germany to fit  me for foreign service Well judging that a cannon ball was a fair and quick provision for a poor relation  Sir Clement  Upon my word I have known uncles less considerate  Clifford  When Lord Gayville's friendship and your indulgence made me the companion of his travels Lord Hardacre's  undivided  cares devolved upon my sister whose whole independant possession at my mother's death was five hundred pounds All our education had permitted that unhappy parent to lay by  Lady Emily  Oh for an act of justice and benevolence to reconcile me to the odious man Tell me this instant what did he do for Miss Clifford  Clifford  He bestow'd upon her forty pounds a year upon condition that she resided with a family of his dependants in a remote county to save the family from disgrace and that allowance when I heard last from her he had threaten'd to withdraw upon her refusing a detestable match he had endeavour'd to force upon her  Lady Emily  Poor girl  Sir Clement  Upon my word an interesting story and told with pathetic effectEmily you look grave child  Lady Emily  aside  I shall not own it however  to him  For once my dear uncle you want your spectacles My thoughts are on a diverting subjectMy first visit to Miss Alscrip to take a near view of that collection of charms destined to my happy brother  Sir Clement  You need not go out of the room for that purpose The schedule of an Heiress's fortune is a compendium of her merits and the true security for marriage happiness  Lady Emily  I am sure I guess at your system  That  union must be most wise which has wealth to support it and no affections to disturb it  Sir Clement  Right  Lady Emily  That makes a divorce the first promise of wedlock and widowhood the best blessing of life that separates the interest of husband wife and child  Sir Clement  To establish the independent comfort of all  Lady Emily  Upon the broad basis of family hatred Excellent my dear Uncle excellent indeed and upon that principle tho' the Lady is likely to be your niece and my sister I am sure you will have no objection to my laughing at her a little  Sir Clement  You'll be puzzled to make her more ridiculous than I think her What is your plan  Lady Emily  Why tho' her pride is to be thought a leader in fashions she is sometimes a servile copyist Blandish tells me I am her principal model and what is most provoking she is intent upon catching my manner as well as my dress which she exaggerates to an excess that vexes me Now if she  will  take me in shade I'll give her a new outline I am resolved and if I do not make her a caricature for a printshop  Clifford  Will all this be strictly consistent with your good nature Lady Emily  Lady Emily  No nor I don't know when I shall do any thing consistent with it again except leaving you two critics to a better subject than your humble servant  Curtsies and exit with a lively air  Sir Clement  Well Clifford What do you think of her  Clifford  That when she professes illtemper she is a very aukward counterfeit  Sir Clement  But her beauty her wit her improvement since you went abroad I expected from a man of your age and taste something more than a cold compliment upon her temperCould not you compatibly with the immaculate sincerity you possess venture as far as admiration  Clifford  I admire her Sir as I do a bright star in the firmament and consider the distance of both as equally immeasureable  Sir Clement  aside  Specious rogue  to him  Well leave Emily then to be wink'd at through telescopes and now to a matter of nearer observationWhat is Gayville doing  Clifford  Every thing you desire Sir I trust but you know I have been at home only three days and have hardly seen him since I came  Sir Clement  Nor I neither but I find he has profited wonderfully by foreign experienceAfter rambling half the world over without harm he is caught like a travell'd woodcock at his landing  Clifford  If you suspect Lord Gayville of indiscretion why do you not put him candidly to the test I'll be bound for his ingenuousness not to withhold any confession you may require  Sir Clement  You may be right but he'll confess more to you in an hour than to me in a month for all that come Clifford look as you ought to do at your interestSift himWatch himYou cannot guess how much you will make me your friend and how grateful I may be if you will discover  Clifford  Sir you mistake the footing upon which Lord Gayville and I live I am often the partner of his thoughts but never a spy upon his actions  Bow and exit  Sir Clement  alone  Well play'd Clifford Good air and emphasis and well suited to the trick of the sceneHe wou'd do if the practical part of deceit were as easy at his age as discernment of it is at mine Gayville and Emily if they had not a vigilant guard would be his sure prey for they are the examples of the generous affections coming to maturity with their stature wh  le suspicion art and interest are still dormant in the seed I must employ Blandish in this businessA rascal of a different castBelow Clifford in hypocrisy but greatly above him in the scale of impudence They shall both forward my ends while they think they are pursuing their own I shall ever be sure of a man's endeavours to serve me while I hold out a lure to his knavery and interest  Exit  SCENE II  An Antichamber  Alscrip  without  Dinner not order'd till seven o'clockBid the kitchen maid get me some eggs and baconPlague what with the time of dining and the French cookery I am in the land of starvation with half St James'sMarket upon my weekly bills  Enter  while speaking the last sentence  What a change have I made to please my unpleaseable daughter Instead of my regular meal at Furnival'sInn here am I transported to BerkleySquare to fast at  Alscrip House  till my fine company come from their morning ride two hours after darkNay its worse if I am carried among my great neighbours in Mi  s Alscrip's suite as she calls it My Lady  looks  over me my Lord walks over me and sets me in a little tottering cane chair at the cold corner of the tableTho' I have a mortgage upon the house and furniture and  arrears due of the whole interest It's a pleasure tho' to be well dressed My daughter maintains all fashions are founded in senseIcod the tightness of my wig and the stiffness of my cape give me the sense of the pillory Plaguy scanty about the hips tooAnd the breast something of a merry thought reversed But there is some sense in  that  for if one sex pares away in proportion where the other swells we shall take up no more room in the world than we did before  Enter a Servant  Servant  Sir Miss Alscrip wishes to see you She is at her toilet  Alscrip  Who is with her  Servant  Only Mrs Blandish Sir  Alscrip  She must content herself with that company 'till I have had my whetorder up the eggs and bacon  Exit  SCENE III  Miss Alscrip discovered at her toilette Chignon her Valet de Chambre dressing her head Mrs Blandish sitting by and holding a box of diamond pins  Miss Alscrip  And so Blandish you really think that the introduction of Otahaite feathers in my trimming succeeded  Mrs Blandish  Oh with the mixture of those charming Italian flowers and the knots of pearl that gather'd up the festoons never any thing had so happy an effectIt put the whole ballroom out of humour and that's the surest test of good taste Monsieur Chignon that pin a little more to the front  Miss Alscrip  And what did they say  Mrs Blandish  You know it is the first solicitude of my life to see the friend of my heart treated with justiceSo when you stood up to dance I  got into the thick of the circleMonsieur don't you think this large diamond wou'd be well placed just in the middle  Chignon  Eh non Madame ce na releve pas Dat give no relief to de weight of de curl Full in de front un gros bouton von great nob of  diamend  pardie ce seroit un accommodage a' la PolyphÃ©me de big eye of de geante in de centre of de forehead  Miss Alscrip  Chignon is right in point of taste tho' not quite so happy in his allusions as he is sometimes  Chignon  Ah Madame

Miss Alscrip  Smiling at Chignon and then turning to Mrs Blandish  WellAnd so  Mrs Blandish  So it was all admiration Elegant says Lady Spite It may do very well for Miss Alscrip who never looks at expence The dress of a bridal princess cries Mrs Scanty and for one night's wear too  Miss Alscrip  Delightful The very language I wish'd forOh how charmingly apropos was my accident did you see when my trimming in the passepied of a cotillion came luckily in contact with Billy Skim's great shoe buckleHow it ripp'd away  Mrs Blandish  Did  I see it  Miss Alscrip  One of the great feathers stuck fast on the shoe and looked for all the world like the heel wing of a Mercury in a pantomime  Mrs Blandish  Oh you witty creature how you describe  Miss Alscrip  It was a most becoming rent  Mrs Blandish  And what a display of indifference what an example for a woman of fortune did you exhibit in the bustle of picking up the scattered fragments  Miss Alscrip  When the pearls were trundling about and I insisted upon the company being no longer disturbed but wou'd leave what remained for fairy favours to the maid who swept the room He he heDo you think Lady Emily wou'd have done that better  Mrs Blandish  Lady Emily poor girlHow soon must she submit to be the humble second of the family  Miss Alscrip  He he he Do you sincerely think so Blandish And yet it wou'd be strange if it were otherwise for I cou'd buy her tentimes over  Chignon  Madame vat humeure vould you wear to day  Miss Alscrip  Humour Chignon What am I dressed for now  Chignon  The parfaite aimble Madame but by bringing de point of de hair more down to de eyebrow or adding a littel blowse to de sides I can give you de look severe capricieusevat you please  Miss Alscrip  We'll put it off for half an hour I am not quite decided I was in the capricieuse yesterdayI believe I shall keep on the perfect amiable  Exit Chignon  Tiffany take off my powdering gownAh hoHow the wench tugsdo you think you are pulling off the coachman's great coat  Mrs Blandish  My dear amiabledo not let that sweet temper be ruffledWhy will you not employ me in these little offices Delicacy  like your's should be waited upon by the softness of a sylph  During this speech Exit Tiffany peevish  Miss Alscrip  I  am  promised a creature to be about me out of the common way  Mrs Blandish  A new woman  Miss Alscrip  No something to be raised much higher and at the same time fitted better to receive one's illhumour An humble companion well born well educated and perfectly dependant is a most useful appurtenance in the best families  Mrs Blandish  Well do not raise her to the rank of a friend lest I should be jealous  Miss Alscrip  You may be perfectly secure I shall take particular care that friendship shall be out of the question on both sides I had once thought of a restoration of pages to sit in scarlet and silver as one reads in former times upon the forepart of the coach and to hold up one's trainbut I have a new male attendant in a Valet de Chambre who has possession of my bustMy two women will have the charge from the point of the shoulder to the toeSo my person being provided for the Countess of Gayville shall have an attendant to wait upon her mind  Mrs Blandish  I vow a most elegant and uncommon thought  Miss Alscrip  One that can pen a note in the familiar the punctilious or the wittyIt's quite troublesome to be always writing wit for one's selfBut above all she is to have a talent for music  Mrs Blandish  Aye your very soul is framed for harmony  Miss Alscrip  I have not quite determin'd what to call herGovernante of the private chamber keeper of the boudoir with a silver key at her breast  Enter Chignon  Chignon  Madame a young lady beg to know if you be visible  Miss Alscrip  A young ladyIt is not lady Emily Gayville  Chignon  Non Madame but if you were absente and I had the adjustment of her head she wou'd be the most chamante personne I did ever see  Miss Alscrip  Introduce her  Exit Chignon  Who can this be  Mrs Blandish  Some woman of taste to enquire your correspondent at Parisor  Enter Miss Alton  Miss Alscrip curtsying respectfully Miss Alton retiring disconcerted  Miss Alscrip  Of taste indeed by her appearanceWho's in the antichamber Why did they not open the folding doorsChignon approach a fauteuil for the lady  Miss Alton  Madam I come  Miss Alscrip  Madam pray be seated  Miss Alton  Excuse me Madam  Miss Alscrip  Madam I must beg  Miss Alton  Madam this letter will inform you how little pretensions I have to the honours you are offering  Miss Alscrip  reads  Miss Alton the bearer of this is the person I recommend as worthy  the honor of attending you as a companion  eyes her scornfully  She is born a gentlewoman I dare say her talents and good qualities will speak more in her favour than any words I could useI am Madam your most obedient umum  Blandish was there ever such a mistake  Blandish  Oh you dear giddy  absent  creature what could you be thinking of  Miss Alscrip  Absent  indeed  Chignon give  me  the fauteuil  throws herself into it  young woman where were you educated  Miss Alton  Chiefly Madam with my parents  Miss Alscrip  But finish'd I take it for granted at a country boarding school for we have "young ladies" you know Blandish  "boarded and educated"  upon blue boards in gold letters in every village with a strolling player for a dancing master and a deserter from Dunkirk to teach the French grammar  Mrs Blandish  How that genius of your's does paint nothing escapes youI dare say you have anticipated this young lady's story  Miss Alton  It is very true Madam my life can afford nothing to interest the curiosity of you two ladies it has been too insignificant to merit your concern and attended with no circumstances to excite your pleasantry  Miss Alscrip  yawning  I hope child it will be attended with such for the future as will add to your ownI cannot bear a mope about me I am told you have a talent for musiccan you touch that harpIt stands here as a piece of furniture but I have a notion it is kept in tune by the man who comes to wind up my clocks  Miss Alton  Madam I dare not disobey you But I have been us'd to perform before a most partial audience I am afraid strangers will think my talent too humble to be worthy attention  A SONG  I  For tenderness framed in life's earliest day  A parent's soft sorrows to mine led the way  The lesson of pity was caught from her eye  And e'er words were my own I spoke in a sigh  II  The nightingale plunder'd the matewidow'd dove  The warbled complaint of the suffering grove  To youth as it ripened gave sentiment new  The object still changing the sympathy true  III  Soft embers of passion yet rest in the glow  A warmth of more pain may this breast never know  Or if too indulgent the blessing I claim  Let the spark drop from reason that wakens the flame  Miss Alscrip  I declare not amiss Blandish only a little too plaintivebut I dare say she can play a country dance when the enlivening is requiredSo Miss Alton you are welcome to my protection and indeed I wish you to stay from this hourMy toilette being nearly finish'd I shall have a horrid vacation till dinner  Miss Alton  Madam you do me great honour and I very readily obey you  Mrs Blandish  I wish you joy Miss Alton of the most enviable situation a young person of elegant talents could be raised toYou and I will vie with each other to prevent our dear countess ever knowing a melancholy hourShe has but one fault to correctthe giving way to the soft effusions of a too tender heart  Enter Servant  Servant  Madam a letter  Miss Alscrip  It's big enough for a state pacquetOh mercy a petitionfor heav'n's sake Miss Alton look it over  Miss Alton reads  I should as soon read one of lady Newchapel's methodist sermonsWhat does it contain  Miss Alton  Madam an uncommon series of calamities which prudence cou'd neither see nor prevent the reverse of a whole family from affluence and content to misery and imprisonment and it adds that the parties have the honour remotely to be allied to you  Miss Alscrip  Female relations aye they always think one's made of money  Miss Alton  That some years ago  Enter another servant    d Servant  A messenger Madam from the animal repository with the only puppy of the Peruvians and the refusal at twenty guineas  Miss Alscrip  As I live the offspring of the beauteous Aza who has so long been thought past hopes of continuing his family Were he to ask fifty I must have him  Mrs Blandish  offering to run out  I vow I'll give him the first kiss  Miss Alscrip  stopping her  I'll swear you shan't  Miss Alton  Madam I was just finishing the petition  Miss Alscrip  It's throwing money awaybut give him a crown  Exit with Mrs Blandish striving which shall be first  Miss Alton  "The soft effusions of a too tender heart" The proof is excellent That the covetous should be deaf to the miserable I can conceive but I should not have believed if I had not seen that a taste for profusion did not find its first indulgence  in benevolence  Exit  End of Act the Second  ACT III  SCENE I  Miss Alscrip's dressing room continued  Miss Alton  THANKS to Mrs Blandish's inexhaustible talent for encomium I shall be relieved from one part of a companion that my nature revolts at But who comes here It's well if I shall not be exposed to impertinences I was not aware of  Enter Chignon  aside  Ma foi la voilaI will lose no time to pay my addresseNow for de humble maniere and de unperplex assurance of my

de chambreTaste for ever Now if  I  was to give the charge of my person to a waiting maid they'd say I was indelicate  as he crosses the stage Chignon keeps sideling to intercept his sight and bowing as he looks towards him  What the devil is Mounseer at I thought all his agility lay in his fingers what anticks is the monkey practising He twists and doubles himself as if he had a rareeshow at his back  Chignon  aside  Be gar no rareeshow for you Monsieur Alscrip if I can help  Alscrip  spying Miss Alton  Ah ah What have we got there Monsieur who is that  Chignon  Sir my lady wish to speak to

shall give her companion some cautions against saucy Frenchmen sirrah  Chignon  aside  Cautious peste you are subject a' cautions yourselfI suspecte you to be von old rake but no ver dangerous rival  Exit  Alscrip  to himself and lookng at her with his glass  The devil is never tired of throwing baits in my way  She comes forward modestly  By all that's delicious I must be better acquainted with her  He bows She curtsies the music book still in her hand  But how to beginMy usual way of attacking my daughter's maids will never do  Miss Alton  aside  My situation is very embarrassing  Alscrip  Beauteous stranger give me leave to add my welcome to my daughter's Since Alscrip House was establish'd she never brought any thing into it to please me before  Miss Alton  a little confused  Sir it is a great additional honour to that Miss Alscrip has done me to be thought worthy so respectable a protection as your's  Alscrip  I cou'd furnish you with a better word than respectable It sounds so distant and my feelings have so little to do with cold respectI never had such a desireto make myself agreeable  Miss Alton  aside  A very strange old man  To him more confused  Sir you'll pardon me I believe Miss Alscrip is waiting  Alscrip  Don't be afraid my dear enchanting diffident zounds what a flutter am I in don't be afraidmy disposition to be sure is too susceptible but then it is likewise so dovelike so tender and so innocent Come play me that tune and enchant my ear as you have done my eye  Miss Alton  Sir I wish to be excused indeed it does not deserve your attention  Alscrip  Not deserve it I had rather hear you than all the Italians in the Haymarket even when they sue the managers and their purses chink the symphony in Westminster Hall  presenting the harp  Miss Alton  Sir it is to avoid the affectation of refusing what is so little worth asking for  Takes the harp and plays a few bars of a lively air Alscrip kisses her fingers with rapture  Alscrip  Oh the sweet little twiddlediddles  Miss Alton  For shame Sir what do you mean  Alscrip gets hold of both her hands and continues kissing her fingers  Miss Alton  struggling  Help  Miss Alscrip  entering  I wonder what my papa is doing all this time  starts  A short pause  Miss Alscrip surprised Miss Alton confused Alscrip puts his hand to his eye  Alscrip  Oh child I have got something in my eye that makes me almost madA little midgeI believeGad I caught hold of this young lady's hands in one of my twitches and her nerves were as much in a flutter as if I had bit her  Miss Alscrip  significantly  Yes my dear papa I perceive you  have  something in your eye and I'll do my best to take it out immediatelyMiss Alton will you do me the favour to walk into the drawingroom  Miss Alton  I hope Madam you will permit me at a proper opportunity to give my explanation of what has passed  Retires  Miss Ascrip  There's no occasion  Miss Alton being out of hearing  Let it rest among the catalogue of wonders like the Glastonbury thorn that blooms at ChristmasTo be serious papa Though I carried off your behaviour as well as I cou'd I am really shock'd at itA man of your years and of a profession where the opinion of the world is of such consequence  Alscrip  My dear Molly have not I quitted the practice of attorney and turned fine gentleman to laugh at the world's opinion or had I not do you suppose the kiss of a pretty wench wou'd hurt a lawyer My dear Molly if the fraternity had no other reflections to be afraid of  Miss Alscrip  Oh hideous Molly indeed you ought to have forgot I had a christen'd name long ago am not I going to be a countess If you did not stint my fortune by squand'ring your's away upon dirty trulls I might be call'd your grace  Alscrip  Spare your lectures and you shall be call'd your highness if you please  Enter Servant  Servant  Madam lady Emily Gayville is in her carriage in the street will your ladyship be at home  Miss Alscrip  Yes shew her into the drawingroom  Exit Servant  I entreat Sir you will keep a little more guard upon your passions consider the dignity of your house and if you must be cooing buy a French figurante  Exit  Alscrip  Well said my lady countess well said quality morals What am I the better for burying a jealous wife To be chickenpeck'd is a new persecution more provoking than the old oneOh Molly MollyPlague upon the example of an independent heiress  Exit  SCENE II  The Drawing Room  Miss Alton  alone  What perplexing scenes I already meet with in this house I ought however to be contented in the security it affords  against the attempts of Heartly I  am  contentedBut oh Clifford It was hard to be left alone to the choice of distresses  Enter Chignon introducing Lady Emily  Chignon  My Lady Emily GayvilleMadame no here Madamoiselle announce if you please my lady  Lady Emily  aside  Did my ears deceive me surely I heard the name of Cliffordand it escaped in an accentPray Sir who is that  to Chignon  Chignon  Madamoiselle Alton confidante of my lady and next after me in her suite  Examines her head dress impertinently Miss Alton with great modesty rises and puts her work together  Lady Emily  There seems to be considerable difference in the decorum of her attendants You need not stay Sir  Chignon  as he goes out  Ma foi sa tÃªte est passableher head may pass  Lady Emily  aside  How my heart beats with curiosity  Miss Alton having dispos'd her things in her workbag is retiring with a curtsy  MissAlton I am in no haste On the contrary I think the occasion fortunate that allows me to begin an acquaintance with a person of so amiable an appearance I don't know whether that pert foreigner has led me into an errorbut without being too inquisitive may I ask if you make any part of this family  Miss Alton  Madam I am under Miss Alscrip's protection I imagine I am represented as her dependant I am not ashamed of humble circumstances  that are not the consequences of indiscretion  Lady Emily  That with such claims to respect you should be in any circumstances of humiliation is a disgrace to the age we live in  Miss Alton  Madam my humiliation if such it be is just Perhaps I have been too proud and my heart required this selfcorrection A life of retired industry might have been more pleasing to me but an orphana strangerignorant and diffident I preferr'd my present situation as one less exposed to misrepresentation  Bell rings  I can no longer detain Miss Alscrip from the honour of receiving your Ladyship  A respectful curtsy and Exit  Lady Emily  There is something strangely mysterious and affecting in all thiswhat delicacy of sentimentwhat softness of manners and how well do these qualities accord with that sigh for Clifford she had been proudproud of what of Clifford's love It is too plain But then to account for her present conditionHe has betrayed and abandoned hertoo plain again I fearShe talked too of a self corrected hearttake example Emily and recal thine from an object which it ought more than ever to renounce But here come the Alscrip and her friend lud lud lud how shall I recover my spirits I must attempt it and if I lose my present thoughts in a trial of extravagance be it of their's or my own it will be a happy expedient  Enter Miss Alscrip and Mrs Blandish  Miss Alscrip runs up to Lady Emily and kisse her forehead  Lady Emily  I ask your pardon Madam for being so aukward but I confess I did not expect so elevated a salute  Miss Alscrip  Dear Lady Emily I had no notion of its not being universal In France the touch of the lips just between the eyebrows has been adopted for years  Lady Emily  I perfectly acknowledge the propriety of the custom It is almost the only spot of the face where the touch wou'd not risk a confusion of complexions  Miss Alscrip  He he he what a pretty thought  Mrs Blandish  How I have long'd for this day Come let me put an end to ceremony and join the hands of the sweetest pair that ever nature and fortune marked for connection  Joins their hands  Miss Alscrip  Thank you my good Blandish tho' I was determined to break the ice Lady Emily in the first place I met you But you were not at Lady Doricourt's last night  Lady Emily  affectedly  No I went home directly from the Opera projected the revival of a cap read a page in the trials of Temper went to bed and dream'd I was Belinda in the Rape of the Lock  Mrs Blandish  Elegant creature  Miss Alscrip  aside  I must have that air if I die for it  Imitating  I too came home early supped with my old gentleman made him explain my marriage articles dower and heirs entail read a page in a trial of Divorce and dream'd of a rose colour equipage with emblems of Cupids issuing out of Coronets  Mrs Blandish  Oh you sweet twins of perfection what equality in every thing I have thought of a name for youThe inseparable inimitables  Miss Alscrip  I declare I shall like it exceedingly  one sees so few uncopied originalsthe thing I cannot bear  Lady Emily  Is vulgar imitationI must catch the words from your mouth to shew you how we agree  Miss Alscrip  Exactly Not that one wishes to be without affectation  Lady Emily  Oh mercy forbid  Miss Alscrip  But to catch a manner and weave it as I may say into one's own originality  Mrs Blandish  Pretty pretty  Lady Emily  That's the artLord if one liv'd entirely upon one's own whims who would not be run out in a twelvemonth  Miss Alscrip  Dear Lady Emily don't you doat upon folly  Lady Emily  To extacy I only despair of seeing it well kept up  Miss Alscrip  I flatter myself there is no great danger of that  Lady Emily  You are mistaken We have it's true some examples of the extravaganza in high life that no other country can match but withal many a false sister that starts as one wou'd think in the very hey day of the fantastic yet comes to a standstill in the midst of the course  Mrs Blandish  Poor spiritless creatures  Lady Emily  Do you know there is more than one duchess who has been seen in the same carriage with her husbandlike two doves in a basket in the print of Conjugal Felicity and another has been detected I almost blush to name it  Mrs Blandish  Bless us where and how and how  Lady Emily  In nursing her own child  Miss Alscrip  Oh barbarismFor heaven's  sake let us change the subject You were mentioning a reviv'd cap Lady Emily any thing of the Henry quatre  Lady Emily  Quite different An English mob under the chin and artless ringlets in natural colour that shall restore an admiration for Prior's Nut Brown Maid  Miss Alscrip  Horrid shocking  Lady Emily  Absolutely necessary To be different from the rest of the world we must now revert to nature Make haste or you have so much to undo you will be left behind  Miss Alscrip  I dare say so But who can vulgarize all at once What will the French say  Lady Emily  We are to have an interchange of fashions and follies upon a basis of unequivocal reciprocity  Miss Alscrip  Fashions and folliesoh what a promising manufacture  Lady Emily  Yes and one thank heaven that we may defy the edict of any potentate to prohibit  Miss Alscrip  with an affected drop of her lip in her laugh  He he he he he he  Lady Emily  My dear Miss Alscrip what are you doing I must correct you as I love you Sure you must have observed the drop of the under sip is exploded since Lady Simpermode broke a tooth  Sets her mouth affectedly  I am preparing the cast of the lips for the ensuing winterthus It is to be call'd the Paphian mimp  Miss Alscrip  imitating  I swear I think it prettyI must try to get it  Lady Emily  Nothing so easy It is done by one cabalistical word like a metamorphosis in the fairy tales You have only when before your glass  to keep pronouncing to yourself niminiprimini the lips

vapours  Miss Alton  Madam  Miss Alscrip  Oh never look alarmedIt is only to convey my refusal of his visit and to set his  alarms afloat a littleparticularly with jealousy that's the master torment  Miss Alton  Really Madam the task you wou'd impose upon me  Miss Alscrip  Will be a great improvement to  you  and quite right for me Teasetease and tame is a rule without exception from the keeper of the lions to the teacher of a piping bulfinch  Mrs Blandish  But you hard hearted thing will you name any object for his jealousy  Miss Alscrip  No keep him there in the dark Always keep your creature in the darkThat's another secret of tamingDon't be grave Lady Emily  whose attention is fixed on Miss Alton  Your brother's purgatory shall be short and I'll take the reconciliation scene upon myself  Lady Emily  endeavouring to recover herself  I cannot but pity him especially as I am sure that do what you will he will always regard you with the same eyes And so my sweet sister I leave him to your mercy and to that of your representative whose disposition if I have any judgment is ill suited to a task of severity  Mrs Blandish  Dear Lady Emily carry me away with you When a lover is coming it shall never be said I am in the way  Lady Emily  I am at your orders  looking at Miss Alton  asides  What a suspense am I to suffer a moment more and I shall betray myselfadieu Miss Alscrip  Miss

like you  Exit  Miss Alscrip  Now for it Miss AltonOnly remember that you are doubling  me  the woman he adores  Miss Alton  Indeed Madam I am quite incapable of executing you orders to your satisfaction The utmost I can undertake is a short message  Miss Alscrip  Never fear  Knock at the door  There he comesStep aside and I'll give you your very words  Exeunt  Enter Lord Gayville conducted by a Servant  Lord Gayville  So now to get thorough this piece of drudgery There's a meanness in my proceeding and my compunction is just Oh the dear lost possessor of my heart lost irrecoverably lost  Enter Miss Alton from the bottom of the Scene  Miss Alton  A pretty employment I am sent upon  Lord Gayville  to himself  Could she but know the sacrifice I am ready to make  Miss Alton  to herself  The very picture of a lover if absence of mind marks one It is unpleasant for me to interrupt a man I never saw but I shall deliver my message very concisely My Lord  Lord Gayville  turning  Madam  both start and stand in surprize  Astonishment Miss Alton my charming fugitive  Miss Alton  How Mr HeartlyLord Gayville  Lord Gayville  My joy and my surprize are alike unutterable But I conjure you Madam tell me by what strange circumstance do I meet you here  Miss Alton  aside  Now assist me honest pride assist me resentment  Lord Gayville  You spoke to me Did you know me  Miss Alton  No otherwise my Lord than as Miss Alscrip's lover I had a message from her to your lordship  Lord Gayville  For heaven's sake Madam in what capacity  Miss Alton  In one my Lord not very much above the class of a servant  Lord Gayville  Impossible sure It is to place the brilliant below the foilto make the inimitable work of nature secondary to art and defect  Miss Alton  It is to take refuge in a situation that offers me security against suspicious obligation against vile design against the attempts of a seducerIt is to exercise the patience that the will and perhaps the favor of heaven meant to try  Lord Gayville  Cruel cruel to yourself and me Could I have had a happiness like that of assisting you against the injustice of fortuneand when to be thus degraded was the alternative  Miss Alton  My Lord it is fit I should be explicit Reflect upon the language you have held to  me  view the character in which you present yourself to this family and then pronounce in whose breast we must look for a sense of degradation  Lord Gayville  In mine and mine alone I confess itHear nevertheless my defenceMy actions are all the result of love And culpable as I may seem my conscience does not reproach me with  Miss Alton  Oh my Lord I readily believe youYou are above its reproaches Qualities that are infamous and fatal in one class of life create applause and conscientious satisfaction in another  Lord Gayville  Infamous and fatal qualiites What means my lovely accuser  Miss Alton  That to steal or stab is death in common life but when one of your lordship's degree sets his hard heart upon the destruction of a woman how glorious is his success How consummate his triumph When he can follow the theft of her affections by the murder of her honour  Miss Alscrip enters softly behind  Miss Alscrip  I wonder how it goes on  Lord Gayville  Exalted Adorable woman  Miss Alscrip  Adorable Aye I thought how 'twou'd be  Lord Gayville  Hear me I conjure

than severe  Kneels  Miss Alscrip  Humph I hope he means me though  Lord Gayville  The character in which you see me here makes me appear more odious to myself if possible than I am to you  Miss Alscrip  behind  By all that's treacherous I doubt it  Miss Alton  Desist my Lord Miss Alscrip has a claim  Miss Alscrip  Aye now for it  Lord Gayville  By heav'n she is my aversion It is my family on

Miss Alscrip  looking at Lord Gayville  Expressive dignity  looking at Miss Alton  Sweet simplicity Amiable diffidence  She should execute my commands most aukwardly  Lord Gayville  aside  There is but one way  to Miss Alscrip  Madam your sudden entrance has effected a discovery which with shame I confess ought to have been made before The lady who stands there is in possession of my heart If it

to justify this scene I thought it the part of duty to myself and respect to you But your behaviour has now left but one sentiment upon my mind  Miss Alscrip  And what is that Madam  Miss Alton  With pointed expression  Scorn  Exit  Miss Alscrip  Was there ever any thing like this before and to a woman of my fortune I to be robb'd of a loverand that a poor Lord tooI'll have the act reviv'd against

Upon all these matters Mr Alscrip I am authorized by my client Sir Clement Flint to agree There remains nothing but your favouring me with the inspection of the Charlton title deeds and your daughter's settlements may be engrossed  Alscrip  I cannot conceive my friend Rightly any such inspection to be requisite Have not I been in constant quiet possession  Rightly  Sir Clement insists upon it  Alscrip  A client insist and you an old practitioner suffer such a demur to your infallibility Ah in my practice I had the sure means of disappointing such dabblers and divers into their own

Brother Rightly we know the world and are aloneI have lock'd the door  in a half whisper  Rightly  A very useless precaution I have not a principle nor a proceeding that I wou'd not proclaim at Charingcross  Alscrip  aside  No then I'll pronounce you the most silly or the most impudent fellow of the fraternity  Rightly  But where are these writings You can have no difficulty in laying your hand upon them  for I perceive you keep things in a distinguish'd regularity  Alscrip  Yes I have distinct repositories for all papers and especially title deedsSome in drawers Some in closets  aside

purpose for which I brought you here  Clifford  I profess Sir I am in the dark If it concerns Lord Gayville's secret  Sir Clement  Namely that I have discovered without your assistance that this Dulcinea has started up in the shape of Miss Alscrip's musical companionHer name is Alton  leering  I tell it you because I am sure you did not know itor if you hada friend's secret ought to be sacred and to keep it from the only person who by knowing it cou'd save him from destruction would be a new exercise of your virtue  Clifford  Sir you will not know me  Sir Clement  Tut tut don't do me such injustice Come all delicacy being over by my having made the discovery will you talk to this girl  Clifford  For what end Sir  Sir Clement  If you state yourself as Lord Gayville's friend she will

chastity to effect itleave her to meif she has no hold upon him but her person I shall be easy  Clifford  Sir let my compliance convince you how much I wish to oblige you If I can get a sight of this

hah I vow a clever looking man  Clifford  seeing Tiffany  A good smart girl but not altogether quakerlike in her apparel nor does her air quite answer my conception of a goddess  Tiffany  aside  How he examines me so much the betterI shall lose nothing by that I believe  Clifford  Faith a pretty attracting countenance but for that apprehensive and timid look that awe impressing modesty my friend so forcibly describ'd  Tiffany adjusts herself and pulls up  Clifford  aside  There is no judging of that wonderful sex by rational rulesHer silence marks diffidence deuce take me if I know how to begin for fear of offending her reserve  Tiffany  aside  I have been told pertness became meI'll try I'm resolved  to him  I hear Sir you had something to say to a young person of this housethatthat

Tiffany  Am I mistaken Sir Pray whom was you enquiring after  Clifford  Oh certainly you my pretty stranger A friend of mine has been robbed of his heart and I see the felony in your looks  Tiffany

must I arrest you  Tiffany  Innocent Sir in fact but not quite so in inclinationI hope your own is safe  Clifford  And were it not my smart unconscionable would you run away with that also  Tiffany  Oh yes and an hundred more and melt them all down together as the Jews do stolen goods  to prevent their being reclaim'dGold silver and lead pray Sir of what metal may your's be  Clifford  aside  Astonishing Have I hit upon the moment when her fancy outruns her art Or has it been Gayville's amusement to describe her by contraries And are you really the young Lady that is the companion of Miss Alscrip that makes such conquests at first sight  Tiffany  Sir if you mean the young Lady who has been named however undeservedly the flower of this family that appears sometimes at these windows and to be sure has been followed home by gentlemen against her inclinationsSir you are not mistaken  Clifford  aside  It has been Gayville's madness or amusement then to describe her by contraries  Tiffany  I hope Sir you are not offended I wou'd not be impertinent tho' I am not so tasteless as to shy  Clifford  Offended my dear I am quite charm'd I assure you You are just what I did not expect but wished to find you You had been represented to me so improperly  Tiffany  with pertness  Represented improperly Pray Sir what do you mean  Clifford  To rejoice in my mistake I promise youNay and

Clement  Sir Clement  Well Clifford what do you think of her  Clifford  Make yourself perfectly easy Sir This girl when known can make no impression on Lord Gayville's mind and I doubt not but a silk gown and a lottery ticket had they been offer'd as an ultimatum wou'd have purchased her  person  Sir Clement  With a dry sneer  Don't you sometimes Clifford form erroneous opinions of peoples' pretensions Interest and foolish passion inspire strange notionsas one or the other prevails we are brought to look so low or so high  Clifford  With emotion  That we are compell'd to call reason and honour to our aid  Sir Clement  And then  Clifford  We lose the intemperance of our inclinations in the sense of what is right  Sir Clement  aside  Sententious impostor  to him  But to the point  Clifford  Sir I wou'd please you if I cou'dI am thinking of a scheme to restore Lord Gayville to his senses without violence or injury to any one of the parties  Sir Clement  Let me hear it  Clifford  Why the wench being cut short of marketing by word of mouth which she was doing in all due form when you came in desired me to write proposals I am inclined to do so We will shew the answer to Lord Gayville and depend upon it there will be character enough display'd to cure him of the sentimental part of his attachment  Sir Clement  I like your ideaSit down and put it into execution immediately  Clifford writes  Sir Clement  to himself  He is quick at inventionhas a pretty turn at professionA proud and peremptory shew of honour that wou'd overpower prejudicesThank heaven my opinions of knavery are convictions  Clifford  Writing  I am sorry to detain you Sir  Sir Clement  Looking at the furniture  Oh I am amusing myself better than you thinkIndulging an edifying contemplation among the tombs of departed estates  Looking round the furniture viz closets that shew old writings tied up shelves with boxes labelled mortgages lease and release c  What mouldered skins that will never

affection"I have not a thought of him that ought to disturb you"Fly to me secure me my dearest Henry  Lord Gayville  Dearest Henry  Sir Clement  reads on  "Dearest HenryIn this call the danger of your Harriet unites with the impatience of her affection"  Lord Gayville  Hell and fury this must be some trick some forgery  snatches the letter  No by all that's perfidious it is that exquisite hand that baffles imitation  Sir Clement  All regular strict undeviating modern moralscommon property is the first principle of friendship your horse your house your purse your mistressnay your wife wou'd be a better example still of the doctrine of this generous age Bless fortune Gayville that has brought the fidelity of your friend and your girl to the test at the same time  Lord Gayville  Sir I am not in a humour for any spleen but my own What can this mean It must have been a secret attachment for years but then the avowal of a correspondence and the confusion at receiving ithis coldness in traducing her the passionate interest he express'd in her fate the conviction of his second letterIt is all delirium I'll search the matter to the bottom tho' I go to Clifford's heart for it  Exit in great anger  Sir Clement  I'll after the precious fellow too He is a rogue above my hopes and the intricacy of his snares excite my curiosity  Exit  SCENE III  Lady Emily's Apartment  Lady Emily discover'd reading  It will not do My eyes may run over a thousand subjects but my thoughts centre in one Ah that sigh that sigh from the fair sufferer this morningI have found it echo in my own heart ever since  Enter Servant  Servant  Madam Mr Blandish  Lady Emily  Pooh did you say I was at home  Servant  Your Ladyship gave no orders to the contrary  Lady Emily  Shew him in  Exit Servant  I must take up my air of levity againIt is the  only humour for a fellow who I sometimes allow to entertain me but who never can get my esteem I have more calls upon my affectation this unlucky day than my real disposition would execute in a long life  Enter Blandish  Lady Emily  Blandish I am horridly peevish have you any thing diverting in news or flattery  Blandish  In the latter Madam nothing My admiration has all the dullness of truth but shew me what you think a flaw and I'll try without flattery to convince you it is a beauty  Lady Emily  Tolerably express'dbut the idea of a faultless woman is false in point of encomium she wou'd be respectable aweful and unattracting Odd as it may seem a woman to charm requires a little dash of harmless imperfection I know I've a thousand amiable faults that I wou'd not part with for the world So try again Something more new and refined  Blandish  Examine my heart Lady Emily and you will find both The novelty of disinterested passion and refinement acquired by the study of you  Lady Emily  Rather better but  that  does not please me much the less perhaps as it is rather out of your way and more in that of my friend your sister who I observe always put a compliment in full viewYours generally come more forcibly by affording us the pleasure of finding them outIt is the excellency of a brilliant to play in the dark  Blandish  Allow yourself to be the brilliant and attend to another allusion With trembling ambition  I confess that not content with admiring the jewel I would wear it  Lady Emily  Wear it  Blandish  As an appendage to my heartConscious of it's value proud of its display and devoted to its preservation  Lady Emily  Riddles Mr Blandishbut so let them remainI assure you this hour is very inauspicious for explanation  Blandish  I fear so For in an hour when Clifford proves treacherous who can escape suspicion  Lady Emily  Clifford for what purpose is he introduced in this conversation  Blandish  You ask'd me for intelligence the latest is that Clifford has been detected in a clandestine intercourse with the object of Lord Gayville's secret passion that he has betray'd the confidence of his friend and patron and actually carried her off  aside  Which Gayville knows by this time with all its aggravations or Prompt has not been as active as he us'd to be  Lady Emily  with emotion  Blandish this is a poor project Clifford treacherous to his friend You might as soon make me believe Gayville dispassionate my uncle charitable or you ingenuous  Blandish  His conduct does not rest upon opinion but proof and when you know it you must think of him with aversion  Lady Emily  Must I Then don't let me hear a word moreI have aversions enough already  peevishly  Blandish  It is impossible you can apply that word to one whose only offence is to adore you  kisses her hand  Enter Clifford  Clifford  aside surprized  Blandish so favour'd  Lady Emily  aside  Perverse accident what mistakes now will he make  Blandish  aside  The enemy has surprized me but the only remedy in such emergencies is to shew a good countenance  Clifford  I fear I have been guilty of an unpardonable intrusion  Blandish  Mr Clifford never can intrude but though you had not come so apropos yourself Lady Emily will bear testimony I have not spared my pains to remove any prejudices she might have entertained  Lady Emily  Had you not better repeat in your own words Mr Blandish all the obliging things you have said of this gentleman  Clifford  It is not necessary MadamIf without robbing you of moments that I perceive are precious  Lady Emily  Sir  Clifford  I might obtain a short audience  looking at Blandish  Blandish  aside  He's devilish impudentbut he cannot soon get over facts and I'll take care the conference shall not be long  To Lady Emily  Lady Emily hear Mr Clifford and judge if I have misrepresented him  to Clifford  When you want a friend you know where to find him  Exit  Lady Emily  This is an interview Mr Clifford that I desire not to be understood to have authorised It is not to  me  you are accountable for your actionsI have no personal interest in them  Clifford  I know it too well  Lady Emily  peevishly  Do not run away with the notion neither that I am therefore interested in any  other  person's You have among you vex'd and disconcerted me but there is not a grain of partiality in all my embarrassmentif you have any eyes you may see there is not  Clifford  Happy Blandish your triumph is evident  Lady Emily  Blandish the odious creature He is my abhorrence You are hardly worse yourself in my bad opinion tho' you have done so much more to deserve it  Clifford  How cruel are the circumstances that compel me to leave you under these impressions nay moreat such a time to urge a request that during your most favourable thoughts of me wou'd have appear'd strange if not presumptuous This is the key of my apartment It contains a secret that the exigency of the hour oblig'd me against inclination or propriety to lodge there Should Sir Clement return before me I implore you to prevent his discovery and give to what you find within your confidence and protection Lord Gayvillebut I shall go too farthe most anxious event of my life presses on me I conjure you to comply by all the compassion and tenderness nature has treasured in your heartnot for mebut for occasions worthy their display  Gives the key which she receives with some reluctance  and Exit  Lady Emily  Heigho Its well he's gone without insisting on my answer I was in a sad flutter of indecision What mysterious means he takes to engage me in a confidence which I could not directly acceptI am to find a letter I  the story of his heartIts errors and defenceMy brother's name alsoto furnish me with a new interest in the secret and one I might avowOne may dislike this art but must be sensible of his delicacyAh when those two qualities unite in a man I am afraid he is an overmatch for the wisest of usHark sure that is the sound of my Uncle's coach  looks out of the window  'Tis heand now for the secretCuriosityCuriosity innate irresistible principle in womankind be my excuse before I dare question my mind upon other motives  Exit  SCENE IV  Another apartment  Enter Lady Emily  Oh lud I cou'd hardly tremble more at opening this man's apartment were there a possibility of finding  him  within side How do people find courage to do a wrong thing when an innocent discovery cannot be prosecuted without such timidity  Approaches the door timidly and unlocks it  Enter Miss Alton  Lady Emily  Amazement Miss Alton what brought you here  Miss Alton  Madam I was brought here for an hour's concealment who I really am I wou'd not if possible to avoid it divulge in this house When you saw me last you honour'd me with a favourable opinionMy story not explained at full might subject me to doubts that wou'd  shake your candour The circumstances in which I am involved are strange and have succeeded with the rapidity and confusion of a dream Suffer me to recover for a moment my disorder'd spirits and I  will  satisfy you farther  Lady Emily  What shall I doShe is pale and ready to faintI cannot let her be exposed in such a situationRetireYou may rely upon me for present securityYou know best your pretensions to my future opinion  hearing Sir Clement  begone or you are discover'd  shuts her in and locks Clifford's door  Enter Sir Clement  Sir Clement  Oh the triumph of honour Oh the sincerity of friendship how my opinions are ratifiedhow my system is proved  Lady Emily  Oh spirits spirits forsake me notoh for a moment's dissimulation  Sir Clement  There are some now who wou'd feed moroseness and misanthropy with such events to me they give delight as convictions and warnings to mankind  Lady Emily  Of how superior a quality my good Uncle must be to the benevolence you possess it rises with the progress of mischief and is gratified upon principles of general good by finding confidence abused and esteem misplaced Am I not right in attributing your joy at present so that sort of refinement  Sir Clement  Hah and to what sensations my good niece shall be attributed the present state of your spirits To the disgust you took to Clifford almost at first sight It will not be with indifference but pleasure you will hear of his turning  out the veriest rascal the most compleat impostor the most abandon'd but hold holdI must not wrong him by superlativeshe is match'd too  Lady Emily  ReallyI congratulate you upon such a check of charity  Sir Clement  And I wish you joy my pretty pert one upon the credit your sex has acquired in producing this other Chefd'ouvreSuch a composition of the highest vices and the lowest  Lady Emily  I know it will be in vain to oppose the pleasure you take in colouring by my want of taste to enjoy it but you may spare your preparatory shading and come to the points with which I am not acquainted  Sir Clement  And pray my  incurious  niece with what points  are  you acquainted  Lady Emily  That before Mr Clifford went abroad it is suspected his passions betray'd him into a fault that must be shocking to your morality and that I'm sure it is not my intention to justify He ought to have resisted It's a shame we have not more examples of young men correcting the frailties of womankindI dare say he neglected a fair opportunity of becoming a prodigy  Sir Clement  I protest you have a pretty way of dressing up an apology for the venial faults of youthand it comes with a peculiar grace from a delicate lady of twenty  Lady Emily  Come Sir no more of your sarcasms I can treat wrong actions with levity and yet consider them with detestation Prudes and pretenders condemn with austerity To the collection of suspicions you are master of let me add oneIn a young lady of the delicacyand  age you have described always suspect the virtue that does not wear a smile  Sir Clement  And the sincerity that wears one aukwardlyIf you wou'd know the history of Clifford ask but your brother if of the precious adventurer he has carried off enquire of Miss AlscripWe shall come up with her yetwoe be to any one who harbours her  Enter Prompt hastily  Prompt  Joy to your honour I see you have caught her  Sir Clement  Herwho  Prompt  Lady Emily turning  I ask your ladyship's pardonHaving only the glimpse of a petticoat and knowing the object of my chase was in this house I confess I mistook you  Sir Clement  In this house  Prompt  As sure as we areShe came in thorough the garden under Mr Clifford's arm up the other stairs I supposeIf my lady had been hereaboutsshe must have seen her  Lady Emily  in confusion  Yes but unluckily I was quite out of the way  Sir Clement  Such audaciousness passes credibilityEmily what do you think of him  Lady Emily  That he is a monster  aside  How my dilemmas multiply  Sir Clement  What to my house to his apartment here I wonder he did not ask for protection in your's What should you have said  Lady Emily  I don't know but had I been so imposed upon as to receive her I should scorn to betray even the criminal I had engaged to protect  Sir Clement  tries at the door finds it lock'd  Emily my dear do ring the bell to know if the housekeeper has a second key to this lock  Lady Emily  What shall I do  Prompt  She is certainly there Sir and cannot escape Where can she better remain till you can assemble all parties confront them face to face and bring every thing that has pass'd to a full explanation  Sir Clement  With all my heart send and collect every body concerned as fast as possible How I long for so complicated an exhibition of the purity of the human heartCome with me Emily and help to digest my planFriends and lovers what a scene shall we shew you  Takes Lady Emily under the arm  Exeunt  End of the Fourth Act  ACT V  SCENE I  Enter Clifford and Mr Rightly  Clifford  YOUR knowledge in the profession Mr Rightly is as questionless as your integrity but there is something so surprizing in the discovery of the Charlton estate  Rightly  It is so strange that I will not pronounce a positive opinion till I have read again the collateral papers and consider'd fully the descents in your family Your grandfather I think was deceived in supposing he had a right to sell that part of the Charlton estate which Alscrip proposes for his daughter's portion The strength of this old settlement must have escaped my brother lawyer or he was mad when he put it into my hands  Clifford  If you knew too how the value of the acquisition is enhanced by the opportune moment in which it presents itselfI am in too much emotion to thank you as I ought  Rightly  Sir I want neither compliment nor acknowledgement for revealing what I should be a party to dishonesty to concealbut that duty done wou'd it be an abuse of benevolence unworthy as some of the parties may be to preserve the peace of all concerned  Clifford  In what manner  Rightly  Sir Clement Flint will renounce the Alscrip alliance at the first appearance of this defalcation and if I am well informed Lord  Gayville will not lament the loss of his intended bride The young lady is therefore free and still possessed of a great inheritance  Clifford  I do not yet perceive what you aim at  Rightly  She has the faults that wealth and a false education create but they are not incurable Marry her yourself By sinking the claim in the union with his family you command the father's approbation and the daughter must be of a strange mould indeed if the same obligation does not become a corrective of her pride and an excitement to her gratitude  smiling  I give some token of my friendship when as a lawyer I propose you a wife instead of a suit in chancery  Clifford  I feel all the kindness of your suggestion but if my claim is precarious it is as repugnant to my delicacy as to my inclination to realize it upon such terms if it is substantial I have such a disposition to makeyou have a right to all my thoughts but I have an appointment to obey that admits no time for explanation favor me for a moment with your pencil  Rightly takes out a pencil and pocketbook  And a blank page in that memorandum book  Clifford writes  Rightly  My life on't his head is turn'd upon some girl not worth a shillingThere is an amiable defect but a very observable one in the nature of some men A good head and heart operate as effectually as vice or folly could do to make them improvident  Clifford  Mr Rightly I confide to your hands a new secret relative to the Charlton estate do not read it till you return home  gives the book aside  and going  There Gayville is one reply to your challengeand now for another  Rightly  One moment SirI engage for no secrecy that my own judgment shall not warrant  Clifford  And the benevolence of your heart approveThose are my conditions  Exeunt on opposite sides  SCENE II  HydePark  Enter Lord Gayville impetuously looking at his watch  Not here I am sure I marked the hour as well as the place precisely in my note  walks about  Had I been told three days ago that I should have been the appellant in a premeditated duel I should have thought it an insult upon my principlesThat Clifford should be the cause of my transgressing the legal and sacred duties we have ever both maintainedoh it would have seemed a visionary impossibilityBut he comes to cut reflection short  Enter Clifford  Lord Gayville  I waited for you Sir  Clifford  Bows in silence  Lord Gayville  That ceremonial would grace an encounter of punctilio but applies ill to the terms upon which I have call'd you here  Clifford  What terms are those my Lord  Lord Gayville  Vengeance Ample final vengeance Draw Sir  Clifford  No my Lord my sword is reserved for more becoming purposes It is not the instrument of passion and has yet been untried in a dispute with my friend  Lord Gayville  But why is it not ready for a different trial the vindication of perfidy the blackest species of perfidy that ever the malignant enemy of mankind infused into the human breastperfidy to the friend who loved and trusted you and in the nearest interests of his heart  Clifford  Take care my Lord should my blood boil like your's and it is rising fast you know not the punishment that awaits you I came temperate your gross provocation and thirst of blood make temperance appear disgraceI am tempted to take a revenge  Lord Gayville  Draws  The means are ready Come Sir you are to give an example of qualities generally held incompatible bravery and dishonour  Clifford  Another such word and by heaven How have I deserv'd this opinion  Lord Gayville  Ask your conscienceUnder the mask of friendship you have held a secret intercourse with the woman I adore you have supplanted me in her affections you have robb'd me of the very charm of my lifecan you deny it  Clifford  I avow it all  Lord Gayville  Unparalleled insolence of guilt  Clifford  Are you sure there is nothing within the scope of possibility that wou'd excuse or atone  Lord Gayville  DeathDeath onlyno abject submissionno compromise for infamy chuse instantlyand save yourself from the only stretch of baseness leftthe invention of a falsehood to palliate  Clifford  In the utmost agitation and drawing his sword  FalsehoodYou shall have no other explanation  After a struggle within himself Clifford drops the point and exposes his breast  Lord Gavyville  Stand upon your defence Sir What do you mean  Clifford  You said nothing but my life wou'd satisfy you take it and remember me  Lord Gayville  I say so stillbut upon an equal pledgeI am no assassin  Clifford  with great emotion  If to strike at the heart of your friend more deeply than that poor instrument in your hand could do makes an assassin you have been one already  Lord Gayville  That look that tone how like to innocence Had he not avow'd such abominable practices  Clifford  I avow them again I have rival'd you in the love of the woman you adoreher affections are rivetted to me I have removed her from your sight secured her from your recovery  Lord Gayville  Damnation  Clifford  I have done it to save unguarded beauty to save unprotected innocence to save a sister  Lord Gayville  A sister  Clifford  With exultation  Vengeance Ample final vengeance  a pause  It is accomplish'd over himand over myselfmy victory is compleat  Lord Gayville  Where shall I hide my shame  Clifford  We'll share it and forget it here  Embraces  Lord Gayville  Why did you keep the secret from me  Clifford  I knew it not myself till the strange concurrence of circumstances to which you were in part witness a few hours since brought it to light I meant to impart to you the discovery  when my temper took fireLet us bury our mutual errors in the thought that we now for life are friends  Lord Gayville  Brothers CliffordLet us interchange that title and doubly doubly ratify it Unite me to your charming sister accept the hand of Lady Emily in returnher heart I have discover'd to be yoursWe'll leave the world to the sordid and the tasteless let an Alscrip or a Sir Clement Flint wander after the fantom of happiness we shall find her real retreat and hold her by the bonds she covets virtue love and friendship  Clifford  Not a word more my lord the bars against your proposal are insuperable  Lord Gayville  What bars  Clifford  Honour proprietyand pride  Lord Gayville  Pride Clifford  Clifford  Yes my Lord Harriet Clifford shall not  steal  the hand of a prince nor will  I  tho' doating on Lady Emily with a passion like your own bear the idea of a clandestine union in a family to whom I am bound by obligation and trust Indeed my lord without Sir Clement's consent you must think no more of my sister  Lord Gayville  Stern Stoic but I  will  and  not  clandestinely I'll instantly to Sir Clement  Clifford  Do not be rashFortune or some better agent is working in wondersMeet me presently at your Uncle's in the mean while promise not to stir in this business  Lord Gayville  What hope from delay  Clifford  Promise  Lord Gayville  I am in a state to catch at shadowsI'll try to obey you  Clifford  Farewel  Exeunt  SCENE III  Sir Clement's house  Enter Miss Alscrip in great spirits followed by Mrs Blandish  Miss Alscrip  I am delighted at this summons from Sir Clement Blandish poor  old clearsight  I hope he has projected a reconciliation  Mrs Blandish  How I rejoice to see those smiles returned to the face that was made for them  Miss Alscrip  Return'd Blandish I desire you will not insinuate it ever was without them Why sure you would not have the world imagine the temper of an Heiress of my class was to be ruffled by the loss of a paltry earlI have been highly diverted with what has passed from beginning to end  Mrs Blandish  Well if good humour can be a fault sure the excess you carry it to must be the example  Miss Alscrip  I desire it may be made known in all companies that I have done nothing but laugh nay it is true too  Mrs Blandish  My dear creature of what consequence is the truth when you are charging me with the execution of your desires  Miss Alscrip  Could any thing be more diverting than my Lord's intriguing with my  chambermaid  before marriage that must be your cue  Mrs Blandish  Excellent  Miss Alscrip  The design was in rule and founded upon the best precedentsonly the time in the newspaper phrase was premature he he he  Mrs Blandish  He he he  Miss Alscrip  And then the airs of the moppet Could any thing be more ridiculous  Mrs Blandish  The rivalship you meanRival Miss AlscripHe he he  Half laugh  Miss Alscrip  Yes but when you take this tone in public laugh a little louder  Mrs Blandish  Rival Miss Alscrip ha ha ha  Both  Ha ha ha ha ha ha  Mrs Blandish  wiping her eyes as not quite recovered from her laugh  For mirth's sake what is become of the rival Who will you chuse she shall have run away with  Miss Alscrip  Leave it in doubt as it is fixing circumstances confines the curiosity to one story which may be disproved uncertainty leaves it open to an hundred and makes them all probable But I hear some of the company upon the stairs Now BlandishYou shall be witness to the temper and dignity with which a woman of my consequence can discard a quality courtship that offends herHaving sufficiently mortified the Uncle and Nephew with a triumphant raillery all my own I shall request Lady Emily to set the Paphian mimp upon the family disappointment and leave them together to the exercise of the patience that usually attends the loss of a hundred thousand pounds  Mrs Blandish  Sweet temper'd soul  Enter Sir Clement Flint  Sir Clement  Miss Alscrip your  As he's beginning to say your humble servant  Enter Blandish out of breath  Blandish  The duel's over and the combatants in whole skins Never ran so fast since I was born  Sir Clement  To be too late by some minutes in your intelligence I know you feel the disappointment from the sincere affection you bear all parties  Miss Alscrip  DuelPray let us hear the particularsAs there is no mischief I shall not faint  Ironically  Sir Clement  I guess it has been of the common place kindHats over the browsglum silence thrust parryand riposte Explain and shake hands Your man of honour never sets his friend right till he has exchang'd a shotor a thrust Oh a little essence of steel or gunpowder is a morning whet to the temper It carries off all qualms and leaves the digestion free for any thing that is presented to it  Miss Alscrip  Dear how fortunate Considering the pills some folks have to swallow  Sir Clement  Blandish see if the door of Clifford's room is yet unlocked there is a person within you little expect to find and that it may be proper for this lady and me to interrogate together I don't know what to call herInexplicability in petticoats    The door opens    and  Enter Lady Emily  Blandish  Lady Emily  Sir Clement  Inexplicable with a vengeance  Miss Alscrip  aside  Lady Emily shut up in Clifford's apartment Beyond my expectation indeed  With a malicious air  Lady Emily seems pleased  Sir Clement  dryly  Lady Emily I know you were always cautious whom you visited and never gave a better proof of your discernment  Lady Emily  Neveroh my poor dear uncle you little think what is going to befall you  Sir Clement  Not a disappointment in love I hope  Lady Emily  No but in something much nearer your heartyour system is threaten'd with a blow that I think and from my soul I hope it never will recover would you guess that the sagacious observations of your whole life are upon the point of being confounded by the production  Sir Clement  Of what  Lady Emily  A woman of ingenuous discretion and a man of unaffected intregrity  Sir Clement  Hah  Mrs Blandish  What can she mean  Miss Alscrip  Nothing goodshe looks so pleasant  Lady Emily  Come forth my injur'd friend Our personal acquaintance has been short but our hearts were intimate from the first sight  presenting her  Your prisoner Sir is Miss Harriot Clifford  Sir Clement  Clifford's sister  Miss Alscrip  What the runaway Alton turned into a sprig of quality  Lady Emily  disdainfully to Miss Alscrip  The humble dependant of Alscrip's houseThe wantonthe paragon of fraudthe only female that can equal Clifford  tauntingly to Sir Clement  She  is  indeed  with emphasis and affection  Blandish  aside  Oh rot the source of the family fondnessI see I have no card left in my favourbut the Heiress  Goes to her and pays court  During this conversation aside Lady  Emily seems encouraging Miss CliffordSir Clement musing and by turns examining her  Sir Clement  to himself  "Ingenuous discretion"  Enter Clifford  and runs to his sister  Clifford  My dearest Harriot the joy I purposed in presenting you here is anticipated but my blameless fugitive relate the tale of your distresses and my pride in you will not be a wonder  Miss Clifford  They have been shortand are overpaid by your indulgence Insulted by the family I liv'd with made more wretched by a detested pursuit which my uncle's violence enforc'd and confident of your being returned I fled to London for an asylum  Sir Clement  Which has been admirably chosen in my house  Clifford  Sir I really think so Lady Emily's generosity your justice and my sister's honour make it sacred  While Clifford is speaking  Enter Lord Gayville  starts at seeing Miss Clifford  Sir Clement  perceiving Lord Gayville  And peculiarly secure against the visits of  this deteste  pursuer  Lord Gayville  with rapture  Her persecutor and her convert Her virtues which no humility could conceal and every trial made more resplendant discover'd disgraced and reclaimed a libertine  Miss Clifford  How am I distress'dwhat ought I to answer  Lord Gayville  Impressed sentiment upon desire gave honour to passion and drew from my  soul a vow which heaven chastise me when I violate to obtain her by a legal sacred claim or renounce fortune family and friends and become a selfdevoted outcast of the world  Miss Clifford  Oh brother interpose  Sir Clement  My Lord your fortune family and friends are much oblig'd to you Your part is perfectMr Clifford you are call'd upon Miss in strict propriety throws the business upon her relationsCome finish the comedy join one of her hands to the gallants while with the other she covers her blushesand he in rapture delivers the moral All for Love or the World well Lost  Miss Clifford still appears agitated  Clifford  Be patient my Harriot this is the school for prejudice and the lesson of its shame is near  Miss Alscrip  I vow these singular circumstances give me quite a confusion of pleasure The astonishing good fortune of my late ProtegÃ©e in finding so impassion'd a friendship in her brother's bedchamber the captivating eloquence of Lord Gayville in winding up an eclaircissement which I admirenot for the first timeto dayand the superlative joy Sir Clement must feel at an union  ounded upon the purity of the passions are subjects of such different congratulation that I hardly know where to begin  Lady Emily  aside  Charmingher insolence will justify what so seldom occurs to onea severe retort without a possible sense of compunction  Miss Alscrip  But in point of fortunedon't imagine Sir Clement I wou'd insinuate that the Lady is destituteoh Lord far from it Her  musical talents are a portionI can't say I have yet seen a countess open a concert for her own benefit but there can be no reason why a woman of the first quality should not be directress of the OperaIndeed after all that has happen'd it is the best chance I see for a good administration there  Alscrip and Rightly  without  Alscrip  Why stop a momentMr Rightly 'Death after chasing you all over the town don't be so impatient the instant I overtake you  Sir Clement  What have we herethe lawyers in dispute  Alscrip  entering  You have not heard my last word yet  Rightly  entering  You have heard mine Sir  Alscrip  whispering  I'll make the five thousand I offer'd ten  Rightly  Millions wou'd not bribe me  coming forward  When I detect wrong and vindicate the sufferer I feel the spirit of the Law of England and the pride of a practitioner  Alscrip  Lucifer confound such practices  In this part of the scene Sir Clement Lord Gayville Lady Emily Clifford and Miss Clifford form one groupe  Rightly opens a deed and points out a part of it to Sir Clement  Mr and Miss Alscrip carry on the following speeches on the side at which Alscrip has enter'd And Mr and Mrs Blandish are farther back observing  Alscrip  That cursed cursed flaw  Miss Alscrip  Flaw who has dared to talk of one not in my reputation Sir  Alscrip  No but in my estate which is a damn'd deal worse  Miss Alscrip  How whatwhenwhere The estate that was to be settled upon me  Alscrip  Yes but that  me  turn'd topsy turvey when  me  broke into my room this morning and the devil followed to fly away with all my faculties at onceI am ruin'dLet us see what you will settle upon your poor father  Miss Alscrip  I settle upon  you  Mrs Blandish  This is an embarrassing accident  Miss Alscrip  Yes and a pretty help you are with a drop chin like a frontispiece to the lamentations  Rightly  coming forward with Sir Clement  I stated this with some doubt this morning but now my credit as a lawyer upon the issueThe Heiress falls short of the terms in your treaty by two thousand pounds a yearwhich this deed lately and providentially discover'd entails upon the heirs of Sir William Charlton and consequently in right of his mother upon this gentleman  Lady Emily  How  Lord Gayville  Happy disappointment  Sir Clement  aside  Two thousand a year to Clifford It's pity for the parade of disinterestedness that he open'd his designs upon Emily before he knew his pretensions  Lady Emily  aside  Now if there were twenty ceilings and as many floors could not I find a spot to settle my silly looks upon  Sir Clement observes her with his usual shyness  Then turning towards Alscrip  Palm a false title upon  me  I shou'd have thought the attempt beyond the collective assurance of Westminsterhalland he takes the loss as much to heart as if he bought the estate with his own money  Alscrip  with hesitation  Sir Clement what think youof an amicable adjustment of all these businesses  Sir Clement  ironically  Nothing can be more reasonable The value of Miss Alscrip's amiable disposition placed against the abatement of her fortune is a matter of the most easy computation and to decide the portion Mr Clifford ought to relinquish of his acquisition Lady Emilywill you be a referÃ©e  Lady Emily  aside  Yes the Lynx has meI thought I should not escape  to him  No Sir my poor abilities only extend to an amicable endeavour here  to Miss Alscrip  And really Miss Alscrip I see no reason for your being dispirited there may be many ready made titles at market within the reach of your purse Or why should not a woman of your consequence originate her own splendour there's an old admirer of mineHe wou'd make a very pretty lordand indeed wou'd contribute something on his own part to ease the purchaseThe Blandish family is well with all administrations and a new coronet is always as big again as an old one I don't see how you cou'd lay out part of your independency to more advantage  Blandish  aside  Yes but since flaws are in fashion I shall look a little into things before I agree to the bargain  Lady Emily  And if you replace this part of your family  pointing to Miss Clifford  by making an humble companion of your old gentleman I protest I do not see any great alteration in your affairs  Miss Alscrip  aside  I'll die before I'll discover my vexationand yet  half crying  no titleno place  Lady Emily  Depend upon it Miss Alscrip your place will be found exactly where it ought to be The public eye in this country is never long deceiv'd Believe meand cherish obscurityTitle may bring forward merits but it also places our defects in horrid relief  Miss Clifford  You seem to expect something from me Miss AlscripBe in no pain for any thing that has pass'd between usMy pity has entirely overpower'd my resentment  Alscrip  Molly the sooner we get out of court the betterwe have damnably the worst of this cause so come along Molly  taking her under the arm  and farewel to Berkleysquare Whoever wants Alscrip's house will find it in the neighbourhood of Furnival'sInn with the noble title of Scrivener in capitals Blank bonds at the windows and a brass knocker at the door  pulling her  Come along Molly  Miss Alscrip  half crying  aside  Oh the barbarous metamorphosisbut his  flusterums  for a week will serve my temper as a regimen I will then take the management of my affairs into my own hands and break from my cloud anew and you shall find  to the company  there are those without a coronet that can be as saucy and as loud and stop the way in all public places as well as the  best of you  Lady Emily laughs  Yes Madam and without borrowing your Ladyship's airs  Alscrip  pulling her  Come along Molly  Miss Alscrip  Oh you have been a jewel of a father  The company laugh  Exeunt Mr and Miss Alscrip  Mr and Mrs Blandish stay behind  Blandish  aside  What a cursed turn things have taken My schemes evaporate like inflammable air and down drops poor adventurer  Lady Emily  Mrs Blandish sure you do not leave your friend Miss Alscrip in distress  Mrs Blandish  We'll not disturb the ashes of the deadmy sweet Lady Emily  Blandish  None of your flourishes my dear sister they already think you a walking dedication When we can't escape a situation the only way is to brave itSo let them tell us we are sycophants be it sothen we are the best friends society has Flattery is the diet of good humour and not one of you can live without it and when you quarrel with the family of Blandish you leave refin'd cookery to be fed upon scraps by a poor cousin or a led captain  taking his sister under his arm  Mrs Blandish  as she goes off  Oh the two charming pair  Exit with Blandish  Lord Gayville  Precious groupe fare ye well  to Sir Clement  And now Sir whatever may be your determinations towards mehere are pretensions you may patronize without breach of discretion The estate which devolves to my friend  Rightly  To prevent errors is not his to bestow  Sir Clement  What nowmore flaws  Rightly  The estate was his beyond the reach of controversy but before he was truly sure of it on his way to HydePark did this spendthrift by a stroke of his pen divest himself of every shillingHere is the covenant by which he binds himself to execute proper conveyances as soon as the necessary forms can be gone through  Lord Gayville  And in favour of whom is this desperate act  Rightly  Of a most dangerous seducera little mercenary that when she gets hold of the heart does not leave an atom of it our own  All  How  Rightly  with feeling  And there she stands  pointing to Miss Clifford  with a look and an emotion that wou' d condemn her before any court in the universe  Lady Emily  Gloriousmatchless Clifford  Miss Clifford  Brother this must not be  Clifford  Your pardon my dear Harriet it is done Sir Clement my sister's fortune is still far short of what you expected with Miss Alscrip for that deficiency I have only to offer the virtues Lord Gayville has proved and the affection she found it easier to control than to coneeal If you will receive her thus circumstanced into your family mine has been an acquisition indeed  Lady Emily  Coming up to Sir Clement  Now Sir where's suspicion Where is now the ruling principle that governs mankind Thro' what perspective by what trial will you find selfinterest here What not one pithy word to mock my credulityAlas poor Yorickquite chopfallen Forgive me Sir I own I am agitated to extravaganceYou thought me disconcerted at the  first discovery I am delighted at the last there's a problem in my disposition worthy your solving  Sir Clement  Who has been profoundly thought full  Mr Rightly favour me with that paper in your hand  Rightly  Mr Clifford's engagement Sir  Gives the paper Sir Clement looks it over and tears it  What do you mean Sir  Sir Clement  To cancel the obligation and pay the equivalent to Gayville or if Clifford will have his own way and become a beggar by renewing it to make an heiress of my own for his reparation and there  she  stands  pointing to Lady Emily  With sensibility and vivacity so uncommonly blended that they extract benevolence where ever it exists and create it where it never was beforeYour point is carriedYou may both fall upon your knees for the consent of ladies  Lord Gayville  to Miss Clifford  In this happy moment let my errors be forgot and my love alone remember'd  Miss Clifford  With these sanctions for my avowalI will not deny that I saw and felt the sincerity of your attachment from the time it was capable of being restrained by respect  Clifford  Words are wanting Lady Emily  Lady Emily  I wish they may with all my heart but it is generally remarked that wanting words is the beginning of a florid set speechTo be serious CliffordWe want but little explanation on either sideSir Clement will tell you how long we have conversed by our actions  Gives her hand  My dear Uncle how a smile becomes you in its natural meaning  Sir Clement  If you think me a convert you are mistaken I have ever believ'd  self  to be the predominant  principle of the human mindMy heart at this instant confirms the doctrineThere's my problem for yours my dear Emily and may all who hear me agree in this solutionto reward the deserving and make those
