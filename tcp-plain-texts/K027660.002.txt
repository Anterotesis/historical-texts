 A SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY c c  A SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY THROUGH FRANCE AND ITALY  BY MR YORICK  VOL II  LONDON Printed for T BECKET and P A DE HONDT in the Strand MDCCLXVIII  THE FILLE DE CHAMBRE  PARIS  WHAT the old French officer had deliver'd upon travelling bringing Polonius's advice to his son upon the same subject into my headand that bringing in Hamlet and Hamlet the rest of Shakespear's works I stopp'd at the Quai de Conti in my return home to purchase the whole set  The bookseller said he had not a set in the world  Comment  said I taking one up out of a set which lay upon the counter betwixt usHe said they were sent him only to be got bound and were to be sent back to Versailles in the morning to the Count de B****  And does the Count de B**** said I read Shakespear  C'est un Esprit fort  replied the booksellerHe loves English books and what is more to his honour Monsieur he love the English too You speak this so civilly said I that 'tis enough to oblige an Englishman to lay out a Louis d'or or two at your shopthe bookseller made a bow and was  going to say something when a young decent girl of about twenty who by her air and dress seemed to be  fille de chambre  to some devout woman of fashion came into the shop and asked for  Les Egarments du Coeur de l'Esprit  the bookseller gave her the book directly she pulled out a little green sattin purse run round with a ribband of the same colour and putting her finger and thumb into it she took out the money and paid for it As I had nothing more to stay me in the shop we both walked out at the door together  And what have you to do my dear said I with  The Wanderings of the Heart  who scarce know yet you have one nor till love has  first told you it or some faithless shepherd has made it ache can'st thou ever be sure it is so  Le Dieu m'en guard  said the girlWith reason said Ifor if is a good one 'tis pity it should be stolen 'tis a little treasure to thee and gives a better air to your face than if it was dress'd out with pearls  The young girl listened with a submissive attention holding her sattin purse by its ribband in her hand all the time'Tis a very small one said I taking hold of the bottom of itshe held it towards meand there is very little in it my dear said I but be but as good as thou art handsome and heaven will fill it I had a  parcel of crowns in my hand to pay for Shakespear and as she had let go the purse intirely I put a single one in and tying up the ribband in a bowknot returned it to her  The young girl made me more a humble courtesy than a low one'twas one one of those quiet thankful sinkings where the spirit bows itself downthe body does no more than tell it I never gave a girl a crown in my life which gave me half the pleasure  My advice my dear would not have been worth a pin to you said I if I had not given this along with it but now when you see the crown  you'll remember itso don't my dear lay it out in ribbands  Upon my word Sir said the girl earnestly I am incapablein saying which as is usual in little bargains of honour she gave me her hand  En verite Monsieur je mettrai cet argent apart  said she  When a virtuous convention is made betwixt man and woman it sanctifies their most private walks so notwithstanding it was dusky yet as both our roads lay the same way we made no scruple of walking along the Quai de Conti together  She made me a second courtesy in setting off and before we got twenty yards from the door as if she had not done enough before she made a sort of a little stop to tell me againshe thank'd me  It was a small tribute I told her which I could not avoid paying to virtue and would not be mistaken in the person I had been rendering it to for the worldbut I see innocence my dear in your faceand foul befal the man who ever lays a snare in its way  The girl seem'd affected some way or other with what I saidshe gave a low sighI found I was not impowered  to enquire at all after itso said nothing more till I got to the corner of the Rue de Nevers where we were to part  But is this the way my dear said I to the hotel de Modene she told me it wasor that I might go by the Rue de Guineygaude which was the next turnThen I'll go my dear by the Rue de Guineygaude said I for two reasons first I shall please myself and next I shall give you the protection of my company as far on your way as I can The girl was sensible I was civiland said she wish'd the hotel de Modene was in the Rue de St PierreYou live there said IShe told me she was  fille de chambre  to Madame  R****Good God said I 'tis the very lady for whom I have brought a letter from AmiensThe girl told me that Madame R**** she believed expected a stranger with a letter and was impatient to see himso I desired the girl to present my compliments to Madame R**** and say I would certainly wait upon her in the morning  We stood still at the corner of the Rue de Nevers whilst this pass'dWe then stopp'd a moment whilst she disposed of her  Egarments de Coeur  c more commodiously than carrying them in her handthey were two volumes so I held the second for her whilst she put the first into her pocket and then  she held her pocket and I put in the other after it  'Tis sweet to feel by what finespun threads our affections are drawn together  We set off afresh and as she took her third step the girl put her hand within my armI was just bidding herbut she did it of herself with that undeliberating simplicity which shew'd it was out of her head that she had never seen me before For my own part I felt the conviction of consanguinity so strongly that I could not help turning half round to look in her face and see if I could trace out  any thing in it of a family likenessTut said I are we not all relations  When we arrived at the turning up of the Rue de Guineygaude I stopp'd to bid her adieu for good an all the girl would thank me again for my company and kindnessShe bid me adieu twiceI repeated it as often and so cordial was the parting between us that had it happen'd any where else I'm not sure but I should have signed it with a kiss of charity as warm and holy as an apostle  But in Paris as none kiss each other but the menI did what amounted to the same thing  I bid God bless her  THE PASSPORT  PARIS  WHEN I got home to my hotel La Fleur told me I had been enquired after by the Lieutenant de PoliceThe duce take it said II know the reason It is time the reader should know it for in the order of things in which it happened it was omitted not that it was out of my head but that had I told it then it might have been forgot nowand now is the time I want it  I had left London with so much precipitation that it never enter'd my  mind that we were at war with France and had reach'd Dover and look'd through my glass at the hills beyond Boulogne before the idea presented itself and with this in its train that there was no getting there without a passport Go but to the end of a street I have a mortal aversion for returning back no wiser than I sat out and as this was one of the greatest efforts I had ever made for knowledge I could less bear the thoughts of it so hearing the Count de **** had hired the packet I begg'd he would take me in his  suite  The Count had some little knowledge of me so made little or no difficultyonly said his inclination to serve me could reach no further than Calais  as he was to return by way of Brussels to Paris however when I had once pass'd there I might get to Paris without interruption but that in Paris I must make friends and shift for myselfLet me get to Paris Monsieur le Count said Iand I shall do very well So I embark'd and never thought more of the matter  When Le Fleur told me the Lieutenant de Police had been enquiring after methe thing instantly recurredand by the time Le Fleur had well told me the master of the hotel came into my room to tell me the same thing with this addition to it that my passport had been particularly  ask'd after the master of the hotel concluded with saying He hoped I had oneNot I faith said I  The master of the hotel retired three steps from me as from an infected person as I declared thisand poor Le Fleur advanced three steps towards me and with that sort of movement which a good soul makes to succour a distress'd onethe fellow won my heart by it and from that single  trait  I knew his character as perfectly and could rely upon it as firmly as if he had served me with fidelity for seven years  Mon seignior cried the master of the hotelbut recollecting himself as he made the exclamation he instantly changed the tone of itIf Monsieur said he has not a passport  apparament  in all likelihood he has friends in Paris who can procure him oneNot that I know of quoth I with an air of indifferenceThen  certes  replied he you'll be sent to the Bastile or the Chatelet  au moins  Poo said I the king of France is a good natured soulhe'll hurt no body  Cela n'empeche pas  said heyou will certainly be sent to the Bastile tomorrow morningBut I've taken your lodgings for a month answer'd I and I'll not quit them a day before the time for all the kings of France in the  world La Fleur whisper'd in my ear That no body could oppose the king of France  Pardi  said my host  ces Messieurs Anglois sont des gens tres extraordinaires  and having both said and sworn ithe went out  THE PASSPORT  The Hotel at Paris  I COULD not find in my heart to torture La Fleur's with a serious look upon the subject of my embarrassment which was the reason I had treated it so cavalierly and to shew him how light it lay upon my mind I dropt the subject entirely and whilst he waited upon me at supper talk'd to him with more than usual gaiety about Paris and of the opera comiqueLa Fleur had been there himself and had followed me through the streets as far as the bookseller's shop but seeing me come  out with the young  fille de chambre  and that we walk'd down the Quai de Conti together La Fleur deem'd it unnecessary to follow me a step furtherso making his own reflections upon it he took a shorter cutand got to the hotel in time to be inform'd of the affair of the Police against my arrival  As soon as the honest creature had taken away and gone down to sup himself I then began to think a little seriously about my situation  And here I know Eugenius thou wilt smile at the remembrance of a short dialogue which pass'd betwixt  us the moment I was going to set outI must tell it here  Eugenius knowing that I was as little subject to be overburthen'd with money as thought had drawn me aside to interrogate me how much I had taken care for upon telling him the exact sum Eugenius shook his head and said it would not do so pull'd out his purse in order to empty it into mineI've enough in conscience Eugenius said IIndeed Yorick you have not replied EugeniusI know France and Italy better than youBut you don't consider Eugenius said I refusing his offer that before I have been three days in Paris I shall take care  to say or do something or other for which I shall get clapp'd up into the Bastile and that I shall live there a couple of months entirely at the king of France's expenceI beg pardon said Eugenius drily really I had forgot that resource  Now the event I treated gaily came seriously to my door  Is it folly or nonchalance or philosophy or pertinacityor what is it in me that after all when La Fleur had gone down stairs and I was quite alone that I could not bring down my mind to think of it otherwise than I had then spoken of it to Eugenius  And as for the Bastile the terror is in the wordMake the most of it you can said I to myself the Bastile is but another word for a towerand a tower is but another word for a house you can't get out ofMercy on the gouty for they are in it twice a yearbut with nine livres a day and pen and ink and paper and patience albeit a man can't get out he may do very well withinat least for a month or six weeks at the end of which if he is a harmless fellow his innocence appears and he comes out a better and wiser man than he went in  I had some occasion I forget what to step into the courtyard as I settled  this account and remember I walk'd down stairs in no small triumph with the conceit of my reasoningBeshrew the  sombre  pencil said I vauntinglyfor I envy not its powers which paints the evils of life with so hard and deadly a colouring The mind sits terrified at the objects she has magnified herself and blackened reduce them to their proper size and hue she overlooks them'Tis true said I correcting the propositionthe Bastile is not an evil to be despisedbut strip it of its towersfill up the fossèunbarricade the doorscall it simply a confinement and suppose 'tis some tyrant of a distemperand not of a man which holds you in  itthe evil vanishes and you bear the other half without complaint  I was interrupted in the heyday of this soliloquy with a voice which I took to be of a child which complained  "it could not get out"  I look'd up and down the passage and seeing neither man woman or child I went out without further attention  In my return back through the passage I heard the same words repeated twice over and looking up I saw it was a starling hung in a little cage  "I can't get outI can't get out"  said the starling  I stood looking at the bird and to every person who came through the passage it ran fluttering to the side towards which they approach'd it with the same lamentation of its captivity  "I can't get out"  said the starlingGod help thee said I but I'll let thee out cost what it will so I turn'd about the cage to get to the door it was twisted and double twisted so fast with wire there was no getting it open without pulling the cage to piecesI took both hands to it  The bird flew to the place where I was attempting his deliverance and thrusting his head through the trellis press'd his breast against it as if impatientI fear poor creature said I  I cannot set thee at liberty"No" said the starling  "I can't get outI can't get out"  said the starling  I vow I never had my affections more tenderly awakened or do I remember an incident in my life where the dissipated spirits to which my reason had been a bubble were so suddenly call'd home Mechanical as the notes were yet so true in tune to nature were they chanted that in one moment they overthrew all my systematic reasonings upon the Bastile and I heavily walk'd up stairs unsaying every word I had said in going down them  Disguise thyself as thou wilt still slavery said Istill thou art a bitter draught and though thousands in all ages have been made to drink of thee thou art no less bitter on that account'tis thou thrice sweet and gracious goddess addressing myself to LIBERTY whom all in public or in private worship whose taste is grateful and ever wilt be so till NATURE herself shall changeno  tint  of words can spot thy snowy mantle or chymic power turn thy sceptre into ironwith thee to smile upon him as he eats his crust the swain is happier than his monarch from whose court thou art exiledGracious heaven cried I kneeling down upon the last step but one in my ascent  grant me but health thou great Bestower of it and give me but this fair goddess as my companionand shower down thy mitres if it seems good unto thy divine providence upon those heads which are aching for them  THE CAPTIVE  PARIS  THE bird in his cage pursued me into my room I sat down close to my table and leaning my head upon my hand I begun to figure to myself the miseries of confinement I was in a right frame for it and so I gave full scope to my imagination  I was going to begin with the millions of my fellow creatures born to no inheritance but slavery but finding however affecting the picture was that I could not bring it  near me and that the multitude of of sad groups in it did but distract me  I took a single captive and having first shut him up in his dungeon I then look'd through the twilight of his grated door to take his picture  I beheld his body half wasted away with long expectation and confinement and felt what kind of sickness of the heart it was which arises from hope deferr'd Upon looking nearer I saw him pale and feverish in thirty years the western breeze had not once fann'd his bloodhe had seen no sun no moon in all that timenor had the  voice of friend or kinsman breathed through his latticehis children  But here my heart began to bleedand I was forced to go on with another part of the portrait  He was sitting upon the ground upon a little straw in the furthest corner of his dungeon which was alternately his chair and bed a little calender of small sticks were laid at the head notch'd all over with the dismal days and nights he had pass'd therehe had one of these little sticks in his hand and with a rusty nail he was etching another day of misery to add to the heap As I darkened the little light he had he lifted up a hopeless  eye towards the door then cast it downshook his head and went on with his work of affliction I heard his chains upon his legs as he turn'd his body to lay his little stick upon the bundleHe gave a deep sighI saw the iron enter into his soulI burst into tearsI could not sustain the picture of confinement which my fancy had drawnI startled up from my chair and calling La Fleur I bid him bespeak me a  remise  and have it ready at the door of the hotel by nine in the morning  I'll go directly said I myself to Monsieur Le Duke de Choiseul  La Fleur would have put me to bed but not willing he should see any thing upon my cheek which would cost the honest fellow a heart acheI told him I would go to bed by himselfand bid him go do the same  THE STARLING  ROAD TO VERSAILLES  I GOT into my  remise  the hour I proposed La Fleur got up behind and I bid the coachman make the best of his way to Versailles  As there was nothing in this road or rather nothing which I look for in travelling I cannot fill up the blank better than with a short history of this selfsame bird which became the subject of the last chapter  Whilst the Honourable Mr **** was waiting for a wind at Dover it had been caught upon the cliffs before it could well fly by an English lad who was his groom who not caring to destroy it had taken it in his breast into the packetand by course of feeding it and taking it once under his protection in a day or two grew fond of it and got it safe along with him to Paris  At Paris the lad had laid out a a livre in a little cage for the starling and as he had little to do better the five months his master stay'd there he taught it in his mother's tongue the four simple wordsand no more  to which I own'd myself so much it's debtor  Upon his master's going on for Italythe lad had given it to the master of the hotelBut his little song for liberty being in an  unknown  language at Paristhe bird had little or no store set by himso La Fleur bought both him and his cage for me for a bottle of Burgundy  In my return from Italy I brought him with me to the country in whose language he had learn'd his notesand telling the story of him to Lord ALord A begg'd the bird of mein a week Lord A gave him to Lord BLord B made a present of him to Lord Cand Lord's C's  gentleman sold him to Lord D's for a shillingLord D gave him to Lord Eand so onhalf round the alphabetFrom that rank he pass'd into the lower house and pass'd the hands of as many commonersBut as all these wanted to  get in  and my bird wanted to get outhe had almost as little store set by him in London as in Paris  It is impossible but many of my readers must have heard of him and if any by mere chance have ever seen himI beg leave to inform them that that bird was my birdor some vile copy set up to represent him  I have nothing further to add upon him but that from that time to this  I have borne this poor starling as the crest to my armsThus  blazon or coat of arms  And let the heralds officers twist his neck about if they dare  THE ADDRESS  VERSAILLES  I SHOULD not like to have my enemy take a view of my mind when I am going to ask protection of any man for which reason I generally endeavour to protect myself but this going to Monsieur Le Duc de C***** was an act of compulsionhad it been an act of choice I should have done it I suppose like other people  How many mean plans of dirty address as I went along did my  servile heart form I deserved the Bastile for every one of them  Then nothing would serve me when I got within sight of Versailles but putting words and sentences together and conceiving attitudes and tones to wreath myself into Monsieur Le Duc de C*****'s good gracesThis will dosaid IJust as well retorted I again as a coat carried up to him by an adventurous taylor without taking his measureFool continued Isee Monsieur Le Duc's face firstobserve what character is written in it take notice in what posture he stands to hear youmark the turns and expressions of  his body and limbsAnd for the tonethe first sound which comes from his lips will give it you and from all these together you'll compound an address at once upon the spot which cannot disgust the Dukethe ingredients are his own and most likely to go down  Well said I I wish it well overCoward again as if man to man was not equal throughout the whole surface of the globe and if in the fieldwhy not face to face in the cabinet too And trust me Yorick whenever it is not so man is false to himself and betrays his own succours ten times where nature does it once  Go to the Duc de C**** with the Bastile in thy looksMy life for it thou wilt be sent back to Paris in half an hour with an escort  I believe so said IThen I'll go to the Duke by heaven with all the gaity and debonairness in the world  And there you are wrong again replied IA heart at ease Yorick flies into no extremes'tis ever on its centerWell well cried I as the coachman turn'd in at the gatesI find I shall do very well and by the time he had wheel'd round the court and brought me up to the door I found myself so much the better for my own lecture that I  neither ascended the steps like a victim to justice who was to part with life upon the topmostnor did I mount them with a skip and a couple of strides as I do when I fly up Eliza to thee to meet it  As I enter'd the door of the saloon I was met by a person who possibly might be the maitre d'hotel but had more the air of one of the under secretaries who told me the Duc de C**** was busyI am utterly ignorant said I of the forms of obtaining an audience being an absolute stranger and what is worse in the present conjuncture of affairs being an Englishman tooHe replied that did not increase the difficultyI made  him a slight bow and told him I had something of importance to say to Monsieur Le Duc The secretary look'd towards the stairs as if he was about to leave me to carry up this account to some oneBut I must not mislead you said Ifor what I have to say is of no manner of importance to Monsieur Le Duc de C****but of great importance to myself  C'est une autre affaire  replied heNot at all said I to a man of gallantryBut pray good sir continued I when can a stranger hope to have  accesse  In not less than two hours said he looking at his watch The number of equipages in the courtyard seem'd to justify the calculation that I could  have no nearer a prospectand as walking backwards and forwards in the saloon without a soul to commune with was for the time as bad as being in the Bastile itself I instantly went back to my  remise  and bid the coachman drive me to the  cordon bleu  which was the nearest hotel  I think there is a fatality in itI seldom go to the place I set out for  LE PATISSER  VERSAILLES  BEFORE I had got halfway down the street I changed my mind as I am at Versailles thought I I might as well take a view of the town so I pull'd the cord and ordered the coachman to drive round some of the principal streetsI suppose the town is not very large said IThe coachmen begg'd pardon for setting me right and told me it was very superb and that numbers of the first dukes and marquises and counts had hotelsThe Count de B**** of  whom the bookseller at the Quai de Conti had spoke so handsomely the night before came instantly into my mindAnd why should I not go thought I to the Count de B**** who has so high an idea of English books and Englishmenand tell him my story so I changed my mind a second timeIn truth it was the third for I had intended that day for Madame de R**** in the Rue St Pierre and had devoutly sent her word by her  fille de chambre  that I would assuredly wait upon herbut I am govern'd by circumstancesI cannot govern them so seeing a man standing with a basket on the other side of the street as if he had something to sell I bid La Fleur go up  to him and enquire for the Count's hotel  La Fleur return'd a little pale and told me it was a Chevalier de St Louis selling  patès  It is impossible La Fleur said ILa Fleur could no more account for the phenomenon than myself but persisted in his story he had seen the croix set in gold with its red ribband he said tied to his buttonholeand had look'd into the basket and seen the  patès  which the Chevalier was selling so could not be mistaken in that  Such a reverse in man's life awakens a better principle than curiosity I could not help looking for some time  at him as I sat in the  remise  the more I look'd at himhis croix and his basket the stronger they wove themselves into my brainI got out of the  remise  and went towards him  He was begirt with a clean linen apron which fell below his knees and with a sort of a bib went half way up his breast upon the top of this but a little below the hem hung his croix His basket of little  patès  was cover'd over with a white damask napkin another of the same kind was spread at the bottom and there was a look of  propreté  and neatness throughout that one might have bought his  patès  of him as much from appetite as sentiment  He made an offer of them to neither but stood still with them at the corner of a hotel for those to buy who chose it without solicitation  He was about fortyeightof a sedate look something approaching to gravity I did not wonderI went up rather to the basket than him and having lifted up the napkin and taken one of his  patès  into my handI begg'd he would explain the appearance which affected me  He told me in a few words that the best part of his life had pass'd in the service in which after spending a small patrimony he had obtain'd a company and the croix with it  but that at the conclusion of the last peace his regiment being reformed and the whole corps with those of some other regiments left without any provisionhe found himself in a wide world without friends without a livreand indeed said he without any thing but thispointing as he said it to his croixThe poor chevalier won my pity and he finish'd the scene with winning my esteem too  The king he said was the most generous of princes but his generosity could neither relieve or reward every one and it was only his misfortune to be amongst the number He had a little wife he said whom  he loved who did the  patisserie  and added he felt no dishonour in defending her and himself from want in this wayunless Providence had offer'd him a better  It would be wicked to withhold a pleasure from the good in passing over what happen'd to this poor Chevalier of St Louis about nine months after  It seems he usually took his stand near the iron gates which lead up to the palace and as his croix had caught the eye of numbers numbers had made the same enquiry which I had doneHe had told them the same story and always with  so much modesty and good sense that it had reach'd at last the king's earswho hearing the Chevalier had been a gallant officer and respected by the whole regiment as a man of honour and integrityhe broke up his little trade by a pension of fifteen hundred livres a year  As I have told this to please the reader I beg he will allow me to relate another out of its order to please myselfthe two stories reflect light upon each otherand 'tis a pity they should be parted  THE SWORD  RENNES  WHEN states and empires have their periods of declension and feel in their turns what distress and poverty isI stop not to tell the causes which gradually brought the house d'E**** in Britany into decay The Marquis d'E**** had fought up against his condition with great firmness wishing to preserve and still shew to the world some little fragments of what his ancestors had beentheir indiscretions had put it out of his power There  was enough left for the little exigencies of  obscurity  But he had two boys who look'd up to him for  light  he thought they deserved it He had tried his swordit could not open the waythe  mounting  was too expensiveand simple oeconomy was not a match for itthere was no resource but commerce  In any other province in France save Britany this was smiting the root for ever of the little tree his pride and affection wish'd to see reblossomBut in Britany there being a provision for this he avail'd himself of it and taking an occasion when the states were assembled at Rennes  the Marquis attended with his two boys enter'd the court and having pleaded the right of an ancient law of the duchy which though seldom claim'd he said was no less in force he took his sword from his sideHeresaid hetake it and be trusty guardians of it till better times put me in condition to reclaim it  The president accepted the Marquis's swordhe stay'd a few minutes to see it deposited in the archives of his houseand departed  The Marquis and his whole family embarked the next day for Martinico and in about nineteen or twenty years of successful application to business  with some unlook'd for bequests from distant branches of his housereturn'd home to reclaim his nobility and to support it  It was an incident of good fortune which will never happen to any traveller but a sentimental one that I should be at Rennes at the very time of this solemn requisition I call it solemnit was so to me  The Marquis enter'd the court with his whole family he supported his ladyhis eldest son supported his sister and his youngest was at the other extreme of the line next his motherhe put his handkerchief to his face twice  There was a dead silence When the Marquis had approach'd within six paces of the tribunal he gave the Marchioness to his youngest son and advancing three steps before his familyhe reclaim'd his sword His sword was given him and the moment he got it into his hand he drew it almost out of the scabbard'twas the shining face of a friend he had once given uphe look'd attentively along it beginning at the hilt as if to see whether it was the samewhen observing a little rust which it had contracted near the point he brought it near his eye and bending his head down over itI think I saw a tear fall upon the place I could not be deceived by what followed  "I shall find said he some  other way  to get it off"  When the Marquis had said this he return'd his sword into its scabbard made a bow to the guardians of itand with his wife and daughter and his two sons following him walk'd out  O how I envied him his feelings  THE PASSPORT  VERSAILLES  I FOUND no difficulty in getting admittance to Monsieur Le Count de B**** The set of Shakespears was laid upon the table and he was tumbling them over I walk'd up close to the table and giving first such a look at the books as to make him conceive I knew what they wereI told him I had come without any one to present me knowing I should meet with a friend in his apartment who I trusted would do it for meit is my countryman  the great Shakespear said I pointing to his works  et ayez la bontè mon cher ami  apostrophizing his spirit added I  de me faire cet honneur la    The Count smil'd at the singularity of the introduction and seeing I look'd a little pale and sickly insisted upon my taking an armchair so I sat down and to save him conjectures upon a visit so out of all rule I told him simply of the incident in the bookseller's shop and how that had impell'd me rather to go to him with the story of a little embarrassment I was under than to any other man in FranceAnd what  is your embarrassment let me hear it said the Count So I told him the story just as I have told it the reader  And the master of my hotel said I as I concluded it will needs have it Monsieur le Count that I shall be sent to the Bastilebut I have no apprehensions continued Ifor in falling into the hands of the most polish'd people in the world and being conscious I was a true man and not come to spy the nakedness of the land I scarce thought I laid at their mercyIt does not suit the gallantry of the French Monsieur le Count said I to shew it against invalids  An animated blush came into the Count de B****'s cheeks as I spoke this  Ne craignez rien  Don't fear said heIndeed I don't replied I againbesides continued I a little sportinglyI have come laughing all the way from London to Paris and I do not think Monsieur le Duc de Choiseul is such an enemy to mirth as to send me back crying for my pains  My application to you Monsieur le Compte de B**** making him a low bow is to desire he will not  The Count heard me with great good nature or I had not said half  as muchand once or twice said  C'est bien dit  So I rested my cause thereand determined to say no more about it  The Count led the discourse we talk'd of indifferent thingsof books and politicks and menand then of womenGod bless them all said I after much discourse about themthere is not a man upon earth who loves them so much as I do after all the foibles I have seen and all the satires I have read against them still I love them being firmly persuaded that a man who has not a sort of an affection for the whole sex is incapable of ever loving a single one as he ought  Hèh bien Monsieur l'Anglois  said the Count gailyYou are not come to spy the nakedness of the landI believe you  ni encore  I dare say  that  of our womenBut permit me to conjectureif  par hazard  they fell in your waythat the prospect would not affect you  I have something within me which cannot bear the shock of the least indecent insinuation in the sportability of chitchat I have often endeavoured to conquer it and with infinite pain have hazarded a thousand things to a dozen of the sex togetherthe least of which I could not venture to a single one to gain heaven  Excuse me Monsieur Le Count said Ias for the nakedness of your land if I saw it I should cast my eyes over it with tears in themand for that of your women blushing at the idea he had excited in me I am so evangelical in this and have such a fellowfeeling for what ever is  weak  about them that I would cover it with a garment if I knew how to throw it onBut I could wish continued I to spy the  nakedness  of their hearts and through the different disguises of customs climates and religion find out what is good in them to fashion my own byand therefore am I come  It is for this reason Monsieur le Compte continued I that I have not seen the Palais royalnor the Luxembourgnor the Façade of the Louvrenor have attempted to swell the catalogues we have of pictures statues and churchesI conceive every fair being as a temple and would rather enter in and see the original drawings and loose sketches hung up in it than the transfiguration of Raphael itself  The thirst of this continued I as impatient as that which inflames the breast of the connoisseur has led me from my own home into Franceand from France will lead me through Italy'tis a quiet journey  of the heart in pursuit of NATURE and those affections which rise out of her which make us love each otherand the world better than we do  The Count said a great many civil things to me upon the occasion and added very politely how much he stood obliged to Shakespear for making me known to himbut  apropos  said heShakespear is full of great thingsHe forgot a small punctillio of announcing your nameit puts you under a necessity of doing it yourself  THE PASSPORT  VERSAILLES  THERE is not a more perplexing affair in life to me than to set about telling any one who I amfor there is scarce any body I cannot give a better account of than of myself and I have often wish'd I could do it in a single wordand have an end of it It was the only time and occasion in my life I could accomplish this to any purposefor Shakespear lying upon the table and recollecting I was in his books I took up Hamlet and turning immediately to the gravediggers scene in  the fifth act I lay'd my finger upon YORICK and advancing the book to the Count with my finger all the way over the nameMe  Voici  said I  Now whether the idea of poor Yorick's skull was put out of the Count's mind by the reality of my own or by what magic he could drop a period of seven or eight hundred years makes nothing in this account'tis certain the French conceive better than they combineI wonder at nothing in this world and the less at this inasmuch as one of the first of our own church for whose candour and paternal sentiments I have the highest veneration fell  into the same mistake in the very same case  "He could not bear he said to look into sermons wrote by the king of Denmark's jester"  Good my lord said Ibut there are two Yorick's The Yorick your lordship thinks of has been dead and buried eight hundred years ago he flourish'd in Horwendillus's courtthe other Yorick is myself who have flourish'd my lord in no courtHe shook his headGood God said I you might as well confound Alexander the Great with Alexander the Coppersmith my lord'Twas all one he replied  If Alexander king of Macedon could have translated your lordship  said II'm sure your Lordship would not have said so  The poor Count de B**** fell but into the same  error      Et Monsieur est il Yorick  cried the Count  Je le suis  said I  VousMoimoi qui ai l'honneur de vous parler Monsieur le CompteMon Dieu  said he embracing me  Vous etes Yorick  The Count instantly put the Shakespear into his pocketand left me alone in his room  THE PASSPORT  VERSAILLES  I COULD not conceive why the Count de B**** had gone so abruptly out of the room any more than I could conceive why he had put the Shakespear into his pocket  Mysteries which must explain themselves are not worth the loss of time which a conjecture about them takes up  'twas better to read Shakespear so taking up "  Much Ado about Nothing  " I transported myself instantly from the chair I sat in to Messina in Sicily and got so busy with Don Pedro and Benedick  and Beatrice that I thought not of Versailles the Count or the Passport  Sweet pliability of man's spirit that can at once surrender itself to illusions which cheat expectation and sorrow of their weary momentslonglong since had ye number'd out my days had I not trod so great a part of them upon this enchanted ground when my way is too rough for my feet or too steep for my strength I get off it to some smooth velvet path which fancy has scattered over with rosebuds of delights and having taken a few turns in it come back strengthen'd and refresh'dWhen evils press sore upon me and  there is no retreat from them in this world then I take a new courseI leave itand as I have a clearer idea of the elysian fields than I have of heaven I force myself like Eneas into themI see him meet the pensive shade of his forsaken Didoand wish to recognize itI see the injured spirit wave her head and turn off silent from the author of her miseries and dishonoursI lose the feelings for myself in hersand in those affections which were wont to make me mourn for her when I was at school  Surely this is not walking in a vain shadownor does man disquiet himself  in vain  by it  he oftener does so in  trusting the issue of his commotions to reason onlyI can safely say for myself I was never able to conquer any one single bad sensation in my heart so decisively as by beating up as fast as I could for some kindly and gentle sensation to fight it upon its own ground  When I had got to the end of the third act the Count de B**** entered with my Passport in his hand Mons le Duc de C**** said the Count is as good a prophet I dare say as he is a statesman  Un homme qui rit  said the duke  ne sera jamais dangereuz  Had it been for any one but the king's jester added the Count I  could not have got it these two hours  Pardonncz moi  Mons Le Compte said II am not the king's jesterBut you are YorickYes  Et vous plaisantez  I answered Indeed I did jestbut was not paid for it'twas entirely at my own expence  We have no jester at court Mons Le Compte said I the last we had was in the licentious reign of Charles the IIdsince which time our manners have been so gradually refining that our court at present is so full of patriots who wish for  nothing  but the honours and wealth of their countryand our ladies are all so chaste so spotless so good so devout  there is nothing for a jester to make a jest of  Voila un persiflage  cried the Count  THE PASSPORT  VERSAILLES  AS the Passport was directed to all lieutenant governors governors and commandants of cities generals of armies justiciaries and all officers of justice to let Mr Yorick the king's jester and his baggage travel quietly alongI own the triumph of obtaining the Passport was not a little tarnish'd by the figure I cut in itBut there is nothing unmixt in this world and some of the gravest of our divines have carried it so far as to affirm that enjoyment itself  was attended even with a sighand that the greatest  they knew of  terminated  in a general way  in little better than a convulsion  I remember the grave and learned Bevoriskius in his commentary upon the generations from Adam very naturally breaks off in the middle of a note to give an account to the world of a couple of sparrows upon the outedge of his window which had incommoded him all the time he wrote and at last had entirely taken him off from his genealogy  'Tis strange writes Bevoriskius but the facts are certain for I have  had the curiosity to mark them down one by one with my penbut the cocksparrow during the little time that I could have finished the other half this note has actually interrupted me with the reiteration of his caresses three and twenty times and a half  How merciful adds Bevoriskius is heaven to his creatures  Ill fated Yorick that the gravest of thy brethren should be able to write that to the world which stains thy face with crimson to copy in even thy study  But this is nothing to my travelsSo I twicetwice beg pardon for it  CHARACTER  VERSAILLES  AND how do you find the French said the Count de B**** after he had given me the Passport  The reader may suppose that after so obliging a proof of courtesy I could not be at a loss to say something handsome to the enquiry    Mais passe pour cela  Speak frankly said he do you find all the urbanity in the French which the  world give us the honour ofI had found every thing I said which confirmed it  Vraiment  said the count  Les Francois sont poli s  To an excess replied I  The count took notice of the word  excesse  and would have it I meant more than I said I defended myself a long time as well as I could against ithe insisted I had a reserve and that I would speak my opinion frankly  I believe Mons Le Compte said I that man has a certain compass as well as an instrument and that the social and other calls have occasion by turns for every key in him sothat  if you begin a note too high or too low there must be a want either in the upper or under part to fill up the system of harmonyThe Count de B**** did not understand music so desired me to explain it some other way A polish'd nation my dear Count said I makes every one its debtor and besides urbanity itself like the fair sex has so many charms it goes against the the heart to say it can do ill and yet I believe there is but a certain line of perfection that man take him altogether is empower'd to arrive atif he gets beyond he rather exchanges qualities than gets them I must not presume to say how far this has affected the French in the subject  we are speaking ofbut should it ever be the case of the English in the progress of their resentments to arrive at the same polish which distinguishes the French if we did not lose the  politesse de coeur  which inclines men more to human actions than courteous oneswe should at least lose that distinct variety and originality of character which distinguishes them not only from each other but from all the world besides  I had a few king William's shillings as smooth as glass in my pocket and foreseeing they would be of use in the illustration of my hypothesis  I had got them into my hand when I had proceeded so far  See Mons Le Compte said I rising up and laying them before him upon the tableby jingling and ribbing one against another for seventy years together in one body's pocket or another's they are become so much alike you can scarce distinguish one shilling from another  The English like antient medais kept more apart and passing but few peoples hands preserve the first sharpnesses which the fine hand of nature has given themthey are not so pleasant to feelbut in return  the legend is so visible that at the first look you see whose image and superscription they bearBut the French Mons Le Compte added I wishing to soften what I had said have so many excellencies they can the better spare thisthey are a loyal a gallant a generous an ingenious and good temper'd people as is under heavenif they have a faultthey are too  serious  Mon Dieu  cried the Count rising out of his chair  Mais vous plaisantez  said he correcting his exclamationI laid my hand upon my breast and with earnest  gravity assured him it was my most settled opinion  The Count said he was mortified he could not stay to hear my reasons being engaged to go that moment to dine with the Duc de C****  But if it is not too far to come to Versailles to eat your soup with me I beg before you leave France I may have the pleasure of knowing you retract your opinionor in what manner you support itBut if you do support it Mons Anglois said he you must do it with all your powers because you have the whole  world against youI promised the Count I would do myself the honour of dining with him before I set out for Italyso took my leave  THE TEMPTATION  PARIS  WHEY I alighted at the hotel the porter told me a young woman with a bandbox had been that moment enquiring for meI do not know said the porter whether she is gone away or no I took the key of my chamber of him and went up stairs and when I had got within ten steps of the top of the landing before my door I met her coming easily down  It was the fair  fille de chambre  I had walked along the Quai de Conti  with Madame de R**** had sent her upon some commissions to a  merchande de modes  within a step or two of the hotel de Modene and as I had fail'd in waiting upon her had bid her enquire if I had left Paris and if so whether I had not left a letter address'd to her  As the fair  fille de chambre  was so near my door she turned back and went into the room with me for a moment or two whilst I wrote a card  It was a fine still evening in the latter end of the month of Maythe crimson window curtains which were of the same colour of those of  the bed were drawn closethe sun was setting and reflected through them so warm a tint into the fair  fille de chambre  's faceI thought she blush'dthe idea of it made me blush myselfwe were quite alone and that superinduced a second blush before the first could get off  There is a sort of a pleasing half guilty blush where the blood is more in fault than the man'tis sent impetuous from the heart and virtue flies after itnot to call it back but to make the sensation of it more delicious to the nerves'tis associated  But I'll not describe itI felt something at first within me which was not in strict unison with the lesson of virtue I had given her the night beforeI sought five minutes for a cardI knew I had not oneI took up a penI laid it down againmy hand trembledthe devil was in me  I know as well as any one he is an adversary whom if we resist he will fly from usbut I seldom resist him at all from a terror that though I may conquer I may still get a hurt in the combatso I give up the triumph for security and instead of thinking to make him fly I generally fly myself  The fair  fille de chambre  came close up to the bureau where I was looking for a cardtook up first the pen I cast down then offered to hold me the ink she offer'd it so sweetly I was going to accept itbut I durst notI have nothing my dear said I to write uponWrite it said she simply upon any thing  I was just going to cry out Then I will write it fair girl upon thy lips  If I do said I I shall perishso I took her by the hand and led her to the door and begg'd she would not forget the lesson I had given herShe said Indeed she would not  and as she utter'd it with some earnestness she turned about and gave me both her hands closed together into mineit was impossible not to compress them in that situationI wish'd to let them go and all the time I held them I kept arguing within myself against itand still I held them onIn two minutes I found I had all the battle to fight over againand I felt my legs and every limb about me tremble at the idea  The foot of the bed was within a yard and a half of the place where we were standinggI had still hold of her handsand how it happened I can give no account but I neither  ask'd hernor drew hernor did I think of the bedbut so it did happen we both sat down  I'll just shew you said the fair  fille de chambre  the little purse I have been making today to hold your crown So she put her hand into her right pocket which was next me and felt for it for sometimethen into into the left  "She had lost it"  I never bore expectation more quietlyit was in her right pocket at lastshe pulled it out it was of green taffeta lined with a little bit of white quilted sattin and just big enough to hold the crownshe put it into my handit was pretty and I held it ten minutes with the back of my hand  resting upon her laplooking sometimes at the purse sometimes on one side of it  A stitch or two had broke out in the gathers of my stockthe fair  fille de chambre  without saying a word took out her little hussive threaded a small needle and sew'd it upI foresaw it would hazard the glory of the day and as she passed her hand in silence across and across my neck in the manoeuvre I felt the laurels shake which fancy had wreath'd about my head  A strap had given way in her walk and the buckle of her shoe was just falling offSee said the  fille de  chambre  holding up her footI could not for my soul but fasten the buckle in return and putting in the strapand lifting up the other foot with it when I had done to see both were rightin doing it too suddenlyit unavoidably threw the fair  fille de chambre  off her centerand then  THE CONQUEST  YESand thenYe whose claycold heads and lukewarm hearts can argue down or mask your passionstell me what trespass is it that man should have them or how his spirit stands answerable to the father of spirits but for his conduct under them  If nature has so wove her web of kindness that some threads of love and desire are entangled with the piecemust the whole web be rent in drawing them outWhip me such stoics great governor of nature  said I to myselfWherever thy providence shall place me for the trials of my virtuewhatever is my dangerwhatever is my situationlet me feel the movements which rise out of it and which belong to me as a manand if I govern them as a good oneI will trust the issues to thy justice for thou hast made usand not we ourselves  As I finish'd my address I raised the fair  fille de chambre  up by the hand and led her out of the roomshe stood by me till I lock'd the door and put the key in my pocket  and then  the victory being quite decisiveand not till then I  press'd my lips to her cheek and taking her by the hand again led her safe to the gate of the hotel  THE MYSTERY  PARIS  IF a man knows the heart he will know it was impossible to go back instantly to my chamberit was touching a cold key with a flat third to it upon the close of a piece of musick which had call'd forth my affectionstherefore when I let go the hand of the  fille de chambre  I remain'd at the gate of the hotel for some time looking at every one who pass'd by and forming conjectures upon them till my attention got fix'd  upon a single object which confounded all kind of reasoning upon him  It was a tall figure of a philosophic serious adust look which pass'd and repass'd sedately along the street making a turn of about sixty paces on each side of the gate of the hotelthe man was about fiftytwohad a small cane under his armwas dress'd in a dark drabcolour'd coat waistcoat and breeches which seem'd to have seen some years servicethey were still clean and there was a little air of frugal  propretè  throughout him By his pulling off his hat and his attitude of accosting a good many in his way I saw he was asking charity so I got a sous or  two out of my pocket ready to give him as he took me in his turnhe pass'd by me without asking any thingand yet did not go five steps further before he ask'd charity of a little womanI was much more likely to have given of the twoHe had scarce done with the woman when he pull'd off his hat to another who was coming the same wayAn ancient gentleman came slowlyand after him a young smart oneHe let them both pass and ask'd nothing I stood observing him half an hour in which time he had made a dozen turns backwards and forwards and found that he invariably pursued the same plan  There were two things very singular in this which set my brain to work and to no purposethe first was why the man should  only  tell his story to the sexand secondlywhat kind of story it was and what species of eloquence it could be which soften'd the hearts of the women which he knew 'twas to no purpose to practise upon the men  There were two other circumstances which entangled this mysterythe one was he told every woman what he had to say in her ear and in a way which had much more the air of a secret than a petitionthe other was it was always successfulhe never stopp'd a woman but she  pull'd out her purse and immediately gave him something  I could form no system to explain the phenomenon  I had got a riddle to amuse me for the rest of the evening so I walk'd up stairs to my chamber  THE CASE OF CONSCIENCE  PARIS  I WAS immediately followed up by the master of the hotel who came into my room to tell me I must provide lodgings else whereHow so friend said IHe answer'd I had had a young woman lock'd up with me two hours that evening in my bedchamber and 'twas against the rules of his houseVery well said I we'll all part friends thenfor the girl is no worseand I am no worseand you will be just as I found youIt was enough he said to  overthrow the credit of his hotel  Voyez vous Monsieur  said he pointing to the foot of the bed we had been sitting uponI own it had something of the appearance of an evidence but my pride not suffering me to enter into any detail of the case I exhorted him to let his soul sleep in peace as I resolved to let mine do that night and that I would discharge what I owed him at breakfast  I should not have minded  Monsieur  said he if you had had twenty girls'Tis a score more replied I interrupting him than I ever reckon'd uponProvided added he it hadbeen  but in a morningAnd does the difference of the time of the day at Paris make a difference in the sinIt made a difference he said in the scandalI like a good distinction in my heart and cannot say I was intolerably out of temper with the manI own it is necessary reassumed the master of the hotel that a stranger at Paris should have the opportunities presented to him of buying lace and silk stockings and ruffles  et tout cela  and 'tis nothing if a woman comes with a band boxO' my conscience said I she had one but I never look'd into itThen  Monsieur  said he has bought nothingNot one earthly thing replied IBecause said he I could recommend  one to you who would use you  en conscience  But I must see her this night said IHe made me a low bow and walk'd down  Now shall I triumph over this  maitre d'hotel  cried Iand what thenThen I shall let him see I know he is a dirty fellowAnd what thenWhat thenI was too near myself to say it was for the sake of othersI had no good answer leftthere was more of spleen than principle in my project and I was sick of it before the execution  In a few minutes the Grisset came in with her box of laceI'll buy  nothing however said I within myself  The Grisset would shew me every thingI was hard to please she would not seem to see it she open'd her little magazine laid all her laces one after another before meunfolded and folded them up again one by one with the most patient sweetnessI might buyor notshe would let me have every thing at my own pricethe poor creature seem'd anxious to get a penny and laid herself out to win me and not so much in a manner which seem'd artful as in one I felt simple and caressing  If there is not a fund of honest cullibility in man so much the worsemy heart relented and I gave up my second resolution as quietly as the firstWhy should I chastise one for the trespass of another if thou art tributary to this tyrant of an host thought I looking up in her face so much harder is thy bread  If I had not had more than four  Louis d'ors  in my purse there was no such thing as rising up and shewing her the door till I had first laid three of them out in a pair of ruffles  The master of the hotel will share the profit with herno matter  then I have only paid as many a poor soul has  paid  before me for an act he  could  not do or think of  THE RIDDLE  PARIS  WHEN La Fleur came up to wait upon me at supper he told me how sorry the master of the hotel was for his affront to me in bidding me change my lodgings  A man who values a good night's rest will not lay down with enmity in his heart if he can help itSo I bid La Fleur tell the master of the hotel that I was sorry on my side for the occasion I had given him  and you may tell him if you will La Fleur added I that if the young woman should call again I shall not see her  This was a sacrifice not to him but myself having resolved after so narrow an escape to run no more risks but to leave Paris if it was possible with all the virtue I enter'd in  C'est deroger à noblesse Monsieur  said La Fleur making me a bow down to the ground as he said it  Et encore Monsieur  said he may change his sentimentsand if  par hazard  he should like to amuse himself  I find no amusement in it said I interrupting him  Mon Dieu  said La Fleurand took away  In an hour's time he came to put me to bed and was more than commonly officioussomething hung upon his lips to say to me or ask me which he could not get off I could not conceive what it was and indeed gave myself little trouble to find it out as I had another riddle so much more interesting upon my mind which was that of the man's asking charity before the door of the hotelI would have given any thing to have got to the bottom of it and  that not out of curiosity'tis so low a principle of enquiry in general I would not purchase the gratification of it with a twosous piecebut a secret I thought which so soon and so certainly soften'd the heart of every woman you came near was a secret at least equal to the philosopher's stone had I had both the Indies I would have given up one to have been master of it  I toss'd and turn'd it almost all night long in my brains to no manner of purpose and when I awoke in the morning I found my spirit as much troubled with my  dreams  as ever the king of Babylon had been  with his and I will not hesitate to affirm it would have puzzled all the wise men of Paris as much as those of Chaldea to have given its interpretation  LE DIMANCHE  PARIS  IT was Sunday and when La Fleur came in in the morning with my coffee and role and butter he had got himself so gallantly array'd I scarce knew him  I had convenanted at Montreal to give him a new hat with a silver button and loop and four Louis d'ors  pour s'adoniser  when we got to Paris and the poor fellow to do him justice had done wonders with it  He had bought a bright clean good scarlet coat and a pair of breeches of the sameThey were not a crown worse he said for the wearingI wish'd him hang'd for telling methey look'd so fresh that tho' I knew the thing could not be done yet I would rather have imposed upon my fancy with thinking I had bought them new for the fellow than that they had come out of the  Rue de friperie  This is a nicety which makes not the heart sore at Paris  He had purchased moreover a handsome blue sattin waistcoat fancifully enough embroideredthis  was indeed something the worse for the services it had done but 'twas clean scour'dthe gold had been touch'd up and upon the whole was rather showy than otherwiseand as the blue was not violent it suited with the coat and breeches very well he had squeez'd out of the money moreover a new bag and a solitaire and had insisted with the  fripier  upon a gold pair of garters to his breeches kneesHe had purchased muslin ruffles  bien brodées  with four livres of his own moneyand a pair of white silk stockings for five moreand to top all nature had given him a handsome figure without costing him a sous  He enter'd the room thus set off with his hair dress'd in the first stile and with a handsome  bouquet  in his breastin a word there was that look of festivity in every thing about him which at once put me in mind it was Sundayand by combining both together it instantly struck me that the favour he wish'd to ask of me the night before was to spend the day as every body in Paris spent it besides I had scarce made the conjecture when La Fleur with infinite humility but with a look of trust as if I should not refuse him begg'd I would grant him the day  pour faire le galant vis à vis de sa maitresse  Now it was the very thing I intended to do myself  vis à vis  Madame de R****I had retain'd the  remise  on purpose for it and it would not have mortified my vanity to have had a servant so well dress'd as La Fleur was to have got up behind it I never could have worse spared him  But we must  feel  not argue in these embarrassmentsthe sons and daughters of service part with liberty but not with Nature in their contracts they are flesh and blood and have their little vanities and wishes in the midst of the house of bondage as well as their taskmasters  no doubt they have set their selfdenials at a priceand their expectations are so unreasonable that I would often disappoint them but that their condition puts it so much in my power to do it  BeholdBehold I am thy servant  disarms me at once of the powers of a master  Thou shalt go La Fleur said I  And what mistress La Fleur said I canst thou have pick'd up in so little a time at Paris La Fleur laid his hand upon his breast and said 'twas  a  petite demoiselle  at Monsieur Le Compte de B****'sLa Fleur had a heart made for society and to speak the truth of him let as few occasions slip him as his masterso that some how or other but howheaven knowshe had connected himself with the  demoiselle  upon the landing of the staircase during the time I was taken up with my Passport and as there was time enough for me to win the Count to my inteterest La Fleur had contrived to make it do to win the maid to histhe family it seems was to be at Paris that day and he had made a party with her and two or three more of the Count's houshold upon the  boulevards  Happy people that once a week at least are sure to lay down all your cares together and dance and sing and sport away the weights of grievance which bow down the spirit of other nations to the earth  THE FRAGMENT  PARIS  LA Fleur had left me something to amuse myself with for the day more than I had bargain'd for or could have enter'd either into his head or mine  He had brought the little print of butter upon a currant leaf and as the morning was warm and he had a good step to bring it he had begg'd a sheet of waste paper to put betwixt the currant leaf and his handAs that was plate sufficient I bad him lay it upon the table as it was  and as I resolved to stay within all day I ordered him to call upon the  traileur  to bespeak my dinner and leave me to breakfast by myself  When I had finish'd the butter I threw the currant leaf out of the window and was going to do the same by the waste paperbut stopping to read a line first and that drawing me on to a second and thirdI thought it better worth so I shut the window and drawing a chair up to it I sat down to read it  It was in the old French of Rabelais's time and for ought I know might have been wrote by himit was moreover in a Gothic letter and that  so faded and gone off by damps and length of time it cost me infinite trouble to make any thing of itI threw it down and then wrote a letter to Eugeniusthen I took it up again and embroiled my patience with it afreshand then to cure that I wrote a letter to ElizaStill it kept hold of me and the difficulty of understanding it increased but the desire  I got my dinner and after I had enlightened my mind with a bottle of Burgundy I at it againand after two or three hours poring upon it with almost as deep attention as ever Gruter or Jacob Spon did upon a nonsensical inscription I thought I  made sense of it but to make sure of it the best way I imagined was to turn it into English and see how it would look thenso I went on leisurely as a trifling man does sometimes writing a sentencethen taking a turn or twoand then looking how the world went out of the window so that it was nine o'clock at night before I had done itI then begun and read it as follows  THE FRAGMENT  PARIS  Now as the notary's wife disputed the point with the notary with too much heatI wish said the notary throwing down the parchment that there was another notary here only to set down and attest all this  And what would you do then Monsieur said she rising hastily upthe notary's wife was a little fume of a woman and the notary thought it  well to avoid a hurricane by a mild replyI would go answer'd he to bedYou may go to the devil answer'd the notary's wife  Now there happening to be but one bed in the house the other two rooms being unfurnish'd as is the custom at Paris and the notary not caring to lie in the same bed with a woman who had but that moment sent him pellmell to the devil went forth with his hat and cane and short cloak the night being very windy and walk'd out ill at ease towards the  pont neuf  Of all the bridges which ever were built the whole world who have  pass'd over the  pont neuf  must own that it is the noblestthe finestthe grandestthe lightestthe longestthe broadest that ever conjoin'd land and land together upon the face of the terraqueous globe  By this it seems as if the author of the fragment had not been a Frenchman  The worst fault which divines and the doctors of the Sorbonne can allege against it is that if there is but a capfull of wind in or about Paris 'tis more blasphemously  sacre Dieu'd  there than in any other aperture of the whole cityand with reason  good and cogent Messieurs for it comes against you without crying  garde d'eau  and with such unpremeditable puffs that of the few who cross it with their hats on not one in fifty but hazards two livres and a half which is its full worth  The poor notary just as he was passing by the sentry instinctively clapp'd his cane to the side of it but in raising it up the point of his cane catching hold of the loop of the sentinel's hat hoisted it over the spikes of the ballustrade clear into the Seine    'Tis an ill wind  said a boatsman who catch'd it  which blows no body any good  The sentry being a gascon incontinently twirl'd up his whiskers and levell'd his harquebuss  Harquebusses in those days went off with matches and an old woman's paper lanthorn at the end of the bridge happening to be blown out she had borrow'd the sentry's match to light itit gave a moment's time for the gascon's blood to run cool and turn the accident better to his advantage  'Tis an ill wind  said he catching off the notary's castor and  legitimating the capture with the boatman's adage  The poor notary cross'd the bridge and passing along the rue de Dauphine into the fauxbourgs of St Germain lamented himself as he walk'd along in this manner  Luckless man that I am said the notary to be the sport of hurricanes all my daysto be born to have the storm of ill language levell'd against me and my profession wherever I goto be forced into marriage by the thunder of the church to a tempest of a womanto be driven forth out of my house by  domestic winds and despoil'd of my castor by pontific onesto be here bareheaded in a windy night at the mercy of the ebbs and flows of accidentswhere I am to lay my headmiserable man what wind in the twoandthirty points of the whole compass can blow unto thee as it does to the rest of thy fellow creatures good  As the notary was passing on by a dark passage complaining in this sort a voice call'd out to a girl to bid her run for the next notarynow the notary being the next and availing himself of his situation walk'd up the passage to the door and passing  through an old sort of a saloon was usher'd into a large chamber dismantled of every thing but a long military pikea breast platea rusty old sword and bandoleer hung up equidistant in four different places against the wall  An old personage who had heretosore been a gentleman and unless decay of fortune taints the blood along with it was a gentleman at that time lay supporting his head upon his hand in his bed a little table with a taper burning was set close beside it and close by the table was placed a chairthe notary sat him down in it and pulling out his inkhorn and a sheet or two of paper which he had in his  pocket he placed them before him and dipping his pen in his ink and leaning his breast over the table he disposed every thing to make the gentleman's last will and testament  Alas Monsieur le Notaire said the gentleman raising himself up a little I have nothing to bequeath which will pay the expence of bequeathing except the history of myself which I could not die in peace unless I left it as a legacy to the world the profits arising out of it I bequeath to you for the pains of taking it from meit is a story so uncommon it must me read by all  mankindit will make the fortunes of your housethe notary dipp'd his pen into his inkhornAlmighty director of every event in my life said the old gentleman looking up earnestly and raising his hands towards heaventhou whose hand has led me on through such a labyrinth of strange passages down into this scene of desolation assist the decaying memory of an old infirm and brokenhearted mandirect my tongue by the spirit of thy eternal truth that this stranger may set down naught but what is written in that Book from whose records said he clasping his hands together I am to be condemn'd or acquittedthe notary held up  the point of his pen betwixt the taper and his eye  It is a story Monsieur le Notaire said the gentleman which will rouse up every affection in natureit will kill the humane and touch the heart of cruelty herself with pity  The notary was inflamed with a desire to begin and put his pen a third time into his inkhornand the old gentleman turning a little more towards the notary began to dictate his story in these words  And where is the rest of it La Fleur said I as he just then enter'd the room  THE FRAGMENT AND THE  Nosegay  BOUQUET  PARIS  WHEN La Fleur came up close to the table and was made to comprehend what I wanted he told me there were only two other sheets of it which he had wrapt round the stalks of a  bouquet  to keep it together which he had presented to the  demoiselle  upon the  boulevards  Then  prithee La Fleur said I step back to her to the Count de B****'s hotel and  see if you canst get  There is no doubt of it said La Fleurand away he flew  In a very little time the poor fellow came back quite out of breath with deeper marks of disappointment in his looks than could arise from the simple irreparability of the fragment  Juste ciel  in less than two minutes that the poor fellow had taken his last tender farewel of herhis faithless mistress had given his  gage d'amour  to one of the Count's footmenthe footman to a young sempstressand the sempstress to a fiddler with my fragment at the end of it  Our misfortunes were involved togetherI gave a sighand La Fleur echo'd it back again to my ear  How perfidious cried La FleurHow unlucky said I  I should not have been mortified Monsieur quoth La Fleur if she had lost itNor I La Fleur said I had I found it  Whether I did or no will be seen hereafter  THE ACT OF CHARITY  PARIS  THE man who either disdains or fears to walk up a dark entry may be an excellent good man and fit for a hundred things but he will not do to make a good sentimental traveller I count little of the many things I see pass at broad noon day in large and open streetsNature is shy and hates to act before spectators but in such an unobserved corner you sometimes see a single short scene of her's worth all the sentiments of a dozen French plays compounded togetherand yet  they are  absolutely  fineand whenever I have a more brilliant affair upon my hands than common as they suit a preacher just as well as a hero I generally make my sermon out of 'emand for the text  "Capadosia Pontus and Asia Phrygia and Pamphilia"  is as good as any one in the Bible  There is a long dark passage issuing out from the opera comique into a narrow street 'tis trod by a few who humbly wait for a  fiacre  Hackneycoach  or wish to get off quietly o'foot when the opera is done At the end of it towards the theatre 'tis lighted by a small candle  the light of which is almost lost before you get halfway down but near the door'tis more for ornament than use you see it as a fix'd star of the least magnitude it burnsbut does little good to the world that we know of  In returning along this passage I discern'd as I approach'd within five or six paces of the door two ladies standing arm in arm with their backs against the wall waiting as I imagined for a  fiacre  as they were next the door I thought they had a prior right so edged myself up within a yard or little more of them and quietly took my standI was in black and scarce seen  The lady next me was a tall lean figure of a woman of about thirtysix the other of the same size and make of about forty there was no mark of wife or widow in any one part of either of themthey seem'd to be two upright vestal sisters unsapp'd by caresses unbroke in upon by tender salutations I could have wish'd to have made them happytheir happiness was destin'd that night to come from another quarter  A low voice with a good turn of expression and sweet cadence at the end of it begg'd for a twelvesous piece betwixt them for the love of heaven I thought it singular that  a beggar should fix the quota of an almsand that the sum should be twelve times as much as what is usually given in the dark They both seemed astonish'd at it as much as myselfTwelve sous said onea twelvesous piece said the otherand made no reply  The poor man said He knew not how to ask less of ladies of their rank and bow'd down his head to the ground  Poo said theywe have no money  The beggar remained silent for a moment or two and renew'd his supplication  Do not my fair young ladies said he stop your good ears against meUpon my word honest man said the younger we have no changeThen God bless you said the poor man and multiply those joys which you can give to others without changeI observed the elder sister put her hand into her pocketI'll see said she if I have a sousA sous give twelve said the supplicant Nature has been bountiful to you be bountiful to a poor man  I would friend with all my heart said the younger if I had it  My fair charitable said he addressing himself to the elder  What is it but your goodness and humanity which makes your bright eyes so sweet that they outshine the the morning even in this dark passage and what was it which made the Marquis de Santerre and his brother say so much of you both as they just pass'd by  The two ladies seemed much affected and impulsively at the same time they both put their hands into their pocket and each took out a twelvesous piece  The contest betwixt them and the poor supplicant was no moreit was continued betwixt themselves which  of the two should give the twelvesous piece in charityand to end the dispute they both gave it together and the man went away  THE RIDDLE EXPLAINED  PARIS  I Stepp'd hastily after him it was the very man whose success in asking charity of the women before the door of the hotel had so puzzled meand I found at once his secret or at least the basis of it'twas flattery  Delicious essence how refreshing art thou to nature how strongly are all its powers and all its weaknesses on thy side how sweetly dost thou mix with the blood and help it through the most difficult and tortuous passages to the heart  The poor man as he was not straighten'd for time had given it here in a larger dose 'tis certain he had a way of bringing it into less form for the many sudden cases he had to do with in the streets but how he contrived to correct sweeten concentre and qualify itI vex not my spirit with the inquiryit is enough the beggar gain'd two twelvesous piecesand they can best tell the rest who have gain'd much greater matters by it  PARIS  WE get forwards in the world not so much by doing services as receiving them you take a withering twig and put it in the ground and then you water it because you have planted it  Mons Le Compte de B**** merely because he had done me one kindness in the affair of my passport would go on and do me another the few days he was at Paris in making me known to a few people of rank and they were to present me to others and so on  I had got master of my  secret  just in time to turn these honours to some little account otherwise as is commonly the case I should have din'd or supp'd a single time or two round and then by  translating  French looks and attitudes into plain English I should presently have seen that I had got hold of the  couvert  Plate napkin knife fork and spoon  of some more entertaining guest and in course should have resigned all my places one after another merely upon the principle that I could not keep themAs it was things did not go much amiss  I had the honour of being introduced to the old Marquis de B****  in days of yore he had signaliz'd himself by some small feats of chivalry in the  Cour d'amour  and had dress'd himself out to the idea of tilts and tournaments ever sincethe Marquis de B**** wish'd to have it thought the affair was somewhere else than in his brain  "He could like to take a trip to England"  and ask'd much of the English ladies Stay where you are I beseech you Mons le Marquise said ILes Messrs Angloise can scarce get a kind look from them as it isThe Marquis invited me to supper  Mons P**** the farmergeneral was just as inquisitive about our taxesThey were very considerable  he heardIf we knew but how to collect them said I making him a low bow  I could never have been invited to Mons P****'s concerts upon any other terms  I had been misrepresented to Madame de Q*** as an  esprit  Madam de Q*** was an  esprit  herself she burnt with impatience to see me and hear me talk I had not taken my seat before I saw she did not care a sous whether I had any wit or noI was let in to be convinced she hadI call heaven to witness I never once open'd the door of my lips  Madame de Q*** vow'd to every creature she met  "She had never had a more improving conversation with a man in her life"  There are three epochas in the empire of a FrenchwomanShe is coquettethen deistthen  devôte  the empire during these is never lostshe only changes her subjects when thirtyfive years and more have unpeopled her dominions of the slaves of love she repeoples it with slaves of infidelityand then with the slaves of the Church  Madame de V*** was vibrating betwixt the first of these epochas the colour of the rose was shading  fast awayshe ought to have been a deist five years before the time I had the honour to pay my first visit  She placed me upon the same sopha with her for the sake of disputing the point of religion more closelyIn short Madame de V*** told me she believed nothing  I told Madame de V*** it might be her principle but I was sure it could not be her interest to level the outworks without which I could not conceive how such a citadel as hers could be defendedthat there was not a more dangerous thing in the world than for a beauty to be a deistthat it was a debt I owed my  creed not to conceal it from herthat I had not been five minutes sat upon the sopha besides her but I had begun to form designsand what is it but the sentiments of religion and the persuasion they had existed in her breast which could have check'd them as they rose up  We are not adamant said I taking hold of her handand there is need of all restraints till age in her own time steals in and lays them on usbut my dear lady said I kissing her hand'tis tootoo soon  I declare I had the credit all over Paris of unperverting Madame de V***She affirmed to Mons  D*** and the Abbe M*** that in one half hour I had said more for revealed religion than all their Encyclopedia had said against itI was listed directly into Madame de V***'s  Coterie  and she put off the epocha of deism for two years  I remember it was in this  Coterie  in the middle of a discourse in which I was shewing the necessity of a  first cause  that the young Count de Faineant took me by the hand to the furthest corner of the room to tell me my  solitaire  was pinn'd too strait about my neckIt should be  plus badinant  said the Count looking down upon his ownbut a word Mons Yorick to  the wise    And from the wise Mons Le Compte replied I making him a bow  is enough  The Count de Faineant embraced me with more ardour than ever I was embraced by mortal man  For three weeks together I was of every man's opinion I met  Pardi ce Mons Yorick a autant d'esprit que nous autresIl raisonne bien  said another  C'est un bon enfant  said a thirdAnd at this price I could have eaten and drank and been merry all the days of my life at Paris but 'twas a dishonest  reckoning  I grew ashamed of itit was the gain of a slave  every sentiment of honour revolted against itthe higher I got the more was I forced upon my  beggarly system  the better the  Coterie  the more children of ArtI languish'd for those of Nature and one night after a most vile prostitution of myself to half a dozen different people I grew sickwent to bedorder'd La Fleur to get me horses in the morning to set out for Italy  MARIA  MOULINES  I NEVER felt what the distress of plenty was in any one shape till nowto travel it through the Bourbonnois the sweetest part of Francein the heyday of the vintage when Nature is pouring her abundance into every one's lap and every eye is lifted upa journey through each step of which music beats time to  Labour  and all her children are rejoicing as they carry in their clustersto pass through this with my affections flying out and kindling at every  group before meand every one of 'em was pregnant with adventures  Just heavenit would fill up twenty volumesand alas I have but a few small pages left of this to croud it intoand half of these must be taken up with the poor Maria my friend Mr Shandy met with near Moulines  The story he had told of that disorder'd maid affect'd me not a little in the reading but when I got within the neighbouthood where she lived it returned so strong into my mind that I could not resist an impulse which prompted me to go half a league out of the road to the village  where her parents dwelt to enquire after her  'Tis going I own like the Knight of the Woeful Countenance in quest of melancholy adventuresbut I know not how it is but I am never so perfectly conscious of the existence of a soul within me as when I am entangled in them  The old mother came to the door her looks told me the story before she open'd her mouthShe had lost her husband he had died she said of anguish for the loss of Maria's senses about a month beforeShe had feared at first she added that it would have plunder'd her poor girl  of what little understanding was leftbut on the contrary it had brought her more to herselfstill she could not resther poor daughter she said crying was wandering somewhere about the road  Why does my pulse beat languid as I write this and what made La Fleur whose heart seem'd only to be tuned to joy to pass the back of his hand twice across his eyes as the woman stood and told it I beckon'd to the postilion to turn back into the road  When we had got within half a league of Moulines at a little opening in the road leading to a thicket I  discovered poor Maria sitting under a poplarshe was sitting with her elbow in her lap and her head leaning on one side within her handa small brook ran at the foot of the tree  I bid the postilion go on with the chaise to Moulinesand La Fleur to bespeak my supperand that I would walk after him  She was dress'd in white and much as my friend described her except that her hair hung loose which before was twisted within a silk netShe had superadded likewise to her jacket a pale green ribband which fell across her shoulder to the waist at the end  of which hung her pipeHer goat had been as faithless as her lover and she had got a little dog in lieu of him which she had kept tied by a string to her girdle as I look'd at her dog she drew him towards her with the string  "Thou shalt not leave me Sylvio"  said she I look'd in Maria's eyes and saw she was thinking more of her father than of her lover or her little goat for as she utter'd them the tears trickled down her cheeks  I sat down close by her and Maria let me wipe them away as they fell with my handkerchiefI then sleep'd it in my ownand then in hersand then in mineand then  I wip'd hers againand as I did it I felt such undescribable emotions within me as I am sure could not be accounted for from any combinations of matter and motion  I am positive I have a soul nor can all the books with which materialists have pester'd the world ever convince me of the contrary  MARIA  WHEN Maria had come a little to herself I ask'd her if she remember'd a pale thin person of a man who had sat down betwixt her and her goat about two years before She said she was unsettled much at that time but remember'd it upon two accountsthat ill as she was she saw the person pitied her and next that her goat had stolen his handkerchief and she had beat him for the theftshe had wash'd it she said in the brook and kept it ever since in her pocket to restore it to him in case she should ever see him again which  she added he had half promised her As she told me this she took the handkerchief out of her pocket to let me see it she had folded it up neatly in a couple of vine leaves tied round with a tendrilon opening it I saw an S mark'd in one of the corners  She had since that she told me stray'd as far as Rome and walk'd round St Peter's onceand return'd backthat she found her way alone across the Apennineshad travell'd over all Lombardy without moneyand through the flinty roads of Savoy without shoeshow she had borne it and how she had got supported she could not tellbut  God  tempers the wind  said Maria to the shorn lamb  Shorn indeed and to the quick said I and wast thou in my own land where I have a cottage I would take thee to it and shelter thee thou shouldst eat of my own bread and drink of my own cupI would be kind to thy Sylvioin all thy weaknesses and wanderings I would seek after thee and bring thee backwhen the sun went down I would say my prayers and when I had done thou shouldst play thy evening song upon thy pipe nor would the incense of my sacrifice be worse accepted for entering heaven along with that of a broken heart  Nature melted within me as I utter'd this and Maria observing as I took out my handkerchief that it was steep'd to much already to be of use would needs go wash it in the streamAnd where will you dry it Maria said II'll dry it in my bosom said she'twill do me good  And is your heart still so warm Maria said I  I touch'd upon the string on which hung all her sorrowsshe look'd with wistful disorder for some time in my face and then without saying any thing took her pipe and play'd her service to the VirginThe string I had touch'd ceased to vibratein a  moment or two Maria returned to herselflet her pipe falland rose up  And where art you going Maria said IShe said to MoulinesLet us go said I togetherMaria put her arm within mine and lengthening the string to let the dog followin that order we entered Moulines  MARIA  MOULINES  THO' I hate salutations and greetings in the marketplace yet when we got into the middle of this I stopp'd to take my last look and last farewel of Maria  Maria tho' not tall was nevertheless of the first order of fine formsaffliction had touch'd her looks with something that was scarce earthlystill she was feminineand so much was there about her of all that the  heart wishes or the eye looks for in woman that could the traces be ever worn out of her brain and those of Eliza's out of mine she should  not only eat of my bread and drink of my own cup  but Maria should lay in my bosom and be unto me as a daughter  Adieu poor luckless maidenimbibe the oil and wine which the compassion of a stranger as he journieth on his way now pours into thy woundsthe being who has twice bruised thee can only bind them up for ever  THE BOURBONNOIS  THERE was nothing from which I had painted out for myself so joyous a riot of the affections as in this journey in the vintage through this part of France but pressing through this gate of sorrow to it my sufferings has totally unfitted me in every scene of festivity I saw Maria in the background of the piece sitting pensive under her poplar and I had got almost to Lyons before I was able to cast a shade across her  Dear sensibility source inexhausted of all that's precious in our joys or costly in our sorrows thou chainest thy martyr down upon his bed of strawand 'tis thou who lifts him up to HEAVENeternal fountain of our feelings'tis here I trace theeand this is thy divinity which stirs within menot that in some sad and sickening moments  "  my soul shrinks back upon herself and startles at destruction  "  mere pomp of wordsbut that I feel some generous joys and generous cares beyond myselfall comes from thee greatgreat SENSORIUM of the world which vibrates if a hair of our heads but falls upon the ground in the remotest  desert of thy creationTouch'd with thee Eugenius draws my curtain when I languishhears my tale of symptoms and blames the weather for the disorder of his nerves Thou giv'st a portion of it sometimes to the roughest peasant who traverses the bleakest mountainshe finds the lacerated lamb of another's flockThis moment I beheld him leaning with his head against his crook with piteous inclination looking down upon itOh had I come one moment soonerit bleeds to deathhis gentle heart bleeds with it  Peace to thee generous swainI see thou walkest off with anguish  but thy joys shall balance itfor happy is thy cottageand happy is the sharer of itand happy are the lambs which sport about you  THE SUPPER  A SHOE coming loose from the forefoot of the thillhorse at the beginning of the ascent of mount Taurira the postilion dismounted twisted the shoe off and put it in his pocket as the ascent was of five or six miles and that horse our main dependence I made a point of having the shoe fasten'd on again as well as we could but the postilion had thrown away the nails and the hammer in the chaisebox being of no great use without them I submitted to go on  He had not mounted half a mile higher when coming to a flinty piece of road the poor devil lost a second shoe and from off his other forefoot I then got out of the chaise in good earnest and seeing a house about a quarter of a mile to the lefthand with a great deal to do I prevailed upon the postilion to turn up to it The look of the house and of every thing about it as we drew nearer soon reconciled me to the disasterIt was a little farmhouse surrounded with about twenty acres of vineyard about as much cornand close to the house on one side was a  potagerie  of an acre and a half full of every thing  which could make plenty in a French peasant's houseand on the other side was a little wood which furnished wherewithal to dress it It was about eight in the evening when I got to the houseso I left the postilion to manage his point as he couldand for mine I walk'd directly into the house  The family consisted of an old greyheaded man and his wife with five or six sons and sonsinlaw and their several wives and a joyous genealogy out of 'em  They were all sitting down together to their lentilsoup a large wheaten loaf was in the middle of the  table and a flaggon of wine at each end of it promised joy thro' the stages of the repast'twas a feast of love  The old man rose up to meet me and with a respectful cordiality would have me sit down at the table my heart was sat down the moment I enter'd the room so I sat down at once like a son of the family and to invest myself in the character as speedily as I could I instantly borrowed the old man's knife and taking up the loaf cut myself a hearty luncheon and as I did it I saw a testimony in every eye not only of an honest welcome but of a welcome mix'd with thanks that I had not seem'd to doubt it  Was it this or tell me Nature what else it was which made this morsel so sweetand to what magick I owe it that the draught I took of their flaggon was so delicious with it that they remain upon my palate to this hour  If the supper was to my tastethe grace which follow'd it was much more so  THE GRACE  WHEN supper was over the old man gave a knock upon the table with the haft of his knifeto bid them prepare for the dance the moment the signal was given the women and girls ran all together into a back apartment to tye up their hairand the young men to the door to wash their faces and change their sabots and in three minutes every soul was ready upon a little esplanade before the house to beginThe old man and his wife came out last and placing me betwixt them sat down upon a sopha of turf by the door  The old man had some fifty years ago been no mean performer upon the vielleand at the age he was then of touch'd it well enough for the purpose His wife sung nowandthen a little to the tunethen intermittedand joined her old man again as their children and grandchildren danced before them  It was not till the middle of the second dance when from some pauses in the movement wherein they all seemed to look up I fancied I could distinguish an elevation of spirit different from that which is the cause or the effect of simple jollityIn a word I thought I beheld  Religion  mixing in the dancebut as I had never seen  her so engaged I should have look'd upon it now as one of the illusions of an imagination which is eternally misleading me had not the old man as soon as the dance ended said that this was their constant way and that all his life long he had made it a rule after supper was over to call out his family to dance and rejoice believing he said that a chearful and contented mind was the best sort of thanks to heaven that an illiterate peasant could pay  Or a learned prelate either said I  THE CASE OF DELICACY  WHEN you have gained the top of mount Taurira you run presently down to Lyonsadieu then to all rapid movements 'Tis a journey of caution and it fares better with sentiments not to be in a hurry with them so I contracted with a Voiturin to take his time with a couple of mules and convey me in my own chaise safe to Turin through Savoy  Poor patient quiet honest people fear not your poverty the treasury of your simple virtues will  not be envied you by the world nor will your vallies be invaded by itNature in the midst of thy disorders thou art still friendly to the scantiness thou hast createdwith all thy great works about thee little hast thou left to give either to the scithe or to the sicklebut to that little thou grantest safety and protection and sweet are the dwellings which stand so shelter'd  Let the wayworn traveller vent his complaints upon the sudden turns and dangers of your roadsyour rocksyour precipicesthe difficulties of getting upthe horrors of getting downmountains impracticableand cataracts which roll down great  stones from their summits and block his up roadThe peasants had been all day at work in removing a fragment of this kind between St Michael and Madane and by the time my Voiturin got to the place it wanted full two hours of compleating before a passage could any how be gain'd there was nothing but to wait with patience'twas a wet and tempestuous night so that by the delay and that together the Voiturin found himself obliged to take up five miles short of his stage at a little decent kind of an inn by the road side  I forthwith took possession of my bedchambergot a good fireorder'd  supper and was thanking heaven it was no worsewhen a voiture arrived with a lady in it and her servantmaid  As there was no other bedchamber in the house the hostess without much nicety led them into mine telling them as she usher'd them in that there was no body in it but an English gentlemanthat there were two good beds in it and a closet within the room which held anotherthe accent in which she spoke of this third bed did not say much for ithowever she said there were three beds and but three peopleand she durst say the gentleman would do  any thing to accommodate mattersI left not the lady a moment to make a conjecture about itso instantly made a declaration I would do any thing in my power  As this did not amount to an absolute surrender of my bedchamber I still felt myself so much the proprietor as to have a right to do the honours of itso I desired the lady to sit downpressed her into the warmest seatcall'd for more wooddesired the hostess to enlarge the plan of the supper and to favour us with the very best wine  The lady had scarce warm'd herself five minutes at the fire before  she began to turn her head back and give alook at the beds and the oftener she cast her eyes that way the more they return'd perplex'dI felt for herand for myself for in a few minutes what by her looks and the case itself I found myself as much embarrassed as it was possible the lady could be herself  That the beds we were to lay in were in one and the same room was enough simply by itself to have excited all thisbut the position of them for they stood parallel and so very close to each other as only to allow space for a small wicker chair betwixt them render'd the affair  still more oppressive to usthey were fixed up moreover near the fire and the projection of the chimney on one side and a large beam which cross'd the room on the other form'd a kind of recess for them that was no way favourable to the nicety of our sensationsif any thing could have added to it it was that the two beds were both of 'em so very small as to cut us off from every idea of the lady and the maid lying together which in either of them could it have been feasible my lying besides them tho' a thing not to be wish'd yet there was nothing in it so terrible which the imagination might not have pass'd over without torment  As for the little room within it offer'd little or no consolation to us 'twas a damp cold closet with a half dismantled window shutter and with a window which had neither glass or oil paper in it to keep out the tempest of the night I did not endeavour to stifle my cough when the lady gave a peep into it so it reduced the case in course to this alternativethat the lady should sacrifice her health to her feelings and take up with the closet herself and abandon the bed next mine to her maidor that the girl should take the closet c c  The lady was a Piedmontese of about thirty with a glow of health  in her cheeksThe maid was a Lyonoise of twenty and as brisk and lively a French girl as ever movedThere were difficulties every wayand the obstacle of the stone in the road which brought us into the distress great as it appeared whilst the peasants were removing it was but a pebble to what lay in our ways nowI have only to add that it did not lessen the weight which hung upon our spirits that we were both too delicate to communicate what we felt to each other upon the occasion  We sat down to supper and had we not had more generous wine to it than a little inn in Savoy could have  furnish'd our tongues had been tied up till necessity herself had set them at libertybut the lady having a few bottles of Burgundy in her voiture sent down her Fille de Chambre for a couple of them so that by the time supper was over and we were left alone we felt ourselves inspired with a strength of mind sufficient to talk at least without reserve upon our situation We turn'd it every way and debated and considered it in all kind of lights in the course of a two hours negociation at the end of which the articles were settled finally betwixt us and stipulated for in form and manner of a treaty of peaceand I believe with as much  religion and good faith on both sides as in any treaty which as yet had the honour of being handed down to posterity  They were as follows  First As the right of the bedchamber is in Monsieurand he thinking the bed next to the fire to be the warmest he insists upon the concession on the lady's side of taking up with it  Granted on the part of Madame with a proviso That as the curtains of that bed are of a flimsy transparent cotton and appear likewise too scanty to draw close that the  Fille de Chambre shall fasten up the opening either by corking pins or needle and thread in such manner as shall be deemed a sufficient barrier on the side of Monsieur  dly It is required on the part of Madame that Monsieur shall lay the whole night through in his robe de chambre  Rejected inasmuch Monsieur is not worth a robe de chambre he having nothing in his portmanteau but six shirts and a black silk pair of breeches  The mentioning the silk pair of breeches made an entire change of the articlefor the breeches were accepted  as an equivalent for the robe de chambre and so it was stipulated and agreed upon that I should lay in my black silk breeches all night  dly It was insisted upon and stipulated for by the lady that after Monsieur was got to bed and the candle and fire extinguished that Monsieur should not speak one single word the whole night  Granted provided Monsieur's saying his prayers might not be deem'd an infraction of the treaty  There was but one point forgot in this treaty and that was the manner in which the lady and myself should  be obliged to undress and get to bedthere was but one way of doing it and that I leave to the reader to devise protesting as I do it that if it is not the most delicate in nature 'tis the fault of his own imaginationagainst which this is not my first complaint  Now when we were got to bed whether it was the novelty of the situation or what it was I know not but so it was I could not shut my eyes I tried this side and that and turn'd and turn'd again till a full hour after midnight when Nature and
