 J NICHOLS'S SELECT COLLECTION OF POEMS VOLUME I  portrait of John Dryden  NATIONS UNBORN HIS MIGHTY NAME SHALL SOUND AND WORLDS APPLAUD THAT MUST NOT YET BE FOUND  JOHN DRYDEN DIED MAY  Engraved by Basire  A SELECT COLLECTION OF POEMS WITH NOTES BIOGRAPHICAL AND HISTORICAL  THE FIRST VOLUME  LONDON PRINTED BY AND FOR J NICHOLS RED LION PASSAGE FLEETSTREET MDCCLXXX  TO THE REVEREND THOMAS PERCY DD DEAN OF CARLISLE  REV SIR  WHEN these MISCELLANIES are inscribed to a PERCY I place them under the most auspicious shelter THE RELIQUES OF ANCIENT POETRY with which you obliged the world in your younger years would independent of all other claims have pointed you out as a proper Patron to these Fugitive Remains But excellent as your own Publications are it is neither to them nor to your elevated Station in Life that I pay this disinterested Tribute  Happy in a Family Connexion which however remotely entitles me to claim Relationship with the Poet CLEIVELAND extracts from whose Works will add merit to a future volume  of this Collection I am proud to have it known that the DEAN OF CARLISLE derives his descent from the same Family his father's mother having been niece to the Bard abovementioned a Family distinguished in private life for having produced a succession of most excellent Clergymen treading in the steps of their venerable Ancestor the Rev THOMAS CLEIVELAND father of the Poet who is upon record  See "Walker's Sufferings of the Clergy" p  for his very worthy character and most exemplary life  That urbanity Sir with which you recognized me as of kin to you and the Friendship I have since in consequence experienced from you as they have made an indelible impression demand the warm acknowledgements with which these volumes are most respectfully presented by  SIR  Your very much obliged and faithful humble servant J NICHOLS  Jan  ADVERTISEMENT  THIS Collection though formed principally from that of Mr DRYDEN is by no means a mere republication which would now have been particularly illtimed as a large portion of that excellent Miscellany the first which appeared in this kingdom with reputation is very properly arranged among the "Works of the English Poets" and some pages had crept into DRYDEN's Collection which may be permitted to perish without regret There still however are an infinite number of small poems which coming under neither of these descriptions must be allowed to possess considerable merit being the productions of men of real genius who from the brevity rather than the inferiority of their writings have been usually styled "Minor Poets"  On DRYDEN's foundation the present superstructure is begun In its progress almost every undertaking of a similar nature has been consulted and material parts incorporated The Collections formed by FENTON and STEELE have been epitomized whilst POPE's PEMBERTON's LINTOT's and  C TOOKE's have occasionally contributed to embellishment  The Collection by Mr R DODSLEY is allowed to be the completest of the kind and with this the present publication is so far from interfering that not a single poem is intended to be printed which is either in "DODSLEY's Collection" the Supplement to it by Mr PEARCH or in the Sixty Volumes of the "English Poets" To all or either of these therefore this Selection will be a suitable appendage and the more so as I have preserved some poems of merit which before were not known to have existed  The Reader will find in these volumes some of the earliest productions of DRYDEN some originals by Sir WILLIAM TEMPLE an Ode by SWIFT which had long been considered as irrecoverable a considerable number of good poems by STEELE PARNELL FENTON BROOME and YALDEN with a few pieces by HALIFAX DORSET ROCHESTER SPRAT PRIOR  The following anecdotes of this excellent Poet being curious I print them in the words of the friend from whom they are received  "At lord Oxford's seat at Wimple now lord Hardwicke's there hung a fine picture of Harley in his Speaker's robes with the roll of the bill in his hand for bringingin the present family which if I mistake not was done by his casting vote In allusion to Harley's being afterwards sent to The Tower Prior wrote with a pencil on the white scroll  Bill paid such a day  The late Recorder of Cambridge Pont had seen some MS Dialogues of the Dead of Prior's they were prose but had verse intermixed freely and the specimen I heard proved it The Dialogue was between Sir Thomas More and the Vicar of Bray You must allow that the characters are well chosen and the speakers maintain their respective opinions smartly at last the Knight seems to come over to his adversary at least so far as to allow that the doctrine was convenient if not honourable but that he did not see how any man could allow himself to act thus when the Vicar concludes Nothing easier with proper management c You must go the right way to work  " For Conscience like a fiery horse  " Will stumble if you check his course  " But ride him with an easy rein  " And rub him down with worldly gain  " He'll carry you through thick and thin  " Safe although dirty to your inn"  This certainly is sterling senseIt would give me great pleasure to be enabled to present these Dialogues to the world but where they are now deposited is unknown  POPE BOLINGBROKE  PHILIPS KING SMITH WATTS PITT HUGHES A PHILIPS and TICKELL which are not to be found in any edition of their works  The assistance of some intelligent friends has enabled me to add a biographical account of almost every Writer here selected and their persuasions have induced me to lay before the publick FOUR VOLUMES as part of the plan I have undertaken Two others are actually in the press There are still an infinite number of Collections which amidst a chaos of weeds would afford a considerable quantity of flowers well worth the transplanting But the encouragement these meet with must determine whether the publication shall cease at the end of the SIXTH volume or be extended still farther Without any great idea of emolument which in this case is far from being the principal object I am unwilling to sacrifice the little leisure of a laborious life in a pursuit that I have not reason to think will in some small degree contribute to  "the public stock of harmless pleasure"  To my concluding volume shall be annexed a complete

SELECT COLLECTION OF POEMS  ELEGY  "The Complaint" by Broome English Poets vol XL p is partly in imitation of this Elegy N  BY THE WIFE OF ST ALEXIAS  Or rather Alexis a nobleman of Rome of whom see a full account in Blainville's Travels II Alexias is probably the name of the poem as Christias is the history of Christ N    COMPLAINING OF HIS ABSENCE HE HAVING LEFT HER ON HIS WEDDING NIGHT UNENJOYED OUT OF ZEAL TO VISIT THE CHRISTIAN CHURCHES  FROM THE LATIN OF FRANCIS REMOND  A Jesuit of Dijon He employed himself in composing prose and poetry Vid Delit Gall Poet III p Alegambe a brother Jesuit in his Bibliotheque of the order p very highly commends his Alexias He died in N    LOV'D by and loving the best youth of Rome  My fatal charms sent many to their tomb  Now wretched maid and miserable wife  In tears and in complaints I waste my life  Abandon'd by my husband ere enjoy'd  With thoughts of pleasure yet untasted cloy'd  This conveys not the least idea of devotion N    He leaves me to my anxious cares a prey  Ah my Alexias whither do you stray  Whilst in my maidenwidow'd bed I lie  More wretched than the dead and wish to die  This certainly is an intemperate exaggeration N    In you were all my hopes dear wanderer  Your doubted safety now creates my fear  He broke his vows he broke our marriagebond  What dangers may a perjur'd wretch surround  At least his flight his tender feet may wound  Oh that I knew which way his course he steers  'Twould soften much my pains and lessen much my fears  A letter should inform him of my cares  And he in pity sure would read my prayers  I 'd write him lines might move a senseless stone  Nay his hard heart to feel compassion  But when we write too slow are the returns  Too slow for one that with my passion burns  Letters I would not trust myself would go  And from my mouth my sorrows he should know  By stealth I'll leave my father's house 'twas you  Did first alas the sad example shew  My pressing love would wing my willing fe  t  To fly till my Alexias I should meet  Through desarts I durst go a tender maid  In search of you I could not be afraid  No dangers should my eager steps retard  My innocence and love would be my guard  If dragons against me their crests should rear  Or should I meet a lion or a bear  I never can be capable of fear  David too young for toils a tender boy  Could the fierce lion and rough bear destroy  From his small hand a pebble could confound  And strike the mountaingiant to the ground  Th' Assyrian general Bethulia's dread  By a chaste woman's hand did lose his head  And she was by her guardian angel led  Why may not my attempts successful prove  Assisted by divinity and love  With fearless courage I dare undertake  Amazing actions for my husband's sake  Through all the world my life I'll follow thee  Whether by land thou wanderest or by sea  Whether on shore or on the swelling main  One house one boat may both of us contain  If your sharp keel Ionian waves divide  On that Ionian sea my bark shall ride  If to contemplate on the sufferings  And cruel death of the blest King of kings  A pilgrim to the Holyland you go  I'll join in adoration there with you  If where th' adored silver Jordan flows  With you in Palestine I'll offer holy vows  Or if to Scythian mountains you repair  And leave this temperate for that frozen air  With thee my soul I willingly can dwell  On the cold top of the Caucasian hill  Or should you wander o'er the Libyan sand  That vast and wild unhospitable land  Through those parcht plains with thee my love I'll stray  Nor fear the hungry savage beasts of prey  I'll be a Thracian if to Thrace you sail  My love shall o'er my sex's fears prevail  Nothing to follow you would seem a toil  Though to the utmost Indies you are driven  T  ll I can reach your arms I'll know no haven  Ah let chaste love propitious planets keep  Safe from the dangers of the greedy deep  Yet if my ship by tempests must be torn  By artful strokes above the waters borne  In spite of nature I shall swim to shore  For love will give my untaught hands the power  The flaming constellations are in love  And seas and all that in the waters move  Nor waves unsettled nor th' inconstant wind  Shall ever move my faith or shake my stedfast mind  But if inevitable fates decree  That I must suffer in the angry sea  Leviathan let me become thy prey  The only succour such a fate can give  In thy kind bowels hidden let me live  There let me rest till thou shalt find that shore  Where my Alexias is a wanderer  There cast me up unhurt and leave me there  So in the scaly monster Jonas lay  Protected from the fury of the sea  Both wondered at their lot and both rejoic'd  One with his guest was pleas'd the other with his hos  The third day came and then by heaven's command  The fish restor'd the prophet to the land  But if to me no fish will favour shew  And dear Alexias I must die for you  Oh love divine I'm pleas'd for thee to fall  For thee chaste author of my funeral  The sea shall take my name and 'mongst the stars  I'll be a guide to wandering mariners  While they with wonder shall repeat my name  A faith like mine deserves no less a fame  They'll doubtless pray that such a wife above  May be rewarded for so chaste a love  And that her husband there may constant prove  And for the load of waters she has born  Her ashes may lye easy in their urn  Alas I rave with fancies I am fed  Not knowing where my dearest husband 's fled  I search him dreaming in my widow'd bed  If to the woods I go or rocks or shores  From thee they've learn'd to scorn love's mighty powers  Unheard alas I lose my amorous groans  The winds and waves refuse to hear my moans  Echo alone can suffer my complaint  And she with repetition is grown faint  Return my life for what can cause your stay  If thou hast pity come oh come away  Ah suffer not thy absence I should mourn  I'll come to thee if thou canst not return  SAPPHO TO PHAON  This epistle after having appeared in a variety of collections was placed at the beginning of Garth's edition of "Ovid's Epistles by several hands" where it is followed by another translation of it by Mr Pope undertaken as that great poet expressly says  "not from any supposed defect in Sir Carr's translation"  but because he had not taken the whole of the original N  BY THE HON SIR CARR SCROPE  Son of Sir Adrian Scrope of Cockrington in Lincolnshire knight He became a gentleman commoner of Wadham College in was created a baronet Jan and took the degree of MA on the fourth of February following His poems are not numerous consisting principally of translations and lampoons In his "Defence of Satire" we are told by Anthony Wood there are reflections on  " John earl of Rochester Edward Griffin Wroth the page Franc Newport Lord Culpepper Henry Savil James duke of Monmouth Tho Armstrong Loftus Brandon Gerrard Jermyn earl of St Albans Finch lord chancellor"  This produced as might have been expected the keenest resentment of Rochester see his Poems p Sir Carr translated the fourth elegy of Ovid's first book and "The Parting of Sireno and Diana" wrote the Prologue to Lee's "Rival Queens" and to "The Man of Mode" and several songs introduced into the plays of those times He died in the parish of St Martin in the Fields in or about November He is mentioned with respect by Dr King Poems p Wood refers to a MS Song "on Scrope Godolphin and Dorset" in Mr Sheldon's Library "The Parting of Sireno and Diana" Wood says was translated from the third book of Ovid's Elegies but it is more probably from an Italian original N  BART  The poetess Sappho forsaken by her lover Phaon who was gone from Lesbos to Sicily and resolved in despair to drown herself writes this letter to him before she dies  WHILE Phaon to the flaming Aetna flies  Consum'd with no less fires poor Sappho dies  I burn I burn like kindled fields of corn  When by the driving winds the flames are borne  My muse and lute can now no longer please  They are th' employments of a mind at ease  Wandering from thought to thought I sit alone  All day and my once dear companions shun  In vain the Lesbian maids claim each a part  Where thou alone hast ta'en up all the heart  Ah lovely youth how canst thou cruel prove  When blooming years and beauty bid thee love  If none but equal charms thy heart can bind  Then to thyself alone thou must be kind  Yet worthless as I am there was a time  When Phaon thought me worthy his esteem  A thousand tender things to mind I call  For they who truly love remember all  Delighted with the music of my tongue  Upon my words with silent joy he hung  And snatching kisses stopp'd me as I sung  Kisses whose melting touch his soul did move  The earnest of the coming joys of love  Then tender words short sighs and thousand charms  Of wanton arts endear'd me to his arms  Till both expiring with tumultuous joys  A gentle faintness did our limbs surprize  Beware Sicilian ladies ah beware  How you receive my faithless wanderer  You too will be abus'd if you believe  The flattering words that he so well can give  Loose to the winds I let my flowing hair  No more with fragant scents perfume the air  But all my dress discovers wild despair  For whom alas should now my art be shown  The only man I car'd to please is gone  Oh let me once more see those eyes of thine  Thy love I ask not do but suffer mine  Thou might'st at least have ta'en thy last farewell  And feign'd a sorrow which thou didst not feel  No kind remembering pledge was ask'd by thee  And nothing left but injuries with me  Witness ye gods with what a deathlike cold  My heart was seiz'd when first thy flight was told  Speechless and stupid for a while I lay  And neither words nor tears could find their way  But when my swelling passion forc'd a vent  With hair dishevel'd cloaths in pieces rent  Like some mad mother through the streets I run  Who to the grave attends her only son  Expos'd to all the world myself I see  Forgetting virtue fame and all but thee  So ill alas do love and shame agree  'Tis thou alone that art my constant care  In pleasing dreams thou comfort'st my despair  And mak'st the night that does thy form convey  Welcome to me above the fairest day  Then spite of absence I thy love enjoy  In close embraces lock'd methinks we lie  Thy tender words I hear thy kisses feel  With all the joys that shame forbids to tell  But when I waking miss thee from my bed  And all my pleasing images are fled  The dear deluding vision to retain  I lay me down and try to sleep again  Soon as I rise I haunt the caves and groves  Those conscious scenes of our once happy loves  There like some frantic Bacchanal I walk  And to myself with sad distraction talk  Then big with grief I throw me on the ground  And view the melancholy grotto round  Whose hanging roof of moss and craggy stone  Delights my eyes above the brightest throne  But when I spy the bank whose grassy bed  Retains the print our weary bodies made  On thy forsaken side I lay me down  And with a shower of tears the place I drown  The trees are wither'd all since thou art gone  As if for thee they put their mourning on  No warbling bird does now with musick fill  The woods except the mournful Philomel  With her's my dismal notes all night agree  Of Tereus she complains and I of thee  Ungentle youth didst thou but see me mourn  Hard as thou art thou would'st thou would'st return  My constant falling tears the paper stain  And my weak hand can scarce direct my pen  Oh could thy eyes but reach my dreadful state  As now I stand prepar'd for sudden fate  Thou could'st not see this naked breast of mine  Dash'd against rocks rather than join'd to thine  Peace Sappho peace thou send'st thy fruitless cries  To one more hard than rocks more deaf than s  as  The flying winds bear thy complaints away  But none will ever back his sails convey  No longer then thy hopeless love attend  But let thy life here with thy letter end  THE PARTING OF SIRENO AND DIANA  BY THE SAME  Sireno and Diana having loved each other with a most violent passion Sireno is compelled upon the account of his master's service to go for some time into a foreign country The melancholy parting of the two lovers is the subject of the following eclogue  CLOSE by a stream whose flowery bank might give  Delight to eyes that had no cause to grieve  The sad Sireno sate and fed his sheep  Which now alas he had no joy to keep  Since his hard fate compell'd him to depart  From her dear sight who long had charm'd his heart  Fix'd were his thoughts upon the fatal day  That gave him first what this must take away  Through all the story of his love he ran  And nought forgot that might increase his pain  Then with a sigh raising his heavy eyes  Th' approach of his afflicted nymph he spies  Sad as she was she lost no usual grace  But as she pass'd seem'd to adorn the place  Thither she came to take her last farewell  Her silent look did her sad business tell  Under a neighbouring tree they sate them down  Whose shade had oft preserv'd them from the sun  Each took the other by the willing hand  Striving to speak but could no word command  With mutual grief both were so overcome  The much they had to say had made them dumb  There many a time they two had met before  But met alas upon a happier score  Cruel reverse of fate which all the joys  Their mutual presence us'd to bring destroys  Sireno saw his fatal hour draw near  And wanting strength the parting pang to bear  All drown'd in tears he gaz'd upon the maid  And she with equal grief the swain survey'd  Till his imprison'd passion forc'd its way  And gave him leave faintly at last to say  SIRENO  O my Diana who would have believ'd  That when the sad Sireno most had griev'd  Any affliction could have fall'n on me  That would not vanish at the sight of thee  Thy charming eyes could all my clouds dispel  Let but Diana smile and all was well  Absent from thee my soul no joy could know  And yet alas I die to see thee now  DIANA  Turn O Sireno turn away thy face  While all her shame a blushing maid betrays  For though my eyes a secret pain reveal  My tongue at least should my fond thoughts conceal  Yet I would speak could speaking do me good  And since it is to thee methinks it should  O shepherd think how wretched I shall be  When hither I return depriv'd of thee  When sitting all alone within this shade  Which thou so oft thy tender choice hast made  I read my name engrav'd on every bark  Of our past love the kind affecting mark  Then my despairing soul to death nust fly  And must thou be content to let me die  Why dost thou weep Alas those tears are vain  Since 'tis thy fault that both of us complain  By this the falsehood of thy vows I know  For were thy sorrow true thou would'st not go  SIRENO  Cease cruel nymph such killing language cease  And let the poor Sireno die in peace  Witness ye everlasting powers above  That never shepherd bore a truer love  With thee I wish 't had been my happy doom  With thee alone to spend my life to come  That we now part is by no fault of mine  Nor yet my dearest shepherdess of thine  For as no faith did ever mine excel  So never any nymph deserv'd so well  But the great shepherd whom we all obey  'Tis his command that forces me away  Whatever he ordains none dare refuse  I must my joy or else my honour lose  Should I to him deny th' allegiance due  Thou might'st to thee think me disloyal too  DIANA  No no Sireno now too late I find  How fond she is that can believe mankind  Who such excuses for himself pretends  Will easily bear the absence he defends  A little time I fear will quite deface  Thy thoughts of me to give another place  Fool that I was my weakness to betray  To one not mov'd with all that I can say  Go cruel man embark whene'er you please  But take this with you as you pass the seas  Though with the fiercest winds the waves should roar  That tempest will be less than mine on shore  SIRENO  'Tis hard unjust suspicions to abide  But who can such obliging anger chide  Fair as thou art that charm could never move  My heart to this degree without thy love  For 'tis thy tender sense of my sad fate  That does my sharpest deadliest pain create  Ah fear not to what place soe'er I go  That I shall ever break my sacred vow  When for another I abandon thee  May heaven for such a crime abandon me  DIANA  If ever I my dearest swain deceive  Or violate the faith that here I give  When to their food my hungry flocks I lead  May the fresh grass still wither where they tread  And may this river when I come to drink  Dry up as soon as I approach the brink  Take here this bracelet of my virgin hair  And when for me thou canst a minute spare  Remember this poor pledge was once a part  Of her who with it gave thee all her heart  Where'er thou goest may fortune deal with thee  Better than thou alas has dealt with me  Farewell my tears will give me leave to say  No more than this to all the Gods I pray  These weeping eyes may once enjoy thy sight  Before they close in death's eternal night  SIRENO  Then let Sireno banish all his fears  Heaven cannot long resist such pious tears  The righteous Gods from whom our passion came  Will pity sure so innocent a flame  Reverse the hard decree for which we mourn  And let Sireno to his joys return  I shall again my charming nymph behold  And never part but in her arms grow old  That hope alone my breaking heart sustains  And arms my tortur'd soul to bear my pains  PROLOGUE TO THE MAN OF MODE  BY THE SAME    LIKE dancers on the ropes poor poets fare  Most perish young the rest in danger are  This one would think should make our authors wary  But gamester like the giddy fools miscarry  A lucky hand or two so tempts them on  They cannot leave off play till they 're undone  With modest fears a Muse does first begin  Like a young wench newly entic'd to sin  But tickled once with praise by her goodwill  The wanton fool would never more lie still  'Tis an old mistress you 'll meet here tonight  Whose charms you once have look'd on with delight  But now of late such dirty drabs have known you  A Muse o' th' better sort 's asham'd to own you  Nature well drawn and wit must now give place  To gaudy nonsense and to dull grimace  Nor is it strange that you should like so much  That kind of wit for most of yours is such  But I 'm afraid that while to France we go  To bring you home fine dresses dance and show  The stage like you will but more foppish grow  Of foreign wares why should we fetch the scum  When we can be so richly serv'd at home  For heaven be thank'd 'tis not so wise an age  But your own follies may supply the stage  Though often plough'd there's no great fear the soil  Should barren grow by the too frequent toil  While at your doors are to be daily found  Such loads of dunghill to manure the ground  'Tis by your follies that we players thrive  As the physicians by diseases live  And as each year some new distemper reigns  Whose friendly poison helps t' increase their gains  So among you there starts up every day  Some new unheardof fool for us to play  Then for your own sakes be not too severe  Nor what you all admire at home damn here  Since each is fond of his own ugly face  Why should you when we hold it break the glass  SONG IN THE MAN OF MODE  BY THE SAME  FROM THE FRENCH OF MADAME DE LA SUZE  AS Amoret with Phyllis sate  One evening on the plain  And saw the charming Strephon wait  To tell the nymph his pain  The threatening danger to remove  She whisper'd in her ear  Ah Phyllis if you would not love  This shepherd do not hear  None ever had so strange an art  His passion to convey  Into a listening virgin's heart  And steal her soul away  Fly fly betimes for fear you give  Occasion for your fate  In vain said she in vain I strive  Alas tis now too late  PROLOGUE TO THE RIVAL QUEENS  BY THE SAME    HOW hard the fate is of the scribbling drudge  Who writes to all when yet so few can judge  Wit like religion once divine was thought  And the dull crowd believ'd as they were taught  Now each fanatic fool presumes t' explain  The text and does the sacred writ profane  For while your wits each other's fall pursue  The fops usurp the power belongs to you  You think y' are challeng'd in each new playbill  And here you come for trial of your skill  Where fencerlike you one another hurt  While with your wounds you make the rabble sport  Others there are that have the brutal will  To murder a poor play but want the skill  They love to fight but seldom have the wit  To spy the place where they may thrust and hit  And therefore like some bully of the town  Ne'er stand to draw but knock the poet down  With these like hogs in gardens it succeeds  They root up all and know not flowers from weeds  As for you sparks that hither come each day  To act your own and not to mind our play  Rehearse your usual follies to the pit  And with loud nonsense drown the stage's wit  Talk of your cloaths your last debauches tell  And witty bargains to each other sell  Glout on the silly she who for your sake  Can vanity and noise for love mistake  Till the coquette sung in the next lampoon  Is by her jealous friends sent out of town  For in this duelling intriguing age  The love you make is like the war you wage  Y' are still prevented ere you come t' engage  But 'tis not to such trifling foes as you  The mighty Alexander deigns to sue  The Persians of the pit he does despise  But to the men of sense for aid he flies  On their experienc'd arms he now depends  Nor fears he odds if they but prove his friends  For as he once a little handful chose  The numerous armies of the world t' oppose  So back'd by you who understand the rules  He hopes to rout the mighty host of fools  HORACE BOOK I ODE IV  CONQUER'D with soft and pleasing charms  And neverfailing vows of her return  Winter unlocks his frosty arms  To free the joyful Spring  Which for fresh loves with youthful heat does burn  Warm southwinds court her and with fruitful shower  Awake the drowsy flowers  Who haste and all their sweetness bring  To pay their yearly offering  No nipping white is seen  But all the fields are clad with pleasant green  And only fragrant dews now fall  The ox forsakes his oncewarm stall  To bask i' th' sun's much warmer beams  The ploughman leaves his fire and his sleep  Well pleas'd to whistle to his labouring teams  Whilst the glad shepherd pipes to frisking sheep  Nay tempted by the smiling sky  Wreck'd merchants quit the shore  Resolving once again to try  The wind and sea's almighty power  Chusing much rather to be dead than poor  Upon the flowery plains  Or under shady trees  The shepherdesses and their swains  Dance to their rural harmonies  They steal in private to the covert groves  There finish their wellheighten'd loves  The city dame takes this pretence  Weary of husband and of innocence  To quit the smoke and business of the town  And to her countryhouse retires  Where she may bribe then grasp some brawny clown  Or her appointed gallant come  To feed her loose desires  Whilst the poor dotard by his sweat at home  Maintains her lust and pride  Blest as he thinks in such a beauteous bride  Since all the world's thus gay and free  Why should not we  Let's then accept our mother nature's treat  And please ourselves with all that's sweet  Let's to the shady bowers  Where crown'd with gaudy flowers  We 'll drink and laugh away the gliding hours  For trust me Thyrsis the grim conqueror Death  With the same freedom snatches a king's breath  He huddles the poor fetter'd slave  To 's unknown grave  Though each day we with cost repair  He mocks our greatest skill and utmost care  Nor loves the fair nor fears the strong  And he that lives the longest dies but young  And once depriv'd of light  We 're wrapt in mists of endless night  Once come to those dark cells of which we're told  So many strange romantic tales of old  In things unknown invention 's justly bold  No more shall mirth and wine  Our loves and wits refine  No more shall you your Phyllis have  Phyllis so long you 've priz'd  Nay she too in the grave  Shall lie like us despis'd  PHARMACEUTRIA  Another imitation of the Pharmaceutria is printed among the poems of Lord Lansdowne p Some account of Mr Bowles shall be given in this volume N  OR THE ENCHANTRESS  TRANSLATED FROM THEOCRITUS  BY MR W BOWLES OF KING'S COLLEGE CAMBRIDGE  Simaetha is here introduced by the poet in love with one Delphis and not having seen him in twelve days and suspecting him to love some other woman she by the help of her maid Thestylis endeavours by charms to reduce him  THE philtres Thestylis and charms prepare  I'll try since neither Gods nor Delphis hear  If the false man by me in vain belov'd  Be charms and arts more powerful can be mov'd  Twelve days an age to me alas are past  Since at th  se doors he knock'd or saw me last  Sc  rn'd and neglected if I live or no  Inhuman as he is he does not know  To some new mistress sure he is inclin'd  For love has wings and he a changing mind  Tomorrow I'll to the Palaestra go  And tell him he 's unkind to use me so  Now to my charm but you bright queen of night  Shine and assist me with your borrow'd light  You mighty goddess I invoke and you  Infernal Hecate  When you ascend from the pale shades below  Through gaping tombs and the divided ground  A sudden horror seizes all around  The dogs at your approach affrighted fly  Assist and with your powerful aid be nigh  Inspire this charm and may it prove as strong  As Circe's or the bold Medea's song  Bring back ye sacred herbs and powerful charms  Bring back the perjur'd Delphis to my arms  Throw meal upon the hallow'd flames d' you stand  Insensible you sot when I command  Or am I scorn'd and grown a jest to you  Strew salt and say thus Delphis' bones I strew  Bring back ye sacred herbs and powerful charms  Bring back the perjur'd Delphis to my arms  As Delphis me so I this laurel burn  And as that burns and does to ashes turn  And cracks and in a glorious light expires  So may false Delphis burn in quicker fires  Bring back ye sacred herbs and powerful charms  Bring back the perjur'd Delphis to my arms  As the wax melts which in the fire I cast  So in love's slower flames may Delphis waste  And as this wheel with motion quick turn'd round  Though seeming to go on and quit its ground  Returns and in its magic circle still is found  So though averse and fled from my embrace  May he return and still maintain his place  Bring back ye sacred herbs and powerful charms  Bring back the perjur'd Delphis to my arms  Hail Artemis and aid me from above  You all the stubborn powers below can move  Th' infernal judges and th' infernal king  Ring Thestylis the sounding brass haste ring  She comes the goddess comes the dreadful cry  Of howling dogs gives notice she is nigh  Bring back ye sacred herbs and powerful charms  Bring back the perjur'd Delphis to my arms  See silent are the winds a peaceful sleep  Has calm'd the raging seas and smooth'd the deep  But the rough tempest that distracts my breast  No calm can find and will admit no rest  O chastity and violated same  I burn for him whose love's my only shame  Bring back ye sacred herbs and powerful charms  Bring back the perjur'd Delphis to my arms  Thus thrice I sacrifice and thrice I pray  You execute great goddess what I say  Whoe'er she be that shares his envied bed  Proud by her conquest and my ruin made  Her honour lost and she und  ne as I  Deserted and abandon'd may she lie  As did on Dia's shore the royal maid  By perjur'd Theseus' cruelty betray'd  Bring back ye sacred herbs and powerful charms  Bring back the perjur'd Delphis to my arms  Hippomanes but tasted rage inspires  And with new heat the winged coursers fires  O'er fields and woods and mountains tops they go  Their rage no bounds and they no stop can know  Such is the plant and oh that I might see  My Delphis with like rage run home to me  Bring back ye sacred herbs and powerful charms  Bring back the perjur'd Delphis to my arms  This fringe which my lov'd Delphis once did wear  This once dear relick thus enrag'd I tear  How cruel is the love that leachlike drains  From my pale limbs the blood and empty veins  Bring back ye sacred herbs and powerful charms  Bring back the perjur'd Delphis to my arms  Tomorrow a dire potion I'll compound  Now Thestylis this philtre spread around  His fatal door  There all my thoughts and my lost senses dwell  There though ill us'd my soul continues still  And spit and the ingrateful man de  ove  That slights my passion and neglects my love  Bring back ye sacred herbs and powerful charms  Bring back the perjur'd Delphis to my arms  She's gone and since I now am left alone  What shall I say what first shall I bemoan  What was the cause whence sprung my illplac'd love  Diana's rites can tell and fatal grove  When fair Anaxo to the temple led  Her nuptialvow to the chaste goddess paid  With savage beasts the glorious pomp was grac'd  And a fierce lioness amidst them plac'd  Tell silver Phoebe tell whence sprung my flame  Tell for you know whence the dire passion came  Theucharila my nurse would see the show  She near us dwelt and begg'd of me to go  Her prayers and my ill fate at last prevail'd  There my kind stars and better genius fail'd  Tell silver Phoebe tell whence sprung my flame  Tell for you know whence the dire passion came  There all my ills began for there alas  I Delphis saw and Eudamippus pass  Their golden hair in careless curls hung down  And brighter Cynthia far than you they shone  Tell silver Phoebe tell whence sprung my flame  Tell for you know whence the dire passion came  I saw and was undone a subtle fire  Ran through my veins and kindled hot desire  The shining pomp could now no more surprize  A nobler object now employ'd my eyes  When that was ended I forgot to go  How I return'd or when I did not know  Ten days as many restless nights I lay  My beauty to the fierce disease a prey  Tell silver Phoebe tell whence sprung my flame  Tell for you know whence the dire passion came  My flesh all wasted and my limbs all pale  And all my hair with the strong poison fell  Ah cruel love to what dost thou inforce  To what enchantress had I not recourse  For skill in herbs and magick arts renown'd  No remedy in their vain arts I found  Tell silver Phoebe tell whence sprung my flame  Tell for you know whence the dire passion came  With sickness wasted and with grief opprest  Thus to my servant I at last confest  Haste Thestylis thy dying mistress sends  My health on Delphis and my life depends  Delphis who gave alone can cure the wound  No remedy for love but love is found  In active sports and wrestling he delights  And in the bright Palaestra often sits  Tell silver Phoebe tell whence sprung my flame  Tell for you know whence the dire passion came  There watch your time and softly let him know  Simaetha sent you then my lodgings show  She did and straight his sounding feet I heard  Gods but when lovely Delphis first appear'd  Tell silver Phoebe tell whence sprung my flame  Tell for you know whence the dire passion came  A deathlike cold seiz'd on me from my brow  Like southern dew the liquid drops did flow  Stiff and unmov'd I lay and on my tongue  My dying words when I would speak them hung  As when imperfect sounds from children fall  When in their dreams they on their mother call  Tell silver Phoebe tell whence sprung my flame  Tell for you know whence the dire passion came  The cruel man sat down upon my bed  And then with eyes cast downward thus he said  In love you are as far before me gone  As young Philinus lately I outrun  Tell silver Phoebe tell whence sprung my flame  Tell for you know whence the dire passion came  Had not your kinder message call'd me home  By love's sweet joys at night I would have come  Arm'd with my friends I had beset you round  And my victorious head with poplar crown'd  Tell silver Phoebe tell whence sprung my flame  Tell for you know whence the dire passion came  Had you admitted me it had been well  For I in swiftness and in form excel  But that my vanquish'd equals best may tell  Some smaller favour then I had desir'd  And modestly but with a kiss retir'd  Had you been cruel and your doors been barr'd  With bars and torches for the storm I was prepar'd  Tell silver Phoebe tell whence sprung my flame  Tell for you know whence the dire passion came  Now thanks to you great queen of love I owe  And next my fair preserver next to you  She saw the burning pain which I endure  And recommends to you the mighty cure  For cool and gentle are all other fires  Compar'd with those which cruel Love inspires  Tell silver Phoebe tell whence sprung my flame  Tell for you know whence the dire passion came  Love tender maids can from their beds excite  Nor darkness them nor danger can affright  Love's mighty power can the young wife compel  From her warm sleeping husband's arms to steal  He said and I a fond believing maid  Press'd and reclin'd him gently on my bed  Now a new heat return'd with his embrace  Warmth to my blood and colour to my face  And to be short with mutual kisses fir'd  To the last bliss we eagerly aspir'd  And both attain'd what both alike desir'd  Now swift the hours and wing'd with pleasure flew  Calm were our passions and no tempest knew  No quarrel could disturb our peaceful bed  But all those joys this fatal morning fled  Aurora scarce had chac'd away the night  And o'er the world diffus'd her rosy light  Philista's mother came and as she still  The love and news o' th' town delights to tell  She told me first that Delphis lov'd but who  She could not tell but that he lov'd she knew  All signs of some new love she said she found  His house adorn'd and doors with garlands crown'd  She tells me true oh my illboding fears  And Delphis' treachery too plain appears  His visits were more frequent now at last  Since he was here twelve tedious days are past  'Tis so and can he then so cruel prove  And I so soon forgotten and my love  Now I 'm content to see what charms can do  But if he dares go on to use me so  Provok'd at last a potion I'll prepare  That by his death shall ease me of my care  So sure the poison and so strong the draught  The secret was by an Assyrian taught  You Cynthia now may to the sea decline  And to the rising sun your light resign  My charm 's now done and has no longer force  To fix your chariot or retard your course  I what I can't redress must learn to bear  And a sad cure attend from my despair  Adieu O moon and every glimmering light  Adieu ye gay attendants on the night  HORACE BOOK II ODE XV IMITATED  BY MR KNIGHTLEY CHETWOOD  A gentleman of an ancient family and afterwards DD In the summer of he was nominated by James II to the see of Bristol then vacant on Dr Trelawney's promotion to Exeter but declined the offer He was installed dean of Gloucester April and about the same time was made chaplain to the English forces in Flanders under the duke of Marlborough He died April He was author of the ingenious and learned dissertation prefixed to Dryden's Virgil in and of a variety of little poems dispersed in different collections N    THEN this unwieldy factious town  To such prodigious bulk is grown  It on whole counties stands and now  Land will be wanting for the plough  Those remnants too the Boors forsake  Frith must the nation undertake  As in a plague the fields shall desart lie  Whilst all men to the mighty pesthouse fly  II  If any tree is to be seen  'Tis myrtle bays and evergreen  Limetrees and plane for pleasure made  Which for their fruit bear only shade  Such as do female men content  With useless shew and barren scent  The British oak will shortly be as rare  As orangetrees here once or cedar were  III  Not by these arts my masters sure  Your fathers did those lands procure  They preferr'd use to empty shew  No softening French refinements knew  Themselves their house their table plain  Noble and richly clad their train  Temperance did health without physicians keep  And labour crown'd hard beds with easy sleep  IV  To th' publick rich in private poor  The exchequer held their greatest store  They did adorn their native place  With structures which their heirs deface  They in large palaces did dwell  Which we to undertakers sell  Stately cathedrals they did found  Whose ruins now deform the ground  Churches and colleges endow'd with lands  Whose poor remains fear sacrilegious hands  THE EIGHTH ECLOGUE OF VIRGIL  BY THE SAME  I Damon and Alpheus' loves recite  The shepherds envy and the fields delight  Whom as they strove the listening heifers stood  Greedy to hear forgetful of their food  They charm'd the rage of hungry wolves and led  The wandering rivers from their wonted bed  I Damon and Alpheus' loves recite  The shepherds envy and the fields delight  And you great prince whose empire unconfin'd  As earth as seas yet narrower than your mind  Whether you with victorious troops pass o'er  Timavus' rocks or coast th' Illyrian shore  Shall I beginning with these rural lays  Ever my Muse to such perfection raise  As without rashness to attempt your praise  And through the subject world your deeds rehearse  Deeds worthy of the majesty of verse  My first fruits now I to your altar bring  You with a riper Muse I last will sing  Meanwhile among your laurel wreaths allow  This ivy branch to shade your conquering brow  Scarce had the sun dispell'd the shades of night  Whilst dewy browze the cattle does invite  When in a mournful posture pale and wan  The luckless Damon thus his plaints began  Thou drowsy star of morning come away  Come and lead forth the sacred lamp of day  Whilst I by Nisa baff  ed and betray'd  Dying to heaven accuse the perjur'd maid  But prayers are all lost breath the powers above  Give dispensations for false oaths in love  Begin with me my flute begin such strains  As Pan our patron taught th' Arcadian swains  'Tis a most blessed place that Arcady  And shepherds bless'd who in those coverts lie  Musick and love is all their business there  Pan doth himself part in those concerts bear  The vocal pines with clasping arms conspire  To cool the sun's and fan their amorous fire  Begin with me my flute begin such strains  As Pan our patron taught th' Arcadian swains  Mopsus does Nisa a cheap conquest gain  Presented woo'd betroth'd to me in vain  What hour secure what respite to his mind  In this false world can a poor lover find  Let griffins mares and eagles turtles woo  And tender fawns the ravening dogs pursue  These may indeed subject of wonder prove  But nothing to this prodigy of love  Mopsus buy torches Hymen you must join  Bespeak our bridecake Hesperus all is thine  Begin with me my flute begin such strains  As Pan our patron taught th' Arcadian swains  A worthy match and just reward of pride  Whilst you both Damon and his pipe deride  Too long my beard nor smooth enough my face  And with my person you my flocks disgrace  There are revenging gods proud nymphs there are  And injur'd love is heaven's peculiar care  Begin with me my flute begin such strains  As Pan our patron taught th' Arcadian swains  Early I walk'd one morn with careless thought  Your mother you into our garden brought  And ruddy wildings round the hedges sought  The fairest fruit and glittering all with dew  The boughs were high but yet I reach'd for you  I came I saw I gaz'd my heart away  Me and my flocks and all my life that minute led astray  Begin with me my flute begin such strains  As Pan our patron taught th' Arcadian swains  Now Love I know you for myself too late  But shepherds take ye warning by my fate  Trust not this flattering voice or smiling face  A Canibal or born in rocky Thrace  Not one of us nor like the British race  Shewolves gave suck to the pernicious boy  The shepherds he they do the flocks destroy  Begin with me my flute begin such strains  As Pan our patron taught th' Arcadian swains  Mischief is all his sport at his commands  In her son's blood Medea bath'd her hands  A sad unnatural mother she 'tis true  But Love that cruelty she learn'd of you  Begin with me my flute begin such strains  As Pan our patron taught th' Arcadian swains  Nature which with this dotage hath begun  Now into all extravagance will run  The tamarisk bright amber shall distil  And the coarse elder bear soft daffodil  Shortly the screechowl with her boding throat  The swans shall rival in their dying note  S and O the bays shall claim  And equal Dryden's and Roscommon's fame  Begin with me my flute begin such strains  As Pan our patron taught th' Arcadian swains  May the work sink with me farewell ye groves  Haunts of my youth and conscious of my loves  Down from the precipice myself I'll cast  Accept this present Nisa'tis my last  Then cease my flute for ever cease thy strains  Bid a sad silence through th' Arcadian plains  THE PRAISES

rage in vain  As Caesar's arms all nations can subdue  So Caesar's works can conquer nature too  Her very entrails veins of silver hold  And mountains are all underarch'd with gold  But her chief treasures without which the rest are vai  Are men for labour generals made to reign  She bred the Marsian who ne'er knew to yield  And tough Ligurian fit for either field  Triumphant cottagers whose frugal hand  Held both the spade and truncheon of command  Decii devoted for the public good  Compounding for whole armies with their blood  Camillus saviour of the sinking state  Who rescued Rome

and thy name  Inform me by what subtile art  What powerful influence  You got such vast dominion in a part  Of my unheeded and unguarded heart  That fame and honour cannot drive you thence  Oh mischievous usurper of my peace  Oh soft intruder of my solitude  Charming disturber of my ease  That hast my nobler fate pursued  And all the glories of my life subdued  Thou haunt'st my inconvenient hours  The business of the day nor silence of the night  That should to cares and sleep invite  Can bid defiance to thy conquering powers  Where hast thou been this livelong age  That from my birth till now  Thou never didst one thought engage  Or charm my soul with the uneasy rage  That made it all its humbler feebles know  Where wert thou O malicious sprite  When shining glory did invite  When interest call'd then thou wert shy  Nor one kind aid to my assistance brought  Nor would'st inspire one tender thought  When princes at my feet did lie  When thou could'st mix ambition with my joy  Then peevish phantom thou wert nice and coy  Not beauty would invade thee then  Nor all the arts of lavish men  Not all the powerful rhetorick of the tongue  No sacred wit could charm thee on  Not the soft play that lovers make  Nor sighs could fan thee to a fire  No pleading tears or vows could thee awake  Nor charm'd the unform'dsomethingto desire  Oft I 've conjur'd thee to appear  By youth by love by all their powers  Have search'd and sought thee every where  In silent groves in lonely bowers  On flowery beds where lovers wishing lie  In sheltering woods where sighing maids  To their assigning shepherds hie  And hide their blushes in the gloom of shades  Yet there ev'n there though youth assail'd  Where beauty prostrate lay and fortune woo'd  My heart insensible to neither bow'd  Thy lucky aid was wanting to prevail  In courts I sought thee then thy proper sphere  But thou in crouds wert stifled there  Interest did all the  oving business do  Invites the youths and wins the virgins too  Or if by chance some heart thy empire own  Ah power ingrate the slave must be undone  Tell me thou nimble fire that dost dilate  Thy mighty force through every part  What God or human power did thee create  In my till now unfacile heart  Art thou some welcome plague sent from above  In this dear form this kind disguise  Or the false offspring of mistaken love  Begot by some soft thought that feeble strove  With the brightpiercing beauties of Lysander's eyes  Yes yes tormenter I have found thee now  And found to whom thou dost thy being owe  'Tis thou the blushes dost impart  'Tis thou that tremblest in my heart  When the dear shepherd does appear  I faint and die with pleasing pain  My words intruding sighings break  Whene'er I touch the charming swain  Whene'er I gaze whene'er I speak  Thy conscious sire is mingled with my love  As in the sanctified abodes  Misguided worshipers approve  The mixing idols with their Gods  In vain alas in vain I strive  With errors which my soul do please and vex  For superstition will survive  Purer religion to perplex  Oh tell me ye philosophers in love  What can these burning feverish fits control  By what strange arts you cure the soul  And all the fiery calenture remove  Tell me ye fairones you that give desire  How 'tis you hide the kindling fire  Oh would you but confess the truth  It is not real virtue makes you nice  But when you do resist the pressing youth  'Twas want of dear desire to thaw the virginice  And while your young adorers lie  All languishing and hopeless at your feet  Raising new trophies to your chastity  Oh tell me how you do remain discreet  And not the passion to the throng make known  Which Cupid in revenge has now confin'd to one  How you suppress the rising sighs  And the soft yielding soul that wishes in your eyes  While to th' admiring crowd you nice are found  Some dear some secret youth who gives the wound  Informs you all your virtue's but a cheat  And honour but a false disguise  Your modesty a necessary slight  To gain the dull repute of being wise  Deceive the foolish world deceive it on  And veil your passion in your pride  But now I 've found your weakness by my own  From me the needful fraud you cannot hide  For though with virtue I the world perplex  Lysander finds the feeble of my sex  So Helen though from Theseus' arms she fled  To charming Paris yields her heart and bed  A SONG  I  AT dead of night when rapt in sleep  The peaceful cottage lay  Pastora left her folded sheep  Her garland crook and useless scrip  Love led the nymph astray  II  Loose and undrest she takes her flight  To a near myrtleshade  The conscious moon gave all her light  To bless her ravish'd lover's sight  And guide the loving maid  III  His eager arms the nymph embrace  And to assuage his pain  His restless passion he obeys  At such an hour in such a place  What lover could contain  IV  In vain she call'd the conscious moon  The moon no succour gave  The cruel stars unmov  d look'd on  And seem'd to smile at what was done  Nor would her honour save  V  Vanquish'd at last by powerful love  The nymph expi  ing lay  No more she sigh'd no more she strove  Since no kind stars were found above  She blush'd and dy'd away  VI  Yet blest the grove her conscious slight  And youth that did betray  And panting dying with delight  She blest the kind transporting night  And curst approaching day  ON MR WALLER  BY SIR THOMAS HIGGONS  Son of Dr Thomas Higgons some time rector of Westburgh in Shropshire He was born in that county became a commoner of St Albans Hall in the beginning of the year at the age of when he was put under the tuition of Mr Edward Corbet fellow of Merton College and lodged in the chamber under him in that house Leaving the university without a degree he retired to his native county He married the widow of Robert earl of Essex and delivered an oration at her funeral Sept  "Oratio sunebri a marito ipso more prisco laudata fuit"  is part of this lady's epitaph He married secondly Bridget daughter of Sir Bevil Greenvill of Stow and sister to John earl of Bath and removed to Grewell in Hampshire was elected a burgess for Malmsbury in and for New Windsor in His services to the crown were rewarded with a pension of £ a year and gifts to the amount of £ He was afterwards knighted and in was sent envoy extraordinary to invest John George duke of Saxony with the order of the Garter About four years after he was sent envoy to Vienna where he continued three years In he was elected burgess for St Germain's "being then" says Wood  "accounted a loyal and accomplished person and a great lover of the regular clergy"  He died suddenly of an apoplexy in the king'sbench court having been summoned there as a witness November and was buried in Winchester cathedral near the relicks of his first wife His literary productions are "A Panegyric to the King " fol "The Funeral Oration on his first Lady " "The History of Isoof Bassa " He also translated into English "The Venetian Triumph" for which he was complimented by Waller in his Poems p who has also addressed a poem to  Mrs  Higgons p Mr Granger who styles Sir Thomas  "a gentleman of great merit"  was favoured by the dutchess dowager of Portland with a manuscript copy of his Oration and concludes from the great scarcity of that pamphlet that  "the copies of it were for certain reasons industriously collected and destroyed though few pieces of this kind have less deserved to perish The countess of Essex had a greatness of mind which enabled her to bear the whole weight of infamy which was thrown upon her but it was nevertheless attended with a delicacy and sensibility of honour which poisoned all her enjoyments Mr Higgons had said much and I think much to the purpose in her vindication and was himself fully convinced from the tenor of her life and the words which the spoke at the awful close of it that the was perfectly innocentIn reading this interesting oration I fancied myself standing by the grave of injured innocence and beauty was sensibly touched with the pious affection of the tenderest and best of husbands doing public and solemn justice to an amiable and worthy woman who had been grossly and publicly defamed Nor could I withhold the tribute of a tear a tribute which I am confident was paid at her interment by every one who loved virtue and was not destitute of the feelings of humanity This is what I immediately wrote upon reading the oration If I am wrong in my opinion the benevolent  ader I am sure will forgive me It is not the first time that my heart has got the better of my judgment"  I am not afraid of being censured for having transcribed this beautiful passage N    THOUGH I can add but little to his name  Whose Muse hath given him such immortal fame  Yet in the crowd of those who dress his hearse  I come to pay the tribute of a verse  Athens and Rome when learning flourish'd most  Could never such a finish'd poet boast  Whose matchless softness in the English tongue  Outdoes what Horace or Anacreon sung  Judgment does some to reputation raise  And for invention others wear the bays  He possess'd both with such a talent still  As shew'd not only force of wit but skill  So faultless was his Muse 'tis hard to know  If he did more to art or nature owe  Read where you will he's musick all along  And his sense easy as his thought is strong  Some striving to be clear fall flat and low  And when they think to mount obscure they grow  He is not darker for his lofty flight  Nor does his easiness depress his height  But still perspicuous wheresoe'er he fly  And like the sun is brightest when he's high  Ladies admire and taste his gentle vein  Which does the greatest statesmen entertain  His verses do all sorts of readers warm  Philosophers instruct and women charm  Nor did he all men in his verse outdo  But gave the law in conversation too  He tun'd the company wheree'er he came  Still leaving with them something of his flame  He seem'd by nature made for every thing  And could harangue and talk as well as sing  Persuade in council and assemblies lead  Now make them bold and then as much afraid  Give them his passions make them of his mind  And their opinion change as he inclin'd  The English he hath to perfection brought  And we to speak are by his measures taught  Those very words which are in fashion now  He brought in credit half an age ago  Thus Petrarch mended the Italian tongue  And now they speak the language which he sung  They both like honour to their countries do  Their saints they both inimitably woo  They both alike eternity do give  And Sacharissa shall with Laura live  TO THE DUKE ON HIS RETURN    BY NATHANAEL LEE  This celebrated dramatic poet was the son of a clergyman and bred at Westminsterschool under the famous Dr Busby whence he removed to Trinity college in Cambridge became scholar upon that foundation in and proceeded AB the same year but not succeeding to a fellowship he quitted the university and came to London where he made an unsuccessful attempt to become an actor in The part he performed was Duncan in Sir William Davenant's alteration of Macbeth Failing in this design he had recourse to his pen for a support and having a genius for the drama he composed a tragedy called "Nero emperor of Rome" in which being well received he pushed on the same way producing a new play almost every year one with another till Though unsuccessful in his performance on the stage yet it is observed by Cibber that he read his pieces with a degree of excellence which astonished the most capital actors of that age Mr Lee was not only careless in his oeconomy a foible incident to the poetic race but rakishly  ravagant to that degree as to be frequently plunged into the lowest depths of misery his wit and genius were also of the same unlucky turn turgid unbridled and apt to break the bounds of sense Thus gifted by nature he left the reins loose to his imagination till at length indigence and poetical enthusiasm transported him into madness so that in November he was taken into Bedlam where he continued four years under the care of the physicians He was discharged in April being so much recovered as to be able to return to his occupation of writing for the stage And he produced two plays afterwards "The Princess of Cleve" in and "The massacre of Paris" the following year However notwithstanding the profits arising from these performances he was this year reduced to so low  n ebb that a weekly stipend of ten shillings from the thea  re royal was his chief dependance He was not so clear of his phrenzy as not to suffer some temporary relapses and  erhaps his untimely end might be occasioned by one He died this year as it is said in a drunken frolic by night in the street and was interred in the parish of St Clement Danes near Templebar He is the author of eleven plays all acted with applause and printed as soon as finished with dedications of most of them to the earls of Dorset Mulgrave Pembroke the duchesses of Portsmouth and Richmond as his patrons Mr Addison declares that among our modern English poets there was none better turned for tragedy than our author if instead of favouring the impetuosity of his genius he had restrained it and kept it within proper bounds His thoughts are wonderfully suited to tragedy but frequently lost in such a cloud of words that it is hard to see the beauty of them There is an infinite fire in his works but so involved in smoke that it does not appear in half its lustre He frequently succeeds in the passionate parts of the tragedy but more particularly where he slackens his efforts and eases the style of those epithets and metaphors in which he so much abounds His "Rival Queens" and "Theodosius or the Force of Love" still keep possession of the stage These plays excel in moving the passions especially that universal one love He is said to be particularly a master in that art and for that reason has been compared to Ovid among the ancients and to Otway among the moderns Mr Dryden prefixed a copy of commendatory verses to the Rival Queens and our author joined with that laureat in writing the tragedy of the Duke of Guise and that of Oedipus These particulars are extracted principally from the Biographical Dictionary N    COME then at last while anxious nations weep  Three kingdoms stak'd too precious for the deep  Too precious sure for when the trump of fame  Did with a direful sound your wreck proclaim  Your danger and your doubtful safety shown  It dampt the genius and it shook the throne  Your helm may now the seaborn goddess take  And soft Fa  onius safe your passage make  Strong and auspicious be the stars that reign  The day you launch and Nereus sweep the main  Neptune aloft scour all the storms before  And following Tritons wind you to the shore  While on the beach like billows of the land  In bending crowds the loyal English stand  Come then though late your right receive at last  Which heaven preserv'd in spite of fortune's blast  Accept those hearts that offer on the strand  The better half of this divided land  Venting their honest souls in tears of joy  They rave and beg you would their lives employ  Shouting your sacred name they drive the air  And fill your canvas wings with gales of prayer  Come then I hear three nations shout again  And next our Charles in every bosom reign  Heaven's darling charge the care of regal stars  Pledge of our peace and triumph of our wars  Heaven echoes come but come not sir alone  Bring the bright pregnant blessing of the throne  And if in poets charms be force or skill  We charge you O ye waves and winds be still  Soft as a sailing goddess bring her home  With the expected prince that loads her womb  Joy of this age and heir of that to come  Next her the virgin princess shines from far  Aurora that and this the Morningstar  Hail then all hail they land in Charles's arms  While his large breast the nation's angel warms  Tears from his cheeks with manly mildness roll  Then dearly grasps the treasure of his soul  Hangs on his neck and feeds upon his form  Calls him his calm after a tedious storm  O brother he could say no more and then  With heaving passion clasp'd him close again  How oft he cried have I thy absence mourn'd  But 'tis enough thou art at last return'd  Said I return'd O never more to part  Nor draw the vital warmth from Charles's heart  Once more O heaven I shall his virtue prove  His counsel conduct and unshaken love  My people too at last their error see  And make their sovereign blest in loving thee  Not but there is a stiffneck'd harden'd crew  That give not Caesar no nor God his due  Reprobate traitors tyrants of their own  Yet grudge to see their monarch on his throne  Their stubborn souls with brass rebellion barr'd  Desert the laws and crimes with treason guard  Whom IBut there he stopt and cried 'Tis past  Pity's no more this warning be their last  Then sighing said My soul's dearpurchas'd rest  Welcome O welcome to my longing breast  Why should I waste a tear while thou art by  To all extremes of friendship let us fly  Disdain the factious croud that would rebel  And mourn the men that durst in death excel  Their fates were glorious since for thee they fell  And as a prince has right his arms to wield  When stubborn rebels force him to the field  So for the loyal who their lives lay down  He dares to hazard both his life and crown  ON THE SNUFF OF A CANDLE MADE IN SICKNESS  BY MRS WHARTON  Anne daughter and coheiress of Sir Henry Lee of Ditchley in Oxfordshire who having no son left his estate to be divided between this lady and her sister Eleanor Countess of Abingdon whose memory Mr Dryden has celebrated in a funeral panegyrick Poems vol II p She was the marquis of Wharton's first wife and died without issue The earl of Rochester's mother was aunt to her father Sir Henry Lee for which reason Mr Waller in his verses on an elegy made by her on that nobleman's death in his Poems p says they were allied both in genius and in blood R    SEE there the taper's dim and doleful light  In gloomy waves silently rolls about  And represents to my dim weary sight  My light of life almost as near burnt out  Ah health best part and substance of our joy  For without thee 'tis nothing but a shade  Why dost thou partially thyself employ  Whilst thy proud foes as partially invade  What we who ne'er enjoy so fondly seek  Those who possess thee still almost despise  To gain immortal glory raise the weak  Taught by their former want thy worth to prize  Dear melancholy Muse my constant guide  Charm this coy health back to my fainting heart  Or I'll accuse thee of vainglorious pride  And swear thou dost but feign the moving art  But why do I upbraid thee gentle Muse  Who for all sorrows mak'st me some amends  Alas our sickly minds sometimes abuse  Our best physicians and our dearest friends  SONG  BY THE SAME  HOW hardly I conceal'd my tears  How oft did I complain  When many tedious days my fears  Told me I lov'd in vain  But now my joys as wild are grown  And hard to be conceal'd  Sorrow may make a silent moan  But joy will be reveal'd  I tell it to the bleating flocks  To every stream and tree  And bless the hollow murmuring rocks  For echoing back to me  Thus you may see with how much joy  We want we wish believe  'Tis hard such passion to destroy  But easy to deceive  THE LAMENTATIONS OF JEREMIAH  BY THE SAME  HOW doth the mournful widow'd city bow  She that was once so great alas how low  Once fill'd with joy with desolation now  Tears on her cheeks and sables on her head  She mourns her lovers lost and comforts dead  Alas alas lost city where are those  So proud once to be friends now turn'd her foes  Judah is gone alas to bondage gone  Amongst the Heathen Judah mourns alone  Griev'd and in servitude she finds no rest  Follow'd by none but those by whom opprest  The feasts of Zion no one now attends  Unhappy Zion destitute of friends  Her priests still sigh and all her virgins mourn  Because her gladness now finds no return  Her enemies are great and ever nigh  Still fortunate because her crimes were high  Her captiv'd children still her guilt upbraid  Who mourn whilst their insulting foes invade  Her beauty which excell'd is now no more  That brightness which all nations did adore  Her princes are like hunted harts become  Breathless and faint whilst the pursuit goes on  Alas for Zion all their strength is gone  Jerusalem then thought upon the hour  When she was crown'd with peace delight and power  Thoughts once so joyful mournful now and vain  The foe insults whilst she no helps sustain  Mocking both at her sabbaths and her pain  Her crimes have caus'd her to be far remov'd  Jerusalem who was so well belov'd  All those who in her pride admir'd her fame  Despise her now because they've seen her shame  Sighing she turns away with shame distress'd  Amaz'd despis'd deserted and oppress'd  Circled with guilt and shame she cannot fly  Her comfort's far remov'd her end too nigh  She vainly thinks on that 'tis now too late  Behold those griefs which no one can repeat  Her fall is steep and all her foes are great  Her sanctuary is by them betray'd  All her delights they carelessly invade  Even the heathen of whom God had said  They should not in her holy temple tread  Her hungry people sigh and give away  For bread their treasures lest their lives decay  Consider Lord see her with cares bow'd down  For I am vile and Zion left alone  All you who pass this way behold and see  Are my griefs small Do others grieve like me  Are not these sorrows under which I bow  With which the Lord hath brought my soul so low  Turn back and mourn with me because my Lord  In his fierce anger doth no peace afford  He from above hath flames and horror sent  Circling my soul with pain and discontent  His snares alas my weary feet betray  Whilst desolate and faint I mourn all day  For Zion lost her glory thrown away  Our sins have brought those chains which his command  Hath fasten'd now who can his power withstand  Now they are link'd by his Almighty hand  The Lord forsakes and I am now the scorn  Of enemies because of God forlorn  He was my strength and now alas 'tis gone  My mighty men are all by him cast down  They're crush'd by numbers and I'm left alone  Whilst silently thy virgin daughters mourn  Unhappy mournful Judah left forlorn  For this I weep and waste myself in tears  Because her help's far off and sorrow's near  Ah wretched Judah where is now thy hope  Thy foes still triumph whilst thy children droop  Zion spreads forth her arms to be reliev'd  But who can comfort whom the Lord hath griev'd  Her enemies increase and flourish still  By his command by his allpowerful will  Ah wretched city scorn'd and sham'd by all  Who can enough lament thy dreadful fall  Yet he is just for I am guilty found  The Lord with righteousness is always crown'd  Ye that pass by see me with sorrows drown'd  My weight of sin hath press'd me to the ground  Who is it now my freedom can restore  My youth and captive virgins are no more  I call'd for all my friends but they were gone  Friendship grows cold when misery comes on  With hunger pin'd my priests and rulers died  Within my walls perish'd my strength and guide  My crimes were great so are my sorrows now  Behold my Lord see the afflicted bow  Abroad th' unwearied sword bereaves of breath  And grief at home is a more cruel death  All round me hear my sighs and see my tears  Whilst there is none that can relieve my cares  My foes hear and rejoice at what is done  But thou wilt surely Lord at last return  And then the enemy like me will mourn  Their crimes are great turn mighty Lord and see  Afflict them then as thou afflicted me  My griefs are great turn therefore and relent  My sighs are many and my heart is faint  SONG TO A LADY WHO DISCOVERED A NEW STAR IN CASSIOPEIA  BY MR CHARLES DRYDEN  Eldest son of  "the great high priest of all the Nine"  He was usher of the palace to Pope Clement XI at the time his father addressed the letter to him which Dr Johnson has given to the publick in his "Life of Dryden" p If the story related of the interruption given to his father's funeral be true Charles Dryden's conduct to lord Jefferies to whom he sent a challenge was spirited and proper See "Life of Dryden" p Charles translated the sixth satire of Juvenal and wrote several poems He was drowned in the Thames near Windsor in N    AS Ariana young and fair  By night the starry quire did tell  She found in Cassiopeia's chair  One beauteous light the rest excel  This happy star unseen before  Perhaps was kindled from her eyes  And made for mortals to adore  A newborn glory in the skies  II  Or if within the sphere it grew  Before she gaz'd the lamp was dim  But from her eyes the sparkles flew  That gave new lustre to the gem  Bright omen what dost thou portend  Thou threatening beauty of the sky  What great what happy monarch's end  For sure by thee 'tis sweet to die  III  Whether to thy foreboding fire  We owe the crescent in decay  Or must the mighty Gaul expire  A victim to thy fatal ray  Such a presage will late be shown  Before the world in ashes lies  But if less ruin will atone  Let Strephon's only fate suffice  ARIADNE'S COMPLAINT UPON A ROCK IN THE ISLAND OF NAXOS ON BEING DESERTED BY THESEUS  BY WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT  Son of Thomas Cartwright of Burford in Oxfordshire was born Aug This is the account given by Lloyd But Wood who may be supposed wellinformed says he was the son of a gentleman of broken fortune who was reduced to keep an inn at Cirencester in Gloucestershire was born at Northway near Tewksbury in September and received the early part of his education at Cirencester Freeschool being placed as a king's scholar at Westminster he was elected to Christ Church Oxford in where he took the degree of MA in The same writer informs us  "he went through the classes of Logick and Philosophy with an unwearied industry took holy orders and became the most florid and scraphical preacher in the university He was another Tully and Virgil as being most excellent for Oratory and Poetry in which faculties as also in the Greek tongue he was so full and absolute that those that best knew him knew not in which he most excelled So admirably well versed also was he in Metaphysicks that when he was Reader of them in the University the exposition of them was never better performed than by him and his predecessor Thomas Barlow of Queen's College His preaching also was so graceful and profound withal that none of his time or age went beyond him So that if the Wits read his Poems Divines his Sermons and Philosophers his Lectures on Aristotle's Metaphysicks they would scarcely believe that he died at a little above thirty years of age But that which is most remarkable is that these his high parts and abilities were accompanied with so much candour and sweetness that they made him equally beloved and admired of all persons especially those of the Gown and Court who esteemed also his life a fair copy of practic piety a rare example of heroic worth and in whom Arts Learning and Language made up the true complement of perfection"  In bishop Duppa appointed him to be succentor in the church of Salisbury and in he was chosen junior proctor of the university He was also metaphysical reader to the university Ben Jonson said of him  "My son Cartwright writes like a man"  There are extant of this author's four plays besides other poems which were printed together in accompanied by above fifty copies of commendatory verses by the wits of the university A Wood tells us Mr Cartwright wrote also Poëmata Graeca et Latina An offspring of mercy issuing out of the womb of cruelty a passion sermon preached at Christ Church in Oxford on Acts ii On the signal days in the month of November in relation to the crown and royal family a poem Poems and verses containing airs for several voices set by Mr Henry Lawes His "Royal Slave" was acted before the king and queen by his fellowstudents of Christ Church of whom the most applauded was Mr Busby afterwards the celebrated master of Westminster school Wit learning judgement elocution a graceful person and behaviour occasioned that wellknown encomium of him from dean Fell  "That he was the utmost man could come to"  This instance of the perfection of human nature was also an instance of its vanity He was suddenly snatched away by a fever in the prime of life on the twentyninth of November and had the honour to be regretted by his sovereign and his queen who were in Oxford at the time of his death See Wood and Granger Jacob says  "Cartwright was a king's scholar at Eton under Dr Olbaston eminent for learning and loyalty an excellent scholar and an admirable poet expert in the Latin Greek French and Italian languages  The wits of Oxford prefixed recommendatory verses to his WorksAfter such eulogiums it seems a kind of poetical blasphemy to annex the opinion of Dr King who says  "Cartwright's poems seem to me very indifferent"  N    THESEUS O Theseus hark but yet in vain  Alas deserted I complain  It was some neighbouring rock more soft than he  Whose hollow bowels pitied me  And beating back that false and cruel name  Did comfort and revenge my flame  Tell me ye Gods whoe'er ye are  Why O why made ye him so fair  And tell me wretch why thou  Mad'st not thy self more true  Beauty from him may copies take  And more majestic heroes make  And Falsehood learn awhile  From him too to beguile  Restore my clew  'Tis here most due  For 'tis a labyrinth of more subtle art  To have so fair a face so foul a heart  The ravenous vulture tear his breast  The rolling stone disturb his rest  Let him next feel Ixion's wheel  And add one fable more  To cursing poets store  And thenyet rather let him live and twine  His woof of days with some thread stol'n from mine  But if you'll torture him howe'er  Torture my heart you'll find him there  Till my eyes drank up his  And his drank mine  I ne'er thought souls might kiss  And spirits join  Pictures till then  Took me as much as men  Nature and art  Moving alike my heart  But his fair visage made me find  Pleasures and fears  Hopes sighs and tears  As several seasons of the mind  Should thine eye Venus on his dwell  Thou would'st invite him to thy shell  And caught by that live jet  Venture the second net  And after all thy dangers faithless he  Should'st thou but slumber would forsake ev'n thee  The streams so court the yielding banks  And gliding thence ne'er pay their thanks  The winds so woo the flowers  Whispering among fresh bowers  And having robb'd them of their smells  Fly thence perfum'd to other cells  This is familiar hate to smile and kill  Though nothing please thee yet my ruin will  Death hover hover o'er me then  Waves let your crystal womb  Be both my fate and tomb  I'll sooner trust the sea than men  And yet O nymphs below who sit  In whose swift floods his vows he writ  Snatch a sharp diamond from the richer mines  And in some mirrour grave these sadder lines  Which let some God convey  To him that so he may  In that both read at once and see  Those looks that caus'd my destiny  In Thetis' arms I Ariadne sleep  Drown'd first by my own tears then in the deep  Twice banish'd first by love and then by hate  The life that I preserv'd became my fate  Who leaving all was by him left alone  That from a monster freed himself prov'd one  That then IBut look O mine eyes  Be now true spies  Yonder yonder  Comes my dear  Now my wonder  Once my fear  See satyrs dance along  In a confused throng  While horns and pipes rude noise  Do mad their lusty joys  Roses his forehead crown  And that recrowns the flowers  Where he walks up and down  He makes the desarts bowers  The ivy and the grape  Hide not adorn his shape  And green leaves cloath his waving rod  'Tis either Theseus or some God  IN MEMORY OF THE MOST WORTHY BEN JONSON  BY THE SAME  FATHER of poets though thine own great day  Struck from thyself scorns that a weaker ray  Should twine in lustre with it yet my flame  Kindled from thine flies upwards tow'rds thy name  For in the acclamation of the less  There's piety though from it no access  And though my ruder thoughts make me of those  Who hide and cover what they should disclose  Yet where the lustre 's such he makes it seen  Better to some that draws the veil between  And what can more be hop'd since that divine  Freefilling spirit took its flight with thine  Men may have fury but no raptures now  Like witches charm yet not know whence nor how  And through distemper grown not strong but fierce  Instead of writing only rave in verse  Which when by thy laws judg'd 'twill be confess'd  'Twas not to be inspir'd but be possess'd  Where shall we find a Muse like thine that can  So well present and shew man unto man  That each one finds his twin and thinks thy art  Extends not to the gestures but the heart  Where one so shewing life to life that we  Think thou taught'st custom and not custom thee  Manners that were themes to thy scenes still flow  In the same stream and are their comments now  These times thus living o'er thy models we  Think them not so much wit as prophesy  And though we know the character may swear  A Sibyl's finger hath been busy there  Things common thou speak'st proper which though known  For public stampt by thee grow thence thine own  Thy thoughts so order'd so express'd that we  Conclude that thou didst not discourse but see  Language so master'd that thy numerous feet  Laden with genuine words do always meet  Each in his art nothing unfit doth fall  Shewing the poet like the wiseman all  Thine equal skill thus wrestling nothing made  Thy pen seem not so much to write as trade  That life that Venus of all things which we  Conceive or shew proportion'd decency  Is not found scatter'd in thee here and there  But like the soul is wholly every where  No strange perplexed maze doth pass for plot  Thou always dost untie not cut the knot  Thy labyrinth's doors are open'd by one thread  That ties and runs through all that's done or said  No power comes down with learned hat and rod  Wit only and contrivance is thy God  'Tis easy to gild gold there's small skill spent  Where ev'n the first rude mass is ornament  Thy Muse took harder metals purg'd and boil'd  Labour'd and try'd heated and beat and toil'd  Sifted the dross fil'd roughness then gave dress  Vexing rude subjects into comeliness  Be it thy glory then that we may say  Thou run'st where th' foot was hinder'd by the way  Nor dost thou pour out but dispense thy vein  Skill'd when to spare and when to entertain  Not like our wits who into one piece do  Throw all that they can say and their friends too  Pumping themselves for one term's noise so dry  As if they made their wills in poetry  And such spruce compositions press the stage  When men transcribe themselves and not the age  Both sorts of plays are thus like pictures shown  Thine of the common life theirs of their own  Thy models yet are not so fram'd as we  May call them libels and not imagery  No name on any basis 'tis thy skill  To strike the vice but spare the person still  As he who when he saw the serpent wreath'd  About his sleeping son and as he breath'd  Drinkin his soul did so the shoot contrive  To kill the beast but keep the child alive  So dost thou aim thy darts which even when  They kill the poisons do but wake the men  Thy thunders thus but purge and we endure  Thy launcings better than another's cure  And justly too for th' age grows more unsound  From the fool's balsam than the wise man's wound  No rotten talk breaks for a laugh no page  Commenc'd man by th' instructions of thy stage  No bargaining line there no provoc'tive verse  Nothing but what Lucretius might rehearse  No need to make good countenance ill and use  The plea of strict life for a looser Muse  No woman rul'd thy quill we can descry  No verse born under any Cynthia's eye  Thy star was judgement only and right sense  Thy self being to thy self an influence  Stout beauty is thy grace stern pleasures do  Present delights but mingle horrors too  Thy Muse doth thus like Jove's fierce girl appear  With a fair hand but grasping of a spear  Where are they now that cry thy lamp did drink  More oil than th' author wine while he did think  We do embrace their slander thou hast writ  Not for dispatch but fame no marketwit  'Twas not thy care that it might pass and sell  But that it might endure and be done well  Nor would'st thou venture it unto the ear  Until the file would not make smooth but wear  Thy verse came season'd hence and would not give  Born not to feed the author but to live  Whence 'mong the choicer judges rose a strife  To make thee read as classic in thy life  Those that do hence applause and suffrage beg  'Cause they can poems form upon one leg  Write not to time but to the poet's day  There's difference between fame and sudden pay  These men sing kingdoms fall as if that fate  Us'd the same force t' a village and a state  These serve Thyestes' bloody supper in  As if it had only a sallad been  Their Catilines are but fencers whose fights rise  Not to the fame of battle but of prize  But thou still putt'st true passions on dost write  With the same courage that tried captains fight  Giv'st the right blush and colour unto things  Low without creeping high without loss of wings  Smooth yet not weak and by a thorough care  Big without swelling without painting fair  They wretches while they cannot stand to fit  Are not wits but materials of wit  What though thy searching wit did rake the dust  Of time and purge old metals of their rust  Is it no labour no art think they to  Snatch shipwrecks from the deep as divers do  And rescue jewels from the covetous sand  Making the sea's hid wealth adorn the land  What though thy culling Muse did rob the store  Of Greek and Latin gardens to bring o'er  Plants to thy native soil their virtues were  Improv'd far more by being planted here  If thy still to their essence doth refine  So many drugs is not the water thine  Thefts thus become just works they and their grace  Are wholly thine thus doth the stamp and face  Make that the king's that 's ravish'd from the mine  In others then 'tis ore in thee 'tis coin  Blest life of authors unto whom we owe  Those that we have and those that we want too  Thou'rt all so good that reading makes thee worse  And to have writ so well's thine only curse  Secure then of thy merit thou didst hate  That servile base dependance upon fate  Success thou ne'er thought'st virtue nor that fit  Which chance and th' age's fashion did make hit  Excluding those from life in aftertime  Who into poetry first brought luck and rhyme  Who thought the people's breath good air styl'd name  What was but noise and getting briefs for fame  Gather'd the many's suffrages and thence  Made commendation a benevolence  Thy thoughts were their own laurel and did win  That best applause of being crown'd within  And though th' exacting age when deeper years  Had interwoven snow among thy hairs  Would not permit thou should'st grow old 'cause they  Ne'er by thy writings knew thee young we may  Say justly they're ungrateful when they more  Condemn'd thee 'cause thou wert so good before  Thine art was thine art's blur and they 'll confess  Thy strong perfumes made them not smell thee less  But though to err with thee be no small skill  And we adore the last draughts of thy quill  Though th  se thy thoughts which the now queasy age  Doth count but clods and refuse of the stage  Will come up porcelainwit some hundreds hence  When there will be more manners and more sense  'Twas judgement yet to yield and we afford  Thy silence as much fame as once thy word  Who like an aged oak the leaves being gone  Wast food before art now religion  Thought still more rich though not so richly stor'd  View'd and enjoy'd before but now ador'd  Great soul of numbers whom we want and boast  Like curing gold most valued now thou '  t lost  When we shall feed on refuse offals when  We shall from corn to acorns turn again  Then shall we see that these two names are one  Jonson and Poetry which now are gone  A NEW CATCH  WOULD you know how we meet o'er our jolly full bowls  As we mingle our liquors we mingle our souls  The sweet melts the sharp the kind sooths the strong  And nothing but friendship grows all the night long  We drink laugh and celebrate every desire  Love only remains our unquenchable fire  THE PARTING OF HECTOR AND ANDROMACHE  BY DR CHETWOOD  See two poems by Dr Chetwood with some account of him p seq The MSS of Mr Baker have since furnished me with the following memoranda  "Knightley Chetwood extraordinariè electus born at Coventry came into the place of Tho Brinley chaplain to the lord Dartmouth to the princess of Denmark and to king James II prebend of Wells rector of Broad Rissington in Gloucestershire archdeacon of York nominated bishop of Bristol by king James just before his abdication went afterwards chaplain to all the English forces into Holland under the earl of Marlborough commenced DD Dean of Gloucester"  Harl MS p King James quitted the kingdom before Dr Chetwood's election to Bristol passed the seals He had an hereditary claim Jacob says to an ancient barony and seat in the house of lords N    HECTOR though warn'd by an approaching cry  That to Troy walls the conquering Greeks drew nigh  T' his princess one short visit pays in haste  Some daemon told him this would be his last  Her swiftly passing through the spacious streets  He nor at home nor in the circle meets  Nor at Minerva's  The temple of Minerva C  where the beauteous train  Made prayers and vows to angry powers in vain  She half distracted with the loud alarms  The prince was carry'd in his nurse's arms  Runs to a turret whose commanding height  Presented all the battle to her sight  Advancing Grecians and the Trojans flight  Here Hector finds her with a lover's pace  She speeds and breathless sinks in his embrace  The nurse came after with her princely care  As Hesperus fresh promising and fair  Hector in little with paternal joy  He blest in silent smiles the lovely boy  The princess at his sight compos'd again  Pressing his hand does gently thus complain  My dearest lord believe a careful wife  You are too lavish of your precious life  You foremost into every danger run  Of me regardless and your little son  Shortly the Greeks what none can singly do  Will compass pointing all the war at you  But before that day comes heavens may I have  The mournful privilege of an early grave  For I of your dear company bereft  Have no reserve no second comfort left  My father who did in Cilicia reign  By fierce Achilles was in battle slain  His arms that savage conqueror durst not spoil  But paid just honours to his funeral pile  Woodnymphs about his grave have planted since  A rural monument to a mighty prince  Seven brothers who seven legions did command  Had the same fate from the same murdering hand  My mother too who their sad heir did reign  With a vast treasure was redeem'd in vain  For she soon clos'd her empire and her breath  By wretches' last good fortunesudden death  Thus father mother brethren all are gone  But they seem all alive in you alone  To gain you those endearments I have

replied This you have said and more  I have revolv'd in serious thoughts before  But I not half so much those Grecians fear  As carpetknights statedames and flatterers here  For they if ever I decline the fight  Miscall wise conduct cowardice and flight  Others may methods chuse the most secure  My life no middle courses can endure  Urg'd by my own and my great father's name  I must add something to our ancient fame  Embark'd in Ilium's cause I cannot fly  Will conquer with it or must for it die  But still som  boding genius does po  tend  To all my toils an unsuccessful end  For how can man with heavenly powers contend  The day advances with the swiftest pace  Which Troy and all her glories shall deface  Which Asia's sacred empire shall confound  And these proud towers lay level with the ground  But all compar'd with you does scarce appear  When I presage your case I learn to fear  When you by some proud conqueror shall be led  A mournful captive to a master's bed  Perhaps some haughty dame your hands shall doom  To weave Troy's downfal in a Grecian loom  Or lower yet you may be forc'd to bring  Water to Argos from Hiperia's spring  And as you measure out the tedious way  Some one shall pointing to his neighbour say  See to what fortune Hector's wife is brought  That famous general that for Ilium fought  This will renew your sorrows without end  Depriv'd in such a day of such a friend  But this is fancy or before it I  Low in the dust will with my country lie  Then to his infant he his arms address'd  The child clung crying to his nurse's breast  Scar'd at the burnish'd arms and threatening crest  This made them smile whilst Hector did unbrace  His shining helmet and disclos'd his face  Then dancing the pleas'd infant in the air  Kiss'd him and to the gods conceiv'd this prayer  Jove and ye heavenly powers whoever hear  Hector's request with a propitious ear  Grant this my child in honour and renown  May equal me wear and deserve the crown  And when from some great action he shall come  Laden with hostile spoils in triumph home  May Trojans say Hector great things hath done  But is surpass'd by his illustrious son  This will rejoice his tender mother's heart  And sense of joy to my pale ghost impart  Then in the mother's arms he puts the child  With troubled joy in flowing tears she smil'd  Beauty and grief shew'd all their pomp and pride  Whilst those soft passions did her looks divide  This scene ev'n Hector's courage melted down  But soon recovering with a lover's frown  Madam says he these fancies put away  I cannot die before my fatal day  Heaven when we first takein our vital breath  Decrees the way and moment of our death  Women should fill their heads with womens' cares  And leave to men unquestion'd mens' affairs  A truncheon suits not with a lady's hand  War is my province that in chief command  The beauteous princess silently withdrew  Turns oft and with sad wishing eyes does her lord's steps pursue  Pensive to

The letgate accounted ominous C  Scaean gate  Does his own part and leaves the rest to fate  ODE IN IMITATION OF PINDAR ON THE DEATH OF THOMAS EARL OF OSSORY  Thomas Butler earl of Ossory eldest son of the duke of Ormond He was born July and died July in the lifetime of his father leaving behind him the character of one of the best and bravest amongst the nobility "His virtue" says the writer of his life in the Biographia Britannica  "was unspotted in the centre of a luxurious court his integrity unblemished amidst all the vices of his times and his honour untainted through the course of his whole life"  R    BY THE SAME  I  WHAT strains at sacred Pisa's spring  The swan that often sung with tuneful breath  To his inchanting lyre did sing  Of God of hero or of heavenborn king  With verses cheaply purchas'd though by death  Or rather since to a pious hero we  Just though late oblations bring  What tears the Muse's prophet royal shed  On Saul's anointed head  And thought a crown poor recompence for a friend  When by a power miraculous he  The power of faith and poetry  Upon the clouds an interdict did lay  And bid Mount Gilboa  To rear his naked back parch'd to the angry sky  Such numbers priestesses of fame inspire  Such Ossory does deserve and Ormond such desire  Such Flanders' bloody plains and Mons and British seas require  And ye poetic candidates of fame  If ye would build a lasting name  This subject chuse as the dark womb  Of the old prophet's vital tomb  Could life restore so Ossory's life can give  And by his genius many an age ev'n this dead verse shall live  II  Then tell ye heavenly sisters ye can tell  For we below  In the dark vale of hearsay dwell  And nothing know  Tell when great Ossory's enlarged shade  Through heaven's arch his triumphant entry made  How noble Brutus' ancient race  To shew peculiar worth peculiar grace  Rose up and offer'd the first place  Tell how the sainted hero whom  The pious tales of fabulous Rome  Greater to make have almost nothing made  Embrac'd his successor and sware  None worthier did his mystic ensigns wear  Tell how the nymphs that with soft silver oars  Ply round the Ebude's and cold Mona's shores  Or the sea's oracle the mouth of Thames  The noble Shannon's or soft Listy's streams  Their guardian did lament and tear  Their seagreen hair  This second grief to great Pan's death th' afflicted nymphs did hear  Bid sad Juverna raise a monument  As Teneriff high wide as her isle's extent  Bid her be sure her title prove  Left her pretence as fabulous seem as lying Crete's to Jove  III  Nature with her commission brisk and gay  When the bless'd earth saluted newborn day  And the world's eye the youthful sun  Unspotted with ill sights the race did run  Profuse in birds and flowers her art did shew  She painted then the gaudy bow  But most in man whom we her abstract call  She of the precious stuff was prodigal  Her kings but few removes from Jove her princes heroes all  But now so sparingly that seed is sown  The soil spent or she covetous grown  Or vice hath spoil'd the strain or fate  Hath given the world for desperate  She hath shrunk the short dimensions of a man  And to an inch reduc'd our span  A number an inglorious rout  Faint shadows of our ancestors alas we stalk about  If by some mighty effort she  Produce at last one Ossory  Like stars which in our hemisphere  Gaz'd at half known strait disappear  So late he enters so soon quits the stage  He leaves a nation desolate and quite undoes the age  IV  Early young Ossory enter'd virtue's race  Swiftly began yet still increas'd his pace  And when no other rival he could find  Strove with himself and left himself behind  With confirm'd steps to his prince he went  Into a noble banishment  The country then of all was excellent  But sure the stars and fortune have  Small influence on the virtuous and the brave  Ev'n poison turns to wholesome meat  By virtue's strong digestive heat  The more with Hercules' stepdame Juno strove  The more she prov'd the mighty seed of Jove  The policy of  Italian rivers C  Tiber and the  Italian rivers C  Arne  The courtship of the  French rivers C  Seine and  French rivers C  Marne  What solid serious the sage  Spanish C  Hebre hath  And Germany of antient faith  With British gallantry conjoin'd  Did in the chemic furnace of his mind  A high elixir make than each more precious and refin'd  V  As when that annual chaos Winter slies  Whilst the soft Pleiades do mount the skies  And Philomel to western gales does sing  The advent of the heavenborn spring  Such joy bless'd Charles did to his subjects bring  Then many a hero whom no storms could shake  Who from his sufferings did new courage take  Dissolv'd in the soft lap of pleasure lay  As ice the winter's child in summer's day  Is by the amorous sunbeams kiss'd away  But not so Ossory crystalliz'd his mind  Fortune adverse did brave disdain'd her kind  Not Amoret to th' alcove  Or park the conscious mart of love  Not so t' a prince's levee with first light  Hastes an aspiring favourite  As you where honourable danger lay  And to the temple of high fame did mark the craggy way  VI  thy wing'd chariot quickly Muse prepare  Lo a vast fleet consumes the Eastern air  Base Hollanders Great Britain's rights invade  See what returns for liberty they made  Viperous blood but vipers we do find  Bely'd ingratitude is proper to mankind  Embark i' th' ship where Ossory goes  To check the parricidal foes  Not as the grave Venetian takes his way  With many a barge and many a gondola  Whilst painted Bucentore in state does move  And to the Adriatic maid makes love  As Jove he comes to th' Theban dame  Dreadfully gay with lightning's pointed flame  Unhappy they who to his embraces came  One would have thought t' have heard his cannon roar  Aetna were torn from the Trinacrian shore  And freed Typh  eus a new war did move  Against the upper and the nether Jove  The Nereids trembled in their watery bed  In the isles roots they hid their head  And like the Hollanders aghast from their own guardian fled  VII  But narrow is one element  Compar'd to a wellform'd soul's extent  Narrow the starry firmament  Fate brings to keep the balance of the age  With monsters equal heroes on the stage  The western Sultan powerful grows  A torrent all things overflows  But Mons in bloody characters his fatal limits shows  You check'd the monarch in his full career  Fierce Luxemburgh wondered and learnt to fear  Alas he knew not Ossory was there  Sad the ripe harvest of his fame he yields  The harvest of so many bloody fields  To merit such a conqueror long he grew  And gather'd laurels to be worn by you  Cursing just heaven dropping with bloody sweat  The sad remains withdraws of his defeat  And more than all his victories he values this retreat  VIII  Great excellence oft proves dangerous to the state  A comet virtue when hung out by fate  To itself and others ruin does create  But silent he yet active as the day  Born to command and willing to obey  Nature to him the happy temper gave  All kind he was as prosperous Love  Gentle as Venus' gentlest dove  In fight beyond a fancy'd hero brave  Thou Virgin Motherchurch  Alluding to the danger of the Protestant Religion N  which now dost ride  The swelling surges of a double tide  Safe only because dash'd on either side  O what a friend now in thy day  Hath fate in Ossory snatch'd away  And ye who holy friendship do adore  His equal you will never see before  You Ossory shall in heaven rejoin ne'er to be parted more  IX  Accursed fever death's sharppoison'd dart  Accursed fruit accursed earth  Which to the fatal tree gave birth  Which to mine of strange confusion have you laid  In the most regular breast that e'er was made  Those eyes from which swift lightning once did part  To melt the temper'd steel or harder heart  Like wafting meteors now portend  With bloodshot beams his own approaching end  The seat where honour's records lay  He was created baron Butler of Moor Park in  d was afterwards honoured with the Garter N    Where was design'd the fall of Africa  A few days before his death he was nominated commander of the expedition against Tangier being then a  earadmiral in the king's fleet N    Scarce Heaven's decrees more firmly set than they  Like parchments in the fire now shrunk away  Those  His blood C  purple waves which like the Nile  From his undiscover'd head  Health and fresh honours on its soil did shed  And bid all Egypt smile  Now with Vesuvian waves scorch all their way  And to the king  His heart C  o' th' little world a mortal tribute pay  X  Unjustly we accuse the sovereign law  Which all things to their proper place does draw  Full ripe for heaven he spurn'd the earth  The monumental seat of miscall'd birth  No art no violence can control  Though on it Ossa you and Pelion roll  Th' ascending motion of a heavenborn soul  His fever like Elias' fiery carr  Whilst the sad prophets mourn him from afar  Kindled his funeral pile into a star  Others may praise the feats of mortal breath  But I the opportunity of death  He saw not popular fury threat the stage  Nor epidemic madness seize the age  He liv'd not till his wreaths did grow  Wither'd and pale upon his brow  As Pompey and great Scipio  Few heaven's choice favourites the privilege have  To bring their fame untainted to their grave  Who the wild passions knows of humankind  Fortune and false mortality  This truth will find  When wanted most and best belov'd 'tis happiest the  to die  ON

admitted of Christ Church Oxford of which university he was afterwards chancellor He succeeded his grandfather in title and estate in and after holding many considerable posts under king William and queen Anne was attainted of high treason in and died in exile at Madrid November N    THIS Atlas gone what hero does remain  The ponderous mass of honour to sustain  'Tis you great sir his rights his

OF MR WALLER  BY MRS APHARA BEHN  Born at Canterbury in the reign of Charles I Her father whose name was Johnson being related to lord Willoughby was appointed lieutenantgeneral o  S  rinam and embarked for the West Indies with his family whilst Aphan was very young He died on his passage but his family arrived at Surinam where his daughter became acquainted with Prince Oronooko whose story she has given Soon after her return to England she was married to Mr Behn a merchant of Dutch extraction She was employed by Charles II in in a political negotiation at Antwerp which she managed with much dexterity but her intelligence though wellsounded being disregarded she renounced all state affairs and amused herself some time with the gallantries of Antwerp and when she arrived at London dedicated the rest of her life to pleasure and poetry She published three volumes of miscellany poems the first in the second in and the third in They consist of songs and other little pieces by the earl of Rochester Sir George Etherege Mr Henry Crisp and others with some pieces of her own To the second miscellany is annexed a translation of the duke of Rochefoucault's Moral Reflections under the title of "Seneca unmasked" an edition of which was printed in in four volumes mo She wrote also seventeen plays some histories and novels and translated M Fontenelle's History of Oracles and Plurality of Worlds to which last she annexed an essay on translation and translated prose The paraphrase of Oenone's epistle to Paris in the English translation of Ovid's epistles is Mrs Behn's and Mr Dryden in his preface to that work pays her the following compliment  "I was desired to say that the author who is of the fair sex understood not Latin but if she does not I am afraid she has given us occasion to be ashamed who do"  She was also the authoress of the celebrated letters between a nobleman and his sister printed in London and we have extant of hers eight loveletters to a gentleman whom she passionately loved and with whom she corresponded under the name of Lycidas They are printed in the life and memoirs of Mrs Behn prefixed to her histories and novels She died after a long indisposition April and was buried in the Cloisters in WestminsterAbbey There are several encomiums on Mrs Behn prefixed to her "Lover's Watch" and Mr Gildon who was intimately acquainted with our poetess speaks of her in the highest terms Dr King tells us  " Astraea's lines flow on with so much ease  " That she who writes like her must surely please"  Yet pleasing as they may be the licentiousness of her dramatic pieces occasioned the just censure of Mr Pope  " The stage how loosely does Astraea tread  " Who fairly puts all characters tobed"  N    HOW to thy sacred memory shall I bring  Worthy thy fame a grateful offering  I who by toils of sickness am become  Almost as near as thou art to a tomb  While every soft and every tender strain  Is ruffled and illnatur'd grown with pain  But at thy name my languish'd Muse revives  And a new spark in the dull ashes strives  I hear thy tuneful verse thy song divine  And am inspir'd by every charming line  But oh  What inspiration at the second hand  Can an immortal elegy command  Unless like pious offerings mine should be  Made sacred being consecrate to thee  Eternal as thy own almighty verse  Should be those trophies that adorn thy hearse  The thought illustrious and the fancy young  The wit sublime the judgement fine and strong  Soft as thy notes to Sacharissa sung  Whilst mine like transitory flowers decay  That come to deck thy tomb a shortliv'd day  Such tributes are like tenures only sit  To shew from whom we hold our right to wit  Hail wondrous bard whose heavenborn genius first  My infant Muse and blooming fancy nurst  With thy soft food of love I first began  Then fed on nobler panegyric strain  Numbers seraphic and at every view  My soul extended and much larger grew  Wheree'er I read new raptures seiz'd my blood  Methought I heard the language of a god  Long did the untun'd world in ignorance stray  Producing nothing that was great and gay  Till taught by thee the true poetic way  Rough were the tracks before dull and obscure  Nor pleasure nor instruction could procure  Their thoughtless labour could no passion move  Sure in that age the poets knew not love  That charming god like apparitions then  Was only talk'dof but ne'er seen by men  Darkness was o'er the Muse's land display'd  And ev'n the chosen tribe unguided stray'd  Till by thee rescued from th' Egyptian night  They now look up and view the god of light  That taught them how to love and how to write  And to enhance the blessing heaven lent  When for our great instructor thou wert sent  Large was thy life but yet thy glories more  And like the sun didst still dispense thy power  Producing something wondrous every hour  And in thy circulary course didst see  The very life and death of poetry  Thou saw'st the generous Nine neglected lie  None listening to their heavenly harmony  The world being grown to that low ebb of sense  To disesteem the noblest excellence  And no encouragement to prophets shown  Who in past ages got so great renown  Though fortune elevated thee above  Its  eauty gratitude or fickle love  Yet sullen with the world untir'd by age  Scorning th' unthinking crowd thou quitt'st the stage  A PROLOGUE  BY SIR CHARLES SEDLEY  Son of Sir John Sedley of Aylesford in Kent where  e was born about the year At years of age he was a fellow commoner of Wadham college Oxford and returned to his own country without taking any degree At the Restoration he came to London commenced wit courtier poet and gallant and was so much esteemed as to be a kind of oracle among the poets Whilst the reputation of his wit increased he became poor and debauched his estate was impaired and his morals much corrupted In being fined five hundred  ounds for a riot in Bowstreet he became more serious and applied to politicksHis daughter Catharine having been mistress to James II before he ascended the throne was created countess of Dorchester Jan and on that king's abdication she married the earl of Pe  more Sir Charles who looked upon the title as a splendid indignity purchased at the expence of his daughter's honour was extremely active in bringing about the Revolution fre  a principle of gratitude as he said himself  "for since his majesty has made my daughter a countess it is fit I should do all I can to make his daughter a queen"  He died Aug His works which hear great marks genius and consist of speeches political pieces translation from Virgil and Horace poems songs and five plays were printed in vols vo and again in Among  them is a comedy called "The Mulberry Garden" acted at the Theatre Royal That garden is also mentioned in several other comedies of the last century And Dr King in his "Art of Cookery" ver observes  " A princely palace on that space does rise  " Where Sedley's noble Muse found Mulberries"  At the representation of his comedy of "Bellamira" the roof of the playhouse sell down by which Sir Charles and a few others were hurt His merry friend Sir Fleetwood Shepheard observed to him on this occasion  "There was so much fire in his play that it blew up the poet house and all"  "No" returned the baronet  "the play was so  heavy  it broke down the house and buried the poet in his own rubbish"  Sir Carr Scrope's song which is printed in  this  volume p has from a similarity of their initials been erroneously ascribed to Sir Charles Sedley N    ENVY and faction rule the grumbling age  The state they cannot but they shake the stage  This barren trade some would engross still hoping  From our poor port to banish interloping  And like the plodding lawyers take great care  To elbow blooming merit from the bar  In every age there were a sort of men  A  you do now damn'd all was written then  Thousands before them less provoke their pride  Than one poor rival straining by their side  Such vermincriticks we expect to find  For nature knows not how to lose a kind  The stinking polecat or the mole that's blind  But against old as well as new to rage  Is the peculiar frenzy of this age  Shakespeare must down and you must praise no more  Soft Desdemona nor the jealous Moor  Shakespeare whose fruitful genius happy wit  Was fram'd and finish'd at a lucky hit  The pride of nature and the shame of schools  Born to create and not to learn from rules  Must please no more his bastards now deride  Their father's nakedness they ought to hide  But when on spurs their Pegasus they force  Their jaded Muse is distanc'd in the course  All that is now hath been before 'tis true  But yet the art the fashion may be new  Though old materials the large palace raise  The skilful architect deserves his praise  If nothing please you are not nice but sick  'Tis want of stomach ever to dislike  On our past poets petty juries sit  The living sink beneath your present spite  As if this were the doomsday of all wit  But beaux and ladies be you not too nice  You'll break our lottery if none draw a prize  Then down go half th' arti  lery of your eyes  For this one night do as kind lovers use  Tie up strict judgement and let fancy loose  ON THE DEATH OF KING CHARLES II  BY MR WILLIAM BOWLES  Son of William and Bridget He was born at Hagley in Worcestershire September educated at Eton school and elected from that foundation to a scholarship in King's College Cambridge Dec He went out BA Oct and Master at the usual time following viz about In he and others were delegated by the senate to advise the vicechancellor to offer a petition to his majesty to revoke his mandate to Father Alban Francis a Benedictine monk for his degree of MA without taking the usual oath which had its effect In February he married Mrs Abigail Southal d  ghter to Mr George Southal rector of Endfield in Staffordshire was presented to that rectory and resigned his fellowship of King's College June His resignation is sealed with a griffin segreant but it does not seem to be meant for coat armour and is witnessed by William  owles senior Samuel and Thomas Palmer On the th of August Willis's Cath vol I p he was collated by W Lloyd bishop of Litchfield to the prebend of Gaia M  nor in his cathedral which he vacated by his death in His elder brother Henry Bowles fellow of King's College also succeeded him in the living of Endfield He was e  eemed a most complete scholar and a great poet Carter in his "History of Cambridge" p says from  information that  "he wrote several poems and translations"  I am indebted to the kind communication of the Reverend Mr Cole for most of the above particulars to which Mr Baker's valuable MSS enable me to add that  "  Henry  Bowles was born at Hagley in the county of Worcester moderator in the sophisters schools anno senior fellow schoolmaster at Stourbridge in Worcestershire bursar and proctor viceprovost succeeded his brother in the rectorship of Endfield"  and that  "  William  Bowles brother to Henry was born in the same place married and resigned being beneficed at Endfield in Worcestershire q Staffordshire died "  Mr William Bowles the antiquary possibly their father died Feb N    AH where protecting Providence ah where  Those guardian angels and that watchful care  That

father's blood  Nor just revenge for injur'd virtue could  The native sweetness of his mind control  Or change the godlike temper of his soul  Contending rebels seem'd in vain to strive  They could not more offend than he forgive  A nobler triumph and more glorious far  Than all the trophies of destructive war  For mercy does a bloodless conquest find  And with sweet force the rudest passions bind  The gaping wounds of civil rage he mourn'd  And sav'd his country first and then adorn'd  Our dreadful navy does in triumph ride  And the world's riches flow with every tide  And as those flying

cloud we saw at last withdrawn  And a new morn of triumphs seem'd to dawn  Th' auspicious prospect did bright years foreshow  And golden times in long succession seem'd to flow  Once more he did our civil jars compose  And gain'd new glories from his pardon'd foes  No private passion to revenge could draw  But justice govern'd and impartial law  So just yet so indulgently severe  Like heaven he pitied those he could not spare  And forc'd to draw the necessary sword  The sad effects of their own crimes abhorr'd  Now just success the royal conduct crown'd  And stubborn factions their great sovereign own'd  But ah black shades his sacred head surround  Nor dost thou fall unwept three kingdoms groan  And in their ruler's fate bewail their own  Justice and equal government are things  That subjects make more happy than their kings  Thy fame best prince if poets can divine  Shall the great troublers of the world outshine  Successful robberies their titles swell  But thine from justice rise and doing well  Thy deathless cares beyond short life extend  And nobly to succeeding times descend  And that false claims and rising wars might cease  Secur'd succession and secur'd our peace  Thy latest toil how barbarous was the rage  That of such heroes would deprive our age  What wonders may we from that prince expect  Whose private valour could our isle protect  Whom such amazing

epithalamium of Peleus and Thetis describes the genial bed on which was wrought the story of Theseus and Ariadne and on that occasion makes a long digression part of which is the subject of the following poem  THERE on th' extremest beach and farthest sand  Deserted Ariadne seem'd to stand  Newwak'd and raving with her love she flew  To the dire shore from whence she might pursue  With longing eyes but all alas in vain  The winged bark o'er the tempestuous main  For buried in fallacious sleep she lay  While through the waves false Theseus cut his way  Regardless of her fate who sav'd his youth  Winds bore away his promise and his truth  Like some wild Bacchanal unmov'd she stood  And with fix'd eyes survey'd the raging flood  There with alternate waves the sea does roll  Nor less the tempests that distract her soul  Abandon'd to the winds her flowing hair  Rage in her soul exprest and wild despair  Her rising breasts with indignation swell  And her loose robes disdainfully repel  The shining ornaments that drest her head  When with the glorious ravisher she fled  Now at her mistress' feet neglected lay  Sport of the wanton waves that with them play  But she nor them regards nor waves that beat  Her snowy legs and wound her tender feet  On Theseus her lost senses all attend  And all the passions of her soul depend  Long did her weaker sense contend in vain  She sunk at last beneath the mighty pain  With various ills beset and stupid grown  She lost the power those ills ev'n to bemoan  But when the first assault and fierce surprize  Were past and grief had found a passage at her eyes  With cruel hands her snowy breast she wounds  Theseus in vain through all the shore resounds  Now urg'd by love she plunges in the main  And now draws back her tender feet again  Thrice she repeats the vain attempt to wade  Thrice fear and cold her shivering limbs invade  Fainting at last she hung her beauteous head  And fixing on the shore her eyes she said  Ah cruel man and did I leave for thee  My parents friends for thou wast all to me  And is my love and is my faith thus paid  Oh cruelty unheard a wretched maid  Here on a naked shore abandon'd and betray'd  Betray'd to mischiefs of which death 's the least  And plung'd in ills too great to be exprest  Yet the Gods will the Gods contemn'd by you  With vengeance thy devoted ship pursue  O'ertake thy sails and rack thy guilty breast  And with new plagues th' illomen'd flight infest  But though no pity thy stern breast could move  Nor angry Gods nor illrequired love  Yet sense of honour sure should touch thy heart  And shame from low unmanly flight divert  With other hopes my easy faith you fed  A glorious triumph and a nuptial bed  But all those joys with thee alas are fled  Let no vain woman vows and oaths believe  They only with more form and pomp deceive  To compass their lewd ends the wretches swear  Of oaths profuse nor Gods nor temples spare  But when enjoy'd  Nor broken vows nor angry heaven they fear  But O ye women warn'd by me be wise  Turn their false oaths on them their arts their lies  Dissemble fawn weep swear when you betray  Defeat the gamesters at their own foul play  Oh banish'd faith but now from certain death  I snatch'd the wretch and sav'd his perjur'd breath  His life with my own brother's blood I bought  And love by such a cruel service sought  By me preserv'd yet me he does betray  And to wild beasts expose an easy prey  Nor thou of royal race nor human stock  Wast born but nurs'd by bears and issued from a rock  Too plain thou dost thy dire extraction prove  Who death for life return'st and hate for love  Yet he securely sails and I in vain  Recal the fled and to deaf rocks complain  Unmov'd they stand yet could they see and hear  More human would than cruel man appear  But I  Must the sad pleasure of compassion want  And die unheard and lose my last complaint  Happy ye gods too happy had I liv'd  Hadst thou O charming stranger ne'er arriv'd  Dissembled sweetness in thy look does shine  But ah th' inhuman monsters lurk within  What now remains or whom shall I implore  In a wild isle on a deserted shore  Shall I return and beg my father's aid  My father's whom ingrateful I betray'd  And with my brother's cruel murderer fled  But Theseus Ariadne 's constant kind  Kind as the seas and constant as the wind  See wretched maid vast seas around thee roar  And angry waves beat the resounding shore  Cut off thy hopes and intercept thy flight  No ship appears to bless thy longing sight  The dismal isle no human footstep bears  But a sad silence doubles all my fears  And fate in all its dreadful shapes appears  Ev'n fainting nature scarce maintains the strife  Betwixt prevailing death and yielding life  Yet ere I die revenging gods I'll call  And curse him first and then contented fall  Ascend ye furies then ascend and hear  My last complaints and grant my dying prayer  Which grief and rage for illrewarded love  And the deep sense of his injustice move  Oh suffer not my latest words to fly  Like common air and unregarded die  With vengeance his dire treachery pursue  For vengeance goddesses attends on you  Terror with you despair and death appear  And all the frightful forms the guilty fear  May his proud ship by furious billows tost  On rocks or some wild shore like this be lost  There may he fall or late returning see  If so the Gods and so the Fates decree  A mournful house polluted by the dead  And furies ever wait on his  He carried away her sister Phaedra B  incestuous bed  Jove heard and did

imitation of it in the manner of Spenser in "The Union" p N    THEOCRITUS IDYLL XX  BY THE SAME  PROUD Eunica when I advanc'd to kiss  Laugh'd loud and cried How ignorant he is  Alas poor man dare you a wretched swain  Lips such as these and such a mouth prophane  No to prevent your rustic freedom know  They 're unacquainted yet with such as you  But your soft lip your beard your horny fist  All charming and all suing to be kist  Your matted hair and your smooth chin invite  Conspire to make you lovely to the sight  Oh how you look how prettily you play  How soft your words and what fine things you say  Yet to prevent infection pray be gone  Your neighbourhood methinks is dangerous grown  Vanish nor dare to touch meoh the shame  He smells of the rank goats from which he came  This said with indignation thrice she spit  Survey'd me with disdain from head to feet  Then was fierce rage and conscious beauty seen  In all her motions and her haughty mien  She pray'd as if she some contagion fear'd  Cast a disdainful smile and disappear'd  My boiling blood sprang with my rage and spread  O'er all my burning face a fiery red  So roses blush when night her kindly dew has shed  I rage I curse the haughty jilt that jeer'd  My graceful person and my comely beard  Ye shepherds I conjure you tell me true  Has any god cast my old form anew  How am I chang'd for once a matchless grace  Shone in the charming features of my face  Like creeping ivy did my beard o'ergrow  And my long hair in untaught curls did flow  My brows were black and my large forehead white  My sparkling eyes shot forth a radiant light  In sweetest words did my soft language flow  As honey sweet and soft as falling snow  When with loud notes I the shrill pipe inspir'd  The listening shepherds all my skill admir'd  Me all the virgins on our mountains love  They praise my beauty and my flames approve  Such though I am yet me because a swain  How nice these townbred women are how vain  Gay Eunica rejected with disdain  And she it seems has never heard or read  How Bacchus now a god a flock once fed  Venus herself did the profession grace  By love transform'd into a country lass  The Phrygian fields and woods her flames can tell  And how her muchbewail'd Adonis fell  How oft on Latmos did the moon descend  From her bright chariot to her Carian friend  And absent from the sky whole nights with him did spend  To shining in her orb prefer her love  Stoop and desert her glorious seat above  And was not he a shepherd sure he was  Yet did not she disdain his low embrace  The gods' great mother too and greater Jove  Their majesty laid by could shepherds love  The Phrygian groves and conscious Ida know  What she for Atys he for Ganymede could do  But prouder Eunica disdains alone  What gods and greatest goddesses have done  Fairer it seems by much and greater she  Than Venus Cynthia or than Cybele  Oh my fair Venus may you ne'er find one  Worthy your love in country or in town  But to a virgin bed condemn'd for ever lie alone  CYNISCA'S LOVE  THEOCRITUS IDYLL XIV  BY THE SAME  THYONICUS  OH how does my dear Aeschines Oh how  Some care my friend sits heavy on thy brow  AESCHINES  Cynisca friend has shewn the fiend confest  And peace and joy are banish'd from my breast  THYONICUS  Hence this wild look and this distracted air  Staring your eyes your face o'ergrown with hair  Just such a Rosicrusian here arriv'd  Some new enthusiast sure or flood reviv'd  With such a mien he came with such a grace  So long his beard so dry so pale his face  AESCHINES  You Sir are merry but alas I find  No cure no ease to my distemper'd mind  I  ave am by a thousand furies tost  And call in vain my reason in my passion lost  THYONICUS  I always knew you jealous and severe  But does Cynisca's falsehood plain appear  AESCHINES  'Twas my ill fate or chance some friends to treat  With richest wines the board was crown'd with choicest meat  But fair Cynisca most adorn'd the feast  In all the charms of art and nature drest  Cynisca all our ravish'd senses fed  We gaz'd and we ador'd the lovely maid  With wine and beauty all our hearts were fir'd  And fair Cynisca still new joys inspir'd  Now healths we drank and as the glasses came  Such was the law each did his mistress name  Charming Cynisca too at last was prest  To name the lover in her favour blest  A woman sure she hop'd might be excus'd  The more they urg'd her she the more refus'd  Refus'd oh friend and I her lover by  Guess if my rage with wine inflam'd grew high  Silent she sat and with her eyes deny'd  Lycus is handsome tall and young they cry'd  When Lycus' name but touch'd her guilty soul  How down her cheeks the liquid globes did roll  Confus'd her look while shame and guilt apace  Shifted the whole complexion of her face  Gods with what rage was my rack'd soul surpriz'd  My curse my ruin am I then despis'd  Ingrateful and inhuman thou be gone  Go hug the man whose absence you bemoan  No more will I deluded by your charms  Cherish an absent mistress in my arms  Swiftly as swallows to their nest she fled  When unfletch'd young lie gaping and unfed  Swiftly she fled with my embraces cloy'd  Lycus  A double meaning is here intended in the original  the name of Cynisca's lover signifying likewise a wolf See Fawkes N  she long had lov'd and long enjoy'd  A public jest and known to all alas  The cuckold last perceives his own disgrace  Yet once a friend accus'd the guilty maid  And to my ears th' unheardof news convey'd  For I a muchabus'd deluded sot  The matter ne'er examin'd or forgot  Now undisturb'd unrival'd Lycus reigns  Enjoys his conquest and derides my pains  Two months are past since unregarded I  In a deserted bed and hopeless lie  Long with the mighty pain opprest I strove  But ah what remedy for injur'd love  In vain I struggle with the fierce disease  The fatal poison does my vitals seize  Yet Damon did from travel find relief  And absence soon remov'd the raging grief  In fires like mine successful Damon burn'd  Diseas'd he parted and he sound return'd  I too th' uncertain remedy will try  And to less cruel seas and rocks will fly  THYONICUS  From hence to the conclusion is rather an original poem than a translation of Theocritus who concludes with a noble poetical encomium on Ptolemy to which Mr Fawkes has annexed in prose the favourable side of his character as it is given by the historian N  For Flanders then since you're resolv'd prepare  Flanders the scene of glory and of war  Or if a better choice and nobler fire  Does greater arms and greater thoughts inspire  Hungarian rebels and unchristian foes  'Tis a vast field of honour friend oppose  By Godlike Poland borne and Lorrain soon  The Cross shall triumph o'er the waning Moon  There you the cruel ravage may admire  And Austria desolate by barbarous fire  May curse the dire effects of civil rage  Oh in what ills religion can engage  There sure with horror your diverted mind  Some truce may with this smaller passion find  AESCHINES  Cynisca oh unkind farewell I go  By thee condemn'd to distant countries know  I go where honour and where dangers call  From a

everthirsty ears  The charming musick of thy tongue  Does ever hear and ever long  That sees with more than human grace  Sweet smiles adorn thy angel face  II  But when with kinder beams you shine  And so appear much more divine  My feeble sense and dazzled sight  No more support the glorious light  And the fierce torrent of delight  Oh then I feel my life decay  My ravish'd soul then flies away  Then faintness does my limbs surprize  And darkness swims before my eyes  III  Then my tongue fails and from my brow  The liquid drops in silence flow  Then wandering fires run through my blood  And cold binds up the stupid flood  All pale and breathless then I lie  I sigh I tremble and I die  ON THE PROTECTOR'S DEATH  See Mr Waller on the same subject Poems p N    BY MR GODOLPHIN  Sidney Godolphin esq a younger brother of an ancient family in Cornwall was chosen burgess for Helston in and for several parliaments afterward was appointed a commissioner of the treasury in made secretary of state April placed at the head of the treasury Aug and created baron Godolphin of Rialton Sept On the accession of king James he was constituted lord chamberlain to the queen continued a commissioner of the treasury and was much favoured by the king who appointed him a commissioner to treat with the prince of Orange on whose advancement to the throne he was still continued a commissioner of the treasury and was four times one of the lords justices in that reign He was appointed lord treasurer by  Anne May elected knight of the Garter July created viscount Rialton and earl of Godolphin Dec dismissed from all employments Aug and died of the stone with which he had been for many years afflicted at the duke of Marlborough's seat near St Alban's Sept See the particulars of h  s political character in the "Supplement to Swift" Bp Burnet says  "He was the silentest and modestest man that was perhaps ever bred in a court"  Notwithstanding he possessed abilities of the first rate as a Statesman he was remarkably attached to Horseracing To this part of his character Mr Pope alludes Moral Essays Ep i  " Who would not praise PATRICIO's high desert  " His hand unstain'd his uncorrupted heart  " His comprehensive head all interests weigh'd  " All Europe sav'd yet Britain not betray'd  " He thanks you not his pride is in piquette  " Newmarketfame and judgement at a

lord Godolphin see Dr Percy's Reliques vol I p and "The Passion of Dido for Aeneas" was written in conjunction with Waller by Sidney Godolphin who died in February See Wood's Athenae vol II p The mistake of Jacob evidently arose from there having been  two  Sidneys N    'TIS well he's gone O had he never been  Hurry'd in storms loud as his crying sin  The pine the oak fell prostrate for his urn  That with his soul his body too might burn  Winds plucktup roots and fixed cedars move  Roaring for vengeance to the heavens above  From guilt like his great Romulus did grow  And in like tempests to the shades did go  Strange that the lofty trees themselves should fell  Without the axe so Orpheus went to hell  At his descent the stoutest oaks were cleft  And this whole wood its wonted station left  On Charles's throne the proud usurper's dead  With ruin'd England's tears about him spread  Those from our eyes his wrath and madness rent  And those alone upon his hearse are spent  Which mixt with sighs do weeping clouds outvie  And lesser storms of wind and rain supply  In battle Hercules wore the lion's skin  But our fierce tyrant wore the beast within  Whose heart was brutish more than face or eyes  And in the shape of man was in disguise  In civil broils he did us first engage  And made three kingdoms perish by his rage  Houses from widows bread from orphans reft  And his last legacy to Richard left  One fatal stroke slew justice and the cause  Of truth religion and the sacred laws  So fell Achilles by the Trojan band  Though he still sought with heaven itself in 's hand  Nor could domestic spoils confine his mind  No limits to his fury but mankind  The British youth to foreign coasts are sent  Towns to destroy but more to banishment  Who since they cannot in this isle abide  Are confin'd prisoners to the world beside  The rocks which from the world do Britain part  Were but weak bars against his harder heart  Whose thoughts nor laws nor could the ocean bind  Mad as the sea and lawless as the wind  Wherever men wherever pillage lies  Like ravenous vultures our wing'd navy flies  Under the Tropic we are understood  And bring home rapine through a purple flood  New circulations form'd our blood is hurl'd  As round the lesser so the greater world  Thus has the rebel to his country show'd  How to be slaves at home and thieves abroad  Such circuits makes the sun but not such harms  This burns the places that the other warms  Bad Phaeton a liker course did run  Spoil'd equally but less usurp'd the throne  No wonder then if we do tears allow  To him that gave us wars and ruin too  Tyrants that lov'd him grieve concern'd to see  There must be punishment for cruelty  Nature herself rejoiced at his death  And on the waters sung with such a breath  As made the sea dance higher than before  While her glad news came leaping to the shore  ON MR WALLER  BY MR THOMAS RYMER  A gentleman born in the North of England On quitting the University he became a member of Gray's Inn and succeeded Mr Shadwell as historiographer to K William III He wrote "The English Monarch" an heroic tragedy several poems and translations and "A View of the Tragedies of the last Age" which occasioned those admirable Remarks preserved in the preface to Mr Colman's edition of Beaumont and Fletcher and since by Dr Johnson in his "Life of Dryden" p On Mr Rymer's Poetry much commendation cannot be bestowed and therefore only a small portion of it is selected but he was an excellent Antiquary and Historian Some of his pieces relating to our Constitution are very good and his valuable collection of the "Foedera" c will be a lasting monument of his worth He died December N    WALLER is dead and lofty number's lost  Now English verse with nothing left to boast  May hobble on and vex good Pindar's ghost  What was it  three  and  eighty  years to live  Short is this boon to what the Muses give  They so insur'd his immortality  That scarce he knew in any kind to die  Two  ages he the sacred garland bore  Peerless in this and prince of that before  Ra  e genius his alike their glory made  In glittering courts and in the country shade  There by  four  kings belov'd how high he shone  Inseparable jewel of the crown  Yet thence no borrow'd heat or lustre got  Warm of himself and sun he wanted not  And if the diamond stood hard fortune's shock  Thanks to his  old  hereditary  rock    For all the court for all the Muse's snares  Our journals also tell his public cares  From James to James they count him o'er and o'er  In  four  successive reigns a senator  On him amidst the legislative throng  Their eyes and ears and every heart they hung  Within  those walls  if we Apollo knew  Less could he warm nor throw a shaft so true  What life what lightning blanch'd around the  chair  It was no house if Waller was not there  And that respect still to his speech or nods  As he had come from councils of the Gods  How would he tune their contradicting notes  With ready wit facilitate the votes  And in his verse so every where display  An air of something great and something gay  And like Amphion when he form'd a town  Put life in every stock and every stone  Oh had he liv'd one meeting more to sit  How would the  times  his generous mind have hit  What he so long contested for in vain  Set loose from all ecclesiastic chain  With transport he would find religion free  And now no longer a  monopoly    " Watch home and harbour nay shut up the sea  But who shall e'er with heaven our traffic stay  Or there erect a blockhouse in the way  Our stubborn body is not us'd so ill  It must no rack that foreign engine feel  And yet they bring poor conscience to the wheel  Error they scourge so children whip their top  The certain only means to keep it up"  Thus would he play and many a pointed jest  Still fling against the persecuting beast  Easy to run in endless histories  Tracing a life of one who never dies  How he the orbs of courts and councils mov'd  But Muses how he  sung  and how he  lov'd  What spirit fills his verse your care defines  Amongst the stars how Sacharissa shines  How still her altars fume with sacrifice  When gone are all the goddesses of Greece  Language and wit he rais'd to such an height  We should suspect with him the empire's fate  Did not auspicious James support the weight  This northern speech refin'd to that degree  Soft France we scorn nor envy Italy  But for a fit comparison must seek  In Virgil's Latin or in Homer's Greek  Anger is mad and choler mere disease  His Muse saw what was sweet and what would please  Still led where Nature's beauteous rays entice  Not touching vile deformities or vice  Here no chimaera skips no goblin frights  No Satyr's here nor monster else that bites  Sweetness his very vinegar allay'd  And all his snakes in ladies bosoms play'd  Nature rejoic'd beneath his charming power  His lucky hand made every thing a flower  So every  shrub  to  jessamin  improves  And rudest  holts  to goodly  myrtle  groves  Some from a  sprig  he carelessly had thrown  Have furnish'd a whole  garden  of their own  Some by a  spark  that from his  chariot  came  Take  fire  and blaze and raise a deathless name  Others a luckless imitation try  And whilst they  soar  and whilst they venture high  Flutter and flounce but have not wing to  fly    Some in loose  words  their empty fancies bind  Which whirl about with chaff before the wind  Here brave conceits in the expression fail  There  big  the  words  but with no  sense  at all  Still Waller's sense might Waller's language trust  Both pois'd and always bold and always just  None e'er may reach that strange felicity  Where thoughts are easy verse so sweet and free  Yet not descend

flourished in England His style of painting was agreeable and his colouring extremely pleasing but by being preceded by several eminent artists in his profession such as Vandyck Dobson and Lely and contemporary with Kneller his reputation was not advanced in proportion to his merit nor did his works engage the public attention so much as they really deserved A very good judge says  "He made nature his principal study without adopting the manner of any master and as far as he thought it prudent he improved or embellished it in his pictures and like many other men of genius he seems to be more respected by posterity than by the age in which he flourished"  He died in the year R  pride confine  He must be adding still some ray divine  Nor is content when he true likeness shews  Unless that glory also crown the brows  This subject Riley this for long has he  Scour'd the bright roads of immortality  New rapture wants no human touch can reach  His laurels and poetic triumph's pitch  On face and outside stay thy bold design  'Tis sacred 'tis Apollo's all within  Thou may'st slight sketches of the surface shew  Not vex the mine whence godlike treasures flow  Came twenty nymphs his Muse contented all  None went away without her golden ball  The Gods of old were not so liberal  How many free from fate enjoy his song  Drink nectar ever gay and ever young  Though to thy genius no attempt is vain  Think not to draw the poet but the man  Yet Riley thus our endless fame must share  His generous pen thy pencil shall prefer  It draw him man and he make it a star  THE DESERTED SWAIN  THE Muses darling pride of all the plains  Daphnis the soft the sweetest of the swains  Long reign'd in love for every nymph he view'd  He caught he only look'd and he subdued  But now the melancholy youth retires  Through shady groves and wanders through the briars  Sad and alone at last beneath a shade  Of spreading elm and beech supinely laid  He sigh'd he shook his head and thus he said  " When I so long so faithfully did woo  And did what constancy and truth could do  Why is my suit refus'd my prayers in vain  And warm endeavours damp'd by cold disdain  Must slights the lean rewards of virtue prove  Unhappy Daphnis fatal in thy love  Long drought the flowers and storms the labouring bee  And unsuccessful love hath ruin'd thee  This heaven had I observ'd the omen well  As conscious of my fate did oft foretell  It shew'd my flattering hope should disappear  And wafte like vapours tost in flitting air  Last night when careful of my flocks I went  To see my lambs were fed and folds were pent  A flame shone round my head but soon the light  Decay'd and all around stood deepest night  But is Urania so averse to love  Could none of all the rival shepherds move  Ah Aegon how I envy thy success  Thy fortune greater though thy charms were less  Without a long fatigue and tedious suit  The door was open'd and you reach'd the fruit  Oh how I pine at thy surprizing joys  Die Daphnis she is partial in her choice  Yet once I hop'd what cannot love persuade  More kind returns from the obliging maid  Her looks were soft smiles on her cheeks did lie  No cloudy frowns obscur'd the pleasing sky  Nor could I think that e'er the time would come  When constant love should prove the lover's doom  The flowers I pluckt the garlands which I wove  She took and wore as badges of my love  She heard m  songs nor did my art contemn  And sometimes she would stoop to be my theme  Damaetas envy'd Colin tun'd my lays  Whilst she sate by and gladly heard her praise  Sooner shall dolphins o'er the mountains swim  Does graze on floods and bees forget their thyme  Than I that day when with a smile she led  The joyful Aegon to her promis'd bed  With what a high disdain he march'd along  And proudly look'd on the despairing throng  Yet he ne'er fed the flocks ne'er pent the fold  Nor bore the summer's heat nor winter's cold  But he had wealth and that alone betray'd  The heedless mind of the unthinking maid  Curst be the wretch that first did gold dispense  And robd'd the happy plains of innocence  Am I refus'd because my suit was plain  The artless courtship of an humble swain  You know me not nor yet the pains I took  Whilst Aegon slept to feed the weary flock  How often have the nymphs beheld me sweat  Beneath the fury of the summer's heat  How often seen the frost bind up my hair  And cry'd Ah Daphnis worn with too much care  But what avails my care what boots my pain  But only yields a larger subject to complain"  ON THE DEATH OF MR WALLER  BY MR BEVIL HIGGONS  A younger son of Sir Thomas Higgons already mentioned p by Bridget his second wife At the age of he became a commoner of St John's College Oxford in Lent term and went afterwards to Cambridge Wood enumerates five of his poems He wrote some others and was the author of a tragedy intituled "The Generous Conqueror or the Timely Discovery" acted at Drury Lane and printed in to See the prologue to this tragedy in Lord Lansdowne's Poems p He was a steady adherent to the cause of the exiled family and accompanied K James into France where he maintained his wit and goodhumour undepressed by his misfortunes On the publication of Bishop Burnet's History of his own Times he wrote some strictures on it in a volume intituled "Historical and Critical Remarks" the second edition of which was printed in vo and in the same year published "A short View of the English History with Reflections Political Historical Civil Physical and Moral on the Reigns of the Kings their Characters and Manners their Successions to the Throne and all other remarkable Incidents to the Revolution Drawn from authentic Memoirs and MSS By B Higgons of The Middle Temple Esq""These papers" he tells us in his Pre    "lay covered with dust years till every person concerned in the transactions mentioned was removed from the stage"  He died the st of March N    AH had thy body lasted as thy name  Secure of life as now thou art of fame  Thou hadst more ages than old Nestor seen  Nor had thy Phoebus more immortal been  To thee alone we are beholden more  Than all the poets of the times before  Thy Muse inspir'd with a genteeler rage  Did first refine the genius of our age  In thee a clear and female softness shin'd  With masculine vigour force and judgement join'd  You in soft strains for courts and ladies sung  So natural your thought so sweet your song  The gentle sex did still partake your flame  And all the coyness of your mistress blame  Still mov'd with you did the same passions find  And vow'd that Sacharissa was unkind  Oh may the world ne'er lose so brave a flame  May one succeed in genius and in fame  May from thy urn some Phoenix Waller rise  Whom the admiring world like thee may prize  May he in thy immortal numbers sing  And paint the glories of our matchless king  Oh may his verse of mighty Waller taste  And mend the coming age as you the last  Within that sacred pile  WestminsterAbbey N  where kings do come  Both to receive their crowns and find a tomb  There is a lonely aile which holy place  The lasting monuments of poets grace  Thither amongst th' inspired train convey  And in their company his ashes lay  Let him with Spenser and great Cowley be  He who 's so much the greatest of the three  Though there so many crowns and mitres lie  For kings and saints as well as we must die  Those venerable walls were never blest  Since their foundation with a nobler guest  With them great soul thou shalt immortal live  And in thy deathless numbers fate survive  Fresh as thy Sacharissa's beauty still  Thy bays shall grow which time can never kill  Far as our conquering British lion roars  Far as the poles or the remotest shores  Where'er is known or heard the English name  The distant world shall hear of Waller's fame  Thou only shalt with nature's self expire  And all the world in the supremest fire  When Horace and fam'd Virgil die when all  That's great or noble shall together fall  ON SOLITUDE  See a beautiful "Ode on Solitude" by Mr Hammond in the Poems of Lord Roscommon p N    I  O Solitude my sweetest choice  Places devoted to the night  Remote from tumult and from noise  How you my restless thought delight  O heavens what content is mine  To see those trees which have appear'd  From the nativity of time  And which all ages have rever'd  To look today as fresh and green  As when their beauties first were seen  II  A chearful wind does court them so  And with such amorous breath enfold  That we by nothing else can know  But by their height that they are old  Hither the demigods did fly  To seek a sanctuary when  Displeased Jove once pierc'd the sky  To pour a deluge upon men  And on these boughs themselves did save  Whence they could hardly see a wave  III  Sad Philomel upon this thorn  So curiously by Flora drest  In melting notes her case forlorn  To entertain me hath confess'd  Oh how agreeable a sight  These hanging mountains do appear  Which the unhappy would invite  To finish all their sorrows here  When their hard fate makes them endure  Such woes as only death can cure  IV  What pretty desolations make  These torrents vagabond and fierce  Who in vast heaps their spring forsake  This solitary vale to pierce  Then sliding just as serpents do  Under the foot of every tree  Themselves are chang'd to rivers too  Wherein some stately Naiade  As in her native bed is grown  A que  n upon a crystal throne  V  Th  den beset with riverplants  O how it does my senses charm  Nor elders reeds nor willows wants  Which the sharp steel did never harm  Here nymphs which come to take the air  M  y with such distaffs furnish'd be  As flags and rushes can prepare  Where we the nimble frogs may see  Who frighted to retreat do fly  If an approaching man they spy  VI  Here waterfowl repose enjoy  Without the interrupting care  Lest fortune should their bliss destroy  By the malicious fowler's s  are  Some ravish'd with so bright a day  Their feathers finely prune and deck  Others their amorous heats allay  Which yet the waters could not check  All take their innocent content  In this their lovely element  VII  Summer's nor winter's bold approach  This stream did never entertain  Nor ever felt a boa  or coach  Whilst either season did remain  No thirsty traveller came near  And rudely made his hand his cup  Nor any hunted hind hath here  Her hopeless life resigned up  Nor ever did the treacherous hook  Intrude to empty any brook  VIII  What beauty is there in the sight  Of these old ruin'd castle walls  In which the utmost rage and spight  Of time's worst insurrection falls  The witches keep their sabbath here  And wanton devils make retreat  Who in malicious sport appear  Our senses both t' afflict and cheat  And here within a thousand holes  Are nests of adders and of owls  IX  The raven with his dismal cries  That mortal augury of fate  Whose ghastly goblin gratifies  Which in these gloomy places wait  On a curs'd tree the wind does move  A carcass which did once belong  To one that hang'd himself for love  Of a fair nymph that did him wrong  Who though she saw his love and truth  With one look would not save the youth  X  But Heaven which judgeth equally  And its own laws will still maintain  Rewarded soon her cruelty  With a deserv'd and mighty pain  About his squalid heap of bones  Her wandering and condemning shade  Laments in long and piercing groans  The destiny her rigour made  And farther to augment her fright  Her crime is ever in her sight  XI  There upon Antick  So printed by Dryden Q  Antique  or  N  marble trac'd  Devices of pastimes we see  Here age has almost quite defac'd  What lovers carv'd on every tree  The cellar here the highest room  Receives whene'er its rafters fail  Soil'd with the venom and the foam  Of the sly spider and the snail  And th' ivy in the chimney we  Find shaded by a wallnuttree  XII  Below there does a cave extend  Wherein there is so dark a grot  That should the sun himself descend  I think he could not see a jot  Here sleep within a heavy lid  In quiet sadness locks up sense  And every care he does forbid  Whilst in the arms of negligence  Lazily on his back he 's spread  And sheaves of poppey are his bed  XIII  Within this cool and hollow cave  Where Love itself might turn to ice  Poor Echo ceases not to rave  On her Narcissus wild and nice  Hither I softly steal a thought  And by the softer musick made  With a sweet lute in charms welltaught  Sometimes I slatter her sad shade  Whilst of my chords I make such choice  To serve as body to her voice  XIV  When from these ruins I retire  This horrid rock I do invade  Whose lofty brow seems to enquire  Of what materials mists are made  From thence descending leisurely  Under the brow of this steep hill  It with great pleasure I descry  By waters undermin'd until  They to Palaemon's seat did climb  Compos'd of spunges and of slime  XV  How highly is the fancy pleas'd  To be upon the ocean's shore  When she begins to be appeas'd  And her fierce billows cease to roar  And when the hairy Tritons are  Riding upon the shaken wave  With what strange sound they strike the air  Of their trumpets hoarse and brave  Whose shrill report does every wind  Unto his due submission bind  XVI  Sometimes the sea dispels the sand  Trembling and murmuring in the bay  And rolls itself upon the shells  Which it both brings and takes away  Sometimes exposes on the strand  Th' effects of Neptune's rage and scorn  Drown'd men dead monsters cast on land  And ships that were in tempests torn  With diamonds and ambergrease  And many more such things as these  XVII  Sometimes so sweetly she does smile  A floating mirror she might be  And you would fancy all that while  New heavens in her face to see  The sun himself is drawn so well  When there he would his picture view  That our eyes can hardly tell  Which is the false sun which the true  And l  st we give our sense the lye  We think he 's fallen from the sky  XVIII  ernieres for whose beloved sake  My thoughts are at a noble strife  This my fantastic landskip take  Which I have copied to the life  I only seek the desarts rough  Where all alone I love to walk  And with discourse refin'd enough  My genius and the Muses talk  But the converse most truly mine  Is the dear memory of thine  XIX  Thou may'st in this poem find  So full of liberty and heat  What illustrious rays have shin'd  To enlighten my conceit  Sometimes pensive sometimes gay  Just as that fury does control  And as the object I survey  The notions grow up in my soul  And are as unconfin'd and free  As the flame which transported me  XX  Oh how I solitude adore  That element of noblest wit  Where I have learn'd Apollo's lore  With  ut the pains to study it  For thy sake I in love am grown  With what thy fancy does pursue  But when I think upon my own  I hate it for that reason too  Because it needs must hinder me  From seeing and from serving thee  A CHARACTER OF THE ENGLISH  BY ROBERT WOLSELEY ESQ  Son of Sir Charles Wolseley of Staffordshire a zealous parliamentarian who for his services was made one of Cromwell's lords Robert was a younger brother and being in favour with King William was sent envoy to Brussels about the year He was very much the man of pleasure and occasionally invoked the Muse He wrote the extraordinary Preface to Lord Rochester's Valentinian a translation from the sixth book of Virgil on Aeneas's meeting with Dido not worth preserving and some other little pieces The poem here printed is an allusion to Tacitus de Vitâ Agricolae N  THE freeborn English generous and wise  Hate chains but do not government despise  Rights of the crown tribute and taxes they  When lawfully exacted freely pay  Force they abhor and wrong they scorn to bear  More guided by their judgement than their fear  Justice with them is never held severe  Here power by tyranny was never got  Laws may perhaps ensnare them force cannot  Rash councils here have still the same effect  The surest way to reign is to protect  Kings are least safe in their unbounded will  Join'd with the wretched power of doing ill  Forsaken most when they 're most absolute  Laws guard the man and only bind the brute  To force that guard and with the worst to join  Can never be a prudent king's design  What king would chuse to be a Catiline  Break his own laws stake an unquestion'd throne  Conspire with vassals to usurp his own  'Tis rather some base favourite's vile pretence  To tyrannize at the wrong'd king's expence  Let France grow proud beneath the tyrant's lust  While the rackt people crawl and lick the dust  The mighty Genius of this isle disdains  Ambitious slavery and golden chains  England to servile yoke did never bow  What conquerors ne'er presum'd who dares do now  Roman nor Norman ever could pretend  To have enslav'd but made this isle their friend  TO THE MEMORY OF MR WALLER▪  BY SIR JOHN COTTON BART  Recorder of the town of Cambridge and one of their representatives in parliament all king William's and part of queen Anne's reign He died in January N  NOT sleep beneath the shade in flowery fields  To th' weary traveller more pleasure yields  Nor to assuage his thirst the living spring  I' th' heat of summer more delight does bring  Than unto me thy welltun'd numbers do  In which thou dost both please and profit too  Born in a clime where storms and tempests grow  Far from the place where Helicon does flow  The Muses travel'd far to bless thy sight  And taught thee how to think and how to write  Th' Ascraean  Hesiod  shepherd tells us he indeed  Had seen them dancing while his flocks did feed  Not Petrarch's Laura nor bright Stella's fame  Shall longer live than Sacharissa's name  Thou do'st not write like those who brand the times  And themselves most with sharp satyric rhymes  Nor does thy Muse with smutty verses tear  The modest virgin's chaste and tender ear  Free from their faults whate'er thy Muse indites  Not Ovid nor Tibullus softer writes  The choice of tuneful words t' express our thought  By thy example we have first been taught  Our English Virgil  Cowley▪  and our Pindar too  In this 'tis said some negligence did shew  I'll add but this lest while I think to raise  Thy worth I kindly injure thee with praise  Thy verses have a genius and must  Live until all things crumble into dust  NEWS FROM HELL  BY CAPTAIN RADCLIFF  An officer of the army devoted to Parnassus of strong propensity to mirth and pleasure His poetical performances abound in low humour That which is here given as a specimen being perhaps as unexceptionable as any other of this author's productions is retained for the sake of the anecdotes it furnishes "The Ramble" and "A Call to the Guard by a Drum" are the titles of two others N    SO dark the night was that old Charon  Could not carry ghostly fare on  But was forc'd to leave his souls  Stark stript of bodies 'mongst the shoals  Of black seatoads and other fry  Which on the Stygian shore do lie  Th' amazed spirits desire recess  To their old batter'd carcases  But as they turn about they find  The night more dismal is behind  Pluto began to fret and fume  Because the tiltboat did not come  To the shore's side he straitway trudges  With his three soulcensuring judges  Standing on Acherontic strand  thrice three times did waft his wand  From gloomy lake did straight arise  A meagre fiend with broad blue eyes  Approaching Pluto as he bow'd  From's head there dropt infernal mud  Quoth he "  A tenebris luto  " I come""'Tis well quoth surly Pluto  " Go you to t'other side of Styx  " And know why Charon's so prolix  " Surely on earth there cannot be  " A grant of immortality"  Away the wriggling fiend soon scuds  Through liquids thick as soap and suds  In the meanwhile old Aeacus  Craftier far than any of us  For mortal men to him are silly  Besides he held a league with Lilly  The celebrated astrologer of the last century N    And what is acted here does know  As well as t'other does below  Thus spake "Thou mighty king of Orcus  " Who into any shape canst work us  " I to your greatness shall declare  " My sentiments of this affair  " Charon you know did use to come  " With some elucid spirit home  " Some poet bright whose glowing soul  " Like torch did light him cross the pool  " Old Charon then was blithe and merry  " With flame and rhapsody in ferry  " Should he gross souls alone take in  " Laden with heavy rubbish sin  " Sin that is nothing but allay  " 'Tis ten to one he 'd lose his way  " But now such wights with souls so clear  " Must not have damnation here  " Nor can we hope they 'll hither move  " For know grim Sir they 're damn'd above  " They 're damn'd on earth by th' present age  " Damn'd in cabals and damn'd o' th' stage  " Laureat  Davenant and Dryden both laureats are here the obj  cts of our poet's satire N  who was both learn'd and florid  " Was damn'd long since for silence horrid  " Nor had there been such clutter made  " But that this silence did invade  Alluding to two lines in Dryden's poem called "Astraea Redux"  "  An  horrid stilness  first  invades the ear  " And in that silence we a tempest fear"  which are ridiculed in "The Rehearsal" A  " But stay what sound is this  invades our ears  "  The Key however to that witty performance refers to the following lines in "The Siege of Rhodes" as those intended to be burlesqued  " What various noises  do my ears invade    " And have a concert of confusion made"  R    " Invade and so 't might well that 's clear  " But what did it invadean ear  " And for some other things 'tis true  " We follow fate that does pursue  A line in one of Mr Dryden's Plays is here alluded to R  "  A lord who was in metre wont  To talk of privymember blunt  Whose verse by women termed lewd  Is still preserv'd not understood  But that which made them curse and ban  Was for his "Satire against Man  See the Earl of Rochester's Poems p N  "  A third  Shadwell  was damn'd 'cause in his plays  He thrusts old jests in Archee's days  Nor as they say can make a chorus  Without a tavern or a whorehouse  Which he to puzzle vulgar thinking  Does call by th' name of love and drinking  A fourth  Sir George Etherege of whom and of Shadwell some account will be given hereafter N  for writing superfine  With words correct in every line  And one that does presume to say  A plot's too gross for any play  Comedy should be clean and neat  As gentlemen do talk and eat  So what he writes is but translation  From dog and partridge conversation  A fifth  Mr Wicherley alluding to his Plain Dealer" N  who does in's last prefer  'Bove all his own dear character  And fain would seem upon the stage  Too manly for this flippant age  A sixth  Nat Lee See above p His lunacy is compared by Langbaine to the Divine Fury mentioned by Ovid  " Est Deus in nobis agitante calescimus illo"  The description of madness in his "Caesar Borgia" is admirably fine N  whose lofty fancy towers  'Bove fate eternity and powers  Rumbles i' th' sky and makes a bustle  So "Gods meet Gods i' th' dark and justle"  A seventh  This was Sir Robert Howard author of "The Committee" and other pieces and related to Mr Dryden by that author's marriage He had a controversy with Mr Dryden on the propriety of verse in dramatic entertainments In the dedication of his works he says  "that rhyme is such a confinement to a quick and luxuriant fancy that it gives a stop to its speed till slow judgment comes in to assist it"  And again  "Verses I mean good ones do in their height of fancy declare the labour that brought them forth like majesty that grows with care and nature that made the poet capable seems to retire and leave its offers to be made perfect by pains and judgment"  These passages appear to be alluded to above See an account of Sir Robert p R  because he'd rather chuse  To spoil his verse than tire his Muse  Nor will he let heroics chime  Fancy quoth he is lost by rhyme  And he that's us'd to clashing swords  Should not delight in sounds of words  Mars with Mercury should not mingle  Great warriors should speak big not jingle  Amongst this heptarchy of wit  The censuring age have thought it fit  To damn a woman  Mrs Behn See above p N  'cause 'tis said  The plays she vends she never made  But that a GraysInn lawyer  Mr Hoyl  does 'em  Who unto her was friend in bosom  So not presenting scarf and hood  New plays and songs are full as good  These are the better sort I grant  Damn'd only by the ignorant  But still there are a scribbling fry  Ought to be damn'd eternally  An unlearn'd tribe o' th' lower rate  Who will be poets spite of fate  Whose character's not worth reciting  They scarce can read yet will be writing  As t' other day a silly oaf  Instead of  Jove  did call on  Jose    Whose humble Muse descends to cellars  Or at the best to Hercules' pillars  Now Charon I presume does stop  Expecting one of these would drop  For any such poetic damn'dboy  Will light him home as well as flambeau  Aeacus just had made an end  When did arrive the dripping fiend  Who did confirm the judge's speech  That Charon did a light beseech  They fell to consultation grave  To find some strange enlighten'd knave  Faux had like t' have been the spark  But that his lantern was too dark  At last th' agreed a sullen Quaker  Should be this businessundertaker  The fittest soul for this exploit  Because he had the newest light  Him soon from sable den they drag  Who of his sufferings doth brag  And unto heel of fiend being ty'd  To Charon's vessel was convey'd  Charon came home all things were well  This is the only News from Hell  NATURE'S CHANGES  LUCRET BOOK V  BY THE HON SIR ROBERT HOWARD  A younger son of Thomas earl of Berkshire and educated at Magdalen College in Oxford During the civil wars he was a zealous royalist and was knighted at the Restoration and rewarded by the office of auditor of the exchequer He was chosen member for Stockbridge in and for Castle Rising in and He was so strong an advocate for the Revolution as to disclaim all manner of conversation with the Nonjurors and by his obstinacy and pride made many enemies His patron the duke of Buckingham had in exposed him under the name of  Bilboa  in "The Rehearsal" but afterwards altered his resolution and leveled his ridicule at a much greater name under that of  Bayes  He was also ridiculed in Shadwell's "Sullen Lovers" under the name of  Sir Positive Atall  He published six plays a volume of poems and some treatises in prose was four times married and died Sept In Dryden vol II p is a beautiful epistle "To my honoured Friend Sir R Howard on his excellent Poems" N    SINCE Earth and Water more dilated Air  And active Fire mixt Nature's parts appear  These all new form'd and to destruction brought  Why of the World may not the like be thought  Reason presents this maxim to our view  What in each part that in the whole is true  And therefore when you see spring up and fall  Nature's great parts conclude the like of all  Know heaven and earth on the same laws depend  In time they both began in time shall end  But Memmius not t' assume what some deny  The proof on plain experience shall rely  I'll shew these elements to change are prone  Rise in new shapes continue long in none  Then first of Earth conclude that all must fail  Which differing parts fermenting can exhale  Much the reflected rays extract from thence  And from their burning heat no less th' expence  The dust and smoke in flying clouds appear  Which boisterous winds disperse through liquid air  Some parts dissolve and flow away in rain  And from their banks the rapid rivers gain  A diminution nothing e'er escapes  Which new existence gives to other shapes  Plants minerals and concretes owe their birth  And animals their growth in part to earth  Then since from this their beings first did spring  Time all to this their common grave does bring  In these examples not to mention more  Nature does earth consume and earth restore  The springs the rivers and the seas are found  For earth's supply with waters to abound  Renew'd and flowing in continual round  Lest these increasing should at last prevail  The mighty ocean fiercer winds assail  Vast shoals of atoms thence away they bear  And raising them aloft transform to air  Much is extracted from the powerful sun  More does in subterranean channels run  In earth it first excessive saltness spends  Then to our springs' and rivers' heads ascends  These in the fruitful valleys turn and wind  And still to new productions are inclin'd  And next of Air which in its vast extent  In changes infinite each hour is spent  For air's wide ocean still requiring more  Fill'd with effluvia should it not restore  The perish'd shapes time's ruins to repair  Long since had all things been dissolv'd to air  From others loss its being it receives  To these again its changing substance leaves  So true it is that nature ebbs and flows  And one part perishing another grows  The Sun the fountain of the glorious rays  Instead of vanish'd light new light displays  The brightness of the flying minute past  Is now obscur'd and to new forms does haste  From hence it comes that when black clouds draw near  And banish'd sunshine strait does disappear  The earth 's o'ershadow'd as the storms are driven  And rays new darted are requir'd from heaven  Vision would cease so soon would light expire  Without recruits of bright etherial fire  In our inferior and sulphureous light  Of lamps and tapers chacing shades of night  Continued fuel feeds the trembling flame  Which gives the light nor is that light the same  Of sun of moon of stars ne'er think it strange  That they are not secure from final change  When what so late did smile this instant dies  And newborn light still shines to mortal eyes  Thus we observe hard rocks in time decay'd  The marble monuments for heroes made  And stately towers in humble ruins laid  Do Gods their images from age secure  Or force their temples always to endure  Thus when you see old rocks from mountains fall  By this conclude their sure original  For were they from eternity so plac'd  No chance could ruin them no time could waste  Next raise your eyes to earthsurrounding spheres  From which say some springs all that now appears  To which at last their vanish'd parts ascend  These as they 're form'd to dissolution tend  For all things must in such proportion cease  As they to other beings give increase  But then if no beginning does appear  Of heaven and earth but both eternal were  Before the Theban war was e'er proclaim'd  Or fatal siege of Troy by Homer fam'd  Why did not far more antient poets sing  What revolutions elder times did bring  Such men such acts how in oblivion drown'd  As with immortal fame might well be crown'd  No great antiquity the world has prov'd  Eternity from this seems far remov'd  All arts and science else would long ago  Have reach'd perfection not now daily grow  No ancient sailors e'er like ours did steer  No such harmonious musick charm'd the ear  This nature of the world not ages past  Was brought to light retarded for the last  And these discoveries ordain'd by fate  To foreign climes I with the first translate  But still if no beginning you believe  And say 'tis easier for us to conceive  Such conflagrations from sulphureous power  As totally did human race devour  Or general earthquakes did the world confound  Or all in mighty deluges were drown'd  This force of argument you then increase  That heaven and earth in future time must cease  For which such dreadful danger threaten'd all  Though nature then escap'd a total fall  Grant but the cause increas'd and 'twill not fail  As did the less o'er all things to prevail  What shews we cannot endless life enjoy  B  sense of ills which others did destroy  If you the world's duration would extend  To all eternity you must defend  Its solid substance is so firmly bound  No penetration can it ever wound  Minutest atoms 'tis confess'd are so  But not the compound which from these did grow  Or that 'tis immaterial you must prove  And what no forcing agent can remove  Or else you must all ambient space deny  To which it may dissolv'd and ruin'd fly  Thus Universal claims Eternal's place  Because it ne'er can pass t' external space  But neither is this various globe so fix'd  For much vacuity is intermix'd  Nor is it void of matter nor can be  From threatening power of penetration free  And powers unknown from boundless ambient space  This present state of nature may deface  With dreadful hurricanes they may invade  And turn to chaos all that e'er was made  Or by some other means beyond the reach  Of man's conception make the fatal breach  Nor wants there space beyond the spheres of heaven  To which the ruin'd parts may then be driven  Whene'er these elements their mansions leave  That vast abyss lies open to receive  From hence to their beginning you 're directed  What magic charms have always so protected  That when the finite parts expiring lye  The whole eternal ages should defy  Then since the world's great parts at once engage  And civil wars in its dominions rage  We may foresee their strife so long depending  At last in general subversion ending  Rivers and seas consum'd fierce fires may burn  Till all their ashes meet in earth's great urn  Ev'n now they strive the victory to gain  But still the ocean does the fight maintain  And swell'd with rivers hopes by forces try'd  To drown the rest and sole in triumph ride  This to prevent the swift exhausting wind  And radiant sun 'gainst liquid force are join'd  Thus equal in appearance long they mov'd  Each other's strength in mighty wars they prov'd  At last the fire 'tis said did win the field  And earth did once o'erwhelm'd with waters yield  Long since when Phaeton led by vain desire  To drive the sun's great chariot did aspire  'Twas then the world was hazarded by fire  With headstrong force the winged horses flew  O'er earth and heaven the burning planet drew  What then had been the fate of all things here  If angry Jove the daring charioteer  Had not dismounted by swift lightning's stroke  And so at once the flaming progress broke  Thus Phaeton slain was falling to the ground  And furious horses dragg'd the chariot round  When great Apollo reassum'd the chair  Restor'd the sun that rov'd throughout the air  With dextrous force reclaim'd his raging steeds  And to this hour in annual course proceeds  Greek poets thus the truth with lies confound  To waking men like wandering dreams they sound  But though to grace their morals they romance  True fires did then from east to west advance  Such magazines of sulphur earth contains  That if some stronger agent not restrains  The fuel all inflam'd and raging high  Will ne'er be quench'd till all in ruins lie  The water too did as our authors tell  In ages past to such proportion swell  That spacious empires wholly were destroy'd  The ocean then had sovereign right enjoy'd  But that some greater being soon arose  From infinite space t' o'ercome th' invading foes  Bright heavens then triumph'd o'er the vanquish'd showers  And falling floods proclaim'd prevailing powers  THE DUEL OF THE STAGS  BY THE SAME  Sir Robert Howard was author of an excellent poem "against the Fear of Death" which gained him a considerable degree of reputation N    TO THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM  George Villiers duke of Buckingham a noble writer a man of great wit and humour and of the most whimsical caprice was the admiration and the jest of the reign of Charles II He was the alchemist and the philosopher the fiddler and the poet the mimic and the statesman He has left us a specimen of his admirable wit in "The Rehearsal" which had a considerable effect in reforming the stage It was finished before the end of but the great plague and other accidents prevented its being acted before He is said to have been assisted in this comedy by Dr Spratt Mr Clifford and the celebrated author of HudibrasThe duke was born Jan the year before his father's assassination After many sufferings in the royal cause he solicited one of the daughters of Cromwell in marriage but was mortified with a denial He afterwards married the only daughter of lord Fairfax and was soon committed to The Tower by the protector On the Restoration he was at first slighted by the king but the charms of his wit and conversation soon prevailed and he was appointed a lord of the bedchamber In May he purchased the office of master of the horse was installed chancellor of Cambridge June and deprived of that office in He died in contempt and misery April a melancholy example of the prostitution of talents His end is pathetically described in Mr Pope's Epistle to Lord Bathurst And see some further particulars of a peer  "who was of so  great  and at the same time of so  little  a character"  in Granger vol III p His Works were published in in vols vo N    MY LORD I should beg your pardon could I apprehend it were an error to present any thing to your grace which comes from me to whom I have made so entire a dedication of myself But this advantage appears  in all real esteems and friendships they are as much above the ceremonies of the world as the usual practice of it but your grace has a farther title to this being more yours than mine as much as an image well shaped and polished is more properly due to him that gave it that perfection than to him that first digged the stone out of the quarry It was an illcontrived house within full of entries and unuseful passages till your grace was pleased to take them away and make it habitable for any candid opinion At the same time when your grace made this your own you made me more justly yours it was in your confinement  where after some concealment of yourself to weigh the circumstances and causes of your persecution you generously exposed yourself to stand all hazards and trials from the assurance of your courage and advice of your innocence and as your grace in your adversity has found the advantage of an unshaken honour I doubt not but your prince and nation will find an equal benefit in your better fortunes by your counsel and service which will always be directed by such a steady virtue And may all advantages that you encrease in and all the nation receives by you be equalled by nothing but the content of my lord your grace's  Most humble and faithful servant ROBERT HOWARD  IN Windsor forest before war destroy'd  The harmless pleasure which soft peace enjoy'd  A mighty stag grew monarch of the herd  By all his savage slaves obey'd and fear'd  And while the troops about their sovereign fed  They watch'd the awful nodding of his head  Still as he passeth by they all remove  Proud in dominion prouder in his love  And while with pride and appetite he swells  He courts no chosen object but compels  No subject his lov'd mistress dares deny  But yields his hopes up to his tyranny  Long had this prince imperiously thus sway'd  By no set laws but by his will obey'd  His fearful slaves to full obedience grown  Admire his strength and dare not use their own  One subject most did his suspicion move  That shew'd least fear and counterfeited love  In the best pastures by his side he fed  Arm'd with two large militias on his head  As if he practis'd majesty he walk'd  And at his nod he made not haste but stalk'd  By his large shade he saw how great he was  And his vast layers on the bended grass  His thoughts as large as his proportion grew  And judg'd himself as fit for empire too  Thus to rebellious hopes he swell'd at length  Love and ambition growing with his strength  This hid ambition his bold passion shows  And from a subject to a rival grows  Solicits all his prince's fearful dames  And in his sight courts with rebellious flames  The prince sees this with an inflamed eye  But looks are only signs of majesty  When once a prince's will meets a restraint  His power is then esteem'd but his complaint  His head then shakes at which th' affrighted herd  Start to each side his rival not afear'd  Stands by his mistress' side and stirs not thence  But bids her own his love and his defence  The quarrel now to a vast height is grown  Both urg'd to fight by passion and a throne  But love has most excuse for all we find  Have passions though not thrones alike assign'd  The sovereign stag shaking his loadedhead  On which his scepters with his arms were spread  Wisely by nature there together fix'd  Where with the title the defence was mixt  The pace which he advanc'd with to engage  Became at once his majesty and rage  T' other stands still with as much confidence  To make his part seem only his defence  Their heads now meet and at one blow each strikes  As many strokes as if a rank of pikes  Grew on his brows as thick their antlers stand  Which every year kind nature does di  band  Wild beasts sometimes in peace and quiet are  But man no season frees from love or war  With equal strength they met as if two oaks  Had fell and mingled with a thousand strokes  One by ambition urg'd t'other disdain  One to preserve the other fought to gain  The subjects and the mistresses stood by  With love and duty to crown victory  For all affections wait on prosperous fame  Not he that climbs but he that falls meets shame  While thus with equal courages they meet  The wounded earth yields to their struggling feet  And while one slides t'other pursues the fight  And thinks that forc'd retreat looks like a flight  But then asham'd of his retreat at length  Drives his foe back his rage renews his strength  As even weights into a motion thrown  By equal turns drive themselves up and down  So sometimes one then t' other stag prevails  And victory yet doubtful holds the scales  The prince asham'd to be oppos'd so long  With all his strength united rushes on  The rebel weaker than at first appears  And from his courage sinks unto his fears  Not able longer to withstand his might  From a retreat at last steals to a flight  The mighty stag pursues his flying foe  Till his own pride of conquest made him slow  Thought it enough to scorn a thing that flies  And only now pursued him with his eyes  The vanquish'd as he fled turn'd back his sight  Asham'd to fly and yet afraid to fight  Sometimes his wounds as his excuse survey'd  Then fled again and then look'd back and staid  Blush'd that his wounds so slight should not deny  Strength for a fight that left him strength to fly  Calls thoughts of love and empire to his aid  But fears more powerful than all those persuade  And yet in spite of them retains his shame  His cool'd ambition and his halfquench'd flame  There's none from their own sense of shame can fly  And dregs of passions dwell with misery  Now to the shades he bends his feeble course  Despis'd by those that once admir'd his force  The wretch that to a scorn'd condition 's thrown  With the world's favour loses too his own  While fawning troops their conquering prince inclos'd  Now render'd absolute by being oppos'd  Princes by disobedience get command  And by newquench'd rebellions firmer stand  Till by the boundless offers of success  They meet their fate in illus'd happiness  The vanquish'd stag to thickest shades repairs  Where he finds safety punish'd with his cares  Thorough the woods he rushes not but glides  And from all searches but his own he hides  Asham'd to live unwilling yet to lose  That wretched life he knew not how to use  In this retirement thus he liv'd conceal'd  Till with his wounds his fears were almost heal'd  His ancient passions now began to move  He thought again of empire and of love  Then rous'd himself and stretch'd at his full length  Took the large measure of his mighty strength  Then shook his loaded head the shadow too  Shook like a tree where leafless branches grew  Stooping to drink he sees it in the streams  And in the woods hears clashing of its beams  No accident but does alike proclaim  His growing strength and his increasing shame  Now once again resolves to try his fate  For envy always is importunate  And in the mind perpetually does move  A fit companion for unquiet love  He thinks upon his mighty enemy  Circled about with power and luxury  And hop'd his strength might sink in his desires  Remembering he had wasted in such fires  Yet while he hop'd by them to overcome  He wish'd the other's fatal joys his own  Thus the unquiet beast in safety lay  Where nothing was to fear nor to obey  Where he alone commanded and was lord  Of every bounty nature did afford  Chose feasts for every arbitrary sense  An empire in the state of innocence  But all the feasts nature before him plac'd  Had but faint relishes to his lost taste  Sick minds like bodies in a fever spent  Turn food to the disease not nourishment  Sometimes he stole abroad and shrinking stood  Under the shelter of the friendly wood  Casting his envious eyes towards those plains  Where crown'd with joys his mighty rival reigns  He saw th' obeying herd marching along  And weigh'd his rival's greatness by the throng  Want takes false measures both of power and joys  And envy'd greatness is but croud and noise  Not able to endure this hated sight  Back to the shades he flies to seek out night  Like exiles from their native soils though sent  To better countries think it banishment  Here he enjoy'd what t'other could have there  The woods as shady and the streams as clear  The pastures more untainted where he fed  And every night chose out an unpress'd bed  But then his labouring soul with dreams was prest  And found the greatest weariness in rest  His dreadful rival in his sleep appears  And in his dreams again he fights and fears  Shrinks at the strokes of t'other's mighty head  Feels every wound and dreams how fast he fled  At this he wakes and with his fearful eyes  Salutes the light that fleets the Eastern skies  Still half amaz'd looks round and held by fear  Scarce can believe no enemy was near  But when he saw his heedless fears were brought  Not by a substance but a drowsy thought  His ample sides he shakes from whence the dew  In scatter'd showers like driven tempests flew  At which through all his breast new boldness spread  And with his courage rais'd his mighty head  Then by his love inspir'd resolves to try  The combat now and overcome or die  Every weak passion sometimes is above  The fear of death much more the noblest love  By hope 'tis scorn'd and by despair 'tis sought  Pursued by honour and by sorrow brought  Resolv'd the paths of danger now to tread  From his scorn'd shelter and his fears he fled  With a brave haste now seeks a second fight  Redeems the base one by a noble flight  In the mean time the conqueror enjoy'd  That power by which he was to be destroy'd  How hard 'tis for the prosperous to see  That fate which waits on power and victory  Thus he securely reign'd when in a rout  He saw th' affrighted herd flying about  As if some huntsmen did their chace pursue  About themselves in scatter'd rings they flew  He like a careful monarch rais'd his head  To see what cause that strange disturbance bred  But when the search'dout cause appear'd no more  Than from a slave he had o'ercome before  A bold disdain did in his looks appear  And shook his awful head to chide their fear  The herd afraid of friend and enemy  S  ink from the one and from the other fly  They scarce know which they should obey or trust  Since fortune only makes it safe and just  Yet in despite of all his pride he staid  And this unlook'dfor chance with trouble weigh'd  His rage and his contempt alike swell'd high  And only fear'd his enemy should fly  He thought of former conquest and from thence  C  'd himself into a confidence  T other that saw his conqueror so near  S  d still and listen'd to a whispering fear  From whence he heard his conquest and his shame  But newborn hopes his ancient fears o'ercame  The mighty enemies now meet at length  With equal fury though not equal strength  For now too late the conqueror did find  That all was wasted in him but his mind  His courage in his weakness yet prevails  As a b  ld pilot steers with tatter'd sails  And cordage crackt directs no steady course  C  d by resolution more than force  Before his oncescorn'd enemy he reels  His wounds increasing with his shame he feels  The other's strength more from his weakness grows  And with one furious push his rival throws  So a tall oak the pride of all the wood  That long th' assault of several storms had stood  Till by a mighty blast more strongly push'd  His root's torn up and to the earth he rush'd  Yet then he rais'd his head on which there grew  Once all his power and all his title too  Unable now to rise and less to fight  He rais'd those scepters to demand his right  But such weak arguments prevail with none  To plead their titles when their power is gone  His head now sinks and with it all defence  Not only robb'd of power but pretence  Wounds upon wounds the conqueror still gives  And thinks himself unsafe while t'other lives  Unhappy state of such as wear a crown  Fortune can never lay them gently down  Now to the most scorn'd remedy he flies  And for some pity seems to move his eyes  Pity by which the best of virtue's try'd  To wretched princes ever is deny'd  There is a debt to fortune which they pay  For all their greatness by no common way  The flattering troops unto the victor fly  And own his title to his victory  The faith of most with fortune does decline  Duty's but fear and conscience but design  The victor now proud in his great success  Hastes to enjoy his fatal happiness  Forgot his mighty rival was destroy'd  By that which he so fondly now enjoy'd  In passions thus nature herself enjoys  Sometimes preserves and then again destroys  Yet all destruction which revenge can move  Time or ambition is supply'd by love  TO COUNT MONTECUCCOLI AGAINST PRIDE UPON SUDDEN ADVANCEMENT  BY AN UNKNOWN WRITER  FROM THE ITALIAN OF FULVIO TESTI  I  PROUD and foolish noisy stream  Who to some muddy plash thy birth do'st owe  Which casually a brook became  Assisted by the rain and melting snow  Though now thou boast thy swelling tide  August will soon be here and end thy shortliv'd pride  II  The Thames great king of floods the Thames  With peaceful course hastes gently to the main  Yet he upon his silent streams  The tallest vessels does with ease sustain  And while one summer thee devours  His flood shall ne'er decrease nor time contract his shores  III  Thou foam'st and boil'st along the plain  The flocks and shepherds threatening by the way  Through borrow'd waters basely vain  Lift'st up thy head and do'st regardless stray  Troubled oblique and this alone  Thy noisy pride is all which thou canst call thy own  IV  I know Sir you may well admire  To hear me reason with a deafening stream  But thus the Muse oft strikes the lyre  When she'd most lofty and majestic seem  And in mysterious numbers shrowd  Deep oracles too deep for the unthinking croud  V  While thus I spake there did appear  Phoebus the God of every tuneful lay  A laurel crown'd his beamy hair  Which with a brighter light improv'd the day  And thus he what I saw apply'd  " Short is th' uncertain reign and pomp of mortal pride  VI  New turns and changes every day  Are of inconstant chance the constant arts  Soon she gives soon takes away  She comes embraces nauseates you and parts  But if she stays or if she goes  The wise man

Society who first assembled there on Tuesday the th of that month but soon after removed to ArundelHouse in the Strand Dr Pope was chosen into the council of the Royal Society in and appointed register of the diocese of Chester March He published in "The Memoirs of Monsieur Du Vall with his last Speech and Epitaph" Claude Du Vall a native of Normandy was a brisk handsome fellow but being a notorious highwayman was hanged at Tyburn Jan and in this pamphlet the Doctor humourously raillied the fashion then prevalent among the ladies of admiring Frenchmen In Dr Pope had very nearly lost his sight by an inflammation which had been of many years continuance but was cured by Dr Turbervill as he handsomely acknowledges in the epitaph he wrote on that eminent oculist He resigned his professorship Sept and in published "The Wish" a wellknown little poem On the th of November that year he lost all his books by a fire in Lombardstreet He published the "Life of Bp Ward in " and

Petty was one chiefly concerned in recovering her Dr Pope was author of several humourous ballads and of many serious treatises in prose which are enumerated in Dr Ward's Lives of the Gresham Professors of which a valuable copy with large MS additions by the author is in The British Museum N    THE wary Gods lock up in cells of night  Future events and laugh at mortals here  If they to pry into them take delight  If they too much presume or too much fear  O man for thy short time below  Enjoy thyself and what the Gods bestow  Unequal fortunes here below are shar'd  Life to a river's course may justly be compar'd  Sometimes within its hed  Without an angry curl or wave  From the springhead  It gently glides to the ocean its grave  Then unawares upon a sudden rain  It madly overflows the neighbouring plain  It ploughs up beauteous ranks  Of trees that shaded and adorn'd its banks  Overturns houses bridges rocks  Drowns shepherds and their flocks  Horror and death rage all the valley o'er  The forests tremble and the mountains roar  THE OLD MAN'S WISH  Some additional stanzas to this poem were handed about in MS in which were taken notice of by "The Observator"It was afterwards enlarged to twenty stanzas and published in folio under the title of "The Wish" a poem which if it had no other merit deserves the highest praise for having given rise to the truly classical imitation of it in the Latin poems of a distinguished ornament of Westminster School the late Mr Vincent Bourne N    BY THE SAME  IF I live to grow old as I find I go down  Let this be my fate in a country town  May I have a warm house with a stone at my gate  And a cleanly young girl to rub my bald pate  May I govern my passion with an absolute sway  And grow wiser and better as my strength wears away  Without gout or stone by a gentle decay  In a country town by a murmuring brook  With th' ocean at distance on which I may look  With a spacious plain without hedge or stile  And an easy pad nag to ride out a mile  May I govern c  With Horace and Plutarch and one or two more  Of the best wits that liv'd in the ages before  With a dish of roastmutton not venison nor teal  And clean though coarse linen at every meal  May I govern c  With a pudding on Sunday and stout humming liquor  And remnants of Latin to puzzle the vicar  With a hidden reserve of Burgundy wine  To drink the king's health as oft as we dine  May I govern c  With a courage undaunted may I face my last day  And when I am dead may the better sort say  " In the morning when sober in the evening when mellow  He is gone and han't left behind him his fellow  For he govern'd his passion with an absolute sway  And grew wiser and better as his strength wore away  Without gout or stone by a gentle decay"  A SONG  ON the bank of a river close under the shade  Young Cleon and Sylvia one evening were laid  The youth pleaded strongly for proof of his love  But honour had won her his flame to reprove  She cried "Where's the lustre when clouds shade the sun  Or what is rich nectar the taste being gone  'Mongst flowers on the stalk sweetest odours do dwell  But if gather'd the rose itself loses the smell"  " Thou dearest of nymphs the brisk shepherd replied  If e'er thou wilt argue begin on Love's side  In matters of state let grave reason be shewn  But love is a power will be ruled by none  Nor should a coy beauty be counted so rare  For scandal can blast both the chaste and the fair  Most fierce are the joys Love's alembick do fi  l  And the roses are sweetest when put to the still"  A SONG  I  YOU I love by all that's true  More than all things here below  With a passion far more great  Than e'er creature loved yet  And yet still you cry "Forbear  Love no more or love not here"  II  Bid the miser leave his ore  Bid the wretched sigh no more  Bid the old be young again  Bid the nun not think of man  Sylvia this when you can do  Bid me then not think of you  III  Love's not a thing of choice but fate  That makes me love that makes you hate  Sylvia then do what you will  Ease or cure torment or kill  Be kind or cruel false or true  Love I must and none but you  A SONG  FAIN would I Chloris ere I die  Bequeath you such a legacy  That you might say when I am gone  None hath the like my heart alone  Were the best gift I could bestow  But that 's already yours you know  So that 'till you my heart resign  Or fill with yours the place of mine  And by that grace my store renew  I shall have nought worth giving you  Whose breast has all the wealth I have  Save a faint carcase and a grave  But had I as many hearts as hairs  As many lives as love has fears  As many lives as years have hours  They should be all and only yours  HERO'S COMPLAINT TO LEANDER  NOR com'st thou yet

Behold the winds and seas deaf and enrag'd  My imprecations have in part assuag'd  Their fury 's past but thou more deaf than they  More merciless torment'st me with delay  If far from hence upon thy native shore  Such high delight thou tak'st why didst thou more  Incite my hot desires with faithless lines  Flattering me with promise that when the winds  Became less high and shores had some repose  If I did but the friendly torch expose  To be thy guide thou would'st not fail to come  The shores have peace the winds and seas are dumb  Thy Hero here attends thee and the light  Invades the horror of the sable night  Come quickly then and in these arms appear  That have been oft thy chiefest calm thy sphere  Wretch that I am 'tis so ye Gods 'tis so  Whilst here I vent to heaven and seas my woe  He at Abydos in a newer flame  Forgets that e'er he heard poor Hero's name  Ah lighter than blossoms or the fleeting air  That sheds them how O how caust thou repair  Thy broken faith is this the dear respect  Thou bear'st to oaths and vows thus to neglect  Both Cytherea and her nun is this  Th' inviolable band of Hymen this  That knot before the sacred altar made  Of seaborn Venus Heavens lend your aid  And arm yourselves in thunder Oh but stay  What vain fear transports thee Hero away  With jealous fury Leander 's thine thou his  And the poor youth at home lamenting is  The wary eyes of his old parents now  Steals from them apace unto the shore now  With hasty hand doth fling his robes from him  And even now bold boy attempts to swim  Parting the swelling waves with ivory arms  Borne up alone by Love's allpowerful charms  Ye gentler peaceful winds if ever Love  Had power in you if ever ye did prove  Least spark of Cupid's flame for pity's sake  With softer gales more smooth and easy make  The troubled flood unto my soul's delight  Ye showers ye storms and tempests black as night  Retire your fury till my love appear  And bless these shores in safety and I here  Within these arms enfold my only treasure  Then all in rage and horror send at pleasure  The frothy billows high as heaven that he  May here be ever forc'd to dwell with me  But hark O wonder what sudden storm is this  Seas menace heaven and the winds do hiss  In scorn of this my just request Retire  Retire my too too venturous love retire  Tempt not the angry seas Ah me ah me  The light the light 's blown out O Gods O deadly  Night Neptune Aeolus ye powerful deities  Spare O spare my jewel pity the cries  And tears of wretched Hero 'tis Leander  Trusts you with his love and life fair Leander  Beau  y of these shores See see the bashful morn  For sorrow of my sad laments hath torn  Through cloudy night a passage to my aid  And here beneath amidst the horrid shade  By her saint light something methinks I see  Resembling my soul's joy Woe 's me 'tis he  Drown'd by th' impetuous flood O dismal hour  Cu  s'd be these seas these shores this light this tower  In spite of fates dear love to thee I come  Leander's bosom shall be Hero's tomb  This Epistle it must be owned furnishes numerous examples of the  false sublime  it is preserved however as containing a poetical spirit though wretchedly expressed N    SONG  I  WHAT art thou Love whence are those charms  That thus thou bea  'st an universal rule  For thee the soldier quits his arms  The king turns slave the wise man fool  II  In vain we chace thee from the field  And with cool thoughts resist thy yoke  Next tide of blood alas we yield  And all those high resolves are broke  III  Can we e'er hope thou should'st be true  Whom we

Whose very soul and life is lust  V  To get our likeness what is that  Our likeness is but misery  Why should I toil to propagate  Another thing as vile as I  VI  From hands divine our spirits came

got the Whig  Whate'er our hotbrain'd sheriffs did advance  Was like our fashions first produc'd in France  And when wornout well scourg'd and banish'd there  Sent over like their godly beggars here  Could the same trick twice play'd our nation gull  It looks as if the devil were grown dull  Or serv'd us up in scorn his broken meat  And thought we were not worth a better cheat  The fulsome Covenant one would think in reason  Had given us all our bellies full of treason  And yet the name but chang'd our nasty nation  C  ws its own excrement th' A  sociation  'Tis true we have not learn'd their poisoning way  For that 's a mode but newly come in play  Besides your drug's uncertain to prevail  But your true Protestant can never fail  With that compendious instrument a flail  Go on and bite e'en though the hook lies bare  Twice in one age expel the lawful heir  Once more decide religion by the sword  And purchase for us a new tyrant lord  Pray for your king but yet your purses spare  Make him not twopence richer by your prayer  To shew you love him much chastise him more  And make him very great and very poor  Push him to wars but still no pence advance  Let him lose England to recover France  Cry freedom up with popular noisy votes  And get enough t  cut each other's throats  Lop all the rights that fence your monarch's throne  For fear of too much power pray leave him none  A noise was made of arbitrary sway  But in revenge you Whigs have found a way  An arbitrary duty now to pay  Let his own servants turn to save their stake  Glean from his plenty and his wants forsake  But let some Judas near his person stay  To swallow the last sop and then betray  Make London independent of the crown  A realm apart the kingdom of the town  Let ignoramus juries find no traitors

trouble this poor play has cost  And faith I doubted once the cause was lost  Yet no one man was meant nor great nor small  Our poets like frank gamesters threw at all  They took no single aim  But like bold boys true to their prince and hearty  Huzza'd and fir'd broadsides at the whole party  Duels are crimes but when the cause is right  In battle every man is bound to fight  For what should hinder me to sell my skin  Dear as I could if once my hand were in  Se defendendo  never was a sin  'Tis a fine world my masters right or wrong  The Whigs must talk and Tories hold their tongue  They must do all they can  But we forsooth must bear a christian mind  And fight like boys with one hand ty'd behind  Nay and when one boy 's down 't were wondrous nice  To cry  box fair  and give him time to rise  When fortune favours none but fools will dally  Would any of you sparks if Nan or Mally  Tipt you th' inviting wink stand shall I shall I  A trimmer cry'd that heard me tell the story  Fie mistress  The actress who spake the epilogue N  Cooke faith you 're too rank a Tory  Wish not Whigs hang'd but pity their hard cases  You women love to see men make wry faces  Pray sir said I don't

hanging is a fine dry kind of death  We Trimmers are for holding all things even  Yesjust like him that hung 'twixt hell and heaven  Have we not had men's lives enough already  Yes surebut you 're for holding all things steady  Now since the weight hangs all on our side brother  You Trimmers should to poize it hang on t'other  Damn'd neuters in their middle way of steering  Are neither f  sh nor flesh nor good redhe  ring  Not Whigs nor Tories they nor this nor that  Not birds nor beasts but just a kind of bat  A twilight animal true to neither cause  With Tory wings but Whiggish teeth and claws  ANOTHER EPILOGUE  BY THE SAME  INTENDED TO HAVE BEEN SPOKEN TO THE PLAY BEFORE IT WAS FORBIDDEN LAST SUMMER  Langbaine says this play found many enemies at its first appearance on the Stage N  TWO houses join'd two poets to a play  You noisy Whigs will sure be pleas'd today  It looks so like two shrieves the city way  But since our discords and divisions cease  You Bilboa gallants learn to keep the peace  Make here no tilts let our poor stage alone  Or if a decent murther must be done  Pray take a civil turn to Marybone  If not I swear we 'll pull up all our benches  Not for your sakes but for our orangewenches  For you thrust wide sometimes and many a spark  That misses one can hit the other mark  This makes our boxes full for men of sense  Pay their four shillings in their own defence  That safe behind the ladies they may stay  Peep o'er the fan  Hence Mr Pope's couplet Essay on Criticism ver  " The modest fan was lifted up no more  " And virgins smil'd at what they blush'd before"  N  and judge the bloody fray  But other foes give beauty worse alarms  The  posse poetarum  's up in arms  No woman's fame their libels has escap'd  Their ink runs venom and their pens are clapt  When sighs and prayers their ladies cannot move  They rail write treason and turn Whigs to love  Nay and I fear they worse designs advance  There 's a damn'd lovetrick now brought o'er from France  We charm in vain and dress and keep a pother  Whilst those false rogues are ogling one another  All sins besides admit some expiation  But this against our sex is plain damnation  They join for libels too these womenhaters  And as they club for love they club for satires  The best on 't is they hurt not for they wear  Stings in their tails their only venom 's there  'Tis true some shot at first the ladies hit  Which able marksmen made and men of wit  But now the fools give fire whose bounce is louder  And yet like mere trainbands they shoot but powder  Libels like plots sweep all in their first fury  Then dwindle like an ignoramus jury  Thus age begins with touzing and with tumbling  But grunts and groans and ends at last in fumbling  HUNTING THE HARE  SONGS of sonnets and rustical roundelays  Forms of fancies are whistled on reeds  Songs to solace young nymphs upon holidays  Are too unworthy for wonderful deeds  Phoebus ingenious  With witty Silenus  His haughty Genius taught to declare  In words better coined  And verse better joined  How stars divined the hunting the Hare  II  Stars enamour'd with pastimes Olympical  Stars and Planets yet beautiful shone  Would no

nephews in chace  Till by her example  Their Father to trample  The Earth old and ample leave them the Air  Neptune the Water  And Wine Liber Pater  And Mars the Slaughter to follow the Hare  IV  Young God Cupid mounted on Pegasus  Beloved of Nymphs with kisses and praise  Strong Alcides upon cloudy Caucasus  Mounted a Centaur which proudly him bare  Postilion of the Sky  Swiftfooted Mercury  Makes his course fly fleet as the air  Yellow Apollo  The kennel doth follow  With whip and hollow after the Hare  V  Young Amyntas thought the Gods came to breathe  After their battle themselves on

celebrated wit was born near London about the year and after receiving some part of his education at Cambridge travelled into France and Flanders At his return he studied the law for some time which he soon exchanged for the belles lettres and commenced dramatic writer in His first comedy "The Comical Revenge" secured to him the general esteem of the publick He was married young to a widow of considerable fortune who would not consent to the match unless he could make her a lady by obtaining the honour of knighthood which he applied for and succeeded His accomplishments procured him the favour of James the Second's queen to whom whilst she was only daughter of the duke of Modena he had dedicated his "Man of Mode" and by her interest and recommendation he was sent envoy to Hamburgh On the Revolution he followed the fortunes of James II and died either in France or very soon after his arrival in England from thence but there was a report that he came to an untimely end by an accident in consequence of inebriation after a social dinner he had given to some friends at Ratisbon He wrote three plays and a number of sprightly poems N    I  CEASE anxious world your fruitless pain  To grasp forbidden store  Your study'd labours shall prove vain  Your alchemy unblest  Whilst seeds of far more precious ore  Are ripen'd in my breast  II  My breast the forge of happier love  Where my Lucinda lives  And the rich stock does so improve  As she her art employs  That every smile and touch she gives  Turns all to golden joys  III  Since thence we can such treasures raise  Let's no expence refuse  In love let's lay out all our days  How can we e'er be poor  When every blessing that we use  Begets a thousand more  SONG  BY THE SAME  IN some kind dream upon her Slumber steal  And to Lucinda all I beg reveal  Breathe gentlest words into her ears  Words full of love but full of fears  Such words as may prevail like prayers  From a poor dying martyr's tongue  By the sweet voice of Pity sung  Touch with the voice the more inchanting lute  To make the charms strike all repulses mute  These may insensibly impart  My tender wishes to her heart  And by a sympathetic force  So tune its strings to Love's discourse  That when my griefs compel a groan  Her sighs may echo to my moan  SONG  BY THE SAME  YE happy swains whose hearts are free  From Love's imperial chain  Take warning and be taught by me  T' avoid th' inchanting pain  Fatal the wolves to trembling flocks  Fierce winds to blossoms prove  To careless seamen hidden rocks  To human quiet Love  Fly the fair sex if bliss you prize  The snake's beneath the flower  Who ever gaz'd on beauteous eyes  That tasted quiet more  How faithless is the lover's joy  How constant is their care  The kind with falsehood do destroy  The cruel with despair  SONG  BY THE SAME  TELL me no more you love in vain  Fair Celia you this passion feign  Can they pretend to love who do  Refuse what love persuades them to  Who once has felt his active flame  Dull laws of honour will disdain  You will be thought his slave and yet  You will not to his power submit  More cruel than those beauties are  Whose coyness wounds us to despair  For all the kindness which you shew  Each smile and kiss which you bestow  Are like those cordials which we give  To dying men to make them live  And languish out an hour in pain  Be kinder Celia or disdain  TO THE MARCHIONESS OF NEWCASTLE  Margaret youngest daughter of Sir Charles Lucas married to the marquis afterwards duke of Newcastle in Jacob says she had a great deal of wit and was the most voluminous dramatic writer of our female poets and Langhaine tells us that all the language and plots of her plays were her own a commendation which will atone for s  me faults in her numerous productions consisting of letters plays poems philosophical discourses and orations all which are enumerated in Ballard's "Memoirs of learned Ladies" Amongst them are "Poems and Phancies" fol  and plays her own life and that of the duke her husband Mr Ballard also refers to two volumes of her Grace's poems in MS She was buried in WestminsterAbbey Jan N  ON HER INCOMPARABLE POEMS  BY THE SAME  MADAM with so much wonder we are struck  When we begin to read your matchless book  A while your own excess of merit stays  Our forward pens and does suspend your praise  Till time our minds does gently recompose  Allays this wonder and our duty shows  Instructs us how your virtues to proclaim  And what we ought to pay to your great fame  Your fame which in your country has no bounds  But wheresoever Learning's known resounds  Those graces Nature did till now divide  Your sex's glory and our sex's pride  Are join'd in you and all to you submit  The brightest beauty and the sharpest wit  No faction here or fiery envy sways  They give you myrtle while we offer bays  What mortal dares dispute those wreaths with you  Arm'd thus with lightning and with thunder too  This made the great Newcastle's heart your prize  Your charming soul and your victorious eyes  Had only power his martial mind to tame  And raise in his heroic breast a flame  A flame which with his courage still aspires  As if immortal fuel fed those fires  This mighty chief and your great self made one  Together the same race of glory run  Together in the wings of fame you move  Like yours his virtue and like yours his love  While we your praise endeavouring to rehearse  Pay that great duty in our humble verse  Such as may justly move your anger you  Like heaven forgive them and accept them too  But what we cannot your brave hero pays  He builds those monuments we strive to raise  Such as to afterages shall make known  While he records your deathless fame his own  So when an artist some rare beauty draws  Both in our wonder share and our applause  His skill from time secures the glorious dame  And makes himself immortal in her fame  THE FORSAKEN MISTRESS  BY THE SAME  PHYLLIS  TELL me gentle Strephon why  You from my embraces fly  Does my love thy love destroy  Tell me I will yet be coy  Stay O stay and I will feign  Though I break my heart disdain  But lest I too unkind appear  For every frown I'll shed a tear  And if in vain I court thy love  Let mine at least thy pity move  Ah while I scorn vouchsafe to woo  Methinks you may dissemble too  STREPHON  Ah Phyllis that you would contrive  A way to keep my love alive  But all your other charms must fail  When kindness ceases to prevail  Alas no less than you I grieve  My dying flame has no reprieve  For I can never hope to find  Should all the nymphs I court be kind  One beauty able to renew  Those pleasures I enjoy in you  When love and youth did both conspire  To fill our breasts and veins with fire  'Tis true some other nymph may gain  That heart which merits your disdain  But second love has still allay  The joys grow aged and decay  Then blame me not for losing more  Than love and beauty can restore  And let this truth thy comfort prove  I would but can no longer love  TO A VERY YOUNG LADY  BY THE SAME  SWEETEST bud of beauty may  No untimely frost decay  The early glories which we trace  Blooming in thy matchless face  But kindly opening like the rose  Fresh beauties every day disclose  Such as by nature are not shown  In all the blossoms she has blown  And then what conquest shall you make  Who hearts already daily take  Scorch'd in the morning with thy beams  How shall we bear those sad extremes  Which must attend thy threatening eyes  When thou shalt to thy noon arise  THE DIVIDED HEART  BY THE SAME  AH Celia that I were but sure  Thy love like mine could still endure  That time and absence which destroy  The cares of lovers and their joy  Could never rob me of that part  Which you have given me of your heart  Others unenvy'd might possess  Whole hearts and boast that happiness  'Twas nobler fortune to divide  The Roman empire in her pride  Than on some low and barbarous throne  Obscurely plac'd to rule alone  Love only from thy heart exacts  The several debts thy face contracts  And by that new and juster way  Secures thy empire and his sway  Favouring but one he might compel  The hopeless lover to rebel  But should he other hearts thus share  That in the whole so worthless are  Should into several squadrons draw  That strength which kept intire could awe  Men would his scatter'd powers deride  And conquering him those spoils divide  ON THE TRANSLATIONS OF MR J N  I cannot discover these initials N  OUT OF THE FRENCH AND ITALIAN  BY THE SAME  WHILE others toil our country to supply  With what we need only for luxury  Spices and silk in the rich East provide  To glut our avarice and feed our pride  You foreign learning prosperously transmit  To raise our virtue and provoke our wit  Such brave designs your generous foul inflame  To be a bold adventurer for fame  How much oblig'd are Italy and France  While with your voice their musick you advance  Your growing fame with envy can oppose  Who sing with no less art than they compose  In these attempts so few have had success  Their beauties suffer in our English dress  By artless hands spoil'd of their native air  They seldom pass from moderately fair  As if you meant these injuries to atone  You give them charms more conquering than their own  Not like the dull laborious flatterer  With secret art those graces you confer  The skilful painters with slight strokes impart  That subtle beauty which affects the heart  There are who publicly profess they hate  Translations and yet all they write translate  So proud they scorn to drive a lawful trade  Yet by their wants are shameless pirates made  These you incense while you their thefts reveal  Or else prevent in what they meant to steal  From all besides you are secure of praise  But you so high our expectation raise  A general discontent we shall declare  If such a workman only should repair  You to the dead your piety have shewn  Adorn'd their monuments now build your own  Drawn in the East we in your lines may trace  That genius which of old inspir'd the place  The banish'd Muses back to Greece you bring  Where their best airs you so divinely sing  The world must own they are by you restor'd  To sacred shades where they were first ador'd  VOITURE'S  This polite and elegant writer who was born at Amiens in and died in was famous for introducing new and easy graces into the French language and giving a more agreeable turn to many trite and familiar modes of expression by a happiness peculiar to himself His irony has been particularly admired for its singularity and address but it has been observed that few authors have suffered so much by translation his native beauties being of too delicate a kind to be copied in a foreign language Voiture as well as the courtly Waller was the poet of the sair and both Mr Granger observes have celebrated the charming countess of Carlisle N  URANIA  BY THE SAME  HOPELESS I languish out my days  Struck with Urania's conquering eyes  The wretch at whom she darts these rays  Must feel the wound until he dies  Though endless be her cruelty  Calling her beauties to my mind  I bow beneath her tyranny  And dare not murmur she's unkind  Reason this tameness does upbraid  Proffering to arm in my defence  But when I call her to my aid  She's more a traitor than my sense  No sooner I the war declare  But strait her succour she denies  And joining forces with the fair  Confirms the conquest of her eyes  TO SYLVIA  BY THE SAME  THE nymph that undoes me is fair and unkind  No less than a wonder by nature design'd  She 's the grief of my heart the joy of my eye  And the cause of a flame that never can die  Her mouth from whence wit still obligingly flows  Has the beautiful blush and the smell of the rose  Love and destiny both attend on her will  She wounds with a look with a frown she can kill  The desperate lover can hope no redress  Where beauty and rigour are both in excess  In Sylvia they meet so unhappy am I  Who sees her must love and who loves her must die  TO A LADY WHO FLED THE SIGHT OF HIM  BY THE SAME  IF I my Celia could persuade  To see those wounds her eyes have made  And hear whilst I that passion tell  Which like herself does so excel  How soon we might be freed from care  She need not fear nor I despair  Such beauty does the nymph protect  That all approach her with respect  And can I offer violence  Where love does join in her defence  This guard might all her fears disperse  Did she with savages converse  Then my Celia would surprize  With what's produc'd by her own eyes  Those matchless flames which they inspir  In her own breast should raise a fire  For love but with more subtle art  As well as beauty charms the heart  TO A LADY ASKING HIM HOW LONG HE WOULD LOVE HER  BY THE SAME  IT is not Celia in our power  To say how long our love will last  It may be we within this hour  May lose those joys we now do taste  The blessed that immortal be  From change in love are only free  Then since we mortal lovers are  Ask not how long our love will last  But while it does let us take care  Each minute be with pleasure past  Were it not madness to deny  To live because we are sure to die  TO THE MEMORY OF MR DRYDEN  I am sorry that I cannot trace out the author of this excellent poem N  IF generous gratitude could e'er excuse  The sallies of a longneglected Muse  Mine pleads that cause alone and so should be  From censure or malicious pity free  For all the pleasures she from Dryden knew  She pays this tribute and she thinks it due  Still had she slept unmov'd by all beside  No rhymes attempted and no numbers try'd  If to another man he could impart  His real nature and his wondrous art  Both did he temper right and raise from thence  Unrival'd numbers and unequal sense  Most that remain for so to me they seem  Are but the shadows and the ghosts of him  Some few it is confess'd have gain'd their cause  And justify'd their merit by applause  'Tis true their diction 's good their style is clear  And art and labour through the whole appear  But let us search them well where shall we find  His force of thought his energy of mind  The words that move us with mysterious charms  The soul that actuates and the fire that warms  A ghost sometimes appears to mortal view  And bears the shape of humankind but not the substance too  Words are like colours in two artists' hands  Of different skill where each the best commands  One paints and pleases but the pleasure lies  Not in the mind but only in the eyes  The colours justly mix'd delude the sight  And gaily shining give a false delight  For far from thence is honest Nature chac'd  Asham'd to see herself so much disgrac'd  Not so the other whose superior art  To lifeless colours can a living soul impart  Bold are his strokes but manag'd still with care  For Nature always claims the better share  Colours proportion distance are combin'd  To please the sight and strength to charm the mind  Yet not the best a full perfection gain'd  But in one province still the painter reign'd  Water and land a different master own  And history is always found alone  Peculiar hands give trees and flowers the best  The mimic drolls below distinguish'd from the rest  Our wondrous bard whose comprehending soul  Could reach all Nature and describe her whole  To single beauties scorn'd to be confin'd  But shew'd the vigour of extensive mind  In all the nice proportions we behold  Like Angelo correct like Titian bold  If homely cots or humble shepherds ways  Employ'd his Muse how calmly did they please  And sink our passions to a rural ease  Or when he sung th' excesses of the great  High palaces the trifling pomp of state  Th' ungovern'd soul her reason laid aside  Took the fond hint and was debas'd to pride  Landskip in all its various face he shew'd  Here winding rivers through the meadows flow'd  And there the fruitful trees complain'd th' unequal load  Here mountains rise aloft and dare the sky  There dreary caves the face of Nature fly  Here night a pleasing horror does display  And with its gloomy charms excels the day  There the bright morn expands its radiant wings  And gives new vigour with the light it brings  His universal Muse with equal ease  Could paint or dismal storms or calmest seas  The miseries of war and joys of peace  But what nor paint can tell nor pencil reach  His larger genius could divinely teach  Describe the inner passions of the man  And show the steps from whence they first began  Love he describ'd though different are its ways  How the first fluttering pain disturbs our days  And gives our nights but half their usual ease  Then our kind thoughts improve the passion higher  'Tis restless rage 'tis covetous desire  And love unbounded and impetuous fire  Till at the last with extasy we find  Extremest pleasures in one moment join'd  And joys immense which leave all other joys behind  O Anthony how nobly dost thou charm  O Cleopatra how dost thou disarm  The roughest spirits and the coldest warm  "All for Love or the World well lost" a tragedy by Mr Dryden in imitation of Shakspeare's "Anthony and Cleopatra" N

she with reason sought  A certain pleasure and imagin'd fault  But boldly urg'd the argument she should  Th' impulse of nature and the force of blood  So did he move the soul so touch the heart  With virgin passions not debauch'd by art  Thus could he talk of love and lovers' deeds  Yet give a loose to rage and manly rage succeeds  His satire free impartial and severe  At once gave pleasure and created fear  Who would not read what he so justly writ  But who would be the subject of his wit  Could but our modern satirists have known  His way of satire they 'd despise their own  Soon would they see the sharpest Muse disclaims  Illmanner'd language and opprobrious names  That sordid railing is the poor retreat  Of angry malice or unmanly wit  He shews what we from him alone can feel  Satire may bite and yet may be genteel  Audacious fancy fain would hurry on  And tread those paths which reason ought to shun  For Homer and the Mantuan are in view  A dangerous chace nor must my Muse pursue  O'er steepy hills tremendous to the sight  Their fiery coursers kept an equal flight  His close pursued nor fear'd the dismal height  My humble Muse looks upward with despair  Admires their strength but wonders how they dare  Attempt the regions of the upper air  Suffice it her to say he never fail'd  Wherever his adventurous Muse assail'd  And all attempting he in all prevail'd  What more had he to do his conquering lays  Were above censure and commanded praise  Secure of fame he laid the laurel down  Enough distinguish'd by his sense alone  And smil'd to see with a disdainful air  Contending rhymers use their utmost care  To reach that bays they want the head to bear  Fatigu'd with life with pleasure he retir'd  From the vain world both envy'd and admir'd  HORACE BOOK II ODE XI IMITATED  BY JOHN HOWE  "Younger brother of Sir Scroop Howe a good family in Nottinghamshire but this gentleman settled in Gloucestershire where being chosen a member of parliament he soon made a good figure in the House of Commons He seemed to be pleased with and joined in the Revolution and was made vicechamberlain to Queen Mary but having asked a grant which was refused him and given to Lord Portland he fell from the court and was all that reign the most violent and open antagonist King William had in the House A great enemy to Foreigners settling in England most clauses in acts against them being brought in by him He is indefatigable in whatever he undertakes witness the Old East India Company whose cause he maintained till he fixed it upon as sure a foot as the New even when they thought themselves past recovery He lives up to what his visible estate can afford and yet purchases instead of running in debt He is endued with good natural parts attended with an unaccountable boldness daring to say what he pleases and will be heard out so that he passeth with some for the shrew of the House On the Queen's accession to the throne he was made a privycounsellor and paymaster of the guards and garrisons He is a tall thin palefaced man with a very wild look brave in his person bold in expressing himself a violent enemy a sure friend and seems to be always in a hurry Near fifty years old"  Such is the character given of this gentleman by Macky in Mr Howe was author of "A Panegyric on King William" and of several little poems and is introduced in Swift's

strictest piety  Defer incroaching age  Or Death's resistless rage  If you each day  A hecatomb of bulls should slay  The smoaking host could not subdue  The tyrant to be kind to you  From Geryon's head he snatch'd the triple crown  Into th' infernal lake the monarch tumbled down  The prince and peasant of this world must be  Thus wasted to eternity  In vain from bloody wars are mortals free  Or the rough storms of the tempestuous sea  In vain they take such care  To shield their bodies from autumnal air  Dismal Cocytus they must ferry o'er  Whose languid stream moves dully by the shore  And in their passage we shall see  Of tortur'd ghosts the various misery  Thy stately house thy pleasing wife  And children blessings dear as life  Must all be left nor shalt thou have  Of all thy grateful plants one tree  Unless the dismal cypress follow thee  The shortliv'd lord of all to thy cold grave  But the imprison'd Burgundy  Thy jolly heir shall straight set free  Releas'd from lock and key the sparkling wine  Shall flow and make the drunken pavement shine  HORACE BOOK IV ODE XIII  I  LYCE the Gods have heard my prayer  Lyce the proud the charming and the fair  Lyce is old though wanton still and gay  You laugh and sing and play  Now beauty fails with wine you'd raise desire  And with your trembling voice would fan our dying fire  II  In vain for Love long since forsook  Thy snowy hair thy falling teeth and withering look  He Chia's blooming face  Adorns with every grace  Her wit her eyes her every glance are darts  That with resistless force invade our hearts  III  Not all your art nor all your dress  Though grown to a ridiculous excess  Though you by lovers' spoils made fine  In richest silks and jewels shine  And with their borrow'd light  Surprize the dazzled sight  Can your fled youth recal recal one day  Which flying Time on his swift wings has borne away  IV  Ah where are all thy beauties fled  Where all the charms that so adorn'd the tender maid  Ah where the nameless graces that were seen  In all thy motions and thy mien  What now oh what is of that Lyce left  By which I once was of my sense and of my soul bereft  V  Of her who with my Cynara strove  And shar'd my doubtful love  Yet fate and the last unrelenting hour  Seiz'd her gay youth and pluck'd the springing flower  But angry heaven has reserv'd thee  That you with rage might see  With rage might see your beauties fading glory fly  And your short youth and tyrannous power before you die  VI  That your insulting lovers might return  Pride for your pride and with retorted scorn  Glut their revenge and satiate all their pain  With cruel pleasure and with sharp disdain  Might laugh to see that fire which once so burn'd  Shot such resistless flames to ashes turn'd  HORACE BOOK IV ODE VII  WINTER'S dissolv'd behold a world's new face  How grass the ground how leaves their branches grace  That earth which would not to the ploughshare yield  Is softer now and easy to be till'd  And frozen streams thaw'd by th' approaching sun  With whispering murmurs in their channels run  The naked nymphs and graces dance around  And o'er the flowery meadows nimbly bound  The months that run on Time's immortal wheels  The seasons treading on each other's heels  The winged hours that swiftly pass away  And spightfully consume the smiling day  Tell us that all things must with them decay  The year rolls round us in a constant ring  And sultry summer wastes the milder spring  Whose hot meridian quickly overpast  Declines to autumn which with bounteous haste  Comes crown'd with grapes but suddenly is crost  Cold winter nips his vintage with a frost  The moon renews its orb to shine more bright  But when death's hand puts out our mortal light  With us alas 'tis ever ever night  With Tullus and with Ancus we shall be  And the brave souls of vanish'd heroes see  Who knows if Gods above who all things sway  Will suffer thee to live another day  Then please thy genius and betimes take care  To leave but little to thy greedy heir  When among crouds of ghosts thou shalt appear  And from the judge thy fatal sentence hear  Not birth nor eloquence nor wealth nor all  That thou canst plead can the pass'd doom recal  Diana though a Goddess cannot take  Her chaste Hippolytus from Lethe's lake  Perithous bound in fetters must remain  Theseus no more can break his adamantine chain  HORACE BOOK II ODE X  WE must all live and we would all live well  But how to do it very few can tell  He sure does best who a true mean can keep  Nor boldly sails too far into the deep  Nor yet too fearfully creeps near the land  And runs the danger of the rocks and sand  Who to that happy medium can attain  " Who neither seeks for nor despises gain  " Who neither sinks too low nor aims too high"  He shuns th' unwholsome ills of poverty  And is secure from envy which attends  A sumptuous table and a croud of friends  Their treacherous height doth the tall pines expose  To the rude blast of every wind that blows  And lofty towers unfortunately high  Are near their ruin as they 're near the sky  And when they fall what was their pride before  Serves only then t' increase their fall the more  Who wisely governs and directs his mind  Never despairs though Fortune be unkind  He hopes and though he finds he hop'd in vain  He bears it patiently and hopes again  And if at last a kinder fate conspires  To heap upon him more than he desires  He then suspects the kindness he enjoys  Takes it with thanks but with such care employs  As if that Fate weary of giving more  Would once resume what it bestow'd before  He finds man's life by an eternal skill  Is temper'd equally with good and ill  Fate shapes our lives as it divides the years  Hopes are our summer and our winter's fears  And 'tis by an unerring rule decreed  That this shall that alternately succeed  Therefore when Fate's unkind dear friend be wise  And bear its ills without the least surprize  The more you are oppress'd bear up the more  Weather the tempest till its rage be o'er  But if too prosperous and too strong a gale  Should rather ruffle than just fill your sail  Lessen it and let it take but so much wind  As is proportion'd to the course design'd  " For 'tis the greatest part of human skill  " To use good fortune and to bear our ill"  HORACE BOOK I EP XVIII  DEAR friend for surely I may call him so  Who doth so well the laws of friendship know  I'm sure you mean the kindness you profess  And to be lov'd by you 's a happiness  Not like him who with eloquence and pains  The specious title of a friend obtains  And the next day to please some man of sense  Breaks jests at his deluded friend's expence  As jilts who by a quick compendious way  To gain new lovers do the old betray  There is another failing of the mind  Equal to this of a quite different kind  I mean that rude uncultivated skill  Which some have got of using all men ill  Out of a zealous and unhewn pretence  Of freedom and a virtuous innocence  Who 'cause they cannot fawn betray nor cheat  Think they may push and justle all they meet  And blame whate'er they see complain and brawl  And think their virtues make amends for all  They neither comb their head nor wash their face  But think their virtuous nastiness a grace  Whenas true virtue in a medium lies  And that to turn to either hand 's a vice  Others there are who too obsequious grown  Live more for others pleasure than their own  Applauding whatsoe'er they hear or see  By a too nauseous civility  And if a man of title or estate  Doth some strange story true or false relate  Obsequiously they cringe and vouch it all  Repeat his words and catch them as they fall  As schoolboys follow what the masters say  Or like an actor prompted in a play  Some men there are so full of their own sense  They take the least dispute for an offence  And if some wiser friend their heat restrains  And says the subject is not worth their pains  Straight they reply What I have said is true  And I'll defend it against him and you  And if he still dares say 'tis not I'll die  Rather than not maintain he says a lye  Now would you see from whence these heats arise  And where th' important contradiction lies  'Tis but to know if when a client 's prest  Sawyer  Sir Robert Sawyer Attorney General from to He was the manager for James the Second in

obscurity and we hear no more of him R  pleads his cause the best  Or if to Windsor he most minutes gains  Who goes by Colebrook or who goes by Staines  Who spends his wealth in pleasure and at play  And yet affects to be wellcloath'd and gay  And comes to want and yet dreads nothing more  Than to be thought necessitous and poor  Him his rich kinsman is afraid to see  Shuns like a burthen to the family  And rails at vices which have made him poor  Though he himself perhaps hath many more  Or tells him wisely Cousin have a care  And your expences with your rents compare  Since you inherit but a small estate  Your pleasures cousin must be moderate  I know you think to huff and live like me  Cousin my wealth supports my vanity  But they who 've wit and not estate enough  Must cut their coat according to their stuff  Therefore forbear t' affect equality  Forget you 've such a foolish friend as me  There was a courtier who to punish those  Whom though below him he believ'd his foes  And more effectually to vent his rage  Sent them fine cloaths and a new equipage  For then the foolish sparks courageous grown  Set up for roaring bullies of the town  Must go to plays and in the boxes sit  Then to a whore and live like men of wit  Till at the last their coach and horses spent  Their cloaths grown dirty and their ribbons rent  Their fortune chang'd their appetite the same  And 'tis too late their follies to reclaim  They must turn porters or in taverns wait  And buy their pleasures at a cheaper rate  And 'midst their dirty mistresses and wives  Lead out the rest of their mistaken lives  Never be too inquisitive to find  The hidden secrets of another's mind  For when you 've torn one secret from his breast  You run great risque of losing all the rest  And if he should unimportun'd impart  His secret thoughts and trust you with his heart  Let not your drinking anger pride or lust  Ever invite you to betray the trust  First never praise your own designs and then  Ne'er lessen the designs of other men  Nor when a friend invites you any where  To set a partridge or to chace a hare  Beg he'd excuse you for this once and say  You must go home and study all the day  So 'twas that once Amphion jealous grown  That Zethus lov'd no pleasures but his own  Was forc'd to give his brother's friendship o'er  Or to resolve to touch his lyre no more  He chose the safest and the wisest way  And to oblige his brother left his play  Do you the same and for the selfsame end  Obey your civil importuning friend  And when he leads his dogs into the plain  Quit your untimely labours of the brain  And leave your serious studies that you may  Sup with an equal pleasure on the prey  Hunting 's an old and honourable sport  Lov'd in the country and esteem'd at court  Healthful to th' body pleasing to the eye  And practis'd by our old nobility  Who see you love the pleasures they admire  Will equally approve what you desire  Such condescension will more friendship gain  Than the best rules which your wise books contain  Talk not of others lives or have a care  Of whom you talk to whom and what and where  For you don't only wound the man you blame  But all mankind who will expect the same  Shun all inquisitive and curious men  For what they hear they will relate again  And he who hath impatient craving ears  Hath a loose tongue to utter all he hears  And words like th' moving air of which they 're fram'd  When once let loose can never be reclaim'd  Where you 've access to a rich powerful man  Govern your mind with all the care you can  And be not by your foolish lust betray'd  To court his cousin or debauch his maid  Lest with a little portion and the pride  Of being to the family ally'd  He gives you either with which bounty blest  You must quit all pretensions to the rest  Or lest incens'd at your attempt and griev'd  You should abuse the kindness you receiv'd  He coldly thwarts your impotent desire  Till you at last chuse rather to retire  Than tempt his anger any more and so  Lose a great patron and a mistress too  Next have a care what men you recommend  To th' service or esteem of your rich friend  Lest for his service or esteem unfit  They load you with the faults which they commit  But as the wisest men with all their skill  May be deceiv'd and place their friendship ill  So when you see you 've err'd you must refuse  To defend those whom their own crimes accuse  But if through envy of malicious men  They be accus'd you must protect them then  And plead their cause yourself for when you see  Him you commend attack'd with infamy  Know that 'tis you they hate when him they blame  Him they have wounded but at you they aim  And when your neighbour's house is set on fire  You must his safety as your own conspire  Such hidden fires though in the suburbs cast  Neglected may consume the town at last  They who don't know the dangers which attend  The glittering court of a rich powerful friend  Love no estate so much and think they 're blest  When they make but a leg amongst the rest  But they who 've try'd it and with prudent care  Do all its honours and its ills compare  ear to engage lest with their time and pain  They lose more pleasure than they hop'd to gain  See you that while your vessel 's under sail  You make your best advantage of the gale  Lest the wind changes and some stormy rain  Should throw you back to your first port again  You must endeavour to dispose your mind  To please all humours of a different kind  Whose temper 's serious and their humour sad  They think all blithe and merry men are mad  They who are merry and whose humour 's free  Abhor a sad and serious gravity  They who are slow and heavy can't admit  The friendship of a quick and ready wit  The slothful hate the busy active men  And are detested by the same again  They whose free humour prompts them to be gay  To drink all night and revel all the day  Abhor the man that can his cups refuse  Though his untimely virtue to excuse  He swears that one such merry drinking feast  Would make him sick for a whole week at least  Suffer no cloud to dwell upon your brow  The modest men are thought obscure and low  And they who an affected silence keep  Are thought to be too rigid sour and deep  Amongst all other things do not omit  To search the writings of great men of wit  And in the conversation of the wise  In what true happiness and pleasure lies  Which are the safest rules to live at ease  And the best way to make all fortunes please  Lest through the craving hopes of gaining more  And fear of losing what you gain'd before  Your poor unsatisfy'd misguided mind  To needy wishes and false joys confin'd  Puts its free boundless searching thoughts in chains  And where it sought its pleasure finds its pains  If virtuous thoughts and if a prudent heart  Be given by nature or obtain'd by art  What lessens care the mind's uneasy pain  And reconciles us to ourselves again  Which doth the truest happiness create  Unblemish'd honour or a great estate  Or a safe private quiet which betrays  Itself to ease and cheats away the days  When I 'm at where my kind fate  Hath plac'd my little moderate estate  Where nature's care hath equally employ'd  Its inward treasures and its outward pride  What thoughts d' ye think those easy joys inspire  What do you think I covet and desire  'Tis that I may but undisturb'd possess  The little I have and if heaven pleases less  That I to nature and myself may give  The little time that I have left to live  Some books in which I some new thoughts may find  To entertain and to refresh my mind  Some horses which may help me to partake  The lawful pleasures which the seasons make  An easy plenty which at least may spare  The frugal pains of a domestic care  A friend if that a faithful friend there be  Who can love such an idle life and me  Then heaven give me but life and health I'll find  A grateful soul and a contented mind  HORACE BOOK II ODE III  I  BE calm my Delius and serene  However Fortune change the scene  In thy most dejected state  Sink not underneath the weight  Nor yet when happy days begin  And the full tide comes rolling in  Let a fierce unruly joy  The settled quiet of thy mind destroy  However Fortune change the scene  Be calm my Delius and serene  II  Be thy lot good or be it ill  Life ebbs out at the same rate still  Whether with busy cares opprest  You wear the sullen time away  Or whether to sweet ease or rest  You sometimes give a day  Carelessly laid  Underneath a friendly shade  By pines and poplars mixt embraces made  Near a river's sliding stream  Fetter'd in sleep bless'd with a golden dream  III  Here here in this muchenvy'd state  Let every blessing on thee wait  Bid the Syrian nard be brought  Bid the hidden wine be sought  And let the rose's shortliv'd flower  The smiling daughter of an hour  Flourish on thy brow  Enjoy the very very now  While the good hand of life is in  While yet the fatal sisters spin  IV  A little hence my friend and thou  Must into other hands resign  Thy gardens and thy parks and all that now  Bears the pleasing name of thine  Thy meadows by whose planted tides  Silver Tyber gently glides  Thy pleasant houses all must go  The gold that 's hoarded in them too  A jolly heir shall set it free  And give th' imprison'd monarchs liberty  V  Nor matters it what figure here  Thou dost among thy fellowmortals bear  How thou wert born or how begot  Impartial Death matters it not  With what titles thou dost shine  Or who was first of all thy line  Life's vain amusements amidst which we dwell  Nor weigh'd nor understood by the grim god of hell  VI  In the same road alas all travel on  By all alike the same sad journey must be gone  Our blended lots together lie  Mingled in one common urn  Sooner or later out they fly  The fatal boat then wafts us to the shore  Whence we never shall return  Nevernever more  THE GROVE  SEE how Damon's age appears  This grove declares his fading years  For this he planted once and eat  The maiden fruits of what he set  Young it was then like him but now  Sapless and old is every bough  Thus my Lesbia will it be  In time to come with thee and me  Come then in love and youthful play  Let 's pass the smiling hours away  Before this tender amorous mark  Grow wide upon its fading bark  And shew like Damon's grove that we

gratefully inscribed an Idyllium of Theocritus He was sent by Colonel Strangeways to Wadham College in Oxford where he was admitted a scholar on the foundation and took the degree of BA June The reputation acquired by his Lucretius which he published when very young recommended him to All Souls College where he was elected Fellow in proceeded BD March and was presented by that College to the living of Welwyn in Hertfordshire but through some disappointment either in love or in his expectations laid violent hands on himself in before he had taken possession of his living "He was a man" says Jacob  "of excellent parts sound judgement and perfectly master of the Greek and Latin languages but naturally of a morose temper and too apt to despise the understandings and performances of others This made him less esteemed than his great merit deserved and his resentments on this account frequently engaged him in those heats and disputes which in the end proved fatal to him"  On his father's monument at Blandford he is called  "The learned muchadmired and muchenvied Mr Creech"  He translated Lucretius Theocritus and Horace some eclogues of Virgil and some of the satires of Juvenal N    Aristaeus having lost his bees goes by his mother's direction to Proteus to know why the Gods had sent this plague Proteus tells him they sent it to revenge the injury he had done Orpheus in being the cause of his bride's death and so goes on with the story of his passion  NOW scorching Sirius burnt the thirsty moors  And seas contracted left their naked shores  The earth lay chopp'd no spring supply'd his flood  And midday rays boil'dup the streams to mud  When Proteus coming to his usual cave  The seacalf following spouts the brackish wave  Spread o'er the sand the scatter'd monsters lay  He like a shepherd at the close of day  When heifers seek their stalls and round a rock  The bleating lambs the hungry wolves provoke  Sits midst the beach and counts the scaly flock  Scarce was he laid scarce sleep had seal'd his eyes  When Aristaeus eager to surprize  Invades and binds him straight he starts and roars  And with shrill noises fills the echoing shores  He flies to his old arts and strives to 'scape  By frequent change and varying of his shape  All monstrous forms put on he would appear  A flame a flood a lion or a bear  When nought avail'd he turn'd himself again  And thus spoke with the accent of a man  By whose advice hast thou so rashly prest  Bold youth on me And what do'st thou request  You know great God you know the swain reply'd  For who can cheat you who his wants can hide  But strive to change no more I humbly come  And by the Gods commands to know my doom  For what I'm punish'd whence these plagues arose  And by what means I may retrieve my loss  This said the angry God with fury shook  His eyes shot flame and horror chang'd his look  He gnash'd his teeth and thus at last he spoke  No common Gods no common Gods pursue  Thou suffer'st what to thy great crimes is due  At wretched Orpheus' suit these plagues commence  Though fate being kind too small for thy offence  To heaven's strict justice he his wrongs apply'd  And call'd down vengeance for his perish'd bride  She while she fled from thee unhappy maid  By heedless fear to treacherous banks betray'd  Ne'er saw the snake glide o'er the grassy ground  But ere she knew the foe she felt the wound  Her fellow Dr  ads fill'd the hills with cries  In groans the soften'd Rhodope replies  Rough Thrace the Getes and Hebrus' streams lament  Forget their fury and in grief consent  While he to doleful tunes his strings does move  And strove to solace his uneasy love  Thee thee dear bride on desart shores alone  He mourn'd at rising and at setting sun  His restless love did natural fears expel  He dar'd to enter the black jaws of hell  He saw the grove where gloomy horrors spread  The ghost and ghastly tyrant of the dead  With those rough powers that there severely reign  Unus'd to pity when poor men complain  He strook his harp and strait a numerous throng  Of airy people fled to hear the song  Thither vast troops of wretched lovers came  And shriek'd at the remembrance of their flame  With heavy grief and gloomy thoughts opprest  Meag  e each shape and wounds in every breast  How deep ah me and wide must mine appear  If so much beauty can be so severe  With these mixt troops of fathers husbands wives  As thick as swarms of bees fly round their hives  At evening close or when a tempest drives  With ghosts of heroes and of babes expos'd  And sons whose dying eyes their mothers clos'd  Which now the dull unnavigable flood  With black Cocytus' horrid weeds and mud  And Styx in nine large channels spread confine  There is no line corresponding with this in any edition that I have seen N    The wondrous numbers softened all beneath  Hell and the inmost flinty seats of death  Snakes round the Furies heads did upward rear  And seem'd to listen to the pleasing air  While fiery Styx in milder streams did roll  And Cerberus gap'd but yet forbore to howl  Ixion's wheel stood still all tortures ceas'd  And hell amaz'd knew an unusual rest  All dangers past beyond the reach of fear  Restor'd Eurydice breath'd the upper air  Following behind for mov'd by his complaint  Hell added this condition to the grant  When Fury soon the heedless lover seiz'd  To be forgiven if hell could be appeas'd  For near the confines of aetherial air  Unmindful and unable to forbear  He stopt look'd back what cannot Love persuade  To take one view of the unhappy maid  Here all his pains were lost one greedy look  Defeats his hopes and hell's conditions broke  Thrice Styx resounded thrice Avernus shook  A fatal messenger from Pluto flew  And snatch'd the forfeit from a second view  Backward she fell ah me too greedy youth  She cry'd what Fury now hath ruin'd both  Death summons me again cold fates surprize  And icy sleep spreads o'er my nodding eyes  Wrapt up in night I feel the Stygian shore  And stretch my arms to thee in vain ah thine no more  This scarce pronounc'd like smoke dispers'd in air  So vanish'd the twicelost unhappy fair  And left him catching at the flying shade  He stood distracted much he would have said  In vain for Charon would not waft him o'er  Once he had pass'd and now must hope no more  What should he do Where should he seek repose  Where fly the trouble of his second loss  In what soft numbers should the wretch complain  And beg his dear Eurydice again  She now grew cold in Charon's boat beneath  And sadly sail'd to the known seats of death  But while nine circling months in order turn'd  Beneath black rocks thus fame reports he mourn'd  By freezing Strymon's unfrequented stream  Eurydice his lost Eurydice his theme  And while he sang this sad event of love  He tam'd fierce tigers and made oaks to move  With such soft tunes and such a doleful song  Sweet nightingales bewail their ravish'd young  Which some hardhearted swain hath borne away  While ca  low birds or kill'd the easy prey  Restless they sit renew their mournful strains  And with sad passion fill their neighbouring plains  No face could win him and no charms could move  He fled the heinous thoughts of second love  In vain the Thracians woo'd wit wealth esteem  Those great enticers lost their force on him  Alone he wander'd through the Scythian snows  Where icy Tanaïs freezeth as it flows  Through fields still white with frost or beat with hail  Constant to grief and eager to bewail  Eurydice the Gods vain gift employs  His thoughts and makes him deaf to other joys  The slighted Thracians heat this scorn encreas'd  They breath'd revenge and fir'd at Bacchus' feast  For what so soon as wine makes fury burn  And what can wound a maid so deep as scorn  Full of their God they wretched Orpheus tore  Scatter'd his limbs and drank his reeking gore  His head torn off as Hebrus roll'd along  Eurydice fell from his dying tongue  His parting soul when flying through the wound  Cry'd Ah Eurydice the floods around  Eurydice Eurydice the banks resound  ECLOGUE  BY LORD FALKLAND  Lucius Cary eldest son of the first lord viscount of Falkland was born about and received his academical learning first at Trinity College Dublin and then at St John's Cambridge He entered early into the service of Charles I and was shot at the battle of Newbury Sept  "The character of Lord Falkland by the Earl of Clarendon is the completest if not the finest of any in his admirable history He is represented as an assemblage of almost every virtue and excellency that can dignify or adorn a man This encomium is doubtless somewhat exaggerated but there seems to be much truth in it with respect to the private part of his life as it appears to have been taken from near and repeated views A great man in public rather appears to be what it is his interest or inclination to be thought than what he is The Earl of Clarendon who knew Lord Falkland in private life seems therefore to have given us a juster portrait of him than if he had seen him only in his public character It must be acknowledged that he has drawn him to great advantage but we are not to impute this to the least disregard to truth but to the amiable lights in which his friendship had placed him A friend who draws the portrait of another friend is apt to bestow as much heightening upon it as a painter would in finishing the picture of his mistress"  This extract from Mr Granger is given without the most distant inclination of  "throwing a shade on a virtue the brightest and purest that hath done honour to these later ages"  see Bp Hurd's excellent Dialogues vol I p Before he was twentythree years of age he had read over all the Greek and Latin fathers and was indefatigable in collecting books of value He has given specimens of his own abilities as a poet a politician and a polemic writer but his "Discourse of the Infallibility of the Church of Rome" which is written in an easy and familiar style without the least affectation of learning is the most considerable of his Works It is remarked by Doctor Swift that in some of Lord Falkland's writings  "when he doubted whether a word was perfectly intelligible or no he used to consult one of his lady's chambermaids not the waitingwoman because it was possible she might be conversant in romances and by her judgment was guided whether to receive or reject it"  N    ON THE DEATH OF BEN JONSON  Ben Jonson a most celebrated English poet in his time died Aug in his d year He is generally represented as surly and morose by the writers of the present time though from the attention shewn to him by his contemporaries it might be suspected that the charge was not well founded Certain it is that he died much lamented and in the beginning of his memory was embalmed by the tears of the Muses in a collection of elegies and poems under the title of "Jonsonius Virbius or The Memorie of Ben Jonson revived by the Friends of the Muses" In this collection were poems by most of the men of genius of that age One by Mr Waller is in his Poems p another by Cartwright in this volume p Those of

glad  Our Gods are troubled and our prince is sad  He  Apollo N  chiefly who bestows light health and art  Feels this sharp grief pierce his immortal heart  He his neglected lyre away hath thrown  And wept a larger nobler Helicon  To find his herbs which to his wish prevail  For the less lov'd should his own favourite fail  So moan'd himself when Daphne he ador'd  That arts relieving all should sail their lord  HYLAS  But say from whence in thee this knowledge springs  Of what his favour was with Gods and Kings  MELIBOEUS  Dorus who long had known books men and towns  At last the honour of our woods and downs  Had often heard his songs was often fir'd  With their inchanting power ere he retir'd  And ere himself to our still groves he brought  To meditate on what his Muse had taught  Here all his joy was to revolve alone  All that her music to his soul had shewn  Or 'n all meetings to divert the stream  Of our discourse and make his friend his theme  And praising works which that rare loom hath weav'd  Impart that pleasure which he had receiv'd  So in sweet notes which did all tunes excel  But what he prais'd I oft have heard him  ell  Of his  are pen what was the use and price  The bays of virtue and the scourge of vice  How the rich ignorant he valued least  Nor for the trappings would esteem the beast  But did our youth to noble actions raise  Hoping the meed of his immortal praise  How bright and soon his Muse's morning shone  Her noon how lasting and her evening none  How speech exceeds not dumbness nor verse prose  More than his verse the low rough rhimes of those  For such his seen they seem'd who highest rear'd  Possest Parnassus ere his power appear'd  Nor shall another pen his fame dissolve  Till we this doubtful problem can resolve  Which in his works we most transcendent see  Wit judgement learning art or industry  Which  till  is never so all jointly flow  And each doth to an equal torrent grow  His learning such no author old or new  Escap'd his reading that deserv'd his view  And such his judgement so exact his taste  Of what was best in books as what books best  That had he join'd those notes his labours took  From each most prais'd and praisedeserving book  And could the world of that choice treasure boast  It need not care though all the rest were lost  And such his wit he writ past what he quotes  And his productions far exceed his notes  So in his works where aught inserted grows  The noblest of the plants ingrafted shows  That his adopted children equal not  The generous issue his own brain begot  So great his art that much which he did write  Gave the wise wonder and the croud delight  Each sort as well as sex admir'd his wit  The hees and shees the boxes and the pit  And who less lik'd within did rather chuse  To tax their judgements than suspect his Muse  How no spectato  his chaste stage could call  The cause of any crime of his but all  With thoughts and wills purg'd and amended rise  From th' ethic lectures of his comedies  Where the spectators act and the sham'd age  Blusheth to meet her follies on the stage  Where each man finds some light he never sought  And leaves behind some vanity he brought  Whose politicks no less the minds direct  Than these the manners nor with less effect  When his majestic tragedies relate  All the disorders of a tottering state  All the distempers which on kingdoms fall  When ease and wealth and vice are general  And yet the minds against all fear assure  And telling the disease prescribe the cure  Where as he tells what subtle ways what friends  Seeking their wicked and their wish'dfor ends  Ambitious and luxurious persons prove  Whom vast desires or mighty wants do move  The general frame to sap and undermine  In proud Sejanus and bold Catiline  So in his vigilant prince and consuls parts  He shews the wiser and the nobler arts  By which a state may be unhurt upheld  And all those works destroy'd which hell would build  Who not like those who with small praise had writ  Had they not call'din judgement to their wit  Us'd not a tutoring hand his to direct  But was sole workman and sole architect  And sure by what my friend did daily tell  If he but acted his own part as well  As he writ those of others he may boast  The happy fields hold not a happier ghost  HYLAS  Strangers will think this strange yet he dear youth  Where most he past belief fell short of truth  Say on what more he said this gives relief  And though it raise my cause it 'bates my grief  Since fates decreed him now no longer liv'd  I joy to hear him by thy friend reviv'd  MELIBOEUS  More he would say and better but I spoil  His smoother words with my unpolish'd style  And having told what pitch his worth attain'd  He then would tell us what reward it gain'd  How in an ignorant and learn'd age he sway'd  Of which the first he found the second made  How he when he could know it reap'd his fame  And long outliv'd the envy of his name  To him how daily flock'd what reverence gave  All that had wit or would be thought to have  Or hope to gain and in so large a store  That to his ashes they can pay no more  Except those few who censuring thought not so  But aim'd at glory from so great a foe  How the wise too did with mere wits agree  As Pembroke Portland and grave Aubigny  Nor thought the rigid'st senator a shame  To contribute to so deserv'd a fame  How great Eliza the retreat of those  Who weak and injur'd her protection chose  Her subjects joy the strength of her allies  The fear and wonder of her enemies  With her judicious favours did infuse  Courage and strength into his younger Muse  How learned James whose praise no end shall find  But still enjoy a fame pure like his mind  Who favour'd quiet and the arts of peace  Which in his halcyon days found large increase  Friend to the humblest if deserving swain  Who was himself a part of Phoebus' train  Declar'd great Jonson worthiest to receive  The garland which the Muses' hands did weave  And though his bounty did sustain his days  Gave a more welcome pension in his praise  How mighty Charles amidst that weighty care  In which three kingdoms as their blessing share  Whom as it tends with everwatchful eyes  That neither power may force nor art surprize  So bounded by no shore grasps all the main  And far as Neptune claims extends his reign  Found still some time to hear and to admire  The happy sounds of his harmonious lyre  And oft has left his bright exalted throne  And to his Muses' feet  King Charles and his Queen condescended to take a part in some of Jonson's Masques as Queen Elizabeth and the Queen of James had done before them N  combin'd his own  As did his queen whose person so disclos'd  A brighter nymph than any part impos'd  When she did join by an harmonious choice  Her graceful motions to his powerful voice  How above all the rest was Phoebus fi  'd  With love of a  ts which he himself inspir'd  Nor oftener by his light our sense was cheer'd  Than he in person to his sight appear'd  Nor did he write a line but to supply  With sacred flame the  adiant God was by  HYLAS  Though none I eve heard this last rehearse  I saw as much when I did see his verse  MELIBOEUS  Since he when living could such honours have  What now will piety pay to his grave  Shall of the rich whose lives were low and vile  And scarce deserv'd a grave much less a pile  The monuments possess an ample room  And such a wonder lie without a tomb  Raise thou him one in verse and there relate  His worth thy grief and our deplored state  His great perfections our great loss recite  And let them merely weep who cannot write  HYLAS  I like thy saying but oppose thy choice  So great the task as this requires a voice  Which must be heard and list'ned to by all  And fame's own trumpet but appears too small  Then for my slender reed to sound his name  Would more my folly than his praise proclaim  And when you wish my weakness sing his worth  You charge a mouse to bring a mountain forth  I am by Nature form'd by woes made dull  My head is emptier than my heart is full  Grief doth my brain impair as tears supply  Which makes my face so moist my pen so dry  Nor should this work proceed from woods and downs  But from the academi  s courts and towns  Let Digby Carew Killigrew and Mayne  Godolphin Waller that inspired  Waller and Mayne

whose rare pen beside deserves the grace  Or of an equal or a neighbouring place  Answer thy wish for none so fit appears  To raise his tomb as who are left his heirs  Yet for this cause no labour

ancient Druids and young virgins right  Emplo  ing feeble limbs to the best use  So Jonson dead no pen should plead excuse  For elegies howl all who cannot sing  For tombs bring t  who cannot marble bring  Let all their forces mix join verse to rhyme  To save his fame from that invader Time  Whose power though his alone may well restrain  Yet to so wish'd an end no care is vain  And Time like

To that great deluge which so far destroy'd  The earth her springs as heaven his showers employ'd  So may who highest marks of honour wears  Admit mean partners in this flood of tears  So oft the humblest join with loftiest things  Nor only princes weep the fare of  ings  HYLAS  I yield I yield thy words my thoughts have fir'd  And I am less persuaded than inspir'd  Speech shall give sorrow

I shall find and no  produce  And as it fares in crouds I only doubt  So much would pass that nothing will get out  Els  in this work which now my thoughts intend  I shall find nothing hard but how to end  I then but ask fit time to smooth my lays  And imitate in this the pen I praise  Which by the subject's power embalm'd may last  Whilst the sun light the earth doth shadows cast  And feather'd by

celebrated poet N    IF Romulus did promise in the fight  To Jove the Stator if he held from flight  His man a Temple and perform'd his vow  Why should not we learn'd Jonson thee allow  An Altar at

Westminster elected student of Christ Church in He was made chaplain to James I archdeacon of Colchester residentiary of St Paul's and canon of Christ Church DD in chaplain to Charles I dean of Rochester in and in when episcopacy was sinking was advanced to the bishoprick of Chester "it being conceived" says Jacob  "the most effectual method for the restitution of that order to prefer persons not only of unblam  able lives and eminent for their learning but also such a were generally beloved by all disinterested people The king's choice amongst these was very happy in this great Divine who lived a most religious life and did not die till after his order was restored"  His death happened October after having published a new metrical translation of the Psalms mo "Poems Elegies Paradoxes Sonnets " vo "Divers Latin and Greek Poems" some Sermons and religious treatises N    I SEE that wreath which doth the wearer arm  'Gainst the quick strokes of thunder is no charm  To keep off Death's pale dart for Jonson then  Thou hadst been number'd still with living men  Time's scythe had fear'd thy laurel to invade  Nor thee this subject of our sorrow made  Amongst those many votaries that come  To offer up their garlands at thy tomb  Whilst some more lofty pens in their bright verse  Like glorious tapers flaming on thy hearse  Shall light the dull and thankless world to see  How great a maim it suffers wanting thee  Let not thy learned shadow scorn that I  Pay meaner rites unto thy memory  And since I nought can add but in desire  Restore some sparks which leapt from thine own fire  What ends soever other quills invite  I can protest it was no itch to write  Nor any vain ambition to be read  But merely love and justice to the dead  Which rais'd my fameless Muse and caus'd her bring  These drops as tribute thrown into that spring  To whose most rich and fruitful head we owe  The purest streams of language which can flow  For 'tis but truth thou taught'st the ruder age  To speak by grammar and reform'dst the stage  Thy comic sock induc'd such purged sense  A Lucrece might have heard without offence  Amongst these soaring wits that did dilate  Our English

what tongue ever durst but ours translate  Great Tully's eloquence or Homer's state  Both which in their unblemish'd lustre shine  From  A specimen of Chapman shall be given hereafter N  Chapman's pen and from thy Catiline  All I would ask for thee in recompence  Of thy successful toil and time's expence  Is only this poor boon that those who can  Perhaps read French or talk Italian  Or do the lofty Spaniard affect  To shew their skill in foreign dialect  Prove not themselves so unnaturally wise  They therefore should their mothertongue despise  As if her poets both for style and wit  Not equal'd or not pass'd their best that writ  Until by studying Jonson they have known  The height and strength and plenty of their own  Thus in what low earth or neglected room  So e'er thou sleep'st thy book shall be thy tomb  Thou wilt go down a happy corse bestrew'd  With thine own flowers and feel thyself renew'd  Whilst thy immortal neverwithering bays  Shall yearly flourish in thy reader's praise  And when more spreading titles are forgot  Or spite of all their lead and searcloth rot  Thou wrapt and shrin'd in thine own sheets wilt lie  A relick fam'd by all posterity  TO THE MEMORY OF BEN JONSON  BY JASPER MAYNE  Born at Hatherlagh in D  onshire elected from Westminsterschool to Christ Church Oxford as a servitor in and in the next year was chosen a student He took the degrees of B and MA and was presented by the College to the livings of Cassington and Pyrton in Oxfordshire In the civil wars he preached before the king at Oxford and was made DD but was soon after ejected from his livings by Cromwell's visitors He found an asylum with the Earl of Devonshire and at the Restoration obtained his livings again was made canon of Christ Church archdeacon of Chichester and chaplain to Charles II He died December and is called by Wood  "a quaint preacher and a noted poet"  Five only of his sermons are in print and his poems are not numerous He published two plays a poem on the Naval Victory over the Dutch by the Duke of York translated some of Lucian's Dialogues and Donne's Latin Epigrams which he called "A Sheaf of Miscellany Epigrams" Though very orthodox in his opinions and severe in his manners he was a facetious companion and his propensity to mirth attended him in his last moments for to a servant who had lived long with him he  "bequeathed a trunk with something in it to make him drink"  which being opened by the expecting servant he found the legacy to be nothing but a red herring N    AS when the vestal hearth went out no fire  Less holy than the flame that did expire  Could kindle it again so at thy fall  Our wit great Ben is too apocryphal  To celebrate the loss since 'tis too much  To write thy epitaph and not be such  What thou wert like th' hard oracles of old  Without an extasy cannot be told  We must be ravish'd first thou must infuse  Thyself into us both the theme and Muse  Else though we all conspir'd to make thy hearse  Our works so that 't had been but one great verse  Though the priest had translated for that time  The Liturgy and bury'd thee in rhyme  So that in metre we had heard it said  Poetic dust is to poetic laid  And though that dust being Shakespeare's thou might'st have  Not his room but the poet for thy grave  So that as thou didst prince of numbers die  And live so now thou might'st in numbers lie  'T were frail solemnity verses on thee  And not like thine would but kind libels be  And we not speaking thy whole worth should raise  Worse blots than they that envied thy praise  Indeed thou need'st us not since above all  Invention thou wert thine own funeral  Hereafter when time hath fed on thy tomb  Th' inscription worn out and the marble dumb  So that 't would pose a critic to restore  Half

the king's yearly butt wrote and his wine  Hath more right than thou to thy Catiline  Let such men keep a diet let their wit  Be rack'd and while they write suffer a fit  When they 've felt tortures which outpain the gout  Such as with less the state draws treason out  Though they should the length of consumptions lie  Sick of their verse and of their poem die  'Twould not be thy worst scene but

reigns of Elizabeth and James I stood on much the same level with that of Cowley in the reigns of Charles I and II but it has declined considerably since that period He frequently wants that elevation of thought which is essential to poetry though in some of the stanzas of his "Barons Wars" he is scarce inferior to Spenser In his "England's Heroical Epistles" written in the manner of Ovid he has been in general happier in the choice than the execution of his subjects yet some of his imitations are more in the spirit of a poet than several of the English translations of him His "Nymphidia or Court of Fayrie" seems to have been the greatest effort of his imagination and is the most generally admired of his works His character among his friends was that of a modest and amiable man"  GRANGERDrayton who on his monument in Westminster Abbey is styled  "a memorable poet of his age"  was born at Atherston in Warwickshire in and is said on his epitaph to have  "exchanged his laurel for a crown of glory "  His "Nymphidia" shall be printed in a future volume N  ESQ  FORTUNE as blinde as he whom she doth lead  Her feature chaung'd each minute of the houre  Her riggish feete fantastically would tread  Now would she smile and suddenly would lowre  And with one breath her words are sweete and sowre  Upon her foes she amorously doth glaunce  And on her followers coyly looke askaunce  About her necke it seem'd as for a chaine  Some princes crownes and broken scepters hung  Upon her arme a lazie youth did leane  Which scornfully unto the ground she flung  And with a wanton

best writers of his time who was esteemed and highly recommended by the critical Jonson and the learned Selden was in a few years after his death almost forgotten To the  o small credit of Mr T Davies his writings were for the first time completely collected in in three neat volumes of a size which makes them a proper companion for the "English Poets" and consequently renders it unnecessary to print here any more than a specimen of his poetry But a few particulars of his life shall be given in the words of Mr Davies  "William Browne descended of a good family was born at Tavistock in Devonshire in the year his father according to Prince in his "Worthies of Devon" being probably of the knightly family of Browne of Browne'sIlash in the parish of Langtree near GreatTorrington After he had passed through the Grammarschool he was sent to Exeter College in the University of Oxford about the beginning of the reign of king James the First where he became a great proficient in classical learning and in the Belles Lettres was scarcely equalled from hence however before he had taken any academical degree he removed to the InnerTemple London where he more particularly devoted himself to the Muses In the beginning of the year he returned again to Exeter College and became tutor to Robert Dormer who was afterwards earl of Carnarvon and who lost his life at Newbury Fight on the th of September On the th of March our author received permission to be actually created a Master of Arts although the degree was not conferred upon him till the November following He is styled in the public register of the University a man well skilled in all kinds of polite literature and useful arts  vir omni humanâ literaturâ et bonarum artium cognitione instructus  After he had left College with his pupil he was gladly received into the family of William earl of Pembroke who had a great respect for him and here according to the author of the Athenae Oxonienses he made his fortune so well that he purchased an estate he also adds that he had a great mind in a little body but with regard to the time of his death he is very doubtful for all that he says of the matter is that in his searches he finds that one William Browne of Ottery St Mary in Devonshire died in the year but that he cannot tell whether he was the same with our poet"  To this account I shall only add that Mr Warburton the herald appears to have been possessed of some MS poems by this author which were sold with the rest of his library about the year or I cannot but wish that Mr Davies had met with sufficient encouragement to have proceeded with the work he announced at the conclusion of his preface under the title of "England's Helicon" He published however in the same size the whole works of Suckling in the poems of Marvell and Carew in and those of Sir John Davies in A small portion therefore of each of these writers will be sufficient for this collection N    ON a hill that grac'd the plaine  Thyrsis sate a comely swaine  Comelier swaine ne'er grac'd a hill  Whilst his flocke that wandred nie  Cropt the green grasse busilie  Thus he tun'd his oaten quill  Ver hath made the pleasant field  Many several odours yeeld  Odors aromatical  From faire Astra's cherrie lip  Sweeter smells for ever skip  They in pleasing passen all  Leavie groves now mainely ring  With each sweet bird's sonneting  Notes that make the ecchos long  But when Astra tunes her voice  All the mirthful birds rejoice  And are listening to her song  Fairely spreads the damaske rose  Whose rare mixture doth disclose  Beauties pencills cannot faine  Yet if Astra passe the bush  Roses have been seen to blush  She doth all their beauties staine  Phoebus shining bright in skie  Gilds the floods heates mountaines hie  With his beames all quick'ning fire  Astra's eyes most sparkling ones  Strikes a heat in hearts of stones  And enflames them with desire  Fields are blest with slowrie wreath  Ayre is blest when she doth breath  Birds make happy ev'ry grove  She each bird when she doth sing  Phoebus' heate to Earth doth bring  She makes marble fall in love  Those blessinges of the Earth we swaines do call  Astra can blesse those blessings Earth and all  TO MICHAEL DRAYTON ESQ  BY MR JOHN SELDEN  This famous antiquary descended from a good family was born at Salvington in Sussex December educated at Chichester freeschool and admitted of HartHall Oxon in removed to Clifford's Inn in to study the law admitted of the Inner Temple in May He soon commenced writer and published a considerable number of valuable works which it is needless here to enumerate In he published notes and illustrations on the first eighteen songs in  "his worthy friend Michael Drayton's"  PolyOlbion and the year after wrote verses in Greek Latin and English upon Browne's "Britannia's Pastorals" which with divers poems prefixed to the works of other authors occasioned Sir John Suckling to give him a place in his "Session of the Poets" Mr Selden when not above three and thirty years of age had shewn himself a great philologist ant'quary herald and linguist and his name was so wonderfully advanced not only at home but in foreign countries that he was actually then what he was afterwards usually styled the great dictator of learning to the English nation In when he was in his thirtyfourth year he published his "History of Tithes" which alarming the clergy and offending king James I it was suppressed and the author forced to make public submission He again offended that monarch in by an opinion he gave against the crown as counsel in the house of lords and was committed into the custody of the sheriff of London but was released in five weeks by the favour of the lord keeper Williams He was chosen member for Lancaster that year but neglected all public business to apply himself to study In he was appointed by the Inner Temple reader at Lyon's Inn but refused to accept that office In he was chosen burgess for Great Bedwin Wiltshire and again in when he was an active manager against the duke of Buckingham In he was counsel for Mr Hampden and in the third parliament of king James was again elected for Lancaster and had a considerable hand in the Petition of Rights After the prorogation in June retiring to Wrest in Bedfordshire he finished his Commentaries on the Arundelian Marbles In the next session he warmly opposed the court and was committed to the Tower and had his s  dy sealed up March He was closely confined three months but magnificently supported at the king's expence and being afterwards allowed the use of such books as he desired he proceeded in his studies In Hilary Term declining to give security for his good behaviour as unwarrantable by law he was committed to the King's Ben  h prison He was released the latter end of the year though it does not appear how only that the parliament in ordered him £ for the losses he had sustained on that occasion In he was again committed to custody with the earls of Bedford and Clare Sir Robert Cotton and Mr St John being accused of having dispersed a libel intituled "A Proposition for his Majesty's service to bridle the impertinency of Parliaments" but it was proved that Sir Robert Dudley their living in the duke of Tuscany's dominions was the author All these various imprisonments and tumults gave no interruption to his studies but he proceeded in his old way to write and publish books In he was chosen member of parliament for the University of Oxford and though he was against the court yet in the king had thoughts of taking the seal from the lord keeper Littleton and giving it to him In he was appointed one of the laymembers to sit in the assembly of divines at Westminster in which he frequently perplexed those divines with his vast learning About this time he took the covenant and the same year was by the parliament appointed keeper of the records in the Tower In he was elected one of the twelve commissioners of the Admiralty and the same year was nominated to the mastership of Trinity College in Cambridge which he did not think proper to accept In the beginning of his health began to decline and he died the th of November that year at the Friary House in WhiteFriars where he had resided for some years being possessed of it in the right of Elizabeth counte  s dowager of Kent who had appointed him executor of her will having before from the first of her widowhood committed the management of her affairs to him He was

study of divinity in which he made a very considerable progress But when he saw that some churches were defaced or demolished and others converted into barracks and stables and that a learned ministry was held in the utmost contempt he changed the course of his studies and applied himself to physic He took a doctor's degree in that faculty in which he rose to such eminence that he was in the time of the Usurpation appointed physician to the state Upon the Restoration he quitted his profession of physic was elected a fell  w of the Royal Society and president of his college and having entered into holy orders he was made chaplain to the king and installed dean of Wells June His learning and talents were various he was the orator and the poet the philosopher and the divine He possessed an inexhaustible fund of writ and was the facetious companion at eighty years of age Ridicule was the weapon that he made use of to correct the deliquents of his college and he was so absolute a master of it that he had it always at hand His poetical pieces in the "Musae Anglicanae" are excellent in their kind they are much in the spirit of Ovid who was his favourite poet His "Diatribae Theologicae" in manuscript which he began at twentythree years of age are much commended by Mr Warton He died greatly lamented by all that knew his worth and particularly by the society over which he presided the th of June in the th year of his age"  GRANGERHis Life has been elegantly written by Mr Warton N    SO fell the sacred Sibyl when of old  Inspir'd with more than mortal breast could hold  The gazing

Hitchinghill in the county of Hertford some time in the year After being well grounded in schoollearning he was sent to the University but whether to Oxford or Cambridge was unknown to Anthony Wood who declares himself certain he resided some time at the former where he was observed to be most excellent in the Latin and Greek tongues but not in Logic or Philosophy which may be presumed to be the reason he took no degree there He appears to have been a man of a very respectable character being countenanced and patronized by several eminent persons particularly Sir Thomas Walsyngham and his son and by Prince Henry son of James the First Wood imagines that he was a sworn servant either to James the First or his Queen and says he was highly valued but not so much as Ben Jonson The same writer adds that  "he was a person of most reverend aspect religious and temperate qualities rarely meeting in a poet"  After living to the age of years he died on the th day of May in the parish of St Giles in the Fields and was buried on the Southside of the Churchyard there His friend Inigo Jones erected a monument to his memory near the place of his interment His translation of Homer acquired him a considerable degree of reputation Mr Dryden tells us that Waller used to say he never could read it without incredible transport It is much censured by Mr Pope who notwithstanding acknowledges that there is a daring fiery spirit which animates it something like what one might imagine Homer himself would have writ before he arrived at years of discretion He translated also the Batrachomyomachia and all the Hymns of Homer to which he annexed the verses here printed finished Marlow's Translation of Musaeus produced several original Poems and some other Translations was the author of seventeen dramatick performances and assisted Shirley in two others For this note I am indebted to the new edition of Dodsley's Old Plays vol IV p where the reader will find some other curious particulars of Chapman and an exact list of his dramatick writings  Of the Batrachomyomachia and Hymns I have the copy presented to Lord Russel with the following MS dedication  "For the many noble favors receiv'd of the righte honorable the Lord RUSSELL and desirouse by all best services to crowne his Lordship's free graces with contin  wance GEORGE CHAPMAN humblie inscribes this crowne of all the Homericall Graces and Muses to his Lordship's Honor wishing the same crownde above title and establishte past marble"  N    ANNEXED TO HIS BATRACHOMYOMACHIA  THE Worke that I was borne to doe is done  Glory to him that the conclusion  Makes the beginning of my life and never  Let me be said to live till I live ever  Where's the outliving of my fortunes then  Ye errant vapors of Fames Lernean fenn  That like possest stormes blast all not in herde  With your abhorr'd heads who because casher'de  By men for monsters thinck men monsters all  That are not of your pyed hood and your hall  When you are nothing but the scumm of things  And must be cast off drones that have no stings  Nor any more soule then a stone hath wings  Avant ye haggs your hates and scandalls are  The crownes and comforts of a good mans care  By whose impartial perpendiculare  All is extuberance and excretion all  That you your ornaments and glories call  Your wrie mouthes censure right your blister'd tongues  That licke but itches and whose ulcerous lungs  Come up at all things permanent and sound  O you like flies in dreggs in humors droun'd  Your loves like atoms lost in gloomie ayre  I would not retrive with a wither'd haire  Hate and cast still your stings then for your kisses  Betray but truth and your applauds are hisses  To see our supercilious wizerds frowne  Their faces falne like foggs and coming downe  Stincking the sunn out make me shine the more  And like a checkt flood beare above the shore  That their prophane opinions faine would set  To what they see not know not nor can let  Yet then our learn'd men with their torrents come  Roring from their forc't hills all crown'd with some  That one not taught like them should learne to know  Their Greeke rootes and from thence the groves that grow  Casting such rich shades from great Homers wings  That first and last command the Muses springs  Though he 's best scholler that through paines and vows  Made his own master onely all things knows  Nor pleades my poore skill forme or learned place  But dantlesse labor constant prayer and grace  And what 's all their skill but vast varied reading  As if brodebeaten high waies had the leading  To truths abstract and narrow path and pit  Found in no walke of any worldly wit  And without truth all 's onely sleight of hand  Or our lawlearning in a forraine land  Embroderie spent on cobwebs braggart show  Of men that all things learne and nothing know  For Ostentation humble Truth still flies  And all confederate fashionists defies  And as some sharpebrowd doctor Englishborne  In much learn'd Latine idioms can adorne  A verse with rare attractions yet become  His English Muse like an Arachnean loome  Wrought spight of Pallas and therein bewraies  More tongue then truth beggs and adopts his bayes  So Ostentation bee hee never so  Larded with labour to suborne his showe  Shall soothe within him but a bastard soule  No more Heaven he  ring then Earths sonne the moule  But as in dead calmes emptiest smokes arise  Uncheckt and free up strait into the skies  So drousie Peace that in her humor steepes  All she affects lets such rise while she sleepes  Many and most men have of wealth least store  But none the gracious shame that fits the pore  So most learn'd men enough are ignorant  But few the grace have to confesse their want  Till lives and learnings come concomitant  For from mens knowledges their livesacts flowe  Vaineglorious acts then vaine prove all they know  As Night the lifeenclining starrs best showes  So lives obscure the starriest soules disclose  For me let just men judge by what I show  In acts expos'd how much I erre or knowe  And let not Envie make all worse then nought  With her meere headstrong and quite braineles thought  Others for doing nothing giving all  And bounding all worth in her bursten gall  God and my deare Redeemer rescue me  From mens immane and mad impietie  And by my life and soule sole knowne to them  Make me of palme

Queen's College Oxford in Michaelmas term When he had taken the degree of BA he removed to the Middle Temple and was called to the bar Being expelled thence on account of a quarrel he returned to Oxford He was afterwards reinstated in the Temple practised as a barrister and was chosen a burgess in the parliament held at Westminster in Upon the death of Queen Elizabeth our author went with Lord Hunsdon into Scotland to congratulate King James That prince was learned himself and a great encourager of learned men when Hunsdon and his retinue were admitted into the  ing's presence his majesty enquired the names of the gentlemen who accompanied him his lordship naming among the rest John Davies the king presently asked whether he was Nosce Teiptum which was the title of his poem on the I  mortality of the Soul and being answered that he was he graciously embraced him and assured him of his favour The king presently after promoted him to the office of solicitor and then attorneygeneral in Ireland where in he was made serjeant at law and afterwards speaker of the house of commons in that kingdom the year following he received the order of knighthood from the king at Whitehall In the year he published a very valuable book called "A Discovery of the true Causes why Ireland was never entirely subdued nor brought under obedience of the Crown of England until the beginning of his Majesty's happy Reign" reprinted in mo Sir John in quitted Ireland and was made one of his majesty's English serjeants at law After his settling in England he was often appointed one of the judges of assize in the circuits He married Eleanor Tonchet youngest daughter of George Lord Audley by whom he had a son an ideot who died young and a daughter named Lucy married to Ferdinand Lord Hastings afterwards Earl of Huntingdon In Sir John was appointed Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench but before the ceremony of his installation could be performed he died suddenly of an apoplexy the th of December at his house in the Strand in the th year of his age Sir John Davies besides his Poems and his Account of the reduction of Ireland beforementioned published reports and other books relating to the constitution and laws of this kingdom Anthony Wood says there were several of his manuscripts on various subjects which were formerly in the library of Sir James Ware and since that in the possession of Edward Earl of Clarendon besides these which were chiefly of the political kind the same author says there were also some epigrams written by Sir John and a metaphrase of several of King David's Psalms but never published The poem on the Soul which he called Nosce Teipsum was first published in and afterwards in with Hymns to Astrea in acrostic verse and Orchestra a poem expressing the antiquity and excellence of dancing in a dialogue between Penelope and one of her wooers containing one hundred and thirtyone stanzas unfinished See the Life prefixed by Mr Davies to the complete edition of his poems N    O  Ignorant  poor man what dost thou bear  Lock'd up within the casket of thy breast  What jewels and what riches hast thou there  What heavenly treasure in so weak a chest  Look in thy  Soul  and thou shalt  beauties  find  Like those which drown'd Narcissus in the flood  Honour  and  pleasure  both are in thy mind  And all that in the world is counted  good    Think of her worth and think that God did mean  This worthy mind should worthy things embrace  Blot not her beauties with thy thoughts unclean  Nor her dishonour with thy passion base  Kill not her  quickening power  with surfeitings  Mar not her  sense  with sensuality  Cast not her wit on idle things  Make not her  freewill  slave to vanity  And when thou think'st of her  eternity    Think not that  death  against her nature is  Think it a  birth  and when thou go'st to die  Sing like a swan as if thou went'st to bliss  And if thou like a child didst fear before  Being in the dark where thou didst nothing see  Now I have brought thee  torchlight  fear no more  Now when thou dy'st thou canst not hoodwink'd be  And thou my  Soul  which turn'st with curious eye  To view the beams of thine own form divine  Know that thou canst know nothing perfectly  While thou art clouded with this flesh of mine  Take heed of  overweening  and compare  Thy  peacock  's feet with thy gay  peacock's  train  Study the best and highest things that are  But of thyself an humble thought retain  Cast down thyself and only strive to raise  The glory of thy Maker's sacred name  Use all thy powers that blessed Power to praise  Which gives thee power to  be  and  use the same    DETRACTION EXECRATED  BY SIR JOHN SUCKLING  A poet of great vivacity and some elegance and one of the finest gentlemen of his time He was son to Sir John Suckling comptroller of the houshold to king Charles the First and was born at Witham in Essex in He spoke Latin at five years of age and wrote it when nine He had a general knowledge of polite literature but applied himself more particularly to music and poetry In the course of his foreign travels he made a campaign under Gustavus Adolphus and at his return raised a splendid troop of horse at the expence of twelve thousand pounds for the service of the king This troop with Sir John at its head behaved so ill in the engagement with the Scots upon the English borders in as to occasion the famous lampoon by Sir John Mennis "Sir John he got him an ambling nag" c which was set to an Irish tune and much sung by the Parliamentarians This disastrous exped  tion and the ridicule that attended it was supposed to have hastened his death which happened in at the age of twentyeight His prose writings particularly his "Discourse of Religion" addressed to lord Dorset are thought equal to the best of his poetical performances His ballad on a wedding and his "Session of the Poets" are oftener remembered than any of his works This ballad was occasioned by the marriage of Roger Boyle the first earl of Orrery with lady Margaret Howard daughter of the earl of Suffolk There was a great intimacy betwixt Sir John and the earl of Orrery then lord Broghill In his "Session of the Poets" he has given us some traits of the characters of his poetical brethren This article is principally compiled from Jacob and Granger The whole of Sir John Suckling's Works containing his "Poems Letters and Plays" were published several times by Mr Tonson and in two neat volumes by Mr Davies N    THOU vermin Slander bred in abject minds  Of thoughts impure by vile tongues animate  Canker of conversation could'st thou find  Nought but our love whereon to shew thy hate  Thou never wert when we two were alone  What canst thou witness then Thy base dull aid  Was useless in our conversation  Where each meant more than could by each be said  Whence hadst thou thy intelligence From earth  That part of us ne'er knew that we did love  Or from the air Our gentle sighs had birth  From such sweet raptures as to joy did move  Our thoughts as pure as the chaste morning's breath  When from the night's cold arms it c  eeps away  Were cloath'd in words and maiden's blush that hath  More purity more innocence than they  Nor from the water could'st thou have this tale  No briny tear has furrow'd her smooth cheek  And I was pleas'd I pray what should he ail  That had her love for what else could he seek  We shorten'd days to moments by love's art  Whilst our two souls in amorous ecstasy  Perceiv'd no passing time as if a part  Our love had been of still eternity  Much less could'st have it from the purer fire  Our heat exhales no vapour from coarse sense  Such as are hopes or fears or fond desire  Our mutual love itself did recompence  Thou hast no correspondence had in heaven  And th' elemental world thou seest is free  Whence hadst thou then this talking monster even  From hell a harbour fit for it and thee  Curst be th' officious tongue that did address  Thee to her ears to ruin my content  May it one minute taste such happiness  Deserving lose unpitied it lament  I must forbear the sight and so repay  In grief those hours joy shorten'd to a dram  Each minute I will lengthen to a day  And in one year outlive Methusalem  SONG  BY THOMAS CAREW  Thomas Carew a poet of real elegance was a younger son of the family of the Carews in Devonshire He was born in and after receiving some part of his education at Corpus Christi College Oxford he spent many years in France and Italy Returning from travel he followed the court which says Lord Clarendon  "the modesty of that time disposed men to do some time before they pretended to be of it and he was very much esteemed by the most eminent persons in the court and well looked upon by the King himself some years before he could obtain to be Sewer to the King and when the King conferred that place upon him it was not without the regret even of the whole Scotch nation which united themselves in recommending another gentleman to it and of so great value were those relations held in that age when majesty was beheld with the reverence it ought to be"  Wood the celebrated Oxford Biographer says that  "he was adored by the poets of his time"  Which seems to be true as we well know that his admirers were the first men of the age that Montague the Lord Abbot of Pontois caressed him that Donne D' Avenant and May loved him Suckling too admired him and yet in his Session of the Poets says  " Tom Carew came next but he had a fault  " That would not well stand with a Laureat  " His Muse was hidebound and the issue of 's brain  " Was seldom brought forth but with trouble and pain"  Suckling knew otherwise but we must remember that the poet when he wrote this was writing a satire The elegance of his lovesonnets made them familiar to his Majesty and his nobles they were sought after read and rehearsed and by his Majesty's command were set to music or as Wood expresses it wedded to the charming notes of Mr Henry Lawes who was gentleman of the King's chapel and at that time the greatest musical composer in England Lord Clarendon says  "Carew was a person of a pleasant and facetious wit and made many poems especially in the amorous way which for the sharpness of the fancy and the elegance of the language in which that fancy was spread were at least equal if not superior to any of that time but his glory was that after fifty years of his life had been spent with less severity or exactness than it ought to have been he died with the greatest remorse for that license and with the greatest manifestation of Christianity that his best friends could desire"  He died in the year I have already mentioned that his poems were published in by Mr Davies N  ESQ  ASK me no more where Jove bestows  When June is past the fading rose  For in your beauty's orient deep  These flowers as in their causes sleep  Ask me no more whither do stray  The golden atomes of the day  For in pure love Heaven did prepare  Those powders to enrich your hair  Ask me no more whither doth haste  The nightingale when May is past  For in your sweet dividing throat  She winters and keeps warm her note  Ask me no more where those stars light  That downwards fall in dead of night  For in your eyes they sit and there  Fixed become as in their sphere  Ask me no more if East or West  The Phoenix builds her spicy nest  For unto you at last she flies  And in your fragrant bosom dies  THE PRIMROSE  BY THE SAME  ASK me why I send you here  This firstling of the infant year  Ask me why I send to you  This primrose all bepearl'd with dew  I strait will whisper in your ears  The sweets of Love are wash'd with tears  Ask me why this flower doth show  So yellow green and sickly too  Ask me why the stalk is weak  And bending yet it doth not break  I must tell you these discover  What doubts and fears are in a Lover  CONTENTS OF VOLUME I  ELEGY by the Wife of St Alexias c Page  Sappho to Phaon By Sir Carr
