duty incumbent on those who devote themselves to Poetry to raise if possible the dignity of a declining Art by making it as beneficial to Life and Manners as the limits of Composition and the character of modern Times will allow The ages indeed are past in which the song of the Poet was idolized for its  miraculous effects  yet a Poem intended to promote the cultivation of goodhumour may still perhaps be fortunate enough to prove of some little service to society in general or if this idea may be thought too chimerical and romantic by sober Reason it is at least one of those pleasing and innocent delusions in which a poetical Enthusiast may be safely indulged  The following production owes its existence to an incident in real life very similar to the principal action of the last Canto but in forming the general plan of the work it seemed to me absolutely necessary to introduce both the agency and the abode of SPLEEN notwithstanding the difficulty and the hazard of attempting a subject so happily executed by the masterly pencil of Pope I considered his Cave of Spleen as a most exquisite cabinet picture and to avoid the servility of imitation I determined to sketch the mansion of this gloomy Power on a much wider canvass Happy indeed if the judgment of the Public may enable me to exclaim with the honest vanity of the Painter who compared his own works to the divine productions of Raphael  E son Pittore anch' Io  The celebrated Alessandro Tassoni who is generally considered as the inventor of the modern  Heroicomic Poety was so proud of having extended the limits of his art by a new kind of composition that he not only spoke of it with infinite exultation in one of his private letters but even gave a MS copy of his work to his native city of Modena with an inscription in which he styled it a new species of Poetry invented by himself  A few partial friends have asserted that the present performance has some degree of similar merit but as I apprehend all the novelty it possesses may rather require an apology than entitle its Author to challenge commendation I shall explain how far the conduct of the Poem differs from the most approved models in this mode of writing and slightly mention the poetical effects which such a variation appeared likely to produce  It is well known that the favourite Poems which blend the serious and the comic represent  their principal characters in a satirical point of view It was the intention of Tassoni though prudence made him attempt to conceal it to satirize a particular Italian Nobleman who happened to be the object of his resentment Boileau openly ridicules the French Ecclesiastics in his Lutrin Garth our English Physicians in his Dispensary and the Rape of the Lock itself that most excellent and enchanting Poem which I never contemplate but with new idolatry is denominated  the best Satire extant  by the learned Dr Warton in his very elegant and ingenious but severe Essay on Pope A sentence which seems to be confirmed by the Poet himself in his letter to Mrs Fermor where he says  The character of Belinda as it is now managed resembles you in nothing but in beauty  Though I think that no composition can surpass or perhaps ever equal this most happy effort of Genius as a sportive  Satire I imagined it might be possible to give a new Character to this mixed species of Poetry and to render it by its Object though not in its Execution more noble than the most beautiful and refined Satire can be We have seen it carried to inimitable perfection in the most delicate raillery on Female FoiblesIt remained to be tried if it might not also aspire to delineate the more engaging features of Female Excellence The idea appeared to me worth the experiment for if it succeeded it seemed to promise a double advantage first it would give an air of novelty to the Poem and secondly what I thought of much greater importance it would render it more interesting to the heart On these principles I have endeavoured to paint SERENA as a most lovely engaging and accomplished character yet I hope the colouring is so faithfully copied from  general Nature  that every man who reads the Poem may be  happy enough to know many Fair ones who resemble my Heroine  There is another point in which I have also attempted to give this Poem an air of novelty I mean the manner of connecting the real and the visionary scenes which compose it by shifting these in alternate Cantos I hoped to make familiar Incident and allegorical Picture afford a strong relief to each other and keep the attention of the Reader alive by an appearance particularly diversified I wished indeed but I fear most ineffectually for powers to unite some touches of the sportive wildness of Ariosto and the more serious sublime painting of Dante with some portion of the enchanting elegance the refined imagination and the moral graces of Pope and to do this if possible without violating those rules of propriety which Mr Cambridge has illustrated by example as well as precept in The Scribleriad and in  his sensible Preface to that elegant and learned Poem  I have now very frankly informed my Reader of the  extent  or rather of the  extravagance  of my desire for I will not give it the serious name of  design  They whom an enlightened taste has rendered thoroughly sensible how very difficult it must be to accomplish such an idea will not only be the first to discern but the most ready to pardon those errors into which so hazardous an attempt may perhaps have betrayed me I had thoughts of introducing this performance to the Public by a Dissertation of considerable length on this species of Poetry but I forbear to indulge myself any farther in such preliminary remarks as the anxiety of authors is so apt to produce from the reflection that however ingeniously written they add little or nothing to the success of a good Poem and are  utterly insufficient to prevent that neglect or oblivion which is the inevitable fate of a bad one  In dismissing a work to my Fair Readers which is intended principally for their perusal I shall only recommend it to their attention and bid them farewell in the words of the pleasant and courteous Tassoni  Vaglia il buon voler s' altro non lice  E chi la leggera viva felice  EARTHAM  Jan  THE TRIUMPHS OF TEMPER  CANTO I  THE Mind's soft Guardian who tho' yet unsung  Inspires with harmony the female tongue  And gives improving every tender grace  The smile of angels to a mortal face  Her powers I sing and scenes of mental strife  Which form the maiden for th' accomplish'd wife  Where the sweet victress sees with sparkling eyes  Love her reward and Happiness her prize  Daughters of Beauty who the song inspire  To your enchanting notes attune my lyre  And O if haply your soft hearts may gain  Or use or pleasure from the motley strain  Tho' formal critics with a surly frown  Deny your artless Bard the laurel crown  He still shall triumph if ye deign to spread  Your sweeter myrtle round his honour'd head  In your bright circle young SERENA grew  A lovelier nymph the pencil never drew  For the fond Graces form'd her easy mien  And Heaven's soft azure in her eye was seen  She seem'd a rosebud when it first receives  The genial sun in its expanding leaves  For now she enter'd those important years  When the full bosom swells with hopes and fears  When conscious Nature prompts the secret sigh  And sheds sweet languor o'er the melting eye  When nobler toys the female heart trepan  And Dolls rejected yield their place to Man  Beneath a Father's care SERENA grew  The good Sir Gilbert to his country true  A faithful Whig who zealous for the state  In Freedom's service led the loud debate  Yet every day by transmutation rare  Turn'd to a Tory in his elbow chair  And made his daughter pay howe'er absurd  Passive obedience to his sovereign word  In his domestic sway he borrow'd aid  From prim PENELOPE an ancient maid  His upright sister conscious of her worth  Who valued still her beauty and her birth  Tho' from her birth no envied rank she gain'd  And of her beauty but the ghost remain'd  A restless ghost that with remembrance keen  Proclaim'd incessant what it once had been  Delighted still the steps of youth to haunt  To watch the tender nymph and warm gallant  And with an eye that petrified pursuit  Hang like the dragon o'er th' Hesperian fruit  Tho' strictly guarded by this jealous power  The mild SERENA no restraint could sour  Pure was her bosom as the silver lake  Ere rising winds the ruffled water shake  When the bright pageants of the morning sky  Across th' expansive mirror lightly fly  By vernal gales in gay succession driven  While the clear glass reflects the smile of heaven  In gay content a sportive life she led  The child of Modesty by Virtue bred  Her light companions Innocence and Ease  Her hope was Pleasure and her wish to please  For this to Fashion early rites she paid  For this to Venus secret vows she made  Nor held it sin to cast a private glance  O'er the dear pages of a new romance  Eager in Fiction's touching scenes to find  A field to exercise her youthful mind  The touching scenes new energy imprest  On all the virtues of her feeling breast  Sweet Evelina's fascinating power  Had first beguil'd of sleep her midnight hour  Possest by Sympathy's enchanting sway  She read unconscious of the dawning day  The Modern Anecdote was next convey'd  Beneath her pillow by her faithful maid  The nymph attentive as the brooding dove  Pored o'er the tender scenes of Franzel's love  The sinking taper now grew weak and pale  SERENA sigh'd and dropt th' unfinish'd tale  But as warm clouds in vernal aether roll  The soft ideas floated in her soul  Free from ambitious pride and envious care  To love and to be lov'd was all her prayer  While these fond thoughts her gentle mind possess'd  Soft slumber settled on her snowy breast  Scarce had her radiant eyes began to close  When to her view a friendly vision rose  A fairy Phantom struck her mental sight  Light as the gossamer as aether bright  Array'd like Pallas was the pigmy form  When the sage Goddess stills the martial storm  Her casque was amber richly grac'd above  With down collected from the callow dove  Her burnish'd breastplate of a deeper dye  Was once the armour of a golden fly  A lynx's eye her little aegis shone  By fairy spells converted into stone  And worn of old as elfin poets sing  By Aegypt's lovely queen a favourite ring  Mysterious power was in the magic toy  To turn the frowns of care to smiles of joy  Her tiny lance whose radiance stream'd afar  Was one bright sparkle from the bridal star  A filmy mantle round her figure play'd  Fine as the texture by Arachne laid  O'er some young plant when glittering to the view  With many an orient pearl of morning dew  The Phantom hover'd o'er the conscious Fair  With such a lively smile of tender care  As on her elfin lord Titania cast  When first she found his angry spell was past  Round her rich locks SERENA chanc'd to tie  An ample ribband of caerulean dye  High o'er her forehead rose the graceful bow  Whose arch commanded the sweet scene below  The hovering Spirit view'd the tempting spot  And lightly perch'd on this unbending knot  As the fair flutterer of Psyche's race  Is seen to terminate her airy chace  When pleas'd at length her quivering wings to close  Fondly she settles on the fragrant rose  Now in soft notes more musically clear  Than ever Fairy breath'd in mortal ear  These words the visionary voice convey'd  To the charm'd spirit of the sleeping maid  "Thou darling of my care whose ripen'd worth  Shall spread my empire o'er the smiling earth  Whom Nature blest forbidding modish Art  To cramp thy spirit or contract thy heart  Screen'd from thy thought nor in thy visions felt  Long on thy opening mind I've fondly dwelt  In childhood's sorrows brought thee quick relief  And dry'd thy April showers of infant grief  Taught thee to laugh at the malicious boy  Who broke thy playthings with a barbarous joy  To bear what ills the little Female haunt  The testy Nurse the imperious Governante  And that tyrannic pest the prying maiden Aunt  Now ripening years a nobler scene supply  For life now opens on thy sparkling eye  Thy rising bosom swells with just desire  Rapture to feel and rapture to inspire  Not the vain bliss the transitory joys  That childish Woman feels in radiant toys  The costly Diamond or the lighter Pearl  The massive Nabob or the tinsel Earl  Thy heart demands each meaner aim above  Th' imperishable wealth of sterling love  Thy wish to please by ev'ry softer grace  Of elegance and ease of form and face  By lively fancy and by sense refin'd  The stronger magic of the cultur'd mind  Thy pure ambition and thy virtuous plan  To fix the variable heart of Man  Short is the worship paid at Beauty's shrine  But lasting Love and Happiness are mine  Mine tho' the earth's mistaken blinded race  Despise my influence and my name debase  Nor breathe one vow to that aetherial friend  On whom the colours of their life depend  But to thy innocence I'll now display  The mystic marvels of my secret sway  And tell in this thy fatedeciding hour  My race my name my office and my power  First hear what wonders human forms contain  And learn the texture of the Female brain  By Nature's care in curious order spread  This living net is fram'd of tender thread  Fine as thy hand some favour'd youth to grace  Knits with nice art to form the mimic lace  Within the center of this fretted dome  Her secret tower her heavenconstructed home  Soft Sensibility sweet Beauty's soul  Keeps her coy state and animates the whole  Invisible as Harmony who springs  Wak'd by young Zephyr from Aeolian strings  Her subtle power more delicately fine  Dwells in each thread and lives in every line  Whose quick vibrations without end impart  Pleasure and pain to the responsive heart  As Zephyr's breath the willing chord inspires  Whispering soft music to the trembling wires  So with fond care I regulate unseen  The softer movements of this nice machine  TEMPER my earthly name the nurse of Love  But call'd SOPHROSYNE in realms above  When lovely Woman perfect at her birth  Blest with her early charms the wond'ring earth  Her soul in sweet simplicity array'd  Nor shar'd my guidance nor requir'd my aid  Her tender frame nor confident nor coy  Had every fibre tun'd to gentle joy  No vain caprices swell'd her pouting lip  No gold produc'd a mercenary trip  Soft innocence inspir'd her willing kiss  Her love was nature and her life was bliss  Guide of his reason not his passion's prey  She tamed the savage Man who bless'd her sway  No jarring wishes fill'd the world with woes  But youth was ecstacy and age repose  The Powers of Mischief met in dark Divan  To blast these mighty joys of envied Man  The Fiends at their infernal Leader's call  Fram'd their base wiles in Demogorgon's hall  In the deep center of that dreadful dome  An hellish cauldron boil'd with fiery foam  In this wide urn the circling spirits threw  Ingredients harsh and hideous to the view  While the terrific master of the spell  With adjurations shook the depths of hell  And in dark words unmeet for mortal ear  Bade the dire offspring of his art appear  Forth from the vase with sullen murmurs broke  A towering mass of pestilential smoke  Emerging from this fog of thickest night  A Phantom swells by slow degrees to sight  But ere the view can seize the forming shape  From the mock'd eye its lineaments escape  It seem'd all passions melted into one  Assum'd the face of all and yet was none  Hell stood aghast at its portentous mien  And shuddering Demons call'd the spectre Spleen  Hie thee to earth its mighty master cried  O'er the vex'd globe in heavy vapours ride  Within its center fix thy shadowy throne  With shades thy subjects and that hell thy own  Reign there unseen but let thy strong controul  Be hourly felt in Woman's wayward soul  With darkest poisons from our deep abyss  Taint that pure fountain of terrestrial bliss  Th' enormous Phantom at this potent sound  Roll'd forth obedient from the vast profound  The quaking Fiends recover'd from their dread  And Hell grew lighter as the monster fled  But now round earth the gliding vapours run  Blot the rich aether and eclipse the sun  All Nature sickens and her fairest flower  Enchanting Woman feels the baneful power  As in her soul the clouds of Spleen arise  The sprightly essence of her beauty flies  In youth's gay prime in hours with rapture warm  Love looks astonish'd on her altering form  To pleasing frolics and enchanting wiles  Lifedarting looks and soulsubduing smiles  Dark whims succeed thickcov'ring fancies fret  The sullen passion and the hasty pet  The swelling lip the teardistended eye  The peevish question the perverse reply  The moody humour that like rain and fire  Blends cold disgust with unsubdu'd desire  Flies what it loves and petulantly coy  Feigns proud abhorrence of the proffer'd joy  For Nature's artless aim the wish to please  By genuine modesty and simple ease  Fashion's pert tricks the crowded brain oppress  With all the poor parade of tawdry dress  The sickly bosom pants for noise and shew  For every bauble and for every beau  The voice that Health made harmony disowns  That native charm for Languor's mimic tones  And feigns disease till feeling what it feigns  Its fancied maladies are real pains  Such and a thousand still superior woes  From Spleen's new empire o'er the earth arose  Each simple dictate of the soul forgot  Then first was form'd the mercenary plot  And Beauty practis'd that pernicious art  The art of angling for an old man's heart  Tho' crawling to his bride with tottering knees  His words were dotage and his love disease  From sex to sex this base contagion ran  And Gold grew Beauty in the eyes of Man  Courtship was traffic and the married life  But one loud jangle of incessant strife  The gentle Sprite who on his radiant car  Shines the mild regent of the eveningstar  And joys from thence those genial rays to shed  That lead the bridegroom to the nuptial bed  While earth's new ills his friendly soul absorb  From Cynthia call'd me to his kindred orb  And eager to redress the woes of Man  The brilliant Son of Vesper thus began  "Thou softest Being of the aetherial kind  Be thy benignant cares no more confin'd  To smooth the ruffled plume of Zephyr's wing  To guard from cruel frost the infant spring  To drive gross atoms from the rays of noon  Or chase the halo from the vapourish moon  Thy friendly nature will not now deny  To quit for nobler toils thy native sky  Thou seest how Spleen's infernal vapours roll  Across the sweet serene of Woman's soul  And earth which darkens as her beauties fade  Must grow a second hell without thy aid  Take then thy station fix thy nobler reign  O'er those fine chords that form the Female brain  That us'd ere injur'd by the rust of Spleen  To fill with harmony the human scene  Go lest her touch their tender tones destroy  Teach them to vibrate to thy notes of joy  Go and restore by stilling mental strife  Health to faint Love and happiness to Life"  So spake that friend of Man who lights above  His heavenly lamp of Hymenaeal love  In his just aim my kindred spirit join'd  And flew obedient to the charge assign'd  Hence as the biass sways the unconscious bowl  I long unseen have sway'd the careless soul  Tho' oft I feel my power by Spleen subdu'd  In the shrill Vixen and the sullen Prude  In some fair forms my soft dominion grows  Like fragrance rising from the opening rose  Still I preserve in many a lovely face  That gay goodhumour and that constant grace  Which heavenly Powers united to infold  In perfect Woman's newcreated mould  When Nature in her infant beauty blest  The last and loveliest of her works carest  But of those Nymphs who delicately fair  Draw their soft graces from my forming care  My young SERENA shines her peers above  Pride of my hopes and darling of my love  Hence I to thee such mysteries unfold  As Man's pedantic eye shall ne'er behold  Whose narrow science tho' it proudly boast  To pierce the sky and count the starry host  Sees not the lucid band of airy Powers  Who flutter round him in his secret hours  But if to me thy guardian now display'd  Thy duteous orisons are justly paid  Thou to those realms shalt pass with me thy guide  Where Spleen's pale victims after death reside  Then to that orb in vision shalt thou rise  Unseen by mortal astronomic eyes  Where Ibut first let me thy soul prepare  To meet our secret foe's insidious snare  'Tis my fond purpose in thy form to shew  The sweetest model of my skill below  A Youth I destine to thy dear embrace  Crown'd with each mental charm and manly grace  With whom thy innocence secure from strife  Shall reap the beauteous joys of blameless life  Pleas'd I observe thy little heart begin  To ask what charms the mighty prize may win  But know tho' Elegance herself be seen  To guide thy motion and to form thy mien  Tho' Beauty o'er thy filial cheek diffuse  The soft enchantment of her roseate hues  Not from their favour shall this glory rise  TEMPER shall singly gain the splendid prize  The sudden conquest shall be mine alone  And Love with transport shall my triumph own  Such are my hopes but I with pain relate  What hard conditions are annex'd by Fate  As chemic fires that patient labour blows  Draw the rich perfume from the Persian rose  So must thou form by fiery toils refin'd  The living essence of thy sweeter mind  Dimly I see on Destiny's dull glass  Three dangerous trials 'tis thy doom to pass  And oh if once forgetful of my power  Goodhumour fail thee in the fateful hour  Farewell those joys that wait the happy wife  Farewell the vision of unclouded life  Fain would my love thy secret perils shew  Which Fate allows not even me to know  In Spleen's dark court a thousand agents dwell  Who bind her victims in the wayward spell  Perchance three prime supporters of her sway  The busiest of her Fiends may cross thy way  Stern Contradiction her illfavour'd child  Of fierce demeanor and of spirit wild  Bane of delight and horror of the sex  His plan to puzzle and his pride to vex  Or Scandal filthy hag who blindly limps  Round the wide earth supported by her Imps  Her inky Demons who delight to print  Her base suggestion and her envious hint  Or groundless Jealousy pert changeling born  Of amorous Vanity and angry Scorn  Whose bitter taunts with public insult dare  Basely to wound the unoffending Fair  Proud the sweet joys of Innocence to crush  And spread o'er Beauty's cheek the burning blush  Whether these kindred Fiends or one or all  Shall aim thy airy spirit to enthrall  Are points my fondness tries in vain to reach  But trust my caution and beware of each  Lest to thy lively mind my words may seem  The vain chimera of a common dream  By one unquestionable sign be taught  To prize my presence in thy waking thought  An azure ribband on thy toilet thrown  Shall make the magic of my empire known  On this thy sportive needle tried its powers  And silver spangles form'd the mimic flowers  On these my love shall breathe a secret charm  With this my Caestus thy soft bosom arm  Above it let the decent tucker rise  To hide the mystic band from mortal eyes  When Spleen's dark Powers would teach that breast to swell  This guardian cincture shall those Powers repel  As the touch'd talisman more swift than thought  To save her charge th' Arabian Fairy brought  So shall this zone if justly I'm obey'd  Bring my soft spirit to thy certain aid  In Love's great name observe this high behest  Revere my powerBe gentle and be blest"  Here the kind Sprite her friendly counsel clos'd  And lightly vanish'dStill SERENA doz'd  Still in sweet trance she fondly seem'd to hear  The soft persuasion vibrate in her ear  But waking now far different notes she found  Less pleasing echos in her chamber sound  For now the heralds of the London day  Sing their loud mattins in th' uncrowded way  Th' impatient Milkmaid now with early din  Screams to the rattle of her pail of tin  With Sweep's faint cry and latest of the crew  The deepton'd music of the murmuring Jew  END OF THE FIRST CANTO  CANTO II  YE radiant Nymphs whose opening eyes convey  Warmth to the world and lustre to the day  Think what o'ershadowing clouds may cross your brain  Before those lovely lids shall close again  What funds of Patience twelve long hours may ask  When cold Discretion claims her daily task  Ah think betimes and while your morning care  Sheds foreign odors o'er your fragrant hair  Tinge your soft spirit with that mental sweet  Which may not be exhal'd by Passion's heat  But charm the sense with undecaying power  Thro' every chance of each diurnal hour  O might you all perceive your toilets crown'd  With such cosmetics as SERENA found  For to the warning vision fondly true  Now the quick Fair one to the toilet flew  With keen delight her ravish'd eye survey'd  The mystic ribband on her mirror laid  Bright shone the azure as Aurora's car  And every spangle seem'd a living star  With sportive grace the smiling damsel prest  The guardian cincture to her snowy breast  More lovely far than Juno when she strove  To look most lovely in the eyes of Jove  And willing Venus lent her every power  That sheds enchantment o'er the amorous hour  For spells more potent on this band were thrown  Than Venus boasted in her beauteous zone  Her dazzling Caestus could alone inspire  The sudden impulse of shortliv'd desire  These finer threads with lasting charms are fraught  Here lies the tender but unchanging thought  Silence that wins where eloquence is vain  And Tones that harmonize the mad'ning brain  Soft Sighs that Anger cannot hear and live  And Smiles that tell how truly they forgive  And lively Grace whose gay diffusive light  Puts the black phantoms of the brain to flight  Whose cheering powers thro' every period last  And make the present happy as the past  Such secret charms this richer Zone possest  Whose flowers now sparkling en SERENA's breast  Give tho' unseen those swelling orbs they bind  Smiles to her face and beauty to her mind  For now observant of the Sprite's behest  The Nymph conceals them by her upper vest  Safe lies the spell no mortal may descry  Not keen PENELOPE's allpiercing eye  Who constant as the steps of morn advance  Surveys the household with a searching glance  And entering now with all her usual care  Reviews the chamber of the youthful Fair  Beneath the pillow not compleatly hid  The Novel layShe sawshe seiz'dshe chid  With rage and glee her glaring eyeballs flash  Ah wicked age she cries ah filthy trash  From the first page my just abhorrence springs  For modern anecdotes are monstrous things  Yet will I see what dangerous poisons lurk  To taint thy youth in this licentious work  She said and rudely from the chamber rush'd  Her pallid cheek with expectation flush'd  With ardent hope her eager spirit shook  Vain hope to banquet on a luscious book  So if a Priest of the Arabian sect  In Turkish hands forbidden wine detect  The sacred Mussulman with pious din  Arraigns the culprit and proclaims the sin  Curses with holy zeal th' inflaming juice  But cursing takes it for his secret use  The gay SERENA with unruffled mind  The pleasing Novel thus unread resign'd  The Vision on her soul such virtue left  She only smil'd at the provoking theft  The teazing incident she deem'd a jest  Nor felt the Zone grow tighter on her breast  Now in full charms descends the finish'd Fair  For now the morning banquet claims her care  Already at the board with viands pil'd  Her Sire impatient fits and chides his tardy child  On his imperial lips rude Hunger reigns  And keener Politics usurp his brains  But when her loveinspiring voice he hears  When the soft magic of her smile appears  In that glad moment he at once forgets  His empty stomach and the nation's debts  He bends to Nature's more divine controul  And only feels the Father in his soul  Quick to his hand behold her now present  The Indian liquor of celestial scent  Not with more grace the nectar'd cup is given  By roselip'd Hebe to the Lord of Heaven  While her fair hands a fresh libation pour  Fashion's loud thunder shakes the sounding door  The light SERENA to the window springs  On Curiosity's amusive wings  Her quick eyes sparkle with surprise see  The glories of a golden visàvis  Its glittering tablet gleam'd with mimic pearl  And the rich coronet announc'd an Earl  The good old Knight grew somewhat proud to hear  Of this new visit from the early Peer  SERENA recollects the Vision's truth  And fluttering hopes it is the promis'd Youth  PENELOPE from her high chamber peeps  There her unfinish'd charms she coyly keeps  With sage reserve her modesty abhorr'd  To shew her morning face before a Lord  The Peer alights the wellrang'd vassals bawl  His sounding title thro' the spacious hall  Till in the deep saloon's extremest bound  Th' eartickling words "LORD FILLIGREE" resound  As when great Hector setting war apart  Advanc'd to parley with his spear athwart  The Greeks beheld him with a still delight  And silent reverence stopt the rising fight  With such respect but unchastis'd by fear  Sir GILBERT and the Nymph first meet the Peer  And while his morning compliments commence  The slighted breakfast stands in cold suspence  But far unlike to Hector's ruder grace  His modern stature and his modish face  Nor less he differs from those Barons old  Whose arms are blazon'd on his car of gold  Whose prostrate castle guarded once the lands  Where spruce in motley pride his villa stands  By Taste erected in her trimmest mode  Her mushroom structure and her quaint abode  As the neat Daisy to the Sun's broad flower  As the French Boudoir to the Gothic Tower  Such is the Peer whom Fashion much admires  Compar'd in person to his ancient sires  For their broad shoulder and their brawny calf  Their coarse loud language and their coarser laugh  His finer form more elegantly slim  Displays the fashionable length of limb  With foreign shrugs his country he regards  And her lean tongue with foreign words he lards  While Gallic Graces who correct his style  Forbid his mirth to pass beyond a smile  As the nice workman in the wooden trade  Hides his coarse ground with finest woods o'erlaid  Thus our young Lord with Fashion's phrase refin'd  Fineer'd the mean interior of his mind  And hence in Courtesy's soft lustre seen  His spirit shone as graceful as his mien  The artless Fair on Fashion's kind report  Thought him the mirror of a matchless Court  Much she his dress his language much observes  Whose finer accents prove his feeling nerves  Her fancy now the destin'd Lover spies  But her free heart abjures the quick surmise  Yet as he spoke at every flattering word  The Vision's promise to her thought recurr'd  Far more parental pride contrives to blind  The good Sir GILBERT's moreexperienc'd mind  Who fondly saw and at the prospect smil'd  A future Countess in his favourite child  But what new flutterings shook SERENA's breast  What hopes and fears the modest Nymph opprest  When with a simpering smile and soft regard  The Peer display'd a mirthexpressive card  Where the gay Graces in a sportive band  Shew the sweet art of Cipriani's hand  Where in their train his airy Cupids throng  And laughing drag a comic mask along  "We" cries my Lord with selfsufficient joy  Twirling with lordly airs the grateful toy  "We who possess true science we who give  The world a lesson in the art to live  We for the Fair a splendid Fête design  And pay our homage thus at Beauty's shrine"  He spoke and speaking to the blushing Maid  With modish ease th' inviting card convey'd  Where Mirth announc'd her masque devoted hour  In characters intwin'd with many a flower  The blushing Maid with eyes of quick desire  View'd it and felt her little soul on fire  For of all scenes she had not yet survey'd  Her heart most panted for a Masquerade  But her gay hopes increasing terrors drown  And dread forebodings of her Father's frown  In mute suspence to read his thought she tries  And strongly pleads with her prevailing eyes  Her eyes for doubt enchain'd her modest tongue  While on his sovereign word her pleasure hung  With such a tender and persuasive air  Of soft endearment and of anxious care  Thetis attended from th' almighty Sire  His fateful answer to her fond desire  The good old Knight like the Olympian God  Blest the fair Suppliant with his gracious nod  Her lively spirit the kind signal took  And her glad heart in every fibre shook  The party settled it imports not how  The Peer politely made his parting bow  The Nymph with eyes that sparkled joyous fire  Kiss'd the round cheek of her complying Sire  Then swiftly flew and summon'd to her aid  Th' important counsel of her favourite maid  To vent her joy and as the moments press  To fix that first of points a Fancydress  Quick as the Poet's eyes o'er Nature fly  Piercing the deep or traversing the sky  With such light speed her fond ideas glance  O'er play and poem story and romance  While all the Characters she e'er has read  Flash on her brain and fill her busy head  Now in Diana's form she hopes to meet  A fond Endymion sighing at her feet  Now her proud thought terrestrial pomp assumes  And Dian's crescent yields to Indian plumes  Now in the habit of the Grecian Isles  She hears some Osman suing for her smiles  And sees his soul that blaze of dress outshine  Whose wealth impoverish'd a diamondmine  Now simpler charms her quick attention draw  The rosecrown'd bonnet and the hat of straw  A Villagemaid she seems in neat attire  A faithful Shepherd now her sole desire  Thus as new figures in her fancy throng  "She's every thing by starts and nothing long"  But in the space of one revolving hour  Flies thro' all states of Poverty and Power  All forms on whom her veering mind can pitch  Sultana Gipsy Goddess Nymph and Witch  At length her soul with Shakespear's magic fraught  The wand of Ariel fixt her roving thought  Ariel's light graces all her heart possess  And Jenny's order'd to prepare the dress  It seems already bought with fond applause  An azure tissue and a silver gauze  Too soon alas that garb of heavenly hue  The ready Mercer flashes to her view  Nescia mens hominum fati sortisque futurae  Et servare modum rebus sublata secundis  Turno tempus erit magno cum optaverit emptum  Intactum Pallanta et cum spolia ista diemque  Oderit  AENEID x v seq  Ah blind to Fate how oft the youthful belle  Feels her gay heart at sight of tissue swell  And thinks the fashionable silk must prove  Her robe of triumph and a spell to Love  To thee sweet Maid whose pleasuredarting eyes  Joy in this favourite vest an hour shall rise  When thou shalt hate the silk so fondly sought  And wish thy silverspotted gauze unbought  For busy Spleen thy trial now prepares  Darkly she forms her unsuspected snares  And keen to raise her pleasurekilling storm  Assumes PENELOPE's congenial form  In that prim shape which all the Graces shun  See the sour Fiend to good Sir GILBERT run  Where deeply pondering the Public Debt  Silent he muses o'er a new Gazette  Ent'ring she view'd with eyes of envious spite  The card that spoke the masquedevoted night  Eager she darted on the graceful toy  And fiercely pointing to each naked boy  "Canst thou" she cried in a discordant scream  That rous'd the Politician from his dream  While with her voice the echoing chamber rings  "  c  ILIAD v seq  Say canst thou suffer these flagitious things  "Are these devices to thy daughter brought  "That wake such gross impurity of thought  "In vain are all the prudent words I preach  "The modest maxims that I strive to teach  "By foolish fondness of your sense beguil'd  "You still indulge and spoil the flippant child  "For me whate'er I say is deem'd absurd  "She scorns my sage advicebut mark my word  "If to this ball you let the Hoyden run  "Your power is ended and the Girl undone"  The patriot Knight by interruption vext  In his political pursuits perplext  While he with wrath th' intruding Mischief eyed  Stern to the false PENELOPE replied  "Go teazing Prude cease in my ears to vent  "Thy envious pride and peevish discontent  "To me of prudence canst thou vainly boast  "Of all my household thou hast plagu'd me most  "The joys thou blamest are thy dear delight  "By day the Visit and the Ball by night  "And tho' too old a Lover to trepan  "Thy midnight dream thy morning thought is Man  "Wert thou less closely to my blood allied  "Thou should'st to cure thee of thy canting pride  "Be sent to sigh alone o'er purling brooks  "Scold village maids and croak to croaking rooks"  He spoke indignant the sly Fiend withdrew  Nor inly griev'd for well her force she knew  As Indian females in a jealous hour  Of secret poison try the subtlest power  Which sure tho' slow corrodes th' unconscious prey  And ends its triumph on a distant day  Thus the departing Fury left behind  Her venom latent in Sir GILBERT's mind  The hidden mischief tho' no eye observes  He feels it fretting on his alter'd nerves  But the kind habit of his healthy soul  Still struggled hard against its base controul  Now Spleen's dark vapours in his bosom hid  Prompt him the promis'd pleasure to forbid  Now Love's soft pleadings that dire thought destroy  And save the blossom of his daughter's joy  Her envious Aunt now serves him for a jest  And gay goodhumour reassumes his breast  While Spleen's dark power now sinks and now revives  At length the day th' important day arrives  Which in his breast must end the close debate  And fix the colour of SERENA's sate  Now comes the hour when the convivial Knight  Waits to begin the dinner's chearful rite  His fond heart ever with a Father's pride  Joys to behold his darling at his side  But most the absence of her smile he feels  In the gay season of his social meals  Hence while for her the rich repast attends  His hasty summons to the Nymph he sends  The happy Nymph superior cares induce  To risk his anger by a rash excuse  She craves his pardon but for time distrest  She still is busy on her magic vest  To range her diamonds in a sparkling zone  She begs to snatch her scanty meal alone  The Knight in sullen state begins to dine  Spleen like a Harpy flutters o'er his wine  Invisible she poisons every dish  Tinging with gall his mutton fowl and fish  The more he eats the more perverse he grows  For as his hunger sunk his choler rose  The cloth remov'd he cries with vapours sick  The Pears are mellow and the Port is thick  Tho' nicer fruit Pomona never knew  And his rich wine surpass'd the ruby's hue  A thousand times his dizzy brain revolves  A stern command now doubts and now resolves  To bid the Nymph descend and disarray'd  Quit her dear project of the Masquerade  As oft kind Nature to his heart recurr'd  And Love parental stopt the cruel word  Mean time unconscious of the brooding storm  The Nymph exults in her improving form  Gay is her smile as those the Queen of Love  Darts on the Graces in her court above  While they contrive with loveinspiring cares  New modes of beauty for the robe she wears  At length each duty of the toilet past  The glance of triumph on the mirror cast  Now the light wand our finish'd Ariel arms  Glad Jenny glories in her Lady's charms  And gives full utterance as she smooths her vest  To the sweet bodings of SERENA's breast  O lovely biass of the Female soul  Which trembling points to Pleasure's distant pole  Which with fond trust on flattering Hope relies  O'erleaps each peril that in prospect lies  And springing to the goal anticipates the prize  Such was SERENA's feardiscarding state  Her eye beheld not the dark frowns of Fate  She only saw the combat all forgot  The triumph promis'd as her glorious lot  Now eager to display her light attire  The sprightly Damsel seeks her sullen Sire  His gloomy brow with sportive air she kist  Ah how could Spleen that magic lip resist  That voice whose melting music might assuage  The scorpion Anger's selftormenting rage  For ne'er did Nature to a Sire's embrace  Present a filial form of softer grace  Or Fancy view a shape of lovelier kind  In the bright mirror of her Shakespear's mind  The sulky Fiend in spite of all her art  Had now been banish'd from the Father's heart  But that resolv'd her utmost force to try  She summon'd to her aid her old ally  The fiery Demon tempertroubling Gout  Who sinks the lively and appalls the stout  Who now assisting Spleen's malignant aim  Shoots in quick throbbings through Sir GILBERT's frame  Thus sorely pester'd by a double foe  Galling his giddy brain and burning toe  The testy Knight with stern and sullen air  Denounc'd his humour to the shudd'ring Fair  "Go change your dress give up this vain delight  "I will not hear of Masquerades tonight  "Your Chaperone's inform'd she need not wait  "So change your dress and sit with me sedate"  As the proud dame whose avaricious glee  Built golden castles in the rich South Sea  Gaz'd on her Broker when he told her first  Her wealth was vanish'd and the bubble burst  So gaz'd the Nymph hearing her Sire destroy  Her airy palace of ideal joy  First her fond thoughts to flattering doubt incline  And deem the harsh command no fix'd design  But the quick sally of a peevish word  That Love revokes the moment it is heard  Or haply mirth in mimic wrath exprest  A feign'd forbiddance utter'd but in jest  To this short hope her sinking spirit clung  To see his softening eyes refute his tongue  Ah fruitless hope for there she cannot find  The wellknown signals of the friendly mind  Stern Contradiction with the frown of Fate  On his dark visage reign'd in sullen state  Felt in each feature in each accent shewn  Lower'd in his look and thunder'd in his tone  Hence the warm bosom of the lively Fair  Now shivers with the chill of blank despair  Now Disappointment's thick'ning shadows roll  A cloud of horror o'er the darken'd soul  And Fancy in a sick delirium tost  Gives double value to each pleasure lost  The blasted joys she labours to forget  Rush on her mind and waken keen regret  Her cheek turns palethe tear prepares to start  And palpitation heaves her swelling heart  But here SOPHROSYNE thy guardian aid  Saves from her potent foe the sinking Maid  Her bosom into strong emotions thrown  Now feels the pressure of thy friendly Zone  Swift thy kind cautions to her soul recur  More quick to cancel faults than prone to err  As the rough swell of the insurgent tides  By the mild impulse of the Moon subsides  So by her mystic Monitor represt  The flood of passion leaves her lighten'd breast  From her clear brain each cloudy vapour flies  And Joy's bright ray rekindles in her eyes  Reviving Gaiety full lustre spread  O'er all her features and with smiles she said  "Let others drive to Pleasure's distant dome  "Be mine the dearer joy to please at home"  Scarce had she spoke when she with sportive ease  Prest her Pianoforte's fav'rite keys  O'er softest notes her rapid fingers ran  Sweet prelude to the Air she thus began  SOPHROSYNE thou Guard unseen  Whose delicate controul  Can turn the discord of Chagrin  To Harmony of Soul  Above the lyre the lute above  Be mine thy melting tone  Which makes the peace of all we love  The basis of our own  So sung the Nymph not uninspir'd the Sprite  Invok'd so fondly in the mystic rite  With richest music swell'd her warbling throat  And gave new sweetness to her sweetest note  As when the seraph Uriel first begun  His carol to the newcreated Sun  The sacred echo shook the vast profound  And Chaos perish'd at the potent sound  So at the magic of SERENA's strain  Spleen vanish'd from her Sire's chaotic brain  Whose fibres lighten'd of that load rejoice  In the dear accents of her dulcet voice  Much he inclines his mandate to recall  And send the Fair one to the promis'd Ball  But stubborn Pride forbids him to revoke  The solemn sentence which Illhumour spoke  Still conscious of her power the Nymph prolongs  The soft enchantment of her soothing songs  Which his fond mind in firm attention keep  To his fixt hour of supper and of sleep  This now arriv'd the Knight retiring shed  A double blessing on his darling's head  And with unusual exultation prest  His lovely Child to his parental breast  Thus while to rest the happy Sire withdrew  The Nymph more happy to her chamber flew  And Jenny now dismiss'd the grateful Fair  Breathes to her guardian Sprite this tender prayer  "Thou kind Preserver whose attentive zeal  "Gives me in this contented hour to feel  "That dearest pleasure of a soul refin'd  "The triumph of the selfcorrected mind  "If happy in the strength thy smiles impart  "I own thy favour in no thankless heart  "Still let me view thy form so justly dear  "Still in kind Visions to these eyes appear  "Thy friendly dictates teach me to fulfil  "And let thy aid avert each future ill"  While fond Devotion taught her thus to speak  The soft Down sinks beneath her lovely cheek  And settling on her lips that sweetly close  Silence enamour'd lulls her to repose  END OF THE SECOND CANTO  CANTO III  YE kind Transporters of the excursive soul  Ye Visions that when Night enwraps the Pole  The lively wanderer to new worlds convey  Escaping from her heavy house of clay  How could the gentle spirit foe to strife  Bear without you this coil of waking life  Its griefembitter'd cares its joyless mirth  And all the flat realities of earth  'Tis you sweet Phantoms who new powers inspire  Who give to Beauty charms to Fancy fire  When soaring like the eagle's kindred frame  The Poet dreams of everlasting Fame  Or tickled by the feather of the dove  The softer Virgin dreams of endless Love  There was a time when Fortune's bright decrees  Were seen to realize such dreams as these  Now dangerous visions the fond mind decoy  Vainly to hope for unexisting joy  While Belles and Bards with mournful sighs exclaim  Mortality has seiz'd both Love and Fame  Ah fair SERENA might the boast be ours  To clear from such a charge these heavenly Powers  Blest might thy Bard deserve in Fame to see  A guard as faithful as Love proves to thee  Blest if that airy Being gild his life  Who sav'd thee trembling on the brink of strife  And now kind prompter of thy nightly dream  Fill'd thy rapt spirit with her sacred beam  For soon as Slumber set thy soul at large  Thy Guardian Power revisited her charge  And lightly hovering o'er th' illumin'd bed  Thus with fond smiles of approbation said  "Well hast thou past sweet Maid one trying scene  "One fiery ordeal of the tyrant Spleen  "Thus my SERENA may thy force sustain  "Each harder trial that may yet remain  "Against the Fiend to fortify thy soul  "By useful knowledge of her dark controul  "I come to shew thee what no mortal eye  "Save thine was e'er permitted to descry  "The realms where Spleen's infernal agents goad  "The ghostly tenants of her drear abode  "Now summon all thy strength throw fear aside  "And firmly trust in thy aetherial Guide"  She spoke and thro' the Night's surrounding shade  The obedient Nymph not unappall'd convey'd  Thro' long long tracts of darkness on they past  With speed that struck the trembling Maid aghast  Till now recovering by degrees she found  Her soft foot press upon the solid ground  Encourag'd by her Guide at length she tries  To search the gloomy scene with anxious eyes  Per me si va nella citta dolente  Per me si va nell' eterno dolore  Per me si va tra la perduta gente  Lasciate ogni speranza voi ch' intrate  Queste parole di colore oscuro  Vid' io scritte al sommo d'una porta  DANTE Inferno  "Thro' me ye pass to Spleen's terrific dome  Thro' me to Discontent's eternal home  Thro' me to those who sadden'd human life  By sullen humour or vexatious strife  And here thro' scenes of endless vapours hurl'd  Are punish'd in the forms they plagued the world  Justly they feel no joy who none bestow  All ye who enter every hope forego"  O'er an arch'd cavern rough with horrid stone  On which a feeble light by flashes shone  These characters that chill'd her soul with dread  SERENA fixt in silent wonder read  As she began to speak her voice was drown'd  By the shrill echo of far other sound  Forth from the portal lamentable cries  Of wailing Infants without number rise  Compassion to this poor and piteous flock  Led the soft Maid still nearer to the rock  The pining band within she now espied  And touch'd with tender indignation cried  "How could these little forms of life so brief  "Deserve this dire abode of lasting grief"  "Well may thy gentle heart be sore concern'd  "At sight so moving" the mild Sprite return'd  "Thou seest in those whose wailings wound thy ears  "The puny progeny of modern Peers  "Their Sires by Avarice or Ambition led  "Aliens to Love approach'd the nuptial bed  "With proud indifference and with cold distaste  "Their homely brides reluctantly embrac'd  "And by such union gave disastrous birth  "To these poor pale incumbrances of earth  "Who bred in Vanity with Pride their dower  "Were Spleen's sure victims from their natal hour  "And in their splendid cradles pul'd and pin'd  "Till Fate their illspun thread of life untwin'd  "And to this vestibule convey'd their ghosts  "To form the vanguard of th' infernal hosts  "But let not Pity's ineffectual charm  "Impede thy progress or thy strength disarm  "Follow and fear not guarded by my care  "From all the phantoms that around thee glare"  She spoke and enter'd ere the Nymph replied  A pass that open'd in the cavern's side  Low dark and rockywith her body bent  SERENA follow'd down the dire descent  A sudden light soon struck her dazzled view  But 'twas a light of such infernal hue  As double horror to the darkness gave  With dread reflection from a dusky wave  Round a black water tatter'd spectres stand  With each a tiny taper in its hand  Fierce Mendicants who strive some alms to win  From the fair Wanderer with incessant din  The Guardian Spirit saw SERENA grieve  To hear of wants she knew not to relieve  And to the generous Nymph in pity cries  "The Gulph of Indolence before us lies  "O'er whose dull flood to which no bank is seen  "A boat must waft thee to the dome of Spleen  "These pallid figures that around thee press  "And haunt thee with importunate distress  "On earth were Beggars of each different class  "Tho' blended here in one promiscuous mass  "The Poor who spurn'd kind Industry's controul  "The Rich who begg'd from penury of soul  "Both by their abject pride alike debas'd  "Blasphem'd that nature which they both disgrac'd  "And hither by the sullen Fiend convey'd  "Here still they ply their ineffectual trade  "In chase of each new passenger they run  "Condemn'd to beg from all to gain by none  "But from these wretches turn thy fruitless care  "Behold the gulph before thee and beware  "Nor touch the stream which mortal sense o'ercomes  "And by its baleful charm the soul benumbs"  "Can mortal pass" the shudd'ring Nymph replied  "This sullen slow unnavigable tide  "In whose black current this enormous mound  "Of shapeless stone appears this horrid bound  "That seems an everlasting guard to keep  "O'er the dull waters that beneath it creep"  While yet she spoke with a resounding shock  Forth from the arch of the impending rock  Which o'er the murmuring eddy hung so low  The lazy river scarce had room to flow  Of rude construction and in roughest plight  A boat now issued to SERENA's sight  An empty boat that slowly to the shore  Advanc'd without the aid of sail or oar  Selfmov'd it seem'd but soon the Nymph beheld  A grizly figure who the stern impell'd  Wading behind the horrid Form appear'd  Above the water his strong arm he rear'd  And cross the creeping flood the crazy vessel steer'd  The heavenly Sprite observ'd her trembling Ward  Whose growing fears the hideous pass abhorr'd  And cheering thus she spake "This Spectre boasts  "The chief dominion of these dreary coasts  "To him thy Pilot without dread consign  "And place thy body in his bark supine  "So thro' this arching rock thou'lt pass alone  "Safe from the perils of th' incumbent stone  "Embark undauntedon the farther side  "Thou'lt surely find me thy unfailing Guide  "Nor let this Pilot raise thy groundless dread  "This sullen Charon of the froward dead  "A Phantom never blest with human life  "Tho' oft on earth his noxious power is rife  "And in that region ne'er from error free  "The words he dictates are assign'd to me  "Observe this Fiend that Nature scorn'd to frame  "Offspring of Pride and Apathy his name  "Passions he ne'er can feel and ne'er impart  "A miscreated Imp without a heart  "In place of which his subtle parent pinn'd  "A bladder fill'd with circulating wind  "Which seems with mimic life the mass to warm  "And gives false vigour to his bloated form  "But place thee in the boat his arms direct  "My love shall watch thee and my power protect"  So spake the friendly Sprite th' obedient Maid  Her form along the narrow vessel laid  But oh what terrors shake her tender soul  As from the shore the bark begins to roll  And sever'd from her Friend her eyes discern  The steering Spectre wading at the stern  Far stronger fears her resolution melt  Than those which erst the Bard of Florence felt  When by the honour'd shade of Virgil led  Thro' all the dreary circles of the dead  Hell's fiercest Demons threaten'd to divide  The living Poet from his shadowy Guide  And bade him friendless and alone return  Thro' the dire horrors of the dark sojourn  Not long the lovely Fair one's terrors last  For safely thro' th' impending rock she past  And slow advancing to the gloomy strand  The sullen Pilot brings her safe to land  There fondly hovering on her guardian plumes  The heavenly Monitor her charge resumes  And smiling leads along the rocky road  Whose windings open into Spleen's abode  Thou Queen of Shades whose spiritdamping spell  Too oft is seen the Poet's pride to quell  When the sharp workings of unrelish'd wit  Plunge thy pale victim in a bilious fit  May I unpunish'd by thy subtle power  Dare to display thy subterranean bower  And to this wond'ring upper world explain  The shadowy horrors of thy secret reign  Entering beneath a wide fantastic arch  Round the drear circuit of the dome they march  Which a pale flash from many a fiery Sprite  Frequent illumes with intermitting light  Such as on earth to Superstition's eye  Denounces ruin from the northern sky  While she discerns amid the nightly glare  Armies embattled in the blazing air  Around the Nymph unnumber'd phantoms glide  Here swell the bloated race of bulky Pride  In close and horrid union there appear  The wilder progeny of frantic Fear  Misshapen monsters whose stupendous frame  Abhorrent Nature has refus'd to name  Here in Cameleon colours lightly flit  The motley offspring of disorder'd Wit  All things prodigious the wide cave contain'd  And forms beyond what Fable ever feign'd  But as the worm that on the dewy green  Springs half to view and half remains unseen  Perceiving near its cell a human tread  Slinks back to earth and hides its timid head  So where the heavenly Spirit deign'd to lead  The startled spectres from her step recede  And as abash'd they from her eye retire  Sink into mist or melt in fluid fire  High on an ebon throne superbly wrought  With each fierce figure of fantastic thought  In a deep cove where no bright beam intrudes  O'er her black schemes the sullen Empress broods  The ShriekOwl's mingled with the Raven's plume  Shed o'er her furrow'd brows an aweful gloom  A garb that glares with stripes of lurid flame  Wraps in terrific pomp her haggard frame  Round her a Serpent as her zone is roll'd  Which writhing stings itself in every fold  Near her pavilion in barbaric state  Four Mutes the mandates of their Queen await  From sickly Fancy bred by sullen Sloth  Both parents' curse yet pamper'd still by both  First stands Disease an hag of magic power  Varying her frightful visage every hour  Her horrors heightening as those changes last  And each new form more hideous than the past  Detraction next a shapeless Fiend appears  Whose shrivell'd hand a misty mirror rears  Fram'd by malignant Art th' infernal toy  Inverts the lovely mien of smiling Joy  Robs roseate Beauty of attractive Grace  And gives a stepdame's frown to Nature's face  The third in place but with a fiercer air  See the true Gorgon Disappointment glare  By whose petrific power Delight's o'erthrown  And Hope's warm heart becomes an icy stone  Last in a gorgeous robe that ill bestow'd  Bows her mean body by its cumbrous load  Stands fretful Discontent of Fiends the worst  By dignity debas'd by blessings curst  Who poisons Pleasure with the sourest leaven  And makes a Hell of Love's extatic Heaven  The Guide celestial near this ghastly group  Perceiv'd her tender Charge with terror droop  "Fear not sweet Maid" she cries "my steps pursue  "Nor gaze too long on this infernal crew  "Turn from Detraction's fascinating glass  "In silence cross the throne observe and pass  "Beyond this dome the palace of the Queen  "Her empire winds thro' many a dreary scene  "Where she torments as their deserts require  "Her various victims that on earth expire  "Each class apart for in a different cell  "The Fierce the Fretful and the Sullen dwell  "These shalt thou slightly view in vapours hurl'd  "And swiftly then regain thy native world  "But first remark within that ample nich  "With every quaint device of splendor rich  "Yon Phantom who from vulgar eyes withdrawn  "Appears to stretch in one eternal yawn  "Of empire here he holds the tottering helm  "Prime Minister in Spleen's discordant realm  "The pillar of her spreading state and more  "Her darling offspring whom on earth she bore  "For as on earth his wayward mother stray'd  "Grandeur with eyes of fire her form survey'd  "And with strong passion starting from his throne  "Unloos'd the sullen Queen's reluctant zone  "From his embrace conceiv'd in moody joy  "Rose the round image of a bloated boy  "His nurse was Indolence his tutor Pomp  "Who kept the child from every childish romp  "They rear'd their nursling to the bulk you see  "And his proud parents call'd their imp ENNUI  "This realm he rules and in superb attire  "Visits each earthly palace of his Sire  "A thousand shapes he wears now pert now prim  "Pursues each grave conceit or idle whim  "In arms in arts in government engages  "With Monarchs Poets Politicians Sages  "But drops each work the moment it's begun  "And trying all things can accomplish none  "Yet o'er each rank and age and sex his sway  "Spreads undiscern'd and makes the world his prey  "The light Coquet amid flirtation sighs  "To find him lurk in Pleasure's vain disguise  "And the grave Nun discovers in her cell  "That holy water but augments his spell  "As the strange monster of the serpent breed  "That haunts as travellers tell the marshy mead  "Devours each nobler beast tho' firmly grown  "To size and strength superior to his own  "For on the grazing Horse or larger Bull  "Subtly he springs of dark saliva full  "With swiftlydarting tongue his prey anoints  "With venom potent to dissolve its joints  "And while its bulk in liquid poison swims  "Swallows its melting bone and fluid limbs  "So this Ennui this wonderworking Elf  "Can vanquish powers far mightier than himself  "Nor Wit nor Science soar his reach above  "And oft he seizes on successful Love  "Of all the radiant host who lend their aid  "To light mankind thro' life's bewildering shade  "Bright Charity alone with cloudless ray  "May boast exemption from his baleful sway  "Haste then sweet Nymph nor let us longer roam  "Round the drear circle of this dangerous dome  "Lest e'en thy Guide entangled in his spell  "Should fail to guard thee from a Fiend so fell"  So speaking the kind Spirit's anxious care  Led from the palace the attentive Fair  And winding thro' a passage dark and rude  Thus the mild Monitor her speech renew'd  "'Gainst Fear and Pity now thy bosom steel  "For sights more horrible I now reveal  "Spleen's tortur'd victims view with dauntless eyes  "For lo her penal realms before thee rise"  The Nymph advancing saw with mute amaze  A dismal deep enormous dungeon blaze  Stones of red fire the hideous wall compos'd  And massive gates the horrid confine clos'd  Th' infernal Portress of this doleful dome  With fiery lips that swell'd with poisonous foam  Pale Discord rag'd with whose tormenting tongue  Thro' all its caves th' extensive region rung  A living Vulture was the Fury's crest  And in her hand a Rattlesnake she prest  Whose angry joints incessantly were heard  To sound defiance to the screaming Bird  "The boundless depth of this dire prison holds  "The untam'd spirits of imperious Scolds  "Nor think that Females only fill the cave  "Male Termagants have liv'd and here they rave  "All of each sex are pent within this pale  "Who knew no use of language but to rail"  Thus to her Charge exclaim'd the heavenly Guide  And as she spoke the portals open'd wide  And to th' observance of the shuddering Maid  Th' immeasurable den was all display'd  But oh what various noises from within  Fill the next air with one stupendous din  Mourning's deep groan and Anger's furious call  Terror's loud cry and Affectation's squall  The sob of Passion the Hysteric scream  And shrieks of Frenzy in its fierce extreme  In this wild uproar every sound's combin'd  That stuns the senses and distracts the mind  "Mark" to the Nymph SOPHROSYNE began  "The fierce Xantippe flaming in the van  "The vase she emptied on the Sage's head  "Hangs o'er her own a different shower to shed  "For drop by drop distilling liquid fire  "It fills the Vixen with new tropes of ire  "Beyond the Grecian dame extend your view  "And mark the spectre of a modern Shrew  "She who whene'er she din'd with furious look  "Spurn'd her nice food and bellow'd at her cook  "Here justly feels a culinary rack  "Bound like Ixion to a whirling jack  "But lo the Tityus of this realm whose hulk  "Is stretch'd supine and whose enormous bulk  "To such extent in this wide scene is spread  "Nine acres seem too narrow for his bed  "This form was once but many years are past  "Since in his Civic furs he breath'd his last  "Lord Mayor of London his whole life one treat  "And all his business but to rail and eat  "The circling group of Fish and Fowl and Beasts  "Once crown'd his table and compos'd his feasts  "For all the creatures mark this strange event  "Which he devour'd with growling discontent  "O'er him their reunited limbs display  "The grumbling Glutton's flesh they rend away  "And find his swelling form a neverfailing prey  "See where nine Bucks have gor'd his monstrous haunch  "See fifty Turkies gobble on his paunch  "O'er his broad side twelve creeping Turtles spread  "And Fowls unnumber'd flutter round his head"  SERENA gaz'd but soon she turn'd away  Sick with disgust and shuddering with dismay  "To scenes less hideous let us now repair"  Said the kind Guard of the dejected Fair  And cheering her faint Charge her step she led  To the near dwelling of the fretful dead  Of dusky adamant the dungeon rose  A dingy mirror its dark sides compose  Reflecting with a thousand quaint grimaces  The pale inhabitants' distorted faces  "Here like a Dame of Quality array'd  "Sits Peevishness presiding o'er the shade  "And frowning at her own uncomely mien  "Whose coarse reflection on the wall is seen  "A snarling Lapdog her righthand restrains  "Her lap an infant Porcupine contains  "Which while her fondness tries its wrath to still  "Wounds her each moment with a pointed quill  "The froward Spirits here in durance fret  "Whose testy life was one continued pet  "Here they in trifles that vexation find  "Which teaz'd on earth their irritated mind  "Observe the Phantom who with eyes askance  "Still to the mirror turns her eager glance  "While on her cheek at every anxious turn  "Blushes of new mortification burn  "Beauty for lasting bliss had form'd the Maid  "Love to her arms his faithful homage paid  "But all this swelling tide of joy to check  "A fatal Freckle rises on her neck  "Her soft cosmetics the vext Nymph applies  "Success attends her and the Freckle dies  "But ah this victory avails her not  "She finds an Hydra in the teazing spot  "Fast as one flies another still succeeds  "And with eternal food her fretful humour feeds  "Near to the Nymph in a more moody fit  "See the pale Phantom of a peevish Wit  "Mark with what frowns his eager eyes peruse  "Wet from the press three Critical Reviews  "With wounded Vanity's distracting rage  "How rapidly he runs thro' every page  "He finds some honours lavish'd on his Verse  "And Joy's faint gleams his gloomy spirit pierce  "But oh too soon these feeble sparks decay  "And keen Vexation reassumes her prey  "Hating reproof in every fibre sore  "One censur'd particle torments him more  "More than a hundred happier lines delight  "Which liberal favour condescends to cite  "But time will fail us if we pause to view  "The various torments of the testy crew  "These wretched chymists whose o'erheated brain  "Extracts from nothing a substantial pain  "Yet ere to different districts we advance  "Take of one fretful tribe a transient glance  "Their unsuspected punishments supply  "A lesson useful to the Female eye  "Spleen's liveliest agent here beguiles the gay  "Fair to attract and flattering to betray"  As thus the kind aetherial Guardian spoke  Within a rock whence plaintive murmurs broke  She touch'd a secret spring whose power was such  Two jarring doors unfolded at the touch  And with the charms of regal splendor bright  A chearful banquet sparkles to the sight  Viands so light so elegantly grac'd  Might tempt e'en Temperance herself to taste  For Fruits alone compos'd th' inticing treat  Fair to the eye and to the palate sweet  In such bright juice the Pear and Cherry swim  As make the Topaz and the Ruby dim  Here crown'd with every flower and gaily drest  In all the glitter of a Gallic vest  Whose ample folds her loathsome body screen'd  A child of Luxury reigns a subtle Fiend  Who with a grace that every heart allures  Smiles on the lustre of her rich  liqueurs  Her fatal smiles their utmost power exert  To poison Beauty at her dire dessert  To blast the rose that Health's bright cheek adorns  And fill each festive heart with latent thorns  For the sly Fiend of every art possest  Steals on th' affection of her Female guest  And by her soft address seducing each  Eager she plies them with a Brandy Peach  They with keen lip the luscious fruit devour  But swiftly feel its peacedestroying power  Quick thro' each vein new tides of frenzy roll  All evil passions kindle in the soul  Drive from each feature every chearful grace  And glare ferocious in the sallow face  The wounded nerves in furious conflict tear  Then sink in blank dejection and despair  Effects more dire thus tempting to deceive  The Apple wrought not in the soul of Eve  Howe'er disguis'd in Jelly or in Jam  Spleen has no poison surer than a Dram  "But haste we now" the heavenly Leader cries  "To where this penal world's last wonder lies"  She spoke and led the Nymph thro' deeper dells  Lowmurmuring vaults and horrorbreathing cells  And now they pass a perforated cage  Where rancorous Spectres without number rage  "Avert thine eye" the heavenly Spirit said  "Nor view these abject tribes of envious dead  "Who pin'd to hear the voice of Truth proclaim  "A Sister's beauty or a Brother's fame  "Tho' crown'd with all Prosperity imparts  "High in their various ranks and several arts  "Yet meanly sunk by Envy's base controul  "They died in that consumption of the soul  "And here thro' bars that twisted Adders make  "And the long volumes of th' envenom'd Snake  "O'er this dark road they dart an anxious eye  "Still envying every Fiend that flutters by  "Pass and regard them not"Th' attentive Maid  In silent tremor the behest obey'd  This dungeon crost her weary feet she drags  Thro' winding caverns and o'er icy crags  Soulchilling damps in the dark passage reign  Which issues on a vast and dreary plain  Fann'd by no breezes with no verdure crown'd  The black horizon is its only bound  And now advancing in a drizzly mist  Thro' sullen Phantoms hating to exist  SERENA spies high o'er his subjects plac'd  The ghastly Tyrant of the gloomy waste  Murmuring he sits upon a rocking stone  Th' unstable base of his illfounded throne  Hideous his face and horrible his frame  Misanthropy the grizly Monster's name  Him to fierce Pride with raging passion sore  The frowning Gorgon Disappointment bore  On earth detested and by heaven abhorr'd  Of this drear wild he reigns the moody lord  Few are the subjects of his waste domain  And scarce a Female in his frightful train  Except one changing corps of ancient Prudes  Reluctant here the prying band intrudes  Each who on earth behind her artful fan  Feign'd coarse aversion to the creature Man  Is doom'd in this dark region to abide  Some transient pains for hypocritic pride  Here everduring chains those Scoffers bind  Whose writings deaden and debase the mind  Who mock Creation with injurious scorn  And feel a fancied void in Plenty's horn  In his right hand an emblem of his cares  A branch of Aconite the Monarch bears  And those sour Phantoms who this region haunt  He feeds with berries from this deadly plant  For strange to tell tho' sever'd from its root  The bough still blackens with successive fruit  The tribes who taste it burst into a fit  Of raving mockery and rancorous wit  And pleas'd their Tyrant's ghastly smile to court  By vile distortions make him various sport  The frantic rabble who his sway confess  Before his throne an hideous Puppet dress  When in unseemly rags they have array'd  The image from their own dark semblance made  In horrid gambols round their work they throng  With antic dance and rude discordant song  Satire's rank offals on the block they fling  And call it Nature to delight their King  While in their features he exults to see  The frowns of Torture mixt with grins of Glee  For as these abject toils engage the crew  Their own grim idol darkens to their view  Wide and more wide its horrid stature spreads  And o'er the tribe new consternation sheds  For each forgets in his bewilder'd gaze  'Tis but a Monster which he help'd to raise  As o'er its form their dizzy glances roll  It strikes a chearless damp thro' all the soul  Vainly to shun the baleful sight they try  It draws for ever the reluctant eye  At each review with deeper dread they start  A colder chaos numbs each freezing heart  No mutual confidence no friendly care  Relieves the panic they are doom'd to bear  For as they shrink absorb'd in wild affright  When each to each inclines his wounded sight  They feel for social comfort sour disgust  And all the sullen anguish of distrust  "Now mark SERENA" the mild Guide began  "The proudest Phantom of the gloomy clan  "Appointed by this surly Monarch's grace  "Highpriest of all his Misanthropic race  "See o'er the croud a throne of vapours lift  "That strange and motley form the shade of SWIFT  "Now shalt thou view" the guardian Sprite pursues  "His horrid pennance that each day renews  "Perchance its terrors may o'erwhelm thy sense  "But trust my care to bear thee safely hence"  As thus she spoke above the gazing throng  High in a sailing cloud the Spectre swept along  Vain of his power of elocution proud  In mystic language he harangu'd the crowd  The bounds he mark'd with measure so precise  Of Equine virtue and of Human vice  That cursing Nature's gifts without remorse  Each sullen hearer wish'd himself a Horse  Pleas'd with the pure effect his sermon wrought  Th' ambitious Priest a rich Tiara caught  Which hovering o'er his highaspiring head  Sarcastic Humour dangled by a thread  The rich Tiara for his temples fit  Blaz'd with each polish'd gem of brilliant wit  And sharpfac'd Irony his darling Sprite  Who rais'd her patron to this giddy height  Fast on his brow the dangerous honour bound  But in the moment that her Priest was crown'd  His airy throne dissolv'd and thunder rent the ground  Forth from the yawning earth with lightning's speed  Sprung the fierce phantom of a fiery Steed  Spurring his sides whence bloody poison flow'd  The ghastlygrinning Fiend Derision rode  In her righthand a horrid whip she shakes  Whose sounding lash was form'd of knotted snakes  An uncouth bugle her lefthand display'd  From a grey monkey's skull by Malice made  As her distorted lips this whistle blew  Forth rush'd the Spectre of a wild Yahoo  See the poor Wit in hasty terror spring  And fly for succour to his grizzly King  In vain his piercing cries that succour court  The grizzly King enjoys the cruel sport  Behold the fierce Yahoo her victim caught  Drive her sharp talons thro' the seat of thought  That copious fountain which too well supplied  Perverted Ridicule's malignant tide  Quick from her steed the grinning Fiend descends  From the pierc'd skull the spleenful brain she rends  To black Misanthropy her ghastly King  See the keen Hag this horrid present bring  Her daily gift for as each day arrives  Her destin'd victim for new death revives  The Huntress now this direst pageant past  On her wild bugle blew so dread a blast  The sharp sound pierc'd thro' all the depths of Hell  The Fiends all answer'd in one hideous yell  And in a fearful trance the soft SERENA fell  Hence from the lovely Nymph her senses fled  Till thro' the parted curtains of her bed  The amorous Sun who now began to rise  Kist with a sportive beam her opening eyes  END OF THE THIRD CANTO  CANTO IV  HAIL thou enlighten'd Globe of human joy  Where social cares the soften'd heart employ  What cheering rays of vital comfort roll  In thy bright regions o'er the rescued soul  Which 'scaping from the dark domain of Spleen  Springs with new warmth to thy attractive scene  Once more I bless thy pleasurebreathing gale  And gaze enchanted on thy flowery vale  Where smiling Innocence and ardent Youth  Sport hand in hand with Beauty and with Truth  Sport on sweet revellers in rosy bowers  Safe from th' intrusion of all evil Powers  Ah fruitless wish of the benignant Muse  Which to this chequer'd world the Fates refuse  For round its precincts many an ugly Sprite  Speeds undiscern'd to poison pure delight  Amidst the foremost of this haggard band  Unwearied poster of the sea and land  Wrapt in dark mists malignant Scandal flies  While Envy's poison'd breath the buoyant gale supplies  Tho' SHERIDAN with shafts of comic wit  Pierc'd and expos'd her to the laughing Pit  Th' immortal Hag still wears her paper crown  The dreaded Empress of the idle Town  O'erleaping her prerogative of old  To sink the noble to defame the bold  In chace of Worth to slip the dogs of Strife  Thro' all the ample range of public life  The Tyrant now that sanctuary burst  Where Happiness by Privacy is nurst  Her fury rising as her powers encrease  O'erturns the altars of domestic Peace  Pleas'd in her dark and galldistilling cloud  The sportive form of Innocence to shroud  Beauty's young train her baleful eyes survey  To mark the fairest as her favourite prey  Hence sweet SERENA while thy spirit stray'd  Round the deep realms of subterranean shade  This keenest agent of th' infernal Powers  On earth was busied in those tranquil hours  To blast thy peace and poison'd darts to aim  Against the honour of thy spotless name  For Scandal restless Fiend who never knows  The balmy blessing of an hour's repose  Worn yet unsated with her daily toil  In her base work consumes the midnight oil  O'er fiercer Fiends when heavy slumbers creep  When wearied Avarice and Ambition sleep  Scandal is vigilant and keen to spread  The plagues that spring from her prolific head  On Truth's fair basis she her falsehood builds  With tinsel sentiment its surface gilds  To nightly labour from their dark abodes  The Demons of the groaning Press she goads  And smiles to see their rapid art supply  Ten thousand wings to every infant lye  In triumph now behold the Hag applaud  Her keen and fav'rite Imp ingenious Fraud  Her quick Compositor whose flying hand  Has clos'd the paragraph she keenly plann'd  No Nymph she nam'd yet mark'd her vile intent  That Dullness could not miss the name she meant  In Satire's tints the injur'd Fair she drew  In form an Angel but in soul a Jew  It chanc'd her Sire among his friends inroll'd  A wealthy Senator infirm and old  Who dup'd too early by a generous heart  Rashly assum'd a Misanthropic part  Tho' peevish fancies would his mind incrust  Goodnature's image lurk'd beneath their rust  And gay SERENA with that sportive wit  Which heals the folly that it deigns to hit  Would oft the sickness of his soul beguile  And teach the sullen humorist to smile  Pleas'd by her virtuous frolics to assuage  The mental anguish of distemper'd age  This ancient friend in a sarcastic sketch  Was mark'd by Scandal as a monied wretch  For whom the young yet mercenary Fair  Had subtly spread a matrimonial snare  With such base matter more diffusely wrought  The spiritpiercing paragraph was fraught  O'er which with glee the eye of Scandal glar'd  Which for the opening Press herself prepar'd  She on the types her inky wad let fall  And smear'd each letter with her bitterest gall  The Press whose ready gripe the charge receives  Stamps it successive on ten thousand leaves  Which pil'd in heaps impatient seem to lie  They only wait the dawn of day to fly  Now as the trembling child which long has laid  Mute in the dark and of itself afraid  When haply conscious of the pain it feels  The watchful mother to its pillow steals  Springs to her breast and shakes off all alarms  Feeling its safety in her fostering arms  With such quick joy in innocence as young  The soft SERENA from her pillow sprung  Pleas'd to awake from her terrific dream  And feel the chearful Sun's returning beam  Eager she rose in busy thought nor staid  The wonted summons of her punctual Maid  And as her own fair hands adjust her vest  The guardian Cincture flutters on her breast  For fondly when she wak'd or when she slept  Still round her heart th' important Zone she kept  Thou happy Girdle to thy charge be just  Firm be thy threads and faithful to their trust  For hours approach when all the stores they hide  Of magic virtue must be strongly tried  Now while her kind domestic heart intends  To please her early Sire the Nymph descends  But sleep who left the Fair with sudden flight  With late wings hover'd o'er the good old Knight  And the chill circle of the lone saloon  Informs the shiv'ring Maid she rose too soon  'Tis true attentive John's unfailing care  Began the rites of breakfast to prepare  But yet no fires on the cold altar burn  No smoke arises from the silver urn  And the blank teaboard where no viands lay  Only supplied the Paper of the day  Tho' mild SERENA's peacedevoted mind  The keen debate of politics declin'd  And heard with cold contempt or generous hate  The frauds of Party and the lies of State  Nor car'd much more for Fashion's loose intrigues  Than factious bickerings or foreign leagues  Yet while she saunters idle and alone  Her careless eyes are on the Paper thrown  As some gay Youth whom sportive friends engage  To view the furious Ourang in his cage  If while amus'd he sees the monster grin  And trusts too careless to the bolts within  If the sly Beast as near the grate he draws  Tear him unguarded with projected paws  Starts at the wound and feels his bosom thrill  With pain and wonder at the sudden ill  So did SERENA start so wildly gaze  In such mixt pangs of anguish and amaze  Feeling the wound which Scandal had design'd  To lacerate her mild and modest mind  Startled as one who from electric wire  Unheeding catches unsuspected fire  She reads then almost doubts that she has read  And thinks some vision hovers round her head  Now her fixt eye some striking words confine  And now she darts it thrice thro' every line  Nor could Amazement more her senses shake  Had every letter been a Gorgon's snake  Now rising Indignation takes its turn  And her flush'd cheeks with tingling blushes burn  With restless motion and with many a frown  Thro' the wide room she paces up and down  Now musing makes a momentary stand  The fatal Paper fluttering in her hand  So the shy Bird by cruel sportsmen sprung  And by their random fire severely stung  Scar'd not disabled by the distant wound  Now trembling flies now skims along the ground  Now vainly tries in some sequester'd spot  From her gor'd breast to shake the galling shot  Ye tender Nymphs whose kindling souls would flame  Touch'd like SERENA's by injurious blame  O let your quick and kindred spirits form  A vivid picture of the mental storm  In which she labour'd and whose force to paint  The Muse's strongest tints appear too faint  In sympathetic thought her suffering see  But O for ever from such wrongs be free  Her faithful Girdle try'd its power to save  And oft a monitory impulse gave  Still unregarded still unfelt it prest  With useless energy her heaving breast  Her mind forgetful of the magic Zone  Full of the burning shaft by Scandal thrown  With blended notes of sorrow and disdain  Thus in disorder'd language vents its pain  "Had Malice dar'd my honour to defame  "The selfrefuted lie had lost its aim  "But here the world deceiv'd by sland'rous art  "Must think SERENA has a venal heart"  A venal heart at that detested sound  In swelling anguish her sunk voice was drown'd  Now was a fearful crisis of her fate  Distended now by Passion's growing weight  And for its Mistress fill'd with conscious dread  The magic Girdle crack'd thro' every thread  And snapp'd perchance by Scandal's force accurst  From her full heart the guardian Zone had burst  And spite of all the virtues of the Fair  The spell of Happiness had sunk in air  But that SOPHROSYNE whose friendly fear  Timely foresaw this trial too severe  An early succour gain'd from secret Love  From the fell Kite to snatch the falling Dove  As Nature studies in her wide domain  To blend some antidote with every bane  Thus her kind aid the friendly Power contriv'd  That from the quarter whence the wound arriv'd  There flow'd the anguish of that wound to calm  A soothing soft and medicinal balm  As in her agitated hand the Fair  Wav'd the loose Paper with disorder'd air  In capitals she saw SERENA flame  She blush'd she shudder'd as she view'd the name  Her ready fears subside in new surprize  And eager thus she reads with lighten'd eyes  Go faithful Sonnet to SERENA say  What charms peculiar in her features reign  A stranger whom her glance may ne'er survey  Pays her this tribute in no flattering strain  Tell her the Bard in Beauty's ample reign  Has seen a virgin cheek as richly glow  A bosom where the blue meandring vein  "Sheds as soft lustre thro' the lucid snow  Eyes that as brightly flash with joy and youth  And locks that like her own luxuriant flow  Then say for then she cannot doubt thy truth  That the wide earth no Female form can shew  Where Nature's legend so distinctly tells  In this fair shrine a fairer spirit dwells  With curious wonder the reviving Maid  View'd this fond homage to her beauty paid  A second glance o'er every line she cast  And half pronounc'd and half suppress'd the last  While modest Pleasure and ingenuous Pride  Her burning cheek with deeper crimson dy'd  O Praise thy language was by Heaven design'd  As manna to the faint bewilder'd mind  Beauty and Diffidence whose hearts rejoice  In the kind comfort of thy cheering voice  In this wild wood of life wert thou not nigh  Must like the wandering Babes lie down and die  But thy sweet accents wake new vital powers  And make this thorny path a path of flowers  As oil on Ocean's troubled waters spread  Smooths the rough billow to a level bed  The soothing Rhyme thus soften'd into rest  The painful tumult of SERENA's breast  Now to herself restor'd the conscious Maid  The lurking Fiend's insidious snare survey'd  Her nerves with grateful trepidation own  A slighter pressure from the faithful Zone  And in fond thought she breathes a thankful prayer  For her aetherial Guardian's constant care  Yet with a keen desire her bosom glow'd  To hear from whom the gentle Sonnet flow'd  But kind SOPHROSYNE who watch'd unseen  To shield her votary from the wiles of Spleen  As friendly Love had fixt a future time  When to reveal the secret of the Rhyme  Strove till that hour her fancy to restrain  Nor let her anxious wishes rise to pain  As Gaiety's fresh tide began to roll  Fast in the swelling channel of her soul  The good old Knight descends tho' eager slow  The Gout still tingling in his tender toe  And now paternal salutations past  His eyes he keenly on the Paper cast  While his sweet Daughter with attentive grace  Before him flies his ready cup to place  For Tea and Politics alternate share  In friendly rivalship his morning care  Tho' smooth as oil the Knight's goodhumour flows  When the mild breeze of pleasant fortune blows  Yet quick to catch the casual sparks of ire  Like oil it kindles into mountain fire  And fiercely now his flaming spirit blaz'd  While on those galling words he wildly gaz'd  Whose force had almost work'd into a storm  The gentler elements in Beauty's form  As the sarcastic sentence caught his view  Back from the board his elbowchair he drew  And by sharp stings of sudden fury prick'd  Far from his foot his gouty stool he kick'd  Fierce as Achilles by Atrides stung  He pour'd the stream of vengeance from his tongue  But ah those angry threats he deign'd to speak  Had sounds alas far differing from the Greek  Rage from his lips in legal language broke  Of Juries and of Damages he spoke  And on the Printer's lawdevoted head  He threaten'd deep revenge in terms most dread  Terms that with pain the ear of Beauty pierce  And oaths too rough to harmonize in verse  While thus the good old Knight with passion hot  His Toast neglected and his Tea forgot  The discord of the drama to increase  Now Prim PENELOPE assails her Niece  For as Sir GILBERT now with choler dumb  Points her the period with his angry thumb  "Ah Brother" cries the stiff malignant crone  Her sharp eye swiftly thro' the sentence thrown  "Scandal could never rise to heights like this  "But from the manners of each modern Miss  "Had but my Niece less giddy and more grave  "Observ'd the prudent hints I often gave"  The honest Knight her vile conclusion saw  And quick curtail'd it with a testy "Pshaw"  Mean while the gentle Maid who heard the taunt  Survey'd without a frown her prudish Aunt  Far other thoughts employ'd her softer mind  To one sweet purpose all her soul inclin'd  How she might close th' unpleasant scene how best  Restore goodhumour to her Father's breast  Her airy Guardian with delight survey'd  These tender wishes in the lovely Maid  And to accomplish what her heart desir'd  Trains of new thought above her age inspir'd  As Venus on her son's enlighten'd face  Shed richer charms and more attractive grace  When issuing forth from the dissolving cloud  His bright form burst on the admiring croud  So kind SOPHROSYNE unseen supplies  A livelier radiance to SERENA's eyes  And ere she speaks to captivate her Sire  Touches her lips with patriotic fire  It chanc'd that toss'd upon a vacant chair  A volume of that Wit lay near the Fair  Whose value try'd by Fashion's varying touch  Once rose too high and now is sunk too much  The book which Fortune plac'd within her reach  Contain'd O CHESTERFIELD the liberal speech  In which thy spirit like an Attic Sage  Strove to defend the violated Stage  From fetters basely forg'd by Ministerial rage  From this the Nymph her useful lesson took  And thus began reclining on the Book  "If on this noble Lord we may rely  "Scandal is but a speck on Freedom's eye  "And Public Spirit then will rather bear  "The casual pain it gives by growing there  "Than by a rash attempt to move it thence  "Hazard the safety of a precious Sense  "And by the efforts of a vain desire  "Rob this lifedarting eye of all its fire  "Tho' the soft breast of Innocence may smart  "By cruel Calumny's corroding dart  "Yet would she rather ache in every nerve  "And bear those pangs she knows not to deserve  "Much rather than be made a senseless tool  "To aid the frenzy of tyrannic rule  "Or forge one dangerous bolt for Power to aim  "At sacred Liberty's superior frame"  As ancient Chiefs were wont of old to gaze  With eyes of tender awe and fond amaze  On the fair Priestess of the Delphic fane  When first she utter'd her prophetic strain  Entranc'd in wonder thus Sir GILBERT view'd  His child yet more inspir'd who thus pursu'd  "For me I own these lines with gall replete  "Shot thro' my simple heart a sudden heat  "But happier thoughts my rising rage represt  "And turn'd the pointless insult to a jest  "And O should Slander still new wrath awake  "Still may my Father for his Daughter's sake  "Disdain the vengeance of litigious strife  "And let SERENA's answer beher life  She ended with a smile whose magic flame  Shot youthful vigour thro' her Father's frame  His Age his Anger and his Gout are fled  "Enchanting Girl" with tears of joy he said  "Enchanting Girl" twice echoed from his tongue  As speaking from his elbowchair he sprung  "Come to thy Father's armsBy Heaven thou art  "His own true offspring and a Whig in heart"  He spoke and his fond arms around her curl'd  With proud grasp seeming to infold the world  Her conscious heart she feels with triumph beat  And joys to find that triumph is compleat  For stiff PENELOPE who near them stood  "Albeit unused to the melting mood"  Squeez'd from her eyelid one reluctant tear  And soften'd with a smile her brow severe  But 'twas a smile of such a gloomy grace  As lighten'd once upon Alecto's face  When Orpheus past her leading back to life  From Pluto's regions his recover'd wife  When Love connubial join'd to Music's spell  Moisten'd with tender joy the eyes of Hell  Far other smiles with Pleasure's softest air  Gild the gay features of the youthful Fair  She looks like sportive Spring when her young charms  Wind round her hoary Sire's reluctant arms  And by a frolic infantine embrace  Banish the rugged frown from Winter's face  Thro' the long day she felt the glowing tide  Of exultation thro' her bosom glide  And oft she wish'd for slowapproaching Night  To hold sweet converse with her guardian Sprite  At length the hour approach'd her heart desir'd  And in her lonely chamber now retir'd  Her tender fancy gave the fondest scope  To ardent Gratitude and eager Hope  "Dear airy Being" the soft Nymph exclaim'd  "Whose power can break the spell that Spleen has fram'd  "Can by the waving of thy sightless wing  "O'er darkest forms a golden radiance fling  "And make in minds by sorriest thoughts perplext  "This moment's grief the triumph of the next  "I bless thy succour in each trial past  "Be present still and save me in the last"  Thus with her lovely eyes devoutly fixt  Where rays of hope and fear and reverence mixt  The tender Fair her faithful Guard addrest  Then with her cheek her downy pillow prest  But long her wakeful lids refuse to close  For Curiosity dispels repose  Her busy mind the mystic veil would pierce  That hides the Author of the pleasing Verse  Her lips involuntary catch the chime  And half articulate the soothing Rhyme  Till weary Thought no longer watch can keep  But sinks reluctant in the folds of Sleep  END OF THE FOURTH CANTO  CANTO V  WHY art thou fled O blest poetic time  When Fancy wrought the miracles of Rhyme  When darting from her starencircled throne  Her Poet's eye commanded worlds unknown  When by her fiat made a mimic God  He saw Existence waiting on his nod  And at his pleasure into being brought  New shadowy hosts the vassals of his thought  In Joy's gay garb in Terror's dread array  Darker than night and brighter than the day  Who at his bidding thro' the wilds of air  Rais'd willing mortals far from earthly care  And led them wondering thro' his wide domain  Beyond the bounds of Nature's narrow reign  While their rapt spirits in the various flight  Shook with successive thrills of new delight  Return sweet season grac'd with Fiction's flowers  Let not cold System cramp thy genial powers  Shall mild Morality in garb uncouth  The housewife garb of plain and homely Truth  Robb'd by stern Method of her rosy crown  Chill her faint votaries by a wintry frown  No thou sweet friend of Man as suits thee best  Shine forth in Fable's richembroider'd vest  O make my Verse thy vehicle thy arms  To spread o'er social life thy potent charms  And thou SOPHROSYNE mysterious Sprite  If haply I may trace thy steps aright  Roving thro' paths untrod by mortal feet  To paint for human eyes thy heavenly seat  Shed on my soul some portion of that power  Which sav'd SERENA in the trying hour  To bear those trials which however hard  As Bards all tell us may befall the Bard  The Fop's pert jest the Critic's frown severe  Learning's proud cant with Envy's artful sneer  And the vext Poet's last and worst disgrace  His cold blank Bookseller's rhymefreezing face  Hence ye dark omens that to Spleen belong  Ye shall not check the current of my song  While Beauty's lovely race for whom I sing  Fire my warm hand to strike the ready string  As Quiet now her lightest mantle laid  O'er the still senses of the sleeping Maid  Her nightly Visitant her faithful Guide  Descends in all her Empyrean pride  That Fairy shape no more she deigns to wear  Whose light foot smooths the furrow plough'd by care  In mortal faces while her tiny spear  Gives a kind tingle to the caution'd ear  Now in her nobler shape of heavenly size  She strikes her votary's soul with new surprize  Jove's favourite daughter arm'd in all his powers  Appear'd less brilliant to th' attending Hours  When on the golden car of Juno rais'd  In heavenly pomp the Queen of Battles blaz'd  With all her lustre but without the dread  Which from her arm the frowning Gorgon shed  SOPHROSYNE descends with guardian Love  To waft her gentle Ward to worlds above  From her fair brow a radiant diadem  Rose in twelve stars and every separate gem  Shot magic rays of virtue to controul  Some passion hostile to the human soul  Round her sweet form a robe of aether flow'd  And in a wonderous car the smiling Spirit rode  Firm as pure ivory it charm'd the sight  With finer polish and a softer white  The hand of Beauty with an easy swell  Scoop'd the free concave like a bending shell  And on its rich exterior Art display'd  The triumphs of the Power the car convey'd  Here in celestial tints surpassing life  Sate lovely Gentleness disarming Strife  There young Affection born of tender Thought  In rosy chains the fiercer Passions caught  Ambition with his sceptre snapt in twain  And Avarice scorning what his chests contain  Round the tame Vulture flies the fearless Dove  Soft Innocence embraces playful Love  And laughing Sport the frolic Child of Air  Buries in flowers the sinking form of Care  These figures pencil'd with a touch so light  That every image seem'd an heavenly Sprite  Breathe on the car whose sightenchanting frame  Four wheels sustain of pale and purple flame  For no fleet animals to earth unknown  Bear thro' aetherial fields this flying throne  As by the subtle electrician's skill  Globes seem to fly obedient to his will  So these four circles of instinctive fire  Move by the impulse of their Queen's desire  Mount or descend by her directing care  Or rest supported by the buoyant air  Now springing from her car that hovering staid  High in the chamber of the sleeping Maid  The Goddess with a voice divinely clear  Breath'd these kind accents in her Votary's ear  "Come my fair Champion who so well hast fought  "The useful battles of contentious Thought  "To aid thy gentle spirit to sustain  "The final conflict of thy destin'd pain  "View the rewards that in my realms of bliss  "Wait the sweet Victor in such war as this  "So haply may thy mind with strength renew'd  "The dark devices of the Fiend elude  "By one blest effort seal thy triumphs past  "And gain thy promis'd guerdon in the last"  As thus she spake her heavenly arms embrac'd  And in the car the conscious Maiden plac'd  Quick at her wish the flaming wheels ascend  No clouds impede them wheresoe'er they bend  As thro' the empire of the winds they rush'd  The winds were all in mute submission hush'd  And now SERENA from th' exalted car  Look'd down astonish'd on each sinking star  Flying o'er lucid orbs whose distant light  Yet has not reach'd the scope of human sight  And now not distant from the bounds of Space  The guardian Sprite suspends their rapid race  And while in deep amaze the Nymph admires  The circling meteors' inoffensive fires  Pleas'd at her wonder the mild Power addrest  With kind intelligence her earthly guest  "Of those three Orbs that in yon chrystal sphere  "A separate system in themselves appear  "The last whose luminous and steady form  "Shines softly bright and moderately warm  "Contains my palace and the gentle train  "Whom I have wafted to this pure domain  "At equal distance my dominions lie  "From these two larger worlds more near thine eye  "Observe their difference as our wheels advance  "And passing take of each a transient glance"  So speaking to the grosser globe she sprung  Her car suspended o'er its surface hung  In heavy air for round this orb was roll'd  A circling vapour dull and damp and cold  "Here" says SOPHROSYNE "those Beings dwell  "Who wanted soul to act or ill or well  "Who saunter'd thoughtless thro' their mortal time  "Without a Care a Virtue or a Crime  "Here still they saunter in this languid scene  "But pass the dozing crowd and mark their Queen"  And now slow riding on a Tortoise' back  Her features lifeless and each fibre slack  Full in their view the Nymph Indifference came  The quick SERENA soon perceiv'd her name  For as in solemn creeping state she rode  In her lax hand she held fair GREVILLE's Ode  Ne'er did the Muse from her sweet treasure cull  Incense so precious for a Power so dull  Still as she mov'd along her even way  The heavy Goddess try'd to read the lay  But at each pause her inattentive eye  Stray'd from the paper which she held awry  Nor could her lips a single line repeat  Tho' the soft Verse most ravishingly sweet  Thro' Time's dull ear will lasting pleasure spread  And charm the poppy from Oblivion's head  Thus like a City Mayor whose heavy barge  Steers its dull progress at the public charge  This Power so cumber'd by her empire's weight  Makes her slow circuit round her sluggish state  Around her tribes of rambling Sceptics crawl  Tho' moving dubious if they move at all  Before her languid Pomp her Marshal creeps  Whose hand her banner half unfolded keeps  Its quaint device her dull dominion spoke  An Eagle numb'd by the Torpedo's stroke  "Enough of scenes so foreign to thy soul"  SOPHROSYNE exclaim'd "from this dark goal  "Pass we to regions opposite to this"  She spoke and darting o'er the wide abyss  Her car like lightning in soft flashes hurl'd  Shot to the confines of a clearer world  Now lovelier views the Virgin's mind absorb  For now they hover'd o'er a lucid orb  Here the soft air luxuriantly warm  Imparts new lustre to SERENA's form  Her eyes with more expressive radiance speak  And richer roses open on her cheek  Here as she gaz'd she felt in every vein  A blended thrill of pleasure and of pain  Yet every object opening to her view  Her quick regard with soft attraction drew  SOPHROSYNE who saw the gentle Fair  Lean o'er these confines with peculiar care  Smil'd at the tender interest she display'd  And spoke regardful of the pensive Maid  "Well may'st thou bend o'er this congenial sphere  "For Sensibility is Sovereign here  "Thou seest her train of sprightly damsels sport  "Where the soft Spirit holds her rural court  "But fix thine eye attentive to the plain  "And mark the varying wonders of her reign"  As thus she spoke she pois'd her airy seat  High o'er a plain exhaling every sweet  For round its precincts all the flowers that bloom  Fill'd the delicious air with rich perfume  And in the midst a verdant throne appear'd  In simplest form by graceful Fancy rear'd  And deck'd with flowers not such whose flaunting dyes  Strike with the strongest tint our dazzled eyes  But those wild herbs that tenderest fibres bear  And shun th' approaches of a damper air  Here stood the lovely Ruler of the scene  And Beauty more than Pomp announc'd the Queen  The bending Snowdrop and the Briarrose  The simple circle of her crown compose  Roses of every hue her robe adorn  Except th' insipid Rose without a thorn  Thro' her thin vest her heighten'd beauties shine  For earthly gauze was never half so fine  Of that enchanting age her figure seems  When smiling Nature with the vital beams  Of vivid Youth and Pleasure's purple flame  Gilds her accomplish'd work the Female frame  With rich luxuriance tender sweetly wild  And just between the Woman and the Child  Her fair left arm around a vase she flings  From which the tender plant Mimosa springs  Towards its leaves o'er which she fondly bends  The youthful Fair her vacant hand extends  With gentle motion anxious to survey  How far the feeling fibres own her sway  The leaves as conscious of their Queen's command  Successive fall at her approaching hand  While her soft breast with pity seems to pant  And shrinks at every shrinking of the plant  Around their Sovereign on the verdant ground  Sweet airy Forms in mystic measures bound  The mighty master of the revel Love  In notes more soothing than his mother's Dove  Prompts the soft strain that melting virgins sing  Or sportive trips around the frolic ring  Coupling with radiant wreaths of lambent fire  Fair fluttering Hope and rapturous Desire  Unnumber'd damsels different charms display  Pensive with bliss or in their pleasures gay  And the wide prospect yields one touching sight  Of tender yet diversified delight  But the bright triumphs of their joy to check  In the clear air there hangs a dusky speck  It swellsit spreadsand rapid as it grows  O'er the gay scene a chilling shadow throws  The soft SERENA who beheld its flight  Suspects no evil from a cloud so light  For harmless round her the thin vapours wreath  Not hiding from her view the scene beneath  But ah too soon with Pity's tender pain  She saw its dire effect o'er all the plain  Sudden from thence the sounds of Anguish flow  And Joy's sweet carols end in shrieks of woe  The wither'd flowers are fall'n that bloom'd so fair  And poison all the pestilential air  From the rent earth dark Demons force their way  And make the sportive revellers their prey  Here gloomy Terror with a shadowy rope  Seems like a Turkish Mute to strangle Hope  There jealous Fury drowns in blood the fire  That sparkled in the eye of young Desire  And lifeless Love lets merciless Despair  From his crush'd frame his bleeding pinions tear  But pangs more cruel more intensely keen  Wound and distract their sympathetic Queen  With fruitless tears she o'er their misery bends  From her sweet brow the thorny Rose she rends  And bow'd by Grief's insufferable weight  Frantic she curses her immortal state  The soft SERENA as this curse she hears  Feels her bright eye suffus'd with kindred tears  And her kind breast where quick compassion swell'd  Shar'd in each bitter suffering she beheld  The guardian Power survey'd her lovely grief  And spoke in gentle terms of mild relief  "For this soft tribe thy heaviest fear dismiss  "And know their pains are transient as their bliss  "Rapture and Agony in Nature's loom  "Have form'd the changing tissue of their doom  "Both interwoven with so nice an art  "No power can tear the twisted threads apart  "Yet happier these to Nature's heart more dear  "Than the dull offspring in the torpid sphere  "Where her warm wishes and affections kind  "Lose their bright current in the stagnant mind  "Here grief and joy so suddenly unite  "That anguish serves to sublimate delight"  She spoke and ere SERENA could reply  The vapour vanish'd from the lucid sky  The Nymphs revive the shadowy Fiends are fled  The newborn flowers a richer fragrance shed  The gentle Ruler of the changeful land  Smiling resum'd her symbol of command  Replac'd the roses of her regal wreath  Still trembling at the thorns that lurk beneath  But to her wounded subjects quick to pay  The tender duties of imperial sway  Their wants she succour'd they her wish obey'd  And all recover'd by alternate aid  While on the lovely Queen's enchanting face  Departed Sorrow's faint and fainter trace  Gave to each touching charm a more attractive grace  Now laughing Sport from the enlighten'd plain  Clear'd with quick foot the vestiges of Pain  The gay scene grows more beautifully bright  Than when it first allur'd SERENA's sight  Still her fond eyes o'er all the prospect range  Flashing sweet pleasure at the blissful change  Her curious thoughts with fond attachment burn  Yet more of this engaging land to learn  She finds the chief attendants of the Queen  Sweet Females wafted from our human scene  But as it chanc'd while all the realm reviv'd  A Spirit masculine from earth arriv'd  Two airy guides conduct the gentle Shade  Genius in robes of braided flames array'd  And a fantastic Nymph in manners nice  Profusely deck'd with many an odd device  Sister of him whose luminous attire  Flashes with unextinguishable fire  Like him in features in her look as wild  And Singularity by mortals styl'd  The eager Queen and all her smiling Court  Surround the welcome Shade in gentle sport  For in their new associate all rejoice  All pant to hear the accents of his voice  Tho' o'er his frame th' Armenian robe was flung  The pleasing Stranger spoke the Gallic tongue  But in that language his enchanting art  Inspir'd new energy that seiz'd the heart  In terms so eloquent so sweetly bold  A story of disastrous love he told  Convuls'd with sympathy the list'ning train  At every pause with dear delicious pain  Intreat him to renew the fascinating strain  And now SERENA with suspended breath  Listen'd and caught the tale of JULIA's death  And quick she cries ere tears had time to flow  "Blest be this hour for now I see ROUSSEAU"  Fondly she gaz'd till the inchanting sound  In such a potent spell her spirit bound  That lost in sweet illusion she forgot  The promis'd scenes of the sublimer spot  Till now her mild Remembrancer whose care  Stray'd not a moment from the mortal Fair  Rous'd her rapt mind preparing her to meet  The brighter wonders of her blissful seat  While her instinctive car's obedient frame  Now upward rose like undulating flame  As when some victor on the watery world  Bright honour gilding all his sails unfurl'd  Steers into port while to the laughing sky  His streamers tell his triumph as they fly  Expecting thousands line the crowded strand  Swell the glad voice or wave the joyous hand  Pressing to view the sight their vows implor'd  And hail their glory and their strength restor'd  So the blest Beings of this smiling scene  Flock'd round the car of their returning Queen  The radiant car from which they now alight  Careful she gives to a selected Sprite  A Nymph of snowy vest and lovely frame  Fidelity her fair and spotless name  Then happy to review her hallow'd home  Leads her sweet Guest to her celestial dome  Gentlest of Powers for every purpose fit  To strengthen Wisdom and embellish Wit  Thou whose soft arts possess'd by thee alone  Can give to Virtue's voice a sweeter tone  Allay the frost of Age or fire of Youth  And lend attraction to severest Truth  Improve e'en Beauty by thy graceful ease  Or teach Deformity herself to please  Inspire the Bard whose just ambition pants  To guide weak mortals to thy heavenly haunts  Grant him in notes that like thy soft controul  Allure attention and possess the soul  Grant him to shew in luminous display  The mystic wonders of thy secret sway  Now at the sight of the presiding Power  Wide spread the gates of a stupendous tower  On whose firm height commanding Nature's bound  The faithful warder of the fort they found  Wakeful Intelligence a trusty Sprite  Whose eyes are piercing as the solar light  And ever on the watch to sound alarm  If aught of dusky hue portending harm  Should in defiance of her mandate dare  Approach the palace of th' imperial Fair  Within his ward magnificently great  Lies the rich armoury that guards her state  Here stands Conviction's strong and lucid spear  Whose touch annihilates Suspense and Fear  Here Truth's unsullied adamantine shield  Which save SOPHROSYNE no Power can wield  And Reason's trenchant blade of blazing steel  Its edge and polish form'd by friendly Zeal  And not less sure their destin'd mark to hit  Pointed by Virtue's hand the shafts of Wit  And Ridicule's strong bolt whose stunning blow  Lays towering Vice and fearless Folly low  Here too the Goddess kept in mystic state  Those sweet rewards that on her champions wait  Guerdons more precious than triumphant palms  The glance of Gratitude for mental alms  Peace's soft kiss and Reconcilement's tear  And smiles of Sympathy are treasur'd here  These precincts past now hand in hand they came  To the rich fabric of majestic frame  Instant with joy their Sovereign to behold  The gates of massive adamant unfold  And as the gentlymoving valves unclose  Mysterious music from their motion flows  The airy notes thro' all the palace roam  And dulcet echoes fill the festive dome  A gorgeous hall amaz'd SERENA's eyes  Compar'd to which in splendor strength and size  The noblest works of which Tradition sings  Judaic shrine or seat of Memphian kings  Would seem more humble than the waxen cell  In which the skilful Bee is proud to dwell  Here sits a Power in whose angelic face  Beauty is sweeten'd by maternal grace  Her radiant seat surpassing mortal art  Supports an emblem of her liberal heart  A Pelican who rears her callow brood  And from her vitals seems to draw their food  Around this Spirit flock a filial host  Who bless her empire and her guidance boast  Here every Science all the Arts attend  In her they hail their parent and their friend  Each to her presence brings the happy few  Whose dearest glory from her favour grew  Here in her simple charms with youthful fire  Proud to display the magic of her lyre  Soulsoothing Harmony presents her band  Beside her Orpheus and Amphion stand  Here mild Philosophy whose thoughtful frown  Is sweetly shaded by her olive crown  In all her attic elegance array'd  Strong to convince and gentle to persuade  To her whose breath inspir'd his every rule  Leads the blest Sire of the Socratic school  Each animating Bard and moral Sage  The heaventaught minds of every clime and age  Who soften'd manners and refin'd the soul  Flock to this presence as to Glory's goal  And as the mother's heart that yearns to bless  The rival innocents that round her press  Delights to see them as her love they share  Sport in her sight and flourish by her care  Fondly responsive to their every call  Tender of each and provident for all  So this sweet Image of Celestial Grace  Who sits encircled by her lovely race  To every Science vital strength imparts  And rears the circle of the Social Arts  With such solicitude she gives to each  Pow'rs of sublimer aim and wider reach  And now SOPHROSYNE who near her prest  Thus spoke her title to her earthly guest  "Behold the honour'd Form without whose aid  "My strength must vanish and my glory fade  "Source of my being and my life's support  "EUNOIA call'd in this celestial Court  "BENEVOLENCE the name she bears on earth  "The guard of Weakness and the friend of Worth"  She ended and the mild maternal Form  Embrac'd SERENA with a smile as warm  As the gay spirit Vegetation wears  When she to crown her favourite Nymph prepares  When pleas'd her flowery treasures to display  She pours them in the lap of youthful May  But how SERENA how may human speech  Thy heavenly raptures in this moment reach  If aught of earthly sentiment may vie  With the pure joy these happy scenes supply  'Tis when unmixt with trouble and with pain  Love glides in secret thro' the glowing vein  When some fond Youth unconscious of its fire  Free from chill Fear and turbulent Desire  With every thought absorb'd in soft delight  Sees all creation in his Fair one's sight  And feels a blissful state without a name  Repose of soul with harmony of frame  So plung'd in pleasure of the purest kind  SERENA gaz'd on the maternal Mind  Gaz'd till SOPHROSYNE's directing aid  Thus summon'd to new sights th' obedient Maid  "Haste my fair Charge for of this ample state  "Tracts yet unseen thy visitation wait  "The pressing hours forbid me to unfold  "Each separate province which these confines hold  "But I will lead thee to that blissful crew  "Whose kindred spirits best deserve thy view"  So speaking her attentive Guest she led  Thro' scenes that still increasing wonder bred  Where'er she trod thro' all her gorgeous seat  Soft music echoed from beneath her feet  Passing a portal on whose lucid stone  Emblems of Innocence and Beauty shone  They reach a lawn with verdant lustre bright  And view the bowers of permanent delight  No fiery Sun here forms a scorching noon  No baleful Meteor gleams no chilling Moon  But from a latent source one soothing light  Whose constant rays repel the mist of night  Tho' tender chearful and tho' warm serene  Gives lasting beauty to the lovely scene  No sensual thought this paradise profanes  For here tried Excellence in triumph reigns  Benignant cares eternal joy supply  And bliss angelic beams in every eye  "In yon' three groups" the leading Spirit cried  "My fav'rite Females see my fairest pride  "The first in rank is that distinguish'd train  "Whose strength of soul was tried by Hymen's chain  "Tho' Beauty blest their form and Love their guide  "Their nuptial band with happiest omens tied  "Beauty and Love they felt may lose the art  "To fix inconstant Man's eccentric heart  "Yet conscious of their Lord's neglected vow  "No Virtue frown'd outrageous on their brow  "To keep returning Tenderness aloof  "By coarse upbraiding and despis'd reproof  "With Sorrow smother'd in Attraction's smile  "They strove the sense of misery to beguile  "And from wild Passion's perilous abyss  "Lure the lost wanderer back to faithful bliss  "See mild OCTAVIA o'er this band preside  "Voluptuous ANTONY's neglected bride  "Whose feeling heart with all a Mother's care  "Rear'd the young offspring of a rival Fair  "Far other trials rais'd yon lovely crew  "Tho' in connubial scenes their merit grew  "It was their chance ere judgment was mature  "When glittering toys the infant mind allure  "Following their parents' avaricious rule  "To wed with hopes of bliss a wealthy fool  "When Time remov'd Delusion's veil by stealth  "And shew'd the drear vacuity of wealth  "When sad Experience prov'd the bitter fate  "Of Beauty coupled to a senseless Mate  "These gentle Wives still gloried to submit  "These tho' invited by alluring Wit  "Refus'd in paths of lawless joy to range  "Nor murmur'd at the lot they could not change  "But with a lively sweetness unopprest  "By a dull Husband's lamentable jest  "Their constant rays of gay goodhumour spread  "A guardian glory round their idiot's head  "The next in order are those lovely Forms  "Whose patience weather'd all paternal storms  "By filial cares the mind's unfailing test  "Well have they earn'd these seats of blissful rest  "They unrepining at severe restraint  "Peevish commands and undeserv'd complaint  "Bent with unwearied kindness to appease  "Each fancied want of querulous Disease  "Gave up those joys which youthful hearts engage  "To watch the weakness of parental age  "Such are these gentle tribes the happy few  "Who share the triumph to their victory due  "Angelic aims their spotless minds employ  "And fill their measure of unchequer'd joy  "Behold where some with generous ardor wait  "Around yon Seer who holds the book of Fate  "Those aweful leaves with eager glance they turn  "Thence with celestial zeal they fondly learn  "What dangers threaten thro' the vale of earth  "Their kindred pilgrims ere they rise to birth  "To earth they still invisibly descend  "In that dark scene congenial minds defend  "From Pleasure's Bud drive Spleen's corroding worm  "And in my votaries' heart my power confirm  "Delights more calm yon listening band employ  "Who deeply drink of intellectual joy  "See them around that speaking Nymph rejoice  "Their pleasures varying with her varied voice  "What graces in the sweet enthusiast glow  "Repeating here whate'er she learns below  "Memory her name her charge o'er earth to flit  "And cull the fairest flowers of human wit  "Whatever Genius in his happiest hour  "Has penn'd of moral grace and comic power  "To warm the heart the spells of Spleen unbind  "And pour gay sunshine o'er the misty mind  "Teach men to cherish their fraternal tie  "And view kind Nature with a filial eye  "This active Spirit catches in her flight  "Skill'd to retain and happy to recite  "Here she delivers each bright work and each  "Derives new beauty from her graceful speech  "Warpt by no envy by no love misled  "Equal she holds the living and the dead  "Alike rehearsing as they claim their turn  "The song of ANSTEY and the tale of STERNE  "But Morning calls thee henceYet one scene more  "My fostering love shall lead thee to explore  "This thy last sight with careful eyes survey  "And mark th' extensive nature of my sway"  Thus with fond zeal the guardian Spirit said  And to new precincts of her palace led  The scene she enter'd of her richest state  Where on her voice the subject Passions wait  Here rose a throne of living gems so bright  No breath could sully their benignant light  This her immortal seat the gracious Guide  Assum'd her Ward stood wondering at her side  Swist as they felt their ruling Power inthron'd  Aetherial Beings who her empire own'd  Crowded in glittering pomp the gorgeous scene  To pay their homage to their heavenly Queen  First came chaste Love whose sweet harmonious form  Ne'er felt Suspicion's soulconvulsing storm  No baleful arrow in his quiver lies  No blinding veil enwraps his sparkling eyes  There all the rays of varied joy unite  And jointly shed unspeakable delight  With him was Friendship like a virgin drest  The soft Asbestos form'd her simple vest  Whose wond'rous folds in fiercest flames entire  Mock the vain ravage of consuming fire  Around this robe a mystic chain she wore  Each golden link a star of diamonds bore  Force could not tear the finish'd work apart  Nor Int'rest loose it by his subtlest art  But strange to tell if the presiding Power  Who to her Favourite gave this precious dower  If kind SOPHROSYNE could fail to breathe  Her vital virtue on this magic wreath  The parts must sever faithless to their trust  The gold grow dross and every diamond dust  These Valour follow'd deck'd with verdant palm  Gracefully bold majestically calm  A mingled troop succeed with festive sound  Wisdom with olive Wit with feathers crown'd  Here hand in hand they move no longer foes  Their charms encreasing as their union grows  Pure Spirits all who hating mental strife  Exalt creation and embellish life  All here attend and in their Sovereign's praise  Their circling forms the song of glory raise  The blest SERENA drinks with ravish'd ear  The melting music of the tuneful sphere  Now in its close the soothing echoes roll  O'er her rapt fancy and intrance her soul  Her senses sink in soft Oblivion's bands  Till faithful Jenny at her pillow stands  Recalls each mental and corporeal power  While she proclaims aloud the passing hour  And in a voice expressive of surprize  Too shrill to seem the music of the skies  Informs the startled Fair 'tis time to rise  END OF THE FIFTH CANTO  CANTO VI  BLEST be the heart of sympathetic mould  Whatever form that gentle heart infold  Whose generous fibres with fond terror shake  When keen Affliction threatens to o'ertake  Young artless Beauty as alarm'd she strays  Thro' the strange windings of this mortal maze  To such SERENA be thy story known  Whose bosom best can make thy lot their own  And kindly sharing in thy trials past  Attend with sweet anxiety the last  The hour approaches the tremendous hour  In whose dark moments deeper perils lower  Still so enwrapt in Pleasure's gay disguise  They lurk invisible to Caution's eyes  And unsuspected by the Fair one wait  To cancel or confirm her blissful fate  Her lively mind with bright ideas stor'd  She takes her station at the Breakfastboard  Still her soft soul the heavenly Vision fills  And sweeter graces in her smile instills  New hopes of triumph glide thro' every nerve  And arm her glowing heart with firm reserve  Conscious the final trying chance impends  To bear its force her every power she bends  In her quick thought ambitious to presage  How Spleen's dark agents may exert their rage  She ponders on what perils may befall  And fondly deems her mind a match for all  Ah lovely Nymph this dangerous pride forego  Pride may betraySecurity's thy foe  While fancied Prudence thus a foreign guest  Sits doubly cherish'd in SERENA's breast  Behold a billet her attention steal  No common arms compose its ample seal  Th' unfolding paper breathes a roseate scent  Sweet harbinger of joy its kind intent  Of courteous FILLIGREE it bears the name  Clear symptom of the Peer's increasing flame  The gracious Earl lamenting pleasure lost  And fair SERENA in her wishes crost  Has plann'd in honour of the lovely Maid  A fancied Ball a private Masquerade  And supplicates her Sire with warm esteem  To smile indulgent on the festive scheme  All arts he uses to insure the grant  Nor leaves unask'd the eager maiden Aunt  Quick at the sound SERENA's glowing heart  Throbs with gay hopes but soon those hopes depart  Reflection in her soul a faithful guard  The opening avenues of pleasure barr'd  She deem'd the plan of this delightful shew  But the new ambush of her secret foe  The bliss too bright to realize she guess'd  And chas'd th' idea from her guarded breast  While these discreet resolves her thought employ  Tranquil she triumphs o'er her smother'd joy  Not so the Knightto his parental eyes  In dazzling pomp delusive visions rise  That Coronet the object of his vow  He sees suspended o'er his daughter's brow  Eager he burns to snap the pendent thread  And fix the glory on his Darling's head  Far wiser aims the ancient Maiden caught  No empty gewgaw flutters in her thought  But while more keenly she applauds the plan  Her hope is solid and substantial Man  Not for her infant Niece whose baby frame  She holds unfit for Hymen's holy flame  But for her riper self whose strength may bear  The heaviest burden of connubial care  Tho' different Phantoms dance before their sight  Niece Aunt and Father in one wish unite  To join the banquet is their common choice  The business past with no dissenting voice  And the warm Sire in whom ambition burn'd  A note of grateful courtesy return'd  His billet seal'd the glad goodhumour'd Knight  Launch'd forth like Nestor on his youthful might  "O could I now in spite of age retain  "That active vigour and that sprightly vein  "Which led me once the lively laugh to raise  "Among the merrier Wits of former days  "When rival Beauties would around me throng  "And gay Ridottos listen to my song  "Such were I now as on the festive night  "When Chh's charms amaz'd the public sight  "When the kind Fair one in a veil so thin  "That the clear gauze was but a lighter skin  "Mask'd like a Virgin just prepar'd to die  "Gave her plump beauties to each greedy eye  "On that fam'd night for then with frolic fire  "Youth fill'd my heart and Humour strung my lyre  "Pleas'd in the sunshine of her smile to bask  "I danc'd around her in a Devil's mask  "And idly chaunted an infernal ode  "In praise of all this Female tempter shew'd  "The jocund crowd who throng'd with me to gaze  "Extoll'd my unpremeditated lays  "And Sport who still of this old revel brags  "    See Nestor's Speech in the th Iliad  Styl'd her the first of Maids and me of Wags  "Then a light Devil now reduc'd to limp  "I am but fit to play the hagborn Imp  "Still not to cross the frolic of this Ball  "Still as the Tortoise Caliban I'll crawl  "And if with Gout my burning ankles flinch  "I'll call it Prospero's tormenting pinch  "Still in this shape I'll shew them what I am  "And PEN shall go as Sycorax my dam"  So spoke the Knight and spoke with so much weight  The listening Females saw his word was fate  For ne'er did Jove with so resolv'd a brow  To smiling Love his joyous scheme avow  When he concerted for his special mirth  A masquerading on the stage of earth  And of the Swan's soft plume or Bull's rough hair  Order'd the Fancydress he chose to wear  From whence let sapient Antiquarians shew  The ancient use of Masquerades below  SERENA smil'd to see this joyous fire  Infuse new youth in her determin'd Sire  But mute PENELOPE with half a sigh  "With one auspicious and one dropping eye"  Heard the firm Knight his fixt resolve impart  Tickling at once and torturing her heart  The Ball she relish'd but abhorr'd the task  To hide her beauties in a Beldam's mask  Miranda's name would better suit her plan  A simple Maiden not afraid of Man  But us'd alas her Brother's law to feel  She knows that law admits not of repeal  Trusting her charms will any garb enrich  She deigns to take the habit of a Witch  Never did Sorceress in the shades of night  Try to illuminate a filthy Sprite  With fonder efforts or with worse success  Than PEN now labour'd in this wayward dress  To give the sprightly shew of living truth  To the poor ghost of her departed youth  As Witches o'er their magic cauldron bend  Anxious to see their menial Imps ascend  So in her glass the ancient Maiden pries  And dreams new graces in her person rise  No such delights whose dear delusions please  The mild SERENA in her mirror sees  She at whose toilet Beauty's latent Queen  Attends enchanted with her filial mien  And o'er her Favourite's unconscious face  Breathes her own roseate glow and vivid grace  She hastes her glittering garments to adjust  With all the modest charms of sweet distrust  Doubting that beauty which she doubts alone  Which dazzles every eye except her own  The native diffidence which sway'd her mind  Now feels new terrors with its own combin'd  The robes of Ariel to the Nymph recall  Those disappointments that may yet befall  As her fair hands the gauze or tissue touch  They fondly warn her not to hope too much  She feels the friendly counsel they impart  And Caution reigns protector of her heart  The fateful evening comesthe coach attends  And first the gouty Caliban ascends  Then in Deformity's wellsuited pride  Sour Sycorax is station'd by his side  And last with sportive smiles divinely sweet  Light Ariel perches on the vacant seat  Fancy now paints the scene of pleasure near  Yet fluttering Gaiety is check'd by Fear  Her wish to view the festive sight runs high  But the fond Nymph remembers with a sigh  From Hope's keen hand the cup of joy may slip  And fall untasted tho' it reach the lip  As the fine Artist whose nice toils aspire  To fame eternal by encaustic fire  If he with grief has seen the faithless heat  Marr the rich labour it should make compleat  When next his hands with trembling care confide  To the fierce element his pencil's pride  Watches unceasing the pernicious flame  Terror and Hope contending in his frame  While his fair work the dangerous fire sustains  Feels it in all his sympathetic veins  And at each trivial sound that Chance may cause  Hears the Gem crack and sees its cruel flaws  With such solicitude the panting Maid  Past the long street of every noise afraid  Now while around her rival flambeaus flare  And the coach rattles thro' the crowded square  She fears some dire mischance must yet befall  Some Demon snatch her from the promis'd Ball  And dreams no trial more severe than this  So bright she figures the new scene of bliss  Yet horrid as it seems her heart is bent  To bear e'en this and bear it with content  But whirl'd at length within the Porter's gate  She thinks what perils at the Ball may wait  And as she now alights the fluttering Fair  Invokes her Guardian to protect her there  Till thoughts of danger thoughts of caution fly  Before the magic blaze that meets her eye  Th' advancing Nymph at every step she takes  Pants with amazement doubtful if she wakes  Far as her eyes the glittering scene command  'Tis all enchantment all a Fairy land  No vestiges of modern pomp appear  No modern melody salutes her ear  With Moorish notes the echoing mansion rings  And its transmuted form to Fancy brings  The rich  See the Views of this Palace in Swinburn's Travels  Alhambra of the Moorish kings  The Peer who keenly thirsts for Fashion's praise  To gild his revel with

keenly bent on her pernicious task  Has shifted round the Ball from mask to mask  Watching the moment with infernal care  To form with deepest art her final snare  And manacle the mind of the unguarded Fair  It comes the moment that must fix her lot  By her ah thoughtless Maid by her forgot  Tho' the light Hours e'en in their frolic ring  Trembling perceive the fearful chance they bring  And shuddering at the Nymph's terrific state  Seem anxious to suspend her doubtful fate  Now social Ease the place of Sport supplied  The hot oppressive mask was thrown aside  And Beauty shone reveal'd in all her blushing pride  Superior still in features as in form  With admiration flush'd with pleasure warm  The gay SERENA every eye allur'd  The hearts her figure won her face secur'd  A tender sweetness still the Nymph maintain'd  And Modesty o'er all her graces reign'd  Well might her soul to brilliant hopes incline  A thousand Youths had call'd her charms divine  A thousand friends had whisper'd in her ear  That Fate had mark'd her for the festive Peer  Her youthful fancy tho' by pomp amus'd  Wish'd not those offers which her heart refus'd  That tender heart by no vain pride possest  With indecisive trembling shook her breast  Like a young bird that fluttering in the air  Wishes to build her nest yet knows not where  The busy Earl his puny love to raise  Hunted the circling whisper of her praise  Heard Envy own her lovely charms tho' loth  Heard Taste attest them with a modish oath  And nuptial projects thickening in his mind  Now his fair partner in the dance rejoin'd  As now the sprightly music paus'd my Lord  Eager resolv'd to touch a softer chord  Secure of all repulse he vainly meant  Half to display half hide his fond intent  And in dissembled Passion's flowery tropes  To sport at leisure with the Virgin's hopes  For this he fram'd a motley speech replete  With amorous compliment and vain conceit  The labour'd nothing with complacent pride  He spoke but to his speech no Nymph replied  For in the moment the lost Fair devotes  Her willing ear to more attractive notes  The Minstrel happen'd near the Nymph to walk  Rapt with a bosomfriend in secret talk  And at the instant when the Earl began  Half to unfold his matrimonial plan  EDWIN in whispers from the crowd retir'd  Chanc'd to repeat the Sonnet she inspir'd  The sounds tho' faint her recollection caught  Drew her quick eye and fixt her wondering thought  Lost in this sweet surprize she could not hear  A single accent of the amorous Peer  Spleen saw the moment that she sought to gain  And perch'd triumphant on the Noble's brain  With jealous Envy stung and baffled Pride  "Contemptuous Girl" with sudden rage he cried  "If here to happier Youths thy views incline  "I want not fairer Nymphs who challenge mine  "Thy breast in vain with penitence may burn  "But once neglected I no more return"  Thus loudly speaking with distemper'd heat  Rudely he turn'd with rancorous scorn replete  SERENA startled at th' injurious sound  Survey'd th' insulting Peer who sternly frown'd  Shame and resentment thro' her bosom rush  Swell every vein and raise the burning blush  Love newborn Love but in its birth conceal'd  Nor to the Nymph herself as yet reveal'd  And just Disdain and Anger's honest flame  With complicated power convulse her frame  Contending passions every thought confound  And in tumultuous doubt her soul is drown'd  Now treacherous Pride who tempts her tongue to trip  Forms to a keen reply her quivering lip  Insidious Spleen now hovers o'er the Fair  Deems her half lock'd within her hateful snare  In her new slave preparing to rejoice  To taint her spirit and untune her voice  Hapless SERENA what can save thee now  The Fiend's dark signet stamps thy clouded brow  In thy swoln eye I see the starting drop  This fatal shower aetherial Guardian stop  Haste to thy votary haste her soul sustain  Nor let the trials she has past be vain  Ah me while yet I speak with shuddering dread  I hear the magic Girdle's bursting thread  This horrid omen ye kind Powers avert  Nor thou bright Zone thy brighter Charge desert  Ah fruitless prayer her panting breast behold  See the gauze shakes in many a ruffled fold  Forc'd from their station by her heaving heart  From the strain'd Girdle thrice three spangles start  Thro' her disorder'd dress a pass they've found  And fallen see they glitter on the ground  O blessed chance with liferecalling light  The glittering monitors attract her sight  Like stars emerging from the darken'd pole  They sparkle safety to her harrass'd soul  See from her brow the clouds of trouble fly  Vexation's tear is vanish'd from her eye  Her rosy cheeks with Joy's soft radiance burn  Like Nature smiling at the Sun's return  The Nymph no more with mental darkness blind  Shines the sweet Ruler of her rescu'd mind  Hence hateful Spleen thy fancied prize resign  Renounce for ever what shall ne'er be thine  For conscious of her airy Guardian's aid  She feels new spirit thro' her heart convey'd  And inly blessing this victorious hour  Her soul exults in its recover'd power  In such mild terms she hails th' insulting Peer  As Spleen if mortal must expire to hear  But driven for ever from the lovely Girl  The foul Fiend riots in the captive Earl  He answers not but with a sullen air  On happier EDWIN who approach'd the Fair  Darts such a glance of rage and envious hate  As Satan cast on Eden's blissful state  When on our Parents first he fixt his sight  And undelighted gaz'd on all delight  So doom'd to look and doom'd such pangs to feel  Scornful he turn'd on his elastic heel  "O lovely Mildness oh angelic Maid  "Deserving homage tho' to scorn betray'd  "Rise still sweet Spirit rise these wrongs above  "Turn from injurious Pride to faithful Love  "Tho' on my brow no Coronet may shine  "Wealth I can offer at thy beauty's shrine  "And worthier thee a heart that worships thine"  Thus with newkindled Love's aspiring flame  Spoke the fond Youth conceal'd by EDWIN's name  The gallant FALKLAND rich in inborn worth  By Fortune blest and not of abject birth  Warmly he spoke with that indignant heat  With which the generous heart ne'er fails to beat  When Worth insulted wakens virtuous ire  And injur'd Beauty sets the soul on fire  Quick to his voice the startled Virgin turn'd  With wonder hope and joy her bosom burn'd  With sweet confusion flurried and amaz'd  On his attractive form she wildly gaz'd  Full on her thought the friendly visions rush'd  Blushing she view'd him view'd him still and blush'd  And soft Affection quickening at the sight  Perchance had swoon'd with fullness of delight  But that her Father's voice with quick controul  Recall'd the functions of her fainting soul  When on the distant seat where fondly fixt  He view'd the Nymph as in the dance she mixt  He indistinctly heard with wounded ear  The spleenful outrage of the angry Peer  Swift at th' imperfect sound with choler wild  He sprung to succour his insulted Child  But ere his fury into language broke  Love calm'd the storm that Arrogance awoke  The sudden burst of FALKLAND's tender flame  His winning manners his distinguish'd name  His liberal soul by Fortune's smile carest  All join'd to harmonize the Father's breast  His fiery thoughts subside in glad surprize  And to the generous Youth he warmly cries  "Ingenuous FALKLAND by thy frankness won  "My willing heart would own thee as my Son  "But on thy hopes SERENA must decide  "Haste we together from this house of Pride"  So spoke the Sire for to her Votary kind  SOPHROSYNE inspir'd his soften'd mind  Speaking he smil'd to see that on his word  The Lover hung and blest the sounds he heard  That his embarrass'd Child his sentence caught  With each tumultuous sign of tender thought  Whose blushes springing from the heart declare  The dawn of fondness in the modest Fair  Th' enchanted Youth with ecstacy convey'd  Forth from the troubled Feast the trembling Maid  As the keen Sailor whom his daring soul  Has drawn too vent'rous near the freezing pole  Who having slighted Caution's tame advice  Seems wedg'd within impervious worlds of ice  If from each chilling form of peril free  At length he reach the unincumber'd sea  With joy superior to his transient pain  Rushes exulting o'er th' expansive main  Such strong delight SERENA's bosom shar'd  When sweet Reflection to her heart declar'd  That all the trials of her Fate were past  And Love's decisive plaudit seal'd the last  Her airy Guard prepares the softest down  From Peace's wing to line the nuptial crown  Her smiles accelerate the bridal morn  And clear her Votary's path from every thorn  On the quick match the Prude's keen censures fall  Blind to the heavenly Power who guided all  But mild SERENA scorn'd the prudish play  To wound warm Love with frivolous delay  Nature's chaste child not Affectation's slave  The heart she meant to give she frankly gave  Thro' her glad Sire no gouty humours run  Jocund he glories in his destin'd Son  PENELOPE herself no longer seen  In the four semblance of tormenting Spleen  Buys for her Niece the robes of nuptial state  Nor scolds the Mercer once thro' all the long debate  For quick dispatch the honest Man of law  Toils half the night the legal ties to draw  At length th' enraptur'd Youth all forms compleat  Bears his sweet Bride to his paternal feat  On a fair lawn the chearful mansion stood  And high behind it rose a circling wood  As the blest Lord of this extensive reign  Led his dear partner thro' her new domain  With fond surprize SERENA soon descried  A temple rais'd to her aetherial Guide  Its ornaments she view'd with tender awe  Their fashion such as she in vision saw  For the kind Youth her grateful smile to gain  Had from her clear description deck'd the fane  Joyful he cried to his angelic Wife  "Be this kind Power the worship of our life"  He spoke and led her to the inmost shrine  Here link'd in rosy bands two Votaries shine  The pencil had imparted life to each  With energy that seem'd beyond its reach  First stood Connubial Love a manly Youth  Whose bright eye spoke the ardent vows of truth  Friendship sweet smiling fill'd the second place  In all the softer charms of Virgin grace  Their meeting arms a mystic tablet raise  Deck'd with these lines the Moral of my Lays  "VIRTUE's an ingot of Peruvian gold  "SENSE the bright ore Potosi's mines unfold  "But TEMPER's image must their use create  "And give these precious metals sterling weight"  FINIS
