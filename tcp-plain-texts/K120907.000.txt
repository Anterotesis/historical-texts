to a Friend in  London  Ban  y  June  Dear Friend  THis Day a Messenger on a Highflying Sorrel Horse came Post from Dr  S  l  and rode as if the Devil drove him to signifie to our M  y  r  That he designed to visit us  upon which the wild frantick fiery zealous Magistrate summon'd his Brethren the Ald  men to meet at the CommonHall but before they were all Assembled another Messenger brought Advice  That the Champion was just at hand  so that Mr M  y  r and those with him went to the Town's End clad in old fashion'd Formalities to meet him They found him very well guarded by a vast Rabble and Mob crying with loud Acclamations  Nonresistance Nonresistance  Mr M  y  r  c  headed by one that Records Congratulated him upon his Deliverance  c  And then the Publick Entry was ordered as followeth  FIrst came the Bellman and Sexton of the Town with Staves in their Hands  Then Two Pursivants bearing Pendants with the D  r's Crest Pope  Clement  the XI's Head and his Motto in these Words  Ʋnlimited Passive Obedience  Then a Herald carrying his CoatArmour being a Field Sable charged with Three Cardinals Caps each with a Golden Band  Then followed Two Old Women one having a Bundle of Addresses on her Back and a Paper on her Breast with this Inscription  We defie all AntiMonarchial AntiEpiscopal and  almost all  Atheistical and Popish Principles  the other was covered all over with Pamphlets of divers sorts before her was  The Elegy on HighChurch Passive Obedience  and  The Champion pleading his own Cause  but on her Bum the Effigies of  Ben H  y  with his Head downward  Then the Serjeant of the Town with a Mace on his Shoulder  Then came Mr M  y  r with a Book in his Hand upside down according to Custom Intituled  The Perils of False Brethren both in Church and State  Then the Ald  men Two by Two having  The Collections  in their Hands  Here followed a young Damsel  who had a Promise from the  HighC  h Faction  to have any thing she requested  whereupon she desired the Head of  Benj H  which she brought in a  Charger  Then Men with Red Hats having Beads in their Hands with this Inscription on their Foreheads  Nunc aut Nunquam  Then an Old Man with a long Beard clothed in pure white Raiment having the D  r's Effigies in Metzotinto in one Hand and in the other a Trinklet resembling a Cru  fix  Then followed the Old Women with Green Branches in their Hands  Then a Woman preciously deck'd sitting  as near as I could guess  upon a Scarletcolour'd Beast having abundance of Names written in Capital Letters  MYSTERY  c  Then came the HighCh  ch IDOL  in Garments as black as his Deeds  on a Sorrel Horse  After him Tinkers beating on their Kettles that the Spectators might know what Latitude they were in  Then a vast Mob hollowing hooping and playing the Devil  In this Order he was conducted to his Inn where he was again Congratulated and presented with Wine In fine the Evening concluded with Ringing of Bells Bonfires Drunkenness and all manner of Lewdness  The Champion left this Town next Morning and set out for  W  ck  where he was again met and Congratulated by the Monkeys in their Formalities They entreated him to tarry some time with them but he declined it and pursued his Journey to the next Corporation for you must know he expects the same Honours to be paid him whereever he goes which how strange soever it may seem to some is no new thing for he's not the first that has been waited on by a Corporation in their Robes for in the Reign of Q  Eliz  a Fellow who wore his Hat button'd up on one side and a Feather therein like a Toothdrawer with a Rose and Crown on his Breast for a Badge got a License to make a Show of a great  APE  about the Country And coming to a certain Town ☞Whether  Banbury  or not I can't tell they beat a Drum about to give Notice That there was a very witty Ape to be seen but the TownsPeople being poor thought it not worth their while to see this sight upon which the Fellow was enraged and was resolved to put a Trick upon them and thereupon sends the following Warrant to the Worshipful the Mayor  THese are to Require you and every one of you with your Wives and Families upon sight hereof to make your personal Appearance before the Queen's Ape who is a Person of Rank and Quality and of vast Parts he having been bred at an University and is to visit most Parts of the Kingdom that by his Conversation with the Queen's Subjects he may be the better enabled to discover their Fidelity and Loyalty Hereof fail not at your Peril  When Mr Mayor had open'd the Warrant he who always did what he pleas'd holds it topsie turvy and after some thoughts thereon sends his Maid to the further end of the Town for a Shoemaker to come and read it When he heard the Contents he summon'd his Brethren the Aldermen to the TownHall to consult of this weighty Affair where they sat looking on one another for some time not knowing what to say At length the youngest Alderman standing up said  Gentlemen If I may speak without Offence  I'll give you my Opinion in this Matter Speak on  says Mr Mayor  for though you are but a young Officer you may speak as much Sense as any of us Well then  says he  my humble Opinion is That this ApeFellow is a sawcy Knave and only designs to make our Town ridiculous For was it ever known that a Warrant should be sent without either Name or Date to a Mayor of a Town who is the Queen's Lieutenant and that he and his Brethren their Wives and Children should be commanded to appear before a  Jackanapes  My Council is therefore That you take him and his Ape and whip the whole Tribe out of Town which will be much to your Credit and Reputation  The Words were scarce spoke e're a grave Alderman reply'd  Hold Friend you have spoke little less than Treason Remember 'tis the Queen's Ape True Brother  quoth the Mayor  therefore it behoves us to take care what we say in this troublesom Business Marry  says another grave Senior  we may see by the Feather in his Cap and the Badge he wears that he is the Queen's Man and who knows what an Injury he may do us poor Men in the Country for contemning the Warrant therefore let us e'ne go and see the Ape 'tis but  d  apiece and no doubt but the Queen will tak  it well when she hears we have shown so much Reverence to her Ape  Upon this Speech the Assembly resolved to pay the Ape a Visit and ordered the TownClerk to acquaint the Queen's Man therewith  Next Day the Mayor and Aldermen in their Robes  the Serjeant carrying the Mace before them their Recorder being at the Head of them  with whole Droves of Townsmen and their Wives  c attended the Ape at his Inn  where they found him sitting on a Table Mr  Mayor  presented him with Wine  off his Hat and made a Leg but Pag did not mind him Next came Mrs  Mayoress  in a  Apron and made  Pug  a fine low Courtisie upon which he put out his  and made a Mouth  I  quoth she  I think in my Conscience the Queen's Ape mocks me Sirrah  says  the Mayor  I see thy sawciness and I'll make thee to know that the Woman whom thou mockest is my Wife an Ancient Woman and a Midwife and one who is old enough to be thy Mother  And thereupon going to his Tutor  Sir  said he  do you allow your Ape to abuse my Wife No  quoth he  Truly  says the Mayor  there's sufficient witness that saw him make Mops and Mows at her  The Tutor thereupon gave poor  Pug  half a Dozen smart Lashes with his Whip which made his Teeth chatter upon which Mr  Mayor  cried out  Enough Enough Good Sir you have done like a Gentleman I desire you never to give Correction any more in your Wrath And when the Play is done be pleased to come along with your Ape to our TownHall both of you to take a small Supper with me and the rest of my Brethren the Aldermen  But to return to our Champion After he had visited several Corporations and given Audience to the Mob who were wonderfully taken with this new RareeShow he dispatches a Trumpeter to  Cov  ry  to give Notice of his coming The Bells immediately rung for Joy But that avail'd him nothing for the Monkeys did not appear in their Robes which was a great Mortification to him and those of his Faction However he was met by or stiff Sons of  Levi  on Sorrel Nags attended by a few Butchers and Barbers who made a Purse and bought Two Hogsheads of Ale which were set in the Publick Street where the Rabble got shamefully drunk in Toasting a Health to their beloved IDOL  FINIS
