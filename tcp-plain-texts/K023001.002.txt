presume we stand not in need of any more Apology to the  Reader  for  THIS Publication  than we did for the  LAST  for we hereby declare that Mr  POPE    EP PT  and  RS  are  ALL out of the Question  Mr  CURLL  is the sole Editor of this Volume and it  Is  what the former  Was  a  Collection  of what has been printed and a  Compilation  from  Original Manuscripts  but not stollen either from  Twickenham    Wimpole  or  Doverstreet  but at the last Place while Mr  Pope  was dangling and making  Gilliver  and  Cooper  his CabinetCounsel away goes Mr  CURLL  on the th Day of  June  in the Year of our Lord God and by the Assistance of that Celebrated Artist Mr  Rijsbrack  takes a full  View of our Bard's Grotto Subterraneous Way Gardens Statues Inscriptions and his Dog  BOUNCE  An Account of some of them are hereunto subjoined And a  Prospect  of Mr  Pope  's  House  from the  Surrey Side  will be shortly exhibited in a very curious Print engraven by the best Hands  We have not any thing farther to add in this Place Mr  CURLL  himself having opened the Work and fully made good his Promise to the Lords of being a Match for Mr  Pope  in Prose And he may really say in regard to all the Attacks which have been made upon him  by this petulant little Gentleman    especially the last    VENI VIDI VICI  PHILALETHES  LONDINI  Julii Die Natali  TO Mr POPE  SIR  _THAT great Philosopher and Honour of the  English  Nation the Lord Chancellor  Bacon  See his  Essay  on  Deformity  gives it us as his Opinion  'That  Deformed Persons  are commonly  even  with  Nature  for as  Nature  hath done  ill  by them so  do  they by  Nature  being for the most part as the Scripture saith  void of natural Affection  and so they have Revenge of Nature Certainly there is a Consent between the Body and the Mind and where  Nature  erreth in the one she ventureth in the other  Ubi  peccat in uno periclatur in altero  But because there is in Man an Election touching the Frame of his Mind and a Necessity in the Frame of his Body the Stars of natural Inclination are sometimes obscured by the Sun of Discipline and Virtue Therefore it is good to consider  Deformity  not as a Sign which is more deceivable but as a Cause which seldom faileth of the Effect Whosoever hath any thing fixed in his Person that doth induce Contempt hath also a perpetual Spur in himself to rescue and deliver himself from Scorn Therefore all  Deformed Persons  are extreme Bold First in their own Defence as being exposed to Scorn but in Process of Time by a General Habit Also it stirreth in them Industry and especially of this kind to watch and observe the Weakness of others that they may have somewhat to repay Again in their Superiors it quencheth Jealousy towards them as Persons that they think they may at Pleasure despise and it layeth their Competitors and Emulators asleep as never believing they should be in a Possibility of Advancement till they see them in Possession so that upon the Matter in a great Wit  Deformity  is an Advantage to rising Kings in antient Times and at this present in  some Countries were wont to put great Trust in  Eunuchs  because they that are envious towards All are more obnoxious and officious towards One But yet their Trust towards them hath rather been as to good Spyals and good Whisperers than good Magistrates and Officers and much like is the Reason of  Deformed Persons  Still the Ground is they will if they be of Spirit seek to free themselves from Scorn which must be either by Virtue or Malice and therefore let it not be marvelled if sometimes they prove excellent Persons as was  Agesilaus Zanger  the Son of  Solyman Aesop Gasca  President of  Peru  and  Socrates  may go likewise amongst them with others'  His Lordship observes that these Men were Instances of the most exalted Virtue but I wish I was not obliged to say that You are a Precedent of the most depraved Vice For a Demonstration of which I shall regularly proceed  viz  You very well know Sir that in the Year when the  CourtPoems    viz  The  BassetTable  The  Toilet  and The  DrawingRoom  were published upon your sending for me to the  SwanTavern  in  Fleetstreet  in Company with Mr  Lintot  and enquiring into the Publication of that Pamphlet I then frankly told you that those  Pieces were by Mr  Joseph Jacobs  a Dissenting Teacher given to Mr  John Oldmixon  who sent the same to be published by Mr  James Roberts  in  WarwickLane  and that my Neighbour Mr  Pemberton  and  myself  had each of us a Share with Mr  Oldmixon  in the said Pamphlet For this you were pleased to treat me with half a Pint of Canary antimonially prepared for the emetic Effects of which it has been the Opinion of all Mankind you deserved the Stab My Purgation was soon over but yours will last without a timely Repentance till as the  Ghost  says in  Hamlet with all your Imperfections on your Head you are called to your Accompt and your Offences purged by Fire  Yet notwithstanding your Behaviour to me in turning this Matter into Ridicule and making me the Subject of several of your Libels all which I have equally despised I made you an Offer of Reconciliation tho' You yourself was the Aggressor  Evidenced by my Letter of the d of March last  You were by me acquainted that you had disobliged a Gentleman the Initials of whose Name were  PT  who to shew his Resentment was resolved to publish a large Collection of your Letters To this  you thought fit suitable to your former Behaviour to return me a very impertinent and false Answer in the  Grubstreet Journal Daily Journal  and  Daily Post Boy  that you believed the whole to be a  Forgery  and should not trouble yourself at all about it In the last of which Papers on the th of  April  I gave you a full Reply to which it was not in your Power to rejoin What Steps were afterwards taken in this Affair I shall impartially relate  PT  from whom I had not heard in two Years before wrote me a Letter that you should soon be convinced of your Mistake and being indisposed himself appointed  RS  to be his Agent  An Account of which whole Transaction  I have laid before the Public in the  Initial Correspondence  See the d Volume of Mr  Pope  's Letters c Printed by Mr  Curll  On the th of  May  last I published the said Collection of your Letters and on the same Day upon your being told by a Gentleman who saw you in the Court of Requests at  Westminster  that it was pretty plain the Letters published were no  Forgeries  you very pertly reply'd  so much the worse  But this by the bye Sir was owning them to be Genuine  Upon your Complaint to  some  Lords  Bolingbroke  Attainted  Oxford  Impeached  c  vid  your  Epistles  whom  you make  Patrons to the  Abuse  of  others  it was owing that the Books were  seized  and not to the Advertisement which was but the ShoeingHorn to your groundless Resentment against me But you have met a  Second  Defeat before that most August Assembly as you did in your  first  Attack relating to the Duke of  Buckingham  's Works  Therefore confess you have a  Tartar  caught  Be once sincere and frankly own your Fault  You say Sir  It will be but Justice to you to believe that nothing more is yours  than what you have owned  notwithstanding all that hath been publish'd in your Name or added to your Miscellanies since by any Bookseller whatsoever  Your Booksellers  ab origine  are indeed pretty numerous  viz J Tonson W Lewis  who sold your  Essay  on  Criticism  to  B Lintot    L Gilliver B Motte  a Printer  J Brindley O Payne T Boreman  and  C Corbet  all Hereditary Bookbinders to whom you sold by Agency your  Sober Advice  from  Horace  as will be prov'd  notwithstanding you are resolved still to deny it  Awake Dear Poet leave all meaner things  To low Ambition and the Pride of Kings  Let us since Life can little more supply  Than just to look about us and to die  Expatiate free  O while along the Stream of Time thy Name  Expanded flies and gathers all its Fame  Say shall my little Bark attendant sail  Pursue the Triumph and partake the Gale  And shall thy Verse to future Age pretend  Thou wert  Curll  's Enemy but Now his  Friend  That urg'd by thee He turn'd the tuneful Art  From Sounds to Things from  Envy  to the Heart  For Wit's false Mirror held up Nature's Light  And prov'd the  Air of Lying  It would have a better Air in him  Curll  to own the  Printing  as well as  Publishing  of Mr  Pope  's Letters c But he the said  Curll  was of a different Opinion  was  not  Right  That  Virtue  only makes our Bliss below  And all our  Knowledge  is  Ourselves to know  See the Beginning and End of the  Essay on Man  But to return Sir you say I was  first threaten'd and afterwards punish'd for printing  the Court Poems  See the Notes Variorum on the  Dunciad Page    Pray who gave you the Authority of Punishing remember only that now is my turn to Punish and if I have not the Spleen of a warpt Poet or a  Scots  Medicaster I will find some other Prescription that shall once more as  Shakespeare  says  harrow up your Soul  To believe nothing is yours but what you own  would be merely ridiculous Did you not deny the  Dunciad  for seven Years Did you not offer a Reward of three Guineas by an Advertisement in the  PostMan  to know the Publisher of your Version of the  FirstPsalm  And when you were inform'd did you ever pay the Premium Did you not publish the  Worms  yourself and leave out the Foecundifying Stanza And do you  own  any of these in the Preface to the second Volume of your Works In short Sir your Conduct as to your Poetical Productions is exactly of a Piece with what I once met with at the  Old Bailey  A most flagrant Offender was put upon his Tryal for a notorious Theft and by his egregious Shuffling he put Mr Recorder  Lovel  into a violent Passion Sirrah says he you have got a Trick of  Denying  what you ought to  own  and of  owning  what you might as well  deny  An' please your Honour quoth  Culprit  that's the Way  not to be hang'd  However impudent  Jack  was tuck'd up by a fresh Fact proved upon him that very Sessions  Thus if with small great Things may be compar'd  Kind Fate at length may wait on Thief and Bard  As to the Publication of your Letters a State Decypherer has assured me that by a Transposition of Initials the Plot is unravelled  ex gr PT  is Trickster  Pope RS  is Silly Rascal to sell imperfect Books and then cry out Whore first Pray most sincere Sir how could either  PT  or  RS  come by the Letter I wrote to You if  AP RS  and  PT  were not all of a Clan  Risum teneatis amici  Who was it play'd the Gardener sure it could not be honest  Searle  Mr  Pope  's Gardener at  Twickenham  in Lopping some Branches Inoculating others and Transplanting a large Shoot from one of your Letters to Mr  Cromwell  and Graffing it upon Mr  Walsh  's Stock  Refrain the Path that leads to Evil  Tell the plain Truth and  shame the Devil  Ananias  and  Saphyra  felt the Divine Vengeance for one Lye what then do your Confederates expect or justly ought to dread for so many as have been told about the Publication of your Letters  The Plot is now discover'd  Lawton Gilliver  has declared that you bought of him the Remainder of the Impression of  Wycherley  's Letters which he printed by your Direction in and have printed Six Hundred of the additional Letters with those to Mr  Cromwell  to make up the Volume  Yet still it must be given out that a Nobleman has been robbed and his innocent Servant must be discarded to support  Your most flagrant Falshood  This Sir is  Eating  Shame and  Drinking  after it Therefore if you have any Remorse of Conscience take Dr  Arbuthnot  's Last Advice  Study more to  Reform  than  Chastise and begin with making yourself the Precedent  Let various  Painters  Kneller Richardson Jarvas Rijsbrack  and my Sign Painter  draw your outward Part  But  Human  Pencils cannot shew the Heart  I shall take my Leave of you at present and only acquaint the Public under your Cover that this Volume contains the Remainder of your  Correspondence  with Mr  Cromwell  and your  Submission  to Mr  Dennis  Some other Pieces which if you speak Truth you cannot  Deny  tho' as yet you have not had the Candour to  Own  Every thing herein attributed to Bishop  Atterbury  is genuine and the Performances of the other Gentlemen will subsist by their intrinsic Merit  I have large Materials towards a Third Volume and if Sir notwithstanding our present Bickerings you will be so kind to favour me with any Assistance it shall be gratefully acknowledged by  SIR  Your Humble Servant E CURLL  PS  My Bookbinder  J Jackson  in  PallMall  told me he had Your Leave to sell the Pyrated Edition of your Letters for which Reason neither He nor  Dodsley  shall sell mine Once more  Yours c EC  Mr  Alexander Pope  Debtor to Mr  Edmund Curll  To an  Advertisement  in the  PostMan  promising Three Guineas to discover the Publisher of his Version of the  First  Psalm    To a Promise of Ten Pounds on producing one of Bishop  Atterbury  's Letters    To discover the  Publishers  of Mr  Pope  's  Letters      Total    All these Articles I have made good and therefore think myself justly intitled to the promissory Rewards abovemention'd  A fitter Couple sure were never hatch'd  Some marry'd are indeed but we are match'd  E CURLL  A True NARRATIVE of the Method by which Mr  Pope  's Letters have been published  _IT has been judged that to clear an Affair which seemed at first sight a little mysterious and which tho' it concerned only  one Gentleman  Mr  Pope  is the Son of a Trader and so is Mr  Curllpar nobile  is of such a Consequence as justly to alarm every Person in the Nation would not only be acceptable as a  Curiosity  but useful as a  Warning  and perhaps flagrant enough as an  Example  to induce the LEGISLATURE to prevent for the future an Enormity so prejudicial to every private Subject and so destructive of Society itself  This will be made so plain by the ensuing Papers that it will scarce be needful to attend them with any Reflexions more than what every Reader may make  In the Year  Edmund Curll  Bookseller published a Collection of several private Letters of Mr  Pope  to  Henry Cromwell  Esq  which he obtained in this Manner  Mr  Cromwell  was acquainted with one Mrs  Thomas  to whom he had the Indiscretion to lend these Letters and who falling into Misfortunes seven Years after sold them to Mr  Curll  without the Consent either of Mr  Pope  or Mr  Cromwell  These Letters were a free Gift so that there was not any Occasion to ask the Consent of either of those Parties Mr  Curll  purchased them as justly as Mr  Lintot  did the Copy of Mr  Pope  's  Homer  c  See the Letters in the Preface to  Vol  I  This Treatment being extreamly disagreeable to Mr  Pope  he was advised to recall any Letters which might happen to be preserved by any of his Friends particularly those written to Persons deceased which would be most subject to such an Accident Many of these were returned him  Some of his Friends advised him to print a Collection himself to prevent a worse but this  he would by no means  agree to  This is a notorious Falshood for it will be proved that the Books sold by  RS  to Mr  Curll  were printed at Mr  Pope  's Expence  However as some of the Letters served to revive several past Scenes of Friendship and others to clear the Truth of  Facts  in which he had been misrepresented by the common Scriblers he was induced to preserve a few of his own Letters as well as of his Friends These as I have been told he inserted in Two Books some Originals others Copies with a few Notes and Extracts here and there added In the same Books he causes to be copied some small Pieces in Verse and Prose either of his own or his Correspondents which tho' not finished enough for the Public were such as the Partiality of any Friend would be sorry to be deprived of  To this Purpose an Amanuensis or two were employed by Mr  Pope  when the Books were in the Country and by the Earl of  Oxford  when they were in Town  It happened soon after that the  Posthumous Works  of Mr  Wycherley  were published in such a Manner as could no way increase the Reputation of that Gentleman who had been Mr  Pope  's first Correspondent and Friend and several of these Letters so fully shewed the State of that Case that it was thought but a Justice to Mr  Wycherley  's Memory to print a few to discredit that Imposition These were accordingly transcribed for the Press from the  Manuscript Books  abovementioned  They were no sooner printed but  Edmund Curll  looked on these too as his Property for a Copy is extant which he corrected in order for another Impression interlin'd and added marginal Notes to in his own Hand  This is another Falshood Mr  Curll  only gave a Copy of this Pamphlet to  RS  to shew  PT  that he had reprinted those Letters which came out in and corrected the  Errata  therein    He then advertised anew the Letters to Mr  Cromwell  with  Additions  and promis'd Encouragement to all Persons who should send him more  Falshood the  Third  Mr  Curll  defies any Man living to produce any such Advertisement    This is a Practice frequent with Booksellers to swell an Author's Works in which they have some Property with any Trash that can be got from any Hand or where they have no such Works to procure some  Curll  has in the same manner since advertised the  Letters  of  Mr  Prior  and Mr  Addison  A Practice highly deserving some Check from the Legislature since every such Advertisement is really a  Watchword  to every  Scoundrel  None can be more a  Scoundrel  than the Writer of this Narrative as the many Falshoods detected in it will prove  in the Nation and to every  Domestic  of a Family to get a Penny by producing any Scrap of a Man's Writing of what Nature soever or by picking his Master's Pocket of Letters and Papers  A most flagrant Instance of this kind was the Advertisement of an intended Book called  Gulliveriana Secunda  where it was promis'd  "that  any Thing  which  any Body  should send as Mr  Pope  's or Dr  Swift  's should be printed and inserted  as Theirs  "  By these honest means Mr  Curll  went on increasing his Collection  Stupid Impertinence what has Mr  Curll  to do with Dean  Smedley  's Book called  Gulliveriana  or with the Conduct of any other Person nor was Mr  Curll  any ways concern'd in printing  Gulliveriana  and finding as will be seen hereafter a farther Prospect of doing so he retarded his Edition of Mr  Cromwell  's Letters till the d of  March  and then sent Mr  Pope  the following Letter the first he ever received from him  A greater Favour than Mr  Pope  deserved at his Hands    SIR  TO convince you of my readiness to oblige you the  Inclosed  is a Demonstration You have as he says disobliged a Gentleman the initial Letters of whose Name are  PT  I have some other Papers in the same Hand relating to your  Family  which I will show you if you desire a Sight of them Your Letters to Mr  Cromwell  are out of Print and I intend to print them very beautifully in an  Octavo Volume  I have more to say than is proper to write and if you'll give me a Meeting I will wait on you with Pleasure and close all Differences betwixt you and your's  E CURLL  Rosestreet  March  PS  I expect the Civility of an Answer or Message  The  Inclosed  were two Scraps of Paper supposed to be  PT  's a feigned Hand the first containing this Advertisement  LEtters of  Alexander Pope  Esq  and several eminent Hands From the Year to Containing a Critical Philological and Historical Correspondence between him and  Henry Cromwell  Esq  William Wycherley  Esq  William Walsh  Esq  William Congreve  Esq  Sir  William Trumbull  Sir  Richard Steele  E O Mr  Addison  Mr  Craggs  Mr  Gay  Dean  Swift  c with several Letters to Ladies to the Number of Two hundred  NB  The Originals will be shewn at  E Curll  's when the Book is publish'd  The other Paper was a Scrap of some Letter in the same Hand which expressed  "a Dissatisfaction at  Curll  for not having printed his Advertisement"  What more cannot be seen for the rest is cut off close to the Writing  Mr  Pope  's Friends imagin'd that the whole Design of  E Curll  was to get him but to look on the Edition of  Cromwell  's Letters and so to print it as  revis'd  by Mr  Pope  Doubtless that was Mr  Curll  's Intent or he need not have acquainted Mr  Pope  with his Design of printing a new Edition  in the same manner as he sent an  obscene Book  to a  Reverend Bishop  and then advertis'd it as  corrected  and  revis'd  by him  Falshood the  Fourth  One hundred Guineas shall be paid to this NarrativeWriter if he can produce any such Advertisement of Mr  Curll  's This is founded on a merry Story and the Fact as follows  viz  Mr  Henry Hoare  eldest Son of Sir  Richard Hoare  came to Mr  Curll  and told him that Dr  Robinson  then Bishop of  London  heard he was concern'd in printing an Edition of the Earl of  Rochester  's Poems Mr  Curll  told Mr  Hoare  that he was among other Bookssellers and Printers  viz  Mr  Darby  in  BartholomewClose  Mr  Bettesworth  in  Paternosterrow  Mr  Rivington  in  St Paul's Churchyard  Mr  Pemberton  in  Fleetstreet  c concerned in an Edition of that Nobleman's Works But likewise told Mr  Hoare  that he would get a Book interleav'd for my Lord Bishop and whatever his Lordship saw amiss if he would be pleased to strike out any Lines or Poems therein such Leaves should be reprinted and render'd conformable to his Lordship's Opinion Away goes Mr  Hoare  overjoy'd with this Message from Mr  Curll  with a tender of his Duty to the Bishop and opens his Credentials upon hearing which the Bishop smil'd and made the following Reply to Mr  Hoare  Sir I am told that Mr  Curll  is a shrewd Man and should I revise the Book you have brought me he would publish it as approv'd by me This no doubt Mr  Curll  might justly have done for whatever is not condemn'd is approv'd a StandingMaxim This in Civil Canon and Common Law  Or if there was any such Proposal from  PT Curll  would not fail to embrace it perhaps pay for the Copy with the very Money he might draw from Mr  P  to suppress it and say  PT  had kept another Copy He therefore answer'd the only way he thought it safe to correspond with him by a public Advertisement in the  Daily PostBoy    Daily Journal  and  Grubstreet Journal    E Curll  return'd an impertinent Answer  It was universally allow'd to be a very pertinent one  in the same Paper the next Day denying that he  endeavour'd to correspond with Mr  P and affirming that he wrote by  Direction  but declaring that he would  instantly print the said Collection  In a few Days more he publish'd the  Advertisement of the Book  as above with this Addition  "  EC  as before in the like Case will be faithful"  He now talk'd of it every where said  "That  PT  was a LORD  This is false  EP  is a Nobleman  PT  is a Scrub  or a PERSON of CONSEQUENCE who printed the Book at a  great Expence  and sought no Profit but  Revenge  on Mr  Pope who had offended him  "  particularly  "That some of the Letters would be such as both  Church  and  State would take Notice of  but that  PT  would by no means be known in it that he never would once be  seen  by him but treated in a very  secret Manner  "  He told some Persons that sifted him in this Affair  "That he had convers'd only with his Agent a Clergyman of the Name of  Smith  who came as he said from  Southwark  "  With this Person it was that  Curll  transacted the Affair who before all the Letters of the Book were deliver'd to  Curll  insisted on the Letters of  PT  being return'd him to secure him from all possibility of a Discovery as appears from a following Letter  Mr  Pope  on hearing of this  Smith  and finding when the Book came out that several of the Letters could only have come from the  Manuscript Book  beforementioned publish'd this Advertisement  WHEREAS a Person who signs himself  PT  and another who writes himself  R Smith  and passes for a Clergyman have transacted for some time past with  Edm Curll  and have in Combination printed the  Private Letters  of Mr  Pope  and his Correspondents some of which could only be procured from his own Library or that of a Noble Lord and which have given a Pretence to the publishing others as his which are not so as well as interpolating those which are This is to advertise that if either of the said Persons will discover the whole of this Affair he shall receive a Reward of  Twenty Guineas  or if he can prove he hath acted by  For  Curll  had said in his Advertisement that he wrote to Mr  P By Direction  and another of his drawing up of Mr  Pope's Life  began thus  By Direction  NB  This was true  E Curll  Direction of any other  and of  what Person  he shall receive double that Sum  Whether this Advertisement or the future Quarrel of  Curll  and  Smith  about Profits produced what followed we cannot say but in a few Days the ensuing Papers being the whole  False It is not  Half  see the  Initial Correspondence  hereto subjoined  Correspondence of  PT  and  Edm Curll  were sent to the Publisher  T Cooper  which we shall here lay before the Reader  There appear but two Letters from  PT  till one of  April  the th which must be in as it relates plainly to Mr  Pope  's Advertisement in answer to  Curll  's Letter to him of  March  d  I  April  I Saw an Advertisement in the  Daily Advertiser  which I take to relate to me I did not expect you of all Men would have betray'd me to 'Squire  Pope  but you and he both shall soon be convinc'd it was no  Forgery  For since you would not comply with my Proposal to advertise I have printed them at my own Expence being advis'd that I could safely do so I wou'd still give you the Preference if you'll pay the Paper and Print and allow me handsomely for the Copy But I shall not trust you to meet and converse upon it after the Suspicion I have of your Dealings with Master  P  unless I see my Advertisement of the Book printed first within these four or five Days If you are afraid of Mr  P  and dare not set your Name to it as I propos'd at first I do not insist thereupon so I be but conceal'd By this I shall determine  and if you will not another will It makes a Five Shilling Book I am  Your Servant PT  II  SIR  I Should not deal thus cautiously or in the Dark with you but that 'tis plain from your own Advertisement that you have been treating with Mr  Pope  III  I Still give you Sir the Preference If you will give me  l  a Score for each Book containing Pages vo and pay down  l  of the same the whole Impression shall be your's and there are Letters enough remaining if you require to make another Sheets  vo  a Five Shillings Book You need only answer thus in the  Daily Post  or  Advertiser  in four Days  EC  will meet  PT  at the  Rose Tavern  by the PlayHouse at seven in the Evening  April  d and one will come and show you the Sheets  Mr CURLL's Answers  April  SIR  I Have not ever met with any thing more inconsistent than the several Proposals of your Letters The first bearing Date  Oct  th gives some Particulars of Mr  Pope  's  Life  which I shall shortly make a public Use of in his Life now going to the Press  The second of your Letters of  Nov  th informs me That if I would publish an Advertisement of a Collection of Mr  Pope  's Letters in your Custody the Originals should be forthwith sent me and for which you would expect no more than what would pay for a Transcript of 'em  In your third Letter of the fourth Instant you groundlessly imagine I have attempted to betray you to Mr  Pope  say you have printed these Letters yourself and now want to be handsomely allow'd for the Copy  viz    l  a Score which is  l  more than they cost printing appoint a Meeting at the  Rose  on the d Instant where I was to  see the Sheets dealing thus as you truly call it in the Dark  April  You put off this Meeting fearing a Surprize from Mr  Pope  How should he know of this Appointment unless you gave him Notice I fear no such Besettings either of him or his Agents That the paying of Seventy five Pounds would bring you to Town in a Fortnight would I be so silly as to declare it By your last Letter of last Night a Gentleman is to be at my Door at this Evening who has full Commission from you  You want seventy five Pounds for a Person you would serve that Sum I can easily pay if I think the Purchase would be of any Service to me But in one Word Sir I am engaged all this Evening and shall not give myself any further Trouble about such jealous groundless and dark Negotiations An HONOURABLE and OPEN DEALING is what I have been always used to and if you will come into such a Method I will meet you any where or shall be glad to see you

recondite as that of the  FreeMasons PT  are not I dare say the true Initials of your Name or if they were Mr  Pope  has publickly declar'd  That he knows no such Person as  PT how then can any thing you have communicated to me discover you or expose you to his Resentment  I have had Letters from another Correspondent who subscribes himself  EP  which I shall print as Vouchers in Mr  Pope  's Life

Saturday  d  May  I am Sir  Your's EC  PS  What you say appears by my Advertisement in relation to Mr  Pope  I faithfully told your Friend the Clergyman I wrote to Mr  Pope  to acquaint him that I was going to print a new Edition of his Letters to Mr  Cromwell  and offer'd him the Revisal of the Sheets hoping likewise that it was now time to close all Resentments which on HONOURABLE TERMS I was ready to do I told him likewise I had a large Collection of others of his Letters which  from your two Years Silence on that Head I thought was neither unjust nor dishonourable  I Cannot send the  PT  's Letters to  Curll  Letters now because I have them not all by me but either this Evening or Tomorrow you shall not fail of them for some of them are in a Scrutore of mine out of Town and I have sent a Messenger for them who will return about three or four this afternoon Be not uneasy I NEVER BREAK MY WORD and as HONOURABLE and JUST Treatment shall be shewn by me I shall expect the same

Afternoon on  Saturday  I did not receive till past ten at Night The  Title  will be done to Day and according to your Promise I fully depend on the Books and  MSS  tomorrow I hope you have seen the  PostBoy  and  By this it appears it was of  Curll  's own drawing up which he deny'd before the Lords This is  False  Mr  Curll  told the Lords he copied the Advertisement and returned the Original This  RS  knows to be  True    approve the  Manner  of the Advertisement  I shall think every Hour a long  Period of Time 'till I have more Books and see you being Sir  Sincerely your's E CURLL  For the Reverend Mr  Smythe    But the Tables now begin to turn It happened that the  Bookseller's Bill  for so it was properly called tho' intituled  An Act for the better Encouragement of Learning  came on this Day in the House of Lords Some of their Lordships having seen an Advertisement of so  strange a Nature  thought it very unfitting such a Bill should pass without a  Clause  to prevent such an enormous  Licence  for the future And the Earl of  Iy  having read it to the House observed further that as it pretended to publish several Letters to  Lords  with the  respective Answers of each Correspondent  it was a  Breach of Privilege and  contrary to a standing Order of the House Whereupon it was order'd that the GentlemanUsher of the Black Rod do forthwith seize the Impression of the said Book and that the said  E Curll  with  J Wilford  for whom the  Daily PostBoy  is printed do attend the House tomorrow And it was also order'd that the  Bill for the better Encouragement of Learning  be read a second time on this Day Sevennight  By THIS INCIDENT THE BOOKSELLERS BILL WAS THROWN OUT  This is likewise a flagrant FALSHOOD    May  The Order made Yesterday upon Complaint of an Advertisement in the  PostBoy  of the Publication of a Book intituled Mr  Pope's Literary Correspondence for thirty Years past  being read Mr  Wilford  the Publisher and Mr  E Curll  were severally called in and examined and being withdrawn  Order'd That the Matter of the said Complaint be refer'd to a Committee to meet tomorrow and that  E Curll  do attend the said Committee And that the Black Rod do attend with some of the said Books  May    PT  writes to  Curll  on the unexpected Incident of the Lords to instruct him in his Answers to their Examination and with the utmost Care to conceal himself to this effect  THAT he congratulates him on his Victory over the  Lords  the  Pope  and the  Devil  that the Lords could not touch a Hair of his Head if he continued to behave boldly that it would have a better Air  Mr  Curll  was resolved not to put on that  Air of Lying PT  advised but told the Lords  strict Truth  which occasioned the Breach not Quarrel between them  in him to own the  Printing  as well as the  Publishing  since he was no more punishable for one than for the other that he should answer nothing more to their Interrogatories than that he receiv'd the Letters from  different Hands  that some of them he  bought  others were  given him  and that some of the  Originals he had  and the rest he  should shortly have  PT  tells him further  That he shall soon take off the  Mask  he complains of that he is not a  MAN OF QUALITY  as he imagined but  one conversant with such  and was concern'd particularly with a noble Friend of Mr  Pope  's in preparing for the Press the Letters of Mr  Wycherley  that he caused a Number over and above to be printed having from that time conceived the Thought of publishing a Volume of  P  's Letters which he went on with and order'd as nearly as possible  to resemble That Impression  But this was only  in ordine ad  to another more material Volume of his Correspondence with Bishop  Atterbury  and the late Lord  Oxford  and  Bolingbroke  And he confesses he made some  Alterations  in  these  Letters with a  View to those  which Mr  Curll  shall certainly have if he behaves as he directs and every way conceals  PT  We have not this Original Letter but we hope Mr  Curll  will print it  Which he has done in the  Initial Correspondence  with several others  if not it can only be for this Reason That it preceeded their Quarrel but one Day  Mr  Curll  knows of no Quarrel but much Roguery  it proves the Letters of Bishop  Atterbury  Lord  Bolingbroke  c cannot be in  Curll  's Hands tho' he has pretended to advertise them  Bishop  Atterbury  's Letters c are in Mr  Curll  's Hands which he is ready to produce    The next Day  Curll  answers him thus  For the Reverend Mr  Smythe  Thursday Manè th May  Dear Sir  I Am just again going to the Lords to finish  Pope  I desire you to send me the Sheets to perfect the first fifty Books and likewise the remaining three hundred Books and pray be at the  Standard  Tavern this Evening and I will pay you twenty Pounds more My Defence is right I only told the Lords I did not know from whence the Books came and that my Wife received them This was strict Truth and prevented all further Enquiry The  Lords declar'd  they had been made  Pope  's  Tool  I put myself upon this single Point and insisted as there was not any Peer's Letter in the Book I had not been guilty of any Breach of Privilege  Lord  DELAWAR  will be in the Chair by ten this Morning  and the House will be up before threeI depend that the Books and the Imperfections will be sent and believe of  PT  what I hope he believes of me  The Book was this Day produc'd and it appearing that contrary to the Advertisement  False  The Advertisement did not say there were any Peers Letters in the Book  there were no Letters of Lords contained in it and consequently not falling under the Order of the House the Books were redeliver'd  At the same time  Curll  produc'd and shew'd to several of the Lords the  foregoing Letter  of  PT  False  again Mr  Curll  shewed the Letter at  Large  not the  Extract  herein recited  which seems extraordinary unless they had begun to quarrel about  Profits  before that Day But after it it is evident from the next Letter that they had an Information of his Willingness to betray them and so get the whole Impression to himself  This is false  RS  having before contracted with Mr  Curll  for Books and given him a Receipt for but deliver'd only and those all imperfect    To the Reverend Mr  Smythe  RoseStreet  past three Friday May  SIR  I Am falsely accus'd I value not any Man's Change of Temper I will never change MY VERACITY for Falshood in owning a Fact of which I am innocent  I did not own the Books came from  across the Water  nor ever  nam'd you  all I said was that the Books came  by Water  When the Books were seiz'd I sent my Son to convey a Letter to you and as you told me every body knew you in  Southwark  I bid him make a  strict Enquiry  as I am sure you wou'd have done in such an Exigency Sir I HAVE ACTED JUSTLY in this Affair and that is what I shall always think wisely I will be kept no longer in the dark  PT  is  Will o' the Wisp  all the Books I have had are imperfect the first had no Titles nor Prefaces the last five Bundles seiz'd by the Lords contain'd but in each Bundle which amounts to and is in all but Books As to the Loss of a future Copy I despise it nor will I be concern'd with any more such dark suspicious Dealers But now Sir I'll tell you what I will do when I have the Books perfected which I have already receiv'd and the rest of the Impression I will pay you for them But what do you call this Usage First take a Note for a Month and then want it to be chang'd for one of Sir  Richard Hoare  'sMy Note is as good for any Sum I give it as the BANK and shall be as punctually paid I always say  Gold is better than Paper  and  l  I will pay if the Books are perfect tomorrow Morning and the rest sent or to Night is the same thing to me But if this dark Converse goes on I will instantly  reprint the whole Book  and as a Supplement to it  all the Letters  PT  ever sent me  of which I have  exact Copies  together with  all your Originals  and give them in upon Oath to my LordChancellor You talk of  Trust PT  has not repos'd any in me for he has my Money and Notes for imperfect Books Let me see Sir either  PT  or yourself or you'll find the  Scots  Proverb verify'd  Nemo me impune lacessit  Your abus'd humble Servant E CURLL  PS  Lord  O  and Lord  Delaware  I attend this Day I'll Sup with you to Night Where  Pope  has  one  Lord I have  twenty  This  PS  as  Cooper  printed it contradicts itself Mr  Curll  called at Lord  Delawar  's House and found him and Lord  Cowper  gone to  Holland  And that Evening Mr  Curll  had the Honour to spend with Lord  Haversham  As to Lords Mr  Curll  might have double his Number    Mr  Curll  just after in the  London Daily Post  or  General Advertiser  printed an Advertisement that he would publish all the Letters sent him by  EP PT  and  RS  To which in two Days his Correspondents return'd the following Answer  TO manifest to the World the Insolence of  E Curll  we hereby declare that neither  PT  much less  RS  his Agent ever did give or could pretend to give any Title whatever in Mr  Pope  's Letters to the said  E Curll  and he is hereby challeng'd to produce any Pretence to the Copy whatsoeverWe help'd the said  E Curll  to the Letters and join'd with him on condition he should pay a certain Sum for the Books  as he sold them  accordingly the said  E Curll  received Books which he sold Perfect and Imperfect at five Shillings each and for all which he never paid more than ten Guineas and gave  Notes  for the rest which prov'd  not Negotionable  Besides which  PT  was persuaded by  RS  at the Instigation of  E Curll  to pay the Expence of the whole Impression  viz    l  no part whereof was repaid by the said  Curll  Therefore every Bookseller will be indemnify'd every way from any possible Prosecution or Molestation of the said  E Curll  and whereas the said  E Curll  threatens to publish our Correspondence and as much as in him lies to  betray his Benefactors  we shall also publish  his Letters to us  which will open a Scene of Baseness and foul Dealing that will sufficiently show to Mankind his Character and Conduct  To this Mr  Curll  replied in the  Daily PostBoy  of  May    viz  Gentlemen The Scurility of your Advertisement I despise  Falshood  under your own Hands I shall here prove upon you and as to your  Scandal  in affirming that  my Notes proved not Negotiable  I will take proper Measures It is declared that neither  PT  much less  RS  his Agent ever did give or could pretend to give any Title whatever in Mr  Pope  's Letters to Mr  Curll  and he is challenged to produce any Pretence to the Copy whatsoever  PT  in his first Letter to Mr  Curll  writes thus To shew you my Sincerity and determinate Resolution these Letters shall be sent you they will make a four or five Shilling Book yet  I expect no more than what will barely pay a Transcriber  that the Originals may be preserved in your Hands to vouch the Truth of them  Your's  PT  PS I would have you add to them what you formerly printed of those to Mr  Cromwell In a Letter from  RS  to Mr  Curll  he thus writes Sir my Cousin  PT  desires you will get of the Titles printed with all Expedition and assures you that no Man whatsoever shall vend a Book but yourself for you shall have the whole Impression to be sure  I shall leave it to your Generosity to consider me for the Copy  I am your Friend and Servant  RS  On  Monday  the th Instant Mr  Curll  published these Letters tho' he had but Books and those wanting Titles and Prefaces But the same Day at Noon  RS  sent for Mr  Curll  to the  Standard  Tavern in  LeicesterFields  where Mr  Curll  paid him  l  in Cash  l  by a negotiable Note payable in a Month  l  and a conditional Note for  l  for which  RS  gave a Receipt to Mr  Curll  in full for Books delivering then by two Porters five Bundles of Books in each making which he said came by Water and they were sent to Mr  Curll  's House and his Wife received them in his Absence Mr  Curll  having had in all but Books tho' a Receipt given for and the last all delivered imperfect I therefore desire to know if this does not open a Scene of Baseness and foul Dealing that sufficiently shew to Mankind the Characters and Conduct of  PT  and  RS  I shall say no more till I publish the whole of their Transactions upon Oath  E Curll    PT  RS  May  The Effects of this Quarrel has been the putting into our Hands all the Correspondence above which having given the Reader to make what Reflections he pleases on we have nothing to add but our hearty Wishes in which we doubt not every honest Man will concur that the next  Sessions  when the BOOKSELLERS BILL shall again be brought in the Legislature will be pleas'd not to  extend  the  Privileges  without at the same time  restraining the Licence of Booksellers  Since in a Case so  notorious  as the printing a Gentleman's PRIVATE LETTERS most Eminent  Mr  Pope  is no more a Gentleman than Mr  Curll  nor more eminent as a Poet than he as a Bookseller  both  Printers  and  Booksellers  conspired to assist the Pyracy  T Cooper  's Edition is the pirated one and which all honest Booksellers and the Public have agreed to discourage  both in printing and vending the same  PS  We are inform'd that notwithstanding the Pretences of  Edmund Curll  Mr  Curll  never pretended to have any more Letters of Mr  Pope  's than he produced to the Lords in Committee  the Original Letters of Mr  Pope  with the PostMarks upon them remain still in the Books from whence they were copy'd and that so many Omissions and Interpolations have been made in this Publication as to render it impossible for Mr  P  to own them in the Condition they  appear  Mr  Pope  well knows that these Letters now  appear  as he directed them to be printed which will hereafter be made more fully  appear    THE  Initial Correspondence  OR ANECDOTES OF THE LIFE and FAMILY OF Mr  POPE

OF THE LIFE and FAMILY OF  Alexander Pope    Esq  _IT is a very just Observation made by a late impartial Biographer  The Author of some Anecdotes of the Life of Mr  Tho Hearne  of  Edmund Hall  Oxon  that those Persons who have been most industrious in handing down to Posterity the Memorials of other Men have generally had the Misfortune to be neglected themselves Unwilling that so hard a Fate should befal a Man who so little deserves  it I was glad to embrace any opportunity rather than trust a Thing of such Consequence to  Hereafter  and I have this Satisfaction how uncommon soever it may be thought to give an Account of a Man in his Lifetime that I have preserved some Memorials of an indefatigable Gentleman now  living  which an able pen may improve greatly to his Honour when  dead  With this View then I shall begin my Labour with the Account Mr  Pope  has given us of himself and proceed to other Authorities to which I shall all along refer  E CURLL  MR  ALEXANDER POPE  was born in  Cheapside London  on the th Day of June in the Year so that one Week produced both  Pope  and the  Pretender  Memorable  Aera  His Parents being of the  Roman  Catholic Persuasion educated him by a private Tutor of whom he learned  Latin  and  Greek  at one and the same time  He passed through some Seminaries with little Improvement till twelve Years of Age after which he perfected his Studies by his own Industry  See  Jacob's  Lives of the Poets vo pag  So early a Propensity had he to the Muses that among several other pretty Poetical Productions he sent his Friend Mr  Cromwell An Ode on Solitude  written when he was not twelve Years old  See his Letters to  Henry Cromwell  Esq  And before this time he had severely satirized his SchoolMaster as appears from the following Original Letter  viz  To Mr CURLL  March  SIR  IN pursuance to your Advertisement desiring such Accounts of Mr  Pope as his Deserts demand  I send you these  Anecdotes  the Truth of which I can testify and will if called upon as having been his Schoolfellow my self at the time  The fact is very remarkable as it is a proof of that  natural spleen  which constitutes his  Temperament  and from which he has never deviated in the whole course of his Life  The last School he was put to before the twelfth Year of his Age was in  DevonshireStreet  near  Bloomsbury  there I also was and the late Duke of  Norfolk  at the same time It was kept by one  Bromley  a  Popish Renegado  who had been a Parson and was one of  King James's  Converts in  Oxford  some Years after that Prince's Abdication  His Name was  William Bromley  Son of  Henry Bromley  of  Holt  in  Worcestershire  Esq  He was entered a GentlemanCommoner of ChristChurchCollege  Oxon  See  Wood's Athen Oxon  p Vol II Edit ult  he kept  a little Senary  till upon an advantagious offer made  him he went a  TravellingTutor  to the present Lord  Gage  Mr  Alexander Pope  before he had been four Months at this School or was able to construe  Tully's Offices  employed his Muse in satirizing his Master It was a Libel of at least one hundred Verses which a FellowStudent having given information of was found in his pocket and the young Satirist was soundly whipp'd and kept a Prisoner to his Room seven days whereupon his Father fetch'd him away and I have been told he never went to School more  How much  past Correction  has wrought upon him the World is Judge and how much  present  Correction might may be collected from this sample I thought it a curious Fact and therefore it is at your service as one of the Ornaments of this excellent Person's Life  Your's c EP  Thursday Oct  Mr CURLL  UNderstanding you propose to write the Life of Mr  Pope  this is only to inform you I can send you divers Memoirs which may be serviceable if your design be really to do him neither Injustice nor shew him Favour  I was well acquainted with his Father and with the first part of his own Life tho' since he hath treated me as a Stranger  It is certain some late Pamphlets are not fair in respect to his Father He was of the younger Branch of a Family in good repute in  Ireland  and related to the Lord  Downe  formerly of the same Name He was as he hath told Me himself and he was very different from his Son a modest and plain honest Man a Posthumous Son and left little provided for his elder Brother having what small Estate there was who afterwards studied and died at  Oxford  He was put to a Merchant in  Flanders  and acquired a moderate Fortune by Merchandize which he quitted at the Revolution in very good Circumstances and retired to  WindsorForest  where he purchased a small Estate and took great delight  in Husbandry and Gardens His Mother was one of the seventeen Children of  William Turnor  Esq  formerly of  BurfitHall  in the *** Riding of  Yorkshire  Two of her Brothers were killed in the CivilWars  This is a true Account of Mr  Pope  's Family and Parentage  The  Oxford  Antiquary informs us that  Thomas Pope  the young Earl of  Downe  died in St  Mary  's Parish in  Oxford    Dec  aged Years leaving behind him one only Daughter named  Elizabeth  who was first married to  HenryFrancis Lee  of  Dichley  in  Oxfordshire  and afterwards to  Robert  Earl of  Lindsey  The Earldom of  Downe  went to  Thomas Pope  Esq  his Uncle who likewise leaving no MaleIssue the Estate went away among  Three  Daughters the  Second  of whom was married to Sir  Francis North  afterwards Lord  North  of  Guilford  Both these Earls of  Downe  were buried at  Wroxton  near  Banbury  in  Oxfordshire  with their Ancestors See  Wood  's  Athen Oxon  Vol II pag Edit ult  of his Manners I cannot give so good a one yet as I would not wrong any Man both ought to be true and if such be your Design I may serve you in it not entering into any thing in any wise libellous  PS You may please to direct an Answer in  The Daily Advertiser  this Day se'ennight in these Terms  EC  hath received a Letter and will comply with PT  Your's PT  Notice was accordingly given at the time appointed in  the Daily Advertiser  upon which was sent the following Letter  viz  To Mr CURLL  Nov  SIR  I Troubled you with a Line some time since concerning your design of the Life of Mr  Pope  to which I desired your Answer in  the Daily Advertiser  of  Thursday  the th Inst  Oct  I do not intend my self any other Profit in it than that of doing Justice to and on that Person upon whom Sir you have constantly bestowed some Care as well as Pains in the Course of your Life and I intend him the like for his Conduct towards me  A propos  to his Life there have lately fallen into my hands a large Collection of his Letters from the former part of his Days till the Year which being more considerable than any yet seen and opening very many Scenes new to the World will alone make a perfect and the most Authentic Life and Memoirs of him that could be  To show you my Sincerity and determinate Resolution of assisting you herein  I will give you an Advertisement which you may publish if you please forthwith and on your so doing the Letters shall be sent you They will make a four of five Shilling Book yet I expect no more than what will barely pay a Transcriber that the Originals may be preserved in mine or your Hands to vouch the Truth of them  I am of opinion these alone will contain his whole History if you add to them what you formerly printed of those to  H Cromwell  Esq  but you must put out an  Advertisement  for otherwise I shall not be justified to some people who have influence and on whom I have some Dependance unless it seem to the public Eye as no entire Act of mine But I may be justified and excused if after they see such a Collection is made by you I acknowledge I sent some Letters to contribute thereto  They who know what has passed betwixt Mr  Pope  and Me formerly may otherwise think it dishonourable I should set such a Thing afoot Therefore print the Advertisement I here send you and you shall instantly hear from or see me  Adieu PT  The old Gentleman PT not calling upon me I did not put the  Advertisement  into any NewsPaper and this whole Transaction lay dormant near two Years But upon regulating some Papers in my Scritoire about the Close of  March  this  Advertisement  came to my Hands and reflecting within my self that the Resentment between Mr  Pope  and me tho' from the first ungenerously taken up by him had continued much too long being almost eight Years I was willing to lay hold of an Opportunity for proposing an Accommodation Accordingly I wrote to Mr  Pope  and inclosed the abovementioned  Advertisement  in the Handwriting of PT and desired his Answer which he thought fit in a very ungentlemanlike Manner to return me in three Papers viz the  GrubStreet Journal  The  Daily Journal  and the  Daily PostBoy  in the last of which I replied  April  th  See the  Appendix  No I and II  Upon this Incident PT renewed his Correspondence and sent me word he had seen an  Advertisement  of Mr  Pope  which related to him and that Mr  Pope  should soon see the  Collection of Letters  published for that upon my  not advertising them  he  had been persuaded to print them himself and offered me the refusal of the Impression his Demands for which were pounds and added that a Person should meet me at the Rose Tavern in  BridgesStreet  and bring me at a Day appointed one of the Books in sheets But on the Day appointed I received a Countermand that he thought he had lost his Wits by making such an Appointment and seemed in a terrible Panic lest Mr  Pope  should send some of his  TwickenhamBravoes  to assault us but how Mr  Pope  was to know of this Meeting is the Cream of the Jest I sent him word that I commiserated his fears but as to my own part I did not at all dread any  Assassination  whatever from Mr  Pope  even tho' it were a  Poetical One  To this PT rejoined that a Gentleman should call at my House precisely at eight in the Evening in a Week's Time but in the Interim I received the following Letter  viz  To Mr CURLL  May  SIR  PT will send you Books all but the Title which you may order as you please and therefore was not wrought  in five or six Days time and you may pay for them as you propose at the Week's end It will be left to your Honour to shew you my Intentions are honourable  You may therefore advertise as you propose five or six Days together that the Book will be published by you the th instant  Your Servant PT  Accordingly on the th of May RS a short squat Man came to my House not at but near at Night He had on a Clergyman's Gown and his neck was surrounded with a large Lawn Barrister's Band He shewed me a Book in sheets almost finished and about a Dozen original Letters and promised me the whole at our next meeting and the next Day I received the following Note from PT and a Letter from RS  viz  To Mr CURLL  SIR  YOu see I leave all to your own Prudence and you now see I trust your Honour as to  Price  c which settle  with the Bearer against the Week's end for  Out  they must come now forthwith I doubt not you'll return my Letters and we must by no means seem to use  Pope  with Disregard but rather commend c lest by any Circumstances I writ to you the Publisher be detected  Yours PT  The Clergyman you saw will bring you the Books to whom I insist you will deliver my former Letters concerning Mr  Pope  whom I must be concealed from and he tells me you had written an  Advertisement of Mr Pope's Life  in which if you insert any one Circumstance of what I told you in a private Letter I shall be discovered and exposed to his Resentment I insist on your Honour in returning them therefore  You may do as you please your self in relation to the References to CROMWELL's  Letters  and therefore you may add any such Advertisement to the Title of the Book it self for I do not thoroughly understand you as to that PT  To Mr CURLL  May  Dear Sir  PLease to send by the bearer the Title and the Preface and an Estimate and the Papers you promised me last Night I mean the Letters The Printer is drawing out the Sheets and you shall have the rest with Expedition If I should get off my Engagement for this Evening leave Word where I shall meet you I am  Your Friend and Servant R SMYTHE  PS  The old Gentleman is vastly pleas'd at our Meeting last Night don't fail to send by the Bearer the Letters I shall have great News and good to tell you Friday to both our Advantage  Two a Clock Saturday May  Dear SIR  MY Cousin desires you will get of the Titles printed with all Expedition and assures you that no Man  whatsoever shall vend one Book but your self for you shall have the whole Impression to be sure He says Tuesday I am  SIR Your Friend and Servant RS  PS  Why don't you advertise  May  SIR  YOU see how earnest  PT  is to have these Books out therefore you will receive by the Bearer some Titles By one aClock you shall have more Books but he must insist on some Money to pay the Printer The Number I shall bring you will be near be at home at for I may get them before I am  Your Friend and Servant RS  According to the Request herein I staid at home and about one o'Clock  RS  sent for me to the  Standard Tavern  in  LeicesterFields  where I paid him ten pounds and gave him a negotiable Note for fifteen pounds payable in a Month as he desired  We had not been together half an hour before two Porters brought to the Tavern five Bundles of Books upon a Horse which RS told me came by Water He ordered the Porters to carry them to my House and my Wife took them in They contained but Books in each bundle making in the Bundles Books all wanting the Letters to Mess  Jarvas Digby Blount  and Dr  Arbuthnot  's Letter But he said they contained in each Bundle which with I had before without Titles or Prefaces made and gave me the following Receipts  May  Then receiv'd of Mr  Curll  ten pounds on Account by me R SMYTHE  Receiv'd at the same Time a Note of hand of Fifteen pounds one Month after date which when paid is in full for three Hundred Books by me R SMYTHE  NB  He had a conditional Note of mine besides payable on Demand for five pounds  E CURLL  About two a Clock on the very Day of Publication the th Instant all the Books that were in my Custody were seized by a Warrant from the House of Lords and my self and Mr  John Wilford  Publisher of the PostBoy were both ordered to attend their Lordships the next Day which we did accordingly Mr  Wilford  and the Printer of the  PostBoy  whom he brought with him were upon Examination discharged But the Lords Resolving themselves into a Committee I was ordered to attend the next Day  At my Return home I found the following Letter from RS  To Mr CURLL  May  SIR  AS SOON as I heard of our Misfortune of the Books being seiz'd I posted away to PT he said he found his great Caution was but necessary but tho' he knew Mr  Pope  's Interest with the Great he apprehended only his personal Revenge or a Chancery Suit knowing he would spare no Cost to gratify his Revenge  he said if you had been more cautious than to  name Lords  in your Advertisement this could not have happen'd but since it has happen'd you shall not only find him punctual but  Generous  He immediately sent me with Money to pay off the Printer and I have the whole Impression in my hands I then found that the Rogue had deliver'd your last Parcel imperfect but I will bring you both those Sheets and the whole Impression the very first day they can be safely deliver'd you  PT says he never intended any more Advantage but meerly not to be out of pocket Except you had been willing to gratify me a little but now he will be Just and act handsomely to you tho' ever so much to his own Loss provided you keep secret our whole TransactionAs it is plain that  Pope  's whole Point is only to  suppress the Books  and find out  who gave the Letters  You will intirely disappoint him in both if whatever Questions the Lords ask you will answer no more than thus  that you had the Letters  from  different Hands  some of which you  paid  for that  you printed these as you did Mr Cromwell's  before without Mr  Pope  's ever  gainsaying  it and that as to the  Originals many you can  shew now  and the rest you can  very speedily  It is well that an Accident hinders you at present from the Originals which now they would seize PT thinks it was indiscreet to advertise the Originals so very quick as the first Day until you actually had them which by his own falling ill he cou'd not come at so soon in the place where they lay  The Lords cannot stop the Books above two or three Days if at all  And PT's wonderful Caution as it happens will enable you to sell them whatever Orders they may make For he apprehending Injunctions in Chancery might suppress the Book had already printed  another Title and Preface  which throws the Publication intirely off you and might be safely vended even in that Case  In short if you absolutely conceal all that has passed between PT Me and Your self you win the old Gentleman for ever For his whole Heart is set upon publishing the Letters not so much for this Volume as  in Ordine ad  to much more important Correspondence that will follow  viz  with SWIFT late Lord OXD Bp ROCHESTER and Lord BOL  You shall hear soon from me I hope this will be quickly over I remain  Your Faithful Servant R SMYTHE  May  SIR  WE heartily congratulate you on your Victory over the Lords the  Pope  and the Devil for we have sure Information that the Books will be restor'd to you either this day or to morrowThe old Gentleman is charm'd with your Behaviour yesterday only thinks it wrong that he hears you own'd the  Books were sent to your Wife  by an unknown HandThis may induce Enquiry and Suspicion of some dark Transaction and be thought shuffling The Lords will think you more sincere and 'twill have a betrer Air to say  you had the Originals and Copies from different Hands and that some you paid for some were given you and you printed them in your own Right  You can suffer no more for printing than for publishing  them and the Lords can't touch a Hair of your Head  All that  PT  can apprehend is that  Pope  may obtain an Injunction in Chancery against  E Curll  by Name notwithstanding which those Books may be selling which have not your Name with the Preface which he provided for that Purpose  And you cannot but observe when you read that Preface that at the same Time that it makes you not Publisher it yet proves your Right to  Cromwell  's  Letters  This is as lucky as can be and  Pope  cannot obtain an Injunction without owning himself in the Bill Author of the Letters which will serve you to prove the Letters genuine  If you observe all the old Gentleman's Directions you will soon be fully acquainted both with his Person and Designs in the mean Time to shew you he will take off the Mask and clear the  Mysterium magnum  you complain of I have his Leave to tell you these things which he would have writ to you himself but  that his Arm is now disabled by the Rheumatism  He is no Man of Quality but conversant with many and happening to be concern'd with a noble Lord a Friend of Mr  Pope  's in handing to the Press his Letters to  Wycherley  he got some Copies over and above This Incident put first into his Head the Thought of collecting more and afterwards finding you did not comply in printing his Advertisement he went on with it by himself Found  Cromwell  's Answers in the same Lord's Possession with many others which he printed as near as possible to correspond with the Letter and Paper  c  The Observations he made in some Paragraphs  c  were necessary the same things being repeated in other Letters either of this or the next Volume particularly the Original of the Letter to Mr  Walsh  is in his Hand  I hope to have some of his Originals when we meet The Books that Rascal sent imperfect you shall have perfected on your first Desire by a Line to  Dicks  in which you are disir'd to send us Word of what you now think of the Honour and Candour of  Your faithful Friend PT  May Thursday a Clock  SIR  YOU are happily got off to my extreme Pleasure I take the first Minute I hear of your Acquittal to tell you from certain Information that *****  Pope's  Friends particularly *** wou'd have done any sort of illegal Injustice to have come at you even to Imprisonment and Confiscation of the Books It was wholly owing to ***************** that your are defended in your Rights and it will be but common Gratitude in you as well as may possibly nay certainly recommend you to their Patronage to take the first Opportunity to return them your public Thanks The Coach waits and I am going with this joyful News to the old Gentleman and to have his Orders for what he promis'd is the Reason I cannot possibly see you this Night I am  Your's most sincerely R SMYTHE  May  SIR  I Have seen  PT  from whom I hop'd to have had the MSS But I found him in a very different Humour from what I left  him He says you did not follow the Instructions he sent you in not owning the Printing which tho' in your Letter you seem to think nothing yet joyn'd to your having own'd to others that you had them from across the Water was almost all that you could discover Yet further we are certainly inform'd that you have nam'd me as the Hand that convey'd them This you've said that I was a Clergyman belonging to  C Church  in  Southwark  Judge you whether we can think of you as you've Reason to think of us whether this be honourable Usage after you had known what  PT  had done and what a Sum he paid to get you the whole Impression  PT  had Reason to think you would betray him assoon as you had it Judge too if you have done wisely to hazard by your blabbing the Loss of a future Copy of immense Value which I much doubt he will ever let you have He has positively enjoyn'd me not to trust my self with you till better Assurance and the best way for my Part that I know you can give any Assurance is to send the pound first to  Dicks CoffeeHouse  in a Note on Mr  Hoare  by tomorrow morning and to show PT that you trust him as absolutely in that small Sum as he has  done you in a much greater As soon as you do this and not before he'll send all the things you desire which I believe he would never have done after your naming me and coming so near as  Southwark  but for his being so earnest to have the Book publish'd  In one Word he has put it upon this Test  I am sorry you have given him this Occasion of Distrust I wou'd be glad to do you a good Office with him but I fear you've done me a bad one in naming me I am  Yours RS  Your Answer ought to be very satisfactory  May  SIR  I Will bring you the Remainder of the Impression Thursday Evening For I am really tir'd with this capricious Temper of the old Gentleman he suspects his own shadow I shall leave it to your Generosity to consider me for the Copy I am just sent for to him and am told he's in good Humour I have but just time to tell you  I am Your Friend and Servant RS  APPENDIX  No I

ever to have any private Correspondence  with  AP  but was directed to give him Notice of these Letters Now to put all  Forgeries  even  Popish ones  to flight this is to give Notice that any Person

_THIS Letter greets you from the Shades  Not those which thin unbody'd Shadows fill  That glide along th'  Elysian  Glades  Or skim the flow'ry Meads of  Asphodill    But those in which a learned Author said  Strong Drink was drunk and Gambols play'd  And two substantial Meals a Day were made  The Bus'ness of it is t' express  From me and from my Holiness  To you and to your Gentleness  How much I wish you Health and Happiness  And much good News and little Spleen as may be  A hearty Stomach and sound Lady  And ev'ry Day a double Dose of Coffee  To make you look as sage as any Sophy  For the rest I must be content in plain Prose to assure you that I am very much oblig'd to you for the Favour of your Letter▪  But if I may be allow'd to object against any thing you write which I must do if it were only to be even with you for your Severity to me it shou'd be that Passage in your's where you are pleas'd to call the Whores of  Drurylane  the Nymphs of  Drury  I must own it was some Time before I could frame to my self any plausible Excuse for this Expression but Affection which you know Sir excuses all Things at last furnish'd me with one in your Justification which I have here sent you in Verse that you may have at least some Rhyme to defend you tho' you shou'd have no Reason  If Wit or Critic blame the tender Swain  Who stil'd the gentle Damsels in his Strain  The Nymphs of  Drury  not of  Drurylane  Be this his Answer and the most just Excuse  ' Far be it Sirs from my more civil Muse  ' Those loving Ladies rudely to traduce  ' Alleys and Lanes are Terms too vile and base  ' And give Ideas of a narrow Pass  ' But the wellworn Paths of the Nymphs of  Drury  ' Are large and wide  Tydcombe  and I assure ye  I made no question but the News of  Sapho  's staying behind me in the Town wou'd surprize you But she is since come into the Country and to surprize you more I will inform you that the first Person she nam'd when I waited on her was one Mr  Cromwell  What an Ascendant have you over all the Sex who could gain the Fairone's Heart by appearing before her in a long black unpowder'd Perriwig nay without so much as the very Extremities of clean Linnen in Neckcloth and Cuffs I guess that your Friend  Vertumnus  among all the Forms he assum'd to win the good Graces of  Pomona  never took upon him that of slovenly Beau  Well Sir I leave you to your Meditations on this Occasion and to languish unactive as you call it  But I find I have exceeded my Bounds and begin to travel on the Confines of Impertinence However to make you amends I shall desire Mr  Wycherley  to deliver you this Letter who will be sure in less than a Quarter of an Hour's Conversation with you to give you Wit enough to attone for twice as much Dulness as I have troubled you with Therefore I shall only give my Respects to some of our Acquaintance and conclude  To  Baker  first my Service pray  To  Tydcomb  eke  And Mr  Cheek  Last to  yourself  my best Respects I pay  And so remain for ever and for ay  SIR  Your affectionate humble Servant A POPE  LETTER II  Nov th  SIR  ABOUT the Time that Mr  Wycherley  came to  London  I troubled you with a Letter of mine in hopes of prevailing with you to continue the Favour of your's But I now write to convince you that Silence is not always the surest Guard against Impertinence I have too great a Sense of those many Civilities receiv'd from you to desist from expressing it till I receive more For you not only have acquainted me with many of my Errors in scribbling but with some in my Conduct and I owe to you the Knowledge of Things infinitely more of Concern to myself than any thing of mine can be to others The Advantage I have obtain'd from both might endanger your being put upon an endless Trouble of criticizing on the rest of my Faults and therefore you have reason to make some delay with those now under your Examination Tho' I never cou'd expect you shou'd once look upon them but when you were perfectly at Leisure yet so much Assurance your former Kindness had given me that I was under some Apprehensions for your Health on  the Score of your Silence and I desir'd Mr  Wycherley  to inform me on that Subject which he did not either through Forgetfulness or else believing I shou'd be soon in Town And I had certainly been there before this Time had it been in my Power to comply with his most obliging Invitation and my Desires of seeing him and you But since I find I must not hope for that Satisfaction till after  Christmas  I entreat you will not in the mean time let me be so unhappy as to doubt of your Welfare which is the sole Business of this Letter that to make you some amends for the unconscionable Length of my last shall not add a Word more but that which I hope you will ever believe that I am  Dear SIR  Your most oblig'd and most humble Servant A POPE  PS  Pray continue to assure Mr  Wycherley  of my real Affection for and Service to him and let him know I writ to him two Posts since You will likewise oblige me by giving my Service to Mr  Betterton  when you see him who I am afraid is not well not having seen his Name among the Actors in the public Advertisements  LETTER III  December  Dear Sir  I Receiv'd the Favour of your kind Letter wherein I find you have oblig'd me before I expected it in reviewing the Papers I sent you I have been ask'd I believe twenty times by Sir  William Trumbull  for a Sight of that Translation but have deferr'd it till I cou'd supply the blank Spaces I left in the fair Copy by your Approbation If therefore you will send it inclos'd to Mr  Thorold  the Tobacconist in  Dukestreet  to be sent me by the Coach as soon as you can conveniently it will come very opportunely since I find I can no longer refuse to show it to Sir  William  with any Decency I am mightily pleas'd with your Objection to my attributing Friendship to Dogs yet think the Want of Equality is no Obstacle to the Friendship of some Country Gentlemen of my Acquaintance with theirs▪ I am extreamly impatient to enjoy your agreeable Conversation and to let you know how much I prefer it to any here where indeed Dogs and Men are much on a Level only the first have more Goodnature and more Sagacity If I were not at this instant very  much afflicted with the Headach I would offer a few more Considerations in Behalf of the fourlegg'd Part of the Creation But I will only add one Word that you and I will never disagree about Dogs or any Thing else for I am with very much Esteem and ever will be  SIR  Your most faithful Friend and humble Servant A POPE  PS  I design to write to Mr  Wycherley  by this Post in Answer to the most kind and friendly Letter I ever receiv'd I shall never be unhappy or melancholy in the Country as long as he and you will oblige me with your Letters  LETTER IV  June th  Dear Sir  I WAS extreamly concern'd to leave you ill when I parted from the Town and desir'd Mr  Thorold  to give me an Account of the State of your Health by the  next Coach He omitted to do it and I have been since at Mr  Englefyld  's till yesterday when I receiv'd the ill News that you continu'd ill or much as I left you I hope this is not true and shall be very uneasy in my Fears for your Health till I have a farther Account from yourself which I beg you not to defer I hope the Air of this Forest may perfectly recover you and wish you wou'd to that end try it sooner than the End of the Month if you desire Mr  Thorold  he will at a Day's Warning take a Place for you My Father joins in this Request and Mr  Englefyld  is overjoy'd with the Hopes of seeing you at his House When I have your Company I cannot but be well and hope from the Knowledge of this that you can't be very ill in mine I beg you to believe no Man can take a greater Interest in your Welfare or be more heartily affected towards you than my self who am with all the Esteem and Tenderness of a Friend  Dear SIR  Your faithful Humble Servant A POPE  LETTER V  June th  Dear Sir  IF my Letter pleas'd you your's overjoy'd me and I expect impatiently your kind Visit A little Room and a little Heart are both at your Service and you may be secure of being easy in 'em at least tho' not happy For you shall go just your own Way and keep your own Hours which is more than can be done often in Places of greater EntertainmentAs to your Letter of Critical Remarks on  Dryden  's VIRGIL I can only say most of what you observe are true enough but of no great Consequence in my Opinion at least  Line    And sanctify the Shame  seems to me very beautiful and so does  'tis doubly to be dead  Line  And bandy'd Words still beat about his Ears  This I have thought gross as well as you I agree with you that the  d Line And clos'd her Lids at last in endless Night  is contradictory to the Sense of  Virgil  for so as you say  Iris  might have been spar'd And in the main 'tis to be confess'd that the Translator has been freer with the Character of  Dido  than his modest Author wou'd allow I am just taking Horse to see a  Friend five Miles off that I have no little Visits abroad to interrupt my Happiness at Home when you are here So that I can but just assure you how pleas'd I am in the Expectation of it and how sincerely I shall ever be  Dear SIR  Your most oblig'd and affectionate Servant A POPE  PS  Pray bring a very considerable Number of Pint Bottles with you this might seem a strange odd Request if you had not told me you wou'd stay but as many Days as you brought Bottles therefore you can't bring too many tho' we are here no Drunkards 'Tis a

since they saw you and heard more civil Things in that Fortnight than they expect from the whole Shire of us in an Age The Trophy you bore away from one of 'em in your Snuffbox will doubtless preserve her Memory and be a Testimony of your Admiration for ever  As long as  Mocha  's happy Tree shall grow  While Berries crackle or while Mills shall go  While smoaking Streams from silver Spouts shall glide  Or  China  's Earth receive the sable Tide  While  Coffee  shall to  British  Nymphs be dear  While fragrant Steams the bended Head shall chear  Or grateful Bitters shall delight the Taste  So long her Honour Name and Praise shall last  Pray give my Service to all my few Friends and to Mr  Gay  in particular Farewel  that is drink strong Coffee  Ingere tibi calices amariores  I am with all Sincerity  Dear SIR  Your most faithful Friend and humble Servant A POPE  July th  LETTER VII  Dear Sir  I Receiv'd your most welcome Letter and am asham'd you shou'd seem to give us Thanks where you ought to assure us of Pardon for so ill an Entertainment Your heroic Intention of flying to the Relief of a distressed Lady was glorious and noble such as might be expected from your Character for as  Chaucer  says I think  As noblest Metals are most soft to melt  So Pity soonest runs in gentle Minds  But what you tell me of her Relations Account of the State of her Mind is not to be wonder'd at 'Tis the easiest Way they have to make some seeming Excuse for a shameful Indolence and Neglect of afflicted Virtue to represent it as willing to suffer and endure the Cross Alas Sir These good People of large Estates and little Souls have no mind to ease her by bearing it off her Shoulders by a generous Assistance OUr Saviour himself did not refuse to be eas'd of the Weight of Part of his Cross tho' perhaps  Simon  of  Cyrene  might alledge to the  Jews  that 'twas Christ's Desire to bear it all himself and he for his Part might be willing to go quietly on his Journey without the Trouble  Be pleas'd to assure Mr  Ballam  of my faithful Service I can never enough esteem a Zeal so ardent in my Concerns from one I never cou'd any Way oblige or induce to it 'Tis an Effect of the purest most disinterested Strain of natural Goodhumour in the World Pray at your Leisure return me those Papers in  my Hand  which you have and in Mr  Wycherley  's and favour me as often as you can with your Letters which will ever be the most entertaining Things I can receive in your AbsenceAll those fine Persons you mention return you their humble ServiceThe Fate of  the  Berry  moves at once my

misled by the Vices of that Age had been too great a Libertine in many of his Writings but dearly did he repent of it before he died as certainly all must who have but even the Principles of Natural Religion when they come to take a serious View of Eternity he was continually bewailing the Impossibility of calling in all his Works and making a thorough Reformation and therefore took all Opportunities of deterring others from treading in his Steps nay sometimes his Zeal carried him so far as to  chide even when there was no Occasion as witness one of his Letters to me who had desired his Correction of some Verses and had innocently said they were written in Imitation of Mr  Behn  's Numbers I own I was pleased with the Cadence of her Verse tho' at the same Time I no ways approved the Licentiousness of her Morals But you will see how severe he is upon me for it and I am very certain if he had lived but a few Months longer he would have published a  Treatise  by Way of  Recantation  which as he often used to say was  the only Method whereby he could redeem his Crime and prevent a growing Evil  Sir if you think the  private Thoughts  of this  Great Man  may be useful to the Public and worthy a Place in your Collection they are freely at your Service from  Your sincere Friend ET  June th  LETTERS OF Mr  DRYDEN  TO  CORINNA  Mrs  Elizabeth Thomas  jun    MADAM  _THE Letter you were pleased to direct for me to be left at the Coffeehouse last Summer was a great Honour and your  Verses  A  Pastoral  hereafter mentioned  were I thought too good to be a Woman's some of my Friends to whom I read them were of the same Opinion 'Tis not over gallant I must confess to say this of the fair Sex but most certain  it is that they generally write with more Softness than Strength On the contrary you want neither Vigour in your Thoughts nor Force in your Expressions nor Harmony in your Numbers and methinks I find much of ORINDA  The celebrated Mrs  Catherine Philips  in your Manner to whom I had the Honour to be related and also to be known But I continued not a Day in the Ignorance of the Person to whom I was obliged for if you remember you brought the  Verses  to a Bookseller's Shop and enquired there how they might be sent to me There happened to be in the same Shop a Gentleman who hearing you speak of me and seeing a Paper in your Hand imagined it was a  Libel against me  and had you watched by his Servant till he knew both your Name and where you lived of which he sent me word immediately Tho' I have lost his Letter yet I remember you live some where about  St Giles  's  She lived with her Mother in  DyottStreet  and are an only Daughter You must have passed your Time in reading much better Books than mine or otherwise you could not have arrived to so much Knowledge as I find  you have But whether  Sylph  or  Nymph  I know not  Those fine Creatures  as your Author Count  Gabalis  A Translation of the entertaining History of the  Count de  GABALIS by Mr  Ozell  is printed by  E Curll  Price s d  assures us  have a mind to be christened  and since you do me the Favour to desire a Name from me take that of CORINNA if you please I mean not the Lady with whom OVID was in Love but the famous  Theban  Poetess who overcame PINDAR five Times as Historians tell us I would have call'd you SAPHO but that I hear you are handsomer Since you find I am not altogether a Stranger to you be pleased to make me happier by a better Knowledge of you and instead of so many unjust Praises which you give me think me only worthy of being  MADAM  Your most humble Servant and Admirer JOHN DRYDEN  LETTER II  MADAM  THE great Desire which I observe in you to write well and those good Parts which God Almighty and Nature have bestowed on you make me not to doubt that by Application to Study and the Reading of the best Authors you may be absolute Mistress of POETRY 'Tis an unprofitable Art to those who profess it but you who write only for your Diversion may pass your Hours with Pleasure in it and without Prejudice always avoiding as I know you will the Licences which Mrs  Behn  allowed herself of writing loosely and giving if I my have leave to say so  some Scandal to the Modesty of her Sex  I confess I am the last Man who ought in Justice to arraign her who have been myself too much a Libertine in most of my Poems which I should be well contented  I had Time either to purge or to see them fairly burned  But this I need not say to you who are too well born and too well principled to fall into that Mire  In the mean Time I would advise you not to trust too much to VIRGIL  's Pastorals  for as excellent as they are yet THEOCRITUS is far before him both in Softness of Thought and Simplicity of Expression Mr  Creech  Mr  Creech  's Translation of  Theocritus  is printed for  E Curll  Pr s d  has translated that  Greek  Poet which I have not read in  English  If you have any considerable Faults they consist chiefly in the Choice of Words and the placing them so as to make the Verse run smoothly but I am at present so taken up with my own Studies that I have not Leisure to descend to Particulars being in the mean time the fair

see I am like the rest of the World an  impudent Borrower  and a  bad Paymaster  You take more Care of my Health than it deserves that of an old Man is always crazy and at present mine is worse than usual by a  St Anthony  's  Fire  in one of my Legs tho' the Swelling is much abated yet the Pain is not wholly gone and I am too weak to stand upon it If I recover it is possible I may attempt  Homer

Graces who am with all Sincerity and Gratitude  Your most humble Servant and Admirer JOHN DRYDEN  Friday December th  Mr CHARLES DRYDEN to CORINNA  MADAM  NOtwithstanding I have been seized with a Fever ever since I saw you last I have this Afternoon endeavoured to do my self the Honour of obeying my Lady  Chudleigh  's Commands My Fever is still increasing and I beg you to peruse the following Verses according to your own Sense and Discretion which far surpasses mine in all Respects In a small Time of Intermission from my Illness I wrote these following  viz  MADAM  HOw happy is our  British  Isle to bear  Such Crops of Wit and Beauty to the Fair  A  female Muse  each vying Age has blest  And the last  Phoenix  still excels the rest  But you such solid Learning add to Rhymes  Your Sense looks fatal to succeeding Times  Which rais'd to such a Pitch o'erflows like  Nile  And with an after Dearth must seize our Isle  Alone of all your Sex without the Rules  Of formal Pedants or the noisy Schools  What Nature has bestow'd will Art supply  Have trac'd the various Tracks of dark Philosophy  What happy Days had wise  Aurelius  seen  If for  Faustina  you his Wife had been  No jarring Nonsense had his Soul opprest  For he  with all he wish'd for  had been blest  Be pleased to tell me what you find amiss or correct it yourself and excuse this Trouble from  MADAM  Your most humble and most obedient Servant CHARLES DRYDEN  Son of Mr  Dryden  he was unfortunately drowned in swimming at  Windsor    LETTERS OF Mr ADDISON  To the Earl of MANCHESTER at Paris  Whitehall  Aug OS  My LORD  MR WALPOLE is lately arrived from Mr  Stanhope  and has brought with him the Treaty of Commerce concluded with the King of  Spain  I believe the Envoy will be here himself this Winter his Presence being perhaps necessary in case a certain Earl should raise any Uneasinesses in the House of Lords Our Merchants are very angry at their late Losses on the  Russia  Fleet and pretend the Enemy must have had Advices of the Convoy's Orders to meet them in so critical a Juncture but it seems the Orders were such as the Merchants themselves desired Our Wagers on  Toulon  are sunk but we still think the Odds are for us The Duke of  Devonshire  The Right Noble and Honourable WILLIAM Duke of  Devonshire  to whom Mr  Hobbes  was Tutor  is dangerously  gerously ill of a Retention of Urine which will prove fatal unless very suddenly remedied  I am c J ADDISON  To the same  Whitehall  Aug OS  My LORD  WE had yesterday a  Lisbon  Mail in which we received Letters from  Barcelona  of  June  the th They all tax very much the  French  Generals for not having made more use of their Victory at  Almanza  which till the coming away of those Letters had been followed by very insignificant Success This had given our Forces time to recover themselves and to take all the necessary Precautions for the Defence of  Catalonia  where the People appeared firm to the  Austrian  Interest and the more so since they saw by the Treatment of the  Valentians  and  Arragenians  what they were to expect in case of Conquest The  Lisbon  Letters gives us hopes of retaking  Moura  and  Serpa  tho' we are afraid our four  English  Regiments  may suffer much before them not being seasoned to the Heats of the Country which are at present in their greatest strength The Parliament of  Ireland  seems very much pleased with their new Lord Lieutenent  The Rt Hon  Thomas  Lord  Wharton    I am c J ADDISON  To Mr COLE at  Venice  Whitehall  Sept  SIR  MR  Stepney  died yesterday at  Chelsey  and will be buried in  Westminster Abbey  I need not tell you how much he is lamented by every body here He has left Mr  Prior  a Legacy of Pounds to my Lord  Halifax  a  Golden Cup  and a hundred Tomes of his Library the rest of it is to go to Mr  Lewis  and a Silver  Ewer and Bason  to Mr  Cardonnel  His Estate is divided between his two Sisters The best part of it lies in the Treasury which owes him Pounds The  Observator  in Dead  Mr  John Tutchin  Author of that Paper did in King  James  's Reign petition to be hanged    J ADDISON  To the Earl of MANCHESTER at Paris  Whitehall  Oct  My LORD  THE Earl of  Sunderland  is now at  NewMarket  and will return with  Her Majesty  on Friday next I have been with Sir  Charles Hedges  to ask him for a Draught of a Treaty of Commerce with the Republic of  Venice  but he does not remember that ever he had any such in his Hands I have therefore sent to Mr  Palmer  on the same Subject who with two or three other  Venetian  Merchants brought me the Project of a Treaty which they desired me to read to my Lord  Sunderland  upon his Return from  NewMarket  in Order to have it laid before the Queen and Cabinet to be examined and transmitted to your Lordship with proper Instructions In the mean Time I am ordered to send a Copy of it to your Lordship that you may please to consider it and if you think fit may have time to give your Opinion on any Part of it Our Forces designed for  Portugal  are ready to sail with the first fair Wind  I am c J ADDISON  To Mr COLE at  Venice  Whitehall  Oct  YEsterday we had News that the Body of Sir  Cloudesly Shovel  was found on the Coast of  Cornwall  The Fishermen who were searching among the Wrecks took a Tin Box out of the Pocket of one of the Carcasses that was floating and found in it a Commission of an Admiral upon which examining the Body more narrowly they saw it was poor Sir  Cloudesly  You may guess the Condition of his unhappy Wife who lost in the same Ship with her Husband her two only Sons by Sir  John Narborough  We begin to despair of the two other Men of War and the Fireship that engaged among the same Rocks  I am c J ADDISON  To the Earl of MANCHESTER at  Paris  Cockpit  July  My LORD  I Make bold to congratulate your Lordship on the appearance of so honourable a Conclusion as your Lordship is putting to  your Dispute with the Senate of  Venice  I had the pleasure to day of hearing your Lordship's Conduct in this Affair very much applauded by some of our first Peers We had an unlucky Business about two Days ago that befel the  Muscovite  Ambassador who was arrested going out of his House and rudely treated by the Bayliffs He was then upon his Departure for his own Country and the Sum under a Hundred Pounds that stopt him and what makes the Business the worse he has been punctual in his Payments and had given Order that this very Sum should be paid the Day after However as he is very well convinced that the Government intirely disapproves such a Proceeding there are no ill Consequences apprehended from it Your Lordship knows that the Privileges of Ambassadors are under very little Regulations in  England  and I believe that a Bill will be promoted in the next Parliament for setting them upon a certain foot at least it is what we talk of in both Offices on this Occasion  I am c J ADDISON  To the Hon Major DAVID DUNBAR    SIR  I This Morning urged to my Lord Lieutenant every thing you suggest in your Letter and what else came into my Thoughts He told me it stopped with the Secretary and that he would still see what could be done in it I spoke to Sir  William Saint Quintin  to remove all Difficulties with the Secretary and will again plead your Cause with his Excellency tomorrow Morning If you send me word where I may wait on you about eleven o'Clock in some ByeCoffeeHouse I will inform you of the Issue of this Matter if I find my Lord  Sunderland  at home and will convince you that I was in earnest when I wrote to you before by shewing myself  Your most Disinterested Humble Servant J ADDISON  To the Hon Major DUNBAR  SIR  I Find there is a very strong Opposition formed against you but I shall wait on my Lord Lieutenant this Morning and lay your Case before him as advantageously as I can if he is not engaged in other Company  I am afraid what you say of his Grace  The Duke of  Marlborough  does not portend you any Good  And now Sir believe me when I assure you I never did nor ever will on any pretence whatsoever take more than the stated and customary Fees of my Office I might keep the contrary Practice concealed from the World were I capable of it but I could not from my self And I hope I shall always fear the Reproaches of my own Heart more than those of all Mankind In the mean Time if I can serve a Gentleman of Merit and such a Character as you bear in the World the Satisfaction  I meet with on such an Occasion is always a sufficient and the only Reward to  SIR  Your most Obedient Humble Servant J ADDISON  These two Letters relate to a very signal piece of Service which Mr  Addison  did this Gentleman in the Year when he was Secretary to the Earl of  Sunderland  Lord Lieutenant of  Ireland  It was so great a Favour that Major  Dunbar  sent Mr  Addison  a BankBill of  l  which he would not by any means accept After which he laid out the Money in a DiamondRing which Mr  Addison  likewise rejected  Mr  Blls  's LETTER to Mr  Tr  at BATH  Aug  SIR  AT this Season  London  ceases to be the Metropolis of Pleasure the few of the polite World that remain here become considerable by their scarceness  Valentine  the vainest thing alive calls the Town his Retreat and continues in it only to preside over the Scarcity of Fools  Pretty Miss D exposes her Reputation to a Thousand daily Sollicitations it is possible she may as yet retain her Virtue if so she is certainly weary of her Profession Greatly opposite my Friend is the Character of the Lady you inquire after whom I have not been able to see these six Weeks save at her Devotions on the Sabbath where she was too deeply tho' most unfashionably engaged for me to claim any part of her Attention I know you expect a Rapture when I speak of her but I assure you her Virtue awes and suppresses every idle Thought she is a Pattern to form an Angel by and seems as tho' she would revenge on all Mankind the devastations they have committed on her Sex nothing has appeared worthy Notice since your last I have however sent you something that has been handed about here I suppose intended as a Satire upon your self you'll smile to see all the Rage of  Parnassus  dwindled to this gentle Hum with which my dear Friend I shall conclude  Yours c  To the AUTHOR  Mr  Jos Turner  It was printed in Fol  of an Epistle to Mr POPE

June  SIR  FOR your  second  Volume of  Literary Correspondence  c I here send you an Imitation of  the  FEAST  of  TRIMALCHIO from  Petronius Arbiter  Compare it your self with the Original or shew it to Mr  Pope  or commit it to the Flames which you please But if you print it you may say it was design'd for the Entertainment of our present Mayor  Mr Alderman  Vere  Member of Parliament for  Norwich    Your humble Servant The TRANSLATOR  THE FEAST OF TRIMALCHIO Imitaded  From TITUS PETRONIUS ARBITER  Convivium Sybariticum  PRAELUDIUM  _THE present Age by a strange Revolution of Manners greatly resembles those Profligate Corrupt Debauched Vicious and Abandoned Times in which  Titus Petronius Arbiter  lived and of which he has given so warm and lively a Description in his  Satire  That part relating to the  Feast  of  Trimalchio  remained through the Injury of Time imperfect till within these Fourscore Years when some Fragments were found which compleated the Relation this is generally  thought to represent the Vices of  Nero  who having devoted himself to the Counsels of  Tigellinus  his sole Minister and Favourite a Man of obscure Birth and corrupt Principles did from the highest Expectancy become a stubborn and a foolish Tyrant There are some who think  Seneca  to be described under the Name of  Trimalchio  others  Tigellinus  in which view I shall at present take it altho' it is not so probable that he was the Person intended by  Petronius  in that Character  The FEAST of TRIMALCHIO  GLUTTED with the public Diversions of Theatres Amphitheatres and Bacchanalian Revels we visited the most Sacred Palaces of Monarchy and beheld with aweful Reverence the public Banquettings of these earthly Gods we saw the August Emperor at his Meals and we did see the People gape as he did eat I truly wondered that they should betray so much of the Imperfection of human Nature to the Multitude who by this might discover that Kings differed not at all from common Men The Luxury of the Nation encouraged no Entertainment which we did not partake of our Ears  were feasted with the most wanton and lascivious Strains of Instruments and Voices and we could perceive the Passions these Airs inspired in the Faces of an Hundred Beauties almost naked to the Waist and now we purposed to retire and enjoy a Week's Interval from the Fatigues of Pleasure when a Slave came to inform us that his Master  Caius Pompeius Trimalchio  invited us to a Repast where every Man might speak his mind He is says the Slave a Man of infinite Humour and a most excellent Politician I assure you Having drest our selves we bid him conduct us to his Master but in our way thither the streets were greatly thronged with Horsemen who had been hunting and were now returning from the Chace I was wholly taken up with the Homage that was paid to one of the Sportsmen and the Grandeur of his Equipage when  Menelaus  a Nobleman and one of his Attendants steps up to us presenting a Gentleman saying this is he with whom you are to dine  He was a portly Man somewhat Gouty and accosted every body with an affected Smile upon our Appearance he made an offer of alighting to receive us when the greater part of his Retinue dismounted in an instant some of them held his Bridle others took hold of his Stirrup  the rest bent their Backs reclined their Heads and threw themselves into the resemblance of so many HorseBlocks seeming to court his Foot to tread upon their Necks about which they wore a chain loose and careless to denote the pleasure they took in their Servitude You may imagine this Submission reduced the Cavalcade to some disorder for my part I was quite abashed having never seen the like so flung my self upon the Ground amongst the rest as did my Companions in which we were very lucky for I afterwards understood it was a Ceremony required of every body that were to be his Guests We were soon raised up mounted on led Horses and the Troop renewed it's former Order marching regularly into a CourtYard where we dismounted and walking to the Entrance of the Portico read this Inscription  If any Slave shall say  AYE  or  NO  contrary to the Will of his Master he shall be stript of his Livery and lose his Wages  At the entrance of the Hall was a Glass Room which I took to be the Porter's Lodge and admired the Contrivance but was presently convinced of my Mistake when raised by Pullies to the Roof I  discovered it to be a most stupendious Lanthorn  We advanced to the Staircase where a MarketPlace was described with Slaves setting upon Benches to the  right  and  left  to be BOUGHT and SOLD  Trimalchio  hard by with a Whip and Bridle a little farther was represented how he first learnt to spell and beyond that was  Mercury  holding him up by the Chin and placing him on a Throne  Fortune  presented him with a  Cornucopia  and the  three fatal Sisters  spun a Thread of Gold He was in different places painted as a Judge a General and a Priest the whole was excellently performed and highly finished surfeited with this fulsom Pageantry as we proceeded a Slave stript of his Livery cast himself at our feet imploring our Protection protesting his Fault was Inadvertency only that being roused from sleep and asked a question he knew nothing of he had said NO when he should have said YES We were saluted by him in the DiningRoom with thanks for the Obligation which he told us was well bestowed for says he the Wine my Lord drinks you shall anon find to be in the disposal of his Servants having viewed the Sideboard the huge Piles of massy Plate and spacious Cisterns double gilt on which  Trimalchio  's Arms and Name were engraven and it's weight markt on each peice we all seated ourselves except  Trimalchio  for whom the chief Place was reserved At the striking up of a Band of Music he made his Entrance  My Friends  says he  I have business to dispatch but came thus soon lest my Absence should make you uneasy  Now the Servants entered sweating beneath the ponderous Dishes which they seemed hardly able to support the flesh of Bulls Calves Sheep Deer and other Quadrupeds all Kinds of Fish and Fowl were stewed for the Juices they contained which blended into one Fluid formed a most delicious Soup Near in a golden Charger were an hundred mangled Vipers buried in their own blood in other Dishes were the Palates of  Cuckows  the Rumps of  WheatEars  the Brains of  Nightingales  Cavear of  Todpoles  an  Onocrotalon  the Hump of a  Camel  the Proboscis of an  Elephant  and a  Sow  's Paps I knew not a seventh part of this Course the greatest share of which was scrambled away before it could be distinctly viewed a Slave in the Hurry threw down a golden Dish and stooping to take it up  Trimalchio  gave him a sound Box on the Ear and ordered it to be swept out of the Room the Salvers rang and Wine went briskly round  when every body said something in praise of this Service this Applause was followed with a second and that indifferent considering the Place the Novelty of it however drew our Attention it was a round Table on which were placed the  twelve Signs  in their proper Order upon each of which the Disposer had put some thing suitable Upon ARIES was a  Sheep'sHead  upon TAURUS a  Chine  of  Beef  upon GEMINI  Lamb'sStones  and  Kidneys  upon CANCER a  DucalCoronet  upon LEO the  AfricanFruit  upon VIRGO  Sausages  upon LIBRA a  Pair of Scales  in the  one  a  Pudding  in the  other  a Panegyric upon SCORPIO a  Sprat  upon SAGITTARIUS a  Hare  upon CAPRICORN a  Lobster  upon AQUARIUS a  Goose  upon PISCES two  Mullets  and in the middle a Plate of  sweet Herbs  Now  Trimalchio  intreated us to be merry called for more Wine and larger Glasses the Company were highly elevated several Courses followed too nauseous and tedious to relate I asked one of the Guests who that  Woman  was that scutled up and down the Room her Name is FORTUNATA says he she is the Wife of  Trimalchio  she measures her Money by the Bushel and yet she sprang from a Dunghil not long since no Man would have touched her with a Pair of Tongs  now she is his Heaven his  all  in  all  what she says must be truth she's a  Wagtail  a meer  Shrew  a  Magpye  whom she loves she loves and whom she loves  not  she hates  Trimalchio  knows not half his Income nor extent of his Estate  The  Sun  himself surveys it not at once but travels for the view a  Crow  cannot fly over it in a Week he buys nothing yet owns the whole Town inhabits it all and is himself the People A twentieth part of his Tenants don't know their Landlord there are  Thirty  Degrees amongst his Servants he has  twentysix  DomesticChaplains and  three Orders  of his Favourites whom he teaches to jump over a Stick he is himself a Lover of Peace for when the  Alemains  and  Gauls  were at war he sent and desired to be Friends  Upon this another  Orator  arose and thus delivered himself The World the whole World cannot be ignorant of the Virtues of our Patron CAIUS The Government of Provinces the high Trusts and principal Employments of  Rome  are not bestowed by Favour but Merit nothing is now considered but Integrity and Worth What good Work is left undone The luminous Dignitaries of the Church the immortal Charges of the War the Trade and flourishing Opulency of the People the  increasing Glory and Grandeur of the State These our  Romans  shall record to Perpetuity the Honours of  Trimalchio  which consist not in his many eminent and great Employments but in his transcendent Liberality profound Policy and the ardent and unextinguished Love he bears his Country in whose uncorrupt hands we are as Counters and what just now stood for Millions shall at his pleasure dwindle to Cyphers We had now got our full Dose and were grown sick of this fulsom Slave when  Trimalchio  leaning on his Elbow thus spoke  This Wine  said he  is good and Fish should swim let's be merry and exercise our Lungs as well as Teeth Well  Peace be with my Master's bones  say I who made a Man of me You can tell me nothing which I don't know I never was outwitted for I am a thorough Master of the Practicks  Here he explained the  Heavens  by  Banquets  and shewed us the Influence of each  Sign  upon our Nativity Clapping our Hands and hollooing we rang an universal Peal to his Applause and swore all the  Philosophers  and  Astrologers  in the World were Fools to him upon this he called for his Will and order'd it to be read this set the whole Family in Tears and their howling was as grievous as their Joy before had been excessive  he repeated his Epitaph himself which he assured us was of his own composing no doubt says he you wonder how I became so Great considering my Age for these Teeth I lost when I was a Boy and I have prospered ever since I was ever bold and confident because a  Fortuneteller  inform'd me  how long I had to live  He run on thus for a great while when one behind thus whispered me This  Trimalchio  says he is a pitiful Scoundrel and his Retinue a Pack of Rascals he became the mighty despicable thing he is by Fawning Wriggling Whispering Intriguing Bargaining and Backbiting no honest Man can Eat Drink Sleep or enjoy the Light of the Sun without paying an EXCISE for the support of his Luxury as if the Gifts of Providence were at his sole Disposal Sir continued he I never would wish for a better Estate than the Property of Printing his  Last Dying Speech  This Fellow's Bluntness made me smile and the Company withdrawing to the Baths  Gito Ascyltos  and my self took this opportunity of stealing away unperceiv'd among the Croud  PLAUDITE  To Colonel WILLIAM STANHOPE  Now Earl of  Harrington  Oct  Dear SIR  THO' after addressing two Letters to you just before it may seem impertinent to trouble you so soon with a Third yet I cannot resist the Temptation of giving you Joy upon your  late Promotion  in which I hope you may find your  Interest  as well as your  Inclination gratified  While the rest of the World are  making their Court  upon  this Occasion  in  Town  I am content here in the  Country  to read the  Triumphs  of my FRIENDS twice a Week in the  Gazette  My  Ambition  at present is turned  quite another Way  and all  my humble Endeavours  are directed to  please  the FAIR There is a little  Papist Villain  in the Neighbourhood 'tis a Defect in our Language that the Termination of the  Adjective  doth not mark the  Gender  but you are to understand this in the  Foeminine  who hath robbed me of my  Heart  and I have scarce had an Hour's sound Sleep  except it was at  Church  these two Months I know that all this is  very ridiculous  and that an HALFPAY OFFICER ought no more to be in  Love  than a COMMON WHORE People of such  Precarious Subsistence  should give into no  Passion  that is not supported by  Gain  But when INDISCRETION cheats us in the Shape of PLEASURE  who can escape the Snare  I have  this Comfort  still in Reserve that as I have an HEART  entirely  ENGLISH it is odds I shall not continue Two Months longer in the  same Mind  There is  one  Instance however of my  Constancy  that will never I am sure be  impeached  I wish indeed it were not clogged with the  Obligations  you have laid upon me and then you would know it as much upon the Account of  your Personal Merit  as any  Favours  you have  conferred  on ME that I profess my self  SIR  Your most Faithful and Obedient Servant RICHARDSON PACK  To YOUNG LADY who told me the Army had no Religion and challenged me to show her a PRAYER that had been made by a Soldier  MADAM  IT was always with the greatest Attention that I received the Honour of your Commands and it is an equal Pleasure to me when I am employed to execute them But the Task you imposed upon me last Night was what I confess surprized me In a Visit where I hoped to have been entertained as a  Lover  I little expected to be consulted as a  Divine  nor did I believe you would have had the Curiosity instead of hearkening to the faithful  Vows  I was addressing to YOU to enquire about those I made to  Heaven  As St  Paul  became  All Things to All Men  that he might  gain some  so I find too I speak it under all the Restrictions of Modesty that a Man must become  All Things to all Women  if he would pretend to  succeed  with  any  It is an unaccountable Prejudice that prevails of late against our PROFESSION and particularly among the FAIR SEX who seem to judge that  Virtue  and  Vice  consist rather in the  Dress  of a TRIBE than the  Habit  of the MIND The PRAYER I send you inclosed which I give you my Word of Honour was made by a SOLDIER will I hope convince you there are some MILITARY MEN who deserve not to be  Excommunicated  from the  Chastest  DRAWINGROOMS I shall submit to your LADY MOTHER whether the AUTHOR or her CHAPLAIN be the better CASUIST of the Two But when the Question shall arise about a GALLANT I beg you to believe you'll never find one who is with more  Devotion  than my self  MADAM  Your most Faithful c RICHARDSON PACK  A SOLDIER'S PRAYER  O GOD thou Searcher of Hearts and Judge of all Men before whose awful Throne we should tremble to approach did not thy Mercy make thy Justice less terrible look down I beseech Thee with Favour and Compassion upon  me miserable Sinner Pardon my Offences and Pity my Infirmities Be not extreme to mark my Follies  For in thy sight shall no Man living be justified  Remember I am but poor Dust and Ashes the Child of Vanity and the Sport of Passions Without thy Aid O Lord all our Endeavours after Righteousness are fruitless all our Wisdom empty Pride all our Happiness Delusion Do thou enlighten therefore my Mind and sanctify my Heart that I may know and practise the Things that  belong to my Peace  Redeem me from the Bondage of my Sins and raise me to the Fellowship of thy Saints O let not the many and repeated Instances of my Guilt provoke thee to withdraw from me the Assistance of thy Holy Spirit But accept of my unfeigned Repentance second my Resolutions of Amendment and secure me from the Danger of a Relapse Particularly O Lord guard me from the Temptation of *******  Here mention those Sins to

signified to us that there is now a Treaty of Acquaintance on Foot between Dr  Swift  of  Leicesterfields  on the One part and Mrs  Long  of  Albemarlestreet  on the Other Part And whereas the said Dr  Swift  upon the Score of his Merit and extraordinary Qualities doth claim the sole and undoubted  Right  That all Persons whatsoever shall make such Advances to him as he pleases to demand any Law Claim Custom Privilege of Sex Beauty Fortune or Quality to the contrary notwithstanding  And whereas the said Mrs  Long  humbly acknowledging and allowing the  Right  of the  said Doctor doth yet insist upon certain Privileges and Exceptions as a Lady of the TOAST  These Verses were written by the late Earl of  Wharton  in the Year round one of the  Toasting Glasses  of the  KitCatClub  Fill

alledge are excepted out of the Doctor's general Claim and which she cannot betray without injuring the  whole Body  whereof she is a  Member  By which Impediment the said Treaty is not yet brought to a Conclusion to the great Grievance and Damage of Mrs  Van Homrigh  and her fair Daughter  Hessy  It was this Lady who occasioned the  Dean  's Poem intitled  CADENUS  and  VANESSA  And whereas the Decision of this weighty Cause is refered to Us in our  JudicialCapacity  We out of our tender Regard to Truth and Justice having heard and duly considered the Allegations of both Parties do declare adjudge decree and determine That the said Mrs  Long  notwithstanding  any Privileges she may claim as aforesaid as a Lady of the TOAST shall without  Essoîn  or  Demurr  in two Hours after the Publishing of this  Decree  make all Advances to the said Doctor that he shall demand and that the said Advances shall not be made to the said Doctor as  Un Homme sans Consequence  but purely upon Account of his great Merit  And We do hereby strictly forbid the said Mrs  Van Homrigh  and her fair Daughter  Hessy  to aid abet comfort to encourage her the said Mrs  Long  in her Disobedience for the future And in Consideration of the said Mrs  Long  's being a TOAST we think it just and reasonable that the Doctor should permit her in all Companies to give herself the Reputation of being  one

me in Print but how could I avoid it The Dead and the Living my Friends and my Foes at home and abroad call upon me to say something and the Reputation of an History which I and all the World value must have suffered had I continued silent I have printed  here  in hopes that somebody afterward may venture to reprint in  England  notwithstanding those two frightening Words at the Close of it  His Name  Whether that happens or not it is fit you should have a Sight of it who I know will read it with some degree of Satisfaction as it is mine tho' it should have as it really has nothing else to recommend it Such as it is  Extremum hoc munus morientis habeto  For that may well be the Case considering that within a few Months I am entring into my Seventieth Year after which even the Healthy and the Happy cannot much depend upon Life and will not if they are wise much desire it Whenever I go you will lose a Friend who loves and values you extremely if in my Circumstances I can be said to be lost to any one when dead more than I am already whilst living I expected to have heard from you by Mr  Morice  and wondered a little that I did not but he owns himself in a Fault for not giving you due Notice of his Motions It was not amiss that you forbore writing to me on a Head wherein I promis'd more than I was able to perform Disgraced Men fancy sometimes that they preserve an Influence where when they endeavour to exert it they soon see their Mistake I did so my good Friend and acknowledge it under my Hand You sounded the Coast and found out my Error it seems before I was aware of it but enough on this Subject  What are you doing in  England  to the Honour of Letters and particularly what are you doing  Ipse quid audes Quae circumvolitas agilis Thyma  Do you pursue the moral Plan  The Essay on Man  you marked out and seemed sixteen Months ago so intent upon Am I to see it perfected ere I die And are you to enjoy the Reputation of it while you live Or do you rather chuse to leave the Marks of your Friendship like the Legacies of a Will to be read and enjoy'd only by those who survive you Were I as near you as I have been I should hope to peep into the Manuscript before it was finished But alas there is and will ever probably be a great deal of Land and Sea between us How many Books have come out of late in your Parts which you think I should be glad to peruse Name them the Catalogue I believe will not cost you much Trouble They must be good ones indeed to challenge any Part of my Time now I have so little of it left I who squandred whole Days heretofore now husband Hours when the Glass begins to run low and care not to misspend them on Trifles At the End of the Lottery of Life our last Minutes like Tickets left in the  Wheel rise in their Valuation They are not of so much worth perhaps in themselves as those which preceded but we are apt to prize them more and with Reason I do so my dear Friend and yet think the most precious Minutes of my Life are well employ'd in reading what you write But this is a Satisfaction I cannot much hope for and therefore must betake myself to others  which  are less entertaining Adieu Dear Sir and forgive me engaging with one whom you I think have reckoned among the Heroes of the  Dunciad  It was necessary for me either to accept of his dirty Challenge or to have suffer'd in the Esteem of the World by declining it My Respects to your Mother I send a Paper for Dean  Swift  if you have an Opportunity and think it worth your while to convey it My Country at this Distance seems to me a strange Sight I know not how it appears to you who are in the midst of the Scene and yourself a Part of it I wish you would tell me You may write safely to Mr  Morice  by the honest Hand that conveys this and will return into these Parts before  Christmas  sketch out a rough Draught of it that I may be able to judge whether a Return to it be really eligible or whether I should not like the Chymist in the Bottle upon hearing Don  Quevedo  's Account  of  Spain  desire to be corked up again After all I do and must love my Country with all its Faults and Blemishes even that Part of the Constitution which wounded me unjustly and itself thro' my Side shall ever be dear to me My last Wish will be like that of Father  Paul Esto perpetua  and when I die at a Distance from it it will be in the same manner as  Virgil  describes the expiring  Peloponnesian  Sternitur dulces moriens reminiscitur Argos  Do I still live in the Memory of my Friends as they certainly do in mine I have read a good many of your Paper Squabbles about me and am glad to see such free Concessions on that Head tho' made with no View of doing me a Pleasure but merely of loading another  I am c FR ROFFEN  Bishop  ATTERBURY  's VINDICATION  Paris  Oct  I HAVE lately seen an Extract of some Passages in Mr  Oldmixon  's History of  England  The first of them is said to be taken from his Preface to that History  page  and runs in these Words  'I have in more than one Place of this History mentioned the great Reason there is to suspect that the History of the Rebellion as it was published at  Oxford  was not entirely the Work of the Lord  Clarendon  who did indeed write an History of those Times and I doubt not a very good one wherein as I have been I believe well inform'd the  Characters  of the  Kings  whose Reigns are written were different from what they appear in the  Oxford  History and its Copy Mr  Echard  's I speak this by Hearsay but  Hearsay from a Person superior to all Suspicion and too illustrious to be named  without Leave'  'I also humbly refer it to the Decision of  another very honourable Person  whether there is not to his Knowledge such an History in Manuscript still extant and  to a Reverend Doctor now living  whether he did not see the  Oxford  Copy by which the Book was printed altered and interpolated while it was at the Press'  'To which I must add that there is now in Custody of  a Gentleman of Distinction both for Merit and Quality  George Duckett  Esq  one of the Commissioners of the Excise  a History of the Rebellion of the first  Folio  Edition scored in many Places by Mr  Edmund Smith  of  ChristChurch Oxon  Author of that excellent Tragedy  Phaedra  and  Hippolytus  who himself alter'd the Manuscript History and added what he has there marked as he confessed with some of his last Words before his Death These Alterations written with his own Hand and to be seen by any one that knows it may be published on another Occasion with a farther Account  of this Discovery In the mean time for the Satisfaction of the Public I insert a Letter entire which I received since the last Paragraph was written'  To Mr *******  Oldmixon  SIR  'ACcidentally looking on some of the Sheets of your History of  England  during the Reigns of the Royal House of  Stuart  at the Bookseller's I find that you mention the History of Lord  Clarendon  wherein you justly question the Genuineness of that Book In order to put the Matter out of doubt I here send you the following Account'  'Mr  Edmund Smith  a Man very well known to the learned World came down to make me a Visit at *** about  June  where he continu'd till he died about six Weeks after'  'As our Conversation chiefly ran upon Learning and History you may easily think that  Clarendon  's was not forgotten Upon mentioning that Book he frankly told me that there had been a fine History  written by Lord  Clarendon  but what was published under his Name was only Patchwork and might as properly be call'd the  History of  ALSMALL  and  ATTERBURY  For to his Knowledge 'twas alter'd  nay  that he himself was employ'd by them to interpolate and alter the Original  '  'He then asked me whether I had the Book by me If I had he would  convince me of the Truth of his Assertion  by the very printed Copy I immediately brought him the  Folio  Edition and the first Thing he turned to was the Character of Mr  Hampden  where is that Expression He  had a Head to contrive a Heart to conceive and a Hand to execute any Villany  The Words are much softer in the History where instead of a  Heart to conceive  we find  a Tongue to persuade  and instead of the Word  Villany  that of  Mischief  as the Citation is in another Part of this Extract truly made The unknown Writer of this Letter while he is charging others with the Crime of falsifying Lord  Clarendon  's History should have taken care to stand clear of it himself  He then declared  it was foisted in by those Reverends  Sir I have only to add this that he not only  underlined  this Passage as a Forgery but gave during the short Time he lived with me  the same Remark to some Hundreds more'  I am SIR c  George Duckett  In a second Passage said to be taken from  page  of the History itself Mr  Oldmixon  is represented as expressing himself thus  'In the Character of this great and excellent Man Mr  Hampden  which we could wish had escaped his Lord  Clarendon  's Drawings or the Drawings of those clumsey Painters into whose Hands his Work fell there is something so very false and base that such Coin could only come from a College Mint  In a word what was said of  CINNA  might well be apply'd to  HAMPDEN  he had a Head to contrive  and  a Tongue to persuade  and  a Hand to execute any Mischief His Death therefore seemed to be a great Deliverance to the Nation  '  'There are not Words to express the  Infamy of this Slander and Imposture nor the unparallel'd Wickedness of those Doctors who foisted so horrid a Reflection into that Character  The Person who did it was  Mr  Edmund Smith  of  Oxford  Author of  Phaedra  and  Hippolytus  a Tragedy who at his Death confessed to the Gentleman in whose House he died that among a great Number of  Alterations  and  Additions  which he himself made in the  History of the Rebellion by Order of Doctor  ALDRICH  Doctor  ATTERBURY  and Doctor  SMALLRIDGE  successive Deans of  ChristChurch  this very saying of  CINNA apply'd to Mr  Hampden  was one and when he read it to  one of those Doctors  he clapped him on the Back and cry'd with an Asseveration  It will do  The Confession Mr  Smith  made and the Remorse he expressed for being concerned in this Imposture were his last Words'  A great Part of the first of these Passages including the Letter is translated  verbatim  into  French  and published in a Journal entitled  Bibliotheque Raisonnée des Ouvrages des Savans de l'Europe pour les Mois de Juillet Aoust Septembre    Tome    me    re Partie A  Amsterdam  chez les  Westeins Smith  Art    Page  c  After which the  Journalist  adds the  following Reflection  Cette decouverte fait peu d'honneur auxtrois Theologiens qui sont nommez dans la Lettre qui ont pourtant tenu un grand rang dans  l'Angleterre dans la Republique des Lettres Comme Mr  ATTERBURY  cidevant Evesque de  Rochester  l'un des trois est encore vivant il ne sera pas apparemment insensible a une accusation si grave le Public attend de lui les eclaircissemens que l'interest seul de sa reputation semble en exiger S'il se tait dans cette rencontre il n'y a point de doute que la falsification est prouvée quand mesme il ne ce tairoit pas il faut que les eclaircissemens soient bien forts pour detruire ces faits  This Discovery does little Honour to the three Divines named in the Letter  c  As Mr  ATTERBURY  heretofore Bishop of  Rochester  one of the Three is still living he will not probably be insensible of so grievous an Accusation and the Public expects from him such Accounts of it as even the Interest of his own Reputation seems to require If he is silent on this Occasion there can be no doubt but that the Falsification is proved and should he not be silent what he shall say to clear up this Matter must be very strong to destroy the Credit of such a Testimony  Being called upon in this public Manner I myself obliged to declare that the foregoing Account in all its Parts as far as I am any ways concerned is entirely  false and groundless for I never saw my Lord  Clarendon  's History in Manuscript either before or since the Edition of it nor ever read a Line of it but in Print It was impossible therefore that I should deal with Mr  Smith  in the Manner represented with whom as far as I can recollect I never exchanged one Word in all my Life and whom I know not that I ever saw till after the Edition of that History If therefore he expressed himself to this Purpose in his last Moments as I charitably hope he did not he wronged me extremely and died with a Lie in his Mouth  This Vindication of the Truth and myself is necessary since I happen to survive the two other worthy Persons mentioned Were they alive they would I doubt not be equally able and ready to clear themselves from so foul an Aspersion As to one of them Dr  Smallridge  the late Bishop of  Bristol  no Suspicion of this kind can possibly rest on his Memory because he was not any ways concerned in preparing that History for the Press but as much a Stranger to the Contents of it as I myself was till it came forth in Print I speak with the more Assurance on this Head because my great Intimacy with him as my Contemporary both at  Westminster  and  ChristChurch  gave me all the Advantages  requisite towards knowing the Truth of what I say With Dr  Aldrich  the third Person accused I was acquainted more at a distance However being called upon in the Manner I am I will add also what has come to my Knowledge with regard to the Share He and Others had in the Publication of that History  The Revising of the Manuscript written as I have heard not very correctly was committed to the Care of Bishop  Sprat  and Dean  Aldrich  by the late Earl of  Rochester  who himself also assisted in that Revisal from the Beginning to the End of the Work So that any Changes made in it must have had the Consent of those three Persons They were Men of Probity and Truth and incapable of conspiring in a Design to impose on the Publick I can cite nothing that is material in this Point from the Mouth of the  Earl  with whom I rarely conversed but the  Bishop  and the  Dean  to whom I severally succeeded in the Deaneries of  ChristChurch  and  Westminster  and in the See of  Rochester  have occasionally more than once assured me that no Additions whatsoever were made to the Manuscript History And even the  Earl  in his Preface to the first Volume for His I take it to be tho' no Name is affixed to it has publickly protested his Innocence  in this respect where he declares that  They who put forth the History  he means himself and his Brother as appears from what follows  durst not take upon them to make any Alterations in a Work of this Kind solemnly left with them to be published whenever it should be published as it was delivered to them  Could he and the two other Persons by him employed be supposed to have made any Additions notwithstanding such Assurances to the contrary yet their good Sense if not their Integrity would have prevented at least their retouching those  Characters  which are allowed to be the most distinguished and beautiful Part of the Work and to have something of Original in them that is not to be imitated The Afterstrokes of any less able Pencil intermix'd with those of the first Masterly Hand would soon be discovered And yet I am persuaded the most discerning Eye can find out no Traces of such a Mixture no not in the Character of Mr  Hampden  even in those Words at the Close of it against which Mr  Oldmixon  so warmly declaims They are perfectly in the Style and Manner of my Lord  Clarendon  they contain nothing new in them but only sum up in short what he had scattered through different Parts of the two first Volumes Let the Reflections there made be never so  severe they may naturally be supposed in the Warmth of Composure to have come from the Pen of an Historian who had himself with Zeal opposed Mr  Hampden  's Measures and both seen and felt the sad Consequences of them But that the Editors of his History no ways concerned in those Transactions should Years afterwards coolly and deliberately make such a needless Insertion is not to be imagined  The Complaint on this and other Heads should have been brought against these Editors while it was capable of being thoroughly examined at present it comes a little too late unless it were better supported Their very Characters to those who knew them and the Nature of the Evidence to those who did not will be judged a sufficient Confutation of it For pray what is this Evidence It consists in an  Hearsay from a Person superior to all Suspicion  it seems but  too illustrious to be named  In an Appeal to  another very honourable Person  to  a Reverend Doctor now living  and  to a Gentleman of Distinction both for Merit and Quality  none of whose Names are thought fit to be owned The only one produced in the Case is that of Mr  Smith the Author of an excellent Tragedy  but certainly not an Author of Rank and Weight enough to blast the Credit of  such an excellent History Of what Use can this Testimony be to his Purpose even supposing the Account of it exact when it is undoubtedly false as to two of the three Persons it is levelled at Dr  Smallridge  and myself and may therefore be justly presumed alike false as to the third Dr  Aldrich  Mr  Smith  appears to have been so little in the Secret of the Edition of that Book as not to have known even the Hands thro' which it passed and is not therefore to be rely'd upon in his Accounts of any other Circumstances relating to it especially with regard to Dr  Aldrich  his Governor at  ChristChurch  for whom his Personal Aversion and the true Reasons of it are too well understood to need explaining I forbear saying any thing harsh of one not able to answer for himself but many now alive who knew them both know how improbable and altogether incredible it is that Mr  Smith  should have had the least Share in Dr  Aldrich  's Confidence on so nice or indeed on any Occasion The Gentleman who seems to be  convinced of the Truth of Mr  Smith  's Assertions  by his having pointed out and  underlined  the Passages  in Print  which he said he was employ'd by the three successive Deans to  interpolate and alter  in Manuscript must surely have been very willing  to be convinced otherwise he would not have taken a mere  Assertion  for a Proof in such a Cause and from such a Person The Story of this Deathbed Declaration slept for about twenty Years near thirty have passed since the History of the Rebellion was published I mean the first Part of it and not a few since the Death of every Person that either was or is falsly said to have been concerned in that Publication myself only excepted I might probably at the Distance of  Montpelier  where I was when Mr  Oldmixon  wrote never have heard of what he lays to my Charge Intelligence of that kind being as he knows not very open to me or should it reach me I might yet in my present Circumstances be supposed not oversollicitous to appear in the Disproof of it The Delay of the Accusation therefore if without Design was not without its Advantages and had it been deferred a little longer till I was not only out of the Way but out of the World it had had a still fairer Chance towards being uncontradicted and consequently credited I have lived to hear this idle Tale and to bear witness against it There is no Vanity in hoping that old as I am I shall outlive the Belief of it An  Holland  Journal gave me the first Notice how I had been treated and by that Means  an Opportunity of vindicating myself which I was the rather determined not to decline because I suffer'd in Company with others Men of great Note and Merit thro' whose Sides the Authority of a noble and useful Part of our  English  History was struck at Where I only am aspersed and wrong'd I can I thank God more easily practise Patience and submit to Indignities and Injuries in Silence A foreign Writer has used me in this Case with greater Civility and Temper than Mr  Oldmixon  whom I know not that I have ever offended I forgive him his ill Words and his hard Thoughts and only desire him for the future not to indulge himself in illnatur'd Relations of this Kind without better Vouchers His Attack on me and on the Dead who he thought might be insulted with equal Safety is no Proof of a generous and worthy Mind nor has he done any Honour to his own History by the fruitless Pains he has taken to discredit that of my Lord  Clarendon  which like the Character of its Author will gain Strength by Time and will be in the Hands and Esteem of all Men when Mr  Oldmixon  's unjust Censure of it will not be remembered or not regarded  FR ROFFEN  To *****  Dear SIR  YOUR Endeavours that I may forget my Misfortunes are truly Noble It would be to deserve them to fly from Resolution They shall not depress me but I must help to bear what you tell me lies so heavy upon my Friends I preserve a Mean which is the Excellence Justice and Fitness of all things in the Moral System  Virtue's a Mean and Vice is an Excess  In doing more than's fit or doing less  To Poetise my Friend is no Mark of a depressed Fancy or excessive Sorrow but a sort of a Comical Way of treating things serious not after the subtle Fashions of those you speak of that would magnify Nature by depressing the Deity who setting forth their necessary Agreement make unnecessary Strife with Reverence do I mention these things and know  How the great Love of Nature fills thy Mind  And Universal Kindness to thy Kind  I am while thus Juvenile an Advocate for and not a Railer against Extremes these Symptoms strongly bode a second Youth that vapours with a feeble and defective Flame it is the innervated Arm of  Priam  impotently raised against the thundering Rage of youthful  Pyrrhus  However this Epistle my Dear Friend shall not become more tawdry by its not being of a Piece for I will conclude with answering your last serious Question with another Scrap of Poetry  Whate'er the Soul of Nature has design'd  And wrought on Matter is the Effect of Mind  The Form of Substance is the Former's Art  Hence Beauty and Design that strike the Heart  There's nought in simple Matter to delight  'Tis the fair Workmanship that takes the Sight  The beautiful Effect of Mind alone  Is comely and in all things comely shown  Where Mind is not there Horror needs must be  For Matter formless is Deformity  EXTRACTS of several ORIGINAL LETTERS written about the Year by Bishop  Atterbury  to an ingenious  French  Gentleman for whom he had a great Esteem  THE Book  Memoirs Reflexions  Sur les principaux Evenemens du Regne de  Louis XIV  I now restore you gave me Pleasure when I read it The Turn is Natural and Familiar and there is an Air of Truth in all he says but I think not the Hand of a Master He tells his Tale not like a Man who knows any thing of the Rules of Writing well but as an easy Companion at a Table I say of his Style what he says of his Figure  Ma figure qui n' êtoit pas déplaisante quoique je ne fusse pas du premier Ordre des Gens bien faits  ie My Figure which did not displease tho' I could not be ranked among handsome People of the first Class Tho' not of the first or even second order  of good Writers he is yet agreeable I cannot possibly digest his taking Notice p of the  Chevalier de Rohan  's fine Legs An Observation that I should have expected rather from the Pen of a fine Lady and which shews that the  Marquis  was in his Nature a little too intent on such Trifles He is sensible of it and excuses himself in the Words which follow but that Excuse serves only to shew the Strength of the Impression he was under in this respect since he had Judgment enough to see the Fault and commits it notwithstanding Though I see he is manifestly piqu'd against  Lewis  XIV and his Minister  Louvois  yet I am apt to believe him in all he says of both of them His Resentment seems to carry him no farther than to give him the Privilege of speaking what he knew to be true and as the World goes he that allows himself to censure the Great even thus far must say a great deal of Ill of them  Of several  French  Poets he speaks thus  Rousseau  appears to me still a greater Poet the more I consider him His Talents are unconfined and enable him in every sort of writing to which he turns himself equally to excel But the old hard Words he makes use of puzzle me often who care not to consult a Dictionary and chiefly in his Allegories  Chaulieu La Fare  and  Chapelle  have many Graces of the easy and natural Style but I do not think them so perfect in their way as  Rousseau  is in his nor to tell you the Truth do I take such Pleasure in reading them The Letters particularly of  Chaulieu  c are not Masterpieces in their kind and many of his little Copies of Verses have nothing extraordinary in them The Copy which touched me most is the Ode on  Fontenay  Muses qui dans ce lieu champetre c  I cannot but observe that under all  Chaulieu  's seeming Gaiety there is an Air of Melancholy which breaks out by Fits and shews he was not at Ease in his own Mind He endeavours to conceal it and acts the Brave but his Readers with a little Penetration may see through the Disguise The Fears of Death haunt him perpetually and appear even in those Places where he says he is not afraid of it I should be glad to know how he died whether with the same Courage he commends in Lady  Mazarine  I should guess not by the Observations I have made of him  After perusing a Dissertation of Mr  de Boze  the Bishop makes the following Remark  This Book I find was written two and thirty Years ago and therefore it is no wonder  that it should not be equal to the later Performances of the same Author One may say of it as  Tully  speaks of his Collection of Paradoxes  Non tale est hoc opus ut in arte poni possit quasi illa Minerva Phidiae sed tamen ut ex eâdem officinâ exisse appareat  Though it be not of the same Value with his other Works yet it is such as that one may perceive the same Workman's Hand and Skill in it He chose a little contracted Subject and had not Room therefore to shew his Talents at full length in managing it And yet narrow and dry as his Subject is he has by making several little Digressions and by taking Occasion to say many things which were not necessary to his Point rendered it not only instructive but entertaining  In tenui labor at tenuis non gloria si quem  Numina laeva sinunt auditque vocatus Apollo  Whether his forth  Gordean  be a Reality or a Phantom whether he owes his very being to this Gentleman or is only rescued from Oblivion and brought again to Life by him let the Antiquaries determine I am so easy and indolent as not to think it of much Moment which Way such Facts are settled nor should I have thought what is written on this Point worth reading if this Author had not writ it In all  he writes one sees the same Candor and Impartiality the same Learning good Sense and Exactness If the Argument he handles be not of Importance he makes it so by his manner of handling it So that I could wish instead of four Books he had written forty as old as I am and as many other things as I have to do I should read all of them I have perus'd  says the Bishop in another Letter  the Book about  This is the Work intitled  Reflexions critiques sur la Poesie la Peinture  by  Abbé du Bos  A new Edition of it with Corrections and Additions has been published by the Author since the writing of this Letter  Poetry and Painting with Attention It is written in a very good Goût and has excellent things in it I have been pleased with no Book so much that has fallen in my way since I came into  France  However I could wish those philosophical Reasonings had been omitted they belong rather to a Member of the Academy of Sciences than to one of the Forty and perhaps will neither convince nor please in such a Performance The Author seems to have gone too deep in that sort of Reflections and sometimes not to have gone deep enough in others which relate more immediately and naturally to his Subject Forgive this Freedom but it  is my real sense of the Matter Besides there is I think a want of Method in the whole  The Author has changed the Order and Disposition of his Work in the last Edition of it  and the th Section which is so long is to me a little obscure The many learned Citations there do not clear but cloud the Author's Meaning I am apt to imagine that in the musical Part of it he speaks of what he does not himself thoroughly understand for if he does he would probably have expressed himself so that his Reader also would have understood it which as to me at least is not the Case In one thing I differ from him essentially my fixed Opinion is that the Reputation of all Books which are perfectly well writ comes Originally from the Few and not from the Many and I think I could say a good deal in Defence of that Opinion I see him here and every where under the Image of  Urbani parcentis viribus atque  Extenuantis eas consultò  He seldom speaks out where he is likely to offend but contents himself oftentimes rather to infinuate than affirm and makes  use of other Mens Words to express his own Sense where he is unwilling too openly to own it or too strongly to press it  Ab arte suâ non recessit  as  Tully  says of  Aristoxenus  Even in his Judgment of the  Belles Lettres  he plays the Politician I could not but observe how in the last Section but one he has furnished Mr  de Voltaire  with the Hint of his Poem on the  Ligue  Upon the whole I repeat my Thanks to you for the great Satisfaction which the reading of these  The last Edition is in Three Volumes  two Volumes has given me As to Mr  Arnauld  's Piece intitled  Reflexions sur l'Eloquence  though what he says there be sensible and just yet I do not see much of the great Man in it and had no great Pleasure in perusing it  The following Remarks are made upon Mr  Fontenelle  's Manner of Writing  c  I return you Sir the two Eloges which I have perused with Pleasure I borrow that Word from your Language because we have none in our own that exactly expresses it By the Account I had of those Pieces I imagined them very different from what I find them Mr  Fontenelle  's Talents as to the Knowledge of Nature Mathematicks and the  Belles Lettres  are sufficiently understood  But I take notice particularly of the Art and Address with which he conducts himself in nice Points and the prudent and political Views by which his Pen is guided a Quality that does not often belong to Men who have spent so much of their time in studying the Arts and Sciences He has been misinformed as to one little Particular in the short Draught he has given us of Sir  Isaac Newton  's Figure The  The very lively and piercing Eye  oeil fort vif fort perçant  which he gives him did not belong to him at least not for twenty Years past about which time I first came acquainted with him Indeed in the whole Air of his Face and make there was nothing of that penetrating Sagacity which appears in his Composures He had something rather languid in his Look and Manner which did not raise any great Expectation in those who did not know him I see Mr  Fontenelle  speaks warily as to the MSS relating to Antiquity History and Divinity which Sir  Isaac  left behind him I wish for the Honour of our Country that they may be as excellent in their Kind as those he published But I fear the Case is otherwise and that he will be found to have been a great Master only  in that one way to which he was by Nature inclined It is enough for us poor limited Creatures if we remarkably excel in any one Branch of Knowledge We may have a Smattering of more but it is beyond the Lot of our Nature to attain any Perfection in them Mr  Fontenelle  's Praise of Sir  Isaac  's Modesty and of Modesty in general is to me the most pleasing Part of that Description he has given us of him It is that Modesty which will teach us to speak and think of the Antients with Reverence especially if we happen not to be thoroughly acquainted with them Sir  Isaac  certainly was and his great Veneration for them was one distinguishing Part of his Character which I wonder or rather I do not wonder that Mr  Fontenelle  has omitted His Opinion of them was that they were Men of great Genius and superior Minds who had carried their Discoveries particularly in Astronomy and other Parts of Mathematicks much farther than now appears from what remains of their Writings One may apply to them what was said by an old learned Man to one of less Knowledge and fewer Years who insulted him  I have forgot more Knowledge than ever you had  More of the Antients is lost than is preserved and perhaps our new Discoveries are not equal to those old Losses  But this was not what I had in my Thoughts when I sat down to write my Intention was only to express the Satisfaction I had in the Perusal of what I return of which I could say more if the End of the Page did not admonish me to tell you how much I am c  The Book intitled  Dissertation sur la Musique des Anciens  By the Abbé  de Chateneuf  I send you back is written in a very sensible and agreeable Manner with a fine Turn of Thoughts and Words as far as I am able to judge I could wish only that the Writer had been a greater Master of his Subject so as to have given us distincter and fuller Accounts of it which would have left no Doubts upon the Minds of his Readers I am satisfied that a Pen like his would have been able to express the most nice and difficult Points of which he treats in a Way equally instructive and pleasing and have opened to us in Dialogue the Mysteries of Music as easily and familiarly as Monsieur  Fontenelle  has done those of Astronomy The Picture of  Leontium  with which the Reflections conclude is exquisitely drawn not only  con Studio  but  con Amore  as the  Italians  speak of the favourite  Pieces of their best Masters One would think the Book was written on purpose for the sake of the Character at the End of it as the most material Part of a Letter is sometimes carelesly thrown into a Postscript I dare say  Madamoiselle  A celebrated  French  Actress  Lenclos  was of the Author's Acquaintance Hearsay could not have furnished him with so lively a Description of her There is something in the Picture that shews it was painted by the Life and not copied from another One thing he says of her P pardon the Remark seems in some degree applicable to himself His Words are very good and therefore I transcribe them  Son gout en le conduisant de fleur en fleur comme les Abeilles lui fait courir indifferemment tous les pays tous les siecles Mais ces sortes d'imaginations si legeres si brillantes a dedaignent pour l'ordinaire le travail d'attention Un esprit né pour les agremens qui n'a jamais sacrifié qu'aux Graces n'a garde de s'assujetir à la patience qui seroit necessaire pour comparer les beautés d'un tems avec celles d'une autre pour étudier les rapports les oppositions qui sont entre elles pour les tourner de tous les sens dont on peut les envisager  ensin pour y rapporter la triste penible exactitude que demande une parallele  ie  His Taste guiding him from Flower to Flower like the Bees makes him rove indiscriminately through all Countries and all Ages But these kind of very sprightly and shining Imaginations generally disdain a Labour that requires Attention A Genius born for Charms and which has never sacrificed but to the Graces can never subject itself to the Patience that would be necessary in order for comparing the Beauties of one Age with those of another to study the Relations and Oppositions that are between them to view them in all the Lights in which they can be considered in sine to bestow upon them the melancholy and painful Exactness which is requisite for the forming of a Parallel  Let me ask you for my own Information whether  tourner de tous les sens  be a proper Phrase in that Case To me it seems to spoil the Metaphor He cites some Authorities which I am at a Loss to explain particularly p that of  Varro de Repub Rom L    C  Sure he does not mean the antient  Varro  who wrote nothing that I know of under that Title He is beholden I find to the long Chapter of  Abbé du Bois  where the antient Authorities relating to his Subject are collected and he has  made a free Use of them But my Intention was to tell you rather what pleased me in the Book than what I disliked  From what I have read in these Books and other Pieces since I came on this side of the Water I have conceived a much greater Opinion of the Bishop of  Meaux  than I had while in  England  and give him readily the Preference to all those Writers of the Church of  France  which I am acquainted with He is an universal Genius and manages every thing he takes in Hand like a Master Good Sense and sound Reflections attend all he says which is expressed in the most agreeable and beautiful Manner without any of the Pomp or Paint of false Oratory He has particularly the Secret of knowing not only what to say but what not to say the hardest Task even of the most exact and excellent Writers But you know him Sir better than I and I should be to blame therefore in attempting any Part of his Character did not Gratitude forbid me to return your Books without giving you an Account of the Pleasure I had in perusing them Even the Lady's Memoirs relating to our  English  Princess gave me a good deal particularly that Part of them where the Story of her Death is told in as natural and affecting a Manner  I think as is possible It has such a melancholy Air of Truth in it as at the same Time that it gives Conviction moves Compassion and one can no more read it than one could have been present at the sad Scene of it without Tears I really prefer the Bishop of  Meaux  's Funeral Oration to those of  Flechier  or  Bourdaloüe  tho' I think he would have wrote still better had he imitated them less for by that means he now and then heightens his Expression a little too much and becomes unnatural I gave you one Instance of that when I saw you last  The more I read of the Bishop of  Meaux  the more I value him as a great and able Writer and particularly for that Talent of taking as many Advantages of an Adversary and giving him as few as any Man I believe that ever entered the Lists of Controversy There is a serious Warmth in all he says and his manner of saying it is noble and moving and yet I question after all whether he sometimes is in good Earnest Pardon that Freedom Sir I have read him with Attention and watched him narrowly I have read all the Bishop of  Meaux  's  Pieces  that have been procured for me and will wait for the rest till I can have them from your Hands In the mean time I will read  worse Books that I may relish his the more when I return to them tho' to speak the Truth I know no Writer in your Tongue that has less need to have his Reader so prepared for him Do you hear nothing from your Friend  Voltaire  Is  England  as well pleased with him as it was And is he as well pleased with  England  Or does the Satisfaction on one side abate in Proportion as it lessens on the other When will the second Edition of his  Henriade  come out Will it afford us a better Monument to the Memory of that Prince and a nobler Likeness than the Statue on  Pontneuf  It will if it be as well finished as it should be For  Non magis expressi vultus per ahenea signa  Quàm per vatis opus mores animique virorum  Clarorum apparent  But the Spirit of Pedantry is coming upon me and it is time therefore that I tell you I am c  I find the very last Works of that great Man  the Bishop of  Meaux are inferior to the rest but nevertheless I would be Master of all he certainly wrote It is useful to observe even the Defects of Firstrate Writers as well as their Excellencies There is an illnatured Pleasure in  finding that as far exalted above us as they are they sometimes sink down to our Level The Bishop of  Meaux  studied Critical Knowledge late with respect to the Interpretation of Scripture and was never therefore so true a Master of it as he was of the Way of interpreting it by the Stream of Tradition But the older he grew the more admired he was and that led him to think himself equal to every Man in every thing and particularly to write Books in  Latin  and Comments on Scripture in both which ways I find him unequal to himself and I dare say that is the Opinion of candid and judicious Persons in your Communion  Our Friend Father  Courayer  has been pursued with Mandements Censures and Arrêts nor have they I fear yet done with him I am concerned for the Fate of so valuable a Man and so excellent a Writer whose Views I am persuaded were innocent and good however in the Manner of executing them he comes to have given so much Offence The twenty Bishops that have censured him seem to decline that Part of the Dispute which relates to the Validity of our  English  Ordinations However they have not spared the Church of  England  on other Accounts but have represented her  in a more disadvantageous Light than she deserves purely I suppose for want of knowing her They cite the Bishop of  Meaux  and cite those Works of his which were written expresly against us which surely is a very odd Way of representing our Sentiments just as if I should quote Monsieur  Claude  's Words from any Pieces of his written against the Church of  France  to prove what she held in any Doctrine of Importance I should think it became me rather to produce the Writers of that Church and the Acts and Monuments of it for my Vouchers The twenty Bishops have taken this Method once or twice and if they had taken it always they would have been less liable to Mistakes in their Representations of us What the Bishop of  Meaux  says with regard to our Polity and Affairs is not always to be rely'd on for he was not a Master of that Subject He was a very great Man nor would he have lessened his Character not to have aimed sometimes at seeming to know what he really did not in Matters that lay a little out of his Compass Excuse the Freedom I take with the Censurers and the Authority on which they build in relation to our Matters because I have good Reason to think that they have paid a Deference to it at the Expence of Truth My Knowledge  is very limited and yet it would be no Presumption in me to say that I know better than the Bishop of  Meaux  did what is the Constitution and what are the Principles and Tenets of the Church of  England  But enough of these Reflections into which the Mention of Father  Courayer  has led me  FR ROFFEN  This great Man suffered the Rigours of his Exile by Study and Conversation with Men of Learning and kept a constant Correspondence by Letters with the most eminent Scholars and Persons of Genius  He translated  Virgil  's  Georgics  into  English  and wrote an  Harmonia Evangelica  in a New and more perspicuous Method than any yet extant He sent his Version of the  Georgics  to a Friend with the following Verses  viz  Haec ego lusi  Ad Sequanae ripas

 England  and interred on the th of  May  following in his Vault in  Westminster Abbey  His Bowels were in an Urn thus inscribed  In hac Urnâ depositi sunt cineres  FRANCISCI ATTERBURY  Episcopi Roffensis  TO His Excellency the Right Honourable THOMAS Lord PARKER Lord High Chancellor of GREATBRITAIN one of his Majesty's Lords Justices LONDON  Henley near Ludlow  Aug  MY LORD  I Taking  London  in my Way between  Lewes  and  Kingston  came to your Lordship's House the Morning before I went to  Kingston  but your Lordship was then sitting I did then intend to have informed your Lordship of what occurred in the Circuit thitherto relating to the Publick especially in  Kent  and after I came from  Kingston  I found your Lordship was gone out of Town and before your Return I set out for my Countryconcerns here in  Shropshire  'till near next Term so that what Account I give your Lordship must be by Letter  Tho' your Lordship has heard how the Verdict went in the Tryal at  Rochester  Occasioned by a CharitySermon preached there by one  Hendley  of  Istington  He died not long after  yet perhaps it may not be unacceptable to your Lordship to have some Abstract of the Matter arising in it I began at six in the Morning by my Appointment and held till twelve The Court was very full of Clergymen and a great Auditory and I gave both Sides Liberty to expatiate as they pleased especially the Defendants that they might not say but that they had a full and fair Tryal Most of the Witnesses for the Prosecution were unwilling and did prove the Facts but meanly but afterwards the Witnesses for the Defendants did upon questioning prove all the Facts very fully upon all the Defendants viz  Hendley  the Preacher the Schoolmaster and the two Collectors being all who were served with Process Serjeant  Comins  Sir  Const Phipps  and Mr  Blunden  Defendants after an Harangue upon the Vertue of Charity and how essential to Christianity tho' I thought the Texts they cited proved another sort of Charity viz GoodNature and GoodNeighbourhood but I thought it not proper then to take Notice of the Distinction they insisted chiefly  That it would discourage all Charity and CharitySchools which would thus be in Danger of Subversion  That every Parson might order Collections in his own Parish for what Charities he please especially if approved of by the Bishop  That the Rubrick in the Communion Service a CommonPrayer Book being produced in Court does imply that the Parson and the Bishop are intrusted in Collections of Charity in the Church for it says that if the Parson and Churchwardens disagree in the Distribution the Bishop shall determine  That the Parson of the Parish and also the Bishop of  Rochester  did give  Hendley  Leave to preach this Sermon for this Purpose  That tho' the Sermon was done yet the Prayer for the holy Catholic Church at the Communion Table was not quite finished as were not also the Sentences for exciting Charity when Mr  Farrington  the Justice of Peace interrupted the Collection  That the two present Archbishops have preached CharitySermons in  London  for the Children of other Parishes there  That there is no Precedent of such an Indictment ever before  Too much Time was spent on both Sides relating to what Power the Bishops had antiently in the Distribution even of  Tythes and Profits relating to the Church and their Rights to licence Preaching and to direct what is to be done in Churches and that Laymen are not to intermeddle there  Serjeant  Darnel  Mr  Baines  and Mr  Marsh  were  pro Rege  The Substance of what they all said is herein mentioned intermixed with my own Thoughts in my summing up to the Jury  I first said that there were three Things much insisted on by the Defendants Counsel and answered by the Counsel on the other Side which I thought ought to be pared off and put out of the Case  viz  All Jealousy of discouraging all Charity and CharitySchools for that they remained just as they were before as long as they kept within the Bounds of their proper Parishes But tho' this Case was quite of a different Nature relating to arbitrary Collections and that in other Parishes and the coming of fifty Boys and Girls together begging for that Purpose and if this was practised it might do more Harm to CharitySchools by making them odious to their Parishes whose Poor would be injured by lessening the Charity to them  It ought to be put out of the Case whether Mr  Hendley  was authorized to preach there or not for that I thought  it the same Case if the Parson of the Parish himself had then preached It was at my Tongue's End  if the Bishop himself had preached  as indeed it was the same but I thought it better not to heat the Question by a Supposal of the Bishop's preaching for that the Preaching was not the Point being used only to excite giving but the true Point was whether the Collection was without lawful Authority and therefore the Collecting of it in the Church is not a Jot better in Point of Law than if the fifty Boys and Girls had stood at the Marketplace and the Collectors had there received the Charity of whom they could assemble about them  Another Matter I thought proper to be pared off tho' so much debated on both Sides whether it was a Crime I suppose the Crime suggested in the Bishop of  Rochester  's Court to interrupt the Collection before the Prayer for the holy Catholic Church and the Sentences for Charity were fully read since they thought that if such Collecting is an unlawful Act the proper Time to stop it is just when it begins or soon after as here was done by Mr  Farrington  for otherwise CommonPrayer or a Sermon might be used to justify and give a Sanction to any unlawful Act and this Stop might as well have  been in the Middle of the CommonPrayer or of the Sermon in case the unlawful Collection had then begun so that the true Point is whether the Collection was unlawful and upon that all the Case depends  As for the Assertion that every Parson of a Parish may order Collections in his Parish for Charities when and for what he pleases I declared my Opinion that he could not it not being any Part of his Function like reading Prayers Preaching Christening Burying  c  nd I knew not how he was made Judge of the Times and Objects of all Charities within his Parish tho' he might preach as much as he pleased upon the general Duty of Charity  As to the Rubrick in the Communion Service I said I thought that was to be taken  secundum subjectam materiam  viz the ordinary Collection at the Communion which is ever then used to be made for the Poor of that Parish but should not extend to every Collection the Parson should appoint for any foreign Charity and that I did not till now hear that the Clergy did claim such a Power And farther I said that I thought those Words of the Rubrick did not imply such a Power in the Parson for the Words being the Money given at the Offering shall be disposed of to such  pious and charitable Uses as the Parson and the Churchwardens shall think fit wherein if they disagree it shall be disposed of as the Ordinary shall appoint Such a Power of appointing a Collection at Pleasure is as much implied in the Churchwardens as in the Parson for they have as much Liberty to disagree from the Parson in the Distribution as the Parson has to disagree from them and so the Churchwardens might also appoint Collections for what Charities they pleased but that I thought that the Parson and Churchwardens either jointly or severally could not appoint any Collection for Charity otherwise than in common Form for the Poor of their own Parish and that those are the charitable Uses intended by the Rubrick and particularly at the Communion to the Service of which those Words of the Rubrick are subjoined I hope your Lordship on reading that Part of the Rubrick at the End of the Communion Service will be of my Opinion which I then suddenly declared as to the Implication and do not since alter unless otherwise convinced  As to what was mentioned of the two present Archbishops it was for the Poor of the same Town tho' of a different Parish and all the Circumstances of those  Cases do not now appear nor were they litigated as this Case is  As to the Objection that there is no Precedent of such an Indictment ever before  SolThere never was such an Attempt before that fifty Boys and Girls should go into another Parish in another County and make a kind of Migration in such a Body really begging tho' with great Formality And tho' much might be said as the Counsel for the King insisted to bring them within the Statute of Vagrants especially seeing the Stat of  Eliz  C Paragr says That all Persons calling themselves Scholars going about begging shall be accounted Vagrants yet I judged it not proper to put the Case upon that Point when I thought it so clear otherways and fit so to be mentioned  I also told the Jury that this Case did consist of two Parts the first but particular and the other very general  As to the particular it is relating to the Maintenance of the Poor which is not of a Spiritual Nature but a mere LayConcern and relating to the Civil Government and the several Acts of Parliament do plainly esteem it as such by ordering the Rates and Collections for the Poor and  putting the whole Managment into the Lay Hands of the Justices of the Peace and the Overseers of the Poor who are to be nominated by the Justices of the Peace and accountable to them and by their Directions to set the Poor at Work if they thought proper and therefore a Justice of Peace being then in the Church might well take it to be a Matter within his Jurisdiction and that he might stop such a new and extraordinary Proceeding newly begun among the Clergy relating to the Maintenance of the Poor and a Collection made by Strangers without the Consent or Assistance of the Churchwardens or Overseers of the Poor of that Parish  But this Case if under a general Consideration is of a vast Extent and mighty Consequence to the King and the People and at which the very Legislature may take great Umbrage The levying of Money is the tenderest Part of our Constitution and if it may be done arbitrarily under the Shew and Form of Charity which may comprize all good Works and all good Intentions it cannot be said whither it may go any more than it can be said whither these fifty Boys and Girls may go for as by the same Reason they may go into all the Parishes in  England  so Collections as for Charities may be set up in all the Churches in  England  by the Clergy as often as they please and tho' it be said it is all but Voluntary giving yet it is a sort of Compulsion by the Solemnity in the Church and vying with others and being marked out if refusing or giving meanly  In the Time of  Charles  I the Parliament took great Offence at some Attempts for free Gifts to the Crown and we hear that Cardinal  Alberoni  is now setting up the like all over  Spain  But besides here in  England  no Collection even for Charity unless for the Poor of the same Parish is by Law to be made but by the Leave and Permission of the King gathering of Money being so nice a Matter that it must not be done even for Charity without his Leave in the most compassionate Cases and thence the antient Method of Briefs under the Great Seal has been used even upon extreme great Losses by Fire And the Stat of and of  Anne  have put the whole Management of Briefs under the Regulation of the Court of Chancery and impower the laying great Fines upon the Offenders But this Method were giving a Goby to all Royal Licences and putting it in the Power of the Clergy to do all Acts of Charity of  themselves at the Expence of the People and to be sole Judges of the Occasions and to make what Application and Account they please  I told the Jury that I was very clear of Opinion in Point of Law this was a Case of dangerous Consequence and was an Invasion not only on the King's Prerogative but also upon the Legislature and that I thought the Defendants Guilty  The Jury stayed out but a little while and brought them in all Guilty I then told the Defendants Counsel that if they did not like my Opinion in Point of Law they might bring their Writ of Error and the Indictment being so special it did equal a special Verdict and they might have the Opinion of a special Court if they pleased  I then set a Fine of a Noble upon each Defendant I saying it was so small only because it was made a Question but now that a Verdict had settled it there would be very heavy Fines upon those who should presume to offend in like Manner hereafter Yet I heard that some Gentlemen in the Town had thereupon said that I had been too favourable to them by so small Fines but it was far from my Intention of any Favour to them but of Service to the King whereas if great it might have been said  that while they were prosecuted for levying Money on the People the Prosecution was only to levy Money upon them when it was really to settle the Point and great Fines might have raised Compassion and perhaps a Collection for them It would be great Satisfaction to me if your Lordship be of the same Opinion with me as to the Smallness of the Fines I am sure I intended it for the best  I gave Mr  Woodford  a NewsPaper wherein was an Advertisement which I thought very fit to be shewed to Superiors that the Bishop of  London  had issued a Circular Letter to all his Clergy to collect Charities in their Parishes for the poor Vicarages in  England  which I thought much of a Kin to the late Collection in  Kent  or rather more dangerous not only by raising a vast Sum of Money if the like in all Dioceses but also by marking out People how far affected to the Church throughout  England  and casting some Reflection upon Queen  Anne  's Bounty and upon a beneficial Explanation after by his present Majesty yet as if to be supported by begging and this done in a Time of Taxes which must appear the more heavy after such Collections and the Clergy would thus gain a Power of raising Money as they please and applying it as they please How  this Project goes on I know not but sure it ought to be stopped and for that Purpose a Thing very apposite was mentioned in the Debate of the late Tryal in  Kent  That commonly about  Christmas  when it is hard with the Poor for want of Work in great Frost and Snow then the Bishop of  London  does send a Circular Letter to the Parishes within the Bills of Mortality to make Collections for the Poor to be put into the Hands of the Lord Mayor But it was also alledged in the same Tryal that precedent to such Circular Letter of that Bishop the King sends a Letter under his Sign Manual to that Bishop authorizing and requiring him so to do This deserves to be inquired into and if true it is a Case in Point against this new Letter of the Bishop of  London  if without the King's Licence  A Man of  Rochester  worth nothing was convicted before me of drinking the Pretender's Health I ordered him to be whipped in open Market twice till his Back was bloody with a Month between the first and second Whipping  And at  Lewes  a Man of  Rye  was convicted before me for drinking the Health of King  James  the Third and saying he knew no such Person as King  George  He had run out a good Estate by Looseness and  had nothing left but an Annuity of thirty Pounds  per Annum  for his Life I fined him a hundred Pounds and committed him till paid and that he should find good Sureties for his good Behaviour for three Years next after the Payment of the Fine I told him that by his paying a hundred Pounds to King  George  he would certainly know there is such a Person  Your Lordship's Notion against setting a State Offender in the Pillory was certainly very right and did so convince me that I have ever since ordered corporal or pecuniary Punishments upon them as having a better Effect upon shameless People and without giving the Mob an Opportunity to be troublesome  I declared in all my Charges in this Circuit as I did the two last Terms at  Westminster  that the Number of base Libels and seditious Papers is intolerable and that now a quicker Course will be taken about them for that now the Government will not be so much troubling itself to find out the Authors of them but as often as any such Papers are found on the Tables of CoffeeHouses or other NewsHouses the Master of the House shall be answerable for such Papers and shall be prosecuted as the Publisher of them and let him find out the Author LetterWriter or Printer and  take Care at his Peril what Papers he takes in  This last was a Maiden HomeCircuit which had not been known before and is to be attributed to the late good Law of Transportation which is well put in Execution in the Counties near  London  whence Transporting is easy but not so well in other Parts of  England  The Treasury would save much Money partly by paying fewer Rewards of forty Pounds and partly by not long maintaining Fellows in Gaol if some Rates were agreed to be given to Merchants to carry them off speedily  Your Lordship's Order of Notification to the Justices of Peace had a very good Effect for they appeared much better this Circuit than formerly especially in  Surrey  where I told them that I would request your Lordship that you would please to acquaint his Majesty at his Return how very well in particular his Justices of Peace in  Surrey  had appeared upon his Pleasure being notified to them for that Purpose  I did in all my Charges inform the Audience of the Occasion and Necessity of that Notification for that there was grown a Sort of general Neglect all over  England  of the Appearance of the Justices of Peace  at the Assizes when the Judges had often Matters to inform them of by Command of his Majesty and Trials of Felons were often imperfect by the Nonattendance of the committing Justice of Peace and that their Attendance was a Respect due to the King and his Government upon those solemn Occasions and that it is no Hardship upon them there being three Excuses which will be readily admitted if upon the Call mentioned to the Court barely upon the Word of some other Justice or Proof upon Oath by some other Person  viz  If not fit to travel by Age or want of Health If living out of the County If then actually out of the County But if Justices of Peace shall remain at home about their private Affairs or to avoid the Trouble of a Journey to the Assizes it ought to be looked on as a Neglect of the Duty of their Office for they are not called only to notify to the People that they are in Commission but to answer to their Names in Person  Many of those in Commission do not act and have not taken the Oath of Office whereupon I ordered in open Court each Clerk of the Peace against next Term to transmit to your Lordship a List of such as reside in the County and refuse to act yet that he does in the mean time  know of them if they persist in such Refusal that so it may be their own doing if they are put out of the Commission after his Majesty's Favour to them in being put in  I fear I have tired your Lordship with this long tho' abridged Account but your Lordship's Pardon will be an Addition to all your former Favours to  My Lord  Your Lordship's Most Faithful and Most

Inhabitants of the little Part of the Terrestrial Globe called the Earth and one of the Subjects of the LordGrimDeath of the one Part and the said Right Dreadful LordGrimDeath Lord of BlackCastle with all the other Towns Hamlets Counties and Provinces of the vast Kingdom of Darkness of the other Part Witnesseth  That the said  Peter Le Neve  doth hereby Covenant Grant and Agree to and with the said Right Dreadful LordGrimDeath to Surrender and Yield up into the Hands and Power of the said Dreadful L  Lord  the whole and every Particle of the Terrene Carcase of the said  Peter Le Neve  whensoever he shall be thereto lawfully summoned by any Disease his Messenger whether it be in Church or Church Yard Garden HighWay or any other Ground Hallowed or Profane Part of the Territories of the said Lord and to be devoured by Maggots  Worms or any other Vermin his Servants in order to its Annihilation  Provided always that it shall and may be lawful to and for the AlmightyOne Maker and Professor of the vast Regions of  Light  and Lord Paramount of the said Kingdom of  Darkness  to dispose of and convey from and out of the said Possession of the said Lord Death at the same Instan of Time the  betterpart  of the said  Peter Le Neve  commonly called the Soul into any of his said Mansions of  Light  there to remain  in Infinitum  according to his unbounded Will and Pleasure into whose Power and Possession the said  Peter Le Neve  with most profound Reverence and Humility assigns his said Soul though unworthy to be received by Him In Consideration whereof the said Lord Death doth Covenant and Agree with the said A O  AlmightyOne  that it shall and may be lawful to and for the said  Peter Le Neve  to dispose of and assign to any other Person or Persons Subjects of the said Lord and Inhabitants of the said Terrestrial Globe the Portion or any Part or Parts of his worldly Goods with which it hath pleased the  AlmightyOne  to endow him by  his last Will and Testament in Writing made or to be made in Manner and Form following  viz    In Witness thereof to one Part of these Presents the said  Peter Le Neve  hath put his Seal and the Sealing and Confirming the other Part thereof is deferred to the Time when the said  Peter  enters the  Kingdom of Darkness  My CREED  I  Believe  in One God Omniscient Omnipotent AllMerciful and that Creator whose Name is Blessed is One and there is no Unity like His who alone Was Is and Will be my God Who by his Almighty Power in one Moment created the Heaven and Earth whose second Thoughts cannot be more perfect than his first and therefore  I  Believe  that He the Same Instant He replenished the World with Human Creatures Male and Female as well as with Beasts of the Earth and Fowls of the Air and that his Mercy on his poor Creatures is so great that he ordained none of them to feel the Fury of his Wrath  I  Believe  his Wisdom to be so great that He contrived at that Instant the Frame of all Things so wisely that on no Manner of Event or Accident whatsoever he will alter his first Design of Nature to produce that which is called a Miracle  I  Believe  him so powerful that without the Assistance of Angels Devil or any  other inferior Beings He is able to punish the Evil and reward the Good done by us Mortals and that the same Breath of his Nostrils can annihilate all which He created But if it so please Him it may be as much to his Glory to have the World endure to Eternity  I  Believe  the Historical Books Part of the Old Testament to be wrote as other Books are by faithful Historians and that they contain certain select things worthy of Observation and for Instruction in order to the directing our Affairs in this World and the Adoration of one God And for the rest which contain the Prophesies of several Persons they were wrote according to the Style of the  Eastern  Nations to reduce the  Jews  to good Living and from the Idolatry and evil Customs of their NeighbourNations and see no Reason why some of those Books called  Apocrypha  should not be admitted into the same Authority with the rest since they contain as good Precepts and the Historical Parts better confirmed by the  Roman  Authors of the same Time  As for them of the NewTestament I  Believe  they were wrote by the Followers of a Great Man to make the rest of the World believe what they through their Zeal and Love for his Person saw through a  Magnifying Glass and for so much thereof as relates to Precepts of Life and Conversation very good  I  Believe  Christ to have been a great and good Man conceived born died and was buried as other HolyMen For I cannot think him God Omniscient since he Himself saith that  he did not know the time of the Day of Judgment but the Father only  Mark Cap v  I  Believe  he may be preferred to a nearer Participation in the Beatific Vision of God than the rest of good Men to incline them to live peaceably and inoffensively in this World and to the Adoration of an Eternal Being  I  Believe  the several Religions of this World so far as they center in the Worship of his HolyName and conduce to well Living to be equally acceptable to him  I  Believe  no Person hath Power to remit Sins but God himself  I think the Mercy of God so much a greater Attribute than his Justice that he will not punish eternally for a temporary Fault since most Transgressions against the Law of Nature meet with some Part of their Punishment in this World and that there cannot be a Rational Being who can deny a Deity and the Providence thereof  Extracted from the Registry of the

Way of compelling your Friends to write to you of any body I know yet should my Ignorance in the Modes of writing cause you to esteem me less I shall repent my having learnt to write  Your excellent Judgment and the Diffidence I justly bear to my own Abilities always put a Check to that sincere and honest Warmth I am impatient to address you with But when I reflect on your many Friendly Indulgencies and see two kind Letters of yours now before me both unanswer'd I plunge in Ink lest my Silence should be more criminal than Impertinence itself Remember however it is in compliance to your Request and no fancied Skill of mine in drawing Characters You are  very singular in your Inquiry after Mr *** Morals such Questions are very uncommon here  De moribus ultima fiet  Quaestio  Ought I not my Friend to be cautious in discovering the Blemishes and Defects of this my native Spot to One so resolutely determined to Publish all the Truths he knows of it even the worst with the Sincerity and Justice of an unconcerned Historian Now methinks I see you smile and ask me What is it you thus endeavour to conceal Is not the Fidelity of your Island become a Proverb your Policy a Jest your Politeness Wantonness and Mimickry your Commerce a Combination of protected Thieves the Bane of Industry and Trade Nor is there any other Sign of Divinity or Liberty remaining with you except the opening of your Churches and the Courts of Justice in a Word it is become the Characteristic of the  English  that they account it less Glorious to act wisely than to defend the doing otherwise Yes there is too much Truth in your Remarks the Remembrance of Virtue is almost lost and if any retain Sentiments of Honesty and Religion they must be very secret if they would escape the  Public Laughter This may be an Excuse for the Son of your Friend he came Green upon the Stage was hurried into the Triumph of Vice and bore down by the Torrent of Corruption his Beauty and Comeliness of Parts  Rara est adeo concordia Formae  Atque Pudicitiae  Were no small Temptation to engage him with the Vain the Gay and the Vicious They were the prevailing Party in whose Society he squander'd an Estate dishonourably and now I had almost said deservedly seeks a servile Maintenance from that Sinka Courthis fall occasioned this Reflection of mine on Beauty with which I'll conclude  Beauty doth recommend the Bearer to  Our Notice and works a kind Impression  On all Spectators in its own Behalf  But if it bring not Matter of more Worth  As Wisdom Reason and the Charms of Virtue  It is the worthless Owner's Brand of Shame  And makes the stalking Idiot more our Scorn  LETTER II  SIR  ALL the Books which have been Published here worthy Notice I have constantly sent as you directed if I have withheld my Opinion of their Merit as you complain it was for many Reasons I judged it unnecessary Why do you so continually attack my Vanity by the Compliments you pay my Judgment But since you seek some Particulars of Mr  Pope  whose Writings I profess amongst Thousands to be an Admirer of as I have often intimated I will take this Occasion to inform you what I know concerning him Many Pieces of his The Essay on Criticism The Rape of the Lock The Essays and Dissertations on  Homer  have appeared in your Parts and one Proof of their Excellency is their being naturalized by Persons of very eminent Ability and Rank  See our former Volume  Other Languages  They have been translated both into  French  and  Italian  are inrich'd  with these and others of his Works yet would you believe it He has translated  Homer  preserved the Sublimity Strength Harmony Closeness and every other Excellence of that venerable Poet without knowing a Syllable of  Greek  and with an absolute Ignorance of the  English  His Essay on Criticism is a smooth Repetition of  Vida's  Nonsense His Pastorals are no Pastorals Nor is he a Poet These things are brayed about our Street The  Asinorum crepitus  the Din of  Grubstreet  Pretenders to Poetry and false Critics have arose to poison our Judgments some say he is too little to write Well others that he has only a Knack of writing and these Wretches all write themselves to convince us it is without a Knack Cellars are full of their Murmurings where like so many merciless Chymists they violently rack and torture Nature to confess some Worth she has not in her Mr  Pope  is accounted by those not his Enemies of overmuch Borrowing this you will rather praise then disapprove when you shall know that the finest Thoughts of the best Writers were never made use of by him till he had improved and made them better View him in his Public Character he is an Honour to our Nation the Good and Wise rejoice that such and so notable a Genius is manifested amongst us he has  the Satisfaction of not having lived in vain and has obliged the valuable Part of Mankind and is beloved by all the Learned Good and Wise View him in Private Life there is nothing more amiable and endearing He is an Example of the Duty we owe our Parents and the Love we ought to bear our Friends There is no Truth if what I tell you is not true no Friendship if I am not your Friend  LETTER III  SIR  FORGIVE me if I obtrude my Advice think not of Publishing as yet Your Works like fine Painting and Wine will ripen into more Worth by Age you should certainly complete the Catastrophe I rejoice you have resisted the Temptation offer'd it would be Madness to throw an Appearance of Partiality on the Face of your Performance which you have so bravely avoided in every other Part The Devil is black enough in his real Character the truer you can paint him the more damnable he will appear I can but laugh to see what an Appearance Kings and Ministers the Guardians of Kings make when they are shewn in History strip'd of Courtiers and Attendants If in their Lives they had few sure Friends after their Deaths they shall have fewer It is then that are Glory is taken from their Heads and their Pride trampled on Are they not  deceived my Friend who think by Power to bury in Oblivion the ill Actions they are guilty of or to keep Posterity from the Knowledge of their Vices I was the other Day at a Great Man's Levée it made me shudder He was corpulent and gross of Body and seem'd to me as if Fatning for some Sacrifice I then thought a corrupt Minister surrounded by his Creatures and Mercenaries like the Man who by unlawful Practices had obtained the Services of evil Spirits and thinks it noble to be attended on by Friends but yet expects in the End that they will tear him to Pieces  NB  Here I strongly smell another Plot and Abbe  Cn  certainly lives at  Twickenham  By the Help of  Fortunatus  's  Cap  Mr  POPE  has made the Tour of St  Omers  in order

not Hot  The Fire they say has in't 'tis true  The Power of causing Pain in you  But not more Heat in Fire that heats you  Than there is Pain in Stick that beats you  And thus Philosophers expound

sent a Compliment to Monsieur  Saintot  Master of the Ceremonies  who immediately waited on me and gave me to understand that Monsieur  de Torcy  was expected in Town Mr  Prior  wrote to him and he appointed the Afternoon to see me Your Lordship  knows the usual Ceremonies on such Occasions  I am obliged to your Lordship for letting me have your House which I like extremely though my Equipage not being come from  Rouen  puts me under some Difficulties but with the Help of Mr  Prior  all Things are made easy He has delivered your Lordship's Letter to Monsieur  de Torcy  and he took Notice to me how well Mr  Prior  has behaved himself during his Stay here  c  MANCHESTER  To the Earl of JERSEY  Extract  Paris  Aug  My Lord  I Am now entering upon a troublesome Part of my Business the King having appointed to morrow for an Audience at  Versailles  I cannot tell whether  Monsieur  and  Madame  will be there Mr  Prior  intends to set out for  Loo  as soon as these Audiences are over  c  MANCHESTER  To the Earl of MANCHESTER  Loo  Sept  My Lord  I Did not trouble you by last Post not being then able to give a very good Account of myself which I can do now having had the Honour of a very long and particular Audience of his Majesty this Morning the Effect of which is that he knows all I was able to inform him of in Relation to the present State of our Affairs in the Kingdom where you are and that I am ordered to go from hence to morrow Morning for the  Hague  to receive what Orders his Majesty may send me and to wait there till his farther Pleasure be known  Your Excellency sees by the inclosed Memoir the Case of one  Girard  a Minister of  Neufchattel  whom his most  Christian  Majesty will protect against what Madame  de Nemours  the lawful Soveraign of the Place designs to do in Relation to her own Subject His Majesty commands me to intimate to your Excellency That it is his Pleasure that you concert with Monsieur  Fribergen  upon  this Subject and use your best Endeavours with the Court of  France  that they should let the Matter be examined and decided by its competent Judges according to the Sense of the inclosed Memoir of which Monsieur  Fribergen  has likewise a Copy  You will have heard of the King of  Denmark's  Death before this reaches you so that as to public News I shall not trouble you  As to more private Affairs  Obrian  is taken up at  Brussels  so your Excellency must get  Bayly  to tell you the Particulars of what he knows relating to that Man and what he thinks would be best to do that his being taken up may be serviceable to his Majesty's Interests  I write this Letter inclosed to  Bayly  upon this Head the Account he gives your Excellency you will be pleased to send directly to Mr  Blathwayt  I take this Opportunity my Lord to repeat my Thanks to you for your Favours to me while I stayed with you at  Paris  and to assure your Excellency that in all Places and Stations I continue with great Respect  c  M PRIOR  To the Earl of MANCHESTER  Hague  Oct  My Lord  I Have the Honour of your Excellency's Letters that of the th which came strait hither and that of the th past by Way of  England  and returned thence I understand by the Gentleman nothing can be done so soon as we wish but as I have spoken to the Persons concerned here in a little Time I shall be able to give him a better Answer than I can at present It is thought proper that  Bayly  be continued  in statu quo  Mr  Yard  has let my Lord  Jersey  know what he has done in Relation to the Answer which  Couchman  brought This at present my Lord is all I can say upon this Subject in general as soon as we can get together in  England  I hope to be more particular upon it and more satisfactory to the Gentlemen concerned  We expect the King here to morrow Night for certain and about  Saturday  following we shall be wishing the Wind fair  Obrian  is by this Time on board in order to his going for  England  The  other Persons seized this Summer about  Loo  are still in Custody at  Arnheim  I trouble Mr  Stanyan  with what is less material and detain your Excellency no longer than to repeat to you the Assurances of my being with Zeal and Respect  M PRIOR  To the Earl of JERSEY  Extract  Paris  Oct  My Lord  I Am to acquaint your Lordship that  Bryerly  one of the Assassinators who had formerly some Thoughts of going into  England  and discovering what he knew in Hopes of obtaining his Pardon and getting a Recompense continues still in great Necessity and is said to be in the same Resolution Some Steps were made by Mr  Prior  in that Matter when he was here of which he can inform your Lordship and in case it may be judged for his Majesty's Service to have him come over I am sure the Promise of a Pardon and some Reward will tempt him I therefore desire your Lordship would send me his Majesty's Directions thereupon which I shall contrive to perform  in the safest Manner for him and the Person who is to go between us  MANCHESTER  To Mr PRIOR  Paris  Oct  SIR  I Shall now begin to trouble you often believing you are settled in the Office which will be another Sort of Life than that in  France  but when I consider you have so worthy a Person and so good a Friend to act under I then think nothing can stand in Conpetition with it I shall be every Day more sensible of the Loss of you here which I hope you will make up to me by letting me hear often from you I have acquainted my Lord  Jersey  with what passed in Relation to me and the  Portugal  Embassador in the Apartment of Monsieur  de Torcy  He is going away else it would be impossible but there must be farther Disputes of that Nature The first Opportunity I have I shall certainly return his Rudeness When you can do it conveniently put my Lord  Jersey  in  Mind of what we have often discoursed about in Relation to the Affairs of  France  and what he was so kind as to say he would prevent if possible when I had the Honour of seeing him last You can easily imagine I shall not be able to obtain any Thing of this Court if Matters of Moment must be only transacted by Monsieur  de Tallard  Not that I am desirous of knowing more than what he would think proper in the Post I am in I need not tell you that as a great Expence is necessary here so an Esteem for the Person is as much and I flatter myself I shall not forfeit it unless this Court finds I am only here to make a Show  Monsieur  de Tallard  is daily expected and it may be will still make his Complaints as formerly of the Delays he meets with in  England  If so I can now answer him much better by what I have seen since my coming here  The Day of Parade is near and with the Help of the Advice you give me it will go well The Calash is done and I like it though I assure you the Coaches I brought from  England  do exceed it in gilding painting and carving All who see it do own and the  French  confess they cannot come up to our gilding though they pretend theirs will last longer I  wish you was to be here for a few Days The best Apartment is now  a la Françoise  Velvet and Damask Chairs with Gold Galoon the Frames gilded Marble Tables with large Looking Glasses and I found it was absolutely necessary and when I was doing it I would do it well The Chapel which I have inlarged into the Garden looks very handsome  I cannot finish this without my Wishes that you may succeed in all Things for your Advantage  c  I am  c  MANCHESTER  To the Earl of MANCHESTER  Whitehall  Oct OS  My Lord  I Have received your Lordship's Letter of the th of  October  Before you receive this Mr  Prior  will be with you It is his Majesty's Desire that you discourse the Business of the Partition Treaty with Mr  Prior  who has already Knowledge of it and according to the Account your Lordship gives next of it you shall receive his Majesty's farther Directions  What else your Letters contain I must beg Leave to put off the answering it to another Time I am  c  JERSEY  NB  The Earl of  Manchester's  to the Earl of  Jersey    Paris Nov  begins thus  My Lord  Mr  Prior  informed your Lordship by  Wednesday's  Post of his Arrival here He having explained to me the Subject upon which he was sent I wrote to Monsieur  de Torcy  c  To the Earl of MANCHESTER  London  Nov  My Lord  I Arrived here on  Friday  Night and every Body confesses that  Roger  is fitter than I to be sent Express On  Saturday  Morning my Lord  Jersey  carried me to the King I first read to his Majesty what your Lordship said to the King of  France  and what the King answered thereupon and then I explained to his  Majesty the Substance of the whole that had past during my being in  France  His Majesty is satisfied with every Step your Excellency made and in one Word we did as we ought to do His Majesty asked me a great many Questions about your Entry You will easily believe I was glad on that Occasion to do you Justice Hi  Majesty asked me about the Rank which Monsieur  de Torcy  's Coach had and in all this Affair I can assure your Excellency he is very well satisfied I have seen as well  Charles  as  James Erby  and  Christopher Montague  I have been asked ten thousand Questions and gave them the News of my Lord  Mandevil  being to arrive at  Paris  within these six Months for which we wish all very heartily I contracted a Cold in the Voyage and wisely increased it by running about these two Days I am blooded and keep my Chamber today which is the Reason of my using another Hand I hope your Excellency will excuse it The King dined today with my Lord  Rochester  at his House near  Richmond  my Lord  Jersey  is gone to dine with him Whig and Tory are as of old implacable Dr  D'Avenant  is coming out with another Book in which he attacks the Grants and is as I am told very scurrilous  against my Lord Chancellor  Lord  Somers  and  Halisax  and our dear Friend  Charles  This I think is all the News I have known since my Arrival I have only to add my great Thanks to your Excellency for your Hospitality and Kindness to me in  France  and wish you Success in every Thing there with all possible Zeal and Sincerity I am  c  M PRIOR  To the Earl of JERSEY  Extract  Paris  Nov  My Lord  I Shall always discharge his Majesty's Orders with all Secrecy and Care imaginable and I am apt to think this Occasion will make Monsieur  de Tallard  take Care how he behaves himself for he was not very easy when he found Mr  Prior  was come and that I was to have an Audience I am  c  MANCHESTER  To Mr PRIOR  Paris  Dec  SIR  I Could wish this Court was so well inclined as to grant any Favour in Relation to the  French  Protestants but at present I cannot see any Inclination neither can I hope ever to have such Credit with Monsieur  de Torcy  as on my Account to persuade him if at any Time I see a Probability I shall not fail to act as is desired I have not yet made all my Visits of Ceremony and this Day I am going to the Arsenal You will be so kind as to make my Excuse to Lord  Jersey  having nothing at present to acquaint him with only that King  James  continues still ill His Distemper is Boils in his Backside I do not hear there is much Danger unless it should turn to a Fistula In a little Time you shall hear more Monsieur  de Tallard  could not be so soon with you as he intended because the Wind continued some Days against him and obliged him to stay at  Calais  I am glad to hear our Proceedings were approved of and I am impatient to know  the Success of that Matter though it may be I shall hear it first from Monsieur  de Torcy  I am  c  MANCHESTER  To the Rt Hon CHA MONTAGUE  Esq  Extract  Paris  Dec NS  SIR  MR  Prior  's coming here and the private Audience I had of the King the Day of my Entry occasioned much Discourse and did me Service with the Ministers for now they see the King does not wholly rely on Monsieur  de Tallard  King  James  upon Mr  Prior  's coming hither believed I was to be recalled and he to be left here which for some Time gave him great Satisfaction It is not agreeable to them to see me live in such a Manner that none of the  English  come to  Paris  but they address themselves to me  c  MANCHESTER  To the Earl of MANCHESTER  Whitehall  Dec OS  My Lord  THough I have written to You by my Lord's Order  ie  The Earl of  Jersey  that is his Letter I am to add a Word from myself  You see by the News which accompanies this Letter what was done in both Houses Yesterday In the UpperHouse the Bishop of  St David  's Business  Dr  Watson  who was accused of Simony  was thrown out and in the Other House Proceedings in Relation to  Kidd  's Matter  Relating to the  Case  of  Pyracy  came to nothing so that we gained two Triumphs that Day  Oh si sic omnia  The Commons Address you will observe to be somewhat high but the Moderation and Wisdom of the King's Answer is thought even by his Enemies to be inimitable  D'Avenant  has printed his Book against Grants  Intitled  An Essay upon Grants and Resumptions  Octavo  which I take to be a scandalous Libel against the Government I will  send it you when we employ a Messenger for I think it would cost you too dear if it came by the Post  Smith  In the Characters of the  English  and  Scots  Nobility drawn up at the Request of the Princess  Sophia  by  John Macky  Esq  which were publish'd by his Son Octavo In the Character of Lord  Peterborough  p has this remarkable Paragraph  viz  "His promising Sir  John Fenwick  his Life if he would accuse the Duke of  Shrewsbury  and the Lord  Orford  to have a Design to bring in King  James  and his writing a Book by the Assistance of Dr  D'Avenent  and putting one  Smith  's Name to it against that Duke lost him with all honest Men the House of Commons having voted the  One a scurrilous Design to make a Difference between the King and his best Friends  and the House of Peers having ordered the  Second  to be burnt by the Hands of the common Hangman"  This Book was intitled  Memoirs of Secret Service  By  Matthew Smith  of the  Inner Temple  Esq  Octavo  who was a Sort of Discoverer of the Plot and printed a Book last Year reflecting upon the Duke of  Shrewsbury  has printed another now to the same Tune  O Tempora O Mores  Every Man says and writes what he will Next Week I intend to come out myself with a Panegyric upon the King I am ever my Lord with all imaginable Respect  c  M PRIOR  PS  I do not write to  Stanyan  for he has not a Park nor a Doe  Mr  Prior  is waggish here These Gentlemen called their Mistresses their  Does  in the World I mean a Doe fit for a Pasty  To the Earl of JERSEY  Extract  Paris  Dec  My Lord  MR  Prior  may remember that I talked to him when he was here last about taking up one  Claude  a  Frenchman  as he says he is who served the late Lord  Bl  in order to exchange him for  Pierre Perault  or  Arnold  If your Lordship be of that Mind he is almost every Day at the  DogTavern  in  DruryLane  and  Couchman  the Messenger will be a proper Person to apprehend him because he was acquainted with him when he was at  Paris  This  Claude  was very much at  St Germains  while he stayed in  France  and endeavoured to seduce several  English  thither but that which will be a better Reason for seizing him is his having attended  Richardson  one of the Assassins while he lay concealed in the late Lord  Bl's  House which I  am told he bragged of when he was here last  c  MANCHESTER  To Mr PRIOR  Paris  Jan  SIR  HAving writ so lately by Mr  Stanhope  to the Earl of  Jersey  I do not trouble him now I must desire you to make my Excuse and acquaint him with the Contents of this There is nothing at present acting at  St Germains  King  James  being not well and wholly giving himself up to Devotions and Prayers The Wound which was very large is healed but it is thought they have done it too soon because the same Humours run all over his Body sometimes in his Stomach Legs  c  He is extremely broke and most Men are of Opinion he cannot recover though he may go on some Time as he is Father  Cosme  is run away with fifty thousand Livres which he had in his Hands and which he was to distribute among the  Irish  They think he may be gone for  England  since he cannot be safe in any other Place  If I learn any Thing of him you shall hear from me nevertheless it may not be improper to make some Inquiry after him and you will find by my former Accounts where his Acquaintance live in  London  I was Yesterday at  Versailles  where I made a Compliment to the King and the rest of the Court it being NewYears Day I dined with Monsieur  de Boufflers  I find them all very civil but how long it will last you can best judge I wonder my Servant has not been with you the BuckSeason must make it up We want two Posts having had no Letters since the st of  December  last I am  c  MANCHESTER  To the Earl of MANCHESTER  Whitehall  Jan  My Lord  WE have this Morning two Posts from  France  of the th and d My Lord  Jersey  commands me to acknowledge your Letter to him and to tell you that the House of Lords sitting so late and he being obliged after  its rising to go to  Kensington  is the Reason why he does not write to you You will see by the Inclosed what a Day's Work has been performed in the House of Commons the  Irish  Grants to be reassumed and not even the third Part of them to be reserved to the King and the Ministry some of our Friends particularly meaned and aimed at in the latter Part of their Vote This all comes like a Torrent and the few who would cannot In the House of Lords the King is a little more civilly used As to the Business of  Darien  his Majesty is at least justified in his Letters to the Governors of the Plantations Thus we are my good Lord scrambling and doing our best on one Side against the other who are very troublesome not to say dangerous  We hear of the Complaints you make from Monsieur  de Tallard  and prepare to redress them as well as we can As to the Persons mentioned in your Letter Care will be taken  The King has not yet seen Lord  Bazil  or any Address from him I do not hear that this Lord's Countrymen are quieter I know not how far your House's Resolution of to Day will go towards calming them I am ever  c  M PRIOR  To the Earl of MANCHESTER  Extract  Whitehall  Jan OS  My Lord  I Do not find the King willing to be at a great Expence about the  Personne dont il s'agit  The Person who is to serve us  without having some Assurance of the Service he can do Mr  Prior  has been ill which is the Reason I have not been able to know of him in what this Person can be most useful I desire your Lordship will in the mean Time keep this Matter on foot and let me know your Opinion as to the Expence and Advantage we may have by it  c  JERSEY  To the Earl of MANCHESTER  Whitehall  Feb OS  My Lord  MY Lord  Jersey  gives me in Charge to own the Receipt of your Letters of the th and th the Substance  of which my Lord will lay before his Majesty the first Opportunity  If you hear no more of the great Affair it is because nothing is transacted in it farther than when your Excellency was last advised of it consequently  Roger  is not yet dispatched  I must congratulate your Happiness that you are out of this Noise and Tumult where we are tearing and destroying every Man his Neighbour ToMorrow is the great Day when we expect that my Lord Chancellor  Somers  will be fallen upon though God knows what Crime he is guilty of but that of being a very great Man and a wise and upright Judge Lord  Bellemont  you will read in the Votes was fallen upon toDay thus every Day a Minister till at last we reach the King By next Post I shall I presume be able to write to you what relates to Matters on your Side I am heartily tired with them on our Side I am  c  M PRIOR  To the Earl of MANCHESTER  Whitehall  Feb OS  My Lord  I Have no particular Commands from your Lordship so can only acknowledge the Receipt of the  French  Letters of the th and th The great Affair was transacted this Morning though I believe Count  Tallard  will not be able to send his Express away these two or three Days My Lord  Jersey  still keeps his Bed his Gout had a Fever which accompanied it but God be thanked both those Distempers abate and I hope by next Post he will tell you so in his own Hand In the mean Time we take what Care we can about the Contents of your last Letter to my Lord though God knows all the Care we take signifies little considering how we are restrained as to the taking any Body though the Informations given make it highly necessary for the public Good but you know  England  well enough in this Point my Lord  The Speaker's Illness gives the House of Commons Leave to play till  Monday  The Address they presented Yesterday to  the King he answered very civilly but smartly I have not yet the Words but shall send them with the first The Sense was That he was sensible the Nation lay under great Taxes that he had and would contribute to the easing them by every Way which was just that he thought he had the Power of gratifying some who had been actually in the Reduction of  Ireland  out of what was his  I had written your Lordship a long politic Letter for I thought that  Roger  would have been dispatched to you but since there are no Particularities in the Affair I have spoke of I have sent Word to Mr  Woolaston  that  Roger  may stay to go over with the Midwife for my Lady  Quod felix faustum{que} sit  c  If I might speak my particular Sentiments concerning  la Personne dont il s'agit  I would have him well sifted and tried if he means to act in Earnest and is really disposed to the Thing otherwise we may be bantered to say no worse of it but this is only to yourself my Lord and from him who is eternally with great Respect  c  M PRIOR  To the Earl of MANCHESTER  April OS  My Lord  FOr above these two Months passed I have not had an Opportunity of sending over a  Horace  which we printed at  Cambridge  and which my Lord Duke of  Somerset  our Chancellor presents to the King of  France  's Library with a Letter which his Grace writes on that Subject to the Abbé  de Louvois  but I have at last sent them by a Footman who quitted my Service The Book and Letter will be or are already delivered to Mr  Stanyan  and the Favour we beg of your Excellency is that you would honour this Book with a Word by which the Court of  France  and particularly the Archbishop of  Rheims  and Abbé  Louvois  may take Notice that the University of  Cambridge  would establish a fair Correspondence with the Learned on your Side By next Post I shall write something to the  Soubibliothecaire  UnderLibrarian  Monsieur  Clermont  concerning the  Greek  Cyphers we would buy of them in this I must likewise desire your Lordship's Good Offices since  without your appearing concerned in it we shall hardly make our Matters bear as we desire Monsieur  Vrybergen  came on  Friday  I have not yet seen him I am  c  M PRIOR  To the Earl of MANCHESTER  Whitehall  April OS  My Lord  HAving written for my Master I have very little to add for myself except that I am very glad my Lord  Mandeville  is come to Town and hope he will stay long with us I am glad he is born at  Paris  for had he been born here he would have liked living among us so little that I question whether he would have thought it worth his while to have Sucked The Votes of to Day pretty well explain what I mean God knows how the Business will turn or where this Violence of the House of Commons will end The Lords seem as yet to adhere to their Point On  Wednesday  we expect the Issue of all this  Seymour  Sir  Edward Seymour  plainly said to Day That the Original  of all this proceeded from the Ministers and from the chief of them the Chancellor Many other angry Sayings of this Kind have been vented and in the Heat of this Hurry  Kidd  is arrived and sent up for with his Papers by an Order from the Admiralty Our Friend  Late Earl of  Halifax  has said nothing of late in the House of Commons My Lord Chancellor is very sick This is the  Abbregé  of our Case I think no very good one I am going to  Kensington  the Moment after I have told you that I am  c  M PRIOR  To the Earl of MANCHESTER  Whitehall  April OS  My Lord  OUR long Session is this Day God be thanked finished the  Irish  Grants resumed and the Commons satisfied at least for some Time Yesterday was indeed a great Crisis from the Morning when it was doubtful if the Lords would adhere to their Amendments or no the Commons fell directly upon Impeaching The Persons they named were my  Lords  Portland  and  Albemarle  the Articles upon which they were going for procuring for themselves exorbitant Grants In this State the Affair lasted till after the second Conference with the Lords and immediately upon the Managers returning from the Conference the House though they thought the Lords would recede locked themselves up till ten at Night of which you see the good Effects in the Votes They threw Fire about at every Body had a great Mind to fling at our Friend  Charles  Late Earl of  Halifax  you see what they would have done to my Lord Chancellor and how Duke  Schomberg  and Lord  Portland  suffer in their Address that Strangers shall not be PrivyCounsellors God knows whither this Heat would have gone if it had not been timely dispatched by every Body's striving to come in so this Bill passed Upon the Main we have Life for six Months longer and  alors comme alors  Then as before  The Affair upon which I came into  France  will be quite ended to Night Your Lordship will pretend in any Discourse you may have on that Subject to think it was quite ended three Weeks since or at least that you heard nothing to the contrary I hope my Lord  Mandeville  is well and his beautiful Mother whom the  French  Ladies will talk to Death unless you get your Doors locked up like those of the House of Commons  My Lord  The Earl of  Jersey  commands me to acknowledge yours of the th and says the perpetual Hurry in which we have been must serve for a Reason that as yet he has not spoke to the King to be your Gossip But this my Lord says is a Favour which he doubts not but the King will grant and he will tell you so himself next Post I am  c  M PRIOR  To the Earl of MANCHESTER  Whitehall  April OS  My Lord  OUR Parliament Affairs being at length finished we have a little Time to think of our private Devoirs I must therefore beg your Excellency if you have not done it already to give the  Horace  and the Duke of  Somerset  's Letter to  Abbé de Louvois  making the Archbishop of  Rheims  acquainted with the Duke's Present and the Desire we  have to correspond with the Learned at  Paris  I have written to Mr  Clement  what the University desires as to the procuring us some  Greek  Types If your Excellency expends the Money and are pleased to draw upon me I will answer the Bills I should be glad they could be got ready soon I should not dare to trouble your Excellency but that your Protection to the University is absolutely necessary in this Occasion  His Majesty goes to Morrow to  HamptonCourt  and will stay there we say these six Weeks At the End of a Session of Parliament you know we always talk of a Change in the Ministry We do so at present but upon what Ground I know not I am  c  M PRIOR  To Mr PRIOR  Paris  May  SIR  THe Court being at  Marly  Monsieur  de Torcy  will not be in Town till to morrow so I must make my Excuse to my Lord  Jersey  by you for my not writing My Wife lays all the Fault on  you that we have not yet heard if we may give the Littleone the King's Name and I dare not venture without knowing that positively so that at present you are a little out of Favour and will be so unless we hear by the next Letters  I shall do all I can to serve the University and shall take Care about the  Horace  when I have it Mr  Stanyan  will acquaint you how that Matter stands and how this Book is seized at  Diepe  I have not seen the Archbishop of  Rheims  for some Time and I believe he is gone to his Diocese  Several of the Great Men here will dine with me tomorrow and among them the Mareschal  de Villeroy  He will certainly ask after you as he often does The little Hopes our Friends at  St Germains  have left is in  Scotland  and if that fails all Things will be quiet till the next Meeting of the Parliament I think instead of a Change in the Ministers we should have a new Parliament that would be more for the King's Service Not much Good can be expected from a last Session We hear the King intends to go for  Holland  next Summer When that is certain pray let me know it which will oblige  c  MANCHESTER  To the Earl of MANCHESTER  HamptonCourt  May OS  My Lord  I Am to acknowledge the Receipt of your Letter of the th I do not believe there will be Occasion for  Roger  's Stay As the Affairs of Sir  William  c has gone through the Hands of the Church so it is convenient that it should so continue and as to the great Affair I shall take Care to manage it as you have already done in Relation to that Person's knowing it whom you mention in your Letter The Thing itself cannot I think in its own Nature be long a Secret God only knows what Effect it may have when it comes out so strange a People are we and so resolved not to be pleased with any Thing I shall be able in a Post or two to send  Brocard  some Money out of which your Excellency will repay yourself what you have expended before you give or order him the rest I believe there is no great Matter to be known but such as it is he must be encouraged  I have only in Charge from my Lord  Jersey  to own the Receipt of yours of the th and to tell your Lordship that he will answer you by sending away your Express with the first Opportunity My Lord ChiefJustice  Holt  having been here today and with the King in private has given People Occasion to say that he has refused the Seals if it be so or not I cannot say but as yet the Seals are not disposed of The King God be thanked is well which is all the News I can send you from this Place I dined today with Mr  Montague  here and drank my Lord  Manchester  's Health I am  c  M PRIOR  To Mr PRIOR  Paris  June  SIR  I Do not write by this Post to my Lord  Jersey  because Mr  Stanyan  intends to set out on  Friday  next and by him I will let his Lordship know what occurs  I find by yours of the th Instant OS that there are not to be any Changes By this I see the Town follows its  old Custom of placing and displacing several As for my own particular I shall never like  France  so well as not to wish to be at Home You know the  French  very well and I believe you find the Diversions at  HamptonCourt  where I hear you are often more to your Satisfaction than any Thing here  The News we have at present is that the Pope has made a Promotion for the Crowns  viz  the Archbishop of  Paris  who was Yesterday at  Versailles  to thank the King for  France  the Bishop of  Passaro  for the Emperor and  Borgia  a Canon of  Toledo  for  Spain  There are still two  in Petto  We have sometimes Reports here of the King's being indisposed but I hope it is not true I am  c  MANCHESTER  To Mr PRIOR  Paris  July  SIR  I Was very sorry to hear my Lord  Jersey  had quitted the Office and much more so because you also leave it I suppose you have long foreseen this and  cannot but have taken Care of yourself being upon the Place for you often said Men were forgot when abroad The Hopes you give that I am to correspond with Mr  Vernon  makes me more easy than I should have been  The Embassador of  Savoy  was with me to let me know that the Duke his Master had ordered Monsieur  de la Tour  who was formerly his Envoy in  England  to return thither with the same Character This will cause a great Discourse because he was his chief Minister but the Reason why he comes is not hard to guess I was in Hopes to have heard something concerning Sir  c  whose Letter I sent lately to  England  As soon as I hear from my Lord  Jersey  I shall not fail to congratulate with him I am  c  MANCHESTER  To the Earl of MANCHESTER  Whitehall  Dec OS  My Lord  I Am indebted to my good Lord  Manchester  for two or three Letters and it would be unreasonable if I did not  take the Opportunity of Mr  Chetwynd  's Return to tell your Lordship what I know of the State of Things here That we shall have a new Parliament is I think certain at least as far as I can see into the Matter What Sort of Parliament it may prove I cannot any Ways foresee but sure there never was so much Work as at present in securing Parties and bribing Elections Whig and Tory are railing on both Sides so violent that the Government may easily be overturned by the Madness of either Faction We take it to be our Play to do nothing against common Sense or common Law and to be for those who will support the Crown rather than oblige their Party and in order to this Men are preferred who are looked upon to be honest and moderate In this Number whether with Reason or not Time must decide we comprehend our LordKeeper and our new Secretary Lord  Rochester  and Lord  Godolphin  are in the CabinetCouncil the latter is at the Head of the Treasury the former we take it for granted is to go LordLieutenant of  Ireland  though it be yet a Secret The two Companies are to be brought to an Agreement if possible and Mr  Montague  's being made a Peer we take for granted may contribute  to this Union since being in the House of Commons he would make an ill Figure if he either declined to support the new or should find too great an Opposition in his endeavouring so to do As to the Great Affair I presume the King will wholly defer it to the Parliament and act conjointly with their Consent which I take to be the only Method All that I can say more on this Head is that I take it to be happy for the King that the Will is preferred by the  French  at a Time when every Body was peevish against the Court though with Reason God knows about the Treaty Count  Tallard  makes a foolish Figure here I do not know as yet what he says to the King on this Occasion but every Body observes his Excellency to be very melancholy and desponding and one may judge he has Reason to be so as to his own Particular concerning the Part he has been made to act however his Country in general may approve their Monarch's Breach of Truth and Treaty This I think is the present Figure of our Affairs which I am glad to write to so good a Friend as my Lord  Manchester  though to most of the World here I am of Opinion that to say least is to do best Your Friend my Lord  Jersey  grows very much  a Minister and is in a fair Way of being very great As to my own Affairs I have a great many Friends who would set me up at  Cambridge  I know I shall find great Opposition from Mr  Hammond  's Party there and great Trouble in case I should throw him out from those Men who will never be satisfied let me act as I will or can If your Lordship thinks it convenient I know you will not refuse me your Letter to the University My Lord  Sandwich  is gone to  Hinchinbrook  I hear in order to set up  Charles Boyle  against Mr  Wortley Montague  's Interest at  Huntington Vive la Guerre  whosoever is chosen or cast out or on what Side soever Things turn I am most truly c  M PRIOR  PS  Though I am no longer in a Secretary's Office Venison would not poison a Commissioner of Commerce and Does are now in Season which may be useful to inform Mr  Woolaston  when next your Lordship writes to him  NB  It has been thought proper to accompany Mr PRIOR's  Negociations  with the following Letter of the Immortal King WILLIAM III as the Basis upon which they were founded  His Majesty's Letter to Lord SOMERS  Loo  Aug  I Imparted to you before I left  England  that in  F  France  there was expressed to my Lord  P  Portland  some Insinuation to come to an Agreement with us concerning the Succession of the King of  Sp  Spain  Since which C  Tall  Count  Tallard  has mentioned it to me and has made Propositions the Particulars of which my Lord  P  will write to  Vernon  to whom I have given Orders not to communicate them to any other besides yourself and to leave to your Judgment whom else you should think proper to impart them to the End that I might know your Opinion upon so important an Affair and which requires  the greatest Secrecy If it be fit this Negociation should be carried on there is no Time to be lost and you must send me the full Powers under the Great Seal with the Names in blank to treat with C  Tall  I believe this may be done secretly that none but you and  Vernon  and those to whom you shall have communicated it may have Knowledge of it so that the Clerks who are to write the Warrant and the full Powers may not know what it is According to all Intelligence the King of  Sp  cannot outlive the Month of  October  and the least Accident may carry him off every Day I received your Letter of the th Since my Lord  Wharton  cannot at this Time leave  England  I must think of some other to send Embassador into  Sp  If you can think of any one proper let me know it and be always assured of my Friendship  WR  His Lordship's ANSWER  TunbridgeWells  Aug  HAving your Majesty's Permission to try if the Waters would contribute to the Reestablishment of my Health I was just got to this Place when I had the Honour of your Commands I thought the best Way of executing them would be to communicate to my Lord  Orf  Mr  Mont  and the D of  Shrew  who before I left  London  had agreed upon a Meeting about that Time the Subject of my Lord  P  's Letters at the same Time letting them know how strictly Your Majesty required that it should remain an inviolable Secret  Since them Mr M and my Secretary are come down hither and upon their whole Discourse three Things have principally occurred and are humbly suggested to your Majesty  That the entertaining a Proposal of this Nature seems to be attended with very many ill Consequences if the  F  did not act a sincere Part But we were soon at Ease as to any Apprehension of this Sort being fully assured Your Majesty  would not act but with the utmost Nicety in an Affair wherein the Glory and the Safety of  Europe  were so highly concerned  The second Thing considered was the very ill Prospect of what was like to happen upon the Death of the King of  Sp  in Case nothing was done previously towards the providing against that Accident which seemed probably to be very near the King of  F  having so great a Force in such a Readiness that he was in a Condition to take Possession of  Sp  before any other Prince could be ready to make a Stand Your Majesty is the best Judge whether this be the Case who are so perfectly informed of the Circumstances of Parts abroad But so far as relates to  England  it would be Want of Duty not to give Your Majesty this clear Account That there is a Deadness and Want of Spirit in the Nation universally so as not at all to be disposed to the Thought of entering into a new War and that they seemed to be tired out with Taxes to a Degree beyond what discerned till it appeared upon the Occasion of the late Elections This is the Truth of the Fact upon which Your Majesty will determine what Resolutions are proper to be taken  That which remained was the Consideration what would be the Condition of  Europe  if the Proposal took Place Of this we thought ourselves little capable of judging But it seemed that if  Sicily  was in the Hands of the  F  they would be entirely Masters of the  Levant  Trade that if they were possessed of  Final  and those Ports on that Side whereby  Milan  would be intirely shut out from Relief or any other Commerce that Duchy would be of little Signification in the Hands of any Prince and that if the King of  F  was in Possession of any Part of  Guipuscoa  which is mentioned in the Proposal besides the Ports he would have in the Ocean it does seem he would have as easy a Way of invading  Sp  on that Side as he now has on the Side of  Catalonia  But it is not to be hoped that  F  will quit its Pretences to so great a Succession without considerable Advantages and we are all assured your Majesty will reduce the Terms as low as can be done and make them as far as is possible in the present Circumstances of Things such as may be some Foundation of the future Quiet of the Kingdom which all your Subjects cannot but be convinced is your true Aim If it could be brought to pass that  England  might be some Way a Gainer by this Transaction whether it was by the Elector of  Bavaria  who is the Gainer by your Majesty's Interposition in this Treaty his coming to an Agreement to let us have some Trade to the  Spanish  Plantations or in any other Manner it would wonderfully indear your Majesty to your  English  Subjects  It does not appear in Case this Negociation should proceed what is to be done on your Part in Order to make it take Place whether any more be required than that the  English  and  Dutch  sit still and  F  itself is to see it executed and if that be so what Security ought to be expected that if our being nearer the  French  be successful they will confine themselves to the Terms of the Treaty and not attempt to make farther Advantages of their Success  I have put the Seal to the Commission without expecting the Return of the Warrant The Commission is written by Mr Secretary and no Creature has the least Knowledge of any Thing besides the Persons already named I pray God give your Majesty Honour and Success in all your Undertakings  I am with the utmost Duty and Respect SIR  Your MAJESTY's Most Dutiful and most obedient Subject and Servant SOMERS  Mr Secretary ADDISON's  Negociations  being at the same Period with those of Mr Secretary  Harley  we have thought proper to subjoin them  To the Earl of MANCHESTER  Whitehall  March  My Lord  I Am very sorry the ill State of my Health rendered me so unfortunate as not to find your Lordship at your own House and that I was not in a Condition to receive your Excellency when you did me the Honour to call at mine before you left the Town I thought I should not have had Occasion to give you any Trouble so soon more than to wish your Excellency a happy and prosperous  Journey but this Morning Monsieur  Vryberge  the Envoy of the StatesGeneral delivered a Memorial to her Majesty a Copy whereof the Queen has commanded me to transmit to your Excellency that you may see the Opinion of the States upon that Affair in  Italy  in which her Majesty does intirely concur And therefore you will please both at  Vienna  and all other Places where you shall think it necessary to express her Majesty's Sentiments upon that Affair and do your utmost to prevent any Alteration of the Project which has been agreed with Prince  Eugene  for carrying the War into  France  under Pretence of taking  Naples  and  Sicily  which are Views no Ways to be brought into Comparison with the other Design I am with the greatest Respect  c  RO HARLEY  To Mr Secretary HARLEY  Hague  March  SIR  LAst Night I came to this Place where I received the Favour of yours of the th Instant with a Copy  of the Memorial of Monsieur  Vryberge  I have since waited on the Pensionary to acquaint him that her Majesty did intirely concur with the StatesGeneral in that Affair and that I had Orders to use what Diligence I could for  Vienna  in Order to prevent any Alteration of the Project concerted with the Duke of  Savoy  for carrying the War into  France  on that Side I found by the Advices he had received from  Vienna  that he is apprehensive that the Imperial Court may have a particular View towards  Naples  which is certain will be of fatal Consequence Besides the Manner of evacuating all the Places by the  French  Troops in  Italy  without the least Notice of it either to the Queen or to the StatesGeneral gives them some Reasons to mistrust the Intentions of that Court He tells me that they have received an Answer from Monsieur  Amelot  and that the Elector  Palatine  will order the Recruits he is to send for  Italy  I hope I shall be able to set out for  Dusseldorp  in a few Days and then nothing will I hope prevent my being soon at  Vienna  where I shall execute her Majesty's Commands to the utmost of my Power I shall  continue to send you an Account how I proceed as often as I can I am  c  MANCHESTER  To Mr Secretary HARLEY  Frankfort  April  SIR  I Had not Time to write to you from  Dusseldorp  neither was their any Thing material that required Haste I came thither on the th about Noon and I had an Audience of the Elector this Evening where after a Compliment in the Name of her Majesty I acquainted him with my Orders in Relation to his Interests at the Court of  Vienna  and that the Queen's Minister who was going to reside there would have the same Instructions He expressed a very great Sense of her Majesty's Goodness to him and he did enter into the whole Matter of his Right to the  UpperPalatinate  with some Warmth complaining of the Usage of that Court He mentioned besides his several Titles also a Treaty between the late Emperor and him wherein it is agreed that he shall be put in Possession  which is since renewed by the present Emperor I told him it was of the last Importance that his Troops in  Italy  should be immediately recruited that her Majesty did not doubt but he had put it in such a Method as that I might find them so at my Arrival in  Italy  I must confess that I very much fear it though I am persuaded he will do all that is possible for he seemed not to disguise the Difficulties he was under as that his Officers were but lately arrived from  Italy  and that the last Accounts he had were that his Troops were at the Blockade of  Cremona  that he was buying a Battalion at  Onspach  and that nothing should be wanting that was in his Power to do As to the Affair on the  UpperRhine  he says there will be an Army of Men that the Emperor will make his the  Circles  have agreed on This with the Rest who are there and will be there makes up the Number That there was also Care taken for a sufficient Quantity of Ammunition  c  His two chief Ministers were to see me and I did find them agree in every Thing the Elector had told me I did press them also about the Recruits in  Italy  The next Day I had an Audience of the Electoress and in the Evening I took  Leave of both them I need not mention the Expressions they both made Use of in Relation to her Majesty and how great a Sense they should ever have of it The Electoress recommended to me the Interest of their House and also that of  Florence  I found by the Elector that the Great Duke had agreed to pay Pistoles but that the  Imperial  Court insisted on which he thought very extravagant and which they seemed to own at  Vienna  but that they thought it just since he contributed and was one of the chief Instruments in procuring the Will in Favour of the Duke of  Anjou  That they threatened to send Troops thither as also to  Genoua  in Case they would not pay what was demanded I cannot tell what may be the Consequence in Case the  Imperial  Court should carry this Matter too far But if these Sums are actually employed in carrying on the War in  Italy  we have no great Reason to complain The Elector of  Mayence  being at  Bamberg  I shall not wait on him but tomorrow I shall set out for  Vienna  where I shall certainly be in ten Days I suppose the Wind has been contrary for I have received no Letters nor shall I now till I come to  Vienna  where I shall pursue my Instructions and acquaint you how I find Matters there I am  c  MANCHESTER  To Mr Secretary HARLEY  Vienna  April  SIR  I Arrived here on the st and had been here sooner had I not met with contrary Winds on the  Danube  though I find it would have been much the same Thing for this Week every one is in Devotion I have nevertheless seen Monsieur  Zinzendorf  and Monsieur  Wratislaw  and did not fail to take the first Opportunity to shew them the ill Consequence to the intended Design of prosecuting the War into  France  should they first undertake that of  Naples  and I did acquaint them with the Orders I had received from her Majesty As for Count  Zinzendorf  he was not so positive as the latter but they both agreed in this that it would not in the least prejudice that Undertaking for since the  French  were intirely out of  Italy  there were Troops sufficient for both that Prince  Eugene  was to stay though his Presence would have been of very great Consequence that they had given their Reasons to Monsieur  Dopf  which they hoped would satisfy her Majesty as  also the StatesGeneral I had a great Deal of Discourse on that Subject with the latter who I fear has no great Opinion of the Project concerted with the Duke of  Savoy  When I pressed that Matter he did say that by the grand Alliance that of  Naples  was first to be undertaken and that the Emperor was not able to sustain this War with some Assistance of that Nature that every Thing was ready here and they had Reason to believe they should succeed with a small Number of Troops I do not doubt but her Majesty is already informed of the Reasons they alledge and I cannot but think though they do not positively own it that the Orders are already gone to  Italy  I have not as yet seen the Prince of  Salms  he being indisposed I believe I shall have my Audience of the Emperor in a few Days I fear the Duke of  Marlborough  is still in  England  for there are now three Posts wanting here I have received none from  England  since I left the  Hague  I hope by the next Post to give you a farther Account and I am  c  MANCHESTER  To Mr Secretary HARLEY  Vienna  April  SIR  BY the last Post I acquainted my Lord  Sunderland  with my Proceedings here and I have every little to add The Emperor returns from  Luxenburg  today and I suppose I shall have my Audience of the Empress tomorrow That of the Empress Dowager is over Here are no Letters yet from  England  so that I continue as often as I see the Ministers to persuade them to lay aside the Expedition to  Naples  which I believe they will do unless it be approved of by her Majesty What makes them more zealous in that Matter is the Apprehension that in  Holland  they might be brought to consent to the dismembering it from the  Spanish  Monarchy and if once they are in Possession of it  England  will never consent to it They flatter themselves that upon their appearing the People will declare As to the intended Expedition into  France  it is certain that this Court has sent the Recruits they promised as also the Mounting for  their Horse They also assure me that they are doing what is necessary in Relation to their Magazines but I am confident that in this they will fall short and I can easily perceive that their Meaning is only till their Troops can enter into  France  and then they must subsist themselves or we must do it which I find is the true Reason which makes them say that of  Provence  is most practicable because as I suppose they think they can be subsisted by our Fleet They assure me that what is agreed on will be performed They wait with a great Deal of Impatience the Success of the Duke of  Marlborough  Count  Piper  did deliver a Memorial to the Emperor's Ministers in Relation to the Battalion of  Muscovites  in such Terms that he could not receive it They did afterwards make some Alterations but in Substance it is the same You will soon see the true Intentions of this Court in Relation to the Malecontents for they have seemed of late to desire an Accommodation but it was on such Terms that they might easily judge were impossible So that Matter is at an End and they have procured a Bull from the Pope for the excommunicating of Prince  Rogotzky  and the Rest of the considerable Men of the Catholics  Whether it goes so far as to all who adhere to them I cannot tell This is at present a Secret but I suppose it will soon be otherwise if they intend it shall have any Effect I should imagine that they will not find their Account in it It may be the Means to exasperate them and it may possibly induce them to quit that Religion  I am doing all I can in the Affair of the Duke of  Savoy  I hope I shall soon bring it to some Conclusion I wait to see what Orders I shall receive for I believe there are some to come which do not please this Court After that I shall go to  Turin  I find they intend to send Count  Galas  for the  Hague  and Count  Questenberg  for  England  This is what Monsieur  Galas  does not like and his Gentleman of the Horse is come here on that Account I have seen him who is intended for  England  and he seems to own it I am  c  MANCHESTER  To the Earl of MANCHESTER  May  My Lord  I Received this Morning the Honour of your Excellency's Letter of  April  I am heartily glad your Excellency has had so much Success as to shake that Court from their speculative Expedition against  Naples  but I am very sorry that the Misfortune of our Army in  Spain  is an irresistible Argument to lay aside wholly that Project The Accounts we have of this Disaster are only got from  France  yet they bring too many Marks of Truth not to be credited so far as that we have received a very great Loss there The Queen has done all that is possible on the sudden Event and in this great Uncertainty Orders are gone this Night to encourage the King of  Portugal  to keep firm to the Alliance and likewise to  Holland  to consult with them the best Way to recover the Blow But all this will be to no Purpose unless the Emperor will exert himself on this Occasion not only to lay aside the Expedition to  Naples  to push vigorously into  France  but also to  act offensively upon the  Rhine  These are Points which the Queen hath so much at Heart that her Majesty hath written to the Emperor with her own Hand It follows this which I inclose herewith to your Excellency that you may please to deliver it with all possible Speed and that you may be the better apprized of it I inclose also a Copy for your own Perusal Your Excellency will inforce it with such Arguments as you will find according to your own Sagacity may best incline H I M  Her Imperial Majesty  to comply with so reasonable a Desire and you will be pleased also to press the Emperor to send his Brother the King of  Spain  some Troops without that it will be hard for her Majesty to prevail with the StatesGeneral to join with her in sending more Troops I hope my Lord  Rivers  will be prevailed with to return immediately to  Spain  It would be a very ill Return if her Majesty's Zeal should occasion a Coldness in the Court of  Vienna  I am with the greatest Respect  c  RO HARLEY  Her MAJESTY's Letter to the EMPEROR From the  French  SIR my BROTHER  THE Advantage which the Enemy has now obtained in  Spain  might have such dismal Consequences that I could not forbear to tell you that it is of the utmost Importance that all your Troops which are in  Italy  should be employed to make an Invasion into  France  and that at the same Time the Army in the Empire should act with Vigour on the  Rhine Spain  is so far from the Countries in which my Troops and those of the StatesGeneral are that there is no Remedy so quick nor so powerful as that of making this Invasion Your Majesty is too well informed to amuse yourself with a little Expedition for some Member or Dependency of that Kingdom when the noble and principal Parts of the Monarchy in Question the Honour and Welfare of my Brother the  Catholick  King are concerned I promise myself therefore from your Prudence that you will think only on the Reestablishment of the Affairs of that Prince by obliging  his Enemies to recall their Troops for the Defence of their own Dominions I am  Your MAJESTY's Most Affectionate Sister ANNE R  Kensington  May  To Mr Secretary HARLEY  Vienna  May  SIR  I Have taken my Leave of this Court and have but this Day obtained the Answer in Relation to the Duke of  Savoy  I have had a good Deal of Difficulty to bring them to this which is far short of what the Ministers of the Duke of  Savoy  in  England  expected It is certain that their Intention here is to delay all the farther Execution of the Treaty till after the Peace and I suppose I shall find his RH not in the least satisfied I have not been wanting to press this Matter and I have been here a Month Tomorrow I set out for  Turin  They do assure me I shall find every Thing ready for the Expedition of  France  The Detachment for  Naples  is now advanced to  Bologna  and in about a Month more they will be in the Kingdom of  Naples  They think themselves sure of Success I have inclosed the Emperor's recredential Letter and have nothing farther to add but that I am  c  MANCHESTER  To Mr Secretary HARLEY  Turin  June  SIR  I Received here the Honour of yours of the of  May  with her Majesty's Letter to the Emperor I do find they had at  Vienna  the Notice of our Misfortune in  Spain  on the th which was the Day before I left that Pla  by an Express from Prince  Eugene  which they did not think fit to communicate to me and that at the same Time Mr  Chetwynd  had given me an Account of that Matter and directed it to the  Dutch  Envoy in Case I was gone which Letter that Envoy received some Time after by the Post I am sensible that had I stayed there was no Possibility of stopping the Detachment for  Naples  for they have  since sent a positive Order to Prince  Eugene  and threatened him if they did not proceed What they alledge since is that our Fleet being not come they may be imbarked as well from thence in Case it is thought proper but I fear the Court of  Vienna  will not be very ready to send any of their Troops to  Spain  I have inclosed her Majesty's Letter and I do not doubt but Sir  Philip Meadows  who I understand is on his Way to  Vienna  will have the necessary Orders I am  c  MANCHESTER  NB  We are obliged to break off our Political Correspondence till the Publication of our Third Volume by Reason several valuable Letters of Mr  Prior  Mr Secretary  Harley  and Mr Secretary  Addison  are expected as promised from Abroad  A  LETTER  of  ADVICE  to a  Young LADY  who had married above herself grew vain and despis'd her Husband  By the Rev Dr *****  Madam  GIVE me Leave to speak my Mind to you a little sure you will because you know whatever I shall say proceeds from my Value for you Consider that a Surgeon must probe a Wound if he would make a perfect Cure and give Pain to give Health Would a Person in his Sences whom I should save from drowning by pulling him out by the Hair quarrel with me for hurting him when he is safe out of the Water therefore say down down  Self  and read what follows  Christianity common Humanity and my Profession obliges me to do every Body all the real Service I can but the Civility the kind and friendly Welcome which you have always received me with does more particularly oblige me to do all I can to promote your Satisfaction therefore let me put you in a Way to be  easy in this World and happy in the next Don't imagine now that you are fated to be unhappy There's no such Thing God puts it in all our Powers to be happy it is we make ourselves miserable The Reason we don't find Happiness is that we seek it  without  us and would rather bring Things to agree with our Humour than suit our Humour to what happens Let us do as  Mahomet  did when he called to the Mountain to come to him to shew a Miracle to his gaping Disciples and the sullen Mountain did not stir He said to them with all the Chearfulness in the World since the Mountain will not come to  Mahomet Mahomet  shall go to the Mountain and so climbing up he pleased the People and was perfectly satisfied himself Since therefore Happiness is to be found only within give me Leave to draw your Picture by setting the Mirror of Truth before you which if you view attentively and without Partiality you'll find your Happiness and lay hold of it I don't mean your outward Form or what fluttering Fellows call Roses Lillies Diamonds Pearls Balls of Snow and Bowers of Bliss should I attempt it I might do you as much Wrong as the Painter has done I don't mean what may be seen or  felt but what may be heard or understood Your Inside therefore is doubly composed of  Soul  and  Self  which God having made united together like Man and Wife Now they can never be parted from one another whilst Life continues and yet they often jar by the Devil's subtle Arts who continually endeavours to set them at Variance in which when he succeeds he makes a Person miserable But when  Soul  and  Self  go Hand in Hand  Soul  like a good Husband by his strong Reason governing with easy Sway and  Self  diffident of her own Strength gladly submitting to be governed how bless'd are both Guardian Angels attend to protect them and nothing from without can disturb their Happiness But if  Soul  happens to be pusillanimous or tyrannical or if  Self  gets it in her Head to wear the Breeches then all the Guardian Angels leave  Self  and the Devil sends Evil Genii to take Possession and stir up all the Passions to become Tormentors of  Self  which before that were all her Servants very submissive and useful when  Soul  helped to keep them under On the other Hand the Evil Genii are so continually contending with harrassing  Soul  's Guardians that they grow tired and soon sleep regardless of  their Charge then does Unhappiness fill the whole mortal Frame then it is we feel all the Racks and Tortures possible and if we are now and then easy it is when we are in most Danger it is then the black Genii have put on the Apparel of the sleeping Angel and makes us mistake Evil for Good This is my poor Friend's Case at present but  Soul  has still Force enough left to overcome  Self  and Reason to bring it to a right Temper if we can but rouse  Soul  's Guardians to our Assistance which we will do by drawing  Self  's Picture as it is at present but I am afraid you'll scarce know or own it on Account of its Deformity But if you do know it and bring it to an  Examen  a little Conversation with  Soul  will strangely mend it and then Reason will make the Colours have a quite contrary Effect to Sir  Godfrey Kneller  's for they will brighten and beautify by Time and the Picture which was shocking will become the Admiration of all Beholders I have been thus long before I begin to draw to prepare you and in Order to make you read with Patience I promise you that  Soul  's Picture which follows after this will please better  First then  Self  is plaguy forgetful▪ she does not remember that ever she was younger or handsomer she does not remember that ever she was worse in Circumstances and much unhappier than she is at present she does not remember the Time when she was much less respected than she is at present she does not remember that she was taught and should believe that Religion is the most useful Thing in Life and I am afraid poor  Self  has forgot to say her Prayers  Secondly Self  is very vain and arrogant for  Self  does not attribute her good Success to the Blessing and unbounded Mercy of Providence but fancies that all is owing to Wit and Beauty and a fine Voice but to snow you how much  Self  is mistaken tho' you may have these Qualities remember that the Captain is no Judge and all is a Gift from Heaven It is a Sign of too much Arrogance in  Self  to let the World and every new Acquaintance see that she manages All by too often exposing the Weakness of her Consort for tho' some may praise that Spirit which conquers a Man others will put wrong Constructions upon it not only reflecting upon  Self's Choice  which calls her Judgment in Question but say hard Things tho' very undeserved  and  Self  wont believe it without she hears it however when  Soul  gets the Management again  Self  will only do it in Cases of Necessity and before particular Friends  Thirdly Self  is very shortsighted and a little Dust called  Praise  thrown into her Eyes makes her quite blind for otherwise she would not do the very same Thing she blames and dislikes in Others  Self  will often swallow down a Heap of Flattery offer'd by Sneerers drink Poison because sweeten'd with Honey and believes the Givers to be sincere tho' the next Moment they expose the Credulity of the Person who they here have been praising If they call her a Goddess she believes herself Divine and expects to be worshipped if the next that comes pays no Homage but is more sincere and gives Advice or Reproof he is called an Enemy or at least said to be very ill bred and if any comes to mortify her with direct Contradiction she could crush him to Atoms and if she has no Power to hurt him she will tear and pinch her own Flesh Tho' it was ridiculous in  Teague  to say  Arra Faith my Master was my very good Friend and a Man of Sense and I am a very honest Man  and in somebody else to say  Do you know what it is to affront one of  my Character I am a S  yet if  Self  could remember she often says the very same Things in other Words But when  Soul  teaches  Self  even as a Dart thrown from an Enemy that wounds may be made useful if the Point be taken off it will prove a good WalkingCane to help  Self  to go upright  Fourthly Self  is very passionate and therefore cannot bear to be controul'd she thinks him an Enemy that does it in Earnest and believes he can be no Friend that does it in Jest She miscalls her Passions not to part with them Rage she calls HighSpirit and Courage and filling in with her Humour True Friendship but she is a great Coward tho' she can scratch and tear If I mistake not  Self  is terribly afraid of  Self  and the Thoughts of being alone is a most uncomfortable Prospect To have One that we can unbosom to without Reserve or Fear may be called having a Friend but it is not natural Friendship to have One that shall love where we love and hate because we hate without any Regard to the Unreasonableness of every Passion or the Justice or Injustice of Affection and Resentment this is by no Means to be called Friendship it is only a Union of Interest God forbid that  should be called Friendship Can Highwaymen be called Friends Yet they do all this they sing together they kill together they eat drink and whore together but as they don't act upon Principle upon the least Jar or falling out they hang one another Friendship is a Virtue and nothing of Crime can be consistent with it Follies and Weaknesses we cannot be without in this L se but a true Friendship is to pity and forgive not to encourage them It is having a Slave and fawning Parasite not a Fri  nd to have such a One as  Self  calls so A True Friend will advise and repro  ▪ and condemn  Self  for the Sake of  Soul  even to the Hazard of disobliging  Self  A Friend must help us to curb our Passions refuse Assistances in Things unjust endeavour to engage Heaven in our Cause when just and never let us alone till we apply also to the Almighty Power and make Him our common Friend In a Word Friendship is directed by Right Reason and cannot consist without Christianity  Fifthly Self  is a great Fop and agreat Slattern  Soul  has given her very good Cloaths fine Ornaments plain and neat but  Self  either leaves them like a Slut in every Corner of the House or  when she puts them on she does bedizen them with Lace and Embroidery Fringes and Ruffles Patches and Powder that you can hardly see enough of the Garment to distinguish the excellent Stuff which it is made of  Soul  has given her a fine Gown called  Good Humour  whose Outside was a celestial Blue called  Meekness  Lin'd with a white Persian called  Humility  what does  Self  but throws off the Outside saying it was foolish Stuff and tramples the Lining under Foot so that one could scarce know it  Soul  had given her a Stomacher called  Sincerity  and charg'd her to wear it only on  Sundays  and HolyDays and never to put it on without serpentine Lace called  Discretion  with a Charge to let other People discover it and not do as Court Ladies commonly do by their Cloaths that is shew them to all their Acquaintance as soon as they get them but the giddy Thing wears it every Day loses her Lace and as Children do cries every Moment who see my fine Stomacher so that it must be a discerning Eye that knows it to be genuine  Soul  gives her a fine SnuffBox in the Shape of a Heart full of plain  Spanish  Snuff  Self  throws it out and fills it with Gunpowder and Hellebore  Soul  gives her a Censor full of  Balm called  Gratitude  charging her to turn the Pipe of it upwards and set it on Fire twice a Day to make the Smoke of it rise up to Heaven assuring her that she would then find such a Fragrancy spread around that would cure all Distempers of Mind and ease all bodily Pain but poor  Self  said there was too much Trouble in the Management of it that she had forgot her Instructions and the Book was too big that gave an Account of it that there was indeed a Place where People met to use their Censors but she had more Inclination to sleep than manage her Censor when she came there and therefore thought it better to stay at Home Since that  Self  has never been rightly easy  SOUL  's PICTURE in MINIATURE  SOUL  is honest generous grateful unwilling to do but unwilling to bear Wrong sincere and open but wants Help to distinguisn and correct the Faults of  Self  and has not enough been used to reason and reflect which makes us sometimes mistake Right for Wrong but let him put on Passions and Consideration and once rouse his good Qualities and  Self  will be reformed and reunited the  Angels will resume their Charge Hell will be baffled Heaven will rejoice and Earth will honour and admire If  Soul  will learn to forgive he will learn to be easy and such is the Pleasure of the Victory over  Self  in that Case that it is worth all the Pains and none know but those who have felt it It is of the Nature of Generosity but far superior without Forgiveness here there is no Forgiveness in Heaven with it there is endless Joy and Humility is the Way to Exaltation here and hereafter To become Good consider how many you may see excel you in Goodness on whom Heaven has not bestowed the Tenth Part of what you enjoy to make yourself happy nor can you murmur when you consider how many far more deserving than yourself in every Respect are infinitely more miserable than ever you was in your Life I don't doubt but the good Sense you are Mistress of will make you know when you read and consider what I have said and I hope you will believe I wish you as well and am as much Your Friend as any one living  I am

Years and These Letters Mr  Pope  in his Remarks on the  Dunciad  BOOK II Verse  says were procured by one Mrs  Thomas  while he was almost a Boy which the Author was ashamed of as very trivial Things full not only of Levities but of wrong Judgments of Men and Books and only excusable from the Youth and Inexperience of the Writer  We desire the Reader to observe That Mr  Pope  being born on the th of  June  and the last of his Letters to Mr  Cromwell  bearing Date  December  proves Him to have been in the d Year of his Age How inexperienced a Writer he was at that Time we  shall not determine
