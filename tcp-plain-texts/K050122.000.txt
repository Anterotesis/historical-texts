world's right arm to wither and decay that hordes of priests with their beads and crosiers may preach us into cowards but I wonder not for since the great Zorinski was disgraced  Cas  What of him  Rod  He was honest  Cas  He was proud and inflexible but forbear to name him  Rod  Since Sire you have banished from your councils those hardy spirits who alone were fit to aid the public weal naught now will down but peace  the general goodthese are the entrap∣ping blandishments held out for emancipating slaves privileging towns and using every cir∣cumventive art to crush the power of the nobi∣litypeace let my Lord Cardinal preach its blessingsI hate it  What gentlemen of Po∣land shall your goodly cimeters canker in their sheaths while those usurping Knights despoil your borders  Cas  coming forward  Fiery Lord hear me If it be my duty to root out usurpation and foul conspiracy why need I wage the war on Pomo∣rania's borders when my eye's scope compre∣hends an object that would

him to my purpose is he  Nac  By turns my Lord every thingsome∣times mocking the horror of his fate he out toils the slave anon he starts from his labour and with indignation grasps his spade as 'twere the sceptre that swayed the world The foolish knaves in the mine say that love hath crazed him but to my thinking he resembles more the hungry vulture than the sorrowing dove  Rod  The picture's big with promise conduct me to himhow shall I best approach him nay prythee lead'tis strange  Exeunt ruminating Naclo leads  SCENE V  The Country  Enter  O'CURRAGH  O'Cur  Upon my honour this Lady Rosolia is a bewitching creature and now that she has passed the ordeal of constancy which is by looking me over without so much as an ogle at mewhy my  master may call himself a happy man I don't know how it is but I think this snug agreeable person of mine is a sort of a female test just like a bit of rough glass that they try money onand have you found anybad ones O'Curragh oh sweet Mrs Flannigan for thatnever shall I forget  SONG  O'CURRAGH  At the dead of the night  AT the dead of the night when by whisky inspired  And pretty Katty Flannigan my senses had fired  I tapped at her window when thus she began  Oh what the devil are you atget out you naughty man  II  I gave her a look oh as sly as a thief  Or when hungry I'd view a fine furloin of beef  My heart is red hot says I but cold is my skin  So pretty Mrs Flanniganoh won't you let me in  III  She opening the door I sat down by the fire  And soon was relieved from the wet cold and mire  And I pleased her so mightily that e'er it was day  I stole poor Katty's tender heart and so tripped away  O'Cur  Thinking of old times has given me such a comical feel that if any pretty creature was to come across me I fancy I should be rather  agreeable company In faith you are in luck O'Curragh for here comes that delicious morsel that sung her Polish planxty so sweetly  Enter  RACHEL  Rac  Heigh ho where can my dear Zarno tarry so long he knows I have but an hour from work and yet he is not come  seeing O'Curragh bows  O'Cur  Bend not to me sweet one rather let me kneel to youyou ladies are the Lords of the creation  kneels  Enter  ZARNO  starts  Zar  Rachel  Rachel runs to Zarno and em∣braces him  how dare you insult my Rachel she's mine alone mineI love her  O'Cur  Then she's alone mine too for I love herand if I've insulted her I flatter myself I can give her satisfactionInsult I don't like that pray Sir would you just step aside and condescend to explain that word insulthere's the prettiest chopper of logic  pointing to his sword  Zar  I understand you but I dare not  O'Cur  Dare not you paltry  Zar  Hear menot for myself I fear but for her should a freeman be killed in a slave's quar∣rel she would suffer she would be punished  O'Cur  In love with the girl and yet for her sake dares not defend herthat's hard that's hard but can't we manage it any how  Zar  Yes if you're a man conceal our cause of quarrel and I'll shew you what I dareI can find a sword  O'Cur  Poor fellow oh what a pleasure it will be to fight himUpon my honour our cause of dispute shall be a secret  Zar  Thank you thank you come along  Rac  Oh pray don't quarrel Sir  O'Cur  Quarrel not at all not the least ani∣mosityIf I should kill him I'll give you leave to ax him whether I did it in passion  Rac  But why fight at all  O'Cur  Upon my conscience I can't immedi∣ately tell why we fightOh it's for your sake  Rac  I shall hate you  O'Cur  Hate me upon my honour I'm so unused to hear a woman say that that it con∣fusesoh this head this head what am I atgoing to kill a man about a woman that don't care for mecome here come here there my dear boy there's satisfaction  joins their hands  Zar  You're a generous fellow  O'Cur  But why dont you marry  Rac  Because I am a slave and Zarno can't afford to buy me  O'Cur  Buy youupon my conscience I should like to buy a flock of such pet lambs  but as you both seem tolerably built for run∣ning why don't you trot off in a canter  Zar  Because if Rachel were taken her lord would kill her  O'Cur  Then he'd be hanged for it  Zar  Ah no I have heard there was a good law once that made a Lord pay a fine for killing a man but it's never put in force now  "O'Cur  A fine for killing a mana good old law do you call that  What a devil of a spot have I got into hereoh what a picked place is little Ireland to thiswe're poor enough to be sure but what of that we can fight when we please can work when we please aye and starve when we please and we can flourish our shelalahs and strut about our potatoe garden like a collection of Emperors  Exit  Zar  Adieu dear Rachel I must go back to the saltmine  Rac  Ah Zarno why do you remain in that mine nay don't be angryyou who lived in Cracow with the great Zorinski were dressed in furs and silk and now you wear the basest garments  Zar  My dear Rachel I have reasons I cannot explain  Rac  What not to me Zarno  Zar  Should Zorinski know I have divulged  Rac  Zorinski  Zar  Ugh  putting his hand to his mouth  Eh why should not Ibless her does not she de∣serve to be trustedRachel I'll tell thee a se∣cret which if known would cost Zarno his life  Rac  Would Zorinski kill thee  Zar  No but I would kill myself for having betrayed him Know then in that dreary mine dwells the great Zorinskimarkwhen Casimir was crowned Zorinski who was all in all with the late King could not bear the thwarts Casimir put on him a quarrel ensued and my master tho' I love him was much to blame disgrace followed His house which had been the hive of courtiers became desertedaway they flewhis great soul could not brook it with despairing brow and knotted arms I saw him leave the city and sadly he walked along till he reached the opening of the mine  Rac  What to throw himself down headlong and end his life  Zar  I dreaded it so fell at his feet He took me by the hand a big tear fell on it he blushed called me his faithful Zarnobade me farewel  and gave me libertyfrom that moment I be∣came his slavewe descended into the mine and I have attended him and carried him his foodaye and ever will Ah my dear master never will Zarno leave thee I shared his prosperity and shall I desert him now no no Now Ra∣chel thou hast the secret and thus I seal it upfarewel  Rac  But may not we hope for happier days Zarno  DUETZARNO and RACHEL  RACHEL  WHEN first this little heart began  To feel an impulse tender  You slily came too faithless man  And taught it to surrender  ZARNO  That dear reproach which seems to chide  The conquest it confesses  By words alone affects to hide  What every look expresses  BOTH  Then let us hope for the wedding day  When we may merry make O  RACHEL  Care awayZarno near  ZARNO  Lip to lipRachel dear  BOTH  And when to church we hie away  Ding dong ding dong ding dong will go  The merry bells at Cracow  RACHEL  Sweet hours of love but short as sweet  For Rachel's bloom must alter  And Zarno other girls may meet  And then his love may faulter  ZARNO  My love will last while life endures  Tho' Rachel look not younger  For time that lighter passions cures  Will rivet mine the stronger  BOTH  Then let us hope c  END OF ACT I  ACT II  SCENE I  A SALT MINE  ENTER  down a staircase  RODOMSKO  and  NACLO  Rodomsko  Begin your search  exit Naclo  The place is awfulsighs and
