That all who will without restraint may drink  May largely drink e'en till their bowels burst  Pleading no right but merely that of thirst  At the pure waters of the living well  Beside whose streams the MUSES love to dwell  Verse is with them a knack an idle toy  A rattle gilded o'er on which a boy  May play untaught whilst without art or force  Make it but jingle Musick comes of course  Little do such men know the toil the pains  The daily nightly racking of the brains  To range the thoughts the matter to digest  To cull fit phrases and reject the rest  To know the times when HUMOUR on the cheek  Of MIRTH may hold her sports when WIT should speak  And when be silent when to use the pow'rs  Of Ornament and how to place the flow'rs  So that they neither give a tawdry glare  Nor waste their sweetness in the desart air  To form which few can do and scarcely one  One Critick in an age can find when done  To form a plan to strike a grand Outline  To fill it up and make the picture shine  A full and perfect piece to make coy rime  Renounce her follies and with sense keep time  To make proud sense against her nature bend  And wear the chains of rime yet call her friend  Some Fops there are amongst the Scribbling tribe  Who make it all their business to  describe    No matter whether in or out of place  Studious of finery and fond of lace  Alike they trim as Coxcomb Fancy brings  The rags of beggars and the robes of kings  Let dull  Propriety  in State preside  O'er her dull children Nature is their guide  Wild Nature who at random breaks the fence  Of those tame drudges  Judgment Taste  and  Sense    Nor would forgive herself the mighty crime  Of keeping terms with  Person Place  and  Time    Let  liquid  Gold emblaze the Sun at noon  With  borrow'd  beams let Silver  pale  the Moon  Let surges  hoarse  lash the resounding shore  Let Streams  Maeander  and let Torrents  roar    Let them breed up the  melancholy  breeze  To  sigh with sighing sob with sobbing trees    Let Vales  embroid'ry  wear let Flow'rs be  ting'd  With various  tints  let Clouds be  lac'd  or  fring'd    They have their wish like idle monarch Boys  Neglecting things of weight they sigh for toys  Give them the crown the sceptre and the robe  Who will may take the pow'r and rule the globe  Others there are who in one solemn pace  With as much zeal as Quakers rail at lace  Railing at needful Ornament depend  On Sense to bring them to their journey's end  They would not Heav'n forbid their course delay  Nor for a moment step out of the way  To make the barren road those graces wear  Which Nature would if pleas'd have planted there  Vain Men who blindly thwarting Nature's plan  Ne'er find a passage to the heart of man  Who bred 'mongst fogs in Academic land  Scorn ev'ry thing they do not understand  Who destitute of Humour Wit and Taste  Let all their little knowledge run to waste  And frustrate each good purpose whilst they wear  The robes of Learning with a sloven's air  Tho' solid Reas'ning arms each sterling line  Tho' Truth declares aloud "This work is mine"  Vice whilst from page to page dull Morals creep  Throws by the book and Virtue falls asleep  Sense  mere dull formal  Sense in this gay town  Must have some vehicle to pass her down  Nor can She for an hour ensure her reign  Unless She brings fair Pleasure in her train  Let Her from day to day from year to year  In all her grave solemnities appear  And with the voice of trumpets thro' the streets  Deal lectures out to ev'ry one She meets  Half who pass by are deaf and t'other half  Can hear indeed but only hear to laugh  Quit then Ye graver Sons of letter'd Pride  Taking for once Experience as a guide  Quit this grand Errour this dull  College  mode  Be your pursuits the same but change the road  Write or at least appear to write with ease  And if You mean to profit learn to please  In vain for such mistakes they pardon claim  Because they wield the pen in Virtue's name  Thrice sacred is that Name thrice bless'd the Man  Who thinks speaks writes and lives on such a plan  This in himself himself of course must bless  But cannot with the world promote success  He may be strong but with effect to speak  Should recollect his readers may be weak  Plain rigid Truths which Saints with comfort bear  Will make the Sinner tremble and despair  True Virtue acts from Love and the great end  At which She nobly aims is to amend  How then do those mistake who arm her laws  With rigour not their own and hurt the cause  They mean to help whilst with a zealot rage  They make that Goddess whom they'd have engage  Our dearest Love in hideous terrour rise  Such may be honest but they can't be wise  In her own full and perfect blaze of light  Virtue breaks forth too strong for human sight  The dazzled eye that nice but weaker sense  Shuts herself up in darkness for defence  But to make strong conviction deeper sink  To make the callous feel the thoughtless think  Like God made Man she lays her glory by  And beams mild comfort on the ravish'd eye  In earnest most when most she seems in jest  She worms into and winds around the breast  To conquer vice of vice appears the friend  And seems unlike herself to gain her end  The Sons of Sin to while away the time  Which lingers on their hands of each black crime  To hush the painful memory and keep  The tyrant Conscience in delusive sleep  Read on at random nor suspect the dart  Until they find it rooted in their heart  'Gainst Vice they give their vote nor know at first  That cursing that themselves too they have curs'd  They see not till they fall into the snares  Deluded into Virtue unawares  Thus the shrewd doctor in the spleenstruck mind  When pregnant horrour sits and broods o'er wind  Discarding drugs and striving how to please  Lures on insensibly by slow degrees  The patient to those manly sports which bind  The slacken'd sinews and relieve the mind  The patient feels a change as wrought by stealth  And wonders on demand to find it health  Some Few whom Fate ordain'd to deal in rimes  In other lands and  here  in other times  Whom waiting at their birth the  Midwife  MUSE  Sprinkled all over with Castalian dews  To whom true GENIUS gave his magic pen  Whom ART by just degrees led up to men  Some Few extremes wellshunn'd have steer'd between  These dang'rous rocks and held the golden mean  SENSE in their works maintains her proper state  But never sleeps or labours with her weight  GRACE makes the whole look elegant and gay  But never dares from SENSE to run astray  So nice the Master's touch so great his care  The Colours boldly glow not idly glare  Mutually giving and receiving aid  They set each other off like light and shade  And as by stealth with so much softness blend  'Tis hard to say where they begin or end  Both give us charms and neither gives offence  SENSE perfects GRACE and GRACE enlivens SENSE  Peace to the Men who these high honours claim  Health to their souls and to their mem'ries fame  Be it my task and no mean task to teach  A rev'rence for that worth I cannot reach  Let me at distance with a steady eye  Observe and mark their passage to the sky  From envy free applaud such rising worth  And praise their heav'n tho' pinion'd down to earth  Had I the pow'r I could not have the time  Whilst spirits flow and Life is in her prime  Without a sin 'gainst Pleasure to design  A plan to methodize each thought each line  Highly to finish and make ev'ry grace  In itself charming take new charms from place  Nothing of Books and little known of men  When the mad fit comes on I seize the pen  Rough as they run the rapid thoughts set down  Rough as they run discharge them on the Town  Hence rude unfinish'd brats before their time  Are born into this idle world of rime  And the poor  slattern  MUSE is brought to bed  With all her imperfections on her head  Some  as no life appears no pulses play  Through the dull dubious mass no breath makes way  Doubt greatly doubt till for a glass they call  Whether the Child can be baptiz'd at all  Others on other grounds objections frame  And granting that the child may have a name  Doubt as the Sex might well a midwife pose  Whether they should baptize it Verse or Prose  E'en what my masters please Bards mild meek men  In love to Critics stumble now and then  Something I do myself and something too  If they can do it leave for them to do  In the small compass of my careless page  Critics may find employment for an age  Without my blunders they were all undone  I twenty feed where MASON can feed one  When SATIRE stoops unmindful of her state  To praise the man I love curse him I hate  When SENSE in tides of passion borne along  Sinking to prose degrades the name of song  The Censor smiles and whilst my credit bleeds  With as high relish on the carrion feeds  As the  proud  EARL fed at a Turtle feast  Who turn'd by gluttony to worse than beast  Eat 'till his bowels gush'd upon the floor  Yet still eat on and dying call'd for more  When  loose  DIGRESSION like a colt unbroke  Spurning  Connection  and her formal yoke  Bounds thro' the forest wanders far astray  From the known path and loves to loose her way  'Tis a full feast to all the mongril pack  To run the rambler down and bring her back  When  gay  DESCRIPTION Fancy's fairy child  Wild without art and yet with pleasure wild  Waking with Nature at the morning hour  To the lark's call walks o'er the op'ning flow'r  Which largely drank all night of heav'n's fresh dew  And like a Mountain Nymph of Dian's crew  So lightly walks she not one mark imprints  Nor brushes off the dews nor soils the tints  When thus DESCRIPTION sports e'en at the time  That Drums should beat and Cannons roar in rime  Critics can live on such a fault as that  From one month to the other and grow fat  Ye mighty  Monthly  Judges in a dearth  Of letter'd blockheads conscious of the worth  Of my materials which against your will  Oft You've confess'd and shall confess it still  Materials rich tho' rude enflam'd with Thought  Tho' more by Fancy than by Judgment wrought  Take use them as your own a work begin  Which suits your Genius well and weave them in  Fram'd for the Critic loom with Critic art  Till thread on thread depending part on part  Colour with Colour mingling Light with Shade  To your dull taste a formal work is made  And having wrought them into one grand piece  Swear it surpasses ROME and rivals GREECE  Nor think this much for at one single word  Soon as the mighty Critic  Fiat  's heard  SCIENCE attends their call their pow'r is own'd  ORDER takes place and GENIUS is dethron'd  Letters dance into books defiance hurl'd  At means as Atoms danc'd into a world  Me higher business calls a greater plan  Worthy Man's whole employ the good of Man  The good of Man committed to my charge  If idle Fancy rambles forth at large  Careless of such a trust these harmless lays  May Friendship envy and may Folly praise  The crown of GOTHAM may some SCOT assume  And vagrant STUARTS reign in CHURCHILL's room  O my poor People O thou wretched Earth  To whose dear love tho' not engag'd by birth  My heart is fix'd my service deeply sworn  How by thy Father can that thought be borne  For Monarchs would they all but think like me  Are only Fathers in the best degree  How must thy glories fade in ev'ry land  Thy name be laugh'd to scorn thy mighty hand  Be shorten'd and thy zeal by foes confess'd  Bless'd in thy self to make thy neighbours bless'd  Be robb'd of vigour how must Freedom's pile  The boast of ages which adorns the Isle  And makes it great and glorious fear'd abroad  Happy at home secure from force and fraud  How must that pile by antient Wisdom rais'd  On a firm rock by friends admir'd and prais'd  Envy'd by foes and wonder'd at by all  In one short moment into ruins fall  Should any Slip of STUART's tyrant race  Or bastard or legitimate disgrace  Thy royal seat of Empire but what care  What sorrow must be mine what deep despair  And selfreproaches should that hated line  Admittance gain thro' any fault of mine  Curs'd be the cause whence GOTHAM's evils spring  Tho' that curs'd cause be found in GOTHAM's King  Let War with all his needy ruffian band  In pomp of horrour stalk thro' GOTHAM's land  Kneedeep in blood let all her stately tow'rs  Sink in the dust that Court which now is our's  Become a den where Beasts may if they can  A lodging find nor fear rebuke from Man  Where yellow harvests rise be brambles found  Where vines now creep let thistles curse the ground  Dry in her thousand Vallies be the Rills  Barren the Cattle on her thousand Hills  Where Pow'r is plac'd let Tygers prowl for prey  Where Justice lodges let wild Asses bray  Let Cormorants in Churches make their nest  And on the sails of Commerce Bitterns rest  Be all tho' princes in the earth before  Her Merchants Bankrupts and her Marts no more  Much rather would I might the will of Fate  Give me to chuse see GOTHAM's ruin'd state  By ills on ills thus to the earth weigh'd down  Than live to see a STUART wear her crown  Let Heav'n in vengeance arm all Nature's host  Those Servants who their Maker know who boast  Obedience as their glory and fulfill  Unquestion'd their great Master's sacred will  Let raging Winds root up the boiling deep  And with destruction big o'er GOTHAM sweep  Let Rains rush down till FAITH with doubtful eye  Looks for the sign of Mercy in the sky  Let Pestilence in all her horrours rise  Where'er I turn let Famine blast my eyes  Let the Earth yawn and e're They've time to think  In the deep gulph let all my subjects sink  Before my eyes whilst on the verge I reel  Feeling but as a Monarch ought to feel  Not for myself but them I'll kiss the rod  And having own'd the Justice of my God  Myself with firmness to the ruin give  And die with those for whom I wish'd to live  This but may Heav'n's more merciful decrees  Ne'er tempt his servant with such ills as these  This or my soul deceives me I could bear  But that the STUART race my Crown should wear  That Crown where highly cherish'd FREEDOM shone  Bright as the glories of the midday Sun  Born and bred Slaves that They with proud misrule  Should make brave freeborn men like boys at school  To the Whip crouch and trembleO that Thought  The lab'ring brain is e'en to madness brought  By the dread vision at the mere surmise  The thronging Spirits as in tumult rise  My heart as for a passage loudly beats  And turn me where I will distraction meets  O my brave fellows great in Arts and Arms  The wonder of the Earth whom Glory warms  To high Atchievements can your Spirits bend  Thro' base controul Ye never can descend  So low by choice to wear a Tyrant's chain  Or let in FREEDOM's seat a STUART reign  If Fame who hath for ages far and wide  Spread in all realms the Cowardice the Pride  The Tyranny and Falsehood of those Lords  Contents You not search ENGLAND's fair records  ENGLAND where first the breath of Life I drew  Where next to GOTHAM my best Love is due  There once they rul'd tho' crush'd by WILLIAM's hand  They rule no more to curse that happy land  The  First  who from his native soil remov'd  Held ENGLAND's sceptre a tame Tyrant prov'd  Virtue he lack'd curs'd with those thoughts which spring  In souls of vulgar stamp to be a King  Spirit he had not tho' he laugh'd at Laws  To play the boldfac'd Tyrant with applause  On practises most mean he rais'd his pride  And Craft oft gave what Wisdom oft denied  Ne'er cou'd he feel how truly Man is blest  In blessing those around him in his breast  Crowded with follies Honour found no room  Mark'd for a Coward in his Mother's Womb  He was too proud without affronts to live  Too timorous to punish or forgive  To gain a crown which had in course of time  By fair descent been his without a crime  He bore a Mother's exile to secure  A greater crown he basely could endure  The spilling of her blood by foreign knife  Nor dar'd revenge her death who gave him life  Nay by fond fear and fond ambition led  Struck hands with Those by whom her blood was shed  Call'd up to Pow'r scarce warm on England's throne  He fill'd her Court with beggars from his own  Turn where You would the eye with SCOTS was caught  Or  English  knaves who would be SCOTSMEN thought  To vain expence unbounded loose he gave  The dupe of Minions and of slaves the slave  On false pretences mighty sums he rais'd  And damn'd those senates rich whom poor he prais'd  From Empire thrown and doom'd to beg her bread  On foreign bounty whilst a Daughter fed  He lavish'd sums for her receiv'd on Men  Whose names would fix dishonour on my pen  Lies were his Playthings Parliaments his sport  Bookworms and Catamites engross'd the Court  Vain of the Scholar like all SCOTSMEN since  The  Pedant  Scholar he forgot the Prince  And having with some trifles stor'd his brain  Ne'er learn'd or wish'd to learn the arts to reign  Enough he knew to make him vain and proud  Mock'd by the wise the wonder of the croud  False Friend false Son false Father and false King  False Wit false Statesman and false ev'ry thing  When He should act he idly chose to prate  And pamphlets wrote when he should save the State  Religious if Religion holds in whim  To talk with all he let all talk with him  Not on God's honour but his own intent  Not for Religion sake but argument  More vain if some sly artful  HighDutch  slave  Or from the  Jesuit  school some precious knave  Conviction feign'd than if to Peace restor'd  By his full soldiership Worlds hail'd him Lord  Pow'r was his wish unbounded as his will  The Pow'r without controul of doing ill  But what he wish'd what he made  Bishops  preach  And  Statesmen  warrant hung within his reach  He dar'd not seize Fear gave to gall his pride  That Freedom to the Realm his will denied  Of Treaties fond o'erweening of his parts  In ev'ry Treaty of his own mean arts  He fell the dupe Peace was his Coward care  E'en at a time when Justice call'd for war  His pen he'd draw to prove his lack of wit  But rather than unsheathe the sword submit  TRUTH fairly must record and pleas'd to live  In league with MERCY JUSTICE may forgive  Kingdoms betray'd and Worlds resign'd to SPAIN  But never can forgive a RALEIGH slain  At length with white let Freedom mark that year  Not fear'd by those whom most he wish'd to fear  Not lov'd by those whom most he wish'd to love  He went to answer for his faults above  To answer to that God from whom alone  He claim'd to hold and to abuse the throne  Leaving behind a curse to all his line  The bloody Legacy of RIGHT DIVINE  With many Virtues which a radiance fling  Round private men with few which grace a King  And speak the Monarch at that time of life  When Passion holds with Reason doubtful strife  Succeeded CHARLES by a mean Sire undone  Who envied virtue even in a Son  His Youth was froward turbulent and wild  He took the Man up e're he left the child  His Soul was eager for imperial sway  E'er he had learn'd the lesson to obey  Surrounded by a fawning flatt'ring throng  Judgment each day grew weak and Humour strong  Wisdom was treated as a noisome weed  And all his follies let to run to seed  What ills from such beginnings needs must spring  What ills to such a land from such a King  What could She hope what had she not to fear  Base BUCKINGHAM possess'd his youthful ear  STRAFFORD and LAUD when mounted on the throne  Engross'd his love and made him all their own  STRAFFORD and LAUD who boldly dar'd avow  The trait'rous doctrines taught by Tories now  Each strove t'undo him in his turn and hour  The first with pleasure and the last with pow'r  Thinking vain thought disgraceful to the throne  That all Mankind were made for Kings alone  That Subjects were but Slaves and what was Whim  Or worse in common men was Law in him  Drunk with  Prerogative  which Fate decreed  To guard good Kings and Tyrants to mislead  Which in a fair proportion to deny  Allegiance dares not which to hold too high  No Good can wish no Coward King can dare  And held too high no  English  Subject bear  Besieg'd by Men of deep and subtle arts  Men void of Principle and damn'd with parts  Who saw his weakness made their King their tool  Then most a slave when most he seem'd to rule  Taking all public steps for private ends  Deceiv'd by Favourites whom he call'd friends  He had not strength enough of soul to find  That Monarchs meant as blessings to Mankind  Sink their great State and stamp their fame undone  When what was meant for all they give to One  List'ning uxorious whilst a Woman's prate  Modell'd the Church and parcell'd out the State  Whilst in the State not more than Women read  HighChurchmen preach'd and turn'd his pious head  Tutor'd to see with ministerial eyes  Forbid to hear a loyal Nation's cries  Made to believe what can't a Fav'rite do  He heard a Nation hearing one or two  Taught by StateQuacks himself secure to think  And out of danger e'en on danger's brink  Whilst Pow'r was daily crumbling from his hand  Whilst murmurs ran thro' an insulted land  As if to sanction Tyrants Heav'n was bound  He proudly sought the ruin which he found  Twelve years twelve tedious and inglorious years  Did ENGLAND crush'd by pow'r and aw'd by fears  Whilst proud Oppression struck at Freedom's root  Lament her Senates lost her HAMPDEN mute  Illegal taxes and oppressive loans  In spite of all her pride call'd forth her groans  PATIENCE was heard her griefs aloud to tell  And LOYALTY was tempted to rebel  Each day new acts of outrage shook the state  New Courts were rais'd to give new Doctrines weight  StateInquisitions kept the realm in awe  And curs'd  StarChambers  made or rul'd the law  Juries were pack'd and Judges were unsound  Thro' the whole kingdom not one PRATT was found  From the first moments of his giddy youth  He hated Senates for They told him Truth  At length against his will compell'd to treat  Those whom he could not fright he strove to cheat  With base dissembling ev'ry grievance heard  And often giving often broke his word  O where shall helpless Truth for refuge fly  If Kings who should protect her dare to lie  Those who the gen'ral good their real aim  Sought in their Country's good their Monarch's fame  Those who were anxious for his safety Those  Who were induc'd by duty to oppose  Their truth suspected and their worth unknown  He held as foes and traitors to his throne  Nor found his fatal errour till the hour  Of saving him was gone and past till Pow'r  Had shifted hands to blast his hapless reign  Making their Faith and his Repentance vain  Hence be that curse confin'd to GOTHAM's foes  War dread to mention Civil War arose  All acts of Outrage and all acts of shame  Stalk'd forth at large disguis'd with Honour's name  Rebellion raising high her bloody hand  Spread universal havock thro' the land  With zeal for Party and with Passion drunk  In Public rage all private Love was sunk  Friend against Friend Brother 'gainst Brother stood  And the Son's weapon drank the Father's blood  Nature aghast and fearful lest her reign  Should last no longer bled in ev'ry vein  Unhappy Stuart harshly tho' that name  Grates on my ear I should have died with shame  To see my King before his subjects stand  And at their bar hold up his royal hand  At their commands to hear the monarch plead  By their decrees to see that Monarch bleed  What tho' thy faults were many and were great  What tho' they shook the basis of the state  In Royalty secure thy Person stood  And sacred was the fountain of thy blood  Vile Ministers who dar'd abuse their trust  Who dar'd seduce a King to be unjust  Vengeance with Justice leagu'd with pow'r made strong  Had nobly crush'd  the King could do no wrong    Yet grieve not CHARLES nor thy hard fortunes blame  They took thy life but they secur'd thy fame  Their greater crimes made thine like specks appear  From which the Sun in glory is not clear  Had'st Thou in peace and years resign'd thy breath  At Nature's call had'st Thou laid down in death  As in a sleep thy name by Justice borne  On the four winds had been in pieces torne  Pity the Virtue of a gen'rous soul  Sometimes the Vice hath made thy mem'ry whole  Misfortunes gave what Virtue could not give  And bade the Tyrant slain the Martyr live  Ye princes of the Earth ye mighty few  Who worlds subduing can't yourselves subdue  Who goodness scorn'd wish only to be great  Whose breath is blasting and whose voice is fate  Who own no law no reason but your will  And scorn restraint tho' 'tis from doing ill  Who of all passions groan beneath the worst  Then only bless'd when they make others curst  Think not for wrongs like these unscourg'd to live  Long may Ye sin and long may Heav'n forgive  But when Ye least expect in sorrow's day  Vengeance shall fall more heavy for delay  Nor think that Vengeance heap'd on you alone  Shall poor amends for injur'd worlds atone  No like some base distemper which remains  Transmitted from the tainted Father's veins  In the Son's blood such broad and gen'ral crimes  Shall call down Vengeance e'en to latest times  Call Vengeance down on all who bear your name  And make their portion bitterness and shame  From land to land for years compell'd to roam  Whilst Usurpation lorded it at home  Of Majesty unmindful forc'd to fly  Not daring like a King to reign or die  Recall'd to repossess his lawful throne  More at his people's seeking than his own  Another CHARLES succeeded in the school  Of travel he had learn'd to play the fool  And like pert pupils with dull Tutors sent  To shame their Country on the Continent  From love of ENGLAND by long absence wean'd  From ev'ry Court he ev'ry folly glean'd  And was so close do evil habits cling  Till crown'd a Beggar and when crown'd no King  Those grand and gen'ral pow'rs which Heav'n design'd  An instance of his mercy to Mankind  Were lost in storms of dissipation hurl'd  Nor would he give one hour to bless a world  Lighter than levity which strides the blast  And of the present fond forgets the past  He chang'd and chang'd but ev'ry hope to curse  Chang'd only from one folly to a worse  State he resign'd to those whom state could please  Careless of Majesty his wish was ease  Pleasure and Pleasure only was his aim  Kings of less Wit might hunt the bubble fame  Dignity thro' his reign was made a sport  Nor dar'd Decorum shew her face at Court  Morality was held a standing jest  And Faith a necessary fraud at best  Courtiers their monarch ever in their view  Possess'd great talents and abus'd them too  Whate'er was light impertinent and vain  Whate'er was loose indecent and profane  So ripe was Folly Folly to acquit  Stood all absolv'd in that poor bauble WIT  In gratitude alas but little read  He let his Father's servants beg their bread  His Father's faithful servants and his own  To place the foes of both around his throne  Bad counsels he embrac'd thro' indolence  Thro' love of ease and not thro' want of sense  He saw them wrong but rather let them go  As right than take the pains to make them so  Women rul'd all and Ministers of State  Were for commands at Toilettes forc'd to wait  Women who have as Monarchs grac'd the land  But never govern'd well at Secondhand  To make all other errors slight appear  In mem'ry fix'd stand DUNKIRK and TANGIER  In mem'ry fix'd so deep that Time in vain  Shall strive to wipe those records from the brain  AMBOYNA standsGods that a King could hold  In such high Estimate vile paultry gold  And of his duty be so careless found  That when the blood of Subjects from the ground  For Vengeance call'd he should reject their cry  And brib'd from Honour lay his thunders by  Give HOLLAND peace whilst ENGLISH victims groan'd  And butcher'd subjects wander'd  unaton'd  O dear deep injury to ENGLAND's fame  To them to us to all to him deep Shame  Of all the passions which from frailty spring  Av'rice is that which least becomes a King  To crown the whole scorning the public good  Which thro' his reign he little understood  Or little heeded with too narrow aim  He reassur'd a Bigot Brother's claim  And having made timeserving Senates bow  Suddenly died that Brother best knew  how    No matter  how  he slept amongst the dead  And JAMES his Brother reigned in his stead  But such a reignso glaring an offence  In ev'ry step 'gainst Freedom Law and Sense  'Gainst all the rights of Nature's gen'ral plan  'Gainst all which constitutes an Englishman  That the Relation would mere fiction seem  The mock creation of a Poet's dream  And the poor Bard's would in this sceptic age  Appear as false as  their  Historian's page  Ambitious Folly seiz'd the seat of Wit  Christians were forc'd by Bigots to submit  Pride without sense without Religion Zeal  Made daring inroads on the Commonweal  Stern Persecution rais'd her iron rod  And call'd the pride of Kings the pow'r of God  Conscience and Fame were sacrific'd to ROME  And ENGLAND wept at FREEDOM's sacred tomb  Her Laws despis'd her Constitution wrench'd  From its due nat'ral frame her Rights retrench'd  Beyond a Coward's suff'rance Conscience forc'd  And healing Justice from the Crown divorc'd  Each moment pregnant with vile acts of pow'r  Her  patriot  BISHOPS sentenc'd to the Tow'r  Her OXFORD who yet loves the STUART name  Branded with arbitrary marks of shame  She weptbut wept not long to arms she flew  At Honour's call th' avenging sword She drew  Turn'd all her terrors on the Tyrant's head  And sent him in despair to beg his bread  Whilst she may ev'ry State in such distress  Dare with such zeal and meet with such success  Whilst She may GOTHAM should my abject mind  Chuse to enslave rather than free mankind  Pursue her steps tear the proud Tyrant down  Nor let me wear if I abuse the crown  Whilst She thro' ev'ry age in ev'ry land  Written in gold let REVOLUTION stand  Whilst She secur'd in  Liberty  and  Law    Found what She sought a Saviour in NASSAU  END OF THE SECOND BOOK
