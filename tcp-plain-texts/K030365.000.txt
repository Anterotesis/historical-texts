ISMENE  SWEET blushing flower a while  Breathe soft incense on the air  Yet thy balmy dews distill  And be the Gard'ner's pride and care  Yet a little charm the sense  Yet a momentfix the eye  Then for thy short preeminence  Be ravish'd from thy stock and die  AIR II  FARRUKNAZ  DEAR native scenes fair Seville's Towers  That rear your antique spires so high  Your awful groves and fragrant bowers  Fond memory traces with reverted eye  And Hope of all that train remaining  Which once gay youth and pleasure led  At every pause of my complaining  Points to your vales belov'd and sacred shade  Haply beneath some crumbling ruin  Some dripping arch or rifted tree  My Carlos lingers yet renewing  Vows of angelic love and waits for me  There yet a while sweet spirit hover  I come my holy vow to keep  I come to join my sainted lover  And joy to die who only live to weep  AIR III  ISMENE  THE heart which love has wounded  By fear and death surrounded  One only thought alarms  It mocks the raging ocean  The stormy winds commotion  Or din of hostile arms  Its wonted cares are banish'd  Its early terrors vanish'd  It pants with fears unknown  Throbs with too fierce pulsation  To mark the dull vibration  That trembles with its own  AIR IV  FARRUKNAZ  FROM Carmel's spicy groves or where  Stain'd with many a marty'rs blood  Old Kedron rolls his holy flood  To Sion Wall the tomb of God  Pilgrims who precious reliques bear  If sudden on the scorching sand  The prowling Arab's felon band  Round the fainting Camels stand  Some portion feel of my despair  Who by the fraudavenging sea  Are dash'd upon some verdant Isle  And worn with care and spent with toil  In sleep from thought escape awhile  By some clear stream or perfum'd tree  But wake to savage songs and view  The feather'd chief and sable crew  And kindling fires on mountains blue  May weep and rage and rave like me  AIR V  SULTAN  THE God who form'd our wretched race  In pity clos'd the book of Fate  Forbad with impious search to trace  The illsthat all alike await  Ah wherefore burst the friendly shade  Which shuts the future from our sight  And tear the veil by mercy spread  To shield us from a painful light  Full soon shall Time so seeming slow  With noiseless steps his course fulfil  And call to birth each destin'd woe  Each embrio grief and ripen'd ill  AIR VI  VIZIER  CHLOE with all that Nature  Coud lend of loves and graces  To deck each conqu'ring feature  Or wanton in her tresses  For twenty years the nation  Had rul'd with sway tyrannie  'Till for her soul's salvation  She lately felt a panic  Unlike the Grecian Bully  That all the world had won Sir  Then wept so pitifully  Because there was but one Sir  She in the skies discovers  An Empire worth acquiring  So quits her quitting lovers  And flies from the retiring  For now her form is waining  And eyes begin to twinkle  And all the Loves remaining  Are Loves that love a wrinkle  Herself a Pagan Goddess  Into a saint she turns Sir  Nor longer for the bodies  But souls of men she burns Sir  So lest her faith should fail her  Or youthful sins might sink her  She keeps a preaching Taylor  And apostolic Tinker  Who to regeneration  May guide her and refresh her  In case too of temptation  May struggle with the flesh Sir  AIR VII  ISMENE  HAVE you not seen an Infant's prize  In vain its snowy pinions beat  That tipp'd with gold and Tyrian dyes  Are only guilty of its fate  With cruel kindness to her breast  The thoughtless nymph her captive presies  That tortur'd still and still caress'd  Breathes out its little life in kisses  Such is in faithful lines pourtray'd  The story of the woes I prove  So wretched woman is betray'd  By beauty and undone by love  With cruel kindness c  TRIOAIR VIII  FARRUKNAZ ISMENE  and  SULTAN    THINK not sorrow made for you  The slaves of love are tortur'd too  Eyer cruel ever smiling  Sill detected still beguiling  Cupid wreaths his chains with flowers  And hides his rack in perfum'd bowers  Chorus  Think not sorrow c  END OF FRST ACT  ACT II  AIR IX  CARLOS  FAIR liberty whom heaven gave  But where peculiarly it loves  And put off all it meant for slave  With orangebow'rs and citrongroves  The children of the frozen North  Where nature half her gifts retains  Are doom'd to tame the churlish earth  For tasteless fruits and tardy grains  Yet while their weary task they ply  By thee their fainting souls are cheer'd  No stern unfeeling Lord is nigh  No rods are seen no chains are heard  Still as they guide the delving plough  Or bind pale Autumn's scanty store  To thee their manly lives they vow  To thee their grateful strains they pour  RONDEAUAIR X  CARLOS  SWEET innocence has charms to soothe  Each lawless thought which love inspires  And calms the fiery pulse of youth  With meek Devotion's pure desires  To chasten and refine she knows  Tumultuous wishes burning sighs  And turns the breath of eager vows  To incense and to sacrifice  AIR XI  AMRA  TO be true to the man they admire  Is a virtue all women alike have  When pleasure and duty conspire  Our conduct's as plain as a pikestaff  But at once to detest and be true too  Another to love and resist him  Is on wives too tyranic a duty  To be practised by Turk or by Christian  AIR XII  RATHMUD  SEE the mutes  Cruel brutes  They seize me  Round they fling  Hempen string  And squeeze me  While I weeze  My decease  They quicken  I flicker  Much quicker  Than chicken  You stand by  While I die  Then bolder  With your blade  Cut my head  From shoulder▪  Down the staircase  Kick my carcase  In a hole  And my noddle  Rides a straddle  On a Pole  TRIOAIR XIII  LAZARUS HELI RATHMUD  Laz  THO' Womansh and Wine be de blesshings of Laife  Yet monish ish moche more delighting  For Dese are de caushes of quarrelsh and shtraife  But for dis we can cheat vedout faighting  Heli  If the blessings of life be but women and wine  Ne'er quarrel but part them between us  The joys of the rosycheek'd Bacchus be mine  And do you take the pleasures of Venus  Rath  To love and to drink are the blessings of life  When your wine than your mistress is older  But so new is my wine and so antique my wife  My sole pleasure in drink is to scold her  Rath  and  Heli  The joys of the rosycheek'd Bachus be  thine    mine  Rath  and  Laz  And we'll part the money between us  Heli  And do you

made rollers for de Macs  To curl deir hair 'twash very good  Rosin I painted for shealingwax  And forg'd upon't  Wel brand en vast houd    Slippers for Inns I next learnt to stitch  Quicksilver balls

fifty per cent  And wash I H in de Public Advertizer  De nexsht thing I did wash a spirited prank  Which at a stroke my fortune made  For I happen'd to write so like de Cashiers of de Bank  De Clerks didn't know de difference and de monish was paid  So having sheated the Gentiles as Moses commanded  I began to tremble at every Gibbet I saw  So I got on board a ship and here I am landed  In spite of Judges Counsellors Attorneys and Law  AIR XV  SULTAN  SAY when the chast'ning hand of heaven requires  Of the torn breast its better dearer part  Can Love obedient put out all his fires  Or reason quell the pulse and calm the heart  Will no fond passage linger in the mind  Nor tender words yet vibrate on the ear  Nor look nor gesture leave its trace behind  The hand its pressure nor its brine the tear  NoIn this bleeding vault of breathing earth  Thy gracious image shall for aye remain  Or from its living cavern bursting forth  Glide thro' the chambers of my madding brain  By heaven rejected and of thee bereav'd  Madness or death must draw the shaft of fate  My tortur'd sense must crack to be reliev'd  My heart to be at ease must cease to beat  AIR XVI  CARLOS  IN each new scene of varied woes  My longlost fair I find  No picture of distress but shews  Her image to my mind  No heart but  Her's  appears to thrill  No bosom heaves but  Her's    And with  Her  form my terrors fill  Each dress affliction wears  AIR XVII  SULTAN    WHAT cares surround a Monarch's brow  And weigh the splendid sufferer down  Known victim of each public woe  And silent martyr of his own  With the bright circle of a crown  Around our temples grief we bind  And press beneath the royal gown  The vulture that devours the mind  For Us no social bosom heaves  No sympathetic sorrows roll  But faith proscrib'd with friendship leaves  A dreary solitude of soul  The ills of life alone we taste  Thus insulated from our race  Preside with  Famine  at the  feast    With  Misery  have the power to  bless    END OF THE SECOND ACT  ACT III  AIR XVIII  FARRUKNAZ  HOPE treach'rous meteor lucid vapour  Ever flying  Still belying  The village taper  Wand'ring pilgrimslone benighted  Thy blue falsehood pleas'd descry  See the cheerful faggot lighted  Think the social cottage nigh  Lambent fire deceive but harm not  Pallid gleam relume but warm not  Light no error in my breast  Sooth my weary soul but charm not  Unrelenting  Unconsenting  Swearing never to be bless'd  AIR XIX  CARLOS  THE smiling years that pleasure leads  Unmark'd their placid tenor keep  Ere yet the wounded bosom bleeds  Or knows to wake and weep  But slow the ling'ring moments creep  And slow the flagging hour recedes  When taught by love to wake and weep  The wounded bosom bleeds  AIR XX  FARRUKNAZ  SOMETIMES 'tis said the spirits of the blest  Float on the buoyant bosom of the air  And watch with aid divine the maid distrest  The Hermit's wand'ring step or midnight pray'r  With pensile minstrelsy the heaven they fill  With harps unseen the starry roofs resound  While from their sacred extasies distill  Peace to each care and Balm to every wound  AIR XXI  FARRUKNAZ  WHAT are the boasted joys of love  By danger won in fear possest  There scarce is leisure in the breast  Its wish'dfor state to prove  How short the hours of bliss we know  By toil forerun by terror prest  The heart was never truly blest  That did not tremble too  DUO  CARLOS  and  FARRUKNAZ    Carl  MERCY sole right divine of Kings  Can all the toils of pow'r atone  And guards with wideexpanded wings  The
