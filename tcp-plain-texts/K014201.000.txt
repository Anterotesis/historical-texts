happy and to keep them so  Plain Truth dear MURRAY need no flow'rs of speech  So take it in the very words of  Creech    This Vault of Air this congregated Ball  Selfcentred Sun and Stars that rise and fall  There are my Friend whose philosophic eyes  Look thro' and trust the Ruler with his Skies  To him commit the hour the day the year  And view this dreadful All without a fear  Admire we then what Earth's low entrails hold  Arabian shores or Indian seas infold  All the mad trade of Fools and Slaves for Gold  Or Popularity or Stars and Strings  The Mob's applauses or the gifts of King's  Say with what eyes we ought at Courts to gaze  And pay the Great our homage of Amaze  If weak the pleasure that from these can spring  The fear to want them is as weak a thing  Whether we dread or whether we desire  In either case believe me we admire  Whether we joy or grieve the same the curse  Surpriz'd at better or surpriz'd at worse  Thus good or bad to one extreme betray  Th' unbalanc'd Mind and snatch the Man away  For Vertue's self may too much Zeal be had  The worst of Madmen is a Saint run mad  Go then and if you can admire the state  Of beaming diamonds and reflected plate  Procure a  Taste  to double the surprize  And gaze on Parian Charms with learned eyes  Be struck with bright Brocade or Tyrian Dye  Our Birthday Nobles splendid Livery  If not so pleas'd at Councilboard rejoyce  To see their Judgments hang upon thy Voice  From morn to night at Senate Rolls and Hall  Plead much read more dine late or not at all  But wherefore all this labour all this strife  For Fame for Riches for a noble Wife  Shall One whom Nature Learning Birth conspir'd  To form not to admire but be admir'd  Sigh while his ChloÃ« blind to Wit and Worth  Weds the rich Dulness of some Son of earth  Yet Time ennobles or degrades each Line  It brighten'd CRAGS'S and may darken thine  And what is Fame the Meanest have their day  The Greatest can but blaze and pass away  Grac'd as thou art with all the Power of Words  So known so honour'd at the House of Lords  Conspicuous Scene another yet is nigh  More silent far where Kings and Poets lye  Where MURRAY long enough his Country's pride  Shall be no more than TULLY or than HYDE  Rack'd with Sciatics martyr'd with the Stone  Will any mortal let himself alone  Rather than so see Ward invited over  And desp'rate Misery lays hold on Dover  The case is easier in the Mind's disease  There all Men may be cur'd whene'er they please  Would ye be blest despise low Joys low Gains  Disdain whatever CORNBURY disdains  Be Virtuous and be happy for your pains  But art thou one whom new opinions sway  One who believes as Tindal leads the way  Who Virtue and a Church alike disowns  Thinks that but words and this but brick and stones  Fly then on all the wings of wild desire  Admire whate'er the maddest can admire  Is wealth thy passion Hence from Pole to Pole  Where winds can carry or where waves can roll  For Indian spices for Peruvian gold  Prevent the greedy and outbid the bold  Advance thy golden Mountain to the skies  On the broad base of fifty thousand rise  Add one round hundred and if that's not fair  Add fifty more and bring it to a square  For mark th' advantage just so many score  Will gain a Wife with half as many more  Procure her beauty make that beauty chaste  And then such Friendsas cannot fail to last  A Man of wealth is dubb'd a Man of worth  Venus shall give him Form and Anstis Birth  Believe me many a German Prince is worse  Who proud of Pedigree is poor of Purse  His Wealth brave Timon gloriously confounds  Ask'd for a great he gives a hundred pounds  Or if three Ladies like a luckless Play  Takes the whole House upon the Poet's day  Now in such exigencies not to need  Upon my word you must be rich indeed  A noble superfluity it craves  Not for your self but for your Fools and Knaves  Something which for your Honour they may cheat  And which it much becomes you to forget  If Wealth alone then make and keep us blest  Still still be getting never never rest  But if to Pow'r and Place your Passion lye  If in the Pomp of Life consist the Joy  Then hire a Slave or if you will a Lord  To do the Honours and to give the Word  Tell at your Levee as the Crouds approach  To whom to nod whom take into your Coach  Whom honour with your hand to make remarks  Who rules in Cornwall or who rules in Berks  " This may be troublesome is near the Chair  " That makes three Members This can chuse a May'r"  Instructed thus you bow embrace protest  Adopt him Son or Cozen at the least  Then turn about and laugh at your own Jest  Or if our life be one continu'd Treat  If to live well means nothing but to eat  Up up cries Gluttony 'tis break of day  Go drive the Deer and drag the finnyprey  With hounds and horns go hunt an Appetite  So Russel did but could not eat at night  Call'd happy Dog the Beggar at his door  And envy'd Thirst and Hunger to th  Poor  Or shall we ev'ry Decency confound  Thro' Taverns Stews and Bagnio's take our round  Go dine with Charters in each Vice outdo  K  's lewd Cargo or Ty  y's Crew  From Latian Syrens French Circaean Feasts  Return well travell'd and transform'd to Beasts  Or for a Titled Punk or Foreign Flame  Renounce our Country and degrade our Name  If after all we must with Wilmot own  The Cordial Drop of Life is Love alone  And Swift cry wisely "Vive la Bagatelle"  The Man that love and laughs must sure do well  Adieuif this advice appear the worst  E'en take the Counsel which I gave you first  Or better Precepts if you can impart  Why do I'll follow them with all my heart  FINIS
