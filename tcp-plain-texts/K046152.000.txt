 THE THEATRES A POETICAL DISSECTION  PRICE THREE SHILLINGS  THE THEATRES A POETICAL DISSECTION By Sir NICHOLAS NIPCLOSE Baronet  Suppose JOB living 'midst the Critic train  Our Theatres would ope his angry vein  Behold the Muses ROSCIUS sue in Vain  Taylors Carpenters usurp their Reign  LONDON PRINTED FOR JOHN BELL IN THE STRAND AND C ETHERINGTON AT YORK MDCCLXXII  TO M  RS  ABINGTON AS A CORDIAL TRIBUTE OF RESPECT FOR SUCH SINGULAR MERIT AS WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ORNAMENT TO THE STAGE EVEN AT IT'S BRIGHTEST AERA MERIT WHICH THE PUBLIC WISH AND OUGHT OFTENER TO ENJOY MERIT HIGHLY CONSPICUOUS THO' INJURED BY WANT OF PROPER SUPPORT THE FOLLOWING SATIRE THE FRUIT OF HONEST INDIGNATION IS DEDICATED BY ONE WHO DARES SIGN HIMSELF AN UNPREJUDICED CRITIC AND THE LADY'S WELLWISHING HUMBLE SERVANT NICHOLAS NIPCLOSE  NIPCLOSEHALL Nov  ADVERTISEMENT  IT may be depended upon that the following piece appeals more to Facts than Fancy however strong the Colouring may appear unattach'd judgement will pronounce it not exaggerated the Author has particularly dwelt on sordid Management as that is the polluted source of all Theatrical dullness and deficiency Mr GARRICK is exceedingly blameable and therefore particularly noticed About the time he got a share in DruryLane Patent our present Laureat wrote him a letter  Vide  d Volume of DODSLEY's Collection of POEMS  in which among other passages we find Thalia speaking thus  No more the poor polluted scene  Shall teem with births of Harlequin  Or vindicated stage shall feel  The insults of the dancer's heel  Such idle trash we'll kindly spare  To Op'ras now they'll want them there  Afterwards addressing Mr Garrick the poet says  Consult your own good sense in all  Be deaf to Fashion's fickle call  Nor e'er descend to reason's laws  To court what you command applause  How far Roscius has fulfilled the prophecy or consulted his own DISINTERESTED good sense experience sadly tells Some hireling newspaper friends say if the public will follow such trash the managers are right to furnish it but will common sense allow that those  public purveyors should like common prostitutes be allowed to pick young and unwary pockets by false glaring colours Public complaint has been loud yet the tide of avarice and folly most audaciously flows onThe theatres have been likened to taverns where if you don't like the provision or wines you may stay away or go to another true but there are MANY taverns only TWO theatres a  third  of the latter would make essential difference allow a small anecdote QUEEN ELIZABETH having received remarkable instances of ardent loyalty from a small country town said if they would ask any reasonable grant in her power they should be indulged Licence for an alehouse was the demand Surprised me asked the reason because said they we have but one and they give us such wretched trash we can't drink it if there was another emulation would produce us something worth money the application is obvious  One half the money that either INSTALLATION has cost nightly extra expences included would have genteely paid Mr MOSSOP who is intrinsically worth a thousand such ChristmasHolliday Productions  As to the performers we know they like a nest of disturbed hornets will buzz and whet their stings it will be called cruelty to attack bread how absurd an assertion if a shoemaker or taylor executes what he is paid for badly have not customers a right to complain nothing is more true than the following lines of CHURCHILL with which we shall conclude  The stage I chusea subject fair and free  'Tis your's'tis mine'tis public property  All public exhibitions open lie  To praise or censure of the public eye  THE THEATRES A POETICAL DISSECTION  GODS of the stage if any gods there be  Who deign to glance on modern tragedy  Or comic strains which barely serve to keep  The slumb'ring audiences from perfect sleep  Inspire the museprovide a whip of steel  To make e'en av'rice pride and dullness feel  Pervade the Grubstreet gloom which wraps around  Our ROYAL SHOW SHOPS and their guides profound  For SAINT BARTHOLOMEW let conquest run  To Smithfield give their tinsel glare and FUN  For that we cannot humour justly stile  Which scarcely should in barns create a smile  Grant us correction both for great and small  For authors actors managers and all  'Till they with pallid tremor shrink and faint  Sunk into captives of the  sausage  saint  Where is the blush oh DRURY for thy shame  Without a remnant of thy ancient fame  Tho' tears still fall and laughter still may roar  Ev'n mighty ROSCIUS is  himself  no more  And for the rest some few exceptions made  They sink to criticism's darkest shade  Scarce more respectable than Falstaff's crew  Whom SHAKESPEARE paints so laughably to view  Think not tho' on a golden column rais'd  Tho' often justly and unjustly prais'd  Tho' servile authors kiss thy mighty hand  And cringing actors at wide distance stand  Tho' valiant BRATHWAITE  Master taylor at DruryLane  arm'd with steel and goose  Lets all a taylor's mighty genius loose  Tho' SAWNEY JOHNSTON  This  gentleman  once proprietor of a puppet show in Edinburgh is house and box bookkeeper remarkable for OECONOMY obsequiousness and taste in decorations by which he has accumulated some thousands  that designing Scot  Who once mov'd PUNCHnow doom'd to fairer lot  Makes gain of darling siller just defence  For the fell murder of poor common sense  Tho' great BEN VICTOR  This laurelcrowned  Esquire  was a barber attempted to be an actor became a treasurer then a manager in Dublin where in fortune's frolics though not able to write a dying speech he was appointed  Birthday Ode Man  andoh poor Irelandhis wife complimented with a pension He is now treasurer of DruryLane  the Hibernian bard  Had they no native blockheadwond'rous hard  To wear the laurel andoh task sublime  Weave birthday sonnets into barb'rous rhime  That here they came a tonsor to misplace  And put a shaver in the poet's place  Tho' BEN who in his biographic flights  Just like the ordinary of Newgate  Vide  his Lives of the Actors  writes  Applauds thy management without rebuff  Grinning assent with consequence and snuff  Tho' LACY swearing shadow of a shade  Thy most obedient stalking horse is made  Think not thy crimes oh GARRICK shall escape  Thy crimes as manager of monst'rous shape  One as a mandidst thou not ent'ring life  With real merit wage illiberal strife  Did not DELANE  Mr DELANE an actor of great merit and a valuable member of society had two peculiarities on the stage which Mr GARRICK took off and rendered him so ridiculous that he was constantly laughed at having generous though week feelings Mr DELANE took to drinking and in reality broke his heart  a bright thea  ic star  Fall by the shock of paltry mimic war  Hast thou not since assail'd that art with blame  Mr GARRICK when attacked in the same stile by Mr FOOTE declared his disapprobation of such exhibitions in strong terms    Which to assassinate a rival's fame  Was us'd without remorsemake no reply  Knock at thy heart and let repentance sigh  By royal patent constituted 'SQUIRE  To what great purpose did thy soul aspire  Not with true taste to dignify the stage  In grateful sense of such a gen'rous age  Whose favours flow'd upon thee in a tide  Unknown before to swell thy purse and pride  To trick the public and become supreme  Were the sole objects of thy selfish scheme  BARRY was banish'd when his powers could shine  Now ta'en to sneer at in his sad decline  Or what is worse upon the verge of life  View'd as a mere appendage to his wife  MOSSOP  This excellent performer was originally refused by Mr GARRICK as unfit for the stage and immediately after brought out by that ready encourager of merit Mr SHERIDAN  too great a fav'rite of the town  Like the Turk's brothers stood too near the crown  Therefore avauntyou knew the man has pride  And thro' that foible stabb'd his weakest side  On selfdestruction's wings he fled the field  And must we fear thro' adverse fortune yield  Yet be advised nor cruel terms impose  Lest friends of merit should become thy foes  Hast thou e'er giv'n young genius due reward  Hast thou not rather pinch'd and grip'd it hard  POWELL and HOLLAND  These two performers were brought out under the most avaricious terms and according to their stations did not receive half of what their performance and the receipts of the theatre intitled them to  both for seasons felt  The poor penurious pittance which you dealt  You taught the latter and by teaching spoil'd  You travell'd and the first grew nature's child  From his own source his stock of merit drew  And earn'd just praise by not resembling you  This is not meant to depreciate Mr GARRICK's indisputable original merit but the sad adulterated imitations of it of which Mr HOLLAND who had superior requisites to Mr POWELL was a stiff and painful instance    What ballances the mischiefs you have done  Giving us CAUTHERLY and BRERETON  Illustrious pairinimitably fine  Who with an equal share of  dimness  shine  Hold let us own amidst satyric rage  You have improv'd the  lighting  Taking away the candle rings and lighting from behindthe only advantage we have discovered from Mr GARRICK's tour abroad  of the stage  Yet oh what man of sense but sighs and stares  When rags and sticks supply the place of play'rs  To all but  recommended blockheads  blind  Has budding genius ever prov'd thee kind  Obsequious to  right honourable  taste  A lord must be discerning wise and chaste  You never kindly op'd the way to fame  Unless sustain'd by some enobled name  Or such whose Pens o'ercharg'd with ranc'rous spite  Have put thy tim'rous nature in a fright  Ev'n HOME's  Mr HOME's Douglas was refused till persecution gave it a name in Scotland and the thane patronized its author then two much worse plays were obsequiously produced  amazing talents could not suit  'Till handed forward by the GREAT LORD BUTE  Agis and Aquilcia came in play  Tho' each a nerveless dialogue essay  Flatt'ry indeed that sweetmeat to the vain  Has found success in thy theatric reign  While modest worth tho' known if poor  Might bootless shiver at thy churlish door  And hope as soon encouragement to meet  In Asia's wilds as in SOUTHAMPTONSTREET  Mr GARRICK's residence  The want of leisure pitiful pretence  Apologizes for rejected sense  Previous engagements too are made a plea  Engagements known full well to you and me  Such as to name would make a cynic laugh  Perhaps to CUMBERLAND or BICKERSTAFF  Oh had kind fortune of my father made  An Irish bishop  Mr Cumberland's father is in that station An excellent reason for the son's being a genius which he modestly avouches himself to be in his prologue to the  Brothers  or as good a trade  Had she when at my mother's breast I hung  With thriving Blarney  A phrase in Ireland for gross ignorant sycophantic flattery  tipp'd my supple tongue  Then of thy smiles secure I might have shone  As many equal simpletons have done  Go on great sir acquiring praise and pelf  Take care that none write better than thyself  FOOTElet that name ne'er wound thy jealous ear  His wit and satire rise above thy sphere  He too possesses what thou ne'er could'st find  Judicious taste and elegance of mind  Go on great sir and scribble to the last  You cannot give us worse than what is past  Unless your prologueforging  Mr GARRICK stiles himself a prologue smith  itch remains  Which throws relentless common sense in chains  Thus of the manager I take my leave  And while I view the faithful picture grieve  Truth should be told of all in public station  The monarch of a theatre or nation  Truth that bright beacon which with just alarm  May folly vice and insolence disarm  If one or all of these in thee are found  Oh that my pen the rotten part may wound  May probe to

QUIN DELANE  Rise from the shadestake human shape again  See hear feel judge with most impartial thought  And frown our  spouting cyphers  into nought  Hark to our ear the tragic muse complains  And pours peculiar grief in melting strains  Hark to her voice she well deserves the smile  Of all the great and virtuous in our isle  Since she depicts such characters and things  As suit the minds and dignity of kings  See how she bends her tender tearfill'd eye  On distant cold neglecting majesty  Hear her remonstrancehear her humble pray'r  To him who should caress the melting fair  The TRAGIC MUSE's PETITION and REMONSTRANCE  Oh mighty GEORGE this nation's tender sire  Whose virtues more than rank the good admire  Why when unbending from the painful weight  Of cumb'rous monarchy and toilsome state  Why sometimes in my laughing sister's place  Am I not honour'd with your royal grace  The actions and the sentiments I yield  Afford reflection sure the nobler field  And ought to rank me on some kind occasion  Before such trash as HARLEQUIN's INVASION  Where not one ray of real merit shines  To gild the gingerbread of schoolboy lines  While FRED'RIC  Late prince of Wales  breath'd tho' not a BRITON BORN  Words used by his present majesty in his first speech to parliament which intimated with magnanimity that natural affection would cause him not only to maintain the constitution but patronize ALL the useful arts and sciences as well as painting watchmaking and buttonmaking  He ne'er insulted me with abject scorn  Ne'er turn'd against me FASHION's  Which always springs from court  pow'rful tide  But led me forth with all the pomp of pride  And took a feeling sensible delight  To trace  my  SHAKESPEARE thro' each nobler flight  Whether he sung ambition's righteous fall  Or wav'd his pen at freedom's pow'rful call  Whether he mov'd in high or humble sphere  With Juliet sigh'd or rav'd with frantic Lear  SHAKESPEARE so little countenanc'd by you  Unless in sprightly tale of MUCH ADO  The comedy of MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING though far from one of SHAKESPEARE's best plays is almost the only one countenanced by commands and was rather whimsically fixed on two nights after the funeral of that deliverer of his country WILLIAM DUKE of CUMBERLAND  Early great FRED'RIC gave thee my embrace  His late royal highness had formed a design to bespeak all SHAKESPEARE's acting plays one a week which was partly put in practice he also caused the princes his sons to act in Cato Lady Jane Gray c to give them an idea of public speaking if the present young branches of royalty should be placed in such a situation we are fearful of hearing that they are to exhibit Dogberry and Verges  set me down an ass  would have a sad ominous sound  I shew'd thy talents with peculiar grace  Let her not then in vain thy favour seek  Who taught thee like an orator to speak  Oft' have I seen thee in thy infant state  Weep for the havoc made by partial fate  And tears of pity from a royal breast  Should still humanely wait on the distrest  Like Heav'n's impartial dew should ever flow  For real worth beneath the clouds of woe  Fear not to view mehear the truths I tell  Such truths as ne'er from cringing courtiers fell  Give me your grace I'll limit my design  And yield up LIBERTY to RIGHT DIVINE  No WILKES thro' me shall wound your awful eye  Presuming wretch to  squint  at majesty  With titled knaves and fools I will not sport  But shew all great and virtuous at thy court  Thrice happy spot where ev'ry thing is good  Where no vice taints the streams of noble blood  Within whose verge corruption ne'er could steal  And ev'ry statesman toils for public weal  For public weal employs his honest care  Nor lets selfint'rest claim the smallest share  Feels sleepless nightsstands popular abuse  When all the horrid rage of slander's loose  Witness oh NORTH the facts which I relate  You guide illpaid this most ungrateful state  You have no brother bishop'd  A phrase we have conveniently used for episcopated  ere  few have reached a mitre so soon as the present bishop of Litchfield and Coventry  his time  You have no wife made rangerpost sublime  Wiser than all who in your post have sat  Braver than allfor once you lost a HAT  The  scum  of the  earth  being in a violent ferment attacked the  gentle  premier and oh lamentable tale torehis hat in pieces  Witness them SANDWICH noble wise and  chaste  With ev'ry moral pious virtue grac'd  SANDWICH who ne'er in  Rochesterian  John earl of Rochester to whom the present earl of Sandwich is an exemplary contrast  way  On helpless woman made one vile essay  There is a couched meaning here which we leave to the intellegent reader  Witness them ROCHFORT  The first of these four statesmen has done  nothing  the second has divorced his wife married her cousin and got a blue ribband chancellorship of Cambridge and now privyseal for avoiding the storm which himself had in a great measure raised the third is an excellent judge of French wine and the fourth president of the council  under direction of his wife  GRAFTON WEYMOUTH GOWER  Oh truly patriot most illustrious four  Whose very names with utmost rev'rence strike  Whom Britain or her foes must surely like  Witness them BARRINGTON  Our able secretary at war whose humanity is well known  of gentle mind  The bloodless tender friend of human kind  Whose grateful letter perfect pleasure yields  For the great conquest gain'd in GEORGE's FIELDS  Witness them TALBOT  A peerless steward of the houshold who had put Dr Cadogan's abstemious scheme in practice before his pamphlet came out  thriftiest of the great  A most superb oeconomist of state  Who so much rich superfluous viands slights  That all St JAMES's are  Cadoganites  Witness proud POMFRET that bedchamber lord  That  sunshine  A beautiful figurative expression of that resistless orator  of the sun in every word  Who languishes alas for Yorkshire mines  Oh cruel SMITH to thwart a peer's designs  Witness oh WESTMINSTER where from the bench  Sage MANSFIELD  This upright chief justice in the Grosvenor cause acted quite different from his predecessor in Henry the IVth's time the latter confined the prince of Wales only for an affront to his dignity the former palliated an affront offered to the law of GOD by his royal confidant  ne'er would law from justice wrench  But holds her scales with such an equal hand  He may be deem'd the MINOS of our land  Witness the glorious melting kind THIRTEEN  So many as we remember petitioned for the Kennedy's without the shadow of exculpation  Who by a handmaid urg'd of beauty's queen  For murd'rers begg'd and gracious pardon won  No reign e'er mercy shew'd as this has done  Witness our BISHOPS and ARCHBISHOPS too  Who worship lawn without one worldly view  Witness sage GLOSTER rev'rend with a right  That holy mitred criticising  Commentator on Shakespeare one of the most amiable humble humane creatures breathing wherefore we have singled him out as an ornament to the woolsack gentry not but there are several of nearly equal merit  wight  Who still forgives as he would be forgiv'n  Can such an humble prelate miss of Heav'n  Oh glorious proofs of GEORGE's patriot reign  SEJANUS  The infamous minister of that infamous monarch Tiberius Caesar a prince depraved by nature yet rendered worse by his overgrown favourite  ne'er shall mount the stage again  No monster like him lurks behind thy throne  Advising actions which he dares not own  Still conscious virtue thy calm conscience keeps  And MAGNA CHARTA on thy pillow sleeps  Magna Charta seems to have been slumbering several years but of late has fallen fast asleep should the liberty of the press fall into the same lethargic state then with Razor in the upholsterer we may cry poor old England  In thee the stream of policy refines  And with inimitable lustre shines  Why should proud armaments prepar'd around  Disturb our peace so solidly profound  Let not such objects stir thy mighty mind  Conquests at home are of the nobler kind  What are seiz'd ships or men in bondage cast  Perhaps all mankind may be slaves at last  Heed not the SPANIARDS treat their threats as sport  But oh keep stedfast eye on PRINCE's COURT  Mr Wilkes's residence that political Leviathan who should be strictly guarded against lest to him like the dragon of Wantley houses and churches should be mere geese and turkies  Smile on a civil parliament and be  At least  thyself  possessed of liberty  Smile on me too as formerly again  Grant me oh grant a Thursday  The day commonly honoured with royal commands  now and then  So shall again my consequence arise  To captivate the heart and flood the eyes  So shall I hold the state my rank demands  And gain due tribute at the public hands  Thus sues the queen of tearsmay she obtain  That favour citizens have sought in vain  Pardon kind reader that the wand'ring muse  Should in her subject mingle diff'rent views  Unfrown'd upon permit her to return  Nor let a critic indignation burn  Since all agree the real and mimic state  In many points each other nearly mate  Since blunders partialities and pride  At present rule the roast on either side  And merit without meanness or a friend  In both may unsuccessfully attend  Seek and deserve protection but in vain  Herein St JAMES's joins with DRURYLANE  Let any person who doubts this most disgraceful assertion only go through the irksome task of attendance and dependance which SWIFT emphatically stiled a curse and he will be feelingly convinced that we only advance truth in a modest garb  Who then with patience either spot can see  Unless who hate desert and liberty  Authors come forthmost venerable tribe  Whom we not fear to censurenor will bribe  With paltry praisecome all around  With selfsufficiency and dullness crown'd  At satire's call here blushing bend your way  Solemn and farcical as LORD MAY'R's DAY  The poet's brain how whimsical a spot  How strange a jumble is the author's lot  How rich how poor how pitiful how great  The world his field and nature his estate  This day a pamper'd PEGASUS he rides  The next one bare as ROSINANTE's sides  Like QUIXOTE too he often takes delight  To brave mankind in fruitless windmill fight  By him what vast variety is shewn  From the plain cottage to the gilded throne  Sometimes his thunder shakes a wooden sphere  Nay all the elements by turns appear  Now rosin light'nings blast the desart scene  Then blooms stage groves with beauteous vernal green  He calls the TRAGIC MUSE in pompous woe  While tears from sympathising passions flow  'Till yielding to her blither sister she  Resigns her groans to laughing COMEDY  Sweet WILLY WHITEHEAD who with medium stile  Can never force a tear or win a smile  Most simply chastemost delicately dull  Nearly o'erflowing and yet never full  Sweet WILLY WHITEHEAD first in rhiming sphere  Who smoothly BALLADIZES  We have coined this word as not knowing any in the language adequate to our ideas of the laureat's annual productions  twice a year  Teaching his laurell'd pension'd muse to sing  The milkwarm praises of a milkwarm king  Welcomes the infant year as custom claims  And hails in creeping measure royal names  Bold ARTHUR MURPHY a dramatic wight  Whom taste must wish had never learn'd to write  Who BRITON like attacks our Gallic foes  And deck'd in English garb his plunder shews  The literary smuggler of this isle  Whose works from genuine genius claim a smile  Not of applause for dullness' self must own  That modest ARTHUR shares her gloomy throne  And has by various labours fairly won  The glorious title of her eldest son  Stand clear ye critics at due distance stand  While we produce great DOCTOR CUMBERLAND  The witty son of a RIGHT REV'REND sire  Touch'd with such glow of true Parnassian fire  That he has given three pieces  Summer's Tale Brothers and WestIndian to which applauded incongruities we refer for proof of the changes brought against this author who as we hear teems with many more of the same kind Dreadful idea  to our stage  The pride the joy the wonder of the age  Let probability such authors bind  As pour productions from a narrow mind  Let those who wish to merit being read  Avoid absurd assaults on PRISCIAN's head  Our DOCTOR scorns to own such narrow views  Defies all grammar and no theme pursues  Of incidents supplied with plenteous store  Off sets his muse and never seeks for more  Let him go on amidst the public praise  And proudly gild his neverblooming bays  Let him proceed with most relentless heart  'Till nature and the stage for ever part  Stiff as the stays  We do not by mention of Mr Kelly's original profession mean an illiberal reflection as it is our candid opinion that a good staymaker may be deemed a more respectable member of society than a middling author though it must be confessed he cannot so soon commence ESQUIRE  which once his needle made  What strange transactions chance from trade to trade  How wonderful the various turns of men  Who now a bodkin wield and now a pen  Stiff as the whalebone which he once admir'd  Behold HUGH KELLY with the muse inspir'd  Vending in dialogue  sermonic  scenes  THALIA knows not what such preaching means  And grieves to walk abroad in such disguise  As that dull WORD projected for the WISE  Though Mr Kelly's comedy of a Word to the Wise was treated in a most illiberal manner yet certain it is that the riot did him great service since without opposition the piece would have had a speedy  natural  death without the advantage of a subscription for such a phlegmatic affair was never composed before and we hope never may again  KELLY between the sister muses steers  Too grave for laughter and too light for tears  If CLEMENTINA claims thee for her sire  To pastrycooks consign her or the fire  Nor dare to play the double dealer's part  In sentiments so foreign from thy heart  Several impotent attempts at patriotic strokes were made in this impotent tragedy which if derived from the Ledger essayist must be double dealing with a witness  Whereforeoh HUGHwith belly fair and round  With city luxury and dullness crown'd  Wilt thou aspire to hold an author's name  If thou  art  bent on literary fame  Forego the city's father

Somerset CoffeeHouse who had read his address of thanks to the livery remarked that it was the dullest production he had ever seen from the new magistrate's pen to which a person in the same box not unaptly replied Do you wonder at that sir consider he was made an ALDERMAN yesterday  JOHNSON that huge Leviathan of wit  Made once a turgid tasteless tragic hit  Told a soft tale in such laborious strains  As damn'd the fair IRENE for his pains  A literary warehouse well supply'd  With learning's lore and not a little pride  Who in his own opinion sits supreme  Whatever stile he takes whatever theme  Who never yet his own applause has miss'd  Poet philosopher philologist  JOHNSON who once beneath a virtuous face  Gave venal pensioners to vile disgrace  JOHNSON who since more prudent grown and old  Obeys the touch of allconverting gold  Of a court scribbler takes the paltry sphere  And damns his famefor whatthree hundred pounds a year  JOHNSON thrice happy in a newcoin'd word  Reigns in full state most pompously absurd  In a sad fit of dotage takes up arms  And crams the public with his FALSE ALARMS  What pity that a man who knows nothing of practical life who is a mere bookworm should expose himself floundering like an unskillful swimmer in the unfathomable depths of policy for the sake of a pension which while he had power to enjoy life he did without and for which when obtained he had very little if any occasion  Defends a ministry in whose defence  He murders virtue liberty and sense  GARRICK the friend of DOCTORS right or wrong  Most aptly here adorns satyric song  GARRICK who titles loves almost as life  And nearly well as his beloved wife  GARRICK by multitudes so much ador'd  Like sir JOHN ENGLISH worships ev'ry lord  We have heard a circumstance of Mr GARRICK which if not strictly true is so like him that we venture to set it down being indisposed he asked his servant what enquiries after his health some complimentary cards were presented he looked over them and finding they were only from some esquires and a baronet or two he cried What has no lord sent Johnno sir then throw these paltry compliments into the fire the nobility must all be sick too or they could not have neglected me  Were all indeed like Hagley's  LORD LYTTLETON  learned peer  Taste would herself become their worshipper  But Drury's lord on greatness only set  Head or no

theatric name  I've wrote enough what needs there any more  To gain fame's temple and the public roar  The LONDON PACKET  Two evening papers of which the managers are proprietors therefore every defence of their impositions and absurdities however vague is greedily admitted indeed we believe every thing favourable is written by  themselves  for certainly no other person save a fool or a flatterer would undertake so impracticable a justification  the St JAMES's join  To vend the puffs which I and DAVY coin  We pleaders like though at the public bar  We wrangle fiercely wage no hostile

tho' we condemn his gen'ral plan  Strong tints of life in his GOOD NATUR'D MAN  Yet don't we wish to meet him on the stage  'Twill spoil the foremost poet of our age  Nor would we view him in historic

little tales  Outweigh'd by Gossamore in judgment's scales  Like tinkling rills thy rippling verses sound  And yet with Mexican  Alluding to the gold mines some produce of which Mr Hoole has luckily fingered for his feeble theatrical translations  applause are crown'd  Oh kindly age that swallows good and bad  Oh simple age gone critically mad  Witnessbut wherefore should we witness call  Review our drama and confess it all  KENRICK we think may stand beyond dispute  As sensible discerning and acute  But so engross'd with mathematic notion  His thoughts all center in PERPETUAL MOTION  This author has been long riding a chimerical hobby horse which we fear will at last throw him  Without a question born to live by rule  He ne'er can shine in a poetic school  And with the drama still must

ears abuse  Rather trust those who plainly roughly chide  And let infirmities suppress thy pride  BARRY who vegetated fair and long  In person graceful and in feelings strong  With voice harmonious yet too apt to whine  Music of sound his principal design  Measure of verse not sense bespoke his care  And rants were catch'd at to make groundlings stare  Without variety of action still  His arms and legs obey'd  mechanic  will  Yet with all faults none more could flood each eye  None better form'd to make the ladies sigh  Now after various gallantries devote  To that most paltry prop a petticoat  So a tall oak the glory of the grove  Whom Sylvan deities have view'd with love  Feeling the gripe of alldevouring time  No longer shews its stately head sublime  Shrinks at each blast of ev'ry storm afraid  And bending seeks a willow's feeble aid  REDDISH alike by nature and by art  Is form'd incapable to touch the heart  He strives indeed through various shapes to please  Without expression dignity or ease  A voice so bounded it was never meant  To rise above a moral sentiment  A figure clumsy and a vulgar face  Devoid of spirit as of pleasing grace  Action unmeaning often misapply'd  Bless'd with no perfect attribute but pride  Take heed bold sir nor friendly caution slight  In FRAMPTON and that path we deem thee right  But when a hero takes thy awkward gait  We laugh at both his passions and his state  PALMER compos'd of more than common size  With languid features and more languid eyes  Stalks a tall gauky on perception's rays  Too slight for censure and too dull for praise  From hollow lungs he rumbles forth a sound  Enough all sense and feeling to confound  Emphasis oh vain superfluous word  All rules for speaking actors deem absurd  None but a pedant would attempt to teach  By grammar ties or paltry parts of speech  This GARRICK knows and only plies with tricks  Commonly call'd stage business often essential but oftner used as a take in to those who have more eyes than understanding  But leaves the meaning for themselves to fix  Or fond of something critical and new  A meaning gives beyond the author's view  What is a voice tho' bless'd with silver tone  If love's soft notes in singsong are made known  What is a mellow medium if each line  In dull monotony shews dull design  Or what QUIN's deepmouth'd base if with a growl  It wounds each tender feeling of the soul  Rightly to rule is truly to possess  And pow'rs well manag'd please us more tho' less  Than those luxuriances which weed like shew  And serve to choak the gardens where they grow  Who has not seen upon rejoicing night  Squibs sputter fret and bounce by partial light  So elder AICKIN shatters tragic strains  And fritters nature with uncommon pains  Struts foams and

Are you not happy in a QUEEN  Mr Cautherly married last summer a daughter of Mr Blanchard Cardmaker with several thousand pounds to her fortune as GREAT personages very seldom say good things we are

serious actor we detest  With no one pleasing proper talent bless'd  A face where motionless composure sits  And shortliv'd meaning only gleams by fits  A bellman's hollow voice a bellman's drone  Who

sounds dispense  When he assumes or levity or state  He SADDLES  Mr Packer is a very  reputable Saddler  though a miserable actor however he has so many to keep him in countenance as to his theatrical deficiency that he may go on without blushing  critics with a grievous weight  AICKIN the younger has some gifts to please  Just sensibility and modest ease  He aims not there where nature cannot reach  But lets her guide his gesture and his speech  The muse concern'd beholds the place he fills  But all in vain while so his tyrant wills  Wishing she could with such persuasion speak  To gain him better parts and add some pounds per week  When JEFFERSON paints age in tragic strains  Judgement attends nor slights his wellmeant pains  'Tis there he shines not with a radiant blaze  Yet merit decks him with some pleasing rays  He vainly aims not at gigantic strides  But with discretion medium feelings guides  Much safer 'tis the middle path to run  Than mount aloft to fall like PHAETON  MOODY we praise with all the warmth we can  When he depicts the IRISH GENTLEMAN  Nor stop we here since he possesses sense  To keep from those attempts might give offence  May just reward his real

from curiosity what may pay by one night the whole season's pitiful salary of such actors several mushrooms have vegetated thus but none more worthless or shortlived than Mr Owenson brought modestly forward in Tamerlane some weeks since without even the requisites of a grownup schoolboy  As one wellform'd to mount the Tragic throne  A  first appearance  smooth'd the thorny way  Yet candid judgement damn'd his wild essay  The shade of CONGREVE felt each jarring strain  And fled ere Osmyn could appear again  DAVIS a singsong man of little worth  The critic muse relentingly brings forth  Such feeble objects should her lash escape  She should not combat with a human ape  VERNON in music gains unbounded praise  We to his  acting  yield applausive lays  Like GREENLAND's sun too little seen he shines  Scarce half his time but when he does refines  The clouds of dullness which around him gloom  Nonsense avaunt and give true merit room  PARSONS and HARTRY with strong pow'r of face  Give sportive humour oft successful chace  Yet each too feeble for a foremost station  Courts rather than commands our approbation  WESTON but wherefore need we speak of him  Begot by MOMUS upon Lady

 Year after years in public service spent  May'st thou enjoy retir'd a life serene  And meet with comfort thy conclusive scene  That cannot fail to him who keeps thy plan  Ev'n death is pleasure to an

whose excellence Mr Garrick not only chose to prophecy but put his infallible opinion at the bottom of an ostentatious print though it is an undoubted fact that there never was a  natural  FRENCH actor or actress  herself must at her prophet sneer  To see his age and size in youthful sphere  And policy we freely own should find  Somewhat that's fatly similar of kind  For if like rabbits

pause to breathe a wish sincere  That she may keep within her proper sphere  Nor venture COMEDY of lighter kind  With laughter she can never touch the mind  Her Tragic walk is striking rich and wide  Enough to gratify e'en female pride  Why then intrude on spirited compeers  Is't not enough to shine the queen of tears  Come at our call whom all with joy must see  The gay Theatrical EUPHROSYNE

obedient to his whim  Glibly take down whatever pleases him  Taste is indeed reduc'd to dismal pass  Beneath controul of this assuming ass  For ass he is who so mistakes his station  As to affront th' indulgence of a nation  The time may come nor can be distant far  When judgment must commence successful war  When Genius will revive from second birth  And crush this pigmy tyrant into earth  The lowest muse must suffer pain to stoop  To such a motley indigested group  Where lights are all so faint and shades so strong  Where right so seldom takes the place of wrong  Where ignorance prevails with boundless pride  And talents which might please are misapply'd  Where each man thinks he amply does his duty  And ev'ry woman thinks herself a beauty  'Tis a hard task to paint them as we ought  Almost beyond the stretch of words or thought  And if we should perchance make dullness feel  "'Tis breaking butterflies upon a wheel"  Ross whom we cannot take him all in all  With poignant CHURCHILL

No spark PROMETHEAN animates the whole  Why at the full meridian of thy days  Didst thou so vainly seek for public praise  Why as an ACTOR at such point of age  Attempt to strut thy hour upon the stage  Why madly make so terrible a choice  Of judgement void of figure features voice  Why to contempt spur on with matchless speed  A fool at forty is a fool indeed  Could not the temp'ring honest steel suffice  Let surgeons' instruments sustain thy rise  For spouting insignificant as thine  Will never make thy fame or pocket shine  If by impartial audiences disdain'd  Tho' by a selfish manager

peevish features strain and strive  In vain to keep his characters alive  See long ungraceful wide expanded arms  With a large catalogue of equal charms  Join'd to a voice oh wonderful alliance  That music sets and meaning at defiance  Most in a wide diversity will shew  Some gleams of merit if they cannot glow  But this strange ACTOR for we strange must call  One who shews like deficiency in all  Was form'd by nature on peculiar plan  Or rather by some bungling  journeyman    Yet he's a fav'rite and as such must pass  Thus COLMAN makes each auditor an ass  Whom should the muse in due succession mark  'Tis that same tolerable thirdrate CLARKE  Oh may he never rise to higher place  Who wants fit feelings and essential grace  In medium stile where nought affecting's meant  We think

judg'd impartially thy cause  He must have honour'd thee with warm applause  For sure in Fops and parts of  outrè  kind  All thy competitors fall far behind  All must acknowledge thy superior glee  In the gay cast of laughing Comedy  Yet let us own and take it as a friend  We cannot seabred IRONSIDES commend  Too strain'd in attitude too stiff in speech  The plain rough Tar you cannot justly reach  And we acknowledge with reluctant will  Thro' all his scenes we trace thy BOBADIL  Thy study'd grace is a laborious plan  And shews too oft the PICTURE of a MAN  Yet we behold with pleasure and admire  Thy sportful countenance thy youthful fire  While some reflections on GEORGE COLMAN  Mr Woodward was most ignorantly and illiberally excluded by the quarrel between the managers now restored not very cordially we believe by their reconciliation which also obtained Mr Macklin the opportunity of five nights performance  cease  For making thee an article of peace  MACKLIN now got beyond her youthful bloom  Why was the stage she never liked her doom  Exerts her stinted pow'rs with some applause  Tho' fetter'd with a father's rigid laws  We cannot mechaniz'd instructions love  Nature so trammell'd cannot freely move  Hence dull correctness active Genius binds  And rests insipidly on critic minds  BULKLEY and BAKER pretty women both  To speak against them  gallantry  is loth  But howsoe'er goodnature may condole  To praise their beauty is to praise the whole  Next come a pair with constant pleasure seen  Tho' plain of persons PITT we shew and GREEN  They move they speak they mark the author's thought  And prove their merit is from nature caught  By much the best as far as they engage  Of any females now on either stage  What shall we say of LESSINGHAM the fair  She has of managers been long the care  Oh that regard would make her all their own  And snatch a tasteless milksop from the town  One who for parts eternally would fight  Without the sense or talents to be right  KNIVETON a bauble fit for childish view  Who scarce to Gipsey  Beau Stratagem  could afford her due  KNIVETON as bad as possible to think  Irksome to hear as dead small beer to drink  VINCENT whose age cries loudly for the fund  The provision for superannuated performers planned and humanely promoted as we have been told by Mr HULL  By ev'ry eye of nice distinction shunn'd  Abhorr'd by ev'ry tenderfeeling ear  Is yet brought forward in a youthful sphere  Would she display'd such worth in public life  As she has shewn in mother friend and wife  Applauding multitudes might then contend  Who should stand foremost her assisting friend  MILLER by favour more than nature bless'd  Of foremost characters we see possess'd  What madness guides what partial planet reigns  When insignificance such influence gains  Judgement with calmest patience join'd must frown  When one hand mounts to let the other down  When grief or declamation drooping flags  And screechowl screams tear passion into rags  Give us a sample gods of better store  Or let us never see an actress more  Once in FOOTE's pieces GARDNER gave us joy  But bawls repeated all her pow'rs destroy  No doubt she thinks herself monst'rous fine  And yet is BILLINGSGATE in ev'ry line  MATTOCKS to grant what she may claim as due  Stands in a favourable point of view  Spirit expression and some pleasing tones  For comic archness or for tragic moans  A figure happily dispos'd tho' small  Striking in nought agreeable in all  Sometimes too earnest in desire to please  She steps beyond the boundaries of ease  Forces her features into painful state  And rather sinks attempting to be great  Yet few for gen'ral use can rivals stand  Or such applause in various lights command  Perhaps not one then let our cordial lays  Give what they joy to give impartial praise  When public favour warmly stamps regard  To criticize is perilous and hard  The loudmouth'd multitude rush sweeping by  And houndlike follow as the leaders cry  Yet their mad favour e'en from WILKES to BUTE  We often find a paltry prostitute  So in the mimic state 'tis fashion's laws  Not merit calls forth for popular applause  Thus justice from her equilibrium swerves  Hence YATES enjoys more than she deserves  Puff'd with importance and a sweeping train  Behold she comes insufferably vain  Observe her countenance uplifted high  Pride on her brow and fury in her eye  Mildness or love she cannot represent  On haughtier subjects are her feelings bent  In rage we freely grant she can excell  Who plays a tragic termagant so well  When grief she struggles for 'tis harsh and coarse  Indelicately swell'd with needless force  Her clockwork action painful study shews  In speech or movement nature never glows  'Tis true that plac'd among the bad she shines  As feeble lamps may light the womb of mines  But should a gleam of sunshine strike the sight  Such pallid fires would sink in endless night  Thus ends our painful task a task indeed  Enough to make goodnatur'd bosoms bleed  Why should we Caesar  Domitian remarkable for Flykilling  like anatomize  And seem to triumph in dissecting flies  The answer's plain in such a patient age  'Tis just to rouze and vindicate the stage  FINIS
