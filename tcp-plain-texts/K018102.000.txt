 BIRCH FOR PETER PINDAR Esq A BURLESQUE POEM  BY PINDAROMASTIX  STULTA EST CLEMENTIA CUM TOT UBIQUE  VATIBUS OCCURRAS PERITURAE PARCERE CHARTAE  JUV  LONDON PRINTED FOR G G J AND J ROBINSON PATERNOSTERROW  MDCCLXXXVIII  TO THE CRITICAL REVIEWERS  O YOU who high on learned benches sit  Dread arbiters of dulness and of wit  Whose task it is to mark with eagle eye  Where poets sink too low or soar too high  Judge well my  ups  and  downs  my wit and metre  And swear that Pindar's self was never greater  But ah you won't for none can please like Peter  In Peter's praise you're louder still and louder  I fear that rogue has giv'n you all  lovepowder  O say dread sirs what  Sop in Pan  will please you  Will fattest haunch of buck or doe appease you  Shall rump and dozen speedily be sent you  Shall pheasant hare and partridge compliment you  What Bard can bribe with Sop of  The Cl Reviewers have done the Author the honour to remark that his  Sop in the Pan  was not sufficiently  savoury  Quaere may not their  palates have been vitiated  by too long feasting on Peter Pindar's ragoûuts  better savour  Nor you reject a poet's proffer'd favour  Then grateful deign a little helping puff  One gentle blast from you would be enough  Say but the work's  replete with wit and fun  Quick thro' the land like wildfire it would run  And ere the moon her circling course had roll'd  Two thousand copies would be fairly sold  In my good luck you all should have a share  And sure you'll own such offer's very fair  Perchance your doublets sirs are waxing bare  Perchance your linen wants some small repair  Or if your hats of Ge the Second's reign  Too long expos'd to sun and wind and rain  Have lost their stiff'ning and their jetty hue  Your learned heads I'd straightway crown anew  No longer should your shabby garb proclaim  Neglected merit and a nation's shame  T' equip you all genteelly  comme il faut  On Rns our friends I'd boldly draw  Nor fear dishonour of protested bill  'Midst rapid sale of  Birch  and thriving till  But if ten thousand copies once were sold  Your brazenheaded canes should blaze with burnish'd gold  And now dread sirs if all this will not win you  Why then dread sirs the Dl sure is in you  But neither  you  nor  he  my sportive Muse shall hinder  I  will  have one more slap at wicked Peter Pindar  BIRCH FOR PETER PINDAR ESQ c  AH welladay  Ah welladay  What shall I say  What shall I say  Ah in what dictionary shall I find  Meet words to vent the grief that labours in my mind  O Muse a hapless brother Bard deplore  Who's fallen fallen fall'n to rise no more  Mourn all ye friends of Peter and of fun  Mourn very hard indeedand when ye've done  Come listen to my lay  And mind what I've to say  Now you must know this cock of rhyme  Was hatch'd in some unlucky time  Some planet of malignant pow'r  Presided o'er his natal hour  I see I see  The Fates decree  Or do or say whate'er we can  To serve this poor unhappy man  Some dire disaster must attend  And so he'll come to no good end  You know  Vide eme  Sop in the Pan  at Court I got him plac'd  But now he's ousted and disgrac'd  Did I not give him good advice  And that not once but twice or thrice  But all advice I fear is vain  The rogue has been at his old tricks again  Nay what is worse than all that's past  He now is held in durance fast  As you will hear if you'll attend  The following story to its end  Scarce had he warm'd himself at Court  Before he fell to wicked sport  Well fed and cloth'd he there begun  To play all sorts of wanton fun  Complaints were brought from ev'ry quarter  One while he'd steal a maid of honour's garter  And by such flatt'ring token prove  How high he stood in maiden's love  Another while perdue as dead  He'd couch 'neath maid of honour's bed  As if intent on nightly wickedness  But now I'm well assur'd 'twas nothing less  Bromfield  and  Hawkins  both declare  That he could do no mischief there  I mean in maid of honour's bed  For all his mischief's in his head  In ambush thus he only lay  To hear what they in sleep would say  And then forsooth the wag would run  And tell their secrets all in fun  On this the maidens all combin'd  And in petition formal join'd  With loud complaints against our Bard  Declaring it was very hard  That he their private chambers should invade  And hear what they in midnight dreaming said  Such test was far too much for any mortal maid  Of waking maids all own there are great numbers  But ah what earthly maid can answer for her slumbers  But what they most of all things fear'd  Was that he'd publish all he heard  They knew that Peter had a tattling tongue  Which blabb'd out all but chief if aught was wrong  Should he in nightly ambuscade discover  That they in sleeping fancy only had a lover  Of courtly maids this sland'rous tale  In Peter Pindar's Ode would stand  And fly forthwith in Palmer's mail  To all the gossips in the land  In shortif he must be indulg'd in suchlike sport  The sisters one and all resolv'd to quit the Court  The virtuous maidens rueful plaints were heard  And full of reason and of truth appear'd  Peter was question'd on these heads  Of maidens garters and their beds  Was by his master reprimanded  And to his proper post remanded  With charge no more to be so rude  As thus indecently t' intrude  To gratify a curious whim  For maids or not what was't to him  But not the virtuous maids alone  His fellowservants ev'ry one  Complain'd of saucy Peter  His gibing and his metre  But chief of all the LaureatBard  With reason good averr'd 'twas hard  That he could never make a Birthday Song  To 'scape the witty malice of his tongue  That when he did his very best  Of all his words he'd make a jest  Oft as he form'd a sober rhyme  Or strove to soar in verse sublime  The rogue was sure to mock him with another  And now would call him Tom and now would call him Brother  Long had he borne his arch grimace  But now grew weary of his place  Rather than be the butt of monkey Peter  He'd quit the trade and deal no more in metre  To fly from such intol'rable attack  He'd forfeit both his bays and marks and sack  Of chaplains all he'd make a jest  For Peter never lov'd a priest  He always was a very wicked boy  And never would the Sabbathday employ  In conning over  The phrase is rather stiffrump'd but Peter Pindar must answer for it  Biblephrase sublime  His Sabbaths all were giv'n to fiddling and to rhyme  His mother told him 'twas a shameful thing  To make such wicked songs about his Kg  Ah son she'd say 'twill bring thee to the gallows  As sure as spending Sabbathday in alehouse  And as he added year to year  He more and more alarm'd her fear  Lest he should take to wicked ways  And in a halter end his days  But after this digression short  Let's now resume our thread at Court  And Peter's farther pranks report  Bedchamber lord or page in waiting  Was sure to bear his waggish baiting  Whoever came to Court  Was Peter's butt and sport  At ev'ry human ailing  At ev'ry human failing  Whether halt or blind or lame  He'd loll his tongue and make his game  With hasty speech and utt'rance quick  He'd play you ev'ry monkey trick  'Tis said his rl master didn't escape  The mimic wagg'ry of this rhyming ape  At length the courtiers one and all  Determin'd to effect his fall  And yet the question may admit of doubt  Wheth'r all their efforts could have got him out  So much his master lov'd him  Till he a traitor prov'd him  Now gentle reader let us straight repair  To councilhall and learn what passes there  And merry people all throughout the nation  Pray listen to this droll examination  Py Cl met  Lord Testy thus ad∣dresses the Board  My Lords you're summon'd here  A horrid tale to hear  Of Peter Pindar's dark design  Which calls for punishment condign  To kill the Kg enslave the nation  And bring us all to desolation  Battalions thick in armour stood  Prepar'd t' embark and shed our blood  To force our wives our fortunes to devour  And bring in Popish faith and arbitrary pow'r  I wish this dev'lish imp of rhyme  Could be hang'd now'twould save our tin  But this is not our English way  For ev'ry rogue must have fair play  In our proceedings let there be no flaw  The culprit must be hang'd by reg'lar course of law  A Frenchman appears before the Cl to inform against Peter Pindar  Ld Ty  Where is this Frenchman If he's in the way  We now will hear what he has got to say  But French I do not understand  Is no interpreter at hand  Interpreter  O oui Milor

Monsieur  Neckar  l'Archevêque de Sens  Il connut aussi bien son sécretaire  Qui lui racontoit une etrange affaire  D'un certain drole ici en grand emploi  Même  accoucheur  il avoit dit a Roi  Ld Ty

little boy  Instant on this burst forth such loud uproar  As ne'er was heard at Cl Board before  Beards wigs and noses wagged all  And unextinguish'd laughter shook the hall  Not more when merry Gods above  Surround the festal board of Jove  While nectar and ambrosia crown the feast  And  Peter Pindar  cracks his witty jest  P V  to In∣terp aside  Mais pourquoi faiton tant d'eclat de rire  Interp  Mon ami o'est la mode en Angleterre  Ld Ty  Come leave your prattlingif you don't go on  With this curs'd bus'ness we shall ne'er have done  Interp  to P V  De finir ce rapport depechez vous  Monsieur

écrit que le derrière  Du Roi ici il gardela clef pour cela il tient  Et que sans lui le Roi ne jamais feroit rien  Interp  Dat is Milor dis Peter Pindar  He write dat he your Kg can hinder  From do one certain ting when he have mind  Because he keep de key of his  behind  On this Lord Ty gave him  such  a look  But not a nerve of dauntless Peter shook  Parler Vrai continues  Et que pour pension

Pour servir à leurs plans de politique  Interp  Dat is Milor dis Peter Pindar mention  If dey vil give five hundred pound of pemsion  Dat he may have roastbeef and wine  On which he dearly love to dine  He vil not let your England Kg  Pour tirty day do dat same ting  By dis to give some better chance  To serve de politique of France  Ld Ty  Bravo Interpreteur fidele  Thou dost thy office very well  Now let thy brother Parler Vrai  Declare what more he has to say  Interp  Milor I know he have no more to tell  Ld Ty  Then you'll withdrawso far we go on well  Ld Ty  addressing P Pindar  Sohere are pretty doing master Peter  Since first I heard of thee and thy dn'd metre  I've all along had some foreboding thought  That stocks or pillory would be thy lot  But hanging now I see and nothing less  Will serve thy turnCome then thou'dst best confess  Thou'lt save much cost by such a resolution  And ease us of the plague of prosecution  Peter  in∣trepidly  Hold hold my Lord not quite so fast  If  you  are  I  am not in haste  I've some small skill in law as well as rhyme  And mean t' avail myself of further time  I'm not to be browbeaten so  In ev'ry action that I do  I know how far 'tis safe to go  Produce your Frenchmanlet him swear  To any given day or year  I'll prove that at the very time  I was employ'd in making rhyme  Or making up a pill  Or bolus which you will  Next let him swear to placethen I  Will swear and prove an  alibi  Think not I'm so abandon'd and forlorn  I've ne'er an affidavitfriend to serve a turn  If letters sign'd by me are brought to light  I'll prove that I can neither read nor write  And spite of you and all your law  I'll save my bacon by some flaw  Ld Ty  Was ever impudence a match for this  Quondam empiric say'st thou common Fame  No no thou'rt wrong in thy hypothesis  Old  Rock  himself was ne'er so void of shame  Some quondam scrivener I ween  Of brazen front and perjur'd tongue  To lie and swear thro' thick and thin  And make the rightful cause appear the wrong  But Peter trust not to thy skill  In quirks and quibbles of the law  I'll squeeze thee in attainder's bill  Where's then thy baconsaving flaw  Peter  Well if I must be hang'd I must  All men must die and come to dust  Then what imports it when or where  Or soon or late or here or there  Reclin'd on couch or propp'd in easy chair  Or pendent high in ambient field of air  No form of death can scare your dauntless bard  I'll kiss my friend the hangman and  die hard  Ld Ty  Well Peter justice shall be done thee  Whatever judgment falls upon thee  Meanwhile I'd have thee better spend thy time  And leave off this bad trade of making rhyme  Peter  in∣trepid to the last  No that my Lord I surely will not do  I'll make one more dn'd ode for you  Insult not o'er my fallen state  Perhaps yourself or soon or late  May fall like meit was the ca  Of better men who held your place  The losing gamesters by and by may win  Ins  may go out and  outs  once more come in  And oh  If so  Then your fell foe  Will work your woe  Impeachments thick  Will follow quick  And make you kick  Against the prick  But Fx will stick  As close as tick  Nor quit you till he sends you to old Nick  Ld Ty  aside  Sure never impudence on this side Hell  This rascal Peter Pindar's did excel  Addressing the Cl  My Lords this is a horrid horrid thing  A foul conspiracy against the Kg  To stop the passage of his rl life  I do not say by poison or by knife  But by a method still more deep and dark  Such as would leave no indicating mark  Nor aught of outward symptom that might lead  To trace the author of such shocking deed  My Lords in all my reading  My Lords in all my pleading  A case in point I never knew  The case is altogether new  Search all Kingkilling cases  The Jesuits were but asses  Compar'd with this  astrictive  fellow Peter  Dn'd  costive  in his plot however  lax  in metre  My Lords I freely own I'm no physician  I cannot speak with Warwicklane precision  Nor  Galen  nor  Hippocrates  my book  But old blackletter  Littleton  with  Coke  But lawyers sure may have as good pretence  As any other men to common sense  Allow me this and I can reason give  Why in such case no mortal man can live  To shut such channel must be certain death  Not more so stopping up the vital breath  How long such case might go I will not say  I cannot fix the limits to a day  But to my reason it appears most plain  That half a month would kill the stoutest man  And sure you'll own my Lords in suchlike ail  The Kg's prerogative can nought avail  In cases of evacuation  And ev'ry other operation  Pertaining to our common frame  The rl functions are the same  With those which Nature calls from you and me  In this  my Lords  at least  I trust we all agree  Then from your own experience freely speak  And say what man among you ever  went a week  This said a gentle murm'ring sound  Of hear him hear him circled round  Reechoed by a large majority  Tho' not unanimous the fav'ring cry  The  Scottish corps  in deepest wonder  All sat amaz'd as struck with thunder  To hear Lord Ty talk at such a rate  Then crowding all together tête à tête  Their  notes posterior  they compar'd  And all with one consent declar'd  Such argument was void of sense  And counter to their  own experience  Some said the mon was madbut all agreed  He'd got a glass o' whisky in his head  At length Tweedside on Ty fix'd his eye  And holding forth his leg uprose to make reply  Ld Tweedside  Hoot mon ye talk just like a fule  I'll send ye cross the Tweed to schule  And there ye'll see our bonny lads can gang  Without the like o' this the winter lang  Wous mon were we to cast away our meat  Wi' ilka moon we'd soon hae nought to cat  Fra side o' Tweed to Johnny Groats  Ye wadna find a peck o' oats  But here's sic wastefu' wark as ne'er was seen  Ye cram your weams fra morning until e'en  And gin ye canna lat it out  Ye're than au fou o' bile and gout  Not sae wi' uswe gang a moon and mare  And yet our weams are neither sick nor sare  My Lords I dinna speak from partiality  Nor any cause my Lords of nationality  This Peter Pundar ye may see  Is nought to me nae mare than ye  My Lords I trow ye ken full  eel  I never countenanc'd the cheel  Nor mean to do't for this ane thing  The fallow does nae like his Kg  Because he wadna buy his sang  In that I own he's very wrang  But as to this conspiracy  I'll wager that it's au a lie  I canna think that sic a deed  Could ever enter the loon's head  But if it did how could he do't  My Lords I canna mak that out  Ye ken full weel to Court he never gangs  The kallon gets his bread by making sangs  My Lords his time's employ'd the leevelang day  To win baubees by lilting o' the lay  As to your idle tales o' this and that  Of accoucheur a Roi and G knows what  My Lords I wad believe as soon  Ld Ty giving Ld Tweedside a look of disapprobation  We're just now sitting i' the moon  Hoot mon don't luke at me sae surly  And mak not au this hurlyburly  About a thing o' nought  Till ye hae further sought  Consider weel what ye're about  Or else ye'll get us au turn'd out  Troth mon I did nae think ye sic a fule  To bring us here to be the ridicule  Of folks o' ilka rank and station  Bath high and low throughout the nation  A balladmaker stop up the Kg's weam  O Lourd O Lourd we'll au be brought to shame  My Lords we munna shew our faces  The folks will call us fules and asses  And weel I wat some cheel will tak the hint  And stick us au together in a print  Yes yes my Lords ye'll see your sels in etches  Your Lawland lads are deev'lish quick at sketches  Besides that fallow Pundar ther ere lang  Will link us au into a bonny sang  Troth now I think on't 'twad be better  Before we rise to tuck up Peter  We soon could put  him  out o' th' way  And stop the lilting o' his lay  The loss o' sic a loon wad nae be much  I've got a bit o' inkle i' my pouch  If auld friend Ty will but gie the beck  We'll mak a noose and put it round his neck  And sae e'en lat him swing  But dinna tell the Kg  If he should speer for Peter we may say  The loon brak out o' jail and ran away  And now my noble Lords what say ye au  Wha votes for Highland execution law  We'd find some hole about the Cl House  Where he wad lig as still as ony mouse  I see ye laugh my Lords and weel ye may  I dinna mean to hang the lad today  I only meant a fling at Ty there  For bringing us like April ninnies here  Gude faith I'd hae him luke about  And see how he can get us out  O' sic a scrape as thisfor should the Kg  Surprise us in't 'twad be a serious thing  He'd turn us out to seek our bread  Wi' auld friend Ty at our head  For wha wad keep sic fules about him  Sic cl's only fit for Gotham  My Lords I fear I've tedious been  And by friend Ty's lukes and ein  He's in a deev'lish angry mood I find  I dinna care for thatI'll speak my mind  In points o' law I readily allow  To him we au mun doff our hats and bow  On this side Tweed  I meanbut in a case  O' costive weam he talks just like an ass  I see he does nae ken what he's about  If he wad let me I could help him out  But this he winna dohe'll hae his way  And troth I fear he'll lead us au astray  I see this silly bus'ness mun gang on  Weel weel among sae many fules I am but one  Now let's suppose this Frenchman's tale a fact  I canna deem't a treasonable act  For what's a moon that could nae kill a Kg  Did I not tell you 'twas a common thing  For my NorthBritish countrymen to gang  Twa moons or threeAnd yet we are as strang  As ye are hereas free fra ails save now and then  A little bit o' yuking outwardly i' th' skin  As to that babbling Frenchman's silly chat  About a pension or the like o' that  The tale appears to me an arrant fiction  And fraught wi' nonsense and wi' contradiction  If pension was the object o' his game  Ye ken my Lords he might hae that at hame  But pension'd slave he winna be  Nor sell his WulksandLiberty  For au that Kgs and Courts can gie  He does nae like their straitlac'd ways  Their proclamations and their Sabbathdays  Kirkganging orders mak him sick  He likes to wag his feedlestick  And thinks it is the better way  To chase the muckle Deel away  By playing Bobbing Joan and sic like airs  Than singing psalms at kirk and saying pray'rs  Lord Sidewind  Here by your leave my Lord  Let me put in a word  Permit me to object  That tho' he did reject  A handsome proffer'd pension  here  Nathless the culprit might  elsewhere  Make hearty zealous application  Mov'd both by int'rest and by inclination  What tho' a  Ge  has ever been his snarling  Does this evince that  Louis  is n't his darling  I apprehend this was the very matter  Which prompted Peter to become a traitor  For  Brunswick  's line he bears a  crabb'd affection  Because the House of  Bourbon  is his predilection  Ld Tweed∣side  in reply  Hoot hoot I canna think him sic a ninny  To pouch a loui rather than a guinea  And au for nought but love and itch o' treason  Sic deed wad prove the fallow void o' reason  A subject fit in murky cell  Wi' Bedlamites for aye to dwell  No no my Lords say what ye will  The kallon has some conscience still  Kg Ge he says has bairns and times are hard  And for this cause he lately has declar'd  It gangs against his grain and he's nae willing  To tak fra him a single siller shilling  Weel then I argue thus  a fortiori    Gude faith 'twad be a strange unlikely story  That fond of Louis as ye say he is  He'd ask for siller at a time like this  Hoot hoot ye ken full weel my Lords I trow  The Grand Monarque's a brokenmerchant now  And to their sorrow creditors have found  He canna pay a mark in ilka pound  Is this a time to ask for pension  Amang sic quarrel and dissension  That Louis canna get a sous  To pay his tradesmen's bills and keep his house  But now my Lords I fear ye're weary grown  O' my long talk and Ty 'gins to frown  He seems to be in a most deev'lish passion  As if he'd gie us Pundar's sangDn  Seize ye auWeel now I've said my say  And now my auld friend Ty fire away  The colour glow'd in Ty's cheek  Thrice he essay'd but could not speak  With blow of fist so fierce his choler burn'd  'Tis said he split the Cl Board in twain  At length when wonted pow'rs of voice return'd  He thus begun in high indignant strain  Ld Ty  My Lords I don't regard one single jot  Of all that sell from that  drybellied Scot  Quick rous'd at this and fraught with ire  His eyeballs flashing hostile fire  Tweedside retortedDn your blude  Gin I had not a mind as gude  For this illib'ral national reflaction  To make your life and saul pay satisfaction  For au ye luke sae grim and talk sae big  I neither heed ye nor your muckle wig  Order order order all  Order echoed through the hall  Lord Hopeful  O fie O fie my Lords command your passion  Or else our Cls will disgrace the nation  Rude language this unmeet to fall  From members grave in Cl hall  O may this fray be never told  O may no tongue the tale unfold  And yet I speak it with great sorrow  The tale will all be told tomorrow  Perhaps ev'n now some patriotspy  In corner snug is standing by  To catch up ev'ry word that falls  Within the compass of these walls  O tell it not in Gath  O tell it not in Bath  But sure it will be told afar  And sure it will be publish'd near  Then what will foreign nations say  When they're inform'd of this affray  They'll say our Cl is all riot  No better than a Polish diet  O glorious news for Shdn and Fx  O welcome subject for their witty jokes  How will they chuckle when they once find out  We make as much  fracas within  as they  without  But in one point they're wiser far than we  Among themselves they very well agree  My Lords our measures only they oppose  Disdain not to learn wisdom from your foes  Ld Courtly  My Lords I hope you'll one and all attend  And mark the prudence of our premierfriend  A forward youth he is of wond'rous parts  He charms our ears and captivates our hearts  Persuasion ever dwells upon his tongue  So very much  I never think him wrong  Endow'd with all his father's force and fire  In wisdom grave the son excels the sire  In years advanc'd thrice ten or little more  He boasts the cautious temper of three score  My Lords let  loss of place  alarm our fears  And bind us to this youth who's wise above his years  Ld Makepeace  My Lords this prudent motion I for one  In which I trust I shall not stand alone  Most cordially approveAnd now my Lords  I'm upI wish to utter a few words  Happy if any thing that falls from me  Should be the means to make us all agree  Revolving this strange matter in my mind  The only proper method I can find  Is to call in two men of famous skill  Well read in ev'ry book on costive ill  The sons of Aesculapius best will know  How far a case like this may safely go  My Lords you'll own this is a point that falls  Without the competency of these walls  The question was no sooner mov'd  Than by the Board  nem con  approv'd  Enter two Physicians  Ld Category  Well doctors you have heard the case no doubt  What are your thoughts upon it Pray speak out  Dr Primus  My Lord I think the matter  Is possible in nature  For any man or woman  Tho' 'tis not very common  In suchlike case to go  For thirty days or so  Secure from all alarms of dissolution  Or any injury to constitution  Ld Cy  Did ever case like this in all  Your practice and experience fall  Dr P  I cannot say it did  Ld Cy  Then reason give  How costive patient in such case could live  Dr P  My Lord in fault of such evacuation  Our system operates by transpiration  That is my Lord by porous exsudation  Ld Cy  to Dr Secundus  Now Doctor give us your advice  Dr Secundus  I will my Lord and in a trice  And partly with my friend I sayContent  In other points I widely must dissent  For in default of such evacuation  I own my learned Brother's transpiration  In plainer terms  his porous exsudation  Might help Dame Nature for twelve days or so  Further than this no mortal man can go  The stoutest Kg that ever wore a crown  In half a month must lay his sceptre down  Ld Cy  to the Board  My Lords this case is harder than we thought  And Gknows when to issue 'twill be brought  What do you say Our time should now be spent  In thinking of some new expedient  Ld Din∣nerbell  My Lords if my poor feeble voice be heard  This puzzling point had better be deserr'd  And to the learned corps in Wklane reserr'd  Meanwhile my Lords we may go home and dine  Recruit our spirits with a glass of wine  May take a little private recreatiion  And then resume this deep deliberation  Done done  Nem con  Now gentle reader should some Lord invite thee  Perhaps a sumptuous dinner may delight thee  But if no lordly invitations come  Then cat thy muttonchop and be content at home  But if nor house nor home be thine  Nor muttonchop nor silver coin  Alas thy case is very hard  Thou'dst better change it with our Bard  Peter lives well and at free charge  Until he's set once more at large  And that I think must be ere long  Unless Lord Ty right or wrong  To shew how far his pow'r can go  In wreaking vengeance on a foe  Should grasp him in his arbitrary paw  And give him  Vide State Trials Bp Ay's Case  Bishop Atterbury's law  But if he does this won't hang Peter  Nor stop th' effusions of his metre  'Tis true such law would make him prance  And send him cross the sea to France  But Ty's utmost malice  No further goes than  Calais  From thence our Bard may strait proceed  And at Versailles its merits plead  What tho' the plot did not succeed  His will was ready for the deed  Ev'n good intentions of this sort  Are well receiv'd at Bourbon's Court  It ever was the Gallic nature  To hug a rebel and a traitor  Whene'er they find a rogue in grain  For future jobs his service they retain  Here may our Bard snug refuge take  As did ere while that Yankee snake  Like Peter foster'd by his Kg  Till he shot forth his vengeful sting  To wound the land which gave him bread  And rais'd from earth his recreant head  And if capricious Fortune should befriend him  And old  Ben Franklin  's wond'rous luck attend him  Peter highhonour'd by our Gallic foe  May figure at Versailles a rebel Plenipo  But now 'tis time our bus'ness should go on  I wish these guzzling Cl Lords were done  For sure they take a tedious while to dine  Oh here they come wellflush'd with rosy wine  Twobottle men I warrant you or more  Two did I sayMore likely three or four  President of the Board  Once more my Lords we're all in Cl met  Let ev'ry noble member take his seat  And now I hope you'll be good boys  Refrain from quarrel and from noise  Commit no outrage or disorder  Or I must call you all to order  Ld Ty  My Lord you've spoken like a prudent man  And keep us all to order  if you can  Ld Category  Is there no message come from Wk lane  Can't all the learned there this case explain  Dr De∣puty  My Lord in due obedience to your high command  Deputed from our learned body here I stand  With long deliberation  On points of transpiration  Orporous exsudation  Our minds are all in deep and dark confusion  And cannot grope the way to fair conclusion  My Lords the members of our college  Do all with one consent acknowledge  The case is not within their knowledge  The point suspended must remain  Till France and Italy and Spain  With ev'ry other learned nation  Have penn'd a Latin dissertation  When all our rays of science are collected  We hope sufficient light will be reflected  Some fair conclusion to make out  And clear this point beyond all doubt  Meantime my Lords you'll not forget  That we've receiv'd  no money  yet  You know my Lords with men of our description  The maxim isno guinea no prescription  In this one case our brethren all agree  That nothing must be done without a fee  This wanting not a word they'll write or speak  But keep within their teeth their Latin and their Greek  If then you'd know our whole collected sense  You must not be too sparing of your pence  Our name is Legionwe are many  And ev'ry man must have his guinea  Down with a hundred thousand pounds or so  We'll then begin and see how far 'twill go  Instant at name of hundred thousand pounds  Lord Hopeful starting from his seat cry'dZounds  This Peter Pindar plagues us more than Hastings  Amidst such lavish spendings and such wastings  My sinking fund will ne'er go on  And then my Lords we're all undone  For Fx and Bke will pour forth fierce orations  And drive us from our places and our stations  Doctor we give no answer now  Tomorrow you shall further know  Dr Deputy withdraws  Ld Ty  to the Board  My Lords we nothing further can discover  This Peter Pindar's trial muststand over  When Wklane this puzzling question clears  Or stronger evidence from France appears  I'll send a proper summons to you all  And hope you'll meet me here in Cl Hall  Meanwhile till we have fairly try'd him  Pen ink and paper shall not be denied him  Peter  Thank you my Lord I'll use your favour well  And this my next dn ode shall tell  Cl adjourns  Peter I see thy cause will tire them out  Yes yes thou'lt get off now I make no doubt  But what avails this one escape  Thou'lt soon be in another scrape  For ah my illstarr'd rhyming brother  Thou must be hang'd one day or other  What say'st thou Peter to all this  Peter  Why faith I take it much amiss  That thou'st stopp'd short of thy intention  To sport thy Muse with my suspension  Long while I've been in tiptoe expectation  To see how thou'dst perform the operation  But this postponing is an artful scheme  My penetrating eye perceives thy drist  Thy Muse unequal to the  lofty theme  Would hide her nakedness with this poor shift  Forgive me if I do thee wrong  By rash conjecture of thy song  I grant thou hast some little skill  I see that thou hast words at will  In common chat and suchlike humble sport  Sermoni propiora  seems thy forte  But where's thy  simile  and  phrase sublime  For Fancy's flights I fear thou hast no rhyme  Noloftiness of song is not for thee  But Homer Virgil Milton and for ME  And now my hand is fairly in  I'll shew thee how thou must begin  If thou would'st boldly soar in epic line  And rival Homer's lofty song or mine  Now cock thine eye  And see me fly  "Of Ty's direful wig of vengeful laws  "Of plot and costive Kg the tragic cause  "Which launch'd from Tyburntree to Pluto's reign  "The soul of tuneful Bard untimely slain  "Sing heav'nly Muse c"Thus must thy numbers flow  To hurl a lofty Bard to shades below  And always end thy song with brilliant dash  Which Frenchmen call  eclat  and Englishmen call  flash  Observe my lessons well and by and by  Thy feeble unfledg'd Muse may learn to fly  Now Peter Pindar without joking  Thou'rt grown so saucy and provoking  Thou'lt rouse my chol'ric indignation  To give thee such a flagellation  As thou hadst never yet  And wilt not soon forget  Then take this little sample of my skill  And own I've  similes  as well as  words  at will    Fox and Grapes Simile  As Fox which eyes the ripen'd grapes  And knows no fruit is sweeter  But if he  can't  won't have those grapes  So'rt thou O Reynard Peter    The disappointed Swain Simile  As Swain who woos a pretty maid  And fain at church would meet her  But ah whose rival  wins  that maid  So'rt thou greenwillow Peter    The Old Maid Simile  As ancient Maid who will not wed  If suitors won't entreat her  And sorely rails at marriagebed  So'rt thou forsaken Peter    Grubstreet Bard Simile  As vilest Bard who mocks his Kg  In motley dogg'rel metre  Still disregarded by his Kg  So'rt thou O Grubstreet Peter    Pindar and his Muse  like to like  As is thy darling and prolific Muse  Of easy virtue and unblushing face  So'rt thou forgive me if I wrong accuse  Devoid of honour loyalty or grace  Peter  What touch my honour rather strike me dead  My dearest rhyming Brother Peter  So well I love thee and thy metre  I would not touch a hair upon thy head  With such a pleasant and facetious fellow  I'd sooner drink a bottle and be mellow  My dearest Bard with thee O may I swing  If I don't love thee as thou lov'st thy Kg  But as to honour Peter say no more  Repeat no grievance aggravate no sore  Peter  Honour I had    Yes yes no doubt no doubt  But usage hard has worn thy honour out  But 'tis no loss for what canst thou  With this same honour have to do  It never sold thy bolus or thy pill  It never paid thy printer Ky's bill  If then thy honour brings no profit  What good to thee can e'er come of it  Thy brother wit Jack Falstaff us'd to say  That of such useless bauble he'd have none  Which could not keep him out of danger's way  Nor heal a wound nor set a broken bone  Of Falstaff's prudence I produce this sample  For Peter Pindar's lesson and example  For sure you are congenial souls  As ever met o'er flowing bowls  Or e'er carous'd with giddy heir apparent  Or made disloyal jest of rl parent  O had I Shakespeare's deathless lyre  O would his Muse my verse inspire  Thy name O Peter still should float along  The stream of Time in  neverdrowning  song  And whilst the years in long succession roll  Still  Jack  and  Peter  should swim cheek by jowl  But now of flourishing enough  Let's find the thread where we broke off  My Muse forgetsO fie upon her  But now I recollect'twas honour  Of this I tell thee once again  That honour's loss will be thy gain  This honour would not let thee sing  Nor mock and ridicule thy Kg  Such loyal monitor would strike thee dumb  And poet  Pindar  turn to poet  mum  And this would be thy certain ruin  Thy woeful starving and undoing  But this is only wasting precious time  I'm now to give thee simile  sublime  The Gibbet Simile  As when some rogue's on lofty gibbet hung  Some rogue as impudent as ever swung  His ghastly corpse all dangling in the air  Retaining ev'n in death a dire Kingkilling air  Sure Peter this must freeze thy very blood  Thou'rt very bad if this won't make thee good  But since thou'rt so ambitious and presumptuous grown  I'll hoist thee higher stillbut then I'll fetch thee down  But be n't afraid 'tis all in sport  And thou'lt receive but little hurt  Nay in this game thou'lt be the only winner  For thou not I wilt carry off the dinner  The Kite Simile  As when some Ctswd Kite ascends on high  Waves in the wind or sails along the sky  If prey's in view and hunger presses hard  Slap down he comes to snatch a chick from poultry yard  Now Peter thou hast stol'n that chicken  'Twill serve thee for a little picking  I guess that thou'rt a greedy elf  Thou'lt eat it ev'ry bit thyself  Perchance to Ky thou wouldst help a wing  But deuce a bit to me or ev'n to Ge thy Kg  Peter I like not shooting in the dark  Because not one in three may hit thy mark  Give me that open daylight rebel poet  Who tells his name nor cares if all men know it  But thou behind this Pindar's mask art snug  As biting vermin latent close in rug  By Gods unnam'd by British men clep'dbug  Yes this bushfight  Is thy delight  How oft like coward savage hast thou laid  In dark and silent nightly ambuscade  Thy spiteful feather'd shaft to wing  And wound the heart of Ge thy Kg  A Kg who never injur'd thee  But very much offended me  By such disuse of rl shears  And such neglect of Peter Pindar's ears  Such cowardly attack  I never will forgive  I'll point thee out a black  As long as e'er I live  I've more to addwhich further still will grate  For tho' thou art a witty fellow  With thee I never will be mellow  Assassins ever were my mortal hate  Yes now more seriously I come to think  I must recall my former hasty motion  If e'er with rebel rogues like thee I drink  May baneful juice of hemlock be my potion  Moreover Peter if the Fates decree  That judgment must o'ertake both thee and me  For this our crime  Of wicked rhyme  If thou and I must both be shipp'd away  To found new families at Bot'ny Bay  Before such foreign trip I take  This first inquiry will I make  What passengers are going  And if I find that thou art there  I'll cry rash mariner forbear  Nor be thy own undoing  If life or ship or cargo thy regard  For once O take a convict's word  From steerage drag that wicked wicked Bard  And toss him headlong overboard  Now reader faith my Muse is at stand  What further sport to give thee on the land  And so to end the matter  I'll dash him in the water  And here I've  such  a simile to treat with  As every day I'm sure thou wilt not meet with  Thou'lt swear that even Pindar Peter  Ne'er made a longer or a better  I'll launch him off in  majestoso  Because 'tis fit that he should go so  As when some convict cleaves the wat'ry way  Condemn'd to colonize at Bot'ny Bay  The bark unequal to the sinful freight  Her timbers groan beneath the pressive weight  Lo how the welkin low'rs what clouds arise  See angry Neptune mounts into the skies  On ev'ry side tremendous billows roar  Old Ocean's rous'd and foams from shore to shore  See lightnings flash hark dreadful thunders roll  And rend the black'ning sky from pole to pole  The trembling pilot quits the helm and leaves  His bark the sport of raging winds and waves  Hark what shrieks and dismal skies  Hark what crashing  Hark what slashing  Hark what bumping  Hark what thumping  Rumbling jumbling  Fumbling tumbling  Cursing swearing  Ripping tearing  Shouting bawling  Mainmast falling  Planks all starting  Decks all parting  Friends lamenting  Foes relenting  Ranting raving  Mercy craving  Peter trembling  Not dissembling  Pindar quaking  For odemaking  Vessel rocking found'ring sinking  Sailors wicked and unthinking  Ah not lov'd grog but briny water drinking  Drowning and blasting one another's eyes  Pause ad libitum  Theredown she goes with Peter Pindar in her  This 'tis to have on board a grievous sinner  But lo who's he that floats upon the main  By Jupiter 'tis Peter  up  again  Do all I can to keep him down  This buoyant fellow will not drown  I see our poet's tuneful breath  Will not be stopp'd by  wat'ry  death  But now again I'm at a stand  How I shall get him back to land  O would some vessel but appear in view  Or passing to the old world or the new  Huzzaa dolphin charm'd by Peter's song  Bestrid by Peter nimbly glides along  Alternate  up  and  down  he steers his course  Like Master Tommy riding hobbyhorse  Say Peter didst thou ever ride so prettily before  Cheer up my boyThou'lt soon behold thy native shore  Kind dolphin speed thy way to Plymouth Sound  And land thy poet sasc on Cornish ground  Rejoice O friends of Peter and of ode  You'll see him soon he's posting on the road  Escap'd from perils both of land and main  Your Bard is turn'd upon your hands again  FINIS
