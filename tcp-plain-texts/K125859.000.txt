 North East  VIEW  of the CITY of CARLISLE  Ja  s  Lowes Sculp  THE HISTORY AND ANTIQUITIES OF THE CITY OF CARLISLE AND ITS VICINITY  BY WILLIAM HUTCHINSON ESQ  CARLISLE  PRINTED BY F JOLLIE  M DCC XCVI  NW VIEW of CARLISLE CASTLE  From a Drawing in the Possesion of TR Maunsell Esq  James Lowes Sculp  PLAN of the CITY of CARLISLE and  PLACES ADJACENT  From a Drawing in the Possesion of J R Maunsell Esq  map of Carlisle  THE CITY OF CARLISLE  THE traveller approaching from the south has the best view of the city seat∣ed on a fine eminence gradually emerging from an extensive plain of rich cultivated land The waters of the Frith are seen on the one hand with the ad∣jacent levells the back ground of the landscape is beautifully variegated by the irregular swells of the whole Scotch promontory extending towards the Irish sea The walls strengthened with an arrangement of buttresses at irregular distances lies upon one angle to the view in part concealing the houses of the city and boldly overtoped by the square tower of the castle and the august and solemn structure of the cathedral This view of Carlisle is the more striking as there is no adjacent eminence from which cause the city looks more majestic as it crowns so beautiful a plain  The city is walled round the fortifications towards Scotland appearing the most modern they are formed of better squared stones than several other parts of the works The east and south sides are supported by a multitude of buttresses which we presume have been built up occasionally to strengthen the decaying parts of the wall It is watered by three fine rivers the Eden on the north the Peterill on the east and Caude on the west There are three gates to the city which from their different aspects are called the English Irish and Scotch Gates On  the approach from Penrith on the south you enter the English Gates on the ap∣proach from Wigton on the southwest is the Irish Gate and the Scotch Gate to the north opens upon the bridges The walls are embrazured but without any earthwork The English Gate is guarded by a very strong machicolated gate flanked by circular towers of great strength the guns mounted therein in several tiers would effectually sweep every approach This gateway with its towers and other works is commonly called the Citadel  "An oblong with three round bastions"PENNANTThe ancient entrance into the city was through the citadel  and was erected by the order of King Henry VIII The castle consists of various works but being kept up as a garrisoned place we conceive it imprudent to describe them minutely  There were several officers appointed to this fortress viz a governor deputy governor townmajor engineer barrackmaster storekeeper head gunner three quarter gunners and a person to buy in and deliver out coals and candles to the garrison For many years prior to the governor of this city was chosen from one of the representatives in parliament and most of the subordinate places in the gar∣rison were given to the freemen of the city and generally members of the corporation so that frequently the chief magistrate was a quarter gunnerL For a list of the governors see page  The donjon or great tower more properly deserves the title of the citadel being surrounded by the other works it is square and very lofty and the walls of vast strength and thickness being constructed agreeably to the old modes of defence before the use of cannon it was strengthened by a draw bridge over a wide ditch and defended by modern works a halfmoon battery mounted with cannon and a very large platform also mounted with cannon under cover of the outward wall The top of the tower being embrazured and lined with turf and mounted with large cannon this part of the fortress could make a good defence and sustain a formidable attack By a well of vast depth constructed within the great tower and said to be of Roman work the supply of water for the garrison could not be cut off by an enemy This well is not unlike that in Bambrough Castle in Nor∣thumberland and has been constructed at the same time the great tower was built  In the gates of the castle is still remaining the old Portcullis and here are shewn the apartments of Mary Queen of Scots where she was lodged some time after her landing at Workington and after being for a little space entertained with flattering respect found herself prisoner to her jealous rival  In the outer castle is a fine grass plot a garden and governor's house  But it will be expected by our readers that we give a more particular descrip∣tion of this city and collect the historical facts relative to it  The name of Carlisle has been deduced by several authors from different ety∣mologies The British chronicle informs us this city was built by a British potentate called Luel Leland says  the Irishmen call  bale  a town and so peradventure did the old Scottes thus might be said that  lugabalia  soundeth  Luel'stown  Lel Itin v vii p In Leland's Collectaniae vol ii p Extract from the th chapter of the st book of Galfridus  Qui ut properitate regni usus est in Aquilonari parte Britanniae civitatem aedificavit quam de nomine ejus Caerleil vocant  Leil alias Luel filius Bruti cog viridis scuti condidit Caerliel  The Romans called it  Lugovallium  or  Luguballum  from its si∣tuation on Severus' wall and from the troops and people garrisoned there  Ptolemy  calls it  Leucopibi Nennius Caer Lualid  The Saxons retained the old name  Luel  the Welsh writers give it the name of the city of  Duballus  Some derive the name  from the ancient British  Llugydagwal  which implies  an army by the wall  from whence it is asserted the Romans framed their appellation of  Lugovallium  others from  Lagus  or  Lucus  which in the language of the  Celtae  and Britains signified a tower and which with the Roman compound expressed  a tower or fort upon the wall or vallum  to the Saxon name was added the word  caer  or city and from these  Caer Leuel  the present name of  Carlisle  seems to come by an easy corrup∣tion It is reasonable to apprehend that in so fine a situation on the confluence of three rivers and the grand estuarie of the Frith this place was of some strength and distinction before the coming of the Romans it will naturally follow that the name was given antecedent to the building of Severus' wall or the vallum of Hadrian and we conceive that Leland points out the most probable etymology  Camden  and his editors have taken great pains on this subject  The Romans and Britains called it  Luguvallum  and  Luguballium  or  Luguballia  the Saxons as  Bede  writeth  Luel Ptolemy  as some think  Lucopibia  which seems rather to be a corruption of  i e  white houses and to be  Candida Casa  or  Whithorn  in  Galloway    Nemicus Caer Lualid  the ridiculous Welsh prophecies  the city of Duballus  we  Carlisle  and the Latins from the more modern name  Carleolum  For that  Luguballia  and Carlisle are the same is universally agreed by our historians But as to the etymology what pains has our countryman  Leland  taken about it and at last he is driven upon this shift that  Ituna  might be called  Lugas  and that  Ballum  came from  Vallis  a valley and so make  Lugu∣vallum  as much as a  valley  upon the  Luge  But to give my conjectures also I dare affirm that the  vallum  and  valia  were derived from that famous military  vallum  of the  Romans  which runs hard by the city For  Antoninus  calls  Lugu∣vallum ad vallum  and the Picts wall which was afterwards built on the wall of  Severus  is to be seen at Stanwicks a small village a little beyond the Eden It passed the river over against the castle where in the very channel the remains of it namely great stones appear to this day Also  Pomponius Mela  has told us that  lugus  or  lucus  signified a  tower  among the old  Celtae  who spoke the same language with the Britains for what  Antoninus  calls  lugo augusti  is in him  turris augusti  so that  luguvallum  both really is and signifies  a tower or fort upon the wall or vallum  Upon this foundation if the French had made their  lugdunum  signify a tower upon a hill and their  lucotetia  so the ancients called what we call  lutetia  a beautiful tower for the words import so much in the British they might possibly have been more in the right than by deriving the latter from  lutum  dirt and the former from one  Lugdus  a fabulous king As to the present name  Carlisle  the original of this is plain enough from the British  caer  a city and  Lual Luel Lugubal Leil  or  Luil  according to the several appella∣tions antient or modern importing as much as  the town or city of Luul  c  Mr Gough's additions are "Dr Gale derives it from  lle  an army and  gual  the wall as  lugdu∣num  from  llu  and  dun  a hill for Tacitus says the Lyonnois called themselves a Roman colony and part of the army Lugo Augusti in mela is Turris Augusti The Saxon Chronicle says that Rufus after placing a garrison here returned into the south and sent hither Myccle  which Bishop Gibson in his edition of the Chronicle had translated a great multitude of English but in his Camden proposes reading    q d  husbandmen as better agreeing with the  tillage  there mentioned and all the records ascribe the first improvement of the country to this colony  In Dr Todd's MS we have several quotations relative to the etymology of the name from Itin Antiron Ptolemy's Geog Bede c which are comprised in what is set forth in the text  It has been the opinion of several judicious visitants that the river Eden has shifted its course and channel since the time of the Romans and that formerly it passed nearer to the castle for it should seem an inconsistent task for that wise people to make their work traverse a rapid and broad river otherwise than in a direct line Both Mr Horsley and Mr Warburton join in this opinion  It may safely be determined that the Romans found this a place of some im∣portance but that it was in their time rather a place of recess after the toils of warfare were over than a place of chief strength appears from the vicinity of Stanwix the station in course upon the wall It is not to be doubted but CaerLuel was fortified as it lay too near the borders not to be subject to perils and alarms but we have no Roman authorities to denominate it a regular Roman city or station as we find those nearest to the wall on the south were Olenacum now called Old Carlifle near Wigton and Bremetenracum called old Perith The words of Camden and his editors are  That this city flourished in the time of the Romans appears plainly enough from the several evidences of antiquity which they now and then dig up and from the frequent mention made of it by the writers of those times And even after the ravages of the Picts and Scots it retained something of its ancient splendor and was accounted a city  That it was a place of strength in the time of the Romans is evident not only from the men∣tion of it in the accounts they took of Britain when they had made it a province of the empire but also from Roman mounments and inscriptions that have been some time dug up here one whereof is mentioned by Malmsbury p to have been discovered in the time of William Rufus  Hector Bo  thi  s if any credit may be given to him relates that Voada Queen of the Britons with the assistance of one Colledus King of the Scotts and Caractacus King of the Picts once upon a time destroyed the Roman provinces and that the Silures joined with them that in the engagement b  nt Ca  lessium the strongest city of the Britons killing the citizens and razing the very foundations That Maximius a noble Roman married her daughter and called the neighbouring country West Maria from his own name so that if this story be true the foresaid monument may have been erected for him  Dr TODD'S MS  We have no authority to determine what was the size or form of this place in distant antiquity Leland says in his Itinerary vol VII p  The hole site of the towne is sore chaungidq For whereas the stretes were and great edifices now be vacant and garden plottes The cite of

places of Cumberland yn plewhyng hath be fownde brickes conteynyng the prints of antique workes  After the retreat of the Romans we may naturally conceive this city would soon be evacuated by the Britons and destroyed and laid waste by the northern nations who made constant irruptions and at length extended their rapine and devastation into the southern and interior parts of Britain till repressed by the coming in of the Saxon allies It would even be a considerable time after their introduction before they could extend their arms to these western parts During this period and in the darkness in which the history of those ages is involved we are left to conjecture that this now flourishing city lay in ashes and ruin till ******* Egfrid possessing the diadem of Northumbria carried his conquest to the western ocean The Britons in this mountainous country long retained their natural ferocity and supported their uncivilized liberty and independance Egfrid had Cumberland as a tributary province of his kingdom and from that period we gain some degree of certainty in the history of this place  Bede says that Northumberland and the Picts Scotts and Britons in the northern parts were in perfect peace one with another in the year of God and that there was such respect and re∣verence given to religion that persons of the best quality desired to be admitted to the offices of the church but not long after this the Britons or Cumbees who had been scattered in these parts ever since the recess of the Roman legions began to unite themselves under a government of their own cal∣ling their province or kingdom  Cumberland  or the land of the Cumbri  Dr TODD'S MS  The first certain account we have of Carlisle is in the seventh century of the Christian aera It appears that in Egfrid's reign it became a place of consider∣able strength and consequence he having caused it to be rebuilt and fortified with a wall  He is also said "to have repaired the church restored divine worship and placed in it a college of secular priests"GENT MAG p  Camden says  in Egfrid King of Northumberland gave it to the famous St Cuthbert in these words  I have likewise bestowed upon him the city called Luguballia with the lands fifteen miles about it  and quotes Symeon Dunelm This is a palpable error for Cuthbert's consecration was in The words of Symeon are  Et quia illa terra minus sufficiens erat Lugubaliam que Luel vocatur in circuita xv miliaria habentum in augmentum suscepit ubi etiam sanctimonialium congregatione stabilita Reginam dato habitu religionis consecravit et inprofectu divinae servitutis scolas instituit  Vide vol II of Northumberland p the grant at length dated Lel Col v I p  Bede says the citizens carried Cuthbert to see the walls of their city and a well of admirable workmanship built in it by the Romans  Several writers of St Cuthbert's life tell us of that holy man's founding here A D a convent of monks a school and an abbey of nuns but from Bede's Life of St Cuthbert cap it seems as if the monastery here to which Queen Emenburga retired was in be∣ing before St Cuthbert's coming to Carlisle  "In the northwest corner of the Forest of Englewood stands the ancient city of Carlisle It lay waste for the most part of years before the Conquest saving a few cottages among the ruins inha∣bited by Irish and Scots After the Danes had wasted the country with sire and sword William Rufus returning that way from Alnwick when he had made peace with the King of Scotland seeing the place to be of strength convenient to entertain his forces at any time against Scotland commanded the same to be rectified and to be fortified with walls and with a castle This was about the latter end of his reign but he was prevented by an untimely death before he could perform all that which he intended for the good of the city yet he placed there a colony of Dutchmen which were shortly thence trans∣lated into the Isle of Anglesey by him or his next successor Henry Beauclerk his brother and instead of them a new regiment of southern men of Essex Kent Middlesex and other parts of the realm were brought to supply their place and to inhabit the counties of Northumberland and Westmorland under the leading of Ranulph de Meschines sister's son to Hugh Lupus or Loup first Earl of Chester"  TANNER  After Egfrid's having restored the city and fortified it with a wall it became an appendage to the see of Lindisfarn by the royal gift thereof to St Cuthbert and so continued till the year when King Henry I constituted it a separate bishoprick By Dugdales Monasticon it appears that in in the acts of William Carilepho bishop of Durham it was stiled part of the diocese of the bishop of Durham It is asserted that in William the Conqueror issued his mandate to the inhabitants of Cumberland at large and of Carlisle in particular that they should continue subject to the bishop of Durham as their diocesian from whose predecessors they had received Christianity  So far we are allowed to speak of this city from the loose records of antiquity from the time of the Conquest we have more certainty and evidence of undenia∣ble authenticity to guide us Camden's description of the site of Carlisle is to this purport  Between the confluence of these rivers Peteril and Cauda the ancient city of Carlisle has a delightful pleasant situation bounded on the north with Eden on the east with Peteril and on the west with Caude and besides these natural fences it is fortified with a strong stone wall a castle and citadel It is of an oblong form from west to east to the west is a pretty large castle which was built by William the second and repaired by King Richard III as should seem by the arms  The period of time between the reign of Egfrid and the coming of the Danes affords a sufficient number of years to support a presumption that this place would greatly improve in importance and power before the pro∣gress of those ravagers but the advance only served to aggrandize its woe for when those invaders had possessed themselves of these northern parts we find Carlisle again smoking in her ashes  When they had laid waste Northumberland their violence was suffered to proceed as far as this city and lay it in utter ruin burning the town throwing down the walls and killing man woman and child the inhabitants being then very numerous In that state it was left for near years without an inhabitant but some few Irish who lodged themselves among the ruins The very foun∣dations of the city were so buried in the earth that it is said large oaks grew upon them and this is not only attested by our historians but also made out by some discoveries that have been lately made of large unhewn oak trees buried or feet below ground one of which was found by Mr Robert Jackson Alderman in digging for a well which round timber can be no other but some of the old monumental oaks that stood upon the walls as marks and witnesses of their utter ruin and destruction  Bede  Dr TODD's MS  and so complete was the destruction that she lay overwhelmed in her desolation till the time of William the Conqueror when one of his followers is said to have rebuilt some parts of the city founded or restored the ancient religious society there and dedicated the house to the honour of the Blessed Virgin of which he became the chief and in consequence of these pious works it was that the Conqueror issued the foregoing mandate in which Carlisle was particularly specified that this body of religious should be  subject to the episcopal jurisdiction of Durham as were the adjacent lands of Northumberland  King William Rufus  But all the ecclesiastical buildings with the city and adjacent country being laid waste in the Danish wars the city was rebuilt and fortified by King William Rufus and Walter a Norman priest being made by that king governor of the city began a monastery to the honours of the blessed Virgin Mary which was finished and endowed by King Henry I who placed therein regular canons of St Austin  GIBSON's CAM  Gul Rufus Rex Angliae restauravit CairleulLEL COL vol I p  Ex lib th Hen HuntingtonCairluel

importance of this place on the western part of the frontier as he saw Newcastle was on the eastern and seeing the infant works of Walter proceeding prosperously he un∣dertook to restore the city and caused many public buildings to be erected the whole of which he directed should be defended by a complete circumvallation and a strong fortress the care of executing his plan he consigned to Walter and under his inspection it is alledged the works were carried on From the appear∣ance of several parts of the fortifications one is led to determine they are the work of that aera for the Normans brought into this country some of the best workmen the island ever possessed as appears by the remains of many of the northern castles whose dates are well ascertained and there is so great a simili∣tude of the form and mode of architecture in the great tower of the castle of Car∣lisle that thence by a common observer its date may be ascertained In the sides of this tower in several parts are placed the arms of England but these seem to denote no more than the reparations made by the several sovereigns  Particularly King Richard III  It is said he first placed here a colony of Flemings and most probably they were the artificers who raised the fortifications for soon after we read of the city being restored and walled with the defence of a fortress added thereto we find the Flemings were removed to North Wales and the isle of Anglesea and the king replaced them with a colony of South Britains men used to husbandry and  the culture of lands who should till this part of the forest of Inglewood which hitherto had lain in its original state and teach the natives the mode of reaping from the natural fertility of their country the many comsorts of life and the progressive treasures to be won by industry of which they do not from any thing mentioned by historians appear to have conceived a previous idea To this colony all the records existing attribute the first tillage that was known in the fertile plains of Carlisle Bishop Gibson in his edition of Camden speaking of the evidence touching this matter in the Saxon Chronicle says  It has it  which at first sight should seem to be an error for  but in truth this seems rather to be an error of the librarian for  and on that supposition the words would imply that a great number of husbandmen were sent thither and not Englishmen for before that time the inhabitants of Carlisle were English and what follows in the Saxon Chronicle  strengthens the conjecture as expressing the errand upon which they were sent viz to cultivate those parts  This was deep policy in William as it was in∣troducing a certain employment which would naturally call together many settlers and render his kingdom less subject to annoyances from a northern enemy by the increase of population and consequent strength of the frontiers The cultivation introduced by William had not made so rapid a progress in the course of seventy years as to have cleared the neighbourhood of Carlisle of wood for by the char∣ter of King Henry II the citizens had the privilege of taking fuel and building timber from the Royal Forest of Carlisle  Camden says  Lugubalia now grown populous had as they write its Earl or rather Lord Ralph Meschines from whence descended the earls of Chester  After the death of Richard Earl of Chester who was drowned with the king's children Ranulph Meschines removed to Chester and was Earl thereof Pre∣sently after King Henry I died and King Stephen usurping the state gave this county to David King of Scots to procure his aid against King Henry II right heirs to the late king as son to Maud the Empress daughter and sole heir to Henry I But the Scots secretly favoured him for his right's sake and for that he had made the said Henry Fitz Empress knight at Carlisle Yet accepting the gift of the county whereunto he pretended his own right before granted to his ancestors by the Saxon kings he made his eldest son Henry Fitz David Earl of Huntington and Carlisle which Henry founded the abbey of Holm Cultram in the time of King Stephen his father confirming the grant of the revenues wherewith he endowed that house and so his son Malcom King of Scots after David After Henry Fitz David and King Stephen were dead King Henry Fitz Empress took Carlisle and the county from the Scots and granted to the city the first liberties I hear of that they enjoyed after the Conquest But his charter was burned by a casual fire that happened in the town which defaced a great part of the same and all the records of antiquity of that place  DENTON  The next person we read of in history who had the title of Earl of Carlisle was Andrew de Harcla whom King Edward II for his good services against Thomas Earl of Lancaster and his adherents and for subduing those who were  CARLISLE CASTLE  in rebellion and delivering them prisoners to the king created him Earl of Car∣lisle  The degradation and sentence of Andrew Harcla Earl of Carlisle for high treason taken from a MS intitled honor and arms p vid Stow's Chronicle  A D et reg Edw II ao About the feast of the purification of our Lady Andrew de Herkeley late made Earl of Carlisle under colour of peace found that he would marrie Robert Bruse his sister whereupon the king reputed him tratour and caused him to be taken by his trustye frinde Sir Antonie de Lucy who sent him in irons strait to London where he was judged before Sir Antonie de Lucy in this manner he was ledde to the barre as an Earle worthily appareled with his sworde girt about him hosed booted and spurred c unto whom Sir Antonie spoke in this manner "Sir Andrew "quoth he the king for thy valiante service hath donne thee greate honor and made thee Earl of Carlisle since which time thoue as a tratour to thy Lord the King leddest his people that should have holpe him at the battail of Beighland away by the country of Copland and through the earledome of Lancaster by which means our Lord the King was discomfited there of the Scots through thy treason and falsenesse whereas if thoue haddest come betimes he had had the victorie and this treason thou committest for the greate some of gold and silver that thoue receavest of James Dowglasse a Scot the king's enemie Our Lord the King will therefore that the order of knighthoode by the which thou receavest all thine honor and wooreship upon thy body be brought to nought and thy state undoone that other knights of lower degree may after thee beware and take example hereafter truly to serve" Then commanded he to hew his spurres from his heeles then to breake his sworde over his headde which the king had given him to keepe and defende his land therewith when he made him earle After this he let uncloath him of his furred tabard and of his whoode of his coat of arms and also of his girdle and when this was done Sir Antonie said unto him "Andrew quoth he now art thou no knight but a knave and for thy treason the king will that thou shall be hanged and drawen and thy headde smit∣ten offe from thy body thy bowels taken out of thy body and burned before thee and thy body quar∣tered and thy headde being smitten offe afterward to be set upon London bridge and thy four quarters shall be sent unto four good towns of England that all other may beware by thee" Which was ac∣cordingly done  From the time of his degradation  th King Edward III  the title of Earl of Carlisle was never revived till the Restoration of King Charles II when Charles Howard son of Sir William Howard in the th year of that reign was created Lord Dacre of Gils∣land visc Howard of Morpeth and Earl of Carlisle in reward for his having been highly instrumental in that happy restoration in which honours he hath been suc∣ceeded by his immediate

should so soon fall into such decay as to be in the state represented by that report in the reign of Queen Elizabeth It appears thereby that the works consisted of a donjon whose walls are twelve feet  in thickness an inward and outward ward the walls of the outward ward nine feet in thickness and eighteen feet in height and the walls of the inner ward twelve feet having a halfmoon bastion A tower called the Captain's Tower Two gates one to each ward In the castle a great chamber and a hall but no  storehouse for amunition In the walls of the town three gateway towers a se∣micircular bastion called Springold Tower and add to these the citadel But besides those mentioned in the report the walls were garnished with several square towers particularly a tower at the western sally port and a tower called the Tile Tower of particular strength  Before we quit the subject of the castle we must remark the beautiful and ex∣tensive prospect which you command from the great tower The foreground is formed of level meads washed by Eden in one part insulated by a separation of the river This plot is ornamented by two fine stone bridges one of four the other of nine arches the great passage towards Scotland The hanging banks are crowded with the village and church of Stanwix and the distant ground filled with the mountains of Bewcastle To the south you command the plains to∣wards Penrith

Scotch coast where Creffel and a chain of mountains extend towards the ocean  The parts of the CATHEDRAL now remaining shew that the old structure when it was intire was a noble and solemn edisice  The body of the cathedral chyrch ys of an older building than the quyer and yt ys as a filial derived from St Oswald's fast by Pontfret  Lel Itin vol VII page but since his days it has undergone great change as will be shewn in the sequel The present edifice consists of the east limb of the cross being the chancel and the cross aile or tran∣sept with the tower the greatest part of the west limb of the cross having been pulled down in the civil wars with the materials they erected a guard∣house at every gate of the city and one in the marketplace and two batteries in the castle The circular arches and massive round columns  whose shafts are only fourteen feet two inches high and circumference full seven and a half  Pennant  which remain of the west limb and transept are of the heaviest order of the Saxon architecture and at the first sight testify the different ages in which this part and the chancel were erected indeed the architecture denotes an earlier aera than the time of William Rufus and probably here is a part of the work of the age of St Cuthbert but there is no corroborating evidence to attend the mode of building which might prove so ancient a date The west end is said to have been in length feet from the cross aile of which feet remains it being dismembered of feet It is not in our power to determine how often this church was restored it is evident that the Danes laid this city in ashes and that King William Rufus under his trusty nominee Walter  The Magna Bait has it that D King of Scotland built a great part of this cathedral  restored the city and the public buildings but so early as the reign of King Henry H the city was laid waste by the Scots and the public records were burnt which most probably a∣greeable to the custom of those days were deposited in the archieves of the eccle∣siastics conceiving this to be the fact then we must admit of some considerable change in this sacred edifice for in we are told an accidental fire consum∣ed the church with half of the city to the number of houses as far as the north gate In the reign of King Edward III it was rebuilt by contributions The editor of Camden's words are  Almost in the middle of the city stands the cathedral church  the upper part  whereof being newer is a curious piece of workmanship  built by King Henry VIII  but the lower is much more ancient The lower west part is the parochial church and as old as St Cuthbert or as Walter who came in with the Conqueror was a commander in his army rebuilt the city founded a priory and turning religious became himself the first prior of it The chancel was built by contributions about the year and the belfrey was raised and the bells placed in it at the charge of William de Strick∣land bishop in the year  The expression used by this learned editor is so indefinite that we own we are not able to determine whether he meant to imply that King Henry VIII built the present chancel By a writer in the  Gentleman's Magazine p it is said  on the th Richard II near houses were destroyed with the cathedral and suburbs  by an accidental fire and he adds this account is taken from the Magna Britannia Antiqua et Nova If this

ten years be∣fore Bishop Strickland raised the belfrey which would have been an useless work when the church was in ruins These contradictions and ambiguities we are at present obliged to leave unsolved  The choir is feet in length and with the side ailes feet broad the cross aile or transept is feet broad so that the length of the church when entire was exactly feet within The choir is of fine Gothic architecture with light columns remarkably beautiful The stalls are garnished with taber∣nacle work the organ is placed at the cross screen which contains but a narrow and low entrance and is a great injury to this fine edifice By late repairs it is greatly embellished being wainscotted with oak from the stalls round the whole east end of the choir in a simple stile after the old order The open gates leading into the side ailes are old and much broken but shew excellent light Tracery work finely ornamented The bishop's throne is not magnificent but yet elegant and stately The breadth of the choir and ailes being feet corresponds well with the height which to the center of the ceiling is feet The roof was originally lined or vaulted with wood painted and orna∣mented with arms and devices of the several patrons and contributors to the work with the arms of France and England were those of the Piercys Lucys Warrens and Mowbrays The old wood lining remains in the cross aile and shews what was the former figure and the ornaments of the choir but the outward roof and wood ceiling of the choir having gone greatly to decay when repairs were made in the ceiling was stuccoed in the form of a groined vault which is a great advantage to its appearance  The whole expence amounted to l towards which Dean Bolton contributed l Bishop Lyttleton l and the Countess Dowager Gower l the rest was made up by the Dean and Chapter  The east window is large being feet in height and in breadth ornamented with fine pilasters but it has no cast of solemnity by means of a border of coloured glass thrown round it of yellow red and green which looks gaudy  The official duties of marriages christenings churchings and funerals are performed in the parish church the ordinary duties of the Sabbath and prayers twice aday through the year in the choir On the burial of any of the members of the choir the corps is carried into that part of the church The cathedral and parish church are both under one roof It has a stately steeple with a ring of eight bells which are rung on all public occasions The consistory or spiritual court is kept in part of the church In the abbey contiguous to the church and in which properly the church stands are several venerable buildings such as the deanry sratery head school cloisters porter's lodge cL  In the ailes on each side are some strange legendary paintings of the history of St Anthony St Cuthbert and St Augustine one represents the saint vi∣sited by an unclean spirit who tempts him in a most indecent manner  Pennant  Above every picture is a distich relative to the subject  To give the reader an idea of these strange compositions we have transcribed the legends of St Anthony St Cuthbert and St Austine  LEGEND OF

of lead thirteen or fourteen feet high which being gone greatly to decay was totally removed soon after the Restoration  The pillars of the choir are clustered and in excellent proportion the arches are pointed in the inner mouldings of the capitals are figures and flowers in pierced work of light carving and the inside of the arches are prettily ornamented Two galleries run above the side ailes but with windows only in the upper that in the east end has a magnificent simplicity  When the choir was rebuilt in the reign of King Edward III indulgences were issued the common and most effectual claim of assistance which were of forty days penance to such laity as should by money materials or labour contri∣bute to this pious work and the bishop's register abounds with letters patent and orders for the purpose  At the west end of the church is a large plain altar tomb called the Blue stone  This blue stone at the north end of the transept is the tomb of Prior Simon Senhouse  on this the tenants of the dean and chapter by certain tenures were obliged to pay their rents  PENNANT  Several parts of the abbey were enlarged or improved by Prior Gondibour who occurs in the initial letters of his name appearing in several parts In the vestry is preserved an old oak aumery or chest with an inscription in the old English letter  See the Plate p    Prior Senhouse who occurs in repaired the square tower within this priory and on the beams of the middle room are inscribed many sentences with a moral maxim often used by him  Loth to offend  He was an extraordinary character for meekness in dispositionIn old deeds and other writings he stiled himself "Simon by the  patience of God  prior" cHe caused to be painted the lives of St Anthony and others in the isles of the Cathedral and likewise the ceiling of the square tower in the priory from which are copied the following rude verses  Simon Senus prior whose fowll God have mercy  Soli Dei honor et Gloria Deo Gracian

the choir near the bishop's throne and also the throne was the work of Prior Haythwaite about the year his name having been on the backside of it and the opposite door with its ornaments is supposed to have been erected by Prior Senhouse about the year by the sentence inscribed thereon  "Vulnera quinque dei sint medicina mei"  which was that prior's common adage The tabernacle work in the quire was done at the expence of Bishop Strickland who came to the see A D  There were two chapels and two chantries founded within this church the chapel of St Catharine was founded by John de Capella a citizen of Carlisle which he endowed with certain burgage houses some lands and rents In there being an unjust detention of the rights of this chapel Bishop Appleby gave notice for restitution in ten days under pain of excommunication by bell book and candle This chapel was on the south side of the church  The chapel of St Alban in was on inquiry found not to have been con∣secrated and thenceforth divine offices and sepulture were prohibited to be longer performed therein this appears by an entry in Bishop Welton's register On the dissolution King Edward VI granted the lands and tenements appertaining to this chantry unto Thomas Dalston and William Denton  Bishop Whelpdale founded a chantry and endowed it with l for holy offices for the souls of Sir Thomas Skelton Knt and Mr John Glaston  There was a chantry of the holy cross but who was the founder and when it was endowed is not known King Edward VI granted the lands and tenements thereto belonging in Carlisle and Kirklinton to Hen Tanner and Tho Bucher  For the other religious foundations the reader is referred to the Eccl Survey th K Hen VIII  In the middle of the choir is a monument of Bishop Bell with his effigies in

D Bishop John Best was also buried here he departed this life A D Bishop Henry Robinson was also buried in this church There is this remarkable entry in the parish register of Dalston that he died at

altar to make the late repairs at the north corner was discover∣ed a brass plate finely engraven which had been put up to his memory The bishop is there represented in his pontisicals kneeling before one church in ruins and another lately or newly erected upon the former is inscribed  Invenit de∣structum reliquit extructum et instructum  on the latter  Intravit per ostium per mansit fidelis

inscription the first  Hic jacet Eva quonda uxor Willi fil Rogeri  this is subscribed with the signature of Z c  The second is marked with the known signature of that learned antiquary Mr Pegg  Hic jacet Ema quonda uxor Williclmi filii Rogerii  There is no attempt to explain what person was here interred it is possible the tomb was made antecedent to the building of the throne  The whole of this noble edifice is of red freestone ornamented with pilasters and pointed arches There have been some statues on the eastern turrets but they are mutilated and gone greatly to decay  No circumstances are come to our knowledge touching the religious founda∣tions here before or in the time of St Cuthbert other than the mention made of them by ancient writers probably they did exist as several persons speaking of St Cuthbert's life tell us he founded A D a convent of monks a school and an abbey of nuns but from Bede's Life of that saint chap xvii it appears the nunnery here to which Queen Emenburga retired was existing before St Cuthbert's visiting Carlisle Mr Denton's account of these religious foundations is to the following effect  When the city was replenished with people for to maintain better policy in the same and to inform the people instead of a nunnery which had been there before and which William Rufus had translated thence and established at Ain∣staplighe or rather in recompence for the lands to that nunnery belonging had  In the st year of his Age and the th of his Consecration  A Prelate  who by gradual and well merited Advancements  having passed through every

Imitation  founded another at Ainstaplighe endowing the same with other revenues there King Henry I founded a college of secular priests in the second year of his reign and made Athwald his confessor or chaplain prior of St Botophs first prior of Carlisle dedicating the church to the honour of the Blessed Virgin Mary and endowed them with the tithes of the churches then founded in the Forest of Englewood but being hindred by the tumults and troubles of his time he could not perfect all things before the d year of his reign and then strucken with grief for the loss of his children that were drowned coming from Normandy by the counsel of the Prior Athelwold and to appease God for his sins as he thought he erected a bishop's see at Carlisle and made the said Athelwald first bishop thereof whom the Archbishop of York named Thurstan did consecrate in the year and in his stead another chaplain of the said King Henry named Walter was made the second prior of that house who a little before his election had taken upon him by the king's license a religious habit viz of a regular canon there which order of canons the king and bishop Athelwold had placed in that house banishing the secular priests immediately upon his consecration The said Walter gave to the church of Carlisle for ever in pure alms his lands in Lynstock Richardby Crosby Little Crosby Walby Brunskeugh Carleton Little Carleton and the wood and the churches or rectories of St Cuthbert in Carlisle and Staynwings which the king had given him and the same gift was confirmed unto them both by the king and bishop Athelwold  The rectory of St Cuthbert's in Carlisle was founded by the former inhabi∣tants of Carlisle before the Danes overthrew the city and by them dedicated to the honour of St Cuthbert of Duresm who of antient times was lord of the same for fifteen miles about Carlisle At the first foundation of the church every citi∣zen offered a piece of money which was a coin of brass then current which they buried under the foundation of the church steeple there as was found to be true at the late reedifying of St Cuthbert's steeple A D **** for when they took up the foundation of the old steeple they found well near a bushel of that money  After the said priors Athelwold and Walter succeeded John who gave Water∣croft in Flimby to the Lord of Workington son of Gospatrick and after John Bartholomew who in the time of Bishop Hugh confirmed Orton in Westmor∣land to the prior of Coneyshead After him Radulph was prior who confirmed the impropriation of the rectory of Burgh to the abbey

Gospa∣trick Earl of Dunbar brought from Jerusalem and Constantinople a bone of St Paul and another of St John Baptist two stones of Christ's sepulchre and part of the holy cross which he gave to the priory together with a mansion near St Cuthbert's church where at that time stood an antient building called Arthur's chamber taken to be part of the mansion house of King Arthur the son of Uter Pendragon of memorable note for his worthiness in the time of antient Kings Waldeive also gave other antient buildings called Lyons Yards often remembered in the history of Arthur written by a monk the ruins whereof are still to be seen as it is thought at Ravenglass distant from Carlisle accord∣ing to that author fifty miles placed near the sea and not without reason thought therefore to be the same  DENTON's MS  Mr Denton's account of the money found in rebuilding the sleeple of St Cuthbert's church is rendered uncertain by some late discoveries and it is most  probable it was a concealed treasure intended to be secured against the Danes or some other ravagers for when the foundations were making for the present new edifice and the workmen had gone below the foundations of the old church they discovered the remains of a still more ancient erection and took up several pieces of broken sculpture among the rest the figure of a nun with her veil or hood well cut and in good preservation which we saw in the garden of George Mounsey Esq of Carlisle so that it should seem the old nunnery stood there  This sculpture is now lostIn Mr Mounsey's and other gardens adjoining many foundations of houses fragments of pottery quantities of oakwood human bones c have been dug up at various times This ground is upon the east side of English street and called the GreyFriars and up the west side adjoining the walls from St Cuthbert's church to the jail is called the BlackFriars and similar things have been dug up here also a few years ago in making a drain from a house here towards the walls the top of an arch was discerned some of the stones being removed we discovered a spacious arched room one side of which rested upon the walls in height feet in breadth feet and in length about feet the end was narrower and lower and supposed to have been connected with other similar rooms but the partitions built up There were four funnels went upright to the footpath of the walls but covered at the top with slags and iron grates in the funnels On the opposite side between two of the arches a horizontal funnel about two feet wide and three feet high went towards the city this was searched a considerable way till the person was entangled with rubbish which choaked it up beneath this passage the floor was flagged and walled in about inches high on each side and a conduit went through the city walls on the opposite side of the vault this was opened by removing the earth on the out side about four feet deep and let out a great quantity of water which was lodged in the vault Proceeding to remove the wet rubbish which was collected the workmen were interrupted by the gunner of the castle who assumed a higher power than Mr Mead the store keeper at whose instance the search was making and the place was immediately shut up and never since opened We have accurate drawings and measurements which we have deferred laying before the public till a full investigation of this myste∣rious place be made we are confident there are many other such kind of vaults in the neighbourhood  THE EDITORS  It seems that Walter's foundation was entirely a new one

Norman laid the foundation of the priory which he dedicated to the Blessed Virgin it is said he became the head of the society which he had in∣stituted but authors of great authenticity speak of his work as being incomplete at the time of his death and that King Henry I in the second year of his reign took it under his patronage finished it and endowed it A D and therein placed regular canons of the order of St Augustine appointing Athelwald his confessor and chaplain the first prior Notwithstanding Denton's account we are convinced there was a succession of thirty priors after Athelwald before the time of the dissolution Athelwald afterwards being made bishop of this diocese was succeeded in the priory by Walter another chaplain of the kings' who had taken upon him the regular habit and being a rigorous disciplinarian he banished all  the secular priests from that religious house  PRIORS  Athelwald made first bishop of the see  Walterhe gave to this house his lands in Lynstock

to swear canonical obedience to the bishop on account of the priory being of royal foundation and being excommunicated by the bishop for the contempt he appealed to the temporal court The royal

Carlisle became  a member of the see of Lindisfarne and followed the translation of that bishoprick to Chester and finally to Durham The cause alledged for dismembering Carlisle and constituting there a separate see was on account of the distance from Durham  then the seat of the episcopacy and the consequential delays of episcopal duties there According to Camden the monks of Durham looked upon this act of the  sovereign as a grievous infringement of their ancient rights and privileges but from the abject disposition of mind peculiar to that age they avoided pointing  the accusation where it was due and alledged that  when Ralph bishop of Dur∣ham was banished and the church had none to protect it certain bishops joined  Carlisle and Tiviotdale to their diocese  It is observable this is the only Episcopal chapter in England of the order of St Austin  TANNER  King Henry constituted Ethelwald or as he is some times called Adeluph then prior there the first bishop of this new see and the church of St Mary then became a cathedral church  EPISCOPUS I  IN the distant age in which the first Bishop of Carlisle arose little can be gathered of the virtues of memorable actions of men though even thus eminent this obscurity is greatest in a country which was almost a constant scene of military exploits depredations and bloodshed Carlisle though a chief barrier against the Scots suffered many changes of fortune and the life of its bishop was frequently disturbed and full of trouble From such causes there is but little historic matter handed down to us personally rela∣tive  to this prelate and several of his immediate successors We find him indeed busy in one ecclesiasti∣cal matter in which he was immediately adversary to the will of his sovereign He was one of the electors of Henry Murdac abbot of Fountanis to be archbishop of York The king's displeasure was such at this transaction that he denounced vengeance against all those who were concerned in it but such was this prelate's contempt of the sovereign's menaces and selfconfidence that he received Murdac as his metropolitan when he came to visit David King of Scotland then resident in this city  Pryn vol I p  He departed this life A D  Though some learned persons have affirmed that before the settlement of Mortmain th King Edward I impro∣priations were very rare in England yet this bishop who died above an hundred years before the enacting that law confirmed the churches of Wetheral and Warwick St Michael and St Lawrence Appleby Kirby Stephen Ormes∣head Morland Clibburn Bromfield Croglin and the hermitage of St Andrew in the parish of Kirkland to the abbot and convent of St Mary's York with this single proviso that the said abbot and convent should allow such a portion to the officiating minister as thereby he may be decently maintained and be able to pay his synodals  and was succeeded by  EPISCOPUS II  BERNARD of whom we know little but his episcopal actsIn he dedicated the church of St Mary Magdalene of Lanercost He remained bishop of Carlisle to the time of his death which hap∣pened A D From the long continued vacancy of the see it appears evidently that it was in a sad unsettled state and full of discord and troubles as well as meanly revenued for by the register of Wetheral it is shewn that King Henry II being present at Carlisle tendered the bishoprick to Paulinus de Leedes and as such was even an early influence in the ecclesiastical affairs offered to augment the income with marks out of the churches of Bambrough and Scarbrough with the chapel of Tick∣hill and two manors adjacent to Carlisle but even with such augmentations Paulinus refused it  In the temporalties continuing in the king's hand the following particulars amongst others were brought into account at the treasury for oil for the sacrament at Easter two terms and carrying the same from London to Car∣lisle l In work of the greater altarand avement in the church of St Mary Carlisle s d In work of dormi∣tory of the canons l s d  It continued vacant to the beginning of the th century and King John gave the revenues of the bishop∣rick to support the archbishop of Sclavonia In the Pope intermeddled with the income of the see granting it to the archbishop of Regula who was obliged to abandon his own and was destitute of support This act of the papal authority was confirmed by the king The continued vacancy let in a flood of enormities among the religious here The canons publickly announced their contempt of the papal authority and the censures of his legate in defiance of all the interdicts and sentences denounced to the contrary they persisted in celebrating divine services and all holy offices of the sacraments but their arrogance and impropieties did not cease there they swore fealty to the king of Scots an avowed enemy to the crown of England and one in open opposition to the authority of the holy see In conse∣quence of these licentious acts they set up an interdicted and excommunicated clerk for their bishop con∣trary to the will of their lawful sovereign and the pope's legate and seizing the revenues of the bishoprick applied them according to their own will Enormities like these were to be corrected with the severest measures The council of King Henry III applied to Pope Honorius III totally to remove these offensive canons and place prebends in their room to augment the revenues of the see which were so small that no able and loyal person would accept of the bishoprick and to displace the person who had  been thus obtruded to the episcopacy

vol I p  In consequence of which application the Legate Gallo at the pope's command and with the sovereign's assent constituted Hugh bishop of this diocese he being at that time abbot of Belieu and the canons were banished  EPISCOPUS III  HUGH abbot of Belieu the elect of Gallo the legate came to this see when distracted with the offen∣ces of the clergy yet we do not find that religion was the least abbetted by this prelate the manners of the religious were not improved or the errors of those under him reformed nay he seemed even doubt∣ful of his own authority when in the grant made by him to the convent of St Mary's in York A D he styles himself "Hugo dei gratia Karleolensis ecclesiae vocatus sacerdos" so the register of Wetheral shews He had the favour of his sovereign and was one of his sureties in the treaty entered into with Alexander King of Scotland  Rymer vol I p  The pope was petitioned to assist in the restoration of the churches of Penrith Newcastle Rothbury Corbridge and Whittingham to the see and in the king's letters on this occasion he stiles him "Fidelis noster cui multo tenemur debito""ac sanctae Romanae ecclesiae devotissimus"  Pryn vol II p  There cannot be a more certain channel for obtaining the true history of any man's life than the writings of cotemporaries and neighbours by such this prelate so much devoted to the church as he is stiled by the king is accused of alienating the possessions of the see nay of making fraudulent distributions thereof and the chronicle of Lanercost passes this dreadful sentence on his un∣timely death  That  by the just judgment of God he perished miserably  at the abbey of le Forte in Bur∣gundy as he was returning from Rome  Even if this is the language of truth it is not that of charity and shocks the reader when he perceives it comes from the records of the  scriptores  of a re∣ligious housethere is a rancour in it that gives a jealousy some latent cause had dictated the severe asseveration and we find by the register of Holm Cultram that about the year this bishop of Carlisle caused the convent of Lanercost to relinquish a reserved rent issuing out of the church of Burgh upon Sands as not having been obtained by canonical rules If such a cause dictated the rancorous con∣demnation and judgment what detestation ought we not to hold these impious men in  We do not find that the episcopacy of this place was to be better filled by the successor of Hugh whose want of learning gave him even a name of disgraceful distinction that of  Malclerk  EPISCOPUS IV  WALTER was consecrated A D He appears in history before his episcopacy in an unpro∣mising character the friend and intimate counsellor of the base King John his ambassador to Rome against the dissident barons and the instigator of those projects which rendered that sovereign's memory detestable for ever  Pryn vol iii p  yet we find him promoted by King Henry III to this see enriched by the grant  of the manor of Dalston to this in by the king's charter was added the office of treasurer of the exchequer of England with power of executing that duty by deputy of his own nomination But Walter held this distinguished office but a very short time though his charter contained an appointment for life he was discharged in a disgraceful manner without any cause assigned his grants the instru∣ments of his office were ordered to be cancelled and he was fined l the king appointing Peter de Rival his successor and commanded S de Segrave his justiciar to put him in possession of the treasury in case Walter refused to deliver the keys and all things belonging thereto by inventory and view and testimony of true men The affections and frowns of princes are so fluctuating and uncertain and their causes so frequently arise from the secret influence of villains who sport with their sovereign's weaknesses that we should not from thence deduce the character of any man this reverse of fortune some attribute to the intrigues of Peter Bishop of Winchester who had great influence with the king Walter would have repaired to Rome for redress but having got on board a vessel at Dover he was arrested by the officers of the crown and brought on shore The Bishop of London was a spectator of this outrage and immediately pronounced a sentence of excommunication against those concerned in this arrest and so earnestly did he engage in this business that he hasted to Hereford where the king held his court and with the assistance of several bishops there present renewed his sentence  Matt Paris  But it was not long before Walter was restored to royal favour being a suitable instrument for the times in the power of his prince  A D  He was a chief instrument in the contract entered into between the king and the Earl of Winchester's daughter We find his name among the witnesses to the king's ratification of the great charter and such confidence was at length placed in him that he was appointed spiritual tutor to Prince Edward A D He was joined in commission with the Archbishop of York and William de Cantelupe as lords justices of the realm in the king's absence This is the last public character we find him in and in he resigned his bishoprick and became one of the order of preaching friars at Oxford where he died A D  He had the wardship of Walter son of Odard de Wigton a child of two months and with him the manors of Wigton Melmerby Stainton on Eden Blackhall and Warwick  In he had the following licence to make a will"Rex omnibu  c salutem sciatis quod testamentum quod W Karliolensis episcopus

c"PRYN vol ii p  EPISCOPUS V  SYLVESTER DE EVERDON was his successor being advanced from the archdeaconry of Chester th November  He protected the rights of his bishoprick with ardour and in his political character was highly re∣spectable he opposed the innovations and incroachments the crown attempted against the privileges of the church particularly in that of the election of bishops  Pryn vol ii p has this remarkable speech of the king to this prelate "Et te Sylvester Carleolensis qui dni lambens cancellariam clericorum meorum clericulus extitisti qualiter postpositis multis Theologis et personis reverendis te in episcopatum sublegavi"  and was one of the prelates who in the presence of the king pronounced the anathema with bell book and candle against those who infringed the liberties of England  Cum Burt p  He died in by a fall from his horse  His soul had on one side a bishop cloathed in his pontificals and on the reverse the figure of the Blessed Virgin with our Saviour in her arms with this motto "Te rogo virgo dei sis vigil erga mei"  and was succeeded by  EPISCOPUS VI  THOMAS DE VETRIPONTE of the house of the earls of Westmorland on the th Nov but of him we have no account further than that he departed this life in the month of October next after his consecration and was immediately succeeded by  EPISCOPUS VII  ROBERT DE CHAUNCY on the th of February he being advanced to this see from the arch∣deaconry of Bath He fell into an unhappy opposition to the sherift of Cumberland which occasioned  his representing to the lord chancellor on the accession of King Edward I that the bishop had forbidden his tenants to make their fealty to the king The bishop soon vilified the false representation and shewed that he had requested the sheriff by message to receive their fealty and made an avowal for himself and his tenants that they were ready to give every assurance of their duty and fidelity to his majesty The bishop's character seems to be discovered by his taking occasion on the application of the abbot of Holm Cultram who had suffered a distress by the sheriff for the dues of the crown more through resent∣ment than the necessity of the case to pronounce a sentence of excommunication against him which was revoked by the operation of a writ of prohibition On his death  EPISCOPUS VIII  RALPH IRTON succeeded to the see A D He was elected by the prior and convent but it being alledged they had proceeded therein contrary to the ordinary rules of their privilege they were attached to answer the king therein under the papal authority the dispute was terminated by conferring the bishoprick on the person elected by Bull dated th April A D the holy see claming to have a provisionary power therein and with which King Edward I acquiesced  Rymer and Pryn  Ralph was of a Cumberland family and was advanced to this see from the abbacy of Guisburne in Cleveland He was a steady maintainer of the rights of his church and supported a suit against Sir Michael de Harcla by which A D he recovered the manor and church of Dalston He was also party in a suit for tythes of new cultured lands within the forest of Inglewood claimed to be granted to the church of Carlisle by King Henry I who enfeoffed the same "per quoddam Cornu Eburneum"  This horn is fully treated of among the antiquities of Carlisle in the Archaeologia  "Radulphus episcopus Karleolensis petit versus priorem ecclesiae Karleolensis decimas duarum placiarum terrae de novo assartarum in foresta de Inglewood quarum una vocatur Lynthwaite et alia Kyrthwaite quae sunt infra limites parochiae suae du Aspatric Et super hoc similiter venit mag Henricus de Burton parsana de Thursby et easdem decimas clamat ut pertinentes ad ecclesiam suam Et prior venit et dicit quod

dominus rex super praemissis vult certiorari ut uni cui quique tribuatur quod suum assignetur c Et certificent regem ad proximum parliamentum"Cokes Infl  "The Cornu Eburneum they have yet in the cathedral of Carlisle a symbol very probably of some of King Henry I's grants to the priory but in none of those grants of which any copy is now extant do those tythes appear The cere∣mony of investiture with a horn or other like symbol is very ancient and was in use before there were any written charters We read of Ulf a Danish prince who gave all his lands to the church of York and the form of the endow∣ment was this he brought the horn out of which he usually drank and before the high altar kneeling devoutly drank the wine and by that ceremony enfeossed the church with all his lands and revenues  King Canute another Dane gave lands at Pusey in Berkshire to the family of that name there with a horn solemnly delivered as a confirmation of the grant which horn it is said is still there to be seen  So King Edward the confessor granted to Nigel the huntsman an hide of land called Derehide and a wood called Halewood with the custody of the forest of Bernewood to hold of the king to him and his heirs by one horn which is the charter of the said forest  So that not the Danes only but the English Saxons also were acquainted with this ancient custom Thus Ingulphus abbot of Crowland who lived in the time of William the Conqueror acquaints us that it continued down to his time He tells us that many estates were granted by word only without writing as by delivery of a sword an helmet a horn or cup or such like but this mode he says in after times was changed  Ulf's horn at York when the reformation began in King Edward the VI's time was swept away amongst other costly ornaments and sold to a goldsmith who took away from it the tippings of gold wherewith it was adorned and the gold chain which was affixed to it fAfter which time the horn itself out in ivory of an Octagon form came into the hands of General Fairfax who being a lover of antiquities preserved it during the confusions of the civil wars whose memory is deservedly honoured for other generous actions of this nature such as allowing Mr Dodsworth the antiquarian a yearly salary to preserve the inscriptions in churches the giving his valuable manuscripts to the university of Oxford and his preserving the public library there as he did the cathedral at York from being spoiled and defaced after the surrender of the city And he dying in this horn came into the possession of his next kinsman Lord Fairfax who ornamented it anew and restored it to its ancient repository where it now remains a noble monument of modern as well as ancient pietyARCUAEOLOGIA  but the grants given in evidence not extending to such tythes either expressly or by im∣plication the right was adjudged to the king and he afterwards granted the same to the prior and convent as beforementioned  This bishop was in great confidence with his sovereign and received several marks of his royal favour He was joined in commission with the bishop of Caithness to collect tenths within the kingdom of Scot∣land He was one of the king's most confidential commissioners for adjusting the claims to the crown of Scotland on the th of June and th of August He appears a witness to the king's claim of right to the kingdom of Scotland on the death of Queen Margaret which was subscribed at Nor∣ham on the th of May  Rymer  He was one of the plenipotentiaries impowered to contract Prince Edward with the beforementioned princess and was an active agent in many other of the most impor∣tant state transactions of his time Notwithstanding his coming to the see in the singular manner he did we do not discover that he ever betrayed any undue influence of the holy see or any sinister attempts to aggrandize the papal authority in this country by acts which could infringe the rights of his sovereign or the people through any undue extention of the authority of Rome here In March be suf∣fered great fatigue in his journey from London in deep snow where he had been to attend parliament he reached Linstock where reposing himself after a little refreshment a blood vessel broke and suffo∣cated him in his sleep He was succeeded by  EPISCOPUS IX  JOHN HALTON who was a busy man in spiritual as well as secular concerns He was one of the canons of Carlisle and probably of the same political principles with his predecessor as we see him suc∣ceeding that prelate in the commission for determining the claims to the crown of Scotland and he was present in November when sentence was given for John Baliol and he did homage for his kingdom  Pryn  In he was emissary of King Edward to the court of Scotland and had letters of safe conduct for his journey By the pope's authority he was the collector of tenths in the Scotch diocese He entertained the king and his train at his castle of Rose for a considerable time He was governor of the castle of Carlisle A D and had the custody of the Scotch hostages and prisoners He was joined in commission with the archbishop of York from the holy see A D to pronounce sentence of excommunication by bell book and candle against Robert Brus Earl of Carrick for the murder of John Cumyn in the church of Dumfries In the year following he was one in the commission to ab∣solve all persons for their offences against King Edward's enemies in Scotland wounding the clergy and spoiling their churches  Pryn  He was petitioner to the pope for the canonization of Sir Thomas de Cante∣lupe late bishop of Hereford In he was summoned to attend the coronation of King Edward II He was shut up in Carlisle by the blockade formed by Edward Bruce's forces in and obliged to appear by proxy in the parliament at Westminster  In in recompence of the many and great services and sufferings of the now aged bishop of Carlisle King Edward II addressed the pope for the appropriation of the church of Horncastle in the diocese of Lincoln being in the patronage of the said bishop to his own use and to annex the same for ever to the bishoprick of Carlisle that he and his successors during the ravages of the neighbouring enemy may have a place of refuge and out of the profits of the church may be able to support themselves Some years before this the king had granted his own royal licence insig∣nificant as it seems without a confirmation from Rome for the said appropriation and in the same year the bishop himself desires one of the cardinals to make the same intercession to the pope as also for a remission of the pension paid to the papal see out of the rectoryREO HALTON  He was one of the plenipotentiaries of the king in the treaty of peace with Robert Brus in which is the last public capacity out of his episcopal office in which we find him on record He departed this life A D and was succeeded by  EPISCOPUS X  JOHN ROSS who was imposed upon this see by the arbitrary disposition of the pope contrary to the election of the chapter who had nominated William de Ermya canon of York and which elec∣tion had received royal confirmation  He was of a refractory and contentious disposition and though not employed in a political capacity had business enough upon his hands in his disputes and litigatious with his clergy He disturbed the prior and convent in the enjoyment of their revenue seized their tents and other effects and interfered with their appropriate churches insomuch that they were obliged to appeal to the see of Rome from whence a delegation was sent to the prior of Durham to hear and determine the complaint As he was avaricious and refractory so was he malevolent and revengeful for taking advantage of some slight omis∣sion  in the prior of Carlisle not paying up certain tenths or other dues he pronounced sentence of ex∣communication the dreadful scourge which was put into the hands of such men by the powers of the churchHe died at Rose Castle A D The see was immediately supplied by  EPISCOPUS XI  JOHN KIRBY prior of Carlisle being elected and confirmed th of May He came to this episcopacy in a most unhappy aera both in regard to the public troubles and agitations in the state and the litigious and unhappy disposition of the clergy He was continually subject to alarms from the Scots in consequence of the king of England's unfortunate expeditions and unsuccessful arms and added to this he had gained the contempt and hatred of that people before the advancement to the see so that it is said his ordinations were held in very distant quarters of the kingdom and he was frequently out of this diocese and to render his life still more distressful he was involved in innumerable suits with his clergy  Soon after followed a demand for a provision for one of the king's clerks "Edwardus Dei gratia c venerabili in Christo patro Johanni eadem gratia Episcopi Karliole  si salutem Cum vos

not appear what return was made to this writ nor any other of the like nature either before or after in this diocese Yet such claim seems to be well founded For notwithstanding the St st K Ed c whereby "the king granteth that from henceforth he will no more such things desire but where he ought"yet by the common law the king as founder of archbishopricks bishopricks and many other religious houses had a corodyor pension in the seve∣ral foundations a corody for his valets who attended him and a pension for a chaplain such as he should specially recom∣mend till the respective possessor should promote him to a competent benefice  In he was beset by ruffians as he passed through Penrith who would have assassinated him and in the fray several of his retinue were wounded  K Reg  In the month of October his palace of Rose Castle was burnt by the Scots and the adjacent country swept of its cattle and flocks the crops destroyed and the whole adjoining lands laid waste  Chron Laner  He had great trouble in the collection of tenths he suffered a severe sentence from the court at York upon his refusing an established vicar to St Mary's in Carlisle He was a defaulter in the payment of a large sum to the pope for tenths in Lincolnshire for which he suffered suspension and excommunication but in we find him again acting in the public capacity of commissioner with Richard bishop of Durham and others to treat with the Scots touching the set∣tlement of peace and commerce In he was appointed to attend the princess Joan to Alphonsus king of Castisle her contracted confort for which he was allowed five merks aday as board wages out of the king's exchequerHe departed this life A D He was succeeded by  EPISCOPUS XII  GILBERT WELTON a person consecrated by the arbitrary authority of the see of Rome contrary to an election made by the chapter under the royal licence and confirmation of the prior of Carlisle John de Horncastle but the king was pleased to revoke those powers in compliance with the dictates of the holy see and to confirm the consecration of Gilbert  He was one of the commissioners appointed by the king to treat for the ransom of David king of Scotland and for the establishment of peace between the two nations In he was joined with Thomas de Lucy as wardens of the western marches and in the succeeding years was one of the com∣missioners in the memorable treaties for acknowledging David king of the Scotch dominions and for making a renunciation of King Edward's claim of sovereignty over the crown of ScotlandHe died in the latter end of the year and was succeeded by  EPISCOPUS XIII  THOMAS APPLEBY who under the king's licence was elected by the prior and convent out of their own canons but by an interposition of the papal authority the election was annulled and he came to the see by provision from the holy see th of January  He appears in several commissions of great moment and was joined with several men of high rank in the wardenship of the west marches and shortly before his death he was in the commission for proclaim∣ing on the borders the articles of a truce concluded with France and Scotland His particular cha∣racter is not delivered down to us he appears to have been peaceful with his clergy and steady in his loyaltyHe departed this life A D The chapter with the usual licence proceeded to an election for a successor and they accordingly chose one William Strickland but here the pope shewed an absolute disapprobation and refused to consecrate him and of his own nomination placed in this see  EPISCOPUS XIV  ROBERT REED A D who was translated to Chichester in the course of the same year and was succeeded in Carlisle by  EPISCOPUS XV  THOMAS MERKSWe have no evidence before us whether he was the nominee of the chapter or otherwise he was one of the monks of Westminster and a great adherent to the unhappy monarch Richard II in whose will he was named an executor The history of that particular aera is not wanted to shew the reader from what principles he stood an advocate in parliament for the deposed king his attachment was so warm and his temper so regardless of every thing but truth that in the first sessions under King Henry IV he pronounced the severest condemnations on the measures and the men by which the revolution had been effected and even treated the reigning prince with that derogation and con∣tempt that he was committed for high treason and deprived of his bishoprick  Tyndal Rymer  On the d of January A D the king consented he should be removed from the Tower to Westminster This relaxation of offended majesty was soon after followed by a permission under letters patent to obtain from the pope in benefices of the court of Rome appointments of the yearly amount of an hundred merks but episco∣pacy was excepted In we find him get institution to the rectory of Todenham in Gloucestershire The king made his petition to the holy see that the bishoprick of Carlisle might be supplied by the consecration of  EPISCOPUS XVI  WILLIAM STRICKLAND who in had been rejected by his holiness and who now came to this see th of August It cannot be doubted from the channel by which he had his advancement that he was a strict adherent to the interests of the reigning prince and accordingly we find his name among the prelates who subscribed the act of succession and assurance of the crown of England to the sons of King Henry We also find him in the commission issued for the arrest and imprisonment of all persons professing their dissatisfaction in the then settlement of the crown and who to encourage faction and disorder caused it to be reported that King Richard II lately deposed and dead was still living within the dominions of Scotland by means of which evil reports the late adherents of that monarch were spirited up to tumult and rebellion In fact this was a commission of persecution the family of the unhappy monarch deposed had considerable interests and connections of blood in the northern parts and also much power so that this commission was sent forth as a scourge at once to repress and humble them and also to put them in the power of the minions of a court whose interests on such occasions may well be devised and whose use of such an instrument is knownBishop Strickland departed this life on the th day of August A D after having held the see near twenty years He was in∣terred in the cathedral of Carlisle his monument and effigies being in the north aile He was succeeded by  EPISCOPUS XVII  ROGER WHELPDALE of a Cumberland family a man allowed by all writers of great learning He had his education in Baliol College Oxford where he gained a fellowship he removed into Queen's College where he was made provost and on the th of October he was elected bishop of this diocese having previously obtained the provision of the see of Rome in his favour his election followed of course  As bishop of Carlisle we do not find him an active character in church or state The dispositions made by his will were to pious uses and his writings though not numerous were well received in the age he appeared inHe died in January A D and was succeeded by the translation of  EPISCOPUS XVIII  WILLIAM BARROW from the see of Bangor by the sole authority of Rome He was doctor of Canon Law and chancellor of the university of Oxford  We have few materials from whence to deduce his character whilst he held this bishoprick we find him named in the commission for entering into a truce with the Scots at Hawden Stank  Rymer  and in he appears among the bishops who protested against Cardinal Beaufort's executing the office of prelate of the garter at Windsor on St George's day in right of his bishoprick at WinchesterHe departed this life on the th day of September A D at his Castle of Rose and was buried in the cathedral of Carlisle His successor was  EPISCOPUS XIX  MARMADUKE LUMLEY who had election by the chapter but for want of the pope's consent had not restitution of the temporal rights of the see till the th of April He was one of the noble family of Lumley in the county of Durham  He suffered great injuries and losses by the depredations committed by the Scots repeatedly within his diocese insomuch that it is said he was straitened to support his episcopal dignity  In the year upon allegation by the king's serjeants and attorney general that such archbishops and bishops of England as had heretofore accepted of the cardinals that were thereupon deprived of their prelacies here and praying that the like judgment might be given for the king in the present case of Henry Beaufort bishop of Winchester the bishops and other lords of parliament unanimously agreed that the ancient rights of the crown in this case ought to be maintained and preserved but forasmuch as the said cardinal was nearly related to his majesty that the cardinal should be fairly heard and that till this should be done search should be made in the records of the kingdom The different of the bishop of Carlisle is entered on the foot of the record thus the bishop of Carlisle differed in his answer from the rest and held that until the coming of the cardinal nothing at all ought to be done in the affair  In he was one of the commissioners to treat with the delegates of Scotland In he was translated to the see of Lincoln by virtue of the pope's provision  EPISCOPUS XX  NICHOLAS CLOSE the king's chaplain and archdeacon of Colchester succeeded to this bishoprick he had been chancellor of the university of Cambridge and there had the degree conferred on him of doctor of divinity He had gained the esteem of his sovereign by his excellent conduct in the treaty of peace concluded with the king of Scots the year before his advancement to the episcopacy in which transaction he was joined in commission with the lord privy seal the lord treasurer and comptroller of the household and others He was a commissioner to examine into the conduct of the wardens of the marches and conservators of the truce that their irregularities and offences might be punished  Rymer  In the succeeding year he was one in the commission for receiving the homage of James Earl of Douglas and others of the Scotch nobility who should make application for that purpose In the same year he was translated to Litchfield but departed this life in the month of November possessed of the accustomed provisionary instrument  EPISCOPUS XXI  WILLIAM PERCY succeeded to the see We know nothing of his political or episcopal character he was son of the Earl of Northumberland and was for some time chancellor of the university of Cambridge He departed this life in the year The profits of the bishoprick during the vacancy of the see were granted by King Edward IV to Doctor John Kingscott in part satisfaction of a royal debt with the specious countenance of a reward for singular services and soon after he was consecrated bishop of the see before he could either be reimbursed the debt or receive a gratuity out of the revenues  EPISCOPUS XXII  JOHN KINGSCOTT came in by the election of the convent with the royal assent and papal confirmation notwithstanding any sinister views there might be in his being put into the receipt of the revenue origi∣ginally But he did not live to enjoy the dignity long departing this life A D and leaving his exalted station without any memorable or characteristic events The king was not dilatory in appropriating  the profits of the bishoprick granting the temporalties to Richard Nevil Earl of Warwick and Salisbury The chapter proceeded to an election and by the provision of the holy see  EPISCOPUS XXIII  RICHARD SCROOP was advanced to this bishoprick A D and enjoyed it four years depart∣ing this life th of May He was one of those prelates whose episcopacy furnishes the historian with nothing more than the dates of consecration and exit  EPISCOPUS XXIV  EDWARD STOREY succeeded to the see by the election of the chapter with the other confirming powers A D He was a man of a liberal and benevolent spirit and was one in whom com∣missions of great trust were reposed His munificence was singular though the bishoprick of Carlisle seems to retain the fewest distinguishing marks of it He bestowed considerable possessions on Pembroke Hall in Cambridge He was a liberal benefactor to the church of Ely He founded at Chichester a free school one of his most distinguished acts of charity He augmented the revenue of the see of Chichester with valuable gifts in lands and the dean and chapter there had considerable donations The most mistaken appropriation his benevolence dictated to him and which from his opulence took place was building the new cross in the marketplace of Chichester and giving to the corporation there an estate for its repairs and perpetual maintenance In we see him named among the prelates who took an oath of fealty to Edward then Prince of Wales  Rymer  He was a commissioner in several of the treaties with the Scotch and particularly in that of the marriage of the Princess Cecily second daugh∣ter of the king He was translated to the see of Chichester in the year where he died and was interred By the ordonance of the holy see he was succeeded in the bishoprick of Carlisle by  EPISCOPUS XXV  RICHARD BELL prior of Durham who received the temporalties of this see th of April Though he possessed this bishoprick to the time of his death which happened in in the course of eighteen years we collect nothing singular in his life Whilst he was prior of Durham he was in several royal commissions of treaty with the powers of Scotland but his name during his episcopacy has not occured to me in any record of moment  EPISCOPUS XXVI  WILLIAM SEVER his successor was abbot of St Mary's in York He had his education at Oxford and seems to be derived from mean parentage from the place of his birth a village near the city of Dur∣ham  Shinclisse  He was made bishop of Carlisle A D and by royal licence held his abbacy in commen∣dam He was in commission to treat about the marriage of the Princess Margaret daughter of King Henry VII with James King of Scotland In the year he was in the general treaty with James of Scotland and in he was one of the conservators of the truce signed and sworn to by both the sovereigns He was translated to Durham A D and succeeded in this bishoprick by  EPISCOPUS XXVII  ROGER LEYBURN who was consecrated st of September He is one of the vacant characters in our history departing this life A D He was of a Westmorland family had his education at Cambridge was master of Pembroke Hall and some time archdeacon and chancellor of Durham  EPISCOPUS XXVIII  JOHN PENNY was his successor in and he died in He had his education in Lincoln col∣lege Oxford was abbot of Leicester and bishop of Bangor from whence he was translated the pope's bull bearing date at Rome the st day of September We now advance to a busy and significant character in his successor  EPISCOPUS XXIX  JOHN KYTE who was a man of distinguished parts though his parentage is not handed down to us or the nature and place of his education yet he figured in the offices of the church in an age when many great characters flourished without any other advantages than great powers of genius and servility of principles In the reign of King Henry VII he was ambassador to Spain he was also subdean of the royal chapel and in the year he was made archbishop of Armagh in Ireland The influence of Cardinal Wolsey obtained him many dignities and he was devoted to his service in return he consulted our bishop on his most momentous concerns and conversed with him on matters of the highest nature with the greatest familiarity In the melancholy reverse of his fortune the friendship was not broken and the cardinal received his support from the bishop's hands  S W Cavend Memoirs  In Bishop Kyte on his installation at Carlisle resigned the archbishoprick of Avmagh and took the titular bishoprick of Thebes in Greece  The sees amounted to ducats  He was one of the commissioners of King Henry VIII to treat for a cessation of hostilities with Scot∣land and in he was one of the plenepotentiaries for establishing peace with King James V In the year we find his name among those who signed their approbation of the king's scruples con∣cerning his marriage and acquiescing with the vices and enormities of that monster of impiety and arro∣gance Launched so far in the intrigues of a corrupt court we see his name mixed with those minions who servilely courted the king's smiles with the forfeiture of virtue He was one of the four bishops who addressed Pope Clement the seventh in the matter of the king's divorce but in the latter years of his life after the cardinal was removed and the political countenance of the court changed he was wavering in his principles He was a strong opposer of Cranmer and the rising spirit of reformation and in that department was a public adherent to the archbishoprick of YorkHe died in London th of June and was buried at Stepney  HIS EPITAPH  Under this stone closyde and marmorale  Lyeth

 EPISCOPUS XXX  ROBERT ALDRIDGE succeeded to the see A D As he lived in a busy age and was present to many great changes in church and state one should expect from a man of so great a character as to his learning one whom Erasmus called in his early years "blanda eloquentiae Juvenis" a poet and ora∣tor of more than ordinary note that he would have been a shining figure in the multiform business of this part of Henry's reign but we may judge from his constantly holding the appointments he had that he temporized with the vereing measures of the prince and like the notorious though perhaps imagi∣nary character of the vicar of Bray still keeping the saddle let the object of the pursuit be what it might The servility that strikes the idea when one conceives such a character in the time of this monarch in∣inspires aversion It may be a harsh sentence but it proceeds from a fact that produces large and na∣tural inferences Let us attend to his progress in life Buckinghamshire was the place of his birth and  he received his education at Eaton till the year when he was appointed a scholar of King's col∣lege Cambridge He was once proctor of that university and from thence he became master fellow and provost of Eaton About the year he was made bachelor of divinity at Oxford and the fol∣lowing year took up his doctor's degree Soon after he was appointed archdeacon of Colchester and in the year was installed a canon at Windsor and made register of the order of the garter He was an opposer of Cranmer and adhered to the Romish profession of faith indeed in the work called the Bishop's Book containing the godly and pious institution of a christian it is said he joined with that archbishop but touching the doctrine of the seven sacraments his opinion was immediately opposite and he promoted the act of st King Henry VIII touching the six articles contrary to every effort of CranmerHe departed this life and was succeeded by  EPISCOPUS XXXI  OWEN OGLETHORP who by the inconsistencies in his public actions seems to have been a very weak man He received the temporalties of this bishoprick in the month of October in the year but the pope's confirmatory bull did not arrive till the month of January following He was born at a small village near Tadcaster in the county of York of inferior parents and had his education in Magdalene College Oxford In the year he was proctor of the university and soon after was entered bache∣lor of divinity In the year he was chosen president of the college and in had the distin∣guished office of vice chancellor He was made a canon and soon after dean of the royal chapel at Windsor and in the first year of Queen Mary's reign he was appointed secretary to the order of the garter this was a year of great honour to him for in it he held the presidency of Magdalene College the rectories of Newington and Hassely in Oxfordshire together with the deanry of Windsor In he was one of the appointed disputants in the controversy with Cranmer Latimer and Rydley and shewed himself a most inveterate adversary to the principles of reformation and even to that humane rule toleration In we see him acting in the inconsistent character I intimated for during the vacancy of the see of Canterbury when all the bishops had refused to officiate in the coronation of Queen Elizabeth he only the lowest of the tribe the bitterest in the measures against reformists and the inte∣rests of the protestant church he only could be found to place the crown on the head of that illustrious princess the lords of the council willing that the ceremony should have every outward dignity sent for all the pontifical robes and ensigns of high office used by the archbishop on that solemn occasion that our prelate might be duely habited for the occasion It is not to be reconciled how Oglethorpe could be influenced to this office the character of the princess and her sentiments in religious matter were no secrets and the bishop's faith and sentiments were publicly avouched the inconsistency is not to be reconciled but by the discovery of those influences and private springs of the state which are long since locked up in the impenetrable regions of oblivion How must he have been shocked and confounded whilst the ceremony was performing by the command of the queen not to elevate the consecrated host in the celebration of mass usual in this solemnity "  because she liked it not  Wood with a voice of commiseration would palliate the error with his pity  For the fact when he saw the issue of the mat∣ter and both himself and the whole tribe of his secret order deprived the churches holy laws and faith against the conditions of her consecration and acception into that royal office violated he fore repented him all the days of his life which were for that special cause both short and wearisome  In the first parliament he gave his vote against the bills for restitution of first fruits for restoring the supremacy exchange of bishops lands and uniformity of the common prayer He would willingly by his adherence to his old partizans have recovered a reputation he had lost by being a tool to the pre∣vailing party and by his unsteadiness he dropt to the ground between the two The council fined him l for nonattendance at Sewel's challenge in disputation A D as her majesty had commanded and shortly after he was deprived of his bishoprick worth l  His death was sudden but the cause uncertain the popular report was that it happened in an apo∣plexy He was privately buried at St Dunstan's in the west By his will he ordered the foundation of a school and hospital at Tadcaster with an ample endowment  EPISCOPUS XXXII  JOHN BEST who succeeded to the bishoprick was a man of a different cast of the true reformists principles and one who had lived obscurely during the reign of Quen Mary to conceal himself from  the rage and intemperate zeal that distinguished that short but unhappy period He was born in the northern parts of Yorkshire of parents of a low station and had his education in the university of Oxford He was consecrated A D when he was years of age The unsettled and turbu∣lent estate of the north was such that he was obliged to have a commission to arm himself and depen∣dants within his bishoprick against the tumultuous and enraged populace He was one of those who was created doctor in divinity by Doctor Humphreys the queen's professor at Oxford at a private con∣vention in London and he subscribed the Saxon homilies  The following letter is preserved in Strype p it is curiousth April To Archbishop Parker  "I have a commendam of a parish called Rumald Church It will expire within a year or less The advowson of the same is ordered to be sold to gentlemen of this country at unreasonable sums of money So that it is apparent the reve∣nues thereof are like to come into the temporal mens' hands and the cure into some unlearned ass's as many others are like to do in these parts unless your Grace be a good stay therein For this cause and for that my charge here in the queen's service doth daily increase and also that in time of wars I have no refuge left to sly unto but only this I am compelled to be a suitor to your Grace for the renewing of my commendam for the time of my life In doing whereof your Grace shall both stay the covetous gripe that hath the advowson for his prey the unlearned ass from the cure where I have now a learned preacher and bind me as I am otherwise most bound to serve and pray for your Grace's long con∣tinuance in honour and godliness your Grace's poor brother to commandJOANNES CARLIOLENSIS  He died d of May and was in∣terred in this cathedral  EPISCOPUS XXXIII  RICHARD BARNES was his successor From this period of time the business and importance of bishops in secular affairs declined in their spiritual powers they were so reduced that only within their respec∣tive bishopricks they held the authorities consistent with the ancient rules of the common law without the superlative aid of the see of Rome so that from this aera the history of our prelates becomes little more than personal Bishop Barnes was born in the county of Lancaster and educated in Brazen Nose College Oxford where he took a degree of master of arts and was elected a fellow He had a degree of bachelor of divinity at Cambridge was chancellor of the cathedral at York and residentiary canon there for the prebendary of Loughton In he was eonsecrated suffragan bishop of Nottingham and in was consecrated bishop of Carlisle By Rymer it appears so soon as he was possessed of the church of Rumaldkirk he should vacate Stokesley which he held with his bishoprick together with Stonegrave In he was translated to the see of Durham where he diedHe was succeeded by  EPISCOPUS XXXIV  JOHN MEYE who was consecrated bishop of this see A D In he was master of Catharine Hall and was vice chancellor of Cambridge He is marked by some writers as being intemperately anxious after worldly wealth That he attempted to obtain from the chapter some bene∣ficial leases for relations  Dr Todd  Under pretence that Rose Castle was held by the warden of the

Queen's College Oxford where he had a fellowship and had an excellent reputation for learning and piety Whilst he was master of arts in he was chosen principal of Edmund hall and in he was made provost of Queens in which office he exerted himself in the reformation of certain innovations and improprieties which had crept in by the negligence of his predecessors he saw the college return to its former splen∣dor and significance and in eighteen years attendance brought it back to its once flourishing state He was consecrated bishop of Carlisle in having enjoyed the degree of doctor in divinity for eight yearsHe died at Rose Castle the th day of June as it is supposed of the plague as he was interred a few hours after his exitHis successor  EPISCOPUS XXXVI  ROBERT SNOWDEN was a Nottinghamshire man by birth he was consecrated bishop of Carlisle in November Before this advancement he was prebendary of Southwell He departed this life in London in the spring of the year and was succeeded by  EPISCOPUS XXXVII  RICHARD MILBURNE a native of Gilsland who was translated from St Davids' to the see of Chester in September He was vicar of Sevenoak in Kent sometime dean of Rochester and from thence was advanced to the bishoprick of St Davids' He left l for the endowment of an hospital and school and departed this life A D There is a single sermon of his extant on the subject of the imposition of hands preached and published whilst he was vicar of SevenoakHis successor  EPISCOPUS XXXVIII  RICHARD SENHOUSE was a native of Cumberland of the Netherhall family and came to the see in June He was a student in Trinity College Cambridge was elected a fellow of St Johns' and in obtained a degree of doctor of divinity He had his promotion from the crown for from a chaplainship in the Bedford family he became chaplain to Prince Charles and afterwards to King James who appointed him to the deanry of Glocester and from thence to this bishoprickHe died by a fall from his horse in May and was interred in the cathedral of Carlisle  EPISCOPUS XXXIX  FRANCIS WHITE succeeded to the see in December From a state of obscurity we see him emerging to fame by the zeal with which he preached against the church of Rome and by his book against Fisher From the ruins of the ancient church arose innumerable sectaries the great stock was hewn down and from the roots issued a multitude of ungrafted shoots bearing unprofitable fruit among others the Arminian principles were introduced this bishop even taught them on the solemn festival of Christmas in the chapelroyal in the hearing of his sovereign and soon after was translated to the see of Norwich so formidable was the growth of innovations in religion and arminianism in particular that they occasioned a parliamentary inquiry From his fervour against the papists he was employed by the king as a spy upon the conduct of the countess of Denbeigh who was much inclined to listen to the rules of that faith to reward him for his assiduity in that duty he first was made dean of Carlisle and then appointed to the bishoprick He did not stop at Norwich but was advanced to the see of Ely in and departed this life six years afterwards Upon his translation to Norwich he was succeeded in the see of Carlisle by  EPISCOPUS XL  BARNABY POTTER who in those days of division and new devices in the sacred temple arose to signi∣ficance by his zeal as a puritanical preacher He was born in the county of Westmorland within the barony of Kendal was a student in Queen's College Oxford where he held a fellowship In he took his degree in divinity and was elected provost after he had distinguished himself in Devonshire by his puritanical doctrines He was one of the king's chaplains and was consecrated bishop of this see in March and died in the year  EPISCOPUS XLI  JAMES USHER his successor in the bishoprick of Carlisle was a man of deep erudition and a zealous protestant without bigotry and fanaticism too much the lincture of the age He held the revenues of this bishoprick in commendam by the grant of King Charles I as a compensation for his great suffer∣ings in his archbishoprick of Armagh in Ireland by the commotions in that kingdom He was by birth an Irishman and had his education in the university of Dublin He was promoted to the bishop∣rick of Meath in and four years afterwards was advanced to the archbishoprick With difficulty and a parsimonious hand he subsisted on the revenues of our see diminished and exhausted as they were by the armies of England and Scotland alternately quartering in this county at length the seizure which was made by parliament on all the lands of bishops brought him to great distress In consideration of his eminent character his learning and virtuous zeal he had a pension of l ayear granted to him by parliamentary order but it was paid very ill insomuch that he never received it above once or twice  He died in March at the countess of Peterborough's at Rygate Surry in the th year of his age Cromwell from what principle it cannot be divined not agreeable to his character from some sini∣ster view or private influence ordered him to be buried at the public charge in Westminster abbey to defray the expence of which he gave a draft upon the treasury for l  And this he did out of an  honourable respect to the memory of so learned a champion of the Protestant cause as the archbishop was  so say our authors Nicholson and Burn But he was a wretch whose soul could not be touched with such sentiments hypocrisy or some low and selfish view intitled him to display this honour and pomp at the interment of a man whom he and his creatures had starved to death inconsistent and abo∣minable are the two contrarieties Cromwell gavedirections that the bishop's library should not be sold without his consent but it was plundered of many of the valuable manuscripts the soldiers took many choice books at a price of their own making and in the confusion which then distracted the state the collection was mutilated and greatly prejudiced The books which escaped the hands of ruffians were given by King Charles II to the college of DublinOn the restoration of King Charles II this see was supplied by  EPISCOPUS XLII  RICHARD STERN was elected a person of little note by birth He had his education in Cambridge was master of Jesus College and took the degree of doctor in divinity He was domestic chaplain to archbishop Laud and attended on the scaffold at his execution He was a prisoner in the tower with several others upon a complaint made by Cromwell who was then one of the burgesses of Cambridge that they had conveyed the college plate for the king's relief at York from this cause he was dispossessed of his several appointments and lived in obscurity till the restoration In he was translated to York and died there in The character given of him by bishop Burnet we think ought to receive great credit from the known integrity of the writer and he intimates that  he was a sour illtempered man and was chiefly studious of measures to enrich his family he was particularly attached to the court and servile in adopting the measures then moved in that he was zealous in the affairs of the duke of York and was strongly suspected of popery  Nicholson and Burn have attempted to rescue his character by the publication of a letter which they say was written from York to his successor at Carlisle but is anonymous and if it is from the hand of any person of note it was as easy to subscribe the name to give it weight and authority as to publish the sentences to give him a superficial character  He was greatly respected and generally lamented All the clergy commemorate his sweet condescensions his free communications faithful counsels exemplary temperance chearful hospitality and bountiful charity  such is this epistolary panegyric and which is only equalled by his monumental inscrip∣tion Bishop Burnet must have been basely inveterate or deceived  Hic spe futurae gloriae situs est  Richardus Sterne Mansfeldiae honestis parentibus ortus  Tria apud Cantabrigienses collegia certatim  Ipsum cum superbia arripiunt et

not so very full of praise on the following occasion His suc∣cessor  settling at RoseCastle  the only remaining habitable house then belonging to the see and finding even this in a most miserable condition a great part of it having been burnt by the Scots in the late rebellion and the chapel  which was the only repair bishop Sterne pretended to notwithstanding what is said in the flattering epitaph abovementioned although he had received the immense advantages of coming to the see when all the leases were either totally or near expired  being so ill done that it was necessary to take it entirely down the bishop thought it expedient to proceed against his metropolitan and immediate predecessor for dilapidations Whereupon the archbishop made a tender of l for re∣pairing the chapel  and pleaded the act of oblivion and indemnity  cap c  in bar of all other dilapidations  The court of delegates adjudged the said tender sufficient for repairing the said chapel  and that all the other dilapidations were covered by the said act  and so dismissed the cause with costs on ei∣ther side The bishop being thus totally defeated of all aid from  his rich predecessor  the expences of the law suit having cost him more than l set about the repairs himself  If in this single instance bishop Burnet's character of the prelate is so sufficiently justified how might we expect it to be corrobo∣rated by his more private history  EPISCOPUS XLIII  EDWARD RAINBOW came to the see in He was born at Bilton in the county of Lincoln being the son of the parish priest there He was educated at Westminster school and was a student in Corpus Christi College Oxford He obtained a fellowship in Magdalen College Cambridge where he was tutor to several eminent pupils among whom were the sons of lords Suffolk and Dain∣court In the year he was elected master of Magdalen and took his degree of doctor of divinity but he was soon after deprived of his mastership for refusing to sign a protestation against the king In he obtained the living of Chesterfield in Essex and in the Earl of Warwick presented him to the valuable living of Benefield in the county of Northampton He was restored to his master∣ship and made dean of Peterborough soon after K Charles's restoration and in the year he was made vicechancellor of the university of Cambridge  Three sermons only are extant of his worksOne preached at St Paul's Cross th September intitled "Labour forbidden and commanded"Another at the funeral of Susannah Countess of Suffolk th May Eccl vii A third at the funeral of Ann Countess Dowager of Pembroke and Montgomery at Appleby in Westmorland th April Prov xiv N and B  He departed this life in the year of his age in the month of March and was interred at the parish church of Dalston He was succeeded by  EPISCOPUS XLIV  THOMAS SMITH born at Whitewall in Westmorland He had his education at Appleby free school and was a student in Queen's College Oxford He was a man though deeply read in the learning of his age of consummate modesty and humble expectations In the early part of life in the university he had the degree of master of arts and held a fellowship He was a well reputed tutor and had many eminent pupils Whilst the king was resident at Oxford he was appointed preacher at Christchurch and at St Mary's he preached before the Parliament In the succeeding confusions in church and state he retired to the north and lived in great privacy On the restoration he was created bachelor of divinity and soon after by diploma had a doctor's degree given him by the university of Oxford  He was one of those who were fortunate enough to be in the sovereign's remembrance for multitudes were neglected and was made one of his chaplains in ordinary in November he was nominated to a prebend in this church A prebend in the cathedral of Durham in a few months was offered to him by bishop Cosins and there he had conceived his preferments in the church were to rest for at a considerable expence he repaired the house in the college at Durham in a manner consistent with an idea that it would be the place of his residence for life  In he was appointed dean of Carlisle and in on the recommendation of K Charles he was elected to this see He died at RoseCastle on the th of April and was buried in this cathedral  The dean's house was left by his predecessor in the same ruinous condition the rebellious times had brought it into but was now mostly from the ground built at his own expence  The altar of the cathedral had his offering of a large set of double gilt communion plate and his praises were ad∣dressed to God on an handsome new organ given by him to the choir  In his wife died at Rose and was buried in the cathedral at Carlisle a

son of the rector of that parish He was a student in Queen's college Oxford where in having taken the degree of master of arts he was elected to a fellowship In he was made a prebendary of this church by bishop Rainbow and had the vicarage of Torpenhow and in the year following he was made arch∣deacon of Carlisle In the year he was consecrated at Lambeth bishop of this see a promotion said to be obtained by the interest of the Musgraves of Edenhall an assertion injurious to his great learning his high merit and connections in life from whence his promotion was derived  He found some difficulties from the imperfection of the instruments in granting institution to doctor Francis Atterbury to the deanry of Carlisle which by the queen's special command were obviated but it is probable this imbittered their minds against each other for on the bishop's interposition as visitor under the statute of K Henry VIII for appeasing certain contests which had arisen between the dean and the chapter at the dean's instigation doctor Todd protested against his right of visitation insisting on the invalidity of that statute and that in the crown only was vested that privilege  There was an early grudge between them for Dr Attorbury had written against our bishop's English Historical Library touching convocations  things run so high that Todd was suspended and excommunicated and the dispute produced such serious consequences as to promote a law for confirming the statute of K Henry VIII In the year he was made Lord Almoner in was translated to Londonderry in Ireland and died suddenly before his removal to the archbishoprick of Cashell for which translation the instruments were made out  He was a celebrated writer in his works discovering an excellent and almost universal genius In the year the secretary of state Sir Joseph Williamson sent him to Leipsic to acquire a know∣ledge of the Dutch and other continental languages At the instance of the professor there he translated out of the English into Latin Hook's Essay on the Motion of the Earth from the Sun's Parallax In the year he published the three first volumes of the English Atlas comprehending an account of Poland Denmark Norway Iceland and Germany In the year he wrote two short accounts of the inscriptions on the Bewcastle monument and font at Bridekirk in this county published in the philosophical transactions In he published the first part of his English historical library the second part appearing the next year and in it was completed in the third part In he  published one for Scotland and in one also for Ireland In he published the Border Laws In he wrote a preface to doctor Chamberlain's book on the Lord's prayer In were pub∣lished in octavo a collection of papers which had appeared in the Daily Courant and other periodical prints In he wrote a preface to the third edition of doctor Wilkin's Leges AngloSaxonicae He was the author of many sermons which appeared from the press and left several manuscripts to the dean and chapter of Carlisle touching this diocese On his translation he was succeeded in this bishoprick by  EPISCOPUS XLVI  SAMUEL BRADFORD who was consecrated in

where he obtained his first rudiments he was student in Queen's college Oxford and there held a fellowship He was in succeeding years dean of Gloucester prebendary of Lincoln and rector of St Peter's Cornhill London He died in Queensquare Westminster in October and was interred at St Peter's beforementioned  EPISCOPUS XLVIII  GEORGE FLEMING of the Rydal family succeeded to this bishoprick he died at RoseCastle in the st year of his age and was interred in this cathedral He was a student in Edmundhall Oxford where he took the degree of master of arts he was domestic chaplain to bishop Smith and by him was presented to the living of Aspatrick and afterwards to a prebend in this church In he was appointed to the archdeaconry by bishop Nicholson and in he was made dean He was succeeded by  EPISCOPUS XLIX  RICHARD OSBALDISTON of Hunmandby in Yorkshire who was consecrated in He had his education at Cambridge and was dean of York In he was translated to the see of London and two years afterwards departed this life By his translation he made room for a prelate here of whom no greater panegyric could be pronounced than that now before us  He was of a noble generous and humane disposition a friend to all mankind  and never had an enemy  EPICOPUS L  CHARLES LYTTLETON of Hagley in Worcestershire third son of Sir Thomas Lyttleton He had his first rudiments at Eton and completed his studies at University College Oxford He was intended for the bar and accordingly was entered in the temple and took the gown but either the excellent vir∣tues mentioned by his panegyrists proved so incompatible with that profession or on account of a real tenderness of constitution which could not endure the heavy and laborious applications of mind which it required he was obliged to quit the law he returned to Oxford and entered into holy orders He had the rectory of Alve church Worcestershire in He was one of the chaplains in ordinary to King George II and in the year he was made dean of Exeter He enioyed this bishoprick but six years dying A D at his house in LondonHe was interred at Hagley  An excellent character is given of this prelate by Dr Mills dean of Exeter in his address to the society of anti∣quaries on his succeeding him as president  EPISCOPUS LI  EDMUND LAW D D succeeded to the see in He was born in the parish of Cartmel in Lanca∣shire in the year His father who was a clergyman held a small chapel in that neighbourhood but the family had been situated at Askham in the county of Westmorland He was educated for some time at Cartmel school afterwards at the free grammarschool at Kendal from which he went very well in∣structed in the learning of grammar schools to St John's College in Cambridge  Soon after taking his first degree he was elected fellow of Christ's College in that university During his residence in which college he became known to the public by a translation of Archbishop King's Essay upon the Origin of Evil with copious notes in which many metaphysical subjects curious and interesting in their own nature are treated of with great ingenuity learning and novelty To this work was prefixed under the name of a Preliminary Dissertation a very valuable piece written by the Rev Mr Gay of Sidney College Our bishop always spoke of this gentleman in terms of the greatest respect In the Bible and in the writings of Mr Locke no man he used to say was so well versed  He also whilst at ChristCollege undertook and went through a very laborious part in preparing for the press an edition of Stephen's Thesaurus His acquaintance during his first residence in the univer∣sity was principally with Dr Waterland the learned master of Magdalen College Dr Jortin a name known to every scholar and Dr Taylor the editor of Demosthenes  In the year he was presented by the university to the living of Graystock in the county of Cumberland a rectory of about l a year The advowson of this benefice belonged to the family of Howards of Graystock but devolved to the university for this turn by virtue of an act of parliament which transfers to these two bodies the nomination to such benefices as appertain at the time of the vacancy to the patronage of a Roman Catholic The right however of the university was contested and it was not till after a lawsuit of two years continuance that Mr Law was settled in his living Soon after this he married Mary the daughter of John Christian Esq of Unerigg in the county of Cumberland a lady whose character is remembered with tenderness and esteem by all who knew her  In he was promoted by Sir George Fleming bishop of Carlisle to the archdeaconry of that diocese and in went from Graystock to reside at Salkeld a pleasant village upon the banks of the river Eden the rectory of which is annexed to the archdeaconry Mr Law was not one of those who lose and forget themselves in the country During his residence at Salkeld he published Considerations on the Theory of Religion to which were subjoined Reflections on the Life and Character of Christ and an appendix concerning the use of the words Soul and Spirit in holy Scripture and the state of the dead there described  Dr Keene held at this time with the bishoprick of Chester the mastership of Peterhouse in Cambridge Desiring to leave the university he procured Dr Law to be elected to succeed him in that station This took place in the year in which year Dr Law resigned his archdeaconry in favour of Mr Eyre a brotherinlaw of Dr Keene Two years before this he had proceeded to his degree of doctor in divinity in his public exercise for which he defended the doctrine of what is usually called the "sleep of the soul"  About the year he was appointed head librarian of the university a situation which as it pro∣cured an easy and quick access to books was peculiarly agreeable to his taste and habits Some time  after this he was also appointed casuistical professor In the year he suffered an irreparable loss by the death of his wife a loss in itself every way afflicting and rendered more so by the situation of his family which then consisted of eleven children many of them very young Some years afterwards he received several preferments which were rather honourable expressions of regard from his friends than of much advantage to his fortune  By Dr Cornwallis then bishop of Litchfield afterwards archbishop of Canterbury who had been his pupil at Christ College he was appointed to the archdeaconry of Staffordshire and to a prebend in the church of Litchfield By his old acquaintance Dr Green bishop of Lincoln he was made a prebendary of that church But in the year by the intervention of the duke of Newcastle to whose interest in the memorable contest for the high stewardship of the university he had adhered in opposition to some temptations he obtained a stall in the church of Durham The year after this the duke of Grafton who had a short time before been elected chancellor of the university recommended the master of Peter∣house to his majesty for the bishoprick of Carlisle This recommendation was made not only without solicitation on his part or that of his friends but without his knowledge until the duke's intention in his favour was signified to him by the archbishop  In or about the year our bishop gave to the public a handsome edition in three volumes quarto of the Works of Mr Locke with a Life of the Author and a preface Mr Locke's writings and cha∣racter he held in the highest esteem and seems to have drawn from them many of his own principles he was a disciple of that school About the same time he published a tract which engaged some atten∣tion in the controversy concerning subscription and he published new editions of his two principal works with considerable additions and some alterations Besides the works already mentioned he published in or a very ingenious  Inquiry into the Ideas of Space Time  c in which he combats the opinions of Dr Clarke and his adherents on these subjects  Dr Law held the see of Carlisle almost nineteen years during which time he twice only omitted spending the summer months in his diocese at the bishop's residence at Rose Castle a situation with which he was much pleased not only on account of the natural beauty of the place but because it restored him to the country in which he had spent the best part of his life In the year he paid this visit in a state of great weakness and exhaustion and died at Rose about a month after his arrival there on the th day of August and in the th year of his age  The life of Dr Law was a life of incessant reading and thought almost entirely directed to meta∣physical and religious inquires but the tenet by which his name and writings are principally distin∣guished is "that Jesus Christ at his second coming will by an act of his power restore to life and consciousness the dead of the human species who by their own nature and without this interposition would remain in the state of insensibility to which the death brought upon mankind by the sin of Adam had reduced them" He interpreted literally that saying of St Paul Cor XV  As by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead  This opinion had no other effect upon his own mind than to increase his reverence for Christianity and for its divine Founder He retained it as he did his other speculative opinions without laying as many are wont to do an extravagant stress upon their importance and without pretending to more certainty than the subject allowed of No man formed his own conclusions with more freedom or treated those of others with greater candour and equity He never quarrelled with any person for differing from him or considered that difference as a sufficient reason for questioning any man's sincerity or judging meanly of his understanding He was zealously attached to religious liberty because he thought that it leads to truth yet from his heart he loved peace But he did not perceive any repugnancy in these two things There was nothing in his elevation to his bishoprick which he spoke of with more pleasure than its being a proof that decent freedom of inquiry was not discouraged  He was a man of great softness of manners and of the mildest and most tranquil disposition His voice was never raised above its ordinary pitch His countenance seemed never to have been ruffled it preserved the same kind and composed aspect truly indicating the calmness and benignity of his temper He had an utter dislike of large and mixed companies Next to his books his chief satisfaction was in the serious conversation of a literary companion or in the company of a few friends In this sort of society he would open his mind with great unreservedness and with a peculiar turn and sprightliness of expression His person was low but well formed his complexion fair and delicate Except occasional interruptions by the gout he had for the greatest part of his life enjoyed good health and when not confined by that distemper was full of motion and activity About nine years before his death he was  greatly enfeebled by a severe attack of the gout in his stomach and a short time after that lost the use of one of his legs Notwithstanding his fondness for exercise he resigned himself to this change not only without complaint but without any sensible diminution of his chearfulness and good humour His fault for we are not writing a panegyric was the general fault of retired and studious characters too great a degree of inaction and facility in his public station The modesty or rather bashfulness of his nature together with an extreme unwillingness to give pain rendered him sometimes less firm and efficient in the administration of authority than was requisite But it is the condition of human mortality There is an opposition between some virtues which seldom permits them to subsist together in perfection  We owe our grateful acknowledgements to the Rev William Paley our late Chancellor for the above account of Bishop Law a copy of which he also transmitted to the Encyclopaedia BritanniaTHE EDITORS  The bishop was interred with due solemnity in his cathedral church in which a handsome monument is erected to his memory bearing the following inscription  Columnae hujus sepultus est ad pedem  EDMUNDUS LAW S T P  per XIX fere annos hujusce ecclesiae Episcopus

cathedral is the parochial church  It comprehends Scotchstreet Fisherstreet Castlestreet and Abbeystreet within the city Cal∣dewgate Cumbersdale Richardgate Newtown and Newby without  the city and principal parts of both parishes are within that liberty which is known by the name of the manor of the soccage of Carlisle In the notes is the boundaries  By virtue of a commission issued from the court of exchequer the boundaries were thus certified by the commissioners Beginning at the south side of the river Eden over against Etterby and there leaving the same river it extendeth southwards by Wearihome unto Dowbecksike the lands on the right hand being the inheritance of Mr Briscoe from thence it extendeth eastwards against bishops lands to the river of Caldew or Caldewbridge where crossing over the same bridge against Caldew∣gate it extendeth up the river against the abbey lands and Dentonholme until it cometh to a parcel of DentonHolme lying on the west side of Caldew containing about nine acres of land where it leaveth the river and incloseth the same parcel of land on the west side thereof on the river side against the south west corner of the Walkmiln closes and so crossing over the river and leaving the same it ex∣tendeth southwards towards Curreck by the west side of the fields of Blackall Curreck and Uprightby and so about the same fields to a cross way of the west end of Uprightby town and so southwards by the high way to Crunybeck which falleth into the river of Petrell and there leaving the same way it extendeth down the same beck to Petrell and from it turneth northwards down the same river to the south east corner of Paradise where crossing the river and leaving it it goeth down a small miln water on the south side of Paradise and incloseth the same at Gallows bridge from whence crossing over the high way it incloseth part of the Spittle Crook lying on the south side of Petrell and so extendeth still down Petrell to the foot thereof where the same falleth into Eden from thence up over the said river of Eden to the foot of a beck falling thereunto against Kynnyholme and so up the same beck on the west side of Richardby to the northwest corner of Stanwix grounds then leaving the same beck it extendeth northwards to the highway leading from Carlisle to Tirraby and so crossing over the same way it passeth on the north side of Horsemanfield to the north west corner thereof and from thence extendeth southwards to a highway dividing Horsemanfield and the west part of Stanwix and so crossing the same way it extendeth on the west side of Stanwix to the river of Eden and from thence down the same river to Etterby where it first began  The parish of St Cuthbert's is the other division of this city The church  becoming ruinous was rebuilt in on a new and handsome plan neatly vault∣ed pewed galleried and well lighted it has a square steeple or tower with a dome and covered with lead but no ring of bells The income is but small yet having had several augmentations lands have been lately purchased and added thereto of the yearly value of forty pounds  It comprehends English street within the city and Botchardgate Carleton Brisco Uprightby Harraby and Blackhill without  In this parish is the chapelry of Wrea its antiquity cannot be ascertained further back than the reign of King Edward II In Bishop Halton allowed a chaplain there on condition that he resided within his chapelry It consists of the village of Wrea which consist of twentyone families containing sixty males and fiftyfour females A D the chapel was consecrated by Bishop Flem∣ing and by augmentations lands have been purchased so that the curate's income amounts to about l ayear with a good house upon the lands In the act of consecration the nomination of a curate is reserved to the dean and chapter but hitherto they have been appointed by the vestry men  In Philip Robinson David Graham John Parker Joseph Parker who was a celebrated schoolmasterMr Gascoin  We extract the following account of a relation of this family from a newspaper dated September the d A D    Woodside the seat of John Losh Esq  "On Thursday last died at Gordon Castle of the small pox in the th year of his age the Rev Mr William Losh senior  Taberder  of Queen's College Oxford and chaplain to her grace the duchess of Gordon He was a gentleman of the brightest parts and had made great advances in all the branches of polite and solid learning that could well be expected at his years He was blest with so sweet and humane a disposition that the common accidents of life gave him no lasting disquiet nor interrupted that universal benevolence which with him diffused itself in a proportionable scale of duty from the whole body of mankind to the meanest stranger This benign disposition made him the constant advocate of the rights and priviledges of the human species in opposition to tyranny and oppression these he maintain∣ed upon all occasions with a warmth and spirit which well became a British subject He had many good qualities but was eminent for piety and as he drew from religion an unbroken peace of mind a solid satisfaction and an unsurmountable courage in return he cultivated religion in the province assigned to him with indefatigable industry and a zeal undaunted but such as was founded on scripture and sup∣ported by reason  "With all these endowments he lived the agreeable companion of the ingenious the faithful friend of the virtuous and the brother of the truly religious as well as the terror of the hypocrite the super∣stitious and the prophane He was bright at all times but he shone in the pulpit when he pleaded the cause of truth with such a strength of reason and such a flow of eloquence that his hearers were at once convinced and charmed  "He died in the very spring of his age and but in the blossom of his virtues yet he discovered enough to make it evident that had he lived to shew himself in the rising stages of life his great and uncommon endowments would have rendered him dear to the polite the learned and the religious and his death would have been as justly regretted by the public as it is at present by those who had the happiness of knowing him"  adjoining this chapelry the residence of his forefathers for many generations is a handsome house and elegantly fur∣nished  his extensive estate is in high cultivation We owe him our grateful acknowledgements for the annexed plate which he has favoured us with  There are two manors within this parish viz the manor of Botchardgate or prior lordship belonging to the dean and chapter and the manor of Blackhall  Botchardby villa Bochardi was the inheritance of one Bocharda Fleming one of those that first peopled Carlisle he had a grange there for the provi∣sion of his house at Carlisle and when the Flemings went to Anglesea in Wales he left that patrimony to Guy the forester with his daughter Isold To this Guy the hunter King Henry I confirmed Bochardby to hold the same by cornage paying yearly s d cornage silver to the king It is gildable and vicontiel and gives aid with Combquinton to the sheriff yearly s d torn silver It lineally descended in the issue male unto William the son of Otho or Odan son of Ralph son of Guido the hunter de Bochardby This William lived in the time of King John and held then the manor of him Then Wil∣liam de Bochardby and Adam de Bochardby descended of younger brothers held parts of the same In the th year of King Henry III Radulph the son of William de Bochardby entered to the seigniory his sisters Alice Pavy and Agnes were his heirs Alice and Agnes gave their parts to Jacoline le Blond of Carlisle and Pavy her part to Adam Leges her son and to William son of Irco The five daughters of Jacoline did inherit viz Sunimote Johan Matild Juhan and MarriotteBochardGuido Venator and I sold his wifeRalph son of GuyOdo son of RalphWilliam son of

commonly called Blackhell is the name of the town and manor so called of old before it was inhabited being a black heathy ground part of the ancient forest of Englewood and given by Henry I to Odard de Logis baron of Wigton and citizen of Carlisle after the Flemings were thence translated Odard first builded there and planted habitations holding part in demesne and the residue in service some free which he granted forth to be holden freely others in bondage and villanage some both persons and land some land only let to free men persons in that age called Drenges and the tenure in law is called "Drengagium notandum est eos omnes eorum antecessores qui Drengorum classe erant vel per Drengagium tenure sua in∣coluisse patrimonia ante adventum Normanorum  SPELMAN  Blackhill thus made a manor by Odardus and his posterity descended by his issue male according to the pedigree of Wigton until the time of Edward III when Margaret de Wigton sole daughter and heir of Sir John de Wigton Knt last issue male of the eldest son of that house to defend her birthright was glad to divide away the manors of Blackhill Melmerby and Stainton to Robert Parving the king's serjeant at law for her strength at the common law the rectory of Wigton to the Abbey Holme for the civil law and Wigton itself to the Lord Anthony Lucy for his help in the country because her mother Idyo∣nysa Lovelot was bitterly taxed of incontinency at the instance of Sir Richard Kirkbride next heir male apparent to the land But Margaret de Wigton re∣served an estate in all things but the rectory to the heirs of her body and died without issue Therefore Blackhill fell to Sir Robert Parving who married dame Catharine the sister of the said Kirkbride to Adam Parving alias Peacock the son of John Peacock who married Johan one of the daughters and coheirs of the said Sir Robert Parving After Adam it descended in the blood of the Parvings some few descents until Margaret the wife of Thomas Boyt and William Boyt his son descended of the said Johan and Matild Walker the daughter of Alice Atwood and Thomas Whitlockman son and heir of Marga∣ret Pape daughters and heirs of Eme wife of John Scaleby the other daughter and heir of the said Robert Parving sold the same to William Stapleton and Marriotte his wife of whom the Lord Dacre purchased it  DENTON's MS  By the descendants of Lord Dacre it was sold to Sir Christopher Musgrave Bart grandfather of the present owner Sir John C Musgrave Bart  In the parish of St Mary is the manor of Caldcoates alias Harrington House It was Gilbert Camterelles A D who left it to Julian his wife she convey∣ed it to John Semen and Isabel his wife whose son Thomas Semen th Henry VI sold it to Richard Coldale of Carlisle merchant from whom it descended as followeth and from

at law from Hen Forster second son of Arthur  In the year Thomas Earl of Sussex in consideration of years ancient sinable rent granted to the tenants in number a discharge from fines and dry multure with the wood upon their tenements but reserving the ancient rent suit of court Moor Farm and Greenhew with liberty to alienate their tenements without licence of the lord giving notice thereof within days paying only a penny sine on death or alienation and to the steward for an alienation fourpence and for surrender and copy thereof d and inrolment d and d to the bailiff upon every descent or alienation and about the same time the common was divided and granted in see to the tenants without any rent reserved the lord having acres for his share in land which is now called Blackhill Park and is the inheritance of Mr Wardale of Carlisle    Milbourn's Add to Denton  We come in course to speak of the city of Carlisle It consists of several streets the chief of which are spacious noble and well built  For their names c see the plan annexed  This city had many royal grants and great privileges the first that is pointed out is that of King Henry II which was burnt by the devastations made by the Scots and is recited and confirmed by the charter of King Henry III It doth not appear when the first incorporation of the burgesses took place or what was the original constitution In the charter of King Henry III we have these words  Et quod similiter habent Gildain mercatoriam liberam ita quod nihil inde re∣spondeant aliquibus etc Nos omnes libertates illas et consuetudinos praefatis civibus nostris concedimus et hac carta nostra confirmanus pro nobis et haeredi∣bus nostris volentes quod omnibus praedictis libertatibus et consuetudinibus de caetera gaudeant et utantur libere quiete bene et in pace et integre in per∣petuum cum omnibus aliis libertatibus et liberis consuetudinibus ad praedictam villam Carlioli pertinentibus  By this charter the citizens were exempted from the payment of toll passage pontage and all customs belonging to the king with the privilege of having wood for fuel and for their erections within the forest of Carlisle  Great part of the city having again suffered by accidental fire the records were a second time destroyed King Edward I in the st year of his reign by charter dated the d day of June recites the grant of King Henry III from the inroll∣ment of it in his chancery and stating that it had been lost by fire confirmed it verbatim In consequence of his Scotch expeditions he resided frequently at Carlisle and seems to have entertained a particular regard for the place by his honouring the city with the assembly of his parliament in the th year of his reign who made their residence there from the th day of January to Palm Sunday following The memorable acts of this parliament give no small lustre to our annals  King Edward III also seems to have entertained a special affection and favour towards the citizens and in order to secure to the burgesses their privileges he caused an inquisition to be taken whereon he should found his charter of confir∣mation which bears date the th of February in the d year of his reign of England and th of France Therein it is recited that it having been found by inquisition taken by his commissioners Richard de Denton and John de Harring∣ton and returned into his chancery that the citizens  habuerunt et habere con∣sueverunt a tempore quo non existit memoria  had and were used to have the privileges therein set forth for time immemorial on the petition of the citizens  ac etiam cives civitatis praedicta nobis supplicaverunt ut sibi dictas libertates quietantias consuetudines et proficua per chartam nostram confirmare velimus  And in consideration of its being in the frontier of Scotland and well situated for the refuge and desence of the inhabitants of the adjacent territories against the frequent incursions of the Scots and also in commiseration of the late dreadful mortality of the plague and the frequent devastations made by the northern ene∣my  he granted to them the following privileges  Quod ipsi et eorum haeredes et successores cives civitatis praedide in perpetuum habeant returnam brevium omnium nostrorum et summonitionum de scaccario et aliorum brevium quo∣rumcunque ac etiam duos mercatus singulis septimanis videlicet diebus Mer∣curii et

molendinum piscariam pasturam fossman et locum cum pertinentiis tenere debent ipsique cives et antecessores et praedecessores sui a tempore cujus contrarium memoria non existit semper c  By the recitals of this grant it seems that preceding it and even for time im∣memorial the city had been governed by a mayor bailiffs and coroners but when this body politic had its commencement there is no evidence that we have yet met with  King Richard II in the th year of his reign granted them a confirmatory charter  In consequence of the spoil and devastation made by the armies of Margaret Queen of England and Henry Duke of Exeter her adherent the city obtained from King Edward IV a relaxation of one half of the feefarm rent of eighty pounds yearly paid to the crown and also gained a grant of the king's fisheries of Car∣lisle in some records called the Sheriff's Net in others under the denomination of the fishery of Frith Net in the water of Eden  The rights and privileges of the city were confirmed by several charters of King Henry VII d year of his reign King Henry VIII st King Edward VI th Queen Elizabeth and King James I d  King Charles I in the th year of his reign confirmed the preceding grants of privileges reforming only the election of mayors bailiffs and coroners this body corporate then consisting of a mayor eleven aldermen two bailiffs two coroners and twentyfour capital citizens or common council were ordered to proceed to election in the following manner  The mayor aldermen bailiffs and twentyfour capiral citizens or the major part of them in GuildHall

virtue of a special act made in the th year of that king  There was an ancient hospital without the gates of the city dedicated to St Nicholas and said to be of royal foundation though by what sovereign is not known it was instituted for the reception of thirteen lepers of both sexes In the year it was endowed with a moiety of the tithes of Little Bampton by Adam son of Robert on condition that it should constantly receive two almsmen from thence In the year the master brought a prohibition against the  bishop to prevent his visitation on an allegation of the hospital being a royal foundation In the master brethren and sisters lodged a complaint that the house was defrauded of a great part of its revenues on which the bishop issued a monition with the terrors of the greater excommunication against all persons who detained the corn or other dues appertaining to this hospital  It was granted to the prior and convent of the cathedral church here th K Edward IV and afterwards d Henry VIII made part of the endowment of the dean and chapter  under whom the site of the hospital is now held by lease  Vide Registrum brevium Tit Prohibitiones sol  Pat Edw m Rex

copies have it not  Marii victoriae  but  Marti victori  which latter may probably be favoured by some as seeming to come nearer the truth  As no vestige remains of this piece of antiquity we must rest contented with the uncertainty in which Camden and his editor have left us relative to it  Other two Roman remains are mentioned by Camden which he says he saw here one in the house of Thomas

crescent I here send you is sufficient to let you see what it is It is of copper found in digging a cellar opposite to the BushInn here It lay about nine feet deep as I looked upon it to be a choice piece of antiquity I have procured the original for you I take it to be a symbol of Isis and also wore by other gods The shank or stem by which it was stuck into the figure or standard is very strong and has a hole for a pin to fasten it from which shank arises a ring on the backside which is also very strong and will take in a man's finger I presume it might be to fasten some parts of the garb or for what other use I beg your thoughts  Extract from Mr  GALE's  Answer  As for the brass plate you sent me it seems to be nothing but an ornament belonging to the trappings of a horse and might have hung before his breast by the ring on the backside of it The hole through the shank has been for fastening a drop or pendant to it as a further ornament  In opening a gravel pitt lately on the side of a hill in the parish of Stanwix just without the suburbs of Carlisle a stratum of bones were discovered at about a yard below the surface lying about a foot thick in most parts and stretching the whole length of the pit which I apprehend to be near twenty feet I exa∣mined the spot and found divers fragments of Roman pottery ware  Elegant specimens and some of the bones were exhibited  intermixed with the bones They are I think the bones of horses and might perhaps  have been buried after an engagement between the Romans and Picts but it is not so easy to account for the fragments of pottery c which were found in great numbers intermixed with them  N B The Picts Wall ran within less than half a mile of the spot where these bones were found  Dated Dec th signed C LYTTLETON  In the Archaeologia is published accounts of stone hatchets found at Carlisle with a learned treatise thereon and to which we refer the curious reader  If we may presume to offer our sentiments on these subjects after the learned antiquaries have so elaborately expatiated thereon without the appearance of arrogance and presumption we would suggest that the bones mentioned by the bishop mixed with the fragments of the patarae were the remains of sacrifice when the ordinary receptacle was cleaned out this has been the general repository If these were the remains of animals slain in battle the mixture is not to be reconciled and it was more than such occasion would have required to clear them from the bones of men slain at the same time The learned inquirer did not dis∣cover any remains of broken trapping studings or ornaments of horses or men accoutrements The hammers or stone hatchets seem very unfit for weapons of warfare unweildy and uncouth if they had been in use in battle some testimony would have been given of them and they would not have been totally disused one might presume at the coming of the Romans but would have been exhibited as trophies or otherwise as testimonies of the valour of British heroes the ancstors of those who appeared armed against the invaders in the most sacred cause of war the defence of liberty and their country and the maintenance of the established religion We have received no account of such weapons then in use As domestic utensils it is not probable they would have been secreted with such care or de∣posited with such solemnity as even to support the head of the deceased owner in the sepulchre Could we imagine the friends of any personage who was to be interred with the funeral pomp of a tumulus would busy themselves with giving the deceased labourer his beetle with him for the regions of death We humbly conceive this was a sacred implement in the possession of the heathen priest with which he prepared the sacrifice we have innumerable relations of the abhorrence the ancients had of their sacred things and places being polluted by strangers and thence we trace the cause of these flints being concealed All degrees of reli∣gious in remote ages took great precaution to bury with the consecrated minister the instruments of his office and that was followed in the practice of the ancient Romish church The sacred  securis  of the British priest was the first emblem of his function and the properest ornament to be placed with his remains in the tomb The remnants of British priests were driven into Scotland by the arms of Rome there they longest retained their ancient rites and religion and there those instruments of the ancient priesthood have been most frequently found  The altar No in our plate of

situation was continually subject to the distress of warsare in the several irruptions of the Scots and frequently was taken from the English The border wars were prosecuted with a degree of ferocity and savage barbarity disgraceful to humanity and horrid in history  Among the various incidents in the history of Carlisle the following are the most material  So soon after the fortifications were constructed as the beginning of the reign of King Stephen David King of Scotland in the first year of his reign entered into England and took possession of this city Stephen on receiving the news is said to have exclaimed "Quae dolose cepit victoriose recipiam" but this weak prince so far from performing what he boasted made a cession of the whole county to the Scots  David Rex Scotiae  o  anno regni Stephani dolo se cepit Caerluil et novum castellum Quo audito dixit Steph rex Quae dolose cepit victoriose recipiamLEL COL v p  Scotus retinuit Cairluel concessione StephaniIbid v p  Caerloil vero retinuit Scottus concessione regis StephaniIbid vol p  In the year King David of Scotland made this city the place of his re∣treat after his dreadful overthrow at the battle of the Standard And here he re∣ceived Alberic the pope's legate by whose influence all the women captives were brought to Carlisle and set at liberty He obtained from the Scotch leaders a solemn promise that in future incursions they would spare the churches and with hold their swords from the aged from women and infants an injunction which humanity dictated but which the savage customs of the contending nati∣ons had not admitted into the modes of warfare  Henry eldest son of the empress Maud came to David at Carlisle attended by the great barons of the western parts of England and received the order of knight∣hood  with much pomp and ceremony the young prince then taking an oath that on his accession to the crown of England he would confirm to David and his son their English possessions but such are the oaths of princes Henry no sooner grasped the sceptre than he demanded of the Scotch regency restitution of Cum∣berland and in the two monarchs had an interview in this city but much dissention arose and the claim of the English monarch was not complied with  In the d yere of Henry the II the King of Scottes had the earldom of Lancastre yn his handes the cite of Cairluel Bamburgh Castel and NewcastelLEL COL Vol p  The English obtained and held quiet possession till after the accession of William the Lion who succeeded Malcome on the throne of Scotland he in the year made a fruitless assault upon Carlisle but in the ensuing year returning with an army of men he commenced a regular siege the city being defended by Robert de Vaux after laying before it some time the Scotch forces formed a blockade to give liberty for withdrawing part of the army to ravage and waste the adjacent country the garrison were reduced to great distress for want of pro∣vision and came to a conditional capitulation that if they did not receive succours from the English before Michaelmas they would surrender the place but the succeeding events prevented the capitulation being carried into effect and Wil∣liam's being made prisoner at Alnwick put an end to the disasters of the war The greatest part of the city suffered by fire in this reign and the records and charters were destroyed  Interea

greatly by an accidental fire in the year in which con∣flagration great part of the cathedral was destroyed and all the records which the city and convent had procured to be renewed were also burnt In the chronicle of Lanercost is a full account of the dreadful devastations made by this fire  In the Scots entered the western march and having laid the country waste as they approached Carlisle they burnt the suburbs and attempted to take the city by storm but the inhabitants made so brave a defence even the women mounting the walls discharging stones boiling water and other things on the assailants that they abandoned their enterprize and retreated to their own country  By an entry in the old register book of the abbey it appears that on the th June d King Edward I half the city was burnt down as far as the gate of Richardby  King Edward I resided here from the th of January in the th year of his reign to the th of June when he proceeded on his last expedition towards Scotland and died in his camp at Brugh on Sands  In the th year of the reign of King Edward II Robert Brus King of Scotland on his incursion laid waste the country as far as Allerdale and Coupland in this county he besieged Carlisle in a regular form by engines and other warlike modes for ten days and at length was obliged to withdraw his troops in great precipitation leaving behind them most of their instruments of war They were hotly pursued by the English and two of the Scottish leaders John de Moravia and Sir Robert Bardolph were taken prisoners and afterwards ransomed  In the th year of King Edward II Andrew Harcla Earl of Carlisle was seized in the castle and suffered as a traitor This action was so gallant that it appears worth repeating here the earl was publicly proclaimed a traitor by the king's command Anthony Lord Lucy was sent to apprehend him Hav∣ing dispersed his party in the city to prevent suspicion Lord Lucy with a few attendants entered the castle as having business with the earl his principal asso∣ciates in this enterprize were Sir Hugh de Louther Sir Richard de Denton and Sir Hugh de Morriceby with four esquires in arms the party to whom the design was communicated had signals appointed to them for their conduct in the business and as the knights passed each gate a number of men halted as if care∣lessly loitering for want of immediate employment but with an intention to guard the pass prevent escapes and to be at hand to lend their aid if occasion re∣quired The four chiefs with their esquires passed into the innermost and most secure parts of the castle even through the great hall to the earl's private apart∣ment where finding him sitting in an unsuspicious manner Lord Lucy accosted him requiring him to surrender or defend himself a cry of treason immediately echoed through the castle and the keeper of the inner gate prepared to shut it but was instantly slain by Sir Richard Denton The watchword being given the parties formed into bodies took possession of the gates and avenues and the earl with the whole garrison surrendered without further bloodshed The chief pri∣soner was put into safe durance till the king's pleasure relative to him should be known  In the eleventh year of King Edward III the Scots laid siege to the city of Carlisle  On John Baliol's doing homage to K Edw III the Scottes having countes in their

castle an uncom∣mon act of severity towards a prisoner of war but he was esteemed so enterpriz∣ing and dangerous an enemy by King Edward III that this was done at his special command  In the year Penrith and Carlisle were burnt by the Scots under the com∣mand of Sir William Douglas A body of the Scotch forces headed by Sir Alexander Strachan detached for foraging were intercepted and Sir Alexander was slain by Sir Robert Ogle who ran him through the body with his lance Bishop Kirby the eleventh bishop of this diocese signalized himself in this rencounter for being dismounted and in imminent danger of being made a prisoner he fought with uncommon bravery recovered his horse and by his valour and animating exhortations he spirited up his party rallied them frequently and brought them again to the sight to which the victory was deservedly attributed  In the sixth year of the reign of King Richard II the Scots sent forth a plun∣dering band who ravaged the forest of Inglewood sacked Penrith at the time of the fair and returned with a vast booty having gained as Hollingshead says a drove of head of cattle  In the th year of King Henry VIII's reign during Aske's rebellion Carlisle was besieged by men under the command of Musgrave and Tilby partizans in that affair but they were repulsed by the garrison and as they were retiring were intercepted by the Duke of Norfolk and his troops who took all the leaders prisoners except Musgrave those with about seventy others he ordered to im∣mediate execution and hung them on the city walls  In the th and st years of Queen Eilzabeth's reign this place suffered a dreadful visitation by the plague in which their died persons being com∣puted to be one third of the whole inhabitants It also raged in the adjacent country with a great mortality as was mentioned when we spoke of Salkeld and Penrith for the relief of the diseased poor contributions were raised for the city to the amount of l s d  In the twentieth year of the reign of King Charles I A D this place was surrendered to the parliament forces commanded by Lesley having sustained a siege and blockade from the th of October to June following during which the distress of the garrison and inhabitants was so great that the flesh of horses dogs and rats were eaten Bread was so totally exhausted that hempseed was substi∣tuted so long as any was found in the place Great assistance was given by the country when provisions could be thrown in to the amount in value of l s procured by private subscriptions On surrender honourable terms of capitula∣tion were

those in the Scotch rebellion It surrendered to the chevalier on the th of November who lay before it with his whole army The gazette account of this event said that for seven days before neither the officers nor the common men of the garrison got scarce an hour's rest being perpetually under alarms that many were so sick through their great fatigue that being out of all hopes of speedy relief they absolutely refused to hold out any longer and multitudes went off every hour over the walls some of whom fell into the hands of the rebels till the officers of several companies were at last left with three or four men so that the mayor and corpo∣ration determined to hang out a white flag though contrary to the opinion and protestation of Colonel Durand and made the best terms they could get for them∣selves that the colonel was thereupon obliged to abandon the castle not having above seventy invalids in his whole corps and most of them unfit for service the rebels threatening in case of

account of the modern state of Carlisle  THE EDITORS  The city of Carlisle the origin of which is lost in the uncertainties of antiquity stands upon a pleasing eminence which having every way a gradual descent the town is easily kept clean without the aid of a common shore Being a frontier town towards Scotland it is fortified with a wall and citadel now in ruins and a castle kept still in some sort of repair Whilst South and North Britain had each their respective king and the inhabitants of the two kingdoms lived in habits of enmity with each other Carlisle exposed to the calamities of war was often sacked and its citizens plundered and murdered Dismal times to live in The accession of the Stuart family to the crown of England somewhat abated national animosities and miseries and the union by conferring reciprocal privileges and opening a free intercourse between the two countries has obliterated invidious distinctions and con∣vinced the people on both sides the Tweed that their vicinity to each other should have induced their ancestors always to cultivate habits of amity and friendship with their neighbours  From the wall which may be ascended in different parts by flights of steps the eye is entertained with a beautiful and extensive landscape and imperceptibly led into several distant counties whilst Scotland and SolwayFrith  And the adjacent mountains some of whose summits touch the clouds  do not a little contribute to enliven the enchanting scene The city is surrounded with three rivers Petteril on the south Eden on the east and north and Caude on the west whose meandering streams are seen in many places at a great distanceA garrison was formerly kept here but there has been none for the last thirty years The military who may be stationed in the town for a time are quartered upon the public houses in the city and suburbs Carlisle has still a go∣vernor and deputy governor whose places are only  sine cures  A town major engineer barrack master storekeeper headgunner three quartergunners c When the governor of this city happened to be one of its representatives in parliament the subordinate places in the garrison were given to freemen but generally to such as were in the corporation so that frequently the  chief magistrate  was a quartergunner at the same time Thus was the invalid worn out in the service of his king and country too frequently overlooked in the disposition of this appointment  Carlisle being a bishop's see has a cathedral in which are performed the cathedral service in the same edifice is performed the parochial service of St Mary's and in a part of it the chancellor of the diocese holds the consistory court As this religious edifice is the chief ornament of the city a short description of it may perhaps not be deemed improper  The choir of this venerable pile is the most magnificent part of the building It has a stately steeple with a ring of eight bells the roof is covered with lead and being considerably higher than the other buildings in the city has a very sine effect when viewed as a distant object This noble edi∣fice being partly of Gothic and partly of Saxon architecture offers what is worthy the inspection of the architect and antiquarian Contiguous to the cathedral is an extensive churchyard the principal bury∣ing ground surrounded with a wall seven feet high in the inside of which is a row of lofty plane trees whose branches overhang a part of the adjacent street and form a shade under which is a fine paved walk much resorted to Within the precincts of the abbey besides the cathedral there are several ve∣nerable buildings which except the prebends' houses shew marks of antiquity  St Cuthbert's the other parish church in Carlisle is a modern edifice rebuilt in the year upon the site of the old church but without any kind of external or internal ornament It has a square steeple or tower but so confined as not to admit of a ring of bells so that the parishioners are called together to their devotion by the weak tinklings of the old bell which was not exchanged for one of a louder tone The steeple is decorated with a dome covered with lead from which a fane projects hav∣the year in which the church was rebuilt cut in it  Besides these two churches there are in Carlisle three Protestant dissenting meetinghouses  Dr Robert Henry was called and ordained to preach to the Presbyterian congregation in Fisherstreet Carlisle in November and continued with them years and on the th of August he became pastor of a dissenting con∣gregation in Berwick upon Tweed  one Quaker and one Methodist meetinghouse Wesley's connection  The public buildings are the Townhall Moot hall and Councilchamber conspicuously situated in the centre of the city and to which you ascend by a slight of broad steps from the promenade Above the entrance are placed the arms of the corporation Here are held the criminal and Nisi Prius courts  of Assize for the county the Quarter Sessions the Mayor's Court the election for members to repre∣sent the city in parliament c The records and writings belonging to the corporation the freemen's admissions c are kept in detached offices belonging to the same building  It is to be lamented that the houses under the Moothall are the private property of different persons to purchase these would require a deal of money The funds of the corporation are not competent for this therefore there are little hopes of ever seeing this edifice become an ornament to the city by being rebuilt upon a more useful and elegant plan  The councilchamber is ornamented with a cupola and clock The Guildhall in which the free trades hold their meetings is situate at the head of Fisherstreet and though it has the appearance of antiquity is but a very mean structure  FREE TRADES Merchants Tanners Taylors Skinners Smiths Weavers Shoemakers ButchersThe trades hold their annual meetings upon Ascensionday  The Marketcross stands at the south end of the promenade and opposite to the townhall It seems to be a modern edifice has a neat appearance but without any cover it has the corporation arms cut upon it underneath which was sculptured but of late years defaced a lion with its paw upon a large folio alluding either to magna charta or the city charter The guardhouse contiguous to the butchermarket is a very great nuisance and hurts the view of the principal streets and what renders it still more so is the corporation have granted leases and built houses adjoining to it perhaps upon the royal property Near the Englishgate are charity houses built by the corporation in which decayed freemen or the widows of those deceased are allowed to live gratis In Carlisle there is one endowed school  Rev Mr Faucet head masterRev Mr Pattison under master  There is also a charity school for cloathing and educating the daughters of poor freemen  Mrs Carlyle mistress of the charity schoolThe girls are taught to read knit and sew  The corporation of this city consists of a recorder twelve aldermen and twentyfour common council∣men  Present recorder T Garforth EsqJohn Barnes attorney at law deputy townclerk  One of the aldermen is annually chosen mayor and the other annual placemen are chosen out of the common council The subordinate officers are three serjeants at mace five bedals or town sca∣vengers The serjeants and bedals wear the corporation livery and their places are generally for life The serjeants act as bailiffs in processes before the mayor's court and to them is committed the execution of summons and writs of arrest for debt issued by it The office of the bedals is to keep the streets clean and to put in execution the punishment awarded to offenders within the mayor's jurisdiction The liberties of the corporation extend a few yards without the city walls and are ascertained by what is called the Freelidge stone with their arms sculptured upon it It may also be proper to observe that the public and private buildings belonging to the body corporate have the name of the mayor by whom and the year in which each edifice was erected sculptured on some conspicuous part so that the traveller's eye often catches these words  "Erected by Esq Mayor"  even upon a mean edifice  Carlisle about the beginning of the present century exhibited no marks of modern convenience and elegance The buildings mostly of wood clay and laths bespoke the poverty and bad taste of the in∣habitants The gabels fronted the streets the doors were generally in the centre and many of the houses had porches which projected two or three yards into the street  doubtless for warmness  The front door was arched or Gothic formed to correspond with the gabel and the diminutive windows which gave light to the inner apartments were very improperly placed but of the same order  The most of the houses did not exceed the height of one story and were chiefly covered with thatch Those of two stories had the upper rooms inlaid with strong oak and unceiled below The lanes and avenues  ven the church road were not paved and in many places entirely covered with weeds and underwood The streets not often trode upon were in many parts of them green with grass  The doors were of oak very strong and clumsy put together with large wood pins a part of which projected an inch or two from the door These pins were many in number and sometimes placed in figures romanticly irregular Houses were not then painted either within or without this being only a modern improve∣ment The streets though spacious were paved with large stones and the centre part or causeway rose to a considerable height The fronts from the houses were paved in the same manner the consequence of which was that the kennels or gutters were deep trenches and stone bridges were placed in many different parts for the convenience of passing from one side of the street to the other These gutters were the reservoirs of all kinds of filth which when a sudden heavy rain happened by stopping the conduit of the bridges inundated the streets so as to render them impassable on foot  The shambles which stood in the market place were private property and being built entirely of wood and covered with different kinds of slate gave them a very grotesque and antique appearance At the north end of the shambles was a well over which was a building placed upon pillars called Carnaby's  Folly On the front of each side of this building was the fish market the Folly and the shambles have been lately taken down the latter having been purchased at a great price by the corporation The former was their own property For this the corporation deserve the thanks of the inhabitants of Carlisle as the shambles by occupying a great part of one of the principal streets of the city were a public nuisance  Little more than half a century ago the inhabitants of Carlisle carried on no foreign commerce Their trade consisted in that of a good weekly market two annual fairs and two extraordinary well at∣tended statutes for hiring servants The annual fairs in this city formerly drew together numbers of people from many parts of England and Scotland The business for the whole year was settled at these meetings as in many places the intercourse between town and town or man and man was not yet car∣ried on by way of port carriers and other public conveyances The assize and public diversions con∣tributed greatly to draw together the neighbouring gentry Though there was very little trade and commerce in this city yet the inhabitants did not seem to know the want of it The necessaries of life were uncommonly cheap and the chief part of their wearing apparel was of their own spinning Pride and luxury in eating drinking furniture and dress had not yet made their entrance within the city walls industry and hospitality were the prominent features of the people The victuallers brewed their own ale of a good quality and sold it for threepence a quart full measure And such was the custom of the place seldom did a company call for the second pot without the landlord or landlady presenting them with the fare of the house to relish their liquor Spirituous liquors were very seldom made use of though the inhabitants were not opulent yet many of them had considerable property and for the most part under a good tenure  The principal part of the houses in Carlisle are freehold a few are leasehold under the dean and chapter and the corporation and a sew under the king  The town at the time we are speaking of was not very populous and therefore the office of mayor or chief magistrate was considered to be of great consequence He seldom appeared in public without the rod of justice and had always one of the serjeants to attend him The baleful seeds of party were not then sown among the inhabitants a friendly and neighbourly intercourse pervaded the whole city All the ancient customs were kept up with harmony and festivity and man united to man by love and good fellowship circumstanced as the inhabitants were living in the centre of a rich and well cultivated country it is no wonder if their minds were free In ages prior to this aera they had been exposed to one continued scene of warfare Under this hazardous situation it may reasonably be supposed that their contentions could not lead them to dive much into the mysteries and fluctuations attendant upon a trading intercourse And suppose they had been in affluent circumstances it cannot be imagined they would have expended their money in building Having been so long accustomed to the calamities inci∣dent to war they wished for nothing more than to enjoy that tranquility they and their ancestors had been so long strangers to  This city continued in the situation abovementioned without any material alteration either in respect to trade or improvement in building till the rebellion in Soon after this period a company of Hamburgh merchants fixed upon Carlisle as a proper place to carry on an extensive woolen manufactory  This manufactory was carried on to a very great extent in broad and plain cloths All the disserent branches of the business from the sheep shearing to the finishing the pieces were performed And as most of the work was done in various parts of the country the parishes were little affected by an increase of paupers the purvey then seldom ex∣ceeding twenty or thirty in a year This was the mode of collecting the poor rate at that time and for long after  The distance from Lincolnshire Yorkshire Scotland and those parts of the two kingdoms enriched with the staple commodity was a very inconsiderable object to this company of adventurers To faci∣litate this undertaking two gentlemen brothers of the name of Dewlicher were sent over from the continent to superintend the work This manufactory was of great importance to the inhabitants of Carlisle and the country around It brought from various parts of the three kingdoms many workmen in the different branches of the woolen trade People to the distance of twenty miles from the city were employed and every loom that could be got was engaged The most sanguine hopes were enter∣tained that the undertaking would answer the end proposed and never were two men engaged in any business more carressed by all ranks of people than the Dewlichers were A few years after this manu∣factory was established the elder brother died who had taken the most active part of the business upon himself and who from its flourishing state during his life seemed to be every way competent to so great a trust The younger brother had sometime prior to the death of the elder made a very imprudent con∣nection by marriage with the house keeper to the family  Her maiden name was Johnson  This woman was weak and ambitious and by  her was the ruin of this once flourishing manufactory brought about Having the ascendancy over her credulous husband she persuaded him to dismiss most of the old workmen who were overseers from their employment these men having been bred to the business were capable of conduting the different bran∣ches of it In their places the relations and acquaintances of the new mistress were substituted people that knew nothing of the matter Things soon began to wear a different aspect the workmen were much dissatisfied with their new masters quarrels and complaints daily increased and a very little time put a finishing hand to the whole undertaking for by mismanagement on the part of the new foremen and by the negligence and extravagance of the superintendant and his wife the company was declared insolvent and as no person or company would come forward as successors Carlisle in a very little time was reduced to the state it was in at the commencement of this manufactory  All the stock in trade as wool yarn cloth c and all the implements of the work were sold by auction at scarcely a fourth part of the value  The failure of this com∣pany was severely felt by many in Carlisle and the neighbourhood for as nothing was carried forward as a substitute to employ the industrious poor those who had been employed in the work were driven to travel with their families to different parts to seek for employment and for many months nothing but distress appeared around Carlisle for several miles  Mr Dewlicher for many years after concealed himself in some part of Scotland Some length of time after the failure of the company he once ventured in an obscure manner into the city and called late in the evening at the Wool  packinn a house much resorted to by the workmen The landlady's name who then kept the inn was Mary Carlyle This hospitable widow entertained him for several days and taking pity on his indigent circumstances she at his depar∣ture put something handsome into his pocket He never was after this seen or heard of in or about Carlisle  During the period we are speaking of provisions of all kinds were very cheap  Oats about s Carlisle bushelBarley s d doBlack and white rye s doThese two last kinds of grain were the principal bread of the inhabitants Wheat and potatoes were but little cultivated in the neighbourhood Butcher meat and fish seldom exceeded one penny farthing per pound and the former was sold by hand no weights or scales were then in use▪ Butter d halfpenny per lbEggs ten a pennyPoultry very cheapGame of all kinds were sent weekly from hence to Newcastle by packs during the seasonCarlisle bushel is three Winchester  and most of the peo∣ple's apparel continued to be of their own spinning Very little improvement had taken place in build∣ing and the streets continued in the same situation Manure was at this time of so little value that the corporation gave a man forty shillings ayear and a new cart occasionally to take it away once aweek All the goods which came to this place from Newcastle were conveyed chiefly upon packhorses the roads were impassable the greatest part of the season for any other conveyance No public works were carried on except a small manufactory for linen by an Alderman Cook and a whip manufactory under the firm of Brown and company which employed a few paupers Whips and fishhooks were the two chief articles in trade Carlisle was noted for  Brown's whipsFord's fishhooks  Great quantit es of coarse linen yarn were weekly exposed in this market for sale chiefly from the borders and Scotland where the people grew their own flax and spun it This yarn was principally purchased by country weavers or by people commissioned to buy and send it to manufacturing towns  Those who did not grow their own flax bought it undressed of the shopkeepers in the city and slax dressers went about the country from village to village and house to house to dress it  Little increase in population had hitherto taken place A few foot soldiers and artillery men kept garrison and these were quartered chiefly upon the public Carlisle at this time kept up the appearance of a formidable place centries were stationed at every gate at the commandingofficer's house the castle c and the gates were shut and locked every night with much military parade morning and evening guns were fired as a signal when to open and shut the garrison gates and pieces of ordnance were placed upon the turrets situated in different parts of the fortification  The publicans still continued to brew their own ale and most of them made their own malt  British spirits viz Brandy Gin Cinnamon and Anniseed Waters were now so plenty and cheap that there was scarcely a gingerbread stall but sold them  It had been a custom for many years backward for the corporation to demand multure by compelling the victuallers to grind the malt at their mills This began to be felt as an oppression and to remove the grievance and save the multure many of them provided small hand mills of their own The corporation irritated at this breach of what they deemed their right refused to grant licences to the refractory inn∣keepers The public however would not comply but brought an action at law to compel them to shew upon what grounds so intolerable and arbitrary a custom rested The action was determined in favour of the victuallers and this became a heavy stroke to the corporation revenue  This action which was tried at York besides the loss of their mulcture was attended with a heavy expence to the body corporate It seems the corporation did not keep a horse a bull and a boar to substantiate their right to com∣pulsive multure This the lord bishop of the diocese and the dean and chapter of Carlisle always perform at their ser∣vice mills  About the year the trade of Carlisle began to have a different appearance A manufactory of coarse linen cloth called Osnaburghs was established  The late aldermen Richard and William Hodgson were the proprietors of this Osnaburgh manufactory  this kind of work can be wrought by women and boys at the loom About the same time there arose a new woolen manufactory chiefly womens' wear the proprietor of which was a George Blamire From the time of the Dewlichers the woolen business had been almost entirely neglected in Carlisle the little which was done this way was by three brothers of the name of Machrell from Yorkshire Blamire's manufactory was of short duration and after his time except what was done by the Machrells and by one Thorpe and this to no great amount the business was no more pursued by any other adventurer  At the period we are speaking of the military road between Carlisle and Newcastle was begun Prior to this date this road from the city was by the English gate and Warwick bridge but now the route was changed and travellers go by the Scotchgate The new road was planned near four miles more to the north than the old one The badness of the road had hitherto been a great hindrance to the conveyance of merchant goods from Newcastle to this place and Whitehaven and Dumfries from this circumstance only had greatly the advantage but when this turnpike was completed then the case was much altered for the better Large carts and waggons were soon introduced and nothing was now wanting but a sufficient loading from Carlisle this want was in some sort supplied by people buying up∣on commission and others upon their own account and sending off large quantities of butter and bacon for the London market It was now that provisions began to rise in price the butchers to sell their meat by weight and the country frugal housewise to throw aside her old pound stone substituting in its place the standard of sixteen ounces for weighing her butter Every article of life increased in value in the mean time the face of the country began to wear a more cultivated aspect John Holmes Esq who had estates in different parts of the county  This gentleman kept in his own hand and improved the following valuable estates Braken or Brakenhill Bar∣rockside Barrockfield Barronling Durdar Ragmire Brackenhow Holmhill all in the neighbourhood of Carlisle beside  a very large track of ground in Abbey Holme Butter before this time was generally or ounces to the pound  was a gentleman of a persevering spirit in making trial of the several modes of agriculture no part of husbandry was lost in him for the sake of expence or procuring men used to agricultural improvements Mr Holmes' laudable spirit opened the eyes of the country in general and every succeeding year added something to the former to the advantage of the industrious husbandman It has already been observed that manure was of little value that what the streets of Carlisle assorded was conveyed away by a person who had an annual salary it now became an article of value and the produce of the streets was generally put up to lett along with the corporation lands  This article now constitutes a part of the corporation revenue being let  communibus annis  for upwards of l  The county and city tolls were a part of the corporation revenue The number of black cattle which came into England from Ireland and Scotland by the way of Cumberland and mostly by Carlisle greatly increased the value of the toll but as the collecting of it was attended with trouble and danger the drovers endeavouring to evade this toll as an imposition it also underwent a trial at law in which the drovers were defeated on the grounds that the barrier fortress was still maintained but as the collecting of this toll from these refractory people is still attended with difficulty the person who undertakes the whole farm from the corporation generally lets it out in parcells to different people who live most con∣tiguous to the places where the droves take their departure out of the county  At this period manufactories of linen and cotton began rapidly to encrease in Carlisle and this increase in the branches of spinning and weaving brought many Scotch and Irish weavers with their families to reside in the city and its environs The population of the city had encreased very little for forty or fifty years prior to the establishment of these manufactories The bleaching of yarn was a con∣sequent of these manufactories and it went on very prosperously Carlisle is a place very well adapted for carrying on the linen and cotton manufactories to a very great extent The progress of improve∣ment advanced with rapid steps Every year houses were rebuilt upon a more elegant plan and also many new ones The grass which disfigured the streets lanes and avenues began daily to disappear  In the year a brewery commenced in the suburbs of the city without the Irish Gates under the firm of Atkinson and Co But the inhabitants of Carlisle and the neighbourhood having been long accustomed to home brewed ale did not relish this factory drink so that it was sometime before this public brewery met with much encouragement though after a few years' trial the prejudice was entirely removed and the success of the undertaking has sufficiently proved its utility and fully answer∣ed the end the company had in view The many new manufactories now begun and the increase of population attendant on them raised the purvey But as this did not then seem grievous to the ancient  inhabitants I only mention it as a prelude to what afterwards became a severe burthen Not long after the streets of the city and that part of the liberties without the walls were paved upon a new plan This alteration for the better to the great credit of the corporation removed many intolerable nuisan∣ces And the inhabitants of the suburbs and that part of the suburbs which came under the direction of the surveyor of the highways were also put under a proper regulation Richardgate felt the good effects of this alteration being exposed to inundations from the overflowing of the river Eden it now felt only in part what formerly was almost general  In the year were brought here a number of French prisoners from Edinburgh castle These were soon followed by the regular troops of Thurot's squadron captured by the brave captain Elliot and about three or four hundred more were sent to Carlisle from Launceston in Cornwall All these prisoners except Thurot's regulars were upon their parole of honour As each of these prisoners had seven shillings a week regularly paid them this caused a deal of money to be expended The French prisoners were soon after followed by the Westmorland militia and as the inhabitants of that county were much prejudiced against a military life they entered into a voluntary subscription to allow their balloted men or substitutes an additional sum to the king's pay so that many of the privates had from one to three shillings per day Two companies of invalids kept garrison in the castle  The militia kept an officer's guard at Cromwell's Greenhouse  and did also duty as centinels at the several gates Such a number of men in the city and so well circumstanced as to money greatly benefited the place The consequence of this influx of wealth was the introduction of more expensive modes of living Now four wheeled carriages began to run from the different inns  Dr Waugh Dean of Worcester a coach and four horses Major Farrer kept a single horse chaise Mr Dobinson a single horse chaise General Stanwix a coach and sour horses when the family was in town which was but seldom These were all the private carriages kept in the city at this time  To this period there had not been any public conveyance for travellers in post chaise from this city Hitherto balls and assemblies had been kept in a room at the castle and when any gave a ball it was chiefly at the Bush Inn but now an assembly room is built and finished for that purpose in a plain and neat manner  The year saw new works established A company from Newcastle begun the calico printing business which has been progressively carried on ever since and affords employment to many hundreds of men women and children This was followed by an extensive manufactory carried on by the in∣genious Bernard Barton whose premature death deprived the public of the abilities of an able and enterprising tradesman These public works employed a great deal of good land about the city so that the value of ground either in the selling price or in letting rose considerably and the increase of population owing to these causes may reasonably be supposed to occasion an equal rise in every other article bought and sold  As the year was an aera of real advantage to Carlisle both with respect to the prospect of an increasing commerce and the further progress of politics the reader we hope will not deem it impro∣per that we are a little more particular The printing or stamping of Calico was introduced here about this period Gentlemen from Newcastle and its vicinity under the firm of Scot Lamb and Co were the first establishers of this branch of trade in the environs of Carlisle And as the Calico business has been the principal means of increasing the population of the city it is sufficient to remark that the flourishing advances of this manufactory induced others to form themselves into companies to begin and carry on the same business Some of them were men unacquainted with commerce for in former times a country Esq would have thought it a degradation of his rank to have his name entered with any company in a manufacturing or mercantile line Time has removed this prejudice and men are convinced that trade enriches in particular those engaged in it and the public in general Common day labour for men not bred to any mechanic trade and lint or two spinning for women in indigent circumstances was all the employment that could be obtained Eight pence or ten pence a day without victuals was as much as a labourer could earn and a woman must have worked very hard at her wheel to make a shilling a week The employment for children was winding pirns for weavers or twisting whips for which they had only about eight pence per week and generally worked sixteen hours out of the twenty∣four  The establishment of the calico manufactory greatly altered the case The work in the green or bleach∣yard found employment for men and stout boys Apprentices were taken to the several branches of the work viz Drawers Cutters and Calico printers at a genteel weekly allowance and their wages in∣creased as they advanced in their servitude Little boys were employed as tearing boys to the printers  Women had tables set out for them to pencil the colours into the pieces Every table employed three or four female children and even the youngest boys and girls could make near two shillings per week Such encouragement brought numbers of families out of the country into the city and suburbs and so great was the change that a common labourer who probably with his wife's assistance did not make above eight shillings weekly could by having his family fixed in the manner represented easily earn twenty or thirty shillings a week Nay such was the infatuation of the young men or desire of great wages that many who had served an apprenticeship to a mechanic trade bound themselves a new to the stampery and even those that were married followed the same steps persuaded that this manufactory would give the whole family bread People of property reaped their advantage from this increase of population as land and houses increased in value  The several manufactories began to thrive much beyond the most sanguine expectation People in trade with little to begin with acquired fortunes which enabled them to live in a much more splendid style than formerly The town rapidly improved and the land around increased in value far beyond what could have been foreseen The advantages however were balanced by some inconveniences people of pro∣perty who tasted not the sweets of a thriving trade began to feel the disadvantages which arose from the increase of population Before the year the poor rates were not felt by those who paid them forty purveys in a year was the annual collection This was the mode pursued and the inhabitants acted in the office of collecting by rotation But the increase of manufactories invited numbers of strangers here for bread The town was soon filled with Scotch and Irish families and as these people had no place to return to in case of indigence and sickness they became a great burthen upon the ancient inha∣bitants This was not the only grievance the mode of collection was very irregular being still by the old rate New improvements did not pay any kind of proportion nor did the manufacturers though those were the only people that throve by this increase of trade and the cause which brought these stran∣gers to the city pay any kind of rate for their valuable stocks in trade This caused a general murmur amongst the ancient inhabitants and a redress was loudly called for A pound rate was thought to be the most equitable mode and after many vestry meetings it was finally agreed to All this time neither the parish of St Mary or St Cuthbert had a common workhouse the poor were either let out or paid out in their own houses The parish of St Mary seeing the disadvantage which arose from this mode of providing for the poor entered into a subscription to build a workhouse the good effects of which have been felt by the inhabitants as well as by the poor that receive the benefit  The chief part of the manufactoring business before the year consisted of a few check and Osna∣burg looms and about a dozen of looms employed in weaving very fine linen But after the establish∣ment of the manufactory of printed or stamped calicoes cotton looms were set up The stamperies had before this been supplied with cottons from Lancashire at an extraordinary expence in carriage but now machinery for carding roving and spinning of cotton is erected in different places in the neigh∣bourhood of the city and they purchase their cottons at a cheaper rate This machinery employs a great number of men and women of old and young Buildings particularly in the environs have a∣mazingly increased and so has every trade in proportionWe shall now only paticularize the different employments  At present there are four printfields which employ about one thousand people and pay above l annually to the revenue Their firms are Messrs Lamb Scot Forster and CoMessrs Losh and Co Messrs Mitchell Ellwood and Co Messrs Donald Carrick Shaw and CoMessrs Wood and Co who employs above two hundred people in spinning of cottonMessrs Forsters have the most extensive manufactory

years after another was established near it now under the firm of Messrs Pattrickson and Co and lately Mr Daniel Pattinson erected another these three breweries pay above l duty annually and just now there is another erected by Mr Haugh There is a soapry under the firm of Messrs Barker and Langcake which pays about l duty annually when thereto is added the duties upon candles leather licences and other things under the excise Car∣lisle pays above l annual revenueBesides these public works there are many others on a smaller scale and all the common trades are carried on to great perfection  The late Mr Forster and sons established a bank here and Mr Wilson another which is of great service to trade  WAGES within these twelve months have rose much owing to the advance in all the necessaries

till Martinmas sixteen to eighteen may be sold per week and from Martinmas to Christmas thirtyfive to forty per week The rea∣son why the number increases so much in the latter period is a prevalent custom among the people in the neighbouring country of buying a quantity of beef at that season to salt and dry for the winter's useSalmon is caught in large quantities in the Eden near Carlisle it becomes in season the beginning of December but as it brings a high price in London Manchester c few purchasers are found here while it continues at about s per lb but as the season advances the prices drop because in warm weather it can∣not be sent to a distance and is there∣fore sold in the neighbourhood at about d per pound In the autumn salmon is generally cheapest when several of the middling and lower classes of people salt and dry it in that state we presume it affords a very unwholsome food tending to occasion scurvies and other impurities of the blood  FUEL is coal from

hath brought with it a manner of living heretofore unknown  An Abridgment of the Observations on the Bills of Mortality in Carlisle from the Year    to    inclusive  Of the population of the two parishes of St Mary's and St Cuthbert's Carlifle we have no account except D  Littleton's enumeration in till Dr Pleysham published his observations on the bills of mortality in the year These observations were published annually till including a period of nine years From them with the author's permission we have made this abridgment to whom we are under great obligations for this and the population of ma∣ny other parishesTHE EDITORS  THE advantages which may be derived from accurate registers of mortality are thus illustrated by an ingenious philosopher and physician  The establishment of a judicious and accurate register of the births and burials in every town and parish would be attended with the most important advantages medical political and moral By such an institution the increase or decrease of certain diseases the comparative healthiness of different situations climates and seasons the influence of particular trades and manufactures on longevity with many other curious circumstances not more interesting to physicians than beneficial to mankind would be ascertained with tolerable precision In a political view exact registers of human mortality are of still greater consequence as the number of people and progress of population in the kingdom may in the most easy and unexceptionable manner be deduced from them They are the foundation likewise of all calculations concerning the values of assurances on lives reversionary payments and of every scheme for providing annuities for widows and persons in old age In a moral light also such  Tables  are of evident utility as the increase of vice or virtue may be determined by observing the proportion which the diseases arising from luxury in∣temperance and other similar causes bear to the rest and in what particular places distempers of this class are found to be most fatal    Percival's Essays vol II  CARLISLE is situated in latitude north and is surrounded by a wall about a mile and a quarter in circumference The situation is rendered exceedingly pleasant by its vicinity to three beautiful rivers with which it is almost surrounded viz the Eden on the north east side Petteral on the south east and Caldew on the northwest The air about Carlisle is pure and dry the soil chiefly sand and clay No marshes or stagnant waters corrupt the atmosphere its neighbourhood to a branch of the sea and its due distance from the mountains on all sides render the air temperate and moderate  In July at the request of Dr Littleton Lord Bishop of Carlisle the inhabitants were numbered with great care and attention by the Rev Mr Richardson the Rev Mr Simpson and Mr Alderman Hodgson There were at that time in the city and suburbs families and inhabitants  In January a very careful and accurate survey was made by Mr Stanger and Mr Howard under my own inspection When there were in the district before surveyed houses families and inhabitantsFor a more particular account of the surveySee Tables I II III  This astonishing increase of inhabitants which is above half of the original number in the small space of seventeen years may in some measure be attributed to the establishment of manufactories  This increase of population too has taken place during that very period in which Dr Price asserts the depopulation of Great Britain to have been rapid and progressive and what makes this increase more remarkable Carlisle has during the whole period alluded to been constantly supplying the army the navy the metropolis and even the distant regions of India with her hardy active and enterprizing sons  From tables number IV V and VI we can with pleasure demonstrate the extreme salubrity of Carlisle even in a very unhealthy year a year in which no less than persons were cut off by two epidemic disorders viz the small pox and scarlet fever By the bills of mortality published in different towns in England as well as the continent it appears on an average that in Vienna about in and a half of the inhabitants die annually in London in and three quarters in Edinburgh in and four fifths in Leeds in and three fisths in Dublin in in Rome in in Amsterdam in in Breslaw in in Berlin in and a half in Northampton and Shrewsbury in and a half in Liverpool in and a half in Manchester in in Chester in but in the year when the small pox were very general and fatal in and in the parish of Sedburgh in the county of York in and a half and in Blandford Forum in Dorset in in Carlisle this year in and three ninthsSee Table VII  Tables number III V and VI are of the utmost importance to the physician the politician and the calculator of annuities and to every one who has the health and happiness of himself and family at heart They clearly demonstrate as far as one year's observation can have weight what periods of life are the most healthy what are the most obnoxious to disease  As no particular epidemic disease occurred last year which had any considerable effect on the lives of adult persons it is apprehended these calculations for the periods above ten years old will not be attend∣ed with much variation in other years  That women in general live longer than men is almost universally agreed and the following observa∣tions tend much to confirm the truth of this opinion During the last year twelve persons died between eighty and ninety years old eight of these were females and between ninety and a hundred two died both femalesSee table VI In table III we see two people are above years old and these like∣wise are females  Table II which contains the number of husbands wives c shews how inferior in number widowers are to widows There are above four widows to one widower an astonishing disproportion in what manner is it to be accounted for The following causes are conceived to operate considerably  st Men are in general more intemperate than women d They are exposed to greater hardships and dangers d Widowers perhaps in general have greater opportunities of getting wives than wi∣dows have of getting husbands th Widows have a greater propensity to live in towns than widowers  Women in general and more especially among the middle ranks of life marry earlier than men  th and lastly The constitutions of males as fitted for more violent and laborious exertions are firmer and more robust than those of females their muscular and nervous fibres may therefore be supposed to become stiff rigid and incapable of performing the functions necessary to health and life sooner than those of females both on account of their original texture and the friction which must necessarily occur from laborious exercise But from whatever causes the difference of longevity betwixt males and females may arise the fact itself is sufficiently ascertained by table VI where we find that between the ages of sixty and seventy although there are a greater number of wives than husbands yet eleven husbands and only four wives have died and of all different ages twentynine husbands and sixteen wives  During this year two epidemics raged with uncommon violence and swept off a great number of chil∣dren viz the small pox and a species of the scarlet fever  As the persons affected with the small pox were chiefly of the lower class who seldom called in medical assistance it is impossible to ascertain the precise number from the information however which I have had it appears that about were during the last six months of the year seized with the small pox in the natural way of these no less than ninety fell victims to its virulence Hence near one in three died of all that were affected with the natural small pox which while at the same time it serves as a melan∣choly proof of its fatal effects points out the great and salutary advantages which are derived from ino∣culation During the same period several hundreds were inoculated in the neighbourhood of Carlisle and it is a pleasing truth that not one of them died Had those been inoculated it is more than probable that of the ninety not above six would have died and even these not of inoculation but of other disorders Hence we see eightyfour persons might have been saved to their parents and the public Yet so great is the prejudice against the salutary practice of inoculation amongst the vulgar that  few very few can be prevailed upon either by promises rewards or intreaties to submit to the opera∣tion No wonder that in rude ignorant and barbarous times superstition hurried men into the grossest absurdities when in a polished and enlightened age in an age too when the experience of full twenty years has clearly demonstrated the utility of inoculation we see the bulk of mankind ready to sacrifice their children and all that is dear to them to a foolish prejudice  FOR THE YEAR The population of Great Britain must ever be a subject deserving the atten∣tion of every lover of his country and especially since the commencement of the present war it has be∣come highly interesting  Within these few years some very able writers have published their thoughts and calculations on this subject Those who are willing to depreciate the resources of this country and to magnify those of our enemies have endeavoured to persuade us that our situation is truly lamentable and that population has rapidly and progressively decreased for this twenty or thirty years past  The data from which these calculations and inferences have been made are principally the returns of the window surveyors and the books of the customs and excise  Others who from different sources of information have attempted to confute such sentiments have presented us with a more favourable picture they with much appearance of truth have endeavoured to prove that the number of inhabitants in Great Britain instead of decreasing has considerably increased during the period above alluded to In support of the latter hypothesis I think it may not be improper to mention the following facts  In the beginning of the year I made an actual and I believe an accurate survey of the two pa∣rishes St Mary's and St Cuthbert's and found they contained houses families and inhabitants  See last year's observations on the bills of mortality for Carlisle  A few months afterwards another actual survey was made of the two parishes by Mr Coulson general surveyor of the four northern counties for the windowtax and Mr William Monkhouse surveyor of Cumberland Leith and Eskdale wards and though I have every reason to apprehend that their survey was much more accurate than surveys for the windowtax heretofore have been yet they only returned houses the difference therefore between the real number of houses and the number returned to the windowtax is Now to shew how fallacious all calculations are with respect to the number of inhabitants in any particular place founded on the returns of the surveyors of the windowtax even when they make the most accurate survey Let us suppose I had wanted to ascertain the number of inhabitants in Carlisle and the adjoining villages and had been ignorant of the real number of houses which they contained I should have multiplied by and two thirds which is nearly the number of people in each house the product will be nearly which is less than the real number or two sevenths nearly of the whole And if I had been ignorant of the number of inhabitants in each house I should most probably have multiplied by which would have made the difference still more consi∣derable  The salubrity of Carlisle was proved by the bills of mortality published last year and it appears still more evident from the present for only in and a half nearly of all the inhabitants have died this year in consequence of diseasesSee Table VII  Table VI coroborates the observations made in the last year's bills viz that women live longer than men for between and years old two persons died who were both females husbands and only wives have died although there are a greater number of wives than husbands in Carlisle  FOR THE YEAR People of all ranks ages and conditions of life enjoyed an uncommon de∣gree of health during the first three months of this year for within that period no more than twentythree persons died and of these fifteen were either very young children or old and infirm But about the beginning of April a very epidemic fever evidently the  Typhus Carcerum  began to make its appearance It broke out in a house in Rickergate which contains about half a dozen very poor families the rooms are exceeding small and in order to diminish the windowtax every window that even poverty could dispense with was shut up hence stagnation of air which was rendered still more noxious by the filth and uncleanliness of the people The surgeon who attended some of those poor wretches told me the smell was so offensive and disagreeable that it was with difficulty he could stay in the house while he inquired into the situation of his patient One of the persons affected with the fever in this house was a weaver who on his recovary went to his usual employment at a large workshop where he communi∣cated the disorder to his fellowweavers and from thence the fever spread all over the town It however chiefly I may almost say entirely raged amongst the common and lower ranks of people and more espe∣cially amongst those who lived in narrow close confined lanes and in small crowded apartments It  affected adults more frequently than children the infirm than the robust women than men and the married were more subject to it than the single Three or four persons in a family were frequently seized with it one after another It was almost altogether confined to this place none being seized with it ever in the neighbouring villages except in a very few instances where the feeds of it were evidently carried by some persons who had laboured under the disease In the short space of about eight months near five hun∣dred persons were affected with this fever fortyeight of whom died of these one was under five years o  age two between five and ten one between ten and fifteen two between fifteen and twenty one be∣tween twenty and thirty eight between thirty and forty thirteen between forty and fitty twelve between fifty and sixty six between sixty and seventy two between seventy and eighty years  The small pox were constantly in town all this year but made little or no progress till towards th  latter end of October when they became rather more general but they could scarce ever be said to rag  as an epidemic nineteen only died No other epidemic appeared and indeed excepting the jail fever this year was by no means unhealthy Great numbers were inoculated both in the town and country villages  During the present year in and fifths of all the inhabitants have died in consequence of dis∣easesSee Table VII  The difference of the number of deaths of husbands and wives is not near so great as it was in the years and yet still the deaths of the former exceed those of the latter by two for thirty three husbands and only thirtyone wives have died which difference is not the less extraordinary than i  the two preceding years when we consider in the first place that the constitutions of women are more predisposed to be acted upon by the contagion of the Jail Fever than those of men and in the second that they are from their habits and situations in life infinitely more exposed to that contagion Between eighty and ninety years of age five males and four females and between ninety and an hundred three females have diedSee Table VI  FOR THE YEAR Upon the whole this year notwithstanding it was so extremely cold and wet cannot be considered as an unhealthy one The  Typhus Carcerum  or  Jail Fever  which raged with so much violence last year gradually declined and was scarcely to be met with after May Sixteen persons died of it  And although the small pox were constantly in town yet they were neither general nor very fatal▪ Thirty persons only died of that disease  In the beginning of June the  Catarrhus Contagiosus  or  Influenza  became general very few families either in the town or country escaping its influence It is perhaps the most contagious of all disorders to which the human body is subject and were it as fatal as it is infectious it would soon depopulate the world When it once breaks out it does not like the small pox the plague or the jail fever confine itself to a city a province or a kingdom but traverses whole continents and is sometimes wafted across the Atlantic Ocean It has raged no less than eleven or twelve times as an epidemic in Europe within the present century and pretty generally exhibits the same phoenomena yet no barrier has hitherto been discovered to arrest its progress nor have the causes which first produced it at each period been yet ascertained Fortunately however it is a very mild disease differing little from the common catarrh or cold except that the febrile symptoms are more constant and rather more severe The Influenza attacked every age sex and apparently people of every habit yet it is evident a predisposition was required as several and among the rest myself who were frequently exposed to the contagion escaped the disease In what that predisposition consists remains yet to be discovered It finished its course in the neighbour∣hood of Carlisle in about the space of three weeks or a month and its symptoms were here so mild that medical advice was seldom sought for One person only is supposed to have died of it in Carlisle viz a woman sixtyfive years of age During this year in of all the inhabitants have died in con∣sequence of diseasesSee Table VII  Hitherto the number of deaths of husbands has considerably exceeded those of wives each year but during the present year the deaths of wives somewhat exceed for twentytwo wives and only twenty husbands have diedSee Table VI  Between eighty and ninety years of age five males and nine females and between ninety and a hun∣dred one male and two females have died between a hundred and one and a hundred and two years of age one female viz a widow died during the present yearSee Table VI  In the month of August not one person died in the parish of St Cuthbert a circumstance which has not occurred these twenty years  FOR THE YEAR The present year has been much more healthy than any of the preceding years on which observations on the bills of mortality in Carlisle have been made for notwithstanding the number of inhabitants has considerably increased yet the number of deaths is by no means so great one hundred and eighty one persons only have died  No dangerous or fatal epidemic except the small pox raged with any degree of violenceThe wea∣ther during the latter end of June the whole of July and part of August was extremely hot and sultry the atmosphere was replete with the electric fluid and there was more thunder and lightening than ever was remembered even by the oldest person This state of the atmosphere was by no means peculiar to the neighbourhood of Carlisle but was pretty universal throughout Europe  In September and October the small pox became so general and were of so fatal a kind that the monthly committee of the dispens  ry were of opinion that a general inoculation of the poor and indi∣gent inhabitants would be attended with very beneficial effects Early in the month of November a ge∣neral inoculation accordingly took place Great numbers were inoculated not only by the surgeon to the dispensary but also by most of the other surgeons in the town By this salutary measure the city of Carlisle was in the space of two months totally freed from a most dangerous and fatal disorder which has been raging in different parts of the county with the utmost violence The number of persons affected with the natural small pox in Whitehaven within the last six months have been almost incredible and it is a melancholy truth that scarcely one in three survived In Wigton and its neighbourhood they have been also extremely general and fatal  Twenty nine husbands and twenty three wives have died this yearSee Table VI  Between eighty and ninety years of age four males and seven females six of whom were widows and between ninety and an hundred one male and one female have diedSee Table VI  Nineteen only fell victims to the small pox and seventeen of these were children under five years of age  A poplexies were remarkably frequent this year no less than nine persons having died of that dis∣temperThe number of deaths were remarkably equal during all the seasons fortyseven died in winter fortytwo in the spring forty five in the summer and fortyseven in autumnSee Table IV  During the present year in and th of all the inhabitants have died in consequence of diseases See Table VII  FOR THE YEAR In the observations on the bills of mortality for last year I took notice of the extreme healthiness of that season it is however with peculiar satisfaction I am able to inform the public that it has been far exceeded in salubrity by the present  One hundred and fiftyfour persons only have died which are fewer by twentyseven than died last year and in the year the number swept off by two diseases only viz the small pox and scarlet fever was nearly equal to the whole number of deaths this year whether occasioned by diseases or acci∣dents  This remarkable degree of healthiness may be accounted for from the absence of almost all epidemical disorders for not one made its appearance except the small pox which were of a very mild kind and proved fatal to no more than ten persons nine of whom were under five years of age How to account for the absence of all other epidemic and contagious diseases is not so easy  With respect to the weather I shall only remark that the present year commenced and ended with the severest and longest continued frosts ever remembered since the year The summer too was uncom∣monly cold and wet and yet was the healthiest season as may be seen by examining table IV  Whether the severity of the frost had any effect in purifying the air and hence rendering it unfavour∣able to the propagation c c of epidemical disorders perhaps may be doubted but it certainly ope∣rated most powerfully in the production of an obstinate cutaneous disease by physicians denominated Herpes but by the common people and empiries called Scurvy though it is essentially different from that disorder  This cutaneous complaint viz Herpes has been extremely prevalent and remarkably obstinate these two last winters and has appeared under a variety of forms  The number of deaths of husbands still continues to exceed that of wives and this year in a very great proportion for twenty nine husbands have died but only twenty wivesSee Table VI  Four widowers and twentyfour widows have died  Between eighty and ninety years of age four males and nine females eight of whom were widows and between ninety and an hundred one male and three females have diedSee Table VI  Hitherto the number of males born has exceeded the number of females but this year it is the reverse for males and females have been christenedSee Table VIII  During this year in and th nearly of all the inhabitants have died in consequence of diseases See Table VII  FOR THE YEAR The present year like the last was ushered in by a very severe and long con∣tinued frost There was also a considerable fall of snow and a complete thaw which was slow gradual and without rain did not take place till near the middle of April The thaw was succeeded by cold easterly winds which continued a long time and a greater degree of drought was scarcely ever remem∣bered The fields were parched the springs and rivers were almost dried up circumstances not to be wondered at when we consider that there was no rain a very few slight showers excepted from the month of October till the th of July On that day we had in the neighbourhood of Carlisle a great deal of thunder and lightning accompanied by a most violent and heavy rain and from that time till near the end of the year the weather became moist and warm  Notwithstanding this long continued drought the weather was never exceedingly hot or sultry which may probably be the reason why dangerous disorders were not more prevalent For this year was far from being unhealthy no epidemic diseases occurring but such as had arisen before the dry and warm season came on which therefore could have no effect in producing them  Very early in the month of January the jail fever which I believe first originated among the felons confined in the jail began to make its appearance in the city and continued to rage almost the whole of the year As the poorest class of inhabitants chiefly suffered from it its progress c will be best as∣certained by examining the books of the dispensary where I find four patients labouring under the dis∣order were admitted in the month of January four in February four in March three in April eight in May eight in June ten in July fifteen in August nineteen in September eleven in Octo∣ber and eleven in November In December it seems to have almost entirely ceased for not one was admitted during that month Ninetyseven patients affected with this fever were therefore admitted into the dispensary in the space of eleven months  The present epidemic was of the same nature as that which appeared at Carlisle in the year and of which I published an account It however differed in some few particulars which difference I shall briefly relate It did not rage so universally the contagion probably not being so virulent The symptoms in general were more mild Petechiae and haemorrhages were seldom observed A greater proportion of children were affected Relapses were much more frequent In the fever of I did not see one instance of a relapse whereas in the present it was a very common circum∣stance several patients having even two relapses  Of the ninetyseven patients labouring under this fever and which were admitted into the dispensary only four have died who were all in extreme danger at the time of their admission and two of them so much exhausted as not to be able almost to take any medicine viz Margaret Storey of Rickergate a married woman aged fortytwo years who died on the third day after admission and Mary Wilson of Nanson's lane a child aged three years who died two days after admission If we therefore omit these two as cases already desperate ninetyfive will remain of which only two died which is exactly one in fortyseven and one half A circumstance which strongly marks the efficacy of the practice and more especially when it is considered that almost the whole of these patients were confined during their illness in small close dirty rooms where in some cases six persons were ill at the same time and some∣times even three of them in one bed  In the whole city nine persons died of this fever  Before I conclude this part of my subject I cannot omit observing that the dispensary has expended upwards of thirty pounds for wine all of which was consumed by persons affected with this disouse  Early in the month of December the small pox were introduced by some vagrants into the Damside Irish Gates to the neighbourhood of which they were confined some time but afterwards be∣came general and continued till the latter end of July or beginning of August when they entirely ceased Eight patients affected with the natural small pox were admitted into the dispensary in the month of January eight in February two in March twentyone in April nine in May and four in July in all fiftytwo twelve of whom died Total of deaths of this disease thirtynine who were all under five years of age  As one in four and one third died of all those who were admitted into the dispensary it is highly pro∣bable that of the whole number who laboured under the natural small pox many of whom had not the least advice or assistance one in four would die which makes the number affected one hundred and fiftysix As soon as the disease made its appearance within the walls of the city the monthly committee of the dispensary resolved that a general inoculation of the poor inhabitants agreeable to the plan which  I had proposed in the year  The small pox both natural and from inoculation being now pretty general in Carlisle and likely to spread still further the monthly committee of the Carlisle Dispensary are of opinion that a general inoculation of the poor and in∣digent inhabitants will be attended with very beneficial effects  R  SOLVED st That all such persons as come recommended by a subscriber shall be inoculated gratis at the dispen∣sary  d That the sum of s d be given to the parents who are most indigent and who have three or more children inoculated as a reward for nursing them properly during inoculation  d That a subscriber of one guinea shall have the privilege of recommending three persons to be inoculated with the reward or five who do not require it and so in proportion for any larger sum  th That the privilege of being inoculated at the dispensary be continued for the space of two months and no longer  should take place at the dispensary and it was with great pleasure I observed the prejudices of the vulgar against that most salutary invention were greatly diminished For as soon as the resolution of the committee was made public by the common crier great numbers from all quarters of the town flocked to the dispensary to reap the benefits which it held out to them No less than ninety one were inoculated at the expence of the charity and rather more than that number by the different practitioners So that upon a moderate calculation the whole number inoculated this year amounted to two hundred every one of whom not only recovered but had the disease in a very favour∣able manner As we have stated it as probable that one in four died of the natural small pox it is there∣fore probable that fifty lives were saved by this general inoculation and if all those affected in the natural way had been also inoculated no less than eightynine lives would have been preserved  During this year in and th nearly of all the inhabitants have diedSee Table VII  Apoplexies and paralytic strokes were very frequent no less than eight suffered from the apoplexy  As usual the number of deaths of husbands continues to exceed that of wives twentynine husbands have died and only twentyfive wivesSee Table VI  Nine widowers and twentyone widows have died this yearSee Table VI  Persons between the ages of ten and fifteen and fifteen and twenty years have been astonishingly healthy When I made the survey of Carlisle in the beginning of the year there were between ten and fifteen seven hundred and fifteen and between fifteen and twenty years of age six hundred and seventyfive per∣sons in all one thousand three hundred and ninety Since that period the inhabitants have unquestion∣ably increased much it is therefore very probable that at present there are not less than one thousand four hundred and fifty persons between the age of ten and twenty years and yet of this number only two have diedSee Table V  The present year however seems to have been fatal to old people between eighty and ninety years of age eight males and six females five of whom were widows and between ninety and an hundred two males and four females have diedSee Table VI  The number of males born greatly exceed the number of females for males and females have been christenedSee Table VIII  FOR THE YEAR Although we had not nearly so much frost this year as the last yet in other respects the weather during the present spring and summer greatly resembled that of the year The winds which were dry and cold came chiefly from the east during the whole of the months of March April and a part of May which made the spring late and although the drought which succeeded was not of equal duration yet it was much more intense and consequently the fields exhibited the same parched and arid appearance they had done the last summer Refreshing rains fell towards the middle of July the autumn was fine and a more mild and open winter was seldom or ever remembered  There was scarcely any difference in the salubrity of the two years two hundred and four persons dying the last and two hundred and five in the present year June July and August which were the hottest months were by far the most healthy for only twentyfour persons died during that periodSee Table IV  On the contrary October November and December were the most unhealthy during which eightythree deaths occurred See Table IVThis difference however did not seem to proceed from any alteration of the atmosphere but from the measles which were introduced into the town some time in August and raged during these three months with the greatest violence  About two o'clock on Friday morning August th a slight shock of an earthquake was very sensibly felt by many persons in Carlisle and the neighbourhood Those who were perfectly awake or who hap∣pened to be out of doors report that the concussion continued about four or five seconds and that it was immediately preceded by a hollow tremulous sound Many were awakened out of their sleep by the  shaking of their houses beds doors and window shutters Birds in cages were likewise sensible of its influence and fluttered as if greatly agitated and alarmed Very providentially however little or no damage was sustained a few chimneys and old walls were here and there thrown down and three people in Whitehaven were thrown off their feet But in other respects a momentary fright and alarm were the only inconveniences which were suffered from it The concussion seemed to take its direction from the east to the west and extended quite across the island being felt both at Neweastle and Whitehaven And from the north towards the south it extended from Glasgow to the northern parts of Lancashire The atmosphere on Wednesday and Thursday preceding was moist gloomy and sultry and so much so on Thursday night that a lady who was on a visit at Dalston actually foretold when she went to bed that an earthquake would take place before morning Friday was a very clear hot calm sultry day  Early in the spring the measles made their appearance in the southwest parts of Northumberland where I am informed they proved very fatal From thence they gradually advanced farther south and the infection began to operate in Carlisle about the beginning of August and as this epidemic had not visited us since the year there must consequently have been a great number of children who were liable to be affected by the contagious matter generated by this disorder Hence the infection spread rapidly and the disease soon became general and continued to rage till the latter end of December or beginning of January when it altogether disappeared  Notwithstanding however the disorder was so very general yet its symptoms were extremely mild and favourable for of the great number who were affected I should suppose not less than six or seven hun∣dred only twentyeight died and the greater part of these were the children of the very poorest and lowest class of inhabitants who were either too ignorant or too obstinate to call in medical assistance Of the twentyeight who died twentysix were under five years of age and two were between five and ten years old  Another epidemic viz the chincough occurred pretty early in the year but this disease made little progress until October and even then did not become very general Only nine children who were all under five years of age died of it and some of those were affected with the chincough and measles at the same time and therefore probably suffered from the joint effects of both  During the present year in and ths nearly of all the inhabitants died in consequence of diseasesSee Table VII  The number of deaths of husbands still continues to exceed that of wives twentyfour husbands have died and only twentyone wivesSee Table VI  Between eighty and ninety years of age one male and five females who were all widows and between ninety and an hundred two widows have died  A man who had long been a soldier and who must consequently have been subject to many varieties and vicissitudes of life died at the advanced age of  FOR THE YEAR In the beginning of January the inhabitants of the two parishes of St Mary's and St Cuthbert's Carlisle were very accurately numbered by Mr Stanger Mr Howard and myself At that period these parishes contained males and females in all  Sometime in the year an order was issued from the court of Quarter Sessions to the different constables in the county of Cumberland to make an actual survey of all the inhabitants of the county The survey was accordingly made at Carlisle in the latter end of December but as the motives which induced the magistrates to issue this order were not generally known many gentlemen refused to give an account of their families The abbey as being extraparochial and the township of Wreay through some mistake were altogether omitted in this survey hence it is evident the lists delivered in to the Quarter Sessions are very erroneous  I however had an opportunity of examining all the returns of the above parishes very minutely and as the constables marked down the names of all those persons who refused to give them information I was enabled to make up the deficiency by procuring the numbers in each of their families and I am persuaded the enumeration is now pretty exact but if there be any error it will be on the side of defici∣ency rather than of excess  From this survey thus corrected it appears that the two parishes of St Mary's and St Cutbbert's▪ contain at present males females and consequently inhabitantsFor a more particular account see Table III  There has therefore been an increase in the space of eight years of a thousand inhabitants which is a circumstance that must give great pleasure to all those who are wellwishers to the prosperity of the city of Carlisle  From what causes it may be asked has this rapid increase arisen It affords me considerable satis∣faction to be able to inform the public that it has principally been owing to two general causes viz  The salubrity of the place and the increase of trade and manufactures  The former is clearly proved by the great excess of births above deaths for during the last eight years the period in question children have been baptized and only persons have been buried The births therefore exceed the deaths The latter viz  the increase of trade and manufactures  is proved by an ingress of inhabitants into Carlisle exceeding the emigration out of it during the same period which numbers together make up the increase of  Inoculation I am persuaded has also greatly contributed to the increase of population not only in Carlisle but likewise in the whole county of Cumberland In the year when the lower class of inhabitants were extremely averse to this salutary discovery no fewer than ninety persons died of the na∣tural small pox whereas only have died during the eight succeeding years which is upon an ave∣rage not quite nineteen in each year and yet that disorder prevailed in every one of these years See all the bills of mortality which have been published Since that period viz the prejudices of the vulgar against inoculation have greatly diminished and will soon I doubt not be totally eradicated And since the institution of the dispensary the poor have enjoyed the privilege of having their children inoculated gratis an advantage which they have in general with great readiness embraced  The first four months of the present year greatly resembled the beginning of the year The weather in both was remarkably mild and temperate for there was scarce any frost in either The com∣mon daisy was in full flower on newyear'sday and continued in blossom almost the whole year the Primrose began to blow on the st of February and the Colt'sfoot and Barren Strawberry very early in the same month in short all the early flowering plants were in full blow five or six weeks before their usual time The state of the weather however throughout the year was the reverse of and these years were remarkably hot and dry this was cold gloomy and uncommonly wet insomuch that there never was a year in which probably more rain fell than in the present  The late Dr Carlyle kept an accurate account of the quantity of rain which fell at Carlisle during a period of twenty years viz from the year to inclusive which his son the Rev Mr Chancellor Carlyle has been kind enough to communicate to me During this period the greatest quantity which fell in any one year was thirtyone inches and a few lines and the medium depth of these years was only twenty four inches eight lines and a half Unfortunately since no regular measure has been taken at Carlisle but Dr Campbell a very ingenious physician at Lancaster has sent me a table of the quantity which fell at that place during the present year and from which it appears that it amounted to the almost incredible quantity of fiftyone inches and one line The rain therefore which fell this year is considerably above double the quantity which has fallen in any one year on an average of twenty year's calculation and exceeds in quantity twenty inches what fell in the wetest of the above years It must however be observed that Lancaster is situated somewhat nearer the western ocean than Carlisle and that the hills to the east and northeast of that place are nearer it than the hills about Carlisle which in all probability will make some difference in the quantity of rain which falls at each place  Notwithstanding the very great moisture of the atmosphere above related yet the present year was a healthy one and the last six months were remarkably so seventythree persons only died during that periodSee Table IV  The small pox made their appearance in January and were in Carlisle the greatest part of the year but inoculation soon became general which prevented the disorder from raging with any great degree of violence Thirty only died twentyeight of whom were under five years of age and two between five and ten years Eightyfour were inoculated at the dispensary all of whom not only survived but had the disorder very favourably and considerable numbers were likewise inoculated by several surgeons in the town  The putrid or jail fever also prevailed almost the whole year but as it neither became general nor malignant till the beginning of I shall at present only observe that fourteen persons fell victims to it  The difference in the number of deaths of husbands and wives is this year very considerable for thirtyfour husbands have died and only twenty two wivesSee Table VI  Between eighty and ninety years of age five males and five females the latter were widows and between ninety and one hundred one male and two females have diedSee Table VI  During the present year only in nearly of all the inhabitants have died in consequence of diseases  and upon an average of the last nine years in and th has diedSee Table VII It must be re∣marked in the first place that every infectious and epidemic disease to which the human body is subject the plague excepted prevailed during this period at Carlisle and in the second place that the calcula∣tions were made for the first eight years from the number of inhabitants which existed in the beginning of the year the great increase of one thousand not being ascertained till the present year Therefore although the deaths from accidents were not taken into the account for several of the first years yet upon the whole the mortality is stated to be greater than it actually isSee Table VII  The deaths which occurred from accidents were in four in three in five in four in three in five in four in two and in two  From table VII it appears that the most healthy period of human life is from ten to fifteen years of age and that health declines in the following order viz between and and and and and and and under and and and See Table VII  Table VIII gives a connected view of all the christenings and burials from to inclusive  Dr Heysham's tables of deaths and diseases of persons of different ages are omitted as wholly apper∣taining to medical subjects  I shall conclude the observations on the bills of mortality with an account of a very curious and important circumstance in physiology which occurred at Carlisle during the present year A child was born apparent∣ly at the full time not only alive but which lived and took nourishment several days without the smallest vestige of a brain In all my reading I do not recollect to have met with so extraordinary a phenomenon nor does it appear that Professor Monro who has spent the greatest part of his time in anatomical and physiological pursuits has either seen or read of any thing exactly similar He has indeed in his inge∣nious observations on the structure and functions of the nervous system published in favoured the world with some plates which represent the heads of two children born at the full time in which the bones which generally form the top of the cranium are wanting and in which the brain which is ex∣tremely small projects like an excrescence In these two instances however there was a small portion of brain in each and though both the children are stated to have been born at the full time yet it does not appear that they were even born alive much less that they lived any time after birth for if either had been the case we cannot suppose that a gentleman of Dr Monro's great accuracy would have omitted circumstances so remarkable but I think we may on the contrary infer from his silence and from the following conclusions which he himself draws from the abovementioned monstrous productions and which I shall take the liberty of quoting as the work is not in every person's hands that they were really born dead  Nay we may perhaps go a step farther and doubt whether instead of considering the brain as the origin of the nerves we ought not to consider it merely as connected with the nerves or whether there are better reasons for supposing the brain to produce the nerves than for supposing the nerves to pro∣duce the brain Some facts at least may be here observed which seem to shew that the nerves may exist independent of the brain  I In children delivered at the full time plump and well formed in their trunk and limbs I have observed the substance which supplied the place of the brain not more bulky than a small nut and instead of containing a white medullary substance it was of a red colour resembling a clot of blood and small cords occupying the place of the optic nerves were likewise of a red colour Yet the spinal marrow and all the nerves from it had the ordinary size and appearance  II In a monstrous kitten with two bodies and the appearance of one head I found the spinal mar∣row of one of the bodies connected with a brain and cerebellum of the common shape and size But the spinal marrow of the other body though equally large had only a small button of medullary substance at its upper end without a suitable brain or cerebellum  See Monro's Observations on the Nervous System page and table VIII  An account of a Female Child which was born at Carlisle at the full Time alive and which lived five Days and twentyone Hours without the smallest appearance of a Brain  At eight o'clock on Monday morning May Mary Clarke aged years and the mother of six children some of whom are healthy and others unhealthy was delivered of a living female child at the expence of the Carlisle dispensary  The midwife shocked at the strange and unusual appearance of the child's head sent for me immedi∣ately I got there about an hour after the delivery and at first sight it appeared evident that the bones which form the upper part of the scull were wanting and that the brain was only covered by its proper membranes the  pia  and  dura mater  and resembled a large excrescence which projected a little over the common integuments especially towards the forehead where it extended over the root of the nose The colour of this substance was a dark reddish brown and upon examining it more particularly I thought I could perceive the division of the two hemispheres of the brain and likewise the division of the cerebrum from the cerebellum I gently raised with my fingers a part of it which projected over the integuments which made the child cry and produced a considerable starting similar to what is occasioned by an electric shock The child was full grown and seemed in perfect health her limbs were plump firm and well proportioned and she moved them with apparent agility The external organs of sense were also perfect She swallowed well and took a sufficient quantity of nourishment for several days but sometimes during the action of swallowing started a little She lived till five o'clock on Sunday morning June the st when she expired Some time before her death she was affected with flight convulsions During the three or four days preceding her death there was a constant discharge of a thin watery fluid somewhat tinged with blood from the excrescence which greatly diminished its bulk for at her death it was only about half the size of what it had been when she was born and the surface was in some places beginning to put on an appearance of mortification  A few hours after her death Dr Blamire and Mr Charles Farish accompanied me to the house where Dr Blamire very cautiously dissected away from the bones the whole of the substance when we found the greatest part of the frontal the temporal the occipital and the whole of the parietal bones wanting The substance removed was then carefully examined and what was our astonishment to find it entirely to consist of membranes bloodvessels but principally of several bags one of which was as large as a nutmeg the rest of different sizes but much smaller They were all filled with a brownish coloured fluid which when the cysts were punctured gushed out with some violence  There was not the least appearance of cerebrum cerebellum or any medullary substance whatever The spinal marrow had a natural appearance but did not seem to have been connected with the parts above described  Having accurately related the facts as they appeared to Dr Blamire and myself which for their singularity deserve to be recorded I think the few following obvious inferences may be drawn from them That the fluid discharged from the excrescence during the life of the infant and which produced the great dimi∣nution of its bulk was occasioned by the rupture or erosion of cysts similar to those which remained sound and full of water after death d That the living principle the nerves of the trunk and extremities sensation and motion may exist independent of and that the natural vital and animal functions may be performed without the brain And as the external organs of sense viz the eyes the nose the tongue and the ears all seemed perfect may we not therefore suppose that the optic the olfactory the gusta∣tory and the auditory nerves may exist independent of and unconnected with either the brain or spinal marrow  I content myself with little more than describing this extraordinary case and leave to others to deduce from it such conclusions as the appearances observed may be thought to warrant  FOR THE YEAR In the month of April this year a survey under the direction of the editors was made by Mr Johnston a person of accuracy and attention who found that the two parishes of St Mary and St Cuthbert contained houses families and inhabitants It therefore appears that the increase since has been and since For a more particular ac∣count of the different surveys which have been made see Tables I and III  Middlescugh and Brathwaite two small townships within the parish of St Mary but nine miles distant from Carlisle are not included in any of the surveys as the inhabitants of these townships never christen their children or bury their dead at the parish church  THE CARLISLE DISPENSARY  Was established on the st of July for administering medical relief to the sick poor of Carlisle The officers appointed for conducting this charity were  PRESIDENTThe Right Honourable the Earl of Surrey now Duke of NorsolkVice Presidents the Right Rev the Bishop of

east and west about three miles  SOIL AND PRODUCE The soil is very different in quality and fertility a sandy or gravelly loam prevails in the vicinage of Carlisle and Carleton a loam in which clay predominates is found in most other parts of these parishes particularly about Botchardby Harraby Uprightby Blackhall and most parts of the chapel of Wreay About Cumersdale a greyish soil covers a stratum of clay Towards the southern and western extremities are considerable tracts of moorish soils which not many years ago were very barren commons but which by inclosure and proper management are now generally in a pro∣gressive state of improvement  Land near Carlisle is chiefly applied to the purposes of dairying breeding and feeding sheep growing hay for horses c Wheat is the principal grain cultivated upon the best strong soils a fallow gene∣rally precedes On soils having a considerable portion of land turnips barley and clover or other artificial grasses are beginning to be much sown which is found to be a very profitable system Pota∣toes form a considerable article of cultivation in these parishes On the late inclosed commons oats is the most prevailing crop that grain also has its turn in the course of husbandry in more fertile districts as have pease and beans I am sorry to add that the barbarous and unprofitable system of taking two or more white crops in succession though yearly losing ground has yet its advocates here The great quantity of manure made at Carlisle fertilizes the soil in the neighbourhood and the crops are generally abundant Grass ground increase while that in tillage diminishes  RENT Within half a mile of Carlisle is from l to l s per acre In old inclosures and pretty good soils at a greater distance from l to about l s There are however some farms where the soil is unfertile that do not fetch above s per acre  So great is the improvement of land in these parishes that I was told ground which did not bring more than s per acre forty years ago is now let from l to l s per acre It was at that period in common field  SHEEP AND CATTLE About five hundred or six hundred sheep may be kept here which are mostly of the short legged long wooled breed The standing stocks are improving in fineness of bone and wool and inclination to feed by tups of the improved breed from the stocks of Mr Culley and other eminent sheepbreeders in Northumberland  Mr Porter of Carlisle ranks among the first who introduced that profitable breed into Cumberland and is now in possession of a valuable stock which depasture upon the Swifts Cattle are generally of the best Cumberland breeds but the cow keepers about Carlisle seem to prefer the short horned or Dutch sort some of which when properly fed afford a very great quantity of milk There are instances of some giving forty quarts per day wine measure for a few weeks after calving thirty quarts is not very uncommon and twentyfour frequent She is however esteemed a good cow that affords from sixteen to twenty quarts of milk per day for great part of the summer These cows are fed with the most luxu∣riant grass in summer hay in winter and generally grains or potatoes every day in the year The expence  of feeding is heavy but the most experienced cow keepers have found that the great secret of profit∣ing by cows is to select the best milkers either of the Dutch Lancashire or Galloway breeds and to feed them with sufficient quantities of the best food That however it must be acknowledged is a practice not much followed in most other parts of this county  RIVERS AND FISH The Eden Caldew and Petterel water these parishes These rivers abound with trout eel and other sorts of small fish common in the country In the Eden large quantities of salmon are caught The waters of Caldew and Petterel and particularly the former are remarkable for the quality of bleaching white It is rather an unpleasant reflection that these rapid streams so peculiarly adapted to the purpose of turning machinery for miles above Carlisle more particularly the Caldew and by a proper application of which that city might be rendered almost the Birmingham of the north should only be employed in giving motion to three or four solitary corn mills and a few cotton works  THE KINGGARTH FISHERY A little below Cargo is the KingGarth fishery which the corpora∣tion of Carlisle held under the charter of Edward III and having given rise to a subject of some notoriety in this part of the county a few years ago it may not be amiss here to give a short account of it  An eye draught of the  Stell Fisheries  at Kinggarth  A The main river of Eden formerly a small stream called the  Gut  or  Goat  B Where the stells crossed the river  C The ancient main course of the river where the stells were formerly placed now dried up called KingGarth  D KingGarth fishhouse  E Carbed  F CargoHolm  This fishery of the corporation being a  several fishery  extended only across the stream between Cargoholm and Carbed and so hath been lost by the river altering its course many years ago The fishery in that part of the river where the stell was lately placed belonged to Lord Lonsdale and was till lately under lease to the corporation The device for catching fish called a  Stell  used by the lessees of the corporation was a net across the water tied to stakes drove in for that purpose which caught or stopped most of the salmon it being only in high floods that any could get past it by those means the other fisheries higher up the river were become of trifling value  For remedy whereof an action was commenced in the year by the owners of those other fisheries against the lessees of the corporation upon the statute d Hen VI chap th which statute expressly prohibits the standing of nets fastened to posts continually day and night overthwart the river Thames and other rivers of the realm under the penalty of shillings for every offenceThis action came to a hearing at the assizes at Carlisle the same year before judge Buller when a verdict was given for the plaintiff and which on a new trial the year following was confirmed Since which that fishery hath been occupied by Lord Lonsdale's agents in the usual way of nets drawn by hands  It may be observed that this matter was about being brought to a legal decision about fifty years ago when the double passage in the river occasioned the difficulty of obtaining redress in regard the nets not being entirely  overthwart  the same within the description and meaning of the act  The corporation are also entitled to a  free fishery  generally called a  boat fishery  in this river which was granted by the charter of Edward IV  There are from this part of the river up to Carlisle about seventeen other boat fishings belonging to at least as many different proprietors the annual value of which are various between l and l each and upwards  ROADS Are tolerably good Two old fashioned narrow stone bridges over two branches of the Eden connect Carlisle with Stanwix Caldewgate is also connected with Carlisle by two stone bridges over as many branches of the Caldew Two roads the one from the south and the other from the east cross the Petterel and at each place there is a stone bridge The road from London to Edinburgh and that from Whitehaven to Newcastle intersect these parishes in different directions  FUEL Is chiefly coal from Tindalefell  * Since the last page was printed off we were credibly informed the number of sheep kept in these two parishes is about    GAME Are hares and partridges  QUARRIES AND BUILDINGS In these parishes are excellent freestone quarries in different places Those of most note are on the Petterel near Newbiggin and those near Durdare and BurnthwaiteNo limestone Near Quarrygate is a vein or quarry of alabaster or gypsum Buildings are generally pretty good and covered with blue or red state a few houses are yet thatched and some are even built with clay walls  TITHES A considerable part of these parishes pay tithes in kind and a portion pay a modus in lieu thereof  SCHOOL At Blackhall a donation amounting annually to l s was left by the late Thomas Lowry Esq of Blackhall for the education of seven poor children  WOODS AND PLANTATIONS The banks of Caldew are cloathed with wood principally oak some small plots of woodland appear in other parts and a few trees grow on hedgerows Several hundred acres of the most barren parts of the common when they were inclosed were planted with forest trees and chiefly Scotch fir they have succeeded beyond the expectation of every one and now not only beautify the country and shelter the farms in the neighbourhood but will ultimately prove very profitable to the proprietors Rearing of wood is the most profitable way of applying most barren soils  ASPECT AND GENERAL APPEARANCE Though this district contains many irregular but gentle swells it is as level and perhaps more so than most parts of the county the general inclination is to∣wards the north but small  The extensive vales formed by the Eden the Caldew and Petterel are level fertile and beautiful they incircle Carlisle which rises on a gentle eminence in the centre and commands a pleasant prospect of the adjacent country Among other delightful views which appear from that city the neat house gardens c of William Richardson Esq at Rickerby are seen beyond the verdant fields through which the Eden winds its way and forms an excellent object  Mr Losh of Woodside is making every thing smile round him his house his garden his farms are almost daily under his improving hands land too barren for tillage he plants with wood Between Woodside and Durdare is a tract of very poor ground divided but not inclosed nor cultivated Mr Losh has lately purchased a small part thereof for l s per acre inclosed and planted it with forest trees the other proprietors it appears have not yet discovered how much it would be to their advantage either to dispose of their shares to Mr Losh or follow his example in turning them to profit  COUNTY GAOL AT CARLISLE Is old much out of repair and without the regular means of sup∣plying the different rooms with fresh air so necessary in these wretched receptacles of guilt and misfor∣tune The celebrated Mr Howard describes it as follows  The court spacious yards by it was common to all prisoners but now a part is appropri∣ated to the felons and separated by iron palisades In the court is a chapel built as appears by the date in Five rooms for master side debtors and as many on the common side Most of the latter are large but have windows to the street Where there are so many rooms not to separate the men and women is certainly inexcusable  The wards for felons are two rooms down a step or two dark and dirty One of them the day room had a window to the street through which spirituous liquors and tools for mischief might be easily conveyed but it is now bricked up the night room is only feet by At my last visit  men  and  women  were lodged together in it  The men and women felons are now confined in separate apartments  Two rooms over the felons' wards which have been used as tap rooms seem to be intended for the  women  only  They are now appropriated to that purpose  but in  one  of these I also found  three men  and four  women  lodged together No infirmary Transports had not the allowance of two shillings and sixpence a week Clauses against spirituous liquors and act for preserving the health of prisoners not hung up Gaol delivery  once  a year Few gaols have so many convenient rooms for common side debtors It is the more remarkable here because there is  no table  signed by the magis∣trates to particularize the free wards Some gaolers avail themselves of such a circumstance and demand rent for rooms which were undoubtedly designed for common side prisoners  The furniture is provided by the prisoners and is generally wretched in the extreme Mr Mullinder the present gaoler seems however to keep the different apartments as clean and comfortable as circum∣stances will admit The rooms and passages are whitewashed once a year and the felons' rooms wholly composed of stone cleaned of all noxious matter by burning a large quantity of straw upon the floor so that disorders rarely prevail there We would however recommend a more frequent use of lime as a wash being convinced that nothing is more conducive to the prevention or eradication of infectionsThe prisoners have an opportunity of purchasing milk and vegetables every day in  great plenty No ale nor spirits are now sold in the gaol and it is much to be wished that intoxica∣ting liquors were very sparingly allowed to be brought therein  The magistrates for the county have had it in contemplation these several years to build a new goal in the castlegreen and have prepared a large quantity of stones for the purpose a situation we can∣not too much recommend but from what reason the design is not forwarded we are not informed  IMPORTATIONS AND EXPORTATIONS AT CARLISLE PORT Extracted from the custom house booksThe importations principally consist of deals
