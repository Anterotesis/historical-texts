SHILLING and SIXPENCE  TO THE INHABITANTS OF EXETER NEIGHBOURHOOD THIS TRAGEDY IS INSCRIBED BY THEIR HUMBLE SERVANT THE AUTHOR  PROLOGUE  WHEREE'ER Mankind to sacred freedom just  Have soar'd above the groveling Sons of dust  Wheree'er the Arts their fragrant wreathes have wove  Wheree'er the virtues leagued with Patriot love  And brighteyed Science shed her heavenly dews  There public taste hath nursed the Tragic Muse  And Reason to her generous care consign'd  The noblest best emotions of the mind  'Tis her's where human institutes are weak  With firm unbiast emphasis to speak  With genuine nature link persuasive art  And bind in magic ties the willing heart  She gives to view the Tyrant's naked breast  What guilt disturbs him and what fears insest  She with abhorrence marks the Traitor's name  And cloaths Ambition in the robes of Shame  Depresses Cruelty and rears on high  The standard of Imperial liberty  Is Innocence by rigour stern subdued  She steels her soul with conscious fortitude  Bids her above this fordid earth to rise  And claim alliance with her native skies  Who then by partial error led astray  With hasty censure brands the Tragic lay  The glorious strains which polish'd Athens taught  Refining and exalting human thought  When Sages praised the Poet's moral pen  And listening Heroes felt that they were Men  What true desert is their's at Virtue's call  Who make th' obedient passions rise or fall  Who in her Temple bid Mankind appear  Breathe the warm sigh and drop the hallow'd tear  For when by idcot laughter unpossest  She gentle Goddess seeks the soften'd breast  From grief itself a nameless pleasure flows  And pity loves to melt at fancied woes  Not through Antiquity's obscurer ways  To climes remote our British Author strays  Not from th' Italian or the French translates  Alters old plots or even imitates  From your own Annals he his story draws  Tradition long hath crown'd it with applause  When the fierce Danes their barbarous inroads plann'd  And pour'd destruction o'er each harrast land  When they besieged these Walls and hoped to win  Nor knew superior valour dwelt within  Till the bold Citizens assail'd their Host  And drove th' insulting Miscreants from their Coast  Thus for their Country dared your Sires to bleed  Nor have their Sons disgraced the gallant deed  Courageous now as when they quell'd the Dane  Still faithful loyal generous and humane  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  VOLNIR  EDRERED  RODOLPH  ALBERT  OSWY  BRITHRIC or SIGEBERT  CITIZENS DANISH CAPTAINS c  GUNHILDA  EDITHA  SCENE EXETER and the adjacent Country  EDITHA A TRAGEDY  ACT I  SCENE I  A  CAMP  At some distance the  CASTLE  and  CITY  of  EXETER  VOLNIR BRITHRIC  VOLNIR  SHALL not this City fall beneath my power  What magic buckler guards it To my arms  The puny Offspring of this seagirt land  Have yielded wheresoe'er I fought My ships  Beneath their treasures bend The ravaged coast  Hence to the farthest Orcades laments  Her slaughter'd Chiefs and desolated towns  What say'st thou Englishman Our first assault  Hath proved in vain will they withstand another  BRITHRIC  No doubt they will In native courage bold  The warlike Sons of Isca ne'er will droop  By sudden fear o'ercome To conquer them  Patience with ardent valour must be joined  Nor will they yield till closed within the net  Of extreme fate and dire necessity  VOLNIR  How dost thou know their character so well  I thought thou told'st me thou wert born far off  Upon the banks of Trent  BRITHRIC  I told thee true  But who within these confines is a stranger  To the Damnonian fame Their worth in arms  Even their foes confess Before these walls  For two long tedious months did Sweno mourn  Illustrious Monarch and with shame and rage  Beheld his blasted laurels Nor at length  But by a Norman traitor gain'd the place  Ignobly gain'd it Why O illadvised  Would'st thou sit down before it  VOLNIR  Brithric hold  No more with thy illomen'd notes presume  T' infest my ear Hast thou forgot old man  When first I saw thee in thy boarded ship  The sad survivor of thy vanquish'd crew  Cover'd with wounds When I preserv'd thy life  And made my foe my friend For Volnir ne'er  After the rage of fight could plunge his sword  In the unguarded bosom of the brave  BRITHRIC  No Volnir I can ne'er forget that day  VOLNIR  Thou hast forgot it else why interpose  These frigid cautions Hast thou e'er with arm  Or counsels aided me since first I urg'd  The tide of war against the Anglian shore  Now by my sword I swear when I have gain'd  Some glorious victory these eyes have seen  Thy cheek bedew'd with tears  BRITHRIC  And say could'st thou  View Ruin with gigantic stride pass o'er  Thy Denmark's breast unmov'd No surely no  In other realms thou hast not seen these feet  Behind thee linger my victorious arm  Gothland hath witness'd and the Frank the Scot  Oft fled before the lightning of my spear  These were my enemies as well as thine  But can a private tye e'en gratitude  Strongest of all make me forget the love  I owe my country Perish then this arm  May these white locks unseemly strew the dust  When my advice shall prompt or hands dare execu  A guilty deed against my native soil  VOLNIR  Why hath thy native soil ne'er paid thy ransom  For well I know thou art not of the race  Of common men  BRITHRIC  Why ask of me a question  Thou best can'st answer Would'st thou have permitted  A messenger from me to seek my friends  Long long e'er now my ransom had been paid  Thou know'st tho' pleased the more enlighten'd manners  And customs of wellregulated States  By my instructions taught t' exalt me high  Amid thy Warriors Conqueror as thou art  Thou know'st I have not willingly forsaken  Those I held dear I left my soul's best portion  A valued Wife a young and growing Daughter  An infant Son I left Could I forget  In splendid slavery these tender names  For life I am thy Debtor and have serv'd  In other wars most faithfully But still  Affection wrings my heart and liberty  Is unpossess'd tho' I without a boast  Might claim it as my due  VOLNIR  Go join the foe  Hence murmurer to the city and betray  Me and my army  BRITHRIC  Volnir no I scorn  The paths of baseness Prisoner to thee  Unransom'd never will I quit thy camp  SCENE II  Enter  RODOLPH  with  EDITHA  and other  PRISONERS  VOLNIR  Welcome brave Rodolph Hast thou well explor'd  The country toward the North  RODOLPH  I have No foe  Dares stand against us terrorstruck they fly  And leave to us their numerous herds and flocks  I traced yon winding stream for many a mile  Through it's luxuriant vale fit haunt for Gods  Unlike our blasted heaths here Plenty dwells  Clad in her richest robes Could we possess  The City with this scene before our view  Here might we fix our home and each nerve strung  With double vigour brave the utmost force  Of the whole adverse Isle A region this  Worthy of none but Denmark's valiant race  Bear off these Prisoners To my Tent conduct  This trembling fair One Fear not gentle Damsel  Rodolph is thy Protector  VOLNIR  Stay awhile  Whence is that beauteous Maid  RODOLPH  A votaress She  Immur'd within a neighbouring abbeys walls  We burst the gate and took her thence by force  VOLNIR  Enough Retire    Exeunt  Editha c  Rodolph it ill becomes  A soldier in the clamorous field of war  To sigh at Beauty's feet 'Tis our's to teach  The eager sword to bite the crested helm  To call the hawks of Heaven and bid them mark  The joys of fight to drench the ground in blood  Nor 'till return'd from war to take the Maid  Or blooming Widow to our wish'd embrace  RODOLPH  Fear not my Chief guarded with sacred care  She dwells secure 'till placed within my ship  A matchless prize  VOLNIR  So shall thy Chief applaud thee  Now hear what we have purposed Be it thine  To head a daring Band by me selected  And when the moon dips in the cave of night  Her silver brow to scale with silent step  Yon castle walls myself will on the city  Pour my whole force and with incessant storm  Facilitate thy enterprize  RODOLPH  My thoughts  Accord with thine Plan thou each arduous deed  And let this heart the bold designs fulfill    Exit  SCENE III  VOLNIR BRITHRIC  VOLNIR  Mark'd you the Virgin  BRITHRIC  I observed her well  Her modesty her air above the vulgar  Her unaffected silent look of woe  With strange emotions fill'd my heart I pity her  VOLNIR  Her fate is to be envied Rodolph's valour  Deserves the fairest Where can beauty feel  True pleasure but when clasp'd in the embrace  Of the intrepid warrior  BRITHRIC  Tender mourner  Who knows her grief Her sad anxiety  Torn from her Friends Perhaps an aged Father  Now beats his breast and curses in despair  The cruel hand of Fate A frantic Mother  Perhaps now breathes her last in anguish wild  Calling in vain upon her muchloved Daughter  VOLNIR  I blush to hear this weakness glad am I  None of my noble Danes are witnesses  To this thy folly but if thou regard'st  My anger dare not with inglorious wailings  Disgrace my camp War is no school of pity  Nor would I that the spirits of my followers  Rough and invincible be e'er degraded  To the soft failings of the silken Crew  O'er whom they triumph Why is strength imparted  Why the heroic soul but from the base  Unmanly grasp of cowards those possessions  They merit not to wrest Riches and beauty  The harvest of their labours  BRITHRIC  Is it then  Denied to feel for the afflicted  VOLNIR  No  But rule thy feelings like a man support  Thy nature's frailty feed on grief in secret    Exit    BRITHRIC  O curse to bear a mind whence sweet humanity  By barbarous custom is exiled To know  No virtue but ferocious brutal courage  Yet is this Chief superior to his race  And education which hath steel'd his soul  To gentle pity hath not quite erased  The native sense of rectitude He spared  My life and loved a valour like his own  The thoughts of this poor Virgin still distress me  Such is my Daughter's ageBut she's far distant  It cannot beAnd yet her Mother's features  Rose to my mind'Tis but the sport of fancy  Oh could I but once more behold my Children  I then could die in peaceBut who can tell  Whether some other band of these invaders  May not have slain or hurried them away  To sad captivity Perhaps I mourn  The absence of the dead or dead to me  Who never must behold them doom'd to waste  My days in misery and die a slave  Enter  RODOLPH  BRITHRIC  Hast thou so soon left thy fair Prisoner  RODOLPH  New to misfortune is the Maid her sorrow  Resists all arguments persuasion fails  Nor will she hear a word of soothing comfort  She will be calm anon These warmer passions  Soonest abate Yet 'twas a scene of terror  From whence I snatch'd her for the foolish crew  Their gates had barricadoed which provoked  My gallant band to deeds of vengeance All  But she and one whom at a postern door  A youth bore off upon his rapid steed  Fell victims to the keen relentless sword  BRITHRIC  Whence were the other Captives  RODOLPH  They were taken  From neighbouring villages the soldier's plunder  To them by lot distributed  BRITHRIC  Would'st thou  Should I request it suffer me to visit  This Captive in thy Tent  RODOLPH  Hah dost thou know  What 'tis thou ask'st  BRITHRIC  I do Thou would'st be willing  To dry her tears  RODOLPH  I would  BRITHRIC  'Tis for that purpose  I ask an interview I am her Countryman  And should I to her ear unfold thy worth  Thy excellence above the other Chiefs  Make her of that good fortune sensible  Which 'mid her depth of woe to thy possession  Devoted her may not her mind be moved  Sooth'd by the cheering speech of honest age  And cast anxiety aside  RODOLPH  I'll trust thee  Thy snowy head proclaims that in thy breast  The flame of warm desire's long since extinct  Go Brithric I would bend her to my wishes  But not reluctantly The sickly appetite  Of impotence may provocation need  In cold resistance but my glowing soul  Seeks equal passion and the yielding fair  To bless must covet blessingHence away  I wait on Volnir He hath now demanded  Once more a parley and the haughty Albert  Exonia's Praefect to our Camp draws nigh    Exit    BRITHRIC  Protect these towers kind Heaven Tho' for the sins  Of guilty nations for a time these robbers  Bear thy vindictive scourge yet teach mankind  At length that sacrilege and cruelty  Will draw the terrors of thy justice down  That Mercy is thy darling attribute  And thy arm bared to punish not destroy  ACT II  SCENE I  VOLNIR's  Tent  VOLNIR  and his  CAPTAINS  VOLNIR  Once more my noble friends who chose me willingly  Your leader in this war I mean to try  Whether by mild persuasion or by threats  This Albert may be shaken For tho' frankly  You rush amid the tempest of the fight  To you not dreadful and pour forth your blood  As well becomes the brave yet do ye know  To relish life and all its genuine pleasures  For this we leave our barren rocks to tear  From the luxurious arms of battening sloth  Its wealth superfluous and its gorgeous robes  Rich gems and spur to every great design  The loveexciting Fair Nor would I rashly  When dire necessity impels not urge  Your feet to dangers fatal pathsShould Albert  Depending on its strength refuse to yield  This wellgirt city He like other Foes  May buy our absence dearly and bring forth  The boarded gold and precious moveables  Which the affrighted Citizens shall give  With pleasure while we seek our native land  With ships fullfraught bearing a treasure thither  Greater than Denmark ever saw before  CAPTAIN  Conscious of thy superiour worth we trust  To thee our interest in the sanguine field  Or mazy treaty stedfast to pursue  The path where Volnir or where Wisdom leads  Enter  RODOLPH  with  ALBERT  RODOLPH  The Praefect Albert  VOLNIR  He does well t' obey  Our summonsAlbert welcome  ALBERT  Think not Dane  Tho' proud thy speech that Albert's acts are govern'd  But by his own free will 'Tis true I come  And by thy message prompted but expecting  No lordly looks to see to hear no terms  Of insult from a foe we need not dread  Our bulwarks laugh to scorn thy utmost force  Guarded by men prepared as thou hast found  Buried beneath their ruins to expire  E'er stain their souls with infamy I come  Urged by an impulse to thy breast unknown  That of humanity To bid thee fly  For vengeance is at hand to bid thee spare  The streams of blood which fate prepares to pour  Over these verdant fields For tho' revenge  Inspires tho' to the ravages of war  You join fell cruelty tho' smoaking villages  Women and children murder'd well might steel  To dire retaliation all our hearts  Yet dear is every Citizen to me  These eyes have seen enough of death already  This hour is thine retire the next is our's  And thy retreat cut off one general ruin  Involves you all  VOLNIR  Albert I love thy boldness  A foe thou art worthy a son of Denmark  To cope withal But hast thou mark'd our camp  And warlike preparation Think not vainly  Thou can'st escape destruction Flush'd with conquest  In every country from the frozen sea  To this delightful region nought avails  Thy bravery against us Yonder walls  Already totter to their deepset base  Consult then this humanity of thine  Open the gates so shalt thou save the lives  Of thy devoted Citizens and taste  Our amplest clemency  ALBERT  Whence hast thou gain'd  This confidence audacious man Because  So spiritless was our defence when lately  We beat thee from our ramparts When thy bravest  Fell at our feet in death And the remainder  To their intrenchments fled Can this have taught thee  To boast To threatenBy th' Inhabitants  Of this one town alone thus roughly treated  When the collected force of Devon bursts  In thunder on thee as e'er long it will  Thy Ravens wing whose plumes already moult  Shall rise no more but in the dust be trod  Scorn'd by the meanest Peasant of our Isle  VOLNIR  So rashly warm  ALBERT  So reasonably bold  VOLNIR  To cease this idle play of language vain  And foreign to our purpose Should we quit  These girded walls devoted to our will  Your Citizens are rich say with what sum  Will they their freedom and their lives redeem  ALBERT  Perish the thought Were our streets paved with gold  Expect not Dane from us the shining treasure  For thee we hoard up nought but steel to which  Thou art right welcome  VOLNIR  Be it soBut Albert  When ruin enters o'er yon towers when horror  And fell destruction riot in your streets  Accuse not us of cruelty the obstinate  Urge their own fate our consciences are free  ALBERT  We will acquit thee Dane till then farewell    Exit    VOLNIR  Prepare my Friends From this determined man  Expect no common shock Each to his post  Yet hath our steady and unshaken valour  Met greater dangers than his utmost power  Can bring in opposition and with ease  Subdued them all Only resolve to conquer  And you're already Conquerors    Exeunt    SCENE II  RODOLPH's  Tent  EDITHA  O state of horror Worse than death itself  Yes I would die with pleasure to the sword  Submit my neck or run to meet the blow  But save me spotless Heaven Say who art thou    Enter  Brithric  BRITHRIC  A Friend a Countryman by Rodolph sent  EDITHA  Rodolph detested name  BRITHRIC  And why detested  Thou art a stranger to his worth his love  EDITHA  'Tis monstrous Name it not Said'st thou his love  Thou can'st not mean it  BRITHRIC  Calm these transports Virgin  And hear me plead his cause  EDITHA  I will not hear thee  'Tis poison to mine ears Dishonest Englishman  Leave me hence to the robber who employed thee  Fittest society  BRITHRIC  Impassion'd thus  I will not leave thee Bred up in prosperity  Thou hast not tasted misery's sad cup  And therefore view'st thy lot with double anguish  But time with lenient hand will soothe thy grief  And teach thee to repay with gratitude  The care the love the warm desires of Rodolph  EDITHA  Hast thou outlived thy feelings Or art thou  A willing slave A traitor to thy country  Or wert thou forced upon this odious task  Thou know'st me notI pity and forgive thee  BRITHRIC  Yet if resentment for thy Country's wrongs  Or thy own injuries if the esteem  Of honour and the innate love of virtue  Permit thee not to yield try what thou can'st  To gain forbearance try dissimulation  To feign for honest purposes is lawful  He will submit and lucky opportunity  Perhaps will crown thy wisdom  EDITHA  Base adviser  Close thy unhallow'd lips When thee I violate  O pure Sincerity O holy Truth  When I shall cease thy mandates to adore  May ignominy be my portion here  And Heaven refuse me happiness hereafter  Of all the vices which my soul abhors  There's none whose dire communion I would shun  Like vile deceit to every other crime  It forms a path till the whole breast becomes  A storehouse of pollutionAs for thee  Whose abject mind is suited to thy station  Hence from my sight and torture me no more  For know I want no counsel but my own  BRITHRIC  How I admire this warmth    aside    O gentle Maid  Whose anger in so just a cause delights  The heart attuned in unison with thine  Excuse an old man's policy who looks  With tenderest sympathy on thy affliction  Who wish'd to prove if thy interior graces  Equal'd thy outward charms Who knows thy danger  And would pour forth his blood to give thee safety  For thou art likeO Heaven  EDITHA  Can I believe  This sudden change Thy face indeed is honest  And those white hairs of age claim reverence  The tear too wets thy cheekBut why suspect me  Thy trial shews thou did'st Can with Integrity  Suspicion dwell So odious a companion  BRITHRIC  'Twas not suspicion I disclaim its weakness  'Twas chance 'twas curiosity desire  To have thee higher rise in my esteem  'Twas any thing but a design to injure  Thy purity of soul When first I saw thee  Methought my heart was link'd to thine I vow'd  To do thee service but alas what service  Can I a wretched prisoner afford  I may lament but cannot rescue thee  EDITHA  O Edred where art thou O Bertha Bertha  BRITHRIC  What said'st thou What  EDITHA  Whence is this wild emotion  Why dost thou fix thy eyes and gaze thus on me  BRITHRIC  Did'st thou not mention Edred  EDITHA  What of him  BRITHRIC  And Bertha too  EDITHA  I did  BRITHRIC  Are they thy Friends  EDITHA  My Mother and my Brother  BRITHRIC  And thy name  EDITHA  Is Editha  BRITHRIC  Thy Father  EDITHA  Was Earl Sigebert  BRITHRIC  I I am he O Editha my Child  I am thy longlost Father I am Sigebert  EDITHA  My Father Is it possible My Father  BRITHRIC  I am indeed Oh I am wild with joy  EDITHA  And shall I know the blessing of a Father  BRITHRIC  Thou shalt thou shalt Oh not the light itself  Not the warm blood which gives me motion sense  Shall be so dear to me I thought I saw  The features of my Bertha O my Child  My lovely EdithaBut in this place  And in this Rodolph's power Ye Angels stoop  Stoop on your wings of grace and save my Child  Where is that best of women Where is Bertha  And where thy Brother Are they not in Mercia  By what strange mystery art thou prisoner here  EDITHA  O my dear Father to pronounce that name  Thrills my whole soul with pleasure Edred's valour  And youthful merit won the royal favour  Of our great master Ethelred Another  Possesses thy inheritance to him  He gave domains which far exceeded thine  Here in the bounds of Devon ample rights  Forests and large command Thy sad misfortune  Was in this grateful bounty not forgotten  For long we've thought thee dead unnumber'd tears  Hath Bertha pour'd and still the painful sigh  Oft swells her bosom When she heard thy ship  Was by a tempest sever'd from the rest  She fear'd the greedy waves had swallow'd it  And mourn'd in bitterest woe her husbands death  BRITHRIC  Oh had it not been sever'd Denmark's Sons  Had not so long spread ruin o'er my country  I had not yielded to this Danish Chief  Oppress'd by numbers nor with him dragg'd out  Eighteen long years of tedious servitude  Nor had the Father and the Daughter thus  Met helpless captives But where is She now  And where my Son  EDITHA  This morn when last I saw them  Oh thou recall'st the dreadful scene of blood  The horrid massacre Within that sanctuary  Had Bertha and myself retired for safety  When at one gate the Foe demanded entrance  We heard the voice of Edred at the other  Either by chance or fearing their intent  He came but unattended strait he placed  My Mother on his courser and outstripp'd  The winds for her deliverance  BRITHRIC  Noble Youth  EDITHA  By this no doubt he hath regain'd the city  Where with his houshold train in deeds of danger  He is the foremost and encourages  The most remiss to action  BRITHRIC  O my Daughter  Grief mingles with my joyPreserve him Heaven  And lead him on to victoryFor thee  I weep my Editha Ah what avails it  That thou wert snatch'd from slaughter if thou now  Must be exposed to savage violation  EDITHA  Let us not murmur That almighty power  Who saved me there as by a miracle  Can here support me  BRITHRIC  In that power I trust  But I must guard thee with a Father's love  And dangerous is the path I shall pursue  I'll hence to Volnir in whose breast I claim  Some share of confidence to him disclose  Rodolph's instructions his design on thee  I will enlarge on his inglorious passion  So strict his discipline he will I know  Divide you till they reembark Meantime  I may devise some other plan to save thee  EDITHA  To thee and Heaven do I commit myself  BRITHRIC  Farewell my Child I could almost persuade  My old fond heart that innocence like thine  Might melt the most relentless son of Denmark  To soft humanityFarewell Farewell    Exit    EDITHA  Farewell May alloverwatching Providence  Assist thy pious care and shield thy Daughter  Enter  RODOLPH  RODOLPH  Once more my beauteous Captive e'er I plunge  Amid the storm of war I come to hear  More gentle accents from thy mouth to meet  More gentle glances from thy eyesHath Brithric  My Friend thy ancient Countryman been with thee  EDITHA  He hath  RODOLPH  Thou view'st me with the look of scorn  And his persuasions have not overcome  That stubborn heart  EDITHA  Away I would reproach thee  But sentiments like mine will prompt a language  Thou can'st not understand  RODOLPH  Hah Do'st thou know  My power o'er thee is absolute  EDITHA  I know it  To wounds to accidents to violence  This outward frame is subject but the mind  Enjoys her glorious freedom uncontroul'd  RODOLPH  Nor have I hurt that mind tho' privileged  By war and conquest  EDITHA  Rather say by sacrilege  Rapine and cruelty All other nations  Respect the Matron and the hoary Sire  Melt at the Virgin's and the Infant's tear  Thy savage race intent on ruthless slaughter  Heeds none of these nor can the holiest places  Protect them from their fury Like the Tiger  Which loves to swim in blood and tears the flock  Tho' gorged with food in frantic wantonness  RODOLPH  What treatment can a foe expect but death  Or slavery from a foe We have not yet  Enervated our minds by southern manners  Nursed in the arms of war I love the fight  The whizzing arrow and the flying spear  The clang of shields and tempest of the field  To love my Country and to hate my Enemy  Be mine What virtue can exalt the soul  Of man but courage  EDITHA  Mercy and compassion  Which bind a wreathe around the Warriors helm  And lead his footsteps in the paths of glory  RODOLPH  And guard him doubtless in the day of battle  By these your Englishmen have fought so bravely  And with resistless ardour stopp'd our course  Such virtues ever may my foes possess  EDITHA  O blind to truth Uncivilized Barbarian  With what disdain the polish'd soul beholds  The man who sinks himself beneath the brutes  RODOLPH  No more Thou wilt perchance repent this pride  EDITHA  No I despise thee from a nobler motive  I soar above thee conscious of a dignity  Thy heart ne'er felt the dignity of virtue  RODOLPH  That be thy solace here I go to execute  My Chief's commands The moon hath left the Heavens  The clouds of night hang o'er the sleeping city  And lull it to its fate Tho' cloath'd with beauty  Excelling all my eyes have seen before  Yet think not I shall soothe and fawn and kneel  For favours in my powerThou art my Captive  EDITHA  But am thy Captive only while I please  Think'st thou I prize my life beyond my honour  RODOLPH  The words of many a Fair who to enhance  The boon would make it difficult to win  So far I've been thy Lover when I next  Return with victory expect thy Master    Exit    EDITHA  A Slave A MasterYet I could submit  To the most humble servile offices  With innocence companion of my toil  If my own heart reproach'd me not nor shame  Sat kindling on my cheekAnd could I leave  My native Country Leave my Friends My Brother  A Mother who her being wrapt in mine  Lives but in me O my dear longlost Father  So lately found Save save me from the thought  Yet what can'st thou A slave to these Barbarians  A wretched slaveOh never shall I see  My Parents meet a witness to their joy  I shall not tend their age and smooth its cares  Or drop the pious tear upon their grave  Who knows my future fateMy soul shrinks back  Nor through the horrid gloom dares penetrate  O thou Supreme o'er all To whom I bend  With humblest duty let thy power be shewn  Confound tyrannic force Support the weak  And from afflictions soul remove despair  SCENE III  The  CITY  ALBERT  and  CITIZENS  ALBERT  The time requires our strictest vigilance  Is the watch doubled Hast thou visited  Each quarter of the ramparts  CITIZEN  I have  ALBERT  Protected by our walls and more  By love of liberty by brave disdain  And hatred t'ward our unrelenting foes  We need not fearThis bold Adventurer  Equal to Swein in bravery and conduct  Whose fame in arms hath call'd forth Denmark's Sons  By choice to follow his unfolded standard  Shall with his numerous host or starve beneath  Our unscaled mounds or seek their ships with shame  If as I trust you will with steady valour  You guard your native city if your deeds  Answer in future to your last days actions  And lo where comes our succour and support  Heroic EdredNoble Youth right welcome  Thou hast succeeded in thy enterprize  EDRED  In part and but in partAlas my Friend  What we this morning dreaded is complete  Th' inhuman Dane no holy place reveres  The abbey is despoil'd the virgin train  Murder'd Assisted by the hand of Heaven  Bertha is savedBut Oh My noble Sister  How cruel is her fate A prisoner  To these Barbarians Seeing them retreat  I turn'd my steps and sought among the slain  She was not to be foundI have not time  To tell thee all for as with stealthy pace  Skreen'd by the gloom of night thro' secret paths  The careful foe I shunn'd methought I heard  A sound confused of feet and murmuring voices  And strait the glimpse of armour caught my eye  Some action is on foot they seem'd to me  As winding t'ward the Castle  ALBERT  Let them come  They steal not on a sleeping enemy  We are prepared and as a lofty rock  Beats back the furious waves which rage in vain  So shall before our wellmann'd battlements  These ravagers retireI see thy grief  Thou gallant Youth and for thy hapless Sister  Feel similar emotions to thy own  The lovely Editha all hearts confess  Unparagon'd in beauty and in virtue  EDRED  Oh witness Heaven no common love I bore her  No Brother ever better loved a Sister  And she deserved my loveHer active soul  Soaring above the weakness of her sex  My younger spirit raised to glorious daring  When but a Boy she to my listening ear  Taught all the martial deeds of my great Ancestors  She set before my eye my Father's virtues  Whose early death my Mother ever mourns  And bade me tread like them the paths of fame  If aught within this breast transcends the vulgar  To her the debt is due the generous fire  By her was kindled  ALBERT  'Twas unfortunate  EDRED  Oh it was greatly so That they should think  The ties of faith would check those lawless robbers  That I should suffer them to put in practice  So idle a resolve Exposed to danger  When here with us they might have dwelt in safety  For what is sacred to the Danish race  They spare not hoary age nor innocence  Within its Mother's clasping arms inshrined  Nor e'en religion at the hallow'd altar  ALBERT  Would I could comfort thee  EDRED  That wish is vain  Nor seek I any comfort but revenge  Join with me there my Friend Let us this instant  Pour forth the tide of fury on their camp  My eager sword is thirsty for revenge  The holy Virgins weltering in their blood  My ravish'd Sister's wrongs now urge me on  String all my nerves and fill my soul with ardour  ALBERT  Thou hast forgot thy tidingsBut whate'er  Shall happen all is ready for defence  Or vigorous onset by e  ch public motive  And private sentiment impell'd this arm  Shall join with thine in boldest enterprize  And deep upon the Danish crests inscribe  In bloody characters the holy compact  But much I wonder Oswy with his powers  Is not as yet arrived this morn he sent  A messenger who told me e'er the sun  Set in the West we should behold his camp  Pitch'd on the neighbouringhills with hasty march  He from the bounds of Tamar to our aid  Approaches  EDRED  Never did my heart esteem  That Lord in words most fierce in action cold  Of crafty and designing nature he  A slave to avarice and inherent baseness  ALBERT  He hath a beauteous Daughter  EDRED  True he hath  Gunhilda With an ample dower to me  He would have given the Maid but underneath  The veil of fairest semblance I beheld  A soul too like her Father's and refused her  Since which enraged they ever have pursued me  With base insidious hate which I despise    A Trumpet sounds    ALBERT  The signal of alarm    Enter a  Citizen  CITIZEN  Our scouts inform us  A party of the foe in deepest silence  Is climbing the ascent toward the Castle  Another party to the Eastern gate  With rapid haste advances  ALBERT  This my Edred  This is the wish'dfor hour the hour of glory  She holds her prize aloft and animates  The chosen breast with tenfold intrepidity  The Castle be thy care we guard the gate  And now my Friend the

where was Rodolph's matchless valour Where  That untamed spirit wont to rise superiour  To every obstacle The waves of chance  To stem with steady breast and gain the shore  To press against the hand of opposition  And urge his way more swiftly for resistance  But love fond love enslaved the Warrior's heart  Beauty's soft chains had shackled his bold spirit  And he was conquer'd e'er he sought the fight  Now by my soul thou seest the Fair no more  Till we have laid those turrets in the dust  And steer our course t'ward Denmark  RODOLPH  These reproaches  No doubt become thee well Injustice ever  With weak excuses vindicates its actions  Scarce can I trust my ears these taunts from thee  But I'm perhaps a stranger and thou never  Beheld'st my footsteps in the crimson field  Or sword destructive dealing slaughter round  And didst thou take my Captive from my Tent  And do I live and bear this injury  VOLNIR  No more rash man Learn thou thy duty better  Did I not charge thee not to woe the Maid  What shall our camp be changed into a school  Of wanton dalliance Of inglorious love  Our deeds depend not on the breath of Rodolph  We judge we act from reason's firm resolves  RODOLPH  Oh would we were in Denmark I should there  Meet thee thy equal See my friends the man  Who acts who judges as firm reason dictates  He saw the beauteous prisoner he loved her  And from his envied Rival took the Maid  But love no doubt is glorious in the Chief  And base unmanly dalliance in the Soldier  VOLNIR  What power withholds that now I rush not on thee  And smite thee to the earthThe fixed soul  Which conscious of its rectitude despises  A madman's calumnyBut urge no farther  It may be dangerousYet hear me all  And thou attendIn yonder Tent inclosed  She dwells to me as tho' she not existed  Or was not form'd of mortal elements  And subject to the passions of mankind  No private end I seek the public good  Is all my care and from the warm emotion  A bar of frost secures this settled bosom  Retire and in thy Tent converse with shame  Th' attendant of unguarded liberty  And thoughtless Youth I pardon thee Begone    Exit  Rodolph  Enter a  SOLDIER  SOLDIER  As in our farthest limits t'ward the City  I with my fellows held observant watch  A Damsel cross'd our way with two attendants  She bade us straitway lead her to our Chief  And begs to be admitted to thy

aid  Is near at hand prepared to raise this siege  So Albert credits so the Citizens  But if thy heart consents with his to terms  Which I shall now propose the town is thine  VOLNIR  What bond coercive answers for his faith  GUNHILDA  I will remain with thee a willing Hostage  VOLNIR  'Tis well the terms unfold  GUNHILDA  On Oswy's part  He promises when Host with adverse Host  Is mix'd in fight to fly with all his troops  Then while the Citizens confusedly urge  Their way toward the walls thy Friends may enter  With the affrighted croud Or e'er two days  Are past when he is in the City posted  He will the gate committed to his care  To thee deliver at a certain hour  From thee he asks in coin in plate or gems  Secretly given a third part of the spoil  He wishes thee to curb impetuous rage  Nor shed unnecessary blood but one  One odious life he at thy hands requires  VOLNIR  Name the devoted victim  GUNHILDA  Edred he  Who every needy artizan inspires  With pride and every vile mechanic breast  With obstinacy He it is who checks thy course  Thy greatest enemy and our's  VOLNIR  I know  The Youth when first we for this siege prepared  He came with Albert and defied our power  Bold were his words and stately was his mien  I saw him afterwards like lightning pierce  Our thickest ranks his fury front to front  Rodolph opposed and desperate was the fight  But Rodolph's arm prevailed not On he rush'd  And havock mark'd his way This night again  His valour foil'd us he our prisoners say  The Citadel defended We accept  Thy terms fair Stranger To the noble Oswy  We swear the third part of the spoil to give  And Edred's forfeit life  GUNHILDA  He asks no more  The first he claims a debt of justice due  From thee to his deserts the last a sacrifice  To the diminish'd honour of his house  And sullied name 'Twere long nor need I tell  The cause of his desired revenge enough  That Edred is beyond expression base  Vile contumelious and that we would see  With pleasure see this Island from its base  Torn by an earthquake and with all its rocks  Plunged in the main so he might sink beneath  The ponderous ruins  VOLNIR  Be it as thou wilt  My generous Hostage We will pay the debt  Of justice and of vengeance Were he placed  Within our power had he a thousand lives  He dies  GUNHILDA  That thought gives comfort to my soul  For that I braved the horrors of the night  That steel'd the weaker nature of my sex  And brought me hither spite of danger's frown  And the pale eye of fear  VOLNIR  Dismiss all fear  Here thou art safe as in thy Father's

renownLead to the tent  Of Rodolph's captive this illustrious stranger  Collect a band of the most beauteous slaves  To wait upon her person She demands  Respect and reverence from each Son of Denmark  GUNHILDA  Collect them not I need not their attendance  Send back with speedy diligence my guides  'Tis meet I should be private To thy worth  I trust great Chief for safety and protection  VOLNIR  We all are thine and with obsequious readiness  Shall thy commands obey  GUNHILDA  My confidence  Is fully tried I thank thee for thy care    Exit    VOLNIR  What small events may shake the firmest

leads  While yet they droop and struck with fear lament  Our prosperous arms let us attack their camp  E'er the grey dawn appears above the hills  When heavy sleep weighs down their lids o'erwatch'd  Let us in silence to their tents proceed  Then like a whirlwind on their squadrons rush  And wake them from repose to breathe their last  OSWY  Was it for this with rapid march I came  To your relief

mortality  Indignity to thee by this attempt  We mean it not E'er thou wert in the city  Our plan was laid our chosen bands prepared  But should we fight nay overcome without thee  Say should'st thou not rejoice whatever hand  Laid low thy Country's Foes The patriot heart  Disclaims each interested sentiment  Nor heeds false glory but the public good  ALBERT  And Oswy surely seeks the public good  Tho' differing in opinion This attack  Was predetermined and I think it bears  A seemly aspect For thy speed we thank thee  And for thy caution Oswy We shall guide  Doubt not this enterprize with prudence Thou  See that thy harrast troops be well refresh'd  This night's attempt if with success uncrown'd  Will not impede but that we join tomorrow  And with united strength engage the Danes  OSWY  Prosperity attend you tho' I fear  The circumspection of the enemy  And tremble for th' event    Exit    EDRED  The dastard spirit  Not e'en a beam from Heaven could enkindle  The lukewarm Oswy

EDRED  Most base most execrable deed if crimes  Beyond the common course of villainy  Deserve a punishment more fell this act  Claims something more than death  SIGEBERT  It claims damnation  Heaven

Preserver of thy Mother's sacred life  Of mine and of thy Sister's More than this  The saviour of thy Country  EDRED  I behold  That face with reverence and these words of thine  Pierce thro' my inmost bosom and enkindle  Transports ne'er felt till nowBut how so long  Wert thou conceal'd How in this hostile camp  Why in this Danish dress  SIGEBERT  The tale is long  I'll tell thee all anonBut how my Daughter  Hast thou escaped In disappointed rage  The barbarous Rodolph said that he had slain thee  For which he fell by my avenging sword  In all the agony of frantic grief  Entering thy tent I thought I found thee there  Yet warmtho' breathless in despair I clasp'd  The bleeding corse and by the dusk deceived  Mourn'd over it for thine  EDRED  Me too the Dane  Inform'd that thou wert dead within thy tent  And almost stain'd my hand with parricide  But Providence sent thee to save my soul  From horror and remorseSay how my Sister  Didst thou escape And who is slain for thee  EDITHA  Gunhilda was no doubt the fated victim  EDRED  Gunhilda  EDITHA  Oswy's Daughter  EDRED  Treacherous Maid  I know her Father's baseness and her own  The intercepted guides who led her hither  Discover'd all  EDITHA  One tent confined us both  I thought her too a captive and with pity  Return'd her seeming pity She reveal'd  My rank to Volnir thence his threatening message  My simple confidence betray'd my Father  By which when bravely thou defiedst his power  We both had wellnigh fall'n a sacrifice  SIGEBERT  Hadst thou not storm'd their trenches we e'er now  Had with the dead been number'd  EDITHA  When I found  That thy assault was prosperous and the foe  Fled headlong from our gallant countrymen  I from my tent rush'd forth if possible  To find my Father Trembling in the entrance  Gunhilda stood fearful to stay or fly  EDRED  And there no doubt my Sister fell for thee  By Rodolph's blind and erring fury slain  EDITHA  Through the deserted camp in vain I wander'd  I found not whom I sought till by the hand  Of Heaven directed dubious of my way  I measured back again the mazy path  And found him here  SIGEBERT  Found me indeed and never  To part from thee again till Nature's hand  Stops my faint pulse and sinks me to my grave  EDRED  Oh be that time far offI long to hear  Thy sad disasters every strange adventure  And wonderful vicissitude of fate  Much must thou have endured  SIGEBERT  For eighteen years  Hath Volnir held me an unwilling prisoner  But now thou shalt conduct me to thy Mother  Much do I wish to see that best of Women  There shalt thou question me and I will answer  Throughout the livelong day Nor wilt thou hear  An uninstructive lesson My experience  Hath dearly been acquired thro' many a scene  Of checquer'd life by varying fortune cast  But now each boistrous storm is overblown  And I shall spend my life's decline in peace  Sequester'd from the world  EDRED  That must not be  I here resign to thee my borrow'd state  Thy King thy Country claim thy sage advice  Nor art thou yet by years so much enfeebled  But they may claim thy valour  SIGEBERT  Oh my Son  Thy duty charms me I shall not be needed  For thou art all their ownThe tears of joy  Moisten my cheeks my Children while I think  Upon your virtuesHappy happy Sigebert  In the warm hours of youth I could not see  Such true such homefelt satisfaction  O'erpast misfortune e'en to luxury  Heightens my joy Now do I know indeed  What 'tis to be a Fatherexquisite  Is the delight from Children such as mine  EDITHA  Benignant HeavenYe fierce ye boasted Heroes  Ye Conquerors of the world here look with envy  We taste we feel what you in vain desire  What war and ravaged countries cannot yield  True real happiness    Trumpet    SIGEBERT  What sounds are these  EDRED  'Tis Albert from the slaughter of the Danes  Returning    Enter  Albert  Oh my Friend let me embrace thee  My Editha is safeAnd I have found  A Father here This is the noble Earl  Whom well thou know'st by fame This is my Father  Him too from hapless slavery have we rescued  SIGEBERT  The brave and virtuous empty forms despise  They mingle in an instant souls together  Brave Albert Second Son whose patriot virtues    Embracing    Fill my old heart with warm affection 'tward thee  Thus let me strain thee to my breast  ALBERT  How sweet  Are the applauses of the wise and good  My heart acknowledges the warmth of thine  And every string accordant vibrates here  O Editha Thou little think'st what pleasure  I feel in thy deliverance not more  Thy Brother or thy Father feels  EDITHA  The thanks  A grateful soul can give receive The worth  Of Albert I revere thy Country saved  Shall join its praise with mine  EDRED  How far my Friend  Was thy pursuit  ALBERT  To yonder heights they fled  There were they rallied by their Chief again  Who bravely fought All that a Leader could  To turn the desperate fortune of the day  He did At length when all was lost he join'd  His flying bands who now in wild dismay  Haste to their ships our victory's compleat  But say my Friend the treacherous Gunhilda  Hast thou not found her in the Camp  SIGEBERT  She lies  Dead in this tent slain by mistake for her  ALBERT  For Editha Just Heaven  SIGEBERT  Now let us hence  This accident shall be to thee explain'd  To all my history shall be unfolded  Each wonderful event  ALBERT  But first 'twere fit  E'er we dismiss our troops to seize and punish  The traitor Oswy  SIGEBERT  Would'st thou punish him  EDRED  Doth he not merit punishment  SIGEBERT  He doth  And can he feel a greater than to view  His murder'd Child Could cunning cruelty  Devise one more severeOh Editha  The tortures of the rack were light to this  Well know I what a Father must endure  To think too that she fell by his contrivance  No gallant Albert seek no other vengeance  Permit him to retreat oppress'd with sorrow  And stung with conscious guilt While we reflect  With pleasure on the difference of our souls  Which bear no sordid stains While we rejoice  Raised from calamity and woe to bliss  While we congratulate our ransom'd Country  And as we offer up our thanks to Heaven  Pray that she ever thus may stand secure  From foreign arms and from domestic treason  Free glorious happy to remotest ages  FINIS  EPILOGUE  NO longer now in pomp of grief array'd  No longer Editha the Captive Maid  Prepared t' examine this same Tragic story  In my own person I advance before ye  My critic art at least this once to try  And scan our Bard's defects with nicest eye  Yet some apology th' attempt may need  But by your looks embolden'd I'll proceed  Who without terror Rodolph's fury traces  Why tho' a Dane was he refused the Graces  Were such the manners of those Northern Climes  Why not have bent them to our gentler times  To seek his Mistress' lifeSo desperate grown  He should have rather fled and saved his own  Surely  that  Albert might have spoke more plain  The City's Praefectbut my dying Swain  Why had he not some crafty scheme devised  And ventured 'mid the Danish camp disguised  He should have crept or swam or fought or strove  And hazarded his trustto gain his Love  Th' affection of a BrotherHow misplaced  And what a violence to modern Taste  A soul defying death and accents Roman  How could  they  suit with any British Woman  The simple and the naturalHow stupid  I should have ransack'd all the stores of Cupid  Hopes fears doubts jealousies and warm desires  Darts arrows daggers poison'd bowls and fires  Are to a Tragic Piece my powers decreed  Let it be great and Tragical indeed  Let Passion cease the guiding rein t' obey  Let Grief be strain'd to its sublimest key  In frantic fury let me curse the light  And die enchantingly with all my might  But egotisms and irony apart  Say have our Author's numbers touch'd the heart  Have they from Pity stole th' ingenuous sigh  And raised the trembling tear in Virtue's eye  This is th' unerring comment this the test  And all remarks besideslike minea jest
