 JASON A TRAGEDY  IN FIVE ACTS  BY R GLOVER ESQ AUTHOR OF "LEONIDAS AN EPIC POEM"  Ex fumo dare lucem Cogitat ut speciosa dehinc miracula promat  Hor de Art Poet v  LONDON  PRINTED FOR J DEBRETT  OPPOSITE BURLINGTONHOUSE PICCADILLY MDCCXCIX  TO THE READER  THE following Tragedy which is now offered to the Public from the pen of RICHARD GLOVER Esq Author of LEONIDAS is a Sequel to the MEDEA which has been performed at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane with the greatest applause This Piece was presented by him many years previous to his death to the celebrated Mrs Yates who passed the highest encomiums upon it but owing to the grandeur of the scenery and the expense required to bring it forward it was altogether laid aside and it has since that period been offered to the Managers of both Theatres who still have the same objection It is therefore only necessary to add that the Public well knowing the Author's talents have it in their power to judge of its merits or defects  July  G Y B  Dramatis Personae  JASON  under the name of  MELAMPUS  MADAUCES  ORONTES  Genius of Caucasus  MEDEA  or the Enchantress  CASSANDANE  Nymphs and Spirits  SCENE  A Castle near Mount Caucasus and the Caspian Sea  JASON  ACT I  SCENE I  MELAMPUS  completely armed and  MADAUCES  bearing a wand  MADAUCES  THESE snowtopp'd mountains green in wood below  That restless flood which wears its stony bed  And parts the meadows yon expanse of waters  Which at the vale's extremity presents  A sea are all the workmanship of Nature  The spot selected here is magic ground  These massy structures rivalling the hills  Are not the labour of terrestrial hands  MELAMPUS  Whose then my sage Madauces  MADAUCES  Dost thou mark  A troop of horsemen issu'd from the wood  Pace by the banks of that resounding stream  And one who bears a diadem precedes  MELAMPUS  They may explain what region hath receiv'd us  Meantime thy wonted caution will disguise  My name and country Call me still Melampus  Oh couldst thou hide me from myself Madauces  MADAUCES  Is this a time for languor Look Melampus  MELAMPUS  A lion sallies from that secret portal  MADAUCES  The tawny savage rushes on the chief  Of that advancing band With coward fear  They shrink they leave their unassisted lord  SCENE II  MADAUCES  to  MELAMPUS  going  Fly with an eagle's swiftness thou unconquer'd  Alas the lion gripes the monarch's arm  Wind thy strong fingers in the shaggy mane  One effort more will drag him down to earth  Ay therethy jav'lin now will rive his heart  O in benignity prosuse to others  Unkind and rig'rous to thyself They come  SCENE III  MADAUCES MELAMPUS  and  ORONTES  ORONTES  Far as a king may condescend in thanks  I render mine to thee  MELAMPUS  Thy arm is wounded  ORONTES  I feel no pain Most fortunate of men  Thou from this ridge of Caucasus around  The Caspian shore to Iaxartes' source  Shalt be proclaim'd the happy who hast sav'd  Their lord Orontes  MELAMPUS  Is that distant water  The sarfam'd Caspian This the hoary front  Os Caucasus Art thou the region's lord  ORONTES  The  king  of  kings  of origin divine  Who mean to raise thee nearer to myself  Sev'n spacious cities all with rich domains  And the first rank among Orontes' servants  Shall soon exalt thee from thy humble state  MELAMPUS  Sev'n times sev'n cities capitals of realms  Could not repair my loss nor ease my troubles  MADAUCES  Melampus  ORONTES  Dost thou talk or think of troubles  None canst thou seel protected by my favour  To glad thee more I want thy further aid  And will employ thee in a dearer cause  Than life itself But instantly reveal  Thy birth and appellation  MELAMPUS  Who I am  Or whence deriv'd avails not thee to know  Me less to utter  ORONTES  I command thee speak  Whence and what art thou is my will to know  MELAMPUS  Mine to conceal  ORONTES  Ha stranger  MADAUCES  Prince forbear  Solicitation or command is fruitless  ORONTES  He must be then some deity resigning  His empyreal station to defend  My sacred head None yet of mortal race  Hath disobey'd my pleasure or endur'd  My wrinkling brow  MELAMPUS  No deity am I  But one of earth's degen'rate sons like thee  ORONTES  Then dar'st thou dally with a king's impatience  MELAMPUS  Why rather dally with my own resentment  Which should chastise ingratitude and pride  ORONTES  Am I Orontes Do adoring vassals  Do princes crowd to thrust their splendid heads  Beneath my feet Where am I  MELAMPUS  In my power  ORONTES  Thou at my smile no transport didst betray  Nor fear'st my frown  MELAMPUS  Thou look'st around in vain  Thy base adoring homagers are fled  Fled from the danger which my arm withstood  They left their idol to the lion's paw  And now to me the victor of that savage  Were my just anger equal to thy pride  ORONTES  Thou wouldst not stain thy sword with kingly blood  MELAMPUS  What shall prevent me Thy imperial title  Thy arrogance hath cancell'd all respect  Or shall thy pow'r Where is it Thy dependants  Have left thee helpless To thy single might  Art thou contracted  ORONTES  aside  Strange these sounds yet true  MELAMPUS  Thou seem'si dismay'd  ORONTES  O stranger I am mov'd  But not with fear  MELAMPUS  Nor hast thou cause The sallics  Of mere presumption never shall provoke me  Thou art secure Orontes not that streams  Of royal tincture have enrich'd thy veins  But from the gen'rous warrant of thy aspect  Sure thou hast seeds within though yet unfruitful  Through impious flatt'ry of barbarian slaves  At least my soul is earnest to discover  A trace of merit in the man I sav'd  If thou hast virtues sleeping in thy bosom  Attend with patience while I rouse their languor  ORONTES  In admiration I suspend my voice  MELAMPUS  To be a man and know himself is all  Man can attain Whoe'er aspires to more  Is less than brute The lion whom I slew  Had he address'd me with his smarting paw  And I extracted thence an irksome thorn  Would with mute thanks have lick'd my helpful hand  Thou just redeem'd from death's voracious maw  Didst with rude insult thy protector greet  Doth not that blood which trickles down thy arm  Denote thee frail This day's mischance proclaim  Thee and thy pow'r obnoxious to disasters  And fortune's sport Did sickness never waste  Thy pamper'd flesh nor anguish gnaw thy heart  ORONTES  Oh  MELAMPUS  Cease to fear I am thy friend  ORONTES  I own it  But thy inquiry if devouring anguish  Hath never gnaw'd my bosom doth a note  Of discord strike which quite untunes my soul  I am indeed obnoxious to disasters  And fortune's sport  MADAUCES  Direct us where to lead thee  And wind thy mantle round that wounded arm  ORONTES  If my whole frame were overspread with wounds  They would be gentle to the rankling shaft  Long fix'd and deep within my tortur'd heart  Ye ramparts inaccessible which hold  My hopes and joys ah never never more  Through your enchanted portals must I pass  To view the queen of beauty O my friend  To me the pomp of royalty is tedious  The high repast is tasteless gems are saint  Persumes disgustful softest music harsh  Oft as our god ascends his eastern hill  And dips in darkness his returning wheels  I sit and weep at these forbidden gates  MELAMPUS  Who is this fair one  ORONTES  Fair That ruling pow'r  Whose beams yet tinge the shadowy plumes of ev'ning  In his meridian splendour is less bright  The snowy lustre of the moon less fair  MELAMPUS  Now if by wily stratagem or force  I may assist thee  ORONTES  Wilt thou gallant stranger  MELAMPUS  I will  ORONTES  Then swear Forgive forgive my weakness  How can I doubt thee  MELAMPUS  On my sword I swear  By ev'ry tie of honour and of truth  ORONTES  That thou this high achievement wilt attempt  That should this magic threshold yield thee passage  Thou wilt apply to yon disdaining fair  That eloquence which charms my pride away  And win her pity to a dying monarch  Who throws his youth and empire at her feet  MELAMPUS  I call on Themis to record my oath  ORONTES  What god is Themis  MELAMPUS  Goddess she of justice  In her pure service hath enroll'd my sword  And on my shield her image is impress'd  Oh that my heart had borne it  Aside  MADAUCES  Hear the king  ORONTES  Wait till the morn A rural palace near  Shall give thee welcome to a feastful board  To strains concordant with th' enliv'ning dance  And to refreshment on a couch of odours  MELAMPUS  Thrice hath the sun persorm'd his annual course  Since I was seated at a social feast  Since griefassuaging music lull'd my ear  And in my view the cheerful dance inspir'd  Since I have stretch'd me on no soster couch  Than earth's cold surface or th' unquiet deck  With night's unfriendly moisture to contend  With clam'rous tempests and the beating rain  No other pillow than some pointed crag  Beside that water's melancholy fall  To broken slumber shall invite my head  ORONTES  Unequall'd hardships Liv'st thou to relate them  Wilt thou be still offended if a prince  Benignly try to sathom thy distress  And raise thy head to comfort  MELAMPUS  Rest content  My sword is thine my sorrow mine alone  ORONTES  Enough  MADAUCES  Enough indeed of time is wasted  Prince thou dost wnat some salutary hand  We will transport thee gently  MELAMPUS  to  ORONTES  Ha thou droop'st  Thy lips are pale  ORONTES  Support me Musi I die  Then near thee cruel portal shall I find  For the first time repose  Sinks down  MELAMPUS  His eyes are clos'd  No help is near He diesand I the cause  SCENE III  A cloud descends concealing the gale of the castle and the body of  ORONTES  from  MELAMPUS  and  MADAUCES  MADAUCES  retreating with  MELAMPUS  Around us all is marv'lous  MELAMPUS  Those rude blasts  Whose sudden burst repell'd us  MADAUCES  Did not rise  At Nature's summons  MELAMPUS  What a cloud is fall'n  Impenetrably dark and veils the castle  MADAUCES  Nor this a genuine vapour of the earth  But for some hidden purpose fram'd by magic  Look it disperses and the wind is charm'd  Again to silence Ha the king is gone  MELAMPUS  Gone Whither  MADAUCES  Ask of heav'n  MELAMPUS  Life fled before  By me expell'd  MADAUCES  He only was exhausted  By loss of blood not dead  MELAMPUS  He died I tell thee  My ficrceness my severity destroy'd him  Why should a wretch like me presume to censure  Another's frailty I who nurse within me  Two living vipers horror and remorse  I with the venom of my breath have blasted  His languid spirit  MADAUCES  O for ever blind  To thy own merit thou didst then surpass  Thy wonted magnanimity and patience  The snowy range of yonder hills displays  Not whiter flecces to the morning's ray  Than doth repentance to the eye of heav'n  Thy bosom blanch'd from guilt  MELAMPUS  It cannot be  I feel myself detestable and hideous  MADAUCES  Shall never night return but thou despond  MELAMPUS  No never night to me shall usher peace  Nor the sun joy  MADAUCES  O'ertoil'd thou wantest rest  MELAMPUS  Where shall I find it  MADAUCES  Come recline thy head  On me  MELAMPUS  No rather dash it on a rock  And so compose me to eternal rest  MADAUCES  What would befal me then  MELAMPUS  Ah what indeed  Benevolent and venerable man  Who thy paternal mansion dost abandon  To hear my howlings in these desert shades  All who consort with me are doom'd to woe  What is become of this unhappy king  MADAUCES  Snatch'd from our sight by necromantic pow'r  Now let us try what spot secure and tranquil  This wilderness may yield us I will stand  A watchful guardian o'er thy head to wave  This awful rod and meditate some charm  Which may in silence bind the restless throat  Of night's shrill bird the lion of his rage  The fell hyaena of her craft disarm  And lurking tiger's vigilance elude  That undisturb'd on sleep's refreshing lap  Thy manly vigour may relieve its toils  Then like an eagle springing from his nest  With wings expanded and undazzled sight  To meet the sun intrepid shalt thou rise  Shalt look on glory and forget thy woes  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  The Genius of Caucasus holding a branch of palm and looking through the sidescene  He sings  Trochaics  LOVELORN maiden I behold  Through these wilds thy dubious steps  Me thou seest not but thy ear  With consoling notes I fill  Arm'd with safety are thy feet  I am sent thy guide and guard  CASSANDANE  entering  By love by grief impell'd and voice benign  By thee encourag'd Cassandane bends  At these forbidden gates her suppliant knee  Sublime possessor of these mystic walls  Known by thy virtues only while thy name  And history lie bury'd in concealment  Who bear'st no title but of sage enchantress  Beneficent and gracious to these nations  Redeem'd by thee from pestilence and famine  Enrich'd with conquest and elate with triumph  They once ador'd thy presence but desponding  Regret thee now their guardian pow'r withdrawn  Thou dost not hear Ah me These massy bulwarks  Shut Cassandane from thy ear and sight  Can I obtain a boon refus'd to all  The Genius sings  Trochaics  Injur'd maid thy suit prefer  Pity dwells within these gates  Science to redress thy wrongs  Cassandane doubt no more  CASSANDANE  kneeling  Then by thy pity by my own slight merits  Which once endear'd me to thy smile I sue  Stupendous woman paragon of wisdom  Let not another's sault exclude me longer  O to thy presence grant my woes access  The Genius sings  Trochaics  Horrid centinel obey  What thy potent mistress wills  To this virgin entrance give  But thy hideous form conceal  SCENE II  A Spirit appearing on the battlement  To mortal sight invisible I rise  And curse thee hateful messenger of pity  Who open throw'st these interdicted gates  CASSANDANE  starting as the gates fly open  Oh direful voice how dissonant from thine  Intelligence harmonious who unseen  Yet warbling sweet compassion hast upheld  My fearful spirit O attend me still  The Genius sings  Cretics  Void of fear light in hope  To my strains dance along  Over slowers under shades  Trochaics  Shades attun'd to liquid sounds  From the nightingales and rills  CASSANDANE  coming nearer to the gate  Soft gales solicit with a fragrant whisper  Birds trilling vocal founts in music call  Bless'd habitation Emblem of that goodness  Which governs here a resuge to my troubles  The Genius sings  Cretics  Child of care vocal founts  Trilling birds fragrant gales  Glowing flow'rs charm the sense  Trochaics  Here with wisdom thou shalt rest  These may sooth but wisdom cures  The Spirit singing enters the castle  Cassandane  follows and the gates close again  SCENE III  The Spirit on the battlement  Night is collecting all her sable skirts  To fly th' approaching dawn Ye loit'ring nymphs  Hear from your caves your mountains woods and streams  With awe receive the signal of my voice  For preparation while in sounds of horror  I rouse the victim from his rocky pillow  Illguided wand'rer whose advent'rous steps  Have pass'd these lonely confines didst thou hope  To rest conceal'd from me thy evil genius  Awake The raven with funcreal notes  The screeching inmate of the moulder'd oak  The tiger's yell invite thee to despair  While my infernal cries their discord aid  To pierce with dread thy enterprising soul  Which shall to vultures leave thy mangled frame  In sight of these impenetrable walls  SCENE IV  The Spirit vanishes  MELAMPUS  and  MADAUCES  MELAMPUS  Malignant voice thy threat'nings I desy  MADAUCES  There spoke my hero like himself  MELAMPUS  Why surely  Thou couldst not think a phantom of the night  Could shake my longtry'd firmness No Madauces  I sear no other than the direful image  Within me borne and planted on my heart  All else apparcll'd in the blackest terrors  The monster's brood the necromancer's spell  Whate'er the name of Demogorgon draws  From Pluto's borders I can face unmov'd  Thou then whose mind delib'rate age and science  Have cloth'd in wisdom give thy last instruction▪  And my swift sword shall execute thy counsel  The voice of a Nymph from behind the scene  Whence is this wand'rer who defiles our groves  With foul contagion from his perjur'd breath  SECOND VOICE  It is Iolchian Jason who forsworn  Betray'd his love the weak ungrateful Jason  Who for Creüsa Creon's heir abandon'd  The wise Medea offspring of the sun  THIRD VOICE  Ye woods ye rocks ye hollowwinding shores  Ye caverns found the perjuries of Jason  MELAMPUS  I am reveal'd My echo'd name disturbs  The nymphs and fills their solitude with horror  MADAUCES  It is the cry of demons to consound  Thy resolution  MELAMPUS  They declare me perjur'd  Speak they not truth Madauces I am Jason  That impious salseone I betray'd Medea  Who sav'd me from disnonour who subdu'd  The Colchian monsters bless'd my toils with love  And crown'd my triumphs with the golden fleece  I slew my children by her srantic hand  Oh my poor slaughter'd boys Your father's falsehood  Gave birth to madness which destroy'd you both  MADAUCES  Aid not thy soes  MELAMPUS  The bloody act was mine  Ye fiends divulge my parricide and treason  Blast with your taunting breath my strength my courage  Then rouse the desert that some tiger's bowels  May sepulchre my sorrow and my shame  MADAUCES  Dost thou forget th' engagement to Orontes  Doth thy performance slacken  MELAMPUS  No Direct me  To rash on danger  MADAUCES  Summon thy attention  Last night when all was silent in the skies  The moon then smiling on me I invok'd  And charm'd a willing spirit from her orb  By his fair guidance o'er the mead I pluck'd  A flower which opens to her mystic beams  And shuts its bosom in the blaze of day  Nine drops of precious moisture from this flower  Have bless'd with safety thy anointed spear  Whose touch unbarring those enchanted gates  From magic durance shall protect thy body  And visionary forms of peril quell  The rest thy manly conduct must accomplish  Now grasp the spear nor quit thy sinewy hold  This once forsaken leaves thee to perdition  The voice of a Fiend behind the scene  How can the guilty prosper  SECOND VOICE  From his hand  Enervated by crimes the sword shall fall  THIRD VOICE  His spear shall break his corselet be unbrac'd  The faithless heart no buckler shall defend  MELAMPUS  Fiends do you brave me O victorious deeds  Which heretofore have dignify'd my arm  Now rise in thought and animate my bosom  While rending glory from the front of horror  I add new lustre to your splendid roll  SCENE V  MELAMPUS  and  MADAUCES  Melampus  with his spear strikes the gates which open with a harsh sound and discover a Centaur brandishing a mace and standing across the entrance  Melampus  attacks the Centaur who at the touch of the spear instantly vanishes The whole wall disappears at the same time and discovers a second wall and gate  MADAUCES  Now hast thou prov'd the virtues of thy spear  MELAMPUS  And will essay its energy again  He strikes the second gate which disappears with the whole wall leaving in view a craggy rock with a torrent of water down the middle and a hydra and griffin on the summit All vanish at the touch of the spear A third wall appears with a gulf of fire before it The fire is filled with fiends and a gigantic figure of Death shaking a dart is planted between the gulf and the gate  MADAUCES  These are illusive images of danger  Which perseverance will dissolve to air  SCENE VI  MELAMPUS  and  MADAUCES  Melampus  strikes the figure of Death which sinks with the fire  MELAMPUS  Thus far successful I will try the temper  Of this third portal Dost thou see Madauces  Yon Cyclops rolling his presumptuous orb  Which glares defiance from his spacious front  More lofty than the battlement By Mars  I will have entrance monster  The gate opening spontaneously admits  Melampus  and is immediately shut against  Madauces  SCENE VII  MADAUCES  Stay Melampus  I am excluded To a real soe  No airy spectre is he now expos'd  From me no succour can he find but prayers  Thou rising god whose comprehensive eye  Now o'er the bright horizon beams afresh  And views the bravest of mankind in peril  Resent no longer thy Medea's wrong  Compassionate the penitential Jason  And with the swiftness of thy rays direct  His rapid jav'lin to the monster's heart  Looking attentively as on some distant object  My eyes be steady Luminous in gold  Dropp'd through th' unclosing portals of the east  A cloud low waving skims along the vale  The fleecy radiance opens Two bright forms  Descend and hither point their gliding course  SCENE VIII  MADAUCES  and two Spirits one personating the God of Riches the other  HEBE  Goddess of Youth  FIRST SPIRIT  Old Colchian once attendant on Medea  Sprung from that god who bursting from the east  Heard from his chariot thy ascending voice  Hast thou forgot when Jason pledg'd his faith  And by her love obtain'd the golden fleece  Thou from her native Phasis to the walls  Of treach'rous Corinth didst her wand'rings share  Thou best canst witness to her grief and wrongs  When Jason lest her in a foreign clime  Forlorn unshelter'd and espous'd Creüsa  Thou saw'st the blood congenial with the sun  Flow from her infants by a mother's frenzy  For guilty Jason dost thou lift thy voice  Th' indignant god rejects th' unseemly pray'r  By me delivers his sublime behests  That thou assist his vengeance  MADAUCES  He may pierce  This aged bosom with consuming rays  And he will find it to Medea true  Nor less to that poor penitent her husband  FIRST SPIRIT  Hear thy reward to animate thy duty  I am the god of riches bliss of age  Come and behold the diamond emblaze  My gorgeous hall The emerald the topaz  The ruby shoot their mingling beams around  HEBE  sings  Trochaics  Hebe I of youth am goddess  I can smooth a wrinkled cheek  Go possess unbounded treasure  I will then thy prime renew  MADAUCES  I fathom now the impotent device  For me your thinspun magic do you spread  Audacious demons under sacred forms  Of messengers from him who lights the world  Hadst thou to give with that infernal hand  To  Plutus  The treasures boasted by thy lying tongue  Couldst thou rekindle fire in icy veins  To  Hebe  Thus should a look command you back to hell  The Spirits vanish  SCENE IX  MADAUCES  What hollow sound beneath me Gods I hear  A subterraneous groan portending death  The earth rocks under my supplanted feet  SCENE X  After a horrible sound under the stage violent and repeated thunder and lightning above the battlements of the castle totter and fall the third wall disappears and discovers a beautiful garden with a magnificent palace  MADAUCES MELAMPUS  prostrate on the ground with his spear and shield held fast  ORONTES  bending over him  ORONTES  My brave protector on the earth oh rise  Rise to a king's embraces and support  MELAMPUS  rising  Orontes  MADAUCES  to  MELAMPUS  Art thou safe  MELAMPUS  I am my friend  And dost thou live Orontes Let me press thee  To my transported bosom Quick relate  What fortune plac'd thee here  ORONTES  Thou first unfold  Thy wondrous acts which threw these ramparts down  MADAUCES  Nor kill my age Melampus with impatience  MELAMPUS  Two gates I forc'd Admitted through the last  Ere yet beyond the entrance I could plant  My feet secure impenetrable clouds  Enwrapp'd my forehead and a steep descent  At once drew downward my reluctant steps  Compell'd to trace a cavern's black abyss  Three Gorgon spectres at th' extremest depth  Rose from the gaping mould with livid brands  Whose glimm'ring sulphur on the clammy roof  And sides presented to my sick'ning sight  A hateful brood distilling poison round▪  ORONTES  What hath he suffer'd  MADAUCES  What surmounted Hear  MELAMPUS  Amid this baleful scene a hideous voice  Roar'd through the dim vacuity I turn'd  When lo th' enormous Cyclops striding down  Lanc'd with impatient rage his pointed beam  Which o'er my shoulder inoffensive flew  Then with extended arms and eager pace  Advanc'd to grasp me Blindly driv'n by fury  And my kind fortune on my spear he rush'd  I held it firm and felt the grating blade  Pierce his tough breast and vibrate in his heart  Whose groan redoubled horror through the cave  ORONTES  What next  MELAMPUS  With peals of subterraneous thunder  As from her centre heav'd the earth convuls'd  And shook me prostrate  MADAUCES  Such as now we found thee  MELAMPUS  The swift transition to delights like these  From earth's cold entrails and unwholesome vapours  To this pure sky and these delicious bowers  I mark with wonder uninform'd by knowledge  ORONTES  My history alas is brief and sad  By some strange pow'r transported from the spot  Where last you saw me sainting I awoke  Beneath an arbour's melancholy roof  With nightshade clad with monumental yew  And loathsome plants the foes to life and joy  MELAMPUS  But thou wert wounded by the lion's claw  ORONTES  My wound was heal'd A ghastly goblin stood  Full in my view a centinel from hell  All exclamations to discharge my grief  E'en the complaints of disappointed love  The cruel fiend deny'd me and with scorn  Mock'd my imperial person when I mourn'd  My black reverse from boundless power to thraldom  When on the earth outstretch'd thy limbs appear'd  How I was suffer'd to approach I know not  Nor yet how long in sreedom may continue  To grace thy merit with a monarch's praise  MELAMPUS  Give none to me That recompence is due  To him alone my counsellor and guardian  ORONTES  This poor old man What succour could he yield  To thee who doubtless spring from earliest kings  If not by some divinity produc'd  MELAMPUS  Shortsighted prince unexercis'd in knowledge  Learn that of all endowments Heav'n bestows  Its richest boon is wisdom far excelling  The flame of courage and the nerves of strength  In me his wisdom triumphs He directs  My sword and jav'lin Had I gods for parents  Herculean vigour and the strength of Atlas  Without this sage and venerable man  I were inferior to the meanest reptile  Which crawls in darkness through a dungeon's slime  He too is righteoushis unerring heart  No selfreproach tormentshis tranquil thoughts  No sadd'ning care disquietsbut for me  MADAUCES  to  MELAMPUS  leaning upon him  Be wise Melampus  MELAMPUS  Wisdom fled with virtue  ORONTES  I see the demonLook he glares upon me  Assist me heroshield me from these torments  MADAUCES  He cannot help thee  ORONTES  to  MELAMPUS  Whence this sudden change  These agitations which embitter joy  And blot thy lustre  MADAUCES  Question him no further  Thy presence now but irritates his pain  ORONTES  I must retire The beck'ning fiend forbids  My longer stay  SCENE XI  MADAUCES  and  MELAMPUS  CASSANDANE  unseen by them appears in a grove  CASSANDANE  Appointed here I take  My stand unseen  MELAMPUS  My friend my second father  Whose wisdom guides me and whose art desends  I prov'd the wonders of thy magic dew  Enchanted gates unclos'd the Centaur fled  The Hydra veil'd her sev'nfold neck in darkness  O vers'd in science and supremely good  Is there no plant affords some precious juice  Which may dispel the sorcery of anguish  And disenchant the bosom from despair  That black magician in the mind  CASSANDANE  Oh words  To penetrate a marble heart  MADAUCES  My son  Why drops that sorrow to deform thy glory  MELAMPUS  When I reflect how Heav'n and nature fram'd me  With nerves and spirit for the hardiest toils  With qualities endu'd me to secure  Felicity and praise then how my folly  Such gifts perverting to the lowest depths  Of misery hath plung'd meI must weep  My very deeds this day excite distraction  MADAUCES  Think where thou art  MELAMPUS  Where conquest gives me rule  What shall control my anguish but thy friendship  MADAUCES  Believe me half thy toils are yet to come  MELAMPUS  Then I revive  MADAUCES  Remember thy engagement▪  MELAMPUS  I do and will perform  MADAUCES  Prepare and sollow  MELAMPUS  I am prepar'd Behold my jav'lin safe  And in fresh perils shall my soul exult  Though like Alcides I descend to hell  Or mix in combat with a giant race  From those deriv'd who shook the tow'rs of Jove  SCENE XII  CASSANDANE  Miraculous in valour more in grief  To court new dangers doth thy spirit swell  Yet could thy tongue from agony of heart  Ask "if no plant affords some precious juice  "Which might dispel the sorcery of anguish  "And disenchant the bosom from despair  "That black magician in the mind" Alas  Whoe'er thou art whatever be thy fault  I will report thee in the words of pity  Thy own sad strain will mitigate resentment  At thy intrusion to this seat of wonders  Which awe my mind and ev'ry sense confound  SCENE XIII  CASSANDANE  and the Genius of Caucasus  The Genius sings  Cretics and Trochaics  To thy woes add not fear  Thou hast aided her thou lov'st  Serving her thou shalt reap  Consolation and redress  CASSANDANE  Thou known melodious comforter whose voice  Procur'd my entrance and in music smooth'd  The paths of terror do I hear again  Thy accents melt Thou com'st not sure deputed  To keep me longer absent from her sight  I have perform'd the service she enjoin'd  Alone amid these miracles I shudder  Ah reconduct me to her guardian breast  She returns to the palace the Spirit singing before her then vanishing at the gate as she enters  END OF THE SECOND ACT  ACT III  SCENE I  MADAUCES  and  MELAMPUS  MADAUCES  MY art informs me that the utmost efforts  Of violence are try'd Less obvious mischief  And thence more dang'rous threatens Wary conduct  Must now succeed to valour All around  Is dress'd in soft delusion to dissolve  The firmest heart in languor Ev'ry bird  Tunes to deceitful melody his throat  The od'rous gales in whispers and the rills  Diffuse in warbles heartentrancing pleasures  Each fragrant myrtle may conceal a fiend  And fate sit lurking in perfidious flowers  MELAMPUS  Let me attempt the palace  MADAUCES  Something new  And strange awaits thee I can pass no further  My steps some hand invisible repels  Thou know'st how far that weapon can befriend thee  But with internal fences may they prove  Like adamant against the pow'r of woman  Secure thy heart The very sorm of beauty  Much more of yielding beauty arm'd with craft  Subdues the mighty and deceives the wise  Most frail least guarded when oppress'd by sadness  Should that accustom'd visitant approach thee  Just on the close of action oh endure  Till my return endure thy heavy thoughts  But shun relief from beauty's proffer'd joys  Or thou art lost  MELAMPUS  Than adamant more strong  To fence my heart thy counsels I retain  MADAUCES  A power to mine superior drives me hence  And stops my frozen tongue  SCENE II  MELAMPUS  My friend is gone  I stand alone This try'd defence I hold  And on my single conduct must rely  Now for the palace  SCENE III  MELAMPUS  A large scroll inscribed with letters of fire appears in the air  MELAMPUS  Vision strange and new  I will confront thee with a stedsast eye  And give those characters of fire a voice  He reads  "Retreat in safety ere that direful gate  "Is thrown abroad Thy enterprise pursu'd  "Will end in cureless torment to thy mind"  He speaks  That mind in torment exercis'd so long  Defies the menace and disdains retreat  Out of my way thou obsiacle of air  He brandishes his spear and the scroll vanishes  The palace is disclos'dth' enchantress comes  That rod denotes her potent arm that veil  O'ershades a visage hateful to the sun  Yet majesty sustains her awful port  And not unlike divinity she moves  SCENE IV  MELAMPUS  and the Enchantress  ENCHANTRESS  Presumptuous man what art thou who hast dar'd  Invade my barrier and molest my peace  MELAMPUS  Thou dost behold thy conqueror proud woman  That knowledge may suffice thee  ENCHANTRESS  Art thou pure  Of blameless thoughts and unpolluted truth  Hast thou ne'er trac'd the devious paths of frailty  They only whose unviolated faith  No perjuries have stain'd can sojourn here  For them alone these chaste abodes reveal  Their hidden treasures These harmonious choirs  For them alone Elysian music chaunt  Them to refreshing banks these fountains call  With flow'ry odours virtuous toils to cheer  MELAMPUS  Whence is thy right to question me Enchantress  Who dost prosane the sanctity of virtue  In her bright garb infernal arts to mask  Pure or impure commission'd I appear  From sacred Themis to redress the wrong'd  Whate'er I am thy monsters I could tame  Thy losty bulwarks mix with empty air  And dissipate their visionary guard  ENCHANTRESS  waving her wand while she is speaking  Seest thou this gloom which overcasts the sky  Or feel'st this sudden chilness in the air  The myrtles wither and the roses fade  At thy illboding sight Reply who art thou  Death is ascending from his iron cell  His arms are spread abroad e'en now they raise  His house of terrors to enclose thee round  Yet wilt thou answer  The scene changes to the inside of a sepulchre  MELAMPUS  Unappall'd I stand  And spurn this salse creation of thy spells  In justice strong a victor's right I claim  And rather question thee hell's impious agent  Why thou in base captivity retain'st  A hapless princess and this nation's lord  Why griev'st his bosom with thy hagard fiends  ENCHANTRESS  O truly brave Thy forti  de in wonder  Ev'n I contemplate no  w  out compunction  Foresee the evils soon to s  rm around thee  To stain with woman's tears a hero's cheek  To shake with groans that majesty of form  Or with distraction's dragon claw unrip  Th' excelling texture of that godlike mind  MELAMPUS  What canst thou raise more hidcous than my spear  Hath foil'd already Call another Hydra  Bring a new Centaur arm a second Cyclops  ENCHANTRESS  All mortal force all charms I know must fall  Before thy valour guarded by that weapon  Nor is there need of violence to quell thee  Thou prodigy of virtues wove with errors  Thou bear'st thy foc within thee Not the touch  Of that anointed staff can there avail  There is no plant "affords the precious juice  "Which may dispel the sorcery of anguish  "Or disenchant the bosom from despair  "That black magician in the mind"  MELAMPUS  My words  My own reflcctions hath she leagu'd against me  What then Thou Themis art my sov'reign judge  Save one besides before whose injur'd feet  My penitential spirit sues to break  At these last words the Enchantress turns aside and weeps  But wilt thou pow'r of equity permit  The artifice of magic to assume  Thy holy semblance and arraign thy champion  When scorning safety I refuse no hardship  Which may present me to the eye of mercy  Wretch as I am less hateful and deform'd  No no thou wilt not In thy righteous service  I challenge Heav'n's support Enchantress hear  Art thou confounded Then the gods are present  Does thy heart labour sorceress with sighs  O'er thy defeated cruelty and art  Release the monarch and his captive princess  Nor to an outrage on thy sex provoke me  ENCHANTRESS  Dost thou defy me still  MELAMPUS  I do by Themis  She stamps on the ground and waves her wand A figure representing  FAME  ascends bearing a mirror A hand in the air holds a taper  ENCHANTRESS  Bold as thou art by that infernal taper  Dar'st thou survey this mirror  MELAMPUS  Yes I dare  And thou in dread this weapon may'st survey  Which braves the keenest rancour of thy charms  ENCHANTRESS  Vain man that weapon hath no other gift  Than to protect the body To the mind  There is no guard but innocence Draw nigh  Consider well in order as they rise  These melancholy portraitures of truth  Reviving pass'd but sorrowful events  This is Iolcos where that first of vessels  Proud Argo deepens with the weight of heroes  Sent to reclaim the golden fleece from Colchis  Around their bark the wond'ring Nereids float  Fame flies before them Bounding o'er the surge  See where they pass the Euxine's clashing jaws  And there on Colchis rest their toiling oars  Why dost thou start  MELAMPUS  I startwith admiration  The figure of Fame sinks A second representing the God of  LOVE  rises with a mirror  ENCHANTRESS  Lo here more lovely than his native Tempe  The youth who leads the Argonautic band  Leaps to the shore A winged troop of Loves  Around his head their purple torches wave  While Juno nuptial goddess looks from heav'n  And o'er his graces sheds celestial light  Him soon behold that trembling maid accosts  The colours vary on her virgin cheek  Entranc'd she gazes credulous she hears  Her plighted vows her love to his she joins  Her aiding magic to his warlike arm  Her and the golden fleece a double prize  He bears away There weeping from his deek  Behold her take an everlasting leave  Of friends of parents of her native dwelling  To him entrusting all Incurious man  Thou dost not ask their names  MELAMPUS  Their names  ENCHANTRESS  That virgin  Was once the wise Medea He is Jason  The brave the beauteous allsurpassing Jason  MELAMPUS  Detested name  ENCHANTRESS  Look up another scene  Requires thy notice  The figure of Love sinks A third representing  TIME  rises with a mirror  There his father's house  Receives them Juno looks from heav'n again  To bless their nuptial bedNow view two children  Fruit of his loveOn her maternal lap  Note their disporting innocence He casts  A tender look Contentment seems to reign  When all impairing Time dissolves the ties  Of constancy and truth He quits Iolcos  See him in Corinth wedding Creon's daughter  Why gush those sorrows from thy flooded eyes  Why burst those notes of anguish from thy soul  Why dost thou rivet with convulsive grasp  Those hands together Yet in deeper tones  Of heartfelt anguish must that bosom sound  Those eyes be delug'd with a stronger tide  Those hands in sharper agony be wrung  The figure of Time sinks A  FURY  ascends with a mirror  Look where to madness hurry'd by the Furies  The lost Medea draws the murd'rous blade  Fresh from the re  king bowels of her children  Melampus  in consternation and horror lets fall his shield and spear She instantly lays her wand on his head He sinks down in a trance She throws herself upon him  Oh Jason Jason O ye faint remains  Of all which nature form'd in man most lovely  How is that visage worn How chang'd by care  Pale pale my hero is that seat of graces  And all its lustre dead Alas sad ruin  Thou know'st not who enfolds thee and this kiss  Giv'n in despight of Juno's stern command  Thou dost not feelThou sleep'stTo me thou ow'st  That rest so long forbidden to thy brow  Thy lance deserted gave thee to my wand  That wand hath sav'd thee thy Medea's love  Once more hath sav'd thee and deny'd access  To swift distraction hov'ring o'er thy brain  Thunder  I hear thee chiding goddess  She rises  Yet no longer  In these sepulchral shadows shall he lie  Avaunt ye horrors  The scene changes to the garden and palace again  Blasted be my arts  O execrable series of enchantments  So strongly wove by unforgiving pride  That not my pity not imperial Juno  Were she appeas'd nor Demogorgon's pow'r  Could he relent the texture can unwind  He only must unweave it and at last  Looking on  Melampus  May sail by some involuntary error  So hath capricious sorcery contriv'd  Yet shalt not thou offend him with thy beams  Meridian sun Ye laurell'd shades appear  Attend ye myrtles o'er his head embower  Sost winds refresh him and persume him roses  A bower rises round  Melampus  SCENE V  Enchantress and  CASSANDANE  from the palace in tears  ENCHANTRESS  Poor Cassandane sorrowful like me  Stands weeping yonder Restless too with terror  She courts my beck'ning hand Approach dear maid  To dry those tears and calm that sighing breast  This morn I gave thee entrance Dost thou fear  CASSANDANE  How can I fear such goodness But thy power  Stupendous in achievement hath depress'd  My griefworn senses Thunder at thy call  Peal'd in my ears blue lightnings dimm'd my sight  Earth felt thy foot and shook like Cassandane  ENCHANTRESS  For thee and me these talents I exert  Griefworn both labour with resembling evils  Mine yet are undiscover'd Thine I know  Thy noble father's suff'rings too I know  And long have pity'd Be compos'd  CASSANDANE  I am  When thou art near me  ENCHANTRESS  In the present hour  We must be near each other must unite  In mutual efforts  CASSANDANE  Mutual efforts How  Why in this hour  ENCHANTRESS  The crisis of our fates  Is nigh  CASSANDANE  I tremble What of thine and mine  ENCHANTRESS  Of both Look there  Pointing to  Melampus  CASSANDANE  starts then with her eyes fixed upon him speaks  Dead Dead That sorm of manhood  Erect and noble which allur'd my eye  And melted thine as winding through thy groves  His glances reach'd thy palace is reduc'd  To clay and soon will dissipate in dust  My tongue was feeble to describe his sorrows  And to appease thy anger strove in vain  Forgive fresh tears and wonder  ENCHANTRESS  Faultless virgin  Why dost thou ask forgiveness  CASSANDANE  Blind to science  I never trac'd the spangled robe of night  Nor knew the power of numbers Though the meads  Yield their mysterious plants to hurt or heal  I with unheeding ignorance pass by  If I misjudge of thy transcendent works  O'erlook my want of knowledge But this deed  ENCHANTRESS  What deed my Cassandane  CASSANDANE  Spare my weakness  Perhaps my soul grows wild with admiration  My senses harass'd may forget their functions  My sight deceive meThou art still the sage  Rever'd for justice and proclaim'd divine  ENCHANTRESS  Well may thy wonder be forgiv'n My praise  Waits on thy gen'rous tears But gentle damsel  Be not thus soon discourag'd Ev'ry hour  With prodigy is charg'd He only sleeps  On whom our common destiny depends  CASSANDANE  What can I answer Knowledge is thy part  Belief is mine Who is he  ENCHANTRESS  One whose arm  And dauntless magnanimity controll'd  My fiercest guards  CASSANDANE  Yet wherefore lies he stretch'd  In this deep slumber which too well resembles  The last to mortals  ENCHANTRESS  Thou shalt know hereafter  CASSANDANE  Alas how wan his aspect  ENCHANTRESS  Wan indeed  CASSANDANE  Well might I rank him in the train of death  How worn and wither'd  ENCHANTRESS  Scarce in manhood ripe  Yet old in sorrow  CASSANDANE  Thou dost melt again  These gushing tears new mystery contain  But I submissive will suspend inquiry  ENCHANTRESS  Ah Cassandane didst thou know his merits  And half his griefs thy tenderness would pour  A sea of pity on that livid face  He now three years invincible of men  Each barb'rous nation each inclement sky  Hath brav'd redress and peace to all imparting  All but himself  CASSANDANE  And rests my future peace  On him  ENCHANTRESS  Him singly  CASSANDANE  Let me then awake him  To hear my mournful story  ENCHANTRESS  Damsel stay  He must be waken'd to severe probation  Not of his strength and courage but his virtue  If there he triumph thou wilt soon accost him  But thy deportment must be fram'd by me  O hitherto victorious may the balm  To  Melampus  Of Morpheus brace thy constancy with firmness  This magic weapon hath perform'd its office  Taking up the spear  Thy might hath conquer'd Selfsustaining truth  Must triumph next and scorn enchantment's aid  Sweet friend remove this jav'lin to the palace  CASSANDANE  Thou seem'st in agitation I would stay  Weak as I am with thy permission stay  To sooth thy trouble or to share and weep  ENCHANTRESS  I trust thou wouldst But leave me for a while  CASSANDANE  Ah me  ENCHANTRESS  Still fearful  CASSANDANE  Separate from thee  I am all weakness  ENCHANTRESS  Thy harmonious guard  Will not sorsake thee He shall greet thine eye  For the first time  CASSANDANE  Ah rather let me hear  Than see him  ENCHANTRESS  He no sooty birth of darkness  But genius fair of Caucasus delights  To lay the ruffled Caspian with his song  He charms the vulture respiting the pains  Of torn Prometheus nor to me less kind  Ofttimes alleviates my o'erburden'd hours  With his entrancing measures He well pleas'd  Obeys my summons never better pleas'd  Than to attend on purity like thine  SCENE VI  ENCHANTRESS CASSANDANE  and the Genius  ENCHANTRESS  Be visible good being Sing of hope  To Cassandane Let thy voice which lulls  The floods and tempests harmonize her thoughts  The Genius sings  O Hope without thee life is pain  Shed on this maid thy chosen sweets  Nor less thy influence extend  To her whose virtues here preside  ENCHANTRESS  To me Hope sings in vain Severe suspense  I feel too heavy for her flutt'ring pinion  Genius sings to the Enchantress walking to and fro  Cretics and Trochaics  Ah no more woo despair  Mounted on a serpent green  Through the clouds Circe glides  By her birds in gorgeous plumes  Juno drawn hovers nigh  On their aspect smiles are seen  Droop no more Hope descends  ENCHANTRESS  Their smiles I trust not Leave me gentle maiden  Thou and thy guardian not less good than powerful  SCENE VII  ENCHANTRESS  Grim Demogorgon eldest thou of beings  Whose name no pow'r celestial dares pronounce  Who spread'st in darker lower gloom than hell  Thy black pavilion direful as thou art  Thou hast been foil'd Thy terrors could not awe  My Jason's soul triumphant most when yielding  To her own righteous feelings But alas  Your part insidious goddesses I fear  Whate'er is soft'ning to unbend the mind  Or fair and lovely to solicit sense  Whate'er is dazzling to awake ambition  Whate'er persuasive dress'd in specious duty  To cozen guileless honour into error  You have contriv'd But Juno should he fail  To catch the glimpses of reviving bliss  Which now are trembling on a point of chance  Think not Medea longer will remain  Repeating curses hurling her upbraidings  On destiny and Heav'n Thy rapid lightning  May strike th' uplifted poniard from my hand  Among the thousand avenues to death  One will I find then lay my burden down  Of evils grown too mighty for complaint  END OF THE THIRD ACT  ACT IV  SCENE I  MELAMPUS  asleep in the arbour which disappears at a symphony of music and the approach of a Nymph  She sings  FANCY brighter than the Graces  Who dost guide the tuneful Nine  Wanton o'er this sleeping hero  And before his waking soul  Hold in dreams thy artful mirror  Stor'd with Pleasure's various forms  Melampus  wakes and the Nymph vanishes  SCENE II  MELAMPUS  Deceitful strains O rather from my brow  Had slumber started at a bursting cloud  A torrent's hoarseness or the din of arms  These might perhaps reanimate my soul  Who now prefers a feeble pray'rto learn  If yet her cup of misery be full  SCENE III  MELAMPUS  A bright cloud advances towards the front of the stage  Song from the cloud  Trochaic measure  Youth dissolve thy cares in pleasure  Look where halfattir'd the damsels  Tripping round that glassy fountain  Smile and proffer sweet endearment  Each contending for thy choice  MELAMPUS  turning to the sidescene  I see a glassy fountain I discern  A troop of damsels azureey'd like morn  Blithe as the spring like summer glowing ripe  In garments loosely waving But I hear  Or seem to hear thy warnings sage Madauces  And thus exclude the wantons from my sight  He lifts his mantle before his eyes and turns aside The cloud opens and discovers the figures of Venus and Cupid  Venus sings  Then to me exalt thy raptures  Me the queen of love and beauty  See my son to cure thy anguish  Hero come Divine embraces  Woo thee to Idalian bow'rs  MELAMPUS  A languor breath'd in odours from that cloud  Allurement stealing through my eyes and ears  Melt down my spirit Longsuppress'd desires  Wake in my heart and constancy is wav'ring  Now Themis strengthen thy halfvanquish'd soldier  Let me retreat and plunge in deepest shades  He withdraws and the cloud disappears  SCENE IV  Song from behind the scenes  Filial rev'rence pious duty  Jove hath planted in the soul  Turn thee Jason turn and bow thee  Lo thy father's regal step  Melampus  reenters  SCENE V  MELAMPUS  and  AESON  who leads a Woman veiled and in sumptuous attire  MELAMPUS  My father Aeson  AESON  Yes thou seest thy father  Remit thy wonder and attend my son  A learn'd Thessalian charmer at my pray'r  Devis'd this maze of marvels to confine  Thy restless valour till my fault'ring steps  Might reach and stop thee in thy fruitless wand'rings  A vessel lies in readiness to waft thee  Return to blessings and forget Medea  MELAMPUS  starting  Forget Medea That were still to copy  Th' ingratitude of Aeson who accepted  The gift of empire and forgot the giver  Then tore each wreath of honour from his son  And cast him down a precipice of shame  Whence never never can he rise again  AESON  Though deaf to duty yield to virtuous love  Behold thy virgin bride in Creon's daughter  The woman unveils  MELAMPUS  Creüsa  CREUSA  Jason thou hast cause to marvel  When thou behold'st the queen of Corinth here  On this chaste lap thy weary head shall rest  My voice shall lull thee while the tempest roars  My fond endearments shorten tedious time  Till Neptune's wat'ry deserts thou hast pass'd  To sit illustrious on the throne of Greece  Melampus  attempting to speak is prevented by a full concert of music  Song from behind the scenes  Dance around ye blooming Graces  Sprotive Loves and purple Hymen  Hither bring your lyres ye Muses  This unrivall'd pair recording  First of heroes brightest queen  SCENE VI  MELAMPUS AESON CREUSA  and the three Graces who dance to the harps of the Muses then Hymen with his torch accompanied by a band of Cupids with torches likewise Hymen and one of the Graces dance  MELAMPUS  If ye be phantoms with contempt I grect ye  If ye be realdrive me not to madness  My children's ghosts already glide before me  AESON  My son  CREUSA  My love Look on me wedded lord  MELAMPUS  A frozen figure moulded from the snows  Which chill That mountain's summit would attract  Such looks as mine to thee  AESON  O griefdevoted  Canst thou refuse dominion wealth and beauty  CREUSA  Canst thou refuse Creüsa  MELAMPUS  Though thy hand  That hand usurping once Medea's right  Bore to my lips a taste of Lethe's streams  Which with oblivion cleanse the troubled mind  The liquid comfort I would dash aside  And my own sorrows to thy love prefer  While them I cherish virtue may return  Aeson Creüsa  c all vanish  SCENE VII  MELAMPUS  Are ye no more than shadows O my heart  Art thou not less encumber'd Sure a dawn  Of consolation seems to break upon thee  Or dost thou cheat thyself  Music from a harp  What strains are these  So much resembling those mellifluous notes  Which my companion Orpheus from his lyre  Was wont to raise when Argo plough'd the deep  And raptur'd Nereids follow'd while his voice  In celebrating songs of Jason's deeds  O'er the smooth'd ocean floated on the breeze  And ev'ry star had cast its cloudy veil  Song from behind the scenes  Virtue only source of good  From the breast awhile remov'd  Leaves a watchful guard behind  Conscience to secure the heart  If he opens once the gate  She will soon access regain  Blissful change when light to gloom  And to horror joy succeeds  MELAMPUS  Celestial sounds of transport from my ear  So long withheld O Virtue dost thou smile  Again on Jason Purest goddess stay  While thy returning influence I feel  Let me not sink in horrible amaze  How I who once possess'd could ever lose thee▪  SCENE VIII  MELAMPUS  and  CASSANDANE  appearing at a distance with the Genius of Caucasus  The Genius sings  Greet the hero trembling maid  He alone redress can yield  Let not fear thy pace retard  Nor sit heavy on thy tongue  MELAMPUS  I hear again the same Orphean voice  But what new image of excelling beauty  Steps from the grove Perhaps the captive princess  Orontes loves and I am bound to rescue  My spear is gone Those formidable mirrors  Disarm'd my trembling and unwary hand  Yet was that weapon well exchang'd for peace  Of mind that best security within  Jove and his handmaid Nature will sustain  The sortitude they gave me and complete  My gen'rous purpose She advances nearer  Fair sojourner in these fantastic shades  If thou art she whose loss Orontes mourns  And whom a pow'r unnatural confines  Within these charm'd enclosures not in vain  Have I o'erturn'd their barrier to replace thee  In native freedom and a monarch's love  CASSANDANE  O warrior crown'd with merited success  Who dost protect the innocent and injur'd  There is no other in this wild recess  Who wants like me assistance In two hours  Wilt thou depute Orontes to this place  MELAMPUS  Wilt thou be here  CASSANDANE  Be confident I will  MELAMPUS  Who shall I say enjoins me  CASSANDANE  If my words  Thou dost deliver thou perform'st enough  MELAMPUS  Th' unhappy monarch is enthrall'd by demons  CASSANDANE  He shall have freedom So from me assure him  MELAMPUS  Why this my sterious secret of thy name  CASSANDANE  Why who art thou most generous of men  That thus undaunted hazardest thy life  To vindicate the injur'd  MELAMPUS  One who long  Dead to the sense of gladness in himself  That peace he wanted hath to others giv'n  And from their comfort sometimes hath enjoy'd  A transitory interval from pain  But ne'er so full and lasting as this day  When he relieves thy beauties from their bondage  CASSANDANE  Fain would I know and soften thy afflictions  At least deplore them in a grateful tear  MELAMPUS  From each inquietude I mean to raise thee  In blooming joy produce thee to my friend  And not depress thee by a tale of woc  Yet as the king distracted by the fiend  Hath left thy name unmention'd thou explain  Who is the injur'd fair my fortune saves  CASSANDANE  Know then deserving stranger since that question  Thou urgest further I am charg'd to answer  That not thy welfare less than mine depends  On my concealment from thee at this crisis  MELAMPUS  I am inur'd to wonders but fair captive  Thou dost in mystery surpass them all  I press to know thee thou art charg'd to answer  That both my welfare and thine own depend  On thy concealment from me at this crisis  What crisis What concurrence of events  Can interweave our fortunes Both produc'd  In distant climates never till this hour  Held converse  CASSANDANE  Spare me and forgive my silence  MELAMPUS  Say who hath charg'd thee  CASSANDANE  Ask the learn'd Enchantress  Before I see Orontes she will greet thee  Meantime remain in you higharching bow'r  MELAMPUS  The learn'd Enchantress May her name be told  CASSANDANE  Throughout this spacious region is she known  By no distinction but of learn'd and good  MELAMPUS  Is she this region's native  CASSANDANE  No  MELAMPUS  Whence come  CASSANDANE  Past my conjecture though two years are fled  Since in a chariot dragonyok'd  MELAMPUS  What say'st thou  CASSANDANE  I say a chariot drawn by winged dragons  With blazing nostrils through the air convey'd  Her form divine The nations look'd aghast  When on this brow of Caucasus she rested  Soon by her pow'r this edifice was rais'd  And soon her science veneration drew  Her virtues love from all the Caspian tribes  MELAMPUS  Her virtues  CASSANDANE  Yes her virtues have obtain'd  An appellation adequate to heav'n  Of wise and bounteous O like nature wise  And learn'd in all her works like dayspring pure  When not a cloud or steaming vapour taints  The orient splendour she is half ador'd  Through this wide region  MELAMPUS  aside  Can she be Medea  Vain thoughther gen'rous science had disclaim'd  The deeds of malice I have felt and seen  Some spell misleads this captive to admire  The tyranny which grieves her  CASSANDANE  Thou art musing  MELAMPUS  I am how she whose goodness thou proclaim'st  Should rob thy youth and innocence of freedom  Depute a lion to destroy a king  And still pursue him with inhuman torments  CASSANDANE  Still thou dost ask what cannot be reveal'd  MELAMPUS  From me thy benefactor thou dost hide  Thy name and wrongs extolling thy oppressor  What can I think My just suspicion whispers  That all is here fallacious what I see  But painted shadow what I hear but fable  And thou may'st prove but fleeting air at last  By magic fancy colour'd to display  All that is fair and amiable in nature  And on my frank credulity impose  CASSANDANE  My benefactor I confess thee hero  Thy doubts to banish lo my virgin hand  Giv'n to confirm my gratitude and prove  That I am real  MELAMPUS  holding her hand  I am here a stranger  Be not offended fair one at my caution  Which bound to search these mazes of delusion  Familiariz'd with spectres must endure  Till this tough knot of magic be unravell'd  And thou no clew wilt lend me  CASSANDANE  I must leave thee  Farewell most gallant courteous and humane  I praise thy conduct and can add no more  MELAMPUS  Mysterious virgin Though beyond enchantment  Thou dost perplex me I in all obey thee  SCENE IX  MELAMPUS  The good Enchantressso I heard her styl'd  The pow'r exerted would bespeak Medea's  Were it not mix'd with cruelty repugnant  To her untainted natureYet those dragons  With such from Corinth did she mount the clouds  I want thy lights Madauces more than ever  Kind fortune I perceive him with Orontes  SCENE X  MELAMPUS MADAUCES  and  ORONTES  MADAUCES  My son  MELAMPUS  I soon will satisfy thy friendship  Orontes hail Bless'd monarch I have found  Thy queen of graces lovelier than the dawn  Serenely rising on a night of storms  She cheers our labours with propitious smiles  ORONTES  Thou hast beheld her with enamour'd looks  And dost describe her in a lover's phrase  MELAMPUS  Dismiss thy fears Not all the arms of beauty  Not Juno's eye nor Cytherca's roses  Can touch my frozen heart  ORONTES  Then swear again  MELAMPUS  A second time  ORONTES  Yes swear a second time  MELAMPUS  To hallow'd Themis I repeat my oath  ORONTES  That she I love  MELAMPUS  Be render'd to thy arms  Within two hours expect her presence here  ORONTES  Then I forget my torments and the spurns  Of this injurious goblin  MELAMPUS  From those torments  She hath assur'd thy freedom  ORONTES  In two hours  Will she admit Orontes  MELAMPUS  On this spot  Art thou content  ORONTES  Thrice happy  MELAMPUS  Then reply  Whence sprang thy hasty and unjust suspicion  When thou requir'dst me to renew my oath  ORONTES  Forgive the ardour of impetuous love  And the high passions in a royal breast  MELAMPUS  Thou dost miscall the gen'rous flame of love  Nor feel'st the impulse of a noble passion  It was that eager genuine selfregard  Which fits beside a throne for ever doubting  The faithful hand of service yet devouring  The good procur'd by others and suppressing  The sense of obligation Come Orontes  A way with this companion not by nature  But coz'ning habit foster'd in a mind  Deserving better inmates  ORONTES  Ah again  I see the demon  MELAMPUS  He will soon forsake thee  But that internal worst of fiends control  Unfeeling pride thus give thy virtues freedom  SCENE XI  MELAMPUS  and  MADAUCES  MADAUCES  Where is thy jav'lin  MELAMPUS  Gone Yet I secure  Retire with me my station is that bow'r  MADAUCES  How fares thy mind  MELAMPUS  Why comforted though dubious  Pass to that arching bow'r I there  station'd  The story of my trials since we parted  May show me still entitled to thy care  And by the further guidance of thy knowledge  Through tenfold perils more from guile or force  I will attain to certainty at last  END OF THE FOURTH ACT  ACT V  SCENE I  The  ENCHANTRESS  veiled from the palace  MELAMPUS  from the grove  ENCHANTRESS  giving his spear  THIS staff was thine Receive it back from me  MELAMPUS  Thou tremblest I confounded by this gift  Which arms my hand against thee tremble too  They both continue motionless and silent after a pause  Melampus  proceeds  How awful is her silence Thou no longer  Behold'st a foe Still motionless and mute  Then I will speak My bosom shall discharge  Its load I mustO enterprise which more  Than all my former labours shakes my frame  Her structure tottersO majestic form  My restless prying anguish must inquire  If underneath that curtain thou dost veil  A face  ENCHANTRESS  Support me Jason  MELAMPUS  On my name  She callsShe saintsMysterious shade away  O earth and heaven My wife My injur'd wife  Who shall support me now Madauces aid me  SCENE II  ENCHANTRESS MELAMPUS  and  Madauces  MADAUCES  running to the  ENCHANTRESS  It is my royal mistress thy Medea  MELAMPUS  May not this prove illusion still Madauces  The last dire effort of defeated magic  At once to burst my agonizing heart  Yet here to die contemplating those seatures  Were more than I could ask th' offended gods  MADAUCES  No it is she That weapon she restor'd  Ere now had giv'n illusion to the winds  These are the lineaments divine revealing  The Sun's descendant Rouse thee be a man  Nor fear her wisdom will reproach thee now  Or fix its radiant eye on aught but joy  With equal fervour clasp her to thy heart  Nor with the tardy coldness of dejection  Debase the gen'rous flame  The  ENCHANTRESS  reviving fixes her eyes on  MELAMPUS  them rushes into his arms  My love My lord  O thou most comely in relumin'd virtue  O beauteous image in the sight of heaven  Come to my arms Be there secure to find  What "may dispel the sorcery of anguish  "And disenchant the bosom from despair  "That black magician in the mind" O Jasou  Now shall indeed these pure abodes unclose  Their blissful treasures these harmonious choirs  For thee alone Elysian music chaunt  Thee to refreshing banks these fountains call  To cheer thy virtuous labours  MELAMPUS  Let me fall  Before thy feet in penitential fervour  And celebrate to smiling heav'n the bounty  Of thy forgiving love O labours past  Ye seas and deserts Shapeless crags and rocks  Which fasting sleepless hopeless I have travers'd  How is your awful retrospect transform'd  To glowing pictures of ecstatic joy  My wifeMedeaIs my soul secure  This is not still enchantmentDoth Medea  Once more embrace her Jason  ENCHANTRESS  Oh my heart  Will flow in doating fondness till the gods  In envy dash these more than mortal raptures  MELAMPUS  What can allay them This unweary'd arm  Which through ten thousand hazards hath regain'd  These joys at last now govern'd by thy wisdom  Shall awe ill fortune and protect the blessing  MADAUCES  There spoke a manly ardour which became  The mouth of Jason to Aeetes' daughter  ENCHANTRESS  O thou most learn'd and faithful of my Colchians  Who heretofore accompany'd my wand'rings  My counsellor and friend thy love to me  And thy continu'd kindness to my Jason  How shall I e'er compensate when alas  Too soon thy counsels we may want again  Still on a precipice we stand Madauces  MELAMPUS  A precipice  MADAUCES  Proceed my honour'd mistress  ENCHANTRESS  Oh hear Both hear and weigh your answers well  When I left Corinth to Aectes' sister  My dragonyoke convey'd me On her isle  In solemn consult was a year consum'd  To weave these spells propos'd by rigid Circe  Approv'd by Juno by the Sun my grandsire  And there obdurate Demogorgon lent  Each baleful engine of capricious magic  To prove the worth of Jason or destroy  To  Madauces  These goddesses have watch'd him from the hour  He too embark'd from Corinth to replace  Phaeacia's virgins and my friendly train  Of ancient Colchians in their native homes  E'en till these wilds of Caucasus he reach'd  MELAMPUS  Have I not since surmounted ev'ry toil  ENCHANTRESS  Ah while thy strenuous heart is thus triumphant  E'en while I strain thee to my longing bosom  Perhaps the keenest struggle is to come  MELAMPUS  No let them bring my spirit to the proof  I too will struggle with persisting valour  Not with despondent loathing of the day  As heretofore but warm in hope of bliss  Of conquest since Medea is the prize  ENCHANTRESS  Thou hast perform'd what valour can accomplish  Our ills if any are conceiv'd already  And must irrevocably rise to birth  One inadvertent casual error past  Since thy approach to this enchanted structure  From our own grasp may wrest the present bliss  At once subjected to some will unknown  To us perhaps inflexible Madauces  Thou recollecting ev'ry word and deed  Since first he enter'd these enchanted purlieus  Unfold the series of his bold exploit  MADAUCES  Then I proclaim your happiness complete  And I begin attesting ev'ry pow'r  E'en Circe Juno and thy bright forefather  That clearest honour and unerring prudence  Have govern'd Jason's mind his heart his actions  ENCHANTRESS  to  MELAMPUS  Then we will yet be happy Do not droop  My words might well dismay thee Rest thy head  On this fond bosom Thou art pale and sad  Soon will my love efface that livid hue  And with renewing freshness spread thy cheek  Those careindented surrows shall be fill'd  By joyous health and youth's returning light  Disperse the gloom which hides thy wonted beauty  MELAMPUS  Till thou hast heard our story and thyself  Hast sat in judgment harass'd long by care  And long acquainted with these froward spells  I droop I sink in terror on thy bosom  MADAUCES  I see Orontes  ENCHANTRESS  He the first should know  That his protector is Medea's lord  SCENE III  ENCHANTRESS MELAMPUS MADAUCES  and  ORONTES  ORONTES  entering  Death to my sight O perfidy  MADAUCES  What means  The king so lately reseu'd from perdition  ORONTES  To thee old man my injur'd love appeals  That this perfidious by repeated oaths  To me resign'd the fairone I adore  And I beheld him now profane her beauties  Within his false embrace  ENCHANTRESS  Hath Jason sworn  MADAUCES  Not knowing thou wert she Orontes woo'd  ENCHANTRESS  This is the fatal inadvertent error  O goddesses implacable I hear you  Again your whisper'd mandates thrill my heart  Which must perform th'inhuman task enjoin'd  In mercy yet uproot these pond'rous hills  Beneath their bases crush this hateful spot  Unbosom hell and change th' embow'ring shades  To vaults of sulphur and devouring fire  Or with the Caspian from its bottom roll'd  O'erwhelm your own creation of distress  Oh Jason JasonWe must part again  MELAMPUS  Dost thou pronounce that doom  ENCHANTRESS  I doI must  ORONTES  My hopes revive  ENCHANTRESS  to  MELAMPUS  Contest not search not hush  Complaint and leave me  MELAMPUS  To ordain my fate  Thou art entitledTo contest thy will  Were to renew past guiltYe pow'rs combin'd  For my destruction instant let your spells  I ask no more erect a tomb for Jason  My sight is clos'd my heart already clay  Madauces bear me to the fun'ral pile  ENCHANTRESS  Speed hence MadaucesYet in me confide  SCENE IV  ENCHANTRESS  and  ORONTES  ENCHANTRESS  My cruel part is over Now O king  In supplication I address thy pity  Me till this hour from benefits alone  Show'r'd on thy throne and subjects dost thou know  ORONTES  Which more endear'd thy beauties to my soul  ENCHANTRESS  Forbear that theme and listen when I tell thee  I am Medea daughter of Aeetes  Thy royal neighbour whom the Sun begot  Yon poor forlorn one is my wedded lord  Three years divided by a fatal chance  This day we met on hard conditions met  Which his unguarded oath to thee hath broken  That oath if thou release not  ORONTES  Love forbid  Dost thou require me to relinquish thee  Thee now a royal progeny confess'd  Thence more deserving of my throne and bed  ENCHANTRESS  Yet think again  ORONTES  I do divine Medea  And were he free from treachery's black stain  Nor had abus'd a monarch's ear with falsehood  ENCHANTRESS  Believe me he is guiltless  ORONTES  If he were  In competition with a monarch's peace  How can a wand'ring warrior's claim be rank'd  ENCHANTRESS  That claim is mine Thy benefactress sues  She who corrected nature from the womb  Of barren earth sertility upcall'd  Chas'd from thy borders pestilence and death  And to thy kingdom provinces united  Sues to thy justice gratitude and honour  For her sole comfort  ORONTES  Thou may'st learn to love  And must at last prefer the chief of princes  ENCHANTRESS  Perdition seize thee harden'd and ingrate  Though thou o'erlook'st the services and worth  Of Pherendates thy victorious captain  Who with my aiding counsels tam'd thy foes  Unaw'd by justice though thy callous heart  Hath dar'd to break the tend'rest ties of faith  Dost thou presume thou glitt'ring mote thou pageant  Thou to whose mind the purest lights of heav'n  Fair truth and wisdom never gain'd access  Dar'st thou gross child of ignorance aspire  To mix thy darkness with Medea's flame  Or hope that she would condescend in love  To a mere monarch and forsake a hero  ORONTES  How art thou chang'd from gentleness to rage  Still in thy anger lovely and belov'd  ENCHANTRESS  True thou hast known me gentle and benign  Till in the circle of these magic walls  Thy hateful importunity confin'd me  Now shalt thou find me terrible and wielding  A vengeful rod too mighty for thy sceptre  Not Pherendates loyal in disgrace  Embattling all thy myriads to redeem thee  Could with an empire's force encounter mine  Their strength should wither and their banners fall  At one vibration of this pow'rful wand  She waves her wand The scene changes to a Cavern terminated by a mouth which represents an opening to the Infernal Regions  ORONTES  Is there no sanctity in kings No guardian  By Heav'n appointed to protect them  ENCHANTRESS  None  But in all breasts a judge severe is plac'd  By Heav'n appointed to chastise or warn  Him not the sceptre's weight the leader's staff  Nor gemm'd tiara which the nations fear  Him not the arm'd battalions round a throne  Nor purpled satraps who in homage stoop  Can awe to silence or with flatt'ry sooth  Kings may refuse his dictates to obey  But cannot shun his rod  ORONTES  Tremendous woman  Light fled before her I am plung'd in darkness  ENCHANTRESS  Bring the blue fire of Phlegethon ye fiends  Make horror visible your torches wave  Dipp'd in Tartarean sulphur  While she walks up and down waving her wand the mouth discharges fire several Demons leap out some with blazing vases full of fire others with torches a Tomb ascending at the same time through the middle of the stage  ENCHANTRESS  to  ORONTES  King behold  This is thy couch thy table and thy tomb  There night by night shall demons lay thy head  There spread thy rueful banquet to the light  Of this thy only dayspring this pale flame  And when thy thread of misery is spent  They shall thy silent obsequies perform  And there deposit thy unwept remains  Unless thy heart revisited by honour  To gratitude be melted and renew  Longbroken faith That moment sets thee free  SCENE V  ORONTES  I should surpass what flatt'ry e'er proclaim'd me  Did I not shudder at this direful sentence  Ha Recollection thy tumultuous throbs  Beat on my heart a summons to remorse  She comes I feel her here with sorrow shame  And late repentance in her ghastly train  Combining all with these external terrors  I feel my error my neglect of merit  I sink beneath them and the heavier weight  Of my own black reflections  Dance of Fiends  I feel my broken vows Fall'n fall'n Orontes  A monumental dungeon is thy palace  Captivity thy state and fiends thy guard  Who shake their inextinguishable fires  To keep my fears awakeMelampus save me  MelampusBlack ingratitude be dumb  Dare not profane that name or hope his succour  O tomb my only place of rest receive me  SCENE VI  ORONTES  and  CASSANDANE  veiled with the Genius of Caucasus by her side  Genius sings as he enters to a lute behind the scenes  Trochaics  Dreary mansion of the dead  Yield to innocence access  Through thy dust of mould'ring bones  Beauty steps with me her guard  ORONTES  Can harmony be here Sweet voice which sings  Of innocence and beauty canst thou breathe  Through tainted bosoms purity of feeling  And charm the mind's deformity away  A graceful image penetrates the gloom  Ah do not come a phantom of illusion  Nor with deceit accumulating woe  Pollute the promise of thy specious mien  CASSANDANE  As thy good genius am I come O king  To show thy restless feet the paths of peace  ORONTES  Then my good genius thou may'st well be styl'd  Whoe'er thou art  CASSANDANE  To pity frame thy mind  A gen'rous sense of benefits recall  The gate of virtue leads alone to peace  ORONTES  O Pherendates I too late acknowledge  Thy toils thy wounds thy conquests for Orontes  CASSANDANE  Thou didst his daughter of her heart beguile  Then to another form thy love transfer  ORONTES  It is for her the lion hath assail'd me  Enchantments harass'd and the demon haunted  CASSANDANE  unveiling and kneeling  And her thou see'st before her sov'reign's feet  ORONTES  embracing her at which the scene changes to the garden and all the Fiends descend  My Cassandane O what pow'r convey'd thee  To quell these horrors fix my wav'ring soul  And backward turn my steps whose errors touch'd  Ingratitude and guilt Discrectest maid  More to thy prudence is Orontes bound  Than to thy father's valour What could blind me  To leave that sost serenity of beauty  And court the lightning of Medea's eye  How cam'st thou hither But explain hereafter  The Genius sings  Creties  How she came I unfold  Faithful love was her guide  Trochaics  I the ruling genius here  Fly to celebrate thy bliss  SCENE VII  ORONTES  and  CASSANDANE  ORONTES  Auspicious voice I bless thee Cassandane  Fly to MelampusThou before hast seen him  And to dissuse selicity around  With sweetest fraud deceiv'd him  CASSANDANE  Gracious lord  I was instructed by the good Enchantress  Nor told my name too conscious in that period  That had Melampus to thy ears divulg'd me  Thou wouldst have slighted Pherendates' daughter  ORONTES  They to the proffer'd blessing had been shut  Too just reproach Go tell Melampus all  Dwell on the dear narration till thou gain'st  That matchless hero's pardon for my sault  I will conduct Medea to his arms  SCENE VIII  ORONTES  and the Enchantress  How shall I hail thee That I now restore  Wrong'd Pherendates and espouse his daughter  Do not impute to coward fear nor hold me  Less than becomes a king  ENCHANTRESS  I hold thee greater  Girt by a council now which gods revere  By equity beneficence and wisdom  And now convinc'd thy danger from the lion  Thy doleful bower the sternness of Melampus  My wrath and indignation wilt thou bless  Adversity's deepsearching hand was wanting  To weed thy bosom force its worth to ripeness  And thy imperial state with virtue crown  Which shall exalt thee sar beyond thy titles  SCENE IX  ORONTES  the Enchantress  MADAUCES  and  CASSANDANE  led by  MELAMPUS  ORONTES  presenting the Enchantress to  MELAMPUS  Inimitable hero let this gift  Repair my errors  MELAMPUS  Royal friend my labours  Thou hast o'erpaid  ENCHANTRESS  Adversity though bitter  Medicinal to frailty we have felt  And been corrected all Our future days  Let us devote to rational delights  And contemplation King of kings Orontes  Thou may'st hereafter from thy potent throne  With moral rapture traverse in remembrance  Each suff'ring past and error's bonds dissolv'd  Thou dearest hero rising pure from trials  Shalt cease from labours thou shalt walk with science  And in the tranquil fellowship of wisdom  Possess the morning sweets and ev'ning's calm  In these untroubled shades  CASSANDANE  What sudden blaze  Of light  MADAUCES  From Circe Juno and the Sun  CASSANDANE  The Genius too of Caucasus returns  SCENE X  ORONTES  the Enchantress  MADAUCES CASSANDANE MELAMPUS  the Sun appearing over the palace  CIRCE

appears a beautiful hill The Genius of Caucasus descends and leads the Guardian Intelligences of woods waters and mountains Soft music  The Genius sings  Nymphs of Asia's spicy groves  Of her fruitempurpled hills  Of their flow'ryborder'd streams  Warbling over beds of gold  Genii who the mountains range  Whence the cedar's spire ascends  Piercing Asia's radiant sky  Lift your feet your voices tune  Celebrate in dance and song  Her predicted fame and sway  ENCHANTRESS  I feel an impulseAll my sabric shakes  A flame from those divinities pervades  My struggling breast and prophecy is there  Its rapture burnsThe gods expand my voice  And by their presence ratify the sound  Not for inaction Jason's worth is prov'd  A bright example to imperfect man  Of patient suff'ring and recover'd truth  He shall with fame be recompens'd and empire  Unconquerable he from hostile arms  The reconcil'd Aeetes shall desend  And by his merit deisy his name  From Cassandane shall a daughter spring  She shall espouse Medea's future son  Who Med  s call'd shall found a mighty throne  Which shall o'ershadow all the eastern world  THE END  NEW PUBLICATIONS  printed for  J DEBRETT  TRAVELS in
