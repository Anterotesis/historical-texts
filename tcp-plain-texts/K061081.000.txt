and good Fortune to the happy Influence of your Ancestors I cannot but as a grateful Tribute pay these following Sheets to the Worthy Son of so Worthy a Father  I have this as the greatest Misfortune attending me that I have not the Honour to be Personally known to you Yet nothing cou'd have hinder'd my waiting on you to have paid those Acknowledgments that are owing to your Family but the Service of my King and Country that commands me away which if I fall in will be a sufficient Recompence for all the Hazards and  Dangers I have run which you will find in the succeeding Pages But if Providence which I need not doubt from the many imminent Escapes I have had returns me safe to my Native Country I hope you will excuse my Boldness if I endeavour to let you know the Obligations that are incumbent upon  Your most Obedient Humble Servant R Falconer  PREFACE  _I Am told that a Book without a Preface is like a New Play without a Prologue or a  French  Dinner without Soup and tho' I cannot tell what to say yet I am resolv'd to say something tho' perhaps not any thing to the Purpose So far I hope you'll allow me to be an Author I shall give you gentle Reader if you are so Three of my Reasons why I publish these following Pages which I must confess are not so well polish'd as I cou'd wish but Truth is amiable tho' in Rags The first and chiefest to get Money for tho' I have a considerable Income yet I can never bring both points together at the Year's End but however don't blame my Oeconomy since I owe you nothing and if I am beholden to any Body it is to Honest  Chetwood

if my Book does not sell Second to save my Lungs and a great deal of Trouble in repeating to  my Friends these following Adventures for now they may at a small Expence get 'em by Heart if they will endeavour to stretch their Memories Third and lastly to appear in Print which was I assure you a great Motive with me as well as with a great many others of the same Rank that make Work for many Printers tho' as little to the Purpose as my self I cou'd give a Catalogue of some of 'em but that wou'd be making my Preface exceed the Bulk of my Book Tho' I cou'd put the Booksellers in a Way to save Money in their Pockets and that is to persuade a great many Authors to print their Lucubrations at their own Charge and that might make some of the poorest to desist but for the richer Sort of Authors there's no Help it's like the Itch and they must write to be scratch'd tho' the Blood comes The following Sheets however extraordinary they appear I assure you upon the Word of a Man are Truth

FALCONER BOOK I  _I WAS born at a Town call'd  Bruton  in  Somersetshire  of Parents tolerably well to pass in the World my Mother dy'd when I was very young My Father  Richard Falconer  had been a great Traveller in his Days and his frequently  repeating his Adventures abroad made me have a great Desire to follow his Steps I often begg'd he would let me go to Sea with some Captain of his Acquaintance but he would often say  Dick  stay where you are you know not the Hazard and Dangers attend a maritime Life You shall have a good Trade in your Belly and that will keep you from a Desire of rambling therefore tell me what Calling you like best that I may immediately put you out in Order to your living hereafter You know continu'd he that my Fortune is but small and I living to the extent of it it will not be possible for me to leave you wherewithal to support you without some Employment Therefore reply'd I as you have a Daughter you may leave your Substance to her she must be provided for as for our Sex we can best take Care for our selves and if you please but to fit me out to Sea even in what Station you think convenient it shall be all I will desire Son says my Father think no more of going to Sea for I'll not have it so I know it is only a Desire of Youth prone to change If I should give you leave I am assur'd one Week's Voyage would make you wish to be at home again I us'd all the Arguments my young Sense prompted me with but all to no purpose my Father was not to be mov'd and thus  I liv'd two Years longer with him in Expectation of his Mind altering At last an Accident happen'd that farther'd my Desires and tho' it was the Ruin of our Family I must confess I was not much concern'd  My Father was Supervisor of a Tax laid upon the burning of Pipes and he having gather'd a Sum of Money amounting to  l  in order to pay in to the Government for the King's Use was by an under Exciseman robb'd of the whole Sum who made his Escape My Father us'd all possible Means to apprehend him without Noise but all his Endeavours were fruitless so finding his Affairs in a desperate Condition resolv'd to retire to some Part of the World where he might be safe from the griping Hands of the Law One Morning just before his voluntary Exile he call'd me to him  Dick  says he you have been often desirous of going to Sea and I have always us'd Arguments to dissuade you from it but now since what has happen'd it being impossible for me to continue upon the Place of my Birth the Patrimony of my Ancestors I must e'en recommend that way of Life to you which I should never have chose but that the Exigency of my Affairs will not permit me to provide any other Way for  you Here continu'd he take this  l▪  which I can ill spare out of my little Fortune but since it is all I can do for you take it and may Heaven prosper thy Undertakings may the Blessing of a Father always live with you whose Prayers shall ever be sent to our Almighty Creator for thy Welfare Here added he is a Letter of Recommendation for you to Captain  Pultney  of  Bristol  whose Friendship I am sure will be of service to you With that he embrac'd me with Tears in his Eyes gave me his Blessing kiss'd me and took his leave for ever for never have my Eyes beheld him since  This Parting I think was the greatest Grief my Thoughts had ever known 'till then for nothing could be fonder or shew more paternal Affection than my dear Father at his last Farewel but the Joy of my being at Liberty to follow my own Desires soon drowned my Sorrow for parting with so good a Parent  I had now nothing to do but to provide my little Equipage in order to go to  Bristol  to my Father's Friend I pack'd up my Things in a Portmantua and gave them to an old Servant of my Father's who would see me as far as  Bristol  for his sake We set out in the Morning and reach'd it by Noon I enquir'd for  Captain  Pultney  and by good Fortune found him at his Dwelling House in  Ratcliff  Street he having remov'd himself from another Street which caus'd some Difficulty in the finding I acquainted him who I was and gave him my Father's Letter He read it and receiv'd me very kindly It was to this Effect  Dear  Pultney  I  Hope you'll forgive this Trouble of your Friend I have sent my Son to you in order to get him some Post by Sea I know it is in your Power to do it something has happen'd that hinders my providing for him as I ought I would have waited on you in Person but a Gap has happen'd in my Affairs that I shall never close again  Dick  will tell you all Let me conjure you by our old Friendship to take all the Care you can of him and whenever he comes to  England  let him come to you for as yet I know not where to lead my wretched Life so that I shall confide in you and let you know by a Letter or Messenger as soon as possible where I shall settle  Your most Faithful Friend and Servant R Falconer  Mr  Falconer  says the Captain I am heartily sorry for your Father's Misfortunes which he tells me in his Letter you will inform me of After I had given him the whole Story he told me he would provide for me as soon as possible and till then I should be as welcome to him as his own Son In the mean time says he I would have you verse your self in the Mathematicks which may be of use to you I'll take Care to provide you a Master and Instruments which accordingly he did and as I had a great Desire to be abroad and had some small Knowledge of it which I learn'd at School apart from my other Studies I soon attain'd to the Theory of it  After I had run through the Course of Mathematicks and the Captain was inform'd I was capable he got me to be Mate or rather Assistant on board the  Albion  Frigate Captain  Wase  Commander and on the  d  of  May  we set sail bound for  Jamaica  with a fair Wind As soon as we lost sight of Land I began to be extremely Seasick and bore the Jests of the Sailors but indifferently who cry'd There's an excellent Master'sMate he'll hit  Jamaica  to a Hair if the Island were no bigger than the Bunghole of a Cask I must confess I believe my self  to be the only Person who ever set out on his first Voyage as Master'sMate without having seen a River that was navigable But in a Day or two I was perfectly well and was never troubled with any Sickness afterwards  We had nothing material happen'd to us 'till we enter'd the Bay of  Biscay  where we were encounter'd with a dreadful Storm the Billows ran Mountains high and our Vessel seem'd to be the Sport of the Waves A Ship that overtook us the Day before and accompany'd us tho' it were not at Half a Furlong distance was sometimes lost by reason of the Heighth of the Waves The Storm continu'd with this Violence three Days and at last abated something of its Fierceness but still blew very hard The other Vessel by firing a Gun and making a Signal made it appear she was in distress but the Sea ran so high it was impossible to give them any Assistance yet we bore down to them being to windward as nigh as we could without Danger to our selves we enquir'd into the Matter and found she had sprung a Leak they had all Hands to pump by turns but yet the Water gain'd on them They begg'd of us to hoist out our Boat their own being stav'd to give them Succour upon occasion Accordingly we put out our  LongBoat with two of our Men in it but the Rope that held her to the Ship broke by the Violence of the Waves and drove away with the two unfortunate Men in her and what became of them we could never learn but undoubtedly they perish'd by the Sea or Hunger we being Leagues from any Shore The Ship after prodigious Labour of the Sailors and in less than ten Minutes sunk to the Bottom out of Fifty seven Men but Four were sav'd and they by good Fortune laid hold on Ropes we threw out for that Purpose but it had not been possible to save any if we had not bore down to Leeward when we saw them in the last Extremity And here we ought to admire at Providence For this very Vessel was a Pyrate one Captain  Jones  Commander who in an open large Boat set out from  Dover  and near  Ostend  stole upon a  French  Vessel in the Night murder'd the Captain and some others and set all the Sailors ashore that would not embrace their Designs and had resolv'd to attack us as soon as the Storm was over The Four Men that were sav'd were three  English  Men and one  French  Man who said they were forc'd with several others by the above mention'd Captain  Jones  to take to that Course of Life but whether  true or false I can't tell indeed they behav'd themselves very well with us all the Voyage and were enter'd into our Books as Four of the Ship's Crew instead of Two we left on Shore who were not to be found when we set sail and the two poor Wretches that were lost in the Boat The Storm still continu'd but the Wind fair so we ran it away with a riv'd Foresail all Night and the next Morning we had a violent Storm of Rain and some Thunder but about Noon the Sky clear'd up the Rain ceas'd and the Tempest was laid the Wind however continuing fair with a midling Gale  May  the th we discover'd the  Canaries  and the Pike of  Teneriff  and pass'd this Island or rather Rock of a prodigious Heighth At Night the Wind rose again and continu'd to blow very hard for two Days As I was walking on the Deck one Morning my Chops were saluted with a Fish which drop'd down I took it up panting at the Gills for Life it prov'd to be a flying Fish pursu'd as I suppose by some Dolphin or Albecore the Manner of these Fishes avoiding their Enemies is jumping out of the Water and flying 'till their Wings are dry then fall down again into the Sea The Dolphin that chases them is one of the finest  colour'd Fish that swims I have observ'd our Painters draw them bending like a Bow but I think it is as strait a Fish as any in the Sea We caught one of them with a Fizgig an Instrument made of several Rows of iron Spikes bearded like Hooks and a Staff four or five Foot long to it to this they tye a Cord of a great length and dart it with all their Strength the wounded Fish immediately flownces downward many Fathoms and up again which the Darter observes giving him Rope and Play 'till his Weakness makes him more tame then they draw him up the Ship'sside and cut him in Pieces The first we caught in this Manner was about six Foot long which we dress'd and part of it serv'd the whole Ship's Company for Dinner as soon as it was caught it lost that beautiful Colour it had in the Water as for my own Part notwithstanding their praising it I had rather eat a Herring or a Mackrel than this rare Fish I don't know whether these Fish can hear or love Musick but this I am sure of we had an excellent Trumpet on board which diverted us in good Weather and I have observ'd that at the Sound of it the Number of these Dolphins seem'd to encrease and swim within two Foot of our Vessel but that may be pure Accident  yet I fancy there's something in't that occasion'd the Fable of  Amphion  and the Dolphin Sharks are taken as we take common Fish only the Hook is about two Foot long and an iron Chain above that about four Foot long and a long Rope to that they generally bait the Hook with a Piece of Beef of three or four Pounds which the voracious Fish swallows immediately Hook and all then they give him play a while and when he is pretty well spent they draw him in with a Tackle There's always one stands ready with an Axe to make a Divorce between his Tail and his Body otherwise he would give such large Thumps with it that might do the Ship Damage I my self was thrown down but with a Touch of it This that we took had in his Paunch the Collarbone of a Man and a Boatswain's silver Whistle with a red Ribbon in it entire not so much as bruis'd which was given to me as a Present to make me amends for the Fall I receiv'd it may be seen at my Bookseller's if any one has the Curiosity to ask for it as to the Collarbone not any one would accept of it so I return'd it to the watry Element again  We past the  Tropick  attended by the  Tropick  Birds a Fowl something bigger than a Pidgeon but one would think as  it flies it had an unlighted Candle fix'd in its Tail I cannot let go the Ceremony of passing this  Tropick  When you are in the Latitude the old Sailors ask the rest of the Ship's Crew Whether they were ever that way before If not they must either pay a Bottle and Pound as they call it or be duck'd They that don't pay are fix'd to a Rope at the MainYardArm and duck'd three Times in the Sea at which the rest of the Crew Huzza and fire a Volley of Smallshot  When Admiral  Benbow  went with his Squadron of Men of War the whole Fleet duck'd but the Admiral gave 'em Notice by first firing a Gun which was immediately follow'd with a Volley of Muskets and Huzzaing by every Ship in the Fleet A Day or two before our Account is out we send a Man to the Topmasthead in order to discover Land where he stays an Hour and looks about him He that discovers it first is rewarded with a Bottle and Pound that is a Bottle of Rum and a Pound of Sugar which is demanded as soon as the Anchor is cast in a Place where such Commodities are to be had Now the Bottles and Pounds that accrue from the People that are not willing to be duck'd in passing the  Tropick  are reserv'd  by the old Sailors for a merry Bout when safe in Harbour which must not be touch'd by the fresh Men as they call 'em  July  the d our Man at the Topmasthead instead of crying Land as we expected call'd out A Sail a Sail which in a quarter of an Hour we discover'd plainly upon Deck We did not know what to think of it we knew we were near Land and consequently in fear of those Pyrates or Buccaniers that infest those Coasts Our Captain call'd all Hands aloft and told us Gentlemen 'Tis One to One but this Vessel we see may be a Pyrate if so how must we behave our selves If you are resolv'd to stand it I'll stand it to the last if not we'll surrender without firing a Gun which may induce 'em to be civil to us The Sailors cry'd Let's fight 'em let's fight 'em With that we put our Chests in the Hold and brought up our Hammocks to place 'em in the Netting on the QuarterDeck we clear'd our Guns which were Twelve and muster'd our Men which amounted to Thirtyeight Passengers and all who were as willing to fight as any of us they having something on Board that was valuable and some of 'em perhaps  all their Fortune We kept our Way and the Ship bore up to us with all the Sail she could make Night coming upon us our Man at the Topmasthead discover'd Land and another Ship to the Windward of us With that we call'd another Council and persisted in our first Opinion of fighting but yet to use all Means possible of making to Shore which was  Barbadoes  But for all our Endeavours the first Ship got up with us and about Twelve a Clock at Night hail'd us and commanded us to hoist out our Boat and come on Board him with our Captain We answer'd We had never a Boat as indeed we had not but we told him if he would stay till Morning something might be done At last he threatned to sink us if we wou'd not send our Captain aboard immediately and thereupon fir'd a Gun which struck our Vessel on her Quarter With that we fir'd our Broadside upon him accompany'd with some small Arms which they little expecting I believe did some Damage and put 'em in Confusion Whereupon we tack'd about and with our other six Guns rak'd her fore and aft but was immediately seconded with a Broadside from them which kill'd us two Men and wounded a third  Upon which with loud Huzza's and Firing they immediately boarded us on our StarboardQuarter and pour'd into us at least fourscore Men We resisted 'em with all the Force we had but all to no purpose they drove us into the Forecastle where by good Chance we made shift to barricade our selves but they threaten'd to turn our own Guns upon us if we did not surrender immediately But our Captain being resolute order'd us to fire upon 'em with our small Arms Now we had under the Greatings close to our Steerage a large Cistern lin'd with Tin where we had unwittingly plac'd several Cartriges of Powder but happily for us whether it was our Firing or in the Bustle some Match dropt in I know not but the Powder took fire blew up the Greatings with some part of the QuarterDeck and thirty of the Enemy at least into the Air Upon that we sally'd out and drove the rest with our Cutlashes into their own Vessel again with the loss of several But this signify'd little for with the Fall and Breach of our QuarterDeck the PowderRoom was entirely stopp'd up nor cou'd we without great Difficulty clear it from the Lumber so that we had not any Powder but what was in the Mens  Cartriges for their Muskets However we fir'd briskly with 'em yet nevertheless they prepar'd to Board us again with all the Menaces imaginable This Fight continu'd at least four Hours and the Dawn began to break upon us which discover'd to us the other Ship we saw over Night and we distinguish'd  English  Colours with that we gave a great Shout and fir'd our small Arms again The Enemy no sooner saw the Ship with  English  Colours but they cut off their GrapplingIrons and did their Endeavour to make off but their Rigging was so shatter'd that their Sails cou'd not be hoisted In the mean Time the other Ship came up to us and without hailing pour'd a Broadside into the Pyrate and there follow'd a desperate Fight between them As for our Ship it was of little Use so we steer'd off and clear'd our GunRoom and in half an Hour the Fight continuing all that while we had charg'd our Great Guns and return'd to the Fight but upon the Instant we saw the Pyrate sinking the  English  Ship had tore a Hole between Wind and Water that she sunk in a Moment and but eight Men sav'd who told us their Captain was a Pyrate from  Guadalupe  that when they were sinking they had not above twenty Men  left out of an Hundred and sixty and most of them wounded The Ship that gave us this seasonable Rescue was the  Guernsey  Frigate whose Station was  Barbadoes  We lay by for an Hour or two to repair our Rigging c and hail'd her desiring 'em to send a Boat on Board for our Captain because we were without one which accordingly they did Captain  Wase  and I went immediately on Board to pay our Respects to their Commander who receiv'd us with all imaginable Civility We had on Board our Ship seven Sailors and two Passengers killd the one  Joseph Ridge  of  Barbadoes  and the other  Daniel Thompson  of  Mevis  Merchant and four wounded The  Guernsey  had sixteen Men kill'd and three wounded among which was the Lieutenant who died the same Day of a Wound he received in his Thigh with a Musket Ball chew'd which made the Wound mortal The Captain invited us to dine with him which we did where we were treated with a new Dish at least to me a  Pollo  that is Fowls boil'd with Rice and salt Pork which was very palatable We took our Leaves of the Captain and went on Board of our own Vessel and at five a Clock in the Evening  July  the th after saluting the Town cast Anchor in  Carlisle  Bay  Barbadoes  for its bigness is the richest and best peopled Island in all  America  it is seated in thirteen Degrees twenty Minutes in length twenty four measur'd Miles and in the broadest Part about sixteen It resembles a Leg of Mutton with the Knuckle off The  North  and  East  Sides are fortify'd by Nature from any Harm from Ships of War by reason there is no Anchoring Place On the  SouthEast  and  Westerly  Part are four excellent commodious wellfortify'd Harbours The chief is that where we now ride which will contain a Thousand Sail of Ships free from the Danger of any Winds At the bottom of this Harbour stands the Capitol of the Island call'd St  Michael  's with a Fort at each End and a Platform in the middle which makes it of Strength sufficient to oppose▪a Royal Navy 'Tis a neat large Town with two Churches one with a handsome Organ For Largeness I think this Town may compare with our City of  Salisbury  but better inhabited As for the other three which are  Charles  Town St  James  's  Town    Little Bristol  in  Spright  's Bay I can give no manner of Account of But for my Reader's Satisfaction if he  will consult  Ligon  's History of  Barbadoes  he may come to the best Knowledge of the whole Island They are govern'd by the same Laws as we in  England  A Native of  Barbadoes  told me the whole Island contain'd at least Inhabitants Slaves included  July  the th after our Captain had left his Passengers and part of his Cargo we set sail for  Jamaica  Here you must note that from  Barbadoes  to  Jamaica  you always have the Wind in your Stern We pass'd  Martinico Dominica Guadalupe  and  Antegoa  and the first of  August  anchor'd at  Mevis  where we had immediately the Friends of Mr  Daniel Thompson  Merchant on Board us to unlade the Goods for they had heard of his Death by a Vessel from  Barbadoes  a Week before  Mevis  or  Nevis  lies in seven Degrees nineteen Minutes it is six Leagues in Circumference There is but one Harbour in the whole Island which some call  Mevis  Harbour or  Bath Bay  where lies the Town under the former Denomination It is pretty well secured with a Fort and Platform of Great Guns I was inform'd by one of the Inhabitants that there is a Mineral Water very good to bathe in which cures the same Distempers  with our  Bath  in  Somersetshire  The  English  settled here  Ann Dom  and have increas'd from One hundred and forty to Five thousand and upwards They send abroad as much Sugar Ginger Cotton and Tobacco as any Island of its Bigness in the  Caribbees  They are very regular in their Government here they neither allow of Drunkenness nor Whoring I mean in common as in  Barbadoes Jamaica  c Here I was first saluted with a little Fly call'd a  Musketo  and tho' it is small yet it has a devilish sharp Sting with it They get into our Stockings and are so very troublesome to new Comers that there's hardly any bearing of 'em If you scratch the Places stung by 'em till the Blood comes it may prove dangerous I my self kept a sore Leg three Months upon that account I was also inform'd there was a Flea they call  Chigos  which breed in Dust or Ashes and of all the Insects in the  Caribbees  this is the most dangerous They get into the Nails of the Toes imperceptibly and from thence run over all the Body tho' they chiefly fix themselves in the bottom of the Feet Which occasions an itching follow'd with Holes in the Skin They make Blisters as big as Peas in the Flesh where their young ones  breeding cause Ulcers and rotten Flesh which there is no Remedy for but to eat away the Parts affected with  Aquafortis  and BurntAlum While we lay here there was a Sword Fish ran himself ashore which was suppos'd to be done in eagerly chasing some other Fish It had no Scales but a dusky Skin and a white Belly rough like a Smith's File a flat Head two Fins on each side two on the Back and one instead of a Tail It is a Fish of prodigious Swiftness The Sword which is fix'd in the Head is six seven and sometimes eight Foot long Near his Eyes are two Nostrils out of which he throws the Water a great heighth into the Air This Fish often encounters with the Whale and proves too hard for him for with his Sword he rips up the Whale I bought one of these Swords of a poor Inhabitant for four Bottles of  English  Beer which is a great Rarity with them that he got in a Piece of a Wreck but thrust in so far that the End in getting out was broke three Inches  Next to  Mevis  lies St  Christophers  or as we generally call it St  Kit's  in seventeen Degrees and twenty five Minutes  Northward  of the Equinoctial It is twenty five Leagues in Circumference the Soil light and sandy and produces  Fruit common with us in  England  In the middle of this Island rises a high Mountain from which runs Streams of fresh Water that sometimes swell so high with sudden Rains that they drown all the Country near 'em This Island is inhabited by both  English  and  French  who even in the Time of War live very friendly together There was formerly discover'd a Silver Mine here which the  English  and  French  claim an equal Title to but neither make any Use of it by reason of the want of Miners The  English  Liberties are better peopled than the  French  but the  French  have more Conveniencies and better fortify'd Places than the  English  An  English  Fryar belonging to the  French  Jesuits who gave me this Description told me that the  French  had built a Town call'd  Basse Terre  in a Harbour of the same Name and chief in the Island full as big as  Gravesend  with very handsome Houses for the Merchants and Trades People which are many where there is also an Hospital to maintain their indigent sick together with a handsome Freeschool with large Endowments for the Children of the Island But what they mostly brag of is their Castle which is built about a Furlong from the Sea at the Foot of a high Mountain shadow'd  with great Trees In the Way thither stand the Houses of the Governour and other Officers for more Security seated in a Walk of Orange and Lemon Trees from the Brow of the Sea up to the Castle which is three Story high built with Freestone and Brick The Halls and Chambers are very lightsome and high and the Walls are adorn'd with Cedar On the Top is a flat Terrace which yields a delightful Prospect all over the Country The Winds which blow from the Hills so tempers the Heat that it makes it more pleasant than any other Island of the  Caribbees  As to the  English  Plantations they are not much inferior to the  French  they have six Churches and two Chapels for Divine Service This Island was planted jointly by  English  and  French  in Captain  Thomas Warner  for the  English  and one  Desnambuc  for the  French  The Natives made a vigorous Resistance but to little Purpose With this Success they return'd back to their several Countries and went again and settled there but the  English  having more Supplies from  London  daily encreas'd when on the contrary the Merchants at  Paris  grew weary seeing no Return for all the Charges they had been at But whilst this Business seem'd to go on with Success an  Accident happen'd which ruin'd all at once The King of  Spain  set out a Fleet the same Year of thirty one Galloons three Galleases and four Pinnaces with four thousand Men under the Command and Direction of  Frederick de Toledo  from  Cadiz Antonio Nunnez Barrico  and  Francisco de Almeida  Commanders of twenty Galleys from  Portugal  these joined with the abovementioned with a Resolution to drive the  English French  and  Dutch  entirely out of the  American  Islands Coming before  Mevis  they took nine  English  Vessels After that they sail'd to St  Christophers  where Captain  Desnambuc  altho' not prepar'd for Defence because their Fortifications were not finish'd drew all his Forces near the Shore to hinder their Landing But Captain  Rossey  who commanded another Port suffer'd 'em to land without the least Resistance Whereupon young  Desnambuc  Lieutenant of a Company under  Rossey  sally'd out and fell valiantly on the first Company of  Spaniards  killing many of 'em and put 'em to the Rout but the  Spaniards  being seconded by another Battalion he was slain after having made a stout Resistance and forsaken by all his Men  Rossey  upon this abandons his Intrenchments and flies to the Hills and high  Grounds Whereupon the  Spaniards  became Masters of the Forts but durst not follow  Rossey  for fear of an Ambuscade which Fear prov'd true For  Desnambuc  undermining the Fort retir'd on Board some Vessel prepar'd for that Purpose and made off In the mean time the Powder taking Fire blew up the Fort and six hundred  Spaniards  into the Air The  English  relying upon the League between  Spain  and  England  made no Resistance but sent Agents to  Toledo  c to put him in mind of the League between their Masters To which he reply'd That St  Christophers  being part of the  Western  World was given by the Pope to his Master  Philip  Nevertheless he gave 'em six of the nine Vessels they took at  Mevis  to imbark themselves on Condition they wou'd sail immediately for  England  which they agreed to But the six Vessels not holding all the rest were left on the Island for another Opportunity No sooner was  Toledo  out of sight but the remaining part of the  English  Inhabitants took fresh Courage and rebuilt several Forts and made every thing ready for Defence if Occasion shou'd be In the mean Time  Desnambuc  suffer'd a great deal of Hardship thro' ill Weather and want of Provision having been at several Islands intending to  settle with his little Company but not liking any of 'em and hearing that the Enemy were gone to the  Havana  and the  English  were busy tilling their Grounds he return'd to his former Station where they suffer'd many Hardships till some Vessels from the  Netherlands  arriv'd and furnish'd 'em with Provisions Ammunition and Cloaths upon Credit But in a few Years they paid all and grew rich from their plentiful Stock of Tobacco Sugars Ginger and Indigo till they brought it to the rich and flourishing State it now remains in  Having ended our Affairs we set Sail for  Jamaica  the st of  August  and on the th of  September  anchor'd safe in  Port Royal  Harbour in the great and flourishing Island of  Jamaica  without any Accident This was our last Station Here we were to unlade the remaining part of our Goods and take in its Return Rum Sugar and Spice  This Island of  Jamaica  is the only Mart of all  America  for the  English  which drive a large Trade here but Wickedness is in its full Perfection I remember Captain  Wase  ask'd one of our Men that had spent some Money ashore what was his Opinion of the Honesty of the Women of  Port Royal  Why truly says  Tarr  very bluntly if there's one honest Woman shou'd happen to tumble down I believe there's never another to take her up Provision is prodigious dear here two or three of us went on shore to Dinner one Day at  Port Royal  where we had only a roasted Turkey wretchedly lean and nothing nigh so well tasted as our  English  Turkeys and our Eating came to Thirty Shillings but then to make amends Money is plenty enough We had a Sailor on Board that had been a Taylor by Trade this Fellow got Leave of the Captain to go on shore for a Month where he clear'd by working JourneyWork twelve Pound for that Month But then he had the Ship's Provision carry'd on shore to him two or three times a Week had he been to have paid for his Diet he had sav'd but a small Matter I was mightily surpriz'd to see a Market for Turtle in the same Manner as our Butchers This is a Meat or rather Fish of an odd Nature but of an excellent Taste the Lean looks like the Flesh of Pork but something of a deeper red the Fat is a sort of a light green but very luscious this is the common Diet of the Slaves or meaner sort of People but if Strangers eat too much of it it's apt to give 'em the BloodyFlux This is a very reigning Distemper here  and carries off abundance of new Comers The Island of  Jamaica  liesLeagues  North  from the  Southern  Continent of  America  in the Sea call'd  Mare del Nor  and  South  from the Isle of  Cuba  about twelve Leagues and twenty  West  from  Hispaniola  in eighteen Degrees  Northern  Latitude and beareth from  Rio de Hach NorthWest  a hundred and fifty Leagues from  Santa Martha N N W  a hundred and thirtyfive from  Carthagena N  a hundred and fourteen from  Portobello N E  and by  N  a hundred and ninety from the  Isthmus  of  Darien N  and by  E  a hundred and seventy and from the Bay of  Mexico  a hundred and fifty Its Form is almost oval being in Length from  East  to  West  about fifty four Leagues from  North  to  South  in the broadest part twenty three Leagues going narrower toward each End like a RowlingPin a good Comparison In Circumference one hundred and fifty Leagues The Air of this Island is more temperate and the Heat more tolerable than any of the other Islands by reason of the cool Breezes which constantly blow from the  East  with frequent Showers of Rain and Dews that fall in the Night These Dews are very pernicious to careless drunken People that lie expos'd all Night to 'em This  is also the only Isle of the  Barloventi  which is not subject to violent Storms and Hurricanes as the other Islands are And the Diseases that are predominant here are only bred by Intemperance as Surfeits Bloodyflux Fevers and Agues or occasion'd by ill Diet or Slothfulness This Island is well water'd with Springs and Rivulets of fresh Water with many handsome Rivers stor'd with several sorts of Fish and is all over especially in the  Western  Parts full of high Mountains and Hills It is also well wooded for the  North  and  South  Parts chiefly abound with large and tall Woods Neither is there wanting Savanna's or Plains The Commodities of this Island are very many and first for Vegetables the Sugars are so good that they now out sell those of  Barbadoes    s per Cent  Tobacco is so excellent that it is bought up faster than the Planters can cure it The Indigo is also here very good The Cotton is much the best of all the neighbouring Islands Tortoiseshell is very plenty here Here are also great Variety of Dyewood as  Fustwick Redwood  a kind of  Logwood Cedar Mohogeny Lignumvitae Ebony Granadille  and many others Nay there's many Mines both of Silver Copper and Gold but that the Inhabitants think it  wou'd be dangerous to break 'em up for fear of drawing the  Spanish  and  French  Buccaniers upon 'em There are several Fishermen who have found pieces of Ambergrease upon the Surface of the Water near the Shore Ginger grows better here than in any other Part of  America  and CodPepper very plentifully And also a certain Kind of Spice call'd  Piemete  in Form of  EastIndia  Pepper of a very aromatical and curious Taste partaking as it were of several Species together It grows wild among the Mountains and is highly valu'd among the Inhabitants Of Medicinal Plants I have seen several as  Guaiacum Chinaroot Cassia Fistula Veuillard Achiotes Tamarines Contrayerva Ciperas Adiantumnigrum Aloes Cucumis Agristis Sumach Acacia Misselto  with many other Drugs and Balsams The ingenious Sir  Hans Sloan  has wrote an elaborate Book of the Plants of this Island  Cochineal  is produc'd by a Plant that grows in this Country but not brought to Perfection without much Care and Industry This Island is also very well stock'd with Cattle as Horses Cows and Asses there have been many Mules but the Inhabitants made so little Use of 'em that now there are but few Sheep are large and tall and their Meat indifferently good but their  Fleece worth nothing  Goats  or  Cabirates  are without Number being a Beast peculiar to the Country Hogs both wild and tame in abundance I have been hunting the wild Hog in  Porta Morant  Bay and it gives good Diversion though sometimes dangerous You go with some Ten or a Dozen in Company arm'd with a Musket and a Cutlash as soon as ever with your Dogs you have found 'em out you all take Aim and fire as quick as you can but if you don't kill 'em immediately with your Shot they set upon you openmouth'd so that you must either hew 'em down with your Cutlashes or club your Muskets Generally as soon as you have 'em you flay 'em as you do Mutton and  barbicue  'em even in the very Place where you kill 'em that is you dig a square Hole in the Earth then clap four Stakes at each Corner and on 'em put your Meat so make a Fire under it and when one side is done enough you turn the other For tame Fowls they have of all the Kinds that we have in  England  besides  Guinea  Hens  Parrots Parachites Machaws  and  Boobies  which are  Boobies  indeed for they will sit upon a Tree or Post till you come and take 'em They have three Crops a Year in this Island and the Trees are always green They  have three sorts of Bread one of  English  Corn another of  Guinea  Wheat and the third of a Root they call Casavi which is rank Poison till press'd and bak'd in an Oven 'tis very white but tasteless and the Bread made of it the Size of our thin OatCakes But of all the Fruit this Island produces the PineApple is the best which grows very low with Leaves something like the  Indicus Ficus  that I have seen in Gardens here in  England  the Taste is so excellent that I know not what to compare it to it having the Relish of all fineflavour'd Fruits There's a Fruit that grows upon a low Bush call'd the PricklePear the inside of which is red and on the top is a little thorny Thing like a Star which if you do not take away before you eat it may prove pernicious If you eat but two of this Fruit it will make your Urine as red as Blood  Plantins  are a very good Fruit which is when bak'd in the Ashes us'd by the Slaves instead of Bread 'Tis a Fruit with a Skin on it like our Beans which is taken off and then the Fruit appears about the size of a  Bolognia  Sausage  Bannanas  is another Fruit something of the same Kind but shorter and more luscious Both these Fruits are ripe all the Year for when some are fit to gather others are green and some in Bud The Oranges  and Lemons are neither of 'em good in my Opinion but their Limes are wonderful they grow upon a Tree full of Thorns where you must be sure to prick your Fingers if you'll gather 'em These with SpringWater and Sugar was the chief of my Liquor while we staid there The Potatoes are very fine here exceeding in my Opinion even those of  Ireland  Then there's another Root call'd Jams something like a  Jerusalem  Artichoak but larger and stringy The Onions of  Jamaica  are much milder and better tasted than our  English  Onions and very wholsome They us'd to make a great Addition to our Crogick Brewis that is Bisket soak'd in fair Water for some Time then the Water thrown away and the Bisket strew'd over with Salt Oil and LimeJuice together with Onions and so eaten as a dainty Dish There is a sensitive Plant in this Island the Stalk surrounded with Leaves full of dark red Spots bears a sweetsmelling violetcolour'd Flower the Leaves as soon as touch'd close up together and die and accordingly as they are held in the Hand a shorter or a longer Time this Alteration continues Ginger grows plentiful here the Male Plant for there's Sexes hath generally bigger Leaves than the Female The Stalks which are  without Knots have more Leaves upwards than downwards and spreads along the Earth still taking Root anew When the Leaves wither then the Ginger is commonly ripe but it has not that Poinancy whilst green as when dry'd The Cotton of this Place of which the Cloaths and Hammocks are made are vended in most Parts of the  Westeru  World grows on a Tree about the Heighth of a PeachTree with a strait Stem or Body out of which shoot Boughs of an equal Length and at equal Distance Between the Leaves which are narrow and long grow red Flowers and from 'em oval Cods which when ripe inclose the Cotton and a Seed like Pepper Of hurtful Creatures there is the Crocodile or  Alligator  which infest many Rivers and Ponds this is a Creature of a monstrous Size I have seen one twenty six Foot long it moves swiftly and strongly forward but turns slow they are impenetrable every where but in the Eye or Belly they have four Feet or Fins with which they go or swim their usual Course of getting their Food is to lie on their Backs as dead then with a sudden Onset they spring upon their Prey whether Man or Beast But 'tis easily avoided by a Man by reason of an Aromatick Smell that comes from the Body which may be smelt  five Hundred Yards but if a Man has got a Cold and can't smell if he has Eyes they are easily avoided for if they run right forward it is but slipping on one side for they are as long in turning as a Coach The Oil that's made from these Creatures is good for several Distempers They lay their Eggs about the size of a Turkey's and cover 'em with Sand which heated by the Beams of the Sun hatches the young ones who naturally creep into the Water One of these Creatures swam after us fifty Yards in  Porto Morant  Bay and rais'd his Head upon the Edge of our LongBoat which was deeply laden with Casks of Water our Carpenter who had been felling of Timber to Wood the Ship struck him a very great Blow on the Nose with his Hatchet that I am sure hurt him for he gave a sort of Shriek which no Body ever heard before and swam to shore where I observ'd him to run his Head into the Mud as if it pain'd him which makes me think that their Heads are not invulnerable as is reported The  Guana  is another Creature amphibious as the  Alligator  but nothing nigh so large There's an Island near  Jamaica  call'd  Guana  Island inhabited by nothing else our Seamen eat of these latter but much Good may it do 'em for the Flesh looks like a piece of a  Blackamore  's Arm but how it tastes I can't tell neither do I ever design to try The  Cocoa  Nut is a Fruit that is both Meat Drink and Cloathing to the Natives I mean the Blacks the Rind serves for weaving of Cloaths nay and rigging their Canoes before they knew the  Europeans  and when you have taken off the Bark you must be beholding to a Saw to cut off the Monkey's Face which is the top with three Marks that makes it something resemble that Animal then the Inside contains first a liquid Substance like Whey but very sweet after you have taken out this Liquor round the Nut is a Substance a quarter of an Inch thick which you cut out and that's the Meat which is very delicious and grateful to the Taste but not wholsome if eat of too much There's another Thing that's very remarkable and that is the  PhisickNut  much of the Taste of our Pignuts but one or two of 'em will do your Business upwards or downwards as well as Dr  AnnodyneNecklace  's SugarPlumbs As I was going one Day to dine with Captain  Kendal  a Gentleman Inhabitant within a Mile of the Bay in  Porto Morant  attended by a Black a Servant of his I saw in the Hedge a fair Apple growing on a Bush which I readily gather'd and was conveying to my  Mouth but prevented by the Black's giving me a Blow on the Hand which struck it from me I immediately with my Sword in the Scabbard fell to belabour the poor Fellow for his Insolence for I having been familiar with him and talk'd to him along the Road thought he made our old  English  Proverb true  If you give an Inch they'll take an Ell  but it seems the Fellow sav'd my Life by it for this Fruit which was call'd a  Mangineel Apple  was rank Poyson but what I had never seen or heard of before I was so concern'd for the Blows I had given the poor Fellow that I gave him a Dollar to make him amends I remember I was afterwards washing my self at a River in the same Bay and it raining very hard I went under a Tree to save my Cloaths from being wet and in placing them together in a Cavity of the Shore the Drops of Rain fell on a  Mangineel  Tree and so on my Back but in less than half an Hour my Flesh burn'd very hot and white Blisters appear'd upon my Skin insomuch that I was in a high Fever but a Native of the Place being with me ran for salt Water and wash'd me all over and afterwards got some Oil and dip'd my Shirt in it and put it on my Back which gave me Ease immediately but the Spots remain'd upon my Skin several Years afterwards  I don't doubt but my Readers will laugh at me for thus running from one Thing to another but I relate 'em just as my Memory prompts me This Island was first discover'd by  Columbus Anno Dom  After he had conquer'd the Natives and built a City call'd  Sevilla  afterwards  St Jago de la Vega  consisting of about seventeen Hundred Houses two Churches two Chapels and an Abbey he made his Son  Diego Columbus  Governor of the whole Island for his Master  Ferdinand  King of  Spain  The first Attempt made upon this Island by the  English  was  A D  under the Command of Mr  Antony Shirley  but after vanquishing the  Spaniards  they deserted it as not thinking it worth their keeping and return'd home The  Spaniards  again possessing it remain'd unmolested till  Anno Dom  when  Oliver Cromwel  then Lord Protector rigg'd out a Fleet of Ships to make a Descent on  Hispaniola  under the Command of Colonel  Venables  but being disappointed of their Hopes and meeting with ill Success steer'd away for  Jamaica  and on the th of  May  after a stout Resistance made themselves Masters of it The Island is suppos'd to contain two hundred and fifty thousand Inhabitants Slaves included The chief Towns are st  St Jago  about  six Miles up the Country  dly PassageTown  six Miles from that  dly  And indeed the largest before the Earthquake destroy'd it  Port Royal  it contained a thousand Houses many of them eminent Buildings but as it is now built on a small Neck of Land which forms the Harbour I take it to be about the bigness of  Deptford  At both Ends of the Town is a large Fort known by the Name of the square and round Fort the square Fort or Castle contains a hundred Pieces of Ordnance and the other about thirty besides several Canon on the Platform which reaches from one Fort to the other so that without Treachery they need not fear an Attack either by Land or Sea About a Mile farther is another small Fort call'd  Landward  Fort which secures the Town from any Attempt by Land Off the Mouth of the Harbour towards the Sea lie several small Islands upon the most  Western  of which lying within half a League of the Town and by which all the Vessels must pass they have erected a Fort which contains eight Guns The chief Harbour after  Port Royal  is  Port St Antony  on the  North  a very safe commodious landlock'd Harbour only the coming in is something difficult the Channel being narrow'd by a little Island that lies off the Mouth of  the Port  d Portomorant  a very capacious Harbour where Ships do conveniently Wood and Water and ride safe from all Winds  d  On the  South  is  Port Gagway  which is much the largest of all that has been mention'd it being five Leagues over in some Places it is landlock'd by a Point of Land that runs  S W  from the main of the Island The Road is so deep that a Ship of a thousand Tun may lay her Side to the Shore of the Point and lade or unlade at Pleasure with Planks afloat  Now finding our Affairs wou'd detain us half a Year longer I got Leave of the Captain to go in a Sloop with some of my Acquaintance to get Logwood and on  September  the th we set sail for the Bay of  Campeche  with a fair Wind The old Manner of getting this Wood is as follows a Company of desperate Fellows get together in a Sloop well arm'd and Land by stealth but in Case of any Resistance the whole Crew attends on the Cutters ready arm'd to defend 'em indeed there's a Colony of  English  that sells this Logwood but many chuse the other Way all this was strange to me for I knew nothing of the matter till we were out to Sea There was one Fellow there that told me that about ten Years before he went with a  Vessel and they took the same Method as usual in getting it and landed all their Men but six that they left on Board to look after the Vessel in the mean time the  Spaniards  having Intelligence of their Descent sent a hundred Men in several Canoes to seize their Vessel which accordingly they did without any Resistance from the six Men on Board After they had clap'd these Men under Hatches they search'd and ransack'd the Vessel sending every thing on shore that was of any Value then they prepar'd to trepan the Crew as they came on board which happen'd the very next Night when some of the Men coming on board with a Load of Logwood the  Spaniards  caus'd the six Men to stand upon Deck and on Pain of Death not to discover the Truth of the Matter which happen'd as they desir'd for the Men coming on Board carelesly without their Arms were all seiz'd immediately and clapp'd in Irons The rest that were on shore wondering at the stay of the Boat sent a Canoe with six Men to know the Reason of their Delay which were likewise taken in the same Trap with the former The Man that told me this Story was one of these last six who found means secretly in the middle of the Night to slip into the Water and swam ashore tho' a  League off where he happily inform'd the rest of the Crew which were forty three of the Misfortune that had happen'd to their Companions Whereupon they consulted what they had best do where it was unanimously agreed to seize upon three large Canoes that lay at the bottom of the Bay that belong'd to some  French  Hunters that were on shore which was done accordingly On Board they immediately got well arm'd and steer'd away for their Sloop But as they design'd to trick them the same way as the others had done their Companions they consulted what to do if they should be discover'd before they could get on Board which was probable enough At length it was agreed to carry on the Plot in order to deceive them and as soon as ever they could get over the Ship's side to assault the Enemy with all the Vigour imaginable appointing two or three to release their Companions and put Arms into their Hands to be assistant in recovering their Liberties Every thing happen'd as was suggested for when they came within half a Furlong of the Vessel they were hail'd by some of their own Men as it is usual in such Cases which was answer'd by them in the Canoes with swearing and cursing at 'em for not coming ashore with their Longboat  as order'd but to force 'em to bring their Wood aboard in Canoes They ask'd from on Board how many were come with 'em All answer'd they in the Boat but three that we left ashore to look after our Arms and a small Remainder of Logwood which you must go and fetch immediately with the Longboat which they pretended cou'd not go to 'em before by reason she had a Hole broke in her Bow against a piece of Rock that gave 'em a great deal of Trouble in getting her to the Vessel Our People smil'd to themselves to hear they had got their Lesson so ready In asking and answering these Questions they had reach'd the Vessel and getting nimbly up the Side they drew from under their WatchCoats their Pistols and Cutlashes and first fir'd upon the  Spaniards  who were running to seize 'em half unarm'd as not suspecting any Resistance Those whose Office it was to release the Prisoners under Hatches did it immediately by killing the two Centuries that watch'd over 'em and then coming up with this fresh Recruit soon overcame the  Spaniards  and made 'em call for Quarter Which was not granted till they had thrown down their Arms When they had surrender'd they chain'd 'em all under Hatches and so the Conquerors became Prisoners and the  Prisoners Conquerors After the Action was over they look'd after the Dead which was found to be nine  Spaniards  and one  Englishman  who was suppos'd to be kill'd by our own Men in the first Fire  Upon this good Success they having notice that there lay a rich Ship in the Harbour before the Town of  Campeche  they resolv'd to try their good Fortune farther which they contriv'd as follows they hoisted  Spanish  Colours and sail'd away immediately for the Port of  Campeche  where they arriv'd by next Morning saluted the Castle and Town with seven Guns as Friends and were paid back the Complement The Shore was fill'd with Numbers of People to see the  Englishmen  brought ashore Prisoners but they were mistaken The Ship which they had a Design upon lay about a League from the Town as having arriv'd but two Days before but was to put farther in that very Evening before the Sea Breeze fail'd our Men boarded her on the Starboardside which lay from the Town and took her without firing a Gun cut her Cables and made out to Sea before the Town knew what was the matter But as soon as ever they smelt the Trick a  Spanish  Man of War of thirty Guns being all that was in the Harbour slip'd her Cables and crouded all the Sail  she cou'd to come up with us we finding she gain'd upon us call'd a Council and at last resolv'd to bring up most of our  Spanish  Prisoners bound and expose 'em to the whole Fire of the Enemy Which succeeded accordingly for the Ship coming close up to us without any firing on either side commanded us to strike Upon that we order'd the  Spanish  Captain to lay before 'em their Condition which profited little at first but after many Intreaties from them and Threatnings from us the others were prevail'd upon to sheer off and make towards the Town while we made the best of our Way But the  Spaniard  making up to the Town again was met by several armed Boats with the Governor himself in one of them who gave a strict Command not to regard any Thing but use all possible Means to retake the Ship and the Pyrates as they term'd us When we perceiv'd the Boats making up to the Ship and observ'd her tack about to give us Chase we guess'd at the Matter and finding she gain'd upon us we put our selves into a Posture of Defence and propos'd to engage her in the Prize we took last which carry'd twenty Guns We muster'd our Men and found we had seventy one but then we had two hundred  Spanish  Prisoners who we  fear'd if by any Accident they shou'd get loose might prove our Ruin whereupon a Consult was immediately held to put most of them to Death Upon which the Captain of the first Prize stood up and said in pretty good  English  Gentlemen you have taken us fairly and done no more than we our selves did to you now seeing that Ship which pursues us and gains upon us every Moment is coming in order to fight you we shall run a more certain Danger by it by being your Prisoners if you expose us to the Fire of their Canon as you did before and if they do really fire I may as well take them for an Enemy as you since we are sure to receive the most Damage But to make the Matter short being the Time is so I propose to you that if the Vessel fires at you we may reasonably conclude they have no manner of Regard for us so we shall not have any for them and if you'll give us that Liberty we will freely fight under your Command and endeavour as far as in us lies to defend your Vessel as much as if it was our own This Speech of the Captain's was approv'd of by the rest of the Prisoners so that at last we agreed to set sixty of them at Liberty and the rest fast bound under Hatches where we put two Centuries with two Patareroes  fix'd charg'd with small Shot with Orders that if there seem'd to be any thing like Disturbance to fire in upon 'em The sixty we chose out to be assistant to us were order'd to the Great Guns so that we still had the Command over 'em because they had no Arms After we had settled every thing we lay by seeing it impossible to escape without fighting in order for their coming up to us which they did in a short time and coming within Hail they order'd us to strike immediately and make no Resistance or else they wou'd have no Regard to their Friends on Board us but sink or take us and put every Man of us to Death Upon which the  Spanish  Captain that was our Prisoner made Answer That if they offer'd to fire a Gun every  Spaniard  on Board us resolv'd to fight against 'em as Enemies Which was answer'd They must obey the Governor's Orders who had just left 'em and was return'd on shore Upon this they fir'd a Broadside upon us but we return'd it immediately with our small Arms and great Guns which were well ply'd by our  Spanish  Prisoners The Fight continu'd half an Hour with all the Fierceness imaginable at last the  Spaniard  prepar'd to board us with his Boats at the same Time but were receiv'd so briskly and so damag'd  by our HandGranado's that they were oblig'd to make to the Ship with great Loss The HandGranado's stood us in great stead for we dispatch'd three or four of our Men into the MainTop who from thence discharg'd several Granado's that by their own Report kill'd and wounded above thirty Men They attempted to board us once again and came on briskly with firing and loud Shouts to terrify us but we return'd 'em their Shouts and firing with Interest for with a lucky Shot we drove away their MainMast which put 'em into strange Confusion This Accident if we would have laid hold on't might have given us an Opportunity of outsailing 'em but that was not once thought of for Desire of Revenge made us fight like Furies The next Broadside we gave 'em struck away their Rudder which render'd 'em incapable of steering their Vessel or tacking about Upon which we perceiving what had happen'd tack'd about and with a Broadside that rack'd her fore and aft kill'd 'em by their own Confession sixteen Men for it split two of their Guns whose Splinters did most of the Execution Now what we call to  rake fore and aft  is to lay the Side of our Ship against the Enemy's Head or Stern and fire into 'em so that every Shot goes from one End of  the Ship to the other instead of going across so that of Consequence one Shot that way will do more Damage than ten directly side to side The Heat of the  Spaniard  now began to abate but yet he hector'd as much as ever at last a lucky Shot enter'd her PowderRoom and blew up her main Deck with several  Spaniards  into the Air upon which was heard such Groans and Yelling from wounded and dying Men that were enough to frighten Men less inur'd to such Encounters With this Success we prepar'd in the Confusion to board them in our turn but was prevented by seeing their Vessel sinking whereupon they struck down their Colours and ask'd for Quarter and Help which we immediately gave 'em by putting out our Boats which together with their own sav'd all the Men they had left which were ninety five out of four hundred and odd  This Success flush'd us mightily with Hopes of succeeding in any Enterprize We lost out of our  Spaniards  twenty six and of  English  nine kill'd and two wounded who dy'd the next Day The  Spaniards  were of signal Service to us and fought bravely even to Desparation well knowing if they shou'd be taken after fighting  on our side they must all inevitably suffer Death Which prov'd happy for us for it had been impossible for us to have escap'd 'em even if all the  Spaniards  on Board us had stood neuter  After we had clear'd our Vessel of the Blood and dead Men and refresh'd our selves we call'd up our  Spanish  Prisoners that they might refresh themselves likewise and return'd the others who had fought so bravely in our Defence our hearty Thanks and the  Spanish  Captain express'd himself so handsomly that our Master freely offer'd him our Sloop victual'd and ready fitted up to do what he thought fit with Upon this kind Offer the Captain smil'd and told him he would not take it without buying And as for Money I have none pursued he but if you'll listen to a Stratagem of mine I'll engage to furnish you with Money for your Vessel and something over and above With that he propos'd to take six of the  Spaniards  that had fought for us and in our LongBoat to go on shore to the Governor and demand a Ransom for the Prisoners we had taken which was agreed to accordingly they went ashore and told the Governor if he did not immediately send fifty Dollars a Man for two hundred and twenty they wou'd be every  Soul ty'd Back to Back and thrown into the Sea Upon which there was a Gathering made through the Town and the Money rais'd immediately and in twelve Hours the Captain return'd with Dollars gave our Captain distributed among the Sailors and kept the rest for himself The next Day we set the  Spaniards  that were sav'd from the Man of War on shore and as many more that were willing out of the other Ship and of our own Sloop so that Captain  Fernando  our friendly  Spaniard  took his leave of us with eighty of his Countrymen with Intention for the  South  Sea and we steer'd our Course in our rich Prize for  Jamaica  where we shar'd it Every common Sailor had to his Share  l  Moreover the Captain order'd me in particular  l  more for the Service I did in swimming ashore unperceiv'd to give 'em Notice  After ending his Story I ask'd him how he had improv'd his Money from that Time Psha says he that and five times as much is gone since then And this is no wonder for Sailors are such Fools that what they get with the utmost Danger they spend as the meanest Trifles We sail'd before the Wind six Days together towards the Bay but on the seventh the Clouds  darken'd and the Welkin seem'd all on fire by Times with Lightning and the Thunder roar'd louder than ever I heard it in my Life in short a dreadful Hurricane approach'd which was suspected by a deceitful Calm and Showers of Rain Which the inimitable  Shakespear  very justly describes  We often see against some Storm  A Silence in the Heav'ns the Rack stand still  The bold Winds speechless and the Orb below  As hush as Death  The Sailors had furl'd their Sails and lowr'd their Topmasts waiting for it under a double riv'd Foresail Which at last came with most extreme Violence  Either Tropick now  Gan Thunder at both Ends of Heav'n the Clouds  From many a horrid Rift abortive pour'd  Fierce Rain with Lightning mix'd Water with Fire  In Ruin reconcil'd Dreadful was the Rack  As Earth and Sky wou'd mingle  Milton  In vain the Master issues out Commands  In vain the trembling Sailors ply their Hands  The giddy Ship between the Winds and Tides  Forc'd back and forwards in a Circle rides  Stun'd with the different Blows then shoots amain  Till counterbuff'd she stops and sleeps again  The Face of Things a frightful Image bears  And present Death in various forms appears  Dryden  The Storm lasted with all its Violence three Hours and at last insensibly abated till it was stark calm and not one Breath of Wind was stirring nor any sign of one but a little Froth on the Surface  The Tempest is o'erblown the Skies are clear  And the Sea charm'd into a Calm so still  That not a Wrinkle ruffles her smooth Face  Dryden  After the Storm was over we loos'd our Sails in Expectation of the Wind which in half an Hour stole out again as frighten'd at the violent Storm or if you'll grant me to make a Simile like a poor Debtor  that steals out of his lurkingplace when the blustering Bailiffs are gone out of sight About six in the Evening we saw a WaterSpout This is an Aerial Engine or Limbeck that draws up the salt Water of the Sea and distils it into fresh Showers of Rain This Cloud comes down in Form of a Pipe of Lead of a vast Thickness and by the Force of the Sun sucks up a great Quantity of Water I stood an Hour to observe it after it had continu'd about half an Hour in the Water it drew up insensibly by Degrees till it was lost in the Clouds but in the closing of the same it shut out some of the Water which fell into the Sea again with a Noise like that of Thunder and occasion'd a Smoke in the Water that lasted for a considerable Time The Sailors told me that these WaterSpouts sometimes did great Damage to Ships that by Calms were too near 'em when they fell One Fellow told me that he saw a Bark of sixty Tun suck'd out of the Water by one of 'em which caus'd the breaking of the Spout and sunk the Vessel with the Fall of the Waters In the  Streights  when Ships approach these airy Engines they fire off a Gun and that breaks 'em before they come too near The Person told me that at the Fall of Water the Sea was curl'd as  much as if you had thrown a large Stone into a standing Pond of Water We have sometimes at a Distance seen fourteen or fifteen at a Time at Work but I never saw one so large as this  In the Evening we caught a small Shark with two sucking Fishes that stuck close to her till laid on the Deck and then drop'd down of their own Accord This is allow'd the  Remora  of the Ancients It is about the Bigness of a Mackrel with a flat Head and is of a gristly Substance These stick to the sides of Vessels very frequently and sometimes swim upon the Surface of the Water and are even caught with a naked Hook I have sometimes seen these Fishes sticking to a Log of Wood in the Water When we hog'd our Ship a Hog is an Instrument of six Foot square something like a Harrow and Stumps of old Brooms fix'd close in the middle part this is put to the bottom of the Ship with a Rope before and another aft fix'd to the Capstorn which cleans the Vessel from all sorts of Filth I have seen many of 'em in the Hog together with Barnicles and Oysters and several other Shellfish  October  the th we anchor'd at  Trist Island  in the Bay of  Campeachy  and sent  our Men ashore at  Logwood Creek  to seek for the LogwoodCutters who immediately came on Board The Bargain was soon struck and in Exchange for our Rum and Sugar and a little Money we got in our Lading in eight Days and set sail for  Jamaica  the th Day of  October  Now in getting up to  Jamaica  again generally takes us up two Months because we are oblig'd to ply it all the way to Windward One Day it being stark calm I went into the Water to wash my self though I was dissuaded by all the Sailors by reason of that Coast being infested with Sharks which sometimes meet with People and bite off a Limb But being there had not been any seen that Day I wou'd venture but ty'd a Rope about me for fear of any Accident that might happen or the Wind striking up of a sudden But I had not been long in the Water before they cry'd from the Gunnel A Shark a Shark but I thinking they had only banter'd as sometimes they do when any one is in the Water did not mind 'em till at last they pull'd me by main Force up the side of the Ship when looking into the Water I saw a swinging large Shark with his white Belly turn'd up in order to bite at me Upon which I thank'd God and  good Friends that had prevented him by swiftly pulling me up though the Rope had rubb'd off the Skin and some part of my Flesh with the Force Now a Shark cannot get his Prey without first turning himself upon his Back because their upper Jaw is much larger than their under Which often prevents Accidents  I one Day went down into the Hold to bottle off a small Parcel of Wine that I had there for fear 'twou'd sowre which made me in a filthy Pickle Coming upon Deck again I wanted to clean my self but did not care to go into the Water as before so went into the Boat astern that we hoisted overboard in the Morning to look after a Wreck that we discover'd upon the Water Being in the Boat I began to wash my self and when I had dress'd my self again I pull'd a Book out of my Pocket and sate reading in the Boat when before I was aware a Storm began to rise so that I cou'd not get up the Shipside as usual but call'd for the Ladder of Ropes that hangs over the Ship's Quarter in order to get up that way but whether it was not fasten'd above or whether it broke through Rottenness as being seldom us'd I can't tell but down I fell into the Sea and though the Ship as they told me afterwards  tack'd about to take me up if it was possible yet I lost sight of 'em thro' the Duskiness of the Evening and the Storm together Now I had the most dismal Fears that cou'd ever possess any one in my Condition I was forc'd to drive with the Wind which sate by good Fortune with the Current and having kept my self above Water as near as I could guess in this Fright four Hours I felt my Feet every now and then touch Ground and at last by a great Wave▪ was thrown and left upon the Sand yet it being dark I knew not what to do but I got up and walk'd as well as my tir'd Limbs wou'd let me and every now and then was overtaken by the Waves but not high enough to wash me away  When I had got far enough as I thought to be out of Danger I cou'd not discover any thing of Land and I immediately conjectur'd that it was but some Bank of Sand that the Sea wou'd overflow at high Tide Whereupon I sate down to rest my weary Limbs and fit my self for Death for that was all I cou'd expect in my own Opinion Then all my Sins came flying in my Face which I repented of with all the Sincerity imaginable I offer'd up my fervent Prayers to our Almighty Creator not for my Safety  because I did not expect any such Thing but for all my past Offences and I may really say I expected my Dissolution with a Calmness that made me think I had made my Peace with Heaven At last I fell asleep tho' I try'd all I could against it by rising up and walking till I was oblig'd to lie down again In the Morning when I awak'd I was amaz'd to find my self among four or five very low sandy Islands but all separated half a Mile or more as I guess'd by the Sea With that I began to be a little chearful and walk'd about to see if I could find any thing that was eatable but to my great Grief I found nothing but a few Eggs that I was oblig'd to eat raw this laid my Condition before my Eyes in a most horrid Manner and the Fear of starving seem'd to me to be worse than that of drowning and oft did I wish that the Sea had swallow'd me rather than thrown me on this desolate Island for I cou'd perceive by the Evenness of 'em that they were not inhabited either by Man or Beast or any Thing else but Rats and several sorts of Fowl  Upon this Island there was some few Bushes of a Wood they call'd  Burton  Wood which us'd to be my Shelter at Night but to compleat my Misery there was not to be  found one drop of fresh Water on the Island so that I was forc'd to drink my own Urine for two or three Days together which made my Skin come off like the Peal of a boil'd Codlin At last my Misery so encreas'd that I was often in the Mind to put an end to my wretched Life but desisted on the Opinion that I had of some Alligator or other voracious Creature coming to do it for me Strange Circumstances indeed to wish to be devour'd alive as a Mitigation of my Misfortunes  I had liv'd a Week here upon Eggs only when by good Fortune upon a Bush I discover'd a Booby sitting I ran immediately as fast as I cou'd and with a Stick knock'd him down I never consider'd whether it was proper to eat or no but I suck'd the Blood and eat the Flesh with such a Pleasure as none can express but them that have felt the Pain of Hunger to the same Degree as my self After I had devour'd this Banquet I walk'd about and discover'd many more of these Birds which I slew  Now my Stomach being pretty well appeas'd I began to consider whether I could not with two Sticks make a Fire as I had seen Blacks in  Jamaica  I try'd with all the Wood I could get and at last happily did it This done I gather'd some  Sticks and made a Fire pick'd several of my Boobies and broil'd 'em as well as I cou'd and now I resolv'd to come to an Allowance This Bird is a Water Fowl about the bigness of a large Crow of grey Colour it has a long strong Bill and Feet like a Duck and its Flesh seem'd to me to taste something like a Duck's but stronger and a little Fishy And it is such a Booby that it will not get out of your Way without beating  At Night I and the rest of my FellowInhabitants had a great Storm of Rain and Thunder with the redest Lightning I had ever seen which well wash'd us all I believe as for my self my Cloaths which were only a pair of thin Shoes and Thread Stockings and a Cotton Wastcoat and Breeches were soundly wet but I had this Happiness to find in the Morning several Cavities of RainWater which put in my Head a Thought of making a deep Well or hollow Place that I might have Water continually by me which I brought to Perfection in this Manner I took a Piece of Wood I found on the Island and pitch'd upon a Place under a BurtonTree where with my Hands and the Stick together I dug a Hole or Well big enough to contain a Hogshead of Water then put in  Stones and pa v'd it and got in and stamp'd 'em down ha rd all round and with my Stick beat th e sides close so that I made it capable of holding Water for a long Time  But now the Difficulty was how to get the Water there which at last I contriv'd very well for with my Shirt which was pretty fine I effected it by soaking it in Water for some Time and then afterwards it wou'd bear it very well so with this HollandBucket I cou'd carry two Gallons of Water at a Time which wou'd not leak out above a Pint in two hundred Yards so in two Days Time I had fill'd my Well  Now I began to think of Life again for a while for I had ready broil'd forty of these Boobies designing to allow my self half a one a Day I also made my self a Cu pboard of Earth by mixing Water with it which was four Foot in Length three in Heighth and two in Breadth though it lasted but four Days the Sun drying it so fast that it crack'd and afterwards fell in pieces What most amaz'd me and pleas'd me together was that my Boobies continu'd sweet without the least Taint I had a small  Ovid  printed  by  Elziver  which I had by good Fortune put in my Breeches Pocket when I was going up the Ladder of Ropes and by being press'd close in my Pocket was not quite spoil'd but only the Cover off and stain'd a little with the Wet This was a great Mitigation of my Misfortunes for I could entertain my self in this Book under a BurtonBush till I fell asleep I remain'd always in good Health only a little troubled with the HeadAch for want of a Hat which I lost in the Water in falling down from the Ladder of Ropes But I remedy'd this as well a I could by gathering a Parcel of ChickenWeed which grows there in Plenty and strewing it over the BurtonBushes under which I sate Nay at last finding my Time might be longer there than I expected I tore off one of the Sleeves of my Shirt and lin'd a wooden Cap that I had made of green sprigs and twisted with the green Bark that I peel'd off so that if I had been seen in this Figure I shou'd have appear'd like a Madman with the Basket of a Cudgel upon his Head  One Day coming from washing my self which I us'd often to do to cool me I heard a flouncing in the Water and turning my Head to see from whence the Noise  came I saw the oddest Fish I believe▪ that ever was known It had as I suppose chas'd some other Fish very eagerly and run it self too far on the Sand and the Tide being almost at the lowest it had left it there It was as near as I cou'd guess about fifteen Foot long it had a Head like a Horse and out of the Mouth came two Horns curl'd like a Ram's Horn only twice as large it had but one Eye and that was at the Extremity of the Nose it seem'd as it flounc'd to be something of a changeable Ashcolour with a Tail that taper'd to the End in a sharp Point it look'd so terrible to me that I was afraid to approach it as it labour'd it seem'd to groan it lay in this Hole of Water half an Hour with its Body in and its Tail out and as soon as the Tide came up to it it shak'd its Tail to and fro as a Dog does when he seems pleas'd all the while it felt the Water it struggled but now and then and at last when the Water was pretty high it turn'd its Head and made a Noise something like the Clucking of a Hen with Chickens but louder and when it had Water enough to swim away it lay moving up and down a quarter of an Hour being as I suppose hurt with its struggling A Gentleman of my Acquaintance advis'd me to leave this Description out for says  he No Body will believe it I reply'd I did not care for that as I was satisfied in my self it was true  I had been here now a Month by my Reckoning and in that Time my Skin look'd as if it had been rubb'd over with Walnutshells I had a Mind several Times to have swam to one of the other Islands but as they look'd only like Heaps of Sand I thought I had got the best Birth so contented my self with my own Station Boobies I could get enough who build on the Ground and another Bird that lays the Eggs which I us'd to eat but I never ventur'd to taste of 'em though as their Eggs were good we may suppose their Flesh was so too But however I was so well satisfied with my Boobies that I did not care to try Experiments  This Island which I was upon seem'd to me to be about two Miles in Circumference and was almost round and on the  West  side there's a good Anchoringplace for the Water is very deep within two Fathom of the Shore God forgive me but I often wish'd to have had Companions in my Misfortune and hop'd every Day either to have seen some Vessel come that way or a Wreck where perhaps I might  have found some Necessaries which I wanted But I wou'd often check my self in these Cogitations as not becoming a Christian yet they wou'd as often awake in my Mind in spight of all my Devotion and other good Thoughts it being natural to desire Company I us'd to fancy that if I shou'd be forc'd to stay there long I shou'd forget my Speech so I us'd to talk aloud ask my self Questions and answer 'em but if any Body had been by to have heard me they wou'd certainly have thought me bewitch'd I us'd to ask my self such odd Questions All this while I cou'd not inform my self where I was or how near any inhabited Place  One Morning which I took to be the th of  November  a violent Storm arose which continu'd till Noon when in the mean time I observ'd a Bark labouring with the Waves for several Hours and at last with the Violence of the Tempest was perfectly thrown out of the Water upon the shore within a quarter of a Mile from the Place where I observ'd 'em I ran to see if there was any Body I could be assisting to where I found four Men being all that was in the Vessel busy about saving what they could out of her When I came up with 'em and hail'd 'em in  English  they seem'd mightily surpriz'd they ask'd me how I came there and how long I had been there When I told 'em my Story they were all mightily concern'd for themselves as well as for me for they found there was no Possibility of getting their Bark off the Sands being the Wind had forc'd her so far With that we began to bemoan one another's Misfortunes but I must confess to you without lying I was never more rejoic'd in my whole Life for they had on Board plenty of every thing for a Twelvemonth and not any thing spoil'd Their Lading which was Logwood they had thrown over board to lighten their Ship which was the Occasion of the Wind forcing her so far Had they kept in their Lading they wou'd have bulg'd in the Sands half a quarter a Mile from the Place where they did and the Sea flying over 'em wou'd not only have spoil'd their Provisions but perhaps been the Death of 'em all By these Men I understood where we were  viz  upon one of the Isles of  Alcranes  which are five Islands or rather large Banks of Sand for there is not a Tree nor Bush upon any but that where we were they lie in the Latitude of twenty two Degrees  North  twenty five Leagues from  Jucatan  and about sixty from  Campeachy  Town We work'd as fast as we  cou'd and got out every Thing that wou'd be useful to us before Night We had six Barrels of salt Beef three of Pork two of Pease and two of Flower and eleven Barrels of Bisket a small Copper and an Iron Pot several wearing Cloaths and a spare Hat which I wanted mightily We had besides several Cags of Rum and one of Brandy and a Chest of Sugar with many other Things of Use some Gunpowder and one Fowlingpiece We took off the Sails from the Yards and with some pieces of Timber erected a Tent big enough to hold twenty Men under which we put their Beds that we got from the Bark 'Tis true we had no Shelter from the Weather for the Trees were so low that they were of no Use to us I now thought my self in a Palace and was as merry as if I had been at  Jamaica  or even at home in my own Country I cou'd joak now and then and tell a merry Tale In short when we had been there some Time we began to be very easy and to wait contentedly till Providence shou'd fetch us out of this Island The Bark lay upon the Sands fifty Yards from the Water when at the highest so that I us'd to lie in her Cabin by reason there was no more Beds ashore than was for my four Companions  viz Thomas  Randal  of  Cork  in  Ireland  whose Bed was largest which he did me the Favour to spare a part of now and then when the Wind was high and I did not care to lie on Board  Richard White  of  Port Royal William Musgrave  of  Kingston  in  Jamaica  and  Ralph Middleton  ofThese Men with eight others set out of  Port Royal  about a Month after us bound for the same Place But those others lying ashore and wandring too far up in the Country were met as 'tis suppos'd by some  Spaniards  and  Indians  who set upon 'em Yet by all Appearance they fought desperately for when Mr  Randal  and Mr  Middleton  went to seek for 'em they found all the eight dead with fifteen  Indians  and two  Spaniards  all the  Englishmen  had several Cuts in their Heads Arms Breasts c that made it very plainly appear they had sold their Lives dearly They were too far up in the Country to bring down their Dead so they were oblig'd to dig a Hole in the Earth and put 'em in as they lay in their Cloaths As for the  Indians  and  Spaniards  they strip'd 'em and left 'em above Ground as they found 'em and made all the haste they could to imbark for fear of any other unlucky Accident that might happen They set sail  as soon as ever they came on board and made the best of their way for  Jamaica  till they were overtaken by the Storm that shipwreck'd 'em on  Make Shift Island  as I had nam'd it When I told them of the strange Fish I had seen there was not any of 'em but Mr  Musgrave  that had seen it and he told me when he was a Prisoner in  Mexico  he had seen one there and they call'd it the  Ram Fish  but he told me I was mistaken concerning the Eyes for they were on the top of the Head but very small not bigger than a Musketball and that which I took for an Eye was a Hole that they sometimes spouted Water through This that he saw at  Mexico  was carried about for a Shew in a Cart but it was but eight Foot and a half in Length and was by Order of the Viceroy sent two Leagues into the Bay to be bury'd for it stunk so intolerably they were afraid it wou'd breed a Plague  Now we had all Manner of FishingTackle with us but we wanted a Boat to go a little way from Shore to catch Fish therefore we set our Wits to work in order to make some manner of Engine and at last we pitch'd upon this odd Project We took six Casks and tarr'd 'em all over  then stop'd up the Bungs with Cork and nail'd 'em close down with a piece of tarr'd Canvas these six Casks we ty'd together with some of the Cords of the Vessel and upon them we plac'd the Skuttles of the Deck and fix'd them and made it so strong that two Men might easily sit upon 'em but for fear a Storm shou'd happen we ty'd to one end of her a Coil or two of small Rope of five hundred Fathom long which we fix'd to a Stake on the Shore Then two of 'em went out as for my part I was no Fisherman in order to see what Success they shou'd have but return'd with only one  Nurse  a Fish so called about two Foot long something like a Shark only its Skin is very rough and when dry will do the same Office as a Sealskin The same boil'd in Lemonjuice is the only Remedy in the World for the Scurvy by applying some of the Skin to the Calfs of your Legs and rubbing your Body with some of the Liquor once or twice We sent out our Fishermen the next Day again and they return'd with two old  Wives  and a young  Shark  about two Foot long which we dress'd for Dinner and they prov'd excellent Eating In the Morning following we kill'd a young  Seal  with our FowlingPiece but first she was  so kind to give me a Blow on the Forehead that cut the Skin and bled very much which was done with her Fins for as they run towards the Water they throw backwards the Gravel as Horses do when they gallop hard this we salted and it eat very well after lying two or three Days in the Brine  The End of the first Book  THE VOYAGES AND ADVENTURES OF Capt  Richard Falconer  BOOK II  _WE past our Time in this  Makeshift Island  as well as we could we invented several Games to divert our selves One Day when we had been merry Sorrow as after Gaiety often  happens stole insensibly on us all I as being the youngest began to reflect on my sad Condition in spending my Youth on a Barren Land without Hopes of being ever redeem'd Whereupon Mr  Randal  being the Eldest rose up and made the following Speech as nigh as I can remember  Mr  Falconer  and my FellowSufferers but 'tis to you pointing at me that I chiefly address my Speech being you seem to despair of a Redemption from this Place as you call it more than any other of the same Condition Is not the Providence of a Power Supreme shewn in every Accident in the Life of Man even you your self how much better is your Condition now than you cou'd have imagin'd it wou'd have been a Month ago There is a Virtue in manly Suffering and to repine seems to doubt of the Allseeing Power which regulates our Actions If you seem conscious of your deserving as a Punishment for any Crime you have committed what has happen'd why do you not with a contrite Heart lift up your Voice  to Heaven and sincerely ask Forgiveness of all your past Offences and that Way free your self of those gross Errors that are crept into your weak Faith Think you that the Divine Providence that cast  Jonas  from the Bowels of the Whale has not that Retentive Power still left to aid and fetch us from this Place  I must confess tho' touch'd with what he said I could not forbear smiling at the Word  Retentive  which brought to my Mind an Image very diverting in an Accident that happen'd once to me in  England  since my Sea Adventures and perhaps one Time or other I may communicate to my Friends which I'm sure will divert 'em for my living on Shore for these six Years last past has been as extraordinary as my Adventures at Sea  Here pursu'd he we have every Thing that can be requir'd to satisfy Nature we have Beds to lie on and a Covering from the Weather we have Provisions for a Twelvemonth and if we shou'd continue here a longer Time we need not fear starving the very Island producing wherewithal to support Nature as  Eggs and Fowls and tho' there is no River or Rivulet of fresh Water yet it rains so frequently we need not fear even that being we have Vessels enough to save it in You have the least Reason to spurn at Providence of any one here that had only a Hole in the Earth to save your Water which had not lasted two Days longer before we very happily for you were thrown on Shore Is there not a Providence in being thrown on Land when you expected Drowning before the Morning dawn'd which happen'd otherwise Is there not a Providence in getting Food when you expected to starve Is there not a Providence in getting Fire by rubbing two Sticks which you know you could not effect since tho' we have all endeavour'd at it Was it not a Providence that your Boobies remain'd sweet even till the Day that we came here And was it not a Providence that we were thrown here which brought you all Sorts of Provisions I mean all that is necessary with Flint and Steel and other Utensils And can you then doubt of a farther Providence  that have had all these Besides even Company is some Allay to Sorrow you were alone before and had only your self to talk too Our Bark is strong and firm and by Degrees I don't doubt but with Time and much Labour to get her into the Water again I have been a Board her this Morning when you were all asleep and examin'd her carefully Inside and Out and fancy our Liberty may soon be effected I only wonder we have never thought before of clearing the Sand from our Vessel which once done I believe we may Launch her out into deep Water we have all our Tackling Sails and Masts entire without Damage I don't despair of the Mercy of God in working our Deliverance whose Ways are past the Knowledge of us poor insignificant Mortals I my self have more than once been in the same or worse Condition  In a Voyage I made twelve Years ago I suffer'd Shipwreck and not one Person sav'd but my self I set out from the City of  Cork  in  Ireland  on Board a Bark bound for the  Baltick  we past the  Straits  of  Elsenor  and  Helsinburgh  without meeting any thing material when one Evening it began to Thunder Lighten and Rain prodigiously the Storm was so violent that we expected every Moment when we should be drove on Shore on the Coast of  Sweedland  or  Norway  and be dash'd to Pieces The Storm continu'd so long that all our Masts came by the Board our Vessel sprung a Leak and the Water gain'd upon us every Moment at last it overpower'd us so much that we left Pumping as believing it impossible to save ourselves and recommended our Souls to the Mercy of the Lord At last our Ship sunk downright and most of our Men with it but I and two more had the good Fortune to lay hold of the MainMast that had been cut above Deck being it was sprung below and thrown Overboard to prevent any Danger which was tangled in some of the Cordage but the Ship sinking downright with the Rope that was turn'd to the MainMast gave it such a Tug that pull'd it under Water but afterwards loosing or slipping off by good  Fortune it rose with two of us again but the third was never seen after The other that sav'd himself upon the Mast was the Master a Man about Sixty Years old who held pretty well for about an Hour but at last thro' Weakness and Age recommending his Soul to God fell off but yet call'd for Help and I being willing to give laid hold of him which I had no sooner done but he grasp'd at me and laying fast hold of the Skirt of my Wastcoat having never a Coat on pull'd me off the Mast but with his Weight and some Strugling I made to save my self my Skirt rip'd off and the Master sunk to the Bottom and I by good Fortune laid hold of the Riging that hung to the Mast so once more got on stride it but with little Hopes of Life yet doing my Endeavour to save my self but with a Resignation to the Will of Heaven At last after being tossed about for two or three Hours more the End of the Mast rush'd with such Violence against a Rock as I suppos'd that with the Shock I was thrown off but laid hold of some of the Cordage again  and held fast till it fix'd it self in some of the craggy Cliffs of the Rock  By this Time the Tempest was very much abated and the Waves not dashing so often nor so fierce I found that the Mast hung on the craggy Clifts of the Rock which I climb'd up as fast as I could least another Wave should dash me against it and beat my Brains out After I had got as high as I could and out of Danger of the Waves I kneel'd down and return'd Thanks to the Almighty for my wonderful Deliverance which was wonderful indeed For tho' the Mast beat so often against the Rock yet I escap'd without being so much as bruis'd When I had poured out the Fullness of my Soul to the Allseeing Power that had protected me from such an imminent Danger I compos'd my self to sleep but with a Calmness wonderful even to my self wonderful in every Circumstance that the Almighty Providence should chuse me out of thirty poor Souls that perish'd in the stormy Deep for a Monument of his Mercy I slept but yet my Dreams were troubled I thought in my Sleep I  was cast on Shore upon a Barren Rock where there was not a Creature but my self no Food nor any Thing to sustain Nature which prov'd too true I was awak'd by something that lick'd my Face which in my Fright I laid hold on but soon let it go again upon finding it hairy which startled me very much and tho' it was still dark I could not go to sleep again for the Concern I was in for fear of some devouring Creature should come and seize me I listened and observed the Storm was laid and the Dawn approaching I began to compose my Mind and to put my Trust in him that had hitherto preserved me  When it came to be light enough to perceive any Object I rose up and began to view the Place when to my great Surprize I found it to be only a large Rock about half a Mile in Circumference as near as I could guess but the North Part so inaccessible there was no getting to the Top of it Looking about me I saw coming fawning towards me a large Bitch which  was the Creature had awak'd me by licking my Face I must confess I was surprized and pleas'd and made much of my new Companion I hop'd from it I should find some humane Creatures but searching about and not meeting with any I was more grieved than before yet still I resign'd my self to the Will of him that sees all Things and knew it was in his Power to fetch me out of Darkness and the Shadow of Death In walking up and down in a little Cavity of the Rock I met with seven young sucking Puppies that I found belong'd to the Bitch my Companion for she gave them suck which I stay'd a little while to observe Then a Thought came into my Head that this might be some resort for Fishermen and I should very shortly see some that would take me from this desolate Place  I began to search about for something to sustain Nature but could find nothing but some  Perriwinkles  and other little Shellfish which I ventured to feed upon for now I began to be very hungry I wonder'd mightily at my poor  Bitch how she got Food to support her self and her seven young Ones I observed she used to leave me two or three times a Day but return'd in a quarter of an Hour One Day I had the Curiosity to watch her but she went so fast that I could not come up to her but still I follow'd and at last came to the Point of a Rock where she went down and looking below saw her feeding upon a dead  Seal  but how it came there I could not suppose neither could I go down the Rock to see farther it being so dangerous a Place When she had eat her fill she came up again and went to give her young Ones suck I was mightily put to it for Water tho' there was good Quantities in several Cavities of the Rock but so hard to come at that sometimes I ventured breaking my Neck to get it besides I could not expect that would always last for the Sun was pretty warm tho' not intolerable I had in my Pocket a Knife and Fork and a Case of Lancets but they were rusted by being wet and of no use to me for I could get nothing to exercise 'em on  indeed my Fork serv'd me to twist out my Perriwinkles  I had been here now fifteen Days and nothing to feed on but these sort of Shellfish yet still my Strength and Health continued to a Miracle I slep'd well tho' my Bed was something hard It was compos'd of part of the Rigging that came on Shore with the Mast which I had untwisted and pull'd into  Oakham  and laid it under an hollow Part of the Rock where no Rain or Wind could hurt me unless it blew hard South which when it did would force a little into my BedChamber  Looking out one Day I saw a Boat coming towards my Rocky Island the sight rais'd my Spirits wonderfully but observing her narrowly I found she was only driving by the Wind and Tide without any one in her However I got down my Rock and waited for her coming on Shore which she did within twenty Yards of me I immediately got in her to rumage her and suprizing Providence found twenty dry'd Fish a SaltBox fill'd with Bisket and about half a  Pint of Brandy in a Bottle After giving God Thanks with great Sincerity of Soul I fell to and eat heartily There were two Oars in the Boat a BoatHook a small FisherNet and a TinderBox with a Grapling Iron and Rope for a Cable Upon this I began to be exceeding easy and thought my self to be in a happy Condition I brought my Fish on Shore and stow'd it in my BedChamber and over it for fear of my Bitch put several Pieces of Ropes I had a Tinder Box and could strike a Light but had no Candle to burn nor any Provision to dress  After I had settled every Thing as I would have it I resolv'd to take my Boat and go round the Rock to see if I could discover any Thing on the other side of the inaccessible Part Whereupon I took two of my dry'd Fish and Half a Dozen Biskets and put my self on Board but my poor Bitch came to the Shore Side and took on so mightily that I went and took her in I row'd half round as near as I could guess the first Day but what made me  so long was that in some Places I was oblig'd to row half a League from Shore to avoid some Shallows which lay out towards the North East side I ventured to lie in my Boat all Night and the next Morning went onward in my Voyage and at last came to that Part of the Rock that I could not get over when I was a Shore Here I found upon the Ground a Nest of Eggs about the Bigness of a Duck Egg yet I could not discover what Fowl own'd them but I took 'em all away and ventured to suck one of them which I found as pleasant as a new laid Hen Egg Here the Bitch grew very uneasy and by her whining and fruitless Endeavours to pass the Rock which was Perpendicular let me understand she wanted to be with her Puppies Finding nothing here for my Benefit but my Eggs I got on Board and endeavoured to go round which I did till I came to the Place where the Seal lay that my Bitch found but it stunk abominably yet she fell to and after having eat ran up the Rock and so as I suppose to her Puppies I went on  Board again but there arose such a Fog of a suddain that I could hardly see the Length of the Boat so rather chose to go back again than venture farther out of my Knowledge which I did in a little time the Sea being higher over the Sand and arrived at my own Habitation  I pull'd up my Boat as high as I could and went on Shore and coming to visit my young Companions found the weakest dead for want of the Dam which I immediately took cut open and flay'd off the Skin when after being dry'd I made me a Cap of by cutting it in form and sewing it together with some fine Rope Yarn that I twisted on pupose and my Fork I us'd instead of a Needle The Fat serv'd me to make Candles in this Manner by pulling to Pieces some Rope Yarn and twisting it hard then I struck a Light and with an EggShell heated my Fat and drew the Rope Yarn thro' it so I provided my self with a new sort of Candle But then I had but a small Piece of Match and when that should be gone I should be at a strange loss how to light my Candle  Finding my Provision decrease I came to an Allowance of a Quarter of a Fish a Day and Half a Bisket and not to touch that if I could get any Shellfish which began to be scarce too for some Days I could not find above Ten or Twelve and when I came first there I us'd to take 'em up by Handfuls Upon this I began to reflect that Winter was approaching and consequently very cold Weather and then perhaps I should not get any Food I resolved within my self to venture in my Boat and sail which way the Wind should direct me but then I was put to it for a Sail for we had cut off the Yards and Sails of the Main Mast before we threw it over Board but at last I thought of a White Dimitty Wastcoat that I wore which was lin'd with Linnen this I unript and sew'd together again so pieced the Lining to the Outsides and made me a tolerable Sail But in the mean time the Wind blew so high that I durst not venture out and continued so long that my Provision was diminish'd to two Fish which almost put me to my Wits End  ShellFish were not to be had So at last I resolv'd to kill one of my Bitch's Whelps which I did made a Fire with some Boards I found at the Bottom of my Boat and roasted it 'twas palatable and eat wonderfully well they being not two Months old  I don't question but you'll all laugh at me when I shall tell you that it went very much against me to kill this harmless Creature but my Necessity had no Law besides I had observ'd but two Days before that the Seal which was the Dam's Food was gnaw'd to the Bones In short after some Strugglings with my self I kill'd five of the six and salted two of 'em for after eating my Biskets out of the SaltBox I found a Handful or two of Salt at the Bottom which I made use of in that Manner The Intrails I boil'd and gave to the Dam and other Puppy who eat of it heartily making no Scruple tho' their own Flesh and Blood The sixth and last Puppy I resolv'd not to kill at all if I could help it it being so like the Dam and wou'd always be with me if it  could when the others would only play about the Hole where they lay  In short I began to find the Weather cold and so resolv'd to set sail in my Boat with my two Companions my Bitch and Puppy and on the st of  September  after being on the Rock from  May  the th I set sail with the Wind about N E a middling Gale and steering with my other Oar for you must know my BoatHook was my Mast and a piece of slit Wood that I sav'd from the Fire was my Yard so that I cou'd make shift to ply it to Windward upon Occasion but was resolv'd to sail before the Wind till I discover'd Land but my Boat being pretty large and my Sail but small I could not make my Way as I might have done with a Sail fitted to the Boat so that I could not discover Land that Night but sail'd on till about Midnight then I was so fatigu'd that in Spite of my self I was oblig'd to lie along in the Boat and fell asleep and slept till I was awaken'd by a Fisherman in a Boat whom I understood not but found by his Dialect to be a  Dane  I gave him  to understand my Condition by speaking and Signs together which he seem'd to be sorry for by beating his Breast and shaking his Head  He carry'd me aShore to a Village where they made very much of me and gave me Cloaths but I would not stir without my Dogs My Boat was sold and the Money gave me for my own Use After I had stay'd at the Village three Days I was carry'd to  Copenhagen  to Mr  Bridgwater  the Factor for several  English  Merchants who made a Gathering for me which amounted to twenty seven Pounds in  English  Money The King of  Denmark  sent a Person to me who understood  English  very well and took down the Particulars of my Voyage in the  Danish  Language that I saw afterwards printed there but no one could ever fix upon the Rock that I lived on One said it was such a One another such a One and some conjectur'd it to be a Part of the Main Land of  Sweden  which I should have found if I had ventured further when hinder'd by the Fog  But I forgot to tell you that by Printing this Account a Man came to demand his Boat that he said he had lost by the Carelessness of a Boy to whom he had given it in Charge who neglecting to fasten it on Shore it drove out to Sea and came where I had the good Fortune to meet with it or rather guided by the Eye of Providence to be the Means or Instrument of saving my Life which but for that I must have inevitably lost The Fisherman that own'd the Boat had a New One given him in the Room on't and to the Value of five Pounds for the Things it contain'd  The Gentleman that was order'd to take the Notes mention'd above brought me a Hundred  English  Guineas collected from Merchants and Gentlemen of the City The King likewise order'd me a Hundred more from his Privy Purse so that in  November  the th I went on Board an  English  Ship call'd the  Happy  Captain  John Gibson  Commander We immediately set sail for  London  and arriv'd at  Debtford December  the th being  ChristmassDay  but finding  Things out of Order in  England  I thought it was no Place to settle in So  January  the st I took Horse for  Bristol  and from thence embark'd for  Cork  where I had some small Effects and happily arriv'd there  January  the th where I was welcom'd from Death by all my Friends  But I forgot one Thing which happened to me at  Copenhagen  Dining with the Gentleman that spoke  English  very well and several other  Danes  I happened to drink to him in  English  with  Sir My humble Service to you  and ask'd him if he would  Pledge me  Upon which he told me I must never mention Pledging among  Danes  for added he 'tis the greatest Affront you can put upon 'em How so Sir says I Why says he I know 'tis your Custom in  England  but if you all knew the Meaning of it you would surely abolish it Whereupon I press'd him to tell me the Foundation of that Custom according to his Notion Why says he when the  Danes  invaded  England  and got the Better of the Natives they us'd often to eat and drink together  but still allowing the  Danes  to be their Masters And very often upon some Pique or Interest they us'd even to stab 'em when they were lifting the Cup to their Mouths Upon the  English  being frequently murder'd in this Manner they contriv'd at last when they were at Meals or drinking with the  Danes  to say to their next Neighbour  Here's to you  upon which the other cry'd  I'll pledge you  Which was as much as to say he would be his Surety or Pledge while the other drank and accordingly the other would guard him while he drank When done the other would drink and then he that drank before was to stand his Pledge likewise Nay it came to be such a Custom at last that when one  Englishman  came into the Company of several  Danes  he wou'd say in taking up his Cup to his next Neighbour Will you Pledge me with an Emphasis upon the others answ'ring he would he might drink without Fear  After staying the Winter at  Cork  I design'd to embark with Captain  Clarke  on Board the Ship  Gilliflower  and accordingly  we set out from  Cork April  the d for  Boston  in  NewEngland  and so for  Virginia  we arriv'd at  Boston June  the d having a quick Passage After having done our Business there we set sail for  Virginia  We doubled  CapeCod  without any Danger but one Night a Storm rose that flung us on Shore upon the Main within six Leagues of  CapeCharles  where our Men were all sav'd but in a poor Condition Our Ship lying upon the Sands a Furlong from Shore fourteen out of twenty of our Men that could swim went into the LongBoat and went on Board the Ship to get some Necessaries as soon as they had got what they wanted they came towards the Shore again but the Boat being deeply Laden could not come nigh enough to Shore to unload so that they resolv'd to go farther to seek for deeper Water and bid us follow along the Shore which we did but they doubling a Point of Land we lost Sight of 'em However we follow'd on still when going over a little Swamp we perceiv'd several  Indidians  in a Wood on our RightHand  Whereupon we began to be in a desperate Fright but still we march'd on when coming to the Skirt of the Wood they let fly their Arrows at us which kill'd one of our Companions and wounded two more one in the Arm and the other in the Side of the Neck as for my part I still remain'd unhurt but had an Arrow sticking in the Sleeve of my Watchcoat After the  Indians  had fir'd they ran to us with incredible Swiftness whereupon having no Weapons we kneel'd down to 'em and implor'd their Mercy One among 'em spoke  English  pretty well who said You  Englishmen  WhiteMen we will kill you to be reveng'd of your Brothers at  I amestown  who kill us many  Indians  we will take you to our  Werowance  i e  King  and he will order us to burn you where we will drink your Blood and feed upon your Flesh They hurry'd us along that Night at least twenty Miles up in the Country and next Morning brought us to their Village where was their  Werowance  sick in his Cabin but hearing of our coming he rose up and with several  of his Officers who are call'd  Cockorooses  came towards us After he had examin'd the  Indians  as we suppose how we were taken he order'd a great Fire to be made and had us all ty'd to one Stake fix'd in the Earth but we were no sooner ty'd and the Signal given for firing the Wood about us but we were unty'd and brought back to the Tent to stay as we were inform'd till the next Day till more  Indians  could come to be Spectators of our Tragedy They had strip'd us Naked and in my BreechesPocket had found my Box of Instruments which they examin'd very narrowly and ask'd which of us it belong'd to When they were inform'd it was mine I was immediately sent for before the  Werowance  who ask'd me by his Interpreter the Name and Use of every Instrument which I inform'd him When he came to my Lancets and being inform'd they were to Bleed he ask'd in a great Passion if I was the Murderer of the  Indians  that were taken by the  English  But when I let him know it was to let Blood in many Distempers for Ease for the Body  and that we were Strangers to those  English  that kill'd their  Indians  he abated of his Anger and ask'd me if I could show how I let Blood which I told him I could if any one wanted it and was not well Whereupon the  Werowance  said he was not very well but he would have me try upon one of my Companions before he would let me Bleed him I told his Interpreter that he should tell him I would feel his Pulse that I might know whether 'twas proper to let him Blood or no Feel his Pulse what's that says the Interpreter and thought I meant something else whereupon I took him by the Hand and showed him what I meant When the Interpreter had satisfy'd him with what I said he beckon'd me to him and held out his Hand which I felt and found he was in a high Fever I told the Interpreter that he must be let Blood for his Indisposition was a Fever and explain'd his Distemper which he finding to agree with his Condition seem'd to be mightily pleas'd but he would have me Bleed some one of my Companions before him  I pitch'd upon one that it would not injure and Bled him upon the Ground till he had Bled enough and then ty'd up his Arm The  Werowance  and the rest of the  Indians  were amaz'd to see him Bleed such a Quantity and ask'd me if he must Bleed as much I told 'em yes or rather more but that I wou'd have something to save the Blood because I could make a better Judgment of the Cause of his Distemper Whereupon they brought me a  Callibash  which I suppos'd might hold a Quart and upon this I ty'd up his Arm and let him Bleed till I had taken about Sixteen Ounces from him so ty'd up his Arm again When I had done he wanted to go into his Hammock to sleep but I told him he must not go to rest till Night which he comply'd with The next Day he was much better and sent for me again from the Place where they had kept us waking all Night by Singing and Dancing round us and if any of us offer'd to sleep they would jogg us and hinder us When I came to him I unbound his Arm  and he looking at the Orifice and finding it clos'd was more amaz'd than before then he made his Interpreter ask me concerning his Blood which was corrupted and when I told him if I had not Bled him he would soon have dy'd he got up and made me sit down upon a Mat which lay in his Cabbin and told me by his Interpreter if I would stay with him he would save both me and my Companions if we would Fight against the  Whites  and Marry  Indian  Women that should be allotted us I told him I would ask my Companions who rejoyc'd at the Proposals and tho' all marry'd before yet they made no Scruple of having another Wife As for my self tho' not marry'd I did not much care for such a tawny Rib therefore told the  Werowance  none of our Profession ever marry'd he being well satisfy'd with this Answer spar'd all our Lives For my part I had a House allotted me to my self that is a Place about the Height of one Story with us and cover'd with the Barks of Trees the FirePlace is in the Middle of the House and all the Chimney  is the Door The Country is generally pretty even and agrees very well with an  English  Constitution I need not describe the Climate being I suppose you all know the Nature of it as well as I All the  Indians  that ever I saw were well Limb'd and near Six Foot high  The Marriages were made the next Day without much Ceremony they were only join'd by their Priests without any Question on either Side and so carry'd Home to their several Tents All the while I was here they were making Preparations to go against the  English  One Day I was sent for and ordered to feel the Pulse of the King after I had done he asked me if I could tell any thing of the Affairs of the  English  by feeling the Pulse but I told him that was impossible without I was with 'em in Person Whereupon the King asked me if I would go to the  English  and come to him again and give him a true Account of 'em but says he you must leave your  Sagamore  meaning my Box of Instruments behind you I told him I would make it my Business  to inform my self in every Particular but that I did not know the Way he told me I should have a  Canoe  and Four  Indians  that should carry me within a League of the  English  I must confess I went with Joy and Sorrow with Joy to leave such a cursed Place where Death threatened me every Day with Sorrow to go without my Companions We went into our Canoe which lay about six Miles from the Place where the King liv'd but took no Provisions with us because my  Indians  were to provide for me by catching of Fish in which they are very dexterous We went down the River that the  Indians  call'd  Kuskarra  River till we came to  ChesapeackBay  then we row'd in our Canoe past  Russels  Islands and made toward  Cape  or  PoyntComfort  but coming about a League or thereabouts near the Island a Boat came down the River and upon what Account I can't tell but they fir'd a Musquet which being heard by the  Indians  they immediately jump'd Overboard and swam back again to Shore I was not much concerned I must own for there  was no Danger of their being drowned for most  Indians  swim like Fishes I took the Paddles and made the best of my Way to  PoyntComfort  which I pass'd and enter'd  Powhattan  River being directed by my  Indians  so to do and directed my Way to  Lamestown  where I arriv'd very late and was mightily rejoyc'd to find my Companions all well in Health and ready to embark the next Day for  Boston  in a Vessel bound for that Place After refreshing my self and selling my Canoe I with the rest of the Company set sail the next Day and after various Adventures am arriv'd where you see me  Now think with your self Mr  Falconer  whether we need doubt the Providence of God in helping us from this Island There's nothing here like the Hardships I have undergone and yet have been happily freed from and therefore you need not despair Despair is the Frenzy of the Mind and ought to be avoided by having a true Notion of the Power we serve Upon this I happen'd to smile but was mightily check'd by Mr  Randal  who asked me with a clouded  Countenance what I smil'd at I replyed his Story might have had the same Effect upon some old Women if it were in Print that the Sufferings of our Saviour had upon a Person in Years What mean you by that said Mr  Randal  Why Ill tell you but I would not have you angry at it for I really believe every thing you have said to me But a Reverend Divine once at  Stamford  in  Lincolnshire  was preaching a Sermon upon Christ's Passion where he expatiated on the many Sufferings and what our Saviour underwent to redeem us Mortals from the Curse that was laid upon us An old Woman one of the Auditors took the Parson by the Sleeve as he went out of the Church and said to him Indeed Sir you have made a very feeling Sermon which has mov'd me very much and more especially to ask you a Question or two Say on good Woman says the Parson Pray then Sir says she how long is it ago since this Matter happen'd Almost Seventeen Hundred Years ago And how far off added the old Gentlewoman A great Way off some  Three or Four Thousand Miles from hence Alack aday cry'd the Woman I'm glad on't Why so says the Parson Because added she 'tis so long ago and so far off I hope in God it is not true As to your own Belief Mr  Falconer  said he I leave it to your self but I don't like jesting with Sacred Things The old Woman's Ignorance was Compassion your Knowledge seems to be profane I have known a great many airy young Fellows that have talk'd idly on such Things to make People have an Opinion of their Wit but yet I believe even in the very Time of their Utterance their Conscience told 'em the very doing what was not pleasing to God or Man I really took Mr  Randal  's Way of expressing himself very kindly and as I ought for there appear'd so much Sincerity and Candour in all that he said that it would move any one that had a Sense of Heaven or Humane Nature Therefore I beg'd his Pardon and was heartily sorry if I had said ought that might any ways offend him which he freely forgave After we had spent the Night in Reflection  of what had past the next Morning we after imploring the Assistance of the Almighty went to Work to clear the Sand from our Vessel which we continued working on for Days together resting only on  Sunday  which at last we effected We had thrown up the Sand on each side down from our Vessel quite to the Surface of the Water when it was lowest Now the next Thing we had to do was to get Poles to put under our Vessel to Launch her out which we got from the  Burton  Wood but with much difficulty being we were forced to cut a great many before we could get them that were fit for our Purpose After we had done this we returned God Thanks for our Success hitherto and on the Day foling resolved God willing to thrust off our Vessel into the Water but was prevented by Mr  Randal  's being taken Ill of a Fever occasioned as we suppose by his great Fatigue in working to free our Ship from the Sand wherein he spared no Pains for to encourage us as much by his Actions as his Words even beyond  his Strength The Concern we were all in upon this occasioned our delay in not getting our Vessel out besides one Hand out of Five was a weakning our Strength Mr  Randal  never thought of his Instruments till now which he wanted to let himself Blood but not feeling them about his Cloaths we suppos'd they might have been overlook'd in the Vessel so I ran immediately to see if I could find them and getting up the Side my very Weight pull'd her down to the Sand which had certainly bruis'd me to Death if I had not by the Appointment of divine Providence sunk into the Hollow that we had made by throwing the Sand from the Ship I crept out in a great Fright and ran to my Companions who with much ado got her upright and afterwards we fixed some spare Oars on each side to keep her up from falling again For the Pieces of Wood that we had placed under her were greas'd to facilitate her sliping into the Water and we had dig'd the the Sand so entirely from her that she rested only on 'em which occasioned  her leaning to one side with my Weight only which had not happened I believe if I had endeavour'd to have got on Board on the other side which was highest but chusing the lowest for my more easy Entrance was the Cause of the Accident that happened to me When we were enter'd into the Vessel and found our Endeavours to find the Box of Instruments fruitless we were all mightily concerned for we verily believed that bleeding would have cured him nay even he himself said that if he could be let Blood he was certain his Fever would abate and he should be easier yet to see with what a perfect Resignation he submitted to the Will of Heaven it would have inspired one with a true Knowledge of the Being good Men enjoy after a Dissolution from this painful Life He was still worse and worse but yet so Patient in his Sufferings that perfectly amaz'd us all He continued in this Manner a whole Week without tasting any Thing but Watergruel ill made for what little Oatmeal we had was sower When we saw by the Course of Nature  it was impossible he should last long we all were very much griev'd as for my own Part I could not forbear shedding Tears for I had taken such an Affection to him that almost equall'd a Child's Love to a Parent He seeing me weep call'd me with a faint Voice towards him and when I was near him he made me sit down by him After several kind Expressions which made my Tears flow more plentifully he said to me Mr  Falconer  if you grieve for me dry your Tears I desire nothing but your Prayers I am going to pay a Debt incumbent on me by Nature and a Debt that must be paid which was contracted at my Birth and Death will not admit of any Evasion all Mortals owe the same Acknowledgment but some squander away that Substance which should be freely paid when call'd for How happy are they that provide against such a Creditor that may come at any Hour of Day or Night and lawfully demand his due Here is no Shuffling as in worldly Matters no putting off the important Visiter therefore as we are sure he will call upon us  'tis good to be always provided against the Time How happy are honest Minds when they have provided to satisfy their worldly Creditors they then live in a Contentment of Mind peculiar to an honest Heart But what must be said for the last Debt upon which depends the Welfare of the Soul our doing well or ill hereafter is it not of the utmost Importance Therefore as I am endeavouring to pay that Debt whose utmost Limit will soon expire help me by your Prayers to finish what I hope I have well begun and as Friend's Advice prepare to make up your Accounts to Heaven for you know not how soon they may be call'd for besides you will have one less to eat of the Provision is left After this being tir'd with speaking so much together he turn'd to rest himself but his Fever was so violent he could take no ease in Body tho' tranquil in Mind So finding we could not expect his Life we pray'd for a speedy and a painless Release from it After this we gave him some Water which he often beg'd for in vain to cool his Mouth When he had  drank it he said he found himself a little easier and the Pain and Burning something abated which we took as a lightning before Death or as the Spirits collected together to make their last fruitless Efforts  When he found himself just upon the Point of expiring he made this short Prayer which was so imprinted in my Memory that I shall never forget it O Almighty Creator of Heaven and Earth whose allseeing Eye looks into the inmost Corner of the Heart pardon my Offences which I heartily repent of and rely upon the infinite Grace of thy wonted Mercy to absolve me of all my past Crimes through the Merits of my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ Then lifting up his Hands and Eyes to Heaven expired with the Happiness of continuing in his right Senses in such a Fever which is almost always attended with a Frenzy  After our Sorrow for his Death was something abated we consulted how to bury him Mr  Middleton  and Mr  Musgrave  were for sewing him in his Hammock  and throwing him into the Sea But Mr  White  and my self were for burying him on the Land which they agreed to so we dig'd the Hole which I designed for my Well Seven Foot long and Seven deep and return'd him to Earth from whence he came Upon the Bark of the Tree that shaded his Grave I wrote this Epitaph  Under this Tree lies the Body of  Thomas Randal  Gent born in the City of  Cork Anno Domini  who was thrown ashore with  Richard White William Musgrave  and  Ralph Middleton  both of  Jamaica  to the Consolation of  Richard Falconer  of  Bruton  in  Somersetshire  who was unfortunately cast on Shore before them on the th of of  September  yet received from their Conversation a Mitigation of his own Misfortune Whose Chance it is ever to read these Lines pay a Tear to the Memory of  Thomas Randal  and endeavour to make as good an End as he did who died a Natural Death on  Friday December  the st in his perfect Mind and a true Notion of the  Power of God to pardon all his Faults whose Failings were corrected by a sincere Penitence dying every Day he lived  This took me up a whole Tree Mr  Randal  made no Will yet I claimed his Dog being the Whelp of the Bitch he found upon the Rock which he was thrown upon in the  Baltick  the Bitch being Dead some Years before We were forced to tie him up after we had buried Mr  Randal  for with his Feet he would scrape Holes in the Grave two Foot deep and howl prodigiously  After this we prepared once more to Launch our Vessel but first we put on Board what Provision we had left and all the Things that we took from thence Mr  Randal  's Death gave me with the others Permission a Title to a Bed which I wanted before So that I took up the Cabin which was alloted me and laid on Board every Night And now we bent our Thoughts intirely on our Vessel and on  Monday  the st of  December  launch'd her out into the Sea and design'd to set Sail the next Day After we had fix'd her fast with two Anchors  and a Halser on Shore we went on Board to Dine and make ourselves Merry which we did very heartily and to add to our Mirth we made a large Can of Punch which we never attempted to do before being we had but one Bottle of Lime Juice in all and was what indeed we design'd for this Occasion in short the Punch ran down so merrily that we were all in a drunken Condition but when it was all gone we resolved to go to rest But all I could do could not persuade 'em to lie on Board that Night in their Cabins yet without a Bed but they would venture tho' they were obliged to swim a hundred Yards before they could wade to Shore but however they got safe which I knew by their hollowing and rejoicing  Having brought my Bed on Board I went to rest very contentedly which I did till next Morning But oh Horror when I had drest my self and going on Deck to call my Companions to come on Board to Dine which was intended over Night and afterwards to go on Shore and bring our Sails and Yards on  Board and make to Sea as fast as we could I could not see any Land which so overcame me on the Suddain that I sunk down on the Deck without Sense or Motion How long I continu'd so I can't tell but I awak'd full of the Sense of my lamentable Condition and ten thousand Times spight of my Resolution to forbear curs'd my unhappy Stars that had brought me to that deplorable State O Wretch that I am what will my unhappy Fate do with me is any one's Condition equal to mine I would cry But 'tis a just Punishment in not rendering to God the Tribute due for his Mercies that we had hitherto known Instead of coming on Board to be Frolicksome and Merry we should have given Thanks to him that gave us the Blessing of thinking we were no longer subject to such Hardships that we might probably have undergone if we had been detain'd longer on that Island If poor Mr  Randal  had remain'd among us this Misfortune had not happened He by his wise and prudent Care and Conduct would have prevented this unlucky Accident What  must my poor Companions think that are left in a more miserable Condition than my self if it be possible I have no Compass neither am I of my self capable of ruling the Vessel in a Calm much less if there should a Storm happen which are too frequent in this Climate  After I had vented my Grief in a Torrent of Words and Tears I began to think how the Vessel should have gone to Sea without my Knowledge and by Remembrance of the Matter the Night before found by our Eagerness and fatal Carelessness we had forgot to fasten our Cables to the Geers and pulling up the Halser that we had fasten'd to one of the  Burton  Trees on Shore perceiv'd that the Force of the Vessel had pull'd the Tree out of the Earth Then I too late found that a Hurricane had rose when I was sound asleep and stupify'd by too much Liquor and carry'd off the Vessel This Reflection wounded me deeper than before which I follow'd with Curses on that Liquor that steals away our Senses and makes worse than Beasts of Humane Creatures  Now I began to call upon him that hears us in the Time of Trouble even when the Wind blows loudest whose Nod can shake the Frame of Earth from off its Basis and with a Heart sincere and vicious Thoughts corrected I sent my Soul in Penitential Words and Tears before his Throne of Mercy imploring a speedy Ending of my Life or Troubles when I began to be something better contented in my Mind and thought of sustaining Nature almost spent with the Fatigue and Grieving One great Comfort I had of my Side which my poor former wretched Companions wanted that was Provision in Plenty and fresh Water so that when I began to consider coolly I found I had not that Cause to complain which they had who were left on a Barren Island without any other Provision than that very same Diet which I was forc'd to take up with when first thrown on Shore that is the Boobies whose Numbers were mightily diminish'd before we design'd to leave the Island  What made me most uneasy was to think what my Companions could judge  of me whether they should take it for Design or Chance but then I still'd that Thought by knowing they must needs see that the Tree was forc'd away with Violence beyond the Strength of Man Besides I had another small Comfort that was the Company of my Dog which lay on Board with me which I us'd to talk to as if he were a rational Creature and the poor Creature wou'd stand and stare me in the Face as if he were sensible of what I said to him It was a very handsome Creature of the  Danish  Kind but very goodnatured and would often go to the Cabbin where I lay which was that of his old Master's and whine mightily  I remain'd toss'd upon the Sea for a Fortnight without discovering Land for the Weather continu'd very calm but yet so hazy that I could not perceive the Sun for several Days One Day searching for some Linnen that I had drop'd under the Sacking of my Bed for I did not lie in a Hammock I found an old Glove with Pieces of Eight in't which I took and sew'd in the WasteBand  of my Breeches for fear I should want it some time or other I made no Scruple of taking it for I was well assured it did belong to poor Mr  Randal  Beside I had heard the other People say that they were sure he had Money somewhere and after his Death we search'd for it but could not find any  January  the th I discover'd a Sail to Leeward of me but she bore away so fast that there was not any Hope of Succour from her and I had not any Thing to distinguish me and I suppos'd tho' I could see them yet they could not see me by Reason of my want of Sail which would have made me the more conspicuous The next Day I discovered Land about six Leagues to the S W of me which I observ'd my Vessel did not come nigh but coasted along Shore but I was well assured it was the Province of  Jucatan  belonging to the  Spaniards  and was the Place we came from now all my Fear was that I should fall into their Hands who would make me do the Work of a Slave but even that I thought was better than to live in continual  Fear of Storms and Tempests or Shipwreck  I coasted along in this Manner for two or three Days and at last discover'd Land right ahead which I was very glad of but yet mix'd with some Fear in not knowing what Treatment I should have I began now to think of some Evasion and not to tell 'em the Truth of belonging to the Logwood Vessel but resolv'd to tell 'em that we were taken by a  French  Privateer and after being rumag'd were turn'd off as useless  January  the th I made the Bay and Town of  Francisco di Campeche  as it prov'd afterwards and was almost upon it before I was met by any Thing of a Ship or a Boat but at last two Canoes came on Board with one  Spaniard  and six  Indians  who were much surpriz'd when they understood my Condition by speaking broken  French  which the  Spaniard  understood They immediately carry'd me on Shore and from thence to the Governor who was at Dinner they would have had me staid till he had din'd but he hearing of me commanded  me to come in where he was at Dinner with several Gentlemen and two Ladies and tho' 'tis very rare any one sees the Women yet they did not offer to Veil themselves I was ordered to sit down by my self at a little Table placed for that Purpose where I had sent me of what composed their Dinner which was some fresh Fish and Fowls and excellent Wine of several Sorts  The Chief Town of the Province of  Jucatan  lies twelve Leagues from the Sea on either Side which is a Bishop's See and the Resident of the Governor of this Province  Valladolid  is the second City and  Campeche  the third yet tho' but the third reckon'd it far exceeds the rest for Riches and Magnificence It is a well situated neat built Town and by Computation contains near Two Thousand Houses It is well fortified both by Art and Nature By the former in a strong well built neat Castle that contains a Hundred Brass Cannon and several Mortars and the latter by a Ridge of Hills that runs all along the Side of the City There is in the Castle a very neat Piazza  consisting of about Thirty high Arches This Town has the chiefest Trade for from this Place the other Cities and Towns are furnished with all Necessaries that come from the  Havana  and other Places in  America  and likewise from  Old Spain  Yet for all their Power Riches and Strength Capt  Parker  an  Englishman  with one Ship and a small Bark and whose whole Crew contain'd but a Hundred and Forty Men Landed in the Middle of the Day and in Spite of all their Forces which were Two Hundred Horse and Five Hundred Foot took the Place with the Governor and several other Persons of Quality together with a rich Ship laden with Ingots and several other valuable Ladings before they knew of the City's being taken This Province of  Jucatan  contains in Compass Nine Hundred Miles and is situated between Eighteen and Twenty Degrees Northern Latitude The Air is very hot and not altogether so Wholesome as some other Parts of  America  are The Distempers that reign here are mostly Fluxes and Feavers which  carry off Abundance of New Comers This Province was first discover'd by  Ferdinando Cortez  among his Conquests of  New Spain  and tho' not altogether so Fruitful yet by the Industry of the Inhabitants 'tis as Rich as any of the other Provinces of  New Spain  for they are most either Merchants or Tradesmen And 'tis the Vulgar Opinion that these People are more hard and barbarous than any other Part of the  Spanish WestIndies  yet for my own part I receiv'd more Civility by 'em than if I had been among my own Friends in  England  There is a Tradition here among the Inhabitants that they us'd a Ceremony much like our Baptism and which had in their Language the Term of Regeneration or Second Birth which they thought to be the Seed or Groundwork of all good and just Things and after being initiated they were certain it was not in the Power of the Evil Spirit to hurt 'em in Body or Goods Neither were they permitted to Marry without first taking that Order upon 'em which they us'd to distinguish by an  Ostriche  's  Feather larger and longer than any other they us▪d to wear for Ornaments upon their Heads  They have another Tradition that this Province of  Jucatan  was first Inhabited and Cultivated by a WhiteBearded People that came from the East after being toss'd many Moons upon the Sea and suffering many Hardships for Want of Food and Fresh Water and other Necessaries yet reliev'd from Want and their Enemies through the Power of the Deity they Worship'd who even commanded the Sun to Shine or not Shine who made it Rain or dry Weather who could heal Sickness or send Distempers in short a God that kept all the other petty Deities in Awe  This Story if true seems to confirm an old Tradition of our  Welsh  Chronicles that tell us of one  Madoc ap Owen  Son to  Guineth  a Prince of that Country who was drove by some Disgust from his own Country with several Companions who after various Adventures at Sea were driven on an unknown Land to the West many Hundred Leagues  where they had Communication in a friendly Manner with the  Indians  and made a Settlement Whereupon  Madoc ap Owen  return'd for  Britain  again and got to the Number of Two Thousand Men and Women besides Children which mix'd with the Natives and left among 'em several of their Opinions and Manners which they retain'd till the last when  Cortez  subdu'd 'em but now by the Cruelty of the  Spaniards  the Natives are almost extinguished  After they had feasted me for two or three Days they sent me about with several Officers appointed by the Governour to make a Gathering which we did with Success for in Three Days we had got Seven Hundred and odd Pieces of Eight And Two Merchants there were at the Charge of fitting up my Bark in Order to send it for my poor Companions When it was finish'd they gave me several Necessaries for my self and Companions to hearten us up as some Bottles of fine Wines Two Bottles of CitronWater for a Cordial Chocolate and several other useful Things But the Difficulty  was to get Seamen to go with me At last they remembered they had Five  Englishmen  that were Prisoners there and taken in the Bay of  Campeche  upon Suspicion of Piracy but nothing could be prov'd against 'em which they Freed without any Ransom This did not look like Barbarity or IllNature for I receiv'd as much Humanity among 'em as could be expected from any of the most Civiliz'd Nations But they have a greater Kindness for the  English  than they have for their Neighbours the  French  being the  English  are more open and generous they say and don't use Stratagems to deceive 'em as the  French  do frequently tho' they only pay 'em in their own Coin for there is no Nation under the Sun more fruitful than the  Spaniards  in Plottings and Ambuscades as they call 'em to deceive their Enemies which yet they think lawful  On  February  the th we set sail from  Campeche  Bay after paying my Acknowledgment to the generous Governour c but having nothing to present him with worth Acceptance but my  Ovid  I gave him that which he took very kindly and said he would prize it mightily not only in having never a one but in Remembrance of me and my Misfortunes  We ply'd it to Windward very briskly and in Fifteen Days discover'd the Isles of the  Alcranes  but we durst not go in within the Shoals because we were all ignorant of the Channel So we cast Anchor and hoisted out our Boat with Two Men and my self and made to Shore where we found my Three Companions but in a miserable Condition and Mr  Musgrave  so faint and weak that they expected he could not live long  When they awak'd the next Day after I was drove off in the Dark they were all in Despair to find the Vessel gone which they perceiv'd was occasion'd by a Hurricane that they were assur'd was violent because it had blown down their Tent tho' without awaking 'em But when they began to consider they had no Food nor but very little fresh Water which was left in a Barrel without a Head in the Tent their Despair increas'd but as no Passion can last long  that's violent it wore off with their Care for Sustenance which they diligently search'd for but not finding any Quantity of Eggs or Boobies the dreadful Fear of Starving came into their Minds with all its horrid Attendance Now they imagin'd that all that happen'd to 'em was as I had thought a Judgment of Divine Providence for the vile Sin of Drunkenness when they should have rather implor'd Heav'n's Assistance in furthering 'em in their Delivery from the Place where they were  They had been now Five Days without Eating or Drinking not for Want of Stomachs but Food which they endeavour'd to get but all to no Purpose for the Boobies were retir'd either out of Fear or Custom to some other Place▪ Neither could they find one Egg more and Weakness came so fast upon 'em with Hunger and Drought that they were hardly able to crawl so they thought of nothing but dying when at last they remember'd the Body of good Mr  Randal  that had been buried a Week which they dug up without being  putrify'd and that poor Wretch that help'd to support our Misfortunes when alive with his sage Advice now was a Means of preserving their Lives tho dead They had by good Fortune left 'em a TinderBox in the Tent we having two with which they struck a Light and made a Fire then cut off several pieces of Flesh of the Brawn of his Arms and Thighs broil'd 'em on the Coals tho' with a great deal of Reluctance which was the Means of keeping Life and Soul together till we came to relieve 'em from that deplorable Condition Mr  Musgrave  we brought to a little Life and Strength by giving him some CitronWater in small Quantities When I saw the Carcass of my poor good Monitor lie for Food for Humane Creatures my Horror at the Sight overcame my Reason and I believe I said Things shocking enough however when I had calmly considered their Condition I was very sorry for what I had said and beg'd their Pardon After we had refreshed our selves we once more laid him in the Earth having sew'd his poor Bones in one of the Hammocks  I must confess I never think of that good Man but Tears come into my Eyes and Melancholy clouds all my Thoughts For he was one whose Character came up to all we cou'd desire in frail Men Honest without Interest Friendly without Design Religious attended with Reason and not swadled up so tite as to make it deform'd Pleasant in Conversation Courteous to All Hating nothing but Vice Gentle in Reproving Bold in All Dangers in being arm'd with an Innocence that inspir'd him with Success in short he was a Miracle of a Man when we consider his Life had been always at Sea among a Crew prone to all manner of Vices and where it was not possible to find a Pattern to follow of any Goodness  He was a single Man or rather indeed a Batchelor for he had often told me he cou'd not bear to Marry a Woman to put her into Frights and Fears when the Wind blew hard as every good Wife must certainly be concern'd for the Danger of her Husband Besides as it was his Fortune to lead a Seafaring Life he cou'd  not think of Marrying to be absent from his other self so long as he term'd it not but if he had had a sufficient Competency he said he believ'd he shou'd have enter'd into the Marriage State in the latter Part of Life that he might have settl'd his Mind and free from the Hazard and Turmoils of the Sea slip'd into his Shrowd with Content among his Friends and Acquaintance at Home  He was an excellent Sailor and knew most Parts of the World perfectly well understood  French  and  Spanish  and seem'd to have a pretty good Knowledge in the  Latin  Tongue His Journals were mostly taken in ShortHand But he had one small Manuscript containing about Twenty Leaves  Spanish  on one Side and  English  on the other all in his own Hand which I suppose he had Translated for his Diversion or to pass away his Leisure Hours It was a Treatise of Herbs and Flowers with other Rarities to be found in the  WestIndies  Which being but short I shall give my Readers at the latter End of this Piece On the Flat of his Book he had  writ in a large Hand these Words  This Manuscript in  Spanish  I have Transcrib'd from the Original of the Reverend Father  Pedero di Riberia  of the Order of  Jesus  when I was Pilot in  Mexico  The Translation I have made at my Leisure Hours and the Cures by the Simples c mention'd in the said Book I have been an EyeWitness to many of and some were practis'd on my self  But more of this hereafter  We now were got on Board once again in order to sail as soon as the Wind would rise it being stark Calm and continu'd so two Days but at last it blew a little and we weigh'd Anchor and stood out to Sea but made but little Way I now was Master or Captain of a Ship and began to take upon me we were in all Nine Men all  English  that is My self first  Richard White W Musgrave  and  Ralph Middleton  my old Companions  John Stone W Keater Francis Hood W Warren  and  Joseph Meadows  All of  England  the Five Men given me by Don  Antonio  who as I said before were taken on Suspicion  of Pyracy Whereupon a Thought came into my Head that had escap'd me before I consider'd if these were really Pyrates being Five to Four they might be too powerful for us and perhaps murder us  Franc Hood  we had made our Cook to dress our Provision which he understood a little One Day we All Din'd together upon Deck under our Awning it being very calm Weather an  Awning  is only a Sail fix'd at the QuarterDeck and carry'd over the  Booms  that is spare Masts that lie along from Quarter to Forecastle to the Forecastle to keep the Sun from our Heads in Men of War and great Ships they have one made of several Kinds of handsome Stuff for the Officers on the QuarterDeck besides another on the Main Deck for the Common Sailors One Day as I said before being at Dinner for we All eat together I ask'd the five Men what was the Reason they were taken by the  Spaniards  for Pyrates Upon this they seem'd nonplus'd but  Warren  soon recover'd himself as well as the rest and spake for the others in this Manner We  embark'd on Board the Ship  Bonaventure  in the  Thames  bound for  Jamaica  where we made a prosperous Voyage but after taking in our Lading in our Way Home we were overtaken by a Storm in which our Ship was lost and all the Men perish'd but my self and Four Companions who were sav'd in the LongBoat But the Reason we were taken for Pyrates was that making to Shore to save our selves we saw a Bark riding at Anchor without the Port of  Campeche  which we made to in order to enquire whereabouts we were and to beg some Provisions our own being gone and entring the Vessel found but two People in't the third jumping into the Water swam on Shore and brought three Boats fill'd with  Spanish  Soldiers which enter'd the Vessel before we could make off Make off said I what did you design to run away with the Vessel No answer'd  Warren  with some Confusion but we did design to weigh Anchor and go farther in Shore that we might land in the Morning it being late at Night but we were prevented by their coming on  Board us where we were found being arm'd which we had taken Care of when we went into our Boat to defend ourselves if we were obliged to land among the  Savages  And indeed they had their Arms restor'd 'em when they were freed and sent on Board with me  I must confess I did not like the Fellow's being nonplus'd now and then in not knowing what to say but upon Consideration thought it might be for Want of Words to express himself better which is the Occasion very often of People of common Understanding Stammering and Humming and Hawing to put their Words in better Order so for that Time I took no more Notice not weighing it in my Mind But in the Evening Mr  Middleton  came to me with a Face of Concern and told me he did not like these Fellows Tale Why so says I Because I observe they herd together answer'd he and are always whispering and speaking low to one another Oh says I there cannot be any Danger in 'em for if they had any Inclination to run away with our Vessel they might  have done it when they were five to one before we took you in I know not reply'd  Middleton  I have a Heart forebodes something Pshaw old Womens Fears said I for as I said before they wou'd have don't when they had more Power before I landed on  Despair Island  as I call'd it if they had any such Intentions There is a Providence that rules o'er all our Actions answer'd  Middleton  that we can no more see into than the Book of Fate but if a foreboding Heart may speak I am sure something we shall suffer from these Fellows that will be of Danger to us If so reply'd I there's no resisting the Will of Providence for what will come will come and there's no Fending against it But added he this seems something like Fore▪knowledge and to resist against that seems like struggling against the Will of Heav'n that warns us by these Forebodings to prevent these Accidents of Life I believe God pursu'd he has fix'd a Period to our Breath but Accidents that happen in this Pilgrimage of Life may be avoided by a timely Notice As we are  all Partakers of free Will and from that form our own Happiness or Misery it cannot be said but that the Actions of Life may be regulated by that free Will Our Maker never form'd a Villain neither does their external Parts differ from a virtuous Man's if they did they were to be easily avoided But as an old Poet says  There's no Art to find the Mind's Construction in the Face  Upon this Discourse I began to stagger in my Opinion of their Honesty and therefore we resolv'd to stand upon our Guard We took no Notice of our Conference then to our two other Companions but resolv'd to stay till Night we having a better Opportunity being we lay together in the Cabbin Aft which is as much as to say in the Stern or behind when we were to go to Supper we call'd one another to come but five of the Sailors excus'd themselves by saying they had Din'd so lately that they had no Stomach as yet whereupon we had an Opportunity sooner to converse together than we design'd For being at Supper we open'd the Matter  to our other two Companions and they agreed immediately that we were in some Danger so we resolv'd in the middle Watch of the Night to seize 'em in their Sleep We were to have the first Watch which we set at Eight of the Clock then they were to Watch till Twelve and then in their third Watch between One and Two we had concluded to seize upon 'em as they slept that is Four of 'em for One of them watch'd with us which was  Franck Hood  the Cook whom we agreed to seize and bind fast towards the latter End of the Watch and to threaten him with Death if he offer'd to make the least Noise  As soon as ever our first Watch was set we sent Mr  Musgrave  to prepare our Arms in about a Half an Hour or thereabouts  Warren  call'd to  Hood  upon Deck they lying below to get him a little Water for he was bloody dry he said Whereupon the other went down immediately with some Water in a Can to him As soon as he was gone down I had the Curiosity to draw as near the Scuttle as I could to hear the Discourse  Now you must know  Hood  our Cook had been employ'd that Day about searching our Provisions our Beef Casks and Pork to see what Quantity we had that we might know how long it would last so that the others had not an Opportunity to disclose the Design to him As soon as he was got down I cou'd hear  Will Warren  say to him Gd Dn ye  Franck  we had like to have been smoak'd to Day and tho' we had contriv'd the Story that I told 'em yet I was a little surpriz'd at their asking me because then I did not expect it but we design to be even with 'em in a very little Time For hark ye says he and spake so low that I cou'd not hear him upon which the other said there's no Difficulty in the Matter but we need not be in such Haste for you know as we ply it to Windward a Day or two can break no Squares and we can soon after the Effecting our Design bear down to Leeward to our Comrades that we left on Shore for I fancy added he that they have some small Suspicion of you now which in Time will sleep  and may be on their Guard therefore 'tis better to wait a Day or two No Gd Zds we'll do it too Night when they are asleep reply'd  Warren  whereupon there were many Arguments  Pro  and  Con  as I fancy'd but they spoke so low that I cou'd only hear a Gd Dn ye now and then and something of that Kind  A little while after  Hood  came up again and after walking up and down and fixing his Eyes often upon me who in the mean Time was provided with a Couple of Pistols under my WatchCoat and indeed were their own that we hung up ready charg'd in our Cabbin which was one Reason of their Design to seize on us in our Sleep being they had no Arms till they cou'd seize on 'em where they hung or else they were such desperate Fellows they wou'd have don't in the open Day  Hood  as I said before seem'd to fix his Eyes frequently upon me for till now I never watch'd in the Night at last said he very softly if you please Mr  Falconer  I have a Word or two to say to you that much concerns  you All What is it says I Why answer'd He I wou'd have the rest of your Companions Ear Witnesses too with that I call'd 'em together but says he let's retire as far from the Scuttle as we can that we may not be heard by any below Deck so we went into the Cabbin and open'd the Scuttle above that Mr  Musgrave  who steer'd might hear what was said When we were sat down upon the Floor Mr  Hood  began as follows My four Companions below have a wicked Design upon you that is to seize you and put you into the Boat and run away with your Vessel But I thinking it an inhuman Action not only to any one but to you in particular that have been the Means of their Freedom therefore I hope appointed by Providence I come to let you know it that we may think of some Means to prevent it Upon this finding his Sincerity I told him that we were provided against it already and with the Consent of my Companions told him our Design of seizing 'em in the third Watch but says he they intend to put their  Project in Practice their next Watch therefore I think 'twill be more proper for us to Counterplot 'em and seize 'em this but as they have no Arms says I and we have we need not fear 'em  We had several Debates about this which took up too much Time to our Sorrow For  Warren  mistrusting  Hood  it seems got up and listen'd and when he found that we retir'd all of us to the Cabbin he got upon Deck and stealing softly came so close that he overheard every thing we said which as soon as he understood he went immediately to his Companions who waited impatiently as they told us afterwards and let 'em know all our Discourse whereupon without pausing they resolv'd to seize us immediately in the Midst of our Consultation which was no sooner resolv'd upon but done For we were immediately surpriz'd with their seizing us which they did with that Quickness and so unperceivably that we were all confounded and amaz'd they had whip'd off two Pistols in our Consternation which they clap'd to our Breasts In this Confusion  I had forgot mine that were at my Girdle or else we might have been hard enough for 'em neither did I remember 'em till they found 'em about me They had shut the Cabbin Door on the Inside till they had bound us and never minded Mr  Musgrave  knocking and making a Noise till they had secur'd us Which done they open'd the Door and seiz'd him who came to know what the Matter was for we had no Candle in the Cabbin and he hearing a Noise amongst us thought we were seizing  Hood  and call'd to us to forbear as he said afterwards and make Haste for he was going to tack about tho' we did not hear him on which he clap'd the Helm a Lee and came down to fetch us out to haul off the Sheets c and was seiz'd and bound with us for they left us immediately being the Sails flutter'd in the Wind by Reason she was veering round when the Helm was a Lee  After they had fix'd the Vessel and it was broad Day they came and unbound our Legs and gave us Leave to walk upon Deck whereupon I began to expostulate  with 'em particularly Mr  Warren  being he seem'd to have a sort of Command over the others Pray says I to him for what Reason have you seiz'd upon us and bound us in this Manner Have we done you any Injury Why says he Selfpreservation I found you were a going to do the like by us therefore you are but serv'd in your Kind And what do you design to do with us now you have your Desire Do with you why by and by we design to put you in the Boat and turn you adrift but for that Son of a Bh  Hood  we'll murder him without Mercy a Dog to betray us How betray you reply'd I Yes for I overheard All then related the Manner of it as mention'd above But as you have not so much injur'd us we'll put you immediately in the Boat with a Week's Provisions and a small Sail and you shall seek your Fortune as I suppose you wou'd have done by us No answer'd I we only design'd to confine you till we came to  Jamaica  and there to have given you your Liberty to go where you had thought fit Ay ay  says  Warren  shaking his Head this is easily said nor are we bound to believe you Why 'tis plain said I that our consulting to seize you was but to prevent what has happen'd We are not to enquire into the Matter answer'd  Warren  and now we have you in our Power we'll do as we think fit Why then▪ says I put us ashore at any Land that belongs to the  English  and we shall think you have not done us any Injury No says he we must go to meet our Captain and Fifty Men upon the Main Land of  Jucatan  where our Vessel was stranded not to be gotten off Our first Design when we were taken in our Boat was to get us a Vessel to go a  Buccaneering  which we had done at  Campeche  if it had not been for the  Indian  that swam a Shore unknown to us and brought Succours too soon which we cou'd not avoid the Sea Breeze blowing very strong all Night so we seeing our Danger were forc'd to form the Lie we told the Governour which had some Appearance of Truth for we did not use any Violence to the two old  Spaniards  being by  good Words we thought to make 'em assisting to work our Bark back again to our Men Now pursu'd he if you will all resolve to go a  Buccaneering  with us we'll venture to carry you to our Captain and Men if not we'll do as we have propos'd We looking one upon another as if it were to know each other's Resolutions he cry'd nay if you pause you shan't have that Grace if you desire it Therefore prepare every Thing pursu'd he to one of his Companions that they may be going they won't be long before they come to their Journey's End  When they had got every Thing ready that is to say a Barrel of Bisket another of Water about half a Dozen Pieces of Beef and as much Pork a small Kettle and a TinderBox we were better provided than we expected by much Besides they granted us Four Cutlasses and a FowlingPiece with about Four Pound of Powder and a sufficient Quantity of Shot together with all poor Mr  Randal  's Journals after their perusing 'em and finding 'em of no Use to them  When this was done he order'd 'em to tie  Hood  to the Mast of the Vessel and was charging a Pistol to shoot him thro▪ the Head not considering it was charg'd before for it was one of them I had at my Girdle and which they took from me but in his Eagerness and Heat of Passion did not mind it We all intreated for the poor Fellow and he himself fell upon his Knees and beg'd with all the Eloquence he had to spare him and let him go with us but  Warren  swore bitterly nothing should save him Says I Mr  Warren  if you believe there is a Power that form'd this Globe and sees every Action of Mankind think what a Crime you commit by wounding of him by murdering his Image But if you're an Atheist and believe in no Power Supernatural yet consider what a Conquest you will have gain'd over your self by overcoming this headstrong Passion It may be your own Case another Time and Murder you know is punish'd with Death What the Devil have we got here a preaching Puppy Why dost think that I mind thy ridiculous Cant  prithee mind thy own Business and get thee gone or perhaps I may begin with you and send you to the Devil before your Time With that he cock'd his Pistol and levell'd it at  Hood  but firing it split into several Pieces and one struck  Warren  into the Skull so deep that he was breathing his last upon Deck one of the Bullets graz'd upon the Side of my Temple and did but just break the Skin as for  Hood  he was not hurt but with the Fright and Noise of the Pistol as we suppos'd labour'd with such an Agony of Spirit that he broke the Cords that ty'd him by the Arms tho' as thick as a Middle Finger and fell down but rose immediately and not finding himself hurt ran to us and unbound our Arms not perceiv'd by the other two who were busy about unfortunate  Warren  and tho' they were call'd to by him that steer'd who ran immediately to prevent it yet they did not mind it they were so concern'd about  Warren  And before he that steer'd came  Hood  had unbound me and stop'd the Fellow  Meadows  by giving him a Blow with his  Fist that knock'd him down In the mean Time I had unbound  White Musgrave  and  Middleton  and we went and seiz'd upon the other two  Pyrates  for now we call'd 'em nothing else After we had bound 'em in our Turn we went to see what Assistance cou'd be given to  Warren  where we found that a Piece of the Barrel of the Pistol had sunk into his Skull and that he was just expiring but yet he sat upon his Breech with great Resolution says he I see you have overpower'd us and I likewise see the Hand of Heav'n is in it I now with Horror find added he that what you intimated to me about Heav'n to be true I see it more in this one Accident than in all the Preachings of the Fathers I was bred a  Roman  had good Honest Parents  Romans  whose Steps if I had follow'd wou'd have made my Conscience easy to me at this Time but I forsook all Religion in general and now too late I find that to dally with Heav'n is fooling ones self but yet in this one Moment of my Life that's left I heartily repent of all my past Crimes and  rely upon the Saviour of the World that dy'd for our Sins to pardon mine With that he cross'd himself and expir'd  I must confess I was very sorry for the unhappy Accident of his Death but yet glad that we were at Liberty and was something easy that the poor Soul repented before his Expiration not doubting but the piercing Eye of Providence saw that if he had surviv'd he would have liv'd a good Christian And sure the Almighty's infinite Stock of Bounty has enough Mercy to save the repenting Soul tho' late before his Repentance comes  After we had secur'd our  Tartars  we threw Mr  Warren  Overboard and bore up to the Wind for after our first tacking about in the Morning when the Bustle happen'd they bore away with Tack at Cathead as being for their Purpose The three Men that were left desir'd us to let 'em have the Boat and go seek their Companions which we refus'd as not having Hands enough to carry our Vessel to  Jamaica  But we promis'd 'em if they wou'd freely work in the Voyage  they shou'd have their intire Liberty to go where they thought fit without any Complaints against them Upon this we began to be a little sociable as before and they all declar'd that what they did was by the Instigation of  Warren  The next Day we discover'd a Ship to Windward of us that bore down upon us with crowded Sails We fill'd all the Sails we had and endeavour'd to get away from her as fast as we cou'd but all to no Purpose we saw they gain'd upon us every Moment and therefore seeing it was not possible for us to escape we back'd our Sails and laid by for 'em that they might be more civil if they were Enemies As soon as ever they came up with us they hail'd us and order'd us to come on Board which we durst not deny when Mr  Musgrave  and I with  Hood  and  White  for Rowers went on Board 'em We found by  Hood  's knowing 'em that they were his Captain and Comrades Now as  Hood  said we did not know how we shou'd behave our selves or what we shou'd say about  Warren  but we only told the Captain  how we met with his Men and that they were redeem'd upon my Account He never ask'd particularly for  Warren  but how they All did but when they sent on Board to search our Vessel they soon came to the Truth on't for the other three told 'em the Story tho' not with aggravating Circumstances Upon which poor  Hood  was ty'd to their Mainmast lash'd with a Cat of NineTails most abominably and after that pickled in Brine which was more Pain than the Whipping but it kept his Back from festering which it might otherwise have done because they flea the Skin off at every Stroke and to prevent it they wash it with Brine which is call'd  Whipping  and  Pickeling  After this they wou'd not keep him among 'em but sent for the other three Men from our Vessel and order'd us all on Board with another of their Men that was ill of a dangerous Fever which they fear'd might prove infectious They did not take any Thing from us as we expected at first only gave us this sick Man to look after which we were very well contented with  So we parted with 'em very well satisfy'd but much better when we were out of Sight fearing they had forgot themselves and wou'd send for us back and take our Provision from us or one Mischief or another for Pyrates do not often use to be so courteous  Our sick Man mended apace for we took great Care of him and by keeping him low only with WaterGruel his Fever left him when I began to keep up his Spirits with my Cordials that I had by me and in a Week's Time he was pretty hoddy as we call it at Sea Now we began to converse with him and he seem'd to be a sensible goodhumour'd Fellow  Among other Discourse we ask'd him how Captain  Mll  and his Crew got a Ship Says he I can only tell the Story as I heard it for I was sick on Shore which is as follows  Sixteen of our Men got a  Paragua  from the  Indians  who hate the  Spaniards  tho' under their Subjection and love the  French  and  English  very well these set out to seize upon the first Ship  that they thought they cou'd compass when after being five Days Cruising along Shore they spy'd a large Ship weathering  Cape Catoch  but believing it to be too strong for 'em they resolv'd to work by Stratagem thus Twelve Men laid down in the Boat as if very faint and weak and made a Signal to the Ship as if in Distress who very charitably brought too now they had no Arms with 'em for when they resolv'd to use this Stratagem they left 'em aShore as making the Pretence more feasible so that when they arriv'd at the Ship they all went feebly up as if not able to stand nay some were oblig'd to be led forsooth to colour the Matter the better They then told 'em that their Ship was cast away upon  Logerhead  's  Key  about three Leagues from  Cape Catoch  and saving themselves in their Boats they got safe into the  Cape  but that wandering up in the Country they were met by the  Indians  who us'd 'em barbarously killing Eleven of their Number and wou'd have serv'd the rest so if they had not made their Escape  in that  Paragua  that they were so harrass'd for want of Food having been without eating two Days that they fear'd some of their Companions wou'd never recover  The poor  Spaniards  swallow'd the Bait and their Captain being a very good Man resolv'd to relieve 'em and ask'd 'em what they wou'd have him to do for 'em They beg'd him to land 'em on the first  English  Colony or Island in their Way He answer'd he was bound for St  Domingo  in  Hispaniola  but that he wou'd put in at  Jamaica  tho' something out of his Way yet says he I don't care for going to any of the noted Ports because there is a War talk'd of between  England  and  Spain  and tho' it was not proclaim'd they might meet with some Trouble They were mightily oblig'd to him they said but they did not know how to return the Obligation but by praying for him and his  They sail'd very lovingly with 'em for three or four Days till at last Fortune gave them an Opportunity to put their Enterprize in Execution They  had Notice that the Ship leak'd mightily and that the Water came into the BreadRoom upon which the  Spaniards  went down to remove the Bread to get at the Leak and did not leave more than five Men and the Captain above whom they instantly seiz'd and clap'd down the Hatches upon the rest When they had secur'd them they arm'd themselves with Pistols and Launces which were plac'd in the Steerage of the Ship and so capitulated with 'em but first they steer'd their Course back again that they might not lose any Time As they came up one by one they bound them till they were all so but the Captain and the Pilot The Captain they confin'd to his Cabbin with a Centry to guard him but they let the Pilot go loose that he might steer the Ship O inhuman cry'd I thus the Snake in the friendly Bosom warm'd turns and stings his kind Protector Thus was their generous  Host  if I may call him so betray'd by his too much good Nature  After they had brought the Ship safe to us we embark'd and put the  Spaniards  on Shore without a Morsel to help themselves nay if the  Indians  cou'd conveniently meet with 'em they wou'd not leave one alive I must confess pursu'd the Man that the barbarous Story shock'd my very Nature and made me hate their Society and I really believe the Abhorrence of this curs'd Action brought my Distemper upon me  How much are some Beasts Acknowledgments of Kindness more than Man A poor Cur fed but with a Crust a Day will follow still the bounteous Hand that gives it Ingratitude is the Fountain of all other Crimes for from thence flow all the rest But all the Knowledge some Men are endow'd with is but to find the best Way to deceive How happy it would be if such Creatures cou'd shake off their Humanity and become Beasts in Form as well as Mind then we shou'd have a Mark to shun 'em by Our Creator has form'd all Kind of Beasts in Shapes that tell us what they are But Men differ in their Natures more than Beasts or are indeed under their Human Form the very Natures of the Brute  Creation How many Villains under a smooth Face and Tongue betray their Brothers The Father cheats the Son the Son the Father Mothers squander the Dowry of their Daughters and then prostitute 'em to gain 'em Bread which is not Gain but Punishment But Ingratitude like Murder meets with its Punishment on Earth as well as in the other World and an ungrateful Man shou'd have a Mark that all Human Society may shun him I think the  Lacedemonians  us'd to punish Ingratitude with Death as a Crime equal to Sacriledge or Parricide  After having taken all their Men on Board and leaving Directions on a Bark of a Tree for the five Men that were gone upon the same Design another Way we set sail and had not been out two Days before we met with you Pray says I how came you among 'em if you lik'd not their Design Why Sir answer'd he by Accident Embarking from  Bermudas  bound for St  Catherines  or the Isle of  Providence  we were met by this Pyrate in a Ship of  twenty Guns and a hundred and twenty Men who took us and rumaging us threaten'd to turn us adrift without Provision if we wou'd not embrace his Designs which was Pyracy We rather than undergo what he threaten'd us withal consented with our Tongues but our Inclinations were far from it And from our first being with him we were ploting to make our Escape the next Opportunity But the other four being but five in all in our Vessel were unfortunately kill'd in that Engagement where they lost their Ship What Ship was it they fought with Why Sir a Man of War of twenty six Guns sent out on Purpose to take her for the Captain had committed such Disorders whereever he came that he oblig'd the Governour of  Jamaica  to send out the Ship call'd the  Experiment  to cruise till she met with him which she did about five Weeks ago Our Captain as soon as he saw her guess'd at her Design and resolv'd to fight her to the last well knowing if he could take or sink her he might be pretty secure to range where he pleas'd  there being never another Ship of War nearer than  Barbadoes  who never came so far West After he had made a Speech to his Men to encourage them to fight it out and told 'em their Advantage they consented to hoist the Bloody Flag and neither to give or take Quarter As soon as ever the Man of War saw our Bloody Flag out they hoisted theirs and there ensu'd a dreadful Fight We began about two aClock and fought till dark Night without perceiving any Advantage on either Side and then by Consent lay by till Morning without fighting which we did so nigh it being calm that we cou'd talk to one another but we did it only in threatning Language As soon as the Morning dawn'd we went to it agen with more Fury than before for our People fought like desperate Madmen well knowing if they shou'd be taken they must all die The other Ship fought with a Bravery uncommon but I believe the Advantage was on our Side tho' we had kill'd on Board us thirty six Men  We fought on till Noon when we discover'd a Ship about three Leagues to Windward of us which bore down upon us with all the Sail they cou'd We soon conjectur'd they cou'd be no Friends to us so without much Consultation we resolv'd to run it before the Wind with all the Sail we cou'd make as for the  Experiment  we fought with we had put it out of their Power to follow us being we had shot their MainMast by the Board so that if the other overtook us we shou'd have but one to deal with We by good Fortune had all our Masts firm and we outsail'd the other Vessel but as soon as she came up with the  Experiment  who never offer'd to follow us she laid by as we suppose to assist her and we observ'd thro' our Telescopes that she had  Spanish  Colours out  We soon lost Sight of 'em and then we design'd to change our Course but were prevented by the Men discovering two Foot Water in the Hold who cou'd not find out the Leak tho' they search'd with all the Dilligence they cou'd So we were oblig'd to Pump but all that  we cou'd do the Water still gain'd upon us we resolv'd to bear away to  Jucatan  a Province belonging to the  Spaniards  and seek out some convenient Place unfrequented by them where we might find out our Leak and stop it  Notwithstanding our Labour in Pumping the Water gain'd upon us so we put out our LongBoat and our Pinnace in order to put in our Provision which by Morning we effected and very happily for us for it was agreed upon all Hands the Ship cou'd not swim above Eight Hours and tho' we discover'd Land and were not above six Leagues off Shore yet we were afraid we cou'd not reach it being the Ship was so heavy with Water So all that cou'd not swim were order'd into the two Boats with their Arms which held in 'em thirty seven Men with Officers They that were left on Board had Orders to Pump as long as they cou'd and run directly into Shore to the Leeward of  Cape Catoch  but within half a League off the Place the Ship sunk and the Men betook  themselves to swiming which we met with our Pinnace and took up  I cannot omit one barbarous Action of the Captain's There was five Men wounded who beg'd to be taken into the Boat but the Captain refus'd 'em and this was his Reason as he gave to us in the Boat Says he those five that are wounded will take up too much Room being they can't sit as we do but must lie along and another Thing is they will take more Time in looking after than we can well spare Besides as I believe they won't recover they will be the sooner out of their Pain and if they shou'd recover added he they wou'd help us to devour our Provision which we must take particular Care of for we know not when we shall get more I must confess this Usage struck me to the Heart almost especially as to one of 'em who seem'd to have a Sense of his Condition and repented of all his past Crimes  After we were on Shore we found that we had kill'd on Board us forty three Men besides the five that our Captain barbarously  murder'd by leaving 'em in the Ship when she sunk Two of their Bodies were drove on Shore the next Day but were order'd by the Captain to have Stones ty'd to their Feet and carry'd off Shore and sunk As soon as we had made us two Tents with Sails that were put in the Boat for that Purpose they began to consult in what Manner they shou'd get a Ship when one  Warren  propos'd to take the Boat and four Men beside himself with Arms and a Week's Provision for he wou'd not have any more and go to the Bay of  Campeache  or  Campeche  Town where he did not fear getting a Vessel for their Purpose being he said he had done so upon the like Occasion before Whereupon the Boat and four Men were order'd for him but he staying longer than the appointed Time they thought some Mischance had happen'd to him so took off their Thoughts of having any Vessel from him One Day they spy'd a large  Paragua  coming towards Shore with Nine  Indians  and two  Spaniards  in't and finding it come so near that they  must of Course see 'em they immediately resolv'd either to take or kill 'em all for fear they shou'd discover 'em to the  Spaniards  before they had got a Vessel to go off again  Tho' I must confess there was some Reason yet I thought it barbarous to see how they murder'd the two  Spaniards  and nine  Indians  They put out their Pinnace and ten Men well arm'd to go and take this  Paragua  as soon as ever they were discover'd by the  Indians  they jump'd Overboard and made towards Shore but were shot by our Men or knock'd on the Head with the ButtEnd of their Musquets The two  Spaniards  had a new Kind of Death they ty'd 'em Breast to Breast and their Hands behind 'em and threw 'em Overboard where they struggl'd for some Time and at last were drown'd I thought this was a Cruelty exceeding all the Tyrants in the World and if I had had a Boat and our People never a one I wou'd have run any Hazard to have sav'd 'em Their  Paragua  was laden with Flower and dry'd Fish with several Sides of dry'd  Pork or Bacon which was too good for the People that had it As for my own Part but little of it came to my Share for I was taken ill the second Day after we came there and so weak and feeble that I did not expect to overcome it and if it had not been for a Black that was Trumpeter to the Captain I shou'd have perish'd for want of Sustenance but the poor Fellow frequently wou'd bring me something or other to nourish me and it is to him under God that I owe my Life He wou'd often tell me that he did not love that sort of Life and wish'd he cou'd get rid of his Master but says he if he did but know I had as much as a Thought that Way he wou'd be the Death of me I believe this was the only poor Fellow that pray'd in the whole Crew He was christen'd at  Plymouth  in  England  and had very good Notions of Religion where he was given to his present Master who had made several Voyages into the  WestIndies  for a  Plymouth  Merchant but at last finding Matters on Shore go but indifferently and having kill'd a  French  Officer  there seiz'd upon the Ship he us'd to Command and with a Crew of desperate Fellows made off to Sea and steer'd his old Course for the  WestIndies  and there commenc'd Pyrate but had met with no other Success than what has been related to you  Says I this Fellow's too wicked to have Success in any Thing especially when Success must be an Addition to his Crimes If it were possible to know his Fate we shou'd find that he wou'd have some desperate End For Men when abandon'd by Providence Divine tho' perhaps they may meet with some Success at first at last find an End that's fitted for such Wretches who deny a Superior Being and even Atheists notwithstanding their Human Form are no better than Brutes nay I take an  Atheist  or  Deist  to have far less Right to Salvation than those  Indians  that pray to the Devil for they do it thro' Ignorance and Worship him with a more sincere Devotion because they know 'tis in his Power to do 'em Harm With what a fervent Zeal wou'd they  serve the true God if they knew as all who profess Christianity do that it is in his Power to bestow Blessings even after this Life With what Devotion they Worship the Sun who they take to be the Superior Deity because it makes the Earth green and is the second Cause of all the Good they enjoy Then with how much more Reverence ought we to give Praise to that Power that lends Light and general Heat to that Planet If an Atheist wou'd consider the Works of Nature justly he would find it an Impossibility to be so any longer and to fancy this World was form'd by Chance or Accident is to allow Beasts the Privileges of Nature and Reason to as great a Degree as we that pretend to Humanity  John Rouse  was the Name of this Sailor we took on Board born at  Bermudas  He offer'd us some Proposals if we wou'd go along with him thither but I declin'd it as wanting to be with my old Ship's Crew and thought of seeing my own Country again as I believe all Travellers have who bring nothing  Home but Misfortunes or the Vices of the Places they have travel'd thro' From this Man said  Rouse  I had the following short Description of  Bermudas  or the  Summer Islands  Bermudas  the Place of my Birth or the  Summer Islands  is suppos'd by some to take its Name of  Bermudas  from certain Black Hogs that came out of a  Spanish  Ship that was cast away on those Shores And by others from one  John Bermudas  a  Spaniard  the first Discoverer of the Islands The Name  Summer Islands  is deriv'd from  George Summers  an  English  Man who suffer'd Shipwreck there They are situated in thirty two Degrees and twenty five Minutes of Northern Latitude Sixteen Hundred Leagues from  England  Twelve Hundred from  Madera  Four Hundred from  Hispaniola  and about Three Hundred from  Boston  in  New England  The  Spaniards  had it first and after them the  French  but the Supplies that were sent 'em from  France  miscarrying by Shipwreck they were oblig'd to abandon the Islands After this one  Wing field  a  Merchant in  London  sent in two Ships Captain  Gosnel  and  Smith  with People to settle there but there was not much done till when a Company was Establish'd at  London  by Letters Patents given by King  James  the first who immediately sent Captain  Moor  with sixty five Men where he was two Years in fortifying the Islands against the Attempts of any Invasion from either  French Spaniards  or  Indians  In the mean Time a sort of Rats so increas'd that they devour'd every Thing that was Green in the whole Island and had like to have starv'd the Inhabitants if Providence had not timely sent a Disease among 'em that consum'd 'em All In about three Years after the first Plantation by Captain  Moor  there was sent 'em another Supply of Men and Provision by Captain  Bartlet  who return'd with a Hundred Weight of Ambergreese The next Year there arriv'd five hundred Men and Women with Tradesmen of all Sorts In one  Tuckard  succeeded in the Government and was very serviceable to the Plantation in bringing and planting  several Trees and Tobacco He also divided the Country into Acres and parcell'd it out to the Tenants It encreas'd daily in Culture and Inhabitants The Form of the Islands as they lie resembles something of a Lobster with its Claws off The Chief of the Islands is call'd  George Island  and is divided into Eight Parts besides the General Land  Hamilton Tribe    Smith  's  Tribe    Devonshire Tribe    Pembroke Tribe    Paget  's  Tribe    Warwick Tribe    Southampton Tribe    Sandy  's  Tribe  The Islands are all surrounded by Rocks that at HighWater are dangerous to Strangers The Chief Harbours are  Southampton Harrinton  and the  Great Sound  Upon St  George  's  Island  they have built several large and strong Forts whose Chief are  Warwick  and  Dover  Forts The Soil in some Places is Sandy or Claye and in other Places Ashcolour'd White and Black about two Foot deep under the Ash is found great Slates which the Inhabitants make use of several Ways and under that Black is found a Stony Substance▪  something like a Spunge or PummiceStone The Wells and Pits Ebb and Flow with the Sea yet produce excellent fresh Water The Sky is generally serene but when 'tis o'ercast they have dreadful Thunder and Lightning The Air is much the same as with you in  England  They have two Harvests in the Year They Sow in  March  and Reap in  June  then they Sow in  August  and Gather in  January  And from that Month till  May  the Whales frequently swim by them They often find great Quantities of Ambergreece and sometimes Pearl Oysters No venomous Creature▪ will live in any of the said Islands The yellow large Spiders have not the least Venom in 'em There's Plenty of all Sorts of Cattle both Wild and Tame especially Hogs who have mightily encreas'd since their first Landing but they are not altogether so fat as we could wish feeding only on Berries that fall from the PalmetoTrees which are very sweet There's Plenty of Mulberies both White and Red which produce prodigious Numbers of SilkWorms who spin Silk  of the Colour of the Berry The Trees are here of different Kinds the Cedar is reckon'd the Largest in the Universe The Leaves are downy and prickly at the End The Berries that it produceth are of a pale Red which inclose four White Kernels the Outermost Skin is sweet the Innermost that contains the Kernel is sharp and the Pulp is tartish The Tree is always flourishing being at the same Time full of Blossoms green and ripe Fruit The Berries when ripe begin to gape and fall off in Rainy Weather leaving a round Stalk on the Boughs which loses not its Rind till that Time two Years after The Berry requires one Year before it comes to its full Ripeness which happens about  December  The Boughs shoot upwards and in a little Time are so heavy that they weigh down the Body of the Tree There are many Plants as the Prickle Pear Poyson Weed Red Weed Purging Bean Red Pepper and the Costive Tree and the Sea Feather which grows on the Brink of the Sea There is another Plant call'd  Nuchtly  which grows in  the Niches of the Rocks wash'd by the Waves of the Sea and produces a Fruit like a Pear which they call the  Speckl'd Pear  from its Spots For Fowls we have all Sorts that  England  produces besides a great Number of Cranes larger than any I have seen elsewhere with a sort of Fowl that lives in Holes in the Rocks like Rabbets As for Tortoises they are as good there as any where▪ They catch them in this Manner they watch for 'em at Night when they come on Shore to dig Holes to bury their Eggs in while they are doing of it they turn 'em on their Backs and not being able to get upon their Legs again they are easily taken Some will have a Hundred Eggs in 'em about as big as a common TennisBall and very round but a thin Skin and the Yolk lies on the Side of the Skin or Shell and may be seen on the Outside These hidden in the Sand are nourish'd by the Sun and never minded by the Tortoise that lays 'em and as soon as ever they have broke the Shell they all run into the Sea Some say they are full six Years a  Hatching They are excellent Meat for I can't call 'em Fish and very nourishing and we use the Oyl instead of Butter which will keep longer and is reckon'd much wholesomer for many Uses Besides it is good to bathe the Place that is stung by a little Insect call'd  Musketto  The Largest of these Islands is  Long Island  the next St  George  's  Island  after that  Somerset  and St  David  's next  Hibernia  or  Ireland Island  then  Longberd Cooper  's and  Smith  's  Island Nonsuch Gates  and the  Brothers Island  with many others as well inhabited and provided with every Thing for the Life of Man which is elegantly describ'd by your  English  Poet Mr  Edmund Waller  Bermudas  wall'd with Rocks who does not know  That happy Island where huge Lemons grow  And Orange Trees which golden Fruit do bear  Th'  Hesperian Garden  boasts of none so fair  Where shining Pearl Coral and many a Pound  On the rich Shore of Ambergreese is sound  The lofty Cedar which to Heav'n aspires  The Prince of Trees is Fewel for their Fires  The Smoak by which their loaded Spits do turn  For Incence might on Sacred Altars burn  Their private Roofs on Od'rous Timber born  Such as might Palaces for Kings adorn  The sweet Palmettos a new  Bacchus  yield  With Leaves as ample as the broadest Shield  Under the Shadow of whose friendly Boughs  They sit Carowzing where their Liquor grows  Figs there unplanted thro' the Fields do grow  Such as fierce  Cato  did the  Romans  show  With the rare Fruit inviting 'em to spoil▪  Carthage  the Mistress of so rare a Soil  The naked Rocks are not unfruitful there  But at some constant Seasons e'ery Year  Their Barren Tops with luscious Food abound  And with the Eggs of various Fowls are crown'd  Tobacco is the Worst of Things which they  To  English  Landlords as their Tribute pay  Such is the Mould that the Blest Tenant feeds  On precious Fruits and pays his Rent in Weeds  With candy'd  Plantanes  and the juicy Pine  On choicest  Melons  and sweet Grapes they dine  And with Potatoes fat their wanton Swine  Nature these Cates with such a lavish Hand  Pours out among 'em that our coarser Land  Tastes of their Bounty and does Cloth return  Which not for Warmth but Ornament

this Northern Tract our hoarser Throats  Utter unripe and illconstrained Notes  While the Supporter of the Poet's Stile  Phoebus  on them eternally does smile  O how I long my careless Limbs to lay  Under the Plantane's Shade  There is now in the Islands of  Bermudas  near Forty Thousand Inhabitants most  English  The Laws are the same as in  England  The Religion and Divine Worship the same There are Three and Twenty Parish Churches besides  Chappels In the Year five Seamen set sail from thence in an open Vessel of about Three Tun and after having suffer'd several Storms and Tempests were safely landed at  Kingsale  in  Ireland  The  French  and  Spaniards  have made several Attempts upon those Islands but always were drove away with considerable Loss  About a Month before I embark'd for this unfortunate Voyage we took a  French  Pyrate who was so insolent as to come into  Harrinton  's  Sound  even at NoonDay and cut the Cables of a Merchantman richly laden bound for  England  but by good Fortune run upon the Flats in the Mouth of the  Sound  in going out again So we had Time to Man some Boats with some of the Soldiers of the Garrison and send to their Relief where there happen'd a desperate Fight for some Time but more Forces going to the Assistance of the others they took 'em after an obstinate Resistance killing twenty seven of their Men and losing eleven of our own The Captain made his Escape in his Boat  in the latter End of the Engagement when he perceiv'd his Danger but was oblig'd to go on Shore on  Ireland Island  for some Provision where he and four Men that were with him were secur'd and sent to  Tucker  's  Town  where they were to be try'd the Day I came away  Two Nights after we had parted with the Pyrate we were encounter'd with a dreadful Storm that lasted two Days without abating and out poor Bark which was none of the best was tumbl'd and toss'd like a TennisBall yet we receiv'd no Damage but that she wou'd not answer the Helm so that we were oblig'd to let her go before the Tempest and trust to the Mercy of Heav'n for Relief This Storm and the Danger we had escap'd from the Pyrate put me in Mind of these four Lines of the foremention'd Poet the celebrated  Waller  Bold were the Men which on the Ocean first  Spread their new Sails when Shipwreck was the Worst  More Danger now from Man alone we find  Than from the Rocks the Billows or the Wind  We in the Middle of the Storm discover'd Land right a Head which put us all into our Pannicks we endeavour'd to bring our Vessel to bear up to the Wind but all to no Purpose for she still drove nearer the Shore where we discover'd several Tokens of a Shipwreck as Pieces of broken Masts and Barrels swiming on the Water and a little farther Mens Hats then we began to think we shou'd certainly run the same Fate when as soon as thought our Bark was drove on Shore in a smooth sandy Bay but where we had Opportunity to quit her which was happy for us for the Sea wash'd over her with such Violence we had not any Hopes of her escaping the Storm but thought of Course we shou'd be torn to Pieces  When we were aShore we all concluded it cou'd be no other Part but the South of  Cuba Island  belonging to the  Spaniards  We were then in a terrible Fright lest we were near any Part that belong'd to the  Indians  for Mr  Musgrave  assur'd me that there were some Parts of the South▪Side of  Cuba  that  Indians  dwelt in in Spite of the  Spaniards  and Massacre'd them whereever they met 'em or any other Whites We lay all Night in terrible Fear and tho' we found the Storm abated or rather a Calm succeeded yet we durst not stir till the Moon rose and then we all walk'd towards our Vessel which we found all on one Side but by good Fortune most of our Provisions was dry which mightily rejoyc'd us but all the Vessel's Riging and Masts were shatter'd and torn to Pieces and some Part of her Quarter wrung off that she cou'd not be of any Use to us if we cou'd have got her upright But we took out all our Provision and our Arms with two Barrels of GunPowder that was dry the rest being damag'd with Water and Sand that had got in We had Arms enough as having them that belong'd to the three Sailors that were taken in the Pyrate which we suppos'd they had forgot so we were six Men well arm'd with each a Musquet a Case of Pistols and a Bayonet beside two Cutlasses if Need were  By that Time we had taken every Thing out Day approach'd and then we design'd altogether well arm'd to go and view the Country  John Rouse  was very well recover'd of his Fever but a little weak yet his Heart was as good as the Best of us So we resolv'd if we were set upon by  Indians  to defend our selves to the last Drop of Blood chusing rather to die by their Hands in Fight than to be tortur'd after the Manner as they inflict upon all the  Whites  they get into their Hands But still we had some Hopes that we were too far towards the Northward for 'em  When we had plac'd our Provision and other Necessaries safe behind a Tuft of Trees that grew close by the Water Side we fix'd our Arms and ventur'd to walk up in the Country which we did almost every Way that Day four or five Miles but cou'd not discover any Living Creature nor any Sign of Inhabitants only in one Place the Grass seem'd to be lately troden but whether by Man or Beast we cou'd not discover so being pretty well tir'd we went back again to our  Station where we eat heartily and at Night we laid our selves upon the Grass and fell asleep for we durst not lie upon the Sails we had got for that Purpose being they were not dry tho' spread all Day long  I was awaken'd the next Morning by a Company of  Lizards  creeping over me which is an Animal frightful enough to look at but very Harmless and great Lovers of Mankind they say that these Creatures if a Person lies asleep and any voracious Beast or the  Alligator  which comes on Shore often is approaching the Place where you lie will crawl to you as fast as they can and with their forked Tongues tickle you till you awake that you may avoid by their timely Notice the coming Danger I got up being rowz'd by these Animals and look'd about me but saw nothing but an odd Kind of a Snake about two Foot long having a Head something like a Weesel and Eyes fiery like a Cat's as soon as it spy'd me it ran away and my Dog after it but he did not kill it but I believe put it in a terrible  Fright for it made a Noise something like a Weesel but louder which awaken'd my Companions When I told Mr  Musgrave  what I had seen he said it was a small Serpent but not very hurtful call'd the  Guabiniquinaze Serpent  from eating a little Creature of that Name something resembling a small Mole and the  Indians  and  Spaniards  eat of 'em and reckon 'em dainty Food  We now resolv'd for another Walk to discover what Inhabitants were our Neighbours whether  Indians  or  Spaniards  if  Indians  we design'd to patch up our Boat which had several Holes in't and make off as fast as we cou'd and Row Northward till we came to some Place inhabited by  Spaniards  But if we found the Latter to beg Protection and some Means to get to  Jamaica  whereupon we ventur'd out with these Resolutions We met with several fine large Cedar Trees and one particularly so large that Mr  Musgrave  and I cou'd but just fathom it with our Hands joyn'd  We had not gone far before my Dog began to bark when turning my Head on one Side I beheld a Black approaching towards us and being startled at the Sight I cock'd my Piece and resolv'd to fire at him but he call'd to me in  English  and told me he did not come to do any Harm but was a poor distress'd  Englishman  that wanted Food and was almost starv'd having eat nothing but Wild Fruit for four Days Upon that I let him come near where he was soon known by Mr  Rouse  to be  Willam Plymouth  the Black that was Trumpeter to the Captain that commanded the Pyrate Ship Upon his knowing him we sat down and gave him some Provision which we had brought with us because we design'd to be out all Day  After he had refresh'd himself a little we ask'd him how he came into this Island Why answer'd he we were Cruising about  Cuba  in Hopes of some  Spanish  Prize when a Storm arose and drove us upon a Rock where our Ship was beat to Pieces and not above Eighteen Men sav'd beside the Captain And did  that wicked Wretch escape the Shipwreck Yes answer'd  Plymouth  but to undergo a more violent Death For says he as soon as ever we landed we wander'd up in the Country to see for some Food without any Weapons but a few Cutlasses having lost our first Arms but however we all got something or other to defend our selves on Shore as long Clubs which we got from the Trees we found in our Walks our Captain resolv'd if he met with any  Indians  or  Spaniards  Huts that he wou'd murder all that he found in 'em for fear they shou'd make their Escape and bring more upon us Thus he encourag'd his Men to follow him with their Clubs says he we will walk till we find fome beaten Path and there lie hid till Night when we may go on to some Houses and come upon 'em undiscover'd by which Means we may get Provision and other Arms For the  Indians  of  Cuba  use FireArms as well as the  Spaniards  and are full as dexterous in using 'em as any  Europeans  c After travelling about ten Miles to the N W we discover'd a Path upon which a Halt was commanded and to retire in  to the Woods again till Night which we did and din'd upon what Fruits we cou'd get upon the Trees  About two Hours before Night a Dog smell'd us out and running away from us bark'd most furiously upon that we were afraid of being discover'd which Fear prov'd true for in Half an Hour or thereabouts after the Dog left us we were saluted with several Arrows and MusquetShot that kill'd us three Men and wounded me in the Foot but it prov'd the Means of saving my Life For as soon as our Men perceiv'd what had happen'd they ran as hard as they cou'd to meet the Danger as knowing they cou'd do no Good till they came to HandyBlows I in endeavouring to follow 'em found my Hurt which prevented my keeping up with the rest but I cou'd hear and see 'em at it There was about Two Hundred  Indians  set upon our Men and in about Half an Hour kill'd 'em every One I saw the Captain lay about him desperately but at last fell being run thro' the Throat with a Wooden Stake As soon as ever they had  conquer'd 'em or rather murder'd 'em they fell to striping of 'em as fast as they cou'd and carry'd 'em off together with their own Dead which were many for the  English  sold their Lives very dearly  After they were all gone which I sound by their Screeming and Noise at a Distance I ventur'd to steal out from behind a Row of Bushes where I had plac'd my self to see what had happen'd I went to the Place of Battle where I found two of our Men that they had left with all their Arms and some of their own so I took up one of their best Musquets and a Cutlass and made farther into the Wood for fear of being caught which I had certainly been if I had staid a Quarter of an Hour longer for I soon heard 'em come Hooping Screaming and Hollowing back to fetch the other two Bodies and their Arms as I conjectur'd  I walk'd as far as my hurt Foot wou'd let me that Night and out of Danger of the  Indians  as I thought and then lay'd me down to sleep as well as I cou'd being  very hungry and sadly tir'd and slept pretty well till Morning when I proceeded forward in my painful Journey and directed my Course N E thinking that was the best Way to avoid the  Indians  and probably to meet with some  Spaniards  whom I knew inhabited towards the North the  Havanna  the Capital City of the whole Island being seated there I wander'd for four Days eating nothing but Fruit in the Woods but laying my self down about an Hour ago to rest my self a little I thought I heard the Tongues of  Englishmen  which to my great Joy prov'd true I left my Musquet behind the Bushes for fear of alarming you but now after returning God and you Thanks for this timely Nourishment I'll go and fetch it which he did and we might easily know it to be an  Indian  Piece for they had rudely carv'd it all over with several Figures of Birds and Beasts  Now said I to my Companions you see the Reward of Wickedness He was not suffer'd by Providence to go on long in his Crimes tho' some are that are inur'd to Ills  yet they are overtaken at last when their Crimes are full blown for tho' Justice has Leaden Feet yet they always find he has Iron Hands And we too often see that he who kills his Adversary in a Duel tho' he escape the Law one time or other meets the same Fate himself  After poor  Plymouth  had refresh'd himself we set forward and walk'd along till we came to a Road that seem'd to be a Main Road of the Island by the Largeness Here we consulted what we shou'd do whether we shou'd go on or return for more Provision but we resolv'd to go a little Distance from the Road for fear we shou'd meet with more of the  Indians  and run the same Fate with the other  Englishmen  But  Plymouth  told us we were a great way from that Place where his Countrymen were kill'd for  Plymouth  tho' born in  Guinea  wou'd always call himself an  Englishman  as being brought over very young so we resolv'd one and all to venture  We sent up our Prayers to the Almighty for our Safety and went on with a Faith that we shou'd come off with Success  but we had not gone far when we heard the Reports of several Musquets and shouting in a barbarous Manner behind us Looking that Way we saw a  Mulatto  riding as fast as ever his Mule cou'd carry him when he came up to us he stop'd and cry'd in  Spanish  Make haste run for the  Indians  are coming upon you they have kill'd several  Spaniards  already and they are fighting with them Mr  Musgrave  who understood  Spanish  very well interpreted what he said to us he ask'd him how far they were off He answer'd just by and hearing another Shout put Spurs to his Mule and left us in an Instant We found by the Shouting and the Firing that they wou'd be immediately upon us so we retir'd out of the Road to let 'em pass and laid down upon our Bellies that they might not discover us Immediately came by about twenty  Spaniards  on Horseback pursu'd by near a hundred  Indians  Just as they came by us one  Spaniard  drop'd and crept into a Bush on the other Side of the Road and presently the  Indians  follow'd shouting in a horrid Manner and overtook  the  Spaniards  again who being very swift on Foot outrun an ordinary Horse and they had thrown away their FireArms to make them the lighter to run as we suppos'd The  Spaniards  knew they wou'd soon overtake 'em so only run to charge their Pistols and stand till they came up then discharge 'em to put 'em in Confusion and run again to prolong the time in Hopes of some Aid All this we understood by the  Spaniard  that crept into the Bush undiscover'd by the  Indians  by Reason of the Horses Feet and the Dust together he being the Foremost in Flight He told us moreover that about three Leagues farther there was a Fort belonging to the  Spaniards  to stop the  Indians  they using to make Inroads before that Fort was built even to the Gates of the City  Havanna  Upon this we consulted and resolv'd to follow upon the Edge of the Road to see how we cou'd be assisting we soon came even with 'em for they were in a narrow Place and the  Spaniards  kept 'em at Bay pretty well by good Fortune there was a high Hedge made by Trees all along as we went  which hinder'd us from being discover'd Here we resolv'd to fire upon 'em all together and then run further up and if possible get out into the Road and face 'em Accordingly we agreed to fire four and three and the first four to charge again immediately Mr  Musgrave  Mr  Middleton  Mr  White  and my self agreed to fire first then  Hood Rouse  and  Plymouth  which as soon as we had taken good Aim we did and firing at their Backs kill'd four downright and wounded several for I had order'd 'em to put two Bullets into each Piece As soon as ever we had fir'd our Musquets we let fly one Pistol each and then the other three fir'd their Guns As soon as  Plymouth  had fir'd he ran and charg'd our four Guns he having never a Pistol and then we let fly our other Pistols With these Discharges we had kill'd at least fifteen  Indians  and put the rest into such Frights that they began to run for with the Dust and Bustle they made they cou'd hardly distinguish from whence the Fire came neither did they stop till they met with the poor wounded  Spaniard  who had crept out hearing the Discharge of our Pieces as we suppos'd they fell upon the poor Fellow with Shouts and Outcries and tore him to pieces never minding the  Spaniards  pursuing 'em who cry'd  Miracalo Miracalo  a Miracle a Miracle By this Time we got within twenty Yards of the End of the Hedge where we Seven fir'd our Musquets and left 'em to  Plymouth  to charge then we ran in upon 'em with our Pistols and discharg'd 'em close upon 'em With this last Fire we drop'd 'em twelve Men and they scream'd out and ran away as fast as they cou'd We did not think fit to follow 'em for it was not to any Purpose being they were soon out of Sight We charg'd our Guns and Pistols again and the twelve  Spaniards  did the like they having Nine in the last Conflict kill'd and two desperately wounded They gave us Thanks for our Rescue and said we were surely sent from Heav'n to their Relief they let us know they were Taxgatherers for the King of  Spain  and were oblig'd to go in Numbers and well arm'd for fear of  these desperate  Indians  who about nine Years ago set upon 'em and kill'd Eighteen of 'em and but two escap'd but never met with any Molestation from that Time till now so that this Time thinking the Danger over we lessen'd our Number from Fifty to Thirty which I suppose the  Indians  having Notice of was the Occasion of their setting upon us They said it was to no Purpose for to go back for the rest of their Companions that were kill'd which being a Mile of they had taken with 'em  We had not gone above half a League onward but we heard dreadful Shoutings as before and looking behind us it being a strait Road we cou'd perceive a Cloud of Dust and the  Indians  running full Speed towards us Upon which we put down our two wounded Men that were on Horseback and mounted upon the  Spaniards  spare Horses Now we being nineteen Horsemen resolv'd to stand it We divided into Ranks four in a Rank which made five Ranks only there was but three in the last Rank So we resolv'd to keep directly one behind the other and when the first File had  fir'd to fall in the Rear and charge again The  Spaniards  wou'd make up the three first Ranks as they said they cou'd not in Honour expose us to the first Onset being we ventur'd our Lives in coming to their Assistance We had no Time to dispute for now they were just upon us and to our Surprize had several Fire Arms among 'em As soon as they got within a Hundred Paces of us they fir'd but not above two of their Pieces went off the rest were clog'd with Dust in running that very happily for us hinder'd their Discharging The Shot miss'd us by Providence and we wou'd not give 'em Time to charge again but we mov'd forward and fir'd in upon 'em and did great Execution when it came to our Turn to fire we in the Heat forgot our Orders but after we had discharg'd our Guns and Pistols we fell in with 'em with our Cutlasses and being rais'd above 'em by being on Horseback did great Execution and that with the  Spaniards  charging and firing again put 'em to the Rout but now we follow'd 'em being on Horseback and dispers'd 'em  so that it was impossible for 'em to rally any more that Night However we took four of 'em Prisoners and tying their Hands behind 'em fasten'd 'em to two of our foremost Horses the rest following after that they might not get Loose  We were met in the Road by twenty  Spanish  Horse with each a FootSoldier behind 'em who were upon the full Gallop to our Assistance being alarm'd by the  Mulatto  that rode by but I believe some were glad they came too late The Officer and the rest saluted us very courteously when they heard how luckily we came to their Assistance but fell a whipping the poor naked  Indians  so barbarously that tho' they deserv'd it I cou'd not bear to see it done in cold Blood and tho' the Blood follow'd every Lash yet they never cry'd out This is the chief Cause of the Hatred of the  Indians  when ever the  Spaniards  get any of 'em in their Power they put 'em to all manner of Torture but if on the contrary they would use 'em civilly and discharge 'em now and then I am sure they might live in perfect Friendship with 'em  For the  Indians  are goodnatur'd loving and affable till they are incens'd and then they are implacable  We arriv'd at the Fort about Evening and were very well entertain'd The Officer did not doubt but to procure us a Ship▪ to transport us to  Jamaica  tho' they had Orders from  Havanna  to secure all  English  Vessels there being a War talk'd of between the  Spanish  and  French  and  English  and  Dutch  The next Day the Officer mightily brag'd of being an old  Spaniard  that is born in  Spain  and of an ancient Family and Mr  Musgrave  made us very merry upon the Road in interpreting the Don's Speeches We found all along from the Fort a great many Gentlemens Houses pleasantly situated and the Country all along yielding delightful Prospects  We were well entertain'd at a Gentleman's House at Dinner with Provisions dress'd after the  English  Way and all manner of Sweetmeats and cool Wines The Gentleman had a Vault or Cellar thirty Foot deep under Ground He spoke pretty good  English  and had been  a Factor several Years in  London  and knew our Customs and Manners very well and prefer'd our Way of dressing Victuals before their own He had an  English  Cook from a  Tavern  behind the  RoyalExchange  that he brought with him into  Spain  and from thence to  Cuba  where he had a vast Estate left him His Cook's Name was  Hodges  a good understanding Fellow and made very much of us and wou'd fain have had us to stay with his Master longer But as soon as we had din'd we were oblig'd to get on Horseback and away for the  Havanna  which we reach'd about six aClock in the Evening We had Rooms alloted us and several  English  and  Irish  Men came to see us that liv'd there  Havanna  is the Capital City of the whole Island of  Cuba  and has as great a Trade as any Place belonging to the  Spaniards  in the  WestIndies  It has one of the finest Harbours in the Universe not for its Greatness but its Security yet able to contain five hundred Ships of the greatest Burthen The Mouth of  the Harbour is commanded by a Platform and a square Fort fasten'd together by a strong Boom or Iron Chain that no Ship can enter The most shallow Part of the whole Harbour is eight Fathom Water and all its Banks is pav'd round with flat Stone so that a Vessel of a Thousand Tun may lay her Side to it and unlade Just between the two Forts there stands a round Water Tower where they discover to the Town how many Vessels are coming towards the Harbour by putting out a Flag for every Ship This Place is the best fortify'd and garrison'd in all the  Indies  to secure the Plate Fleet and all other Ships that meet here to set Sail altogether for  Spain  This City is very large near as big as  Bristol  in  England  and the Houses are handsomely built but after the  Spanish  Fashion There are Two handsome Churches fine and well built with Spires and an Organ in each besides several Chappels and a Foundatien laid for a third Church while we were there This City almost as soon as it was built was sack'd by a  French  Pyrate in the Year who was driven thither by a Tempest and landing his Men well arm'd took the City in Spite of all their Resistance and burnt many of the Houses they being most part Wood and had consum'd 'em all had not the  Spaniards  redeem'd the rest by paying 'em a Thousand Ducats Upon the receiving of the Money they made out to Sea and the same Evening came into the  Havanna  three Ships from  Spain  who hearing of what had chanc'd prepar'd to follow 'em taking several Soldiers on Board 'em the Admiral who sail'd best got the first Sight of the  Frenchman  but being fearful to attack him before the other Ships came up lay by The  Frenchman  seeing that boldly set upon the first Ship and took her without fighting the second seeing that tack'd about and ran aShore which was taken by the Ship's Boat the third also run the same Fate Flush'd with this Success they return'd to the  Havanna  the second time and exacted a Thousand  Ducats  more or else they threaten'd to level the City with the Ground which  was paid 'em immediately Then they took their last Leave with this rich Booty and sail'd for  Rochel  in  France  where they shar'd their Prizes After this they built their Houses with Stone as they are now which nevertheless the  English  took about twelve Years after  There are many fair Harbours besides the  Havanna  in  Cuba  as that of St  Jago  City and Harbour which is a handsome Place seated on the South of the Island and is also a Bishop's See under the Archbishoprick of St  Domingo  Three Leagues from St  Jago  lies those famous Copper Mountains call'd by the  Spaniards Sierra de Cobre  There's another Town and Harbour situated on the Eastern Part of  Cuba  call'd  Baracoa  where they gather the best Ebony of all the  Indies  There's many other good ones as St  Salvador Trinedad Puerto del Principe  which has a Fountain near it that some times of the Year produces Liquid Pitch  Cuba  was formerly divided into Eight Provinces and Governments and better  Peopl'd than any other Island in  America  before the  Spaniards  invaded 'em but now there are but few  Indians  which inhabit several Parts of the Island unmolested by the  Spaniards  but the Natives can never forget their Barbarity which they have by Tradition from Father to Son Nay I have been inform'd that they keep a solemn Festival once a Year which was the Time that the Massacre of the  Indians  happen'd and if they can get any  Spaniards  they sacrifice 'em to satisfy  the Manes  of their dead Ancestors  Hugh Linscoten  the  French  Voyager relates that a  Cassick  or one of the Lords of a Province caught a  Spaniard  at their first Landing and threw him into a River to see if he wou'd drown which he did and that satisfy'd him they were not Immortal Whereupon he encourag'd his Men and repuls'd the  Spaniards  several times with great Loss but at last run the same Fate with the rest of the Natives 'Tis reported that the  Spaniards  first and last had massacreed Sixty Thousand  Indians  in the Island of  Cuba  La Casas  a Bishop in  New Spain  that wrote the History of the  Indies  tells us this Story of another  Cassick  that was taken by the  Spaniards  in  Cuba  and condemn'd to be burnt alive with green Wood that his Torture might be the longer and more exquisite While he was ty'd to the Stake before the Fire was lighted a Fryar that was present preach'd to him the Truth of the Christian Religion and that all who dy'd in that Faith and trusted in God that form'd the Earth and all the Creatures therein shou'd immediately after their Purgation ascend into Heaven the Residence of our Creator there to converse with Angels and such as dy'd in that Faith but on the contrary if they persisted in Ignorance and dy'd in a contrary Opinion they should descend into Hell and live in an Eternity of Torments Upon this the  Cassick  ask'd him if there were any  Spaniards  in Heav'n And being answer'd there were many Then says the  Cassick  let me go to Hell for I wou'd rather converse with those you call  Devils  than you  Spaniards  in Heaven for I am sure you are far the Worst of Devils and take Delight in nothing but tormenting us Tho' the Fryar's Preaching was certainly true yet Men of any Reason must conclude that no Religion can be propagated by Cruelty and the Sword which was always the  Spaniards  Method with the  Indians  whereever they came and all their Excuse was that if they had not us'd them in that Manner they cou'd never have made their Conquests being they were forc'd to lessen 'em for fear their Numbers might overpower 'em so that in short as  Dryden  says in his Conquest of  Mexico  by the  Spaniards You threaten Peace but you invite a War  I met here with a Priest that I am sure harbour'd nothing of Cruelty in his Breast for he came to see us every Day and in such a friendly Manner that charm'd us all He was always sending us one good Thing or other and wou'd take us to divert us Abroad He understood  Latin  very well and some  English  On the  Sunday  he preach'd an excellent Sermon in  Spanish  as Mr  Musgrave  inform'd  us whose Chief Heads ran upon us and to excite Charity in his Auditors to let us have what was necessary in carrying us to  Jamaica  The next Day he brought us to the Value of Fifty Pound in  Spanish  Dollars which were collected at the Church Doors for us There was a small Vessel of about Forty Tun upon the Stocks that was bought of the Owners for us and a Collection made in the Town for Money to pay for it We told 'em of the Provision we had left on Shore which by our Computation cou'd not be above twenty Leagues off but they told us it would be difficult to find it One Day a  Spaniard  met us walking with Father  Antonio  in one of the Cloysters of the Convent and reprimanded him for favouring  Hereticks  as he call'd us so much He thought none of us understood  Spanish  so was more free in his Conversation Says Father  Antonio  we ought to use Charity even to Brute Beasts and much more to our Fellow Creatures who wear with us our Creator's Image I wou'd not be thought to make a  Schism in our Religion which I am sure is the holiest and most pure but yet I cannot consent in my Thoughts that All who are out of the Pale of our Church must suffer Damnation it wou'd be horrid to think it and would take away from the Lustre of our Opinion which shines so brightly If they are in any Errors concerning their Belief God in whose Breast it lies can open their Eyes when he thinks fit that they may see those Errors Then added the  Spaniard  with the same Reason you may say the  Indians  and Natives may still remain in Ignorance till Heaven shall think sit to open their Eyes as you say and if so the  Missionary  Fathers may spare their Trouble No reply'd the Father We are there appointed by Providence to bring 'em out of the Cloud that dims their Sight But of People that own Christ and serve the same God with us who differ but in a few outward Forms of Worship it is very hard to believe that those instructed in that Worship must inevitably sink into  Damnation I can't tell what the  Spaniard  's Thoughts were upon this Discourse but I am sure he was more charitable than before for he pull'd out of his Purse a  Moidore  and gave Father  Antonio  for our Use which it seems he had refus'd to do when he went about collecting for us After he was gone he told us his Discourse  Pro  and  Con  and what he cou'd not make out in  English  Mr  Musgrave  clear'd to us from the other's telling him in  Spanish  what he meant  The End of the Second  BOOK  THE VOYAGES AND ADVENTURES OF Capt  Richard Falconer  BOOK III  _WE were told our Vessel was ready and therefore might be going when we pleas'd It was a very neat one as ever was built by the  Spaniards  and carried between thirteen and fourteen Tun  We had all sorts of Provision sent on Board for half a Year or more so that we only stay'd for the Wind to rise it being quite calm  While we stay'd there the four unfortunate  Indians  were to be executed in the midst of the  Parade  They were first to be drag'd by four Horses naked along the great Street to the  Parade  and then to be chain'd to a Post fix'd for that Purpose and burnt to Death I must confess when I saw with what barbarous Cruelty they design'd to use 'em I repented my being an Instrument in the taking of 'em This Execution was order'd to be between seven and eight in the Evening being then it was coolest All the  Indian  Slaves that serv'd  Spanish  Masters in the Town were ordered to go and be Spectators of the Tragedy that they might see what they must expect if they ever offer'd to Rebel in the like manner When the Time came the whole Street was crowded with a vast Number of People of all Conditions But such a Sight I never desire to see again each  Indian  was ty'd by the Feet to the Harnass of the Horse and so drag'd from  the Prison to the Place of Execution upon the bare Stones naked their Arms tied upon their Breasts and fasten'd upon their Backs that they might not lift 'em up to save themselves as they were dragg'd along the Stones but by that time the poor Creatures came to the  Parade  their Skin of their Legs Thighs and Back were almost strip'd off yet without the least Complaint As soon as they were ty'd fast to the Stake they took from a Pot of Liquid Pitch boiling hot a Stick with something fasten'd to the End on't and rub'd over their naked Bodies One of them then I observ'd began to faint but was rated by another of his Fellow Sufferers in their own Language which none understood but  Indians  and the Fellow seem'd to bear it much better Before the Fire was put to the Pile a Fryer step'd up to them and in  Spanish  spoke to the  Indian  that was ready to faint before who had been Servant in the Town but run away from his Master and understood  Spanish  The Fryer desir'd 'em if they would be happy in the other World to acknowledge themselves Christians and  go out of the World in that Faith Upon this the  Indian  answer'd  When I lived among you said he and was taught to worship your God you told me he was an upright God and a just God to them that serv'd him Faithfully but an avenging Power to those that once Offended him If so how comes it to pass that he has not punish'd you for all your Crimes You have taught me that Whoring and Adultery were Sins not to be Pardon'd and yet you commit those Sins as if you were in no fear of any Punishment Murder is one of your Commandments not to be forgiven when at the same Time you'll hire a Bravo to kill a Stranger that looks but wantonly on your Wives In short I know not any one thing that I have heard preach'd to us poor  Indians  that you practise your selves Therefore if your  Spanish  God be as you describ'd him to us the Curse must fall upon you if we can't believe in him being we are deter'd by the Cruelties you inflict upon us in serving him as you would have us when we find your Actions and Words differ  more than our Complexions You preach up Holiness and Righteousness but you Practise Debauchery and Lewdness  He said more which was to excite the  Indians  to Rebel but they put a stop to it by putting Fire to the Wood which being compos'd of several Combustible Matters soon consum'd the poor Wretches  When all was over Father  Antonio  took us home to his Lodgings to give us a small Collation for the last time being the next Day we did All design to lie on Board in Expectation of the Winds rising We told him by Mr  Musgrave  That we thought it a great Weakness in them to preach in that manner to  Indians  in their Condition and it would be apt to make others despise their Religion says Mr  Musgrave  it is like courting a Woman to Love by Stripes pardon the Comparison Why says Father  Antonio  I must confess it is not what any of our Fathers like but it is what we are order'd to do and therefore must not be deny'd Besides at first it was a piece of barbarous Policy in the first Conquerors of the  Indies  they would order the Missionaries to preach to  all  Indian  Criminals but out of hearing of any Spectators so as soon as they were executed they would declare to all the  Indians  that they died Christians and were happy Mr  Musgrave  ask'd him What made them use 'em so inhumanely was it not enough that they suffer'd Death but must be tortur'd in that barbarous Manner He replied It was done to terrifie the other  Indians  from any Violence Mr  Musgrave  answer'd That was certainly wrong for as they are an implacable sort of People and have handed down to them from Father to Son the first Massacre tho' almost Two hundred Years ago they must needs remember these Cruelties of so fresh a Date which revives in their Memories the former if they had any Mind to forget 'em He could not say much to it he said but evaded the Discourse by bidding us be merry that is innocently and disoffensively so for he did not allow of Disorders in any one so we refresh'd our selves and took our Leaves of the good Father who Bless'd and Embrac'd us and said he would pray to Heaven for  our prosperous Voyage So on the next Day we paid our hearty Acknowledgments to all our Benefactors and went on Board where we had not been a Quarter of an Hour before an extraordinary Message came from the Governor for  Plymouth  our Black who went with them without any Hesitation and return'd with a Present from the Governor of several Bottles of Rack  Spanish  Wines Fowls Rice and Brandy with twenty Pieces of  Spanish  Gold as the Messenger told us in Recompense for the Loss of one of our Companions for the Governor had sent for  Plymouth  to know if he would serve him in Quality of his Trumpeter and he would settle a Pension upon him for Life  Plymouth  thought fit to accept of it as having no Master nor knowing when he should have one But he got leave to come on Board to bid us farewel which he did in a very Affectionate manner I bid him have a care to please the  Governor  and then he need not fear doing well so we parted with  Plymouth  with our hearty Thanks recommended to Father  Antonio  for all his Favours  Plymouth  had a Trumpet given him by the Governor as soon as he came on shore which he brought with him and sounded all the Way in the Boat as he went back again to oblige us for really he sounded extraordinary well and had learnt on several other Instruments having a tolerable Understanding in Musick We were sorry to part with  Plymouth  as being a faithful honest Fellow yet glad he had got so good a Master The Wind rising we weigh'd Anchor and left the Port with three Huzza's and a Volley of Small Arms we having no Cannon and in two Days lost Sight of the Island  Cuba  This famous Island of  Cuba  which was first call'd  Joanna  by  Columbus  the first Discoverer afterwards  Fernandina  then  Alpha  and  Omega  as being the First and Last Island the  Spaniards  touch'd at But afterwards was call'd  Cuba  and still retains that Name This is reckon'd one of the Four Islands of the  Barlovento  The others are  Hispaniolo Jamaica  and  PortoRico  The North Side of  Cuba  is fortified with a vast Number of small Islands call'd the  Lucaies  which some Geographers  have taken for a Part of the main Land The chief is  Bahama  which forms the Gulph of  Florida  the Passage that all Ships go through when they come out of the  WestIndies  into  Europe  Cuba  has on the North  Jucatan  a Province on the main Land distant about Leagues and on the South  Jamaica  about Leagues In length and in the broadest Part about The Soil in most Parts that are inhabited by  Spaniards  is Fruitful and much more Healthy than  Hispaniola  The Tobacco is reckon'd the best in the  Spanish WestIndies  I have seen very large Vines there which bear excellent Grapes but not fit to make Wine many have tried but it turns sour in a few Days And for Birds Beasts and Fishes it comes up to if not exceeds any of the other Islands The Bird  Flamingo  is a Fowl something bigger than our ordinary Geese but Legs and Neck twice as long and all over red and generally go in a Body at a Distance they look like a Company of Soldiers marching The  Spaniards  have a Proverb here That the Time will come that  English  Men will walk as freely in their Streets as the  Spaniards  do now if it were so it would be of a prodigious Advantage to the  English  being the  Havana  is a Strait that Commands all the Ships that come out of the  Indies  for  Europe  and I really think from what I have seen that it would be in the Power of Ten thousand Men with a Fleet proportionable to overcome the whole Island in a little Time Besides it is observ'd that there are more Prizes brought into the  Havana  than any four Havens in the  Indies  While we were at the  Havana  a  Spaniard  carried two strange Beasts about the Streets for a Show that he brought from  Brazil  the one was call'd  Ai  with a Head something resembling that of a Man's and cover'd with rough short gray Hair Each Foot has three Claws close together about a Finger long very sharp Teeth with a smooth high black Nose very small sleepy Eyes and no Ears with a Tail small above and broad at the Bottom with Hair all over the Body of an Ash colour This Beast is about the Size of a large Fox but so lazy a Creature that when it gets up a Tree it never  comes down▪till it has devour'd every Leaf and when it has done it will sit there twenty Days together without eating and almost starv'd before it will take the pains to go down to feed It can't travel or creep in a whole Day not above a Quarter of a Mile This that was shown to us never would stir till rouz'd with a stick and it would be asleep again in an Instant  The other Creature was something like a  Baboon  but considerably larger with a Face and long Beard like an old Man's and hairy like a Goat all over the Body his Ears bald his Eyes black large and Sparkling He that show'd it to us call'd it a  Cayon  its Tail is about four or five Foot long which they twist round a Tree and so fling themselves to the next They are very Fierce and Subtile and when Wounded will set upon their Adversary without any Fear and if forc'd to climb the Trees they carry their Mouths and Hands full of Stones to throw at Travellers as they pass by and when wounded they set up a shriek that immediately brings all of their Kind within Hearing to their Succour who stop the Wound  with Leaves and Moss which will soon be heal'd This that we saw was brought up very young by the Person that had him and would play many comical Tricks As he was shown to us he urin'd in his Paw and threw it in our Faces before we were aware and while I was a wiping mine he gave me such a Salute with his Tail that made me stand farther off which seem'd to please him mightily for he look'd at me and chatter'd as much as to say I have given it you The  Spaniard  told us they us'd to play at a certain Game with the Natives for Money and would often win and then go spend what they had got upon a Liquor that made them Drunk and as soon as they found themselves so they would retire very decently and take a Nap by which they were very often caught  Joseph de Acosta  that wrote the History of the  WestIndies  in  Spanish  tells a Story of one of these Sort of Creatures going to a Tavern with a Pot and Money to pay for his Wine▪ yet would not part with his Money till they had fill'd his Pot with the Wine but in the mean time beat  four or five Boys that did their Endeavour to take it from him and carried it safe to them that sent him  Peter Martyr  relates another Story of one of them that seeing a  Spaniard  going to fire a Gun at him snatch'd up a little Child that was there and held it before him as a Buckler and would not let it go before the  Spaniard  was retir'd then he laid the Child gently down and ran away after having first Urin'd upon it  The Fellow that show'd them sold 'em to the Governor of  Havana  for Two hundred Dollars and would have gone with us to  Jamaica  or any where but we durst not take him without an Order from the Governor who does not suffer any one to go out of the Island without a Pass from him which costs a Dollar and brings into his Purse a great deal of Money in the Year having no other Revenue from the King of  Spain  only so much a Year for a Table and a Pallace ready furnish'd with every thing that is necessary besides Servants Every Ship that comes in pays two Dollars and at  going out four more so that the Government of this Island exceeds in its Profit any other Government except the Vice Roy of  Mexico  in the  Spanish WestIndies  The Weather continued favourable so that we arriv'd at  Jamaica  without meeting any thing remarkable in our Passage As soon as we had cast Anchor I order'd the Boat to be made ready to carry me on Board my own Ship which I saw Ride there But when I got up the Shipside I found my Cloaths selling at the Mast at  Who bids more  which is the Method as soon as a Person is dead or kill'd the first Harbour they Anchor in the Cloaths of the Deceas'd are brought upon Deck and Sold by Auction the Money to be paid when they come to  England  for it generally happens that Sailors have not any till they come Home again  They were at the last Article when I came up the Shipside which was a pair of black worsted Stockings that cost I believe about four Shillings which went at twelve and Sixpence tho' they had been worn As soon as I was seen by 'em  some cry'd out a Ghost a Ghost and others ran away to secure the Cloaths they had bought suspecting that now I wou'd have 'em again When they were satisfy'd of my being alive and were told my Story they were all rejoic'd at my good Fortune but none would be prevail'd upon to let me have my Cloaths again So I took up the SlopBook and cast up what they were sold for and found that what cost me about twenty Pound were sold for four times the Money When I was satisfied in that I called every Person one by one that had bought any of my Cloaths and struck a Bargain with them for ready Money and bought them for about ten Pound but the ready Money pleas'd them mightily  Captain  Wase  being sick ashore I went to pay him a Visit where he was mighty glad to see me as believing I had perish'd he told me that the Vessel hung Lights out for several Hours that I might know where to swim and laid by as long as the Wind would permit as the Crew acquainted him when they came into Harbour The Captain told me That he did not think  he should live long therefore was mighty glad I was come to take Charge of the Ship which had sail'd before if he had been in a Condition to bear the Sea From thence I went on Board my new Bark and settled my Affairs there with my Companions who were mighty sorry to think of parting with me  Hood  and  Rouse  desir'd they might be receiv'd on Board as Sailors and go for  England  with us for  Hood  was an  Englishman  I mean born in  England  and  Rouse  had Friends there Besides it was as easie to go from  England  to  Bermudas  as from  Jamaica  So I spoke to the Captain who was very well pleas'd to receive them being he had lost five Men by the Distemper of the Country The poor Captain died in a Week after my coming and left me Executor for his Wife who liv'd at  Bristol  As soon as we had Buried him I went on Board with my two Men and did design to Sail in three Days at farthest which I would have done before but that I was hinder'd by wanting a Chapman for our Bark being we had Shares to dispose of when I came on Board the Master told  me he had no Occasion for the two Men to add to their Charge says I that's as I shall think fit for the Power is in my Hands now And who put that Power into your Hands says the Master He that had the Power so to do says I the Captain whereupon I shew'd him in Writing He told me it did not signify any thing and that he would find no one of the Sailors would obey a Boy uncapable to steer a Vessel Says I I don't desire to have any Command over you but only to represent the Captain that's deceas'd We have no want of any Representatives replies the Master and you shall go in your own Station or not at all It would be a pretty thing added he for my Mate to become my Captain and as I was design'd by the Captain to have the Command of the Vessel before you came so I intend to keep it But says I this Paper sign'd by his own Hand is but of two Days Date and you can't show any thing for the Command as you pretend to Therefore says I I'll make my Complaint to the Governor and he shall Right me Ay ay do so  says he I'll stand to any thing he shall Command Whereupon  Rouse Hood  and my self went into the Boat again and row'd immediately on Shore but the Governor was six Miles up in the Country and it being pretty late we design'd to wait for his coming home which we were told would be in the Morning early So I went on board the Bark and laid all Night the Ship lying beyond the Keys two Leagues from the Harbour in order to sail The next Morning getting up with an Intent to wait upon the Governor and looking towards the Place where the Ship lay over Night found she was gone and casting my Eyes towards Sea saw a Ship or Leagues distant from us which we suppos'd to be ours I immediately went on Shore and found the Governor just come to Town and made my Complaint He told me there was no Remedy but to send immediately to  Blewfields Bay  where he supposed they would stop to get Wood which was usual with our Ships that were bound for  England  Whereupon there was a Messenger order'd for  Blewfields  which I accompanied to give Instructions to the  Officer that commanded at the Fort to seize the Master of the Ship and order him before the Governor at  PortRoyal  So we got on Horseback and reach'd it in three Days it being almost a hundred Miles When we came there we found several Ships in the Harbour but none that we wanted So we waited a Week but all to no Purpose for she past the Bay as mistrusting our Design upon this we were oblig'd to return with a heavy Heart and tell the Governor of our ill Success Who pitied me and told me he would see me ship'd in the first Vessel bound for  England  So I went on board my own Bark where they were all glad to see me tho' sorry I was so disappointed Now I was very glad that I had not dispos'd of my Bark for I thought now it might be of use to me We consulted together to know what was best to do at last I made a Bargain with them if they would venture with me in our Bark to  England  I wou'd give them not only my Share of her but as much Money as came to the other two Shares if they would be willing to part with them Upon this  we agreed and with what Money I had I began to lade my Vessel with Things to Traffick with I bought a good Quantity of Indigo some Cotton Sugar and Rum In short I laid out the best Part of my Money and on  June  the st set Sail and steered our Course for  England  Before I leave  Jamaica  I think it will not be amiss to give some Account of the dreadful Earthquake that happen'd there in I am sure it is a true Account of it being it was wrote by the Rector of  PortRoyal  's own Hand who was upon the Place when the Accident happen'd You shall have it in his own Words  June    Dear Friend  FROM on board the  Granado  Merchant in  PortRoyal  Harbour I doubt not but you will hear both from  Garret  's and  Bris  's CoffeeHouse of the great Calamity that hath befallen this Island by a terrible Earthquake on the  th  Instant Which have thrown down almost all the Houses Churches Sugar Works Mills and Bridges thro' the whole Country it tore the Rocks and Mountains and destroy'd some whole Plantations and threw them into the Sea but  PortRoyal  had much the greater Share in this terrible Judgment of God I will therefore be more particular in giving  you an account of its Proceeding that you may know what my Danger was and how unexpected my Preservation On  Tuesday  the  th  of  June  I had been at Church reading Prayers which I did every Day since I was  Rector of  PORTROYAL to keep up some  show  of Religion amongst a most Ungodly and debauch'd People When Prayers being ended I went to a Place hard by the Church where Merchants use to meet where the President of the Council was who acts in Chief till we have a new Governor came into my Company and engag'd me to take a Glass of WormwoodWine with him as a whet before Dinner He being my very good Friend I stay'd with him upon which he lighted a Pipe of Tobacco which he was pretty long taking and not being willing to leave him before it was out I was detain'd from going to one Captain  Rudder  's where I was to Dine whose House upon the first Concussion sunk into the Earth then into the Sea with his Wife and Family and some others that came to Dinner with him But to  return to the  President  and his Pipe of Tobacco before it was out I found the Ground rolling and moving▪ underneath my Feet upon which I said to him Lord Sir What's this He reply'd very composedly being a very grave Man it is an Earthquake be not afraid it will be soon over but it did encrease every Minute and we heard the  Church  and  Tower  fall upon which we ran to save our selves I quickly lost him and made towards  Morgan  's  Fort  which being a wide open Place I thought to be there more secure from the falling Houses but as I made towards it I saw the Earth open and swallow up a Multitude of People and the Sea mounting in upon us over the Fortifications I then laid aside all hopes of escaping and resolv'd to make towards my own Lodging and there to meet Death in as good a Posture as I could but I was forc'd to cross and run thro' two or three narrow Streets the  Houses  and  Walls  fell on each side me some  Bricks  came rolling over my  Shoes  but none hurt me When I came to my Lodging  I found all things in the same Order I left them in not a Picture of which there were several fair ones in my Chamber being out of it's Place I went to the  Balcony  to view the Street in which our House stood I saw never a House down nor the Ground so much as crack'd The People seeing me there cry'd out to me to come and Pray with 'em When I was come into the Street every one lead hold on my Cloaths and Embrac'd me that with their fear and kindness I was almost stiffled I persuaded 'em at last to kneel down and make a large Ring which they did I Pray'd with them near an Hour when I was almost spent with the Exercise they brought me a Chair the Earth working all the while with new Motions and trembling like the rolling of the Sea insomuch that sometimes whilst I was at Prayer I cou'd hardly keep my self upon my Knees by that time I had been half an Hour longer setting before 'em their many and heinous Sins Some Merchants came to me who desir'd me to go Aboard some  Ship in the Harbour and refresh my self they told me they had gotten me a Boat to carry me off Coming to the Sea which had entirely swallow'd up the  Wharfe  with all those goodly Houses on it most of 'em as fine as those in  Cheapside  and two entire Houses beyond it I upon the tops of some Houses that lay level with the Water got first into a  Canoe  and then in a long Boat which put me Aboard a Ship call'd the  Siam  Merchant where I found the President safe who was overjoy'd to see me I continu'd there that Night but could not Sleep for the returns of the Earthquake almost every Hour which made all the Guns in the Ship to jar and rattle The next Day I went from Ship to Ship to visit those that were taken up in Boats bruised and Dying and to Pray with 'em also to do the last Office to them in saying the Form of Prayer that is us'd at the Burial of the Dead which hath been my sorrowful Employment ever since I came Aboard this Ship with design to come for  England  we  having nothing but shaking of the Earth Thunder Lightning and foul Weather ever since And the People being so desperately Wicked it makes me afraid to stay in the Place for that very time this terrible Earthquake was as soon as it was Night a Crew of leud Rogues which they call Privateers fell to breaking open Warehouses with intent to rob and rifle their Neighbours whilst the Earth trembled under them and some of the Houses fell on 'em in the Act and those that remain still in the Place are as Impudent and Drunken as ever I have been twice ashore to Pray with the Bruis'd and Dying Persons and to Christen their Children where I met too many Drunk and Swearing I did not spare 'em nor the Magistrates who have suffer'd Wickedness to grow to so great a Height I have I bless God to the best of my Skill and Power discharg'd my Duty in that Place which you will hear from most Persons that come from hence I have Preach'd so seasonable to them and so plain in the last Sermon I Preach'd in  the Church by setting before them what would be the Issue of their Impenitence that they have since confess'd it look'd more like a Prophesy than a Sermon I had I confess an Impulse to do it and many times I have preach'd in the Pulpit Things that I never meditated at home and could not methought do otherwise The Day when all this befell us was clear affording not any Suspicion of the least Evil but in the Space of three Minutes about half an Hour after Eleven in the Morning  PortRoyal  the fairest Town of all the  English  Plantations the best Empire and Mart of this Part of the World exceeding in its Riches plentiful of all good Things was taken and shatter'd to Pieces sunk in and cover'd for the greatest part by the Sea and will in a short Time be wholly eaten up by it for some of those Buildings that yet stand and are left we every Day hear fall and the Sea daily incroaches upon the Town We guess by falling of the Houses and opening of the Earth and Inundation of the Waters that there are killed Fifteen Hundred Persons  and many of good Note of whom are my good Friend AttorneyGeneral  Musgrave  Martial  Reeves William Turner Thomas Turner  's Brother is lost I have lost the best Living that ever I had or shall have I came as I told you aboard this Ship in order to come home but the People are so Importunate with me to stay I know not what to say to them I must undergo great Hardships if I stay here the Country being broken all to pieces I must now live in a Hut and eat Yams and Potatoes for Bread which I could never endure drink Rum Punch and Water which were never pleasing to me I have wrote as effectually as I could to my Lord Bishop of  London  to send a younger Person who may better endure the Fatigue of it than I can Now it would look very unnatural in me to leave the People in their Distress and therefore whatever I suffer I would not have such a Blame lie at my Door I have acquainted my Lord of  London  That by Reason of the present Distress I am willing to continue  a Year longer They are going to build a new Town near the Rock in  Liguinea  the Garden of the Island The  French  from  Petigauies  did attack the Island on the North Side but were all defeated and destroyed it being near the time of the Earthquake  June    EVER since that fatal Day the most terrible that ever I saw I have lived on board a Ship for the shaking of the Earth returns every now and then Yesterday we had a very great one but it seems less terrible aboard than on shore Yet I have ventur'd to  PortRoyal  three times since its Desolation among the shatter'd Houses to bury the Dead and Christen their Children  Sunday  last I preach'd amongst them in a Tent The Houses that remain being so shatter'd that I durst not preach in them The People are overjoy'd when they see me amongst them and wept  very bitterly when I preach'd to them I hope by this terrible Judgement God will make them Reform themselves for there was not a more ungodly People upon the Face of the Earth It is a sad Sight to see such a fair Harbour cover'd with the dead Bodies of the People of all Conditions for our great and famous Burial Place the Pallisadoes was destroyed by the Earthquake and the Sea wash'd the Carcasses of those that were there Buried out of their Graves Their Tombs being dash'd to pieces by the Earthquake of which there were Hundreds in that Place Many rich Men are utterly ruined whilst many by watching Opportunities searching the sunk Houses even almost whilst the Earthquake lasted while Terror and Amazement had seized on all the considerable Persons have gotten great Riches We have had an Account from several Places of the Island of Mischiefs done there by the Earthquake From St  Ann  's we hear that above a Thousand Acres of WoodLand are wash'd into the Sea  carried away whole Plantations in divers Places but none suffered like  PortRoyal  where Streets were swallow'd up by the opening of the Earth The Houses and Inhabitants went down together Some of them were driven up again by the Sea which arose in the Breaches of the Houses wonderfully escaped Others were swallowed up to the Neck the Earth shut upon them and squeez'd them to Death And in that manner several are left buried with their Heads above Ground only some Heads the Dogs have eaten They are covered with Dust and Earth by the People which yet remain on the Place to avoid the Stench Thus I have told you a long and sad Story and God knows what worse may happen yet The People tell me they hear great Bellowing and Noises in the Mountains which makes some very Apprehensive of an Irruption of Fire if so I fear it will be more destructive than the Earthquake I know not how to stay and yet I cannot tell how at such a Juncture to quit my Station  Yours c  I believe this was the most terrible Earthquake that has ever happen'd since the Creation of the World and did more Damage They tell a Story of a wicked Fellow that in the Time of the Earthquake ravished a Merchant's Daughter and after murder'd her that he might not be discover'd but a Black that happened to be in another Room and hearing what had happen'd ran away to the Ship where her Father was to give him Notice that he might come and apprehend him But when he came and found his Daughter murder'd and the Villain gone he was almost Distracted and the House tumbling with the Earthquake he perish'd in the Ruins bemoaning his Daughter The execrable Wretch was soon overtaken with Divine Vengeance for going to make his Escape a large Stone from one of the falling Houses dropt on his Back and broke it where he was taken up in such Misery that he prayed for some one to knock him on the Head to put him out of his Torture The Pain was so violent that it took away his Senses and in the height of his Raving  discover'd himself to be the Author of the horrid Fact mention'd but he died without Repentance cursing every Body  Another Story that was told me was That a Gentlewoman had come out of the Country to lyein there being she would be better accommodated and was brought to Bed but two Days before The Husband was gone out and at the first shock of the House all her Servants left her with the Infant with her which with the Violence of the shock was overturn'd in the Cradle With this Accident the Gentlewoman in a Fright rose out of her Bed tho' in a weak Condition and took up her Child and feeling the House totter ran down Stairs in her Shift with her Infant in her Arms where she was met by her Husband who took her in his Arms to carry her away just as the House fell upon them all where they were drawn out but the Child was dead and the Mother died in half an Hour the Husband mightily bruised with much Pain linger'd out to the next  Day and then expir'd and were all three buried together in one Grave  One  Abraham Matthews  an Inhabitant of  PortRoyal  that was alive when I was there told me of a remarkable Providence that happen'd to him as he was packing up several Things to carry on Board some Vessel that was in the Harbour for the more Security He had no sooner come out of the House where he lodg'd but it fell down and smother'd several People within Just as he got to the Waterside the Boat was going off and as he put one Foot into the Boat the BoatMan push'd him out again and told him he must stay till he came back being the Boat was full The Boat in turning the Point by the Fort was overwhelm'd by a Point of the Shore which fell upon it and all that were in't perish'd This was the second Deliverance When he saw what had happen'd he retir'd to the Church which was open to return God Thanks and beg his farther Protection or if Death happen'd he could not choose a better Place to die in While he was at Prayers he saw one of the  Buccaniers  or Thieves stealing away his Bundle which he immediately followed seiz'd and took it from him As soon as he was out of the Church that fell to the Ground When he had got the Bundle he kneel'd upon the Earth to tie it faster the adjacent House sunk down also and smother'd the Fellow with several others that were in't Going a little farther he met some of his Acquaintance who were getting a  Canoe  ready to convey themselves on Board a Ship in the Harbour where he safely arriv'd and gave God Thanks for his many and happy Deliverances  We put in at  BlewfieldsBay  for the Conveniency of Wood and Water and when we were provided steer'd our Course onward for  England  But as we came within ten Leagues of the  Havana  a  Spanish  Man of War of Forty Guns came up with us who commanded us to strike our Sails which we did immediately and coming on Board us were surpriz'd to find us all  English  Men not expecting other than  Spaniards  from the building of our Vessel Whereupon they made us all Prisoners and sent fifteen  Men on Board us to carry the Vessel into the  Havana  Telling 'em how we came by the Vessel did not signify any thing for they said we were Pyrates and had seiz'd it And our Pass which we had from the Governor of the  Havana  not being to be found made Things appear but with an indifferent Face we were afraid we should find many Difficulties in getting our Liberty especially if they went to their Station which was St  Jago  But it happen'd better than we expected for she made directly to the Port of the  Havana  where we knew every thing would be plac'd in a true Light again When we were anchor'd and the People could come on Board us we were soon known and the Captain going to the Governor was soon inform'd of the Matter so we were releas'd immediately and had a Visit made us from Father  Antonio  and honest  Plymouth  who were mightily rejoic'd to see us  We were detain'd two Days before we could get away And then we set Sail with a brisk Gale first saluting the Town with our Guns and Patteraroes which I had forgot to mention our buying at  PortRoyal  In two Days after our first Sailing we made Cape  Florida  and entred the Gulph that bears the same Name and pass'd it without Danger But here a sudden Calm overtook us as frequently happens when your past the Gulph and the Current set strong to Westward occasion'd as we suppos'd by the opening of the Land upon that Coast The Calm lasting for four Days and we were insensibly carried within half a League of the Shore but a little Breeze rising from Land helped us farther out again But still our Danger more encreas'd for we soon perceiv'd three large  Canoes  making towards us full of  Indians  arm'd We had not much time to consult what to do for they gain'd upon us every Moment Now Death or something worse than Death glar'd us in the Face and most of us thought this the last Day we had to live Come Friends said I if we must die let's die bravely like  Englishmen  To die is just as common as to live only Life is choice but Death we still pursue and every step we take shortens our Journey If then we follow Death why should we  fear it Or if we shou'd fear what wou'd that avail since fearing cannot put back the Fated Hour Then let us like those that wou'd dispose of somewhat do it to the best Advantage We charg'd our Guns with double and round and our Patteraroes with MusketBalls The rest of our Arms we got in readiness and resolv'd to Die fighting and not suffer our selves to be taken to be miserably Butcher'd as all the  Indians  of  Florida  do when they get any Whites in their Power We resolv'd to fire our six Muskets upon 'em as soon as they came within reach so we took our aim two to each  Canoe  and fir'd upon 'em which did 'em some Damage for they stop'd upon it Which made us make the best of our way but they soon pursu'd us with loud and rude Shouts By this time we had charg'd our Muskets again and fir'd as before at the same distance but whatever damage we did 'em they came on as fast as they cou'd but not before we had charg'd our Pieces the third Time which we fir'd as before but did more Execution as being nearer to us and now we charg'd 'em  the  th  Time and laid them along upon the Deck for a farther Occasion for they being so nigh that our great Guns wou'd reach 'em with our double and round which we fir'd one at a time the first we fir'd at was the largest  Canoe  which put them in such confusion that they fell foul of one another and being in a huddle together we fir'd the other three that made a mighty Havock among 'em We now thought of a Victory instead of being made Slaves and bore up to them that we might make our  Patteraroes  of use to us which we fir'd upon 'em with Patridge or Musket Shot that answer'd our end for now they began to turn tail which we seeing fir'd our Muskets the  th  time which kill'd them two  Indians  And charging our great Guns with single Balls of pound Weight or Pounders as they call them at Sea and firing at their Boats or  Canoes  we sunk one of them but the Men swam to the other  Canoes  and taking hold of the sides with their weight turn'd it over Mr  Musgrave  and the rest of our Men advis'd to make up to them and in this  Confusion kill them all But I was satisfy'd with the disappointment they had met with and as it was not in their Power to hurt us farther resolv'd to make the best of our way But looking towards the shore saw Eight more of their  Canoes  making up to us this put us upon making all the Sail we cou'd and the Sea breeze being now pretty strong we made good way We thought the  Canoes  wou'd stay when they came up with the other three but they made after us a long with the those  Indians  that they had taken up We had charg'd our great Guns with great Shot and fir'd at them but mist them we charg'd them the  d  time and one Shot by good Fortune took the first  Canoe  and overset her which put them into more Confusion than before but still five of them pursu'd us which were met with by some of our MusketBalls that gave two of them their  Quietus est  And firing our great Guns once more sunk one of their  Canoes  but the Men soon got into the other and follow'd us still Seeing this we resolv'd to make one strong Effort and make the best of our way So we  back'd our main Sail and lay'd by for 'em and brought our four Guns to one side and our Patteraroes to bear accordingly we charg'd our Muskets once more and laid them in readiness with two half Pikes and our Cutlasses and now we resolv'd not to fire till every Gun might do Execution we staid till they came within two Ships length of us and then we fir'd upon them as fast as ever we cou'd which prov'd effectual for we kill'd 'em at least Twenty Upon which they set up dreadful uncommon Noises and row'd back as fast as ever they cou'd we gave them our farewel MusketShots and made the best of our way By a moderate Computation we kill'd them at least  Indians  without their once firing at us neither could we conceive how they intended to Assault us or whether they had any fire Arms for we saw none After we had brought our Vessel to rights again we Assembled our selves to Prayers and return'd our sincere Thanks to the Defender of the Weak and giver of all good Things for our happy Deliverance We saw the  Canoes  padling towards  Shore and were met by several others with a design as we supposs'd to assist them but we were now too far for them and there was nothing more to be fear'd and so we Sail'd on with a prosperous Gale and met with nothing worth note Till  Thursday July  the  th  we discover'd Land which amaz'd us all for we did not think of falling in with any Shore till we saw  England  We went to consult our Charts and saw we were near  Newfoundland  and finding that we steer'd directly into St  John  's Harbour which is the Capital of the Island I mean of that Part which belongs to the  English  The Harbour is large fair strong and Commodious commanded by several good Forts and a strong Boom that shuts it up The Town consists of about Houses built after the manner of the Houses in  England  Newfoundland  or  Terra Nova  was discover'd by  Sebastian Cabot  for King  Henry  the VII of  England  This Island is seated in of Northern Latitude and divided from the Continent by an Arm of the Sea about Leagues over it is  larger than  Ireland  the Climate is much the same as in  England  very wholesome has several commodious Harbours The  English  possess one Part and the  French  the other but the  English  are more Populous This Island is of great Benefit to the  English  as well as other Nations from the vast quantities of Fish that are caught upon the Banks of  Newfoundland  This is a very large Bank of Sand which extends a hundred and twenty Leagues to the West near the Continent and about Leagues broad in the middle and Sharpens to each end It is reckon'd the most extraordinary thing found in the Sea of that kind for Ships may Anchor tho' twenty or thirty Leagues from Land The Fruits are the same with us in  England  and the Soil so very rich that it will bare Pease Beans c without Tilage which are as good as any in  England  The Beasts the same only the Bear which is found there In short  Newfoundland  resembles  England  in every thing so much that if a Man cou'd be carry'd from thence in his Sleep he wou'd only think he was stray'd somewhere out of his Knowledge  There is only this to be said that there is not so many Inhabitants so there is more Plenty of every thing for human Life Their chief Trade is Fish but they send great Quantities of Musk Sables and other Furrs There is not one  Indian  to be found upon the whole Island but what are brought from other Countries and us'd as Servants tho' it is reported about Years ago towards the  NorthWest  Parts the  French  met with some  Indians  that us'd to help them to Cure their Fish and make their Oyl They describe them a civil sort of People but no Knowledge of a superior Deity and when attempted to be taught they wou'd Answer We are well contented with our own God neither do we desire any other Why shou'd we offer to change We think our Forefathers wiser than we are and they Worship'd the same with us Therefore as we think of going to the same Place where they are we must Worship the same Power You have your God and we have Ours every Nation must have a God according to their own Language Shou'd we Pray  to your God in our  Indian  Language how should we be understood or should you Pray to Ours what wou'd it avail you being he wou'd not know what you said to him Now we have not one God only but many as one for Fishing one for Fowling and another for Husbandry And when we are about any of these particular Buisinesses we Pray to that God for it wou'd be too much for one to mind them all Wou'd it not seem ridiculous for one of us if we wanted Success in Hunting to Pray to him that takes care of Fishing or you that wear Cloaths Wou'd you go to a Fisherman to bid him Cloath you You tell us there is a vast Number of Worshipers of your God in all Countries than what need you any more We will serve you as well and as faithfully as if we had but one God and Pray to our God's to give you Success in whatever you undertake If you Fish we'll Pray to that God if you go to fell Timber we'll Pray to that and so on to whatever you employ your selves in When you are out of their Dominions you must Pray for your selves to your  own God In short there is neither fair means or foul will ever bring these poor Creatures to the Knowledge of the true God If you are angry with them they will comply with you and say Well Well we will do as you wou'd have us but never think of it afterwards If you Reason calmly with them than the Answer you as above  After being here two Days we set Sail and made our Course for  England July    th  We met with no extraordinary Accident in our Passage till we discover'd the Land's End  August  the  st  How rejoyc'd I was to see my Native Country let them judge that have been in the same Condition as I have been and I may with truth say that the Transports felt in first seeing the white Cliffs of the Island that gave me Birth exceeded the Joy I receiv'd when I was deliver'd from the most imminent Danger Here we consulted whether it were better for us to go to  London  or to  Bristol  but every one allow'd  London  to be the best Mart for our Goods so we made for the  Thames  and the Weather being fair and a brisk  Gale we Anchor'd overagainst  Shadewell  Dock Now all that we had to do was to get Chapmen for our Goods I applied my self to a Merchant upon  Change  who soon struck a Bargain and with the Consent of my Companions sold the Lading bottom and all for Nine hundred and twenty Pound reckoning the Lading Seven hundred Pound which was my own and two hundred and twenty for the Vessel and every thing besides They were all contented with their Dividend but still resolv'd to go with me to  Bristol  to see after my Affairs there So we set out on foot intending to walk it and be a little Merry upon the Road for we expected more Diversion by walking it leasurely than going in any other manner I had turn'd all my Money into Bank Bills which amounted to  l  with my Money that I had for my Goods and sew'd them in the Wasteband of my Breeches not that there cou'd be any Danger being so many in Company We took the  Salisbury  Road tho' something out of our way being I resolv'd to carry my Friend to  Bruton  the Place of my Birth Comeing  thro'  Basingstoke  a Sailor met us begging Charity for God's sake I gave him Sixpence which he return'd me many thanks for I ask'd him how it came to pass that a lusty Sailor as he was did not go to Sea especially now War being talk'd of between the  English  and  French  He answer'd he was going to  London  for that intent but was oblig'd to be beholding to good Men's Charity to assist him in his Journey Why pursu'd I have you no Friends your Cloaths are good you don't seem to have beg'd long No answer'd he this is my first Day I made an end of the little Money I had last Night Have you been long from Sea says I but a Week I had the Misfortune to be cast away in sight of Harbour from whence came you ask'd I says he we came from  Jamaica  and were bound for  Bristol  but a violent Storm over took us within six Leagues from the Mouth of the River  Severn  and drove our Ship upon some Rocks in the Mouth of the Bay and all the Men perish'd but my self From  Jamaica  says I Pray what Ship The  Albion  Frigate reply'd he Who was your Captain added I The Captain dy'd at  Jamaica  but the Master supply'd his Place one  Jacob Bingley  Did you ever hear of one  Falconer  Yes he was the Mate suppos'd to be lost in a Voyage he made to the Bay of  Campeachy  but coming safe into Harbour afterwards the Captain before his Death gave him the Command of our Ship but the Master not approving of such a young Man to have the Power over him set Sail without him This I learn'd on Board afterwards for I and another Sailor were hir'd for the Voyage that Afternoon before the Morning we set Sail We had but an indifferent Passage the whole Voyage which was made up with nothing but Storms and Calms that caus'd a great deal of uneasiness and our Provision receiv'd Damage by the Saltwater which drove us to the last Extremity and when we were rais'd in our Hopes of setting our Feet upon our native Country we were devour'd by the tempestuous Waves I my self was taken up for Dead upon the Shore by a Fisherman Have you any Friends says  I at  London  None reply'd he every Place to me is Home a Sailor is never out of his way if so return with us to  Bristol  where we are bound and I'll promise you if I can't get you a Ship I'll give you where withal to carry you to  London  without begging We easily agreed upon the Matter and honest Tarr went on with us I ask'd him why he did not endeavour to get a Ship at  Bristol  he answer'd he wou'd rather chuse to go in a Man of War than a Merchant Man since War was approaching and he heard there was a Fleet fitting out for the  WestIndies  and if so says he there may be some hopes of getting something there either of  Jack Spaniard  or  Jack Frenchman  We came to  Bruton  and took Lodgings in the  MagpyeInn  where I visited all my Acquaintance and from thence we went in the same manner to  Bristol  where the first thing was to enquire after my poor Father But I was inform'd by Captain  Pultney  that he thought he was certainly Dead Tho' he had seen him but once since I had been Abroad and that was in the  January  before when he  came privately to him and told him he was settled in a small Village near  Hereford  and went by the name of  Hawkins  What convinces me he is Dead is that about two Months ago he sent me a Letter which I'll show you He went up Stairs and fetch'd it which contain'd these Words  SIR  WHEN I had settled my self in my little Tenement I began to think of turning Farmer that I might have some Imployment to pass away the tedious Hours of my voluntary Banishment but going the other Day to view a hollow Place where we had our  Marl  to  Marl  our Ground the Earth on a sudden fell upon me and I was scarce taken out alive my Back broke and bruis'd all over in a pitious Manner This is the first Day of rest or ease that I have had from my intollerable Pain It is allow'd and I am very well satisfy'd that I cannot survive it Pray be kind to my dear  Dick  if he ever lives to come home if not what  I have deposited into your Hands let it remain with you for your own use since my Daughter is provided for If I shou'd against the expectation of every Body recover you shall hear from me very soon if not believe that I am return'd to Earth from whence I came I hope I need not caution you once more to be kind to my poor Boy if he shou'd return and be a Father to him Comfort him amidst his Affliction and restore to him what I left with you with a dying Parents Blessing that he may be as Happy as his wretched Father was Miserable Which is the hearty desire of your Friend and Servant  Falconer  Grief so overcame me for a time that I was not able to speak to be rob'd of a Father and a Father I lov'd so dearly was a cutting Stroke and I was constrain'd to make use of all my young Philosophy to support it My Father had left the Writing of his Estate with Captain  Pultney  He having only Mortgag'd it before for five hundred Pound to a Friend to prevent its being seiz'd on by  the Crown which was redeem'd by the Captain by my Father's Appointment when he came to see him last I paid him his five hundred Pound and wou'd have given him Interest for it but he wou'd not accept of it but advis'd me to part with it without I design'd to settle in  England  which I thought was the best way whether I staid in  England  or not The Captain undertook the Matter and sold it for four Thousand Pound But whilst he was busie about it I got Mr  Musgrave  who was always my bosom Friend to go to  Hereford  and if it 'twere possible to find where my dear Father was bury'd and to see how Matters stood there Accordingly we hir'd a couple of Horses and set out when we arriv'd at  Hereford  we found it not a little difficult but at last thro' the means of one Mr  Hall  Organist of the Cathedral Church we had sight of the Place which was about half a Mile from the City Mr  Hall  came by the knowledge of it by the means of an honest Clergyman that my Father had contracted a Friendship with before that unhappy Accident befell him that depriv'd him  of his Life He brought us to his House where the Gentleman was laid up with a fit of the Gout as soon as we were private I let him know who I was upon which he tenderly Embrac'd me and was mightily joy'd to see the Son of his late Friend Says he I shou'd have been at  Bristol  e're now but that the Gout prevented me Your Father was a Man I had but a short Acquaintance with yet that little time discover'd him to be a Man of Integrity Honesty and Honour When He was upon his death Bed he told me his real Name and Circumstances and what Misfortunes had brought him to this Part he told me also that he had a Son at Sea and beg'd of me to dispose of his little Fortune he had here and see it put into the Hands of Captain  Pultney  of  Bristol  which I had done but was prevented as I said before by this sudden Fit of the Gout I have taken care of all your Father's Effects and the little Farm I have bought my self it being for my turn Upon that he sent his Maid for a little Box which he unlock'd and told me out two hundred Guineas this  is what your Father left in ready Money behind him His Farm c I rate at two hundred and fifty pound more there are the Writings and there is the Money By the Writings I saw it cost my Father but two hundred Pound as for his Apparel and other little necessaries I gave them by his Order to a Maid Servant and a Man that he hir'd and for his Goods there is but few nor have we made an Estimate of them but if you'll have them Prais'd I will give something more than what they are valu'd at being I wou'd willingly have them along with the House Says I neither shall they be parted and if you please to except of them be they what the will you shall be heartily welcome He refus'd them obstinately but I prevail'd with him to take them with much ado he also gave me a Ring which I priz'd mightily because it had been my Father's from his Infancy given him by my Grandfather When he had settl'd every thing I went to see the Place where my Father's Bones were laid which fill'd me with such awful Sorrow that I cou'd not refrain from Weeping  in spight of my Resolution to the contrary I wou'd have Erected a Tomb or Monument for him but it was his last Request that he might be Bury'd as obscurely as he did design to live there  After parting with my Father's Grave with a load of Sorrow we took leave of my Friend the Parson and Mr  Hall  and rode for  Bristol  again but were overtaken about six Miles from  Hereford  by three Gentlemen of the Pad that had got some notice of the Booty they shou'd gain if they cou'd Rob us for I was so Inadvertent as to put all my Money into my Bags which I wore before me at my Saddle they past us first but looking wishfully upon us gave us some suspicion of what they were Mr  Musgrave  advis'd me to ride back again and stay still we had more Company but I told him they wou'd soon overtake us and seeing us fearful wou'd make them more Resolute so I rather chose to face them for we observ'd they were returning to meet us We resolv'd to be before hand with them and we drew out our Pistols ready and if they offer'd to come too near us to begin  with them As soon as they came within Yards of us I call'd to them and ask'd them what they wanted if it was our Money they shou'd first take our Lives they answer'd they had no such Intention Than what is your Reason of passing us first and then meeting us again They answer'd one of their Companions in lighting to ease himself below the Hill had drop'd his Watch and they were returning to find it if they cou'd Why then pass by in the Name of God says I and accordingly they did but we were cautious of letting them come too near us as soon as they were past us we set Spurs to our Horses and got over the Heath before we look'd behind us but riding leasurely thro' the Village we saw them coming after a full Gallop Now we repented we had not stay'd in the Village but we resolv'd as before to encounter them if they Assaulted us The soon overtook us and coming even with us told us their Companion had found his Watch which he pull'd out and show'd us They said they cou'd not blame us in taking them for HighwayMen  but they assur'd us they were Travellers as we were and were going to  Worcester  We did not make any Words with them but rode along with them indeed because we cou'd not help it They rode with us for about a Mile and then the Road going narrow one of them pretending to go foremost seiz'd hold of my Bridle with the Surprize my Horse being a very good one rose up an end and he discharging his Pistol the Ball graz'd upon my CloakBag and did not do any farther Damage Upon this I fir'd one of my Pistols but miss'd him but I threw it at him with all my force which hit him on the Head so full that he stagger'd a little and fell from his Horse The other discharg'd a PocketPistol at me and Wounded me slightly in the left Shoulder but going to discharge another I set Spurs to my Horse and had the good Fortune to snatch it from him but in the bustle between us it went off and shot the other HighwayMan's Horse in the Head which so enrag'd him that he ran away with him in spight of all he cou'd to stop him Mr  Musgrave  who engag'd with him follow'd him but considering he had left me with two return'd again and in very good time for the other Fellow that I had knock'd down with my Pistol had got up again and had just caught his Horse that was grazing under the Hedge His other Companion that I had taken the Pistol from had▪ drawn a broad cutting Sword and was laying at me I by good Fortune had before me a great Coat for fear of Rain and the ball of his Pistol had broke the Strap so that I wrap'd it round my left Arm and receiv'd his Blow which did me no damage and in the mean time thrust my Sword into his Side up to the Hilt which nevertheless did not kill him But he call'd to his Companion come  Harry  let's make off for by Gd I believe I'm kill'd Accordingly they fled as fast as ever they cou'd back again the way we came with my Sword in his Breast for when he receiv'd the Wound he turn'd so short with his Horse that wrung the Hilt out of my Hand Mr  Musgrave  was for following them but I found some pain in my  Shoulder and it began to grow stiff being cold and chose to go on but in our riding and talking of the late Accident we lost our Road and had taken that which had led to  Gloster  and riding on we met the third Highwayman whose Horse had run away with him who was coming back as we suppos'd to see how Things went As soon as ever he saw us he turn'd his Horse and rid away as hard as ever he cou'd and we rid as fast after him it being as we thought our Road we follow'd him through several Villages and we call'd to the People to stop him but to no purpose at last his Horse stumbled which gave us time to come pretty near him when he found he cou'd not escape us he turn'd about and discharg'd a Pistol at us I had one Pistol that I had not fir'd yet which I drew from the Housing and let fly at him and wounded him in the Neck he fled as fast as he cou'd and our Horses beginning to tire he got out of our sight we ask'd several People we met whether they had seen any such Person and they told us he was gon into  Gloster  Town e're  then we follow'd and got into  Gloster  immediately and were told such a Man was seen to ride through the Town so we pursu'd him no farther our Horses being very much tir'd but they sent a HueandCry after him but to no purpose for they return'd no wiser than they went out We stay'd at  Gloster  two Days to have my Wound dress'd and then rode to  Bristol  where all our Friends waited impatiently for us being we had exceeded our Time three Days after having settled my Money in the Hands of People that the Captain appointed to Improve it for me I resolv'd to make a Trip to  Ireland  to see my Sister that was marry'd very well to a Merchant there But hearing of the Grand Fleet making Preparation for some Expedition put us all agog and my natural Genius for Travel made me once more resolve to be Gadding I open'd my Mind to Captain  Pultney  who advis'd me to the contrary but I told him I was so much concern'd for my Father's Death as indeed I was that I shou'd sooner wear it off at Sea than on Shore being here every Object that I saw put me in  mind of Him He was very well satisfy'd with my Reasons at last but says He I wou'd not have you go in any Post but as a Voluntier that you may not be confin'd to stay longer than you shou'd desire I thought this the best way therefore resolv'd for  London  with all my Companions and get us a Ship I had Letters of Recommendations to Secretary  Burchet  and several Gentlemen that had the Management of the  Navy  We arriv'd at  London February  the  th  Mr  Musgrave  and I enter'd on Board the  Breda  Captain  Fog  Commander because we were inform'd Admiral  Benbow  wou'd hoist his Flag in that Ship Mr  Musgrave  having formerly had some Acquaintance with the Admiral waited on him and had a Warrant for a QuarterMaster given him The rest of our Companions enter'd before the Mast that is Common Sailors in the same Ship  Hood  was soon made Cook's Mate and the rest of 'em got some little Office that rais'd 'em something above the Common Sailors tho' they enter'd as such and all by the means of Mr  Musgrave  who acquainted the Admiral with their Fortunes When  we had sent all our Things on Board and not knowing when they wou'd Sail Mr  Musgrave  and I got leave to go to  Portsmouth  by Land where we arriv'd on  Saturday March  the  d  and stay'd there till the  English  and  Dutch  Fleet arriv'd A Squadron was order'd out to Cruise of which our Ship was one but an unlucky Accident hinder'd my going with her but Mr  Musgrave  was forc'd to go against his Inclinations and leave me behind him which was as follows One Evening coming from seeing a Play at the Bull's Head a Gentleman coming out with a Lady the Croud by chance jostled me against the Lady which this Gentleman Mr  Martin  Nephew to  Johnny Gibson  Governor of the Place took as an Affront put upon him being he had the Care of the Lady but I begg'd her Pardon and told her it was an Accident I cou'd not help but he being in a strange Passion call'd me several genteel Names as Rogue Rascal and such like and struck me over the Head with his Cane tho' I did not much mind his Words I did not care to take his Blows without a Return which I did with  Interest and we were soon parted But an Hour after being at the aforesaid  BullHead  at Supper the Drawer came up and told us There was a Gentleman below desir'd to speak one Word to Mr  Falconer  there was one Mr  Langley  Lieutenant to the  Windsor  Man of War that I had made an acquaintance with at the Play that promis'd to come and sup with us and I took the Message to come from him but was surpriz'd to find it the Gentleman that I had the Bustle with He wanted to drink a Glass of Wine withme He said and led me into a Room when we were there he told me he came for Satisfaction of the Affront I put upon him about an Hour ago therefore draw added he or I'll run you through I endeavour'd to pacify him with good Words yet all to no purpose he made so many Thrusts at me that I was in danger of my Life but at last I disarm'd him but not without a little Wound in my Arm As soon as I gave him his Sword again he push'd at me with all the Malice imaginable and hearing the People from all Parts of the House coming to see what was the Matter  he clap'd his Back against the Door to keep 'em out which They on the other side broke open and giving him a push his Breast ran against the point of my Sword which appear'd at his Back and he fell down without any sign of Life The People coming in I was immediately secur'd and carry'd to Prison till they knew whether he wou'd live or die I was mightily concern'd not from any Danger was to be fear'd but that it wou'd be a hindrance to my Voyage The Gentleman continu'd in a violent Fever a great while and his Life was despair'd of but at last after a tedious Illness recover'd but continu'd weak One Day he came to visit me in a Chair where I was confin'd and told me He was very sorry for what had happen'd and that to day I shou'd be at liberty and accordingly came an Order in the Afternoon for my Freedom without paying any Fees But to my great Grief the Fleet was sail'd and  Benbow  's Squadron design'd for the  Indies  But Mr  Martin  beg'd me to be patient and he wou'd procure me a Passage in a StoreShip that  wou'd sail in a Week at farthest for  Jamaica  and he was as good as his Word for the next Day he carry'd me to Captain  Young  Commander of the  Tyger  StoreShip and enter'd me immediately Then my Heart began to be at Rest and I gave him Thanks and for the time we stay'd there Mr  Martin  and I were very intimate and he express'd himself so genteelly about our former Encounter that he gain'd my Esteem  Passion indeed is certainly a Madness and therefore what is done in that Heat ought to be forgot if the Person themselves repent of it But how humane it wou'd be if in the midst of that Fire of Passion which blazes out they cou'd sprinkle the cool Water of Reason and quench it For nothing more deforms the Mind or Body than Passion and 'tis then we lose our humane Form and are metamorphos'd into Beasts How many great and good Men have done such things in Passion that they have repented of all their Lives after Therefore Passion may be well term'd a Pilfering Devil that steals away our Senses and prompts us  to do Actions unbecoming the Form we bear  We set Sail from  Spithead May  the  th  and our Captain gave us hopes of overtaking the Fleet by reason he said one Ship cou'd make better way than a whole Fleet being they were oblig'd to wait for one another We met with nothing extraordinary but a Storm that drove us almost upon the Island  Madera▪  which being so nigh our Captain resolv'd to Anchor at and accordingly we did in the Bay of the City of  Funzal  the Capitol of the Place Captain  Young  and I went on Shore to view the Town  Funzal  the Capitol of this Island is a large handsome City with one Cathedral and four other Churches all neatly Built two Cloisters one for the Men and the other for the Women The City contains Houses There is also computed to be upon this Island Inhabitants I bought a  Portugueze  Book here that gives a better Account of the first Discovery of this Island than any I have seen extant which Mr  Musgrave  translated for me in  English  I have seen it in  French  since but not truly translated being there was something left out concerning King  Edward  the Third that conquer'd  France  And as the Honour belongs to the  English  as the first Inhabitants I shall here give it you faithfully translated It being but short I hope it will not be found tedious For in all my Voyages I avoid prolixity as being offensive to all Readers and the Places I describe are generally such as are not frequented by the  English  it being my fortune to be carry'd there  THE HISTORY OF THE Discovery of the Island of MADERA  Written Originally in  Portugueze  by  Don Francisco de Alcafarado  and Translated into  English  by  W Musgrave  Native of  Jamaica  WHEN  England  was settled in a lasting Peace after the Turmoils and Hazard of a dangegerous War King  Edward  the Third who conquer'd  France  and fix'd his Royal Standard in the City of  Paris  He who had felt the Inconveniences of War knew how to encourage the Pleasures of Peace and  London  the Metropolitan City of the Kingdom became the Seat of Mirth and  Jollity All thoughts of War were banish'd the Ensigns now were furl'd and Swords were wore for Ornament not Use Among the rest that embellish'd the Court was one  Lionel Machin  the youngest Brother of a noble Family and consequently not overrich yet a Gentleman which often happens in younger Brothers that was reckon'd the only Ornament of the Root from whence he sprung This Gentleman fell desperately in Love with a Lady beautiful to Perfection and the only Boast of her Time But there was a vast Disparity in their Fortunes for she was the only Daughter to a Nobleman whose Riches exceeded most of his Rank and consequently courted by those that cou'd make her a Joynture equal to the Fortune her Father wou'd give her But nevertheless the Force of Love is such that it never minds Interest nor Duty and the young Lady whose Name was  Arabella  was so much taken with the winning Behaviour of  Lionel  that she plac'd her entire Affection upon him who was indeed bating his slender Means the most deserving of her But the Parents  of  Arabella  hearing of the Amity that was between 'em complain'd to King  Edward  and beg'd that he wou'd interpose his Royal Authority The King us'd many Perswasions to  Lionel  to withdraw his Affections but it was like bidding the Sun stand still or the Wind or Rain to cease for their Affections were so strongly united that nothing cou'd ever part 'em The Father having provided a fit Match for his Daughter intreated the King to secure  Lionel  till the Marriage was solemniz'd who granted his Request and clapt  Lionel  in Prison under pretence of some treasonable Practices When immediately the MarriageRites were perform'd and  Arabella  was constrain'd to give her Hand where it was not in her Power to give her Heart and Parents are to blame to force their Children to marry against their Inclinations being from thence springs such Disorders in Families that is not in their Power to compose As soon as the Ceremony was over the Husband carry'd his Lady to a Palace seated upon the River  Severn  near  Bristol  When done  Lionel  was releas'd out of Prison  but with a heavy Heart for the Loss of his dear  Arabella  But still his Love encreas'd from the Difficulties he found to obtain his Desire and knowing it impossible to live without her thought of a Stratagem that gave him hopes of conquering all Difficulties He summon'd about Thirty young Gentlemen all Resolute Bold and fit for any Undertaking▪ When he had got 'em all together he made this short Oration to 'em  Most here are my Relations or what's a nearer Tye my Bosomfriends You all know the Indignity I have suffer'd by  Arabella  's forc'd Marriage therefore I require you all to assist me in whatever I shall undertake without tainting your Honour to be Reveng'd for the Affront put upon me To this Request they all agreed to serve him with their Lives and Fortunes  Whereupon it was resolv'd to part and take several ways to  Bristol  When they all arriv'd at their Place of Rendezvous they consulted together and resolv'd to  seize any Ship in the River that they found was fit for their turn  Lionel  thought nothing difficult when Love was to be the Reward but now he wanted some means to let  Arabella  know their Design But at last it was agreed that one of their Company shou'd enter into the Service of the Husband which fell out as they cou'd wish and a proper Person was hir'd to be Groom where he had the care of a fine spotted Horse that us'd to carry the Lady abroad to visit her Neighbours The Wind proving fair notice was given that the Project was to be put in Execution the pretended Groom to favour the Business had omitted giving  Arabella  's Horse any Water When  Arabella  had notice of the Hour she ordered her spotted Horse to be Sadled under pretence of taking the Air attended with her Groom and two more of her Domesticks When they came near the Cape of Land where  Lionel  and his Companions waited for Her the Horse by beating of the Waves against the Shore heard and smelt the Water and made down to it to Drink where  Lionel  immediately lay'd hold of the Lady who  seem'd to be mightily frighten'd and put her in their Boat and made off Now the Day that they had seiz'd the Lady was also pitch'd on to seize the Ship they had a design upon which was easily done being their Crew were most of them a Shore They cut her Cables and made off to Sea withal the Sail they cou'd bear and soon got out of sight and directed their Course for  France  but a Storm met them and drove them quite contrary  Lionel  's Friends now began to Repent of their Undertaking and  Lionel  was mightily concern'd for the Danger of Her he Lov'd more dear than Life who tho' mightily disorder'd with the Sea yet seem'd contented in having the Object of her Desire with Her Thirty Days they were the sport of the Waves every Day expecting Death but one Morning they discover'd Land high craggy and very Woody which fill'd them with Joy more especially  Lionel  for now he hop'd a resting Place for his dear  Arabella  None in the Ship could guess what Land it cou'd be for they knew it was not Inhabited being Birds of all sorts  were so tame that they would suffer themselves to be taken with the Hand The Place they chose for their Habitations was a fine Grove of LaurelTrees that were very delightful as was also every part of the Country they had rambled over Finding they were to stay there a great while they got out of their Ship several Necessaries and liv'd very pleasant for about Days designing to commit themselves in a Day or two to the mercy of the Waves for tho' the Island was delightful to live in yet it seem'd tiresome to those that wanted many things they enjoy'd in their own Country  The Night before they design'd to Embark a violent Storm rose and drove the Ship from the Island with about Men that were preparing all things for Sailing the next Day These were tost by the Winds and Sea for many Days but at last to their great Joy discover'd Land where they ran their Ship on Shore being she was so leaky she could hardly Swim But their Joy for being sav'd from the watry Element  soon chang'd to Sorrow when they found themselves taken by the  Moors  they being Landed on the Coast of  Africk  Their new Masters after hard usage arriv'd at the City of  Morocco  with their Purchase where they sold them in the Market like  Cows  or  Oxen  but all declaring they were Men of Rank they were Imprison'd in hopes of large Ransoms  When  Lionel  and  Arabella  and the rest that were left on Shore discover'd the next Morning their fatal Disaster Grief siez'd them with such a force that some of them lost their Senses running Frantick up and down the Woods and raving kill'd themselves Poor  Arabella  's Grief sunk inward and prey'd upon her Life with such Violence that Death appear'd to her Rescue She never upbraided  Linel  with her Misfortunes but clos'd her Eyes with a true Repentance of her failings  Lionel  was like a distracted Man lay'd himself down at her Feet and cou'd not be remov'd till Death gave him his Release His Companions bury'd them together in one Grave and at the Foot Erected  a Cross to shew those that were Interr'd there dy'd under the Banner of Christ Upon the Bark of the Tree they cut in Letters the whole Story of their Misfortunes The rest that remain'd upon the Island propos'd to themselves of venturing into their Boat which by good Fortune was left on Shore and steer'd their Course to the nighest main Land where they happily arriv'd without Danger but ran the same Fate with their other Companions that were thrown on the same Coast in the Ship that they all thought was cast away All the comfort they receiv'd in their Misfortunes was that they were committed to the same Prison that their Companions were in They were over Joy'd to find those alive that were thought dead but mourn'd to think of meeting in such a melancholly Place In the same Prison was one  Juan de Morales  a noted Pilot and an excellent Navigator this Man was mightily pleas'd with the Tales of these  English  Gentlemen and so often beg'd them to repeat their Adventures that he had every Mark of the Island exact and perfectly  saw it in immagination In the Year  Don Sancho  Son to  Ferdinand  King of  Arragon  dy'd in  Castile  and left considerable Sums of Money to redeem  Spanish  Prisoners that were Captive in  Barbary  among the rest was  Juan de Morales  and at the same time the  English  Gentlemen got their Ransom and safely arriv'd in their own Country with a Pardon for their Offence from the King of  England  and the Husband of  Arabella Morales  and all his Ship's Crew were taken by the  Portugals  who met with 'em cruising in those Seas but all excepting  Morales  had their Liberty given them who was detain'd for his Knowledge in the Mathematicks and Promises were made him of great Recompence if he wou'd serve King  John  of  Portugal  in his Discoveries  As soon as they were arriv'd at  Lisbon Morales  was presented to the King by  Don Henry  the  Infant  who was a great encourager to new Discoveries where he open'd the whole Story of  Lionel  and  Arabella  Which was so generally receiv'd that a Fleet was order'd immediately for this new Voyage and  June  the  d    set out to Sea well Arm'd They design'd first for  Porto Sancto  as being nigh the Island as  Morales  conjectur'd the  English  abandon'd  When they arriv'd there the Inhabitants advis'd them not to go any farther in their Discoveries towards the N E being there was a black Cloud which wou'd terminate their Navigation because there was not any one that ever attempted it but lost their Lives for their Presumption and were never heard of more Notwithstanding  Gonsalvo  the Admiral and  Morales  the Pilot were well assur'd that very Cloud was the Island they wanted to find they were the more convinc'd in it by reason the Cloud continu'd of the same colour thro' every Change of the Moon But the rest of the Ship's Crew were of the contrary Opinion and Mutiniz'd against  Morales  telling him that he being a  Castilian  an consequently their Enemy did it to Disgrace them and that it was a Presumptious thing to pretend to search into the Secrets of Providence  Notwithstanding their grumblings they set Sail from  Porto Sancto  and made forward  for their Discovery but the nearer they approach'd this Cloud the more frightful it grew which caus'd a terrible fear in all the Sailors intreating  Gonsales  to return and not to be the Death of so many innocent People But still they held their Course for all their Clamours yet  Gonsales  to encourage the Sailors assur'd 'em it must be firm Land and to dissipate their Fears made 'em this following Oration  Why shou'd I be more hardy than you but that I am confirm'd it is as I tell you If there shou'd be any Danger have I any Means to extricate my self more than your selves Is not my Life as precious to me as any of yours my Companions A Foolhardiness does not become us it's true but a firm Courage is what all Men shou'd be endu'd with Every Person here has ventur'd his Life for his King▪ in Battle before now without half the Recompence or Honour that will be gain'd by this Expedition if we succeed as we certainly shall if we arm our selves with Resolution to overcome all Difficulties Banish  your Fears and call your Reason to your Aid and let us proceed in the Name and for the Honour of God and our King  They proceeded chearfully animated by this Oration and in a little time enter'd the Cloud or settled Fog but the Tide driving the Vessel too far North they put out their Boats to Tow their Ship in the midst of the Cloud but the farther they Row'd the Cloud seem'd to decrease and presently after they discover'd Land to their great Joy being it was what but few of them expected The first Cape they discover'd was call'd by  Gonsales  Cape St  Lawrence  which they doubled and saw a fine and fertile Country full of fair and lofty Trees that made the prospect Delightful Sailing on they discover'd a large Bay which  Morales  judg'd to be the Place where the  English  were thrown but it being late  Gonsales  order'd to let fall the Anchors not caring to Land till they had the whole Day before them The next Morning they Landed and found it to be the same Place where  Lionel Machin  and  Arabella  were Bury'd  When they had given account to the Admiral of the State of Things He Landed and took Possession of the Island for his Master  John  the First King of  Portugal  They erected an Altar upon the Tomb of the two Lovers said Mass and return'd God thanks for their happy Success  Gonsales  term'd the Island  Madera  from the quantity of its Wood which in the  Portugueze  Language signifies Woody that was found all over the Island but no humane Inhabitants  After they had search'd well on Shore Boats were order'd to Row round the Island being it was dangerous for their Ship by reason of many Rocks and Shallows that lay in the Water So steering West they discover'd four fine small Rivers running into the Sea the Water being extreamly clear  Gonsales  order'd some to be bottled to present to the King of  Portugal  his Master at his Return  Going farther several Soldiers were Landed in a Valley which was water'd by a fine River and a noble Grove of Trees that made a perfect Harbour where  Gonsales  erected a large Cross  Sailing on they came to a Point of Land that ran a great way into the Sea which was inhabited by such a Number of great different Birds that the Men were afraid of being devour'd by 'em This Place was nam'd  Punta des Gralhos  from the large Number of Birds  Going forward they discover'd a Valley cover'd with fine large CedarTrees next to that they found another large one where was a great Lake or Pond from whence they cou'd perceive the Bay they set out from With searching the Country they discover'd a large Plain which overlook'd the rest of the Island free from Trees but cover'd over with a beautiful Fennal call'd by the Portugueze  Funchall  Upon this Plain they built a City and call'd it  Funchall  from the quantity of Fennel that was found there which was formerly a Bishop's See but is still the chief Place for Temporal Affairs  From this Plain runs three Rivers into the Sea which form an Island and Landlock the Haven secure from Storms and Tempests  Gonsales  still sent out more Men for Discoveries in the Island where they found a white Rock call'd by the Portugueze  Praya Formosa  or the Fair Rock below which was a fierce Torrent of Water so clear that oblig'd 'em all to observe it Two resolute Soldiers pull'd off their Cloaths and attempted to swim across the Stream but were hurry'd away with the Current in such an impetuous manner that they had perish'd if they had not been timely succour'd by their Companions by Ropes which they threw in and pull'd 'em up against the Violence of the Stream This Torrent they nam'd  Soccorides  The most remarkable Thing they found in their Voyage was a great Number of SeaWolves which rush'd out of a Cave into the Water when they approach'd 'em  Gonsales  gather'd all Sorts of Plants Roots Flowers and Minerals together with all Sorts of Birds and a large Parcel of the Earth and imbark'd for  Portugal  where he safely arriv'd  August  the  d  The same Year where he was receiv'd with all the favour imaginable  In  May    Gonsales  was made Governor of the whole Island with an additional Title of  Count  and in the same Month set Sail with his Wife and two Daughters and many more for the Inhabiting the same where he happily arriv'd and laid the Foundation for the present Capitol of  Funchal  or  Funzal  but to Honour  Lionel Machin  who was there interr'd he call'd the Place  Porto Machino  and over the Grave he erected a noble Church Some Writers relate that  Gonsales  set the Woods on fire that continued burning for seven Years which made Wood scarce in that Island but there is such Plenty of all Sorts that I look upon that Story but as a Fable The Island daily increas'd in its Inhabitants till it came to the now flourishing State it remains in  Madera  is situated in thirty Degrees and thirtyone Minutes In Circumference and about forty Leagues twelve in Length about two Broad The Air so temperate that neither Heat nor Cold is troublesome and the Soil so fertile that it yields more Corn for the Bigness of the Place than  any other Island as large again The Grass shoots up so high that they are oblig'd to burn it and in the Ashes they plant SugarCanes which in six Months time produce Sugar The Inhabitants are more civiliz'd than any of the  Canary  Islands  After we had made an End of our Affairs we set Sail from thence and directed our Course for  Teneriff  one of the  Canary  Islands or the  Insulae Fortunatae  of  Ptolomy  where we safely arriv'd▪ This Island lies in twentyseven Degrees and thirty Minutes about fourteen Leagues in length  Sancta Cruze  the Place where we Anchor'd is the chief Harbour It is an Island very well inhabited containing three Cities or large Towns besides a great Number of Villages But what it's fam'd most for is the  Pike  or high Mountain that rears its Head above the Clouds and seems to scale even Heaven it self I have seen many People that have told me they have been at the Top of this Mountain But none give so good a Description of it and even the whole Island as the Right Reverend Dr  Sprat  in his  History of the Royal Society  which is as follows  Having furnish'd our selves with a Guide Servants and Horses to carry our Wine and Provision we set forth from  Oratava  a PortTown in the Island of  Teneriff  situated on the Northside two Miles distant from the Main Sea and travell'd from twelve at Night till eight in the Morning by which time we got to the Top of the first Mountain towards the  Pico de Terraira  There under a very large and conspicuous PineTree we took our Breakfast Din'd and refresh'd our selves till Two in the Afternoon Then we pass'd through many sandy Ways over many lofty Mountains but naked and bare and not cover'd with any PineTrees as our first Night's Passage was This expos'd us to excessive Heat till we arriv'd at the Foot of the  Pico  where we found many huge Stones which seem'd to have fall'n from some upper Part About six in the Evening we began to ascend the  Pico  but we were scarce advanc'd a Mile and the Way being no more passable for Horses we left them with our Servants In the  Ascent of one Mile some of our Company grew very faint and sick disorder'd by Fluxes Vomitings and Aguish Distempers our Horse's Hairs standing upright like Bristles and calling for some of our Wine carry'd on small Barrels on a Horse we found it so wonderfully cold that we cou'd not drink it till we had made a Fire to warm it notwithstanding the Air was very calm and moderate But when the Sun was set it began to blow with such Violence and grew so cold that taking up our Lodging amongst the hollow Rocks we were necessitated to keep great Fires in the Mouths of 'em all Night About Four in the Morning we began to mount again and being come another Mile up one of our Company fail'd and was not able to proceed any farther Here began the black Rocks The rest of us pursu'd our Journey till we came to the SugarLoaf where we began to travel again in a White Sand being fitted with Shooes whose single Soles are made a Finger broader than the upper Leather to encounter this difficult Passage Having  ascended as far as the black Rocks which lay all flat like a plain Floor We climb'd within a Mile of the very Top of the  Pico  and at last we gain'd the Summit where we found no such Smoak as appear'd a little below but a continual Perspiration of a hot and sulphurous Vapor that made our Faces extreamly sore All this way we found no considerable Alteration of the Air and very little Wind but on the Top it was so impetuous that we had much ado to stand against it whilst we drank the King's Health and fired each of us a Piece Here also we took our Dinner but found that our StrongWaters had lost their Virtue and were almost insipid while our Wine was more spirituous and brisk than before The Top on which we stood being not above a Yard broad is the brink of a Pit call'd the  Caldera  which we judg'd to be a MusketShot over and near fourscore Yards deep in form of a  Cone  hollow within like a  Kettle  and cover'd with small loose Stones mix'd with Sulphure and Sand from among which issu'd divers Spiracles  of Smoak and Heat which being stirr'd with any thing puffs and makes a Noise and so offensive that we were almost suffocated with the sudden Emanation of Vapours upon the removing one of these Stones which were so hot as not easily to be handled We descended not above four or five Yards into the  Caldera  because of the slipperiness under foot and the difficulty but some have adventured to the Bottom Other Matters observable we discover'd none besides a clear sort of Sulphur which lay like Salt upon the Stones From this renown'd  Pico  we cou'd see the  Grand Canaries  Leagues distant  Palma  and  Gomera  which interval of Sea seem'd not much wider than the  Thames  about  London  We discern'd also the  Herro  being distant about Leagues and so to the utmost Limits of the Sea much farther As soon as the Sun appear'd the shadow of the  Pico  seem'd to cover not only the whole Island and the  Grand Canaries  but the Sea to the very Horizon where the top of the  SugarLoaf  or  Pico  visibly appear'd to turn up and cast its shade into the Air itself at which we were much surpriz'd but the Sun was not far Ascended when the Clouds began to rise so fast as that they intercepted our Prospect both of the Sea and the whole Island except the tops only of the subjacent Mountains which seem'd to pierce them thro' Whether these Clouds do ever surmount the  Pico  we can't say but to such as are far below they seem sometimes to hang above it or rather wrap themselves about it as constantly when the West Winds blow this they call the  Cap  and is the infallible Prognostick of insuing Storms One of our Company who made this Journey agen two Years after arriving at the top of the  Pico  before Day and creeping under a great Stone to shroud himself from the cold Air after a little space found himself all wet and perceiv'd it to come from a perpetual trickling of Water from the Rocks above him Many excellent and exuberant Springs we found issuing from the tops of most of the other  Mountains gushing out in great Spouts almost as far as the huge  Pinetree  which we mention'd before Having stay'd a while at the top we all descended the sandy Way till we came to the foot of the  SugarLoaf  which being steep even almost to a perpendicular we soon pass'd and here we met with a Cave about Yards deep and broad being in shape like an Oven or  Cupola  having a hole at the top near Yards over This we descended by a Rope that our Servants held fast at the top while with the other end being fastned about our middles we swung our selves till being over a Bank of  Snow  we slid down lighting upon it we were forc'd to swing thus in our descent because in the midst of the bottom of this Cave opposite to the overture at the top is a round Pit of Water like a Well the Surface whereof is about a Yard lower but as wide as the Mouth at top and about six Fathom deep We suppos'd this Water not a Spring but dissolved  Snow  blown in or Water trickling  thro' the Rocks About the sides of the Grot for some height there is Ice and Icicles hanging down to the  Snow  But being quickly weary of this excessive cold Place and drawn up again we continu'd our Descent from the Mountains by the same Passage we went up the Day before and so about five in the Evening arriv'd at  Orotava  from whence we set forth our Faces so red and sore that to coll 'em we were forc'd to wash and bath them in whites of Eggs The whole height of the  Pico  in Perpendicular is vulgarly esteem'd to be two Miles and a half no Trees Herbs nor Shrubs did we find in all the Passage but  Pines  and among the whiter Sands a kind of  Broom  being a bushy Plant and on that side where we lay all Night a kind of  Coalon  which had stems eight Foot high and the Trunk near a Foot thick every stem growing in four Squares and emerging from the Ground like tuffs of Rushes upon the edges of these Stems grow very small red Buttons or Berries which being squeez'd produce a  poisonous Milk which falling upon any part of a Horse or other Beast fetches off all the Hair from the Skin immediately of the withered Sticks of this Vegetable we made our Fire all Night This Plant is also universally spread over the Island and is perhaps a kind of  Euphorbium  Of the Island  Teneriff  it self this Account was given by a Judicious and Ingenious Man who liv'd twenty Years in it as a Physician and Merchant his Opinion is that the whole Island being a Soil mightily impregnated with Brimstone did in former Times take Fire and blow up all or near all at the same time and that many Mountains of huge Stone calcin'd and burnt which appears all over this Island especially in the SouthWest part of it were cast up and rais'd out of the Bowels of the Earth at the time of that General Conflagration and that the greatest Quantity of this Sulphur lying about the Centre of the Island rais'd up the  Pico  to that heighth at which it is now seen and he says▪  that any one upon the Place that shall carefully Note the Situation and Manner of those calcin'd Rocks how they lie will easily be of that Mind for they lie says he three or four Miles almost round the bottom of the  Pico  and in such Order one above another almost to the  SugarLoaf  as it is call'd as if the whole Ground swelling and rising up together by the Ascention of the Brimstone the Torrents and Rivers of it did with a sudden Eruption rowl and tumble them down from the rest of the Rocks especially as is said before to the SouthWest for on that side from the very top of the  Pico  almost to the Sea Coast lie huge heaps of these burnt Rocks one under another and there still remain the very Tracts of the Brimstone Rivers as they run over this Quarter of the Island which has so wasted the Ground beyond recovery that nothing can be made to grow there but  Broom  But on the Northside of the  Pico  few or none of these Stones appear'd and hence he concludes that  the  Vulcanio  discharg'd it self chiefly on the SouthWest side He adds farther that at the same time Mines of several Mettles were blown up some of those calcin'd Rocks resembling IronOar some Silver and others Copper particularly on the SouthWest Parts call'd  Azuleios  being very high Mountains where never any  Englishman  but himself that ever he heard of was There are vast quantities of a loose blewish Earth mixt with blew Stones which have a yellow rust upon 'em like that of Copper or Vitriol as also many small Springs of Vitriol Water where he supposes a Copper Mine and he was told by a Bellfounder of  Oratavia  that he got out of two Horse Loads of this Earth as much Gold as made two large Rings And a  Portugueze  who had been in the  WestIndies  told him that his Opinion was there were as good Mines of Gold and Silver there as the best in the  WestIndies  Thereabouts also are Nitrous Waters and Stones cover'd over with a deep  Saffroncolour'd rust tasting of Iron and farther he mentions one of his Friends which of two Lumps of Earth or Oar brought from the top of this side of the Mountain made two Silver Spoons All this he confirm'd by the last Instance of the  Palm  Island League from the  Teneriff  where about Years since a  Vulcanio  was fix'd the violence thereof made an Earthquake in this Island so great that he and others ran out of their Houses fearing they wou'd have fallen upon their Heads they heard the noise of the Torrent of flaming Brimstone like Thunder and saw the Fires as plain by Night for six Weeks together as a burning Torch and so much Sand and Ashes brought from thence by the Wind and Clouds fell upon his Hat as would fill the Sandbox of his Inkhorn  In some places of this Island grows a crooked Shrub call'd  Legnan  which they bring for  England  as a sweet Wood There are likewise  Apricocks Peachtrees  and others which bear  twice a Year also  Peartrees  as pregnant  Almonds  with a tender Shell  Palms Plantains Oranges  and  Lemons  especially the  Paeguadaes  which have small ones within them from whence they are so denominated Also they have  SugarCanes  and a little  Cotton Colloquintida  c The Roses blow at  Christmass  there are good  Carnations  and very large but no  Tulips  will grow or thrive there  Samphire  cloaths the Rocks in abundance and a kind of Clover the Ground Another Grass grows near the Sea which is of a broader Leaf so luscious and rank that it will kill a Horse that eats of it but no other Beast Eighty Ears of Wheat have been found to spring from one Root but grows not very high the Corn of this is transparent like the purest yellow Amber and one Bushel has brought forth a hundred in a seasonable Year  The Canary Birds which they bring to us in  England  bred in the  Baranco  's or  Gills  which the Water has fretted away in the Mountains being Places very cold There are also  Quails  Partridges  larger than ours and exceeding Beautiful great Wood  Pidgeons Turtles  at Spring  Crows  and sometimes the  Falcons  come flying over from the Coast of  Barbary  Bees are carried into the Mountains where they prosper exceedingly and there they have wild Goats which climb to the very top of the  Pico  sometimes also Hogs and multitude of Coneys  Of Fish they have the  Cherna  a very large and excellent Fish better tasted than any we have in  England  the  Mera Dolphins Lobsters  without great Claws  Mussles Periwincles  and the  Clacas  which is absolutely the very best ShellFish in the World they grow in the Rocks five or six under one great Shell thro' the top Holes whereof they peep out with their Nibs from whence the Shells being broken open a little more with a Stone the draw them there is also another sort of Fish like an  Eel  which hath six or seven Tails of a span long united to one Head and Body which is also as short besides there they have  Turtles  and  Cabrido's  which are better than our Trouts The Island is full of Springs of fresh Water tasting like Milk which in  Lalagima  where the Water is not so clear and Lympid they cleanse by percolating it through a kind of spungy Stone cut in form of a bason The Vines which afford those excellent Wines grow all about the Island within a Mile of the Sea such as are planted farther up are not much esteem'd nor will they thrive in any of the other Islands Concerning the  Guanchio's  or antient Inhabitants he gave this full account the  d  of  September  about Years since he took his Journey from  Guimar  a Town for the most part Inhabited by such as derive themselves from the antient  Guanchio  's in the Company of some of them to view their Caves and the Corps buried in them a Favour they seldom or never permit to any having the Corps of their Ancestors in great Veneration and likewise being extremely against any molestation of the Dead but he had done several Elemosinary Cures among them  for they are very poor yet the poorest think themselves too good to Marry with the best  Spaniard  which endear'd him to them exceedingly otherwise it is Death for any Stranger to visit these Caves and Bodies The Corps are sew'd up in Goats Skins with Thongs of the same with very great Curiosity particularly in the incomparable exactness and evenness of the Seams and the Skins are made very close and fit to the Corps which are for the most part entire the Eyes clos'd Hair on their Heads Ears Nose Teeth Lips and Beard all perfect only discolour'd and a little shrivled likewise the Pudenda of both Sexes He saw about three or Hundred in several Caves some of them standing others lying upon Beds of Wood so hardened by an Art they had which the  Spaniards  call  Curay  to cure a piece of Wood that no Iron can pierce or hurt it These Bodies are very light as if made of Straw and in some broken Bodies be observ'd the Nerves and Tendons and also the spring of the Veins and Arteries  very distinctly By the relation of the most antient of this Island they had a particular Tribe that had this Art only among themselves and kept as a Thing Sacred and not to be communicated to the Vulgar these mixt not themselves with the rest of the Inhabitants nor Marry'd out of their own Tribe and were also their Priests and Ministers of Religion But when the  Spaniards  Conquer'd the Place most of them were destroy'd and the Art perished with them only they held some Traditions yet of a few Ingredients that were us'd in this Business they took Butter some say they mix'd Bearsgrease with it which they kept for that purpose in the Skins wherein they boyl'd certain Herbs first a kind of wild Lavender which grows there in great Quantities upon the Rocks secondly an Herb call'd  Lara  of a very gummy and glutinous Consistence which now grows there under the tops of the Mountains thirdly a kind of  Cyclamen  or Sowbread fourthly wild Sage which grows plentifully upon this Island  these with others bruis'd and boyl'd up with Butter rendred it a perfect Balsam this prepar'd they first unbowel the Corps and in the poorer sort to save Charges took out the Brains behind after the Body was thus order'd they had in readiness a  Lixivium  made of the Bark of Pinetrees wherewith they wash'd the Body drying it in the Sun in Summer and in the Winter in a Stove this repeating very often afterwards they began their Unction both without and within drying it as before this they continued till the Balsam had penetrated into the whole Habit and the Muscle in all parts appeared through the contracted Skin and the Body become exceeding light then they sew'd them up in Goatsskins as was before mention'd The antients say that they have above twenty Caves of their Kings and great Personages with their whole Families yet unknown to any but themselves and which they will never discover Lastly he says that Bodies are found in the Caves of the Grand  Canaries  in  Sacks quite consumed and not as these in  Teneriff  Antiently when they had no knowledge of Iron they made their Lances of Wood harden'd as before memtion'd They have earthen Pots so hard that they cannot be broken Of these some are found in the Caves and old  Bavances  and us'd by the poorer People that find them to boyl Meat in Their Food is Barley parch'd and then ground with little stone Mills and mingled with Milk and Honey which they always carry with them in Goatsskins at their Backs To this Day they drink no Wine nor care for Flesh they are very ingenious lean tall active and full of Courage for they leap from Rock to Rock from a prodigious Height till they come to the bottom sometimes making ten Fathoms deep at one leap in this manner First they tertiate their Lances which are about the bigness of a half Pike and aim with the point at any piece of a Rock upon which they intend to light sometimes not half a Foot broad in leaping off they clap their Feet close  to the Launce and so carry their Bodies in the Air the point of their Launce comes first to the Place which breaks the force of their Fall then they slide gently down by the Staff and pitch with their Feet on the very place they first design'd and so from Rock to Rock till they come to the bottom but their Novices sometimes break their Necks in the learning He told also and the same was very seriously confirm'd by a  Spaniard  and another  Canary  Merchant there in the Company that they whistle so loud as to be heard five Miles off and that to be in the same Room with them when they whistle were enough to endanger the breaking the Tympanum of the Ear and added that he being in Company of one that whistled his loudest could not hear perfectly in Days after he affirms also that they throw Stones with a force almost as great as that of a Bullet and now use Stones in all their Fights as they did antiently  This Account was given to that Ingenious and Reverend Divine Dr  Sprat  Bishop of  Rochester  by some  English  Merchants who had the Curiosity to ascend the  Pico  one of the highest Mountains in the World neither cou'd I find him out in any thing but in the heighth he allows it to be but two Miles and a half but all the Inhabitants agree to make it a full League high  Captain  Young  and I attempted to ascend it but there was such a thick Fog that we were perswaded to the contrary we went up about a Quarter of a Mile but were so wet with the Fog that we had not a dry Thread about us  When we had satisfy'd our Curiosities as far as we cou'd we set Sail from  Teneriff  and made our Course for the  WestIndies  We met a  Dutch  Ship from  Batavia  that was drove by ill Weather several Degrees out of her due Course we spar'd 'em what Necessaries we cou'd being they were in great Want and took our Leaves of 'em The same Evening a Storm overtook us and drove us out of our Course but in the Night it turn'd stark Calm The next Morning we discover'd  a Galley with  Turkish  Colours out Rowing up to us with all their Strength we were all surpriz'd and amaz'd and cou'd hardly give credit to our Eyes being no one on Board us ever heard of a  Turkish  Galley so far from their own Coast but it seems we were nigher  Africk  than we suppos'd as it prov'd afterwards Our Captain told us we had nothing to do but fight it to the last for if we were taken we might be Slaves all our Lives long I advis'd our Captain to put out our Boat and tow our Ship from 'em For says I if a Wind does not rise in the mean time that we may escape 'em yet we shall gain more time to put our selves in Readiness to receive 'em when they come up with us This Advice was approv'd on and the Boat was got out immediately with six Men to Row and I oblig'd my self to go along with her to steer her right that they might Row with all their Strength We Tow'd so tightly for an Hour that we made pretty good way with our Ship but for all our Endeavours we found that in about another Hour they wou'd get up with us but we design'd to Row till they were  within a Quarter of a Mile of us and then go into the Ship again In the mean time our Men on Board had prepar'd every thing and were in good Order to receive 'em We had sixteen Guns and forty Men and Ammunition enough We were preparing to come on Board when we found they were almost up with us but our Captain advis'd me not and order'd us to have Arms in the Boat with some HandGranado's and as soon as we shou'd see 'em Engag'd to go to the contrary Side of the Enemy and fire upon 'em and by that means we shou'd amuse 'em that they wou'd not venture to Board us Immediately it was agreed and two more Men together with our Arms were put into us The Galley came up with us in an Instant and hail'd us in  English  and bid us strike our Colours immediately or it shou'd be worse for us but were answer'd by us with our Cannon instead of our Voices and we went to it Now to obey my Orders I loos'd my TowRope Row'd to get on the other Side of the Galley but was mightily surpriz'd to find their Boat out and about the Number of  twenty  Turks  getting into her our Men in the Boat advis'd immediately to return but I told 'em 'twas too late for it wou'd be worse for us if we did Nay our Captain call'd to us to come on Board but I thought they wou'd do us more Injury in getting up the Ship's side than if we stood 'em boldly which we resolv'd to do There was nine of us and we had Arms enough so before they cou'd fire at us we discharg'd our Muskets at 'em and laid our selves under the Gunnel of our Boat to charge again When we were prepar'd I order'd 'em not to stir till the  Turks  had fired and as soon as they had done so to set Fire to the Fuze of their Hand  Grando's  and throw 'em upon 'em as soon as we heard the  Turks  fire which did us no Damage we set Fire to our Hand  Granado's  as agreed upon and threw 'em in upon 'em but they suspecting something it seems order'd but half their Number to fire at first and the other half fired upon us so unluckily when we rose to discharge our  Granado's  that they kill'd three of my Men outright wounded another dangerously and my self in the  left Arm It is true our  Granado's  kill'd 'em four and wounded several but still their Number doubled ours and now they prepar'd to Board us My four Companions and my self fired upon 'em with our Pieces but cou'd not prevent 'em Boarding us yet we clubb'd our Muskets on both Sides and fell to work but a  Turk  coming behind me while I was engaging with another and struck the Cock of his Pistol into my Skull and I drop'd down for Dead but when I came to my self which was not in several Hours as I was told I found my self on Board the Galley  They had order'd a  Surgeon  to dress my Wounds which were three one in my left Arm that in my Skull and another upon the Side of my Throat which I did not feel in the receiving I was order'd to be taken particular care of for being I was not in a Sailor's Habit they thought I was something above the rest and therefore hop'd to get a considerable Sum for my Ransom The Surgeon that dress'd me was an  English  Renegado whose Name was  Matthews  The Captain was  an  Englishman  too born at  Deptford  but the vilest Wretch sure that ever breath'd There were several other  English  Renegado's on Board most of 'em profligate Wretches I understood from my Surgeon that the two Vessels parted after a desparate Engagement and the  Turks  had above fifty Men kill'd and wounded Three of my Companions were Prisoners likewise the fourth being kill'd in the last Conflict and the other expir'd in the Boat with his Wounds When I began to mend I walk'd upon Deck and look'd about me a little the other three being well had renounc'd their Saviour Jesus Christ he who dy'd for their Sins and took upon him the State of Man that he might redeem us miserable Sinners from the Curse of the Serpent What must be their Punishment who for a little Ease in this World forego their Portion of Eternal Life If the Tortures of Hell have their Degrees the last and greatest must be their Lot The Captain of the Galley order'd me one Day to be brought before him on the Deck where he told me If I did not in a Twelvemonth procure him to  the Value of Eight hundred Pound for my Ransom I shou'd be chain'd to the Oar and be a Slave all my Life it seems one of the Three that was taken with me had fold him of my Abilities and that I was possess'd of a plentiful Fortune I answer'd I would send to  England  and do my Endeavour to get that Sum but I told him it was more than I was worth and there was no hopes of so much Money for my Ransom unless my Friends wou'd out of Charity contribute towards it I added I believ'd I cou'd raise a Hundred and fifty or Two hundred Pounds But he stuck to his Text and told me He wou'd bate me nothing of that and when the Time was expir'd that he had fix'd if the Money did not come I shou'd never have my Liberty I told him I wou'd do my Endeavour to procure it for him when we came into Port and had liberty to write to my Friends in  England  The Captain did design to Cruize a Month longer that he might take some Prize to make him amends for his last Disappointment He never importun'd me to forsake my Religion being if I  had been as vile as the others he wou'd not have had any hopes of my Money to redeem me We coasted off the Shore of  Africk  a Fortnight or three Weeks but met with no Prize which enrag'd the Captain very much One Day the  Surgeon  dressing the Wound in my Head slipt into my Hand a Letter which he bid me Read cautiously and give him an Answer the next Day I had not an Opportunity for several Hours to Read the Contents at last I counterfeited a sudden Weakness and retir'd to my Cabin which was in the Place we call the  Forecastle  When I laid my self down and found no one was near me I open'd my Letter and Read the Contents to this Effect  We whose Names are subscrib'd to this have resolv'd upon a Stratagem for our Liberty there is seven of us  English  besides your self and the GalleySlaves are    in Number who have notice of the Project One of the  English  that has the Keys of the GalleySlaves Chains is also one of our Number Our Project must be put speedily in execution being they'll go into Harbour in Ten  Days and then it will be impossible to effect it We will procure Arms and give you farther Notice of the Hour We must not seem to converse together neither must you take it ill if you find we give you ill Language now and then it being only to insinuate our selves into the good Esteem of the  Turks  When we have redeem'd the Slaves we shall be Twentyeight in Number which will be a sufficient Strength to Cope with the  Turks  they being but Fortyone in all We will convey Arms into your Cabin by the means of Mr  Matthews  and we doubt not but we shall effect our Liberty under God  Sign'd  Ralph Smallwood  George Jenkins  George Kirk  William Ashton  Richard Sloan  Edward Wilkins  Anthony Matthews  After I had read it I pray'd to God to Aid us in our Design The next Day Mr  Matthews  came to dress me as before I gave him to understand that I had read and consider'd the Letter and told him my Opinion was to execute it as fast as ever we cou'd for fear of any Accident that might happen For says I it is not impossible but we may meet with one of their own Galleys and then we shall find it to be a fruitless Undertaking Says he we must wait a convenient time for if we shou'd fail we must expect the worst of Torments He went from me upon this being some of the  Turks  came to look upon my Wound The Captain ask'd him how my Hurts far'd Ah Dam him says he the Christian Dog will do well enough I warrant him So much the better answer'd the Captain for I am inform'd he is worth a great deal of Money and I shall set his Ransom at a higher Rate than what I first determin'd All this Discourse I heard being upon Deck talking with my three Companions that were taken with me who treated me with ill Language and call'd me Christian Fool that wou'd not turn  Mahometan  when I might have all the Liberty I desir'd One of them carry'd the Jest so far that he gave me two or three good Strokes with his Hand but the Captain seeing 'em said to 'em laughing Let the Fool alone 'tis not worth your while to foul your Fingers about him I said so much to 'em concerning  Mahomet  their False Prophet that if the  Turks  had understood me I might have run the Danger of being murder'd But generally the  Rengado's  that is those that forsake their Christian Faith and turn  Turks  have so little of any Religion in 'em that they laugh at those that have any at all At Night Mr  Matthews  told me in  French  very low that the next Morning early was design'd for their Enterprize being it was some Fastday with them that they usually at Four a Clock in the Morning rise and wash themselves all over and pray to their Prophet for some time and this being to be done below they thought then wou'd be the right time Accordingly all that Night they spent secretly in preparing every thing He that commanded the Slaves which was  Jenkins  found fought with 'em for something and chastiz'd 'em as usual but took the Opportunity to unlock 'em all and order'd 'em to lie still as if their Chains were fast till they had Command to do otherwise Every thing succeeded to our Wishes for the  Turks  got up to their Devotion sooner than we expected even before it was Light and hudling down together we clap'd down the Hatches and secur'd the best part of 'em The Captain with two  Englishmen  and one  Frenchman  were seiz'd in the Cabin and bound Hands and Feet and this without any Noise About Eight others that had not got up as early as the rest our GalleySlaves seiz'd and before we cou'd prevent 'em had kill'd 'em all and beg'd they might serve the Captain and the whole Crew in the same kind  The Bustle the Slaves made in killing the Eight  Turks  rouz'd the others below from their Prayers and when they found they were shut down they made a Noise and knocking to be let out which we did but first we loaded a great Gun with Musketshot and turn'd the Muzzle towards  the Scuttle Then as they came up we Bound 'em but being but few  English  we cou'd not hinder the Slaves from killing several of these too At last we bound 'em all being Twentyfive there being kill'd by the Slaves sixteen and afterwards by the Consent and Agreement of all we chain'd twenty of 'em to the Oar in the room of those we had releas'd but they began to be very stubborn at first but we put the Slaves to 'em and they soon made 'em work by giving 'em the same Usage as they generally us'd to receive from 'em  When we had secur'd 'em we return'd God thanks for our happy Success and then consulted which way we shou'd steer We  English  agreed to go for  England  but the Slaves we redeem'd being mostly  Spaniards  and  Portugueze  were for going to  Spain  in short there was no agreeing for they being the greater Number they pretended to have the Command over us never considering 'twas to us they chiefly ow'd their Liberty I must confess I was very much dissatisfy'd at their Ingratitude but cou'd not find any means to help our  selves Mr  Matthews  spoke to 'em in  Spanish  and laid before 'em the Benefit it wou'd be for 'em to go for  England  but it was like Preaching to so many Beasts for they regarded him not but resolv'd to follow their first Design of directing their Course for  Spain  When we found there was no Remedy we desir'd 'em to touch at  Lisbon  in  Portugal  and set us ashore there which they consented with much intreaty If we had been of an equal Number we wou'd have endeavour'd to have forc'd 'em with us for  England  that they might have repented their Ingratitude  They wou'd not let any of us have the Command of the Vessel but one  Velasques  a  Spaniard  was chosen Captain who immediately turn'd out Mr  Matthews  that we had given the Captain's Cabin to and took Possession of it himself This set us all a murmuring and we consulted to contrive some way to be even with 'em but they were so watchful and always upon their Guard that it was to no purpose to plot any thing They us'd to put Centinels upon us every  time we went to Rest One Night we was awaken'd out of our Sleep by Orders from our new Captain  Velasques  when we were upon Deck he told us there was a Ship discover'd to the Windward of us Now my Reason of sending for you says the Captain is We design to Attack her and make Prize of her let her be of what Nation she will excepting  Spanish  When Mr  Matthews  had told us in  English  what he said my Indignation rose that I cou'd hardly forbear rushing upon him and tear his Throat out But at last my Reason conquer'd my Passion and I became calm I bid Mr  Matthews  let him know he cou'd not expect us to fight if they were  English  our Countrymen But he swore we shou'd fight or be kill'd if they were our own Fathers I bid Mr  Matthews  tell him As for my own part I wou'd not fight a stroke let it be what Nation it wou'd and for his threatning to kill us I did not know but it wou'd be better to die than to Sociate with such an ungrateful Crew as they were The Ship now instead of keeping her Course as she did at  first made all the Sail she cou'd and bore down upon us which they did not mind in our Disputing The Captain then began to change his Tone and thought it the wisest way to steer away before the Wind and endeavour to get from 'em Whereupon he crowded away and belabour'd the poor  Turks  with his Bastinado to Row with all their Strength that I pity'd 'em Looking towards the Ship that pursu'd us we cou'd perceive  English  Colours out which rejoyc'd us  English  mightily We now consulted how we shou'd stop the Galley for with Sailing and Rowing we went faster than they At last I resolv'd to take a Pistol and shoot him through the Head let the Consequence be what it wou'd So I laid hold of one of the Pistols unperceiv'd they having prepar'd their Arms for their Engagement goes up to  Velasques  and took him by the Throat with my Lefthand and holding the Pistol to his Breast with my Right I threatn'd to shoot him Dead if he or his Men offer'd to stir Several of his Companions were running to his Assistance but were stop'd by Mr  Matthews  telling 'em if they offer'd to stir their Captain was a Dead Man This Bustle caus'd the  Turks  to lye upon their Oars and in the mean tims Mr  Sloan  brought the Gally to the Wind and lay'd by and the Ship got up with us in an Instant and without hailing us pour'd in a Broadside upon us which kill'd us two of the  Turks  and five of our  Spaniards  among which was that ungrateful Monster  Valasques  and the wind of one of the Shot threw me down upon Deck without any farther hurt we had no Colours up at all but the  Vane  upon the Topmast Head which shew'd us to be a  Turkish  Vessel I sent up  George Kirk  to take down that which prevented their Firing again upon this they haled us But after we told 'em we were  English  they sent immediately two Boats well arm'd on Board us and when we had satisfied 'em how it was with us we seiz'd upon our vile  Spaniards  and  Portuguese  and bound 'em we saw it was an  English  Man of War and upon enquiry found it was the  Ruby  Captain  Walton  Commander bound after the Fleet for  the  WestIndies  They had met with Capt  Young  and his Crew steering their Course for  England  being they were so disabled with the Engagement they had with the Gally of the  Turks  that we were in they durst not hold on their Way for the  WestIndies  So the Stores were most of 'em put on Board the  Ruby  and the rest were to follow as soon as they cou'd Ship 'em in another Vessel Now there were two Men that were Passengers in Captain  Young  's Ship put on Board the  Ruby  to pursue their Voyage and they seeing the Galley knew her to be the same that engag'd with Captain  Young  in the  Tyger  and that was the reason they fir'd upon us without hailing as is usual in those Cases  I was very glad of an Opportunity to pursue my Voyage I made my Address to Captain  Walton  who very friendly received me while we were consulting what we shou'd do about our Prisoners the Galley seem'd to lye deeper in the Water and going to examine her found a Shot had pierc'd her between Wind and Water but it was impossible to come to it to stop  it so we took what we cou'd out of her and going to unlock the GalleySlaves Chains the Key was not to be found and the Galley was sinking every Minute and before we cou'd break the Chains she sunk down right with the whole poor unfortunate  Turks  and all the  Spaniards  who being ty'd cou'd not help themselves neither had we time to give 'em any Assistance I must confess I was very much concerned to see so many poor unfortunate Creatures meet with Death when it was in our Power ten Minutes before to have sav'd 'em Captain  Walton  was realy griev'd at it and show'd a Temper full of Humanity We had just brought on Board the Captain and two more  Englishmen  with the  Frenchman Renegado's  The Captain was so sullen that he wou'd not eat or drink but intended as we suppos'd to starve himself to Death Captain  Walton  us'd all gentle means possible to bring him into Temper but to no purpose for he wou'd not so much as give any answer to what he ask'd him and in about a Week or eight Days after we took him on Board he  was found dead in his Hammock one of the  Englishmen  told us he had poison'd himself for he always said if he was ever taken by the  English  he wou'd make away with himself to prevent the punishment he shou'd undergo The other four  Englishmen  that were Instrumental in our Deliverance were all  Mahometans  in appearance as I said before that is they forsook their Christianity in outward show but were realy Christians in their Hearts as was likewise my three Companions that were taken in the Boat with me but as they told me they only did it to have some Opportunity of getting their Liberty and the Words that were us'd tho' it was in a Speech they did not understand perfectly shock'd 'em in their utterance and they all hop'd their Peace was made with God for their Crimes with a sincere Penitence from the moment they had committed it  Mr  Matthews  the  Surgeon George Jenkins William Ashton  and  Ralph Smallwood  were taken in a Ship call'd the  Two Brothers  of  Bristol  bound for  Scanderoon  after an obstinate Fight where  all were kill'd excepting the abovemention'd four who were taken and sold for Slaves and continu'd so for some Years but seizing on a Boat with the four  Frenchmen  that did design to venture for their Liberty with 'em they put to Sea and rather chose to trust in the Waves and an open Boat than stay there to be Slaves for ever But  Hamet  the Renegado whose Christian Name was  Lewis Gordon  having notice of their flight follow'd 'em with a swift Galley and got sight of 'em Mr  Matthews  who relates the Story in this manner and his Companions seeing it impossible to make their Escape thought of a Stratagem for four of 'em to get the Goodwill of the Renegado  Hamet  which was this Seeing no likelihood of getting clear off the four  English  propos'd to the  French  to cast Lots and that shou'd decide which four shou'd be bound and the other four shou'd immediately Row back as if they had no design of running away and make out their Story as well as they cou'd accordingly we drew and the Lots fell upon the four  Frenchmen  Immediately we Bound 'em and Row'd back and were soon met by the Galley where  we made our Tale good by telling the  Turks  that going a Fishing with the four  Frenchmen  they wou'd have compell'd us by force to have Row'd with 'em in their Boat for  Spain  but we being not willing fell to grappling with 'em and overcame 'em by main force ty'd 'em and were bringing 'em back The  Frenchmen  kept true to their Promise and never contradicted us in our Story  Hamet  upon this became very civil to us and put us in Trust He made me immediately Surgeon to the Galley Mr  Jenkins  Master of the Slaves and our two other Companions had some little Office that pleas'd 'em We went several Voyages with him and took many Vessels but never met with any  English  Ship before the  Tyger  that we had the desperate Engagement with The four  Frenchmen  were made Slaves to Row in another Galley which was taken about two Months ago by a  Spanish  Man of War and by that means got their Liberty  The other two  Englishmen  and  Frenchman  that were taken in the Cabin confess'd that they had been guilty of many Crimes but more especially in denying  their Saviour but they now felt in their Hearts and Minds and Earning to Repentance and beg'd that Captain  Walton  wou'd forgive 'em and not take their Recantation for a Falshood being they were in some danger but a true Light of the Divine Brightness Captain  Walton  freely forgave 'em and having a Chaplain in the Ship we rechristen'd 'em and the Fellows seem'd ever afterwards to have a true Sense of their happy Condition Captain  Walton  and my self were Godfathers for 'em all Therefore it behov'd us to see that they were now instructed in their Faith tho' these were of sufficient Years to know their Duty without Sureties for 'em We have many People that undergo that Office but never consider what their Duty is and in short make it nothing but an outward Ceremony when if they thought of it as they ought to do they wou'd find it of the utmost Concern for the true Office of Sureties or Godfathers c are to train up the young Plant till it is capable of bearing Fruit it self of Good Works But many nowadays do as the Turtles do by their  Eggs lay 'em cover 'em with Sand and never more regard 'em  We came into our old Course again and pursu'd it with success When we were got into the Latitude of the Tropick we duck'd our Men as before but there was a great Mutiny of the Sailors The Captain had three Dogs on Board and they wou'd have 'em duck'd as well as themselves unless he wou'd pay the usual Rate which being promis'd 'em they were compos'd again and the Sailors and Dogs were reconcil'd without going together by the Ears  We overtook an  English  Vessel that had suffer'd much by an Engagement with a  Spanish  Pyrate she had lost all her Masts but had rais'd a Jury MainMast yet cou'd make but little way by Reason of her Leaks Our Captain sent a Boat on Board and gave 'em all the Assistance he cou'd but finding it was but two Days since the Engagement we had some hopes of coming up with her being we learnt from the other Ship she was mightily disabled as well as themselves So we crowded all the Sails we cou'd and tho' it was in the Night we made the best of our way  The Vessel we left saluted us with five Guns to take their Leave which we answer'd with three and in a quarter of an Hour afterwards heard several Guns fir'd now and then as if some Vessel was in distress and in an Hour more discover'd a Light which we made directly towards and coming up with it found it to be the  Spanish  Vessel that had engag'd with the other  English  Ship two Days before the Light that they made was only a large Lanthorn fix'd on their main TopMast Head that we might the sooner perceive 'em We immediately hail'd 'em and commanded 'em to surrender They readily obey'd and beg'd our Assistance which they had great need of for the Water gaining upon 'em every Moment in an Hours time the Ship sunk but we had preserv'd all the Men being in number having lost in the Engagement with the  English  Ship and receiv'd several Shot between Wind and Water which they did not perceive till they discover'd two Foot Water in the Hold and found no hopes of being sav'd from the merciless Enemy the Sea if we had not fortunately  for them came timely to their Assistance But to allay their Joy for their Deliverance from Death they were made Prisoners and being Pyrates as we suppos'd for there was no War declar'd between the two Nations therefore they might very probably think they were to be punish'd with Death when they came on shore  The Ship sunk so fast that we cou'd save nothing but the Men which took us up about four Hours and then we pursu'd our Course and about four in the Evening made the Island  Barbados  where we set our  Spanish  Prisoners on shore Captain  Walton  gave the Governor an Account of what had happen'd and left it to his discretion to do with 'em as he thought fit  On  June  the Twentythird we set Sail for  Dominio  where we arriv'd without any Accident Here I went on shore along with several of our Men to get Wood and Water for our Ship The Natives seem'd very civil and came on Board us in their  Canoes  These  Indians  are most of 'em tall lusty Men well featur'd and well limb'd  but poor Brains for an ordinary Glass of Rum will make 'em drunk They mightily like this Liquor and will call for it as soon as ever they come on Board you They wear no Cloaths but a little Skirt about their Waste but most of 'em have Pieces of Brass in the form of a Threequarter Moon in their Nose and Ears I gave one of these  Indians  a pair of Breeches and he made an Essay to put 'em on in this manner He first put his two Arms into the Thighs of the Breeches and desir'd one of his Companions to button the Wasteband about his Neck but when we show'd him the right way and he had put 'em on he walk'd as if he had formerly worn Irons and was so uneasy with 'em that he pull'd 'em off and made Signs to have some Linnen in exchange In Return I gave him a long Cravat and ty'd it properly about his Neck But to see how the Fellow strutted one wou'd have taken him for one of the Captains of the Train'dBands ready to march  I rambled with these  Indians  several Miles up in the Country and saw their  Hutts that were dig'd about three Foot deep in the Earth and then rais'd about six Foot high above the Surface and cover'd with Barks of Trees and sometimes divided into Apartments by a couple of long Poles and Fathers Sons and Daughters lie promiscuously together  The Day before we sail'd after we had provided our selves with Wood and Water I went up to the  Indian  Hutts to exchange a trifle or two for one of their Bows and Arrows and returning towards the Ship by my self lost my way and tho' I directed my Course as I thought right I came to that part of the Shore where was no Ship to be found but endeavouring to go more West along the  Strand  my Way was intercepted by several high pointed Rocks which I made several fruitless Essays to pass I then endeavour'd to make a Compass within Land to get by the Rocks which I did but cou'd not find the Bay where the Ship rod I was now in a deep perplexity and tho' very much tyr'd yet resolv'd to look for the Track that wou'd  carry me back to some of the Huts where I might get an  Indian  to direct me but there were so many various ones that I knew not which to chuse At last I pitch'd upon one that brought me to several of 'em but not those from whence I came I search'd 'em but cou'd find no  Indians  in 'em I from thence walk'd a little farther but was surpriz'd with a Sight that shock'd me with Horror Near the Skirt of a thick Wood I found one of our Men kill'd with an Arrow in his Throat and by the Posture he lay in I found it was done when he was easing Nature The Object so overcame me that I thought not my own unhappy Condition till I was awak'd from my Stupidity by a Noise and Gabbling I heard in the Wood on my Right This put me into a terrible Fright which made me run as far from the Noise as I cou'd for I made no doubt that if they caught me I shou'd run the same Fate with the poor unfortunate Fellow who perhaps might lose his Life by his seeking me When I had got a considerable Distance I enter'd the Wood and  ventur'd to look out where I cou'd perceive tho' it was almost dark what they were doing  They cut off the poor Fellow's Head and tore out his Bowels in a most inhumane Manner Let any one judge what my Condition must be I'm sure my Thoughts were so confus'd that I might justly say I never thought at all I observ'd when they had done they carry'd him between Eight of 'em upon four Staves and went towards their Tents When they were gone and I had leasure for Reflection every Thought was a Dagger to me but yet when my Senses were compos'd I put my Trust in God that he wou'd deliver me from this Danger as well as several other imminent ones which through his Mercy I had overcome  I crept farther into the Wood to rest my Limbs but my Thoughts kept me waking all Night When Day approach'd I went still farther into the Wood not only to avoid those Barbarous  Indians  but to see if when on the other side I cou'd find some Path that wou'd lead me to the Bay where our Ship rode but  before I cou'd get out of it I heard a  Cannon  discharg'd that both rejoyc'd and griev'd me it joy'd me to know that the Ship cou'd not be far off and griev'd me to think that it was certainly the Signal for the Boat to come on Board and perhaps they might be that Moment under Sail I ran with all the haste I cou'd▪ but with a Mind mix'd with Hope and Fear I got out of the Wood at last and directed my Course to that Part as I thought the Noise of the Gun came from but cou'd find no Path yet at last I got to the Top of a Rock from whence I cou'd behold the Sea and the great Grief to see our Ship under Sail not half a League from the Shore I immediately pull'd off my Shirt and hung it to a Stick I had broke to support me in my Walking but my Signal did not do me any good for they saw nothing of it My Despair began to be predominant o're my Reason and I had often resolv'd to throw my self down from the Rock to end my Misery but still my Conscience wou'd give me a secret Check and at last I resolv'd with my self to submit to whatever  shou'd befall me with a thorough Resignation to the Will of Heav'n As soon as the Ship was out of sight I went down from the Rock not having power to stir before and endeavour'd to find some Food but was prevented by a hideous Noise I heard which drove me to shelter in the Wood again but the farther I went the plainer I heard the Noise so that I knew not what to do for at last it increas'd on every side So that coming to a thick parcel of Shrubs I laid my self down and couch'd so close that it was impossible for 'em to see me unless they came into the very middle of it I had thrown my Bow and Arrows away as being of no use to me but I had my Sword which however I did not design to use The Noise came so nigh me that I cou'd hear the Tread of their Feet and the Boughs rustle about me but at last they went insensibly away so that I heard no more of 'em for some time  When I found all was still I began to get up and look about me where I saw 'em in the Plain engag'd with several other  Indians  whom I thought I knew  tho' at a good Distance I saw several of 'em fall upon the Ground At last those  Indians  that went hollowing through the Wood seem'd to me to have the worst of it and were drove by the other Party quite back again but did not pursue 'em any farther only let fly their Arrows at 'em and one of 'em came among the Shrubs where I lay which startled me for I was afraid they wou'd come to look for their Arrows and so find me After the hurlyburly was over I resolv'd to go out of the Wood and follow those  Indians  that were Vanquishers with this hope That they might be of a milder Nature and not so barbarous as the others who run through the Wood who to my thinking had more stern Looks than those  Indians  I had seen upon that part of the Island where we us'd to Land to get Wood and Water So as I said I got up and directed my Course out of the Wood after the  Indians  but soon discover'd two  Indian  Men and four Women coming towards me which I suppose had hid themselves during the late Conflict It was to no purpose for me to fly for they had got  sight of me or if I had they wou'd have soon sent one of their winged Messengers after me so I chose boldly to meet 'em When we were come within forty Paces one of another one of the  Indians  was going to shoot at me but was withheld by one of the Women As soon as ever I came close to 'em they look'd upon me with strange Gestures and distorted Countenances I put my Hand to my Head and Breast which is the Token of Submission with the  Indians  and they let me know by Signs that I must go with them which I did not deny for if I had I knew I shou'd be forc'd so I went willingly enough When we had got through the Wood one of the  Indian  Men wou'd have my Coat and Wastecoat of which I durst not refuse The Coat he put upon his Companion and the Wastecoat on himself and strutted strangely I gave my Handkerchief and Neckcloth to the Woman that hinder'd the  Indian  from shooting at me who receiv'd it with a great deal of Joy and seem'd mightily pleas'd with me When we arriv'd at their Hutts there came out at least a Hundred  Frightfullooking  Indians  who came about me and had a great deal of Talk with those that brought me with 'em but the two  Indians  were forc'd to part with their Cloaths they had taken from me to two of the oldest  Indians  who immediately put 'em on and seem'd mighty proud of themselves They gave me some Rice and another sort of Victuals boyl'd but what it was compos'd of I cou'd never learn neither did I eat any of the same all the while I was among 'em When Night came I was sent into a Hutt by my self and the Door shut upon me I had a piece of Mat to lie on but nothing to cover me Now I had leasure to reflect upon my Misfortunes which I cou'd not do before by reason of the Fears I was in I thought my Condition was now worse than ever it was for I really believ'd they design'd to make a Sacrifice of me for I thought to my self they were Cannibals or MenEaters I pass'd the Night with a thousand Anxieties and Inquietudes but nevertheless my Senses were so tyr'd that I slept whether I wou'd or no and in the Morning was  awak'd by four of the Eldest  Indians  that came to visit me who made Signs to me to follow 'em which I did without any hesitation when I was out in the midst of the plain Place before the Doors of their Hutts they brought before me several of their Women and gave me to know by Signs that I shou'd take her to be my Mate or Bedfellow or suffer Death I must confess I was mightily shock'd but not giving my self much time to weigh or think of the Matter I pitch'd upon her that I had given my Neckcloth and Handkerchief too and immediately all the rest were dismiss'd and my Bride and I for it was even so were conducted to a Hutt where there was several old  Indians  waiting for me to compleat the Ceremony When my Bride and I came before 'em we were order'd to sit down then both our Feet were wash'd with Water After that they brought us a piece of their  Indian  Cake or Bread on which I was order'd to break off a piece and give to my Bride She then came and laid her Head on my Breast and then kneeling put my Right Foot upon her Neck when that was done  she rose and went out but immediately return'd and brought me some Flesh broil'd on the Coals with which she tore into Morsels and put in my Mouth and stood before me all the while I eat I must confess I was so hungry that I had a very good Appetite to my Victuals being I had not eat any Flesh for four Days But I had no great Stomach to my Bride although a young wellfeatur'd Woman yet her Complexion did not like me When I had done Eating my Bride and I were put into a Hutt and shut close without any Light but the old Proverb  Joan's as good as my Lady in the Dark  had like to have prov'd no Proverb to me In the Morning we were wak'd with a rude Noise round our Tent which startled me at first but I found afterwards it was a sort of an  Epithalamium  When they had made their frightful Noise for sometime they enter'd promiscuously Men and Women The Men came and took hold of me and the Women of my new Spouse led us out with Shouts unpleasing Noises and antick Gestures They continu'd it till we came to a River and then we  parted the Men with me and the Women with my Wife They put me into the River and wash'd me all over and I suppose the Women did as much by my Tawny Rib After they had given notice by their Shouts that they had made an End of scowring me they put on my Shirt and Drawers again and led me to the Bank where my Spouse waited for me with her Sheattendance and we return'd with the same Noise as we came out When we came to the Hutts the old  Indians  met us the Old Men took me and the Old Women my Wife and gave us an Entertainment seperably which lasted two Hours according to my Computation when they had made an End they fetch'd us out of our different Tents and seated us on a Bank and then danc'd and play'd such mad rude monkey Gambols that put me in mind of the mad Feasts of the  Bachii  in  Virgil  for they wou'd tear their Faces with their Nails and scratch one another so violently that one wou'd have thought they had been so many  Bethlemites  and yet all in Mirth for they wou'd laugh such Horselaughs when ever  any one of 'em was hurt that quite stun'd me When this sport was over the young  Indians  of both Sexes took my Bride and I into one of their Hutts and gave us an Entertainment of Fish broil'd upon the Coals and a pleasant Liquor in a  Calabash  that was exceeding strong which soon got into most of their Noddles and as fast as they grew a little Tipsie they reel'd out one by one and laid themselves before the Door of the Hutt and went to sleep My good Wife among the rest got her Dose too but was so monstrously loving withall that I cou'd not tell well what to do with her When Night came we retir'd to our Rest as before and were wak'd next Morning by another kind of Noise that was made with rude knocking at our Door or rather Basket for it was nothing else and five or six of the old  Indians  came in with Hatchets and other Instruments to enable us to get Food for our selves as I understood My Wife took me out by the Arm and carry'd me into the Wood with our Bows and Arrows and by her Signs gave me to understand that she wou'd bring me where I shou'd kill  some Creature At last we came to the Foot of a Hill where we ascended with some difficulty but when we had gain'd the Summit we discover'd vast Numbers or Herds of Goats My Spouse shot and kill'd one the first time but I was such a Bungler at it that I cou'd never do any execution But my Spouse was very dexterous as all the  Indians  are in the Island of  Dominico  My Wife seem'd to have a great Love for me and wou'd always make much of me her Way When we had skin'd our Goat we took out our Implements and made a Fire to broil some of it When it was ready I gave my Creator thanks for providing for us poor insignificant Mortals and looking towards Heav'n the Residence of him that form'd us all My Wife fix'd her Eyes upon me and then look'd upwards too with a kind of Concern After we had done I return'd thanks again in the same manner as before and my Wife did the same that is she star'd upwards again as if she had a mind to see something as she thought I look'd at And when she found she cou'd not see any thing  she came to me and put her Arm tenderly about my Neck and with a sort of a begging Tone seem'd to ask me by Signs and Words which I cou'd not understand what I meant by looking upwards I really griev'd to know that I cou'd not make her understand for I cou'd not learn any of their Speech but here and there a common Word neither did I ever perceive they had any manner of Worship to any thing otherwise if I wou'd have made her comprehend what I meant I might have found it no hard Matter to have converted her from their abominable Heathenism for she was of a mighty mild Nature very Loving and Courteous and nothing like the rest of the Savage Crew who were prone to all manner of Wickedness Her Voice too differ'd from theirs for most of the  Indians  pronounc'd their Words in their Throat as indeed you cou'd not well speak 'em without a Gutteral Sound yet she whatever was the meaning on't spoke her Words a different Way from the rest and had a pleasing Manner I really began to love her and only wish'd she had been my  Wife in the usual Forms She cou'd pronounce any Word in English that I wou'd say to her but I cou'd never get her to repeat whole Sentences and all she did was like a Parrot After we had done our huntingwork I was for going over the Hill to view the Country and walk'd up and down a good way but I observ'd my Wife was very uneasy but especially when I got to the Brow of the Hill On the other side which was about half a League over I made an Essay to go down she laid hold of my Arms and pull'd me back with all her force and with many supplicating Actions seem'd to beg of me not to go and when she found I was offering at it again she screem'd out so dismally that it frighted me from making any more attempts I endeavour'd to know what she meant but cou'd gather nothing from her Words and Actions that cou'd let me into any thing But she wou'd often handle her Bow and Arrows and with menacing Actions let me know there was some Danger As we went homeward this odd Accident ran very much in my Head and I was mighty  desirous to find out the meaning of it and every time I went to hunt there with my Wife I wanted sadly to get down the Hill on the other side This Hill was of a vast Length and extended from East to SouthWest almost across the Island I did not know how to contrive it but after hunting I made believe I was very much tyr'd and laid my self down in order to sleep and my Wife with her usual good humour accompany'd me and in a very little time I found she was in a sound Sleep I immediately rose and stole away softly upon my intended Journey I got away from my Wife without her awaking and came to the Brow of the Hill which I survey'd and found no difficulty in the descending When I had got to the Pottom of the Hill I was mightily pleas'd with the Evenness of the Ground and the Prospect round me which I cou'd compare to nothing but the Vale of  Esham  in  England  bating the Houses and Towns in't I had walk'd up and down the Vale for near an Hour and was preparing to go back the same way I came When looking back to take my last Survey I  saw a Smoak at a Distance and it ran in my Mind it was the very place that our Men us'd to go to from on Board to truck with the Inhabitants The Thought took up some of my Time and I believe if it had not been for a tender Regard for my Wife I had certainly directed my Course for that Smoak I saw there But I must confess I cou'd not think of leaving her behind me but Curiosity put it into my Head to go a little nearer that Smoak I had discover'd But just as I was moving that way I heard a dreadful Screaming behind me and turning about I saw my Wife upon the Brow of the Hill making the most pitiful Lamentation imaginable The tender Regard I now began to have for my Wife made me make all the haste I cou'd to her Relief as thinking some Mischance might have befell her When I came to the Bottom of the Hill I saw several of the  Indians  of our Neighbourhood waiting for me above and some were coming down As soon as I had got to the Top of the Hill I was immediately seiz'd by the  Indians  above and drag'd along as if I had been the greatest  Criminal imaginable and my poor Wife hanging upon my Arm all drown'd in Tears I cou'd not imagin what was the Matter and what cou'd be the Reason of their using me in that manner I found it must be something extraordinary by the Grief of my Wife whose Sorrow increas'd the farther I went towards our Hutts but e're we cou'd get there it rain'd and thunder'd so violently that we were well wash'd before we came to our Journey's End when we were within ken of our Hutts the whole Tribe came near us some skipping and dancing as mightily rejoyc'd others with the Face of Concern and hanging their Heads in sign of Sorrow and mightily lamented over my Wife After the old  Indians  had consulted some time they ty'd me to a wither'd Tree that stood at the Mouth of the Hutts then I began to understand what they meant for I cou'd perceive they were bringing Boughs of green Wood in order to burn me This Sight made my Courage fail me and it was impossible to express my Despair and Horror I found now that the last Day of my Life was  come for it was impossible to foresee any thing to the contrary My last Recourse was to the Maker and Giver of all good Things for I had try'd all other Means in vain as also had my poor Wife whose Rage and Despair overcame her and she was carry'd away by the Women in the utmost Agony After my Wife was gone they set fire to the Wood which enclos'd me which being green and wet with the late Rain was a great while in Burning all the while it was kindling some of the  Indians  jump'd round me and danc'd after their barbarous manner while others stood ready with their Bows and Arrows to shoot at me as I suppos'd if the Fire shou'd burn the Bands that ty'd me and I shou'd offer to run away The Wood being green as I said before was very stubborn in kindling which made the Apprehension more dreadful I made several Essays to break the Bands that held me but all my Efforts were but in vain and I observ'd every Time I made my fruitless Endeavours the barbarous Crew shouted and laugh'd for joy The Fire encreasing I pray'd to Almighty God to  give me Strength to bear the horrid Pain I was going to suffer and if it was possible to go out of the World with the Patience and Fortitude of a good Christian who was only going to change this troublesome Life for a better I compar'd my self to a wounded Person that must bear probing of his Hurts in order to cure 'em I now had given my self up entirely to my Thoughts of the other World and this seem'd to me like abandoning a barren Island in order to go to one where was plenty of every thing But before the Fire reach'd me there fell such a prodigious Showre of Rain mix'd with Thunder and Lightning that extinguish'd the Fire The Storm lasted for several Hours with the utmost Violence and I remain'd still ty'd to the Tree When the Storm was over they began to renew their Fire and brought the Wood nearer than before it being at first half a Yard from my Body all round but now they pil'd it close to me that the Fire might the sooner be my Executioner which I wish'd for as knowing it wou'd put me to a speedier Death But before  they had well plac'd the Wood they heard Shouts and Noises in the adjacent Woods upon which the  Indians  immediately ran away from me and took to their Arms in an Instant old and young The Noise came nearer and nearer still till at last I cou'd perceive several  Indians  bolt out of the Wood who were met by our  Indians  and a bloody Fight ensu'd The Enemy  Indians  seem'd to have the best on't by reason of some FireArms that they had with which they made strange havock with our  Indians  the Battle continu'd for some Hours with a great deal of Heat and many of our  Indians  fell At last the Enemy  Indians  drove ours even beyond the Hutts and I cou'd only hear the Noise they made being I was still fastned to the Tree The Fight continu'd out of sight about half an Hour when my Wife came running with all the Transports of Joy imaginable and after having put her Head under my Feet she unty'd me and fell upon me with all the Signs of a sincere Love I must confess I was mightily rejoyc'd to see my self at Liberty and let what wou'd happen my Condition cou'd  not be worse than it was some Hours ago I cou'd not forbear expressing my Love to my Wife by Kisses and Embraces We went to our Hutt and I took my Sword that had been laid up from my first being amongst 'em I was going out of my Tent in order to go with my Wife to some other part of the Island that was not known to these  Indians  But just as we came among the Tents three  Indians  met us that had run way from the Fight as I conjectur'd As soon as they saw me and my Wife they came up with a great deal of ill Nature in their Countenances and after some Talk with my Wife one of 'em with his wooden Sword went to make a Blow at me but my Wife interposing receiv'd the Blow upon her Head which struck her to the Ground bloody and senseless My Rage rose so high upon this that I cou'd not contain my self but I drew my Sword and thrust it up to the Hilt in the Wretches Body the other two seeing their Companion's Death ran upon me with the Rage of Lyons but I slipping on one side avoided the Strokes intended me They turn'd immediately  upon me and let drive at me several Blows which had the good Fortune not to hit me but I run one of 'em into the Throat with my Sword upon which he set up such a Cry that frightned me and ran away and was immediately follow'd by the other I then ran to the Assistance of my Wife who lay almost strangled in her own Blood I rais'd her from the Earth and seated her under the Tree where I was ty'd and brought her to her self a little but I found her Skull was crack'd with the Blow the  Indian  gave her and to my great Grief perceiv'd she was just expiring But the Sorrow and Tenderness to part with me as I judg'd by her Actions struck me to the Soul She laid one Arm about my Waste and her Head in my Lap but with such piteous Looks with her Eyes that almost distracted me She made Signs to me to look upward as I fancy'd to pray for her tho' I cou'd not tell for certain what she meant but she pronounc'd several Words with Earnestness and Passion and I really fancy'd if we  u'd have understood one another I shou'd have found she wou'd have had  some Notions of a supreme Being Before she expir'd the Enemy  Indians  return'd with all of our  Indian  Prisoners I mean all that they had not kill'd for out of Two Hundred  Indians  of our Party there was not above Twentytwo left They were mightily surpriz'd to find me for many of the Enemy  Indians  knew me and when I came to examine their Faces I remember'd they were the  Indians  that inhabited about the Bay where our Ship lay One or two of 'em cou'd speak a little English that they learn'd by conversing with the  English  that usually Anchor'd in the Bay One of 'em knew my Name that he had gather'd from our Sailors enquiring for me when sent by the Captain before the Ship sail'd Master  Falconer  says he me glad to see you White Men belong to great Ships come look for you very Great and not look you here go away much sorry My Wife took up all my Thoughts who was just dying and though her Strength and Speech fail'd her yet she endeavour'd to pull down my Face to hers which she kiss'd th  n sunk her Head into my Bosom and expir'd  I was really as much concern'd as if I had marry'd one of my own Complexion and Country for I had great Hopes if ever I cou'd have made my Escape with her and cou'd but have taught her English to have made her a good Christian With the Assistance of my now friendly  Indians  I laid her in the Earth They told me she was Daughter to one of the Chief of their EnemyTribe From these  Indians  I learn'd that those I had fell amongst were a Tribe of  Indians  that had liv'd on this side the Ridge of Mountains for many Years and declar'd open War with those of the other side for holding Correspondence with  Whites  and were so strict that they put all  Indians  to Death that ever attempted singly to go over the Mountains which was the Reason of my Danger of Burning The Women that they took all that were with Child were shot to Death and the Men in general ran the same Fate for they were resolv'd not to have any one of the Breed alive When they had plunder'd the Hutts they went through the Woods and over the Mountain again and so to their own  Hutts which I knew The Old Men and Women met 'em skipping and danceing for Joy of their Success and some Mourning for the Loss of a Husband Brother or Father that was slain in Battle These friendly  Indians  were often plagu'd with their sudden rushing upon them and destroying many of them till at last they took up a resolution to Assault them and if possible to extirpate the whole Race and they had often made Inroads upon 'em which lessen'd their Number till this last ended 'em as I said before The Women and Female Children dwelt contentedly among 'em being they had no where to go I began to live comfortably among these  Indians  and us'd to partake of their Diversion and Labour as Hunting and Fishing c These  Indians  were so expert in Shooting with their Bows and Arrows that I have seen 'em hit the Mark Three Hundred Yards within the compass of a half Crown  This Island of  Dominico  took its Name from its being discover'd on a  Sunday  It is computed to be in length about thirty Leagues and about twentyeight in  breadth It is very mountainous especially to the NorthEast I have heard there are some  French  Settlements upon the Island but I enquir'd of the abovemention'd  Indian  who assur'd me there was not any Inhabitants but Natives and of those not above a Hundred Families who were mostly seated near that Part that compos'd the Harbour Says the  Indian  that I us'd to talk with there be some indeed a great way off in  de Island  dat are our Fathers and Mothers and some of our Wives dat when de die we throw into de Sea and de swim to dat place and when we die we swim dere too By this we might perceive they had some Notion of the Immortality of the Soul I did my Endeavour to make him sensible of the Joys of Heaven and Pains of Hell but to no purpose I told him of a superior Being that commanded all things below and that Righteous People dwelt with him after this Life He ask'd where my God live His Throne is in Heaven answer'd I pointing upward where He sits to Judge the Quick and Dead He  live up dare high how you get up high no steps reach dare It is our Immortal Part added I that ascends our Soul which is cloath'd with the Grace of our Divine Creator and enjoys an Eternity of Blessings You be de  White Man  you have Soul we be no  White  we have no Soul when we die we fling in Water big Fish come carry us to an oder place den we live dare and die agen and Fish bring us upon back to an oder place How are you assur'd of this says I Have you ever seen any that have been transported in the manner you tell me of No answer'd he but me sure it be so But when we were carry'd by Fish to dat oder place we eat de Leaf of Tree dat we can no remember what we do in toter place dat we be bring from All the Arguments I cou'd use was of no Effect for Heathenism was so rooted in him and all the other  Indians  that it will be the greatest Difficulty imaginable to bring 'em to embrace Christianity Their Understandings are so infirm that without a Miracle there will be no curing 'em The  Indians  wou'd have had me marry'd into one of their Tribe and I fearful to deny 'em brought my self off by telling no  White  cou'd marry under twelve Moons after their Wive's Death with which they seem'd satisfy'd but made me Promise when that time was expir'd to change my Condition of Widower to that of Marry'd Man I might have been accommodated with a SheCompanion if I had found any Inclination but I evaded it as well as I could  The Soil of the Island is very fruitful and there's plenty of every thing  I could not perceive that these  Indians  worship'd any thing except the Moon Which when at full they would all gather together and looking upward stand gazing a considerable time and then with one Consent pronounce a word which sounded like  Hiu  This word they generally repeated three times When they had done  Stargazing  they would fall to Jumping and Capering like so many mad things When that was over they would retire to their several Hutts and not stir out till Morning upon any account  I ask'd  Will  for that was the Name of him that could speak English who was mighty proud to be call'd so what Ceremony was it they perform'd after they were retir'd into their Hutts But he answer'd  Me no tell dat Wife make much Noise she no care for dat when you have new Wife you know what we do but me no tell till den  What gave me a Curiosity to know was that  Will  told me that after the Ceremony was over I must not offer to come out of my Hutt nor come a nigh any of theirs for if I did they would kill me The Hutt that was built for me was order'd in another manner than their own with a high Door made of Wicket there's being so low that an ordinary siz'd Man must have stoop'd to go in or out  I us'd to go fish in their  Canoes  with 'em where they would catch good store and let it be what it would the Cargo was divided among the whole Tribe only he that caught 'em chose first  I told  Will  that as soon as ever a Ship arriv'd there I did design to imbark in her in order to pursue my Voyage But he  told me I must take care not to let any other of the  Indians  know it for they would never suffer any one to go from 'em after they had been once settled among 'em How do you know that says I Have you had any Talk with 'em concerning me He told me he had not but it was their way For he gave me to understand that about six Years ago there was four Men left on shore upon their Island by reason of their Vessel driving out to Sea by a Hurricano and these four Men settled among 'em and marry'd  Indian  Wives and had Children by 'em But at any time when a Ship came into the Bay they were hurry'd a great way up in the Country and detain'd there till the Ships were gone and then liv'd with 'em as before But a small Vessel putting in there by Night the EnglishMen spy'd it before any of the  Indians  and were got to the Shore side conversing with the Crew of the Vessel before the  Indians  found 'em out But when they saw 'em talking together they were mightily enrag'd The four Men went on Board the Vessel to make merry with  their Countrymen and afterwards came on shore again and made it no Secret that they design'd to go on Board that Vessel in order to go to their own Country The  Indians  took no notice for the present But the Day they design'd to imbark they set upon the Vessel with their  Canoes  and kill'd every Person on Board it When they had done that they took as many things out of her as they had occasion for and set her adrift He told me that the four  Englishmen  were the first that taught 'em to use FireArms and in the Ship they took they had several Muskets and Quantities of Powder and Shot But carrying the Powder to their Hutts a Boy met 'em smoaking in a Cane they call a Smoaking Cane and by some Accident the Fire caught hold of the Powder and blew it up with the Death of Eight  Indians  and wounding several others After they had brought every thing up to their Hutts they took the Wives of the four Sailors the  Indians  with their Children and shot 'em to Death with Arrows This is the Sense of the Story  Indian Will  told me which  was pretty hard to pick out too considering his manner of telling it The Relation made me very uneasy yet put me upon thinking to make my Escape the first Opportunity I waited a full Month before I could see any Vessel but at last one came into the Harbour I perceiv'd they came in order to get Wood by hoisting out their long Boat but as I was observing 'em I was seiz'd by several  Indians  and carry'd at least six Miles up in the Country in order to be secur'd till the Ship should be gone I began to despair now of ever getting away being it was natural to suppose that they would be more watchful over me for the future Besides I did not know but they would use me after another manner and not let me have so much Liberty as I had before I wanted for nothing in my Confinement and was only guarded by four  Indians  that went to sleep when I did I once thought I might make my Escape whilst they slept but afterwards repented that Thought in knowing if they should chance to wake I was certainly a dead Man for  Indian Will  told me as I was carrying away that  the  Indians  had Orders to shoot me if I offer'd to make my Escape Besides I should have found it difficult enough to have known my way especially in the Dark for they carry'd me to a place that I had never been at before I had been here four Days and had given over all Hopes of my Liberty and began to call together my scatter'd Thoughts that were fluster'd upon that Occasion when on the fourth Day about Noon I was agreeably surpriz'd with  English  Voices I began to prick up my Ears and wish'd they might come to the place where I was I was not long in expecting of 'em for one of 'em spying the Hutt where I was call'd out to the others to come along for here's an  Indian  's Hutt says he we'll go in it and see what they'll give us With that they immediately came in before two of my  Indians  could hide me the other two being gone in the Morning to the Village As soon as ever I saw 'em tho' Strangers I could not forbear showing my Transports at the sight of my Countrymen They were mightily surpriz'd to see me and when I told 'em my Condition they said  they would have me along with 'em in spight of their Teeth But I told 'em that was very dangerous for if these  Indians  should raise the Village that lay within a Mile of the Shore we should all lose our Lives Some advis'd to knock 'em on the Head but I could not agree to that for these were  Indians  that never injur'd me Two of my Countrymen had got a couple of Spawwater Flasks fill'd with Rum upon the sight of which a Thought came into my Head that seem'd the most likely to compass my Design I told my Countrymen if we could make the  Indians  drunk there might be some hopes of getting off without either hurting them or endangering our selves We drank to one another and the  Indians  did us Reason in pledging us for I believe out of the two Flasks they drank one and three quarters It soon began to work with them and they got up and fell a Dancing most madly and a while after drop'd down dead Drunk We resolv'd to tye 'em Hands and Feet that if they awak'd they might not follow us and raise the whole Body of  Indians  upon us With the help of  our Garters we ty'd 'em fast enough without waking 'em and made the best of our way towards the Seaside All the Danger we ran was in meeting with any of the other  Indians  but we happily avoided 'em and came to the place where the Boat lay The Ship was ready to Sail having got their Wood and Water aboard and these eight Men were those that had been labouring hard in cutting Wood c and so were resolv'd to go up the Country to view it never having been farther than the place where they fell'd the Trees and happily for me came to give me my Liberty under Providence As we were getting into the Boat to go on Board the Ship having made a Waft in her Ancient  Indian Will  came running down almost out of Breath and cry'd Get quick in Ship they come down presently kill all me go wid you de kill me else for tell you We hurry'd away and  Indian Will  with us and got on Board in very good time for before we were well under Sail we could perceive at least Two Hundred  Indians  bringing their  Canoes  with 'em We had a brisk Gale so that they could not  well overtake us for they never go above two Leagues from shore Nevertheless they put their  Canoes  in the Water and began to paddle after us The Captain was for Firing at 'em with our great Guns but I perswaded him against it by telling him it might be worse for other  English  Vessels that should come after us and as they could not overtake us to do us any damage it was best not to take any notice of 'em When we had lost sight of  Dominico  I ask'd  Indian Will  the Reason of their endeavouring to detain all  Whites  in that clandestine Manner and he gave me to know that they fear'd if the  Whites  should know the Smallness of their Number that they would put 'em all to Death and seize upon the whole Island The Ship that took us up was call'd the  Twins  from  Caroline  Captain  Fuller  Commander she came then from  Barbadoes  and was bound for  Jamaica  I took  Indian Will  as my Servant and did design to give him some Cloaths as soon as we arriv'd at  Jamaica  but for the present I had none for my self and made but an odd sort of a Figure My Beard was  pretty long and being something inclining to Red look'd but oddly My Lining was all gone so that my whole Dress consisted of a Hat a Wastecoat a pair of Breeches and a pair of Shooes The Captain was so kind to lend me a Shirt and a pair of Stockings and I got my Beard off and once more look'd like a Christian We made  Jamaica  without meeting with any thing material and found the Fleet at Anchor I went on Board the Admiral and paid my Respects to him which he took very kindly I there once more met with my Friend Mr  Musgrave  and the rest of my Companions who had given me over for lost for Captain  Walton  told the Admiral and my Comrades that I was certainly Murther'd by the  Indians  I had all my Things restor'd me that were brought in the  Albion  Frigate that arriv'd about a Week before me with the Stores of the Fleet after she had been in the Dock at  Plimouth  and well mended She also brought News of War being declared between  England  and  France  and the Death of his Sacred Majesty King  William  the Third of Glorious  Memory and the Coronation of her Majesty Queen  Anne July  the  th  The whole Fleet set out from  Jamaica  in order for a Descent upon St  Domingo  as was suppos'd but things not answering the Admiral in the  Breda  Captain  Fog  with six other Men of War  viz Defiance  Captain  Kirby Greenwich  Captain  Wade Windsor  Captain  Constable Ruby  Captain  Walton Falmouth  Captain  Vincent  and  Pendennis  Captain  Hudson  in quest of Monsieur  du Casse  the  French  Commodore that was design'd for  America  with Ammunition Forces Provision and Money to pay the Garrisons besides several Governors to be put in the room of others that were call'd back We directed our Course to Port  Leogaon  where  du Casse  was expected every Day But when we came there we were inform'd that  du Casse  was Sail'd for  Carthagena  upon which we directed our Course for that place after having taken three Ships one of Sixteen another of Thirty call'd  Reine de Angelos  or the Queen of Angels and another of Six Guns richly Laden beside three Barks  taken by Captain  Constable  in the  Windsor  and a fourth Sunk likewise a  French  Man of War of Forty Guns burnt  On the  th  of  August  O S about in the Morning we discover'd Ten Sail to the Eastward of us which we bore up to and found 'em to be the Fleet we were in quest of tho' there was Ten Sail yet there was but Six Fighting Ships the rest were StoreShips which made the best of their Way so when the Admiral came up with 'em we had but Six to Engage The Line of Battle was form'd about three in the Afternoon The  Defiance  led the Van the  Windsor  second and  Benbow  in the  Breda  the third These three kept pretty close together but the other four were a League behind At four in the Afternoon we began the Engagement but the  Defiance  after firing three Guns bore away to Leeward and lay there out of Gunshot all the Evening so that the whole strength of the  French  Fleet lay upon the Admiral and the  Windsor  till it was Dark In the Night the  Windsor  fell foul of our Ship which startled a great many that were not upon Deck as believing it  might be a  French  Fireship tho' we knew they had not one in the Fleet But Fear as well as Passion blends our Reason The Wind chop'd about in the Night so that we had the Weathergage of 'em upon which we bore down upon 'em and engag'd for three Hours but the  Ruby  Captain  Walton  was disabl'd and order'd by the Admiral to make for  PortRoyal  My Man  Indian Will  who was on Board dress'd like an  European  was terribly frighted with the Noise of our Guns and every time he saw the Flash of our Enemy's Cannon he wou'd squat down upon the Deck and lye flat upon his Belly for some time one of our Men that was shot in the Guts lay expiring and  Indian Will  was getting away out of Danger he said but unfortunately stumbled over the Dying Man who in the Pangs of Death grasp'd  Will  so fast that he cry'd out lustily for Help but it was more than I could do to unclench his Hand till he was quite Dead and then we releas'd poor  Will  frighted out of his Wits who could not be prevail'd upon to come upon Deck any more till we told him we had done  Fighting We took one Ship from the  French  that they had taken from the  English  in their Voyage The Fight lasted six Days on and off but the Admiral being wounded in the Thigh and finding that  Wade Kirby  and  Hudson  did not care for Fighting we left 'em after disabling two of their Ships and directed our Course back to  Portugal  As soon as we arriv'd there the Admiral sent Orders to confine Captain  Constable Wade Kirby  and  Hudson  and Summon'd a CourtMarshal Try'd 'em and found 'em Guilty of Cowardice excluding  Constable  and accordingly the other Three were sent to  England  to receive Sentence of Death which was executed upon Two of 'em The Third Captain  Hudson  dy'd in the Voyage and so prevented an Ignominious Death How easy had it been for the  English  to have taken the  French  if they had been unanimous but such an Instance of Pusillanimity is not to be found in the Records of the Navy  December  the  th  We were all concern'd with the News of Admiral  Benbow  's Death who dy'd of the Wound in  his Thigh that he receiv'd in the Engagement with Monsieur  du Casse  lamented by all I observ'd there was a perfect Groan in every Ship in the Fleet when the Admiral's Flag was Lor'd with a Whiff which is the Custom at Sea He was bury'd at  Kingstown  where he dy'd He had several rich  Plantations  in  Jamaica  and many Slaves He had made five successful Voyages to  Jamaica  and return'd home laden with Wealth and Honour but the sixth prov'd fatal to Him He had a perfect Knowledge in the Navigation of  America  having been several Years Captain of a Privateer there He was a Man belov'd of both Officers and Common Sailors a Person of true Courage and Fortitude For when he was wounded in the Engagement he order'd the Carpenters to make him a Cradle that he might be upon Deck to give Orders Nothing went more near his Heart than this unfortunate Expedition and the Surgeons reported that the Grief he conceiv'd from it hinder'd the healing of his Wound which was given with a MusketBall and  not a ChainShot as has been reported in our Publick Papers Admiral  Martin  as being the eldest Officer supply'd his Place till Admiral  Whetstone  arriv'd in the  Boyne  My very good Friend Captain  Hercules Mitchell  Captain of the  Strombelo  Fireship was made Captain of the  Windsor  and Admiral  Benbow  being Dead I remov'd my self with Captain  Fog  's leave into his Ship The Fleet set Sail with the Merchant Ships for  England March  the  th  and met with nothing worthy of Note  On  May  the  th  we enter'd St  John  's Harbour in  Newfoundland  and stay'd there till  May  the  th  then set Sail for the  Bay of Bulls  a convenient Harbour to Wood and Water in the same Island After we had provided every thing we wanted there we weigh'd Anchor in order to Sail for  England  In weighing our best  Bowre  an Anchor so call'd the Nippers giving way the CaptstornBarrs kill'd us three Men and broke the Back of a fourth who dy'd in a Week after  November  the st we were separated from the Fleet by a dreadful Storm that threw all our Masts by the Board and our Boltsprit was also Sprung but we fish'd that which preserv'd it We were in a very pitiful Condition and I am sure in great Danger for I really heard some of the Sailors at their Prayers We lost two of our Men who fell with the Mainmast overboard The Storm lasted for two Days and the Weather continu'd so Hazy we could not take our Observations We put up our JuryMasts but could make but little Way We had Captain  Titchburn  's Company of  Marines  and Major  Bowls  Major of the Regiment that did belong to Colonel  Jones  who dy'd in the Voyage so that having above our Complement our Provision began to be at an Ebb which obliged us all to come to halfallowance and half a Pint of Water a Day to each Man for we did not know how long we should be out at Sea but we made  Ireland  beyond all our Hopes  November  the  th  and got safe into  Gallaway  Harbour on the  d  and it was a great Providence we did so for on the  th  there arose such a violent Storm that must have inevitably destroyed us This was that fatal Hurricane that did so much Dammage in  England  c There was two Ships in  Gallaway  Harbour that was stranded and it was allowed by every Body that we should have run the same Fate if our Masts had been standing but having none but JuryMasts which we took down when the Storm began to be pretty high so that the Wind could not have the same Power over us neither do I think shat the Storm was so violent in  Ireland  by all Description as it was in  England Holland  and  France  We stay'd at  Gallaway  four Months and in that time we had got Masts up and repair'd our other Dammages While the Ship was fitting up I lay on shore in the Town  Gallaway  is a  neat wellfortify'd Town as big as  Salisbury  yet has but one Church Every thing is very cheap there I had my Board in a private House for four Shillings  per  Week and seldom Din'd without two or three Dishes at Table We bought the best  French  Wine for Fourteen pence  per  Quart and sometimes under We set Sail from  Gallaway February  the  th  and arrived safely at  Plymouth  Thus after many Misfortunes and Hazards I once more set my Feet upon my dear native Country accompany'd with  Indian Will  who still lives with me and proves an honest faithful Servant and I have taken Pains to have him instructed in the Christian Religion and likewise to have him Christned by the Name of  William Dominico  from the Island that he came from and tho' warn'd by many Dangers I had run I could not forbear making three Voyages more but yet in a Station different from what I went before But as they were but common Voyages that is nothing extraordinary happening I shall conclude with my Prayers and Thanks to Heaven for the many Mercies I have received wishing long Life and Happiness to my King Prosperity Peace and Riches to my Country and a hearty Union among my Fellow Subjects  FINIS
